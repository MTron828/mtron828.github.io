Chapter 231: Jeanne Is Drunk

A week later, the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse case was closed.

Adrian colluded with Tenda to use the dual contract for personal gains. The circumstances were serious, but given their good attitude toward admitting mistakes, Adrian was sentenced to nine years in prison, Tenda was sentenced to seven years in prison, and Lunetta was sentenced to five years in prison.

Within a week, the Lawrence Enterprise re-appointed a chief engineer of the engineering department and tendered for a new contractor.

The logistics warehouse project of the Lawrence Enterprise regained its peace.

Jeanne sat in the office of the director of the marketing department. After she finished processing some official documents, she looked at the time and prepared to get off work.

Kingsley was leaving tomorrow.

Jeanne was going to give him a farewell tonight.

She called Monica.

Monica was flattered when she received Jeanne’s call. She said in a strange tone, “Sister Jeanne, why are you thinking of me?”

Jeanne smiled and asked, “Didn’t you want to have dinner with Kingsley? I’ll fulfill your wish tonight.”

“Oh-ho. Do you think I’m so free? I have a schedule too, so I’m not free tonight,” Monica refused flatly.

“What are you doing tonight?”

“It’s my dad.” Monica was a little speechless, but she also seemed to be helpless, “My dad is going to turn 50 the day after tomorrow. There are so many things to be done for the birthday party, and I’ve been so busy these past few days. Tonight, I still have to go and finalize the details for him. If I don’t go, he’ll break my legs.”

“Then you should get busy with his matter first.” Jeanne did not insist.

“By the way, will there be a chance for me to have a meal with Kingsley next time?”

“It’s hard to say.” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

After Kingsley left this time, who knew when he would come back?

“What’s your relationship with Kingsley? Why is he so good to you? Could it really be—” Monica’s heart was beating non-stop. She was afraid that they had that kind of relationship.

“It’s not,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“That’s good. Fourth Master still has a chance then.” Monica was relieved.

To her, the official match was still Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne.

It was unshakable.

Even if Kingsley was rich and handsome, she would not change her mind.

“Monica, it’s impossible between Fourth Master Swan and me. Don’t think too much about it.” Jeanne did not want to break Monica’s heart.

“Why is it impossible? Isn’t it obvious that Fourth Master Swan likes you?” Monica was agitated.

‘It’s not that it isn’t obvious.

‘It’s just… impossible.’

“That’s enough. Spend some time looking after yourself instead. I don’t know how a person with a messed-up marriage can have the face to interfere in other people’s relationships,” Jeanne deliberately mocked Monica.

Monica was obviously angry. “My marriage isn’t messed-up, okay?! It’s clear that it’s just a marriage of convenience. I’ll divorce Finn and throw myself into Micheal’s arms at most this or next month. I’m going to be happy soon!”

As she spoke, she was a little excited.

“You really like Micheal?”

“I do.”

“You’re not doing it to—”

“No!” Monica was resolute. “Finn and I are in the past.”

“I won’t say much about your relationship. After all, no one knows who you truly like other than yourself. However, Monica, let me remind you again that Micheal isn’t as simple as you think. People in politics aren’t that simple.”

“Could it be that people in politics don’t get married anymore?” Monica asked.

‘Alright, you win,’ Jeanne thought.

“Don’t worry, my relationship with Micheal is real. I really like Micheal too. I won’t let myself be wronged.” Monica knew that Jeanne was doing this for her own good, but when it came to relationships, she knew her feelings.

She and Finn would never be happy for the rest of their lives!

“It’s fine as long as you know who you like. Let’s chat again next time.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She looked at the time. There were still a few minutes left before work ended, so she took a cigarette and started smoking.

Jeanne was given three months.

Half of that time had passed.

She stood up and walked toward her French window. She looked at the tall buildings in the city and on the streets. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

At the end of the day, did she have feelings for this city?!

Suddenly, the image of a person appeared in her mind.

She pursed her lips.

Fourth Master Swan should not disturb her life.

She diverted her thoughts and picked up the phone to make a call. “Miles, have you picked up George?”

“Yes, I’ve just arrived at the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Okay, I’ll be right down.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and called Kingsley. “I’m coming to pick you up from the enterprise now. You should get ready.”
