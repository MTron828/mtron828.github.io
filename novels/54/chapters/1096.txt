1097 Lucy’s Resistance

She said, “A new batch of assassins came in a few days ago. Go and ask K01. He’s in charge of the overall planning. Ask him to give you some advice.”

“Thank you, Ms. Harmon.”

“We’re all working for Mr. Thorn anyway, so you’re welcome.”

The high-level assassin thanked her again before he quickly left.

At the same time, Lucy also left the manor with Kerby in his car.

In the manor, the high-level assassin returned quickly to Kingsley’s room, followed by a somewhat unfamiliar face.

At that time, Kingsley had just taken a shower. When he came out of the bathroom, he had a bath towel wrapped around his body, revealing his good figure.

That was the first time the new female assassin saw the head of the Hills, Kingsley.

She thought that he would have a ferocious face covered in scars, but he was a hundred times more handsome than she had imagined. At that moment, she saw Kingsley, and although there were still some scars on his body, they did not affect the look of his muscles at all. As he had just finished showering, his muscles were still dripping with water, and he looked unreal.

The female assassin did not dare to size him up boldly.

After all, she knew that even though he looked good, he was the head of the Hills, and she did not dare to cross the line.

The news of Millie’s death had spread widely among the assassins of the Hills. Therefore, no one dared to push their luck in front of Kingsley.

“Have you taken a shower?” Kingsley asked.

He did not ask who the assassin was.

He had heard that a new batch of people had come, so perhaps she was one of them.

“Yes.” When K01 told her to go to Kingsley’s room, he reminded her to wash up before going.

“Come here,” Kingsley ordered.

As the assassin walked over obediently, the high-level assassin left and closed the door for them.

Then, the two assassins stood at the door, smoking.

They knew very well how long Mr. Thorn would take, and that was probably the most relaxing moment of their day.

Moreover, it had been a long time since Mr. Thorn gave them time to relax.

Hence, they figured it should take a long time this time. After all, he needed to vent his long-held lust.

With that thought in mind, the two assassins seemed rather relaxed as they smoked their cigarette slowly.

However, at that moment, the door was suddenly pulled open.

The two assassins’ hands that were holding the cigarettes stiffened. Then, they extinguished it at an astonishing speed, threw it on the ground, and stepped on it.

They watched as the female assassin walked out.

It had only been a few minutes! Was it ten or five minutes? It should have taken at least two hours.

How was it so fast? Could it be that Mr. Thorn really was old?

The female assassin did not dare to stay and ran away as quickly as she could.

The two high-level assassins looked at each other and then quickly entered the room.

In the room, Kingsley’s expression was extremely cold as he sat on the bed. Even a powerful man like him seemed to have his unspeakable secrets.

Of course, the two assassins did not say anything. They just stood there respectfully.

“Where’s Lucy?” Kingsley suddenly snapped.

The high-level assassin paused for two seconds before he quickly replied, “I just saw Ms. Harmon and Kerby leave the manor together.”

Kingsley glared at him, and the high-level assassin was terrified UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’ll give her a call immediately,” the assassin said immediately.

“No need.” Kingsley’s face was ashen. “Get out!”

“Yes.” The two assassins left in a hurry.

They did not dare to delay even half a second.

During this period of time, Mr. Thorn’s temper was bad enough. Coupled with his dignity as a man, he would burst like an atomic bomb at that moment!

Lucy and Kerby came back a little late at night.

Lately, Lucy had indeed been close to Kerby, but of course, she did not sleep with Kerby that night.

Kerby was almost castrated because of her last time, so he did not dare to touch Lucy. However, because of Lucy’s special care, the two of them grew closer. On top of that, Lucy also wanted to train Kerby, so she spent more time and effort on him. Today, the two of them left the manor together to take Kerby to do some extreme training.

She had a feeling that the war that the Hills was about to face could break out at any time, and Kerby could become a very important member.

When the two of them returned to the manor, Kerby sent Lucy back to her room.

At the door, Kerby suddenly said, “Ms. Harmon.”

“Yes?” Lucy looked at him.
