1086 Great Satisfaction, Michael’s Tragic End

A full hour passed before the judge and the jury returned to the courtroom.

Everyone stood up.

The judge announced the result of the trial. “After some deliberation, we believe that the case has been investigated and defended by the court and that there are sufficient pieces of evidence. The defendant, Michael Ross, in order to take revenge on Monica and suppress Cardellini Pharmaceutical to monopolize the pharmaceutical market, is found guilty of replacing the original vaccine with potassium cyanide, which caused the death of a child. He also instigated Daniel Cook, the director of the quality inspection department, and Brie Larson… The people mentioned are found guilty of producing a false quality inspection report.

“Michael is also found guilty of instigating Wally Fisk to inject potassium cyanide into a child and instructing Rob Witherspoon to steal Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s six core research and development technologies. The defendant, Daniel, was found guilty of bending the law for personal gain, helping Michael to produce a fake quality inspection report, and helping Michael conceal the truth and forging the facts.

“The defendant, Brie, is found guilty of bending the law for personal gain and helping Michael issue a fake quality inspection report. The defendant, Wally Fisk, is guilty of being bribed by Michael to inject potassium cyanide into a child, which caused the child’s death. The defendant, Rob Witherspoon, is found guilty of illegally stealing the technology developed by Cardellini Pharmaceutical under Michael’s bribe. The defendant...”

“Based on the facts of the defendant’s crime, the nature of the crime, the circumstances, and the degree of harm to society, according to article 120, article 230, article 96, article 89 of the Criminal Code of Harken... The verdict is as follows:

“Firstly, the defendant, Michael, is charged with intentional homicide and is sentenced to death. He is sentenced to five years in prison for instigating others to break the law. He will be sentenced to eight years in prison for infringing the law and stealing trade secrets. For intentional framing, he will be sentenced to two years in prison. In the end, he will be sentenced to death and executed immediately.

“Second, the defendant, Daniel...”

The others were not important to Monica.

She just watched as the judge announced the court’s verdict, listening to the judge’s sonorous, powerful, and solemn sentence.

Finally, Michael was done for. He was given the death penalty and would be executed immediately.

There was no room for him to turn things around.

The judge finished announcing everyone’s sentence.

“Finally, because Sunny Pharmaceutical stole Cardellini Pharmaceutica’s research and development information, we now require all of Sunny Pharmaceutical’s products to include the following: All of them are to stop production, and sales are prohibited. Once found, they will be held legally accountable for the illegal sales of products in Harken. At the same time, according to the losses caused by Sunny Pharmaceutical’s illegal theft of Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development technology, Cardellini Pharmaceutical will be compensated according to the market value, which is a total of 230 million dollars. If they can’t compensate, they’ll be held responsible according to the law, and the person in charge of Sunny Pharmaceuticals, Michael, will bear the responsibility.”

It meant that Sunny Pharmaceutical would have to stop all of its production and sales. In other words, Sunny Pharmaceutical would be completely out of business, but Cardellini Pharmaceutical would not be compensated for its financial losses. After all, Michael would be responsible, and since he had been sentenced to death, he would not have to bear the responsibility.

At that moment, Monica could tell that it was the Sanders’ arrangement.

It was impossible for the Sanders to foot the bill for Michael again and again.

Without Sunny Pharmaceutical, they would already be at a huge loss, so they would not be willing to lose another sum of money.

Although Monica was unwilling, the result was fair, and Monica achieved everything she wanted.

If they lost some money, they could get it back.

As long as Michael was dead, that was enough! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“The above is the verdict of the court of South Hampton City. If there is any disagreement, please do this within seven days of receiving the verdict! The court is adjourned!”

With the court adjourned, the jury stood up and left with the judge. After that, the rest of the people left one after another.

However, Monica did not leave. Instead, she sat in the plaintiff’s seat and watched Michael being taken away emotionlessly.

He was taken away by the prison guards in a sorry state.

She did not know what was in Michael’s mind. All she knew was that Michael was finally getting what he deserved!

“Ms. Cardellini.” Judah was sorting out his information and was a little surprised to see that she had no intention of leaving.

Logically speaking, she should be happy that she had won the case.

However, she did not look happy. In fact, she looked like she was overcome with despair. It was as if she could not feel the victory at that moment, like she was alone in her own world and could not sense any information from the outside world.

“Ms. Cardellini?” Judah could not help but call out to her again when he did not get a response from Monica.
