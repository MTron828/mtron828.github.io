Monica went to the hospital for a checkup.

She really did not know if it was because she was pregnant or because she was not used to the environment overseas. Anyway, she felt so sick that she felt like she almost died overseas.

After they got off the plane, Brandon sent Monica to the hospital. On the way there, she vomited non-stop, and it was extremely uncomfortable.

The doctor did an ultrasound to confirm whether she was really pregnant and whether the fetus in her stomach was fine. Anyway, Monica suffered for a long time before she was sent to the ward.

She was lying on the hospital bed, and the doctor was giving her a drip. It was not to stop the vomiting but to ensure that her metabolism was maintained so that she would not throw up and lose her balance.

Brandon had been busy throughout the week. Therefore, now that he had finally settled Monica down, he did not dare to neglect her. At the thought of their few days abroad, he started to get afraid as he had never seen Monica so weak before.

Ever since he returned to the country and got along with Monica, he thought she was so strong that she could destroy anything. Yet, now that she had fallen sick, her body seemed to collapse on itself.

It did not seem to be an illness. She was just pregnant.

At that moment, he was also waiting for the doctor to bring out the pregnancy test results, and the two of them waited in the ward for a while.

Then, a doctor came in with a report and said, “Ms. Cardellini, you’re indeed pregnant. From the ultrasound, you’re eight weeks in.”

Even though Monica knew that, hearing it from someone else was like a bolt from the blue.

She gritted her teeth and hated everything.

The time Finn forced her to have sex was the only time she did not take any precautions as she had completely forgotten about it when she met Edward and Candice the next day. Then, when she remembered it again, it was already past the emergency contraceptive period. However, she did not take it to heart because it was not a risky period in her cycle, so she thought she could avoid it. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the end, she got it. Was it true what they said about infertility on TV?

At that moment, Monica even thought of killing herself.

“Ms. Cardellini?” The doctor looked at Monica’s expression and could not help but call out to her.

Monica seemed to be so deep in her own thoughts that she did not hear what the doctor said at all.

“Can I have an abortion now?” Monica asked.

The doctor was stunned.

Brandon was also surprised by Monica. Although he was really on the verge of breaking down, Monica was pregnant.

Just when he thought he had some hope, Monica gave him a fatal blow, and he almost could not recover from it. Now that he finally accepted the fact that Monica was indeed pregnant with Finn’s child, Monica wanted to abort it.

He admitted that he was a little excited to hear her say that. After all, if Monica really aborted the baby, her relationship with Finn would be over. Once it ended, he and Monica were very likely to be together.

“Are you sure?” the doctor asked.

“Can you do it?” Monica did not answer the question directly.

“It can be done before 12 weeks. The smaller it is, the lower the risk fa you want to do it, my suggestion is to do it immediately,” the doctor professionally.

There was not much emotion in his tone. Moreover, they should be used to it.

“It’s just that…” The doctor looked at Monica. “You’re carrying twins.” Monica was struck with another blow. Brandon, too, felt that he was being attacked again and again.

“The ultrasound showed that there are two fetuses and that they’re developing normally,” the doctor said bluntly.

Monica really felt that nothing was more earth-shattering than that news. It was fine if she was hit once, but two at once? What the hell was going on?

Just how unlucky was she? Just how much did the heavens hate her to give her those two bombs?

“Ms. Cardellini, please consider it. After all, you’re not young anymore. If you wait for another two years to be pregnant, you’ll be older, and being pregnant at an older age is not good for you or the fetus. So, I suggest you think it through. And in Harken, the probability of having twins is one in a thousand. It’s really rare.” The doctor still tried to persuade her professionally.

Monica was silent. It was really difficult to make up her mind. If she abort it, she would be killing two lives.

Although she was not that soft-hearted now and was even a little too tough in the business world, she had never killed anyone since she was young. If she were to end two lives now… she was afraid that she would have to live with that burden for the rest of her life..
