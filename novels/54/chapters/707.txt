“What’s the situation now?” Kingsley did not seem to care too much.

“Fourth Master Swan was schemed against and has left without completing the deal.”

“Follow Fourth Master Swan,” Kingsley ordered.

“Yes.”

Lucy instructed the assassins hidden in the surroundings to follow Fourth Master Swan and left the site.

…

In the car, Nox looked at the black car behind him. “It should be those people who have been following us.”

Edward nodded.

“What should we do?”

“It’s settled.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

Then, he stepped on the accelerator and sped up.

The black car behind him also sped up to catch up with them.

The two cars sped along on the uneven road for a long time until the car in front suddenly stopped, and everyone in the car left.

The car behind arrived a few minutes later. When it saw the car stop, it also braked and quickly stopped.

“Ms. Harmon, their car has stopped,” an assassin in the car reported over the phone. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is anyone in the car?”

“I’ll go and make sure.”

“Be careful.”

“Yes.” The assassin ordered the people beside him to get out of the car and check on the situation of the car in front.

The assassin approached cautiously and then turned around to signal that there was no one in the car.

The assassin in the car reported hurriedly, “No one is in the car.”

“This place is so remote. There’s no way you can get out of the car and leave on foot, so don’t act rashly now. I’ll rush over immediately.”

“Yes.”

As soon as he finished speaking, gunshots suddenly sounded outside the car.

At the same time, the assassin who went to check if anyone was in the car was suddenly shot dead.

The assassin in the car hurriedly opened the car door and hid behind the car.

The surroundings of the car were now filled with the crackling sounds of gunshots firing one after another.

Lucy heard it on the other end of the phone, so she got the assassin who was driving to speed up.

However, no matter how fast they were, the two assassins who had been following Fourth Master Swan were dead when they arrived at the scene.

Lucy told everyone to be careful before raising her weapon and getting out of the car.

Just as she got out of the car, another burst of gunshots sounded.

Lucy quickly hid behind a car, and the others quickly followed.

Despite that, Lucy remained calm as she tried to listen to the sound of the bullets, trying to predict where the bullets would come from.

There were two people in the southeast direction, one in the southwest direction, and one in the north.

The people who had just left in Fourth Master Swan’s car were Fourth Master Swan, Nox, and two of his subordinates.

Fourth Master Swan and Nox should be together, so logically, they would be in the southeast direction.

If she captured the bandit, she would capture the king.

Lucy instructed the communicator, “Everyone, attack the southeast direction.”

“Roger.”

“On the count of three, K09 and Vermilion Bird will fire in that direction while K06 and I will approach under the cover of bullets.”

“Yes.”

“Three, two, one...”

Two black figures appeared from the car and quickly headed in the designated direction.

The moment they went over, they spotted two figures in the darkness.

Lucy and K06 quickly aimed at the two of them. “Bang! Bang!”

The bullets hit the two figures, and the two of them fell.

After that, Lucy and K06 carefully approached them in the darkness. However, at close range, they realized it was not Edward and Nox.

That meant the two independent people in the southwest and north were Edward and Nox.

Lucy’s expression was unsightly as she ordered, “Chase after them.”

However, only K06 responded to her.

Did that mean K09 and the Vermilion Bird had been killed?

The second Lucy and K06 looked at each other, a few gunshots suddenly rang in their ears. Without hesitating, Lucy and K06 ran in the direction of the gunshots.

The moment they caught up, Lucy suddenly paused for a second, thinking, ‘Can it be a diversion?’

In that split second, she made a prompt decision. “You can go ahead. I’ll go to the other side.”

K06 was surprised.

After Lucy gave K06 instructions, the latter immediately ran in the southwest direction.

At the same time, Nox stayed in contact with Edward as he ran forward. “I’ll distract them. Be careful.”

“You, too.”

Edward was also very fast.

Soon, they arrived at a hidden bush, where they found the motorcycle that they had put away in advance. He lifted it up and quickly got on it. Then, he stepped on the accelerator and left.

Lucy heard the sound of the engine and saw a figure speeding past, so she gritted her teeth and quickly chased after him on foot.

However, Edward’s motorcycle was going very fast.

The deal was just a smokescreen for him.

He had long received the news that the other party would kill him during that deal. He was merely taking advantage of the situation and using that deal to achieve his goal.
