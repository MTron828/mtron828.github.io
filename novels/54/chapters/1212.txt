1213 Nox Was Seduced By Shelly

It was an insult to him. Ever since he had a woman, he had never watched that kind of thing.

Now, what was playing on the television? Did Shelly watch that kind of thing every day?

That woman was a monster.

…

In the next room, Shelly sat in front of her desk. When she took out her homework, she glanced at the time.

Just like that, she had kept Nox company until 10 p.m.

In fact, as a high school senior, she was supposed to be self-studying at night, but she felt that since she was cultivating her relationship with Nox, she should be with more. Now that she thought about it, since Nox hated her so much, they might get along better if she did not hang out in front of him.

She took a deep breath and tried to focus on her studies. By the time she finished a set of exam questions, it was already 12 p.m.

She stretched her back and figured that Nox should be done with watching TV and had fallen asleep. Hence, she got up and went straight to Nox’s room.

As she pushed the door open, the video was playing for the second time.

Nox, on the other hand, was not asleep. However, instead of watching TV, he was staring at the door, seemingly waiting for her.

Of course, Shelly had calmed down. Just now, she was in a hurry to do her homework, and Nox kept finding fault with her. That was why she was angry.

Now, she pretended as if nothing had happened and went to turn off the TV. Then, she took the phone away and walked to Nox’s bedside to help him turn off the lamp.

Just as she was about to leave, someone suddenly grabbed her arm.

In fact, Shelly was prepared for Nox to fly into a rage. However, she felt her body being pulled onto the bed by Nox’s brute force. Before she could react, Nox flipped over and pressed her under him.

Shelly was still in shock.

She did not expect Nox to be so strong now. Moreover, the proficiency of the flip was completely different from when he had just been discharged.

She remembered that when Nox was sleeping, he would wake her up with his phone in the middle of the night to get her to turn him over. It was because he had slept in the same position for too long and it felt uncomfortable. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Nox pressed her down tightly.

Not all the lights in the room were switched off, and there was still a lamp on, emanating a faint light. Hence, at such a close distance, Shelly could see Nox’s furious expression clearly.

She bit her lip lightly and believed that she was about to be beaten by Nox because when Nox was angry, he would really hit her.

The moment Nox’s hand came close to her face, Shelly closed her eyes. She was prepared to be slapped.

However, at that moment, she suddenly felt a pair of lips pressed tightly against hers.

Shelly was stunned, and her mind suddenly went blank.

Was Nox not going to hit her? Why did he suddenly kiss her?

Moreover, he was kissing her deeply. In fact, she could feel his eagerness and his lack of control. Nevertheless, she endured Nox’s sudden violence and lay motionless under him.

Suddenly, Shelly felt a sharp pain on her lips. “Ow!”

She opened her eyes and looked at Nox, who was biting her lips ruthlessly. It was so painful that she frowned.

“Ow...” Shelly tried to push him away.

Nox’s bite was really too painful! She could even smell blood.

At that moment, Shelly also burst into tears. However, she did not push Nox away until he let go and looked at Shelly’s flushed, tear-stained face.

Shelly was clearly not a woman who would not make men lose their minds, but her current appearance suddenly gave him the urge to violate her.

He clenched his fists and held in that urge. Only then did he seem to have regained his rationality.

Then, she turned to Shelly. “Are you trying to seduce me?”

Shelly, who was overtaken by the pain on her lips, was suddenly jolted back to her senses by Nox’s voice, and she looked at him.

Was it because of the light shining on her teary eyes that made them look so clean, clear, and attractive?

Nox gritted his teeth and said, “Yes, I’m thinking about it now. That video of yours has made me miss women a lot. But Shelly, I’ll have you know that even if I die, I won’t do anything to you, and you can forget about me sleeping with you!”

Shelly hesitated and did not say anything.

In fact, he did not need to remind her how much he hated her because she knew.

“In that case, let me go.” Shelly looked very calm.

She did not do it to seduce him. She just found him annoying.

Even though at that moment, when Nox hugged her and kissed her, she was a little glad that she had unintentionally planted a willow tree.

Clearly, she was overthinking things. Nox was just taking revenge on her, and her mouth was numb from the pain.

Therefore, they were even.

However, Nox did not let go of her.

Just like that, he pressed her down firmly and stared at her. It was as if he wanted to kill her, and at that moment, Nox really wanted to kill Shelly.

As a normal man, when that desire was ignited and could not be released, it could really drive a person crazy.

There were so many times that he really wanted to rip Shelly’s clothes off, but then…

“Get lost!” Nox suddenly let go of Shelly, and she left.

Shelly could feel Nox’s anger, that kind of anger that could kill her in the next second. Hence, the moment Nox let her go, she wanted to run away.

The moment she made that move, Nox suddenly went back on his words. “Stop.”

Shelly turned around and looked at him.

Her clothes were already in a mess and torn apart by Nox because he could not control himself just now.

At that moment, Nox seemed to…

...

Nox really believed it had been so long since he had a woman that now even Shelly looked pretty.

“Just because I don’t f*ck you doesn’t mean I’ll let you go,” Nox said fiercely.

What was Nox going to do?

“Give me your hand!” Nox ordered.

Shelly hesitated for a moment before reaching her hand out.

What was Nox going to use her arm for?

While Shelly was in a daze, Nox grabbed her hand and put it under the blanket…

After that, Shelly’s entire face turned red!
