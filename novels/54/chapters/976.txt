977 Autopsy Result: It Was A Set-up

“I’ve got the autopsy results,” Jeanne said.

Monica’s heart raced.

Jeanne opened the report on her phone and placed it in front of Monica. “The child died from a high concentration of potassium cyanide injection.”

“Potassium cyanide?” Monica was shocked.

Although she had not worked at the company much, she had been exposed to drugs since she was young and had some knowledge about the more serious toxic ingredients. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ingesting 50 to 100 mg of that drug could cause sudden death. Death occurs with difficulty in breathing, increased blood pressure, bright red skin mucosa, convulsions, seizure, and finally, death by general muscle relaxation and respiratory and cardiac arrest.

It was a very painful death.

Jeanne looked at Monica and said, “It’s impossible for a vaccine to contain such a high dose of toxic ingredients.”

Monica came back to her senses and nodded. “Yes, that’s absolutely impossible. The only problem with the vaccine was that it was expired, and there was a problem with storage and transportation. However, that couldn’t have led to death from the vaccine. On the contrary, it just wouldn’t have had any effect. Another problem could be that the virus or bacteria extracted from the vaccine did not reduce its toxicity, causing the vaccine to produce a toxic reaction after it was inoculated.”

“So, we can completely rule out that it’s a problem with the vaccine and confirm that the child’s death was a set-up. To put it bluntly, when the child was injected with the vaccine, the staff replaced the vaccine with the highly toxic potassium cyanide. Once the child was injected with it, he died immediately!”

“In that case, the staff administered the injection…” Monica looked at Jeanne.

“That’s right. Finding that person is the key. Once we find him, we can then dig deeper.” Jeanne said, “This time, I must get some dirt on Michael. What you did last time ruined Michael’s reputation, but it only made him lose his honor on the surface. In fact, other than affecting his image, it didn’t affect his powers much. The Sanders need talents, and Michael was trained by the Sanders with so many resources. They can’t bear to give him up so easily, so although it seems like Michael has nothing now, he actually has a lot of power in secret, including his authority over the quality inspection department.”

At that moment, Monica was so angry that her body was trembling. “I really want to kill Michael! I can’t believe that to achieve his goal, he could kill a human being! I must expose him and bring him to justice!”

“However, the evidence we have now can only prove that there is no problem with the vaccine and that someone deliberately framed us. We can’t accuse Michael of being the cause of the child’s death. Michael is very careful with what he does. I’m worried that another scapegoat will appear when we’re trying to get dirt on him. If that happens, our efforts will be in vain. After all, Michael can easily make a comeback. If we don’t get rid of him, he will come back soon!”

“How can we find dirt on Michael and expose his crimes?” Monica gritted her teeth, but at that moment, she was still somewhat at a loss.

It was too difficult to get rid of Michael.

If Reese had not revealed Michael’s motives to her, she might not have known what kind of person Michael was!

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

Monica’s entire face turned red with anger.

At that moment, Jeanne could not think of a foolproof plan either, so she said, “Let’s find that staff member first and find out more about him.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

Deep down, she felt that Jeanne was awesome.

“Mason and I will investigate in secret. What you need to do now is to build up Cardellini Enterprise’s reputation.” Jeanne said, “Now that the problem with the vaccine has been solved, once we expose the real cause of the boy’s death, there will be no quality problems with the Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs. Next, it will depend on how you lead Cardellini Enterprise back on the right track.”

Monica quickly said, “Once there are no problems with our drugs, we will follow my father’s new product launch plan. There should be no problem with that.”

“It can’t be that simple.” Jeanne immediately rejected Monica’s idea.

Monica looked at her.

“Since Michael has done so much, he definitely won’t give you a chance to bring the company back to life. Of course, perhaps he didn’t expect us to get the evidence that the vaccine is fine, but I think this isn’t the only way for Michael to destroy Cardellini Pharmaceutical. Sunny Pharmaceutical is your biggest competitor right now, and this pharmaceutical company definitely has a powerful background. To be able to get all the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to accept their products in such a short time, I personally don’t think that it appeared out of thin air. It must have been planned long ago.”
