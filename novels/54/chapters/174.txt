Chapter 175: Is Fourth Master Swan Not Going to Interfere?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‘Fourth Master Swan?

‘How would I know where he is?!’

Moreover, Jeanne had just rejected Fourth Master Swan outright the night before.

After what happened to her yesterday, the first person who came to see her was Monica.

She knew Kingsley would come too.

Even so, Kingsley needed time to rush back from abroad, so he would be a little late.

As for Fourth Master Swan…

He had no reason to help her even though everything had started because of him.

“Fourth Master Swan can’t just let it be!” Monica looked at Jeanne’s expression, and she appeared exceptionally agitated.

“Monica, Fourth Master Swan and I only have a normal relationship. Now that I’ve offended the Sanders, it’s reasonable for him not to interfere. You have to know that Harken is still the world of the Sanders, and no one is willing to go against them.”

“Even if that’s the case, this matter was caused by Fourth Master Swan. Isn’t he afraid of being punished by the heavens if he just stands by and does nothing? Besides, doesn’t he like you? Shouldn’t liking someone mean that you should disregard everything?!” Monica said indignantly.

Sometimes, Jeanne really envied Monica’s innocence.

Monica would always consider whether she loved someone or not. She would not get it mixed up with other interests and schemes.

Jeanne said, “Monica, don’t interfere in my current matters.”

Monica was stunned, but she quickly looked triggered. “Jeanne, what kind of person do you think I am?!”

“Firstly, I can solve it. I won’t tell you how I’m going to solve this matter, but I’ll definitely walk out of here safely no matter what method I use! Secondly, our identities are different. In the end, you’re still the daughter of the Cardellini Enterprise. The Cardellini Enterprise is still a n enterprise of Harken. If you need to establish yourself in Harken, you can’t go against the Sanders. I don’t want to implicate your enterprise.”

“Jeanne, how are you still so rational?” Monica’s eyes were red again.

If she were to encounter such a situation, she would wish for everyone to help her.

How could Jeanne be so calm? How could she be so strong?!

“Monica.” Jeanne took the initiative to pull Monica’s hand.

Monica’s heart palpitated.

“You’re my best friend. I don’t want anything to happen to you because of me.”

“I don’t want anything to happen to you either...”

“I said that I can solve it. What you need to do now is to wait for me to go out safely.”

“How are you going to solve it? How are you going to solve it when it comes to the Sanders?!” Monica felt that Jeanne was giving her the runaround.

“You have to believe me!” Jeanne was very certain.

Her tone of affirmation was enough to make Monica believe her instantly.

It was clear that given the situation, Jeanne could not resist at all. Having said that, at this moment, Monica was convinced by Jeanne’s determination.

Her eyes were red, and she looked at Jeanne as though she was going to cry at any moment.

Jeanne smiled again. “Don’t worry, I won’t let anything happen to me again.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

At this moment, she could only nod.

“On the other hand...” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Was Micheal the one who helped you come to see me?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Right now, no one can interfere with your case. My dad can’t let me come to see you through his connections, so I could only find Micheal. Micheal also spent a lot of effort to let me come in to see you.”

“How’s your relationship with Micheal now?”

“You’re already like this, yet you still care about me. Can you care about yourself?”Monica was flustered.

At this time, Jeanne was still thinking about other things.

“I just want to remind you that Micheal and Melody have a good relationship.”

“I know,” Monica said, “They grew up together.”

“So, as long as Micheal talks to Melody, it won’t be difficult for you to come and see me.”

Monica blinked and looked at Jeanne.

She did not quite understand what Jeanne meant.

Jeanne did not say anything more.

She was not sure if Micheal had other intentions for Monica. She simply felt that him helping Monica to come and see her was more of an act.

Also, Jeanne did not know if Micheal was putting on an act just to win Monica over.

If so, she could understand if Micheal would occasionally use some kind-hearted methods because he loved Monica too much.

However, if it was more than that...

Jeanne always felt that Micheal had too many deep thoughts. She did not know if he was an enemy, but she was sure that they would never become friends.

“Monica.” Micheal suddenly walked into the meeting room.
