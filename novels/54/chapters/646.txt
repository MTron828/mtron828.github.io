Chapter 647: Can You Not Be So Cold to Me? It Scares Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He was not the kind of person who would simply attack someone, and nor was he an impulsive person!

Finn sneered. What kind of person was he?

Did Michael not want Monica to hate him? In that case, he would support their relationship.

He suddenly walked toward Michael again and punched Michael directly in the face.

Michael did not resist as Finn hit him harder and harder.

Monica could see that Michael’s face was swollen.

Some onlookers were standing beside them, but no one dared to stop Finn.

Monica could not stand it anymore and went over to pull Finn away. “Finn, what’s up with you today? Calm down. Stop hitting me.”

Finn did not seem to hear her.

To be honest, he had been suppressing himself for so long that he, too, wanted someone to vent his anger on.

Since there were no consequences to worry about, why would he not vent his emotions?

He punched Michael in the face again, beating Michael to the ground.

In the next second, Finn was going to kick him again when Monica suddenly leaned on Michael’s body and hugged him.

She just did not want to see Finn lose control like that.

The last time she saw him lose control like that, he was using his life to protect her. Just thinking about it now terrified her.

The kick Finn gave Michael landed on Monica’s body.

“Ah!” Monica cried out.

At that moment, her body was in so much pain that she thought was going to die.

Why was Finn kicking so hard?

That kick almost broke her soul.

“Monica, Monica, are you okay?” Michael was beaten up, but his face was filled with concern for her.

Monica gritted her teeth and could not bring herself to speak.

Finn looked at the two people in front of him. Then, he turned around and strode away.

Monica endured the pain and got up from the ground to rush to Finn.

The doctor said she could only walk a few steps at most, but she could not run.

She stood in front of Finn and said, “Finn, what’s wrong with you?”

“What do you want to say?”

“Why did you hit Michael? Can you not involve Michael in my relationship with you?” Monica said fiercely.

Finn smiled.

It was a cold smile, but it looked scary.

“Monica.” Finn suddenly bent down and pinched her chin with his slender fingers.

Monica’s heart clenched.

“If it weren’t for him, would we have broken up?” he asked her, enunciating each word.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She could feel the strength of Finn’s grip on her chin. It was so painful that tears flowed out of her eyes. She said, “He didn’t force me. I did it of my own free will.”

“That’s why I told you to stay away from me!” Finn pushed Monica away.

Monica fell two steps back, but Michael caught her in his arms.

Finn remained indifferent as he said, “I’ve done what you want. Don’t disturb me again!”

His words were clearly directed toward Michael. After he said that, he left, regardless of whether Monica’s heart was aching to death or not.

Monica’s tears fell like crazy.

Why did Finn become like that?

Michael looked at Finn’s silhouette, and his expression was a little ugly at that moment.

He did invite Finn out today, saying that he wanted to clarify their matters and that he did not want Monica to continue pestering him either.

Finn agreed, probably because he did not want anything to do with them anymore.

Hence, Michael met with Finn half an hour earlier than Monica.

The conversation between them was not pleasant.

Michael kept provoking Finn to attack him.

Finn was actually a very calm person and had already expected that. Therefore, Finn remained unmoved for half an hour. No matter what Michael said, he just looked at Michael coldly until Michael said, “Monica isn’t guarded against me. She doesn’t even know what I did to her body last night...”

Then, Finn punched him.

No matter how calm a man was, he would also lose control.

Coincidentally, he saw Monica coming at that moment and the obvious surprise on Monica’s face when she saw Finn.

He understood what Finn had said earlier.

Finn knew Michael was deliberately putting on an act for Monica to make her give up on him.

He saw through it but did not expose it. In fact, even if he did, with Monica’s trust in him, she would not believe what Finn said. However, what Michael did not expect was that Finn would cooperate. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It meant Finn had completely let go of Monica, and only Monica still hoped she could still be together with Finn.

In fact, no man would be able to stand it if his woman helped another man like that.

No matter how much he loved her, he would not.

What Michael was doing now was not to guard against Finn but to make Monica give up on Finn completely.

“Monica, I’m sorry. I saw you were very sad today, so I wanted to explain things between you and me to him in person. I didn’t expect him to be like this. I didn’t expect him to not be open to listening to my explanation.” Michael appeared to be very upset.

Monica knew Finn’s ego was very high, so he could never accept Michael’s explanation.

Besides, Finn did not even believe her. Why would he believe Michael?

All she felt now was sadness.

Finn could, without hesitation, abandon her time and time again!
