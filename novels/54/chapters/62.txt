Chapter 63: Ms. Lawrence, Don’t Play With Fire

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everyone in the banquet hall stared at the interaction between Jeanne and West with their mouths agape.

They never thought that the eldest young lady of the Lawrences would have anything to do with the godfather of international e-commerce.

In everyone’s mind, Jeanne was still that wild girl who did not know what she was doing. She was a delinquent daughter who was chased out of the house by her biological father! No one would think about what she had done or experienced during the seven years she was chased out. The only thing they knew was that Jeanne had given birth to an illegitimate child, one who was originally useless but turned out to be a genius!

Jeanne seemed to be too different from everyone’s impression at the moment!

West turned his head to look at Alexander, who was standing at the side. He said, “Mr. Lawrence, you’ve raised a good daughter.”

Alexander snapped back to reality.

At that moment, he seemed to have recovered from his shock.

He smiled stiffly. “Mr. West, you flatter me.”

“I’ve always been curious about what kind of parents could raise such an outstanding child, and I’ve wanted to seek advice and experience from you. My damned child is ignorant and incompetent. He’s really helpless,” West said sincerely.

When he said that, Alexander’s face became even stiffer.

He forced out a few words. “Jeannie is the one who’s obedient.”

One could see how awkward Alexander was. Did he sincerely feel that he did not have the qualifications to answer West’s question?!

Jeanne smiled indifferently at the side.

“Let’s have a good chat later.” West patted Alexander’s shoulder in a friendly manner and said, “Now, I’ll borrow your daughter and let her accompany me to meet the guests.”

“Please go ahead,” Alexander said quickly.

West smiled gratefully. He let Jeanne hold his arm and brought her to socialize with him.

Jenifer watched as they walked away. The emotions on her face could not be held back any longer. She could not help but say, “How did Jeannie hook up with West?!”

Alexander responded coldly, “How would I know?!”

When he thought about how Jeanne had embarrassed him, he felt angry.

“Could it be that… Jeannie and West did something shameful abroad…?” Jenifer said deliberately.

Alexander gave her a look.

Jenifer quickly said, “I was just saying.”

She was deliberately fanning the flames.

Alexander’s face turned completely dark at that moment.

…

At the banquet, West brought Jeanne to socialize with all the upper-class enterprises in South Hampton City.

West also made it very clear that MUK Group would bring their professional team to Harken into the e-commerce market in South Hampton City, but because they were not familiar with the local market, they would choose to cooperate with a local enterprise. To put it bluntly, they would find a partner in South Hampton City to develop the e-commerce platform together.

Once the news was out, all the enterprises in the city were in an uproar.

There were already some enterprises at the banquet that could not hold back and kept socializing with West, trying to deepen his impression of them.

Jeanne accompanied West for more than half the night. She finally broke away from the crowd and took some time to go to the washroom.

She had just come out of the washroom when she heard a man’s voice. “Are you very pleased with yourself?”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly, and she saw Eden standing not far away.

He was alone.

Where did he leave Jasmine?!

Jeanne smiled faintly. “Which are you referring to, Young Master Swan?”

Eden said sarcastically, “I didn’t expect that the eldest young lady of the Lawrences, who once didn’t even let anyone touch her hand, would accompany an old man for the sake of money and benefits.”

Jeanne’s face turned slightly cold.

“What? Did I hit a sore spot?” Eden sneered.

Jeanne was indifferent. “Young Master Swan, are you jealous?”

“Are you kidding?!”

Jeanne approached Eden and suddenly walked toward him.

Eden frowned slightly and maintained his vigilance, but he could not bear to take a step back.

Jeanne was almost stuck to his body, but she seemed to maintain a subtle distance. Her fragrance lingered in Eden’s breath, making him a little confused for a moment. He heard her melodious and sweet voice as she said with a heart-stirring voice, “In any case, you’ll never be able to touch me in your lifetime...”

Eden’s expression changed drastically, and he stared fiercely at Jeanne.

At that moment, anger burned in his heart, and he grabbed Jeanne’s arm fiercely.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Just as she was about to resist…

“Eden.”

Jeanne and Eden turned their heads abruptly.

The person who called Eden was not Jasmine, but... Nox. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Beside Nox was Edward.

Fourth Master Swan did not come to the banquet, but why was he suddenly here?!

How long had he and Nox been standing there?!

Eden let go of Jeanne abruptly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Eden walked straight toward Edward. He showed no reluctance towards Jeanne.

He stopped in front of Edward and said respectfully, “Fourth Uncle, you’re here.”

Edward took a look at Eden and nodded slightly.

“I’m leaving. Jasmine is still waiting for me outside.”

Edward still nodded.

Eden left.

At the same time, Nox also left.

It seemed that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were left behind on purpose.

Jeanne was a little speechless.

She rearranged her shawl. She became entangled with Eden just now, so it was a little messy.

After she was done, she walked past Edward.

“Ms. Lawrence,” Edward said, his voice was neither warm nor cold.

Jeanne pursed her lips and stopped.

Edward turned around and looked at her.

Jeanne raised her head and looked back.

She did not want to be outdone.

Edward suddenly stretched out his long arms and hugged Jeanne in her arms.

Jeanne was shocked and tried to push him away.

At that moment, Edward’s big hand was on her waist. It seemed to be exerting more force, making her unable to move.

Jeanne frowned.

She could clearly feel that Fourth Master Swan’s hand was on her exposed waist and not on her shawl.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and was about to speak.

Fourth Master Swan suddenly bent down and lowered his head.

Jeanne’s heart moved.

His lips brushed past her lips as if it was an illusion. He then moved toward her ear.

At this moment, Jeanne even thought that if Fourth Master Swan dared to kiss her, she would throw him over her shoulder..

However, she maintained her calm.

She only felt a wave of heat lingering around her ears.

“Ms. Lawrence, it’s best that you don’t play with fire,” Edward uttered with a threat and a hint of ambiguity. “I don’t have enough willpower.”

As he finished, he kissed Jeanne’s earlobe with his slightly cold lips.

It was only for a second.

Edward then let go of Jeanne and turned around to leave.

“Fourth Master Swan,” Jeanne called out to him.

Edward stopped in his tracks.

“Don’t forget that this is just a deal,”Jeanne reminded.

Edward did not give any reply and left.

‘Damn it!

‘B*stard.’

Jeanne took a deep breath. She forced herself to calm down and walked toward the banquet hall.

West was still in the crowd. When he saw Jeanne come out, he waved for her to go over.

Jeanne walked over.

West looked at Jeanne and suddenly smiled. “Why is your right ear so red?”

Jeanne was stunned.

West seemed to find it very interesting. He looked left and right. “Your left ear is fine, but your right ear is completely red. Is your right ear shy?!”

It was clearly a joke, but Jeanne was speechless.

She smiled and said, “I’m allergic to this earring.”

No.

She was just allergic to someone!
