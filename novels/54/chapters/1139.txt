1140 The War Has Started: Finn in Danger

Finn returned to his office.

He sat in his office chair and suddenly fell into a daze for a long time.

Too many things had happened recently that made him a little overwhelmed. However, he had to get over it quietly because he would then have to force himself to deal with a lot of things.

He pulled the drawer open and looked at the document in his hand. It was a list of the Sanders’ internal scandals that he had sorted out. Many of them had not been confirmed, but they were all facts.

He wondered if using the information he had could really put the Sanders in a dilemma and leave them no choice but to let Edward and Nox go.

It was obvious that he could not afford to make a single mistake. Once something went wrong, the situation might be beyond redemption.

He tried his best to keep calm.

There were some things that he really could not decide on his own, so after hesitating for a long time, he called Alex, the descendant of the Duncans.

In fact, he and Nox were not loyal to Alex. They were only loyal to Edward. In other words, if Alex and Edward were in danger at the same time, in the situation where they were not given orders, he and Nox would only protect Edward.

However, because Edward was loyal to Alex, Finn did not dare to make a decision easily when it came to many things that involved the Duncans.

The call was connected.

“Finn.” It was Alex’s voice.

“Are we just going to let the Sanders detain Fourth Master? Don’t you have a way to save them?” Finn asked.

He did not plan to tell Alex Edward’s plan for the time being.

“The Sanders has been very careful in this matter. I haven’t found any loopholes that could release Edward, Nox, and the others,” the other party said bluntly.

“Does that mean Fourth Master will have to stay in there until the Sanders think they can let him go?”

“You can say it that way.”

“Wouldn’t that have a huge impact on you?” Without Edward’s support, Alex had lost a helper.

“It does impact me a lot, but it’s not completely unacceptable. So far, what Edward has left for me is enough for me to go against the Sanders. It’s just that without him, I need to be more careful.” Alex’s voice was cold. “Of course, everything I said just now about being able to do without Edward is on the premise that things go well and the Sanders don’t make any big moves. In reality, what the Sanders is doing now is making it difficult for me.”

“What do you mean?” Finn frowned.

Alex seemed to have no intention of hiding it from Finn. He trusted Edward, so he naturally trusted everyone around Edward.

He said, “The Sanders are now investigating my whereabouts.”

“They still haven’t given up?”

After so many attempts, they still had not given up. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“They’ve rearranged the guest list for Michael and Monica’s wedding and began to check them one by one. Although the workload is heavy and the progress won’t be too smooth, they will eventually find me, and it’s very likely that I will be forced to reveal my flaws.” Alex said, “Especially since I’m the closest to him now. Once the Sanders suspects me, I’ll be in great danger.

Alex was different from the others, AND The first thing he had to consider was his safety.

Of course, Finn knew, so he was not surprised.

“And now that I’m already part of the Sanders, I can’t easily leave. If I do anything unusual, I believe Jeanne will suspect me very soon,” Alex said with certainty.

“Jeanne?” Finn frowned.

“Yes, everything was Jeanne’s plan, including capturing Edward and how to find me. And she’s smarter than I thought. I have to say that she’s a threat to me.”

Finn fell silent.

Did that mean Jeanne and Edward have really become enemies?

Because Finn had not participated in many of their missions and tasks, the information that Alex gave him at that moment was really a little too much.

“What do you plan to do?” Finn asked.

“Threaten Jeanne.” He enunciated each word.

Finn gripped his phone tightly.

He felt that Edward would not want to do that.

“According to the current situation, it’s only a matter of time before I’m found out. I still have a very important part to complete, and I can’t guarantee that I can complete it before the Sanders confirm my identity. Thus, I must fight for more time to ensure that I can escape unscathed.”
