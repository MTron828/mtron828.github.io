Chapter 320: Set a Date for the Wedding

“Although George is six years old, he has little to do with you,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“Whether it has anything to do with me or not, I know very well.”

Jeanne did not know what else to say.

“Ms. Lawrence, don’t worry.”

Thus, she could not fool Fourth Master Swan.

When the two of them were almost at the door to Bamboo Garden, Jeanne said, “Fourth Master, I still have some work matters to take care of, so I won’t go in with you…”

“I’ll drive you there.”

Jeanne thought, ‘If you want to drive me there, go ahead.’

With that, Jeanne sat in Fourth Master Swan’s luxurious car.

The two of them did not talk much.

Jeanne sometimes did not know what to say to Fourth Master Swan, while Fourth Master Swan usually found it hard to be the first to speak.

Fortunately, the car arrived at Lawrence Enterprise’s building very quickly.

Jeanne got out of the car and was about to thank Fourth Master Swan when she saw that Fourth Master Swan had already gotten out of the car.

......

Jeanne was stunned.

The next second, Fourth Master Swan held her hand and led her straight into the Lawrence Enterprise’s Hall.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Just like that, she followed Fourth Master Swan, and they both walked into the elevator.

“Which floor?” Edward asked while placing his slender finger on the elevator button.

Jeanne came back to her senses. “13th Floor.”

Edward pressed the number 13.

Jeanne was on the verge of breaking down. She really found Fourth Master Swan... very difficult to grasp.

It was late at night. Did she really have to work overtime with him?!

She did not react and tried her best to remain calm as Fourth Master Swan led her out of the elevator. Then, the two of them walked into her office.

“I might be a little late, Fourth Master–”

“You don’t have to worry about me.” Edward interrupted her.

Jeanne pursed her lips, thinking that he was really not easy to deal with.

She said, “Fourth Master, you can sit wherever you like while I get my work done.”

Edward nodded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Then, he sat on the sofa at the side, leaned back, and took out his phone quietly.

Jeanne glanced at him. His presence made her feel very uncomfortable.

However, seeing that the guy had no intention of leaving and that she had an appointment with MUK Group tomorrow to discuss the project’s progress, she could only force herself to bite the bullet and throw herself into her work.

The office was very quiet.

Just then, someone gently knocked on the door of her office.

Amy had gone out for supper and then came back to work overtime. She knew Director Lawrence’s way of working and figured the latter would come back to work at night. Hence, Amy came back after her meal, thinking she would wait for Director Lawrence when she saw the light in Director Lawrence’s office was on. At that, she quickly made a cup of coffee and went in.

The moment she entered, she froze.

The handsome man sitting on the sofa was... Fourth Master Swan!

Was he really the legendary Fourth Master Swan?!

It was just too handsome.

She did not even blink as she stared at him sitting on the sofa and so lazily at that. However, there was something about him that she could not take her eyes off him.

“Amy.” Something flashed in Jeanne’s eyes, and her tone sounded off.

Amy quickly came back to her senses.

Oh no.

She was too engrossed in looking at the handsome guy just now. The point was, the handsome guy in front of her was her boss’s... lover?!

More importantly, Director Lawrence usually would not lose her temper with her, but the former was obviously angry at her now.

Oh no. She was done for.

She quickly put the coffee in front of Director Lawrence and stood in front of her awkwardly.

“Fourth Master, would you like some coffee?” Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan, who was sitting on the sofa.

“Don’t worry about me.” Fourth Master Swan’s eyes had been on his phone the entire time. Just who was he talking to now?

His slender fingers were jumping on the screen.

“You can go out,” Jeanne ordered.

“Yes.” Amy quickly left.

In the office, Jeanne drank the coffee while taking a break to relax her mind.

Then, her eyes fell on Fourth Master Swan.

Just now, Amy...

It was not Amy’s fault but Master Yan’s. He was too famous.

“I’m not interested in any woman other than you, Ms. Lawrence,” the man, who was on his phone, suddenly said.

Jeanne quickly averted her gaze.

Did he have a third eye?

Jeanne pretended as if nothing happened and continued to drink her coffee.

“Ms. Lawrence, you don’t need to be jealous.” Edward put down her phone and looked at him.

Jealous?! How could he tell that she was jealous?

How arrogant of him!

Jeanne ignored him.

She drank her coffee and focused her attention on her computer screen. While looking at her half-written proposal, she was thinking about what she should write next.

At that moment, her body suddenly tensed up as she saw Fourth Master Swan walk up to her and take the remaining half cup of coffee from her hand.
