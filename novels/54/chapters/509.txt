Chapter 510: The Plot Begins, Monica Admits to Her Mistake

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next day, Monica was woken up by the alarm clock.

During this period of time that she had been with Finn, all she did was eat, sleep, and repeat. She had no concept of time at all. Other than having breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day, she probably did not know if it was morning or afternoon.

She pressed the alarm clock groggily, turned around, and glanced at Finn, who was sleeping beside her.

Seeing that he was still in a deep sleep and she did not want to disturb him, she carefully lifted the blanket and got out of bed. Then, she went to the bathroom to wash up.

After washing up, she leaned on her crutches and prepared to leave.

However, her eyes wandered back to Finn sleeping there again, and it was very tempting.

That was when she decided she could not care less anymore and went over. Without even thinking about it, she planted a kiss on Finn’s lips.

Finn frowned a little.

He did not open his eyes, but he felt a kiss on his lips.

How could that woman be so good at kissing? Who was the one who trained her so well?

At the thought of Monica and Michael…

When Monica was satisfied with her kiss and was about to leave, someone suddenly held the back of her head down. To Monica’s surprise, the kiss deepened into a hotter one.

......

F*ck.

Finn was pretending to be asleep.

Monica hugged Finn’s neck with both hands. Under Finn’s initiative, she became even more proactive.

From time to time, the sound of kissing could be heard in the room…

After a long time, their lips finally parted.

Finn was also quite good at kissing, so why was he pretending to be innocent in front of her?

The two of them hugged each other for a while.

Once Finn calmed down, he reminded her, “Aren’t you leaving yet?”

Only then did it strike Monica that she had to leave, and she hurriedly left Finn’s embrace.

If it was almost 8 a.m. after she washed up, Michael should be waiting downstairs for her since the two of them had been kissing for a long time.

She said, “I’ll see you later.”

Finn nodded, and Monica flashed a smile at him.

As if she was reluctant to leave, she bent down again to kiss Finn on the lips, or a peck, to be more precise.

Finn’s body tensed up.

Monica said, “I’ll be back.”

Finn could sense that there was a hidden meaning in Monica’s words.

After that, Monica left reluctantly.

She did not know when, but she had always wanted to be with Finn, and she would never get tired of him.

She walked out of the ward with a smile on her face.

When she was at the door to the ward, she paused for a moment because she saw Michael.

She thought Michael would wait for her at the hospital entrance. Unexpectedly, he was here, waiting at the door to the ward.

Michael saw the sweet smile on her face and her swollen lips and thought, ‘Monica... must love Finn very much.’

After all, he had never seen her act like that in all the years they had been together. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A cold glint flashed in Michael’s eyes.

He said, “I was afraid it would be inconvenient for you to walk, so I came up.”

As Michael explained, he did not take the initiative to approach her. He also kept a little distance from her, making her feel respected.

Monica smiled. “Thank you.”

“I should be the one thanking you,” Michael said sincerely.

“It’s nothing.”

Michael smiled. “Let’s go.”

“Okay.”

Monica limped slowly.

Meanwhile, Michael followed Monica’s side and did not get close to her. He just stayed by her side, as if he was protecting her, for fear that she would fall.

In the hospital car park, Michael opened the door to the passenger seat for Monica.

Monica held onto the door as she got in.

Michael, on the other hand, helped put her crutches in the back seat instead of taking the initiative to help her. He just watched as she struggled to sit down.

After Monica sat down, she felt let out a breath of relief.

Fortunately, Michael did not help her.

She was actually afraid of Michael getting close to her. After all, she did not want to touch anyone except for Finn. However, if Michael helped her out of kindness, it would be hard for her to refuse.

However, Michael was a true gentleman who was very considerate of others.

For that, Monica felt relieved.

Once Michael was in the driver’s seat, he started the car and drove to the private hospital his father was in.

As the car drove on the street, Michael took the initiative to ask amidst the silence. “Have you had breakfast?”

“I’m not hungry.”
