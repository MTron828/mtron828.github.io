1091 Neither of Them Needed The Other Anymore

Could it be that she knew Finn was coming, so she came?

“You’re here because of me, so I came and pick you up.”

Nox was speechless and thought he was overthinking it.

“Are you done with the procedures?” Finn asked, directly changing the topic.

“It’s done. We can go now.” Nox quickly said, “I don’t want to stay in this place for a second longer!”

“In that case, let’s go,” Finn urged.

With that, Nox left with Finn.

Monica, on the other hand, followed behind them calmly.

When they arrived at the parking lot, Monica got into the car and watched Nox and Finn leave together.

In fact, from the moment she saw Finn’s car, she knew that Nox did not need her to pick him up. She just wanted to feel reassured that at least Nox was in a good state of mind and did not lose an arm or a leg.

She started the engine, stepped on the accelerator, and was about to drive away when she saw Finn leaving and Nox walking over.

Monica frowned and pressed the unlock button.

Nox casually sat in the passenger seat of Monica’s car.

A little surprised, Monica turned to look at Nox. “Do you want me to send you back?”

“Didn’t you come to send me back?” Nox was speechless.

Monica was at a loss for words.

“Let’s go. Send me home. The days inside are really unbearable.” Nox despised it a lot.

Monica was really amused by Nox sometimes.

With that, she smiled and nodded.

At the same time, a smile appeared on Finn’s face again.

When he drove away from Monica’s car, he saw Monica smiling at Nox.

Monica, of course, did not notice that Finn had left as she drove Nox back seriously.

As the car drove on the road, Nox said, “I heard Michael has been sentenced to death.”

“Yes.” Monica nodded emotionlessly.

“He was executed this morning.”

“And Reese jumped off the building,” Monica added.

Nox was still a little surprised.

However, at that moment, Monica was extremely calm.

“I’ll return the 1 billion you gave me later.” Monica said, “Thank Fourth Master for me.”

“Do you think that money belongs to Edward?” Nox smiled.

“Isn’t it?” Monica mumbled, “If not, it’s Jeanne’s.”

Nox thought that it would be better for her to find that out herself.

“I still need the 1 billion now, so I’ll pay it back later with interest.”

“As you wish.” Nox did not care.

It was not his money anyway.

The two of them chatted along the way. Then, Monica drove into Nox’s neighborhood. When they were at the traffic light in front of the neighborhood, Monica did not seem to notice the change in the traffic light. She was about to run the red light and hit a little girl running on the pedestrian road when Nox shouted at her, “Monica! Brake!”

Monica suddenly came back to her senses and slammed her foot on the brakes.

There was a loud screech as the car braked, and at that moment, Monica saw the little girl standing in front of her car. If she were to go any further, she would definitely crash into the girl.

The little girl’s parents hurriedly held her tightly in their arms. The moment they held her, they scolded Monica.

Monica also seemed afraid at that moment.

However, she took a deep breath, and instead of responding to the couple cursing her, she silently accepted their accusations.

Fortunately, the traffic light was fast, and they were on the main road. The little girl’s parents cursed for a while before they carried the little girl away. Monica also restarted the car and left.

Nox looked at Monica and saw that her expression did not change. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Finally, they arrived at the entrance of his neighborhood.

“When are you free to have dinner together? It’s my treat,” Monica asked him.

However, Nox just stared at her.

“What’s wrong?” Monica frowned. “Why are you so against me treating you to a meal?”

“Monica, don’t take depression lightly.” Nox enunciated each word.

Monica pursed her lips.

It turned out that Nox knew.

Hence, she said, “Alright.”

“Taking medicine alone is useless. I suggest you go to a proper hospital and find a proper doctor for treatment.”

“Okay.”

“I’m not joking with you.” Nox was serious.

...

“I know.” Monica nodded.

Nox still wanted to say something, but he felt that whatever he said, Monica would agree. He did not know if she really agreed, but he felt like he might be wasting his breath.
