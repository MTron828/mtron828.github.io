Chapter 208: Non-stop Reversals and Climaxes

“Will the delivery price of Sunrise Company change frequently?”

“There will be changes. According to the actual situation of the market, there will be some changes.”

“Will the changes be very big?”

“Sometimes.”

“Now, I have a report in front of me. Can you show me which ones are off?”

“Sure.”

Judah showed the report to Deric.

After reading it, Deric said clearly, “The parts with red circles are indeed off.”

“What’s the problem?”

“There are obvious differences in the price of the goods. The prices are all our previous prices. I’ve looked at the date. The prices on that day have long been adjusted. Once our company adjusts the prices, unless our boss approves them with his signature, we’re not allowed to have such large price fluctuations.”

“Then, do you have any impression that these orders have been approved by your boss?”

“No, and I’m sure they haven’t been approved. All the lists that need to be changed can only be completed through me. I haven’t applied for this.”

“Do you have evidence for each adjustment of the price list?” Judah asked.

“Yes.”Deric nodded. “Once our prices go up or down, there’ll be an internal letter from our company. I’ll execute the changes once I receive the letter. This is a price adjustment letter from our company on the same date. It has our boss’s signature and stamp.”

Judah took it, looked at it a few times, and handed it to a staff member.

The staff member passed it to the trial bench and the judge.

“Finally, I have one more question,” Judah said.

“Okay.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Normally, will you inform your partners about the price adjustments?”

“We’ll send a separate letter to inform them.”

“May I ask if you’ve ever informed your partner, Tenda Planning and Construction Company, of any changes?”

“Yes.”

“Do you have any proof?”

“I have a screenshot of our email.” As he spoke, Deric took out his phone and showed the screenshot to Judah.

After Judah looked at it, he handed it over to the trial bench.

“Okay, thank you, Mr. Wright.”

Judah turned around.

He looked at Tenda. “So, Mr. Wadler, even though the prices have been adjusted, you still split the profit with Ms. Lawrence according to the profit from the original prices. What’s the reason?”

“I-I...” Tenda was a little speechless.

He did not even write the bill of accounts himself.

Tenda remembered that he did give Adrian a copy of Sunrise Company’s quotation, and it was indeed the previous one. He did not notice that the prices had been adjusted, and it was not his money anyway. He just took the bill from his account, and he did not need to check the details.

Moreover, Adrian requested that no one else knew about this. He had tampered with the finances himself. With so much money involved, how could he have time to check everything in detail? He only wanted to make sure that they were about the same!

“Please answer my question, Mr. Wadler,” Judah urged Tenda.

Tenda looked at Judah and stammered, “My literacy level isn’t high, and I can’t do the accounts well, to begin with. Besides, I read the accounts myself. Just in case, I-I didn’t check everything in detail...”

“Mr. Wadler, it’s true that your literacy level isn’t high and that you can’t do the accounts. However, you’re doing business at a loss, yet you didn’t even calculate the profit value clearly. This is probably not a mistake that a business person like you would make. Or could it be that this account wasn’t handled by you at all, Mr. Wadler?!”

“I might not have noticed the prices at that time...”

“You didn’t notice the prices? Tenda Planning and Construction Company overspent on the purchase prices, but you didn’t know, Mr. Wadler?”

“I didn’t have time to check. Jeanne was in a hurry to get the money, so I called her directly...”

“Mr. Wadler. If I remember correctly, you just said that you didn’t tell my client about the transfer of the money. My client didn’t even care about the details of the transfer. Why would she ask you to transfer the money to her immediately?!”

“No, I was afraid that if the money was already in my account but I didn’t give it to Jeanne, she would be resentful. That’s why I was worried,” Tenda explained.

It was obvious that he was lying.

Judah also did not want to waste his time on Tenda.

He turned around and said respectfully to the judge, “Your Honor, from Mr. Wadler’s confession, we seriously question the authenticity of it! I have reason to suspect that this account wasn’t done by Mr. Wadler himself. It was someone else who helped him prepare it and used it as evidence to frame my client.”
