1160 Edward, I’m Pregnant

“Yes.” Mason received the order.

Suddenly, he stepped on the accelerator, causing the people in the car to sway a few times.

As for the car behind, it started to accelerate crazily. Now, a few cars were driving madly on the street.

Jeanne gripped the handle tightly to endure Mason’s crazy driving. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The car behind them was also in hot pursuit. One of the cars rushed past the other cars beside Jeanne and was about to crash into them. If Jeanne did not let go of Edward, that car would take her down with it!

Mason’s speed increased. It was so fast that the car seemed to be starting to drift. It was obvious that the sedan was on the verge of losing control.

The car behind them chased them all the way.

They were in a stalemate.

Edward suddenly picked up his phone. “Nox.”

Nox answered the call and ordered the driver, “Chase after it. If it doesn’t stop, f*cking knock it away! F*ck!” He was extremely angry at Jeanne for going back on her word.

It had been agreed when they were all released. However, in the end, she took Fourth Master Swan away.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

“Nox.”

“Don’t worry, Fourth Master Swan. Even if I take you down with me, I won’t let Jeanne threaten you…”

“Stop the car,” Edward ordered.

“Sir!”

“I told you to stop the car! Stop chasing!”

“Jeanne agreed to let you go?”

“No. I’m following her.”

“Are you crazy? Do you want to die? Won’t Warren shoot you to death if he sees you?”

“Don’t worry. They still have a bigger use for me. They won’t kill me.”

“I’m worried.”

“Nox!” Edward’s voice was clearly much colder.

“Are you really going to throw away your life for Jeanne? Do you really want to die?” Nox broke down. He was devastated. How was Jeanne worth Edward’s sacrifice?

“I know what I’m doing. Stop the car now.”

Nox was extremely angry. However, he had no choice but to obey Edward’s orders.

He said to his men, “Stop the f*cking car! Now!”

The subordinate was stunned.

He quickly braked.

Due to the speed, the car almost flipped over. With another drift, the car barely came to a stable stop.

After stopping, Nox saw the car in front of him disappear at lightning speed. Nox was so angry that he smashed the car window.

F*ck!

Don’t let him catch Jeanne, or he won’t hesitate to beat her to death!

…

On the street, a black car gradually slowed down.

After making sure no more cars were following them, the car returned to its normal speed and drove steadily toward the Sanders’ mansion.

It remained silent in the car. Perhaps no one really knew what to say.

When the car stopped at the main entrance of the Sanders’ mansion, Edward followed Jeanne in. Once he walked in, there was no way of knowing if he would walk out alive!

Jeanne brought Edward back to her room, with Mason following the two.

She randomly picked a set of clothes. “Go and take a shower.”

Edward looked at her.

“After being in prison for so long, I’m sure you’d love to take a nice warm shower.” Although it was a high-security prison equipped with a bathroom, it would definitely not have been very comfortable.

Edward glanced at Jeanne before heading to the bathroom.

When the bathroom door closed, Jeanne left the room with Mason. Though, there were a few guards left standing at the door.

She went to Warren’s study and found that he was the only one there. Chester, who was always by Warren’s side, seemed to have left to deal with some matters.

“Father,” Jeanne said respectfully.

“You’ve never failed in anything I’ve entrusted you with.” Warren could not hide his smile.

Jeanne only replied with a faint smile, accepting his affirmation.

Warren also understood Jeanne’s character and knew she did not like to reveal too much of her emotions. However, she was more reliable than anyone else.

He had originally thought that she was just a chess piece. However, now he realized that she was more than one.

“What do we do next?” Warren asked her.

“Now, we deal with whatever comes our way. We shouldn’t do anything for the time being. Just wait for the other party to walk into our trap.”

“Alright.” Warren agreed. He would set up an inescapable net and wait for the Duncans to come to him!

“Jeannie, if we successfully take down the descendant and remaining members of the Duncans, I’ll give credit to you first. Think about what you want me to give you. Say the word, and I’ll agree!” Warren said heroically.

...

Jeanne smiled. He could not afford to give her what she wanted.

She said, “Thank you in advance, father.”

“You must be tired. Go back and rest early.” Warren was extremely gentle.

“Okay.”

“Oh, right.” Warren did not forget to remind her. “With Edward by your side, you have to be careful.”

“I know.” Jeanne nodded.

“Go on, then.”

As soon as she walked out of the study, she saw Chester walking toward her.

“Brother.” Jeanne greeted respectfully.

“I heard you brought Edward back to the Sanders’ residence.”

“Yep.” Jeanne nodded.

...

“As expected, you didn’t let father and I down.”

“Thank you, brother.”

“By the way, you just came out of father’s study. Did you have any important arrangements?” Chester asked.

“I didn’t,” Jeanne said. “I don’t have any plans for the time being.”

“How can that be? We’re in a good position now.”

“I really didn’t.” Jeanne did not seem to be lying.

While Chester did not believe her, he knew that he could not ruin his relationship with Jeanne. So he left it as that and did not force her.

He said, “Since you don’t have one, go and rest early.”

“Okay.”

With that, Jeanne left.

Chester stared coldly at Jeanne’s back before walking back into his father’s study.

“Father, we’ve successfully suppressed the news questioning our family.” Chester was clearly asking for credit.

Warren glanced at Chester. “It was all thanks to Jeanne.”

The smile on Chester’s face instantly turned awkward.

The next second, he immediately agreed. “Yes. Jeanne’s ability is indeed beyond my imagination.”

Warren nodded. He acknowledged Qiao ran once again.

“By the way, father, do we have any plans for the future? We’re in a good situation now, so we should make some moves.” Chester changed the subject.

“I don’t have any plans.” Warren smiled sinisterly.

Chester frowned.

“I’ve been a little tired these past two days. Hopefully, I can finally have a good night’s sleep today. I’ll go and rest for a while too.” Warren then left the study. It looked very perfunctory.

After he had left, Chester’s expression turned extremely ugly.

Were Warren and Jeanne planning something behind his back?

…

When Jeanne returned to her room, Edward was not around.

She headed for the bathroom and opened the door, revealing Edward shaving in a bathrobe. He was shaving off his beard, which was a little long.

Jeanne stood at the door, watching Edward’s actions, and stared for a long time.

“You can help me,” Edward said to her through the mirror.

Jeanne returned to her senses and said, “I’m afraid I’ll scratch you.”

“It’s fine. The wound is mostly healed.” Edward’s tone was indifferent.

Jeanne’s heart suddenly ached.

The wound was almost healed...

He had been more than seventy to eighty percent injured by her.
