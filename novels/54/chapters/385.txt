Chapter 386: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

Yes. If Finn died, he would have erased the orphan of the Duncans.

No. Even if Finn were an insignificant person, the President would not pursue the matter with him for the sake of such a person!

However…

His expression was extremely cold.

The person next to Michael said respectfully, “Mr. Ross, what should we do now?”

After all, Michael was still sensible.

He ordered coldly, “Copy the video from before and send it to the Sanders’ residence. Finn is just an ordinary person.”

“Yes.”

Michael then stood up from his chair.

Finn’s injuries were so serious that he might not be able to survive anyway!

At the warehouse, the man who fired the shot had already approached Finn and Monica. He squatted down and removed the black mask on his face.

He said, “I’m Miles, Jeanne’s man.”

Monica’s eyes moved slightly, and she remembered him. The man was George’s chauffeur.

......

“It took me some time to find you,” Miles said bluntly.

It had indeed taken some time since he received Kingsley’s order.

Monica’s eyes were bloodshot.

“I’ll send you to the hospital.” Miles had put away his pistol.

Without wasting any more time, he stretched out his hand to pull Finn up.

He used a little strength but could not lift the man in front of him at all. Hence, he exerted a little more strength and a little more…

Having also noticed it, Monica hurriedly said to Finn, “Let go of me, Finn. Let go now. We’re saved. We’re saved.”

However, Finn seemed to have lost his hearing.

Lost his hearing… Was he dead? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

No.

Monica was so frightened that her face turned pale.

She kept wriggling her body around and telling Finn with tears in her eyes, “Let go of me. Someone is here to save us. It’s Jeanne’s man. We’re safe. Those who kidnapped us are all dead. Let go of me now...”

Monica kept telling him they were safe, but he still could not hear her.

Even though he could not hear her, his entire body was hugging her tightly and instinctively in his arms to protect her.

“Finn, what should I do? What should I do... I don’t want you to die. I don’t want you to die...” Monica broke down, crying.

She had always thought that Finn did not love her.

She had always thought Finn could not wait for her to stay away from him.

Yet today, why did he have to do all that for her?

She would rather Finn be the same old Finn, who was cold and looked down on her.

She would rather hide her thoughts and secretly love him. She would always love him!

She would rather not get a response from him, but she did not want him to die.

What on earth should she do?

She looked at Finn, whose face she could no longer see clearly, but her lips were close to his.

All she could taste was blood.

She said, “Finn, if you die, I will die with you, and we will be buried together.”

As soon as she said that, she seemed to be able to feel Finn moving a little.

It was just a very, very subtle movement. However, Monica could feel that he still had a little bit of consciousness left.

She looked nervously at the man in front of her, and his eyes seemed to move.

He did not speak as he probably could not say a word, but his body softened a little before he suddenly let go of her.

The moment he let go, Miles had already picked Finn up from the ground.

Miles had seen too many living and dead people, but he had never seen a person who was alive but dead at the same time. Therefore, he did not know if the man could still be saved.

However, he had received orders to save those two people, so he had to send them to the hospital immediately.

He moved very fast and said to Monica behind him, “Can you keep up?”

“Yes.” Monica got up from the ground.

She bit her lip and struggled to get up from the ground.

Her bones were probably fractured because she could feel a piercing pain with every step she took. Despite that, she dared not waste any more time for fear of delaying Finn from getting medical attention.

She quickly got into Miles’s car.

By then, Finn had been placed in the back row. He laid there, his body covered in blood, completely still.

Miles drove very fast.

As he drove, he took off his clothes and handed them to Monica. “Put them on first.”
