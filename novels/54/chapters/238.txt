Chapter 239: Fourth Master Swan Teased Jeanne Back at the Banquet

“Do you need me to attend?” Jeanne was in high spirits.

She had never seen her son with other children before, so she was still a little excited when she thought about it.

“The thing is that I would need my dead father to attend. I can’t dig him out of his grave, can I?” George’s little face was wrinkled like a bun. “How worrying.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh out loud.

Nonetheless, she was also very glad that George’s attitude toward this was so good.

Most children from single-parent families would probably feel inferior. George only felt that it was a little difficult.

“It would be fine if Kingsley didn’t leave. He could pretend to be my dad.” George continued to be sad.

“Don’t worry.” Jeanne rubbed her son’s curly hair. “If the event doesn’t require both parents to participate in it, such as a relay for moms only or dads only, I can play both roles. If both parents have to participate at the same time, let’s ask Miles to do it.”

George nodded. “That’s all we can do.”

“Just be prepared to win.” Jeanne was confident. “Hurry up and get up. I’ll accompany you to practice long-distance running.”

“...”

George originally only liked to sit in front of the computer, typing away.

…

Jeanne accompanied George to exercise in the morning.

At night, she went to the banquet hall with the Lawrences.

Tonight, Jeanne wore a one-shoulder black gown, revealing one side of her collarbone and shoulder. Under the light, her skin was fair and delicate as if it was tinted with a layer of diamond-like glow. In the middle of the gown, there was a thin white diamond belt, which made her thin waist appear exceptionally seductive. The skirt of the gown was very long. Despite her eight-centimeter high heels, it could almost sweep the floor. There was also a middle split from the middle of her thighs, making her look sexy.

Jeanne was very beautiful. She was the kind of beauty that could make people gasp in amazement at first glance. Her beauty was also a little too ostentatious. Others would think that she was wearing heavy makeup even if she had only casually put on some simple makeup. Not to mention, she was meticulously dressed today. She was so beautiful that it was soul-stirring.

That was why there was a second of silence when she just walked into the banquet hall.

Everyone was stunned by that woman who had suddenly appeared.

Actually, everyone knew that Jeanne was good-looking. Nevertheless, every time she appeared, it would still make people’s eyes lit up. They could not help but sigh and wonder how she could be so good-looking!

Alexander brought the Lawrences and walked directly toward Gary.

“Gary, happy birthday.” Alexander took the initiative to extend his hand to wish Gary.

Gary hurriedly shook his hand. “Thank you, thank you.”

The two of them exchanged formalities.

At this moment, Eden’s family also came.

Eden’s father, Henry, brought his family over. Jasmine also obediently followed Eden’s side.

The moment Jasmine saw Jeanne and her good looks, her expression became a little unsightly.

She was standing beside Jeanne, so he deliberately pulled Joshua to stand between them.

Such a small action was noticed by Monica, who was standing across from her with a stiff smile.

Every time Monica saw through Jasmine’s trick, she felt that it was very funny.

Sometimes, she did not understand how blind Eden must be to choose Jasmine over Jeanne!

“Monica,” Finn suddenly called out to her softly from the side.

Monica came back to her senses.

Tonight, due to special reasons, she had to appear in front of everyone with Finn’s arm in her hand. They had to act lovingly.

God knew how devastated Monica was when she held Finn’s arm.

She turned to look at Finn.

“Uncle Swan is calling you,” Finn reminded her.

Monica quickly smiled and greeted Henry politely, “Uncle Swan.”

“You and Finn have been married for so many years. When are you going to have a baby? Your dad will be happy to have a grandchild.”

Monica was most annoyed by these so-called elders. They would either ask about grades or jobs, whether one was in a relationship or married, and if one had a child if one was married! If one already had a child, they would then ask when one would have a second child!

How annoying.

Monica controlled her emotions and responded, “My parents are still young. They’re only 50 years old. If they already have a grandchild. won’t that affect them??What about you, Uncle Swan? Are you hoping that Eden and Jasmine will give you a big, fat grandchild?”

Henry could not help but laugh. “It’s up to the young people. Of course, they make their own decisions.”

‘Then why are you asking me?!’

Monica was speechless.

Fortunately, at this moment, other topics were brought up, so this topic ended.

Monica was also a little annoyed by staying there to receive guests. She let go of Finn and gave Jeanne a look, and the two of them left the crowd.

They walked quite a distance away.

Monica heaved a sigh of relief.

“I hate this kind of business meeting the most,” Monica said.

“Then why did you leave Finn alone there?” Jeanne was speechless.

“He likes to act. Let him pretend until the end.” Monica glanced at Finn and watched him accompany her parents to socialize with ease.

She felt a little unhappy for some reason.

It was Finn’s behavior that made her parents feel that he was the nice person in the marriage while she was bad.

“By the way, why isn’t my godson here?” Monica did not want to think about it anymore. They were going to divorce soon anyway.

“He doesn’t like this kind of banquet.”

“Jeannie, don’t you think it’s not good for George to be like this?” Monica suddenly became very serious.

Jeanne frowned. “What’s wrong?”

“If he’s so introverted, how is he going to find a girlfriend?” Monica’s face was filled with worry.

‘You’re rushing things,’ Jeanne thought.

Monica still wanted to say something when her eyes suddenly moved.

A light suddenly flashed in her eyes. She smiled very brightly. “Fourth Master Swan is here.”

Jeanne did not turn around. She instinctively wanted to leave.

At this moment, she could feel a familiar figure appearing by her side.

Monica could not help but laugh. “Fourth Master, did you deliberately dress up as a couple with Jeannie?”

Jeanne frowned.

At this moment, she turned her head.

She turned around and saw that Fourth Master Swan was wearing a black suit. The key point was that the collar of the suit was inlaid with a circle of thin diamonds. It was very similar to the belt on Jeanne’s waist.

It might be fine if they did not stand together.

When they stood together, they looked like... a pair.

“Is that so?” Fourth Master Swan seemed to be sizing up Jeanne. “It’s probably telepathy.”

Monica teased, “Tsk, tsk, tsk. Fourth Master, you’re showing off!”

Fourth Master Swan smiled and silently agreed.

Monica was also tactful. He gave Nox, who was next to Edward, a look.

Of course, Nox understood it at a glance.

The two of them left together in a tacit understanding.

Those who did not know would think that Monica and Nox were having an affair.

Once the two of them left, naturally, only Edward and Jeanne were left.

Jeanne was speechless.

How much did Monica want to make them a match?

How many times did Jeanne have to say it? It was impossible for her and Fourth Master Swan to be together.

Jeanne pursed her lips and turned to leave.

Her arm was suddenly pulled by someone.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re leaving like that?”

Jeanne took a deep breath and smiled. “Fourth Master, how can I help you?”

“Ms. Lawrence, you took advantage of me. Are you leaving just like that?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth twitched.

She knew that she could not offend a cunning man like Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne put on a fake smile. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Is that so?” Fourth Master Swan raised his eyebrow slightly.

Jeanne nodded. “I really don’t know.”

“Then I’ll help you recall it.” As soon as Edward finished, he placed his hand on Jeanne’s face. He gently caressed her lips with her fingers.

Jeanne’s body was about to explode.

At this moment, she heard Fourth Master Swan say, “They’re quite soft.”

‘Soft my *ss!’
