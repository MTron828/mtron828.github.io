Chapter 1741: Nox’s Love For Babies

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the small car, Bella said excitedly, “Mom, my teacher said today that many people will be participating in the sports day and that there will be many programs. I’m really looking forward to it.”

“Yes,” Shelly replied.

In fact, she was wondering whether she should invite Nox and was a little conflicted.

“Mom, you and Uncle will be there, right?” Bella suddenly asked.

Shelly looked at Bella for a while before saying, “I will definitely be there.” As for Nox, she turned to look at Nox, who was driving, but she did not say anything.

On the contrary, it was Nox who overheard their conversation and interrupted. “Bella, why do you need me to be there?”

“It’s our school’s sports day. The teacher said I should invite my mom and dad to participate. But since I don’t have a father, I’ve asked the teacher it I can invite you to join us.” Bella’s clear, childlike voice was filled with anticipation.

At that moment, Shelly was a little nervous because she did not know if Nox would agree. After all, Nox probably did not like to participate in those kinds of activities and might find it a hassle.

“Alright, I will be there.” Nox agreed immediately.

Even Shelly was shocked.

Shelly had to confirm it with him again. “Nox, it’s next Tuesday. Are you working?”

“When have I ever been punctual for work?” Nox chuckled.

He did not react to how reluctant Shelly sounded. He was so tolerant of Shelly that he felt that he had lost all his principles.

“There’s an entire afternoon of activity.”

“Alright.”

“There will be physical activities throughout the sports day, and parents are required to accompany their children throughout the entire process. Especially for younger kids like Bella, parents are required to participate in every event.” “Are you doubting my health?” Nox asked.

“No.” Shelly quickly denied it. “I’m just afraid that you’ll find it a hassle.” “Shelly.” Nox was driving with a serious expression.

Shelly was startled when Nox suddenly called out to her so seriously.

“To me, I’m living with you as a family, and since Bella is your daughter, she’s naturally mine too. At least, while we are together, she is. Thus, Bella’s matters are my matters. You don’t need to feel bad about it.”

Shelly pursed her lips and thought she was a little too petty. However, she was somewhat moved by Nox’s words.

She nodded and said, “Alright, I’ll remind you next Tuesday.”

“Sure.” Nox nodded. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He may look calm, but what no one noticed was that he was slowly letting out a breath of relief from how nervous he was just now. Only God knew that he was afraid that Shelly would reject him.

What he actually wanted was to create the best memories they could with each other in the limited time. At least after they broke up, Shelly would occasionally think of him and not think that he was a bad person.

In the ward, Jeanne left shortly after Nox, and Finn sent Gary and Ruby away as well. He knew they would be tired after taking care of the babies all day, which they were, and so they left. Other than the nanny and the nurse, only the family of four was left in the room.

At that moment, Finn pulled the round curtain over again, and Monica thought Finn was going to wipe her body again. After all, she knew Finn was a bit of a clean freak, and he must be disgusted that she had not showered yet.

However, Finn did not go to the bathroom to take out a basin and a towel.

Instead, he walked straight to her and began to take off her hospital gown.

“What are you doing?” Monica defended her innocence.

“What can I do?” Finn asked. “In that case, why did you take off my clothes?”

“You’ll know once you take it off.”

“Finn, are you a pervert?” Monica could not help but suspect.

Finn was speechless, but he did not stop what he was doing. Immediately, Monica’s entire face turned red. ‘F*ck. Finn’s a beast!’

After a while, Finn said, “We can get the babies to help you.”

‘What?”

Finn could not be bothered to explain to Monica what he was doing anymore. He even wondered how such a silly person could revive the Cardellini Enterprise back then.

He first went to the bathroom to wipe her with a clean towel before carrying

the baby brother in. Monica was still confused when she saw Finn placing the baby on her chest and then guiding the baby to start sucking.

Only then did Monica’s eyes widen. It turned out that Finn was so careful just now because he was confirming if she was lactating yet.

Damn it.. She was overthinking again!
