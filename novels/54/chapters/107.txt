She looked out the windows and glanced at the city which was shrouded in heavy rain.

Three months. She had only given herself three months to leave.

Outside the door, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Jeanne put out the cigarette butt and returned to her office chair. “Come in.”

Amy pushed the door open and entered. “Team leader Lawrence, the Chairman is looking for you.”

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

She got up and walked toward Alexander Lawrence’s office.

Because there was a high-level meeting today, Alexander was also at work.

It was rare for Alexander to be in a good mood. When he saw Jeanne come, he even smiled amiably. “Sit.”

“Yes.” Jeanne appeared very respectful and sat respectfully across from him.

“Just now, Eden called and said that the three-year interest-free loan application has been settled. By tomorrow at the latest, he will transfer 200 million yuan to our account.” Alexander could not hide his excitement. This was probably his greatest achievement since he started working.

First, he successfully negotiated the exclusive contract with MUK Group in Harken. Second, he had taken advantage of the Swans.

“Accompany me to the meeting later. At the same time, you will also accept your position as the marketing director.”

“Alright.”

Jeanne followed Alexander to the executive meeting room.

Alexander Lawrence used to suffer in meetings and many of his decisions would be refuted by other high-level officials, making him embarrassed. However, today, because of the contract with MUK Group and the three-year interest-free loan from Swanhaven Bank, he became rather arrogant.

He said to the people below, “The contract with MUK group is almost finalized. On Monday, I will personally sign the contract with MUK Group. This contract will bring about a historic change for the Lawrence Enterprise. We will become the first company in Harken to develop e-commerce...”

Alexander Lawrence said this with elation, appearing a little too proud.

The people below also listened. After all, Alexander Lawrence had indeed brought benefits to the Lawrence Enterprise. After the media revealed yesterday that MUK Group’s partner was the Lawrence Enterprise, it caused an uproar in the business world. As expected, when the stock market opened on Monday, the Lawrence Enterprise would soar.

After Alexander bragged about all the benefits of this collaboration, he said, “When Jeanne first joined the company, she promised at the meeting that she would take down the exclusive rights to the MUK Group Harken. Now that she has done it, shouldn’t all the higher-ups fulfill their respective obligations?”

“General Manager Lawrence, if you have something to say, just say it. Why do you have to beat around the bush and deliberately embarrass everyone?” Bryce Hoffman was a little unhappy.

Today, he had really had enough of Alexander Lawrence’s petty success.

“Then I will speak frankly. I have appointed Jeanne as the director of the marketing department. She will be under the senior management of the Lawrence Enterprise and will be in charge of all the operations of the marketing department. At the same time, I will step down from my position as the marketing director. Please make an official appointment in the general department before Monday morning. The public announcement will be held for three days.”

“Yes.” Winston Stone had no choice but to accept the order.

“I have nothing else to add. The senior management meeting will then come to an end. I wish everyone a happy weekend.” Alexander announced.

Then, he took the lead and left.

Jeanne followed Alexander’s footsteps.

Alexander suddenly stopped and patted Jeanne’s shoulder. He said earnestly, “Jeanne, do a good job. As you can see, dad will definitely not mistreat you.”

“Thank you, father.’ Jeanne nodded.

In her heart, she felt a little ironic.

She actually knew what Alexander Lawrence was planning.

He just wanted to use her to develop the Lawrence Enterprise. In fact, after she had done her part, she would not get any benefits.

Just like her mother back then.

In the end, she would not repeat the tragic fate of her mother.

She’ll definitely take revenge on what they put her mother through.
