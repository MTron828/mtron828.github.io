Chapter 637: Monica Was Drunk and Walked Into the Wrong Door

On that day, when he finally found her, all he saw was her desolate tombstone and her daughter, almost dying from dystocia.

Kingsley drank some wine.

After he ended the phone call with Jeanne, he held a glass of red wine and looked at everything in the Delta Islands.

In fact, he had once wondered for what reason the Hills existed. To kill people and kill more people? To make all the descendants of the Hills become heartless killers?

His eyes moved slightly.

Lucy walked in from outside and caught a waft of the smell of alcohol. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The man was quite the alcoholic.

Most of the time, he had a habit of having a few drinks and would not usually get drunk.

She went up to him respectfully and reported, “I’ve finally found Edward’s whereabouts.”

Kingsley looked at her.

“It’s in an ancient area of the Harken and considered a relatively remote town in the Harken. We’ve been following Edward since he left South Hampton City, but he managed to shake us off a few times. We didn’t expect him to move around a few cities and eventually settle down in that city,” Lucy reported.

“Do you have any important clues?”

“Not at the moment. We haven’t found anyone suspicious either. It seems Edward is only going to negotiate a deal that can’t be done openly.”

“Get someone to keep an eye on him.”

“Yes,” Lucy replied respectfully.

After that, she turned around and was about to leave.

“How long has it been since we last had sex?” Kingsley suddenly asked her from behind.

Lucy stopped in her tracks.

Kingsley had many women. Most of them were socialites, but there was also no guarantee that he would occasionally sleep with a few female assassins, and she was one of them.

Actually, all female assassins had undergone special training in the area of sex. Therefore, Kingsley was able to enjoy those women’s skills.

However, there was a taboo in having sex with Kingsley, which was he would never accept any woman getting pregnant with his child.

There was once a female assassin who wanted to rely on her son to climb up the ladder, but Kingsley kicked her in the stomach in front of everyone. From then on, no one dared to cross Kingsley’s line!

“Do it with me once,” Kingsley ordered.

To anyone, it was an order.

Lucy could be considered an assassin who had been with Kingsley for a long time.

Ever since he brought her back to the Delta Islands that year, she had been following him. She was also closest to him among all the assassins.

She had seen Kingsley’s many cruel looks.

For a long time, she had even thought that Kingsley was heartless. He was just a tool for killing or a powerful killing machine that was numb to killing.

In this world, there was no one he could not kill and no one he did not want to kill!

However, a person like him, who had no heart at all, had someone he would go mad to protect, and that person was Jeanne, his biological niece.

Jeanne could do whatever she wanted to him, and he could die for Jeanne.

However, what Jeanne did not know was that when she was brought back to the Hills seven years ago, Kingsley used his own life to protect her and let her stay in the Hills.

At first, Lucy was not too sure why Jeanne could not get the Hills’ recognition even though she was a member of the Hills. It only later did she realize how important Jeanne was to Kingsley.

That was why she would make sure to treat Jeanne very well.

A person had no choice but to lower his head under the eaves, so she also had to learn how to survive.

Fortunately, Jeanne was not difficult to get along with.

She did not put on the airs of a young lady at all. She did not even think her identity was any different from other assassins, other than the fact she could resist Kingsley.

“Come over!” Kingsley was a little impatient that Lucy did not take the initiative immediately.

In the past, as long as he wanted it, she would definitely give it to him at any time.

In other words, assassins did not have the right to reject the boss’s orders.

They carried out the orders they received, and it was the same for sleeping with him.

Yet now… She did not know when it started, but she rejected the idea of sleeping with Kingsley.

She said, “It’s not a good time for me today, but Millie doesn’t have a mission today. Do you want me to call her over to accompany you?”

“You seem to have rejected me many times.” Kingsley’s face darkened, and he gulped down the glass of red wine.

Lucy pondered for a moment before saying, “Including this time, it has only been three times, and it’s all because of the special period.”

Seemingly believing in her words, he said, “Tell Millie to come in.”

“Yes,” Lucy answered respectfully.
