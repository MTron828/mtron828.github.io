1046 If She Fails, She’ll Get Back Up Again

However, she could not resist. She could only allow him to see her embarrassment.

“Lucy, leave this scar on your face.” Kingsley enunciated each word.

“Yes.”

The moment she drew that cut on her face, she had never thought of removing it.

“You may leave.” Kingsley suddenly pushed her away.

He had used some strength, so Lucy took several steps back.

“Yes,” Lucy replied respectfully after she had stabilized herself.

Then, as she turned around to leave, Kingsley ordered coldly, “Since you and K01 both say that Kerby is a talent, train him well!”

“Yes,” Lucy said respectfully again.

When she left Kingsley’s room, her heart still hurt.

However, she was used to it, and once she got used to it, she would gradually forget about it.

By the time she walked back to Kerby’s room, Kerby had already changed his clothes and was about to go out.

“Where are you going?” Lucy asked him.

“I’m planning to go to the training ground for training.” Sometimes, exercise could also allow him to vent.

“I’ll go with you,” Lucy suddenly said.

She felt that if she wanted Kerby to overcome that trauma, she did not only have to help him physically but also mentally.

Therefore, there was no hurry for them to get into bed.

Kerby was a little surprised.

“I haven’t trained for a long time, and I suddenly miss it.”

“Alright.” Kerby nodded.

In fact, he really wanted to see how good Ms. Harmon of the Hills was.

...

“I’ll go get changed You can wait for me at the training ground.”

“Yes.” Kerby nodded.

After changing into her training attire, Lucy walked to the training ground.

At that moment, Kerby was shooting. Out of the ten bullets, nine of them hit the bullseye. He missed the last one because Lucy’s arrival distracted him.

Kerby was indeed very talented, but his mind was not at the level of a powerful assassin, which required time to hone.

“Ms. Harmon.” Kerby put down her gun and turned to look at Lucy.

When he saw her, his eyes were filled with surprise.

“What’s wrong?” Lucy asked.

“I didn’t expect you to be so young,” Kerby said bluntly.

The Ms. Harmon he saw usually looked mature and charming, but this was the first time he saw her in training attire, which made her look at least five years younger than before.

Lucy smiled. “How old do you think I am?”

...

As she said that, she directly took Kerby’s pistol. Then, she aimed at the target.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

Three consecutive shots sounded, and all three shots hit the bullseye.

Kerby was still a little surprised as very few people could shoot so steadily in succession.

Lucy put down her gun and seemed to be very satisfied with her results.

“You still haven’t answered me.” Lucy turned to look at Kerby.

Kerby came back to his senses.

“In your thirties,” Kerby answered.

“Is being 30 something old to you?”

“Um…” Kerby was a little embarrassed.

Lucy smiled faintly. “For a kid in his early twenties, I’m indeed old.”

...

“But now, you look around the same age as me,” Kerby quickly explained.

Lucy did not mind.

She was 32 years old this year and had never hidden her age from anyone. After all, everyone eventually had to admit that they were old.

“I’m ten years older than you.” Lucy kept talking.

Kerby did not know what to say. After all, in his mind, Lucy was probably his senior.

“Let’s compete,” Lucy said.

“Huh?” Kerby was surprised.

“Full bullets. Let’s see who hits the most bullseye.”

“Alright,” Kerby quickly agreed.

He was still very confident in the training ground.

With that, the two of them faced the target and competed. After a round, Kerby won.

...

Lucy could not help but sigh. “It’s true what they say about it being inevitable that in every profession, the young will replace the old.”

“Ms. Harmon, you’re not old.” At least she did not look old today.

If not for the scar on her face, he would even think that Ms. Harmon was very beautiful.

Lucy smiled. No matter what, a woman would never reject praise.

With a smile, she said to Kerby, “Let’s go and to the other…”

Then, she saw Kingsley show up.

At that moment, Lucy was still smiling. However, the moment she saw Kingsley, her smile instantly froze.

Kerby, who was originally rather relaxed, became nervous when he saw Kingsley.

Lucy could feel the change in Kerby’s mood.
