Chapter 493: Jasmine’s Tragic Downfall

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everyone was indifferent to Jasmine’s scream.

Jenifer’s face was also grim.

Compared to Jasmine, her daughter, she knew very well what kind of abuse Jasmine would suffer when the latter went back. However, for the sake of benefits, she could only watch helplessly as Jasmine was taken away. More importantly, Jasmine would no longer be of any use to her after this, and she did not need to destroy herself for a useless person!

She knew that if she did not perform well, she would also be implicated.

Seeing that Jenifer was indifferent to her, Jasmine was disappointed. However, because of fear, she had no choice but to beg them. This time, she shouted at Joshua, “Joshua, come and save me now...”

Joshua had not dared to speak the entire time.

He was already afraid when facing the Swans, so now that his sister was begging him, he did not dare to do anything.

Instead, he turned to look at Jenifer, who gave him a look. At that, he did not even dare to move.

Looking at her apathetic family, Jasmine laughed — the kind that sounded tragic but crazy. “In the end, I’m just a tool for your benefit, am I not? Now that I’m useless, you can ignore me. Karma will bite you back in the *ss…”

Eden dragged Jasmine cruelly out of the Universe Garden.

Along the way, Jasmine’s crazy voice sounded, frightening many servants in the Swan family’s manor. However, because of Eden’s cold and dark expression, no one dared to look at him.

With a strong force, Eden threw Jasmine directly onto the floor of the main hall of Purple Pavilion Garden.

Jasmine fell to the ground in a sorry state.

......

At that moment, her hair was a mess, and because she had cried so hard, her makeup was smudged. She looked just like a crazy woman.

However, before Eden could make a move, Belle stepped in and slapped Jasmine countless times.

As if she was venting all her anger, she hit Jasmine while scolding, “You b*tch, how dare you cheat on my son? How dare you? For humiliating our family in front of everyone in the Swans today, I’ll beat you to death!”

“Ah! Ah!” Jasmine screamed.

The pain on her face and the psychological torture made her go crazy.

Belle hit her for a long time. Only when she was tired did she stand up from the ground, panting heavily.

However, she was still swearing. “This b*tch! I won’t give up until I beat her to death!”

Eden looked at Jasmine cruelly, seeing her lying on the ground with a swollen face.

However, he did not pity her at all. He even felt he could not vent all his anger on Jasmine no matter what he did to her. As he was looking at that woman fiercely, he suddenly stepped forward and kicked Jasmine’s stomach fiercely.

Jasmine was in so much pain that she almost fainted. She could not even scream.

However, she clutched her stomach.

She just had an abortion surgery yesterday, and today, she was suffering from physical and mental torture.

How could Eden be so cruel? How could he be so cruel to her?

That kick just now could take her life.

Did Eden want to beat her to death?

She was rolling on the ground in pain, looking extremely miserable.

Belle looked at the state Jasmine was in and her pale face. As soon as Eden was about to step forward and kick Jasmine again, she stopped him and said, “Don’t kill her!”

She was afraid that her son would kill Jasmine. By then, he would not be able to escape the blame.

Eden’s veins were popping. He really wanted to kill Jasmine.

He looked at the miserable woman on the ground coldly and said, “Jasmine, did you know what would happen to you for doing that? For cheating behind my back?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I didn’t do it willingly. Jeanne framed me. I love you so much. How could I do anything to let you down? Eden, you have to believe me. It’s Jeanne who wants to sow discord between us. I love you the most. I do...” Jasmine forced herself to defend herself.

“Enough!” Eden did not care how Jasmine slept with other men.
