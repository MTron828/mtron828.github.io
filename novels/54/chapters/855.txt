856 Monica��s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

She finally understood that while technology had developed to a certain level, seeing is not necessarily believing. She took a deep breath and sent the video to George.

She reminded George not to look at it and to put it in the headlines tomorrow morning.

��Okay,�� George replied coolly.

Monica took a deep breath. Her eyes narrowed. There was no way Michael would be able to tolerate this.

The next morning, Monica was trending.

Yesterday, there were still people who praised Monica��s dance moves and figure, but today, they were all criticizing her. All of them were vicious comments about her being shameless, cheap, and a slut.

Monica hid under the blanket and took a few glances.

Although she had expected this, she did not expect people��s words to be so harsh. If she had not been prepared, she would have jumped off a building in anger.

She just stared at the comments for a long time when the phone suddenly rang. She took a look at the caller ID and hung up. The phone kept ringing, so Monica turned off her phone instead.

This time, Michael probably could not take it anymore.

Monica hid herself at home and slept for the whole day. Although her mother knew what she was up to, she still looked at her with a meaningful gaze.

She had done so much for Michael.

Monica was on the verge of a breakdown. However, such a method was the most direct and effective method that she could think of. Even if everything was not going as smoothly as she had expected.

It was on the news for the entire day.

A day later, the news website was blocked. The official statement said it had suffered an unknown virus attack, causing the website to collapse completely. It was currently under emergency maintenance and would be up at a later notice.

Then, all the entertainment websites were shut down.

When Monica saw it, she was completely dumbfounded. She never expected Michael��s power to be so great. Her hands shook as she called Michael.

The other side was unusually calm. All he said was, ��You can��t win against me.��

Just these five words caused Monica to explode.

��We��ll see about that, Michael!�� Monica abruptly hung up the phone.

He would not win. She still had fight left in her.

Michael looked at the words ��call ended��, his expression extremely ugly.

He did not actually have that much power. He had gone to the leader and expressed his determination to marry Monica. His purpose was, of course, to marry Monica. The more Monica resisted, the more he wanted to let him know that she was vulnerable in front of him. On the other hand, it was also to let the leader know that he really loved Monica, lower the leader��s guard against him, and let the leader think he was not ambitious and would do many things for a woman. After all, a person with too much ambition would not be recognized by his family.

His eyes narrowed. Monica, you��d better not challenge my limits!

At this moment, Monica picked up the phone and called Elsa.

Elsa trembled with fear. ��Sister, don��t you harm me! Now both you and the young hunk I introduced to you are being scolded by the entire internet. I heard that if Director Ross hadn��t used his connections to shut down the websites, your life would have been over! So I��m going out to lay low for a while. If someone in your family finds out about me, who knows how I��d die.��

��Before you leave, pass me the phone numbers of those young hunks of yours.��

��Monica, are you crazy? Possessed, even? When we asked you to play with us in the past, you said that you were a married woman, and those handsome men couldn��t even touch you. What��s going on with you now?��

��Just give them to me.��

Monica must have lost her mind, Elsa thought. In the end, to not offend Monica, she gave her their phone numbers.

Before she hung up, she did not forget to say, ��I��m going abroad to lie low. Don��t look for me, or expose me.��

Monica ignored her and immediately called one of the young hunks.

��Let��s talk about the price first, then we��ll decide on the location.�� Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Those who came out to play would never refuse the temptation of money.

Monica changed her clothes and went out. It was already 10 p.m.

Monica��s action of leaving the room completely stunned Ruby. ��Monica.��

��Mom, I know what to do.�� She ran off after saying that.
