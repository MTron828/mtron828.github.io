867 Step by Step, the Proposal

“What if it still happens?” Gary was still worried.

It was better to be safe than sorry for this matter. He did not want his daughter’s happiness to be destroyed at the hands of Michael.

“Then we’ll get married.” Monica was unmoved.

“I won’t allow it!” Gary was furious. “I, Gary, have not reached the point where I need to sell my daughter.”

“Michael really likes me.” Monica hugged and comforted her father.

If she could not resist, she would compromise. Then, at least she could say that she tried.

She would not make her family worry anymore nor choose to commit suicide again.

She said, “You were not deceived by Michael. Michael really does like me. That’s why he treats me so well, making you all believe he loves me. In fact, there’s nothing wrong with finding someone who loves me. I’m resisting now because I’m not willing to be tricked by Michael. However, if I really can’t resist, I won’t suffer any losses by marrying him.”

“Monica, I don’t want you to live such a depressing life.” Ever since she was young, he could not bear to let his daughter suffer, so how could he allow other men to hurt her?

“Dad, it’s not as tragic as you think. Besides, why don’t you believe that I can refuse to marry Michael? Even if you don’t believe in me, at least believe in Jeanne. She’s very powerful now.” Monica did not want her parents to worry. That was why she seemed to be in a particularly good mood.

Before Gary could say something, he was stopped by Ruby.

“Alright. Let’s believe in our Monica,” Yan ruling said. “With Jeanne secretly helping her, there’s still a chance of winning. We can’t back down before things have even started and destroy our own prestige.”

“That’s right.” Monica agreed.

“It’s a good thing you have a reliable friend.” It was clear Gary had compromised. “Otherwise, with your personality, you’d be helping others count money after being sold.”

“Dad,” she said. Monica was still a little unhappy. Who would say such a thing about their own daughter?

Though this was the truth of the matter, and humans were afraid of being exposed.

“Alright.” Gary smiled kindly. “No matter what happens in the end, your mom and I will support any decision you make. There’s no need to put yourself in a difficult position.”

“Thanks, dad.” Monica hugged Gary.

She felt that she would not be able to do anything earth-shattering in her lifetime. While she did not have Jeanne’s abilities, she at least had the best parents in the world, and that was enough for her to live life to the fullest!

The next morning, Michael came to the Cardellini villa to pick Monica up.

Monica had chosen a fitting white dress to wear. It was very dignified and elegant. Coupled with the simple makeup on her face today, she looked extremely pure and innocent. She was a completely different woman from the fiery dance that circulated widely a few days ago. It was clear she walked the path of a white lotus green tea b*tch and had forcibly turned herself into a Saint. Even Monica despised herself.

Michael looked at Monica in front of him and sized her up. He seemed to be very satisfied with her dress and opened the door for her like a gentleman. “Get in.”

Monica glanced at Michael but didn’t show any hospitality.

Jeanne had said she had to act naturally when facing Michael and not let him doubt her. However, it was really hard for her to put on an act.

She suppressed her emotions and sat in Michael’s car. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As soon as they got in, Michael began to indifferently explain the press conference they were attending today.

“I’ve already bribed the reporters at the scene to only speak in a positive manner. As long as you don’t mess around, everything will go smoothly.”

Monica did not answer back.

“I’ve also asked someone to re-edit the indecent photos of you a few days ago. It’ll be replaced with the profile picture of another low-list female celebrity. The celebrity has already arranged a confession post as well. When the time comes, she’ll admit it on Facebook and your unsightly photos will be replaced by someone else. So you’ll still be innocent in the public’s eye.”

Monica couldn’t help but glance at Michael. He really had thought of everything. She would have never thought about finding a scapegoat.

Michael was still expressionless. “I’ll propose to you at the press conference later, so you’d better be prepared. I don’t want to clean up any more messes. My energy is limited, and the time I’ve spent on you now is my bottom line. If you really want me to resist, I won’t have the patience to play with you next time.”
