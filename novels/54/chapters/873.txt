874 Accumulating Power, Return to South Hampton City

Kingsley said that they were all going back.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

Kingsley’s gaze also landed on Jeanne. He said bluntly, “Once you go back, you and Fourth Master Swan will be enemies. I even suspect that Fourth Master Swan might have guessed what we’re going to do, so he’ll definitely try his best to stop us. If that’s the case, the next time we meet, it’ll be a fight to the death.”

“I understand,” Jeanne responded.

“Then prepare yourself,” Kingsley said nothing more.

There were not many words that needed to be said in situations like this. The Hills only had to carry out the orders.

“Is there anything else?” Jeanne asked.

“You may leave.” Kingsley waved his hand.

As Jeanne and Lucy turned to leave, Kingsley suddenly called out to her.

“Lucy.”

Lucy stopped in her tracks and turned around.

“You stay.”

Lucy glanced at Jeanne.

She felt that Jeanne needed her more at this moment. However, she always obeyed Kingsley’s orders, and it was the same for everyone present. Hence, Jeanne left on her own.

In the room, Kingsley said to Melinda beside him, “You go out too.”

Melinda’s expression changed slightly.

The current Kingsley did not hide anything from her. No matter what it was, he let her be by his side. Now, his conversation with Lucy had sent her away.

She did not dare to show it, but she left with some resentment in her heart.

Only Kingsley and Lucy were left now. It had been so long since they had been alone that Lucy even felt a little uncomfortable.

She stood in front of Kingsley and awaited his instructions.

He said, “When you go back this time, your task is to look after Jeanne.”

“I think you should trust her.” Lucy had always been fair.

While Jeanne did have the motive to betray the Hills, she would not. Lucy had complete trust in that.

“I don’t believe that she would do anything to Fourth Master Swan if it came to it,” Kingsley said bluntly.

Yu Jia pursed her lips.

It was true. She had not considered this. All she thought of was that Jeanne would not betray the Hills. However, she did not expect Jeanne to betray Fourth Master Swan either.

It was difficult being caught between the two forces.

“If necessary, help Jeanne kill Fourth Master Swan,” Cheng Kai ordered.

That would mean she most likely could not survive.

Putting aside the consequences of killing Fourth Master Swan, she would not even be able to face Jeanne.

“Jeanne trusts you,” Kingsley said. “So she won’t be on guard.”

Hence, she should take advantage of Jeanne’s state to plot against her.

“Understood,” she agreed immediately. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Hills were about carrying out orders and nothing else. There were no feelings involved.

Once an order was given, they would be like a demon who lost their humanity.

After Kingsley had given his instructions and Lucy had agreed, a long silence filled the room. Perhaps Kingsley felt a little burdened, even if she would the one to kill Fourth Master Swan.

Though, Jeanne was not stupid. She would be able to guess that it was an order from Kingsley, so there were still some thoughts for concern. However, this was Kingsley’s business, and no one could change his decision.

She said, “Mr. Hill, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave now.”

Although there was still less than a month before they had to leave, this mission would be huge, and there were many things to prepare. She had to start planning now.

“Lucy,” Kingsley suddenly called out her name, his tone a little cold.

Lucy looked at him.

“Are you hiding from me?” Kingsley asked.

Lucy was surprised. How dared she?

In the Hills, he had the final say. Her life was in his hands, so she could not hide even if she wanted to.

“Come here.” Kingsley suddenly ordered.

Although the two were only a few steps apart, he wanted her to go to him now, so she went.

She took a few steps and stopped right in front of Kingsley.

“You want me to help you undress?” Kingsley raised his eyebrows.

So that’s how it is, Lucy thought.

She smiled as she lowered her head and began untying her clothes bit by bit.

As she took off her clothes, she said, ” Mr. Hill, didn’t you think I was too small?”

Kingsley did not answer.

“I thought Melinda served you well…”

“That’s my business,” Kingsley said. “Whether or not I want you is mine as well.”
