Chapter 412: Fourth Master Swan Bullies George

“Yes, that’s the one,” Edward affirmed.

Pretending that she knew nothing, Jeanne took Edward’s tie and stood on her toes.

However, even standing on her toes was a little strenuous, and she felt she had to change into high heels.

At that moment, Edward bent down a little to try to make himself the same height as her.

Speaking of which, she was not short. At the height of 165 cm, she was considered above average for women.

It was Edward who was too tall — a whole 24 cm taller than her!

What on earth did that fellow eat to grow so tall?

She put on a tie for Edward seriously, and after putting it on, she looked up.

It was because she could feel the other party’s burning gaze on her that she had no choice but to make eye contact.

When their eyes met, Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, her legs still weak.

As she saw Edward’s cheek getting closer and closer to her, her heart started to beat faster.

It seemed easy for him to bewitch her.

She closed her eyes.

......

The moment she did, she felt Edward’s lips brush past her lips and stopped at her ears.

That made Jeanne’s heart beat even faster.

The kiss, which she thought she was going to have, suddenly disappeared. Instead, she heard him say in a low voice beside her ear, “Thank you.”

It was a very polite sentence, but it sounded very erotic.

He smiled and was about to stand up straight when Jeanne suddenly wrapped her arms around his neck.

Edward was stunned, but his smile became even more charming.

Yes. She was the one not satisfied with her desires, so she took the initiative to kiss him.

In the dressing room, the temperature rose sharply.

After a long time, the two of them walked out with their clothes in a mess.

Nothing much happened.

It was just… a deep kiss. However, Jeanne was blushing, and Edward’s face seemed to have a different color.

The two of them then went downstairs to eat breakfast.

Downstairs, George was already sitting at the dining table, eating his own breakfast. The moment he saw them walk downstairs together, he still looked indifferent.

As Jeanne and Edward sat down, Teddy respectfully served them their breakfast.

“Do you need me to send you to school?” Jeanne asked George.

“No need.” George shook his head. “Teddy will send me.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

George seemed done with breakfast. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He put down his plate and utensils before raising his head to look at Jeanne. At that moment, he paused for a while before saying, “Why is your mouth swollen?”

Embarrassed, Jeanne glanced at Edward, who had also raised his head to look at her lips. After looking at them, Edward smiled instead.

George frowned. “Did Fourth Master Swan bite you?”

“Ahem.” Even Teddy, who was at the side, felt embarrassed for them.

“Why did you bite my mother?” To begin with, George did not like Edward. Hence, when he noticed something was wrong, he deliberately found fault with Edward.

“That’s not a bite, but you’re still young. You won’t understand.”

George was furious, so Jeanne quickly said, “George, it’s getting late. Let Teddy send you to school first.”

With that, George left in a huff.

Jeanne looked at George’s back and turned her head to Edward.

Edward ate slowly. Upon feeling Jeanne’s gaze, he said plainly, “Don’t you think George is getting cuter and cuter now?”

Damn. He really deserved a beating, but Jeanne suppressed her temper.

She simply stared at Edward in front of her for a while.

“Do I look good?” Edward raised his head and smiled.

.

Jeanne rolled her eyes and then lowered her head to eat her breakfast. “I think your hair is a little longer now.”

Edward was stunned.

“Do you like short hair?”

“I think it can be a little shorter,” Jeanne said.

“Okay, “Edward replied. “I’ll find time to sort it out.”

Instead of answering, Jeanne quickly finished her breakfast.

Then, she had Miles send her to work. At the same time, she wanted to ask him about some things.

Edward and Jeanne went out together.

Edward watched Jeanne get into the car before he returned to his car.

The moment he got in, he instructed the driver, “Head to the barber.”

“...”

Jeanne sat in the car.

After glancing at the car behind her, she picked up the phone to make a call. “Kingsley.”

“Okay.”

“Edward will go for a haircut today.”

“Okay. I got it.”

With that, Jeanne put down the phone.

She could not describe what she was feeling.

Actually, it was very easy for her to get Edward’s hair. Even if without that method, she would still have a chance to get it since they shared a bed together.

However, how could she get Old Master Swan’s hair?

She did not have much contact with him, and Wade was the only one by Old Master Swan’s side. It was impossible for her to bribe Wade.

Jeanne was silent.

“Jeanne,” Miles suddenly said.

“Yes.”

“Mr. Thorn has sent a few people over.”

“Oh?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“They arrived yesterday,” Miles said.

Jeanne answered, “Alright.”

“Is something big going to happen?”

“We’re safe for the time being,” Jeanne said.

Miles did not ask any further questions.

“By the way, thank you for saving Monica,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Miles was stunned for a moment, but he smiled, which professional killers rarely did.

He said, “I was just carrying out orders.”

“I know.” Jeanne nodded.

Miles’s heart wavered a little, but in the end, he still chose to be indifferent.

The car arrived at Lawrence Enterprise.

The wedding and the honeymoon only took a week, but it seemed like she was not used to coming back to work after a week.

As she walked into the hall and went to her office, everyone looked at her with surprise. They did not expect that she would come to work so soon after getting married.

Should she not have a beautiful honeymoon?

Amy hurriedly followed behind Jeanne. Before she could report about the work, Jeanne’s phone rang.

“So you still remember work exists, huh?” Alexander’s voice was unpleasant to hear.

It turned out that she was wrong in assuming she would have her normal marriage leave.

“Come to the senior management’s meeting room, now!” After that, he hung up the phone.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

For Alexander to call her like that, nothing good would come out of it!
