Chapter 278: Edward’s Honesty

They were intimate and not pretentious.

Jeanne washed the dishes seriously.

She could feel Edward burying his head between her neck and shoulder.

Jeanne always thought that Edward was so tall. If he leaned on her body, would he find it too tiring?

“How are your wounds recovering?” Edward asked her softly by her ear.

“They’re almost done,” Jeanne replied. She was curious, so she asked, “What medicine did Dr. Jones give me for my wounds to heal so quickly?”

“It’s specially made.” Edward smiled and blew into her ear.

Goosebumps appeared all over her body.

Jeanne pursed her lips to let her body relax.

She asked, “Did he develop it himself?”

“He’s a genius in the field of medicine,” Edward said straightforwardly.

It was obvious that he acknowledges Finn.

“Is he an orphan?” Jeanne asked.

“Are you very interested in Finn?” Someone sounded jealous.

“He’s Monica’s husband.”

“Don’t worry, he’s deeply in love with Monica.”

Jeanne also knew, but Monica did not.

“Finn is indeed an orphan,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne was stunned.

At this moment, she felt that Fourth Master Swan was confessing some things to her.

She actually did not want to know too many of the secrets he had.

She... did not have the right to know.

“Although the Swans have abandoned politics and entered the business industry all these years, we still have our power and will be in great danger. I think you should know very well that the Sanders are targeting the Swans,” Edward whispered in her ear.

Jeanne did not want to know too much.

There were many things that she did not need Fourth Master Swan to confess to her.

Even so, at this moment, she still chose to remain silent.

She heard Fourth Master Swan say in silence, “Actually, whatever the Sanders can think of, we can think of as well. Rejecting the marriage agreement with the Sanders was to protect the Swans.”

“So you used me,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

“No, I didn’t want to implicate the innocent.”

“Am I not innocent?” Jeanne felt like she wanted to kill Fourth Master Swan.

She was forced to leave South Hampton City by him, yet he still said that he did not want to implicate the innocent.

She was extremely innocent!

Thinking about it still made her angry.

Jeanne was fine when she came back. If Fourth Master Swan had not targeted her, would she be so “miserable” at this moment?!

“You don’t count.” Edward was very certain.

Jeanne was full of anger.

“The best way to reject the marriage without conflict is that I already belong to someone else. Matters of love—even on the surface—can not be forced. Hence, even if the Sanders are unwilling, they can only accept it,” Edward said, “So, as the future Fourth Madam Swan, shouldn’t you do your part?!”

‘I’ve already risked her life, and yet he’s asking me to do my part?!

‘Most importantly, who did he say will be the future Fourth Madam Swan?’

Jeanne said, “Fourth Master, you shouldn’t expect too much from me.”

“If it’s not you, then it won’t be anyone else,” Edward enunciated each word and bit on her ear hard.

‘Just wait and die alone then.’

Jeanne did not say it out loud.

There was no use talking too much at this time.

Facts spoke louder than words.

“The reason Finn is related to the Swans is that the Swans needed someone useful to us—someone who can protect me at crucial moments.” Edward went back to the topic.

He was talking about Dr. Jone’s matter.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Actually, Edward did not need to tell her so much.

She was just asking casually.

“I’m the heir of the Swans. The Swans need me to support everything, and our gradual expansion will bring about many dangers. Therefore, my dad had chosen my personal bodyguards from the moment I was born. They were the kind of people who would stand in front of me when I die. One is Nox, and the other is Finn.”

“You don’t have to tell me.” Jeanne was straightforward.

She did not need to know about this.

Edward seemed to have smiled.

He said, “I’m only telling you who are the people around me that you can trust, and what abilities they have.”

Jeanne did not need to know.

“You should be very clear about Nox’s background. He’s the grandson of my dad’s right-hand man, Wade Winter, when he was a national defense general. Nox had been instilled with the idea that he would die for me! He had been following me since he was five years old. I’m three years older than him. To be honest, when Nox first followed me, I had to hug him.”

Jeanne could imagine that scene.

She imagined the scene of a cold child hugging another child.

“Finn is the same age as me. He also came to my side when I was eight years old. You might be curious as to why my dad chose Finn out of so many people. It’s because Finn can’t feel any pain.”

“Huh?” Jeanne was a little surprised.

“He can’t feel any pain on his body when he’s injured. Someone like him is very suitable to be a professional bodyguard. Since he’s not afraid of pain, he’ll stand in front of danger at any time. Even if a knife is stabbed into his body, he’ll remain indifferent.”

Jeanne had never known that Finn had this kind of physical quality.

She guessed that Monica probably did not know.

“Other than me, Nox, my dad, and Wade, no one else knows,” Edward gave her a positive answer, “Now that you know, don’t tell Monica. This is considered a secret.”

‘...You shouldn’t have told me the secret!’

“Apart from being professional bodyguards, Finn and Nox have their own developments in other fields. I think you don’t need me to tell you that Finn is a doctor while Nox is a businessman. It’s easy to understand why Nox is a businessman because the Swans are doing business now and need more business talents. As for Finn’s practice in medicine... Doctors can save people or kill people. Therefore, my dad trained him to be my doctor. That’s how he can ensure my absolute safety.”

“Does your family... have any relationship with the Cardellinis?” Jeanne asked.

She could not help but ask.

Since Edward had said so much, she was also curious.

“We do, but it’s not what you think,” Edward said straightforwardly, “Everyone thinks that the Cardellinis supported Finn as he grew. In fact, it was my father who made Gary support Finn. The reason was that he didn’t want to attract the attention of those people who were secretly watching the Swans. No matter what, it was very unusual for the Swans to suddenly sponsor an orphan. In order to not cause unnecessary trouble, my dad asked Gary to sponsor Finn in the name of the Cardellinis’ business. More importantly, Gary has a pharmaceutical company. If Finn wants to develop as a doctor, it’d be best if he sponsors him.”

“Has the Swans already roped in many families in the business world?” Jeanne asked.

“No, there’s no need for that,” Edward replied. “In SHarken, the so-called twelve families in the business world are only divided into two types of families.”

Jeanne was surprised.

“The Swans and the other families.”

What Edward meant was the other families were not worth mentioning as compared to the Swans.

In fact, that was indeed the case. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Given the assets of the Swans, the other families including the Lockes, who had bankrupted, could not even compare to them. They did not even have half the assets of the Swans altogether.

The Swans had the right to be proud.

“However, Gary’s dad had some relations with my dad back then. They had a good relationship when my dad was in politics. Later, my dad left politics and chose to go into the business industry. The Cardellinis sponsored his initial funds, so my dad kept in contact with the Cardellinis. When my dad asked the Cardellinis to help sponsor someone, the Cardellinis naturally didn’t refuse him.”

Jeanne nodded.

Now, she roughly understood many things.

“Mr. Lawrence,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly called out to her.

At this moment, he hugged her and made her look him face to face.

He asked her very seriously, “When can you be honest with me?”
