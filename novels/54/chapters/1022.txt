1023 Millie’s Tragic End

If they disobeyed him, they would die an ugly death!

Millie’s face, which had been stepped on by Kingsley, had turned bright red. Perhaps in the next second, Kingsley would crush Millie’s brain.

Lucy spoke up, “Mr. Thorn, can I deal with Millie?”

Kingsley looked up at Lucy.

“I’m the biggest victim here, so I hope I can get rid of Millie myself.”

Kingsley released the strength he was putting in his foot and lifted it off Millie’s face.

The moment his foot left, Millie’s face was deformed, and her body was motionless as if she was already dead.

He said, “After you’re done, go and see Jeanne.”

“Yes,” Lucy said respectfully. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Kingsley turned around and walked to the side.

Lucy did not dare to waste any more time, so she pulled Millie up from the ground and left Kingsley’s room.

She took Millie straight to the underground prison.

That was where she was once beaten half to death by Millie.

As Millie was dragged along by Lucy, her skin kept rubbing against the ground, and her entire body was covered in blood.

“Don’t kill me…” Millie said weakly, “Please don’t kill me…”

Lucy sneered.

She had saved Millie from Kingsley not because she was soft-hearted.

Having killed many people, she did not have much attachment to anyone, let alone a person who had provoked her.

She had saved Millie only because she did not want Millie to die so easily.

Lucy squatted down and looked at the unrecognizable Millie. She said, “Do you think I would save you?”

Millie forced herself to look at Lucy.

“I just want you to know how you’ll die.”

“You…” Millie looked at Lucy with a bloody face.

“You probably don’t know why Kingsley suddenly doesn’t believe you, right?” Lucy sneered. “That’s because Cain is no longer a real man. In layman’s terms, he’s just a eunuch.”

Millie widened her eyes and looked at Lucy in disbelief.

That was why when she slandered Lucy for having an affair with Cain, it directly led to all her lies being exposed!

“More than ten years ago, when Cain was carrying out a mission, he injured a vital area. From then on, he took a back seat and became the manager of the Hills. Of course, it was many years ago. Many assassins have died since then, and few people know about it.” Lucy said, “Even if very few people know about it, they could still find out if they wanted to.”

“Yet you, without any preparation, overestimated yourself and came to kill me! You don’t even know the rules of the Hills’ accounts. What made you so confident that you could kill me?”

Millie glared at Lucy and could hear the sarcasm in her voice.

She thought that killing Lucy would be a piece of cake, but she ended up falling into Lucy’s trap.

“When did you know that I was going to kill you?!” Millie snarled.

“From the moment I set you up to have the intention to kill me.”

Millie was stunned.

“Don’t you understand? It was me. I deliberately provoked you to kill me,” Lucy repeated.

“Lucy!” Millie gritted her teeth.

Hence, everything was part of Lucy’s plan. Lucy had set her up and made her court her own death!

Her eyes were bloodshot, and she was on the verge of breaking down.

Lucy said, “Do you know why I was able to be by Kingsley’s side for so many years?”

“Shut up!” Millie screamed at the top of her lungs, not wanting to hear Lucy say another word!

“Do you really think that Kingsley only thinks with his lower body?” Lucy ignored how angry Millie was. “To Kingsley, women are just tools to vent his anger, but you’re so stupid to think that you can get him with your body!”

“Lucy, shut up. Shut up!”

Lucy remained unmoved.

After all, she was an assassin. When she was truly cold-blooded, other than cruelty and torture, she was not moved at all.

She continued, “I was able to work for Kingsley for so many years because I was smart enough and not because I used my body to seduce him. Millie, you’ve been extremely foolish from the start!”

Millie pushed herself off the floor with all her strength. When she stood up, she immediately threw a punch at Lucy.

At that moment, she even took out her hidden Swiss Army knife and stabbed it wildly at Lucy!

Every assassin would leave a weapon for themselves just in case.

Lucy dodged the knife, but because of a moment of carelessness, the knife scratched her face.

The next second, she kicked Millie hard.

Lucy’s kick threw Millie to the ground, and when Millie fell to the ground, she still wanted to resist.

However, Lucy had already stepped on Millie’s hand that was holding the military knife. Then, she used her body to restrain Millie, who was on the ground, to stop her from moving.

Millie’s face twisted in anger as she yelled at Lucy, “Let me go! I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!”

Lucy was expressionless.

As she broke Millie’s finger that was holding the military knife with her bare hand, Millie screamed in pain.

Lucy took the military knife and placed it on Millie’s neck, where the artery was.

She said, “I’ll cut here and make you bleed to death!”

“L-Lu…” Millie looked at Lucy in fear.

Assassins also had a fear of death.

“Don’t kill me. I’m begging you. Don’t kill me… Don’t… Ah!” Millie screamed.

The fear in her eyes gradually stiffened. All that was left was an empty vision, and Millie died with her eyes wide open.

Lucy got up from Millie’s body and watched as her arteries burst and blood spurted out, splattering all over her body.

Blood was still flowing out of Millie’s body, and the entire prison was dyed red.

Lucy’s eyes flickered.

She said, “Alas, I still showed you the cruelest side of me.”

At the same time, Jeanne’s eyes flickered. “That’s true.”
