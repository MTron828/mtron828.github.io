Chapter 343: Madam, Missus, Wifey, or Jeannie?

“Isn’t a marriage of convenience the same as friends with benefits?” Edward’s deep voice echoed in Jeanne’s ears.

That was when she felt his lips nibbling on her ear. Her body shuddered.

She could feel Fourth Master Swan’s determination, and she had a feeling that she could not escape him tonight.

In fact, since she had chosen to return and agreed to marry Fourth Master Swan, she had already expected to face a moment like that. However, now that it was really happening to her, she still felt…

She, too, did not know why she was holding back, but she squirmed as she silently resisted.

Then, she said, “Fourth Master, can I take a bath?”

It was useless to resist because there was no way to refuse. In that case, he ought to let her be comfortable.

The man, who was kissing her, stopped in pain and said, “I’ll help you.”

“No.” Jeanne pushed him away. “I can do it myself.”

Fourth Master Swan’s throat moved.

As their eyes met, Fourth Master Swan’s Adam’s apple bobbed up and down. She could tell that he was trying to... hold himself back.

Once he got up from her body, Jeanne was free. With her newfound freedom, she sped to the bathroom as if trying to flee.

Edward just stared at Jeanne’s back. His burning gaze was on her the entire time until suddenly, he smiled.

......

He got up, thinking he would also take a shower. Hence, he left his room and went to the room next door to take a shower.

When he came out of the shower, he was just wearing a white bathrobe.

However, back in his room, the sound of water splashing could still be heard, which meant that she was still taking a shower.

Edward smiled again, albeit faint, thinking, ‘Ms. Lawrence always knows how to torture me.’

Hence, he stood up and walked toward the balcony on that cool autumn night.

Having entered autumn, the weather in South Hampton City was starting to get cooler.

The night wind blew past him, and the coolness relaxed his tense body.

Just like that, he stood on the balcony outside, unaware of how much time had passed.

It felt like he had waited a very long time, as long as a century, until he finally heard some movements in the room.

Jeanne had really taken a long shower, trying to delay time because she knew very well that when she walked out of the bathroom, what she had to face next was... their first night together as husband and wife.

In fact, she had stopped worrying and overthinking about a thing for a long time now, but tonight…

She admitted that she had started to hesitate. She was even a little afraid.

Yet, on second thought, how ridiculous was it for her to be reserved at that point?

That was why she walked out of the bathroom in the end.

Just like Fourth Master Swan, she wore a white bathrobe and a piece of clothing that could be easily removed.

When she walked out of the bathroom, she did not see Fourth Master Swan. However, while she looked for him, she saw a tall but lonely figure standing on the balcony outside under the moonlight.

She was stunned for a second.

She did not know why the powerful Fourth Master Swan made her feel that he was... so lonely.

It was as if he was the only person in his world, or to be precise, had always been the only one.

She bit her lip and tried to compose herself. She was probably feeling guilty because she rejected him earlier.

At that, she took a deep breath.

She was the one who proposed the marriage and wanted to marry him.

Yet now, she was refusing to share a room with him. What was she trying to tell him?

Therefore, she chose to walk toward the balcony.

The man standing there stiffened for a second, but on the surface, he looked unbothered.

He did not show any emotion, so no one could see his reaction. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne stood beside him and looked in the direction he was looking at.

In the dark Bamboo Garden, she could not make out anything other than a few scattered lamps.

Edward responded, “Mm.”

“I’m sorry for making you wait so long,” she said.

It was a hint.

No, it was a clear indication.

Edward turned to look at her.

Without her high heels, Jeanne felt extremely petite in front of Fourth Master Swan. It meant that, from Fourth Master Swan’s vision, she was probably a dwarf.

She also turned her head and met Fourth Master Swan’s eyes.

Just like that, the two of them looked at each other as the wind breezed past on that quiet night.

There was a moment of silence.

“Ms. Lawrence, have you thought about it?” Eventually, Fourth Master Swan’s thin lips moved as he asked her the question.

She could not hear any emotion in his tone.

It was as if it was just a simple and direct sentence.
