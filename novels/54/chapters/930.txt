931 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

Monica choked and sobbed.

The memories of her father accompanying her in the past played in her mind like a movie.

Her father’s happiness, anger, and many other things… seemed like yesterday, but they were years ago.

“Dad, wake up.” Monica held his hand and called out to him over and over again, “Dad, I beg you to wake up. If you wake up, I’ll do anything you want. Haven’t you always wanted me to go to work? I promise you that as long as you wake up, I’ll go to the company to work and learn. I’ll help you manage the company well, and I won’t let you work so hard anymore. I’ll be very obedient in the future, okay?”

“Didn’t you always say that I’m stupid when it comes to relationships? I can’t tell who’s good to me and who’s bad to me, and I always do whatever I want. From now on, as long as you wake up and stop lying here, I’ll leave my marriage to you and my mother, okay? I’ll marry whoever you like! You’ll have the final say in the future, okay? Can you wake up? I’ll listen to you, dad…”

Monica was choking with sobs before collapsing on Gary’s bed.

At first, she did not want to make her mother too sad or too desperate, so she endured it and comforted her mother that there was still a chance for her father to wake up.

Now that there was no one else, she could not control her emotions anymore.

In fact, she was really afraid of…

She had been under the protection of her parents since she was young, so she did not know what she would become without their company.

As tears streamed down her face, she did not notice that someone had walked in from outside.

Finn appeared behind her and looked at her trembling.

She looked pitifully petite…

Finn shifted his gaze the moment he noticed something strange about Gary.

He hurried over to look at the monitor and then checked on Gary’s body.

At that moment, Monica felt Finn’s presence, and when she looked up, she saw that Finn had a different expression on his face.

It was her father. Was her father awake?

She did not dare to speak.

Then, she saw Finn very professionally performing a series of measures for his father. She did not know if he was in first aid or…

No. She could not accept her father’s death.

She would rather he just lie there forever, even if he was alive.

Monica’s tears fell like crazy. However, she bit her lips, not daring to make any sound or move.

She looked at Finn in a blur and placed all her hopes on Finn.

She did not know how long it took. It felt like forever, but it also felt like it only took a few minutes when Finn approached Gary’s ear and called out, “Uncle.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Gary did not open his eyes, but the corner of his mouth moved.

It was real. He moved.

Monica was so excited that she almost cried.

She covered her mouth, unable to believe that there were miracles in this world.

Just a second ago, she thought that all her good luck had been used up and that a miracle would never happen to her again.

“If you’re awake, move your fingers,” Finn whispered in his ear softly.

After he said that, the room was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

Monica held her breath. She was so nervous that her entire body was trembling.

At that moment, her body suddenly jerked.

She lowered her head and looked at the hand she was holding in disbelief. It moved very slightly.

Monica was so excited that she could not control herself. She said, “It moved.”

It really moved, which meant that her father was awake; her father finally woke up.

Finn nodded.

In fact, he knew that Gary had woken up. It was just that Gary’s body was too weak to react when he woke up.

Perhaps Finn had seen too much of life and death, but he spoke calmly and without the excitement Monica had. “Keep calling him and tell him not to fall asleep for the time being. It’s best if he can hold on for four hours. After four hours, we can be sure that he has really woken up.”

“Alright.” Monica quickly nodded.

Then, Finn turned around.

Monica thought that he was leaving again.

Unexpectedly, he went to the sofa beside her and leaned on it.
