1254 Standing Up For Shelly

Nox’s heart seemed to be beating even faster.

That woman was finally taking advantage of him, and it was happening right when he was going crazy from thinking about women.

Nox was cursing in his heart, but his body was honest, so honest that he did not move and just waited for Shelly…

However, Nox waited for a long time. Even when his heart was about to explode, he did not feel any movement from Shelly.

He opened his eyes and raised his head slightly, only to see Shelly pouring some essential oil on her hands and starting to massage his legs!

‘F*ck!’

Nox’s eyes were about to pop out. He had waited for her for so long, but she was just going to him a massage! That woman was crazy!

Shelly did not know what Nox was thinking, nor did she look at his expression. In her mind, Nox would not like her no matter what she did, so why would she want to look for trouble herself?

All she knew was that of all the things, helping Nox massage his legs was the only thing he would not reject her. Since he did not reject her, it meant that he enjoyed her service.

Hence, in order to cater to Nox, she could only choose what Nox liked to do.

The room fell silent.

Shelly was very serious in messaging Nox. All she did was massage his legs carefully from top to bottom.

The doctor said that in order to prevent the muscle atrophy in Nox’s legs, he had to do a lot of leg massages every day. Of course, not only would hand massages help, but many pieces of equipment could help with that too. Once equipment was used, it would be a little cruel. Sometimes, they even used electric shocks to restore the reaction in his legs. It was fine at the beginning since he did not feel anything, but now, he could feel everything.

Nox was still doing that kind of rehabilitation treatment. Every time he got off the machine, his head was covered in sweat, and his face was pale.

That was probably the only time Shelly felt good about seeing Nox weak. At the very least, Nox would not have the energy to throw a tantrum at her.

Shelly massaged Nox’s legs while thinking about some things.

Most massages would last about an hour. Unless Nox had a special request, she would not do it for a longer time. After all, every time after a massage, her back would ache and her fingers would be weak. Therefore, if she could end it early, she would. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She helped Nox put on his pants before she got up and planned to leave Nox’s bed.

She thought that Nox had calmed down. In fact, Nox’s temper was not that hard to coax. It would usually be over in a while, but he would lose his temper more often.

The moment she stood up, her body suddenly tensed up because Nox grabbed her arm with shocking strength.

Shocked, Shelly turned to look at Nox and saw his unusually cold face. He said, “That’s it?”

Did that mean he still wanted a massage?

She was really tired.

“That’s it? Shelly!” Nox was furious.

He wanted to vent all the anger he had suppressed for the past hour, and he looked very scary. However, Shelly was already used to it.

She moved her arms and said, “Let go of me.”

Nox tightened his grip on Shelly’s arm, hurting Shelly.

Nox, that man, never seemed to have any sense of propriety.

Shelly pushed Nox away, and only then did Nox let go of Shelly. With that, Shelly squatted down again and took off Nox’s pants.

The moment she planned to continue massaging him, Nox suddenly grabbed her arm. When she was not paying attention, Nox suddenly pressed her down under him.

While Shelly was still confused, she felt Nox kissing her roughly and biting her lips.

Shelly was in pain. However, with Nox pressing on her, she could not move at all.

She really did not know what Nox was up to. Nox rarely reacted to her. The only time they had been intimate was when she had shown him porn for the whole night, and it triggered some of his instincts.

Hence, at that moment… What was it now? Was he taking revenge on her on purpose?

At that moment, Nox’s brutality made it impossible for her to hold in the pain, and tears welled up in her eyes. On top of that, she could not push Nox away.

Anyway, if Nox wanted to do something to her, she would not be able to refuse, so she endured Nox’s madness.
