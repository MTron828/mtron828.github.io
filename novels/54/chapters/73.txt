“Director Lawrence, you were asked to go to the general manager’s meeting room.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She nodded slightly. “Okay.”

Then, she turned to the others. “Thirdly, I’ll set up a department dedicated to tackling the toughest problems. Regardless of whether you’re a supervisor or an employee, those who are willing can sign up with Amy.”

After she finished, she directly left the meeting room. “You’re dismissed.”

Jeanne did not drag things out.

One would not think that she was arrogant, nor would one think that she was someone to be trifled with.

Jeanne walked toward the general manager’s meeting room.

The meeting room’s door was opened.

Jeanne entered.

Many people were sitting in the meeting room. There were about 20 people.

The Lawrence Enterprise’s senior leaders were all present.

“General Manager, are you looking for me?” Jeanne was neither humble nor arrogant. She walked to Alexander’s side and asked.

Alexander frowned slightly.

Facing so many people, Jeanne did not show the slightest bit of fear. She was so calm and collected, which surprised him.

“Sit.” Alexander gestured for Jeanne to sit.

Jeanne sat at the side of the meeting room.

According to her position, she was not considered low, but she was definitely not high among this group of people. Despite that, according to her seniority, she was indeed incomparable to the others, so she knew her position very well.

After Jeanne sat, Alexander said as if he was explaining the change this time, “As the general manager of Flanders branch is unwell, he temporarily asked for a long time off to rest, so I transferred the marketing director over. It was an emergency, so I didn’t have time to discuss it with everyone. The marketing director left, and the position was vacant. For the sake of the company’s normal development, Jeanne became the current marketing director. Jeanne, please introduce yourself.”

Jeanne nodded and quickly stood up.

“Dear leaders and colleagues, hello—” Jeanne had just spoken a little when she was interrupted.

“There’s no need for introductions.” The senior president of the general affairs department, Winston Stone, directly cut her off. “Everyone knows that she’s your daughter. What else is there to introduce? It’s not that I don’t approve of you arranging for your daughter to work at the company, President Lawrence. After all, 60% of the shares of the Lawrence Enterprise are in the hands of the Lawrences. It’s perfectly normal for you to nurture your successors. However, the position of marketing director is extremely important. The entire operation of the Lawrence Enterprise is driven by the marketing department. You want to let a young girl in her twenties lead the marketing department? With all due respect, as a director and senior president of the company, I can’t agree with the executive general manager’s opinion. You’re simply using our hard work to take the fall of the Lawrences.”

“I agree with President Stone’s opinion,” the senior president of the finance department, Bryce Hoffman, said angrily, “Previously when the Lawrences arranged for Joshua, who had just graduated from university, to be the deputy director of the marketing department, we had quite an opinion. But to say the least, there was still a marketing director above Joshua, who was in charge of everything in the marketing department. In a way, someone was in charge of the overall situation. We also felt that it was common sense for Joshua to learn more from him. Now, the Lawrences acted rashly and handed the entire marketing department to a newbie who has no experience and probably doesn’t know what the workplace is like. How can we, people who have worked diligently in the Lawrence Enterprise for so many years, endure this?”

“I very much agree with the opinions of the two senior presidents,” the senior president of the human resources and public relations department, Michelle Williams, also spoke. She was very agitated. “I’ve worked in the human resources and public relations department for many years. I’m very clear about all the key leaders of all the enterprises in South Hampton City, big and small. There has never been a company that would act so recklessly and let their child take up such an important position! Most people start from the bottom and later take on important positions in the company step by step through hard work. Of course, the Lawrences of the Lawrence Enterprise can have an innate advantage, but it doesn’t mean that they can act so recklessly. According to my understanding of Jeanne, she’s just a single mother who has been drifting abroad for a few years and has a child. She has no experience in the workplace. Moreover, according to the information given to me by the human resources department, Jeanne doesn’t even have an official diploma.”

Jeanne listened to everyone’s doubts about her indifferently.

The people at the scene did not even consider Jeanne’s emotions. Michelle continued to speak in a righteous tone, “A few days ago, there were rumors that Jeanne has a close relationship with the person in charge of MUK. Everyone in South Hampton City was talking about how they looked at Jeanne in a different light. I’m sorry! I don’t think it’s something worth bragging about. With my many years of experience in human relations, a real business leader wouldn’t ruin his future just because of some so-called female confidant. Let me ask all the senior presidents here. There should be quite a number of female confidants around you. How many of them can influence your judgment in the business world? I don’t think there’s any!”

Michelle was sending a direct message to everyone present. Just because Jeanne and West had a relationship, it did not mean that things should be convenient for her. Jeanne was still useless!

Such a high-level meeting suddenly seemed to have turned into a criticism assembly.

Jeanne looked at everyone. She saw everyone’s expressions of ridicule towards her. This included Alexander and Joshua, who were gloating at her misfortune.

She smiled and said without batting an eyelid, “I accept all the doubts that everyone had toward me just now. For a person who’s only 25 years old to suddenly take over such an important position, if I was in your shoes, I would have the same attitude as you. This is not to go against anyone or to show my authority. It’s just out of a sense of responsibility towards the company.”

The words that were spoken neither too fast nor too slow shocked everyone.

Who would have thought that under such circumstances, Jeanne would still be able to face everything so calmly? There seemed to be a hidden meaning in her words.

On one hand, she seemed to be reminding everyone not to target anyone too much and not to be aggressive just because of their high position and power. At the same time, she seemed to be giving everyone a way out. It was all based on the premise of “responsibility”. It made the people at the scene feel that there was no way to refute it.

Jeanne continued to say, “Before entering the Lawrence Enterprise, I’ve heard a lot about the enterprise’s development. It said that our business is old-fashioned now. As an electrical appliance industry, we’re still relying on the traditional offline sales model. Our solid users are still a group of former diehard fans, but most of those diehard fans are already over 40 years old. We don’t have much of a market share for the young people. What does this mean?”

Everyone looked at Jeanne. Thinking that she was useless, no one thought that she would say something so professional.

At this moment, the scene was a little quiet.

Jeanne spoke frankly, “This means that our company needs fresh blood. Not only do we need to expand the market, but we also need new people to give the company an impact. Before I achieve something, I can’t guarantee what I can bring to the company. However, in front of so many senior presidents, mark my words. Within a month, I’ll win the exclusive partnership with MUK, the e-commerce company, in Harken. After two months, the Lawrence Enterprise’s volume of business will double on that basis. The market share of 25 to 35-year-olds will reach a third of the Lawrence Enterprise’s total user base!”

Right after she finished, everyone was shocked.

Jeanne paused, then added with a strong aura, “Otherwise, I’ll take the blame and resign!”
