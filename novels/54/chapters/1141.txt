1142 The War Has Started: Finn in Danger

Finn picked up his phone again and called his assistant. “Inform Gary’s family to come to my office.”

The assistant looked at the phone in a daze.

Gary’s family? Was that not Monica? Would it not be better for him to tell Monica, his ex-wife?

Of course, his assistant only dared to tease him in his heart. With Dr. Jones and his aloof attitude lately, he did not dare to joke around.

After a short while, someone knocked on Finn’s door.

He raised his head and saw Monica standing politely at the door. “Dr. Jones, are you looking for me?”

Her tone was distant, polite, and even a little respectful.

Finn did not show any reaction. Instead, he nodded. “I want to talk to you about your father’s treatment.”

“Alright.”

Monica walked over to Finn and sat opposite him.

Finn took out a treatment plan and said, “I’ve already sought help from international medical institutions for your father’s illness. They’ll come to the hospital next Monday to treat your father. According to the situation I’ve provided and the answer they gave me, there is a 60 percent chance that your father will wake up.”

At that, Monica still got a little emotional.

She had no hope that her father would wake up, but now that she suddenly had a glimmer of hope, she could not help but feel a little excited.

“They are very professional in this field. Many cases of patients waking up happened because of them.” Finn continued, “So, there’s a high possibility that your father’s condition will turn for the better.”

“What do I need to do?” Monica tried her best to control her emotions.

“Just cooperate with the hospital for treatment.” Finn said bluntly, “And prepare enough money for the treatment.”

“Alright.” Monica agreed immediately.

“There’s another thing.” Finn suddenly fell silent.

Monica looked at him.

To be honest, as a patient’s family, she was most afraid of a doctor’s silence. She felt that silence contained too many uncertainties.

“I have some personal matters to attend to, so I might not be there for your father’s upcoming treatment,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica was stunned.

What did he mean? Did Finn say that he would not be part of her father’s treatment plan from now on?

“He’s the person in charge of the international medical team. This is his photo, and his phone number is on the back. I’ve already told him about you, so you can look for him directly for anything related to your father. On top of that, the cardiology expert, Dr. Curtis, will be your father’s new attending doctor, and I’ve handed over your father’s case to him. If you have any problems, you can also look for him directly.”

“Does that mean you’re resigning?” Monica asked.

Did something big happen that he had to resign?

“Sort of,” Finn said.

It could be considered a resignation. After all, he would not be coming to the hospital for a long time.

As for whether he would have the chance to come to the hospital again, that would depend on his fate.

Anyway, it was not up to him to decide.

“Why now?” Monica asked him.

Why did he have to resign at this time?

Could he not delay it for a few days?

She did not think that the other doctors were not capable enough. Rather, it was just that Finn had always been her father’s attending doctor and knew everything about her father’s condition. She was not sure if the other doctors could do as well as Finn.

However, Finn did not answer Monica.

There were many things that he could not tell her.

“Is it because you broke up with Sarah?” Monica asked.

She really did not expect that a breakup would make Finn make such a decision.

She had originally thought that Finn and Sarah did not have any feelings for each other. Yet, now that Sarah had dumped him, he could not accept it?

“If it is, I can help you persuade Sarah. She’s still young, and her feelings are unstable. I believe that if I persuade her and you coax her, she won’t fall in love with someone else–”

“It has nothing to do with her,” Finn interrupted her. “It’s my own private matter. You don’t have to guess.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“If that’s the case, can you not resign now?” Monica asked him, trying to make herself look calm.

Could he not stay until the medical team arrived in South Hampton City?

Could he not wait until her father’s condition had really improved before resigning?

Must he leave now?

“No,” Finn replied.

Monica’s throat moved.

In fact, she knew very well that she had never had a say when it came to Finn. She could not convince him of anything, and he would never listen to her.
