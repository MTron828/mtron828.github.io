1026 It’s Not Worth It For Kingsley

Jeanne did not say anything and just looked at Kingsley. She really wanted to see how Kingsley would feel!

To force a woman, who loved him so much, to a corner, did he have the heart to do that?

Did he have the heart to force a woman, who loved him so much, to be backed into a corner?

He probably did. After all, Kingsley’s expression was still cold, and he was unmoved by Lucy’s explanation.

At that moment, people might even think that he did not believe everything Lucy said.

Lucy also seemed to think that no matter how she explained herself, Kingsley would not believe her.

At least for so many years, among the assassins of the Hills, there were many who had been drugged or had taken the drug on their own initiative, but none of them endured it on their own.

She said, “If you really want to teach him a lesson, give it to me.”

She knew that she could not explain herself, so she chose to bear the responsibility.

“It was me who overestimated myself and chose to use this method to expose all the suffering that Millie has caused me. It has nothing to do with Kerby. Mr. Thorn, as the head of the Hills, I hope you can handle this matter fairly.”

“Fairly?” Kingsley glared at Lucy.

“Even if I did it with Kerby, it was my fault. I was the reason we disobeyed your orders. I’ll take responsibility for my actions, and I’m willing to accept any punishment!”

“So, you admit that you did it with Kerby,” Kingsley said, and his tone was cold.

“Whatever you say is right.” Lucy did not answer directly, but she gave a very respectful answer.

In the Hills, whatever Kingsley said was true.

She had said so much just now, only to… make a fool of herself.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed, and he became even more hostile.

He said, “So you’re willing to accept all the punishment for Kerby?”

“It’s not for him. It’s just that this matter has nothing to do with him, and the innocent shouldn’t be implicated. Mr. Thorn, you’re the leader of the Hills, and your every move represents the dignity of the Hills. You can’t ruin your reputation over such a trivial matter,” Lucy said sincerely.

She was also very smart to make Kingsley the good guy so that he had no reason to reject her request.

Jeanne pursed her lips and believed that Lucy would give up on Kingsley one day.

“To protect Kerby, you can think of anything.” Of course, Kingsley would not be so easily convinced.

In his world, there were no morals, no limits, or principles. As long as he wanted to, he could kill anyone, and there was no need for a reason!

Lucy’s throat moved slightly.

She was trying to keep calm.

That matter indeed had nothing to do with Kerby, so she could not let him suffer in vain.

Assassins were ruthless, but she would never betray anyone!

Just as Lucy was thinking about how to change Kingsley’s mind, Kingsley suddenly said, “Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

Lucy was visibly stunned for a few seconds, and she looked at Kingsley in disbelief.

Kingsley furrowed his brows. “Why? Are you regretting it?”

“No!” Lucy quickly replied. She was even a little anxious. “Mr. Thorn, please punish me!”

Kingsley’s expression was extremely ugly as he asked, “How do you think I should punish you?”

Lucy was stunned.

The next second, she walked straight to Kingsley’s bedside table, knowing that other than a pistol, there was also a dagger inside.

She took out a dagger and said, “Ever since I was young, I’ve loved to look beautiful. Even though I’ve become an assassin, I still love and cherish this face of mine. Now… I’m going to destroy it!”

She had offered what was most precious to her to make a deal and show her greatest sincerity. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She gritted her teeth and pointed the sharp dagger at her own face. Then, she cruelly drew a deep cut on it.

From the left side of her forehead to the right side of her cheek, a trail of blood covered her entire face.

It happened so fast that neither Jeanne nor Kingsley could react in time.

By the time they came back to their senses, they saw the blood on Lucy’s face and the blood dripping down the dagger she had put down.

Kingsley clenched into fists tightly, as if he was holding himself back.

Jeanne was also clearly holding herself back.

She did not expect Lucy to take it so far.

Perhaps Lucy was afraid that Kingsley would go back on his word, so she did not want to waste even a second. Otherwise, Jeanne might have been able to stop her.

The room fell silent. It was as if the air had frozen.

Jeanne did not know what to say at that moment, and Kingsley was probably so angry that he could not say a word.

Lucy, on the other hand, was just waiting for Kingsley’s response on the way she dealt with the matter.

As time passed, Lucy’s face started bleeding even more, and half of her face was dyed red.

Jeanne could not stand it anymore, so she asked, “Is that enough?”

Kingsley’s throat moved up and down.

Then, he turned around and turned his back to them coldly. He said, “Get lost!”

“Thank you, Mr. Thorn,” Lucy said respectfully.

She thanked him because she wanted to remind him once again that he should not pursue the matter.

Lucy was always smart enough to know how to achieve her goal.

Jeanne pulled Lucy along and left.

After they left, a loud noise came from Kingsley’s room. It was obvious that Kingsley was venting his anger.

Jeanne and Lucy stopped in their tracks for a second.

Every time Kingsley lost his temper, it was terrifying.

However, he had never vented his anger on himself. The moment he got angry, others would suffer.

Yet now, he was obviously self-destructing!

“Let’s go.” Jeanne said, “He deserves it.”

Lucy did not think that Kingsley deserved it, but she thought it was better to escape because Kingsley might really kill her in the next second.

When they returned to their room, Jeanne quickly took out the first aid kit that she had just put aside and helped Lucy stop the bleeding. “Should I send you to Mike? He should know how to prevent your wound from leaving any scars.”

“No.” Lucy shook her head. “Since I did it to destroy my face, there has to be a scar. Otherwise, Kingsley will have ten thousand reasons to torture me again!”

“When that day comes, leave Kingsley,” Jeanne suddenly said seriously while treating her wound.

Lucy’s eyes flickered.

Of course, she understood what Jeanne meant and knew what Jeanne was talking about. However, she chose to remain silent.

“Don’t work for him!” Jeanne continued, “It’s not worth it.”

It really was not worth it for a heartless man like Kingsley.
