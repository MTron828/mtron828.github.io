Chapter 1569: The Confession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

No wonder it took a lot longer than usual for them to buy some water. Fortunately, everyone was chatting and laughing, so they did not take it to heart.

“Ms. Hansen, you should learn more from Mr. Jones,” the person in charge said.

“Yes.” Wendy immediately agreed.

However, in her heart, she knew Finn treated Monica well because they were a couple. If the chairman was her husband, she would be as attentive as well.

The group sat for a while before strolling around the scenic area again.

“Is that some kind of craftsmanship?” Monica asked curiously when she saw an old lady showing off something.

“Yes, the traditional women of Casterbridge know embroidery. However, due to the development of the times, the skill has been lost. Generally, only old women embroider, as well as some families who insist on passing down their skills. If you’re interested, Director Cardellini, we can go over and take a look. They’re all handmade,” the tour guide introduced.

Monica walked over. In front of her were some small embroidery pieces that looked extremely exquisite.

Before Monica could reach out her hand, Finn had reached out to take a pair of baby shoes made with cloth. The red cloth shoes were embroidered with dragons, and because they were very small, they looked extremely cute.

“How much is this?” Finn asked.

After the old lady told him the price, he said, “Two pairs, please.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Then, he paid for them.

When the person in charge saw Finn’s actions, he could not help but tease, “Is Mr. Jones’s girlfriend pregnant?”

Finn did not answer. However, the smile on his face was obvious. Now, Wendy was even more certain that Finn and Monica had an extraordinary relationship.

“Do you want both pairs in red?” the old woman asked.

“Both,” Finn replied.

Just as the old lady was about to pack the bag, Monica suddenly said, “A pair of black.”

The old woman was stunned. Finn, too, glanced at Monica.

“Maybe it’s not a girl,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn pursed his lips. “A pair of red and a pair of black then.”

“Alright.” The old woman picked out two pairs and wrapped them up for him.

Finn took it as if it was very important to him.

“Director Cardellini, do you want to buy some?” The person in charge quickly asked, “Aren’t you pregnant too? You can start buying some stuff for the baby. Many families in Casterbridge like to use hand-sewn clothes because it’s much more comfortable and thoughtful in some ways.”

“No need.” Monica refused since Finn had bought it.

The person in charge did not try to persuade her. After all, although it was handmade, the style was still far inferior to the clothes in high-end clothing stores.

They had fun for most of the afternoon, and Monica was also a little tired, so she went straight back to the hotel for dinner. After dinner, they naturally returned to their respective rooms.

She would be returning home tomorrow. If nothing went wrong, she would return to Harken directly.

Ultimately, no matter where in the world she traveled to, she would yearn of going home after a few days. She always felt that home was the place where she could really feel at ease and relax.

After Monica showered, she lay on the bed. Surprisingly, Finn did not come over tonight. Clearly…

Forget it. She did not want Finn to come to her room either. She had not been able to fall asleep every night because he had been hugging her like a bear. With that, she lay on the bed and tried her best to sleep.

Under the night sky, Finn went to the night market in the scenic area with Wendy.

Wendy brought Finn to a shop specializing in handmade clothes. Wendy said, “This shop has the most complete collection of handmade clothes, and the selection is huge. Many of our people here like to buy baby products from them.”

Finn nodded before he began to choose the clothes. Wendy was also helping him by giving her opinion.

In the end, Finn chose quite a few pieces of clothing. However, he also considered that he had to bring them back himself, so he restricted himself within a reasonable range.

“Mr. Jones, are you sure you want both red and pink? Shouldn’t you pick a few blue ones? What if the baby is a boy? Wouldn’t you feel bad for baby if he wore pink?”

“It should be a girl.” Finn was very certain.

“No one can say for sure before the baby is born.” Wendy reminded him. “I even heard that ultrasound scans are sometimes wrong.”

Finn paused for a moment, probably thinking what Wendy said made sense. Then, he said, “Give me a blue one.”

“Only one set?” the staff asked.

“One set is enough.”

Wendy was speechless. She felt sorry for the boy if the baby was a boy.

After they bought clothes, the two of them returned to the hotel together. Seeing that Finn was carrying two big bags, Wendy said, “Let me help you with one.”

“No need. It’s not heavy.”

“Mr. Jones, are you that cold to everyone?” Wendy asked nonchalantly.

Since she had already guessed the relationship between Finn and Monica, she was not so evil as to ruin their relationship.

“Am I very cold?” Finn suddenly asked.

Wendy felt a little awkward when he asked that question seriously.

She thought for a moment and said, “It just feels like you’re not easy to approach. Actually, it’s not that bad. You’re not that difficult to get along with.”

She was very tactful with her words.

Finn nodded. He, too, knew that Wendy was just being polite.

The two of them chatted all the way back. Most of the time, it was Wendy who asked the questions while Finn answered.

The reason why Finn wanted to answer was because he did not want to be a cold person. After all, Monica hated his coldness.

They chatted and laughed, but the two of them suddenly stopped in their tracks when they saw Monica standing at the door of Finn’s room.

At that moment, she was hesitating whether she should knock on the door or not. However, when she turned around and saw Finn and Wendy returning to their rooms, she was taken aback..
