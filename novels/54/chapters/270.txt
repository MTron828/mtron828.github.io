Chapter 271: I Want to Pamper You With All My Life

Finn did not know whether it was because of his physical quality that the Swans took a fancy to him.

They secretly trained him.

At least, he could recklessly stand in front of Fourth Master Swan in the face of danger.

After all, he did not feel pain.

So, he would not have the fear of death.

He would not fear any pain.

Of course, Finn was actually grateful to the Swans. If it was not for the Swans, he might not have survived in the orphanage!

Therefore, he would be loyal to them with his life.

Finn drove to the hospital again.

As for Monica…

Monica was probably the only woman in his life that caused him to develop personal feelings when he thought that he should devote his life to the Swans.

She was the only woman he could not let go of.

Finn walked into her ward.

His footsteps suddenly stopped.

He looked at the ward. Micheal was holding Monica’s hand. Monica seemed to be asleep, and Micheal was accompanying her.

When Finn previously left the ward, he had returned the phone to Monica.

He was afraid that she would be lonely in the hospital alone. Moreover, the phone was a communication device. If she encountered any danger, she could at least ask for help.

However, he was too presumptuous.

Monica took the phone and only dialed Micheal’s number.

Finn turned around.

He felt that his existence was a little redundant.

Finn had always thought that he could fight for himself first. Perhaps after everything settled down, he could still have his own life and happiness.

It turned out that he was still thinking too much.

From the moment he was abandoned by his parents, he seemed destined to be abandoned forever.

…

The next day, Jeanne opened her eyes.

She did not know what time it was.

She only knew that the sky was very bright outside and that she was very lazy.

It was as if she had slept for a century.

She moved her body slightly and tried to get up.

After sleeping for too long, her body became weak.

When she moved her body slightly, it hurt…

She almost cried out.

Jeanne almost forgot that she was seriously injured last night. Today, her whole body was covered in bandages.

Fortunately, they were all external injuries.

External injuries usually took ten days to half a month to recover.

“You’re awake?” A male voice was suddenly heard.

Jeanne’s body tensed up.

She was in a daze.

The next second, she came back to her senses.

She was on Fourth Master Swan’s bed.

Yes,

Fourth Master Swan had brought her here directly last night.

Jeanne wanted to turn around.

“Don’t move.” Fourth Master Swan suddenly approached her and whispered in her ear, “You have injuries on your body.”

Jeanne’s heart was beating faster.

She told herself to calm down.

She could not be confused by this man just because she had just woken up and her mind was wandering.

Jeanne said, “I want to get up.”

“Are you hungry?” Edward asked.

His lips were right next to her ear, gently emitting hot air.

Jeanne could even imagine how hot and red her ears were at the moment.

Especially when she felt that she was naked under the blanket.

What was more, Jeanne was under the blanket with Fourth Master Swan. Even though she did not feel his body approaching her, there was a strong sense of oppression.

Jeanne tensed up her body and did not reply.

She did not reply but heard him say, “I’m hungry, so hungry that...”

Jeanne’s heart moved.

She felt Fourth Master Swan’s lips completely approaching her earlobe. He bit down on her small earlobe.

It did not hurt.

Jeanne just felt his teeth gently rubbing against her earlobe.

She gripped the bedsheet tightly.

Jeanne felt that even if Fourth Master Swan were to f*ck her at this time... she would not be able to resist.

Her body was stiff.

Jeanne listened to Fourth Master Swan bite her for quite a while before he whispered in her ear, “I want to eat you.”

Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.

Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.

Jeanne’s heartbeat was irregular and wild.

She felt that Fourth Master Swan was very dangerous at this moment. His body was emitting an aura of desire, causing her to be a little frightened.

Jeanne felt that a person like Fourth Master Swan was capable of doing anything.

When she was clearly getting a little too nervous, the aura around her disappeared in an instant. At that moment, she felt a cool breeze as Fourth Master Swan suddenly got up from the bed and lifted the blanket.

Jeanne quietly adjusted her emotions to make herself look calm.

Fourth Master Swan got down from the bed.

He walked in front of her, completely naked.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly, and she turned to the side.

Edward was actually just passing by. He passed by and went to the cloakroom.

When he came out, there was a blue bathrobe on his body and a pink bathrobe in his hand.

He returned to Jeanne’s side and lifted the blanket…

Jeanne grabbed the blanket tightly.

Fourth Master Swan looked at her.

“I’ll wear it myself.” Jeanne was very determined.

Fourth Master Swan smiled.

When he smiled, Jeanne was a little dazed.

Everyone loved beauty.

Fourth Master Swan’s appearance could make any woman’s heart flutter.

“I’ve seen it all.” He was clearly teasing Jeanne with his attractive voice.

Jeanne’s face was red.

Even so, she did not compromise.

Edward smiled again. He placed the bathrobe in front of Jeanne, then he got up and walked to the bathroom as if he had gone to wash up himself.

Jeanne watched Edward leave the room before she sat up on the bed with difficulty. Enduring the pain, she put on the bathrobe that Fourth Master Swan had prepared for her.

She got out of bed.

Her body was weak.

Jeanne did not know if she had slept for too long.

She stood there for a while before she stabilized herself and walked towards the bathroom.

The bathroom door was not closed.

Jeanne did not think about what Fourth Master Swan would do in there. She saw him standing in front of the toilet... peeing.

He was peeing…

Jeanne was embarrassed.

She looked completely embarrassed.

Jeanne did not know if it was because she had used up too much energy last night, which caused her to be in a state of unconsciousness today.

She knew that the first thing everyone did when they woke up was to go to the toilet, but she still went to the bathroom so casually.

It was not entirely her fault!

Who would go to the toilet and leave the door open?

Jeanne turned around and was about to leave.

“I don’t mind.” The man who was peeing was not embarrassed at all.

‘I mind.

‘I f*cking mind.

‘I’m afraid that my eyes will hurt!’

Jeanne was furious. At this moment, she saw that the man had clearly finished peeing. He put down his bathrobe, which covered his penis.

Next, along with the sound of the toilet flushing, Edward walked toward Jeanne and carried her up.

Jeanne was speechless.

She had arms and legs. She did not need anyone to serve her like this.

What made her even more speechless was that Fourth Master Swan carried her directly onto the toilet bowl.

The two of them were not wearing anything inside, so it was surprisingly convenient for them to go to the toilet.

Jeanne sat on the toilet bowl and looked at Fourth Master Swan.

“Go ahead and pee,” Edward said in a straightforward manner.

“Fourth Master, do you have a habit of watching people pee?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

“Only if it’s you.”

“...”

“I’ll turn around.” Due to Jeanne’s death stare, Edward compromised.

He only did not look.

However, he would not leave.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

In the end, it was difficult to hold in her pee. As such, he did it in front of, no, behind Fourth Master Swan’s back.

The sound of Jeanne’s pee made her face and ears turn red.

On the other hand, the man who was standing in front of her had a calm expression on his face.

After a long time, Jeanne was done. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She got up.

The toilet automatically flushed.

Jeanne went to the sink and planned to wash up.

Who knew, she was carried up again.

She was picked up and placed directly on the spacious sink.

Jeanne stared at Fourth Master Swan.

“I’ll help you.”

“I’m not crippled.”

“I know.” Fourth Master Swan was indifferent as if he could not hear the anger in her words.

Jeanne was a little angry.

At this moment, she heard Fourth Master Swan say, “I want to pamper you.”

‘With all my life.’
