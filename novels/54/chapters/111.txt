Edward brought Teddy into the private room that Eden had booked.

Eden was already in the room. When he saw Edward, he quickly went forward. “Uncle Edward.”

Edward nodded slightly.

The waiter respectfully pulled out the dining chair for Edward and invited him to sit down.

After Edward sat down, Eden sat next to him.

“I heard that Uncle Edward likes this restaurant very much, so I booked this place.” Eden quickly said. “According to Uncle Edward’s usual preferences, I also ordered the dishes that you might like.”

“Okay,” Edward responded.

Eden quickly poured the wine himself. “Uncle Edward, let me toast you first.”

Edward did not refuse.

He drank with Eden just like that.

Throughout the entire process, Eden appeared to be extremely proactive.

After three rounds of wine and five different dishes, Eden began to suck up to him. “Uncle Edward, I really admire you. The Swans have so many properties including real estate, multimedia, banks, logistics, restaurants, hotels, and even communications and transportation. How did you manage them all by yourself? Now that you have handed over the bank to me, I am already extremely busy.”

“Spend more time and put in more effort,” Edward said bluntly. “If a person is unable to take care of things by himself, he must then cultivate his own confidants.”

“Yes.”

“Your birth has destined you to be a manager in the future. So now, other than familiarizing yourself with your current domain, the more important thing is to cultivate talents.”

“Uncle Edward is right. During this period of time, I have been busy improving my business ability and have not managed to train anyone. I will definitely work on this.”

“Finn Jones has been working in the Swanhaven Bank for many years and he is extremely loyal. If you have any difficulties, you can look for him to help you.”

“Okay.” Eden agreed. However, he was feeling a little guilty at that moment.

Ever since he took over, he had been targeting Finn everywhere.

Finn relied on his seniority and tended to question Eden’s decisions. Eden saw Finn as a thorn and decided to get him out of the Swanhaven Bank sooner or later.

Moreover, Finn was his Uncle Edward’s trusted aide. If he did not chase this person away, his every move would be right under his uncle’s nose.

He would not have much of a future if Finn remained in the bank.

“Uncle Edward, I must say that I really do respect you. In the future, I hope you will continue to guide me. I also want to contribute more to the Swans.”

“If you have any difficulties, you can look for me.” Edward said.

In the end.

The Swan Enterprise belonged to the Swans, not Edward alone.

Sooner or later, these industries would need to be passed down.

Eden Swan had the capabilities. If he was properly nurtured, he could make a difference. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The two of them kept drinking.

Eden was especially proactive tonight. He did not eat much, but he drank quite a lot.

By then, Eden was already feeling a little dizzy.

Eden’s alcohol tolerance was actually not bad. He had basically never gotten drunk in front of his friends. However, even though he was drunk now, his Uncle Edward’s expression did not change.

If he wanted to get his Uncle Edward drunk and create an opportunity for him to interact with Melody, it might not be possible after all.

He stood up from the chair. “Uncle Edward, I’m going to the washroom.”

“Okay.”

Eden Swan rushed into the washroom in a hurry and vomited.

On the dining table in the private room.

“Teddy.” Edward ate the food slowly.

“Fourth Master, what are your orders?”

“What do you think of Eden Swan?”

“You mean the Eldest Young Master Swan’s alcohol tolerance?” Teddy guessed.

“Character.”

“Uh...” Teddy did not dare to say.

Edward also did not make things difficult for him.

He got up. “Go pay for the bill. Let’s go.”

“Yes.” Teddy went out.

Just as he opened the door, he bumped into a woman outside the door.

Teddy hurriedly stepped back.

“I heard that Edward is here,” Melody asked Teddy.

Teddy turned to look at his Fourth Master.

Edward glanced at Melody.

Melody did not ask for permission and walked straight in.

“I’m eating here too.” Melody took the initiative to start a conversation.

Edward naturally did not believe it, but he also did not expose her.

She was an unimportant person, and what she did was none of his business.

“Edward, I heard that you like the food in this restaurant very much, so I specially came over to have a taste.” Melody naturally sat beside Edward. “The taste is indeed good. I like it very much.”

At this moment, Edward put down his bowl and chopsticks. “Miss Sanders, you can eat more if you like. Now that I have finished eating, I will take my leave first.”

“Edward.” Melody grabbed his arm.

Edward frowned slightly.

“You clearly know that I just want to spend more time with you. I have worked so hard to get close to you, and I have worked so hard to understand your preferences. Why can’t you give me a chance to get close to you?” Melody’s eyes were slightly red while she asked Edward.
