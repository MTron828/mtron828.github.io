Chapter 1518: Side Story: Lucy, I Want You To Like Me

That was why she chose to approach him that way.

Kingsley stared at her flushed face. If not for her charming expression and practiced movements, he would have thought that she was very innocent and shy at that moment.

The success rate of female assassins’ using that method would usually be high.

If he had not deliberately set up a trap for her to kill him, based on what she had done tonight, he would not have discovered her identity as an assassin.

In his previous life, in order to make her his assassin, he used her as bait to make her walk into his trap. In this life, it was because… he wanted her.

That was right. He had been reborn. The funny thing was that the moment he thought he was dead, he opened his eyes, and it was six years ago.

Six years ago, Jeanne had just been brought back to the Hills, and Lucy was not yet his assassin. It made him wonder if that was a chance for him to atone for his sins.

The only thing he wanted to do after he was reborn was to bring Lucy back to his side to love her and not to use her.

Jeanne once said that Lucy would become one of his regrets. Although he said that would never happen, he only knew the moment he died that it was his long-cherished wish.

When he died, his mind was filled with Lucy, who died before him. Therefore, he did not resist it when he died.

Although he really wanted to be able to accompany Jeanne, worried that Jeanne would not be able to accept his death, he finally felt relieved. Jeanne had her own path to walk, and he believed that she could walk it on her own.

What he wanted more was to die with Lucy. It was probably because he regretted never admitting that he had fallen in love with Lucy. Even at the moment of his death, he did not apologize to Lucy.

He did not know if it was because of that strong obsession that God had given him a chance to start over. However, since they were starting over, he would definitely not leave any regrets in his life.

His eyes were fixed on the living Lucy in front of him. The 25-year-old Lucy was not much different from the 32-year-old Lucy. They were both young and beautiful. The only change was the way she looked at him.

The Lucy who looked at him now may be vigilant and guarded, but she did not have the helplessness and compromise from many years ago. She did not follow his orders, nor did she have any expectations of him or feel resistance toward him.

He stretched out his hand, and his slender fingers lifted her chin.

“Do you want to?” he asked her. Did she want to sleep with him?

“Yes.” Lucy smiled. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He knew very well that she was lying to him, but he realized that he could not refuse.

He said, “In that case, go take a shower.”

Lucy smiled. “I’ve already washed up. If you don’t believe me, you can smell the shower gel on my body.”

“Wash that drug off your body,” Kingsley said bluntly.

The smile on Lucy’s face froze for a second.

That was right. She had smeared a layer of colorless and odorless poison on her body. Once he inhaled a certain amount of it, his heart would stop, and he would die instantly.

It was impossible for an assassin to trust just someone. The only way for them to protect themselves was to save themselves.

In fact, she did not believe it. Would Kingsley really be so kind as to take her back to the Delta Islands and keep her alive?

She bit her lip lightly, but before she could react, Kingsley had already bent down and picked her up. Lucy turned to look at him and watched as he put her directly into the luxurious bathtub in the luxurious hotel.

Kingsley cleaned her from head to toe, which meant that all the weapons she had that could protect herself were destroyed. She could only be at the mercy of others.

Then, Kingsley carried her back to the bed, where Lucy lay under him, unable to refuse or resist.

She watched as his face got closer and closer to hers. The moment he kissed

her lips, she heard him say, “If you don’t want to do it anymore, push me away.”

Lucy was speechless. ‘Who the hell is the man in front of me?’

Would Kingsley be so kind as to ask for someone else’s permission? He did not just ask for her permission, but he even cared about her feelings.

She thought that her first time would be earth-shattering. After all, although she had seduced him, a man like Kingsley would be kind to her.

However, she felt that the man was extremely gentle throughout the entire process…
