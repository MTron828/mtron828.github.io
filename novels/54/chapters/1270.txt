1271 Edward’s Rise and Alex’s Defeat

“Big liar,” George said suddenly.

With a choked voice, he finally could not hold it in anymore and burst into tears.

“Yes, I’m a big liar.” Edward nodded.

“You and my mother are both big liars!” George kept crying. He glared at his father and the black and white photo, “Didn’t you promise me that you would grow up with me? Didn’t you promise me that you’ll live with me? Didn’t you promise me that even if the whole world left me, you would never leave me?! Liar, liar, liar!”

Pointing to Jeanne’s photo, George vented all his emotions.

Really... tragic.

That was the pain that he should not have to bear at such a young age!

That day, George stood guard in front of Jeanne’s grave, crying until the sky fell apart.

That day, Edward hugged the weeping George and left Jeanne’s grave.

It was dark when they left.

Edward looked back at the black and white photo, and saw that she seemed to be smiling at him.

The wind blew the dust and sand on the ground and whisked up the fallen leaves, blocking his vision.

The vision in front of him had long been blurred.

Jeanne did not want to...see him.

George left the next day.

He hugged Paige before leaving on his own.

Edward refused to send him off and only watched his back as he left.

He looked at George’s small frame who got into the black car and left without turning back.

He probably did not deserve to be called a father.

A month later, Susan moved into Bamboo Garden.

She and Edward now officially lived together.

Half a year later, Susan gave birth to Edward’s daughter, and the whole country celebrated together.

Monica just watched the news on the phone, and at that moment, she really endured and did not drop the phone!

So, she conceived in October, and was pregnant for half a year.

That meant that when Jeanne just died, Edward and Susan fell in love and slept with each other. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

If she were Jeanne, she would call that fraud.

One year later, Edward and Susan held a wedding ceremony.

On the wedding day, Edward rebelled.

When William appeared at the wedding scene as Gates’ eldest son, he was detained by Edward on the spot and sent to prison.

A year and a half later, William was suspected of multiple homicide cases, abuse of power, and private misappropriation of state finances. He was sentenced to death with a twenty-year reprieve, and his personal property and all property of the Gates family were confiscated.

Alex was sent to a special prison.

Rather than a prison, it was better to describe it as a courtyard house where people are imprisoned.

It had everything you needed, including servants.

When Edward walked into this courtyard, it was half a year since Alex fell from his throne.

With the support of the masses and courtiers, Edward took the position of chief of Harken.

So far, the country’s surname was changed from Gates to Swan.

When Edward arrived, Alex was sitting on the lawn of the courtyard, basking in the sun, accompanied by Susan.

The two turned to look at him at the same time and saw him walking up to them alone.

“You’re here.” Alex’s voice was very soft with no hint of emotion.

Edward nodded slightly.

“Susan, make me a cup of tea.”

“Alright.”

In fact, he just wanted Susan to leave.

Susan was not oblivious, she turned and walked into the main room, and then looked at the two people from a distance, one tall and one short in the yard.

“How are your legs?” Edward asked proactively.

“Shouldn’t you know better?” Alex sneered.

At that time, Alex was detained by Edward at the wedding, because he tried to escape, so he aimed a gun directly at his leg. He did not receive the appropriate reasonable treatment and succumbed to the injury. He was not completely disabled, but he was walking with a limp. When it was raining, the pain would arise.

“I’m the chief now.” Edward cut to the chase.

A ceremony was held today.

“I saw it,” Alex said bluntly.

“I didn’t expect that one day we would turn out like this,” Edward said.

His eyes looked at the clear sky, and there was not much emotion on his stern face.

Alex did not respond.

Edward continued, “When I was young, what I heard the most was to be loyal to you and your family. This is why I was born. If it wasn’t for the cause of the Chief’s family, I would not exist. So for a long time, I really believed that I should do everything for your family and you in this life. I was trained and experimented on crazily, and madly suppressed all my emotions. There is no meaning in anything I do.”
