Even if Finn hated her after he woke up, she did not care. The most important thing was that once they had sex, Finn had to be responsible for her.

As long as they could be together, she was confident that Finn would like her.

Her lips were so close to Finn’s lips.

The second they were about to touch, her body was suddenly pushed away.

Taken aback by the push, she rolled to the ground. It hurt so much that she could not get up for a long time.

By the time she could move, she saw Finn suddenly get up from the bed and was about to leave.

Without thinking, Sarah ran over and hugged Finn. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Finn’s expression was cold.

However, his face and entire body were flushed red. Even his forehead was drenched in sweat, dripping down non-stop.

His body’s reaction was obvious.

The moment he woke up, he could feel the reaction in his body and could go crazy with his desire to vent.

However, when he saw someone approaching in front of him, he instinctively pushed her away.

He did not even know who the woman was.

His current physical condition seemed to have made him lose the ability to think. As such, he instinctively walked away.

However, just as he took two steps, someone suddenly hugged him.

His body was obviously wanting it, but he was also forcing himself not to lose his mind.

“Finn, I like you,” Sarah confessed behind him.

In fact, Finn did not even hear it. His mind was blank, and his hearing and vision seemed gone.

The only thing he had now was a thought, a crazy thought, but he restrained himself.

Sarah could only feel Finn’s stiff body but not his rejection of her.

Therefore, she boldly reached her little hand into Finn’s clothes. She caressed his body naked, and only then did she realize how hot his body was.

She almost jumped, but she controlled her heart rate and caressed his body bit by bit, feeling Finn’s boiling temperature across her palm…

She also realized that Finn had abdominal muscles.

She did not know if it was because of the medicine, but his abdominal muscles were bulging. She used her hand to feel it and realized there were really eight packs.

At that moment, her heart beat faster.

She felt she was even more excited than Finn, who had taken the drug.

With that, she became bolder and bolder. She pulled her hand out of Finn’s clothes, walked up to Finn, and started to undo his pants.

She lowered her head, and just as she was undoing his belt seriously, she shouted, “Ah!”

It was because someone had suddenly pulled her up violently with a jerk. It was so strong that it almost made her fly into the air.

In the next second, she felt someone dragging her out of the door.

Sarah resisted as she said, “Finn, let go of me. Let go of me. I want to sleep with you! Mm!”

It seemed like Finn had heard it but not at the same time.

He was actually hallucinating the entire time, and his mind was in a trance. When his consciousness started to return to him, he could feel that someone was trying to take his pants off again. At that moment, he instinctively rejected any woman’s approach.

He swung open the hotel’s door, and before Sarah could react, Finn had thrown her out.

Then, the door slammed shut.

Sarah sat on the floor with tears of grievance flowing out of her eyes.

Their friend had clearly said that no man could reject the drug. Not only would there be a physical reaction, but even his thoughts would be controlled by the drug. There was no way to know who he was sleeping with, so she would be able to take him down in one fell swoop.

Yet now, what was going on?

Finn had thrown her out of the room.

What kind of willpower did Finn have to chase her away?

Nevertheless, she was not willing to give up.

She got up from the ground and knocked on the door frantically. However, no matter how hard she tried, there was still no sound from inside.

No.

It was not easy for her to get the chance to scheme against Finn tonight, and there would definitely be no chance next time.

She did not want to give up.
