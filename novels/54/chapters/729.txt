Edward looked at him and suddenly smiled.

The first time he saw George at South Hampton City’s International Airport, he took a quick glance at him.

However, he knew from that one glance that George was his son.

Blood ties were sometimes so magical.

That was why he got Teddy to buy him the earliest flight back to South Hampton City after he settled his matters during the business trip that time, which was originally planned for five days to a week. The purpose was to... create a sense of presence in front of the mother and son.

He even expected Jeanne would try her best to hide the fact that George was his son.

Nobody could imagine how much control he needed to have to play the act with Jeanne and not scare Jeanne away.

“Do you think I’m very funny?” George asked Edward.

He was so angry that he was about to explode.

However, Edward did not answer. Instead, he just rubbed George’s little head.

George looked even angrier like he could bite Edward at any time.

Then, Edward said, “I’ll help you take a bath.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I don’t need you to help me.”

“I know you do.”

“...”

With that, Edward bent down and picked George up.

George resisted, but resistance... was useless. To Edward, George was... powerless.

Edward stripped George of his clothes, and George stood naked in the bathroom.

George really, really hated Fourth Master Swan.

How could that man be such a bully? Why could he do whatever he wanted to?

“Take off your glasses,” Edward instructed. “I’ll wash your hair.”

“No.”

However, Edward had already taken off his glasses for him.

George was furious.

After taking off George’s glasses, Edward was stunned for two seconds as he looked at the mini him.

Edward’s stare made George very unhappy, and he furrowed his little brows. “Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I suddenly think that genetics are amazing.” The corner of Edward’s mouth curled up into a smile.

George was baffled.

“Your mother probably never thought she would give birth to a miniature version of me.” Edward was obviously still proud of himself. “But it’s not a loss. I’m good-looking.”

Who would be so narcissistic?

George ignored Edward, who stopped ‘admiring’ himself and began to wash George’s hair.

Then, Edward held the shower head over George’s head, pouring water over George.

George broke down as the water stung his eyes. However, he gritted his teeth and did not scream.

He could not let Fourth Master Swan see his weakness, but Edward did not seem to notice either.

Anyway, when Edward washed his own hair, he always held the shower head over his head. He was long used to the feeling of the water hitting his face.

He made sure that George’s hair was all wet before rubbing shampoo into his hair and rubbed it.

George’s small head was constantly being tormented by Edward.

Nevertheless, George gritted his teeth and endured it.

After a while, Edward picked up the shower head again and rinsed George’s hair.

The water and foam from the shampoo all flowed into George’s eyes.

“Boo-hoo...” George rubbed his eyes in discomfort.

Was that what Fourth Master Swan meant by washing his hair and bathing him? Fourth Master Swan clearly wanted to murder him and then take his mother away from him.

He kept rubbing his eyes as the discomfort in his eyes got worse.

Having noticed George’s discomfort, Edward put down the shower head and asked, “What’s wrong?”

George did not say anything.

He just covered his eyes and gritted his teeth, not letting himself cry out loud.

Edward forced George’s hand away, only to see George’s red eyes.

“Are you crying?” Edward asked.

“I’m a man. I won’t cry!” George said fiercely to Edward.

At that moment, the rims of his eyes reddened ever more as foam entered his eyes, and he could not control it.

“Even a man cries,” Edward said.

“I don’t. It just feels uncomfortable when the foam enters my eyes.”

Edward was a little stunned.

Eventually, he took a clean towel, wet it with warm water, and wrung it dry Then, he said to George, who was covering his eyes with his hand, “Sorry, I wasn’t paying too much attention to that.”

What did he mean by not paying too much attention? He simply did not pay attention at all.

He did it on purpose.

Edward pulled George’s hand away again and wiped his eyes with the towel.

Once the clean towel wiped away the foam in his eyes, George felt much better.

However, because the foam just now had stung his eyes, his eyes were still red, making him look inexplicably cute.

Edward hugged the naked George in his arms and let him lie on his lap. Then, he passed the towel to George. “Cover your eyes.”

George was upset, but the foam stung his eyes, so he did it anyway.
