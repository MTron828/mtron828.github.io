Chapter 83: The “Rivals in Love” Meet

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne wanted to hang up the phone right away.

Judging from Monica’s tone, she seemed to be in good spirits, so nothing big had happened.

At this moment, another man’s voice came from the phone.

He said, “Jeannie, it’s Finn.”

Jeanne frowned.

Under normal circumstances, Monica and Finn would not go to the nightclub together.

Unless... it was to accompany Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne did not need to think to know that Monica must be trying to set her up with Fourth Master Swan.

Just as she was about to reject, Finn said, “Today is my birthday, and there aren’t many people. If it’s possible, can you come over?”

Jeanne swallowed the words that were on the tip of her tongue.

Although she was not very familiar with Finn, it seemed that because of Monica, they could still be considered friends. Nonetheless, they were not casual friends, so it was difficult to reject him.

“Come over. You won’t have to stay for long,” Finn said again.

Jeanne nodded. “Okay.”

“Then we’ll wait for you.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She took a deep breath and drove to the nightclub.

Jeanne pushed open the door.

It was rare for the room to be so bright, so the moment she walked in, she saw everyone in the room.

It was truly... an unexpected combination.

Other than Finn and Monica, it was not surprising that Fourth Master Swan and Nox were also present.

The key was, why were Eden and Michael here?

If they were also here, so be it. They were still related to the people here, after all.

What Jeanne did not expect was that Melody was also here.

At that moment, she finally understood what Monica meant by “something big.” Monica was probably worried that Fourth Master Swan and Melody would pair up.

Well, Jeanne had almost forgotten about Melody.

She smiled calmly and said to Finn, “Sorry, I just finished working overtime, so I’m late.”

Finn smiled nonchalantly. “Sit here.”

Jeanne was brought to a sofa in the private room by Finn and sat down. Monica was next to her, and Fourth Master Swan and Nox were not far from her. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Michael, Melody, and Eden were sitting on the other side.

Actually, it could be seen from the seats that the three of them were together.

Eden had grown up with Melody. They did not have much interaction when they were young, so the relationship between them was probably due to Michael. The Rosses were a family of officials. They had a high position and power, so it seemed to be a matter of course that they had a good relationship with the royal family of Harken.

While Jeanne was secretly sorting out some of her relationships…

Monica quietly whispered in her ear, “It’s Finn’s birthday. Nox, who loves parties, insisted on finding an excuse to come to the nightclub, so we came. I know you’ve been busy recently and didn’t think of disturbing you. Who knew, when we were drinking, Melody came and immediately flirted with Fourth Master Swan. One look and it was obvious that she wanted to seduce Fourth Master! Fourth Master can’t belong to anyone. He has to be yours!”

Jeanne was speechless.

Who said it had to be that way?

Jeanne asked Monica, “Are Melody and Michael on good terms?”

“They seem to have grown up together, similar to you, me, and Eden,” Monica said.

‘As expected.’

“I’ll go and tell Michael not to pair them up wrongly.” Monica left after saying that.

Jeanne watched Monica walk toward Michael and called Michael out.

The moment she left, Finn, who was drinking with Fourth Master Swan and Nox, glanced over.

Jeanne was speechless toward Monica sometimes.

At this moment, a woman suddenly appeared in front of her.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly as she looked at Melody.

Melody only gave Jeanne a threatening look. She turned around and walked toward Fourth Master Swan. She said, “Edward, I have something to say to you in private.”

Edward looked at Melody and turned his head slightly to look at Jeanne.

He put down his elegant leg and stood up.

Melody seemed to be a little arrogant as she turned around and walked in front.

Edward followed behind her.

Jeanne watched them leave after the other.

It was rumored that Fourth Master Swan, who was cold and aloof to strangers, seemed to be a little gentler when he treated the princess of Harken.

Four people suddenly walked out of the private room.

The room seemed emptier.

Nox and Finn were drinking casually and seemed to be at ease.

Jeanne did not drink. It was awkward in such an environment.

On top of the awkwardness, Eden suddenly walked over and sat next to her.

“Didn’t I say that the Sanders’ third princess has taken a liking to my fourth uncle?” Eden held up his wine glass and drank by himself, his tone filled with sarcasm.

“So?” Jeanne smiled indifferently.

“I’m reminding you to know your limits.”

“You don’t have to worry about my matters.”

“Jeanne, don’t do it the hard way. I’ve tolerated you for a long time.” Eden was suddenly very angry.

He was easily angered by Jeanne.

Ever since Jeanne had returned, she seemed to have never regarded him as anything.

It was enough to want to attract his attention.

He could not stand it anymore. This woman was so disdainful toward him.

If Jeanne had not caused such a huge ruckus back then, he could still be together with her. It was only because she took herself too seriously that he chose Jasmine. He wanted to teach Jeanne a lesson and let her understand that just because he liked her, it did not mean that she could do whatever she wanted.

Now that Jeanne had returned, Eden also wanted to see her regret it. He wanted her to beg him to help her and to be together with her. He did not want her to go against him all the time!

Eden had originally planned to make Jeanne his lover after returning this time. As long as she was obedient enough, he would treat her well.

Jeanne did not care about Eden’s anger at all.

She suddenly stood up from the sofa.

Eden pulled her back.

Nox was drinking wine. Looking at Eden’s actions, his expression changed slightly. “Young Master Swan, don’t be touchy.”

Eden gritted his teeth and let go of Jeanne.

He knew that Nox had a good relationship with his fourth uncle. Nox was originally just a helper in his family. To put it bluntly, he was the son of a servant. Due to Eden’s fourth uncle’s protection, Nox could now do whatever he wanted in the Swans.

Jeanne moved her wrist and even used a napkin to wipe it. It was as if she was wiping something dirty.

At this moment, Eden really wanted to kill Jeanne.

‘What right does she have to despise me?!

‘She’s a second-hand goods. How can she be so self-righteous?

‘What’s wrong with Fourth Uncle that he would fall for her?!

‘Is it just her beauty or... her skills in bed?!’

Jeanne completely ignored Eden’s emotions. She turned around and walked out of the private room.

Nox had a smile on his face.

He had a feeling that a good show was about to happen.

…

Jeanne was indeed going to look for Fourth Master Swan.

After all, she had reached an agreement with him.

She walked to the end of the corridor and walked to a back garden.

In the back garden, two figures stood under the moonlight.

It was rare that the moonlight was bright tonight.

“Why won’t you accept me? What exactly is wrong with me?” Melody’s voice was a little agitated as if she was crying.

Fourth Master Swan did not reply.

Jeanne walked over and took the initiative to hold Fourth Master Swan’s arm intimately.

She smiled at Melody and said, “That’s because first come, first served.”
