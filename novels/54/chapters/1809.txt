Translator: End less Fantasy Translation Editor: End less Fantasy Translation

Monica stared at them walking one in front of another and commented, “They’re still as loving as ever.”

“Aren’t we the same?” Finn smiled.

Monica nodded. She never used to think she could attain true happiness, but now, it was all within her reach.

When Jeanne came out of the bathroom, her face was pale.

Edward, who was waiting for her at the door, looked at her and asked, “Are you feeling unwell?”

Jeanne did not answer.

“Let’s go to the hospital.”

“I’ve been there,” Jeanne replied.

“What did the doctor say?” Edward asked nervously.

“The doctor said that I…” Jeanne looked at Edward and said, “I’m pregnant.”

Edward was shocked at first, but after a while, he stuttered excitedly, “You’re pregnant?”

“It’s not your first time being a father. Do you have to be so excited?”Jeanne was very calm.

“I do,” Edward said seriously. “This means we will have another child in the family.”

Jeanne was actually pretty happy about it. After all, she had raised George alone, and Edward had brought Paige up alone, so they had never taken care of a child together. Now, just like Finn and Monica, they could be with the baby as it grew up.

“We’re going back.” Edward held Jeanne’s hand tightly.

“The wedding has just begun.”

“Your health is more important.”

“It’s just the size of a pea right now.”

“The more reasons for me to protect it.”

“Edward…”

“Be good.” Edward suddenly bent down and picked Jeanne up horizontally.

“I can walk on my own.”

“I know.”

“In that case, why did you pick me up?”

“Because I like it.”

Jeanne was rendered speechless

“Say,” Jeanne hugged Edward s neck. “What will our baby’s name be?”

They already had a George and Paige, so what else could they name it?

After the wedding, Shelly and Nox returned to Nox’s room in the Winters’ residence. The original black and white-colored room was now fully white.

Having changed out of their wedding attire and into a set of couple’s pajamas, the two of them sat on the edge of rhe bed. It was not their first time in bed together, but suddenly, they felt a little restrained.

Shelly turned to look at Nox, who looked nervous, and asked, “What are you afraid of?”

“I don’t know,” Nox answered honestly.

“Is this what we’re going to do all night?”

“You want to do it all night?” Nox’s eyes widened.

Shelly was baffled by Nox’s reaction.

“I was drunk last night, and my thought kept me up all night, so I only had about an hour or two of sleep. 1 might not have enough stamina to do it all night,” Nox explained.

It took Shelly a long time to realize what Nox was talking about, and she wondered what going through Nox’s mind.

“I said, are we just going to sit by the bed all night?” Shelly was speechless.

“Oh.” Nox finally understood what Shelly meant. He quickly said, “No, but I just wanted to talk to you first.”

“Yes.11

“Shelly, did you marry me willingly?”

“Yes.”

“No one forced you, right? Like my grandfather.”

“No, Grandpa has always respected my decision.”

“But you… How did you think it through and decide to marry me?” Nox asked.

“Because 1 love you.”

Nox was shocked.

“It’s true.” Shelly said, “1 don’t want to love you either, but… 1 have fallen in love with you. Now that I think about it, 1 do resent you for making me fall in love with you. However, rather than living in the past, 1 should cherish what 1 have now. So, 1 decided to spare myself and let go of the past.”

“When did you fall in love with me?”

“I don’t know.”

“Are you sure it’s not an illusion?”

“Are you forcing me to admit that I don’t love you?” Shelly was at a loss for words.

“No, no, no. I’m afraid you’ll regret it.”

“It’s my business if 1 regret it.”

“But Shelly-”

“Can you stop worrying so much?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“In that case, let s have s*x now.”

Nox’s sudden change in mood rendered Shelly speechless.

However, Shelly then pursed her lips and said, “Okay.”

Nox just stared at Shelly, and it made Shelly helpless. Was the current Nox who cried throughout the wedding and was now backing out on their wedding night the same man who had schemed to get her back then?

With her teeth gnashed, Shelly suddenly pounced on Nox and threw Nox onto the bed. Then, she turned around and pressed herself against Nox.

Nox looked at Shelly, who said, “Nox, I’ll show you how much I wanted to marry you and how much… I love you.”

Then, she kissed Nox passionately and poured out all her love for him.

In a dark room…

“Shelly, I will never let you go.”

‘I will never leave again either.”

While they made love in the room, fireworks lit up outside the window. It was just like the night when Nox proposed. The only difference was that there was no pain, only love!

That was just the start of their happy ending!
