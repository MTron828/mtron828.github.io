“Yes, yes, yes. I won’t say anymore. What I mean is, don’t be too sad about it. You need to have a good rest. The doctor said that the bump on your head can have serious consequences. You should take good care of yourself,” Mrs. Winter comforted him softly.

“I know. You can leave now. All of you, go,” Nox urged.

However, were they really going to let him fend for himself?

Mrs. Winter was a little hesitant, so she turned around and glanced at Mr. Winter, who was also very angry today. He had never thought that the good daughter-in-law they had would be such a despicable woman behind their backs!

At that moment, he had finally calmed down, and after receiving Mrs. Winter’s gaze, he also could not make a decision for a long time. He was really afraid that Nox would take things too hard. After all, Nox had never fainted from anger before.

Ever since Nox was young, he had always thought that Nox was heartless, but this time, Nox was dealt a hard blow. It was inevitable that he would be a little worried.

“Let’s go,” Edward suddenly said.

He quickly made a decision and decided to respect Nox’s wishes.

In fact, it was understandable why Nox wanted to be alone at that moment. After all, it was such a humiliating matter, and he did not want to lose his dignity.

Mr. Winter looked at Edward.

“Give Nox some privacy so that he can relax.” Edward said, “Don’t worry. No matter how hard he tries, he won’t commit suicide.”

Nox cursed in his heart, ‘F*ck. Edward, what right do you have to say that I won’t commit suicide? Every second

“Alright, let’s give Nox some space.” Mr. Winter agreed.

With that, everyone left the ward, leaving Nox alone.

Nox watched as that group of heartless people left just like that. Although he meant it when he said he wanted to be alone, he was very unhappy to have been abandoned.

He had already suffered the biggest blow of his life. How could they really leave so freely? Was he important to them at all?

Nox felt that living in this world was a huge tragedy! He should just die!

Everyone left the hospital after they left the ward.

When they were at the entrance of the hospital, Jeanne was still a little worried. She asked Edward, “Are you sure we don’t have to care about him?”

“No need.” Edward said, “The more we care about him, the more he’ll think that this is a huge matter, the more he won’t be able to walk out of it. Let it sink into him slowly.”

“Let’s go.” Edward hugged Jeanne’s body.

Under the protection of the guards in black suits, she got into the car intimately with him at the entrance.

At the same time, Finn and Monica walked to the parking lot and left, while Mr. and Mrs. Winter left the hospital in the Winters’ private car.

On the way back, Monica suddenly sighed. “Finn, how much fun do you think Nox has brought to the people of Harken?”

Finn’s eyes flickered as he drove seriously.

He had known earlier that there was something wrong with Zoe. However, he did not expect the problem to be so big. If it was really that big, he should have told Nox earlier. Then, Nox would not have been tricked by his grandfather!

Not to mention Nox, even if he encountered such a thing, he would probably faint at the scene. It was such a difficult thing to do to anybody, and Nox really respected Grandpa Winter for it!

“Speaking of which, Nox must have been hurt badly this time,” Monica said faintly.

At the thought of Nox, she suddenly pitied him. She also thought about how the moment he looked forward to the most in his life had become the thing that would haunt him the most for the rest of his life. If it were anyone else, they might not be able to get over it for the rest of their lives!

As for whether Nox could get over it… she could only say that it was up to fate.

“Actually, it’s not that bad,” Finn suddenly said.

“What do you mean?” Monica asked him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“About Nox being cheated on,” Finn replied.

“Finn, are you Nox’s best friend? Your best friend has been cuckolded, and he has nothing to live for anymore! How can you say it’s okay? Even I feel angry for Nox!” Monica was a little agitated.

Finn glanced at Monica through the rearview mirror and said, “What I mean is that time can heal wounds, and he’ll get over it soon.”

“No, he won’t get over it soon!” Monica refuted firmly, “Nox won’t be able to get over the fact that Zoe cheated on him!”
