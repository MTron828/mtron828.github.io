Chapter 1658: Shelly’s Smart Response

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Benjamin, is something wrong? It would be a pity to lose out on such a good opportunity.” The dean tried to persuade him.

“I know, but I have something important to do, so I can’t go abroad. I hope you understand, Dean.” Benjamin was really grateful to the dean for giving him the opportunity.

“There’s no rush. You can think it through and get back to me tomorrow. You should go back and discuss it with your parents.”

“There’s no need to consider it. Thank you, Dean. I’ll be leaving now.” Benjamin rejected the dean outright.

He was afraid that he would go back on his decision, so he left immediately after saying that, not giving himself any chance to reconsider his choices. After all, how could he leave at a time like that? He knew that Shelly needed him the most right now, and he could not leave just like that.

Moreover, he had made plans for their future. Now that he was done with his third year, he would be able to get out of school for an internship in his fourth year and have an income. All he wanted was to start earning as soon as possible so that he could take care of Shelly and Bella. Nothing else mattered.

When Benjamin left, the director called the man back helplessly and asked if they could send another person instead since Benjamin did not want to go. Naturally, the man said no. As the dean did not want to lose that opportunity, he quickly said that he could persuade Benjamin again.

Then, the person who received the news immediately reported it to Nox.

“Benjamin rejected the offer.”

Sitting in his office, Nox’s expression darkened again.

“I didn’t expect him to be so stubborn. According to my understanding, most people can’t refuse such temptation. I can only say that Benjamin’s feelings for Ms. Carter are really…” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As if he could sense Nox’s coldness, the man quickly asked, “Mr. Winter, should we go with the second plan?”

“Cut the cr*p! I just want the results!”

“Alright, I’ll arrange it immediately! By the way,” the other party quickly said, “the total cost of stopping Benjamin from going to Shelly’s house yesterday was 28 thousand dollars. Please don’t forget to transfer the money over.” “You spent 28 thousand dollars to stop Benjamin?” Nox roared.

…Didn’t you say to stop Benjamin from going to Ms. Carter’s house at all costs?”

“F*ck!” Nox cursed.

He abruptly hung up the phone.

Seeing that the call had ended, the man did not dare to disturb Nox anymore.

However, he wanted to add that Zoe had not been found yet! She had not left South Hampton City but was nowhere to be found. It was as if she had suddenly vanished from the face of the earth.

On top of that, he had been spending too much of his energy on Shelly recently, and Mr. Winter did not even ask about Zoe at all. It made him a little lazy to keep up with the search!

After Benjamin rejected the director, he took a bus to Shelly. They had not seen each other for at least a week, so he was a little excited.

He sat on the bus and stared out at the streets of South Hampton City, which had developed very well. In fact, there were many opportunities in such a big city, and there was no need to go abroad for further studies — or that was what Benjamin made himself understand.

Just then, he lowered his head and took out his phone, which had suddenly rang. Seeing that it was his mother calling, he quickly picked it up. “Mom.” “Benjamin, come home,” his mother said seriously.

“I’ll be back in two days. I have something to do these few days,” Benjamin refused.

“What is it? I want you to come back immediately.” “What’s wrong? Did something happen at home?”

“Come back now!” There was no explanation from her end at all.

“Tomorrow. I’ll be back tomorrow.”

“I said now!”

“Mom!” Benjamin was getting a little angry. “I said that I have something to do and will be back tomorrow!”

“Your dean just called to say that you rejected an opportunity to study abroad,!” His mother stopped beating around the bush.

Benjamin pursed his lips. He did not expect the dean to tell his parents, and he had forgotten to remind him not to contact his family. He knew very well that his parents would not be able to accept him rejecting such a great opportunity. “I have my own plans.” Benjamin said, “Don’t worry about it,”

“I haven’t had to worry much about you since you were young, and you’ve always been obedient. The only time you rebelled was when you got into a fight with a female classmate in your class and the school called us in, but I never took that to heart. Since you’re all grown up now, I will respect your decisions. However, I won’t let you give up on this opportunity to study abroad. You have to accept it! I just told the director to give you the chance, and you will go..”
