Chapter 1537: Finn and Monica Getting Along

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s good.” Finn nodded.

Monica picked up her fork and saw that the dishes in front of her were almost all her favorite dishes. In the past, Finn had never cared about what she liked. Now that they were separated, he knew her like the back of his hand.

Then, she started eating and realized the dishes that Finn cooked were much better than the ones he cooked before. She did not know if it was because she was hungry, but she thought it tasted good.

After eating a plate, she ate another. Meanwhile, Finn and Paige stared at her from the side. It was a little awkward, but in the end, she still ate a lot.

Once she was done, Finn went to wash the dishes. Monica glanced at Finn before turning back and leading Paige to the sofa.

“Godmother, do you like to watch cartoons?” Paige asked eagerly.

“Mm.” Monica brushed it off.

“Me, too. I like Peppa Pig the most. Do you think my sisters in your belly will like it too?”

“Paige, the babies in my belly might not be girls,” Monica said.

Paige frowned, seemingly unwilling to accept it.

“It might be two little brothers,” Monica said bluntly.

“I don’t like little brothers.” Paige was a little disappointed.

Monica could not bear to see her like that, so she said, “What I mean is, not both of them might be girls. Maybe only one is a girl.”

“So I’ll only have one sister?”

“It’s possible.”

“A younger sister is fine too.” Paige quickly said, “As long as I have a younger sister, I’m happy.”

Monica patted Paige’s head.

Paige was also extremely intimate with Monica, who seemed to understand why Finn wanted a daughter. Having a daughter like Paige would be really heartwarming and sweet.

After washing the dishes, Finn sat on the sofa quietly. However, he sat a little far away, so he did not have much of a presence in the room.

The sound of Paige and Monica talking sounded in the living room from time to time. It was a harmonious scene.

At 9 p.m., Finn put down his phone. “Paige, it’s time to wash up and go to bed.”

Paige was unhappy. “I want to play a little longer.”

“Be good. We can play again tomorrow,” Finn said firmly

Seeing that her godfather was serious, Paige nodded obediently. The corners of Finn’s mouth curled up a little as he stood up and picked Paige up, preparing to return to his room.

“Finn,” Monica suddenly called out to him.

Finn turned around.

That was the first time that Monica took the initiative to speak to him tonight. If one looked closely, one would notice that his hands that were holding Paige were trembling. He was either happy or nervous…

“Paige is a girl. Are you going to give her a bath?” Monica asked.

She really felt that Fourth Master Swan had a big heart.

Even if he was in a bad mood after having a conflict with Candice and did not want Paige to see them in that state, he should not have casually handed Paige over to a single man to take care of. Of course, Finn could definitely take good care of Paige, but sometimes, it was still inappropriate.

Even if Paige was only three years old, should she not have been taught from a young age that there was a difference between men and women?

“In the past three days, I’ve only washed Paige’s face and feet for her. I haven’t given her a shower yet,” Finn explained.

“So, it’s been three days, and you haven’t washed Paige’s hair or bathed her?” Monica looked at Finn. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When Monica saw Finn nod, she was speechless.

Although the weather was not too bad now, how could Paige be comfortable with not washing her hair or bathing for three days? She recalled that Paige would shower every night when she was at home.

“Godmother, I want to take a bath.” Paige quickly said, “I really want to take a

bath. ”

Monica thought about it. Since she was already spending time with Paige, it did not matter if it took a little more of her time.

She said, “I’ll bathe you.”

“Alright.” Paige was so happy that her eyes smiled too. Anyone who saw Paige’s expression would be melted by how adorable she looked.

Monica said, “Let’s go.”

Then, she followed Finn, who was carrying Paige, into Paige’s room. That room used to be Monica’s, but it had not been used for a long time.

Monica walked in and felt a little emotional. Indeed, after pregnancy, one would be much more emotional. Otherwise, she would not have been dominated by a three-year-old like Paige.

Finn put Paige down in the bathroom before he filled the tub with water. By then, Paige was already taking off her clothes excitedly, even though it was quite a struggle.

Monica quickly said to Finn, “You should go out..”
