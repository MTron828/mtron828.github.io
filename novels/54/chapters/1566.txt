Finn followed closely behind her.

“Finn, don’t you think you reek of alcohol?” Monica asked while brushing her teeth.

Stunned, Finn lowered his head and sniffed his body. He probably could not smell it, so he quickly said, “In that case, I’ll take a shower immediately.” “Go back to your own room to wash up,” Monica requested.

Finn was reluctant to go back to his room, but when he saw Monica’s firm gaze, he compromised.

Monica found him very difficult to deal with last night, but after he regained his rationality, he became very obedient. She watched Finn’s back as he left and did not allow herself to think too much.

Last night, he was the one who went into her room to sleep without her permission. He even hugged her tightly, rendering her unable to move. Was it not natural for her to chase him out now? As such, there was no need for her to feel guilty.

She slowly washed up and was about to leave the room to have breakfast when someone knocked on the door.

The moment she opened the door, she saw Finn standing at the door again. Behind him, a staff member was pushing a cart of breakfast. It looked like Finn had told someone to send breakfast over. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica was about to reject him, but she held her tongue back. She silently allowed the waiter to place breakfast on the dining table in the room. Then, she sat down with Finn to eat breakfast.

“I’ve showered,” Finn suddenly said.

Monica was speechless. She did not know why Finn had to report it to her. She had caught a whiff of the refreshing scent on Finn’s body the moment she opened the door.

In fact, the smell of alcohol on his body had long disappeared after he slept, and she just wanted him to leave her room. However, she did not expect he would find an excuse to come back after leaving for a while.

“In the future, I won’t keep anything to myself anymore,” Finn said.

It seemed to be a promise that he would tell her everything in the future.

“There’s no need to tell me everything about you.” Monica rejected him.

She still wanted to keep her distance from him.

Finn’s throat moved slightly. At that moment, he was a little emotional as he said, “Monica, why were you so cold to me last night?”

“Haven’t I always been like this?” Monica did not want to explain to him that she saw him with Wendy last night.

“No, it changed last night,” Finn said seriously.

‘You can think whatever you want.” Monica was too lazy to explain.

Like most of the time, she wanted to let it slide silently and leave it unsettled.

“I’ve thought about it a lot.” However, Finn did not choose to remain silent because of Monica’s rejection. He said seriously, “Did you see me with Ms.

Hansen last night?”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat. She had to admit that from the day she met Finn, she knew that the sc*mbag was brilliantly clever.

“No,” Monica denied.

“Regardless, I feel like I have to explain it to you,” Finn said. He was very optimistic about their relationship, so he continued to explain, “Wendy likes me.”

Monica’s expression changed slightly. Suddenly, the breakfast in front of her did not look appetizing anymore.

Was Finn showing off to her? No matter where he went, there would always be women who liked him. He did not have to worry that he would die alone. As long as he wanted someone, he could have her.

“But I rejected her. I told her clearly that I have a girlfriend and that I’m about to get married.” Finn’s eyes were fixed on Monica.

“It has nothing to do with me,” Monica said coldly.

She just did not want to be seduced by Finn.

“It doesn’t matter. You’re my girlfriend, and you’re the one I’m about to get married to.”

“When did I agree to that?” Monica was a little angry.

“I can wait for you, for as long as it takes.” It seemed like a promise.

At that moment, Monica did not feel like eating her breakfast anymore.

As soon as she put down her utensils and decided not to eat, she heard Finn say, “I just asked Ms. Hansen. We’ll have lunch at the sightseeing area, and that means it’ll take half an hour by car. So, lunch will be around 1 p.m. If you don’t eat something now, you’ll be hungry and even feel nauseous.. Also, if there’s heavy traffic, lunch might be later…”
