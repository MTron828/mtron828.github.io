Chapter 1757: A Celebration Party For Finn and Monica’s Babies

She really wanted to see the twins. Although there were many pictures of them in the hall, she wanted to see the real babies. She thought they looked adorably cute and completely different from how they looked when they were born.

“Yes, I gave my aunt a call when I left his morning. They came over early in the morning and are definitely in the lounge now. Do you want to go and take a look?” Sarah invited her.

Shelly quickly nodded.

“Come with me.” Sarah held Shelly’s hand.

Shelly called out to the excited Bella beside her. “Bella, let’s go and look at the two babies, okay? Can we come out and play after we’re done?” “Alright,” Bella replied in her childish voice.

She was really obedient.

Sarah looked at Bella and could not help but sigh. “Bella is such a good girl.”

Shelly nodded. That was why she could not bear to part with Bella, who was dependent on her.

As the three of them walked out of the lively banquet hall together, Nox saw them and watched them leave. In the end, he resisted the urge to follow them and continued socializing with others.

In the lounge of the hall, the sound of a baby crying could be heard from afar. Sarah and Shelly quickened their pace. Whenever they heard crying, they would feel inexplicably anxious.

After they knocked, it was Gary who opened the door. He looked at Sarah and said quickly, “Come in.

Monica is feeding the two babies.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Alright.” Sarah walked in with Shelly and Bella.

The lounge was exquisite, and it had everything they needed, especially for the babies.

“Why is the baby crying?” Sarah was puzzled.

“When it’s feeding time for two babies, one will get to feed first before the other, and it’s only natural for the one who doesn’t get to feed yet to feel upset.”

“The one who doesn’t get to feed first must be the brother, right?” Sarah knew the answer without even guessing.

Gary nodded. After a while, the other baby stopped crying, probably because it was his time to feed.

Then, Ruby carried the baby out after she had eaten to her heart’s content. She looked so chubby in a pink fluffy princess dress that she looked adorable. She was really good-looking, and it was obvious at three-month-old that she was a beauty.

The moment Sarah saw the sister, she became excited and quickly went over. “Aunt, I want to hold her.”

“Go on.” Ruby had always doted on Sarah. “Be careful. She just ate, so she might vomit. Make sure to hold her vertically so that she can lie on your shoulder.”

“Alright.” Sarah did as she was told.

The moment she held the baby, her heart was filled with cuteness overload. She was so happy that she could not control herself and said to the sister, “Maya, I’m your aunt. Do you love me?”

The sister naturally did not have much of a reaction. She was lying on Sarah’s shoulder, looking like a satisfied little pig after she had eaten. After a while, her brother had eaten too, and the nanny brought him out.

Behind the curtain, Monica and Finn had yet to come out. Monica felt that her soul was about to be sucked dry by the two babies. Every time she fed them, it was worse than death for her. She felt like a supercow that could only produce milk.

In fact, her milk production was not as much as she had imagined. She could only feed the babies together one meal a day with her milk, and most of the time, they would be fed a mix of breastmilk and milk powder.

“Are you tired?” Finn looked at Monica and asked her.

“My body is not tired, but my heart is.”

“What’s wrong?”

“I don’t want to be a cow anymore. I feel like I have no freedom in life.” Monica stared at the ceiling in a daze. “I want to have coffee, tuna, jalapenos, alcohol…” The more Monica listed, the more aggrieved she felt.

Nowadays, she would only eat nutritious meals. It was okay for the first few days, but after having the same thing again and again, she felt like everything was bland. That was why she wanted something heavy right now.

“Be good. Once we start weaning the babies off breastfeeding, I will eat everything you want with you.” Finn comforted her.

“How long will it take to wean them off? I read childcare experts saying that babies can feed on breastmilk until they’re two or three years old. Some experts even say they can go on for as long as they like.” When Monica saw those comments, she almost cried..
