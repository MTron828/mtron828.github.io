Chapter 448: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
In the huge senior management meeting room in Swan Enterprise, under Jeanne’s cold and calm demeanor, Eden was a little flustered.

He looked at the phone his Fourth Uncle was holding and hurriedly shouted, “Wait!”

That one word was enough for everyone to look at him and his sudden change in expression.

They watched him defend himself in the end and said, “Fourth Uncle, are you going to let Jeanne do this?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jeanne snickered.

At that moment, Eden was still refusing to admit defeat.

Edward glanced at Eden and asked in return, “Shouldn’t I?”

Eden’s expression turned cold.

“If I don’t dote on my own wife, who will?” Edward was not shy about saying that in front of everyone.

Eden gritted his teeth.

He really could not understand how Jeanne seduced his Fourth Uncle. How did she, in a short time, make his Fourth Uncle fall head over heels for her?

He even saw a huge difference in his Fourth Uncle ever since he and Jeanne got together!

“Moreover,” Edward said, “in this matter, I really didn’t indulge her. After all, what she said was reasonable. If you’re innocent, the law will let you go!”

......

Eden gritted his teeth and could not say a word.

Edward said, “Let me remind you again. You are not allowed to call her Jeanne. Know your place!”

Eden looked at his Fourth Uncle coldly.

In front of him, he had never dared to resist. Sometimes, he was even intimidated by his aura.

At that moment, it was the same.

He looked at his fourth uncle, his eyes were red.

The meeting room was quiet. Everyone seemed to be waiting for the truth of whether or not Eden had done anything.

Time ticked away, and Eden did not say anything for a long time.

Edward did not seem to want to waste his time with Eden either, so he lowered his eyes and made a call.

Eden simply watched as Edward dialed the number with a nonchalant expression.

After the call connected, Edward said, “Is this the judicial authority–”

“I admit it!” Eden suddenly said out loud.

Edward narrowed his eyes.

Suddenly, Eden compromised and said anxiously, “Fourth Uncle, don’t call the police!”

Edward’s hand holding the phone tightened as he looked at Eden coldly. At that moment, his expression was grim.

Eden could also feel the gaze of his Fourth Uncle, and under that gaze, he had nowhere to hide.

Eden had indeed gone against Edward and Edward’s principles!

When Jeanne asked him to hold a senior management meeting today to accuse Eden, he knew Eden must have done such a thing. In fact, he had to admit that he was somewhat touched that Eden admitted it. At least for a very long time, he had regarded Eden as one of Swan Enterprise’s heirs. Therefore, he actually treated Eden quite well and gave Eden quite a bit of advice on the developments in the business industry.

At that moment, Edward hung up the phone.

His expression was ice-cold as he looked at Eden, who had become flustered.

In the senior management meeting room, a few seconds of silence filled the air.

While everyone was still caught off guard by the turn of events, Henry flew into a rage. He glared fiercely at his son. “Eden, what are you talking about?”

Eden’s body tensed up.

He had to admit it now.

If he did not, the judicial authorities would be involved in the investigation. With the evidence Jeanne had, it would be hard for him to explain himself. He did not know what else Jeanne had in her hands!

Once it involved the judicial authorities, it would be impossible to resolve it privately.

Once it was known to the public, he would be imprisoned for allegedly abusing his power and harming the Swan Enterprise’s profits!

At that thought, he could no longer persist with defending himself.

Hence, he admitted it right away.

The fact that he was defending himself so desperately just now made him even more embarrassed!

He did not dare to look at his father.

He just stood there, feeling humiliated in front of all the senior management.

When Henry did not get an answer from Eden, his expression darkened. “Eden, tell me now! Did you or did you not give the money to the Chamber of Commerce in Minze District? Did you do such a thing?”

Eden clenched his fists.

“Speak!” Henry was furious.

Still, Eden chose to remain silent.

In fact, silence meant tacitly agreeing to it.

Henry was so angry that his body was trembling.

He could not believe that his son, whom he had always been proud of, had done such a thing.

To think that he was mocking Jeanne so indignantly just a moment ago. Now, he was more than ashamed of himself.
