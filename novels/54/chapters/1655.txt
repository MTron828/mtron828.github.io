“Why are you telling me that she bought condoms…” Nox suddenly paused.

The man did not dare to say anything more and just listened to Nox’s sudden silence. After a moment of silence, Nox abruptly hung up, and the man also put down his phone.

He had been following Shelly for a month, supposedly to protect her from cyberbullying, but he did not expect he would be reporting Ms. Carter’s daily life to Mr. Winter instead. He was a dignified, top-class bodyguard in Harken, for crying out loud! When did he become a paparazzi?

On the other end of the phone, Nox smashed his phone to the ground. At that moment, he was sitting in his office, and the president of the company was reporting to him.

The man was so frightened by Nox’s sudden outburst that he did not dare to speak or get up and leave. He was stuck in Nox’s office, in a dilemma.

“Get out!” Nox suddenly ordered.

The president hurriedly left, not daring to be slow for even a second.

When the office door was closed, Nox kicked the desk in front of him hard, and it flipped. He was so angry that he wanted to kill someone. At the thought of Shelly buying a box of condoms, he…

‘F*ck!’ he cursed to himself.

In fact, he had never thought of having someone follow Shelly around. It was just that one day when he was having a business dinner with the boss of the news agency, he overheard him talking to someone on the phone who asked him if he wanted to expose the news of Shelly having suffered from cyberbullying. Only then did he know that Shelly had been subjected to Internet abuse recently.

After careful investigation, he found out that Shelly had indeed been subjected to Internet abuse. Shelly had been through so much, but she did not say a word to him, nor did she scold him for it; she just endured it.

While he was angry at Shelly, he also made sure that the people who had exposed Shelly were dead. He was afraid that he could not catch them all, so he sent someone to protect Shelly. Although he said it was to protect her, he ended up tracking Shelly’s every move instead.

Every time he heard that Benjamin went to Shelly’s house, he wanted to go and smash the door down. Fortunately, Benjamin would leave before 11 p.m. every night. That way, he could lie to himself that Benjamin and Shelly might not be at that part of the relationship where they were intimate with each other.

Yet now, Shelly was buying a box of condoms! What did that mean?

Nox picked up the phone. “I told you to make Benjamin lose everything. Why aren’t you doing it?”

“Mr. Winter, it’s not that I don’t want, but I just don’t know how to make him lose everything. I’ve investigated and found that his family is poor, and there’s nothing left for him to lose, so…”

“Can’t you make him lose even more? For example, get him expelled or something. ”

“Actually, expelling him won’t affect Ms. Carter’s relationship with him,” the other party said bluntly.

He truly felt that Mr. Winter was being very childish, whereas Nox, on the other hand, was fuming. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Actually, I have an idea.” The other party said in a trembling voice, “Isn’t your goal to destroy Ms. Carter and Benjamin’s relationship so that she can be with you?”

“Why are you talking so much nonsense? Get to the point.” Nox was a little impatient.

The other party quickly said, “We can give Benjamin a chance to study abroad through the school to get him overseas. Then, Benjamin will have two choices. One is to reject the offer and the other is to accept. If he accepts it, they would live separately. That way, once Benjamin leaves, you could pursue Ms. Carter freely.”

“What if he rejects the offer?” Nox asked.

Although very few people could resist the temptation to study abroad, what if

he did reject the offer?

“If he rejects the offer, we’ll expose Benjamin and Shelly’s relationship to Benjamin’s parents. We’ll say that Shelly is affecting Benjamin’s future, and naturally, Benjamin’s parents will destroy their relationship. I figure that with Ms. Carter’s personality, she definitely wouldn’t want to ruin Benjamin’s future, so she would take the initiative to break up. Once they break up,

Benjamin would definitely choose to study abroad.”

“You should be an editor for a tabloid, not an assistant!” Nox cursed.

Nevertheless, he was tempted by that plan.

“Well, I’ve been racking my brains to come up with an idea just so you can pursue your true love, Mr. Winter!” The other party smiled and asked, ‘What do you think, Mr. Winter?”

“Let’s do it!” Nox agreed immediately. “Alright. I’ll make the necessary arrangements.”

“Oh, right.” Nox suddenly thought of something.

“Mr. Winter, do you have any other orders for me?” “No matter what, we cannot allow Benjamin to go to Shelly’s house tonight.”

The other party was put in a difficult position.

“Did you hear that?”

“I’ll think of a way to make it happen.”

With that, Nox abruptly hung up the phone. That was the first time he was behaving so despicably for a woman!

Shelly cooked Benjamin’s favorite dishes and waited for him to come for dinner. He said he had set off from campus, but why was he not here even after two years?

Worried, Shelly quickly called Benjamin. However, it took a long time for the call to get through.

“Shelly.”

“Ben, why aren’t you here yet? Did something come up?” Shelly asked nervously.

“No, no. Listen to me and don’t be frightened.” “What’s wrong?” Shelly was extremely nervous.

“I was in a car accident.”

“What?”

“It’s not serious, and I’m not injured at all. However, for safety reasons, the doctor is having us stay in the hospital for a night. If everything is alright, I’ll come to see you after I get discharged tomorrow,” Benjamin quickly said.

He was also puzzled by that car accident.

He was on a bus when the bus suddenly crashed into the railing beside it. In fact, no one on the bus was injured, but they were forced to go to the hospital and asked to stay for a night.

Most importantly, they were all placed in a high-end ward! The treatment they got was simply too good to be true!

How afraid was the driver of being sued? With this treatment, would the driver not go bankrupt overnight?
