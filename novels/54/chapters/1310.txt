1311 A Family’s Warmth

Even as he reached her, she rose to her feet, looking deferential.

“Candice,” Edward uttered her name.

Candice quickly responded, “Yes.”

“We’ll be husband and wife from now on,” Edward said.

Candice’s eyes flickered.

“Don’t behave so courteously with me in the future.” Edward’s tone was light, but firm.

“Okay.” Candice nodded.

However, she was obviously still very reserved.

Edward sighed slightly. He suddenly reached out and took her hand.

Candice’s fingers moved slightly.

Edward’s large hand held her small hand tightly. The moment he held it, his body suddenly moved closer.

He said, “I’m going out for a while. I have an interview later. I’ll be back for lunch.”

“Okay.”

“Candice.” Edward suddenly called her again.

She felt that there was a deep emotion in it. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Candice really did not think that they would develop feelings for each other after only meeting two or three times—at least she didn’t.

However, Edward’s current appearance made her feel that he really liked her.

“Kiss me,” Edward suddenly demanded.

Candice was taken aback.

She looked straight at Edward.

She knew that he was a domineering person, but she did not expect him to be so domineering to her.

She bit her lip lightly and refused to do as she was told.

She just thought it would feel very uncomfortable.

There was also a hint of reluctance in her.

Her body seemed to be resisting, telling her not to kiss him.

The two of them were in a deadlock for a while.

Edward gave up. He thought he might have been rushing it.

He let go of her hand and turned to leave before his body suddenly tensed up.

He watched as Candice tiptoed and kissed him on the lips.

Honestly, he would be happy enough if it was a peck on the cheek, like a ritual between parting lovers.

But of course, this would be very much more welcomed.

Just like that, he felt her soft lips carefully kissing his.

They seemed to be hesitating about whether to leave or go deeper.

Edward grabbed the back of her head and exerted force.

Their kiss intensified.

Teddy was standing nearby, so he could only turn around and leave in embarrassment.

It had been a long time since he saw Edward lose his cool.

The couple was smooching for a long time until both of them were slightly out of breath.

Edward let go of her.

Candice blushed.

She really wanted to reject him just now, but for some reason, she kissed him again.

Perhaps it was because Edward was right; they were soon to be husband and wife and there would be many more things to do together.

This was just an introduction to all those things they were going to share, she told herself.

“Wait for my return,” Edward said.

The lust in his eyes was apparent.

Candice nodded silently.

Edward seemed to have taken a deep breath and collected himself before striding out of the hall as usual.

He was finally gone and Candice could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

She felt a little uncomfortable interacting with Edward, not just because of his status but also the way he made her feel.

She allowed herself to relax and suddenly remembered that her phone was still in the room, so she quickly went upstairs.

She happened to bump into Teddy and he was extremely respectful to her. “Ms. Nicholson.”

“Hello.” Candice was very polite.

“My name is Teddy,” he introduced himself. “I’m in charge of Fourth Master and Young Master’s everyday affairs. In the future, when Ms. Nicholson moves in here, I’ll also be in charge of managing your daily life. You can tell me if you need anything.”

“Okay, thanks.”

...

“I won’t disturb Mis. Nicholson anymore. I’ll go down first.”

Candice nodded as she watched Teddy leave.

She somewhat felt another familiar feeling, but still indescribable.

She walked toward the room she slept in last night. The moment she opened the door and was about to enter, a little boy’s voice came from behind.

“Are you Candice?”

Candice turned around and saw a little boy, who seemed to already have a sense of youth. He stood there straight and asked her.

She could clearly hear the displeasure in his tone.
