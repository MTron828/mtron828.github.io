Chapter 1540: You Still Can’t Let Go of Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica looked at Finn, and seeing how serious he was, she did not know what to feel about it right now.

In fact, she could tell that Finn was treating her very well… so well that she found it hard to reject him. However, there was still a voice in her heart telling her not to get close, or she would be hurt.

She was initially moved by his gestures, but slowly, that feeling in her heart dissipated.

Pretending not to see what he was doing, she said emotionlessly, “Finn, Paige is asleep.”

Finn looked up at her and said, “Alright, please wait a moment. I’ll dry your clothes for you.”

Monica nodded and did not say anything else before turning around and leaving coldly.

Finn stared at Monica’s back, looking a little disappointed, but he accepted it.

After all, there was nothing he could do even if he did not accept it. The current Monica was really hard to woo.

Once he washed Monica’s clothes and put them into the dryer, he walked out of the laundry room and saw that Monica was sitting on the sofa in the living room watching a comedy variety show on the television.

When he appeared, she was smiling brightly because of the variety show. That simple and unguarded smile of hers made Finn’s heart beat wildly, and his eyes were fixed on Monica.

Noticing his gaze, Monica frowned and turned to look, only to be met with Finn’s burning gaze…

She had always thought that Finn was a cold person as he treated everyone the same every time. However, the emotions in his eyes at that moment made her feel touched.

Her cold gaze shifted again. Despite all that, it was difficult for her to convince herself to get back together with Finn.

Finn could also see the change in Monica’s eyes, from shocked to being touched and back to their usual coldness. Her rejection of him was visible.

As Finn walked over to Monica and sat down, Monica kept her eyes on the television. The sound of laughter came from the television, but it did not attract Finn’s attention as his eyes were on Monica.

He really did not know how he could rekindle Monica’s feelings for him. In fact, he had been reflecting on how he had pushed the woman who loved him further and further away in the past three years.

“How long will it take for my clothes to dry?” Monica suddenly asked.

“About an hour,” Finn replied

Monica nodded and remained silent. There seemed to be nothing to say between the two of them, and she felt uncomfortable sitting with him.

“Finn, why don’t you go and rest first? I’ll put on my clothes and leave after they’re dry.” Monica obviously did not want to be alone with him.

“I want to be with you, ” Finn said bluntly.

The current Finn was completely different from the previous Finn. Now, he would immediately express his thoughts instead of staying silent.

“It makes me uncomfortable.”

“But I can see you.”

“Does seeing me make you uncomfortable?” Finn asked her.

Although he was a little hurt, he was trying his best to endure it.

“Finn, you know what I mean. You know I don’t have feelings for you anymore.

I want us to part on good terms-I‘

“I can’t.” Finn interrupted her, “I’ve never thought of us parting on good terms. I can’t accept it. I admit that I’ve neglected you a lot in the past. You can take revenge on me or treat me the same way, but I won’t accept us separating.”

“Why do you have to do this, Finn? Why do you have to make things so difficult for us?”

“Because I like you.” Finn was very determined. “I like you, so I can’t leave you.”

Monica pursed her lips as she stared straight at him. She saw the determination in his eyes.

She had hoped many times that Finn would put her first in his life and that he could tell when she was unhappy. However, when she had no expectations of him, he suddenly became everything she wanted him to be.

In the end, they were not fated to be together..
