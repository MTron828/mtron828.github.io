He did not react for a few minutes.

“Has it never crossed your mind that I’m not your biological daughter?” Jeanne asked sarcastically.

At that, the expression on Alexander’s face changed very quickly. It even twisted in anger.

“My mother only slept with you once. Do you think you made my mother pregnant with me just once? Have you never thought about whether this child is yours or not?” Jeanne asked him aggressively.

Alexander had never thought about it.

Even if Jeanne’s mother had never slept with him, she had always rejected his existence. However, he investigated her and found out that she had never been involved with any other man. She had also never had any ambiguous relationships with any other man, so he always thought that Jeanne’s mother only wanted the Lawrences’ assets. That woman was just too ambitious!

However, he had never thought that he would be cuckolded.

“It wasn’t after you got married. It was before you got married. Don’t you find it strange that my mother wanted to marry you so suddenly? It was obvious my mother was unmoved even after you pursued her for so long, so why did she suddenly marry you?”

Alexander was so angry that his face turned green.

Compared to what Jeanne’s mother had done to him, that matter was probably something Alexander could not tolerate even more.

All these years, he had actually been raising someone else’s daughter!

“Because my mother was pregnant and wanted me to be born in a legitimate way, she married you and even had sex with you once to make you think I’m your daughter.”

“Jeanne!” Alexander gritted his teeth.

“That’s not the most infuriating thing for you. Raising someone else’s child is indeed not a very pleasant thing to do, but your biggest failure is that you actually think my mother was doing this for the Lawrences’ assets! In that case, you probably don’t know my mother’s identity!” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Alexander was utterly stunned.

“Do you think my mother was more capable than you thought? She even forced you to sleep with her. You can’t beat her!”

At that moment, Alexander stared straight at Jeanne.

“My mother is...” Jeanne paused.

She originally thought that many things would become history. If no one cared about it, it would be buried completely.

“I don’t know if you’ve heard of the family who runs Delta Islands’ mafia, the Hills?”

Alexander’s eyes widened.

Jeanne looked at his expression and knew he must have heard of it.

“This family has a close relationship with the Sanders, but they also have their own power. Back then, the Sanders were able to take down the Duncans and become the ruler of the Harken because of the Hills’ support of them in secret. All these years, they have been working with the Sanders to benefit each other.

Jeanne said, “My mother, Penelope Thorn, or Penelope Hill, was the eldest daughter of the Hills. To stop her family from forcing her to marry someone she didn’t like, she came to Harken and hid her identity. She wanted to live a normal life, but she didn’t know she fell in love with... a married man.”

“Who?” Alexander frowned.

Who? Of course, it was her biological father.

“It definitely wasn’t you,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Alexander gritted his teeth.

“This person couldn’t promise my mother anything, and my mother refused to commit suicide because of this person. However, my mother found out she was pregnant after the two of them broke up. In order for me to be born, she chose to marry you, but she felt that marrying you was a loss. After all, she didn’t love you and didn’t want to force herself to sleep with you. So, after that once, she planned to repay you in another way.” Jeanne said, “Perhaps you think my mother’s way of doing things was unfair to you. It was unfair, but as you said, she could ignore the fact that you had a second family. In other words, she was supporting you to live your own life in her own way.”

Alexander said fiercely, “Do you think that as a man, I’m willing to accept her way? Since she didn’t like me, she shouldn’t have married me! Marrying me is a disgrace!”

“As I said, it was because of me. She didn’t want me to return to cruel Hills. She wanted to give me a normal life. Yes, I admit my mother’s actions were a little selfish, but she had no other choice. To give me a normal life, she had to maintain that loveless marriage with you, but she then made it up to you through her own ways. For example, she put her heart and soul into running Lawrence Enterprise and made it better.”
