Chapter 676: What Right Do You Have to Say You Love Me?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica could not sleep. After calling Michael, she suddenly became nervous yet excited.

Jeanne said they were only testing Michael, but it somehow made her want to... use that method to persuade Finn to stay.

If Finn knew that it was her first time and that there was nothing between her and Michael, would Finn be moved?

She really did not know how to make Finn believe in her, and sacrificing herself seemed to be her only choice.

However, would Finn really accept her? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Her heart raced as she thought of the millions of possibilities he would accept in her mind. However, when she thought of the rest, her heart sank.

She believed that with the current situation between her and Finn, not only would Finn not accept her, but he would even beat her to death.

The last time she bumped into Finn with a prostitute, did Finn not shut her out of the house?

At any time, in her relationship with Finn, he was always more willing to let go than her.

No matter who initiated the breakup or the “divorce”, she was the one who would be sad, and Finn could... get through it in one piece.

Monica started to feel a little sad the more she thought about it.

She did not sleep for most of the night as she was conflicted about her thoughts. The next day, she woke up with two dark circles under her eyes and thought she looked like a ghost.

Would Finn lose sleep over her? Would he lose sleep day after day because he was afraid of losing her?

She gritted her teeth and decided not to think too much about it. No matter the result, she still had to do what she had to do.

After washing up, she put on some makeup and called Jeanne.

“Well, you’re up early.” Jeanne teased.

At that moment, she was driving to Lawrence Enterprise.

“I’ve been having insomnia every night now. I think if this continues, I will have a nervous breakdown.”

“If you knew it would turn out like this, you shouldn’t have been so impulsive to help Michael in the first place.”

“I believe if I were given another hundred more choices, I would still choose to help him.” Monica was very certain.

She really did not regret helping Michael.

Even though things had turned out that way with Finn, she felt that under those circumstances, she would still choose to help Michael no matter how many times she was given a chance. She could not just stand by and watch him rot away. If she did that, and Michael lost everything in his life because of her, she would regret it.

Jeanne kept her eyes on the road and did not say anything more about Monica’s choice.

From Monica’s point of view, she chose to help Michael because Michael was worth it for her to help him. As for why it was worth it, perhaps how good of a person Michael was and how good he treated Monica were things that nobody else knew but were real. As for whether that kindness had a purpose... Before Monica realized it, Michael was definitely a good person.

It was understandable that Monica would not leave such a good person to rot away.

As Monica’s best friend, what she could do was restore the truth and minimize the damage done to Monica.

Jeanne tightened her grip on the steering wheel.

She had to admit that Michael was much more skilled than she thought.

It had been so long, and not only this time with Monica, but no one had been able to catch hold of any dirt on Michael even after all that had happened before. He was so meticulous that she felt a chill run down her spine. In that case, how could Monica, who had grown up in the ivory tower, be Michael’s opponent?

“Jeannie,” Monica called her from the other end of the phone.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

“I told Michael last night that I wanted to give myself to Finn, and today is the day,” Monica told Jeanne.

She wanted to tell Jeanne everything.

“What did he say?”

“He supports me.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Michael was indeed more complicated than she thought.

It was no wonder that even though Monica and Finn were in their current predicament, she still chose to stand on Michael’s side. Moreover, she had no regrets.

“Even so, you still have to go and verify whether Michael supports you verbally or mentally.” Jeanne was very serious about it.

“Actually, I don’t doubt Michael at all.” Monica voiced out her true thoughts from the depths of her heart. “But because all of you think there’s something wrong with him, I’m also willing to test him. Besides… Jeannie, you promised me that if I were to test him and find out that Michael isn’t who you think it is, you must make Fourth Master Swan come back and persuade Finn to stay with me. I’m really afraid of that *sshole, afraid that he won’t want me!”
