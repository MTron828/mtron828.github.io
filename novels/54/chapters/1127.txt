1128 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

“If I could, I really want to rebel! What do the Duncans’ great undertaking and the nation’s desire for revenge have to do with me? That’s the Duncans’ matter. That’s your leader’s matter. Why should everything fall on me? Why should I do anything? Why should I lose my freedom and humanity? From the moment I was born, my life has never been up to me to decide. Why–”

“Slap!” A tight slap landed on Edward’s face.

The loud noise almost scared Nox to death. He was such a bold person, but in that situation, he was as timid as a mouse.

He suddenly wanted to disappear into the crowd.

However, he just knelt there, not daring to make any noise, and even his breathing was careful.

“Haven’t you caused enough trouble?” Zachary asked Edward.

Edward’s eyes were bloodshot, and he kneeled with his back straight. His face was filled with stubborn resistance.

“Do you know how your mother died?”

“I don’t know!” Edward said ruthlessly, “I’ve never even met her. Why would I know how she died?

“Yes, she died after giving birth to me, but why did she have to give birth to me? Is it really because she loves me? Is it really? She was just leaving Alex a brother, a puppet who would die for him. Do I have to shed tears of gratitude for such a mother?”

“Edward, shut up!” Zachary had never thought that Edward would say such words.

He had never thought that Edward would one day talk back at him like that.

From the moment Edward was born, Edward had been trained for the sake of the Duncans.

They had chosen Nox and Finn for Edward not to be Edward’s companions but to increase Edward’s combat ability.

Everything was for the Duncans, but he did not expect to be questioned by Edward like that.

His body was trembling out of anger.

He was pissed off by Edward and had nowhere to vent his anger.

Today, he was warning Edward to take note of his status and what he should do. He should not mess up his own sense of propriety for a woman!

It was somewhat of a stalemate situation.

When Wade saw that Old Master Swan was so angry that he looked like he was about to die, he quickly tried to ease the situation. “Edward, you have to understand your father. Your father beheaded the Duncans in order to protect the Swans and the descendant of the Duncans. Now, after so many years of persistence, there’s finally a glimmer of hope for victory. Your father is also afraid of making a mistake, afraid that his own fault will lead to failure in the end. You’re his son, and he doesn’t want you to become a sinner. That’s why he’s a bit more aggressive. You have to understand.”

“I understand where he’s coming from, but has anybody ever understood me? Did anyone ask me if I wanted these things? Who has ever asked me what it feels like to be a man who can’t even protect his own wife and son?” Edward looked at his father coldly.

He stood up from the ground. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Nox was scared to death.

They had never dared to get up from the ground on their own when they were punished.

Without Old Master Swan’s permission, they did not even dare to move.

“The Duncans’ cause is your great cause, but it has never been mine!” Edward said.

Then, he turned around and left.

For the first time ever, he disobeyed his father’s order and strode away!
