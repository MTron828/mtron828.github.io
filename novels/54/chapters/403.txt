Chapter 404: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship Translation

“I’m here to check on Monica and see if she’s feeling better.”

“She’s fine. There’s no need to worry about her.” Gary’s words were direct.

Michael found the situation a little awkward.

He turned his head to look at Monica, who looked straight into his eyes and forced herself to smile. “Michael, I’m fine.”

“That’s good.” Michael said, “I thought you might find the hospital depressing, so I bought you a bunch of flowers to cheer you up. You said that no woman would reject champagne roses.”

Monica pursed her lips.

At that moment, she was a little speechless.

“I also bought some of your favorite fruits.” Michael waved the shopping bag in his hand.

Monica replied, “Thank you.”

Yes, she looked very distant.

“I’ll put these here.” Michael quietly put the things he bought on top of a cabinet.

After putting them there, he called out to them respectfully again, “Uncle and auntie, I’m heading off now.”

However, Gary ignored him while Ruby acknowledged him politely.

......

“Monica, I’ll head off now. You should get some good rest.” Michael smiled gently at Monica again.

Deep down, Monica felt a little bitter, like she had let Michael down.

Michael treated her really well, but at that moment, she watched him leave without saying a thing.

As the door to the ward closed, Monica began to feel bad for him.

She could never accept the feeling of not being to return the favor to others for treating her well because it would make her feel very uneasy.

“Since you’ve chosen to be with Finn, don’t think too much about it.” Gary glanced at his daughter and said sternly.

“I’m not overthinking it. I’m just thinking about how to explain it to Michael,” Monica said.

She was certain that she wanted to be with Finn, so she never thought of being entangled with Michael anymore.

“If you dare to let Finn down again, I’ll really break your legs.”

“I know, I know.” Monica was speechless.

All her father knew was to threaten her instead of care about how tormented she was right now.

With that, she took a deep breath, gritted her teeth, picked up the phone, and sent a message to Michael.

“I’m sorry, Michael. Let’s end this,” she thought to herself.

It was just as simple and direct as that.

Michael had never been one to pester others, and she had a feeling that Michael would understand her.

After sending the message, she heaved a sigh of relief.

She wanted to be genuine with her relationships.

Back then, although she was still married to Finn, she was certain that it was impossible for her to be with Finn. That was why she chose to give Michael a chance and agreed to start over if his parents agreed. Now that her relationship with Finn had rekindled, she had to sort out her relationship as soon as possible.

Michael did not reply to her message for a long time. After all, Michael had his pride too, and she understood that.

Therefore, she put down her phone and was about to continue lying down when her message rang.

Monica took a look.

It was Michael who replied, “You should recuperate first. Whatever it is, let’s wait until your injury’s healed. Your health is the most important.”

“I feel fine.” Monica edited the words.

“In that case, you don’t need to be hospitalized.”

“Michael, what I said just now is true.”

“I know,” the other person on the other side of the phone replied. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Monica’s eyes paused. What did he mean by he knew?

He said, “Don’t feel any burdened by it. I accept that you want to end things, but it’s just that before it ends, I want to talk to you in person. It’s not to try to salvage our relationship but to respect it.”

Monica bit her lip.

She found that she could never refuse Michael. From the first time Michael sent her home and told her that the best way to end a relationship was to start another one, she had felt that way.

Hence, she said, “Come to my ward after 8 p.m. tonight. I’ll tell my parents to go home tonight.”

“Okay.” The person on the other end of the phone agreed immediately.

Then, Monica put down the phone.

She admitted that what Michael said made a lot of sense. Even if they were going to break up, they should at least make it clear.

They could not end everything with just one message.

With that, she turned her head and looked at her parents. “Dad, Mom, aren’t you tired of staying with me all the time?”

“What’s there to be tired about?” Ruby was cleaning up the bowl that Monica used earlier.

“But I’ll feel bad.” It was rare for Monica to be so melodramatic. “You two don’t have to stay with me tonight. I have doctors, nurses, and senior nurses to take care of me. You guys should go back and get some rest. Dad, your health isn’t good anyway. No matter how good the hospital bed is, it’s still not as comfortable as yours at home.”
