Chapter 1408: Are You Saying Zoe Is Lying To Me?

Thank you readers!

As expected, he really hated Shelly. It was best that she stopped pestering him in the future because he never wanted to see her again in his life!

…

On Saturday, as soon as George left, Candice began to decorate for tonight’s birthday party.

As usual, George left Bamboo Garden after waking up in the morning.

In the past, when George left, he would leave for at least half a month. However, this time, he was just doing it for the sake of his own ego because he would be sent back at night. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Mom, are we celebrating Brother’s birthday tonight?” Paige had been following Candice.

Ever since Candice started living in Bamboo Garden, Paige had become her little tail.

“Do you want to celebrate your brother’s birthday?”

“Yes,” Paige replied loud and clear. “I’ve never celebrated my brother’s birthday or my father’s birthday, but they’ve all celebrated my birthday with me. I thought only I had a birthday and that no one else had one.”

Candice did not know whether to laugh or cry at Paige’s childish voice. However, she did find it a little sad. If Jeanne had not given birth to Paige back then, she believed this family would not feel like a family at all.

She hung up an accessory, squatted down, and patted Paige’s little head. “In the future, on

Daddy’s birthday, Brother’s birthday, and Paige’s birthday, I will celebrate them for you, okay?”

“Alright.” Paige was very excited. Her round eyes were bright. “In the future, Daddy, Brother, and I will celebrate Mommy’s birthday too.”

“Yes.” Candice smiled.

She was easily touched by Paige.

Around 5 p.m., everyone that Candice had invited was present. That included Edward who had gone out for a while because of some matters, Nox, his fiancée Zoe, Monica, and Nox.

Those were probably the people closest to Edward, but Candice felt a little embarrassed facing them.

“Do you need me to introduce you in private?” Edward seemed to be able to sense her discomfort and said considerately.

“Are you kidding me?!” Nox’s expression was rather exaggerated. “How could Candice not know me? How could she not know us?!”

He was unhappy that Edward was being too protective of Candice.

Edward’s face darkened as he glared at Nox, who was speechless at Edward’s response.

Monica could not help but laugh. “Nox, I didn’t realize you were so familiar with Candice.”

Nox was speechless. “Who do you think I am?”

Monica rolled her eyes.

“If you were still with Finn, you would’ve known that,” Nox said without holding back.

“You guys broke up?” Candice was a little surprised.

She did not hear that they had broken up. In fact, she thought that they were still dating and that they had a deep relationship.

Before Monica could speak, Nox continued, “They broke up the day before you and Edward got married. ”

Candice was speechless.

“Don’t worry. Both of them are very professional. Even if they have broken up, they will attend your birthday party without any disagreements because of Edward,” Nox said sarcastically.

No one knew if he was mocking Candice or Monica.

Speechless, Monica said, “Would it kill you to speak less?!”

Nox glanced at Monica. “Do you think I want to talk about you? Can’t you tell Edward is afraid that his wife will be embarrassed, so he wants us to liven up the atmosphere? If I don’t say a few words, how can she be comfortable with us?”

Candice could not help but look at Nox. She had to admit that Nox’s words did make the atmosphere less awkward.

“Don’t thank me. I don’t like being praised.” Nox noticed Candice’s gaze and said seriously.

Candice laughed.

At first, she was really worried that she would not get along well with them. After all, she had not been with Edward for long, so they had not hung out much.

Moreover, with Jeanne as Edward’s ex-wife, she was worried that they would ostracize her. However, she realized now that she was indeed overthinking things.

She introduced herself solemnly, “I’m Candice, Edward’s wife. Nice to meet you.”.
