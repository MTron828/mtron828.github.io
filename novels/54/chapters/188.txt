Chapter 189: You and Fourth Master Swan Have Different Standpoints

Finn took out the first aid kit and cut the bandage on Edward’s body bit by bit. He stopped the bleeding, applied the medicine again, and put on a new bandage.

“Who’s Kingsley?” Finn asked Fourth Master Swan while doing what he was doing.

Fourth Master Swan’s face darkened.

“Let Nox investigate. He shouldn’t be simple,” Finn said, “I just saw the fight between him and Nox. Kingsley didn’t use his full strength, but Nox was beaten down by him. I don’t know if you can compete with him because I didn’t see his full strength.”

“Okay,” Fourth Master Swan replied.

“I gave Jeanne all the materials from her case. Given her ability in the business world and Kingsley by her side, I think the case shouldn’t be difficult to solve,” Finn said, “So during this period, I suggest that you rest well. If there’s a need, I’ll support her.”

“Okay.”

Finn treated Fourth Master Swan’s wound very seriously.

Nox came up from downstairs with a green bag on his back. Looking at Fourth Master Swan’s bloody back, he could not help but ask, “You were also beaten down by Kingsley?!”

Fourth Master Swan did not answer.

“Who the hell is that guy? I’m going to have a grudge with him for eight lifetimes,” Nox said fiercely.

Still, no one in the room paid attention to him.

At this moment, Teddy also walked in from outside the door.

Looking at his master’s back, he was scared and did not dare to look. “Master, the detention center sent Ms. Lawrence’s cell phone over. When you left, you forgot to take it.”

“Bring it over,” Edward instructed.

Teddy quickly took the phone and handed it to Edward.

Edward took it. He did not look at it but held it tightly in his hand.

“By the way, Ms. Cardellini, Dr. Jones’ wife who came to look for you yesterday,” Teddy suddenly reported.

Finn paused for a moment.

At the next second, he became indifferent again and continued to bandage Edward’s wound.

“Why was Monica looking for Fourth Master Swan?” Nox asked from the side before Edward could say anything.

“He said that it was Fourth Master who caused Ms. Lawrence to be arrested, so he can’t just stand by and watch. However, Fourth Master wasn’t around, so she left after making a fuss,” Teddy replied.

“Monica isn’t stupid. She knew to look for Fourth Master Swan to help Jeanne,” Nox commented.

“Ms. Cardellini asked me to pass a message to Fourth Master,” Teddy said respectfully.

Edward, who was lying on the bed, still looked indifferent.

It seemed that to Edward, other than Jeanne, no other woman was of any interest to him.

“Ms. Cardellini said that although you have a lot of scums by your side, she advises you to be a good person!” Teddy said word by word.

Edward’s eyes clearly moved.

“She also added that the scums refer to Young Master Winter and...” Teddy glanced at the man who had been treating Edward’s wounds. “Dr. Jones.”

The room instantly... fell silent.

It was awkward.

Nox was initially on the verge of breaking down. The thought of being beaten up by that unknown man, Kingsley, made him feel all sorts of displeasure and pain all over his body. Now that he heard Teddy’s words, he immediately laughed out loud, and he could not control his laughter.

Teddy was baffled by the laughter.

Edward and Finn looked at Nox coldly.

Nox finally stopped laughing. He said, “Teddy, I wonder how you managed to live this long!”

Teddy looked straight at Young Master Winter. He had no idea what he was laughing at.

“Are you stupid?!” Nox said straightforwardly.

Teddy’s expression changed.

He could also see that Young Master Winter was mocking him.

“Fourth Master Swan, why did you let Teddy stay by your side? Aren’t you afraid that you’ll be angered to death by him one day?!” Nox gloated.

“Get out!” Edward’s tone was very cold.

“Get out, Teddy!” Nox said to Teddy.

“Both of you, get out!”

“...” Nox rolled his eyes.

He still stood up and walked out of Edward’s room with Teddy.

In the room, only Edward and Finn were left.

The two of them were relatively silent, so they did not say much during the treatment.

After Finn treated Edward’s wound, he tidied up his medical kit. “Fourth Master, do you want me to send Jeanne’s phone over for her?”

Fourth Master Swan said, “Leave it here first.”

“Okay.” Finn nodded. “I’ll be going out first.”

“Okay.”

Finn left.

He knew that Fourth Master Swan was not a person who liked to be disturbed.

He closed the door.

Edward opened his eyes.

He looked at the phone in his hand, the phone that he had given to Jeanne.

‘Kingsley... What’s his relationship with Jeanne?!’

...

On the streets of South Hampton City.

Jeanne sat in the back.

Kingsley sat next to her.

Miles was driving.

It turned out that Miles picked up Kingsley and drove him to the Swans’ manor to look for Jeanne.

Jeanne did not doubt that Kingsley could go to the Swans’ compound alone to look for her. She just felt that he had never been so impulsive.

She did not speak.

If Kingsley did not speak, she would not say anything no matter what.

It was very quiet in the car.

Instead, Miles, the professional killer, was not calm anymore. He could not help but ask, “Where are we going now?!”

The moment Kingsley got in the car, he asked Miles to drive.

Afterward, Kingsley did not say anything else

Who knew how many times Miles had circled the streets of South Hampton City?!

Could it be that he would send Kingsley back to the international airport?!

Kingsley turned to look at Miles. “Hotel.”

“Understood.” Miles nodded.

They finally had a destination.

Inside the car, it was no longer so stiff.

Kingsley asked Jeanne directly, “How far have you progressed with Fourth Master Swan?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She glanced at Kingsley and said nonchalantly, “We never progressed.”

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed. “Nothing happened? What about you kissing him?”

“Wasn’t that to stop you guys from fighting?” Jeanne was a little flustered.

“Are you afraid that I’ll beat him to death?”

“Whether he dies or not has nothing to do with me. I just know that if you really beat Fourth Master Swan to death, I won’t be able to escape unscathed from Harken! I plan to leave after I’ve finished my business and never return to this city again.”

Of course, Kingsley was not convinced by Jeanne’s words. “Was it also an accident that you slept on the same bed as him?!”

“Yes, we slept!” Jeanne admitted generously.

Kingsley’s face turned red.

Jeanne quickly explained, “I just slept next to him. It was that simple. We didn’t do anything!”

Although Kingsley knew very well that Jeanne would not lie to him, he still felt a little unhappy.

He forced himself not to probe further and asked again, “Is Fourth Master Swan serious about you?”

“Isn’t that his business? Why don’t you go ask him?” Jeanne clearly did not want to say anything more.

Regarding the matter between her and Fourth Master Swan, she also felt that she could not explain it clearly.

It was estimated that the entire country now felt that she and Fourth Master Swan were having an affair.

In fact, she herself could not figure out if she was having an affair with Fourth Master Swan.

While she was feeling a little irritable, Kingsley suddenly said, “I heard that in order to get you out of the detention center, Fourth Master Swan mortgaged the Swans’ real estate to the prosecution office.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She looked at Kingsley in disbelief.

“I’m not telling you so that you’ll be touched. I’m just telling you clearly that even if Fourth Master Swan is serious about you, don’t even think about it!” Kingsley said slowly, “There’s no chance between you and him!”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She turned her head toward the car window and looked at the streets of South Hampton City without saying a word.

Kingsley said, “The two of you... Have different standpoints.”
