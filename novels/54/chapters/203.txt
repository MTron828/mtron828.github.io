Chapter 204: A Reversal, and a Slap in the Face

In the court.

Everyone looked at Judah as if he had suddenly changed into a different person.

He calmly walked toward Jeanne.

Then, he said to the judge, “Undeniably, according to the testimony of the two witnesses, it seems that the matter of my client profiting for herself has been established, but in reality, there are many loopholes.”

Everyone looked at Judah attentively.

“Firstly, Tenda said that my client knew that he was short of money? My client had only returned from abroad for less than a month, and she has been busy with the construction of the Lawrence Enterprise’s e-commerce project. How could she know that the boss of a mere construction company is having a hard time making ends meet? I don’t need Tenda’s answer to conclude that even the people from his company didn’t know. Otherwise, the news of a construction company’s boss being in debt due to gambling would’ve been all over the news. I don’t believe that the reporters in South Hampton City aren’t sharp enough!

“Secondly, Tenda said that he personally made a payment to my client and didn’t inform my client because he wanted to avoid suspicion. When he made the payment, he didn’t even send a text message. Was it to avoid suspicion, or was it to not let my client know?!

Judah’s expression became more serious, “Thirdly, just now, Tenda and Adrian both admitted that they’re very close. Can I suspect that the two of them secretly plotted everything and framed my client?!”

“You’re slandering me!” Adrian suddenly became agitated.

“Calm down!” The judge rebuked angrily.

Adrian calmed himself down. “I accuse the defendant’s lawyer of attacking and insulting me personally.”

“Whether I’m attacking you or not, I have evidence,” Judah said word by word.

Adrian was suddenly stunned.

Judah took out a document from his seat and said, “Firstly, it’s this dual contract. I believe that everyone present has seen this contract before. The judge has seen it, the trial bench has seen it, the prosecution’s lawyer, the witnesses, the defendant, and I have all seen it before. I just don’t know if you’ve seen the other one.”

He took out another contract.

“This is the contract signed by the Lawrence Enterprise and MUK. I have a lot of copies here. Please distribute them for me.”

The staff went forward and distributed the contracts one by one.

“If you check carefully, you’ll find that the contract is the same as my client’s dual contract. What does this mean? It means that the contracts were written by the same person. Of course, this contract wasn’t written by my client. My client only discussed the project. As for the terms and conditions of the contract, they’re the job of the secretarial office of the Lawrence Enterprise’s general affairs department. In other words, this dual contract is related to Lunetta Walker, the secretary-general, Lunetta!”

As soon as he said that, Adrian was clearly a little nervous.

His eyes flickered, and he was a little restless.

At that moment, he could not help but look at Joshua in the audience seats.

Joshua panicked.

Eden also saw Joshua’s nervousness and said in a low voice, “Calm down.”

Joshua gritted his teeth.

In the court, Judah asked again, “Your Honor, can Lunetta appear in court?”

The judge was a little hesitant.

Judah said, “Today is Thursday. I’m sure that Lunetta is working at the Lawrence Enterprise, and a round trip from the court to the enterprise will only take 20 minutes.”

The judge and the trial bench discussed for a moment and said, “Permission granted. We’ll now use formal means to get Lunetta Walker to appear in court. The court will be temporarily adjourned for half an hour.”

The announcement was over.

The judge left first, then the people in the court also left one after another.

Judah walked toward Jeanne.

Jeanne and Judah talked in a low voice.

She felt a burning gaze on her.

Jeanne did not even dare to raise her head.

She was afraid that Kingsley would catch her red-handed.

The scene was not too quiet at this moment.

Joshua had run out of the court at this moment. He went to an empty corner and followed Eden’s instructions. He hurriedly gave Lunetta a call and gave a few simple instructions. The next moment, he heard Lunetta say, the people from the court had gone to the Lawrence Enterprise Corporation to look for her.

As such, Joshua had no choice but to hang up the phone.

He returned to his seat.

Eden looked at Joshua’s sweaty face. “How is it?”

“Lunetta is a smart woman. We can rest assured.”

Eden nodded.

At this moment, his expression was still a little ugly.

Half an hour later, the court resumed.

Lunetta appeared in court.

Judah continued, “Ms. Walker, may I ask if the two contracts in front of you were both drawn up by you?”

“I did the first contract between the Lawrence Enterprise and MUK. As it is a large-scale project of the Lawrence Enterprise, the specifications are relatively high, so I was personally involved. At that time, Director Lawrence came to the company and specifically asked me about it. It was indeed done by me. However, the second contract... I haven’t seen it before.”

“Are you sure you haven’t seen it before?” Judah asked.

Lunetta looked very calm. “No, but after your reminder, these two contracts are indeed somewhat similar. As a professional, I have to say that it’s very normal for contracts to be similar because the terms and conditions are almost the same. Besides, I feel that...”

Lunetta seemed to be a little afraid to speak.

“You mustn’t hide anything in the court,” Judah said bluntly.

“When I was drafting the contract with MUK, I received praise from everyone in the company. At that time, Director Hoffman of the general affairs department even commended me at a meeting. Everyone knows this contract was written very well, so it’s very normal for it to be copied by others.”

“So, what you’re saying is that this contract was done by someone who copied you.”

“It’s just my personal opinion.” Lunetta was very calm.

Among the audience, Joshua’s nervousness gradually eased.

He had not treated the woman well for nothing. She was indeed very smart.

“Okay. I got it. Your Honor, I still have a witness. Can you allow me to let the witness come to court?” Judah asked

“Yes.”

At this moment, a man walked into the courtroom.

No one knew him.

Only Lunetta was a little nervous.

She unconsciously clenched her hands.

“May I know your name and occupation?”Judah asked.

“My Name Is Horace Whitfield. I’m a contract professional lawyer consultant for the Lawrence Enterprise.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Does that mean that you work with Ms. Walker a lot?”

“Yes, we’ve been working together for many years.”

“Have you seen this contract before?” Judah handed the contract to Horace.

Horace looked at it and nodded. “I have. This is a contract that Luna asked me to look at in private, probably last month. She said that it was requested by a friend of hers.”

“Are you sure that this contract was given to you by Ms. Walker? Are you sure that it was this contract?”

“Due to my profession, I have an impression of the contracts that I’ve handled. I still remember that I pointed out a few unreasonable aspects to Luna at that time. For example, I asked Luna to change this term at that time,” Horace said affirmatively.

“Is there evidence to prove that this contract was given to you by Ms. Walker?” Judah asked.

Horace seemed to be a little hesitant.

“You’re at court. All of your words and actions have legal effects. Please consider that, Mr. Whitfield.”

Horace said, “I have a video record.”

“Where did you get it?”

“At that time, Luna came to my office to look for me with this contract. Coincidentally, there was a camera in my office, so it was recorded.”

“Please show me your video.”

Horace took out his phone and opened the video’s copy. He handed it to Judah.

After Judah looked at it, he got the staff to pass it to the judges and the trial bench.

At this moment, Lunetta’s expression changed.

“Your Honor, may I ask if the video can be shown in public?”

The judge nodded. “Yes.”

The video was shown to everyone.

Lunetta took the document and walked into Horace’s office. The two of them were revising the contract together. The camera was in high definition. After zooming in, they could see the words on the contract.

After the video was played, the crowd was in an uproar again.

Judah asked, “Your Honor, is the video enough to show that this contract was written by Ms. Walker?”

“It’s enough.”

Judah looked at Lunetta and asked, “What else do you have to say, Ms. Walker?”

At that moment, Lunetta was no longer as calm as she was when she first arrived.

Back then, Lunetta had indeed asked the lawyer she was familiar with to take a look at the contract because she wanted to be more perfect. She did not want to arouse too much suspicion from the other party, so she did not take too many measures. Lunetta only knew that it was not safe to keep electronic records, but she did not think that there would be surveillance cameras. More importantly, she never thought that Jeanne would be able to determine that she was involved based on two contracts. This had nothing to do with her in the first place.

“Ms. Walker, there’s no need to be nervous. The evidence is clear. It’s futile no matter how hard you try to argue. Now, you just need to tell me the reason you wrote this contract,” Judah said.

In an instant, the defendant, who was originally in a passive position, had completely taken the initiative!
