Jeanne replied, “What is it?”

“I want to divorce that bastard Finn Jones.”

“Aren’t you always arguing about divorce?” Jeanne Lawrence said calmly.

“I’m serious this time.”

Jeanne’s eyes shifted. “Is it because of Micheal Ross?”

“That’s just one aspect. The most important point is that I really can’t stand to spend any more time with him!” The other end was still visibly upset.

“Monica, I really can’t tell you what to do with your marriage. But from my personal opinion, I think you’d better not provoke Micheal Ross,” Jeanne Lawrence said bluntly.

“Why?”

“He grew up in a complicated family. To put it bluntly, he’s too shrewd. You never know what he is thinking.”

“I just need to know that he loves me.”

“You’ll be amazed by how rational politicians are.” Jeanne was afraid that Monica wouldn’t understand, so she continued, “In other words, when it comes to benefits versus emotions, he’ll always choose the former.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“No, you haven’t interacted with Micheal. You don’t know him. He’s different from other politicians.”

“Sooner or later, it will be the same.”

“F*ck. You haven’t even interacted with him and you’re already making such a conclusion?” Monica Cardellini cursed.

It was because she had seen it happening.

However, Jeanne could not blame Monica Cardellini for not listening to her. No one would be able to understand it unless they have gone through that situation.

Monica said, “In short, my divorce with Finn has nothing to do with Micheal. I simply don’t want to spend any more time with Finn. I simply want him to get out of my sight. And I don’t want to see him for the rest of my life.”

“Your emotions make me feel that you’re actually unwilling to accept this. You’re unwilling to accept that you’ve made lots of sacrifices for Dr. Finn Jones.”

“No!” Monica denied. “I have no feelings for him now! Besides, that night was his birthday. He even wanted us to start over.”

“You refused?” Jeanne frowned.

“Yes, I did!” Monica was rather pleased with herself. “I told him I didn’t love him at all!”

“Monica, do you know that you’re acting like this now because you’re afraid that you’ll go back on your word? That’s why you’re desperately trying to cut off your attachment to him.”

“No!” Monica said firmly.

“Then why are you so upset?”

“I’m upset because my father forbade me from getting a divorce! I just came out of my house and I told him that I wanted to get a divorce. However, my father threatened me and said that if I dared to get a divorce, he would disown me immediately. Am I really his biological daughter?!” Jeanne could sense Monica’s raging emotions from the other end of the phone. “Do you think that I’m adopted? Maybe that bastard Finn Jones is actually my father’s biological son!”

Jeanne rolled her eyes.

Only Monica would have such a magical imagination.

“Actually, I don’t support your divorce either. You shouldn’t act rashly. Think about it before you make a decision. There’s no need to get a divorce right away after rejecting him. Calm down and think it through. It’s been three years anyway, so there’s no rush.”

“It’s been three years, so I know very well that I must leave him! Jeanne, I’ve really thought it through. I really won’t fall in love with him again. Even if I don’t get together with Micheal in this lifetime, I won’t be together with Finn! Right now, I don’t even want to see him for even a second! You don’t even know how uncomfortable it is for me to be living under the same roof as him. I have to face someone I hate every day. I’m afraid I’ll suffocate until my boobs sag…”

The person on the other end was talking agitatedly like a machine gun, but she suddenly stopped.

Monica watched as Dr. Finn Jones exited from the elevator.

She had just returned from the Cardellini’s family villa when she received Jeanne Lawrence’s call at the elevator. She had been worried that she wouldn’t be able to talk at home, but she hadn’t expected him to return at this hour.

She just stared at Finn, wondering what he had heard.

Monica only knew that she had spoken too quickly so she had not been able to control herself. In any case, she had said everything that was on her mind.
