875 Accumulating Power, Return to South Hampton City

Therefore, it was not up to her to make the decision.

Lucy agreed. She had no right to speak.

When her clothes were finally off, Kingsley just stared at her body. He looked at the many scars on her body. Some new, and some old. They looked hideous.

“Didn’t you always used to deal with these things in the past?” Kingsley asked.

“I was still young then and loved looking pretty,” Lucy said nonchalantly. “Now that I’m old, I don’t seem to want to do it that anymore.”

“I don’t like it,” Kingsley said bluntly.

“I’ll get rid of it,” Lucy said.

The Hills had many talented doctors who were first-class surgeons as well. These scars were like a drop in the ocean in their surgeries.

Kingsley suddenly reached out and grabbed the back of her head with his large hand to get her body closer to him, but Lucy instinctively used both her hands to resist her approach. Kinsley frowned slightly. When she realized what she had done, Lucy lowered her hands and pressed her body against his.

After that, enduring Kingsley’s libido was all that was on her mind.

…

Melinda was waiting outside as Lucy left Kingsley’s room. Lucy glanced at her but didn’t respond.

“Did you do it with Mr. Hill?” Melinda asked her.

Though there was no need to ask. It was obvious.

Lucy stopped in her tracks and said, “Melinda, if you want to stay by Mr. Hill’s side for a long time, it’s best you don’t have any thoughts of jealousy. Mr. Hill hates dealing with emotional matters. You’d better understand that now.”

“Are you threatening me?”

“I’m just reminding you out of kindness,” Lucy said. “Of course, it’s up to you whether or not you want to listen.”

With that, she left.

Melinda stared at Lucy’s back as she walked away. She gritted his teeth, furious.

She had accompanied Kingsley all this time, only venting his frustrations on her. He never looked for any other woman, which was something Kingsley had never done in his long life. She had clearly heard that when Lucy was with Kingsley, he had many women around him as well. However, when he was with her, she had been the only one.

She thought that she was different to Kingsley. However, today, Kingsley and Lucy actually had sex again.

There was no way she was tolerating this!

…

Jeanne was lying on the chaise lounge in her room, seemingly waiting for her, when Lucy returned to her room.

Seeing that she had returned, she couldn’t help but smile. “Kingsley’s still spry.”

Jeanne had been waiting for Lucy for three hours.

Lucy also smiled. She did not hold back from Jeanne. “It’s a pity that I’m old.”

Jeanne looked at her.

Lucy said, “My legs are weak. I’m going to take a shower first.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

Lucy went to the bathroom to wash up. Looking at the marks on her body, she smiled bitterly. How long would such days last?

Perhaps not long at all, as Kingsley would eventually get tired of her.

Once she was done, she wore a silk bathrobe that showed off her good figure.

No wonder Kingsley liked it so much.

Jeanne looked at Lucy’s flirtatious expression indifferently.

“He wanted to discuss with me about us returning to South Hampton City next month.” Lucy took out a cigarette and handed one to Jeanne.

“Yeah.” Jeanne said, “You know very well that I won’t let Monica marry Michael.”

“That won’t impact our mission much,” Lucy insisted. “You could also break off the engagement at the wedding.”

“It’ll be a little more difficult to expose Michael at the wedding, though.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She had actually thought about it.

The best way was to let Monica and Michael release Michael’s video in front of everyone during the wedding so that everyone could see his ugliness. This way, Monica could reject the marriage in front of everyone, and Michael would have no excuse to go back on his word.

However, it would not be easy to tamper with Michael’s wedding.

“Think about it. I believe you can.” Lucy had absolute trust in her.

Jeanne was silent.

Lucy said, “If we don’t find this person from the Duncans, Kingsley will never be able to answer to the Sanders.”

“Alright. I’ll think about it.” Jeanne nodded.

“If you can’t figure it out, come to me again. As for today, I’m feeling a little sleepy.” Lucy smiled.

Jeanne understood. After all, she had been through this before too.
