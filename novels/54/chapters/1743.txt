Chapter 1744: Parent-Child Sports Day

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox once thought that as long as he took a fancy to someone, he would definitely be able to capture their hearts. However, only now did he realize that there was always someone who looked down on him.

Nox did not say too much about himself either. After all, he just wanted someone to accompany him sometimes, and at that thought, he suddenly found himself a little miserable.

He used to have a lot of women and friends by his side, but now, it seemed like he was the only one left. It was not that he did not treat Edward and Finn as friends anymore, but because they were all married and busy so he knew not to disturb them often. That was why he was alone.

Nox finished the glass of wine, ate a bowl of stew, paid for it, and left. It was really late, and he did not want to waste any more time. Although Shelly never waited for him, it would affect her sleep every time he went back late. He even told the driver to drive faster. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When they reached home, Nox opened the door carefully as usual, afraid of making too much noise. Unexpectedly, Shelly was still sitting on the couch, watching TV in the living room.

Shelly kept to an excellent schedule, which was basically the same as Bella’s, and that was why she would never stay up late. 10 p.m. at night was considered late for her, so it was rare that she was awake tonight.

Of course, Nox did not dare to have high expectations. Perhaps Shelly had stayed up late because she was watching a television drama.

As he walked into the house calmly, Shelly turned to look at him. “You’re finally back. Have you been busy with work recently?” “Are you waiting for me?” Nox asked with uncertainty.

“Yes.”

“Why are you waiting for me?” Nox’s heart was beating faster.

He did not expect Shelly to stay up for him.

“Tomorrow is Bella’s parent-child sports day. You said last week that you would join Bella for it,” Shelly said bluntly.

Nox’s smile disappeared without a trace.

“Bella has been talking about you going with her all night. Can you see if you can make it? If you can’t, I’ll go with Bella tomorrow.” Shelly was very considerate as she did not want to make things difficult for Nox.

However, in Nox’s eyes, it was a form of politeness, and he thought he was treated that way because she did not see him as family.

He said, “I’ll go. I promised Bella, and I won’t go back on my word.”

“Are you sure? You seem very busy recently.” Shelly tried to confirm it with him again.

She did not want to hold Nox back from his work.

“Sure,” Nox replied.

Seeing that Nox was determined to join them tomorrow, Shelly said, “Okay, it starts at 2 p.m. tomorrow.”

“Yes, I’ll go to the company in the morning to delegate some work. Then, I’ll meet you at the kindergarten at 2 p.m. sharp.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded. “It’s getting late. You should rest early.” “I’m not sleepy yet, so I’ll watch some TV for a while.”

“Sure,” Shelly replied before getting up and leaving the sofa.

It seemed she would only listen to whatever he said but would never ask him to do anything. What he wanted the most right now was for Shelly to act coquettishly in front of him and say how afraid she was of sleeping alone. However, he would probably never witness such a scene in his life.

The moment Nox sat down on the sofa, Shelly stopped in her tracks. “By the way, have you had dinner Nox?”

“I have.”

Upon hearing that, Shelly returned to her room.

Actually, she had been saving some food for Nox every night and putting it in the fridge. If Nox had not eaten dinner, he would see it when he opened the fridge.

Tonight, Shelly was just confirming with Nox whether he had been having dinner every night because she was worried that Nox would not even think of opening the fridge. However, she had obviously worried too much. After all, Nox would never starve himself.

The next day. Nox went to the company first. The pile of work that he had arranged yesterday was supposed to be done in one day, but now, it was condensed into half a day. Therefore, Nox worked non-stop the entire morning. After hosting one meeting, another group of people came over to start the second meeting.

He was in meetings the entire morning. When they finally ended at 1 p.m., he returned to his office and left the company without even taking a sip of water.

His assistant followed him, and seeing his hurried footsteps, he quickly said, “President Winter, you haven’t had lunch yet.. Do you want me to go to the canteen to get you some food before you leave? Or do you want me to order takeout for you?”
