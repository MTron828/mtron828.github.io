They rushed to the emergency room, where Michael was sitting at the door in the corridor.

All the doctors and nurses were surrounding him, but he refused to move. His entire body was covered in blood, and no one was allowed to get close to him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Reese looked at Michael and rushed over. “Michael, I beg you. Please don’t torture yourself like this. I beg you...”

Nevertheless, Michael remained unmoved. It was as if he did not hear her, and his entire body was frozen on the spot.

“Your father has left me, and if you leave me too, what should I do? How am I supposed to live? Do you want me to die with you? Do you want us to die together so that we can go see your father...”

Reese’s crying was so heart-wrenching that it was unbearable to look at.

At that moment, Monica could not stand it anymore. She hurriedly went over and asked, “Michael, what’s wrong with you?”

What was wrong with him to want to torture his body like that?

When Michael heard Monica’s voice, he seemed to have regained consciousness.

He raised his head, revealing his face that was covered in blood. He looked terrifying.

Seeing Monica and how anxious she looked, he asked, “Why are you here?”

“Don’t worry about that. Hurry up and get yourself to the operating theater. Go,” Monica said anxiously.

However, Michael looked at Monica and suddenly smiled even though his entire face was covered in injuries.

He said, “Monica, I’m fine. You don’t have to worry about me.”

“How are you fine? Hurry up and go to get your wounds treated. You’re losing a lot of blood. What will happen if you die?” The thought of death still scared Monica.

“I won’t die, really,” Michael said. As he spoke, tears suddenly streamed down his face.

Monica was frightened by Michael’s appearance.

The first time she saw Michael crying was that day in the garage. It was because he was sad about his father, and the paparazzi even took photos of him.

Now, this was the second time she saw Michael crying.

Was he in a lot of pain, or did he encounter something else?

She could not help but hold Michael’s bloodied hand.

“Michael, go to the emergency room now. Just put everything aside for now and deal with it once you have recovered, okay?”

Her voice was much softer now as she was trying her best to calm him down.

She did not wish to see Michael, a man who had always been proud, so defeated.

“I can’t recover,” Michael suddenly said miserably.

“Medical treatment is very advanced nowadays, and anything can be cured. You saw how badly Finn was injured, but he has recovered now. Trust me. Please,” Monica said emotionally as she was frightened by Michael’s appearance.

“Here.” Michael held Monica’s hand and placed her hand on his chest. “This can’t be cured anymore.”

Monica was stunned.

She knew what Michael was talking about but did not know what to say to him.

Then, Michael suddenly fell to the ground.

Monica quickly went up to hold him before he fainted on her shoulders.

The doctors and nurses were also shocked.

“Hurry up and send him to the emergency room. Quick,” the doctor said in a panic.

A few doctors and nurses quickly went up to help Michael up, intending to help him into the emergency room.

However, Michael grabbed Monica’s hand tightly.

Monica tried her best to push him away with the help of other doctors and nurses, but they could not.

Seeing that, Reese cried even worse, not caring about her image as a rich lady anymore. She cried out, “Michael, let go of Monica. Let go. Please stay alive. I beg you...”

Monica gritted her teeth and used all her strength to finally pry Michael’s hand away from hers.

After she pried it away, the doctors and nurses quickly placed Michael on a moving bed beside her and pushed him into the emergency room.

When Reese saw Michael enter the emergency room, she fell to the ground dejectedly.

Tears kept falling down her face, and she looked extremely pitiful.

In the end, Monica’s heart softened.

She could still feel Michael’s determination and his strength as he held her hand.

At that, her heart ached.
