1099 Lucy’s Resistance

That night, Lucy suffered everything from Kingsley. She even felt that she might die in bed.

At that moment, Kingsley stopped and lay on top of her, motionless.

Lucy did not dare to act rashly.

Even though her body was in pain, she really wanted to get up and check if… However, she did not dare to move.

As long as Kingsley was here, she could not move. She endured it painfully for a long time until Kingsley finally left her.

The moment he left, Kingsley seemed to have touched a sore spot for her, forcing her to endure it and not cry out.

Her face was really pale, but Kingsley did not notice as he got off her bed.

Lucy loved red so much that even her bed sheets were bright red.

Hence, if Kingsley had not looked down at his lower body when he was putting on his clothes, he might not have known that Lucy… was covered in blood.

Upon closer inspection, Lucy’s lower body was wet.

He thought it was…

His expression sank.

At that moment, he finally realized that Lucy’s face, which she had been trying so hard to hide, was completely drained of blood.

However, Kingsley did not react to it.

He just stared at Lucy intently — at her body that was trembling from the pain, and it was becoming increasingly obvious in his eyes. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Then, Kingsley turned around and left without looking back.

Thank goodness he left because what Lucy had hoped for the most now was for Kingsley to leave. Only after he left could she ask for help.

With that, she made herself get out of bed.

Her legs were covered in blood, and she forced herself to stand on the ground. However, an excruciating pain caused her to fall to the ground.

Fortunately, her room was carpeted. In terms of enjoyment in that sense, she had never mistreated herself.

She fell to the ground and lay there for a second, not getting up again.

After all, her lower body was in great pain, and she did not want to put more pressure on it. She used her elbows to support her body until she was in a crawling position.

She crawled to the corner of the room and picked up the trench coat on the ground.

Her phone was inside, and she needed to make a call now.

She instinctively wanted to give Jeanne a call, but she held back. If Jeanne found out that her body had been abused by Kingsley, she would probably have a fight with him again.

She really did not want to cause any conflict between them.

Hence, at that moment. she called the doctor directly. “Mike, I think I’m injured... Come to my room for a moment.”

“Alright, I’ll be there right away.” The other party immediately agreed.

Lucy put down her phone, and the moment she let go, she just lay there on the ground. The crawling position did not look good, and she might as well just wait for help.

Therefore, she just lay there and waited for Mike’s arrival.

She waited for quite a while.

Logically speaking, it took Mike at most two minutes to get from his room to hers. Even if he went to prepare some medical equipment, it would only take five minutes at most. However, she seemed to have waited for more than that.

She picked up the phone and dialed again. The phone rang a few times before it was connected.

“Ms. Harmon,” he said respectfully.

“Why aren’t you here yet?”

“I’m at the door.”

“Come in. The door is unlocked.”

“Mr. Thorn is here.” The other party was even more respectful when he said that.

Lucy’s finger moved slightly.

It turned out that Kingsley had stopped him.

Lucy’s heart still ached a little. Even if she could not arouse a trace of pity from him, he should at least let her take care of her body.

Was it all because she did not complete her task that he was punishing her like that?

Lucy pondered over it for a moment.

She could not afford to offend Kingsley, and since Kingsley wanted to teach her a lesson, she could only silently accept it.

She said, “In that case, you can go back.”

Then, she put her phone down and forced herself to calm down. After that, she thought about how to heal herself.

There was a first aid kit in every room. If she used a mirror, she should be able to apply medicine on her wound or even stitch the wound up.

At that thought, she mustered her courage.

Just as she was about to continue crawling forward, a man’s tall figure stood in front of her, blocking her way.

In fact, she did not need to think to know who it was. Other than Kingsley, who else would dare to enter her room so brazenly?

He looked coldly at her sorry state.

She clenched her fists. Suddenly, she felt that perhaps death was nothing more than that.

She said, “Why don’t you just kill me?”

She made it very clear to Kingsley.

...

Sometimes, living was really tiring. Her body and mind were so exhausted that she would rather be dead.

She had seen too many deaths in the Hills that she did not think it was scary.

Kingsley’s expression turned cold, and his ruthlessness could be felt.

At that moment, Lucy was no longer afraid. After all, she was not even afraid of death. What was there to be afraid of?

At most, she would be tortured again. No matter how cruel the method was, how cruel could it be?

“Lucy, are you going to beg me for mercy?” Kingsley asked her coldly.

She would not admit defeat or beg for mercy. It was even more unlikely that she would ask him for help.

Lucy really wanted to laugh sarcastically.

If begging for mercy worked on Kingsley, did it not mean that the assassins of the Hills who had died at his hands had died unjustly?

Kingsley suddenly squatted down and grabbed Lucy’s chin, forcing her to look up at him and his angry face.

“Speak!”

...

Lucy took in Kingsley’s rage and watched as he stood in front of her, looking like he might kill her.

She bit her lips tightly and remained silent.

She finally figured it out and was fine with dying. If she was dead, she would not have to face all the cruelty the man had shown her.

Then, she would not have to endure the intense pain in her heart.

If she was dead, everything would be over.

“Lucy! I told you to speak!” Kingsley shouted at her fiercely.

The expression on his face turned crueler at her resistance to him.

According to Lucy’s analysis of Kingsley, that was the prelude to a murder.

She had accepted that she was going to die, and once one was truly unafraid of death, one would be fearless.

“Lucy!” Kingsley clenched his teeth and stared at Lucy’s lips. He watched as she bit her lips and refused to say anything.

With a ferocious expression on his face, he forcefully pried open Lucy’s mouth.

Lucy bit her lips even harder.

However, Kingsley was also very strong.

Lucy felt waves of pain, but she did not open her lips.

Right before she died, she wanted to go against Kingsley just that once.

She would not do anything Kingsley asked her to as she wanted Kingsley to experience the feeling of not being respected and not being cared for.

She just kept resisting with all her might and persisted for a long time, so long that Kingsley finally compromised.

Just when Lucy thought that Kingsley’s brute force was going to break her jaw, Kingsley let go.

He looked at the blood flowing from her lips and her teeth and then at the burning hatred in Lucy’s eyes.

He got up abruptly.

After letting go of Lucy, he turned around and left, slamming the door behind him. He slammed it so hard that the door shook.

Lucy leaned her face against the thick carpet. She had no more strength left!

However, an emotionless smile appeared on her face.

Finally, for once, she went against Kingsley. Even if it might not have ended well, it was the most satisfying thing she had done before she died!
