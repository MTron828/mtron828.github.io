Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Meanwhile, Finn helped Monica wash up and then stayed by her side.

Monica was actually a little unhappy as she lay on the bed. Although she was very happy and content to have two babies, when she thought about how she would be living like a cow without an image for a long time, she felt a little hopeless.

“Finn,” Monica called out to him.

She just wanted to complain to him about how difficult it was being a woman. However, he did not respond to her calling him. As such, she turned her head to see that Finn had fallen asleep on the bed. His hand was still holding hers tightly, but at that moment, he was already snoring softly.

In her memory, Finn never snored. Did that mean he was very tired( Moreover, Monica felt that Finn had fallen asleep in just two seconds. After thinking it through carefully, she realized that Finn had been busy since she gave birth to the babies.

He was afraid that she would be ignored, so he tried to stay by her side. He was also afraid that her parents would be too tired, so he always told them to go home first. Then, at night, he would help the nanny to take care of the baby.

The thought of it all warmed her heart. Her getting oversensitive just now, thinking that women were just tools for feeding and all, was just her whining. It was true that when it came to giving birth, a woman’s body would suffer a lot, but a man who loved her could completely make up for everything her body suffered.

With that, she could not help but step forward and kiss Finn’s cheek. It was very soft as she was afraid of waking him up. However, Finn was probably really sleepy because he was not awakened by Monica at all and was sleeping very soundly.

Monica shifted her body so that Finn’s head could rest on her shoulder. She wanted to become Finn’s support for a second.

A few days later, Monica was allowed to go home to recover, and Gary and Ruby moved in. The others, however, spent less time there unless Monica was bored and forced Jeanne to spend some time with her. Since Nox had also been busy with work for the past few days, he rarely went over.

By the time he stretched, it was 9 p.m. at night. The bankruptcy of the Sullivan Group had proved to be a troublesome issue for him because the Al technology products that were supposed to go international could only be handled by him, and just thinking about tired him out. Hence, he picked up his coat and got off work.

Sitting in the car, he stared blankly at the night scene outside the window. He had been working overtime until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. for the past few days, yet Shelly had not asked him about it, and he did not know how to feel about that.

“Mr. Winter, are you having dinner at the same place?” the driver asked respectfully.

“Yes.” Nox nodded.

The driver quickly parked the car by the roadside. “Mr. Winter, we’re here.” “Alright,” Nox said before he walked into the restaurant.

It was not an expensive restaurant, but the food was good. He found it randomly one night when he was hungry and thought he could make do with a meal. However, the taste exceeded his expectations in the end, and he had been coming back almost every night.

The boss recognized Nox. “Is it the same as yesterday?” “Yes.” Nox nodded.

With that, the boss turned around to make his order. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The owner was the only one operating the restaurant, and the dishes he made were all ordinary home-cooked dishes. Considering not many visited the restaurant, he probably did not earn much, and it might be just a hobby of his.

Nox waited for a while before the dishes were served on the table. The boss would not disturb the customers’ meals, so after the dishes were served, he would go back and clean up the kitchen, which was an open kitchen.

Nox suddenly felt a little down today, probably because he was too tired. Hence, he said to the boss, “Do you have wine?”

“I brew my own orange wine.”

“I’ll have a glass,” Nox said bluntly.

“Coming right up.” The boss agreed.

Soon, he handed Nox a glass of wine.

“Will you have a drink with me?” Nox asked. The boss thought for a moment before saying, “Okay.”

Then, he sat opposite Nox.

“I usually see you alone. Are you not married yet?” The boss changed the topic

“Don’t you recognize me?” Nox looked at the boss. The boss sized him up and shook his head. “Are you a celebrity?”

Nox smiled. “It’s fine if you don’t know me.”

The boss also smiled in agreement.

Nox took a sip of wine and sighed. “If I’m married, do you think I can visit you every day?”

“You don’t look too bad. Have you not had enough fun yet and refuse to settle down?”

“The person I like doesn’t feel the same about me.”

“It’s hard to imagine how high the requirements of a girl who doesn’t feel the same about you must be.” The boss shook his head..
