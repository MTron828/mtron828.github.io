1158 Edward, I’m Pregnant

When the speech ended, the applause inside and outside the venue was endless.

No matter the content, the fact that the Sanders could respond to the public’s doubts so quickly was enough to move everyone. After all, this meant that the Sanders valued the people. It was because of this that the response was so positive and serious as well.

At 4 p.m., the high-level prison became a place where reporters would fight to get interviews. Initially, such a place was never open to the public. Now that it was released, countless reporters were present at the scene.

They thought that they would see the entire Swans. However, only Fourth Master Swan came forth, and he seemed to be accompanied by... Jeanne.

It was no matter. With the two in the same frame, the news value was already far greater than everyone else in the Swans. The reporters were so excited, clambering over each other to get a picture of the two.

Even the mention of Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne’s names would spiral to become the hottest news of the day. Now that they had seen the two together and in person, as a media outlet, how could they let go of such a great opportunity?

“Fourth Master Swan, do you have anything to clarify about your illegal trade with other countries?” A reporter asked loudly.

“Fourth Master Swan, do you have anything to say about the Sanders’ imprisonment of you? Are you very dissatisfied with the Sanders’ actions?”

“Fourth Master Swan, I heard there’s been a rift in your relationship with Jeanne. May I know if the rumors are true?”

“Fourth Master Swan...”

The scene was chaotic, and there was a lot of noise.

Edward and Jeanne walked closer, causing the reporters to become even more restless.

“Everyone, be quiet,” Jeanne suddenly said. “We’ll try our best to answer your questions. However, if everyone keeps talking at the same time, Edward and I will not know who to answer.”

With one sentence, all the reporters at the scene became quiet.

Jeanne said, “You may start asking questions now. One by one.”

“Fourth Master Swan...” Three reporters spoke at once.

They exchanged a final glance with one another.

One of the reporters asked, “Fourth Master Swan, is it true that you’ve been doing illegal business with other countries?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No,” Edward said bluntly.

“Do you have any objections to the Sanders’ imprisonment of you?”

“No,” Edward replied. “From the Sanders’ point of view, they have the obligation to investigate all the facts related to the crime. The report of the Swan Group directly harms the country’s economy and the interests of the people. I understand why the Sanders would choose such a method.”

“So you accept your imprisonment by the Sanders?”

Edward nodded.

“Did you put in a good word for the Sanders because of Jeanne?” A reporter asked sharply.

“Public versus public, private versus private. These are the basic principles of life. If it’s really related to Jeanne, based on my relationship with her, the Sanders wouldn’t have imprisoned me. The fact that the Sanders captured me without mercy after finding out about the situation shows that the Sanders are truly selfless.”

At that moment, Jeanne could not help but glance at Edward.

In terms of acting, Edward was not weak. He had defended the Sanders thoroughly.

“Fourth Master, let me ask you a personal question.” Another reporter suddenly requested.

It seemed there was not much left to be dug out in the matter of imprisonment. For the news media, a settlement had no news value.

“It’s rumored that your relationship with Jeanne has become tense due to her sudden identity as the princess of the Sanders. There are also rumors that you’re going through divorce procedures. Is this true?”

“No.” Edward did not answer, but Jeanne did.

The reporters focused all their attention on Jeanne.

“My marriage to Edward has nothing to do with my identity. Whether I am the daughter of the Lawrence or the Sanders, I am still me! Our relationship won’t break just because of our so-called different identities. We’re doing well and have plans to give George a sister.” Jeanne smiled sweetly as she said this.

The reporters were excited again and hurriedly asked, “Does this mean that you and Fourth Master are preparing to have a second child?”

Edward seemed to have turned to look at Jeanne too.

“Yes, and...” Jeanne hesitated.

At that moment, it was as if she had let it slip.

The reporter exclaimed. “Third Miss, are you pregnant?!”
