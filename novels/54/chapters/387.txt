Chapter 388: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

As someone hugged her tightly, Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

It was Michael.

As if he was afraid of losing her, Michael hugged her tightly and held her in his arms, unwilling to let go.

Miles was never a talkative or gossipy person. His ethics as a professional killer had never allowed him to care about other people’s personal feelings.

Hence, he turned around and distanced himself from them.

“Monica, how are you? Are you okay?” Michael asked her emotionally.

While hugging her, he was so nervous that his body was trembling.

Monica did not answer, nor did she leave. Right now, she was not in the mood to deal with anyone.

All she wanted was to see Finn, and no one was important anymore, including Michael.

“The police found me to tell me that Finn got into an accident and that you might be in the car after some investigation, so I’ve been looking for you the entire time. It wasn’t until just now that someone informed me you were in the hospital. Monica, you really scared me to death. You really did. If anything happened to you...” Michael hugged her even tighter.

It was as if he was afraid of losing her.

Monica pursed her lips and said, “Michael, let go of me.”

Michael’s body tensed up.

......

Monica’s attitude toward him was cold, and he could feel it just from those words.

In fact, he had already mentally prepared himself when he came here.

Since Finn was willing to do anything for Monica, there was no way Monica would not be touched. Moreover, Monica clearly had feelings for Finn.

He gritted his teeth secretly.

He would never let Monica and Finn reconcile just like that.

However, at that moment, he still let go of Monica.

Worry was written all over his face. “Are you scared? It’s alright. I’ll always be with you. From now on, I’ll always be with you to protect you–”

“Michael,” Monica called out to him, interrupting his sentence.

She said, “I’m sorry. I think the person I love is still Fi–”

Just then, the door to the emergency room suddenly opened.

Monica’s words just disappeared from her mouth.

In a daze, she looked at the tired-looking doctor walking out of the operating theater.

She had been waiting and wishing for the door to the operating theater to open as soon as possible. However, the moment the door opened, she shrank back, not daring to go forward.

She was afraid — afraid that she would receive bad news.

Suddenly, she did not want the surgery to end. If it kept going, it meant there was still hope for Finn. If it ended…

If it ended, there would only be two outcomes.

Her entire body was trembling, and her eyes were frighteningly red.

Michael watched Monica’s mood change coldly, at how all her attention was focused on Finn.

He really should have killed Finn earlier.

He looked at the doctor in front of him without batting an eyelid.

The doctor said to Monica, “Dr. Jones’s injuries are very serious, with many fractures all over his body. Because he had lost too much blood, he fell into a coma during the resuscitation process. We have already treated all of his injuries, but it’s difficult to guarantee that Dr. Jones will wake up. In his condition, there are signs of a vegetative state...”

No. Impossible!

How could Finn be in a vegetative state? Although he did not like to talk, he could infuriate her when he did. How could he become a vegetable who could not speak or move?

Her tears streamed down her face, but she did not cry out loud.

It was as if she didn’t know that she was crying. Her tears kept falling.

“Mrs. Jones, don’t be too sad. I’m just saying there are signs of this, but it doesn’t mean it’s true. We will now send Dr. Jones to the intensive care unit and give him some time to wake up. If he wakes up tonight, that’ll be great. But if he doesn’t, we will do more remedial measures for him. Mrs. Jones, don’t worry.”

Don’t worry? How could she not worry? Finn could not even open his eyes.

She looked at Finn, who had come out of the emergency room with tubes all over his body and was being pushed away by the medical staff. His face was pale and weak.

Then, she stood up from the chair. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, just as she stood up, she suddenly sat down again, probably because she had been sitting in one position for too long.

Michael quickly reached out a hand to support Monica.
