It was indeed impossible for her to get Zoe’s phone number. That was why it served her right that Nox misunderstood her and thought she had Zoe’s phone number to threaten Zoe.

“Has the market been bad recently?” Nox sneered.

Shelly was confused.

“I said, is the escort market not doing well? Is that why you’re planning to do something else?”

“I’ll delete it now,” Shelly said bluntly.

She was powerless to defend herself, so she should just delete it.

“Of course, you have to delete it. How can someone like you have the right to have Zoe’s phone number?”

As Nox spoke, he deleted it from her phone.

Shelly said, “Is that enough?”

Nox looked at Shelly coldly.

“If it is, give me back my phone.” Shelly reached out her hand.

Nox’s expression was grim, but in the end, he threw the phone to Shelly.

Shelly did not manage to catch it, and the phone fell to the ground. She then squatted down and picked it up.

Although she had used it for a long time, she did not have the money to get a new one. After checking that it was not broken, she was ready to leave with her phone.

“Shelly, do you know why I don’t like you?” Nox asked coldly.

“Because I’m ugly and I don’t know my place.”

Nox was stunned, but the next moment, he sneered. “I didn’t expect you to know. ”

Shelly said, “Now that I know my place, can I leave now, Young Master

Winter?”

Shelly was suddenly very respectful.

“Do you know that not only are you ugly, but you’re also disobedient? You’re nothing like what they say a woman should be. You’re not gentle, considerate, or kind.”

Shelly looked at Nox. Therefore, all the good she had done for him in the past was useless.

“You’re completely different from Zoe.” Nox enunciated each word clearly.

The moment he said it, he did not feel the slightest pleasure in insulting Shelly. How could Shelly be compared to Zoe?

With a gloomy expression, he looked at Shelly, who smiled and said, “You seem very satisfied with your current fiancée.”

“Otherwise, who do you think I’ve wised up for?” Nox said coldly, “I didn’t expect to be defiled by you today!”

“I didn’t defile you. We didn’t do it,” Shelly said bluntly.

Nox was shocked.

Logically speaking, should Shelly not be saying that she had done it with him so that she could benefit from him?

“That’s true.” Shelly looked at Nox. “Since you like Zoe so much, you should treat her well. Don’t… lose her.”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Do you think Zoe is you? She loves me and will never leave me! She’s completely different from you. Plastic surgery, an escort… How could you do such disgusting things?”

Shelly looked at Nox and really wanted to laugh but agitate Nox.

She wondered if Nox found out that his beloved Zoe had done both of those things, how angry would he be? Hopefully, he would never find out for the rest of his life.

“Get lost!” Nox suddenly roared.

He seemed to have reached the limit of his patience with her. With that, she opened the door and was about to walk out when she saw Zoe return.

Seeing Shelly frown and Nox behind Shelly, Zoe was frightened because she had a guilty conscience.

Shelly bowed respectfully to Zoe without showing any emotion. That was how a waitress was supposed to show respect for the guests.

Zoe did not even look at Shelly as she quickly walked to Nox. “You’re awake. I was just out to buy some hangover pills for you, but I couldn’t find any pharmacy nearby. It hurt me to see you suffer.”

Shelly stood at the door. As she was in charge of the service of that private room, she could not leave, so heard Zoe’s delicate voice, which was full of worry.

No wonder Nox thought Zoe was gentle and kind. She was really very kind.

“It’s nothing. Let’s go.” Nox held Zoe’s hand and walked past Shelly coldly.

Shelly watched them leave, with Zoe leaning her body against Nox and Nox hugging her tightly. The two of them looked very intimate.

Shelly smiled coldly and swore that she would never interfere with anything related to Nox again.

Since God made Nox fall in love with Zoe, perhaps it was God’s punishment for him.. Why should she go against God’s arrangements?
