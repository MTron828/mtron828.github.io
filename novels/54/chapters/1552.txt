Chapter 1553: Monica Gives In to Finn (They Make Up)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It suddenly struck Brandon that Monica did not want a doctor to come along because she knew Finn would come along. Was she looking for Finn when she turned around after entering the security check?

F*ck. Why did that make him feel so upset?

The plane was flying in the sky, and Monica did not know how long she had slept. Anyway, she was still on the plane when she woke up.

She moved her body, feeling a little uncomfortable. However, the moment she moved, she felt that something was wrong with her sleeping position. How could she fall asleep in Brandon’s arms? Moreover, she had slept very well.

Just as she was about to resist, she suddenly saw Brandon sitting at the side and he was asleep. Therefore, who was the person hugging her?

She looked up and saw Finn, who seemed to be sound asleep at the moment. He did not wake up because he was awake.

No matter what, seeing him still make her heart skip a beat. She had indeed thought that Finn would come along, but she did not see him when she boarded the plane, so she thought he would not come. Yet, he was here.

She gently broke free from Finn’s embrace and sat down on her seat. Finn did not seem to have woken up or noticed that she had left.

Monica pressed the service bell, and the air stewardess hurried forward. “Miss, is there anything I can do for you?”

“Get me a blanket.”

“Yes, Miss.”

The air stewardess brought a blanket for Monica, and Monica immediately covered Finn with a blanket. Then, she told the stewardess to bring her some food.

Recently, not only had she been feeling sleepier than usual, but she also got hungry easily. As she was too hungry, she did not notice that the man who was sleeping with his eyes closed had a beautiful smile on his face.

The plane flew for over seven hours before landing at Casterbridge Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

International Airport. By then, Finn, Monica, and Brandon were all awake.

From the moment Finn woke up, Monica did not ask why Finn was on the plane. It was as if they had both tacitly agreed to travel together.

After getting off the plane, the hotel arranged a private car to pick them up. The three of them sat together in the car, and soon, they arrived at the best five-star hotel in the area.

Finn glanced at Monica, who said to the receptionist, “Alone.”

“Alright.” The receptionist quickly agreed, “Our presidential suite is full at the moment, so there are no more rooms in the luxury private rooms. The only room left is the business suite. Is Mr. Finn okay with that?”

“Alright,” Finn replied.

He also did not dare to push his luck with Monica.

“I’ll arrange that for you. Your room is on the 8th floor, and Ms. Monica and Mr. Brandon’s room is on the 26th floor,” the receptionist said.

“Are the rooms that far away from each other?” Finn seemed to mind the distance.

“Yes, it is. Because the room’s specifications are different, the floor would be different,” the receptionist explained.

“Can you try to change it to one on a similar floor?”

“I’m sorry, sir. There’s really nothing else. We only have rooms below the eighth floor. All the rooms above are full.” The receptionist said apologetically, “It happens to be the peak tourist season here, so the rooms are in short supply.’

Finn had no choice but to agree.

Brandon, however, said, “Why don’t I switch rooms with you?”

Finn was a little surprised as he did not expect Brandon would come to matchmake him and Monica. Brandon’s love for Monica was definitely not an act.

“You’re a doctor, so you can sleep next door to Monica. It’ll be easier for you to take care of her. Anyway, we’ll just be staying for a few days. I don’t mind the business suite.”

“No need.” Monica suddenly interrupted, “Finn can share a room with me.” Finn was utterly shocked, and so was Brandon.

Brandon only offered Finn his room for Monica’s safety. If anything happened, Finn would immediately appear by Monica’s side. He definitely was not doing that to let them sleep in the same room. He was not that kind! However, there was no way to take back what he had done now!

Of course, Finn agreed immediately. He said to the receptionist, “In that case, I don’t want the business suite. Please put Monica and me in the same room..”
