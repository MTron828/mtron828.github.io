Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly thought to herself silently and heard Nox ask her coldly, ‘Where do you live?!”

Shelly told him the address. She had tacitly agreed that Nox would send her back.

After Nox heard the address, he mocked her again. “Shelly, you’re really not a simple person. You must’ve been with a lot of men to be able to afford a house there.”

It was indeed a wealthy district because it was Sarah’s apartment. However, Shelly kept quiet.

“Did a man give it to you?” Nox asked.

Shelly still did not answer.

“You have the guts to do it but not admit it, huh?”

“Nox, don’t you think you seem jealous?” Shelly retorted.

Nox almost choked out of anger. What did she say? He was jealous?

“Stop the car!” Nox suddenly shouted at the driver.

Shocked, the driver quickly parked the car by the side of the road.

It was the same just now. He had just passed the traffic light when Young Master Winter ordered him to turn around immediately. Young Master Winter’s face was so grim that he did not even dare to breathe.

The moment the car stopped, Nox said coldly, “Get lost.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shelly pursed her lips. She did not mean that Nox was jealous. All she wanted was to shut him up, but she did not expect to provoke him again.

“Get down!” Nox’s voice was loud, and his disgust toward Shelly was obvious.

Shelly took a deep breath before she opened the car door and got out.

Outside the car, it was still raining cats and dogs, so Shelly was instantly drenched when she got out. At that moment, she felt like she had brought it upon herself.

As soon as she got out of the car, the black car in front of her dashed off, and the water splashed all over her.

In that situation, Shelly naturally would not wait for the bus anymore. Hence, she stood in the rain and finally managed to hail a taxi.

Unbeknownst to her, as soon as she left, the black car drove back. However, Shelly was already gone by then, and Nox’s expression was extremely ugly.

The driver felt that he was innocent. He had lost count of how many times Young Master Winter had yelled at him that night. Anyone with a weaker heart would be scared to death by his anger!

Shelly caught a cold and had a fever.

When she returned home last night, she took a hot shower and took cold medicine in time. However, she was still sick when she woke up early in the morning.

Her body felt weak, and her head felt light. Therefore, she called her part-time job early in the morning to call in sick. Then, at 8 a.m. in the morning, she got up with Bella and sent her to kindergarten.

She finally realized that the poor had no time to be sick because even though she was sick, she had to do what she had to do.

She looked a little weak with her face red and her lips pale.

Even the little Bella had noticed it. She said, “Mom, are you sick?”

“No, I just don’t feel well, but I’ll be fine in a while.”

“Muah.” Bella suddenly planted a kiss on her burning forehead.

Shelly was stunned.

“That’s what you always do to me when I’m not feeling well.”

Shelly smiled and stroked Bella’s hair.

Back then, she had chosen to keep Bella. Although she did regret it later since she would have lived a better life without Bella, she was glad that she had decided to keep Bella now.

Otherwise, how could she experience the joy and happiness brought by such a cute creature like her daughter?

Shelly quickly washed up with Bella.

When she walked out of the room, Sarah had also just gotten up. “Sigh. I will never drink so much again. The hangover is terrible.”

“Don’t you have to go to work today?” Shelly asked Sarah as she went to the kitchen to make breakfast.

“I’ve called in sick.”

“In that case, sleep a little longer.” “My head hurts.”

“I’ll make some breakfast for you.” “Thank you. I knew you loved me the most.”

Shelly smiled faintly.

She quickly made breakfast for Bella, who obediently ate by herself. Even though she was not even three years old, she Imew how to take care of herself.

While Shelly was making breakfast for Sarah in the open kitchen, she said, “Sarah, I’ve quit my job at the nightclub.”

“You’ve finally thought it through.”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded. “I think the hours are too long, and it’s not for me.” “It is. Now that Bella is a little older, she will need you to be around more.”

‘Yes.”

“Shelly, how much more do we need for Bella’s medical fees?” Sarah asked.

In fact, she had asked that question several times..
