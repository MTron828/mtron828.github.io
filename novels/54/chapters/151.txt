Chapter 152: A Dangerous Accident

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne drove to the South Hampton City International Airport.

When she looked at the airport, she thought that she would also pass through this passage soon and leave the city.

Then, she would not come back.

She parked the car in the airport garage and walked into the airport lobby when the plane just landed.

She waited for about twenty minutes.

Jeanne saw Klaus walk out.

Jeanne took the initiative to go forward.

Klaus, who was over 60 years old, was very enthusiastic. He gave Jeanne a hug and asked, “Where’s my George?”

“He’s sleeping.”

“He’s still such a bedhead.” Klaus’ tone was filled with affection.

Jeanne smiled and took the luggage from Klaus. “I’ll send you to the hotel first.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne brought Klaus into her car.

The car drove out of the airport and took the inner ring expressway.

“It must be hard for you to come all the way to South Hampton City personally this time,” Jeanne said politely as she drove.

“The matters of my disciple are my matters. Moreover, this time, I can train George. He’s too lazy. I plan to let George complete the traffic planning and design of South Hampton City.”

Jeanne could already imagine George’s bitter little face.

The two of them chatted very casually.

Jeanne’s eyes suddenly paused.

Through the rearview mirror, she saw a somewhat strange car.

If she remembered correctly, this car had been following her since she came to the airport.

She could understand that they might be going in the same direction towards the airport, but would it be possible for them to pick people up from the same plane as well? How could the time when they left the airport be so coincidental?

She pursed her lips and did not show it.

Klaus had been lightheartedly chatting with Jeanne and did not notice anything strange.

Jeanne responded to Klaus while also being vigilant.

She observed the surrounding environment.

This was the inner circle of the airport, and there was no crowd. If an accident happened in this kind of place... it should be relatively easier to handle.

As she thought about this, Jeanne stepped on the accelerator and the car behind her also sped up.

It was not an illusion, after all.

Her pupils constricted, and in the next second, she calmly checked the condition of her car. If the car had not been tampered with, it would not be difficult to shake off the people behind her.

Klaus also seemed to have noticed that something was not right. He looked at Jeanne, “What’s wrong?”

“We’re being followed. Don’t worry, I’ll send you to your destination safely and guarantee your safety in Harken.”

“Okay.” Klaus nodded.

An international celebrity like him had probably experienced a lot, so such a situation would not fluster him.

After Jeanne confirmed that there was no problem with her car, she said to Klaus, “Hold on to the handrail, I’m going to speed up.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne gripped the steering wheel tightly and focused. She stepped on the accelerator and pressed it to the bottom.

The car sped up at lightning speed.

In almost an instant, it threw the car behind it a distance away.

When the car behind reacted, it quickly chased after it.

The speed was very fast.

The two cars were on the inner ring highway, racing crazily.

The car behind them had chased for some distance and was starting to become more and more laborious. He hurriedly got the person in the passenger seat to make a call.

The person in the passenger seat dialed. “Mr. Swan, we might not be able to catch up.”

Eden’s expression turned cold. “What do you mean?”

“You asked us to follow Jeanne, but it seems like she discovered us.”

“If she has discovered you, then so be it. Just follow her closely and let me know her route.”

“The truth is, I can’t keep up. She’s too fast. If I continue to follow her, I’m afraid I’ll get into an accident.”

“Aren’t you a race car driver?”

“We have a special race track...”

“Trash!” Eden said fiercely.

He hung up the phone and quickly called Micheal. “My people might have lost Jeanne.”

Micheal’s expression did not change. “Why?”

“They said that Jeanne is driving too fast!”

Micheal frowned.

Eden was a little anxious. “Now is not the time to investigate the truth. The main point is that if my people did not follow Jeanne, we would not be able to control her route and would not be able to cause any traffic accidents!”

“Alright, I’ll think of a way. Prepare your men.”

“Alright.”

Eden hung up the phone. At that moment, he was completely furious.

At the same time.

Jeanne looked at the car that she had thrown a distance away. She picked up the phone and dialed. “Miles.”

“Yes.”

“I’m sending you my real-time location now. Come and help me. I’m being targeted.”

“Alright.” There was no doubt from the other side.

They were used to this.

Jeanne hung up the phone and sped up again.

The car behind them was getting further and further away, but she did not dare to let her guard down.

It was impossible for the other party to arrange for just a single car to follow her. There might be a sudden accident in the surrounding area.

About ten minutes passed.

Jeanne received a clear phone call. “Turn at the next road exit nearest to you. I will wait for you there.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne looked at the road sign and continued to drive wildly.

She drifted and directly went down the next exit.

At this moment, the car behind her could no longer be seen. Naturally, her followers did not know that she had already made an exit.

She quickly parked the car at the entrance of the path and said to Miles who was parked there, “Help me bring Mr. Klaus to your place first. After I send these people away, I will come and meet up with you guys.”

“Okay.” Miles nodded.

Jeanne turned to face Klaus, “My friend will guarantee your safety. You follow him and leave first. I will come and find you after I’m done.”

“Pay attention to your safety.” Klaus reminded her as he got out of the car.

“I know.”

Jeanne watched as Klaus got into Miles’s car before she started the car again and left quickly.

Then, she returned to the inner ring highway. After some time, the car behind her finally caught up.

The person in the front passenger seat immediately reported, “Jeanne is still on the inner ring highway.”

“Do everything you can to follow closely!”

“Yes.”

Jeanne slowed down slightly.

Her goal was to let the other party catch up to her so Miles could bring Klaus to a safe place.

She followed the original route and prepared to exit the inner ring highway.

The moment she entered the intersection and returned to the city streets, a large truck suddenly went in the opposite direction. It was obviously heading straight for her.

She had no way to think. She abruptly spun the steering wheel and directly hit the guardrail beside her.

Jeanne’s body was tightly bound by the seat belt and her head hit the car window beside her. The car window instantly shattered and her head felt dizzy.

She gritted her teeth, turned to reverse gear and quickly stepped on the accelerator. Her car left her position.

It was almost the next second.

The big truck directly hit the spot where Jeanne’s car had collided. If it had been a second later, she might have been crushed into a pancake.

She did not have time to even tremble. She turned her steering wheel and left quickly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At the same time.

Eden received a call, and the other party reported, “We failed. Now Jeanne has directly driven away, but she should be slightly injured.”

“Useless!” He hung up the phone fiercely.

The next moment, he sent the message to Micheal.

Jeanne was still in a frenzy on the street.

After driving for a long distance, she discovered the danger around her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

How many people did Eden use?

Or could it be Melody Sanders who really wanted to exterminate her?

Her eyes turned cold, and the phone suddenly rang.

She took a glance at the incoming call and pressed the Bluetooth button.

“Ms.Lawrence, head towards East Street.”

Jeanne was stunned.

“I’ll pick you up here.”

She did not know if she should trust the Fourth Master Swan at this moment.
