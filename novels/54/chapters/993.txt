994 Glib-Tongued, Monica’s Imposing Presence

“Monica, please mind your words,” Daniel said in a dignified manner.

“Director Cook, since you’re afraid that I’ll frame you, why don’t you prove your innocence in front of everyone?” Monica deliberately provoked him.

Daniel did not answer. Monica was really forcing him to make a decision.

The reporters at the scene started to jeer, “Since Monica is so sure, I think we should give the Cardellini Enterprise a chance.”

“But what if there’s a problem with the vaccine and something happens to the child?” Someone objected.

“If there’s really a problem, Monica wouldn’t dare to bet on her godson.”

“Who knows if Monica bribed a child?”

“Monica’s godson is Fourth Master Swan’s biological son. Do you think you can bribe him?!”

The scene suddenly fell silent because they could not find more reason to question Monica Since Monica could suggest that, she must have full confidence.

If they slandered her now, they would just be creating rumors.

Therefore, after all the commotion, everyone waited quietly for the situation to develop.

Monica said bluntly to Daniel, “Director Cook, please take out a vaccine from Cardellini Pharmaceutical that has been stored in the quality inspection department.”

Daniel looked at her.

“For the sake of fairness, I’ll get someone to follow your staff to get it. We’ll film the entire process and broadcast it live to the public. This is to prevent any accidents from happening midway, and no one can be sure.” Monica was obviously implying something.

Daniel was forced into a corner by Monica.

His eyes flickered as he looked at one of the staff members below the stage.

That staff member was naturally Michael’s man, and with such a big thing happening, he needed Michael’s instructions.

Meanwhile, Michael was holding his phone and watching the live broadcast in front of him. His expression was extremely ugly.

‘Monica!’

When did Monica become so smart?!

He could not believe that she found so much evidence and even knew to do an autopsy. Did they not say that the body was already cremated? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At that moment, Michael knew that he had fallen into Monica’s trap.

His expression was cold as he ordered into the phone, “Let her get the vaccine!”

Then, he hung up the phone.

He could not conceal his anger.

However, if they did not agree with Monica, it would be obvious that the quality inspection department was deliberately causing trouble. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, it was proof that they were fabricating the truth.

At the press conference, after receiving the instructions, Daniel said, “Since you’re so insistent, I won’t say anything else. However, if anything really happens, you’ll have to bear all the responsibility!”

“Don’t worry. If anything happens to my godson because of this, I’ll pay with my life. I won’t implicate any of you!” Monica enunciated each word in a very domineering manner!

Everyone at the scene was still a little shocked by Monica.

They had never expected Monica would have such a mature and magnanimous side to her one day!

Daniel told the staff to retrieve the vaccine.

The person following the staff was Mason, who had changed into a human skin mask. He filmed the entire process, from leaving the press conference to going to the destination to get the vaccine. The entire process was broadcast live on the Internet, and everyone was waiting quietly. At that moment, there was not even a comment that popped up on the live stream. Everyone held their breath, clearly a little nervous.

Half an hour later, the vaccine was brought to the scene.

At the same time, George also arrived at the press conference.

Everyone was a little surprised when they saw George.

Everyone knew that George was Monica’s godson, but when George really showed up, they still found it unbelievable.

It was common knowledge that George was Fourth Master Swan’s son, but now Monica wanted him to do the experiment!

If there really was no problem with the vaccine, would Monica have dared to do this?

Even before the vaccination had begun, at least half of the people had already believed that the vaccine was fine. The vaccination was just to increase that trust.

At the scene, a nurse in uniform walked up to the podium and showed her identification. She was a vaccination nurse from the vaccine center affiliated with the municipal People’s Hospital.

She followed the procedure and vaccinated George.

As it hurt a little, George frowned.

Monica’s heart ached for him as well.

Fortunately, the vaccination process was very fast.

After the vaccination, the venue was still quiet. Everyone waited quietly for George’s reaction to the vaccine.
