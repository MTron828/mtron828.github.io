Chapter 523: Monica Swayed By Her Emotions

She always believed that time could heal everything.

She loved Finn so much back then, but in the end, she still let it go.

She looked at Reese and went over to help her up. “Auntie, don’t worry. Michael will be fine.”

Reese took a glance at Monica and sat down on a chair beside her with Monica’s help.

At that moment, the corridor was quiet other than Reese’s incessant crying.

Monica stayed with her for quite some time until Reese calmed down a little and said, “Monica, thank you.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Monica’s heart ached for the family that was suddenly hit with the worst.

Since Reese came to look for her yesterday and told her about Michael’s campaign, she could not help but read some of Michael’s news that night. She just wanted to know how Michael’s campaign was going, and one look was enough to make her feel even more guilty. Michael’s popularity had really hit rock bottom. People were even scolding him under his voting poll, and the number of people doing so was more than those who supported him.

Monica also saw an article on a webpage, which was recommended because she was following Michael’s election. The post was about the Rosses’ current situation and the predicament they were currently facing. It was likely that once Minister Ross fell, the Rosses would immediately collapse! The only person who could keep the Rosses going was Michael. Michael used to be adored by many, but a piece of negative news lately had caused his popularity to drop. However, if Michael could clear his name at the last moment and turn the situation around, there would be a glimmer of hope for the Rosses.

After watching the news, Monica felt conflicted, and seeing Michael like this today made her even more conflicted.

Beside her, Reese said while sobbing, “I heard Michael got into a car accident because he fell asleep on the wheel.”

Monica turned to look at her.

“Michael hasn’t slept since yesterday. In order to support the family, he has been working so hard. On one hand, he has been trying to network with people, hoping to solidify his place in the election; on the other, he has been doing public relations to save his image. After working with no sleep at all, he crashed into a big truck while he was coming back this morning. After that, he was rushed to the hospital. He was supposed to be sent to the emergency room, but he suddenly resisted, telling everyone to stay away from him… He looked like he didn’t want to live anymore...”

Upon saying that, Reese started crying miserably again.

“Michael doesn’t seem like a person who can’t handle setbacks,” Monica hurriedly said.

“I thought he wasn’t as well. Ever since he was young, his father had always been strict with him, raising him to be the best in everything. Michael has also worked hard since he was young and did his best in everything he could. From the moment he was born to his father passing away, everything had been smooth sailing, so I didn’t think so many things to happen to him after his father fell ill. You have no idea how much Michael has to beg those officials who were once inferior to us. He has to endure so much torture in his heart and lose so much of his self-respect. I think...” Reese’s tears kept flowing down her face. “I keep thinking it would be fine if you were with him because he loves you so much. If you were by his side, he might be able to pull himself together again. However, now that he has lost you, I’m afraid he’ll... be crippled.”

Monica bit her lips and did not say a word.

“It’s fine if he’s crippled. As long as Michael doesn’t have suicidal thoughts, at worst, we’ll just give up everything and leave. From then on, the Rosses will cease to exist, and we’ll live a normal life. However, what I’m worried about is that he’ll choose to commit suicide because he can’t take the blow. According to the driver, he and Michael could have avoided each other, but it was Michael who suddenly swerved and crashed into him. If what the driver said is true, Michael’s car accident wasn’t an accident. It was... It was he who chose to end his life!”

At that, Reese broke down again.

Monica was also shocked.

She never thought Michael would go to that extent as she always saw Michael as a person who was very considerate of others.

He would never hurt anyone like that, including her and his parents.

Her eyes were slightly red.

Did she feel like crying because of everything that had happened to Michael, or was it because she felt sad?

Then, Reese suddenly knelt in front of Monica.

Monica looked nervously at Reese, the arrogant woman who was suddenly kneeling and begging her.

“Monica, I know my actions are putting you in a difficult position, but... but there’s nothing I can do about it. I only have one son, and I can’t lose him. I can’t lose Michael. I’m begging you to get back together with my son. Please, I’m begging you. I’ll give you whatever you want in the future. It was all my fault three years ago. I beg you not to punish Michael for his mistake. Michael really loves you...”

Monica’s eyes were red.

She looked at Reese’s heartbroken expression with tears in her eyes.

Just as she was about to speak, a man’s voice suddenly sounded from the corridor.

“Monica.”

Monica turned her head to see Finn standing not far away, looking at her coldly.
