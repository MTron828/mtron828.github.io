Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Look at you, you finally admit that you hate it!” Monica was very hurt. “I worked so hard to carry your child, and you’re fussing over whether I’m carrying a boy or a girl. Finn, how can you do this to me? How can you-” “Damn it!” Finn suddenly stopped the car by the side.

Monica looked at Finn’s angry expression and said, “See, you’re angry.” Finn angrily opened the door to the back seat of the car and sat inside.

“Do you still want to hit me?” Monica looked at Finn, her face filled with grievance.

However, Finn lifted Monica’s chin and gave her a deep kiss.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat. Finn was becoming more proactive, and she actually… liked it. Hence, at that moment, she wrapped her arms around Finn’s neck and kissed him back.

They kissed passionately until… Finn pushed her away. At that moment, Finn’s entire body tensed up, and he felt like he would not be able to hold it soon.

He said in a hoarse voice, “Don’t seduce me.” “You made the first move,” Monica retorted.

“But you forced me.”

“How did I force you?” “You insisted that I hate you for being pregnant with a boy.”

“You just don’t like it.”

“I’ve explained myself. I don’t hate it. I’m just a little disappointed. When it comes to the unknown, people will always have expectations. I didn’t say that I don’t like boys. It’s just that if I had a choice, I would like to have a daughter.” “Hmph, you still want a daughter.” Monica did not accept his explanation.

Finn was about to be pissed off by Monica. Nevertheless, he retorted, “Is it wrong to want a daughter? Am I wrong to want a daughter who looks exactly like you? Why do I want a daughter? It’s because I love you!”

His voice was a little loud, and it was clear that he was exasperated. Upon hearing him, Monica was suddenly in a good mood.

“So you want a daughter because you love me?” Monica smiled brightly. Finn looked a little shy as he said, “Don’t you know?”

“I don’t know,” Monica denied. However, when she saw Finn get angry again, she immediately replied, “But I know now.”

Then, she took the initiative to hug Finn’s neck and kiss him.

She frustrated Finn. Did he not tell her to stop seducing him? Nevertheless, he suppressed the urge so hard and eventually managed to calm himself down to drive back. Only God would know what kind of torture he was going through.

Monica was actually a little… tempted. She looked down at her protruding abdomen and realized that having to be pregnant for nine months was torturous.

As she leaned against the back seat, she stared straight at Finn. She did not know if she had been staring at him too long, but Finn’s red ears looked sexy.

“Monica, don’t look at me!” Finn suddenly said.

Monica jumped in her seat in shock. She was just… looking around casually.

Since Finn did not want her staring at him, she took out her phone, wanting to read some gossip to divert her attention. That was when she suddenly remembered that she wanted to call Nox, so she quickly gave him a call.

“Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? To think you would take the initiative to call me!” Nox’s lazy voice came from the other end.

“Are you pursuing Shelly?” Monica went straight to the point, not wanting to waste any more time with Nox.

“How do you know?”

“Everyone in the country knows now!” Monica rolled her eyes. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Nox paused for a moment before he seemed to remember something. “Oh, I’m on the news.”

“Yeah, you lunatic. Didn’t you say to the media a few days ago that Shelly framed you and made you sleep with her? It’s only been a few days, and you’re saying that you like Shelly. Aren’t you slapping yourself in the face?” Monica cursed.

“Watch what you say.” Finn reminded her,

Monica rolled her eyes.

“I like to slap myself in the face, and it’s none of your business.” Nox was unhappy.

It was because pursuing Shelly was already pretty difficult, yet now, his friend was taking a jab at him, pissing him off!

“Haha.” Monica suddenly snickered.

Nox’s hair stood on end. “Are you sick?”

“You’re the sick one! Tell me honestly, did Shelly reject you?” Monica was certain of Nox’s fate..
