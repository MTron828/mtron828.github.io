Chapter 261: Successfully Saved Jeanne

In the barn, people were lying on the ground.

Blood was flowing all over the ground.

Melody heard the sudden movement and quickly turned her head. The moment she turned her head, she saw Edward walking toward her with a frightening aura.

He was walking over quickly, so fast that Melody’s heart was trembling at that moment.

Melody was terrified by Edward’s murderous intent at the moment.

She was still holding the black pistol in her hand. The pistol was shaking when it was pointed at Edward.

It was shaking non-stop.

“Don’t come over. If you come over, I’ll shoot you!” Melody said fiercely.

She said fiercely.

Her voice was also trembling.

Edward did not seem to hear it.

He walked toward Melody with killing intent. He did not stop for a second.

Once he was close to Melody, two bodyguards quickly stepped forward to block in front of her.

Edward punched one of the bodyguards fiercely. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The bodyguard quickly counterattacked, punching and kicking Edward.

Finn, who was following behind, also quickly joined the battle.

Melody was at the side, and her body could not stop trembling. She just could not control herself.

She did not expect that Edward would suddenly appear.

He appeared just like that.

Did Eden not say that he would be locked up by Old Master Swan and would not be able to leave the house tonight?!

Melody glared fiercely at the man in front of her.

She looked at her two bodyguards, who had the greatest combat powers, and saw that they were beaten to the ground by Edward and Finn in about 2 minutes.

The bodyguards fainted on the ground.

No.

Melody had never seen the true terror of Fourth Master Swan before, so she did not know that he could be so scary.

He walked up to her with violence.

Melody was not afraid!

At worst, they would die together.

She pointed the pistol at Fourth Master Swan’s head. “If you want to die, let’s—ah!”

At that instant—perhaps a second or less…

Finn immediately restrained Melody’s hand and exerted force.

Melody’s pistol fell to the ground just like that.

She watched helplessly as her weapon, the only weapon that could protect her, fell to the ground.

Her face was full of fear.

Melody looked fearfully at the man who seemed to have walked out of hell.

She could feel the cold air emanating from his body. She even felt that she would be killed by him.

However, Edward’s gaze was not on her at all.

He only squatted down.

Edward slowly squatted down in front of Jeanne.

He looked at Jeanne and saw how she was covered in blood.

Her injuries were severe.

Edward did not even dare to reach out his hands. He did not dare to hug Jeanne properly.

He was afraid that he would hurt her wounds.

Her body was covered in wounds.

He said in a low and hoarse voice, “I’m sorry I’m late.”

‘I’m sorry I’m late.

‘I came late and had to see you covered in blood.’

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan.

For the first time, she seemed to see the pain in his eyes.

It was so obvious, and he did not hide it at all.

She pursed her lips.

For a second, she could not speak.

Even so, she forced herself to smile.

It was not too late.

As long as she was not dead, it was not too late.

The gunshot just now was not aimed at her.

Melody had not thought of letting Jeanne die. She had not tortured her enough. At least, Jeanne had not been trampled on, so Melody did not kill her. Instead, Melody fired a shot above her head just to warn Jeanne.

It was just to warn Jeanne.

Jeanne had only fallen because she was kicked over by Melody’s bodyguard.

That kick almost took her life.

When she fell, she saw Fourth Master Swan.

She saw Fourth Master Swan suddenly appear.

Jeanne knew she would not die.

She had waited for an entire night.

Finally, it was time.

The process was not important.

It was really not important…

There was silence between Edward and Jeanne.

The two of them were silent.

In the barn, Monica’s voice was suddenly heard. “Jeanne...”

It was a voice that was almost filled with despair.

At that moment, Monica was truly afraid. Before she could see Jeanne, she screamed out in a heart-wrenching manner.

Jeanne looked toward the entrance.

Her vision was blurry.

It was not from tears.

It was because her body was too tired and that blood had flown into her eyes.

In a daze, Jeanne saw Monica in a sorry state. Monica looked like she could not even walk steadily as she ran toward her.
