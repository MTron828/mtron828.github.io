Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Michael.” Monica interrupted Michael and suddenly asked, “What exactly did you say to Finn that he would hit you?”

Michael tightened his grip on his phone.

What was up with Monica today?

“Based on my understanding of Finn, he wouldn’t be so impulsive.”

“It’s probably because he couldn’t accept that you temporarily gave up on him for me, so he wanted to vent his anger.” Michael came up with a reason.

Monica actually did not believe it.

Michael added, “Another reason might be...”

Monica listened attentively.

“He wanted to use this to sever any ties with you.”

Monica bit her lip, and that she believed.

Finn knew she would be angry if he hit Michael, but he did not care and continued to beat Michael up.

She even felt that Finn was doing it on purpose for her to see.

“Monica, I’m sorry. I–” Michael was about to apologize again.

“It’s fine.” Monica took a deep breath. “Take down the news from the trending list first. I’ll explain things to Finn about it in the future.”

“Alright, I’ll deal with the news then.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

After hanging up the phone, Monica was still lying on the big bed.

Just now, she had only glanced at the news content a few times but had not read through it in detail. If she did, she would be exasperated. Yet now, she opened the news again, only to see the contents slandering Finn, and people were criticizing him in the comments section.

She wanted to smash her phone. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Finn was not as bad as they said!

Hence, she gritted her teeth and called Finn.

She knew he would not pick up, but she really wanted to call him. However, she did not know what to say to him because Finn always refused to listen to her.

Perhaps she was just looking for an excuse so that she would feel less guilty. At least, she wanted to make up for it, even though Finn would not accept it.

With that thought in mind, she listened to the beep sound of the call trying to connect, knowing that Finn would not pick up her call.

Just as she was about to hang up, the call was suddenly connected.

Then, Finn’s familiar male voice came through. “Monica.”

Monica’s heart started to race. It was as if her entire heart was about to jump out of her chest.

She did not expect Finn to pick up her call, especially after such a massive incident.

She said emotionally, “Finn, don’t worry about the news today. I’ve already asked Michael to handle it. It will disappear soon.”

“I don’t care,” Finn said bluntly.

“The media shouldn’t slander you like this. You’re not that–”

“I saw this coming after you and Michael got together,” Finn said indifferently.

Monica was stunned.

“I don’t care about the expected things.” Finn repeated, “And I only took your call to tell you that no matter what happens, please don’t come near me again! This is the last time I’ll tell you calmly. Next time...”

Next time? What would happen next time?

Monica’s hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

“Next time, I’ll kill you.” After that, Finn hung up the phone abruptly.

Monica’s entire body stiffened.

What did Finn just say?

He said that if she came near him again, he would kill her!

Did Finn hate her so much already? So much that he wanted her to die?

She bit her lips, and her tears fell again.

Could she still return to Finn’s side after she helped Michael?

…

Finn hung up the phone and drove away, leaving the hospital.

What he said to Monica just now was not a threat.

He did not want Monica ever to appear in front of him again or have anything to do with him again! That was his bottom line.

In his heart, the woman was dead to him!

He was driving a little fast.

The director had a talk with him today.

On his first day at work, the director suggested that he rest for another month.

The director said that he had just recovered from a serious illness and that it was most important for him to recover fully. In reality, it was because the news that morning had a great impact on his reputation, which naturally affected the hospital’s reputation as well. Therefore, he was temporarily suspended.
