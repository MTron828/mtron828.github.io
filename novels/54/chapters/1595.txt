“What are you two talking about? Aren’t you going to celebrate my wedding tomorrow?” Nox suddenly sat down. He reeked of alcohol and was still in high spirits. “I rejected all my friends who wanted to celebrate my bachelor’s night today and invited you guys to celebrate with me instead. Yet, the two of you are here whispering and muttering about something! Monica, you’re pregnant, so I won’t drink with you, but Jeanne, won’t you drink with me? Who almost lost his legs back then to save you?

Jeanne smiled lightly and picked up her wine glass. “Yes, yes, yes. I will never forget your kindness in saving my life. Here’s to you. I wish you and Zoe a happy marriage.”

Nox happily drank with Jeanne.

Jeanne did not drink much, but Nox, on the other hand, downed the entire glass.

“Drink less. Don’t you have to pick up the bride tomorrow?” Jeanne could not help but remind him.

“Of course! I’ll go early in the morning.” As he spoke, he even burped loudly.

Monica was a little disgusted. “Nox, can you not let yourself go?”

“Why do I have to act so prim and proper in front of you?” Nox asked seriously.

“You really do love Zoe a lot.” Monica’s tone sounded a little disdainful.

“Of course I do. I could tell at first glance that she was the one to be my wife. After dating her for so long, I think I have good taste in women.” After saying that, he even smiled smugly.

Monica could not stand how arrogant and complacent Nox looked. She could not help but say, “Where’s Shelly? She’s been with you for so many years, and you’re abandoning her just like that?”

“Can you not mention this person on such a beautiful night? It’ll affect my mood.” Nox poured himself a glass of wine and drank it himself.

“Do you hate Shelly that much?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Or what?”

“Didn’t she give birth to your daughter?” Monica was a little unhappy.

She still believed that Shelly’s daughter was Nox’s.

“Woah! Shelly’s daughter has nothing to do with me!” Nox quickly refuted the rumor.

“Can you swear on your life that you didn’t do anything to Shelly that year when you were alone with her?” Monica asked angrily.

At that moment, Nox’s valiant look suddenly froze. Then, he lost his confidence and said loudly, “Anyway, Shelly’s daughter isn’t mine.”

“Did you do a paternity test? How can you be so sure that it’s not yours?” Monica knew that a horny man like Nox must have sullied Shelly.

“That’s her biological second sister’s daughter, who was abandoned and left for Shelly to raise!” Nox cursed and shouted at Monica, “F*ck, how bad of a man do you think I am?”

Monica was a little stunned. It turned out she had misunderstood Nox.

“I admit that Shelly and I did it once. That night, I got drunk and agitated, so I slept with her, but it was only that once. I checked on that child and later verified with my mother that Shelly is indeed raising her biological second sister’s child,” Nox explained, not wanting them to misunderstand her. “Don’t worry. No matter how bad I am, I’m not as bad as you think.”

“If Shelly were pregnant with your daughter, would you choose to take responsibility?” Monica asked.

Nox was stunned for a second as he did not expect Monica to suddenly ask him that question. and he actually took a second to think about the possibility.

However, he suddenly remembered how badly Shelly had treated him and his family that day, and his expression changed. “But that didn’t happen! There are no ifs between Shelly and me!”

Monica knew that she could not have any expectations for Nox.

“Speaking of which, even if you can’t drink alcohol, you can drink water! Come on and give me a toast,” Nox urged.

After that, he did not ask others to give him their blessings, and Monica did not say anything else. Now that she knew that Shelly’s daughter was not Nox’s, her resentment towards Nox was not as deep. At least Nox still had a conscience. She and Nox took a few sips of their drinks. By then, Nox had really let himself go.

Seeing that, Edward and Finn started to persuade Nox.. “If you keep drinking, you won’t be able to get married tomorrow! ‘
