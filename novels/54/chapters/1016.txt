1017 Millie’s Tragic End

“Was it an accident?” Monica asked again because she did not get a reply from Finn.

Her voice was as calm as ever, which was completely different from what Finn had imagined.

He thought that he would see a devastated Monica, who would break down and lose her temper with him.

However, none of that happened.

The current Monica did not show much emotion. Although she was sad, she did not let others see it.

His throat moved slightly as he said, “The preliminary conclusion is that it was an accident. The specialist doctor had come to South Hampton City from abroad and was uncomfortable with the climate here. In the closed operating room, he suddenly had a stroke, which led to a coma. I’ll inform you of the results after further investigation.”

“Thank you.” Monica thanked him and then left.

There was only unfamiliarity and distance between them. It was as if they were strangers.

Finn stared at Monica’s back and watched as her delicate body walk past him.

At that moment, he suddenly felt that Monica had become a person who could shoulder everything on her own.

The little girl who used to make a fuss and hide behind others when she encountered something seemed to have disappeared.

Finn looked away and looked at Gary, who was in the ward.

Ultimately, he was responsible for that medical accident.

The others… There was nothing else.

…

After Monica returned to the ward, Ruby woke up, and the first thing she wanted to do was to see Gary.

However, Monica stopped her.

Ruby was a little emotional. “Monica, I want to go see your father.”

“Dad is in the intensive care unit now, and we can’t go in. You can’t see him even if you want to,” Monica said bluntly.

“But–”

“You should calm down first.” Monica stopped Ruby from leaving.

“I can’t calm down.”

“Mom,” Monica called out to Ruby with a serious look on her face. “Have you forgotten what dad told you last night?”

Ruby’s heart ached.

“Regardless of whether his surgery is successful or not, you need to take care of yourself. Now, are you going to listen to him?” Even Monica’s tone was a little heavy.

“I–”

“I’ll get the nurse to send some food over now. You should eat something first.” Monica did not give her mother a chance to refuse and immediately pressed the call bell. “Please send us five sets of dinner.”

“Alright.”

Monica dragged Ruby over to the sofa.

Sarah’s family was also in the ward. However, they could not stop Ruby, yet Monica could.

Ron was a little surprised by Monica’s determination.

In his mind, Monica was still a little girl. Although she was seven years older than Sarah, she would still quarrel and fight with Sarah over things. It was as if she never grew up.

Yet now, was she the one who had to bear the burden of that family? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

To be able to take care of her mother after her father’s surgery failed, even Ron felt a little sorry for Monica.

Nobody expected that her family would suddenly encounter such an accident.

In fact, he had also seen the news today and knew that Cardellini Enterprise was facing a lot of difficulties. However, he did not dare to mention it right now, for fear that his sister and Monica would not be able to accept it.

He did not know what would happen to his family in the future.

If Cardellini Enterprise really went bankrupt, based on Gary’s current situation, he probably would not even be able to afford to stay in the hospital.

Not only was the cost of a heart transplant a huge sum of money, but the postoperative care would also cost a lot. On top of that, there was a medical accident during the surgery, and Gary was very likely to become a vegetable. Taking care of a vegetable would also cost a huge sum of money.

Ron could not think anymore. He really did not know they could tide over such a mess.

The caretaker brought five sets of dinners.

“Uncle, you, aunt, and Sarah must be tired. You should all go home after dinner. I’ll take care of things here,” Monica said to them.

“I’m fine. I’ll stay with you guys. Sarah and her mother can go back.”

“All of you, go back.” Monica was very determined. “I’ll stay here tonight to accompany my parents. However, I’ll be going to work during the day. When I’m at work, I’ll have to trouble you to come to the hospital to accompany my parents, uncle.”

“You’re going to the company?” Ron asked worriedly.

“Yes.” Monica nodded.
