1102 Announcing Jeanne’s Identity As The Princess of the Sanders

Edward was led by the staff to the Sanders’ ceremony hall.

Not many people in the Hall as there were only about 30 chairs.

At that moment, only a dozen or so people were at the scene, all of whom were political officials of the Sanders.

Other than Edward, the rest of them were not businessmen. In fact, businessmen did not have the right to attend the Sanders’ wedding. The Swans were there because Zachary was instrumental in helping the Sanders build the nation. The Sanders had always been “grateful”, so naturally, they would treat the Swans differently.

Edward sat there calmly.

The number of people in the ceremony hall gradually increased.

However, no one was talking to each other. Everyone looked serious as if they were not here to attend a wedding but to have an important meeting.

“Fourth Master Swan.” In the hall, a staff member appeared respectfully in front of Edward and said in a low voice, “The leader is asking for you.”

Edward glanced at the staff.

Then, he got up and left with the staff without any hesitation. They passed through the courtyard of the residence and walked toward a building that was more heavily guarded than any other place.

Edward was asked to wait outside.

After the staff member went in to report, he came out and said, “Fourth Master Swan, please come in.”

With that, Edward walked in.

There were many guards inside. In fact, they were everywhere, which made the atmosphere seem overly strict and quiet.

He passed through a central room and entered a study.

In the study, Warren stood in front of his table, writing calligraphy. He looked calm and relaxed.

After the staff brought Edward there, he left respectfully and even closed the door for them.

Edward turned around. Slowly, he said respectfully, “Leader.”

“Take a seat.” Warren was writing seriously with the pen in front of him. His attitude toward Edward was friendly and casual.

Edward did not dare to disobey Warren’s orders, so he nodded and said, “Yes.”

He sat on the mahogany sofa next to Warren, and there were some tea sets on the coffee table in front of him.

Warren said, “A minister went to the Gilead for some networking. When he left, the other party gave us two boxes of Gilead’s specialty tea leaves. I haven’t tried them yet. Would you like to be the first to try?”

“Sure.”

Edward picked up the teapot and poured himself a cup.

Warren’s writing hand paused for a moment as he turned to look at Edward, who drank the cup of tea without any hesitation. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After that, he turned back and continued to write seriously.

“Gilead’s black tea lives up to its reputation. When the tea enters the mouth, it is refreshing and rich. There is a sweet aftertaste in your throat, and it also moistens the throat,” Edward commented.

“Is that so?” Warren stood up straight and examined the calligraphy he had just written. Then, he slowly put down his pen and walked over.

Edward hurriedly stood up, showing his respect.

Warren seemed very easygoing. “Please sit.”

After Warren sat down, Edward followed suit and quickly poured a cup of tea for Warren.

Warren picked it up and tasted it slowly. As he tasted it, his expression relaxed, showing that he was satisfied with the tea leaves.

He put down the teacup and nodded. “Good tea indeed.”

Edward poured Warren another glass.

Warren said, “Edward, aren’t you curious why I wanted to see you alone?”

At that moment, he could not help but admire the man in front of him for being so calm.

Was the man really afraid that he would kill him now or that he had poisoned the tea?

“You must want to ask why my father isn’t here.” Edward found an excuse that would not make the situation awkward.

Warren took the teacup and took another sip.

He listened to Edward, who explained in a respectful voice, “My father hasn’t been in good health recently. His rheumatoid symptoms have been acting up, and he has difficulty moving his legs. The doctor recommended that he rest in bed and walk in moderation. That’s why he specifically told me to attend the wedding on his behalf. He also told me to apologize to you in person.”

“Old Master Swan is too polite. Of course, his health is more important. Make sure your father takes good care of his health.” Warren had an affable look on his face.

“Thank you for your understanding, Leader. I’ll definitely go back and pass on the message to my father.”

“Yes.” Warren nodded. After that, he put down his teacup and said, “One reason I called you here is to ask about your father, but the other reason is…”

Edward did not react strangely to it.
