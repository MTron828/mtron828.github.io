Chapter 237: Ms. Lawrence, I Haven’t Had a Woman for a Long Time Either

“Yeah. When we left, you were drunk. Kingsley carried you and bumped into Fourth Master Swan. Fourth Master Swan wanted to snatch you away. Kingsley was about to start a fight with Fourth Master Swan, but you suddenly reached out and touched Fourth Master Swan’s face, mouth, neck, and chest...”

“...” Jeanne’s hand trembled even more as she held the mascara brush.

“Oh right, you also said that you haven’t had a man for a long time and that you really want one,” George repeated what Jeanne said last night.

Jeanne suddenly put down the mascara brush on the dressing table.

She finally understood what Fourth Master Swan meant by that message he had sent this morning.

Jeanne seemed to vaguely recall the scene from last night.

She thought that it was a dream she had.

After all, how could she do something like teasing Fourth Master Swan in public?

“Mom, when Kingsley left, he told me to keep an eye on you. Don’t get drunk next time,” George reminded Jeanne.

Next time?!

That would not happen!

The next time Jeanne drank, she would beat herself to death!

“I’ll go downstairs for breakfast,” George said after he kindly helped Jeanne “recall” her experience last night.

Jeanne nodded.

George left.

After he left, Jeanne could not hold it in any longer.

She looked at herself in front of the makeup mirror.

Her eye makeup was completely ruined!

Her cheeks did not need blush anymore. At this moment, her face was as red as an apple.

She could not go on like this.

In the future, she had to stay far away from Fourth Master Swan!

After a long time, Jeanne finally calmed down.

The reason she calmed down was just to deliberately let herself not think about what happened last night.

She put on her makeup again and went to work.

Her damaged sports car was repaired and sent back. She drove to the Lawrence Enterprise’s building.

There was a high-level meeting today.

Jeanne had just walked into the office when Amy reminded her about the meeting.

In the meeting room, Alexander’s face was very cold.

Alexander had not been in a good mood recently. No one knew who had offended him. Logically speaking, the Lawrence Enterprise’s e-commerce project was now in full swing. Although the logistics department had slightly delayed the progress, after this week’s intensive construction, the progress should be about the same as expected. According to Alexander’s personality, he should be proud at this moment.

However, he had a straight face throughout the meeting.

Probably only Jeanne knew that Alexander had lost 5% of his shares, which was why he was extremely unhappy.

Alexander said, “Today’s meeting is mainly about a change in the position of the senior leaders. Adrian’s matter made the board of directors think a lot. The board unanimously decided to make a change in the senior leaders. Of course, it’s not to question everyone. It’s just to prevent the senior leaders from staying in the same position for too long, which would easily lead to unnecessary things. For example, Adrian. It was because he had been in his position for too long that he had come into contact with more people, which led to him walking on a path of no return. The board of directors wants to let everyone develop better, so it was suggested that the senior leaders of the Lawrence Enterprise are rotated. As for how exactly the rotation will happen, it hasn’t been decided yet. Senior leaders, you may plan your careers first. You can communicate with me in advance if you have a position you’re interested in. The Lawrence Enterprise will complete the rotation within this month.”

After he said that, everyone was still a little surprised.

They were somewhat against the idea of suddenly changing jobs when they were already doing well in their jobs.

Nonetheless, due to Adrian’s matter, it seemed like it was only right for the board of directors to have such considerations. Therefore, even though some people were dissatisfied, they did not say anything in the end.

“Let’s not waste everyone’s time. The meeting is adjourned!” Alexander did not like to show off during this period. After he finished speaking, he left with a cold expression.

On the other hand, Jeanne felt that this was how a manager should manage time. The biggest problem of a company was wasting all their energy in meetings!

After the meeting, Jeanne returned to her office.

This rotation in the department... was indeed a good thing for the Lawrence Enterprise.

There could be a reason to have a new batch of new people on the rotation.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered. She picked up the phone and said, “Amy, come in for a moment.”

“Okay.”

Amy knocked on the door and entered.

“Director Lawrence.”

“Go to the general affairs department and get me a list of the achievements of all the senior leaders of the Lawrence Enterprise.”

Amy was a little surprised.

“I need it.”

“Okay.” Amy nodded.

“Is Forrest Here?”

“He should be.”

“Send him in for a moment.”

“Understood.”

Amy went out.

After a while, Forrest came in.

“Director Lawrence.”

“Sit.”

Forrest sat opposite Jeanne respectfully.

“In the meeting earlier, it was decided that the senior leaders will be rotated.”

“I heard about that,” Forrest said bluntly, “Everyone is making a big fuss now.”

“I want to take this opportunity to replace some of the senior leaders.”

Forrest frowned slightly.

“You should be able to guess my goal. I won’t hide it from you. I just want to change a new batch of people who are loyal to the Lawrences. Now, many of the higher-ups are relying on their qualifications in the Lawrence Enterprise to sneer at the management of the Lawrences. This isn’t a good thing for us.”

“What you mean is that you want to take this opportunity to fire some of the senior leaders?”

“I wouldn’t go so far as to fire them. I just don’t want them to take on such important positions. I want to then recruit new talents to form a new management team.”

“I think the Lawrence Enterprise should’ve done this a long time ago! Some senior leaders took advantage of their seniority and their years of experience in the Lawrence Enterprise to not do much. Not only did they not do anything, but they also affected some of the decision-making directions at the management level. It’s undeniable that many of the senior leaders have market experience, but how can experience support the market development of an enterprise? They also needed a visionary market vision and unlimited enthusiasm for their work. Only someone like you can be considered a true leader of an enterprise, Director Lawrence,” Forrest said righteously.

Jeanne smiled. “When did you learn to suck up to people?”

“I’m not flattering you; I’m telling the truth,” Forrest said seriously.

Jeanne did not say much and went back to the main topic, “Since we both have the same idea, I’ll leave the matter of changing the senior leaders to you. Now, I’ve asked Amy to get a copy of the senior leaders’ achievements. Help me carefully refine the specifics of each leader. The main point is to give me a suggestion on who can or cannot be kept. Then, we’ll think of a reasonable way to make those who aren’t useful anymore leave.”

“Okay.” Forrest nodded.

“That’s all.” Jeanne usually did not talk nonsense after she had finished her work. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Director Lawrence, I’m still a little curious.” Forrest looked at Jeanne.

“Huh?”

“You’re already worth so much, so why are you still managing the Lawrence Enterprise so painstakingly? It’s said that the Lawrences don’t treat you well enough.” Forrest could not help but say, “If it were me, why would I manage the Lawrence Enterprise? I’d be merciful if I don’t make the Lawrence Enterprise go bankrupt immediately and leave them with nothing!”

“The reason people are getting richer is not only because of hard work but also the choice of the outcome. If I let the Lawrences go bankrupt, perhaps I would be able to take revenge, but I would gain nothing from them; if I help the Lawrences develop and eventually take control, my benefits would be unlimited!”

“You’re an expert indeed!” Forrest gave her a thumbs up. He was convinced.

Jeanne smiled. “Go out and work.”

“Understood.”

Forrest left.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a cold smile.

In reality.

Even if the Lawrences did not go bankrupt, the Lawrences would get what they deserved!

Virtue had its rewards, evil its retribution. It was just that the time had not come.
