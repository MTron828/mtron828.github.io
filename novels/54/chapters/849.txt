850 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

However, she did not want to hide it from them either. So, she told her in the end.

After listening to Monica’s story, Ruby was furious.

“We really misjudged Michael!”

“I was blind to think he was the man who treated me best. Who could’ve known he’d be so sinister and cunning? He said that he liked me, but he just wanted to gain the trust of the Sanders. I won’t let Michael get what he wants, Mom.”

“I support you.” Ruby said quickly, “But your video yesterday didn’t seem to have much of an effect. I’ve read many of the comments. Though there were positive and negative comments, they were split evenly. Instead, many were envious of your dancing.”

Monica was speechless. She would be sure to read them later.

She saw that many people had even tagged her on Facebook to post more dance videos. She had also been drunk, then.

“How could the public be so accepting?” She thought that she would be scolded to death after the video was released yesterday.

“The more things you come into contact with, the more tolerance you have.” Ruby was very open-minded.

Monica was a little anxious.

“By the way, when are you going to teach me?” Ruby suddenly asked.

Monica almost spat out the rice in her mouth. She stared at her mother, eyes wide.

She finally understood why so many people had nothing but good words to say about her dancing.

Even her mom thought her dancing was cool.

Ruby smiled. “Although it was a little restrained, you looked really good.”

“…”

It seems there was no way to play happily anymore.

When she felt normal, everyone would criticize her and say she was not popular. However, when she was unpopular, she would be praised to the heavens.

So whose worldview was wrong?

She quickly finished her meal and returned to her room in a huff. Just as she was laying on her bed with a look of despair, her phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at it, and her expression changed immediately.

She answered. “Hello.”

“Monica, have you no sense of shame?!” It was Reese’s irritable voice on the other end.

There were still some people who could not stand it.

She rubbed her ears. “That’s right.”

“You!” Reese gritted her teeth in anger.

“I’m so shameless. Please tell your son not to be with me.” Monica deliberately provoked Reese.

“You b*tch.”

“Your son’s even more despicable, don’t you think? For him to still want a woman like me, how could he be anything good?”

“Shut up! Who are you to talk about my son like that?!”

“Mrs. Ross, I don’t want to argue with you anymore since it’s a waste of my energy. So let me tell you one more time. No matter what kind of person I am, my goal is very simple. It’s to keep your son away from me. If you can persuade your son to leave, you’ll never hear from me again. However, If you can’t, I’ll destroy the Rosses’ reputation!”

“Monica!”

Monica had already hung up the phone. She even blocked Reese’s phone number.

Reese was indeed about to call back after Monica hung up on her, but she kept getting notifications that her call was still connected. In her anger, she called Michael.

Michael was not in a good mood today. He had obviously seen Monica’s video, and no man would be able to tolerate it. Fortunately, the comments were not too bad. However, he did have some internet trolls write some good things about him to make his presence known. Deep down, he could not bear to see Monica do such things.

He saw his mother calling and answered. “Hi, mom.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Monica really is lawless!” Reese was furious.

“Mom, I think it’s best you don’t interfere in the matter between me and Monica.”

“How can I not?! I’m so angry with Monica. She’s embarrassing us by fooling around out there like that.”

“Monica didn’t cause too much public repugnance, so there’s no need to say anything more, mom. I’ll take my time once I marry Monica.”

“Are you saying that I have to wait until Monica is in the family? ” Ruby said through gritted teeth.

“Yes.”

“Alright, then,” she said fiercely. “When Monica enters the Rosses, I’ll let her know how powerful I am!”

Michael dare not say more. He had to calm his mother down so the wedding could at least go on as planned. He was definitely marrying Monica.

He gritted his teeth and sent a message to Monica. “You’d better not do anything rash,” he threatened her.

Monica took a look at his message and sneered. She wanted Michael to give up on marrying her.
