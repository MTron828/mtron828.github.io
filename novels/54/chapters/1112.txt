1113 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

“Kingsley, I don’t want to!” Jeanne refused and kept shaking her head.

She did not want anyone to die for her.

“Your survival is more important than anyone else’s!”

“I’m not important, I’m not important at all!” Jeanne was on the verge of breaking down.

From the moment Edward said that he would die for her, she had been holding back until she was about to break down.

“I’m not that important for all of you to protect me with your lives. What’s so important about me that you’re willing to go to this extent for me, cause a country’s war, and be stained with the blood of so many people? I’m just a nobody. I’m not worth it!”

“You’re worth it!” Kingsley enunciated each word.

“Kingsley, do you think I’ll be happy if you do this? Do you think that if you, Edward, and everyone else were dead, I would still be alive? Do you really think I can be so heartless? Do you really think I will–”

“You will because George is still waiting for you,” Kingsley interrupted her.

Jeanne’s heart ached.

There was still George.

For a long time, she did not dare to think about George because she did not know if she could always be by his side. Hence, she did not allow herself to think about him so much.

“For George’s sake, stay alive,” Kingsley said, deeply.

Jeanne’s entire body tensed up.

It was so depressing that it was unbearable.

For George... She could not just do nothing.

Kingsley added, “The Hills, Sanders, Duncans, and Swans should have settled this long ago. This is something that can not be avoided, and what would it become in the end… Promise me that it’s all history. Don’t take revenge or hold a grudge. This is a process of natural selection. If I die, it’s because I’m not strong enough. If the Sanders, Duncans, and Swans are defeated, that will be their end. No one should bear the consequences of this ending. It’ll be over.”

An end was an end.

Whoever was not capable enough deserved to die, and he could not blame anyone for that, so there was no need to take revenge!

“K01!” Kingsley ordered, “Protect Jeanne.”

“Yes!” K01 was determined.

Kingsley was about to leave with everyone when Jeanne suddenly called out to him, “Uncle.”

It was rare to hear her call him that.

Kingsley pursed his lips.

At that moment, his expression finally changed to one that no assassin had ever seen on Kingsley’s face.

“I’ll wait for you to come home,” Jeanne said.

‘I’ll wait for you to come home. In the future, whatever you say, I won’t resist you anymore. I won’t make you angry anymore.’

‘In the future, we’ll be a family and live happily together.’

“Yes,” Kingsley responded.

Then, he took everyone with him and left their hiding place.

Lucy left with Kingsley too.

Since Kingsley had only ordered K01 to protect Jeanne, the others naturally did not dare to follow her.

Before Lucy left, she gestured to Jeanne and said, “Don’t worry.”

She wanted to reassure Jeanne, but little did she know that that was the last thing she would say to Jeanne!

Jeanne’s eyes turned red as she watched them leave in front of her, exposed to the rain of bullets.

As they left, another group quickly chased after them.

The war was getting more and more intense.

“Jeanne,” K01 reminded her.

He was telling her that she could leave now.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Since everyone wanted her to live, she had to stay alive. With that, she followed K01 and left in another direction, away from the battlefield.

Under the night sky, gunshots rang out everywhere. Every sound seemed to make the world tremble.

The shooting went on for the entire night. There were countless casualties, and corpses and blood were everywhere.

As the sky gradually brightened, the sound of gunfire also gradually decreased. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Edward and Nox led a group of people and hid in a deep trench. In front of them was a dead end.

Kingsley had been forced into a corner.

Of course, since they did not know how many men Kingsley had left, they did not dare to attack him so easily.

“Fourth Master.”

Jack Lynch, the leader of the Duncans in charge of this operation, called out to him respectfully.

“Yes.”

“Do you need any reinforcements?” Jack asked.

They knew that in their current situation, they might not be able to take down Kingsley.

After all, Kingsley’s men were all top-notch assassins. Although there were not many of them, they had not gained any advantage after a night.
