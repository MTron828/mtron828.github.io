897 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

As she leaned over, a voice sounded in her ear. “Fourth Master Swan has stood up from his seat.”

The person in charge of surveillance in the Hills would send a message directly to all the assassins present.

Jeanne paused for a moment before she continued walking forward as if nothing had happened.

She had only taken a few steps when her body was suddenly pulled back.

She turned around, only to see Edward suddenly taking her away.

Jeanne wanted to resist, but she was afraid of causing too much of a commotion, so she held back.

She knew very well that there were many people around them, and many of them were from the Hills. If she was taken away, people would notice, and someone else would take over her work. It would not affect their operation too much, so she chose to accept it. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Edward led her into a private room in the wedding hall, which looked like a place for the bride to change and put on makeup.

Jeanne furrowed her brows and looked at him.

The next second, Jeanne made her voice deeper, which was completely different from her original voice. “Is there anything I can do for you, sir?”

There were many things an assassin could do, and disguising and changing voices were basic skills that any professional assassin would know.

Edward looked at her intently.

Jeanne was very respectful and did not panic at all.

She did not think that Edward had discovered her. After all, other than her appearance and voice, she had even put on perfume, and she had never used perfume before. It was impossible for her to be recognized so easily.

Furthermore, when they passed by each other at the dessert section, Edward did not react at all. He did not even look at her.

Of course, George would not tell Edward about her existence. She was sure…

At that thought, Jeanne calmed down and faced Edward calmly.

In the quiet space, Jeanne spoke again. “If you don’t have any other request, I’m going out to work– Mm.”

Jeanne froze and widened her eyes at the man who suddenly approached her.

She watched as his lips pressed against hers.

He did not even give her any chance to resist. He quickly and accurately kissed her lips and even went deeper… It made her breathless.

Jeanne took two seconds to react. No, it should have been more than two seconds.

Her heart began to race, and she suddenly felt an uncontrollable urge, which caused her to allow Edward to go crazy on her lips.

Ultimately, Jeanne returned to her senses.

The moment she was about to suffocate, she came back to her senses. She pushed away the man in front of her who seemed to be even more out of control than her.

However, the more she resisted, the more he kissed her. It was as if he wanted to kiss her into his body.

It was as if he was venting his anger on her with the kiss.

“Mm… Let go… I…” Jeanne pushed him away harder.

In front of that man, she had no power to resist at all.

Her eyes narrowed, and she bit down hard with her teeth.

“Ugh!” Edward let go of her.

She knew that she was strong. Just one bite and his tongue was covered in blood.

At that moment, his lips were dyed red, and he looked a little ferocious.

Jeanne’s face was flushed with anger. “Sir, please watch yourself.”

Edward looked at her angry face and suddenly smiled. As he smiled, he wiped the blood off his lips.

That impeccably handsome man was like Satan the moment his blood-red lips curled into a smile. It was evil and deadly charming.

He said, “What if I say no?”

“Then, I’ll scream! Don’t forget that you’re a married man. If I expose you for having an affair outside, I’m afraid you’ll be despised by everyone like Michael,” Jeanne said fiercely.

Edward really infuriated her.

“In that case, just shout.” With that, his entire body pressed down on her again.

Jeanne turned around and rushed to the door.

Just as she turned the doorknob, the door was slammed shut so hard that Jeanne could not open it.

She turned around and glared at him.

“I like it…” He whispered in her ear.

Jeanne’s face turned red because this man’s explicit words had completely overwhelmed her.

When she thought of the cold and abstinent man the world thought he was...

Every time she thought of that, she gritted her teeth.

“Ah” Jeanne could not help but cry out.

However, she shut her mouth.

At that moment, Edward was biting her ear, teasing her…
