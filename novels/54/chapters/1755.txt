Chapter 1756: A Celebration Party For Finn and Monica’s Babies

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Nox was socializing, his eyes were fixed on Shelly. He watched as she quietly stayed by Bella’s side.

“Mr. Winter?” a man who was socializing with him suddenly called out to him.

Nox’s eyes flickered, and he could not believe he was distracted. He then calmly resumed his conversation with the other party. However, his eyes were still on Shelly. He felt that he would never get tired of looking at her.

Shelly, who was with Bella, was drawn to Bella’s naive appearance. Seeing how happy Bella was, she felt a little guilty and thought about when she would be able to give Bella such a beautiful and unforgettable birthday party.

At that thought, she could not help but turn to look at Nox, and her heart skipped a beat. That was when she realized that she depended on Nox and even had some expectations. It also made her question whether it was really because of Nox’s performance recently that she found Nox to be a reliable person.

Moreover, seeing how relaxed Nox was socializing and how imposing he looked in a suit, he was indeed a contrast to the lazy Nox at home. It seemed like Nox had been surprising her again and again. Did she not realize the other side of him before, or was he really learning and trying to change everything about himself?

“Shelly.” A familiar female voice sounded from behind.

Shelly turned around and saw Sarah holding a man’s hand as she walked toward her happily. In response, Shelly smiled at Sarah.

“Are you alone? Where’s Nox?” Sarah was a little unhappy.

Sarah was deeply prejudiced against Nox. After all, she knew a lot about Shelly, and the more she knew, the more she believed Nox was a bad person.

“He’s socializing.”

“He left you alone to socialize? He clearly knows that you’re not familiar with this environment, yet he still doesn’t consider your feelings!” Sarah complained.

Shelly smiled indifferently and said, “Nox has changed a lot. Besides, there’s nothing I could do about todays social gathering. When we walked into the hall, many people were already waiting for him. To not bore me out, he told me to take Bella out to play.”

Nox’s actions had warmed her heart. After all, he knew very well how much she hated such business gatherings like that.

“Are you putting in a good word for Nox?” Sarah scrutinized her.

Suddenly, he felt that Shelly had changed. Shelly always used to look annoyed when she talked about him. It was as if she did not want to talk about him. However, now that Nox was mentioned, she defended him, and Sarah could tell that something fishy was going on between the two of them. “No, I’m just stating a fact.” Shelly felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by Sarah.

Sarah clearly did not believe her.

Just as she was about to retort, Shelly changed the topic. “Is this your boyfriend?”

Sarah seemed to have just noticed the handsome man she was holding. As he stood next to her, they looked like a well-matched couple.

At the mention of her boyfriend, Sarah blushed shyly. It was rare for a thick-skinned person like her to react that way unless it was true love.

She nodded. “Yes. This is Brandon.”

Ever since Finn exposed their relationship, they had been dating publicly. Even their parents had met, and as families of equal status, they naturally hit it off well. The two of them also received approval from their parents, which made it easier for them to date.

“I’m Shelly. Nice to meet you.” Shelly reached her hand out.

Brandon shook hands with her politely. “Sarah often mentions you. She said you’re her best friend, and I must say, you really are as beautiful as she says.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Shelly blushed. After all, her beauty was a result of plastic surgery, and there was nothing beautiful about her. Sometimes, she would even get tired of looking at her current face and miss his original face. Unfortunately, it had been destroyed long ago.

“Sarah, I’m going over there to socialize with some guests,” Brandon said softly.

“Alright.” Sarah nodded.

After Brandon left, Sarah stared at his back and wrinkled her nose. She complained, “Men are all the same.”

Shelly chuckled. “Men have their business to attend to. Don’t be so petty.” “Hmph,” Sarah harrumphed.

“I wonder if Monica has arrived or if the two babies are here,” Shelly said..
