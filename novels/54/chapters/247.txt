Chapter 248: Seek Help From Fourth Master Swan

Late at night, Monica hugged her legs as she squatted in the dark alley.

Her mind was filled with the images of Jeanne being chased crazily.

She thought about how Jeanne distracted the others to ensure her safety.

Her tears kept falling.

Monica did not know why they were suddenly being chased, but she was afraid that Jeanne would die.

She bit her lips tightly.

Monica was there alone, and her body was trembling.

Those who had not experienced it would never know how torturous this was!

After a while, she heard the sound of a car speeding.

A black car drove into the alley, and an emergency brake was made as it stopped at the entrance of the alley. At the same time, Monica heard someone call out to her anxiously. “Monica, Monica, where are you?!”

Monica cried even more

She had never needed a hug as much as she did at this moment.

She had never needed someone to appear in front of her as much as she did at this moment.

Her throat moved slightly.

With a hoarse voice, she said to Micheal, “I’m here.”

Micheal heard the voice and quickly went over.

He went over and saw Monica squatting on the ground as if she had suffered a great injury. She looked weak and helpless.

Micheal suddenly hugged Monica tightly in his arms.

It was as if he was afraid of losing her.

Monica was caught off guard by Micheal’s hug. She could feel Micheal’s nervousness and all of his feelings for her.

She should not have hesitated at all.

She should not have... kept a trace of hope... even if she did not want to admit it herself.

“Monica, don’t be afraid. I’m here. I won’t let you get hurt again,” Micheal said, his firm tone and sturdy chest gave Monica a great sense of security.

This was the peace of mind that Micheal gave her!

Monica wiped her tears.

She tried her best to calm herself down.

Monica knew the most important thing now was to save Jeanne!

She pushed Micheal away. The two of them hugged each other for no more than two minutes.

Monica said, “Micheal, send me to the Swans’ manor. I want to find Fourth Master Swan!”

Micheal looked at Monica.

“I saw Fourth Master Swan tonight. I believe he’s there. Other than him, I don’t know who else I can find to save Jeannie. Jeannie is currently being chased by someone!” Monica suddenly said very calmly.

The girl who was clearly scared out of her wits and whose body was trembling just now displayed tenacity and strength at this moment.

Micheal was slightly startled.

He said, “I called the police. The police have gone to look for Jeanne’s traces according to what I said.”

“I don’t trust the police.” Monica looked straight at Micheal. “I was scared out of my wits just now, so I asked you to help me call the police. On second thought, I don’t trust the police at all. The police are all under the Sanders!”

Micheal was stunned.

He had always thought that Monica was very innocent and did not know anything.

Nonetheless, at this moment, he vaguely felt that Monica seemed to know that this accident was related to the Sanders.

Micheal nodded.

He did not want to be suspected by Monica, so he agreed immediately. “Okay, let’s go to the Swans’ manor.”

Micheal pulled Monica up from the ground.

The moment Monica stood up, her feet suddenly went weak, and she almost fell.

“Monica.” Micheal held her up.

“I’m fine.” Monica gritted her teeth. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She must have fallen from the car and busted her knees.

That was why she felt intense pain as she walked.

Monica sat in Micheal’s car.

She did not have the mood to care about where she was injured. She just waited nervously for the car to drive into the Swans’ manor.

Monica was still afraid.

The fear of death just now made her feel like breaking down.

At this moment, what she was afraid of was that Fourth Master Swan was not around.

What if Fourth Master Swan was not around?

What about Jeanne?!

Monica’s eyes were bloodshot.

She was trying hard not to cry.

‘Don’t think too much.

‘I’m determined that Jeanne will be alive.

‘Jeanne will surely live!’

With that, they headed to the Swans’ manor in a frenzy.

As it was nighttime, the gates of the Swans’ manor were tightly shut.

The guards at the entrance did not allow Monica and Micheal to enter, saying that they had to obtain the consent of the Swans.

Micheal’s communication was ineffective multiple times.

At this moment, Monica was so angry that she wanted to let Micheal drive the car and crash into the gates.

When she called Fourth Master Swan and Nox, no one picked up still.

‘Am I going to fail here?!

‘I can’t fail.’
