1095 Lucy’s Resistance

“I’m looking for Jeanne,” Kingsley said coldly.

Lucy was very respectful. “She’s inside.”

Kingsley nodded and walked past Lucy with his long legs.

Lucy turned to look at Kingsley’s back before she left silently.

Jeanne watched Lucy leave before turning to look at Kingsley, who was standing in front of her.

Kingsley handed her her phone.

Jeanne took a look at the phone and took it. “So, it makes no difference whether I’m there or not.”

“Don’t think I don’t know how much of a role you played in this matter.” Kingsley’s expression darkened.

Jeanne ignored Kingsley.

She sat on the sofa in Lucy’s room and turned on her phone. She had not turned on her phone for a long time, so she did not know if anyone had contacted her.

She looked nonchalant.

Kingsley sat beside Jeanne and looked at her. “We’re going to South Hampton City next Wednesday.”

Jeanne’s fingers that were tapping on her phone paused.

Then, she raised her head and looked at Kingsley.

“For Stacey’s wedding.” Kingsley said, “The Sanders will invite the Swans to their wedding that day.”

“And?” Jeanne looked at Kingsley.

“Then, we’ll have to kill Old Master Swan.” Kingsley looked at Jeanne and said, “And Fourth Master Swan.

There was a change in Jeanne’s emotions.

Kingsley saw that, but he did not show any other expression. He said, “The Sanders have suffered a great loss in Harken during this period of time. Michael’s death sentence and Sunny Pharmaceutical’s bankruptcy have caused the Sanders to lose both wealth and manpower. On top of that, the Sanders has not been able to find the descendant of the Duncans for a long time, so the Sanders can’t wait any longer.”

“You mean, the Sanders has decided to risk everything?”

“Actually, it’s understandable. The Sanders and the Swans have secretly fought many times, but they have never won. Seeing that Warren no longer has absolute control, he naturally won’t let the Swans become stronger under his nose.”

“Isn’t Warren afraid of failure?” Jeanne was still a little surprised. “Logically speaking, even if the Sanders were forced into a corner, they wouldn’t be so eager for quick success. In case of failure, the Sanders can’t afford to pay such a huge price. To put it bluntly, they will lose the country.”

“But there’s no other way. If he allows the Swans to continue developing, the outcome will be the same. The Sanders are already in a difficult position.”

Jeanne nodded.

In fact, Kingsley was right.

The Sanders had no choice but to attack the Swans.

During this period of time, the Sanders suffered a lot of losses, and they also discovered that their control over the Harken was getting weaker and weaker. If they did not take the initiative to attack, they might become more passive in the future.

However, Jeanne did not think that the Sanders had a 100 percent chance of winning against the Swans.

By now, Jeanne was almost certain that the Swans or, to be precise, the descendant of the Duncans that the Swans supported was already very powerful.

If the Sanders were not careful, they might really be defeated.

Jeanne pursed her lips. “Who’s Stacey getting married to?”

“William Gates.” Kingsley enunciated each word clearly.

“As expected, it’s him!” Jeanne sneered. “I can’t believe the Sanders is making Stacey marry someone twice her age.”

“In the royal family, marriage is never a child’s play.” Kingsley looked at Jeanne. “Aren’t you the same?”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Was she not forced to marry Edward? If the Sanders had not forced her, she would not have married Edward.

“When are we leaving?” she asked.

“In three days.”

“Alright.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Let me remind you.” Kingsley’s eyes turned cold. “If you show mercy this time, no one can save you.”

He was probably still brooding over the fact that Jeanne almost died to save Edward and was instead threatened by Edward.

Jeanne did not answer, and Kingsley did not say much either. In any case, he would stop when it was necessary.

As he got to leave, Jeanne suddenly called out to him, “Kingsley.”

Kingsley stopped in his tracks.

“It’s going to be very dangerous this time,” Jeanne asked him.

“Yes,” Kingsley responded.

This time, a war would break out.

Once the Sanders started to make a move on the Swans, especially on Old Master Swan and Fourth Master Swan, who was the head of the Swans, it meant that the Sanders no longer cared. The Swans and the Duncans that the Swans supported no longer had to put on a disguise. The two families’ power would instantly explode, and it would be a matter of time before a fight broke out.
