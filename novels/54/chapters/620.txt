Chapter 621: The Cause of Jeanne’s Mother’s Death Revealed (Must Read)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She never wanted to return to that place and suffer that kind of torture again.

“Say that again!” Eden’s eyes turned icy as if threatening her.

Jasmine did not dare to resist as she was really too afraid of Eden. The man was simply a beast — completely inhuman!

Eden pulled Jasmine up from the floor, and Jasmine could only follow him out of the hall.

She turned back to look at Jenifer, who clearly saw her request for help. Yet, Jenifer remained unmoved. At that moment, she even averted her gaze.

Jasmine’s heart turned cold.

That was the mother she had always thought doted on her. However, in the face of benefits, who the hell was she?

Jasmine laughed sarcastically and desperately as Eden dragged her to the car.

In front of others, Eden could still put on a little act, but when there was no one around, Eden took his revenge. The moment she got into the car, Eden kicked her ruthlessly.

Eden vented all the anger he had suffered from Jeanne on Jasmine.

If it were not for this woman, who schemed against him back then, he and Jeanne would not have ended up like that.

He would not have to suffer so much now, which made him extremely frustrated.

Jasmine did not dare to resist Eden’s kicking.

She just hugged her body.

Her love for Eden had disappeared without a trace because of this man’s cruelty. She even wanted to take revenge, but she did not have the power to, and for the sake of benefits, her biological parents did not care about whether she lived or died!

Jasmine could not help but cry.

She had never regretted something so much in her life. She regretted scheming against Jeanne and stealing Eden from her.

Every time she thought about it, she wished she could kill herself back then!

…

At midnight, the city was peaceful, and Monica was sitting in Finn’s car.

The two of them were quiet, so much that Monica thought she could hear her heartbeat.

She really wanted to say something, but their argument that afternoon had ended on a sour note.

She did not dare not speak, yet she wanted to talk to him.

While struggling with her thoughts, she secretly turned to look at Finn.

She saw that he was driving seriously, but he did not seem to be overthinking it as much as she did.

Finn’s indifference disappointed Monica a little, and she sighed.

The moment she retracted her gaze, she glanced at the speed displayed on the driver’s dashboard.

She thought she had seen wrongly, so she suddenly turned around, took another look, and then a few more glances.

She could not believe that Finn was driving at a speed of 110 miles per hour.

They were in the city! The speed limit was 50 miles per hour. Was Finn crazy?

Did he not use to drive slower? That speed of his really drove her crazy sometimes.

Yet now, he suddenly changed his mind. Did he take the car as a plane?

Monica completely forgot about her dilemma and blurted out, “Finn, aren’t you driving a little too fast?”

It was just a kind reminder, and she sounded very gentle.

However, Finn replied coldly, “There’s no car on the road at this hour.”

“Even if there are no cars on the road, you can’t drive like this! What happens if a car or a person suddenly appears out of nowhere? It’s dangerous, “Monica said with lingering fear.

“If you think it’s dangerous, you can get out of the car.” His tone was as cold as ice.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She felt that she could not even talk to Finn right now, let alone say a single word. As soon as she did, she would be asking for trouble. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hence, she turned her head out of the window and looked at the streets in South Hampton City.

As she looked at the neon-lit night sky, silence filled the car again.

Anyway, Finn would definitely not take the initiative to speak up if she did not say anything.

Finn, that b*stard, was always so petty.

Soon, the car arrived at the entrance of a residential area.

Monica even believed that the reason Finn drove so fast was to send her away as soon as possible. He just did not want to see her.

The car was parked, but Monica did not get out of the car for a long time. The more Finn treated her like that, the more she wanted to go against him.

If he was angry at her, she could also infuriate him.

Finn waited for a long time and was getting impatient. He said, “Get out of the car!”

His tone was cold and commanding.

However, Monica pretended not to hear him.

Finn also did not speak again. Instead, he suddenly pulled out his seatbelt and opened the door of the driver’s seat. Then, he walked to the passenger’s seat and opened the door.

Monica frowned as she looked at him looking down at her condescendingly.

Under the streetlights, his face was cold and grim.
