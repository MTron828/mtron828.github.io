Chapter 834 Successful Escape: Letting Go To Stay Alive

Killers never used anesthetics because they were afraid that they would not be able to control their bodies.

“Bear with it.” Finn reminded Edward.

“Mm.”

Finn casually tore off a piece of cloth from his shirt, folded it into a square, and placed it in Edward’s mouth. “Bite it hard.”

Edward did as he was told.

Finn began to dig the bullet out of Edward’s thigh with pliers.

In that instant, Edward’s body trembled and tensed up under the intense pain.

He tensed himself up so much that he could not move.

Edward clutched the handles of his seat tightly, and the pain made him look fierce.

Finn removed the bullet as fast as he could. He then cleaned the wound deeply, disinfected it, stitched it up, and applied medicine to it.

By the time Finn was done, Edward had fainted from the pain.

Perhaps it was because Edward had been running around for a few days, or perhaps it was because his body had reached its limit.

At least, Finn and Nox had never seen Edward faint from pain.

After Finn was sure that Edward had only fainted, he began to treat the other wounds on his body.

When Finn untied Edward’s right hand, he was still shocked by the bloody flesh.

Nox had been maneuvering the helicopter the entire time. He only turned back to look at them occasionally and saw Finn treating Fourth Master Swan’s wounds.

He asked anxiously, “Finn, how is Fourth Master Swan?”

When he first saw Fourth Master Swan’s condition, he thought he was going to die.

How did Edward have such shocking power after that?

Was his previous body condition a pretense or was the outburst after that his limit?

Once Edward exceeded his limit, he might die.

Nox was a little restless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Finn looked at Edward’s right hand and did not reply to Nox for a long time.

“Don’t tell me Fourth Master Swan is dead!” The moment Nox spoke, he was so scared that he almost gave up on steering the helicopter and went over.

“No,” Finn hurriedly replied, “He just fainted from the pain. ”

He was afraid that Nox would do something that would risk their lives.

“Then why aren’t you saying anything? Are you trying to scare me to death?!’

“I was just thinking…” Finn hesitated. He looked at Edward’s wounds and the condition of his right hand. “I was just thinking that no matter what Fourth Master Swan did to Jeanne, she has no right to hate him.”

“Of course.” Nox went straight to the point. “If not for saving Jeanne, would Fourth Master Swan be so seriously injured?! How dare she be angry and even had the nerve to give him a hard time just now? If she didn’t save his life, I would’ve shot her to death before I left! She should be glad that Fourth Master Swan used her to survive. Otherwise, I wouldn’t let her off even if I turned into a ghost.”

Nox was filled with righteous indignation.

Finn was not as emotional as Nox. He had always been much colder than Nox, so his emotions would not fluctuate so much.

He only felt that...

Fourth Master Swan was really willing to give up his life for Jeanne.

Whatever Edward did today to survive was only because he did not have to choose to die if he could live.

However...

Did Jeanne understand?

Would she understand?

Finn felt that his thoughts might be a little redundant.

After all...

Even if Edward and Jeanne understood each other and still loved each other, it would still be very difficult for them to be together.

…

South Hampton City.

Monica was discharged.

She rested in the hospital for a day.

The doctor said that as long as she did not do anything stupid and went home to rest, her wound would heal very soon.

Her parents accompanied her out of the hospital.

No matter what, they would never let her live alone again.

She could understand them.

After what happened, they would probably not leave her side.

Monica did not resist and decided to return to her parents.

In the end...

She also regretted her suicide.

Monica was also afraid that she would do it again, so she needed someone to accompany her.

When she was discharged, Michael came.

He was still very polite.

Monica could see that her parents had even better feelings for him.

She did not expose Michael.

She did not expose him for the time being.

Monica would stop her wedding with Michael in her way.

She would do it without having to die.

Michael sent them back to the Cardellinis’ villa from the hospital.

He was very busy with work, so he left the villa after staying for a few minutes.

After he left, Gary could not help but say, “Michael is really nice to you. We were prejudiced against him in the past because of Finn, but now that you and Finn have completely broken off, don’t reject Michael anymore. The wedding is on the 15th of next—”
