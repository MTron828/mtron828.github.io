Chapter 1643: Nox Barks Like a Dog

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly was a little stunned when she heard Nox knocking on the door.

She did not know why he was here at this time. Should he not be by Zoe’s side and taking good care of their baby? Even if he did not want the baby, he should at least discuss with Zoe what to do with the baby, right?

No matter what, he should not have come to her! Did he forget what he said? If he came looking for her again, he would be no better than a dog!

“Shelly, I know you’re home. Open the door!” Nox shouted from outside the door.

“Mommy.” Bella was frightened by the noise outside, and she sounded like she was about to cry again.

Shelly took a deep breath. Whether it was Nox torturing her on purpose or the cyberbullying attacks they had suffered, she felt sorry for Bella the most. Bella was so young, but she had to go through so much with her.

Shelly walked over and said to Bella, “I’ll let you play with my phone for a while, but can you go back to your room for now?”

“But outside…” Bella was terrified.

“Don’t worry, I’m Superwoman, and I can solve any problem.” Shelly smiled and comforted Bella.

With that, she brought Bella back to the bedroom and closed the door for Bella before opening the main door.

When the door opened, she saw Nox’s angry appearance and heard him roar, “Shelly, if you don’t open the door, I’ll smash it—”

That was when he paused and saw that Shelly had opened the door. Just like that, the two of them looked at each other coldly.

Eventually, Nox seemed to have held back his temper, but he was still a little unhappy. “Why didn’t you open the door?”

Why did she not open the door? Was there a need for her to explain herself?

“I have something to tell you.” Nox looked quite serious. At that moment, he walked straight into Shelly’s house.

However, Shelly stood in his way and said, “A few days ago, you said that if you came looking for me again, you would be no better than a dog.” Nox almost choked on his own saliva. “That’s because you looking for me.”

“You didn’t say in your promise that I couldn’t look for you.”

“Shelly, is it that hard for von to give me a wav out?” Nox was furious.

In fact, he did not even know why he lost his temper at Shelly. He could tolerate anyone, but he could not control himself when it came to Shelly!

“I just want you to go through with your promise.” Shelly refused to budge.

“I said, I have something to tell you.” Nox was exasperated.

“When you promised, you said that you wouldn’t come looking for me ever again!” Shelly stood her ground.

Nox glared at the woman in front of him. He was so angry that he wanted to strangle her.

For two minutes, the two of them were in a stalemate. However, Shelly did not have much patience with Nox, so she pulled the door close.

“Woof! Woof!”

Shelly looked at Nox in a daze. For a second, she thought she had heard wrongly as she could not believe that Nox had barked like a dog in front of her!

She continued to stare at Nox with her mouth agape. After barking, Nox looked visibly embarrassed!

“Is that enough?” Nox asked angrily.

It was the most embarrassing moment of his life! It was even more embarrassing than being cuckolded by Zoe. After all, he did not ask for Zoe to cheat on him, but he had barked like a dog out of his own free will!

What about his dignity? He really wanted to kill himself because of Shelly! “Move aside!” Nox roared angrily, trying to hide his embarrassment.

Shelly was speechless. It had crossed her mind that Nox would come looking for her. Even though she had made him promise, with Nox’s personality, he might go back on his word. Hence, she had no choice but to do something about him! However, never in a million years did she think that Nox would actually bark like a dog. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At that moment, she did not know how to reject Nox! Looking at Nox’s current appearance, she even found it funny and could not help but laugh. She had never thought the day would come when Nox would bark like a dog.

Shelly’s smile angered Nox, and his face turned red with anger.

Just as he was about to fly into a rage again, Shelly heard Nox deliberately lower his voice and say, “Happy now?”

Shelly did not answer. She just tried to hold in her laughter.

It seemed like it had been a long time since he had seen Shelly smile. In his memory, the woman did not seem to like to smile much. She had always had a straight face.

Nox was a little lost in thought. For a moment, he had forgotten that he wanted to go into Shelly’s house..
