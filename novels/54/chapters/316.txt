Chapter 317: Set a Date for the Wedding

Jeanne took a look and paused when she saw the string of Arabic numbers.

She did not save Fourth Master Swan’s name, but she knew that was his number.

She took a deep breath, and only then did she recall that Fourth Master Swan said he would take her to see his father tonight.

However, she really did not want to go.

She picked up the call. “Fourth Master.”

“Are you off work?” the man on the other end of the phone asked.

Jeanne looked at her work and said, “Yes.”

“I’m downstairs.”

“I’ll be right down.” Jeanne put down the phone.

She was halfway through writing the proposal and some planning. However, she saved all the files, turned off the computer, and then left work.

Amy was surprised to see Director Lawrence leaving work so early.

She saw that Director Lawrence had a lot of work to do, and based on her understanding of Director Lawrence, she would only leave after she had dealt with all her work. Moreover, was there not a collaboration with MUK Group at 10 a.m. tomorrow? She had always been fully prepared for negotiations.

Therefore, Jeanne thought she would visit Old Master Swan and spend time with Fourth Master Swan before coming back to work overtime.

......

With that thought in mind, she arrived at the lobby of Lawrence Enterprise’s building.

At that moment, it was just time to get off work, and there were some people at the door. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Among the crowd, Fourth Master Swan’s ostentatious appearance there really made him stand out.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and went over, where Fourth Master Swan handed Jeanne the bouquet of roses in his hand.

“Thank you.” Jeanne smiled.

The next second, someone grabbed her hand and pulled her into the car.

It was a very simple action, but it made the onlookers gasp in surprise.

They found Fourth Master Swan’s every move, every frown, and smile too handsome. There was an indescribable charm to him.

In the car, Jeanne’s hand was held tightly in Fourth Master Swan’s palm.

At the same time, he stared at her without blinking, with his other hand still propped on the car window.

No matter how calm Jeanne was, she was also baffled by the gaze. She said, “Fourth Master, is there something on my face?”

“No.”

If not, why was he looking at her like that?

“You look good.”

Speechless, she thought, ‘Stop flirting.’

Jeanne turned her face to the side and looked out the car window. Even from her side profile, her face was visibly red.

The car drove steadily into the Swans’ courtyard and into Universe Garden.

In fact, Jeanne had been here seven years ago.

She had already forgotten about it, but now the memory resurfaced in her mind again.

When the car arrived, Edward personally opened the car door for Jeanne and led her into the house with their hands held.

Jeanne moved her hand, feeling that it was a little weird. However, Edward did not seem to notice anything as he continued to hold her hand and walk intimately into the main hall.

At that moment, in the main hall, Old Master Swan was sitting in the middle seat, looking as if he was waiting for them.

Wade was standing beside him.

The two of them just watched as Edward and Jeanne showed up, holding hands. There was no expression on their faces.

Edward said, “Dad, Uncle Wade.”

That was when Jeanne began to feel awkward.

What should she call him?

Would it be too informal to call him as Edward did?

Would it be inappropriate to call him by his seniority?

Just like that, there was silence for a few seconds.

Jeanne’s palms were sweating. Before she really established a relationship with the Fourth Master, it seemed more appropriate to call him by his seniority. Hence, she smiled and said, “Grandpa Swan. Grandpa Wade.”

Edward pursed his lips and said in a serious tone, “Call him uncle.”

“...”

Could he not ruin the situation at a time like that?

She was embarrassed enough.

“It’s alright.” At that moment, Old Master Swan opened his mouth and said, “It’s just a form of address. You can change it slowly in the future.”

‘You can change it slowly in the future.’

Jeanne was moved as she never expected that Old Master Swan would give her an out.

However, Old Master Swan did not say much either. “Wade, get the servants to serve dinner.”

“Yes.”

With that, Wade left.

After a while, he respectfully invited them to the table to eat.

On the huge antique dining table, Old Master Swan still sat in the most conspicuous position.

Wade was not a servant, so he naturally sat next to Zachary.

In the meantime, Edward sat on the other side of Zachary while Jeanne sat with Edward.

The dining table was so very quiet that Jeanne felt like the air had frozen.

“I heard the two of you are getting married,” Zachary suddenly said.

“That’s right,” Edward answered respectfully.

“Have you chosen a date?”

“The 16th of this month.”

Zachary had to think for a few seconds.

Then, Wade said respectfully beside him, “It’s this Saturday. There are still... four more days.”
