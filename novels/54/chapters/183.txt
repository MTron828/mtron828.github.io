Chapter 184: Willing but Unable

Fourth Master Swan’s back was torn apart.

It was bloody and seemed somewhat rotten.

Jeanne looked straight at it.

She did not know what Edward had gone through for his back to be injured like that.

It was as if something dug his back, and it looked terrible.

“Do you feel sorry for him?” Nox asked again.

After not receiving a reply from Jeanne, he asked again.

Jeanne snapped back to her senses.

She forced herself to come back to her senses.

She looked at Nox and said, “It has nothing to do with me.”

Right.

It had nothing to do with her.

Jeanne had only kicked Fourth Master Swan on the back. During other times, she had not touched his body at all. Most importantly, she was not the one who had injured him to this extent. She had nothing to feel guilty about.

She turned around coldly. “I’m going to take a shower.”

“...” Nox watched her leave.

He thought that Jeanne was indeed special.

Not to mention Edward’s heavily injured body, most women would be scared to death when they saw his back.

If Nox was not used to it, he would have been scared to death as well.

Nonetheless, Jeanne did not react at all. Even if she was a little shocked, she definitely did not have the fear reaction that a normal person should have.

She was even able to remain so calm at this moment and left.

Nox turned around and looked at Fourth Master Swan.

He watched Finn help Fourth Master Swan clean up his wounds.

Nox was wondering if Fourth Master Swan would be able to move Jeanne after doing so much for her...

If not...

How miserable would Fourth Master Swan be?!

…

Jeanne took a shower.

She took a shower quietly.

After coming out of a place like the detention center, she really wanted to wash her body.

Even so, her mind was filled with Fourth Master Swan’s hideous back at this moment.

What exactly happened to make him suffer such serious injuries?

What kind of great endurance did he have that one could not tell the condition of his body at all?

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

Yes.

She could not afford to offend Fourth Master Swan.

She felt that deeply at this time.

…

Outside the bathroom.

Finn was cleaning up Edward’s wounds, removing the areas that were inflamed or even rotten.

Fourth Master Swan was enduring patiently, his entire body covered in sweat.

“Why are you injured so badly this time?” Finn could not help but ask.

It had been a long time.

Fourth Master Swan had not been injured to this extent.

“It was all because of your phone call,” Nox answered from the side.

He guessed that Fourth Master Swan could not say anything at this time.

Finn paused.

“Of course, you’re not to be blamed.” Nox smiled. “The culprit is taking a shower.”

“Your wound is a little deep. After I clean it up, I’ll give you some anti-inflammatory medicine,” Finn said to Fourth Master Swan without asking any more questions.

“Okay,” Edward replied.

Finn moved very quickly, trying to alleviate Fourth Master Swan’s pain.

“Try not to do any strenuous exercise in the next few days,” Finn reminded.

“Does bed exercise count?” Nox asked.

“Yes,” Finn answered seriously.

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. “Nox smiled.

“If possible, try to recuperate on the bed. Wait for your wound to heal and form calluses before you get out of bed. Otherwise, if the wound is accidentally torn, you’ll have to start again.”

“Okay,” Edward replied.

After Finn was sure that the wound had been completely cleaned, he began to apply some medicine.

Nox could not bear to watch any longer.

Even his flesh and blood were trembling.

On the other hand, the man who was suffering from the pain did not cry out.

He was holding the bedsheet tightly, which vaguely showed that he was trying his best to endure the process.

After Finn finished applying the medicine, he began to bandage the wound.

Layer by layer, he wrapped the gauze around Fourth Master Swan’s body.

“Don’t get your wound wet, and don’t sweat,” Finn said. “Keep the temperature at home below 20 degrees Celsius.”

Nox hurriedly adjusted the temperature of the air conditioner from the original 22 degrees Celsius to 18 degrees Celsius.

“I’ll come over every day to change the medicine.” After Finn finished bandaging the wound, he put on an IV drip for Fourth Master Swan.

He packed his huge medical box.

Finn did not bring the medical box over. He had always prepared one at Fourth Master Swan’s place as he might need it from time to time.

Everything could be found in the medical box. It was no less than a set of equipment in his hospital.

“Are you done?” Nox asked.

“Yes.” Finn nodded and said, “Don’t turn over for the time being.”

Fourth Master Swan responded to him.

Following that, he closed his eyes.

After exhausting his energy, he needed to take a deep rest.

Finn saw that Fourth Master Swan was going to sleep, so he did not say anything more.

Nox also sat on the couch by the side and quietly accompanied him.

After Finn finished packing up the medical kit, he returned it to its original place and started to clean up the stained cotton swabs on the floor.

At that moment, Jeanne came out of the bathroom.

She was wearing a set of casual clothes, but they were not pajamas.

Jeanne did not expect that when she opened Fourth Master Swan’s cloakroom, half of the clothes inside were women’s.

All the sizes were hers.

She did not know how she felt. In the end... She concluded that Fourth Master Swan was just rich.

A man with a net worth of hundreds of billions of dollars would not be so stingy as to buy a few pieces of clothes. No matter what, with a wave of his hand, he could get all the new hot-selling items.

Jeanne smiled.

In order to alleviate her guilt, she could think of anything.

She found a set of sportswear. After not taking off her tight-fitting professional suit for the whole of yesterday, she wanted to let her body relax a little. At this moment, after taking a shower, she put on loose clothes, which made her feel comfortable.

As soon as she walked out of the bathroom, the cold air caught her off guard and made her sneeze.

She rubbed her small nose.

Was it because she did not dry herself after taking a shower?

Why did she feel so cold?

Her sneeze instantly attracted the attention of everyone in the room.

The man, who was clearly sleeping, opened his eyes and looked at her.

“Nox,” Edward said.

Nox did not need to think to know what Fourth Master Swan was going to do. He refused immediately. “No, Finn said that the room should be kept at a low temperature. Otherwise, your wound will easily become inflamed.”

Edward seemed to have paused for a moment. He looked at Jeanne’s outfit.

It was a set of yellow sportswear.

Jeanne wore a short-sleeved hoodie and a pair of loose shorts. Beneath the shorts, her fair and slender legs were exposed.

“Go and change into a long-sleeved shirt and long pants,” Edward said to Jeanne.

His tone was still very serious.

Jeanne was speechless.

He was lying there and could not move, yet he was still being so controlling.

Jeanne did not know why she listened to him and obediently walked into the cloakroom again.

She told herself that she was cold and would not go against her body.

As such, she changed into a set of long sportswear and walked out.

It felt much warmer indeed.

“Come here.” Fourth Master Swan did not even open his eyes as he spoke in her direction.

Jeanne was even suspecting if he was calling for her.

She walked over slowly.

When she went over, she happened to see Finn holding a basket of used medical cotton buds and was preparing to take them out.

They were all blood red.

Finn seemed to be used to it, so he took the basket and walked away calmly.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

“Sleep with me for a while,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly said.

Jeanne frowned.

“I’m sleepy.”

“...” Jeanne thought, ‘I’m not.’

“Don’t worry, I’m willing but unable,” Fourth Master Swan said faintly.

Jeanne immediately understood what he meant.

Her face was a little red.

“Nox.” Fourth Master Swan did not receive a reply from Jeanne. Instead, he called out to the person who was playing with his phone on the couch.

Nox hurriedly put down his phone. “I’m willing to sleep with you.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Get out.”

‘How heartless.’

Nox stood up from the couch. He glanced at Fourth Master Swan and then at Jeanne. “Ms. Lawrence, take it easy.”
