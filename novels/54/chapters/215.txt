Chapter 216: She and Fourth Master Swan Won’t Be Together

On the wide streets of South Hampton City.

Monica was sitting in a car with Jeanne. It was the kind that made one’s blood boil.

She was very agitated. “Jeannie, when did you become so good? I’ve always thought that you were amazing since young. You never spent much time studying, but your results were better than many people. Now, not only are you better than the average person, but you’re also better than everyone—a lot better. Quickly tell me how you became like this? Is it…”

Monica’s expression suddenly became serious.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

“You were reborn!” Monica enunciated each word.

Jeanne rolled her eyes.

‘Does she think that I have superpowers?!’

“Is it?” Monica looked straight at Jeanne, very persistent.

Jeanne replied, “No, I’m just an ordinary person.”

“Don’t say that you’re an ordinary person. If you say that you’re an ordinary person, I’ll feel that I’m not worthy of being a person!” Monica was very serious.

Jeanne smiled.

Sometimes, she felt that Monica was very funny.

With Monica around, she would not lack happiness.

Jeanne said, “Monica, I’m really not as amazing as you think. I happened to find some evidence that could prove my innocence in this lawsuit. Let’s put it this way—what’s real is real and what’s fake is fake. As long as one spends some time to think a little more, one can find the truth.”

“Is it that simple?” Monica was stunned by Jeanne’s words.

“As for the 53 billion dollars in personal assets, they’re not mine.” Jeanne smiled again.

“They’re not yours?” Monica was agitated. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jeanne replied, “No, they’re Kingsley’s.”

“Kingsley.” Monica was puzzled.

At that moment, she suddenly turned around and looked at the man sitting in the front passenger seat.

She, Jeanne, and George were sitting in the back seat.

While Monica and Jeanne were chatting, the man in the front row did not say a word.

Monica had almost forgotten about such a big figure.

She hurriedly stretched her neck and asked, “Are you Kingsley?”

Kingsley heard Monica’s voice and turned around. The corners of his mouth pulled into a faint smile. “Yes.”

“Jeanne’s money is yours?”

“Mm.” Kingsley nodded.

“Why did you give Jeanne so much money?” Monica was curious.

“Because she needed it,” Kingsley said casually.

Monica’s jaw almost dropped.

She looked very excited and asked, “What’s your relationship with Jeannie?”

‘They can’t be…

‘In that kind of relationship…

‘Can they?’

Kingsley was very handsome. He looked mature such that he seemed attractive.

It was just that…

He was a little too old.

That said, older men were better at loving someone dearly.

In this era, age and height were not problems.

What Monica was a little disappointed about was…

She had always thought that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan could develop.

Fourth Master Swan…

Monica suddenly felt that Fourth Master Swan was so miserable.

Her emotional changes were noticed by Jeanne and Kingsley.

At this moment, Kingsley did not answer her about his relationship with Jeanne.

Jeanne also did not take the initiative to tell Monica about her relationship with Kingsley.

Even though she knew that Monica had misunderstood.

Kingsley said, “I’ve heard Jeannie talk about you before.”

Monica was stunned.

At that moment, she was somewhat flattered. “About me? What did she say about me?”

“That you’re very cute, loyal, and beautiful.” Kingsley’s gentle voice was as warm as the spring breeze.

Monica thought, ‘Can I say that…

‘My heart is beating a little fast?!

‘Other than Micheal, is there such a warm man in the world?!

‘He looks like the kind of man who would especially dote on a woman.’

Monica smiled brightly and asked, “Did Jeannie really say that about me?”

“Yes.” Kingsley nodded.

Monica was excited.

At this moment, she felt a little embarrassed. She held Jeanne’s hand and asked, “Am I that good?”

Jeanne smiled helplessly.

She could already imagine that Monica was feeling very proud

“On second thought, it seems to be the case.” Monica started to be narcissistic.

Jeanne was used to Monica’s unreserved attitude.

She changed the topic. “Monica, should we send you home?”

“Home? Shouldn’t we celebrate?” Monica was not satisfied.

“I haven’t slept well these few days. I want to go back early to rest. Once I’m rested, we’ll meet again.”

“Alright then.” Monica was still very considerate. “You should rest first.”

“Mm.”
