Chapter 302: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

However, halfway through, Fourth Master Swan stopped abruptly.

That was when he heard Fourth Master Swan say, “Play by yourself.”

After that, Fourth Master Swan left his side.

George bit his lip.

He refused to admit that at that moment, he did not want Fourth Master Swan to leave.

Hence, he lowered his head and started playing by himself.

The melody of the piano was still there, but he thought it felt a little monotonous.

In the hall, George was playing the piano while Jeanne was on the sofa, looking at her phone.

Tomorrow was the deadline.

She was looking at the ticket to leave tomorrow when she paused because she felt that someone had sat down beside her.

She put down her phone and looked at Fourth Master Swan.

Was he not playing anymore? He was playing pretty well!

However, she did not say anything.

......

Instead, she heard him say, “What does George like to do?”

Jeanne was stunned.

She was a little surprised by what Fourth Master Swan said.

For him to suddenly ask about George...

She replied, “He likes to code.”

Neither she nor Kingsley had forced George to code.

It was just George’s hobby.

To be precise, all of George’s current skills were his hobbies, and she had never forced him into learning anything.

“Will he like the amusement park?” Edward asked.

No.

However, she said, “You can try.”

That was because she had never brought George there before.

Back then, she had a lot of things to do overseas, so she could not spare much time to spend with George.

Besides, George did not like to go out either.

“Let’s go to the playground in the afternoon. You can go and prepare to head out.” Edward left after saying that.

Jeanne stared at his silhouette.

There was nothing to prepare for going to the amusement park.

She turned her head and looked at George, who was not in the mood to play.

George was probably not interested in the amusement park at all.

However, after lunch, they still sat in Fourth Master Swan’s luxurious car and left Bamboo Garden.

It was the first time Jeanne saw Fourth Master Swan in such casual clothes.

He was wearing a grey t-shirt, a pair of black jeans, and a pair of white sneakers. His hair was obviously not well-groomed, and it hung down naturally. It was even a little messy.

Nevertheless, it was undeniable that a good-looking person would look good no matter what they wore or how they wore their hair.

In fact, she thought that the simple set of clothes he wore was of higher quality.

She knew that even though Fourth Master Swan’s clothes looked simple, they were not cheap.

Eventually, the car arrived at a large-scale amusement park in South Hampton City.

It was not a weekend, so the amusement park was not crowded.

However, there were still quite some people who came and went. All of them were a family or a couple.

After Edward led Jeanne and George out of the car, he told the driver to leave.

Then, Edward personally went to the amusement park’s ticket counter to buy the tickets.

Jeanne stared at his back and then turned around to look at her surroundings. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

At that moment, George looked at the amusement park behind the main gate. “I don’t like this place.”

Jeanne knew that would be the case.

With that, she squatted down to the same height as George and told him, “Bear with it.”

George nodded.

Jeanne smiled and stroked George’s curly hair.

Having bought the tickets, Edward walked over to them.

Jeanne stood up and followed him into the amusement park.

In the amusement park, there were all kinds of large-scale entertainment facilities, and as soon as they entered, screams filled the air.

Jeanne held onto George’s hand and followed behind Edward.

They did not know where he was heading toward.

However, it was a large amusement park anyway, and he walked in front to lead them while they followed behind him the entire time.

They walked for at least half an hour.

By then, George’s small brows had furrowed.

He disliked outdoor activities the most.

He really disliked it.

Jeanne could also feel George’s displeasure, but looking at Fourth Master Swan’s determined footsteps, she held it in again and again.

They walked for another ten minutes or so before the long legs in front of them finally halted.

Jeanne and George could finally catch their breath.

She was still feeling alright.

Although Fourth Master Swan’s legs were very long, she could walk fast.

However, it was really too strenuous for George.

He did not like to exercise, to begin with, and his legs were short. Basically, he could only keep up by walking and running.

“I’ve never been to the amusement park before,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne was stunned.

Could it be that the big shot did not know what to do in the amusement park, and that was why he brought them on that crazy journey?!

Edward felt a little awkward being stared at.

At that awkward moment, Jeanne asked, “Do you want me to bring you around?”

Edward nodded.

“I haven’t been to a place like that in a long time. The last time I came here was with Eden.”
