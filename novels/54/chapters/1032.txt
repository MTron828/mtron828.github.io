1033 The Honey Trap

In the private room, Monica was in Harry’s arms.

Harry was in a good mood today. He asked, “I didn’t see you earlier. When did you come in?”

He probably thought that she was one of the bargirls.

Before Monica could answer, Harry continued, “I told your lobby manager to find a few decent girls for me, but in the end, he gave me a bunch of gaudy ones. I was wondering why such a big club wouldn’t have any stunners. However, I’m very satisfied with you.”

Monica just smiled without saying anything.

In fact, she had been to the nightclub many times, and it was common to come across perverts like Harry, who was in his forties or fifties.

“Keep me company tonight, and I’ll tip you to your satisfaction.”

“There’s no need to tip me, but if I keep Director Chance company tonight, you have to promise me one thing.”

“What is it?” Harry did not expect that little girl to play hard to get.

“I’ll tell you later.”

Monica deliberately did not tell him what she wanted to keep him in suspense.

Those old perverts loved to play tricks anyway.

She had never seen a pig run, but she had seen a lot of pigs like him picking up girls.

“Alright. Then, let’s see what you can do tonight.” Harry hugged Monica even tighter.

On top of that, his perverted hand was trying to rub her back.

Monica endured it. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She had never thought a day when she had to use her body to make a business deal would come for her.

She managed to avoid Harry’s lecherous hands. Then, she picked up a glass of wine and started drinking with Harry. “President Chance, let’s drink first.”

“Why are you calling me President Chance? Call me Harry.”

“Harry, here’s a toast to you,” Monica said affectionately.

Harry could not say no to Monica’s coquettish voice, so he quickly picked up a glass of wine and drank with Monica.

Monica and Harry drank a lot.

It was apparent that Harry’s alcohol tolerance was not as high as he made it out to be because, after a dozen glasses, he could not hold his own anymore.

He said, “Are you trying to get me drunk?”

With that, he pounced on Monica, who stopped him with both her hands.

“Harry, I’d like to sing you a song.”

“Alright. Sing me a song.” Harry was also an experienced womanizer, so he definitely would not do anything to Monica immediately. Especially for older men, the older they were, the more they liked to play tricks.

Monica left Harry’s side and took a deep breath.

She had drunk too much and was still not feeling too great.

After telling the waitress to leave, she picked a song herself.

Steve quickly walked over. “Chairman, are you okay? Did Harry, that old pervert, try to–”

“I’m fine.” Monica said, “I’ll get Harry drunk later and take him to the hotel.”

“What?” Steve was shocked.

It was okay if Monica did not suggest it, but did she really have to take it that far?

“Book a bargirl here for me in The Charm Club, and I’ll get her to accompany him. Don’t worry.” Monica comforted him.

“But–” How could he be at ease about it?

“Just do as I say. Also, get the girl to bring a pill,” Monica instructed.

Steve was worried, but he left the private room in the end.

Monica sang a song.

Harry did not know how to sing the song, but she took the microphone and sang with Monica. At the same time, he hugged Monica with his whole body and almost touched her on the spot.

However, Monica endured it.

After the song, she dragged Harry to drink with her. She even encouraged the men and women in the private room who wanted to please Harry to propose a toast.

That went on a few times until Harry was so drunk that he fell onto the sofa and felt a little uncomfortable.

Monica walked over. “Harry, do you want me to send you back?”

Harry’s body moved. He tried his best to sit up and lay on top of her.

Still, Monica endured Harry’s approach.

There was also the disgusting smell of cigarettes and alcohol on his body.

“To the hotel,” Harry whispered in Monica’s ear.

Monica agreed. “Okay.

Then, she struggled to help Harry up.

When the others saw Monica take Harry away, they tactfully pretended not to see it as they continued to drink, sing, and dance.

Monica helped Harry out of the private room.

After a few steps, Harry felt sick and retched a few times.

“Do you want to go to the washroom first?”

“Yes,” Harry replied.

He was probably feeling very sick.
