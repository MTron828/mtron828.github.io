Chapter 114: Who Wouldn’t Know How to Play the Emotional Card?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Fourth Master Swan’s limited-edition Rolls-Royce Phantom drove into the Swans’ residence.

“Go to Eden Swan’s place.” Edward suddenly ordered.

The driver immediately agreed respectfully.

The car arrived at the Swans Residence’s Purple Pavilion Garden.

Edward sat in the car and said to Teddy, “Call Eden Swan out.”

“Fourth Master, I’m afraid the Eldest Young Master Swan is asleep now. Moreover, he is drunk...”

Edward gave him a look.

Teddy braced himself and went out.

After a while.

Eden Swan appeared outside Edward’s car in a daze. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Uncle Edward, are you looking for me?” Eden rubbed his eyes.

After he came back, Jasmine tucked him in bed and he went to sleep. As soon as he lay on the bed, he was so dizzy that he did not dare to close his eyes. He only managed to fall asleep in the end after some honey water, but he now suddenly woke up… When a drunk person was forcefully woken up from sleep, the feeling was worse than being drunk itself. At this moment, Eden was suffering so much that it could kill him.

“Don’t go down the wrong path.” Edward enunciated each word clearly.

Eden Was dizzy, but he seemed to wake up instantly because of one sentence.

He looked straight at his Uncle Edward.

“I don’t want the Swans to waste all these years training you.” Edward’s voice was cold.

Eden gritted his teeth. “Uncle Edward, are you blaming me for telling Melody about our meal today?”

Eden was not stupid.

In fact, he was even a lot smarter.

Hence, he knew that he could not hide it, and it was better for him to admit it openly.

He said with righteous indignation, “Uncle Edward, I admit that I did not refuse Micheal Ross when he asked me to help Melody create an opportunity with you. Indeed, I was the one who told Melody that we were going to have dinner together tonight. And the reason why I did this was for your own good. You are now being pestered by Jeanne. I know very well what kind of woman she is. Let’s put aside her overseas affairs for now. Even during the years when we dated, she was already willful and did not respect anyone. She relied on her good looks and ordered everyone around.”

Edward’s expression obviously changed.

Since the sky was very dark, Eden could not see it.

Eden continued to say, “Back then, if I was not momentarily bewitched by Jeanne’s beauty, I definitely would not have dated her. When I was dating her, despite knowing that she was willful and unruly, I still chose to endure it for the sake of loyalty and trust. If it was not for Jasmine’s appearance, I might have married her...”

“Eden Swan.” Edward interrupted him directly. “Cheating is cheating. There’s no need for so many grand explanations. It’s useless.”

Eden paused.

He took a deep breath, still looking very excited, “Alright, I won’t say much about my personality. I won’t say anything about what happened in the past either. But Uncle Edward, during the years when Jeanne was abroad, do you know what she experienced? She came back with an illegitimate child. Now, everyone in South Hampton City was saying that George was West’s son. It was because of this relationship that Jeanne won the MUK contract for the Lawrence Enterprise. Otherwise, do you think that she could really negotiate with her own abilities? What do you see in this kind of woman?”

Edward’s eyes narrowed. “Are you done?”

“Uncle Edward...”

“This is the last time I hear you say something bad about Jeanne. I won’t allow it to happen again.”

Eden’s expression was a little ugly.

He had said so much, but was it all fart to Edward?

Jeanne was already so important in Edward’s heart?

So important that he did not care about what others thought?

Eden said, “Is Melody not good enough?”

“Not as good as Jeanne.”

“Even if you slept with Jeanne, you have not slept with Melody Sanders. How do you know that she is not as good as Jeanne? Whether it is better or not, we will only know when we compare!”

“I am not you.”

“Uncle Edward, I am doing this for your own good.” Eden sulked.

“Whether it is or not, only you know the best.”

Eden looked at Edward. At that moment, he looked a little uncomfortable. “Uncle Edward, is our relationship affected because of Jeanne?”

Although Edward was only four years older than him, he had always felt that Edward was an elder, so he always listened to his arrangements. Moreover, he had to admit that Edward was really good to him. Whatever he needed, this uncle of his would give to him.

The Swans had so many properties.

Other than Edward, his father, two other uncles, and an aunt, no one had really interfered. When Eden just graduated from university, he had already been offered an important position at Swanhaven Bank. Once he got married, the entire Swanhaven Bank was a wedding gift from his family to him.
