Chapter 605: Confrontation With the Lawrences, Imposing Presence!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As an ordinary cardiologist, his status was not high enough to attract anyone’s attention, so he could stand in any corner and observe everything without anyone noticing.

As long as he could step out to protect Jeanne when the time came, it was fine.

Contrary to Finn, Jeanne’s appearance attracted the attention of the majority of people in the hall.

Quite some people had come to pay their respects to Old Master Lawrence. There were already some people in the early morning, and now there were even more people.

However,?even with so many people, the hall was still quiet.

Amidst the silence, there was some sadness.

Having been there for the entire night, Alexander, Jenifer, Joshua, Jasmine, and Eden looked a little weak.

When they saw Jeanne’s ruddy and energetic face, some people started gossiping.

“She’s only here now? She really has no respect for her grandfather at all!”

“Her grandfather passed away because of her. How dare she come at this hour? If I were Old Master Lawrence, I would turn in my grave!”

“That’s right. The rest of the Lawrences, including Jasmine and the son-in-law, Eden, have worked through the night. Yet, she’s acting as if nothing happened.”

“Fourth Master Swan didn’t even come!”

“That’s right. I told you something was missing! Fourth Master Swan didn’t even come. Is it because Jeanne doesn’t care about Old Master Lawrence’s death? Or is it because Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne don’t have a good relationship, and everything is just for show?”

“I think it’s both...”

…

When Monica heard the people around her talking, she could not control herself. She really wanted to cut off the tongues of those shameless gossipers.

Just as she was about to scold them, Michael suddenly pulled her back.

As if he had expected her to snap, he whispered in her ear, “Let’s see what Jeannie will do first.”

Monica frowned.

Her teaching those b*stards a lesson and Jeanne teaching the Lawrences a lesson were two different things!

Michael did not give Monica a chance to react as he dragged Monica to the Lawrences. However, Monica endured it.

Alexander also saw Jeanne coming.

He thought that Jeanne would not come after she left yesterday.

It would be best if she did not come because he could use the opportunity to criticize Jeanne after Jonathan was buried.

Hence, when he saw Jeanne appear, his expression naturally turned grim. The same happened with Jenifer, Joshua, and Eden.

On the contrary, Jasmine’s eyes were empty, like she was listening to orders numbly.

“What are you doing here again?” Alexander’s expression darkened, and he looked very imposing.

Jeanne said, “I’m here to send my late grandfather on his final journey!”

“How shameless are you to say that? If it weren’t for you, your grandfather wouldn’t have fallen down the stairs!”

“How can you be so sure that grandfather fell because of me?” Jeanne did not want to be outdone.

Toward Alexander’s aggressive attitude, she was just as fearless as always.

Alexander said righteously, “If it weren’t for you arguing with my father last night, he would have been able to sleep. He wouldn’t have gotten out of bed for a walk and accidentally fall down the stairs!”

“When did I quarrel with my grandpa?” Jeanne asked.

“You did!” Joshua suddenly said with a firm tone, “Because you allowed one of the Sander princesses to come and work in our company, grandpa had some questions, and you started arguing with him. Grandpa was just casually asking, but you were aggressive about it. You made grandpa so angry that he couldn’t fall asleep that night. Now that something has happened to grandpa, you don’t even feel guilty!”

Jeanne smiled sarcastically.

It seemed they had thought of those lines long ago.

Joshua pointed at Jeanne angrily and scolded, “Get lost. I don’t want to see you. Grandpa’s dead, and I don’t want you to cause him any more trouble. I, Joshua, will never acknowledge you as my sister. You will leave our home immediately!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’m not the one causing trouble for grandpa.” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“You’re not leaving, are you? Do you want me to chase you out?” Joshua said fiercely, looking as if he wanted to beat Jeanne up.

At that moment, Finn walked up to prevent Jeanne from getting hurt.

In fact, not many people present should be able to hurt Jeanne. However, since Fourth Master Swan had ordered him to protect her, he had to do his part.

At the same time, Monica could not hold it in any longer.

When she heard Joshua scolding Jeanne, she lost it and went forward. However, Michael kept her behind him, making Monica a little displeased.

She turned her head and was about to question Michael when she saw him go forward. He said fairly, “This is Old Master Lawrence’s funeral, and the family should send Old Master Lawrence off peacefully. No matter what caused Old Master Lawrence’s accident, I’m sure he doesn’t want the family to end up like this. It doesn’t matter. If there’s any conflict, we can talk about it after all of this is over.”

It was a sentence that would not offend anyone, and it also gave Jeanne an excuse to stay.

Monica actually felt that she should be grateful for Michael’s help, but she still felt upset.

She believed there was no need to talk to the Lawrences nicely at that moment. Now was the time to teach the Lawrences a good lesson so they would not stop accusing Jeannie.

Even so, she suppressed her anger and felt very unhappy.

Joshua glanced at Michael and restrained himself a little.

He did not understand why Michael, a person with great ability and prospects, would fall in love with Monica.

Monica must have been lucky!

At that moment, Alexander said, “Michael, you’re right. My father’s death has made me too sad. I’m sorry you had to see that.”

Michael smiled, appearing very polite.

Even in front of outsiders, he always appeared decent and fair. However, no one could see how sinister and dark he was deep down.

Alexander turned his head to look at Jeanne, “For Michael’s sake, and seeing that your grandfather just passed away, I won’t argue with you for now! If you sincerely want to send your late grandfather on his final journey, you have to behave yourself. Otherwise–”

“Otherwise, what? You’ll kick me out of the Lawrences just like seven years ago? It clearly wasn’t my fault, yet you still blamed everything on me. You want me to suffer from your whipping and live a life worse than death overseas–”

“Jeanne!” Alexander’s expression was extremely unsightly.

Jeanne’s expression darkened. “Just because you won’t talk about it now doesn’t mean I won’t! How did grandfather get into an accident like that?”

Suddenly, her presence was imposing!
