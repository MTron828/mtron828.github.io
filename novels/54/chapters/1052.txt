1053 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

The moment Michael was in pain, Monica used all her strength to push him away. Then, taking the chance while Michael was not paying attention, she took a few steps back.

Once Monica was free, she rushed to open the door. However, the door did not open.

In the end, Michael still got hold of Monica. He pressed her against the door, and she resisted madly again, desperately refusing Michael’s approach.

Due to Monica’s refusal, Michael could not do anything to her.

His expression was extremely unsightly.

At that moment, he threw Monica to the ground.

Since Monica was no match for Michael in terms of strength, her body was pushed out uncontrollably. She slammed into the stool next to her and fell to the ground.

The moment she fell to the ground, Michael pressed himself down on Monica’s body before beginning to tear Monica’s clothes open frantically.

Monica twisted her body. Even though she could not move, she did not stop resisting Michael from approaching her.

Provoked by Monica’s resistance, Michael flew into a fit of anger.

Why was Monica not letting him touch her? Why could Monica sleep with any man but not him?

She was the only woman he had ever loved in his life. Why could he not sleep with her?

His expression was extremely terrifying.

Amidst Monica’s frenzied resistance, a slap landed on Monica’s face.

Monica really felt like she had been slapped unconscious.

She could not even see the face of the person in front of her for a few seconds, nor could she see Michael’s cruel face.

“Monica, if you want to suffer less, you better behave!” Michael said fiercely.

However, Monica was not threatened by Michael.

The moment Michael’s face leaned over, Monica hit Michael’s nose with her head so hard that his nose bled from the collision.

Due to the intense pain, Michael let go of Monica’s body and covered his nose with both hands.

Monica took the opportunity to leave Michael’s side. She would rather die than be defiled by Michael.

However, there was an inherent physical disparity between men and women. Monica ran a few steps before her body was shackled by Michael again.

This time, Michael exposed how cruel he really was as he grabbed Monica’s hair and slammed her head against the wall.

The crazy collision made Monica think that Michael might kill her.

After Michael had vented his anger, he looked at Monica’s forehead, face, and mouth, which were all stained with blood. Looking at her disheveled face, he said, “Monica, are you still going to resist?”

Monica’s eyes were bloodshot.

“Whatever I want to do to you, you’d best be good and let me do it. Otherwise, I really will kill you!” Michael threatened.

As he threatened her, he pushed her against the wall fiercely and tore her clothes apart crazily again. He even bit Monica’s body hard, leaving bloody marks on her body.

It was not that Monica did not want to resist. Rather, she could not resist because she could not move under Michael’s shackles.

Even if she could kill herself, she was fine with it. She even felt that death was better than being defiled by Michael.

However, she could not find a way to kill herself.

What about biting her tongue to commit suicide? She could not bite her tongue off at all, and her tongue was already bleeding.

How did the women on TV do it?

As tears streamed down her face and everything was about to happen, the door was suddenly slammed open with a bang!

Monica could vaguely see Steve holding a huge vase and smashing it at Michael’s head.

Michael was stunned for a second, but in the next second, he fainted as he could not hold on anymore.

After that, Steve quickly put down the vase. He took off his coat, put it on Monica, and ran out with her. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everything happened very fast.

Before anyone could react, he had already dragged Monica out of the club and returned to their car.

The car left the club.

“It’s alright. It’s alright,” Steve quickly comforted Monica.

It was because Monica’s current appearance was really scary.

Her body was covered in injuries, and her face was covered in blood. Moreover, she did not seem to be reacting to the situation at all.

All Steve saw was her big, empty eyes.

“I’ll send you to the hospital right now. Don’t be afraid. You’re alright now.” Steve kept comforting her.

He did not know what he could do now.

It was as if at that moment, Monica could no longer hear anything from the outside world, and it made Steve a little worried.

Putting aside the fact that Monica was his superior, he had always treated Monica like his daughter. In any case, he had watched Monica grow up.

How could such an innocent little girl encounter so many things one day?

“Yes, I’m fine.” Monica suddenly said.

Steve was stunned because Monica’s voice was really calm. It was as if nothing had happened just now.

She said, “Mr. Warren, send me back to my villa first.”

“But your injuries...”

“It’s not serious,” Monica said bluntly.

...

As long as Michael did not defile her, it was not serious.

“I don’t want my mom to see me like this,” Monica muttered.

“We can go to another hospital,” Steve suggested.

He was still a little worried, especially when he saw Monica’s empty eyes. It was as if she did not exist in this world anymore.

“Send me back to the villa.” Monica was very determined.

As such, Steve had no choice but to send Monica to the Cardellini family’s villa.

“Chairman.” Steve watched as Monica opened the door and got out of the car.

“I’m fine. Go back and rest early. If the police look for you, give me a call. I’ll be your witness,” Monica said.

After saying that, she walked into the villa.

Steve stared at Monica’s back.

He could not believe that she, at a time like that, would think about the police looking for him and finding trouble with him because he had injured Michael.

...

What was Monica trying to make herself endure?

When Monica returned to the villa, no one was there.

Instead of taking shower, changing her clothes, or doing anything, she just faced the empty house.

All she could think about was the joy and glory her family had in the past.

Suddenly, her phone rang, but she did not take it or even look at it.

What she saw in front of her was what her family used to look like, and everything she was experiencing now had become an illusion.

She suddenly smiled and picked up the fruit knife on the coffee table.

The sharp fruit knife was aimed at her wrist.

“Monica!” Sarah called out to her in shock and stopped her from that unexpected move!

That scream pulled Monica back to reality.

When she came back to her senses, she realized that the fruit knife was on her wrist and had already cut into the skin on her wrist.
