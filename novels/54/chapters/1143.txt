1144 The War Has Started: Finn in Danger

All of the facts made everyone believe that it was all true.

Once people believe it was true, the Sanders would be met with criticism.

At that moment, all the citizens of Harken requested that the Sanders come forward to respond to the report posted and explain the current situation.

When Warren saw the news, he was furious.

Everything had been going smoothly until such a big thing popped up out of the blue. All the things that he had been doing in secret recently had been exposed!

Who was it who could investigate all of his shady matters so thoroughly?

Edward and Nox had been captured, so who else was there?

Could it be the descendant of the Duncans? Was it because they had threatened to expose his identity, so he resisted them?

“Father, what should we do now?” Chester asked.

Warren’s expression was unsightly.

Chester had no choice but to bite the bullet and report the current situation. “Now, apart from the public’s reaction to us and the demand for a response from the Sanders, some officials have also begun to make a fuss. They also want you to give them an explanation for the anonymous accusations against us. Otherwise, it might lead to a strike!”

“Impudent!” Warren slammed his hands on the desk in front of him.

At that moment, he was fuming.

Chester did not even dare to breathe.

“Who did this?” Warren asked fiercely.

It was as if he wanted to tear that person into a thousand pieces.

“I think it might be Finn,” Chester suddenly said.

Warren’s eyes narrowed. “Finn?”

“He’s Edward’s private doctor, and he’s also a cardiologist at South Hampton City Central Hospital. He usually is in contact with Edward. We have even verified Finn’s identity before and had Michael verify if Finn was a descendant of the Duncans for us. Although the final result was that he was not, he is definitely not a simple person. However, because there haven’t been many conflicts between us, we didn’t pay much attention to him. We didn’t expect that our negligence would allow him to take advantage of the situation!”

“How can we be sure that this matter is related to him?” Warren asked coldly.

After all, he was the leader of the country, and there were many things that he could not do personally. There were some things that he would leave to Chester to do, so he only had a vague impression of Finn. As he did not know Finn well, he did not know why his son would suspect Finn.

They simply could not waste their time on some people who were not important.

“First of all, Edward and Nox are imprisoned and have no contact with the outside world. Thus, we can rule out the possibility that they did it. Secondly, I just said that Finn and Edward are related. In other words, it’s very likely that Finn also knows everything, including the existence of the Duncans’ descendant. Lastly, Finn is Gary’s attending physician. When I found someone to drug the surgeon who operated on Gary, only Finn was with the attending surgeon in the operating theatre. I just read the anonymous letter carefully, and the details of the surgery were written so clearly. It’s impossible for it to be so detailed unless it was personal experience. Therefore, we can conclude that it was Finn.”

Warren nodded.

Naturally, he agreed with his son’s reasoning. However, he was still very angry.

He had captured Edward and Nox, but he did not expect that Finn was also involved.

That had ruined his big plan!

“Father, I think the best way now is to kill Finn.” Chester said viciously, “The only person who can prove that our family has done all these shady things is this anonymous informant. Since we’ve locked onto the person, we have to silence him. Then, we’ll come out and deny these allegations. Anyway, in this anonymous letter, a lot of it is logical reasoning, and there isn’t much evidence. We can also use this logic to refute and even arrange for a witness to prove our innocence.”

“Let’s do that.” Warren knew that they did not have much time to waste. “Immediately arrange for someone to secretly get rid of Finn. Be quick! I will discuss with the Minister of Internal Affairs how to clear our name. We’ll give a reply to the public tomorrow morning.”

“Yes.” Chester was extremely respectful.

As he turned around to leave, Warren suddenly called out to him, “Chester.”

Chester quickly turned around. “Yes, father.”

“Don’t let Jeanne know about this” Warren reminded him. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Father, do you still don’t trust Jeanne?” Chester asked.

After spending the past few days together, he believed Jeanne completely.

After all, Jeanne had done her best to attack the Duncans’ power. Moreover, he had to admit that everything was developing in a good direction.

If not for the sudden incident, he even believed that they would get their desired result in less than a week.

Yet, someone just had to appear out of nowhere.

Chester’s expression was also very ugly.

“It’s not that I don’t trust Jeanne, but I’m afraid that she’ll be swayed by her emotions.” Warren said, “If I recall correctly, Monica and Finn are also related.”

“Yes. Finn is Monica’s ex-husband. Monica chose to divorce Finn for Michael. Most importantly, Finn is now Gary’s attending physician.”

“That’s why I’m worried that Jeanne will do something irrational for Monica. You should know how close Monica and Jeanne are!”

“I know.” Chester quickly nodded. “I won’t let Jeanne know.”

“You have to be careful.”

“Yes, father.”

“Go on,” Warren said.

With that, Chester left respectfully.

Not long after he walked out of the study, he bumped into Jeanne.

Jeanne had come to look for Warren, and when she saw Chester, she greeted him politely, “Brother.”

“Are you looking for father?”

“Yes, I saw the news today. I think it’s harmful to our family, so I want to discuss with father how to resolve our family’s crisis.”

“I’ve discussed this matter with father, so you don’t have to interfere. You should focus on finding the descendant of the Duncans and creating conflicts with them. Leave the rest to us.” Chester blatantly rejected her help.

“Does father think the same too?”

“Yes.”

...

“Alright. Then, I’m not worried anymore. I believe that you can handle it.”

Chester smiled gently. “I’m glad father has such a sensible and intelligent daughter like you.”

“You’re too kind,”

“I won’t say more. I have work to do.”

“Take care.” Jeanne smiled.

Then, she watched Chester leave. It was obvious that he was in a hurry.

That meant that Finn was probably in danger.
