Chapter 1638: Zoe Is Pregnant

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It hurts…” Zoe’s face was pale, and her voice had become weak.

Benjamin thought that Zoe was just pretending, so he did not take it to heart. However, Shelly suddenly saw a trace of blood on the spot where Zoe had fallen, and her expression changed immediately.

She quickly turned to look at Zoe’s expression. Seeing that Zoe’s pain was not faked, she quickly called out to Benjamin, “Ben, Zoe is bleeding.”

Stunned, Benjamin stopped moving. He turned to look at the floor and then at Zoe, who was in so much pain.

Zoe, who could only feel the unbearable pain, grabbed Benjamin’s hand. “Please take me to the hospital. Please take me to the hospital. It hurts. It really hurts…”

Benjamin froze. All he did was push Zoe just now, and there was no way a young person would to be in so much pain just from being pushed to the ground. Hence, he looked at Shelly helplessly.

Shelly did not hesitate to say, “Let’s take her to the hospital.’

If something really happened to Zoe, they would be implicated!

“You should carry Zoe downstairs and get a taxi. I’ll be right down with Bella,” Shelly said anxiously.

Benjamin quickly nodded. Then, he squatted down and carried Zoe on his back before leaving quickly.

Meanwhile, Shelly went to her room and carried Bella out. As she knew Zoe had come with ill intentions, she had told Bella stay in the bedroom, but she could not possibly leave Bella alone at home now.

With Bella in her arms, she quickly left the house. She had thought that she would never go out again for a long time, but because of Zoe, she had no choice.

When she carried Bella to the entrance of the neighborhood, Benjamin had just managed to get a taxi. They quickly got in and got the driver to drive to the hospital as fast as possible.

Zoe’s face was pale. However, she did not seem to be in as much pain as she did in the beginning, so it was relatively quiet in the car.

The taxi soon arrived at the hospital, and Benjamin carried Zoe to the emergency room.

The doctor briefly asked about Zoe’s condition and then asked, “Are you married?”

Zoe was stunned. It seemed like not everyone was aware of the gossip that was going on because it was obvious that the older doctor in front of them did not recognize Zoe and Shelly.

“What’s wrong?” Shelly asked nervously.

“I suspect she’s pregnant,” the doctor said.

As soon as he said that, not only Shelly but Zoe was also surprised as she looked at the doctor in disbelief. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The doctor said bluntly, “Based on your condition, you should be pregnant. However, you said your stomach hurt a lot just now, and coupled with the fact that you were bleeding, I suspect there’s a possibility of a miscarriage. So, we need to do an ultrasound on you to confirm it. If it’s confirmed that you have had a miscarriage, we’ll have to perform a curettage for you. But if not much harm has been inflicted on the fetus, we’ll think of a way to protect it.”

Zoe did not seem to believe what the doctor said, and Shelly was a little stunned to speak too.

“Go get an ultrasound scan first and then come back to me with the results,” the doctor said seriously.

After that, he gave them the bill for them to make payment.

Shelly took the bill and glanced at Zoe, who still seemed to be in a state of shock. Hence, she turned to Benjamin and said, “Take care of Bella for me. I’ll go pay the bill.”

Benjamin nodded and held Bella without saying much, while Shelly went to pay the fee and then took Zoe for an ultrasound examination.

When the examination results were out, Zoe was confirmed pregnant. Although the fetal heart was a little weak, it was still there. After seeing the results, the doctor told Zoe to stay in the hospital to make sure the baby was alright.

Zoe, however, still could not believe that she was pregnant as she had never even thought about getting pregnant. Just then, she suddenly remembered that she and Nox did not take any precautions once… which meant it was Nox’s child.

At that thought, Zoe instantly became excited. If she was pregnant with Nox’s child, would Nox let her off? Would that child turn her life around for the better? Would there be a chance for her to start over with Nox?

Shelly saw Zoe’s sudden excitement and knew what Zoe was thinking.

She said, “You’d better contact Nox. We don’t have the money since the hospitalization involves the child.”

Shelly had originally accepted to pay for Zoe’s treatment fees. However, since it was Nox’s child and Nox was so rich, Shelly would save as much as she could.

When Zoe heard Shelly’s words, she became even more unsettled. She asked

Shelly, “Do you think Nox will accept this child?”

For the first time, she calmly asked Shelly for her opinion.

Shelly answered seriously, “I don’t know.”

Based on her understanding of Nox, he was not a soft-hearted person. However, she did not know if Nox would be moved by the child.

“What if he doesn’t want it?” Zoe suddenly thought of that outcome and broke out in cold sweat.

“That’s between you and Nox. It has nothing to do with me.” Shelly said coldly,

“I’ll go and settle the hospitalization procedures for you first.”

In the end, she paid for Zoe’s hospitalization fees. She could not hold any hope for Nox anyway, and the need for Zoe to be hospitalized to make sure her fetus was alright was indeed related to her. Hence, she should not be so petty..
