Chapter 843 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

Well, Finn could not feel pain at all, so how could he possibly understand how much pain other people were in?

Besides, even if he could feel it, there was no need for him to care about Monica.

It was already very kind of him to save her.

Although Monica was in so much pain that she was about to collapse, she still knew that Finn was trying to stop her bleeding.

He pressed hard on her wound to stop the bleeding.

A long time passed.

Finn relaxed his hand that was pressing on her wound, then he slowly raised his hand. He looked at the wound that he was pressing on and saw that there was no more blood coming out.

“Nox, give me an anesthetic using the smallest syringe,” Finn called out to Nox.

Nox hurriedly helped Finn prepare it and handed it to him.

Finn injected anesthetic into Monica’s wrist.

After a while, Monica did not seem to feel the pain from her wound.

If he had known that there was anesthetic, he should not have made her feel so much pain.

Monica complained internally.

She could not say a word in front of Finn.

Especially after she had calmed down, she could not say a word.

Finn said, “Your wound was opened, I’ll stitch it up. ”

It meant that the wound needed to be stitched up again.

Without Monica’s consent, he started to stitch her up.

It did not hurt anymore because of the anesthetic.

Finn was also very fast.

He was fast and good.

After he finished stitching, he applied medicine on Monica’s wound and then bandaged it.

Very quickly, Monica’s wrist was wrapped up again.

After wrapping it up, Finn turned around and tidied up his first aid kit. He disinfected and reassembled all the things he used before putting them back in their original positions for the convenience of next use.

“Thank you,” Monica said to Finn.

Finn did not say anything.

He took the first aid kit and walked away from her to put it in a place not far away.

Monica pursed her lips.

She felt that whatever she said seemed to be unnecessary.

“You committed suicide?” Nox’s voice was suddenly heard.

Monica’s body froze.

At that moment, she unconsciously glanced at Finn, who was not far away.

Finn should be able to hear Nox given the volume.

Monica quickly denied, “You’re thinking too much. I was just cooking on a whim the other day and accidentally cut myself.”

“You’re pretty accurate,” Nox mocked, obviously not believing her.

Monica did not want to explain further.

“You should’ve cut a little deeper. That way, the scourge won’t be able to live for 1,000 years,” Nox continued to mock her.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She could not refute it at all.

If she had cut a little harder, she might have really died.

She did not even dare to mention that she regretted it the moment she cut herself.

She still wanted some face.

“What’s wrong?” Of course, Nox did not believe that she got injured while cooking and started to find out the truth.

“Nothing.”

“Aren’t you getting married on the 15th of next month?” Nox purposely brought it up.

Monica’s eyes were fixed on Finn.

She watched him put down the first aid kit then stood up and went straight to the second floor.

Perhaps he just did not want to be under the same roof as her.

Monica turned back to Nox. “Don’t feed the money to the dogs. I’ll send you an invitation.”

“F*ck,” Nox blurted.

He thought Monica would say that there would be no wedding.

He felt like his feelings were cheated.

He even thought that perhaps Michael had pushed Monica too hard, so she chose to commit suicide.

‘F*ck.

Nox felt that it was Monica’s business, so why should he be so kind?

He stood up and left.

When he left, he did not forget to say, “Don’t come here for no reason. We don’t welcome you!”

Monica also did not expect Finn and Nox to be here.

If she had known, she might have said it over the phone.

Monica knew very well how much Finn hated her. She also knew how much Nox hated her.

She was not bored enough to torture herself like this.

Monica took a deep breath.

Since she was here and they had met, she had to finish her purpose for coming here today.

She turned to George.

Compared to those stinky men, George was much more pleasing to the eye.

When George saw Monica, he could not help but ask, “Godmother, is your wrist injured? ”

“It doesn’t matter.” Monica did not care.

‘Who was it that sounded like a pig being slaughtered just now?!’ George thought to himself.

“I came to find you today for something important.” Monica was full of excitement.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
