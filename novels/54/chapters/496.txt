Chapter 497: Father and Son “Reunited”

“However.” George changed the topic. “I can still consider what you just said.”

Edward raised his eyebrows.

“I don’t know whether my mother wants me to like you or not, but since she has told me that you’re my father, it means she wants me to acknowledge you. If I don’t, my mother won’t blame me, but she may feel uncomfortable about it. So, I can pretend to be good with you,” George said, “when my mother is around.”

He meant that Edward should not expect him to do so at other times.

Edward pursed her lips and fell silent for a while.

George did not seem to be a talkative person, but he looked at Edward and said, “Do you have anything else to say? If not, I’m going upstairs.”

“Do you like Kingsley very much?” Edward asked.

“I don’t.” George was straightforward in his answer.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

“But in comparison, I don’t like you even more.”

Those words made Edward exasperated.

“Do you have anything else to ask?” George looked a little impatient.

Edward looked at him and slowly said, “No.”

......

“In that case, I’m going upstairs.” With that, George stood up and left.

Edward lay on the sofa quietly for a while.

Teddy, on the other hand, could not hold it in any longer. He said, “Master, it’s not too difficult to bribe a child.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Edward glanced at Teddy and ignored him.

Teddy continued, “For the last few days you’ve had me take care of the Young Master, I’ve realized that he isn’t as difficult to get along with as he seems. He just doesn’t like to show it and makes others think he doesn’t like anything. All you need to do is spend more time with him and do things that he likes, he’ll like you over time.”

“What does he like?” Edward asked sincerely.

Teddy thought for a moment. “Writing code or something.”

Edward looked askance at Teddy, who quickly said, “I’ll try to find out his other preferences.”

Then, Edward put down his legs and stood up from the sofa.

Before he left, he said, “I’ll give you a month to improve my relationship with George. Otherwise... the mosquitoes in the courtyard haven’t had human blood for a long time...”

Teddy thought, ‘What a bully!’

With that, Edward went upstairs and pushed open the door, only to see Jeanne was not in the room.

In fact, it was obvious that Jeanne would be in George’s room at that moment.

She may have said that she wanted them to talk it out, but there was no way Jeanne would not care about George’s feelings. Hence, she must have gone to have a heart-to-heart talk with George, and that was indeed the case.

After Jeanne went upstairs, she waited for George in the room.

She left time for George to talk to Edward and time for her to have a good chat with George.

About that matter...

After all, it was her fault for hiding the matter about his father.

At that moment, Jeanne and George were each sitting on a single sofa in the room.

Jeanne said, “I didn’t mean to lie to you. I thought I wouldn’t cross paths with Edward anymore, so I didn’t want to disappoint you.”

“I know.” On the contrary, George understood.

Jeanne looked at George, who said, “Anyway, there will be a day when we have to leave, right? If we leave, won’t I still not have a father?”

Jeanne was stunned.

George said, “Are we not leaving anymore?”

“It’s not that. “Jeanne smiled.

It was just that sometimes, she felt a little uneasy or unwilling to leave.

She touched George’s head. “I hope you can live your life peacefully in the future.”

George frowned as his mother rarely said such things to him.

Jeanne was not overly emotional when she said, “We’ll just let nature take its course on many things.”

George nodded, and Jeanne smiled.

She said, “Remember to give Miles my things.”

She reminded George to give the stubble she got yesterday to Miles.

“Yes, he’ll come and send me to school on Monday.”

“Okay.” Jeanne believed in her son’s ability to do things.

After that, she left George’s room.

In fact, ever since he was young, George had been relatively indifferent about things and had been able to accept everything rationally. On the whole, unless it crossed his bottom line, he would not care too much. As for George’s bottom line, it was probably her.

She returned to Edward’s room, where Edward was lying on the bed waiting for her.

She did not know when it started, but it seemed like they spent the most time together… on the bed.

She looked at Edward while Edward looked at her.

Slowly, Edward patted the spot beside his bed, indicating for her to go over.
