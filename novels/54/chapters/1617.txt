“Is that so?” Shelly smiled. “I didn’t go to university.”

“Actually, university isn’t as wonderful as we thought it would be, ” Benjamin quickly said as he was very concerned about Shelly’s emotional changes. “By the way, how do you eat in the hospital?” Benjamin changed the topic.

“You can order food at the hospital.”

“Oh, I thought you wouldn’t be able to have a proper meal, so I thought I’d bring you food from my canteen.”

“Your canteen should be pretty far from here, right?”

“That’s true.” Benjamin smiled awkwardly. “I was just afraid that you wouldn’t be able to eat in the hospital alone.”

“No, I’m fine. Besides, I’m used to taking care of Bella alone after so many years.”

“Is it hard?” Benjamin suddenly asked, his face filled with concern.

“I’m used to it.” She did not say whether it was hard or not.

Benjamin could feel the distance between Shelly and him, so he said, “I have to say that back when we were in high school, we were a little insensible. Are you still angry?”

“No, I’m not.” Shelly shook her head.

What was there to be angry about? If she wanted to be angry, she should be angry at Nox. She had never been angry with Benjamin.

If she were in Benjamin’s shoes, she would have agreed to Nox too. After all, who could say no to money?

“Actually, I didn’t do it for money,” Benjamin said and then paused. “I’ve been wanting to explain it to you all these years, but I haven’t had the chance. After all, you didn’t go for the college entrance examination, and I lost contact with you.”

“There’s nothing much to say. I didn’t take it to heart.”

“I just wanted to tell you that I really liked you when I pursued you back then. I fought with you because I didn’t like to see the girl I liked with other men. I was jealous and couldn’t control myself from fighting with you.” Benjamin still told her everything.

Shelly did not know what to say.

“Later, because you found out, I didn’t know how to tell you what I was thinking. I was afraid that you would reject me or laugh at me. Now that I’ve finally said it out loud, I feel a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.” Benjamin took a deep breath.

“That’s good because I didn’t take it to heart.” Shelly could only speak her

thoughts calmly.

“Oh right, I just asked Nox if your daughter is his…”

“She’s not, ” Shelly denied.

“I know she’s not. I’m just saying that Nox told me to pursue you properly.” As Benjamin spoke, he even smiled. “After all these years, is your relationship with Nox still so bad?”

“Indeed, it hasn’t been good.” Shelly nodded. “But don’t listen to Nox. I’m not thinking about dating now, so don’t waste your time on me. If Nox says that he wants to give you money or something, I can cooperate with your act. Anyway, he’s rich but stupid. He’ll eventually be cheated of his money.”

Benjamin could not help but laugh. “You say Nox is stupid but rich, but he’s a remarkable businessman. I’m studying international economics now, and we’ve learned some of his business methods. He’s very impressive.”

“In that case, I guess he doesn’t know anything except making money,” Shelly said bluntly.

She did not think highly of Nox, and Benjamin did not refute her. He said, “Nox didn’t give me money to pursue you. Don’t misunderstand.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

“But I really want to pursue you,” Benjamin suddenly said.

Shelly was stunned. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ve never forgotten you. All these years, I’ve been restraining myself from looking for you. But when I saw you that night, I really couldn’t control myself, so I decided to come and see you.”

“As I said, I’m not thinking about dating right now. Besides, I have a child, so I’m not suitable for you.”

“As long as you don’t have a husband, we can raise the child together.” Benjamin said seriously, “I like children too.”

“You haven’t even stepped into society yet, so don’t tell me you want to raise a child with me.” Shelly rejected him seriously.

Benjamin was silent, probably because Shelly’s words hurt him a little.

He said, “It’s true that I don’t have the ability to earn money on my own yet, but

I’ll graduate from university next year. Then, I’ll be able to support my family.”

“Let’s wait until you can really support your family.” Shelly was downright rejecting Benjamin.

It was because she looked down on him, but because she knew very well that if she were to be with Benjamin in this situation, she would be harming him..
