Chapter 381: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

His eyes drooped stiffly as he looked at Monica, crying her heart out. They had been together for so many years, but he never seemed to have ever made her smile.

“Don’t fight back anymore. Please don’t,” Monica said quickly and anxiously.

She was really afraid that Finn would continue on like that, and if she did, he would die.

“Monica,” Finn called out to her.

The moment he called out to her, his body went limp, and he collapsed on her shoulder.

Monica lost her balance and almost fell because of Finn’s body. However, she tried her best to keep her balance.

She felt that Finn could not take the fall anymore, but how could he still stand up and fight?

She had never found Finn so terrifying. It was not that she was terrified of his ability but that he would die.

She was really afraid that he would die just like that.

She hugged him tightly in her arms until she heard him say in a voice that only they both could hear, “When you get the chance, run.”

Monica’s body tensed up.

She thought Finn’s body went limp because he had given up completely, but unexpectedly, it was just Finn’s scheme — a scheme to avoid being noticed.

“I’ve observed this warehouse. It isn’t locked, and they can’t lock it from the outside.”

......

Monica thought to herself, ‘Don’t say anymore. I beg you, don’t.’

“No matter what happens later, don’t turn back and keep running forward. Don’t call the police when you’re safe. Instead, go straight to Fourth Master Swan’s place and wait for him to come back...”

Finn’s voice was very soft. Even she could barely hear him clearly.

He was so weak, yet he was still telling her how to escape and save herself.

Her tears fell, and they kept streaming down her face.

She really could not control herself, for she had never been so sad in her entire life.

Even when she saw Finn cheating on him and Patsy naked on his bed, it did not feel as painful as she did now. She even felt like she should not be living in this world and that she should not be alive after suffering so much.

She clutched onto Finn’s clothes tightly even until her clothes were drenched in blood. She refused to let go.

The bearded man waited for a while, looking at the two of them hugging each other.

Rather than sympathizing with them, he thought that since the man was about to die, it would be a good deed to let them spend a minute or two together.

However, he was still a part of a mercenary organization. He was paid to do things, and he never involved any feelings in his work.

He said, “Woman, I’ll give you three seconds to let him go! Otherwise, don’t blame me for hurting you!”

Monica’s body tensed up.

Then, she heard the man’s cold-blooded voice, “Three, two...”

“Remember,” Finn reminded her.

The next second, following the bearded man “one”, Finn suddenly got up with astonishing strength and pushed Monica away.

Monica was so caught off guard that she fell to the ground.

At the same time, Finn launched a fierce attack on the bearded man.

The bearded man still did not expect that Finn would be able to unleash his strength to such an extent and fight so well.

Finn’s kick sent him falling to the ground. He even blanked out for a second before dodging to the side. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn was kicking at him fiercely, and his strength was truly astonishing.

The bearded man even believed that if he had not reacted in time, Finn would probably have killed him.

With that, his expression turned cold. Instead of holding back, he started fighting with Finn.

At that moment, Finn fought with the man in front of him as if he could not care less about his life anymore.

Finn was actually getting beaten up badly, but he did not feel any pain.

Other than feeling physically exhausted and that his body was truly dead, he could not stop fighting.

He had to keep going until he defeated the man.

Michael was also surprised when he saw the scene.

He had, in fact, always been hostile toward Finn.

Even if he restrained himself, the man still bothered him.

At first, he only treated Finn as an orphan and a man who was medically talented. However, in the end, he realized that he could never compare himself to Finn. No matter how hard Finn worked throughout his life, Finn would never be able to achieve half of what he had. Therefore, even though he was unhappy with Finn’s existence, he could still maintain an indifferent attitude toward him. He felt that the man posed no threat to him and that Finn was nothing compared to him.
