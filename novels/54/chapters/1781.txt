Chapter 1782: The Drastic Change in Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She always felt that Nox was not meticulous enough in cleaning up. However, when she walked over and saw the clean and tidy kitchen, she was stunned. When did Nox become so capable? He knew nothing about housework, did he not?

She turned to look at Nox, who had walked to the laundry room, and could not help but follow. Nox took out the clothes he had washed from the dryer one by one. She even saw her underwear. For some reason, she felt a little awkward.

She could not help but ask, “Nox, what’s wrong?

Nox was stunned. He turned to look at Shelly with a baffled expression, which made Shelly feel even more awkward. She said, “Why are you suddenly doing all this?”

“On a whim.”

No one would do housework on a whim. Did he not play video games in his free time?

“Oh.” Shelly did not know how to answer him.

In any case, she would take it that he suddenly went crazy and that his sudden impulse would only last for a day at most.

She watched as Nox took out the clothes and put them back into the closet. Then, he started to clean the house, and it made Shelly feel like Nox was possessed. Otherwise, how could a person change so much?

While she watched Nox busy himself, Nox was actually getting a little impatient. After all, he did not like housework. However, because Shelly’s eyes were all on him now, he was glad he did the work. Normally, Shelly would not look at him, let alone make eye contact with him.

After a while of watching Nox, Shelly suddenly returned to her room, and Nox watched as Shelly left. Ultimately, Shelly’s patience with him was limited.

Shelly returned to her room, changed her clothes, and prepared to go out. Bella would end school early in the afternoon, so she had to pass the phone to Sarah earlier. Otherwise, she would be late to pick Bella up.

Once she got changed and was about to go out, she looked at herself in the mirror. She would not know if she did not look, but she was shocked by what she saw. It was because she looked very pale, especially her lips. If she walked out, people might think that she was malnourished.

Shelly pondered for a while and looked at the time before starting to put on some makeup at the dressing cabinet. It was rare for her to put on a full face of makeup, but her complexion was horrible. Besides, she had to pick up Bella later, and she could not embarrass Bella.

She fiddled with the makeup for a while. After making sure that the person in the mirror no longer looked weak and was even a little too good -looking, she got up and walked out of the bedroom.

At that time, Nox happened to have completed all the housework at home and was leaning back on the sofa, looking a little tired. When he saw Shelly walk out of the room, he could spot the difference.

He rarely saw Shelly put on makeup, and even if she did, it would be extremely light makeup. However, she looked extra gorgeous today. He had to admit that it suited Shelly very well. Especially with Shelly’s beautiful post-plastic surgery face, a little embellishment would make her look stunning. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Today, she looked very good. Even though it was not for him but for the person she liked, he was not sad about it. At the end of the day, he had prepared himself for it.

Shelly walked straight to the door. “I need to go out to sort something out for a while.”

“Do you need me to go pick Bella up?”

“No need.” Shelly shook her head. “I’ll go pick her up later.” “Okay,” Nox replied. “Will you be back for dinner tonight?”

“Yes,” Shelly replied.

She would come back after picking Bella up and did not plan to stay out for dinner.

“In that case, I’ll wait for you.”

“Alright,” Shelly responded faintly.

Nox even wondered whether Shelly heard what he was saying and whether her reply was just perfunctory.

When the door was closed, Nox leaned against the sofa and stared blankly into space. In the future, he would have to get used to seeing Shelly with another man.

Shelly took a taxi to the nightclub to get Sarah’s phone before heading to Sarah’s apartment.

She knocked on the door, and it was Brandon who opened the door. Shelly felt a little awkward. After all, it was a little unexpected for a man to open the door.

Brandon asked, “Are you looking for Sarah?”

“Oh, yeah.” Shelly nodded. “She left her phone at the nightclub, and no one can contact her, so I brought it to her..”
