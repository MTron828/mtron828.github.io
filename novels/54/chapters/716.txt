Chapter 717: Edward, I’ve Missed You So Much

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne returned to the meeting room to continue chairing the meeting after Greg Norton’s incident.

Eden only returned to the conference room after a long time. Even though he had disguised himself very well, his pale face was visible, and he kept silent throughout the entire meeting.

After Jeanne deligated the work matters regarding the retail agents, she returned to her office without saying another word.

In the end, her expression changed.

Amy brought her a cup of black coffee. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jeanne took a sip and slowly regulated her emotions.

Meanwhile, Amy reported, “News of Greg Norton coming to Lawrence Enterprise to cause trouble today and you desperately saving him are trending on the internet. Now, everyone is siding with Lawrence Enterprise. They think the agent’s actions were too extreme, harming others and themselves.”

Jeanne nodded.

“But President Lawrence, you were really amazing just now,” Amy said sincerely as she recalled the scene on the rooftop.

Jeanne pursed her lips. In fact, she was still a little scared after the incident. If she really did fall down with Greg, Eden’s wish would really be fulfilled.

Sometimes, she was too impulsive. It was not worth risking her life for some unnecessary people.

Then, she looked at her ringing phone.

She told Amy, “Announce Lawrence Enterprise’s development plan for our retail agents. While it’s trending, we should promote our offline service experience to attract people to the stores. At the same time, we’ll take revenge on Rick and Greg for framing me. We’ll do it in my name and Lawrence Enterprise company’s name. We must get to the bottom of it!”

“Yes,” Amy said respectfully.

“You can go out now.”

“Yes.”

Only once Amy left did Jeanne pick up the phone.

Kingsley’s eyes on her were everywhere, and she would receive a lecture for what she did today from Kingsley.

“Can’t you learn to protect yourself?” The other side’s tone was very cold.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“If Fourth Master Swan showed up a little later, wouldn’t you have lost your life for an insignificant person?”

“Is my life important?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows and retorted.

“What do you think?”

“Aren’t the lives of all assassins the same?” Jeanne mocked.

“Jeanne!” Kingsley was angered. “Are you blaming me for something?”

“No.”

“Are you still brooding over Lucy’s death?”

“No.”

“Lucy is only one of the Hills’ assassins, whereas you’re the heir of the Hills. Do you think I should treat you and her equally?”

Jeanne gripped her phone tightly and did not reply.

She did indeed care about Kingsley’s attitude toward Lucy, but Kingsley was right.

“I can even tell you very clearly that Lucy is dead, and that’s all. I didn’t tell you Lucy was killed by Fourth Master Swan for you to take revenge or make you hold grudges against Fourth Master Swan. I told you the truth just so you know the existence of the Duncans’ descendant!” Kingsley said word by word. His tone was cold to the bone.

Jeanne bit her lips tightly.

In fact, she knew that when an assassin died, no one would take revenge for their death.

“I remind you again to adjust your state of mind and find the Duncans’ descendant, who is by Fourth Master Swan’s side!”

As soon as he said that, the call ended.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She was emotional about Lucy’s death. After all, she did not grow up in the Hills, so she did not know how cold-blooded and ruthless Kingsley was. She could not be indifferent to people important to her, so it was impossible for her to become the heir of the Hills.

She had never thought about it as everything she did now was just for revenge.

Then, a knock sounded on the door.

Jeanne pursed her lips, forcing herself to recover to her normal self in an instant.

She said, “Come in.”

It was Mason who pushed the door open and entered.

Mason did not attend the senior management meeting nor showed up at work.

He sent a message to Jeanne early in the morning, saying that Kingsley had arranged work for him and that he would return only after he had finished dealing with it.

He walked toward Jeanne and sized her up quietly.

Jeanne said bluntly, “If you have something to say, just say it.”

“You almost fell off the roof just now, huh?” Mason asked. When he asked, there was a trace of killing intent in his eyes.

“It didn’t happen. There is no need to beat yourself up over it.” Jeanne did not want to say too much.
