Chapter 1474: Shelly and Nox Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s not yours anyway.” Shelly enunciated each word.

Nox looked at Shelly coldly.

Shelly did not want to waste her breath on Nox, so she turned around and left.

She was not feeling well now, and if she continued to argue with Nox, she was afraid that she would faint. However, she had only taken two steps when someone suddenly grabbed her arm.

Shelly was on the verge of a breakdown. Just how annoying was a person to make someone have the urge to kill him? Therefore, the moment Nox pulled her back, Shelly used all her strength to push Nox.

Behind Nox was a busy road. What he did not realize was that the moment Shelly pushed him onto the road, a car was coming toward him. However, the car suddenly braked and almost killed Nox.

Nox’s face turned red from anger. How vicious was Shelly to do that?

The driver in the car was also shocked, and he shouted at Nox, “Watch where you’re going!”

Nox’s expression was extremely ugly. However, Shelly looked on coldly before turning around and leaving.

Seeing that, Nox was so angry that he almost fainted. He quickly walked toward Shelly, who could feel that Nox was about to burst out in anger.

Just as she was prepared to be beaten up by Nox, the moment Nox really got close to her, her vision went black, and she fainted.

She did not know whether she had fainted because her body was too weak or because she was scared out of his wits. In any case, she fainted, and she was glad that she collapsed at the critical moment.

In a daze, she thought she saw Nox’s panicked expression, but it was probably an illusion. After all, Nox had never been so kind to her, so he would not care whether she was dead or alive.

When Shelly opened her eyes, she saw an unfamiliar ceiling, and it took her two seconds to react.

She had fainted in front of Nox, so Nox should have been the one to send her to the hospital. It meant that she was in a hospital.

She then looked around to see that Nox was not in the ward, but there was only a nurse standing guard at the side.

Seeing that she had woken up, the nurse quickly went forward. “Miss, your fever was at 40 degrees. Fortunately, you were sent to the hospital. Otherwise…

Otherwise what? Humans did not seem to die so easily.

Shelly forced a smile and said, “Can you call the doctor for me? I want to ask when I can be discharged.”

“Alright.” The nurse quickly agreed.

Shelly looked at the IV drip in her hand. She did not know how long she had been unconscious. Or rather than saying she was unconscious, she was actually sound asleep because she could feel that she had gotten a good rest and felt much better than before.

Just then, the door of the ward was pushed open. Shelly was initially relaxed, but her expression changed the moment she saw Nox.

Why was he still here? She even thought that Nox would not send her to the hospital and that perhaps some passerby had sent her here. In her mind, Nox was horrible to her.

The doctor came in with Nox. Then, the doctor began to take her temperature.

“The fever has subsided a little, but it’s still at 39 degrees. I suggest that you stay in the hospital for further observation. After this bag of IV transfusion, we’ll take a look at your situation again. If the fever doesn’t subside, I would recommend you to stay in the hospital for two days,” the doctor suggested.

Shelly would never agree to such a suggestion. After all, Bella was still at home, and she had to pick Bella up after school in the afternoon.

She casually picked up her phone and glanced at it. Fortunately, it was still early, and she could even stay in the hospital for a few more hours. “Remember to stay hydrated,” the doctor reminded her.

“Okay. Thank you, doctor.” Shelly smiled politely.

“I’m going to prescribe some fever medicine for you and get the nurse to bring it over. Call me if you feel worse.” The doctor was very polite to Shelly.

Shelly smiled gratefully, while the doctor reported the situation to Nox before he left the ward.

In the ward, Nox did not leave. He just sat beside Shelly’s bed, which made her uncomfortable. If not for the fact that she was still on an IV drip, she would have gotten up and left. However, she just endured it.

She did not speak or show any expression. She did not even look at Nox. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Why didn’t you tell me you were having such a bad fever?” Nox suddenly asked.

His tone was unusually calm.

“Would you have let me go if I told you?” Shelly raised her eyebrows.

Nox’s face darkened and he said coldly, “Let you go? Are you going to let me go or am I going to let you go? Shelly, you’ve been scheming against me all along, and now you’re complaining about me first? You almost pushed me onto the road and killed me just now.. How dare you have the nerve to say I won’t let you go?”
