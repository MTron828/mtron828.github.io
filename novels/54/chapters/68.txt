Chapter 69: Who’s Cheating on Who?!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the door, Mubier was hugging Jeanne.

George was unhappy.

Jeanne was also unhappy.

She twisted her body. “Let go.”

Mubier did not let go. He hugged her even tighter. “It’s been so long. Don’t you miss me?”

“I don’t.”

“But I miss you to death.” Mubier seemed to have long gotten used to Jeanne’s indifference and did not care at all.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly.

George also took two steps back with great tacit understanding.

The next second, Jeanne did a clean shoulder throw, and Mubier suddenly fell to the ground. A violent sound filled the entire corridor.

“Ah!” Mubier shouted, “Are you murdering your husband?!”

Jeanne was unmoved.

She tidied her clothes slightly and completely ignored Mubier, who was on the ground, preparing to lead George in.

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re so strong.” A familiar male voice came from not far away.

Jeanne suddenly turned her head.

She did not know when Fourth Master Swan had appeared at the end of the corridor. Nox followed beside him.

At this moment, Fourth Master Swan brought Nox and walked toward her step by step.

Edward stopped at a very close distance. Then, he looked down at Jeanne from above.

“Fourth Master, why are you here?” Jeanne forced herself to smile.

“I’m just passing by,” Fourth Master Swan said.

After saying that, he walked past her with Nox.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

Mubier got up from the ground with difficulty and looked at the two figures who had left. “Who’s that person? He’s so arrogant.”

“Fourth Master Swan of South Hampton City.”

“F*ck!” Mubier swore. “The wretched man who harassed you?!”

“...” Jeanne turned to look at Mubier.

“Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.” Mubier was serious.

Jeanne smiled.

She beckoned for George to enter the hotel suite.

At this moment, Nox followed beside Edward and could not help but say, “I’m afraid that Ms. Lawrence is really not simple.”

Edward was expressionless.

“Do you want me to investigate her thoroughly?” Nox asked.

“No need.”

“Fourth Master Swan...”

“Jeanne is Jeanne. She has nothing to look into,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Nox pursed his lips.

He turned his head to look at Edward.

In the past, he was worried that this man would not fall in love. Now, he was worried that this man had fallen too deeply in love!

…

In the hotel, in the presidential suite.

Jeanne was chatting with West and Mubier.

She said, “I’m going to work at the Lawrence Enterprise tomorrow.”

“What do you need me to do?” West asked.

“Alexander asked me to work at the company. His motive is very simple. He wants the Lawrence Enterprise and MUK to work together.”

“Before I came here, I also investigated the Lawrence Enterprise. It’s not an excellent company,” West said bluntly.

Jeanne nodded.

She also knew the current situation of the Lawrence Enterprise.

Even if Alexander died, the Lawrence Enterprise would most likely face bankruptcy.

“However, the Lawrence Enterprise will be different with you around.” West smiled.

Jeanne also smiled.

West said, “My trip to South Hampton city was arranged by you and Kingsley. I’ll do whatever you want me to do.”

“Thank you,” Jeanne said sincerely.

“You’re welcome.” West smiled. “If it weren’t for Kingsley, I wouldn’t be where I am today.”

Jeanne still admired Kingsley sometimes.

After all, a person with a strong sense of purpose might not be very smart, but he could make many people feel that he was a good person!

Sometimes, Jeanne even felt that he was a good person.

Jeanne and West had been discussing the specific cooperation between MUK and the Lawrence Enterprise in the hotel.

It was not until a little late in the afternoon that Jeanne left with George.

When they left, Mubier insisted on seeing them off, but Jeanne refused.

Mubier looked at them with a face full of reluctance.

Jeanne was unmoved.

She held George’s hand and walked into the elevator.

When she walked in, she halted again.

She really felt that Fourth Master Swan was haunting her.

Fourth Master Swan looked at her very coldly.

On the contrary, Nox, who was beside him, smiled meaningfully.

“What a coincidence,” Nox took the initiative to speak.

Jeanne smiled.

“Ms. Lawrence, have you eaten dinner?” Nox asked.

“Tomorrow, George will go to school. I need to go back early to help him prepare.” What Jeanne meant was that they would not have dinner together.

“Oh.” Nox nodded and did not say anything else.

The elevator arrived.

Jeanne held George’s hand and prepared to leave. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“When will you be free, Ms. Lawrence?” Behind her, Fourth Master Swan suddenly asked.

Jeanne turned around. “I’ve been very busy.”

“Is that so?”

“Yes.” Jeanne smiled slightly and left with George.

Edward watched her leave.

Nox also looked at her.

Her figure in that dress was really moving.

‘No wonder Fourth Master Swan can’t forget her even after such a long time!’

…

Jeanne brought George back to the Lawrence family’s home.

Just as they reached the door, Jeanne received a call from Monica.

“Jeannie, what are you doing?” Monica’s deliberately fawning voice came from the other side.

“What’s the matter?” Jeanne was alert.

“Are you free for dinner tonight?”

“George is going to school tomorrow, and I’m going to work at the Lawrence Enterprise tomorrow too. I have a lot of things to prepare.”

“You’re going to work at the Lawrence Enterprise? Your dad will let you?” Monica was excited.

“Yes.”

“Really? Has your dad changed?”

It was not that he changed his personality; it was that he was forced to do so.

Alexander wanted Jeanne to win the collaboration with MUK, so he had no choice but to entrust her with a heavy responsibility. Once she let the Lawrences regain their glory, she would immediately lose everything!

“Then let’s have a meal together to help you celebrate.”

“There’s no need to celebrate.” There was nothing to celebrate.

“Jeannie, can’t you come out and accompany me? I’m in a bad mood.” Monica played the bitter card.

“What’s the matter?”

“Finn’s old lover came. I’m feeling suffocated.” Monica gritted her teeth.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

“I don’t want to go back and look at those two, so come out and accompany me.”

“Send me the location. I’ll go there in a while.”

“I know you’re the best.” Monica hung up the phone excitedly.

The moment she hung up the phone, she still felt a little guilty.

After all…

She picked up the phone and made another call.

The person who answered the call was Nox.

“Done. Send me the address,” Monica said.

“Not bad,” Nox praised.

“Of course, it’s me.” Monica was proud.

“Should I call Finn?” Nox asked.

“You’re not allowed to call him!” Monica was agitated. “If you dare to call him, I won’t let Jeannie come.”

“Did the two of you quarrel again?”

“What quarrel? How can I quarrel with him?!” Monica scoffed. “I simply don’t want to see him.”

“Didn’t you love him crazily back then?” Nox was speechless.

“Didn’t I fall in love with Michael after that?”

“F*ck! Are you cheating on Finn?” Nox was agitated.

Monica rolled her eyes.

‘Who’s cheating on who?!

‘I’m the one being cuckolded now!’
