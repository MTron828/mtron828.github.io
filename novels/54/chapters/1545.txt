Chapter 1546: Jeanne Tells Monica Her Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was as if she was not pregnant.

“You have to be careful with twins.”

“Yes,” Monica replied, seemingly not wanting to get too friendly with Candice. Then, she asked, “Why did you ask me out today?”

Jeanne was about to speak.

“Don’t talk about my relationship with Finn. I know how to handle that,” Monica said straightforwardly.

Finn had told Candice so many things. Perhaps it was Finn who had asked that woman to persuade her. After all, Finn could even make use of Paige, let alone others.

“I won’t say much about you and him. Anyway, you’ll get back together one day.”

“I won’t!” Monica said firmly, “I’ve already given up on Finn. There’s no way I’ll get back together with him. A cold man like him is suited to grow old alone.” Jeanne could not help but laugh. “Isn’t he changing?

“You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.” Monica gritted her teeth. “After a while, Finn will go back to his old self. When I think of all the grievances I’ve suffered from him all these years, I wish I could kill myself. How blind was I to fall for him back then?”

“Finn resigned from his job as a doctor for you,” Jeanne reminded.

“Who knows if he’s tired of being a doctor?”

“He learned cooking for you.”

“Who knows if he’s tired of eating his own cooking?”

“Monica, is it so difficult for you to admit that Finn has changed?” Jeanne asked.

“Of course, it’s not difficult for you. You haven’t experienced any emotional setbacks! When it comes to your relationship with Fourth Master Swan, the people before you have already paved the way for your relationship, and what you’re getting now is the best of Fourth Master Swan. That is why you can think so highly of yourself and give others advice! However, you have no idea that sometimes, the damage caused by relationships can really living so unbearable!” Monica was a little agitated.

She did not know whether it was because she did not want Candice to give her advice or whether she did not like it when others tried to persuade her about Finn. Perhaps, it could also be because she thought of Jeanne’s relationship with Fourth Master Swan and how Candice was the one who reaped all the benefits in the end.

It was something that she could not get over, and it would probably become a thorn in her throat that she could not pull out no matter what. Jeanne’s death would haunt her for the rest of her life.

Suddenly, silence filled the private room. Monica also felt that she was too agitated just now. However, she had never thought of apologizing. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She immediately picked up her bag and was about to leave when she said, ‘We can’t be friends. I like your personality, but because of Jeanne, I really can’t convince myself to be friends with you. Of course, I don’t think it’s wrong for you to be with Fourth Master Swan. No one can explain the matters of the heart. But now that you’re with the Fourth Master Swan, you should stay with him. I won’t blame you, but I won’t give you my blessings either. So… that’s it.”

Monica thought it was best to make things clear so that she would not be led by the nose by that woman. Every time she had a deep conversation with the woman, she would feel guilty when she went back, feeling like she had let Jeanne down.

How could she say so much to Fourth Master Swan’s wife? How could she accept Fourth Master Swan’s wife? She should keep an absolute distance from her.

With that thought in mind, Monica’s footsteps were firm.

Just as she opened the door of the private room and was about to leave, she heard Jeanne ask from behind her, “In your heart, is Jeanne such a petty person?”

Monica pursed her lips. Her hand was still on the doorknob, but she did not turn it.

“Will Jeanne be jealous or even angry that you’re making new friends?”

“She won’t.” Monica said firmly, “But I will get angry because I made a new friend, one that I shouldn’t have. My only friend in this world is Jeanne. Even if she dies, no one can stop her from being my friend.”

Jeanne smiled, and her eyes were red. Ever since he was young, Monica had always relied on her, but she never thought that she was so important to Monica.

As she watched Monica open the door angrily, she said with a smile, “I’m
