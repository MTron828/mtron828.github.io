Chapter 1412: The Failed Birthday Surprise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thank you readers!

Candice said, “Alright.”

Nox was so surprised for a second that he turned to look at Candice. “Do you drink a lot?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I can’t.” Candice replied, “Monica got me drunk that day.”

Nox looked at Monica again.

“I was born with it. I can’t help it.” Monica was calm and composed.

“Show off.” Nox was speechless. Then, he turned to Edward. “Your wife has agreed. You won’t be a spoiled sport, will you?” “Let’s drink.” Edward agreed immediately.

Nox was still jealous.

To think that he had been with Edward for so many years, accompanying him wholeheartedly and doing his best for him until the day he died. However, every time he wanted to drink with Edward, he would always refuse. Yet, all it took was his wife to say “okay”, and he f*cking agreed.

It was infuriating to see Edward valuing his wife over his friends!

Fortunately, Finn did not care. In fact, he was a little excited.

He raised his glass. “Firstly, happy birthday to George.”

Everyone raised their glasses, whereas Monica picked up the teacup beside her.

Nox caught it immediately. “Monica, what’s that?!”

“I can’t drink for the next two days,” Monica said bluntly. “Are you trying to ruin my mood?” Nox was displeased.

“Yes, I am.” Monica did not hide it.

Nox was exasperated.

“Let’s drink.” Finn deliberately changed the topic, obviously trying to protect Monica.

Nox glanced at Finn unhappily. He did not know why Finn was helping Monica when she dumped him.

“Let’s drink,” Candice echoed.

She knew that Monica would never refuse alcohol, but since she did, it meant that she definitely could not drink.

Nox did not want to ruin his good mood because of Monica, so he started drinking with the others.

At the dining table, the atmosphere was lively because Nox was there, and they drank a lot.

“Are you alright?” Candice asked Edward worriedly.

She had never seen him drink so much.

“He can hold his liquor very well.” Nox quickly said, “He won’t get drunk.”

Candice did not believe Nox, so she whispered, “Drink less.”

“Alright. ”

“Hey, what are you two muttering about? Who do you think we are, acting all lovey-dovey in front of us? I may have a fiancée, but there are two single people at the table. Can you be mindful of them?” Nox complained.

Finn and Monica were speechless. Although the two of them had broken up, Nox was talking about them non-stop the entire night.

Monica stood up. “I’m going to the washroom.”

Anyway, she was not drinking, and it was boring to watch them drink.

“See, you’re chasing them away,” Nox said seriously.

Candice could not help but laugh at how funny Nox was.

“Why are you laughing?” Nox looked at Candice. “You should be drinking to express your apology.”

“Alright.” Candice raised her wine glass. “Here’s to you.”

“Why are you asking me to drink?”

“Because you’re handsome.”

“Although I know you don’t mean it…” Nox smiled proudly. “I can’t deny that I’m quite handsome.”

Everyone was amused by Nox. It was true that there was laughter wherever Nox was.

In the washroom, Monica could hear the laughter from afar. She had just thrown up and was touching up her makeup.

She looked at how weak she looked. Her reactions over the past two days had made it obvious what it was. She wanted to ignore them, but it was impossible to ignore them.

She bit her lip. The pregnancy test kit that she had placed in her bag had not been used. She did not even know what she should do if…

She took a deep breath, opened the bathroom door, and walked out. As soon as she walked out, she saw Zoe.

When Zoe saw Monica, she greeted her warmly, “Monica.”

Monica nodded, but the moment the two of them brushed past each other, Monica suddenly called out to her, “Zoe.”

“Hmm?” The smile on Zoe’s face was very natural, and there was nothing unusual about it.

“Although Nox isn’t a good man, he has calmed down,” Monica said bluntly.

Zoe knew what she was talking about, but she pretended to be dumb and said with a smile, “I know. That’s why I like him so much.”

“I hope what you say is true.” Monica left Zoe with that sentence and walked away.

From then on, she would stop meddling in Nox and Zoe’s relationship. After all, it was their relationship..
