Chapter 313: Edward Agrees to Get Married

“I know it’s my fault that I didn’t educate Joshua well, but Joshua is the Lawrences’ only son. I can’t just abandon him, can I? What’s more, if the Lawrence Enterprise really falls into Jeanne’s hands, do you think we can still have a good life? With Jeanne’s current attitude toward us, we would be kicked out of the family!”

“She doesn’t have the ability to do that yet!” Alexander was furious.

His tone was very heavy.

Jenifer quickly softened her stance, “I’m just worried, that’s all. Please don’t get angry. It’s not good for your health. If you don’t calm down, I won’t say it next time, lest I make you unhappy.”

“Don’t worry. No matter how capable Jeanne is, it’s impossible for her to obtain the Lawrences’ assets.” Alexander was very certain.

However, Jenifer was still worried.

After all, the Lawrences’ assets were not in Alexander’s possession but Old Master Lawrence’s.

Moreover, Jeanne already had 10 percent of the Lawrences’ shares.

If that went on, who knew what would happen?

“Jeanne doesn’t have the right to inherit the Lawrences’ assets!” After Alexander said those words, he immediately stood up and left.

He did not seem to be in the mood to talk nonsense with Jenifer.

Jenifer stared at Alexander’s back.

What did he mean by not having the right?

......

No matter how smart he was, he could not understand it at that moment!

However, at least now she knew how Alexander saw it.

That way, she would be able to relax a little.

The most important thing now was to make Jeanne lose her reputation again and get kicked out of the family!

That woman was really not an easy one to deal with!

..

At the Swans, in the Bamboo Garden.

Nox talked for at least an hour.

For an hour, he tried to persuade Edward to think twice before acting and kept insisting that Jeanne had ulterior motives until his mouth was dry from all the talking.

However, that man remained indifferent as he stared at his phone screen.

Nox took a look, only to see all kinds of wedding photos on the screen.

The guy had already started... planning on taking wedding photos.

No.

He was already planning when he would get married.

Then, he suddenly put down his phone.

Startled, Nox asked, “Have you thought it through?”

“I have.” Edward stood up from the sofa.

Nox stood up as well. “It’s good that you have thought it through. If you have, don’t bother with that woman, Jeanne...”

“It’s time I visit the old master.”

“Why?” Nox was still traumatized by Old Master Swan.

At the thought of the wound on his back, he began to feel the pain again.

“To tell him about the marriage between Jeanne and me.”

“...”

There was no hope.

Fourth Master Swan was completely hopeless.

One day, he would die at the hands of Jeanne.

With that, Edward brought Nox with him and walked into Universe Garden.

It was already night time, so the courtyard was very quiet.

The first person Fourth Master Swan saw was Wade.

Nox did not even look at his grandfather.

When he recalled how he was beaten up a few days ago, he felt all sorts of emotions.

Wade also ignored his grandson. He looked at Edward and asked, “What can I do for you, Fourth Master Swan? ”

“I’m looking for my father.”

“He just had dinner and should be resting in the tea room.”

Edward nodded.

He walked past Wade and entered the house.

However, Nox did not follow him.

He had a feeling that it was a war between father and son, and he did not want to be implicated as an innocent.

Therefore, he just stood in the main hall with his grandfather.

“Don’t you feel guilty to see me?” Nox questioned.

Wade glanced at his grandson. “You’re lucky you didn’t die.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’m not your biological grandson, am I?”

“I picked you up,” Wade said bluntly.

Nox almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

“So you do have some self-awareness to realize that you’re not the eldest young master of the Winters.”

The old man was very evil.

Nox would be dumb to believe him.

“By the way.” Wade suddenly thought of something. “The child bride that your father found for you...”

“Don’t talk about the child bride, okay? I said I don’t like her!” Nox was irritated.

“I didn’t say you have to like her. I just want you to carry on the family line,” Wade said straightforwardly.

“So I’m not f*cking worthy of love?” Nox burst out.

He was also very disrespectful to his grandfather.

Wade laughed, and at that moment, he even glanced at Nox’s crotch.

Nox shuddered at his grandfather’s laughter. “What are you looking at?”

“The child bride is 18 years old. Get the ceremony done as soon as possible and give birth to a child.” It was rare for Wade to expose Nox, and he directly gave an order. “I’ll tell your parents about your marriage later.”
