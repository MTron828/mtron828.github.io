Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“But it looks like Sarah is reluctant to go with him.”

“If she were, she wouldn’t have just clamored for Brandon to let go of her instead of hugging Brandon’s neck tightly.” Benjamin smiled. “This is a classic case of saying not saying what she means.

Although she says no, her body says yes.”

Shelly smiled when she heard Benjamin’s words. Moreover, from the looks of it, Sarah really did seem to be like that.

Hence, she no longer cared about Sarah and turned to Benjamin. “It’s getting late. I’ll go back first.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Do you need me to drive you home? You look drunk to me.”

“I’m fine. I’m just a little dizzy, but I’m still conscious. I won’t have a problem going back”

“Alright.” Benjamin nodded, trying to maintain a safe distance between them like a gentleman and not cross the line.

Shelly smiled at Benjamin before walking into one of the cars parked by the roadside. The driver glanced at Shelly and confirmed that it was her before driving away.

When she was leaving, Shelly could not help but look back at Benjamin and saw him standing behind her, looking in the direction of her car. Then, she turned around, feeling a little bitter. If they had not encountered so many things, they would be…

Shelly stopped thinking about it. No matter how much she thought about it, it was all in the past. The next time they met again, they would just look at each other and smile.

The car soon arrived at Nox?s high-class apartment, and Shelly staggered back. She thought she was not too drunk, but her footsteps were light. Everything in front of her became even more blurry, and she felt dizzy. At that moment, the only thought in her mind was to get home as soon as possible so that she could lie on the bed.

She persevered and walked home, where the lights were on so that she would not bump into anything. She pushed open the bedroom door, trying not to make any noise since she thought was probably asleep, she tried to not make any noise. However, it was really hard to control herself when she was drunk.

She rushed into the bathroom and threw up into the toilet bowl. Only after throwing up for a long time did she finally feel better. However, her body was so weak that she did not want to move at all.

In her mind, she kept telling herself that she would take a shower after lying down for a while. After the shower, she would go back to bed and sleep. Then, she would be fine the next day. However, everything was just a thought in her brain, and she did not move.

Nox walked into the bathroom and saw Shelly sitting on the floor, drunk and with her face flushed red. In his memory, it was the first time he had seen Shelly drunk, and it made him wonder how much Shelly had let herself go in the class reunion.

Nevertheless, he squatted down and picked Shelly up from the ground. Drunk Shelly appeared unusually docile. Just like that, she fell into his arms obediently, and he was even a little reluctant to let her go.

In the end, he placed her on the bed, took off her clothes for her, and used a hot towel to wipe her clean. After that, he found her a clean set of pajamas to change into. The entire process was a blur to Shelly, so she allowed Nox to do everything for her.

After Nox had settled Shelly, he lay on the bed and leaned over to hug her. Although there was still the smell of alcohol on her body, he did not mind. On the contrary, he found her more down-to-earth. Sometimes, Shelly would distance herself from him, and it always made him feel that they were worlds apart.

He hugged her and could not resist lowering his head to kiss her lips. However, he did not want to disturb Shelly’s sleep. He knew very well that drunk people needed to rely on sleep to ease the discomfort of being drunk Therefore, he only kissed her lightly.

The moment he was about to lie down and sleep again, he heard Shelly’s voice. It was very soft, but he could hear it clearly in the quiet night. She called out, “Benjamin..”
