Chapter 650: News Flash: Next Time, I Will Kill You!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Once she had helped Michael, she could be together with Finn again.

She had never thought that her separation from Finn would have such an external impact on Finn.

“Why did Dr. Jones hit Michael?” Jeanne suddenly changed the topic.

She wanted to know the reason behind it, and only then would she know what to do next.

Then, Monica told her what happened when Finn hit Michael.

After Jeanne heard it, she said without hiding it, “Monica, I think Michael is manipulative.”

Monica was stunned. “What?”

“Michael knows you and Dr. Jones are in a conflict now, yet he still made an appointment to meet Dr. Jones. The reason is obviously not to explain himself but to show off. He’s even demonstrating to Dr. Jones that you’re his.”

“No, Michael isn’t who you think he is.”

“Even I’m extremely suspicious of what Michael said to Dr. Jones to make Dr. Jones attack him!”

“He probably didn’t say anything–”

“You and Dr. Jones have been together for so many years. Do you think he would do something impulsive?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows and asked Monica. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Monica shook her head. “No.”

“If Dr. Jones hadn’t been provoked, he wouldn’t have made a move. Michael has been in politics for many years, so he knows what to say and what not to say. However, what he said caused Dr. Jones to have such a big reaction. It wouldn’t be an accident.”

“Michael isn’t that bad.” Monica had been defending Michael all the time.

“So deep down in your heart, you’re certain this matter is Dr. Jones’s fault. He was the one who took the initiative to hit Michael.”

“That’s not it...” Monica felt conflicted.

She also did not know who to blame for that matter.

“You just said that Dr. Jones abandoned you again and again. After hearing what you said, I was a little moved. I also thought that Dr. Jones was a little ruthless toward you. However, I finally understand it now.” Jeanne said to Monica, “It’s because you never trusted him.”

“I...” Monica wanted to retort, but at that moment, she suddenly did not know how to retort.

“In other words, it might not be that you don’t trust him. It’s just that you trust Michael more than Finn.”

Monica was rendered speechless by Jeanne.

“But having said all those things, I actually wanted to tell you that Michael isn’t as simple as you think.” Jeanne brought the topic back.

“He won’t hurt me...”

“Is this how you defend Michael in front of Dr. Jones?” Jeanne asked her.

Monica bit her lip again.

“There would be no trouble if one had not asked for it.” Jeanne could not help but tell her that phrase.

Monica felt very uncomfortable. “I just think Michael is a good person.”

“Therefore, Dr. Jones is a bad person.”

“Can’t there be two good people?” Monica was starting to get a little angry.

“Do you think it’s okay to have two husbands?”

“You can’t jumble those two things together.”

“In love, between love rivals, there is one positive and one negative.”

Monica could not say a word.

“Monica, listen to me.” Jeanne took a deep breath as if she did not want to hurt Monica too much.

Monica acknowledged her uncomfortably.

“The matter of Dr. Jones beating Michael is not as simple as you think, especially now that it’s trending. If it’s not simple, you have to be extra careful. You have to think carefully about why this happened and whether it was an accident or someone was manipulating it from behind. If it was someone manipulating it from behind, who was that person? It would be whoever benefits most from it in the end.” After that, Jeanne asked Monica, “Who do you think benefited the most this time?”

Monica was stunned.

She did not know.

“It’s Michael,” Jeanne confirmed.

Monica wanted to say something but did not.

It really did seem like an instinct for her to defend Michael.

It was just that she had a deep-rooted feeling that Michael would not do anything to hurt her.

“Firstly, the news has increased Michael’s popularity again. Since Michael still needs to boost his popularity, any news that can make the public remember him more will be helpful to his promotion in the future. Secondly, the news will distance you and Dr. Jones even more because no matter what, it is a form of harm to Dr. Jones. If Dr. Jones distances himself from you, it will be more difficult for you two to be together. To kill two birds with one stone, Michael can definitely think of it with his IQ.”

“But...” Monica wanted to say something but hesitated.

“But you still don’t believe Michael would do such a thing, right?”
