883 They Gave Up on Each Other

“Jeanne won’t kill him,” Finn said with certainty.

“How do you know?”

“Didn’t she tell us to leave last time?” Finn asked.

“If not for Edward’s scheme—”

“If not for Jeanne, would Fourth Master have succeeded?” Finn interrupted Nox.

Nox was rendered speechless by Finn’s words.

“Fourth Master and Jeanne’s relationship is mutual. Neither of them has given up on the other. Even if they were forced to be apart, they wouldn’t kill each other for the other. You don’t have to worry too much.” Finn understood what was going on.

Jeanne would not kill Edward, and Edward would not kill Jeanne either.

Even if they died, they would not die at the hands of each other.

Therefore, there was no need to be wary of each other.

Naturally, their relationship was different from his.

He and Monica… had given up on each other, and only because of that could he let go easily.

…

The days passed quickly.

It was much faster than Monica thought it would be, and the wedding was tomorrow.

Michael had been very busy recently, and the two of them had barely met. However, Michael came to pick her up to try on a wedding dress today.

It was the last day.

Jeannie said that she had to get hold of Michael’s scandal today. Otherwise, Reese alone would not be enough to help her in ruining the wedding.

She and Michael walked into the largest bridal shop in South Hampton City.

The exquisite wedding gowns were so beautiful that it was like a dream.

Back when she got married for the first time, she had come to pick it herself.

Finn did not even look at her. She recalled that when she changed into a wedding dress that she was satisfied with, she called Finn, but he did not pick up.

“Mr. Ross. Ms. Cardellini.” The staff was extremely enthusiastic.

Monica came back to her senses.

Things had been always like the past lately, and most importantly, the past did not make her very happy.

She watched as the staff took out a dazzling wedding dress.

“Ms. Cardellini, Mr. Ross specially customized this for you overseas. It’s personally designed by the top master of wedding dresses, Tom. Every stitch and thread of the wedding dress is handmade. The diamond on the wedding dress is a priceless gemstone that can be polished into a perfect heart shape. Mr. Ross is very attentive to this wedding dress of yours. He even went overseas to supervise it personally,” the staff introduced the dress enthusiastically.

Monica was still a little surprised. She did not expect Michael to go overseas to customize her wedding dress even though he was so busy.

In her heart… The feelings in her heart slowly disappeared.

After all, she should not be touched by insincere love.

“Let’s try it on.” Michael did not say anything else and let her try on the wedding dress. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Where’s our best man and bridesmaid?” Monica asked. “Didn’t you say you wanted them to try it on together?”

“They should be on the way. Why? Are you looking forward to their gowns more?”

“I just don’t want to be compared to them,” Monica said bluntly.

Michael smiled.

He knew what Monica was thinking, so he said, “Don’t worry, Brie’s dress isn’t as pretty as yours, and most importantly, she’s not as pretty as you.”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She suddenly remembered the sweet words Michael said to her when they were dating.

It was not that she was easily moved. Rather, no one else had said that to her other than Michael.

As a woman, her heart still raced. However, she would not be soft-hearted.

With that, she followed the staff into the changing room.

When they were discussing the details of the wedding, Michael said that he did not want it to be too high-profile, so he would only find a couple of groomsmen and bridesmaids. Monica said her best friend was Jeanne, but Jeanne was not in South Hampton City. Since there were no bridesmaids, she told Michael to find one himself.

Michael thought Monica was not looking forward to the wedding, so he did not put in any effort and did not suspect that she had other motives. Just like that, he agreed to Monica’s request.

Unexpectedly, Michael really did look for Brie.

When Jeanne told her that Michael would definitely look for Brie, she did not believe it. After all, she did not know if there was something going on between them. At that moment, she suddenly felt that she was not as meticulous as Jeannie, who could be certain just by listening to her talk about Michael and Brie.

Jeannie explained to her that Michael was a person who pursued perfection. He would not let anyone make a mistake at his wedding, so he would definitely find his most trusted person to help him. From what she said, Brie often being by Michael’s side was enough to show that Michael trusted Brie.

It was such deep logic.

Monica did not know when she would be able to learn it. In fact, she felt that she would never be able to learn it.

She finally changed into her wedding dress after a long time.

The moment she walked out, Michael, who was originally talking to the best man, paused for a moment when he saw Monica. He was obviously a little surprised.

Even Monica thought that the wedding dress made her look extremely beautiful.

If it had been a normal wedding, she might have been touched.

“Do I look good?” She smiled.

Before Michael could answer, a female voice behind her said, “It’s too beautiful.”

Monica turned around and saw Brie.

Brie was wearing a white bridesmaid dress, which was also very exquisite. It was a tube top with a short swing and a fluffy design. It was also very beautiful looking. However, it paled in comparison to Monica’s elegant wedding dress.

“Is that so?” Monica smiled.

“All women will be envious of your wedding dress,” Brie said sincerely.

It seemed to be just a compliment and nothing else.

“Thank you.” Monica smiled politely.

At that moment, Michael walked over and stood in front of the mirror.

He and Monica looked like the perfect match.

The staff around her praised her, and Monica had never been more flattered in her entire life.

Moreover, she realized that there was an imperceptible trace of jealousy in Brie’s stiff smile.

She tried on the wedding dress for the entire afternoon.

Monica purposely dragged it out until dinner time. When she was about to leave, she suggested, “Let’s have dinner together tonight. I want to get to know the best man and bridesmaid. I also want to talk about the details of tomorrow’s wedding. I’m afraid something will go wrong tomorrow.”

Michael wanted to refuse.

However, Monica had said it in front of Brie and the best man, so he had to consider the feelings of others, even if they were all his subordinates.

Besides, there was nothing wrong with discussing the details of tomorrow’s wedding.

He had been very busy the last few days with many wedding details and did not know much about them. He, too, needed to familiarize himself with the itinerary.

Hence, they agreed to Monica’s suggestion and walked into a high-end french restaurant.

They ordered their own food.

Monica watched as Brie cleaned up Michael’s tableware naturally. It should have been prepared by the waiter, but she personally prepared it for him.

At first, Michael was very calm, like he was used to it. However, he slowly noticed Monica’s gaze and said to Brie, “Get the waiter to come.”

Brie smiled and put it down without feeling embarrassed.

Monica did not stare at Brie either as she said to the waiter nonchalantly, “Please open a bottle of red wine.”
