869 Step by Step, the Proposal

“I was very glad that Michael trusted me unconditionally. For a while, I hid at home and didn’t even dare to go out. It was Michael who lifted me up through this difficult time and even helped me find the source of these photos. I was very touched.” Monica answered, following her standard lines.

“Your wedding will be held on the 15th of next month. Is there anything you would like to share with everyone?” The reporters quickly gossiped.

Monica did not answer. This question had been in Michael’s “play”.

“Speaking of which, I’ve been so busy with work that I haven’t even given Monica a true proposal yet. Let me take this opportunity to tease you today.” Michael paused for a second.

A handsome smile appeared on his face, and suddenly, countless balloons, confetti, and flower petals floated down from the sky.

The reporters on the scene all exclaimed while Monica just looked at him indifferently. She had not expected Michael to do this. Michael had only said he would propose on the spot, not for flowers and confetti to reign down.

She had been married once. However, the wedding had just been a formality, let alone a proposal.

She stared at Michael as he suddenly knelt in front of her, took out a ring, and held it in front of her.

“Monica, will you let me pamper you, love you, tolerate you, take care of you, and accompany you from now on?” Michael asked her affectionately. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Monica’s eyes suddenly watered. She was not really touched, just a little sad. In her heart, she knew Michael was still the man who treated her the best in the world. Why would reality give her such a big slap in the face?

What if Michael was still the best man in the world for her? Even if she had broken up with Finn for him, she did not have to make herself feel so bad, nor the stupidest person in the world.

However, Monica’s expression at this moment made everyone think that she was touched by Michael’s deep affection and love.

Someone even took a photo of Monica’s tear and signed it off as “happy and romantic tears”.

It was even trending on the internet and was envied by them all.

Jeanne said that the more she performed now, the easier it would be to slap him in the face later on. So, she would cooperate with Michael’s performance.

“I do,” Monica agreed.

The applause was endless, and the balloons, confetti, and flower petals danced around them, creating a beautiful scene.

Michael put the ring on Monica’s ring finger.

Monica’s throat trembled.

When she and Finn got married, they did not have wedding rings. How ridiculous! During the ring exchange segment of the wedding ceremony, Monica asked the staff to prepare two decorations. Once their vows were exchanged, they threw them away.

Monica’s throat trembled again.

Now that she thought about it, it was possible Finn did not love her that much. He had risked his life to save her back then, but perhaps it really was as he had said. If it were anyone else, he would have done the same.

He was a doctor. It was his job to save the dying and help the injured.

Monica’s eyes seemed to water even more.

Michael got up from the ground and looked closely into Monica’s eyes.

He lifted her chin.

Then, in front of everyone, he kissed her.

Monica acquiesced.

Not only was she unable to resist, but this might be the only time she would experience this in her life.

While she could not enjoy marriage and love properly, and even if some rituals were fake, she would take it as it was and leave behind no regrets.

The audience burst into applause again. Everyone was giving their blessings to the couple.

When that day came that Michael’s reputation was completely disgraced, would Michael choose to die with her?

That press conference was a triumph. He had successfully cleared Monica’s name and shaped himself into a good man. Everyone was talking about it with great relish. It was named the most romantic proposal in history.

Finn had seen it too.

When he went to the ward to check on his patient, the television happened to be broadcasting this news.

In addition to the patient, there were also family members in the ward, especially the granddaughter of the family member, who was quite young. She kept saying, “Michael’s so handsome.”

“Why’s Michael so good to Monica?”

“Monica is simply too blessed.”

“I’m so touched that I’m about to cry.”

Finn had been listening carefully to the patient’s heart.
