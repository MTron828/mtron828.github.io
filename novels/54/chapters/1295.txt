1296 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

Candice felt that since Edward asked, she had to explain it to him and that she was not qualified to let him waste time to understand her.

“Is there anything you want to do?” Edward asked her.

Candice shook her head. “I don’t know if it’s because I’ve slept for too long, or if it’s because I’ve experienced life and death but when I woke up, I felt like I wasn’t interested in anything. I couldn’t find anyone to do what I wanted to do. It’s hard to reignite any interest in my heart.”

“Here?” Edward’s slender and clean finger pointed at her heart.

Candice pursed her lips and nodded.

“It’s okay, I’ll warm it up for you,” Edward said seriously and firmly.

Candice smiled. “I’m not telling you so much because I want you to do something for me. I just want to tell you that in my current state, I’m afraid that sometimes I’ll do something wrong and offend you.”

“My name is Ed,” he suddenly said while slowly retracting his finger.

The moment he did so, he seemed to have glanced at her chest.

“Huh?” Candice was surprised.

“Edward Swan, from the Swan family.”

“Oh.” Candice came back to her senses.

So he was introducing his own name.

“Call me Ed,” he repeated, now with a tone a little domineering.

Candice took a deep breath and said with a smile, “Ed.”

The moment she called out, she seemed to have seen the light in Edward’s eyes. It was the light reflected because of the dampness in his eyes, which surprised her.

Amidst the shock, she heard Edward call her in an extremely low and gentle voice, “Candice.”

The two of them were moving fast, they had started addressing each other casually.

After sitting on the boat for a long time, they finally reached the shore.

It was already eleven at night.

Edward sent Candice back. They arrived at the Nicholsons’ residence.

Candice got out of the car and prepared to leave.

“Candice.” Edward suddenly called out.

“Yes?”

“I’ll introduce you to a friend tomorrow,” Edward said bluntly.

“Okay,” she agreed immediately.

He was thinking that Edward wanted to introduce her to his friend.

If she was being honest, she thought that Edward did not have many friends.

He was so busy, how could he have the time to make friends?

She then gave it another thought. Nox and Finn were his friends in the past so they should still be his friends now.

She just did not expect such a thing to happen when she was dating Edward.

It was as if she had just fallen in love and needed to meet his parents and friends to obtain their approval.

“Let me send you off,” Edward suddenly said.

Candice really wanted to reject him. They were already home. What else was there to send?

In that second, Edward walked over and pulled her hand into his palm.

Candice’s eyes flickered.

Sometimes, she really felt that Edward was very skilled at doing such intimate things.

Thinking about it, it was only natural.

After all, Edward had already been married twice. A man who had been married twice was naturally at ease when it came to matters between a man and a woman.

The two of them walked into the residence hand in hand.

Although it was already eleven o’clock, the living hall was still brightly lit.

Wyatt was still waiting for Candice to return. Claire and Chloe were also accompanying him in the hall.

At this moment, when they heard footsteps, everyone hurriedly looked up and saw Edward holding Candice’s hand.

That one glance changed Chloe’s expression. She looked at the two of them behaving intimately and saw the Chief who was beside Candice bearing a gentle expression.

It was affection.

Her mother even said that the Chief was cold-blooded and that he did not care about women at all?!

He was clearly being really nice to Candice!

No way. The Chief was hers. The position of his wife should be hers too.

If Candice had not suddenly woken up, the honor and wealth to be his wife would have been hers!

“Chief.” The moment Wyatt saw Edward, he hurriedly went forward and was extremely respectful.

Claire had attended many important events with Wyatt over the years. Naturally, she was polite and well-mannered to welcome them together.

On the other hand, Chloe slowly walked over with some grievances.

“I’m only sending Candice back. Don’t have to stand on ceremony.”

...

“Sure, sure” Although Wyatt said that, he did not show any signs of relaxing.
