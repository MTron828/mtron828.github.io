Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Even if he graduated and started working in the future, would he be like all those people who worked overtime, long hours, or non-stop every day to earn money?

His eyes flickered when he heard a young woman crying beside him.

As she cried, she said into the phone, “I want to quit. I don’t want to live the life I have now. I’m really tired and still broke! Why must I live such a tiring life? If this continues, I will die.”

It was obvious that someone was comforting her, but the woman just kept crying non-stop.

Benjamin looked on indifferently. He thought, if there was really a choice, why would he want to live such a hard life?

After the subway arrived at the station, Benjamin walked into Shelly’s neighborhood and opened her door. The house was very quiet, and only a dim light was left on in the living room. Instead of watching TV, Shelly was reading a book, and Bella was probably asleep.

Benjamin just stood at the door and watched the scene in the room. His eyes were fixed on Shelly’s beautiful face, which was not because of plastic surgery. The beauty that she exuded was gentle, quiet, refreshing, and charming. As Shelly looked up at the door, a hint of surprise flashed in her eyes, which were as clear as ever.

“You’re back?” Shelly put down her book and stood up from the sofa.

Benjamin’s throat moved, and he replied, “Yeah.”

“I thought you would be back late.” Shelly handed him a pair of house slippers.

There were no men’s house slippers in the house before, but one day, when he came over, he found a pair of blue slippers in the shoe cabinet. He was so touched that his heart ached.

“Were you waiting for me?” Benjamin asked.

“Yes.” Shelly smiled. “Aren’t you leaving tomorrow? If I don’t wait for you tonight, I won’t be able to see you tomorrow.”

“I’m sorry,” Benjamin apologized.

“It’s alright.” Shelly held his hand. “I know you have something to do, and aren’t you back now?

“Yes.” Benjamin nodded.

There were many things he wanted to say, but when he looked at Shelly, nothing came out of his mouth.

“Why aren’t you watching TV?” Benjamin asked.

“I don’t really like watching television.”

“Don’t you feel scared when you’re alone? It’s better to turn on the TV,” Benjamin said.

He had reminded Shelly before to turn on the television when she was at home. He was afraid that she and Bella would be afraid if they were home alone, especially when the cyberbullying was still happening.

“It’s fine now. I won’t watch it if I turn on the TV anyway. Isn’t it a waste of electricity?” Shelly said casually.

Benjamin was stunned for a few seconds, but he then nodded slowly and did not say anything else.

As he sat on the sofa with Shelly, he saw the book that Shelly had casually placed beside her. It was a senior-year exercise book.

“Do you still want to study?” Benjamin asked.

“No.” Shelly shook her head. “I accidentally found some books under my cabinet today. I think I took them with me when I left the Winters. Since I didn’t throw it away even though I’ve moved so many times in the past few years, I took it out to read when I was bored and suddenly realized that I could do many questions.”

“Is that so?” Benjamin asked.

“It can’t be helped. I was a top student back then. I think if I weren’t met with an accident back then, I might have been able to get into South Hampton University,” Shelly said as she thought about the past. However, she did regret it too much, especially adopting Bella.

“It’s getting late. Do you want to sleep?” Shelly changed the topic. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She realized that Benjamin did not seem too keen on talking about that. On the contrary, he seemed a little disappointed. However, she figured it was probably because he was leaving tomorrow, and just like her, he was reluctant to part with her.

In fact, she was also a little sad at the thought that they would be year. After all, a flight ticket was so expensive. Benjamin definite] come back within a year.

Hence, she could only hide her emotions, afraid that Benjamin would be even sadder and more reluctant to leave if he saw her. Not to mention tonight, she had mentioned before he left that they should do it. She did not want him to look have a bitter look on his face when they were in the act.

She also wanted to have a good night with Benjamin. At the very least, they would be able to keep that moment as a sweet memory of each other when they were apart.

“I’ll turn on the shower for you.” Shelly stood up from the sofa with a trace of shyness in her eyes and was about to head to the bathroom..
