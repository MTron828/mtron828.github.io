1049 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

Steve was stunned for two seconds before he got into the front passenger seat.

Then, the car drove to its destination.

Along the way, Steve was still in disbelief at how ruthless and cold Monica was to the boy.

He could no longer see her as the little girl who only knew how to hug her father and act like a spoiled child.

At that moment, Monica was sitting in the back seat, but she did not seem to think too much of the boy’s nonsense just now.

Steve sighed.

A person could really be pushed to their limit because of many things. It was as if Monica had changed into a different person.

The car arrived at the most luxurious high-end club in South Hampton City, where there was food, karaoke, and other entertainment.

Many business dinners would choose that place!

Monica and Steve walked to the designated private room together.

Monica took a deep breath.

She was not afraid, nor was she trying to back away. She was just adjusting herself to be in her best state of mind.

The corners of her lips curled up into a smile, and she had Steve push the door open.

When the door opened, there was a table of people inside.

However, the smile on Monica’s face still froze because she saw Michael. It was at that moment that she realized that tonight’s dinner was set up by Michael.

It was probably because she had really provoked him and she did not give him a chance to take his anger out on her. Hence, he made the trap to get her to come to him.

She sneered and turned around to leave with Steve.

“Don’t you want to talk about the cooperation?” Michael asked her.

She was well aware that she would not gain any benefits from Michael.

“Mr. Sanchez and I are just negotiating. Let’s compete fairly,” Michael said sincerely.

Monica stopped in her tracks.

Steve turned to look at her and reminded her, “Chairman, there’s no need to.”

At that moment, Monica turned back to the room.

She said, “There’s no other way anyway.”

“But–”

However, Monica had already walked into the luxurious private room.

Steve had no choice but to follow Monica.

Michael even told the waiter to choose a seat closest to Richie Sanchez for Monica, which was very kind of him.

Of course, Monica did not think that Michael would be so kind, but she had no other choice.

“This is…” Richie Sanchez looked at Monica as if he did not know her.

“Hello, Mr. Sanchez. I’m Monica, Gary’s daughter,” Monica introduced herself.

“Oh.” Richie Sanchez came to a realization. “So you’re old Gary’s daughter. You’ve grown up to be so beautiful.”

“Ms. Sanchez, you’re too kind.” Monica smiled.

“Ms. Cardellini, aren’t you going to offer a toast to Mr. Sanchez? You have to learn how to leave a deep impression on the other party at the dining table,” Michael reminded ‘kindly’.

Monica knew Michael’s motives, which were to make things difficult for her tonight. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In that case, she would grant him his wish to make him understand that she did not care about those things at all.

No matter how he tried to deal with her, it would have no effect on her.

She picked up the wine glass in front of her. “Mr. Sanchez, welcome to South Hampton City. Here’s a toast to you.”

“Alright, alright.” Richie Sanchez quickly picked up his glass.

The two of them downed their wine in one go.

Monica’s alcohol tolerance was good, so drinking two or three glasses was not a problem for her. However, she could not refuse more toast and kept on drinking.

Steve could not stand it anymore.

He quickly raised his glass. “Mr. Sanchez, I’m the chairman’s special assistant. I used to work by Mr. Cardellini’s side, but now that something has happened to him, I’ve been following the chairman. However, when I was with Mr. Cardellini, I often heard him talk about you. He said that you’re a very talented businessman, and I must say, your reputation really precedes you. Cheers!”

Richie Sanchez glanced at Steve.

It was obvious that he did not think much of Steve’s toast.

In the past, when the Cardellini Enterprise was at its peak, pharmaceutical companies could not afford to offend senior assistants like Steve. They even had to curry favor with the ordinary employees of Cardellini Enterprise. Yet now, because of the decline of Cardellini Enterprise, those pharmaceutical companies, who once relied on Cardellini Enterprise to develop, had begun to look down on them.

Richie Sanchez did not accept Steve’s toast.

Steve was a little embarrassed, but he forced himself to remain calm. “I’ll drink to you.”

Monica saw all of that happen before her eyes.

After Steve downed his glass of wine, he took the initiative to toast Richie Sanchez again.

That was when Monica stopped him. She knew very well that Steve was trying to help her drink.

However, Michael would not let Steve succeed. In fact, he would make them suffer a double loss.
