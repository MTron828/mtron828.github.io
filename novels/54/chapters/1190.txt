1191 Forced Into A Marriage

“Believe in yourself.” Finn said in a gentle voice, “I will do my best to help you recover.”

Nox did not answer.

At that moment… he really believed Finn!

Damn it. He clearly wanted to die, but he was bought over by Finn with just a few words. Why did he feel weak in front of Finn?

Once Finn was done with the injection, Nox’s parents and grandfather, as well as Shelly, came.

In fact, they had been accompanying Nox in the hospital. However, because of Nox’s temper, Finn told them to go back first while he tried to comfort Nox alone.

They thought that since Nox still could not accept reality, they came back with Old Master Winter not long after they left.

Finn looked at them respectfully. “Grandpa Wade, Uncle Eugene.”

“Thank you for your help, Finn.” Wade gave Finn a kind smile.

“As I should.” Finn nodded. “I’ve already given Nox water, but he hasn’t eaten anything all day. He can have some porridge now. I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave first.”

He knew that the Winters had something to tell Nox in private and that it might be inappropriate for him to be around.

“Alright. You must be tired. You should get some rest.”

“Yes.”

With that, Finn left and closed the door behind him.

Nox stared at Finn’s back.

Finn was still so afraid of interacting with other people’s families.

When he was young, he thought that Finn was too lonely. Apart from him and Edward, he had almost no friends or relatives. Therefore, he wanted to bring Finn back to his home, but Finn rejected him. He thought it was because Finn did not like him, but he later found out that it was because orphans never had a family, so they did not dare to experience what it was like to have a family.

It was because they were afraid and had low self-esteem.

Nox retracted his gaze and looked at Wade.

He had never liked his grandfather since he was a child, and it was rare for his grandfather to come to see him alone.

Nox said, “I’m crippled!”

Wade frowned.

“I said, my legs are crippled!” Nox said bluntly.

“I know.” Wade nodded. “I thought you would be dead.”

“Please! I sacrificed myself for Edward! If not for me, Jeanne would’ve died, and if Jeanne died, Edward would’ve rebelled and destroyed the Swans, the Duncans, and all of us...” Nox blurted out all the words that Finn had just praised him with.

He even thought that he was impressive.

Wade furrowed his brows. Was that what they meant by Nox having nothing to live for? He knew that his grandson would not be able to walk the path of an ordinary person.

After Nox finished speaking, he concluded, “I’m a great man!”

At the end of that sentence, he even had a smug look on his face.

Wade looked at his grandson for so long time that it made Nox feel a little vulnerable at that moment.

Then, Wade said, “That’s right. You made me very proud.”

Speechless, Nox looked at Wade with wide eyes.

Ever since he was young, he had been beaten and scolded by his grandfather, and it always made him suspect that he was picked up from the trash.

Hence, now that he was suddenly being treated like that, it made him panic.

“I’ve always thought that you’re the most useless one of the bunch. You always do whatever you want and never consider the consequences. I’ve always been worried that you’d ruin the Duncans’ business, but now I know that I’ve wronged you.” As Wade said that, he reached out and touched Nox’s head.

That action was filled with love.

Then, Wade said, “As expected of my grandson.”

Nox’s eyes were a little red.

F*ck. Why did his eyes water so easily today?

Nox said stubbornly, “it’s not too late to realize that now.”

“I heard from your parents that you’re giving up on yourself?” Wade did not get emotional and went straight to the point.

“Do I look like someone who would give up on himself?” Nox was agitated. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He would not admit it now, but before Finn told him off, every second reminded him of death.

Wade could not help but laugh. “I used to be afraid that you would be heartless and couldn’t achieve anything. Now, I’m glad you have such a personality.”

“Are you complimenting me?”

“Nox, even if you’re physically disabled, you must have a strong will. I don’t want you to be defeated by reality.”

“You’re the one who should have a strong will!” Furious, Nox did not hold back his tongue as he spoke to his grandfather. “Finn said that I can be treated and that I can still stand up. You’re cursing me– Ah!”

Nox hugged his head.
