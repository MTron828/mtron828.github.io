“You said you have a daughter?” Zoe exclaimed.

“Yes,” Shelly admitted frankly. “So can you believe me when I say I’m not here to break you up?”

“Could your daughter be Nox’s-”

‘You think too much. If my daughter were Nox’s, would I have brought her along to live such a hard life with me?” Shelly asked.

Zoe scrutinized her.

“Don’t worry, my daughter isn’t Nox’s, so I don’t have the power to break you up. If you believe I won’t tell Nox, you can leave. If you don’t believe me, you can give me a sum of money to shut me up. I’ve never thought of blackmailing you, but if you think that it can give you peace of mind, I won’t reject it.” Zoe frowned at Shelly.

Shelly should be quite young, yet she made so much sense that Zoe believed her for some reason. That woman could even ask her for money in such a dignified manner.

“Why did you get plastic surgery?” Zoe still could not trust Shelly completely.

If Shelly really did not have any improper thoughts about Nox, why would she need plastic surgery? Zoe knew Nox liked good-looking women, and it was rumored that Shelly was extremely ordinary.

Shelly was silent for a few seconds.

“Why? Is it because you want to seduce Nox?” Zoe mocked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“No.” Shelly said, “I got into a car accident when I was 18 years old, and my face was so severely disfigured that I had to undergo plastic surgery. I thought that since I was undergoing plastic surgery, I should have the doctor make me look good. After all, I was already going under the knife. Every woman had the right to look beautiful.”

“You were in a car accident?” Zoe did not seem to believe her.

“Yes, I didn’t take the college entrance examination because of the car accident,” Shelly said bluntly.

Still, Zoe did not seem to believe her completely.

“Why don’t you think about it? It’s my working hours now, and I can’t be out for too long. I’ll be leaving first.” Shelly did not want to waste too much time with Zoe.

After all, there was no need to tell Zoe about her personal matters.

As Shelly turned to leave, Zoe suddenly called out to her, “Wait a minute.”

Shelly stopped in her tracks.

“Name your price.”

It meant… Was Zoe planning to bribe her with money to keep her mouth shut?

Shelly thought for a moment before saying, “200 thousand.” In fact, she had just come up with the number randomly.

200 thousand dollars was only enough for her to buy a small apartment in South Hampton City, but she figured she could not live under Sarah’s roof forever. She had to have a home of her own with Bella.

Zoe looked straight at Shelly. ‘Just 200 thousand? Is she so easy to get rid of?’ “Is that too much?” Shelly asked.

After all, Nox would never give her so much money. They said that the richer the person, the more stingy they were. Otherwise, how could the person become rich?

“Didn’t you say you can write me a letter of agreement?” Zoe raised her eyebrows.

“I’ll go get a pen and paper right away.” As she said that, she walked into the restaurant. After a while, she came out with a pen and paper and asked, “How should I write it?”

“Just write that you received 200 thousand dollars from me today and promise you won’t seduce Nox in the future or say anything bad about me in front of Nox,” Zoe said.

Zoe was smart to not tell Shelly to write it out that if she were to violate the agreement, she would be digging her own grave.

With that, Shelly wrote it down without hesitation. She even signed it before handing the letter of agreement to Zoe.

Zoe glanced at it and then looked at Shelly. “Write your account number on it.”

Shelly took the agreement letter and wrote her account number on it.

Zoe said, “I’ll give you a call tomorrow.”

“Thank you.” Shelly thanked her sincerely.

Money was not a bad thing. Moreover, she was not the one who tricked Zoe. It was Zoe who wanted to give Shelly the money because she would feel uneasy if she did not give it to Shelly.

“Shelly, you’d better not play any tricks. If you do, I’ll make things difficult for you!” Zoe did not forget to threaten Shelly.

“Don’t worry. I will give you and Nox my blessings.” Shelly was very sincere.

Zoe looked at Shelly coldly. Then, the moment she was about to leave, her eyes suddenly flickered as she saw Nox suddenly walk out. He definitely saw her with Shelly, and panic flashed across her face.

She quickly put the agreement letter into her pocket, and her expression changed instantly. “Shelly, Nox and I are getting married soon. I hope you can give us your blessings. I know Nox had hurt you in the past, but it was because he really didn’t like you.. If two people don’t like each other, their marriage won’t be happy…”
