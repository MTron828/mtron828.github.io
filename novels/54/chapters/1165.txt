1166 The War Has Started: Igniting the War

Jeanne said, “If William is really a descendant of the Duncans, the people who can kill his men without anyone knowing would be the assassins from the Hills. Of course, if you don’t trust me, you can leave it to Chester or Justin to handle. However, handing it over to them would expose what we’re going to do tonight.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Warren did not agree immediately.

Jeanne did not urge him either. She was merely analyzing the current situation. “William seems to have a good relationship with Chester and Justin. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean that William is a descendant of the Duncans, so whether or not we need to be cautious is up to you, father.”

Warren looked at Jeanne.

He was thinking about everything that Jeanne had said.

Jeanne was indeed more thoughtful than he had thought. If she was truly loyal to him…

He had to admit that Jeanne’s behavior during this period of time had been very obvious, and he actually believed in her. However, when it came to his own interests, he had to give it more thought.

After all, the assassins of the Hills were not a small force. If he handed them over to Jeanne and they turned against him, the consequences would be unimaginable.

He said, “Jeannie, it’s not that I don’t believe you, but you’re pregnant now and I’m afraid you’ll overwork yourself. Besides, you’ve just returned to the Sanders. If I give you too much power, it might not be a good thing for you. In a family like ours, imbalance is a very scary thing.”

“I understand what you mean, father.” Jeanne did not seem to be surprised or disappointed by Warren’s reply. She did not seem to be in a hurry to get back the Hills’ assassins either.

“Don’t be disappointed in me.”

“I won’t.” Jeanne said with certainty, “I won’t be too involved in what happens next. I believe you already have your own plans. I’ll be leaving now.”

She knew her limits, and it was that sense of propriety that made Warren scrutinize Jeanne for a few more seconds.

Perhaps he was indeed too guarded against Jeanne.

Jeanne could not read Warren’s emotions, so she got up and walked out of his study.

Just as she opened the door, Warren suddenly called out to her, “Jeannie”

Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

The moment she turned around, an evil smile appeared on his face. She had expected Warren to test her.

She turned around. “Father.”

“Although I’m afraid that you’ll suffer, and that you’ll be the subject of the jealousy of other brothers and sisters, I really can’t think of anyone else I can trust besides you!” Warren suddenly said.

Jeanne did not seem to understand what Warren meant.

“I’ll leave the Hills’ assassins to you, and you can make the proper arrangements for tonight,” Warren said bluntly.

Jeanne did not agree immediately.

Warren raised his brows. “Why? are you throwing a tantrum at me just because I rejected you?”

“No, I’m not. It’s just that...” Jeanne said, “You just reminded me of the imbalance, and I think it makes sense.”

“Don’t worry. As long as I’m here, none of them can say anything. Moreover, the Hills’ assassins were originally yours, and they should have been returned to you a long time ago,” Warren said righteously.

Jeanne sneered as she found Warren’s words very ironic. However, she just smiled. “Since you believe in me, I will not let you down.”

“I’ll leave it to you tonight.”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

What would the outcome be tonight?

She did not know, but all she wanted was to regain the power of the Hills and speed up the war between the Sanders and the Duncans.
