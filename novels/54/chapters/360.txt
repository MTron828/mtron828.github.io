Chapter 361: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

Of course, even if he was the orphan of the Duncans, he would not have an honorable status once the Sanders was in power. In fact, it might even lead to his death! However, what the Sanders were afraid of was... What if the Swans were secretly supporting the Duncans?

In fact, all these years, the insiders thought that the Sanders was targeting the Swans to take back Harken’s business management rights from the Swans. The Sanders wanting to control the development of the business was, of course, one aspect. However, in reality, if the Swans were loyal to the Sanders and could drive the economic development of the Harken forward, the Sanders would not be so eager to take back the rights from them. Most importantly, the Sanders were starting to suspect that the Swans had helped the Sanders to take down the head of the Duncans back then just to retain their strength and protect the Duncans’ orphan.

The Sanders wanting to form a marriage alliance with the Swans was actually to test the Swans’ attitude toward the Sanders, and the Swans’ rejection could not be any more obvious. That meant the Swans did not want anything to do with the Sanders. Probably by using the excuse of not wanting to be involved in politics anymore, they were already secretly plotting a rebellion.

As for a rebellion... They had to find out if there really was that posthumous child.

In Harken, regardless of whether it was in business development or not, the Swans still occupied half of the country. The Sanders did not dare to touch the Swans so simply because once the Swans rebelled, it would cause huge economic losses in Harken. As the ruler of the Harken, he did not dare to take risks easily. Therefore, he could only secretly investigate whether the Swans were really raising and supporting the posthumous child. If not, the Sanders could still keep the Swans. However, if the child really existed… even if the Sanders was desperate, they still had to kill the Swans!

After a series of deductions, Finn was currently the most suspicious one. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He did not have a good impression of Finn anyway.

He admitted that he was governed by his feelings. Due to Monica and Finn’s relationship, he had always been hostile toward Finn.

Now... was the perfect time for him to use his official position for personal gain.

No matter his motive, he was very willing to have the man disappear from the face of this earth.

Something in his eyes flickered as he was thinking about how he could confirm Finn’s true identity.

The Duncans were all dead, so there was no such thing as a paternity test.

However, if he was really the posthumous child, he would definitely be shouldering the heavy responsibility of overthrowing the Sanders and restoring his family name. Then, he would definitely protect himself under any circumstances!

......

Therefore…

His eyes narrowed, and a cruel smile appeared on his face.

..

On Balti Islands.

Due to the time difference, afternoon in South Hampton City was now nighttime in Balti Islands.

As Balti Islands was a little far from South Hampton City, Jeanne was on a plane with Fourth Master Swan for eight hours. Upon landing, they rushed to one of the islands in Balti Islands, and after all the traveling, they finally arrived at the hotel at 8 p.m. local time in Balti Islands.

When they arrived at the hotel, Jeanne lay down on the big bed in the hotel.

She was too tired as traveling all day had really worn her out.

Moreover, in the two days after the wedding in South Hampton City, she had not had a good rest.

Edward looked at Jeanne and smiled before he walked toward the bed.

Seeing him approach, Jeanne suddenly sat up.

Edward was really amused by her appearance.

Jeanne realized the man had been smiling too much recently. Yes, it was a little too much!

“What are you doing?” Jeanne looked wary. She found the man... very dangerous.

Edward’s lips curled into an evil smile.

The man was so charming that Jeanne was stunned at that moment.

After she came to her senses, she saw that Edward had also climbed onto the bed.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, and she could not help but move backward. She did not want to do it when she was dead tired and on an empty stomach.

As her body moved back, Edward moved forward until Jeanne was at the headboard of the bed, and Edward pushed her against the headboard to stop her from moving.

Edward said, “Jeannie, don’t you know that my desires haven’t been satisfied?”

Jeanne’s heart started to race.

“That is why...” Edward raised his eyebrows. “I brought you to this place alone. This place has a radius of tens of miles with nothing else. What do you think it is for?”

Then, his face drew closer.

As he drew closer, Jeanne could feel his aggressiveness, and her breathing quickened.

It was because of his sudden sense of intimidation that she found it difficult to breathe.
