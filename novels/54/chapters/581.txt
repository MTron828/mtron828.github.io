Chapter 582: Monica and Finn’s Relationship Ended A Long Time Ago!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She returned to her newly bought luxury apartment, which Michael paid for.

However, she would return it to him eventually.

In fact, she had never thought of getting too deeply involved with Michael.

Everything she did was just to make up for the hurt she had done to Michael and to clear her conscience.

It was only because they were friends that she felt indebted to him, and lovers would never do that. However, no one could understand her.

She stopped in her tracks, and her tears blurred her vision.

All she could see was Michael standing at the door. She did not know how long he had been standing there, waiting for her.

Michael looked at her, his face filled with distress

It was a stark contrast to Finn’s cold indifference that kept appearing in his mind.

“Monica,” Michael called out to her, not daring to go up to her because she looked heartbroken.

It was as if he was afraid of hurting her.

Monica smiled.

With tears in her eyes, she forced herself to smile and said, “Michael, why isn’t the person I like you?”

Michael’s expression changed, but it returned to normal the next second.

Monica said, “If I liked you, I wouldn’t feel so bad.”

It was true. If the person she liked were Michael, she would not feel so bad.

She wiped her tears casually and went to open the door.

Just as she walked over, Michael suddenly hugged Monica in his arms, which stunned Monica.

Michael said, “It’s never too late.”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

Michael was saying that it was never too late to like her.

However, she was very clear about it. Apart from Finn, she did not like anyone else. Hence, she said, “Michael, let go of me.”

Michael scowled, but since Monica’s back was facing him, she could not see his expression.

“Michael...”

Michael let go of her. After all, he always did whatever she wanted.

She then verified her fingerprint, and the door opened. As Monica walked in, Michael followed her and helped her to the sofa.

He always took care of her and was always careful.

“What happened?” Michael asked her out of concern.

“Nothing.”

“Did you go to see Finn?”

Monica chose to remain silent.

In fact, Michael already knew when he saw how sad Monica was when she returned.

He said, “Do you want me to explain it to Finn?”

“No.” Monica shook her head. “I want to solve my own problems.”

Michael looked at Monica.

He knew very well that although Monica had chosen to help him, she still kept a distance from him.

The distance was a hint of their relationship.

At that, Michael secretly suppressed his emotions.

He deliberately changed the topic and said, “Monica, have you had dinner?”

“I have.” Monica forced herself to deal with Michael.

“I haven’t eaten yet.” Michael held his stomach. “It hurts a little.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Why didn’t you eat dinner?” Monica was concerned.

At that moment, it seemed her attention was diverted.

“I was going to eat after work, but I thought of coming over to check on you, so I forgot.”

“Did you come over after our call ended?” Monica asked.

“Yes.” Michael nodded honestly.

“So you’ve been waiting for me for more than two hours?”

“I didn’t have anything to do after work anyway.”

That was definitely not the case.

Not to mention not having dinner, but Michael still had to give his final speech tomorrow morning, so he should go back and prepare more.

Michael looked at Monica’s expression and quickly comforted her, “I’m just a little hungry. That’s all. Don’t look at me like I’ve done something extremely evil to you. I don’t know what to do...”

Michael looked like a boy who had just fallen in love.

Monica took a deep breath and said, “I don’t know how to cook. Do you want me to order takeout for you?”

“There’s no need. It’s getting late, and I should go back. I just wanted to see how things were going here.”

Monica did not insist he stayed either.

Michael was actually just being polite. If Monica had asked him to stay for dinner, he would have stayed.

However, he maintained his smile. “Well, I’ll be leaving now.”

Michael stood up, and Monica sent him out.

At that moment, Michael said, “Monica, can you come to watch my speech tomorrow?”

Monica hesitated.

“It’s okay. If you have something to do, you don’t have to come. It’s not important,” Michael quickly added.
