Chapter 192: Teach Joshua a Lesson

Jeanne left the living room.

Jasmine was furious.

It was not just Jasmine.

Alexander’s expression was also ugly at this moment.

“Forget it.” Jenifer suppressed the emotions in her heart and comforted Alexander, “She’s just a stubborn duck. At the end of the day, she’s just throwing a tantrum at us. If you argue with her, wouldn’t that just make you feel worse?”

Alexander said coldly, “She doesn’t know what’s good for her!”

With that, he waved his hand and left the living room.

Jasmine watched Alexander leave, and the emotions that she had been holding in exploded instantly. “Mom, I really want to kill Jeanne!”

“Calm down.” Jenifer looked around and pulled Jasmine toward the back garden.

In the pavilion in the back garden.

Jenifer asked very seriously, “How have you and Eden been doing recently?”

Jasmine’s expression changed immediately.

Jenifer frowned. “What’s wrong? Is there a conflict?”

She had just heard Jeanne’s explanation and felt nervous. Seeing Jasmine’s reaction at this moment made her even more nervous.

“I don’t know what I’ve done wrong during this time. Eden just ignores me.” Jasmine’s eyes turned red immediately.

“How could it be? Didn’t you say that he has always been good to you?” Jenifer asked nervously.

“I really don’t know. I still treat him like I used to. I listen to him and take care of his daily life. I don’t know if it’s because he’s under too much pressure from work. He gets home from work a little late these days, and he’s always not in a good mood. I don’t dare to provoke him. In fact...” Jasmine wanted to say something but stopped.

“What is it?” Jenifer asked hurriedly.

“It’s been a long time since we’ve slept together,” Jasmine said, her eyes reddening.

Jenifer’s face changed.

The thing she was most worried about had happened.

She was silent, then suddenly she looked very serious.

Jasmine was also frightened by her look. She quickly held Jenifer’s hand. “Mom, what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

“Men are all the same. What you can’t have is the best!” Jenifer gritted her teeth.

“What do you mean, Mom?” Jasmine looked at Jenifer nervously.

“Eden didn’t get Jeanne. Now that Jeanne is back and is capable, he naturally becomes interested in her.”

“No!” Jasmine shouted, “I’ll never let Jeanne seduce Eden. Never!”

“Calm down!” Jenifer berated, “It’s just a possibility. I didn’t say that it would definitely happen.”

“Eden won’t like Jeanne. He’s such a chauvinistic person. How could he like Jeanne, who thinks so highly of herself?!” Jasmine could not accept it!

“I know men too well!” Jenifer said coldly, “Your dad was the same back then.”

“What?”

“Back then, your dad also liked Jeanne’s mom more. Initially, Jeanne’s mom didn’t accept your father’s advances, but later, for some reason, she agreed. Back then, when your dad was pursuing Jeanne’s mother, I was also pursuing your dad. Your dad didn’t even look at me. It was only after your dad finally got Jeanne’s mother that he looked at me. Of course, I was able to get together with your dad because Jeanne’s mother was too overbearing back then. Jeanne is just like her mother. They never know what a man wants!” Jenifer thought about what happened in the past, her face was filled with malice.

“That’s why Jeanne deserved to not have ended up together with Eden. It’s impossible for her to end up with Eden now,” Jasmine said fiercely.

“You and I are different. Back then, it was your dad who got Jeanne’s mom first, so he didn’t have any lingering feelings for her. On the other hand, Eden has never gotten Jeanne.”

“You mean that Eden is thinking of ways to get Jeanne now!” Jasmine was very agitated.

Jenifer nodded.

“Jeanne, that b*tch! I knew she came back to deliberately get involved with Fourth Master Swan. In fact, she wants to use this to attract Eden’s attention and seduce him!”

“Whether Jeanne is trying to seduce Eden and get involved with Fourth Master Swan or not, I still don’t know. However, I have to say that it won’t be good for us if Jeanne gets involved with either of them!”

“That b*tch!” Jasmine cursed fiercely.

“Fortunately, Jeanne is being accused now!” Jenifer’s expression turned fierce. “I’ve inquired about it. Jeanne sought personal gain. There are witnesses and evidence. She’ll be sentenced to about ten years for sure. Once she’s in prison, she’ll never be able to rise again!”

Jasmine sneered. “Serves her right!”

“So, while Jeanne goes to court, don’t cause any conflict with her. Since she’s between life and death and doesn’t have any good days left, I’m worried that she’ll drag us down with her.”

“Okay.” Jasmine nodded obediently.

In any case, once Jeanne was in prison, she would not be able to show off anymore!

…

At this moment, Jeanne returned to her room.

George sat in front of the computer and turned his head to look at Jeanne. There was a trace of happiness in his eyes, but he was afraid of being noticed, so he suppressed it.

“Did you miss me?” Jeanne smiled.

She could speak ill of the Lawrences just now, but toward George, she could recover her image of a loving mother in a second.

George did not answer but calmly asked, “I heard that Kingsley is back. Did he bail you out?”

Jeanne pursed her lips. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

She did not want to lie to George.

Even so, she also did not want George to know too much.

She directly changed the topic and said, “I’m in some trouble, and I need you to do something for me now.”

“Okay.” George nodded obediently.

Jeanne told George about the two companies that she needed him to target and asked him to get their accounts.

George was engrossed in it.

After Jeanne finished explaining to George, there was nothing else for her to do.

She just lay on the bed and thought about her case.

The things that Finn had given her were already very comprehensive. She just needed to follow the clues…

Her eyes flickered.

Was this what Fourth Master Swan had told her?!

Fourth Master Swan had mortgaged the Swan Enterprise’s real estate to the city hall to get her bail pending trial...

Jeanne’s heart was pounding.

At this moment, Kingsley’s cold voice suddenly rang in her ears. “The two of you... Have different standpoints.”

Jeanne flipped over.

She flipped over and covered herself in the blanket.

Although she was not clear about her standpoint and Fourth Master Swan’s, she believed in Kingsley.

…

The next day.

Jeanne went to the Lawrence Enterprise.

Her appearance instantly attracted the attention of countless people.

Everyone looked at her as if she was a monster. They all felt that she was dead for sure. She was just asking for humiliation for showing up at the company at this time.

Jeanne appeared very calm.

She walked into her office.

Once she pushed the door open…

Her eyes narrowed.

Inside were all sorts of messy junk from the marketing department, including some unwanted office furniture.

Jeanne was silent for a few seconds before she turned around and walked out.

She walked to the large office of the marketing department and asked a random employee, “Where’s Amy?”

“A-Amy...” The employee was a little scared by Jeanne’s aura. “I-I don’t know.”

Jeanne pursed her lips. She did not make things difficult for the employee. She turned around and walked to the office of the project team that she had specially set up.

Despite that, there was no one in the office.

It had only been two days since her arrest, but it was clear that all of her people had since been chased away.

Joshua’s way of doing things was dirty indeed.

Jeanne walked straight to Joshua’s office. Without knocking on the door, she pushed it open and entered.

At this moment, Joshua was playing a game in his office.

Fighting sounds from the game could be heard.

The moment Joshua heard the commotion at the door, he hurriedly stood up from his office chair. With an extremely ugly look, he shouted at the door, “Do you want to die? How dare you come in without knocking on the door?!”

After he finished shouting, he saw that it was Jeanne.

Jeanne’s aura during this period was indeed a little scary.

When Joshua saw Jeanne’s cold expression, he was shocked.

The next second, he thought that Jeanne was going to die anyway, so he instantly straightened his body and shouted, “You’re looking for me!”

“What happened to my office?!”

“How would I know?!” Joshua looked like he did not care.

“Are you sure you don’t know?!” Jeanne’s face darkened.

Joshua felt his hair stand on end when Jeanne looked at him.

He suddenly said in a somewhat irritable manner, “It was me who did it! You’re going to jail and your office is empty, so I let them put trash from the marketing department inside. Who knew you’d appear again so shamelessly? If it was me—”

Jeanne suddenly walked toward Joshua.

Joshua was shocked.

Jeanne took the phone from Joshua’s hand and threw it on the ground.

The phone was smashed to pieces.

Joshua was furious. “Jeanne, are you crazy?!”

“I’ll be crazy if you’re crazy!” Jeanne enunciated each word. “I’ll give you one hour. Get someone to clear out my office immediately and get Amy and everyone in my project team back. Otherwise…!”

Otherwise.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed as she clenched her fists. “I’ll beat you to death!”
