Chapter 1441: George Came Home Injured

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‘F*ck.’ Why did she feel the same way? Did that woman in front of her have mind-reading skills?

“Monica.” Not far away, Finn called out to her.

Monica turned to look at him.

“You can go see George now,” Finn said. Monica quickly walked over.

“Slow down,” Finn said.

However, Monica pretended not to hear him. At that, Finn followed Monica’s footsteps carefully, clearly protecting her.

Candice smiled and followed them into George’s room.

“George, how are you?” Monica asked George nervously.

Her eyes were red.

“I’m fine,” George quickly replied.

“How can it be nothing when you’re lying on the bed?” Monica reprimanded, “Don’t say it’s nothing. If it hurts, you have to say it out loud, understand? Don’t keep everything to yourself. If you keep everything to yourself, others won’t know how much pain you’re in. You’re the one who’s suffering.” “I know,” George answered.

It had to be said that George was very patient with Monica. She was probably the only person in the world that he could be close to.

“If you knew, you wouldn’t have said you were fine.” Monica knew George’s character too well. Then, she turned to ask Finn, “How serious is his injury?

“The kind that will keep him bedridden for half a month.”

Monica felt terrible.

“But he won’t die,” Finn added.

He was also afraid of agitating Monica.

“You will die. Your entire family will die,” Monica said unhappily.

Finn’s face turned pale from Monica’s sudden bashing. He said, “I can die, but the babies can’t.”

“Babies?” Edward turned to look at Finn.

Finn chuckled but did not answer. Some things were self-explanatory.

“Is Monica pregnant?” Edward asked straightforwardly.

“With twins,” Candice added.

Monica gritted her teeth.

“Congratulations,” Edward said to Finn.

“Thank you.” Finn gladly accepted it

“We don’t even know whose children they are. What’s there to be happy about?” Monica suddenly said faintly.

She said it on purpose because she could not bear to see Finn so smug.

Finn pursed his lips. In fact, he knew that Monica said it on purpose, but he still felt a little upset when he heard it.

“You guys can leave. I want to talk to George alone,” Monica urged them.

She did not want them to focus on her and the babies in her stomach.

Knowing that George did not like too many people around him, Edward dragged Candice along and walked out with Finn.

The moment the door closed, Finn said seriously, “George’s scratch is not a minor injury. Of course, because it’s an external injury, children particularly will recover very quickly, so you don’t have to worry too much. Just pay attention to George’s recovery every day. However, there’s something that needs your special attention right now, and that is George has a low fever.” Candice listened attentively.

Finn said, “I just asked George how he got injured. Apparently, it was because he caught a cold the day before the drill and felt a little unwell. That was what caused the accident. I also checked George’s temperature earlier. It was 38 degrees. Normally, according to George’s physical condition, he can recover on his own without any medicine. However, George is injured, and his immune system is weak. It’s very likely that he will have a high fever tonight. I can’t guarantee how high the fever will be, so we need to pay special attention to him.”

Candice noted everything down.

“I’ll stay here tonight. If there’s anything, I can deal with it immediately.”

“No need.” Candice rejected him directly. “You should spend more time with Monica. This is a critical period for you.”

Finn was stunned.

“You just have to make sure that your phone is on 24 hours a day. If George develops a high fever, I’ll call you and you can come over.”

Finn seemed to hesitate for a moment.

He turned to look at Edward, who nodded and said, “We’ll call you if there’s anything.”

“Alright.” Finn did not refuse. He said, “If the fever reaches 39 degrees, you must let me know.”

“Yes.”

After Finn reminded them again of a few points, Paige called Candice downstairs. Hence, Candice went downstairs with Edward.

Meanwhile, Finn stayed by George’s door, waiting for Monica, who accompanied George for a long time.

At the thought of George’s mother dead and his serious injury, Monica felt a little sad. If George had not urged her to leave, she would have stayed there tonight.

She opened the door, only to see Finn waiting for her at the door. Edward and Candice were nowhere to be seen. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I’ll send you back,” Finn said.

“No need. You should stay here and take care of George. I’ll go back by myself.” Monica refused his offer.

“George has Fourth Master and Candice to look after him. He doesn’t need me for the time being.”

Monica pursed her lips.

“You’re pregnant with my child. I should take care of you.” Finn found an excuse to use on her.

“Aren’t you afraid that the child isn’t yours?” Monica said on purpose.

“Even if it’s not mine, I’ll raise them as my own.” ‘You’re crazy,’ Monica thought to herself.

After Monica went downstairs, they left immediately.

Finn still drove like a snail. However, Monica was too lazy to remind Finn this time. Since Finn had pasted those words on the back of his car, no one honked at him anymore.

Monica leaned against the back seat and closed her eyes to rest. She just wanted to rest her eyes for a minute, but she ended up falling asleep in the car that was cruising steadily on the road.

As expected, pregnant women fell asleep easily.

Finn’s lips curled into a smile when he saw Monica sleeping soundly through the rearview mirror. He seemed to be in a good mood.

After the car arrived at Monica’s residential area, Finn got out of the car and opened the door to the backseat. Even then, Monica showed no signs of waking up.

Finn shifted his gaze from her face to her flat belly, thinking, ‘Life really is wonderful sometimes.’

He bent down, and just as he carried Monica out of the car, Monica’s eyelids twitched. Seeing that she seemed to be waking up, Finn’s body stiffened.

He could totally imagine how much Monica would hate him if she woke up right now. However… Monica was just trying to find a more comfortable position as she twisted her body slightly and fell asleep again.

Finn heaved a sigh of relief. At that moment, he could not help but find it funny. He did not know when he started to be so afraid of Monica.

He then carried Monica back to her house and used Monica’s fingerprint to unlock the door. Once he was in, he placed Monica on her bed, removed her shoes and socks, and helped her with the blanket.

The moment he lowered his head to kiss her, he held back and forced himself to leave.

When Monica woke up, she did not know what time it was, but it was already dark outside.

She sat up on the bed, a little dumbfounded. How did she get back? She remembered she was sitting in Finn’s car and then… nothing came to mind.

Did that mean Finn sent her back? Monica did not see it as important. In fact, she did not want to see it as important.

She just was a little hungry at that moment, so she got out of bed and planned to order takeout.

Yet, the moment she pushed open the door, she saw a man standing in the open kitchen and wearing an apron, looking like he was at home.

Monica did not expect Finn to be still around.. She was curious how thick-skinned a man could be when he was shameless!
