1241 Susan’s Arrival

At that moment, Jeanne tugged at Finn’s clothes.

Finn understood immediately. Hence, he held it in and said, “Fourth Master is busy, so let’s not bother him. We’ll talk about it after the examination.”

Teddy could only accept Finn’s decision.

Finn placed Jeanne on the bed in the ultrasound room and began to check on the baby’s condition. Meanwhile, Jeanne endured the pain in her stomach and looked nervously at Finn’s serious face.

“It’s alright. The baby is fine,” Finn said.

An inexplicable warm feeling washed over her. Every time Jeanne saw Finn, she felt a sense of reassurance that she would definitely be fine. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Does she lack oxygen?” Jeanne asked, holding back her stomach ache.

“No, the fetal’s heart is normal. It’s probably because she can feel your pain that she’s moving so much,” Finn explained.

Jeanne nodded silently. As long as the baby was fine, all was good.

She got up from the bed with Finn’s help.

She did not know if it was because she knew that the baby was fine, but she felt a little more relaxed. At that moment, she did not feel as much pain in her stomach as before.

She and Finn walked out of the ultrasound room and returned to Jeanne’s room. In the room, Edward’s pajamas were still there, and Finn saw them.

He had initially tried to matchmake Edward and Jeanne because he thought that they were just having some conflicts between husband and wife. It was only now that he realized they were having some huge conflicts.

In fact, it did cross his mind that Alex would not let Jeanne off. However, he was somehow confident that Edward would be able to protect Jeanne, so he did not take it to heart.

However, he did not expect Edward would also have times when he was not capable enough.

Finn helped Jeanne to lie down on the bed. “Are you feeling better now?”

“Yes, much better.” Jeanne nodded.

She really felt much better. Even though her stomach still hurt a little, the heart-wrenching pain from earlier was completely gone.

“Based on your condition, it should be acute gastritis. It’s a sudden cramp in the stomach caused by an occasional irregular diet, which then causes acute pain and nausea. Such situations are usually sudden and often happen during pregnancy. As long as you have a good rest and eat regularly, there won’t be much of a problem.”

“Okay,” Jeanne said.

“I’ll still prescribe you some medicine. It’s just a normal vitamin pill that can relieve stomach discomfort and won’t cause any harm to the baby. You can take one before eating,” Finn said. Then, he turned to Teddy, who had been following closely behind him. “Teddy, I’ll send you the name of the pill. Go to the pharmacy and get it for Jeanne.”

“Alright, I’ll go immediately.”

With that, Teddy left in a hurry. He was probably frightened by Jeanne’s sudden appearance just now, so he ran as fast as he could.

“Jeannie.” Finn asked, “Have you been eating irregularly recently?”

“No.” Jeanne shook her head.

She would eat when she should. To be precise, it was indeed irregular for ordinary people, but it was a regular schedule during her pregnancy.

“Is your appetite the same as usual?” Finn asked.

Jeanne thought about it and shook her head.

The recent news about Edward and Susan had indeed affected her appetite, so although she usually ate according to the time, she actually ate very little each time.

“That’s the cause of your gastric problem.” Finn said bluntly, “Has Fourth Master’s matters recently made you uncomfortable?”

Jeanne smiled. “No. It’s just that… I feel a little vexed occasionally.”

“Actually, he–”

“I know how helpless he is,” Jeanne interrupted Finn.

She knew that Finn wanted to put in a good word for Edward, but he really did not need to say much.

First of all, she really did not hate Edward. She truly understood all of his difficulties. She had even accepted the fact that he had chosen to give her up for someone else. Anyway, she was willing to trade her life for George and the baby in her stomach.

Secondly, she only had two months left. At the end of a person’s life, they really would not care so much about things.

Whatever Edward wanted to do or had to do was not important to her anymore. The only passion and hope she had left were to give birth to the baby in her stomach.

Of course, she had to admit that she had been a little emotional recently.
