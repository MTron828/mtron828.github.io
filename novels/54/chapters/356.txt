Chapter 357: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

Monica was chuckling and smiling very brightly at her phone.

When Finn, who was driving, heard her laughter, he glanced at her a few times.

The moment he saw her bright smile… In his memory, it had been a long time since he had seen Monica smile at him.

Then, he thought about it carefully.

She was originally a woman who had a positive outlook on life, not in regards to the pursuit of her career or power but just that she had a sunny personality. She saw the world as kind, and that was why people always thought she was heartless.

However, he did not know when it started that Monica was no longer so unbridled, or, to be more precise, she was no longer unbridled toward him.

Finn pursed his lips tightly and drove the car a little faster.

When they arrived at the Central Hospital, Finn parked, got out of the car, and walked toward Monica.

Monica was struggling to get off the ground. The moment her foot touched the ground, her expression twisted in pain.

Just as she was thinking about how to walk on one foot, Finn suddenly bent down and picked her up.

Monica was stunned, but she did not resist.

She knew very well that if she resisted, Finn might really let her go and leave.

That d*uchebag! All the good he did for her was just for show. If she did not accept it, he would really leave.

......

Since her body was important to her, she decided to remain silent.

They also waited in silence before Finn brought her to the orthopedics department.

The orthopedist looked at Finn politely and then touched Monica’s ankle. Monica was in so much pain that she was about to convulse.

As such, the orthopedist told them to get an x-ray, and the result was... a fracture.

When Monica saw the result, she was dumbfounded.

How could it be a fracture?

It was just a simple fall, so how could she have fractured her bone?

However, the doctor said the degree of the fracture was not very serious. It was considered a slight fracture, so there was no need to operate on it. All she needed was a cast and some medicine to treat it in the early stages.

Monica listened puzzledly. The doctor told her it was not serious, but he said the injury would take 100 days to heal.

All in all, the injury was not serious, but she had to pay special attention to it.

By special attention, he meant it was best to use a crutch and not put pressure on the ankle for a month. If her recovery went well, she would be fine, but if not, she might have to undergo surgery.

In short… She had to take good care of her foot and avoid any accidents.

Under the doctor’s advice, Monica bought a pair of crutches and left the hospital with her feet wrapped up like a dumpling in a cast.

Then, she still sat in Finn’s car. After all... her injury prevented her from driving.

However, to avoid awkwardness between them since the two of them were in an enclosed space, Monica had been looking at her phone ever since she got into the car.

Jeanne had not replied to her message yet.

She did not know if Jeanne had not seen it yet or if it was inconvenient for her to reply.

At that thought, Monica smiled again.

The moment she smiled, her phone suddenly rang.

Monica looked at the incoming call and turned her eyes as if she was looking at Finn. The next second, the call connected. “Michael.”

Finn, who was driving, unconsciously tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“Monica, where are you?”

“Uh, on the way home.”

“Didn’t you go to work today?” Michael asked.

It was only the afternoon.

George’s sports meet only took up the entire morning, and it did not take long for him to arrive at the hospital in the afternoon, so it was only about 2 p.m. now.

“I went to George’s sports day today.” Monica’s voice was high. From her tone, one could tell that she was in a good mood. She said, “You don’t know how bad Jeanne and Master Fourth Master Swan are as parents. They left George alone at home and went on their honeymoon. Coincidentally, today was George’s school sports day, so I took Jeanne’s and went with Nox.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She mentioned Nox but not Finn.

Although she was indeed heartless sometimes, there were some things she thought she should avoid arousing unnecessary suspicion.

“Is that so?” The other side also laughed. “I didn’t think they would leave George behind.”

“Me neither. If Nox hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have thought that Jeanne could do such a thing. Poor little George.”

“He still has you.”

“That’s true.” Monica smiled and said, “I really like George. Although he looks a little dull and doesn’t act like a child, he’s still lovable. Do you get me?”
