1143 The War Has Started: Finn in Danger

However, she thought that when it came to public welfare, at least Finn was still a selfless person.

She said, “Okay.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Since she knew that she could not influence his decision, she could only accept it.

Finn stared at Monica and watched as she suddenly compromised.

A second ago, he might have wanted to hold her back, but at that moment, he had given up.

The resemblance of their feelings for each other was uncanny. At one moment, it could be so passionate, and at another, it could be dead.

“In that case, I won’t disturb you anymore, Dr. Jones.” Monica stood up from her chair and said, “Thank you, Dr. Jones, for treating my father during this period of time.”

She was very rational, polite, and distant.

After that, she turned around and left.

“Monica,” Finn suddenly called out to her.

Monica stopped in her tracks but did not look back. It seemed that she would never turn back.

“Take good care of yourself,” Finn said.

She should take good care of herself in the future. If she really had depression, she had to see a doctor. There was no way for depression to recover on its own.

However, Monica did not respond.

Aside from their relationship as a doctor and the patient’s family, they had no relationship at all. Hence, she would pretend she did not hear the words that would only be said between friends.

Monica left just like that.

Finn stared at her back which was getting further and further away…

He still managed to maintain his rationality.

Finn then made a phone call. “Post what I’m sending you on the internet.”

“Now?”

“Now.”

“Alright.”

Once the call ended, Finn began to pack up his things. He was abnormally calm about what would happen next.

Half an hour later, the entire Harken was in an uproar because of an anonymous report that was posted all over the internet.

The report pointed out that when the Sanders was governing Harken, they repeatedly tried to control their economy by secretly controlling Lawrence Enterprise and then Cardellini Enterprise. Now, they were targeting Swan Enterprise. The report listed all the despicable means the Sanders used.

Firstly, about Jeanne’s right to inherit and operate Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was actually not a child of the Lawrence family and had no right to inherit it. However, in order to get the Lawrence Enterprise, the Sanders had allowed Jeanne to get it reasonably and legally. Then, because Jeanne was the daughter of the Sanders, Lawrence Enterprise naturally fell into the Sanders’ hands. There was also clear evidence that the person in charge of Lawrence Enterprise was Quinn, which further confirmed that accusation.

Secondly, Cardellini Pharmaceutical had just overcome a crisis, but the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy a while ago was a known fact. Everyone also knew that Michael was the one who controlled Sunny Pharmaceutical and wanted to take down Cardellini Pharmaceutical. If one looked closely at Michael’s identity, one would know that Michael had a close relationship with the Sanders because Michael’s resume was filled with his work for the Sanders. Therefore, it could be inferred that Michael’s attack on Cardellini Pharmaceutical was directed by the Sanders. It was because the Sanders wanted to obtain Cardellini Pharmaceutical and monopolize the pharmaceutical market.

There was an even more damning piece of evidence. The original head of Cardellini Pharmaceutical, Gary, had a heart attack. During his heart transplant surgery, a very serious medical accident occurred. However, the accident was not an accident. The report listed many things that happened, and the details were so detailed that everyone believed it was all true. The test results of the chief surgeon showed that someone deliberately drugged him, causing his cardiovascular disease and ultimately causing the surgery to fail. The person who drugged the chief surgeon had also been exposed on the internet. After a lot of digging into the person’s identity, the suspicion was on the Sanders.

Thirdly, all the people in charge of Swan Enterprise were detained. There seemed to be a legitimate reason, but so far, there had been no definite progress. The news released every day was just some trivial reasoning, without any real evidence at all. All the businessmen knew that the business world was like a battlefield. One minute of delay could cost them a huge loss. In other words, the Sanders was deliberately making things difficult for Swan Enterprise by stopping all of Swan Enterprise’s business transactions. They did not need to find any false charges for Swan Enterprise because if they continued to drag things out like that, Swan Enterprise would soon be exhausted of funds. The Sanders had the intention of making the Swan Enterprise go bankrupt. That’s why they have locked up the Swans and would only release them at the appropriate time. When they’re released, Swan Enterprise would declare bankruptcy, and the Swans would not be of much use. Without the Swans’ control over Harken’s economy, the Sanders would be able to smoothly control all of Harken’s economy!”
