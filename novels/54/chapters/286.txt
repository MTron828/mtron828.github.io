Chapter 287: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

In the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.

In the huge living room, Nox did not want to laugh, but he could not help it.

After all, Edward wanted to kidnap Jeanne’s son to achieve his goal, but he failed just like that.

Even Nox felt awkward for him.

He looked at Fourth Master Swan just like that. Fourth Master Swan’s expression was extremely ugly.

On the other hand, George, the child who had been kidnapped, was calm.

George told Fourth Master Swan calmly, “Fourth Master, my mom won’t come back to save me. She has long told me that I’ll leave her side one day anyway. She has only left ahead of time.”

Edward looked at George.

He looked at George. There was not a hint of fear in that small stature.

Edward asked, “Is that so?”

“My mom won’t be threatened by anyone.” George nodded and told him with certainty.

“Now, what do you think I should do to you? After being played by your mom, how can I take revenge on you?!” Edward asked.

“Let’s make a deal.” George was straightforward.

Edward raised his eyebrow slightly. He was obviously a little surprised.

Nox, who was standing next to him, was also shocked.

‘This little brat is truly calm in the face of honor and disgrace.

‘How can he be so calm in such a place?’

“Tell me about it.” Edward looked at George.

“I heard that you called my mom just now. You said that you would train me to become someone like him.” George turned to look at Nox.

Nox felt that he was looked down upon no matter what.

“It would probably cost a lot of money to groom a person,” George said to Edward.

“It does cost a lot of money,” Edward replied affirmatively.

“So, didn’t you lose a lot by kidnapping me?” George looked at Edward.

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“Not only did you fail to make my mom come back, but you also wasted a lot of money on me. Isn’t that a loss?”

“No money spent on you is a waste,” Edward enunciated each word clearly.

“We’re not related. Spending money on me is a waste.” George affirmed his point of view.

“Who said we’re not related?” Edward raised his eyebrow.

George looked at him.

At that moment, he seemed to be a little surprised by what Edward said.

“Tell me about your deal.” Edward returned to the main topic.

Some topics were simply brushed aside.

“You kidnapped me. Not only did you not make my mom return to your side, but you’re also going to help her raise her son. That’s not taking revenge; you’re being used by my mom,” George explained his point of view seriously.

Nox, who was standing at the side, was surprised.

If he had not seen it himself, he would not have thought that a 6-year-old child could speak with so much reasoning.

One would be led astray by the child if one was not careful.

Nox could not help but say, “He’s indeed being taken advantage of!”

Edward gave him a look.

Nox did not say anything else. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

George said, “Actually, I’m the same as you; I’m also a victim. We’re both abandoned.”

Nox was surprised again.

The child’s logic was amazing.

With just a few words, he even made himself sound like he was in cahoots with Fourth Master Swan.

At first, Nox thought that George was autistic. Usually, geniuses were not good with words.

Now, it seemed like…

As expected, people with low IQ were more talkative.

“So, we can’t hurt each other,”George concluded.

“So, I should let you go.” Edward looked at him.

“No.” George shook his head. “I know you won’t let me go.”

Nox was confused.

‘Why did he say so much if he knew that Fourth Master Swan won’t let him go?’

“Fourth Master, you’re a businessman, right?” George suddenly asked Edward.

Edward nodded slightly.

‘Somewhat.’

“Businessmen only care about money and benefits, right?”

‘Somewhat.’

“But you made a loss-making deal today.” George was straightforward.

‘Somewhat.’

“I know that the Swans have a fatal security system bug! If the bug isn’t fixed, it’ll pose a great threat to the Swans. I’ll help you fix this loophole and make up for the loss you suffered today.” Finally, George revealed his purpose. “After it’s fixed, you’ll let me leave.”

Edward did not agree.

He just looked at George directly.

“You can consider it.” George’s expression was serious. He added, “My mom won’t come back to save me no matter what. It’s useless for you to threaten her by taking me as a hostage. If she doesn’t come back, you won’t be able to achieve your goal. If you can’t achieve your goal, you’ll spend money to raise me. Fourth Master, you’ll suffer a hard loss.”
