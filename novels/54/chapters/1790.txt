Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She did not want to tell Benjamin about her and Nox breaking up so as to not create any opportunities for them both to get back together.

She said, “Don’t do this again.”

Benjamin nodded. “I was worrying too much.”

“No, it’s just that my relationship with Nox is a little special. It would be better if you didn’t interfere, ” Shelly said bluntly.

“I’m sorry.” Benjamin felt guilty.

Shelly sighed. “It’s fine. I know you’re just being kind. Um, I have to put Bella to sleep, so I won’t say anything more.” “Okay, bye.”

“Bye.”

After hanging up, Shelly turned around. When she saw that Bella had fallen asleep, she tucked Bella under the blanket, walked out of Bella’s room, and called Nox.

There were some things that she thought she should clarify because she felt that Benjamin’s behavior just now would only deepen Nox’s misunderstanding. However, Nox did not answer her call. She called three times, and he did not pick up any of her calls.

Shelly frowned. She had never encountered a situation where Nox did not answer her call. In the end, she put down the phone and thought about it before deciding to wait for Nox to return. Yet, that

night, NOX did not return home all night. It had been a long time since ne spent the night out.

Then came the second day, the third day, and even the fifth day, and Nox did not return home. It was as if he had suddenly disappeared from the world. Shelly was even debating on calling the police. However, she hesitated for a moment before giving Monica a call. “Monica.”

“Shelly?” When Monica received her call, she was a little surprised. “Why are you looking for me?”

“Um, have you been able to reach Nox?”

“Nox? What’s wrong? Is he missing?” Monica asked.

“He hasn’t been back for five days.”

“F*ck ” Monica cursed.

The first thing that came to her mind was that Nox must have gone out to fool around. However, on second thought, Nox liked Shelly so much now, so how could he go out and mess around with other girls?

She said, “I’ll try to reach him.”

“Alright, thank you.” Shelly quickly thanked Monica.

“Speaking of which, are you worried about him?” Monica asked.

Shelly was stunned by Monica’s question. She had been worried that something had happened to Nox for the past few days, but she had never thought of it as a form of concern.

Since she did not speak, Monica did not press further. After all, it was better for others not to get involved in other people’s relationships.

“I’ll call you back.”

“Sure.”

After hanging up the phone, Monica hurriedly called Jeanne. She did not know why, but whenever something happened, she would think of Jeanne.

Jeanne answered the call. “Nox? What’s wrong? Are you looking for him?”

“I’m not the one looking for him; it’s Shelly. She said Nox has been missing for five days, and he hasn’t been picking up his phone.”

Monica was somewhat speechless at how a grown man like Nox could make people worry.

Jeanne said, “Don’t worry. He’S fine.”

“Do you know where he is?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“I do.”

“So there’s something you’re not telling me.”

Jeanne was at a loss for words.

“Jeanne, I can’t believe you and Nox are hiding something from me. Do you think I won’t get angry just because I’m fat now? I’m very angry.”

Jeanne could not understand what was the relationship between being fat and not getting angry.

Jeanne said, “I’ll tell you, but don’t tell Shelly.” “Hmph.” Monica was a little unhappy.

With that, Jeanne told Monica about Nox. Monica was stunned. “Is Nox crazy?”

“I’m with him on this.”

“Isn’t he asking to be humiliated? With my understanding of Shelly, she definitely won’t accept it.”

“Do you think he doesn’t know that?” Jeanne asked.

“Is he stupid?”

“He’s giving himself and Shelly an explanation. Anyway, let him be.” Jeanne said, “Regardless of the outcome, Nox is prepared.”

“Nox did this to himself.” Monica sighed helplessly. “That’s why he regrets it so much.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“In that case, what should I tell Shelly?” Monica asked.

“Just tell her that Edward has something to discuss with Nox and that it’S confidential, so you cannot disclose it to her. He’ll return home when he’s done.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

“Don’t let it slip, ” Jeanne reminded her.

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.”

Jeanne nodded. She, too, knew that when it came to important matters, Monica was very reliable.

After Monica hung up on Jeanne, she called Shelly and told Shelly the reason that Jeanne had given her. Shelly believed her without any doubt. She even thanked her.

“Shelly.” Just as she was about to hang up the phone, Monica suddenly called out to her.

“What do you think of Nox now?”

Shelly pursed her lips. That question was not an easy one to comment on, especially in front of Nox’s friend.

“I think I know why you’re hesitating.” Monica sighed.

She believed Nox was going to get really hurt.

Instead of defending herself, Shelly said, “Sometimes, nothing can turn back time.”

He’ll come back when he’S done.”

“Alright.”

After hanging up the phone, Shelly felt a little relieved. After all, Nox had never disappeared so suddenly before. However, she looked around the empty room and suddenly felt a little… lonely..
