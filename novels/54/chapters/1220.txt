1221 Two Become One

Edward still did not respond, whereas Susan, who had come out with them, just smiled.

Since they did not react much, Alex naturally would not waste too much time on them. Anyway, Edward would understand sooner or later. With that, he turned around, got into the car, and left.

As soon as Alex left, the black bodyguards around him also left.

Edward looked in the direction of his car and turned back without any emotion.

At that moment, Susan reached out to hold Edward’s hand. However, Edward raised his hand and avoided her.

“Edward, if you can’t even act, we won’t be able to continue,” Susan said bluntly.

Edward’s expression darkened, but Susan stretched out her hand again and held Edward’s arm.

That was right. Their engagement was a win-win cooperation, and they both had their own agendas.

The two of them returned to the hall. With many people coming and going into the hall, their reappearance naturally became the focus of attention.

In fact, most of them did not expect Fourth Master Swan to fall in love with someone else so quickly. After all, Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne’s grand wedding was still a hot topic of discussion. Yet now, their marriage was over.

However, Fourth Master Swan’s status was much higher than before, so no one dared to say anything. Besides, Jeanne was dead, and a dead person would be forgotten sooner or later. Fourth Master Swan was just more rational than everyone else, so he accepted the new relationship quickly.

Everyone came forward to congratulate him.

In fact, Edward and Susan were a perfect match.

In the past, they had always thought that Edward and Jeanne were a match made in heaven, and it was difficult to find a more perfect couple than them. Now, because of Susan’s excellence, everyone gradually began to forget how Jeanne looked when she stood beside Edward. All they knew was that the two people in front of them did not seem out of place at all.

Everyone thought that except for George, whom his father had brought along to attend tonight’s banquet.

In the car, his father said he would have a new fiancée tonight.

George knew what a fiancée was. A fiancée was the one who was going to marry his father. In that case, what would his mother become?

His father said that that was the only way to protect their family and that he wanted George to accept the existence of another woman.

However, George would not accept it. He would not accept anyone else other than his mother, but his resistance was useless.

Tonight, he watched helplessly as his father and another woman walked intimately together.

When the banquet ended, there were fewer and fewer people in the hall until only Edward, Susan, George, and some staff were left.

After all, it was the state banquet tonight. Since Alex was not around, Edward had to be responsible for it.

In the eyes of the public, Edward was Alex’s spokesperson. Where Alex was needed and could not show up, Edward would take over.

In other words, Edward could represent Alex at any event. In places without Alex, his status was equivalent to Alex’s.

“Let’s go.” Edward walked toward George.

He basically did not spend any time on George tonight.

The only reason he had brought George to the event tonight was to increase George’s exposure and make him accept Susan’s existence. After all, in the future, they would have to interact with Susan more.

George did not hold Edward’s outstretched hand. Instead, he walked ahead of Edward. However, Edward did not mind and followed George while Susan followed behind them.

When the three of them walked out of the banquet hall, a luxurious black car was parked at the entrance.

At that moment, the chauffeur stood outside and opened the door for them respectfully. George got in first and then Susan.

Susan’s skirt was a little long, so Edward lifted it up for her like a gentleman and helped her into the car. After she was seated, Edward got in.

The driver closed the door for them before he quickly returned to the driver’s seat and drove away.

When they left, Edward looked out of the car and watched as the two paparazzi leave quickly. Then, he turned away.

He knew very well that it was Alex’s arrangement. Otherwise, ordinary paparazzi would not be able to be in such a place.

It was quiet in the car.

Amidst the silence, Susan suddenly said, “George.”

George leaned out of the window and ignored Susan. When he heard her call him, he pretended not to hear her.

“I’m Susan. You can call me Aunty Susan.” Susan took the initiative to get close to George.

Still, George did not respond.

“In the future, we’ll be spending a lot of time with each other.” Susan’s voice was gentle as she said, “So, you can try to accept me slowly.”

“I won’t.” George suddenly turned his head around.

George rarely lost his temper, and it was rare for him to look at someone with disgust. However, he was looking at Susan, and even Edward, with hostility.

“I won’t accept you. I’ll only accept my mother.” George was very determined, and there was anger in his tone.

Despite that, Susan did not get angry. Instead, she said, “You’ll accept me eventually.”

He would never!

George immediately turned his head to look out the window. He did not want to see the woman behind him or his father anymore.

When the car arrived at the Swans family’s courtyard and stopped at Bamboo Garden, Edward opened the car door and got out.

At that moment, Susan also got out of the car.

Meanwhile, George opened the car door on his side, got out of the car, and ran straight into the hall. He looked angry as if he did not want to see them for even a minute.

Edward watched George leave and said to Susan, “You should go back soon.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Yes.” Susan nodded.

The moment she nodded, she suddenly got close to Edward’s face and planted a kiss on his cheek.

She said, “You have to get used to my intimacy.”

Edward did not show any expression, and Susan had also expected Edward’s indifference.

...

The two of them had known each other for three to four months, and it was a miracle that Edward did not reject her approach. She was not arrogant enough to think that Edward would fall in love with her.

With that, she turned around and got into the car.

The moment she sat in the car, she glanced behind Edward. She had long noticed Jeanne standing by the floor-to-ceiling window in the hall.
