1108 Edward’s Choice

Jeanne did not give Monica an answer because there was none. No one could guarantee that they would not die in the next second.

She looked at Edward, who had already returned to the room.

She did not know what Edward had heard.

What would happen to him if he heard was not among the most important people? Perhaps only then would they no longer be a burden to each other.

After Edward returned, he did not say anything.

The two of them waited in silence in the room until it was time for the dinner banquet.

Edward and Jeanne were invited to a dinner banquet.

It was still the same people in the same banquet hall. Jeanne was still sitting next to Warren, and Warren was still doting on her.

At the banquet, it was a harmonious scene.

“By the way, Edward, you can communicate more with William in the future. You’re both in business, so you might have the chance to work together in the future.” Warren seemed to be helping both of them out, like an elder showing concern for his juniors.

“Yes, father.” William hurriedly agreed and said courteously, “Actually, I’ve had some dealings with Fourth Master in private. I believe that now we’re a family, we will cooperate even more in the future.”

“That’s good.” Warren was very pleased.

“Let me give a toast to Fourth Master and Jeannie. I’ve always had some business with Fourth Master, but I didn’t expect that we’d become a family one day,” William said very happily.

Edward and Jeanne raised their glasses as well. Edward said, “We should be the ones toasting you. We wish you a happy marriage.”

“Look at you two, you’ll be a family from now on,” Chester chimed in.

“Chester is right, and let’s drink to that! Cheers.” William drank first as a form of respect.

Edward and Jeanne also did the same.

Then, they put down their glasses.

As William was sitting beside Edward, and because the atmosphere had eased up, the two of them even exchanged a few words in a low voice. It looked like they had a good relationship, but in reality, socializing was normal in the business world and would not attract anyone’s attention.

The dinner was a short one.

When Warren noticed that Jeanne had not touched her food, he whispered in her ear, “Are you done eating?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Only then did Warren put down his utensils, and as soon as he did that, the others naturally stopped eating.

As he stood up, everyone at the table, and even everyone in the banquet hall, stood up. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Warren was used to that kind of respect. He said, “Come on. I’ll send you and Edward off.”

“Alright.” Jeanne got up and followed behind Warren.

Edward was naturally by Jeanne’s side.

Warren personally sent them to the main entrance of the Sanders’ residence.

He took Jeanne’s hand and said heavily, “Take good care of yourself and come home often.”

“Alright,” Jeanne agreed.

Warren looked at Edward again. “I’ll leave my precious daughter to you.”

“Father, don’t worry.”

“Go on.” Warren sounded a little helpless, and his expression looked a little sad.

Perhaps he was really sad. After all, that glance might be the last he took of her.

Warren turned around and left. As he left, he sighed and waved his hand.

Edward and Jeanne remained respectful.

After Warren was a distance away, Edward pulled Jeanne along and walked out of the Sanders’ residence, where a black car was parked.

Nox had stood guard for a day in the car.

When he saw Edward returning with Jeanne…

Jeanne Sanders was back.

Now, everyone in Harken knew that Jeanne was Warren’s daughter. Jeanne was the princess of the Sanders and had a distinguished status.

Nox sneered.

He knew that Jeanne was not a simple woman.

When he first investigated Jeanne’s background, he found it impossible for Jeanne’s mother to have fallen in love with Alexander Lawrence and be with him. There must be something hidden behind it. However, he found nothing useful in his investigation. Now, he seemed to understand why there was nothing. The Sanders had probably hidden everything a long time ago because they were afraid that Jeanne’s identity would be exposed.

In all of Harken, only the Sanders had the ability to destroy all the evidence to the point that he could not find anything.

“Nox, sit in the back,” Edward suddenly ordered.

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

At that moment, he saw Edward opening his car door.

As soon as Nox got out of the car, Edward pushed Jeanne into the front passenger seat.

Then, he closed the door and went to the driver’s seat. He said to the driver, “Sit in the back.”
