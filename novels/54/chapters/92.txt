Chapter 93: Counter Scheme

Eden Swan picked up his phone. “Joshua Lawrence.”

“Brother-in-law, did it work? Was Jeanne fuming in anger? I was so excited for the entire afternoon just thinking about it.” Joshua’s excitement was indescribable when he thought about Jeanne being chased out of the family.

Eden’s expression turned ugly at Joshua’s excitement. “Joshua Lawrence, are you sure you gave me the final proposal?”

“Yes, I gave you the proposal the moment I got it. Didn’t you remind me that there might be changes when it goes to the board of directors? You asked me to keep an eye on it, so I asked one of the board members. Jeanne’s proposal was approved by the board of directors, word for word.”

“Including the investment amount?”

“Yes.” Joshua was very certain.

“But right now, Jeanne’s investment amount is 2.2 billion.”

“That’s impossible!” Joshua Lawrence’s expression immediately changed to one in disbelief.

“It’s not impossible if it’s the truth. Jeanne Lawrence has secured the MUK proposal.”

“How could this happen?” Joshua could not accept the situation. He raised his voice and said, “Didn’t you say that Jeanne would be kicked out of the Lawrence Enterprise after this? You even told her to scram!”

“Enough! If not for the error in the message you sent me, would I have failed?” Eden was furious.

“I gave you the final proposal, I swear!” Joshua refused to let go.

“What’s the point of swearing? In the end, Jeanne succeeded, and we were all tricked by her!”

“I knew Jeanne wasn’t dumb. She’s a smart woman. You must have let your guard down. It must be your fault…”

“You’re blaming me? Joshua Lawrence, know your place. What right do you have to blame me?” Eden said in a menacing tone.

Joshua was so furious that he could not retort.

“Let me ask you one last time. Did the board of directors approve more than 2 billion for the investment?”

“I’m sure they did not!” Joshua said fiercely.

“Then Jeanne must have changed the documents after approval by the board of directors. If it’s her own doing, then this proposal will no longer be valid.”

“You mean, as long as we can confirm that the board of directors agreed to only 2 billion yuan instead of 2.2 billion yuan, the proposal would be a failure?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t get ahead of yourself. From Lawrence Enterprise’s point of view, if we can’t get an additional 200 million yuan for the proposal, we still wouldn’t land the contract. Therefore, we would still need to sign the final contract with MUK for 2.2 billion yuan.”

“Why are you telling me this? Are you trying to make me laugh?”

“Joshua Lawrence, have you really been working at the Lawrence Enterprise for a year?”

“I…” Joshua Lawrence was rendered speechless.

“What I mean is that Jeanne changed the investment amount on the proposal without the board of director’s approval. This is considered a violation of the rules. Although she managed to get the contract in the end, her actions were vile. You can use this against her and incite the board of directors to oppose Jeanne. Otherwise, she would be promoted to marketing director in return for securing the contract. This way, even if we can’t make Jeanne Lawrence leave Lawrence Enterprise, we won’t let her have such a high position within the company. Once Jeanne Lawrence secures her position as marketing director, it’ll be even harder for us to oust her!”

“Are we really not going to kick Jeanne out?” Joshua was still unconvinced.

“Making sure Jeanne is not the marketing director is the best thing you can do!” Eden didn’t say anything else and hung up.

His eyes turned cold.

‘Jeanne Lawrence… You got lucky this time!’

…

Jeanne returned to the Lawrence Enterprise.

As soon as she entered her office, Amy said anxiously, “Team Leader Lawrence, the chairman is looking for you. He asked you to go to his office immediately.”

Jeanne was calm in the face of Amy’s excitement.

She knew why.

It was just an additional 200 million yuan. Someone must have informed them beforehand.

She responded, “Make me a cup of coffee.”

“Hmm?” Amy looked at her.

“I’d like some coffee before I go.”

“…Yes.” Amy said and left.

She admired Jeanne’s composure that brimmed with confidence.
