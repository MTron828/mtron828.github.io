1395 Nox and Shelly Meet Again

Monica nodded and agreed with Brandon’s arrangements.

Brandon’s lips curled into a smile, even though Monica did not notice it.

“Is there anything else?” Monica frowned when she saw that Brandon had not left.

“There’s a dinner party tonight. The pharmaceutical company from Europe has invited you to dinner, so it’s up to you whether you want to attend or reject the invite.”

“Hasn’t he invited me many times now?”

“Yes, and you’ve rejected him many times,” Brandon said bluntly.

“I don’t have anything on tonight, so I’ll go.”

“Alright.” Brandon said, “I will just be him and his assistant from his side, and from ours–”

“It’ll just be the two of us. Also, give them a heads up that they should act within their means with the alcohol.”

“Yes.”

Having reported his work, Brandon was prepared to leave.

The moment he left, he paused again and said, “If you don’t like this bouquet of flowers, you can give it to me.”

Monica frowned and looked at Brandon.

“As your subordinate, I’m willing to share your problems.”

Monica smiled.

Brandon had been behaving himself for the past month. Even after she rejected him, he did not pester her anymore. Their interaction this month was purely for work.

It made her feel that Brandon was a trustworthy person, and naturally, she had a good impression of him.

It was not a romantic relationship, but she found that interacting with Brandon was very easy and relaxing. That feeling was completely different from when she was with Finn.

She said, “Take it.”

“Alright.” Brandon happily carried the bouquet of red roses away and placed them in his office.

He looked at them and thought they looked pretty. Finn must have put in a lot of effort. However… it was all too late.

He now believed that Monica had no feelings for Finn.

With that, Brandon took out his phone and took a few photos of the flowers.

Then, he typed a Facebook post, which said, “Thank you for your commendation, Chairman. I will work harder.”

He also attached a photo to the post. He was sure that if Finn saw it, Finn would be furious.

On one hand, the post was to make Finn give up on Monica completely, and on the other, it was to take revenge on Finn for hurting and bullying Monica to the point that she was afraid of falling in love.

After he sent it, he contacted paid Facebook to boost his traffic on the post because he wanted Finn to see it, and Finn did see it.

That was because he had quite some spare time recently, and when he had nothing to do, he would read a lot of things on his phone. That was when he was caught off guard bt Brandon’s Facebook post.

He looked at the bouquet of flowers. He had wrapped it himself, so he knew it was the bouquet he had given Monica.

At that, his expression turned ugly.

He thought that Monica would throw it away. However, he did not expect Monica would turn around and give it to another man, who was Brandon!

Suddenly, his phone rang, so Finn tried his best to calm himself down.

He picked up the call. “Nox.”

“What’s wrong? Are you in a bad mood?” Nox could tell the change in Finn’s mood from their years of interaction.

“What’s the matter?” Finn did not answer, but his tone was unusually cold.

Nox did not even need to think to know that Finn must have suffered a lot of “humiliation” while pursuing Monica.

Initially, he felt sorry for Finn. After all, Finn had loved Monica for so many years, yet Monica left the relationship just like that.

However, for some reason, he felt good at that moment. Making a man like Finn, who had never changed and was always calm, anxious was not necessarily a bad thing.

Sometimes, he felt that Finn was too rational and lacked a bit of humanity. It was as if he was a zombie and only lived for the sake of living.

At that thought, Nox realized that Monica was very patient to have been able to be in a relationship with Finn for so many years. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“George’s birthday is on Sunday. Edward just called me and said that he’s going to Zhu Qin Garden on Sunday to celebrate George’s birthday.”

“Isn’t George usually not at home for his birthday?” Finn was surprised.

“I heard it was Candice’s idea,” Nox said, still feeling a little upset. “That woman is quite capable, and I think Edward has really fallen in love with her. She is the second woman Edward has fallen in love with after Jeanne. After so many years, I thought that Edward would never fall in love again.”
