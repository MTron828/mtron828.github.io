Misunderstanding, Shelly Laughing Like a Goose

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Did that mean Finn was rich?

“If you like it, I can give it all to you.” Finn said seriously, “I’m not interested in money.”

Monica was speechless.

Although she was already worth hundreds of billions, she would never dare to say that she was not interested in money. She was more than interested in money, yet Finn could say otherwise so matter-of-factly.

“Monica, let’s not suspect each other and keep things bottled up anymore. From now on, we have to tell each other everything, okay?” Finn said affectionately, “I really don’t want us to lose each other again.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

She, too, did not want to lose him or have any misunderstandings between them again. On second thought, it was not easy for them to be together again after separating so many times. Since they had come a long way, they had to cherish each other.

Finn returned to the driver’s seat and was still driving at the speed of a turtle. However, as he drove, Monica felt that the guy was a little abnormal as he would smile out of the blue and very strangely at that.

Was he possessed?

Monica could not help but ask him, “Finn, are you alright?”

Finn had a wide smile on his face as he said, “I’m fine. What’s wrong?”

“What’s wrong? Do you know how scary it is when you start smiling without context? What the hell are you smiling at?” “No, I’m not.” Finn denied it. “I’m not smiling.”

“Do you think I’m blind?”

“What are you hiding from me again?” Monica got angry.

If Finn had any thoughts, that sentence could directly make Finn submit to her.

With that, he said, “It just suddenly crossed my mind that I’m your only man…” When he said it, his smile widened.

F*ck. Did he have to be so happy over such a small thing? Did he not say he had gotten over it? Did he not say that he did not care at all?

At the hospital, Nox was lying on a VIP bed, staring at the ceiling in despair.

He did not even dare to take out his phone as he was afraid that his hands would betray him and that he tap open the news to watch it. As for the news, it was obvious what they would write.

“Ahhh!” Nox screamed.

At the thought that he had become the laughingstock of the entire country, he really wished he was dead. How could he still live in this world after being so humiliated? He did not deserve to live.

“Mr. Winter, what’s wrong?” The door was pushed open, and the nurse rushed in worriedly.

She had probably heard the cry of Nox’s cry, so she barged in. However, she was a little stunned when she saw Nox lying on the bed.

“It’s nothing.” Nox did not even look at the nurse. “Get out.”

“Mr. Winter, don’t take things too hard,” the nurse could not help but say with concern.

“Get out!” Nox did not want to talk to anyone. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

So what if he could not take it anymore? Even if he wanted to take things too hard, he would lock himself in a sealed space for the rest of his life. He did not want anyone to care about him or disturb him.

“Mr. Winter…”

“I told you to get out of here…”

Suddenly, he held his tongue because he saw his grandfather. Seeing that old man, Nox almost fainted from anger again. Hence, he looked at the old man and then turned around to face his back to him.

He had sworn to ignore his grandfather for the rest of his life. Since the latter could be so heartless, he would stop caring about him. He had thought it through very carefully, and his decision was firm.

Nox’s back was facing his grandfather, and he refused to turn around and look at him until..

“Ah!” Nox shouted, “Why are you poking my head?”

Nox turned around and shouted at Wade. He was baffled as to why his grandfather would poke the big bump on his head. Did he have a death wish?

“I wanted to see if it was soft or hard,” Wade replied frankly.

‘F*ck you!’ Nox cursed to himself.

He would know if he fell! Was his grandfather here to make things difficult for him? Did he think that he had not pissed Nox off enough yet and wanted to stab him in the heart again?

“Get out. I don’t want to see you again. From now on, our relationship as grandfather and grandson is severed. I’ll pretend that I don’t have you as my grandfather anymore! ” Nox said agitatedly..
