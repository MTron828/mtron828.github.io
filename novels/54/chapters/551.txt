Chapter 552: Sowing Discord Between The Lawrences

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In Jonathan’s study in the Lawrence family’s manor, Jeanne gave Jonathan a list of people.

Jonathan read it very carefully.

Jeanne said seriously, “Grandpa, the position changes you ordered earlier hasn’t made any progress so far. Dad hasn’t paid much attention to this matter, and the company’s human resources don’t dare to offend him, so the position change has been put on hold.”

Jonathan’s expression was a little dark.

He probably also had some resentment toward Alexander for failing to live up to his expectations.

After so many years, not only had Alexander not made any achievements, but he had also been holding the family back from growing stronger.

“What do you want to say?” Jonathan looked at Jeanne.

Based on his current understanding of Jeanne, she would not have come all the way here to deliberately sow discord as she did not have the time to do so.

“Although the e-commerce project with MUK Group struggled a little in the beginning, it’s on the right track now. If all goes according to our expectation, we can get our capital back in three years.”

“You want me to praise you?” Jonathan raised his eyebrows.

“It’ll be my honor to be able to receive Grandpa’s praise.” Jeanne did not put up any pretense. “What I want to express more is that this project no longer requires too much attention and that it can now develop in the right direction. So, I can take time out to do other things.”

“You want to rearrange the positions in the senior management?” Jonathan hit the nail on the head.

Jeanne did not hide her motive from Jonathan. “Yes. I very much support Grandpa’s decision of wanting to change things around in the company. I, too, think there’s a huge problem with the company’s previous operations. Many senior managers are too comfortable in their positions, and there’s no drive or no sense of crisis. It feels like they’re just muddling through the work. I think this is the main reason Lawrence Enterprise’s market share has not been high.”

Jonathan nodded, agreeing with Jeanne’s view on things.

After all, Jeanne’s view was based on his view, and he could not refute his own views.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was getting better at using her words and knowing what he wanted.

Jeanne continued, “Actually, grandfather, I don’t think switching up the positions among the senior managers is the only thing you want. I think you want to change Lawrence Enterprise’s current state. I don’t want to slander my father in front of you, but he is really too content with the current situation. He doesn’t have the decisiveness of a leader when it comes to matters, nor can he put his foot down. Most importantly, his management skills are too weak. He can immediately convey the requirements of the company to the employees, but he doesn’t have closed-loop management. Every time he passes on the matter, there’s no follow-up, and as time passes, he will lose his authority in the company.”

Jonathan had been finding fault with Alexander all these years, yet he still could not figure out how Alexander, whom he had taught to manage the company, led the company to such a mess. In fact, Alexander’s execution skills were not weak. Once he gave an instruction, he would immediately implement it. However, now that Jeanne reminded him, he seemed to have found Alexander’s weakness.

He said, “Go on.”

Jeanne nodded. “I went a little off track just now. Let me get back to the main topic. Changing positions among senior management doesn’t change much in the company. When the senior managers change to a new position or role, they will learn more about the new field, which may inspire and motivate them again. However, for most people who have become lazy, motivation is only temporary. It can only last a week, one month, or three months. In reality, it can’t change Lawrence Enterprise’s current situation at all!”

“If you have any thoughts, just say them.” Jonathan listened to Jeanne’s suggestion with a serious expression.

At that, Jeanne did not beat around the bush. “Rather than changing the positions, it’s better to change the person.”

Jonathan was stunned for two seconds.

After all, it was not that he had not thought about it. In fact, he had considered it over and over again but just did not dare to take the risk.

He did not dare to say that he wanted to fire his existing senior managers and hire new ones!

“I know your concern is that if we change the person, Lawrence Enterprise will be affected. After all, the current senior management still has influence over their department. And if we reduce the number of staff, it’ll cause a great negative impact on Lawrence Enterprise. The gains will not make up for the losses. Moreover, I have to say some among the senior management hold the original shares of the company, so they can also be considered a shareholder. We can’t offend them.”

“Since you’ve considered it, why would you still think that way?” Jonathan was not questioning her. On the contrary, he hoped Jeanne had a reasonable way to do so.
