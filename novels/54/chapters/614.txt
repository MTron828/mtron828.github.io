Chapter 615: How Could Finn Forget Me So Easily?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

Jeanne pulled Monica’s hand. “I’ll explain it to you after I’m done with my grandfather’s funeral.”

Although Monica was unwilling to wait, she knew it was not a good time for Jeanne to explain it all to her at the moment.

Hence, she nodded reluctantly. “Don’t try to fool me.”

“I promise.”

Monica had just let go of Jeanne, but the next second, she thought of something, and her expression changed. “Speaking of which, your father doing that to your grandfather...”

Just that thought made her hair stand on end, yet Jeanne was calm. Had she kept it to herself the entire time?

She found Jeanne pitiful, to have to endure everything on her own. If she were to encounter such a thing, or if her father did that…

She touched wood.

Her father was not like that. Her father was the most filial and the best person in the world.

“I’m fine,” Jeanne said indifferently.

Monica looked at her helplessly.

Her face was full of heartache.

Jeanne was speechless.

However, she hugged Monica and seemed to be comforting her. “I’ll explain it to you one day. You’ll understand that I’m fine.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

“I have to go and sort things out now, and you should go back and rest early. You didn’t sleep last night.”

“I want to stay with you.”

“Be good. Come back after you’ve had some rest. I’ll take a while here.”

At that point, Michael also went forward and naturally hugged Monica’s shoulder.

Since Monica’s leg had been injured recently, and she was already used to Michael’s actions, she did not push him away.

Michael said, “Indeed. If you injure your leg again, Jeannie will have to take care of you. Don’t make things difficult for Jeannie. Be good. I’ll bring you back and send you here once you’ve had some rest.”

“Listen to Michael.” Jeanne’s attitude was firm.

Monica finally nodded. “In that case, I’ll come over after I wake up.”

“Okay.”

Monica made a move with Michael. However, she could not help but glance at Finn, who was not far away and did not look like he was going to leave.

As she expected, his gaze was not on her at all.

With that, she lowered her head and left together with Michael.

In Michael’s car, Monica was in a low mood.

When they arrived, she was still ranting and cursing endlessly. Now that she had left, Monica should be very happy. Yet, at that moment, she was suddenly so quiet.

Actually, Michael knew why.

It was because of Finn’s coldness toward her.

However, he naturally would not bring it up. Hence, he found another topic to talk about. “I didn’t think Old Man Lawrence would die like that.”

Monica came back to her senses. Michael’s words had attracted her attention, and she hurriedly said, “What did Jeannie do to get such a father? You don’t know how miserable Jeanne was when he almost beat her to death. But no matter what, at least she didn’t end up sad and crazy. Oh, poor Jeannie.”

Michael did not have many feelings about it. He just found Jeanne a little too calm. It was as if everything was within her expectations.

The woman seemed to have returned to the country, after seven years, a different person. She was no longer as innocent as she was before.

What was she hiding?

“Michael,” Monica called out to Michael twice.

Michael was a little lost in his thoughts. He said, “What’s wrong?”

“In the future, you don’t have to pick me up or send me anywhere. I can go by myself,” Monica said.

Michael’s smile looked a little dejected. “I’m sorry to put you in a difficult position.”

“No, it’s just...” Monica did not want to hurt Michael either, but... She gritted her teeth. “You have put me in a difficult position. In the future, we should try our best not to show up together. We should slowly fade out of people’s sight so we can separate later.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Okay,” Michael agreed.

He always agreed to her words immediately, and Monica would always feel uneasy if she rejected Michael.

In fact, she did not do anything unpardonable to Michael. On the contrary, she had made a great sacrifice for him. Yet, for some reason, she still believed she was not good enough for Michael.

She endured it and did not say anything more.

When the car arrived at Monica’s apartment building, Michael got out of the car out of habit.

“I’ll get out of the car myself.” Monica stopped him.

Michael was stunned.

“Hurry up and go to work,” Monica urged.

At that moment, she opened the car door and got out of the car.

As if she was afraid that he would catch up to her, she quickly walked into the elevator.

Michael’s expression was a little ugly.
