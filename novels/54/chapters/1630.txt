Chapter 1631: Shelly Recordes a Video to Clear Nox l s Name

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

If Nox did not want her to do something to clear his name, she would have avoided the conflict between Zoe and Nox since no one would be able to recognize her. Despite that, Nox still came looking for her.

“Come downstairs in ten minutes. I’ll pick you up,” Nox said and hung up the phone.

Shelly looked at her phone in silence and slowly took a deep breath, appearing very calm.

Then, she called Sarah and asked if she could send Bella over so that Sarah could take care of Bella for half a day. As Sarah did not go to work today, she agreed immediately. She even said that she missed Bella.

After sorting out Bella, Shelly changed into a simple set of clothes and brought Bella downstairs, where a black car was waiting. Shelly sat in with Bella in her arms, and Nox was sitting in the backseat.

The moment Shelly carried Bella and sat down, Bella saw Nox and burst into tears. Nox frowned and glared at Bella, who felt Nox’s gaze and cried even harder.

Shelly quickly coaxed Bella. “Don’t cry, don’t cry. I’ll take you to your

godmother’s house, and we’ll be there soon.”

“I don’t like this uncle. I don’t want to see this uncle…” Bella did not hide her thoughts and continued to cry and make a fuss.

“Be good. You won’t see this uncle when you’re at your godmother’s house.” Shelly coaxed Bella, “If you don’t want to see him, lie in my arms with your eyes closed. That way, you won’t see the uncle.”

Bella’s eyes were filled with tears. She was not a willful child, to begin with. Hence, upon hearing her mother’s words, she obediently leaned into her mother’s embrace and shut her eyes tightly. As expected, she could not see that uncle anymore, and her sobbing instantly stopped.

Shelly looked at Bella in her arms and suddenly felt a little envious of Bella because she did not want to see Nox either. She wished she could close her eyes and think that she could not see Nox and that Nox could not see her too.

Meanwhile, Nox sat at the side and looked out the window, his expression ugly. To him, Shelly’s daughter was just as annoying as Shelly!

The car arrived at Sarah’s neighborhood first. Sarah was already waiting for her at the entrance downstairs, so she carried Bella down and handed her to Sarah. Sarah looked at the black car behind Shelly in surprise. ‘Who’s in the car?”

Shelly did not answer her directly. Instead, she said, “I’ll pick Bella up tonight. There are some things to take note of after Bella’s ear surgery, and I’ve sent them to your phone.”

Sarah looked at Shelly closely, scrutinizing her. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Shelly simply smiled. “Thank you.”

Sarah wanted to ask something, but Shelly waved her hand and left, not wanting anyone to worry about her.

When she returned to the car, Nox glanced at Shelly and told the driver to start the car. The two of them did not say a word to each other, and it was so silent in the car that it was as if the air was frozen.

The car drove into a hotel. As it was the most luxurious hotel in South Hampton City, no paparazzi could enter.

Nox brought Shelly to a room. As soon as she entered the room, she saw a few cameras waiting for her. It seemed Nox had invited a public relations team.

When Shelly went in, a man handed her a few sheets of paper filled with words and said, “This is the script. Memorize it.”

Shelly nodded and took a look at it.

At that moment, Nox was already sitting on the sofa in front of the French window with a good view. He was just waiting leisurely for someone to do his public relations for him.

“Has Nox read it?” Shelly asked the man in front of her.

It was not that she had any objections to the lines, but she was just afraid that it would be useless. If she memorized the whole thing and Nox thought it was not good enough, it would be a waste of her time.

“Of course,” the man replied. “If Mr. Winter didn’t agree, we naturally wouldn’t dare to have you read it.”

“Alright, give me ten minutes.” After getting a positive answer, Shelly immediately agreed.

“Are you sure you can memorize it in ten minutes?” The man raised his eyebrows in disbelief.

Ten minutes was more than enough time. She was just giving herself insurance.

With that, she nodded and walked to a corner. She was leaning against a corner far away from Nox, memorizing her lines numbly, just like when she was taught in language class back then.

She had always had a good memory. Usually, she would be able to memorize it after reading it through a few times..
