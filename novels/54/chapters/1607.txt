“I can get over it,” Finn suddenly said.

Monica was stunned as she suddenly could not hear what Finn was saying.

Finn pursed his lips and held back from saying what he wanted to say. However, Monica could clearly see that Finn wished to say something but hesitated. What was that guy hiding from her? Monica frowned. “Finn, what are you trying to say?”

“It’s nothing.”

“Finn, you clearly have something to say!” Monica complained.

Finn’s throat moved slightly. “No.”

“Do you still have the habit of hiding things from me? Do you still think that there are many things you don’t need to let me know?” Monica mocked.

She felt a little upset. She thought that since she had reconciled with Finn, the two of them would put their past behind them and start over, or had she expected too much from Finn?

Upon noticing the change in Monica’s mood, Finn explained, “Monica, I’m not trying to hide anything from you, but I’ve really let go of this matter.” “It’s okay. If you don’t want to say it, forget it.” Monica even smiled.

She seemed to have become that woman who kept quiet again, and Finn started to panic.

He did not say anything to her not because he wanted to hide things from her, but because he believed that since the matter was over, he would not hold it against her. However, he did not expect her to misunderstand him again.

He took a deep breath and said, “When we broke up, didn’t you often have sex with other men?”

Monica was shocked by Finn’s sudden words. At the same time, she was dumbfounded as to what he was saying. Who did she have sex with?

“What I mean is, although my situation is different from Nox’s, and you only did it after we broke up, because we were still in love back then, the feelings that were hurt were the same. However, it’s been so many years, and I’ve never really taken it to heart. Don’t think too much about it. I’m not that narrowminded,” Finn explained as he spoke, afraid that Monica would misunderstand him.

Monica looked straight at Finn, and in the end, she finally figured it out. Back then, in order to successfully leave Michael and re-develop Cardellini Pharmaceutical, she deliberately created a lot of negative news about herself and bumped into Finn a few times when she was entertaining guests. She could not believe he was still brooding over it after so many years!

“Do you mind?” Monica asked with a very certain tone.

“I don’t.”

“If you don’t, why do you still remember it?” Monica asked.

“It just crossed my mind when I thought about Nox. Nox will recover after some time.”

“If you really don’t mind, you wouldn’t have thought of it.” Monica looked certain.

Finn did not know how to retort, and he looked a little helpless. “I didn’t want to say it, but you were the one who made me say it. And now that I’ve told you, you don’t believe me.”

Monica was speechless. Hence, no matter what, it was still her fault.

She looked at Finn as if she had something to say but suddenly changed her mind. Maybe she should not tell him the truth and let him stay disgusted for the rest of his life.

Silence filled the car. Amidst the silence, Finn said faintly, “Am I really that bad?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Monica was stunned. She did not know what was wrong with the guy.

“In bed.

She surely could not compliment him on that.

“Compared to those people, am I horrible?” Finn asked.

She could not hear his tone, but in any case, by those people, did he mean the people she had ‘slept with’ before? Monica could not help but laugh.

Finn saw Monica laughing through the rearview mirror and thought she was mocking him. He felt that being cheated on would hurt the same as being told that he was not good in bed.

Finn’s grip on the steering wheel tightened.

“How do you know you’re not good?” Monica was suddenly very curious. She was a little angry just a moment ago, and now, she somehow felt better.

Finn, however, did not answer.

“I thought men wouldn’t notice it themselves,” Monica said faintly.

Finn’s face darkened. Indeed, he did not realize it himself. He thought… Forget it. Finn told himself that a real gentleman would not fuss over it with a pregnant woman.

He said, “I overheard your conversation with Jeanne the last time..”
