Chapter 185: Sleep Together

Nox left the room and kindly closed the door for Edward and Jeanne.

Suddenly, only the two of them were left in the room.

Fourth Master Swan was lying on his stomach on the bed. In fact, his sleeping posture was a little comical.

He was not wearing a shirt, but his back was fully bandaged. It could be considered a shirt.

As for his lower body, he was wearing black suit pants. There seemed to be blood stains on them.

“Ms. Lawrence, if you’re kind enough, you can help me change my clothes and wipe my body,” Edward said straightforwardly.

‘Does he not feel shy at all?!

‘Shouldn’t he have a proper attitude when he’s asking others to do something?!

‘Why does he make it sound like it’s a matter of course?’

Jeanne was unhappy, but she did not refuse.

She went to the cloakroom to find a pair of loose pajama pants and went to the bathroom to wring a hot towel.

Afterward, she squatted on Fourth Master Swan’s bed and unbuckled his belt.

Fourth Master Swan lay on the bed, as heavy as a lump of iron.

Jeanne saw that he was seriously injured and was not going to let him get up by himself. She could only reach for his waist and fumble around to help him unbuckle his belt…

After a long time, she finally helped him change his pants.

His original pants were black. After she took them off, she saw that there were many red blood stains on them. Even his light gray bed sheet was stained with blood.

After changing his pants, she helped him wipe his thighs.

The white towel was also stained red.

Following that, she helped him put on his new pants.

“Ms. Lawrence, you seemed to have forgotten a spot,” the man said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne bit her lip.

She suddenly went deeper.

“...”

After a long time, Jeanne helped Fourth Master Swan put on his pants.

Once she was done, her face was red.

The man was lying on the bed with his face on the side on the pillow. Surprisingly, his exposed ear seemed to be red as well…

Jeanne did not pay too much attention to it.

She hurriedly ran to the bathroom and threw away the towel. Then, she washed her hands and washed them hard.

She felt that her hands would rot one day.

After a while, Jeanne calmed herself down.

She found a brand new towel, wrung the hot water, and walked out.

There were many wounds on Edward’s upper body, and she did not dare to touch the area that had been bandaged, so at this moment, she only helped him wipe his face.

Fourth Master Swan closed his eyes.

Jeanne was considered gentle.

She gently helped him wipe his forehead, eyebrows, eyes, straight nose bridge, as well as his lips that could make one have countless fantasies.

She had to admit that Fourth Master Swan was really handsome.

Some people did not have nice facial features but looked decent overall.

Some people had nice facial features but might not be good-looking.

Fourth Master Swan was the type of person who had good facial features and looked better as a whole.

It was true that every facial feature of his seemed to be meticulously carved.

Even the way Fourth Master Swan was taking a nap at this moment had a different charm to it.

“Do you like it?” Edward asked.

He did not open his eyes as if he knew that she was sizing him up.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

She rubbed his face a little rudely and did not answer.

Edward did not ask further.

It was as if he was used to Jeanne being cold and indifferent to him.

He really did not care.

At this moment, he was just quietly enjoying her special service.

After a while, Jeanne confirmed that she had wiped him clean and stood up to leave.

“Ms. Lawrence.” The man who was enjoying himself with his eyes closed suddenly spoke again.

Jeanne frowned.

“Give me a kiss,” Edward said matter-of-factly.

‘Is it natural for men not to be embarrassed?!’

Jeanne felt a little angry.

She could not be bothered.

She left immediately.

Fourth Master Swan opened his eyes and watched her leave.

As he looked at her, the corners of his mouth suddenly curved into a smile.

Jeanne came out of the bathroom.

After she came out, she wanted to leave immediately.

After all, she still had a lot of things to do. She could not be delayed by Fourth Master Swan’s beauty…

Beauty?

She was just threatened.

She walked toward the door.

“Ms. Lawrence, you’d better think it through. Can you really walk out of this door?” Edward’s tone was flat, but it made one’s heart tremble.

Jeanne glared fiercely at Fourth Master Swan.

“If you can’t, sleep with me for a while.” Fourth Master Swan looked very calm.

Jeanne told herself that she could not go head to head with him.

She had tried, but she could not.

As such, she gritted her teeth and got onto Fourth Master Swan’s bed, lying beside him.

“Come over a little,” Edward said.

Jeanne endured it and moved her body.

“Come over a little more.”

Jeanne continued to move.

“It’s not enough...”

Jeanne directly threw herself into his embrace.

Someone was satisfied.
