Chapter 672: Conspiracy Theory: She Can Only Belong To Him!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“He is indeed different.” Jeanne went along with Joshua. “After all, Eden has been chased out of the Swan Enterprise by the Swans, so he definitely has to find something to do. Otherwise, won’t the image of the diligent, hardworking, and outstanding Eldest Young Master Swan be destroyed?”

“Jeanne!” Joshua was fuming.

Jeanne said, “Chairman, is there anything else? If not, I was just holding a meeting with the senior management when you called me away halfway through. I still have to rush back to arrange the relevant work.”

It meant that Joshua was wasting her time.

Joshua suppressed his anger and said, “Meeting adjourned!”

After saying this, he left with Jenifer.

With that, the other shareholders left the meeting room one after another.

Jeanne also followed the crowd out, and when she returned to her office, her expression changed.

Eden must want to work at Lawrence Enterprise with ill intentions.

She did not think Eden could take the Lawrence Enterprise away from her. However, in comparison, dealing with Joshua and Lin Qingwen alone was better than dealing with Eden alone. However, she did not expect that considering how strained Jasmine and Eden’s relationship was, Jenifer could still trust Eden just for the sake of benefits.

Did that family have no conscience?

Yes! If not, the Lawrences would not have fallen to such a state!

Jeanne picked up the phone. “Amy, come in for a moment.”

“Yes.”

The most important thing now was to get the company through this tough period.

As for those who harbored ill intentions… In any case, only death awaits all of them!

…

In Purple Pavilion Garden in the Swan family’s manor, Eden’s expression was hideous after he hung up the phone.

Although he managed to get into Lawrence Enterprise, he would be taking the position of deputy general manager, which made him feel uncomfortable.

Jeanne was walking all over him because he had never taken her seriously.

At the thought of Jeanne, who looked so sorry in front of him seven years ago, above him in every way, he could not treat that woman calmly.

He absolutely could not let Jeanne grow her career, for he could not stand that the woman he had once abandoned was now so smug.

His face was grim as he looked at the sudden call and answered it. “Michael.”

It had been a while since they contacted each other.

Ever since Melody’s incident, they both barely kept in contact. Moreover, Michael had also suffered some suppression during this, and he did not know if Michael could rise up again. Hence, he chose to wait and see. Fortunately, Michael was back on the right track, and he could continue to make friends with Michael.

“What have you been busy with recently?” Michael asked.

“After my Fourth Uncle kicked me out of Swan Enterprise, I’ve been trying to prove myself at home.”

“Haven’t you thought about doing something?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What do you have in mind?” Eden did not tell Michael that he would be working at Lawrence Enterprise.

“Lawrence Enterprise is in great turmoil now, and as the son-in-law of the Lawrences, shouldn’t you lend them a hand?”

Eden smiled. “As expected, you want everything.”

“So you’ve already done that?” the person on the other end of the phone asked.

There was a trace of cruelty in his eyes.

It seemed like that man, Eden, could be saved.

“Yes. The only thing I’m a little unhappy about is that I’ll be Jeanne’s deputy!”

“Actually, there’s nothing to be angry about. Jeanne is currently developing Lawrence Enterprise, and it’s not wrong for the shareholders to trust Jeanne more. You should have gone for the deputy position anyway. That way, you can show that you only want to help the Lawrences tide over the difficult times and win yourself a greater reputation.”

“I, on the other hand... didn’t think so far.” In front of Michael, Eden was indeed slightly inferior.

“It’s not too late to think about it now. When you start work, put yourself on the news and state your position.” Michael gave him an idea.

“Okay.”

“There’s one more thing I want to discuss with you,” Michael said. It was obvious in his tone that the next part was the main point.

“What is it?” Eden’s face was serious.

“Quinn Sanders is working at the Lawrence Enterprise. You should know that, right?”

“I do. I mean, who in Harken doesn’t know that the princess of the Sanders has gone to work at Lawrence Enterprise?” Eden was a little sarcastic.

Jeanne was really bold to accept such an important figure into the company!

“Don’t you think this is an opportunity? Or perhaps it’s fate.”

“What do you mean?” Eden did not understand what Michael was trying to say.

Sometimes, what Michael could think of, he might not have thought of.

“Quinn is the most capable one out of the Sanders’ three princesses. If you can get involved with her, don’t you think your life will change?” Michael said bluntly, “Weren’t you suppressed by your Fourth Uncle some time ago? If you have a relationship with the Sanders, don’t you think your Fourth Uncle would show you some respect?”
