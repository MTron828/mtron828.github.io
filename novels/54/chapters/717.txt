She did not want to be lectured by Mason after being lectured by Kingsley.

Mason looked at Jeanne coldly.

However, Jeanne changed the topic. “What did Kingsley instruct you to do earlier today?”

“Go to the airport to follow Fourth Master Swan,” Mason said straightforwardly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“Mr. Thorn predicted that Fourth Master Swan would return to South Hampton City today, so he told me to wait at the airport to monitor who returned from the old and remote town.” Mason said, “However, only Fourth Master Swan and Nox came out of the airport. There was no third person.”

“Fourth Master Swan wouldn’t be so stupid to bring this person around so brazenly,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“However, Mr. Thorn didn’t want to let go of any opportunity to find the Duncans’ descendant. He wanted to find this person as soon as possible. At the end of the day, he just wants to relieve the pressure off you.”

Jeanne glanced at Mason.

“Mr. Thorn said you’re very bothered about Lucy’s death and wants me to advise you.”

“Are you like Kingsley, who feels nothing about Lucy’s death?”

“No.” Mason directly denied it.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“We’re just better at disguising ourselves than you are,” Mason said.

Jeanne pursed her lips in reply.

“Lucy has been by Mr. Thorn’s side for the longest time. In all these years, have you ever seen a second woman so close to him? If it weren’t for his absolute trust, Mr. Thorn wouldn’t have allowed a woman to be so close to him and stay by his side for so long. To Mr. Thorn, Lucy was indispensable. However, Mr. Thorn can’t be sad about Lucy’s sudden death because he’s the head of the Hills. He doesn’t have the right to be sad for any assassin. He can’t let anyone see his weakness or his pity! Otherwise, the Hills would be easily invaded by the outside world!” Mason said, “This is one of Mr. Thorn’s existences.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At that moment, she was rendered speechless by Mason’s words.

“Jeanne, Mr. Thorn treats you really well. I have followed him for so many years, but I’ve never seen him treat anyone like this. Even if you’re his biological niece, there’s no need for him to treat you like this. The Hills can never show their feelings or emotion, but time and time again, he has broken the rules with you. If Mr. Thorn dies one day, he will die for you!” Mason said, “So, in this world, you have the least right to say that he’s cold-blooded and heartless.”

With that said, Mason turned around and left.

The moment he opened the door, he turned around and said, “By the way, if you die in South Hampton City, I, Miles, and a few other assassins in the dark will all die because of you.”

“Mason,” Jeanne called out to him. “Am I not a qualified assassin?”

“Mr. Thorn has never trained you as an assassin,” Mason replied.

Jeanne looked at him.

“Otherwise, you wouldn’t still have such feelings.” Mason said bluntly, “Mr. Thorn couldn’t bear to destroy your humanity.”

Jeanne had always thought that Kingsley was grooming her as an assassin.

However, the grooming failed a little.

As if he had seen through Jeanne’s thoughts, Mason said, “Mr. Thorn has never failed in grooming an assassin.”

Jeanne was shocked.

For a long time, she actually thought that Kingsley was very cruel to her. He was cruel to tell her the true cause of her mother’s death, which had not allowed her to get over her mother’s death after so long. Moreover, Kingsley had taught her how to kill people…

Her eyes turned red for some reason.

She had no choice but to admit that Mason had convinced her.

Kingsley treated her very well. Otherwise, she would not have been among those people. The only person she trusted was him!

However, she really could not accept Lucy’s death. No matter how hard she tried to pretend, she still felt bad about it.

She had seen many assassins from the Hills who never returned. However, because it was only a name or a code name, it did not affect her much. To her, their deaths felt like the sudden death of a distant relative that she was not familiar with, and she would not feel too sad about the person’s death. However, Lucy was really different.

After hearing about the cause of her death, it was the first time she truly felt that the death of an assassin could be so... worthless.
