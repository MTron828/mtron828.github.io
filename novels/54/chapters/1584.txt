“But I thought you understood.” Mrs. Winter was embarrassed and hurt.

Shelly looked at Mrs. Winter. ‘So what if I didn’t understand? What can you do about that?’

Back then, when she was in a car accident and her life was on the line, everyone in the Winters came to see her except for Nox. Grandpa Winter was angry that he beat Nox half to death.

Fortunately, the doctors managed to save her life. Other than being disfigured and suffering from many wounds on her body, her limbs were intact. When she was in the hospital, Mrs. Winter cried so hard and asked her to leave Nox on her own accord. Otherwise, Grandpa Winter would definitely beat Nox to death.

Shelly knew from then on that Nox would always be the most important person in the Winters’ heart. Of course, she understood their perspective. After all, Nox was the biological son of Mr. and Mrs. Winter. As they said, blood was thicker than water, so it was only right for them to take care of Nox.

Therefore, she went with Mrs. Winter’s request and chose to leave Nox. She even took a sum of money from Nox and ended her relationship with Nox.

Before she left, Mrs. Winter actually came to look for her and said that even if she had nothing to do with Nox, she could still return to the Winters and they would treat her like a daughter. However, she knew it was because of Mrs. Winter’s guilt toward her.

After all, since she was young, they had taught her that she would marry Nox when she grew up and that she would be Nox’s wife. If they suddenly told her that she could not be Nox’s wife, they would feel guilty toward her.

However, at that time, she had lost all hope for Nox. She thought that since she had nothing to do with him, she should cut all ties with him. In the end, because of her pride, she rejected him and thought she could have a life of her own, not expecting that Bella would suddenly show up.

Bella’s condition made it impossible for her to raise her alone, so after much hesitation, she took the initiative to look for Mrs. Winter in hopes that Bella could live like a normal person. When Mrs. Winter found out that she had Bella, Mrs. Winter was very surprised, but she knew that Bella was not Nox’s daughter. After all, if it were Nox’s child, it would have been lost in a car accident. However, other than Mrs. Winter, no one in the Winters knew about the existence of the child, and Mrs. Winter even begged her not to tell anyone.

Once she told anyone about that, Grandpa Winter would make Nox marry her even if he had to beat Nox to death. As such, she did not tell anyone, not even Nox.

Mrs. Winter was also curious as to who the child belonged to when she first saw that Shelly had a daughter. Logically speaking, even if Shelly broke up with Nox and immediately got together with another man, the child would not be born so quickly. Therefore, she was certain that the child wasn’t Shelly’s.

Shelly also told Mrs. Winter honestly that Bella was her second sister’s child. It was the child of her biological second sister in her hometown.

It was when Shelly was preparing to start her third year of high school again that her second sister somehow found her and wanted her to treat Bella for her.

Her second sister said that she had no choice but to bring Bella to look for her. In their village, having a daughter was already looked down upon, but because Bella was also disabled, she was even more disliked. Her second sister was about to give Bella away but could not bear to do so. Hence, she secretly left the village with the child. She wanted to find Shelly to treat Bella for her, but she did not expect that Shelly had severed ties with the Winters and had nothing left in her name.

Indeed, most ot Shelly’s savings had been spent on plastic surgery. Atter all, she could not live with a ruined face. In this age where looks mattered, she Imew very well that to make her life better, she had to look more beautiful.

As she had no money to help her second sister treat Bella, her second sister left on her own the next day but left Bella behind.

At the same time, her second sister left a note that wrote: Shelly, I don’t want to make things difficult for you as I know that your life is hard, and I never thought I would ask you to help me, but Bella is my biological daughter. I carried her for nine months, and I can’t leave her on the streets. It’s fine if you think I’m cruel, but I’ll leave Bella to you. You can do whatever you want to her. I’m sorry, Shelly. I’m sorry, Bella.

Shelly looked at the note and saw Bella, who was sleeping soundly and looked innocent. In the end, her heart softened, and she kept Bella..
