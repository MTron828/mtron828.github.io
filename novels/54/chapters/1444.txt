Chapter 1445: George Was Moved

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn wiped George’s body again and changed him into another set of pajamas before leaving the room.

Meanwhile, George held tightly to Candice’s hand and refused to let go.

Candice had tried it to pry open George’s grip before, but whenever she moved a little, George would hold her even tighter. It was as if he was afraid that she would suddenly leave.

Seeing that, Candice stopped resisting. She just sat by the bed, with one hand in George’s hand and the other checking George’s body temperature.

Once she confirmed that his body temperature was not rising, she relaxed a little and leaned against George. By then, it was already past 5 a.m.

Having stayed up all night, she felt a little sleepy. Hence, she lay down beside George, closed her eyes, and fell asleep.

George woke up around 7 a.m. He was used to waking up at that time, and it had become his body’s biological clock. The moment he woke up, he felt that his entire body was weak and that he had no strength in his body.

He moved his eyes and suddenly saw Candice lying beside him. He looked at her exhausted face as she slept on the side of the bed.

He was shocked. He remembered that Teddy was with him when he went to sleep last night. How did it become that woman?

What he found even more unbelievable was that his hand was holding hers. On top of that, she was not the one who grabbed him; he was!

He quickly let go of his hand. His movements were a little too big, and it woke Candice up.

Candice blinked. She was a little groggy when she woke up, but in the next second, she suddenly thought of something. She quickly came to her senses and used her hand to touch George’s forehead, as if to make sure whether his fever was still there.

George could feel the warmth of Candice’s palm.

“I don’t have a fever anymore,” George told her.

It was because Candice had placed her hand on his forehead for too long and he was actually a little attached to her.

“That’s good.” Candice heaved a sigh of relief. Then, she looked at George. “Are you awake?”

“Yes.”

“Are you feeling unwell?”

“Are you hungry?”

“I’m not hungry.”

“I’ll get Teddy to make you some breakfast.”

George was speechless. ‘I said I’m not hungry!’

By then, Candice had left the room. After a while, she walked in with a bowl of yogurt with granola and fruits.

George struggled to sit up.

“Don’t move. I’ll help you,” Candice quickly said.

She put the yogurt bowl on the bed and bent over to help George.

“I can do it myself.” He refused her help.

Candice felt helpless, but all she could do was watch as George struggled to sit up.

Then, she deliberately sighed. “It suddenly seems to me that you’re quite cute when you have a fever.”

George leaned back against the headboard and stared at her.

“You would hold my hand and tell me not to leave. You would also tell me honestly when you were in pain.”

George’s face flushed red, but he tried to keep his composure. “I didn’t.”

“I was bored last night, so I recorded a video. Do you want to see how you were to me last night…” Candice pretended to show George her phone.

“I won’t look!” George refused, clearly agitated.

George was usually too reserved, and it was rare for him to be emotional.

Candice smiled. “I’m just lying to you, silly.” “You’re the silly one.” George was furious.

“But what I said just now was true.”

Candice picked up the bowl of yogurt, sat down, and fed George yogurt with some granola and fruits.

George was about to refuse when he suddenly saw the red teeth marks on Candice’s hand. Due to the broken skin, a scab had formed, and the bruises around it looked hideous.

Candice naturally noticed George’s gaze. She smiled. “Yes, it was your masterpiece last night.”

“I…” George was obviously embarrassed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“If you be a good boy and let me feed you this yogurt bowl, I won’t hold it against you.” Candice did not want to make George feel awkward, so she offered her terms calmly.

George did not answer, but it was obvious that he had acquiesced.

Candice smiled.

Actually, George was only ten years old. No matter how complicated a ten-year-old child’s thoughts were, how complicated could they be?

She scooped a spoonful of everything before putting it in George’s mouth.

In George’s memory, he had never been taken care of like that before He recalled that his mother would never treat him like that. Although she loved him very much, she always taught him to be independent.

It was not until his mother passed away that he realized why his mother wanted him to learn to be independent. It was because she knew she would leave his side early.

His eyes reddened, but he forced himself to control his emotions. Candice also saw George’s expression and naturally did not expose him. She just fed him the nutritious meal bite by bite, and George ate his food one bite at a time.

Soon, the yogurt bowl was empty. Candice asked, “Do you still want more food?”

“No.” George shook his head.

“In that case, do you want to get up and get some fresh air now? Or do you want to stay in bed and get more sleep?” “I want to see Uncle Finn.”

“Alright, I’ll go get him.” Candice nodded.

She left the room with the empty bowl.

Just as she was at the door, she heard a very soft voice behind her. It was so soft that it sounded like an illusion. “Thank you.”

Candice stopped in her tracks and smiled. Even though her eyes were a little red, she figured that George, that little wimp, was finally moved by her.

It was not in vain that she treated him so well..
