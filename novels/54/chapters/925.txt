926 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

“Why do you want to be a nurse?” Monica really could not understand Sarah. She was a well-bred young lady and had to serve others.

“For Finn, of course,” Sarah said happily.

Monica also reacted. F*ck. She had dug her own grave, touching her own sore spot.

Monica suddenly stopped talking.

On the contrary, Sarah was in high spirits. “Once I become a nurse, I can always be with Finn, no matter if I’m at or off work. How great would that be?”

Ha ha, Monica sneered. You will know how ‘amazing’ Finn really is once you live with him in the future! It could anger someone to death. She could not wait for the day Sarah received her ‘retribution’.

“Speaking of which, I haven’t sent a message to Finn today. I’m going to report to him about my recovery.” With that, she got off the table and ran off excitedly.

Monica just looked at Sarah’s figure. It was as if she was looking at her past self.

She was no longer interested in doing anything now. She got off the table slowly, and the servants came forward to clean up the table. Ruby was lying on the sofa watching TV.

Every time she cooked, she would not eat much herself, choosing to try her best to let Monica and Sarah eat. Monica always felt that her mother was trying deliberately to fatten them up so she could accentuate her slim figure. This old lady was too evil.

Monica sat down next to her mother, but before she could speak, her mother’s phone rang.

Ruby glanced at it and picked it up. “Hello?”

It was probably a stranger.

“Madam, something bad happened. The chairman had a heart attack and suddenly fainted.” An agitated voice came through from the other end.

Ruby’s expression changed and became a little dazed.

“What’s wrong?” Monica quickly asked, having noticed her mother’s strange behavior.

It was only then that Ruby seemed to have realized something and reacted. She said, “Your father had a heart attack and fainted…”

“What?!” Monica was shocked. She hurriedly said to her mother, “Hurry! Send him to the hospital!”

The other party was already saying, “We’ve already called the ambulance, and they’ll be here soon. Please come to the hospital as quickly as you can.”

There was no time to ask what had happened. Ruby quickly got up from the sofa and rushed to the hospital with Monica tagging along.

Just as they were leaving, Sarah came downstairs with her phone. When she saw their panicked looks, she quickly chased after them. “Auntie, what’s wrong?”

“Your uncle had a heart attack. Your cousin and I have to rush to the hospital right now. Take good care of yourself at home, okay?” Ruby anxiously instructed while waiting for the car.

“Uncle fainted…?” Sarah seemed to be in disbelief. She quickly said, “I want to go with you to see uncle.”

The car was already parked in front of them. To not waste any more time, she nodded in agreement.

Sarah, Ruby, and Monica got into the car. The atmosphere in the car was very tense. No one knew how serious Gary’s condition was. Ever since he had a heart bypass surgery, he never had a relapse. The consequences of one were unimaginable.

Monica suddenly thought of something and hurriedly picked up her phone to call Finn. Since he was her father’s attending doctor, she had to inform him as soon as possible. Monica called twice, but Finn did not pick up.

She gritted her teeth. “Sarah, give Finn a call. He might not pick mine up.” After all, they had no relationship anymore. Finn might automatically ignore her when he saw her phone number.

“Alright.” Sarah quickly agreed.

She gave Finn a call. The phone rang for a long time before Sarah said, “He didn’t pick up.”

Monica did know how she felt at that moment. Should she be glad that Finn had not deliberately ignored her call? Though, she hoped that was the case. That way, she could at least find him.

“Let me call the emergency number.” Monica hurriedly dialed. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The call went through quickly. “Hello, this is…”

“My Father had a relapse of his heart disease. We’ve informed your ambulance to send him to the hospital, but I can’t seem to contact his main doctor, Finn, right now. Please help us make arrangements. My father will arrive at the hospital in about fifteen minutes. Please be sure to inform him to rescue my father.”

“Alright. I’ll arrange it for you immediately,” the other party hurriedly said.

“Thank you,” she said and hung up the phone. Even after, she was still a little worried. Ruby and Sarah were also a little restless.

The ambulance was two minutes until arrival when the car finally arrived at the hospital, so the three of them waited at the door. However, Finn was not there. She could not help but call the hospital’s emergency number again.

“Dr. Jones’s operation is about to end. We’ve already informed his assistant, and he’ll come over as soon as it’s over. We’ve also arranged for other doctors from the cardiology department to perform any emergency response first. Please don’t worry.”

She was still not at ease, though.

Finally, the ambulance arrived, and Gary was carried out of the ambulance. Monica, as well as all the waiting doctors and nurses, hurried over. Gary’s face was green, and he looked very serious.

Ruby was so scared that tears came out of her eyes. “Dear, what’s wrong? Don’t scare me. Please don’t scare me…”

“Please calm down and step aside. We need to send him for emergency treatment immediately.” The medical staff quickly pushed Ruby away, who was in their way.

Monica went over and hugged Ruby. “Mom, dad’s going to be fine. Don’t cry. Let’s listen to the doctor.”

Ruby forced herself to calm down. The three followed the doctors and nurses and quickly rushed to the emergency room.

Not long after Gary was pushed in, another set of footsteps could be heard in the corridor. Everyone turned their heads. They hurried over when they saw it was Finn, who was still in a surgical gown.

Without thinking, Monica rushed over, grabbing Finn’s clothes, “My dad…”

Finn suddenly raised his hand and pushed Monica away, leaving Monica embarrassed for a second. She really had not meant to touch Finn just now.

She said, “Please save my father.”

Finn only walked directly into the operating room.
