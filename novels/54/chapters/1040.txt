1041 Pushed To The Limit

“That’s true. Alright, I’ll report this to the higher-ups.” The hospital director nodded. “Thanks for your reminder.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“As I should.”

Finn did not say anything more and left the director’s office.

In fact, Harken was now putting a lot of emphasis on developing its medical care because their level of medical care had always been ordinary in the world. That was why the country placed a lot of importance on that. At this critical juncture, they probably would not dare to joke around with their own reputation and would most likely fulfill Monica’s wish.

He just did not expect Monica to be so smart.

Moreover, during the negotiation just now, she did not give the other party the feeling that she would compromise.

That Monica…

He returned to his office.

As soon as he entered, he saw Monica sitting at his desk waiting for him. Hence, he sat in his office chair and faced Monica.

Monica went straight to the point. “Cardellini Enterprise is facing a crisis now. All the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals are rejecting our drugs. If this continues, Cardellini Enterprise will face bankruptcy.

“Yeah,” Finn responded.

“This is the only bargaining chip I can use to negotiate with the hospital,” Monica said to Finn.

She did not say it with much emotion either. She was just stating a fact.

“Don’t worry. This is between you and the hospital. I won’t interfere.”

“Thank you.” Monica thanked him.

As long as he did not interfere, it was enough.

If the matter really blew up, it would probably have a huge impact on Finn’s reputation. After all, Finn was in charge of the surgery, so he could not escape responsibility.

What Monica wanted to do now might cause harm to Finn. If he could stay out of it, Monica would believe that she had done her best.

She would never think of asking him to help her.

She stood up and said, “I won’t hold you up any longer, Dr. Jones.”

‘Dr. Jones.’

She no longer called him by his name, and that was Monica’s current attitude toward Finn.

She had chosen to keep her distance.

With that, Monica left and walked to her father’s intensive care unit. Through the glass, she saw her father in there, motionless.

At that moment, Steve was also there.

When she went to look for Finn just now, Monica did not want Steve to go with her, so Steve came here alone.

He looked at Monica and asked, “Did the doctor say whether he would wake up?”

“The doctor said it depends on whether there’s a miracle.” Monica was very calm.

Steve did not know what to say to comfort her.

Monica said, “Let’s go after you’re done.”

“Aren’t you going to visit your mother in the ward?” Steve asked.

“No need.”

Her mother also needed to accept reality. Just like Monica, Ruby would have no choice but to accept it.

When Monica brought Steve back to Cardellini Enterprise, she asked about the resignations.

The number of resignations did not increase much. After all, it was not easy to find a job, and everyone was still waiting and watching how the situation would turn out.

As for those in the research and development team who resigned, they had already paid the penalty fees. Monica was just waiting for the money to be transferred to the company’s account.

She sat in her office and continued to plan for the next pharmaceutical company that she had to negotiate with.

The phone suddenly rang.

Monica took a look, and her expression changed.

No matter how much she tried to disguise her emotions, she still could not hide his anger with Michael.

Nevertheless, she endured it and answered the call.

“Monica, you’ve become much smarter now.” Michael’s voice was cold and sarcastic.

“Isn’t it all thanks to you?”

“But you still can’t beat me!” Michael was certain.

Monica gripped her phone tightly.

“You think you’ve succeeded just because you slept with Harry Chance and forced him to buy your drugs?” Michael sneered contemptuously.

It was as if everything Monica did was worthless to him.

“If I’m not a threat to you, why would you call me?” Monica asked.

The person on the other end seemed to be stunned for a second. Then, he laughed evilly. “I called you because how could you give your body to so many people when I haven’t even touched your body yet?! Monica, you’re really a whore now!”

“That’s right. I can sleep with all the men but not you. Are you angry about it?”

“Do you think I’d still want your dirty body? I’m afraid I’ll get sick!” Michael’s vicious words severely injured Monica.

Monica never used to understand how a polite man like Michael could have such a disgusting mother like Reese!

Now, she understood. With a mother like Reese, her son would naturally turn out to be the same.

However, some people were good at disguising themselves.

She asked, “In that case, why did you call me? Just to mock me?”

“I’m telling you, don’t waste your time. All you’re doing now is just asking for trouble! Aren’t you selling your drugs to Harry Chance? And it’s effective for six months! In that case, I’ll get Harry Chance to pay you in the last month! By then, Cardellini Enterprise would have already closed down for a few months, and what use would the money be? Monica, you’re still too inexperienced to fight with me!”

Monica’s hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

“Also, didn’t you go to the hospital today and threaten to expose the hospital’s medical malpractice? Yes, Harken can’t lose its international medical ranking now. You really have gotten smarter! However, if you dare to do that, I’ll definitely start with Finn!” Michael enunciated every word, his voice cold.

“What did you just say?” Monica’s voice was also extremely cold.

“I said, if you dare to make a big deal out of this matter, I’ll let Finn bear all the consequences. I’ll put all the blame for this accident on Finn and accuse him of not handling the situation well and making the decision on his own. When the attending doctor fainted, he replaced the attending doctor and performed a heart transplant on your father, which led to your father’s coma!”

“If Finn wasn’t doing the surgery, my father would’ve died on the operating table!” Monica shouted at Michael.

“Everyone knows that, but so what? Did Finn ask the patient’s family for permission to perform the surgery? The hospital could even deny that he had the hospital’s permission. Once it’s confirmed that Finn performed the surgery without permission, it won’t be difficult to send him to prison for a few years!”

“Michael, you’re really despicable!” Monica gritted her teeth.

“Otherwise, how could I have tricked you into going bankrupt!”

Monica really wanted to kill Michael!

Even if they had to die together, she would do it!
