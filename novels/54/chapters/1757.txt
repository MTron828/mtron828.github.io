Chapter 1758: A Celebration Party For Finn and Monica’s Babies Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

If they went on for as long as they liked, she would die out of frustration.

“No need.” Finn said bluntly, “Although the babies should have breastmilk for as long as possible, it doesn’t mean it has to be breast milk. Although breast milk is nutritional, the overall nutrition of milk powder is higher. As the babies grow up, they will need to absorb more nutrients. The formula milk powder has all the nutrients, so they can have milk powder later.”

“When will later be?” Monica asked.

Finn said, “About a year.”

As expected, she should cry.

Finn caressed Monica’s head and said, “Good luck.”

‘Good luck my *ss!’

For the babies to be breastfed, she had yet to start losing weight. Occasionally, she would do some yoga at home, and her stomach had shrunk a lot. However, she still looked fat. She was round and chubby, and she despised how she looked.

“Be good, and don’t think about it. Today is the celebration party for the babies. I’ll change you into your clothes and bring the babies out to entertain the guests. Now that all the guests have arrived, we, as the hosts, shouldn’t keep to ourselves,” Finn reminded.

Upon hearing that, Monica did not want to go out even more. The thought of so many people seeing her chubby appearance made her break down.

“I think you look pretty good,” Finn said bluntly, as if he could read Monica’s thoughts.

In fact, it was not difficult to guess Monica’s thoughts because everything was written on her face.

“I don’t believe you.”

“It’s true, and it’s more comfortable for me to hug you when you’re chubbier.” Finn said, “It feels like I’m hugging cotton candy.” “Finn!” Monica said angrily.

Just how fat was she to be as soft as cotton candy?

“I mean, it will melt with a lick,” Finn whispered.

As someone who cared about her looks a lot, Monica’s entire face turned red. Since when did Finn, that b*stard, become so flirty?

Naturally, they had sex after Monica gave birth. That night, Monica was actually against it. For one, she thought that she was too fat and that Finn would dislike her; secondly, Finn had never managed to pleasure her, so she did not want to do it before her body was perfect.

However, she could not stop Finn in the end, and Finn’s performance that night was beyond her imagination. She had secretly saved a lot of videos for Finn to learn from, but she did not expect Finn to surprise her with such a drastic change!

Finn was actually very nervous throughout the entire process because he was afraid that Monica would despise him again. After Monica ridiculed him for his poor technique, he felt disgusted by it, even though he never revealed how he truly felt.

Therefore, after that, he would look for some tutorials from time to time. Most of them were sent to him by Nox, who was the best in that aspect. Nox even boasted that he could not compare to him and Edward in other aspects, but in bed, the two of them were not as experienced as him.

Although Nox was smug, Finn had indeed learned a lot with Nox’s help. It was only when he started learning that he realized how perfunctory he had been in bed- He only cared about his own feelings and did not think about whether Monica would feel uncomfortable.

He thought that as long as he was comfortable, Monica would be comfortable. After all, their feelings were mutual. Fortunately, he heard Monica’s complaints about him. Otherwise, he had no idea how long he would remain ignorant.

“Be good. I’ll help you change into your clothes.” Finn’s voice sounded a little hoarse.

He felt that if he continued thinking about it, he would be able to hold back his desires anymore.

Although Monica did not want to get changed, she acquiesced, and Finn helped Monica change into her clothes. It was a loose dress that Monica took a long time to choose, but she still hated it. It was not the clothes she hated but her figure.

“Finn, what are you looking at?” Monica suddenly complained when she saw that Finn’s expression had changed.

Finn looked away. Although they had slept together after the babies were born, Monica would often fall asleep after breastfeeding the babies because taking care of the babies was a tiring job. Since Finn did not want Monica to tire herself out, he would endure it most of the time.

Now that he was looking at Monica’s body, he started to get restless again. He really could not resist Monica’s fair and curvy body.

“Finn, where are your hands at?” Monica complained again.

Finn was constantly getting denounced by Monica. However, Monica was not being unreasonable. It was really him who was getting restless from suppressing his desires.

Naturally, everyone outside heard the voices of the two people behind the curtain, which was not soundproof. Gary was so embarrassed by the young couple that he left the lounge. In any case, it was also time for him to greet the guests, but he refused to leave at first because he could not bear to leave his two grandchildren.

Just as Gary left the lounge, Finn, who had helped Monica into her clothes, walked out. The moment he walked out, he saw many people in the room. Only then did Monica and Finn realize they were not at home but in the lounge of the hotel’s banquet hall.

At the thought that everyone heard the intimate conversation between them just now, both their faces turned red with embarrassment. Finn was such a cautious person, but in front of Monica, he was utterly defeated..
