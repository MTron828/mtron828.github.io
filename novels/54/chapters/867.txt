868 Step by Step, the Proposal

Monica gritted her teeth. Michael had finally stopped hiding in front of her.

This vicious man!

“Here are the questions and the answers you have to say. Take note of them.”

Monica took it. How ironic.

The car fell into dead silence, until…

“We’re here.” Michael reminded her.

Monica took a deep breath and put down the manuscript as the car drove straight to the press conference.

Michael parked the car, opened the door, and got out. Then, like a gentleman, he walked over to Monica, opened the door, and helped her get out of the car.

To outsiders, Michael was a gentleman with outstanding talent and ability. He was probably the pillar of Harken. What a great existence.

Monica held Michael’s arm and walked toward the press conference.

All the media outlets in South Hampton City were waiting for them in the hall. It was a bit noisy at first, but once Monica and Michael appeared, it immediately quiet down. The entire venue was instantly filled with voices from every direction, and the camera flashes were non-stop.

Before Michael and Monica sat down, he bowed slightly to the media to express his gratitude. Then, he pulled out a chair for Monica to take a seat and sat beside her after.

The series of opening actions once again received a wave of positive comments from the public.

Facing the microphone in front of him, Michael had not prepared any speech, but his attitude was sincere. “I’m very grateful to all reporters and friends for attending my press conference despite your busy schedules. I’d also like to express my guilt for occupying public resources for my personal affairs. However, to clarify the damage to my fiancée’s reputation, I had no choice but to use this method. I hope you can understand.”

His voice fell, and the crowd burst into a round of applause. It was an affirmation of Michael.

Michael expressed his gratitude once more and said, “During this time, my fiancée and I have been questioned and slandered by all parties, which has seriously affected my personal life and communication with my fiancée, as well as my current job. Now, I will clear my fiancée’s name in front of all the media. Those indecent photos on the internet have nothing to do with my fiancée. They are malicious rumors intended to attract people’s attention. The woman in the photo was called Reina Wilde. She once played the role of Oliva Scott in the television drama “The Workplace”. These photos are private photos of her and her boyfriend, and they deliberately circulated them to create clout. I never expected that it would be stolen by unscrupulous internet merchants who photoshopped my fiancée’s profile picture into them, causing the public to misunderstand my fiancée.

“I declare my fiancée innocent. She has never had any improper relationship with another man except me. Even if she chose to marry for personal reasons, she has always kept her innocence for me! Please don’t believe those fake photos on the internet anymore. They have caused great harm to my fiancée! Thank you, everyone.”

When Michael finished speaking, he stood up again and bowed deeply to the media at the scene. He always showed his humility and courtesy, which made people admire him.

There was another round of applause. It was an obvious show of support and affirmation for Michael.

Michael really was powerful. Even Monica was almost affected by his righteous words just now.

Michael was clearly eager to “protect” his wife. Once the news came out, many people would envy her for having such a “good man”!

Monica maintained her smile without saying anything. She would cooperate with Michael’s acting.

Once Michael sat back down, reporters began to ask questions.

“Mr. Ross, will you pursue this matter of slandering your fiancée?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The law will pursue this to the end.” Michael enunciated each word.

“About the explosive dance that was previously spread by your fiancée, was that real or…?”

“My fiancée likes to dance. In fact, I accompanied her to the nightclub that day, and the person she was dancing with was also a dancer. The entire dance was just a performance, but it was not on the stage everyone had agreed on. It would have caused a misunderstanding if it were at some other place. Of course, because of her dance, so many things happened after that. My fiancée will not appear on such an occasion again to avoid trouble.” Michael said bluntly.

Monica chuckled but did not say a word. Michael had even told her to quit the nightclubs in public. He was well prepared.

“Miss Cardellini,” a reporter suddenly called out to her. “What do you have to say about your incident and the slander?”
