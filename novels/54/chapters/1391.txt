1392 Birthday Surprise VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She also realized that when Jeanne was pregnant with Paige, Jeanne could not even leave the house. After all, Jeanne was already ‘dead’ to the public.

Suddenly, Candice felt a sudden pain in her heart. It was as if she had experienced it before and she empathized with Jeanne.

She clutched her chest as an indescribable feeling overwhelmed her. Was it because of jealousy? Was she jealous that Edward had only ever loved Jeanne?

There was no such thing as an affair when Jeanne was the only woman he loved. If Jeanne had not died, she would probably never be in Edward’s life.

“Madam.” Teddy looked at Candice and said awkwardly, “Can you don’t tell Fourth Master that I’ve told you so much? I’m afraid–”

“Alright,” Candice agreed immediately.

Of course, she would not betray Teddy. Since Edward did not mention that Paige was Jeanne’s daughter, she would pretend that she did not know. However, she still hoped that Edward would be honest with her about it one day

“What about George’s birthday?” Teddy asked.

“I’ll plan it, and you can help.”

“Alright.” Teddy quickly nodded.

Candice also decided to focus on George’s birthday preparations. As for Edward and Jeanne’s past… it was all in the past.

After breakfast, Candice continued to play with Paige for a while. When Paige’s tutor came to class, Candice took the initiative to send Edward a message, wanting to discuss George’s matter with him.

However, she was afraid of disturbing him at work, so she sent him a message to ask if he was busy.

After she sent that message, Edward called. “Did you miss me?”

Candice blushed.

Were there not a lot of people around him? What would the people around him think of him if he said that? What would they think of her?

She controlled her emotions. “I just heard from Teddy that George’s birthday is this Saturday.”

There seemed to be a pause for a few seconds, which meant that he must have forgotten.

At that moment, Candice was a little displeased because it was clear that Edward did not care about George.

“George won’t be celebrating his birthday at home,” Edward said bluntly.

The silence just now was not because he had forgotten, but because he was looking at the time to go to the training base. At that time of the year, George would go there alone.

In fact, ever since he took office, George’s training was not as harsh anymore.

For a politician, his physical condition was secondary, and it was fine as long as he was better than average. The most important thing was his ability to plan strategies. Therefore, most of the time was spent on nurturing his overall vision and how to manage a country well.

“So if he doesn’t want to live at home, you’re just going to allow him to do that?” Candice asked.

Edward pursed his lips. He was simply respecting George’s choice.

“George is only ten years old. What do you take him for?” Candice was a little angry.

Edward was speechless.

He believed that it was best for him to satisfy George’s needs as much as possible, even though George’s needs were very few.

“I’ve discussed it with Teddy. We’re going to plan a birthday surprise for George, so think of a way not to send George away.” Candice was not up for discussing that topic, and her tone was firm.

Edward did not reply for a long time.

“Can’t I?” Candice was a little nervous.

No matter how good her relationship with Edward was recently, he was the leader of the country. Was she pushing her luck?

Just as Candice was about to compromise, Edward suddenly said, “Alright.”

Candice was stunned.

“I’m not close enough to George, so I’ll leave everything to you in the future.” Edward sounded a little excited.

She realized that she did not understand Edward that well.

However, now that Edward had agreed, she was excited. She said, “I’ll invite Nox, Finn, and Monica to celebrate George’s birthday together. Is that okay?”

“Sure.” Edward agreed.

“Let’s not tell George yet. I want to give him a surprise.”

“Alright.” Edward nodded.

“In that case, it’s settled. I’ll plan it.”

“Thank you.”

Candice hung up the phone happily.

After hanging up the phone, she called Monica.

Monica was sitting in her office, and when she saw the incoming call, she was still a little surprised.

How long had it been since she last contacted Candice? Why was she suddenly looking for her?

She frowned and answered the call. “Candice?”

“Yes, it’s me, Monica.” The person on the other end sounded much friendlier than her.
