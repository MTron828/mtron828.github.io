Chapter 223: Slap Alexander Hard in the Face

In the Lawrences’ courtyard.

Jeanne held onto George’s hand as they walked into the hall together.

In the hall, it was obvious that Alexander and Jenifer were there as if they were waiting for her on purpose.

The moment Jeanne appeared, Alexander’s expression changed slightly, looking very complicated.

Jeanne was not in the mood to deal with his mixed feelings at this moment.

Not to mention Alexander, the impression everyone in Harken had of her was probably going to change drastically.

53 billion dollars.

To be honest, when she had so much money in her account, she was also surprised.

She knew that Kingsley was very rich, but she did not expect him to be outrageously rich.

Of course, at the end of the day, the money belonged to Kingsley.

It did not mean that the money was hers just because they were in her account.

Sooner or later, she would return them to him.

Besides, Jeanne was not poor. Kingsley was quite generous to her. After all these years of risking her life for him abroad, she had gained some wealth.

Jeanne looked at Alexander indifferently.

She did not take the initiative to speak.

There was no need for her to curry favor with the Lawrences.

In any case...

Their interests were paramount.

If Jeanne could not give them benefits, they would be incomparably cruel to her.

If she could give them benefits, she would not need to do anything and they would take the initiative to approach her.

She understood the Lawrences too well.

In the hall.

Alexander seemed to have waited for a long time for Jeanne to call him, but she did not. They were in a heated argument before the court. Now that Jeanne had returned in full triumph, he felt a little embarrassed. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, Jeanne would not give him any face.

His expression became a little ugly again.

‘Is she expecting me to apologize to her?!

‘Isn’t she just a little rich?!

‘She thinks too highly of herself!’

As Alexander thought to himself, the anger in his heart grew.

Jenifer was furious about the lawsuit. When she thought about how powerful Jeanne was at the moment, she was so jealous that she gnashed her teeth. What did Jeanne do all these years abroad to have such a vast fortune? Her fortune was even more than that of the Lawrence Enterprise. It gave off a feeling that they were not even qualified to compete with her.

Fortunately, Jasmine was now married to the Swans.

Although the Swans’ assets were all in Old Master Swan’s hands, the Swans’ money was still much more than Jeanne’s. If the assets were all handed over to Eden one day, Jeanne would not be considered much.

At this moment, Jenifer could only comfort herself like this.

She told herself that she still had the capital to compete with Jeanne and that Jeanne was nothing!

While Jenifer had those vicious thoughts, a gentle smile appeared on her face. She took the initiative to say, “Jeannie, you’re back? We’ve been waiting for you at home for a long time.”

Alexander glanced at Jenifer.

Jenifer knew how to read faces.

Every time Alexander could not get out of an awkward situation, she knew what to say and do.

“Is that so?” Jeanne mocked, “Didn’t you guys say that I’ve embarrassed you? I thought you wished I wouldn’t come back!”

Alexander’s expression was ugly.

Jenifer was also a little embarrassed by Jeanne’s straightforward rebuke. It took her quite a while to adjust her emotions before she spoke again, “Jeannie, look at you. Your dad blurted those words out of anger that day, yet you still took them to heart. Don’t you know why your dad was so angry? It was all because he wanted his children to prosper. Which parent wouldn’t wish for their children to be better? Once something bad happened, they would be angry. Now that your crime has been cleared and the truth has been revealed, all of us will definitely be happy.”

Jeanne sneered. “You sure know how to talk. We all know if that’s true. I’m a little sleepy, so I’ll go back to my room first.”

She had never thought of giving face to the Lawrences.

That was because...

It was unnecessary.

Jeanne held onto George’s hand and prepared to go upstairs.

“Jeanne, you’re really climbing all over me!” Alexander could not hold it in any longer and fiercely shouted at Jeanne.

In this family, no one else dared to speak to him like that apart from his dad!

Jeanne did not stop walking and replied indifferently, “If you say so.”

Alexander was furious at this moment.

Jeanne was so disrespectful... She really thought that she was something!

“Jeanne, stop right there!”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She lowered her head to look at George.

In the end, she did not stop.

“Jeanne!” Alexander called out to her fiercely from behind.
