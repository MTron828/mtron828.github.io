Chapter 79: Don’t Worry, I’ll Only Do Perverted Things to You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the Lawrence Enterprise, in the deputy director’s office.

Joshua looked at the documents released by the general affairs department and was so angry that his body was trembling.

He hurriedly called Eden. “Eden, I didn’t expect that Jeanne would think ahead of us!”

“What do you mean?” Eden frowned slightly.

Joshua said, “My father has taken over the position of marketing director. I was discussing with a senior to ask him to take the initiative to volunteer. I didn’t expect that the documents would be sent out so soon! Moreover, I didn’t think that she’d ask my father to take over the position. Based on my understanding of my father, he wouldn’t be so nosy! He must be doing this to help Jeanne...”

The more he spoke, the more agitated he became.

“Calm down.” Eden’s voice deepened.

Joshua endured it and said again, “What’s even more outrageous is that the project team members have been selected. I originally restrained all the marketing department’s supervisors so that Jeanne couldn’t rope in the supervisors and talents. I also made it so that she couldn’t find anyone to help her select the most suitable personnel. I didn’t expect that she’d directly skip the supervisors and select all the employees. The people on her list aren’t my people. There are even some people who are dissatisfied with me to begin with!”

Eden’s grip on his phone tightened.

Initially, he did not think much of Jeanne.

In his opinion, Jeanne was just relying on her good looks and using her body to achieve some goals. It was impossible for her to achieve anything in the business world. At this moment, if someone was helping Jeanne behind her back, then she would be really difficult to deal with!

“Eden, what should I do now?” Joshua seemed to be on the verge of breaking down. “I can’t even get into Jeanne’s project team now. If she gets the MUK cooperation rights, then she’ll be the marketing director. Her authority will be above mine, and she will continue to bully me!”

“What’s the rush?” Eden seemed to be much calmer. “This is just the beginning, and you already feel that you can’t win. What else can you do next? It’s better to give up now.”

“No, I won’t give up. I definitely won’t give up. Eden, help me!” Joshua placed all his hopes on Eden.

Eden was silent for a few seconds before he asked, “You don’t have a confidant in Jeanne’s project team, but can’t you bribe one now?”

Joshua was surprised again.

“What kind of determination does an employee have? If you give them more benefits, how difficult can it be to bribe one or two people?”

“It’s just that I’ve never done it before.” This was why Joshua did not think in this direction.

The employees of the company were all taking the initiative to fawn over him. He did not give those who did not fawn over him a good time.

“I’m teaching you now. Send me the information of all the employees. I’ll help you see how to bribe them.”

“Okay, I’ll send it to you right away,” Joshua said hurriedly.

“Don’t go and get their resumes in public. If Jeanne is smart enough, once you do that, she’ll think of what you’re going to do. Find someone you trust and bring out the information secretly. Don’t alert the enemy,” Eden warned.

“I know what to do.”

Eden gave some more instructions before the two of them hung up.

Joshua put down his phone and revealed a cold smile.

‘Jeanne wants to snatch the Lawrence Enterprise from me? Don’t even think about it!’

…

Jeanne was handling her own work.

Until the end of the day, she stretched and stood up from her seat.

Today, other than setting up her project team and arranging all the project work, the rest of the time was spent on thoroughly understanding the Lawrence Enterprise.

The more she understood, the more ironic it was.

Back then, her mother had worked so hard to build the empire for the Lawrences, but now, the Lawrences had squandered it. It was simply laughable.

She even suspected that her mother was blind back then.

Was she blind to have taken a liking to Alexander, an incompetent man who was still fooling around?! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne got up and walked out of the office.

Outside the door, her team members were still working overtime. They had no intention of leaving.

Of course, the tasks she had given them today were very heavy. If they did not work overtime, they would not be able to complete it.

She took a few glances, turned around, and left work first.

After all, her work had ended. There was no need to waste time here.

Moreover, her presence might give these people a greater sense of oppression. Perhaps because she did not leave, they did not dare to leave even if they finished.

Besides, it was her son’s first day of school today. She had to go back and accompany him to show some concern.

With this thought in mind, Jeanne drove back a little faster.

When she arrived at the Lawrence family’s house, it was 6:30 pm. Alexander and Joshua had also arrived home.

Joshua obviously looked at Jeanne in a bad mood.

Jeanne pretended not to see it and politely called Alexander before returning to her room to look for George.

Joshua looked at Jeanne and really wanted to strangle her to death.

‘What right does this woman have to be so arrogant in front of me?!

‘What right does she have?!’

…

Jeanne returned to her room, but George was not in the room.

She frowned slightly.

Logically speaking, elementary school would be over at 4:30 pm, so he should be back by 5:00 pm at the latest.

She hurriedly called George.

Fortunately, George had had his private phone since he was three years old. The main thing was that his IQ was high, so he had no trouble using a phone.

George picked up. “Mom.”

“Why aren’t you home?”

“He’s at my place.” At this moment, the one who spoke was... Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne frowned. “Fourth Master Swan.”

“It’s me.” The voice on the other end was low and deep, and it had an attractive tone.

“Don’t you feel that there’s something wrong with your behavior? Why did you bring my son to your place? Do you know that you’ve committed a kidnapping? I can sue you!” Jeanne could not hide her anger.

Not only did Edward not care about Jeanne’s anger, but he also chuckled instead.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

She felt that she did not need to give this man any more nonsense.

It was simply a waste of time.

She said, “I’ll come and pick up George right away.”

“Ms. Lawrence,” the person on the other end suddenly called out to her.

“What?!”

“Didn’t I tell you that I’ve taken a liking to your son?” Edward’s tone was still calm and unhurried.

Jeanne’s anger skyrocketed. She could not suppress her anger and shouted, “Are you a pervert?!”

“Don’t worry, I’ll only do perverted things to you.”

“...”

“I’ll send George back later. Ms. Lawrence, please don’t worry. I’ll take good care of him.” After saying that, Edward did not care about Jeanne’s emotions and hung up the phone.

‘Damn it!’

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she wanted to kill that guy and shoot him to death!
