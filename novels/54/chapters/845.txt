Chapter 846 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

Among the five young hunks who had been seduced, one of them got so crazy that he directly tore off his clothes, revealing his six-pack. He pressed tightly against Monica, causing wave after wave of climax at the scene as they continued to tease each other.

It jumped to the extreme so Monica left the dance floor, her entire body covered in sweat. It had been a long time since she had danced like this. If it wasn’t for the injury on her wrist, she could have pole danced. Instead, she returned to her seat, panting.

The journalist who was following her looked at her sexy figure. At this moment, because of her sweat, his heart seemed to itch unbearably at the sight of her.

“What are you looking at?!” Monica panted heavily.

The reporter quickly retracted his gaze and couldn’t help but say, “It’s hard for me to control myself when someone looks like this.”

Monica rolled her eyes. She was used to it. As long as she wanted to dance, all the men’s eyes would be on her.

Those fair-weathered friends of hers always said she should be the queen of nightclubs, no matter how rich she was.

Though, could she be considered a wealthy young lady? Even though her family was richer than the norm, her personality was completely different from that of a rich young lady.

She had never liked things that were bound by rules and regulations. She preferred pursuing this kind of free and exciting life where she could do whatever she wanted.

She drank a glass of wine and said, “Are you done filming?”

“I’m done taking the photos and videos.” The reporter took out his memory card and handed it to Monica. “Here you go.”

“Are you sure you don’t want to keep any?” Monica asked.

“I’m afraid Ms. Cardellini wants me dead. How dare I keep such a sexy and enchanting dance? Director Ross has already given us strict orders not to dare touch your news. We’ll still give you the original copy. Just don’t tell anyone I took the photos for you.” The reporter’s desire to live was quite strong.

Monica took the memory card and nodded lightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.” The reporter said.

“Okay.”

The reporter left. However, the moment he did, he couldn’t help but turn back. “Miss, did you want to go into the entertainment industry? ”

Monica raised her head and glanced at the reporter.

“With a figure and dancing skills like yours, no one could compete with you if you wanted to be in a girl group,” the reporter suggested seriously.

“Get lost.” Monica was impatient. She was not that bored.

The reporter smiled and agreed. With Monica’s family background, being a celebrity was just for fun. So he left.

It just so happened that Elsa had returned from her dance. As soon as she was back, she saw Monica getting up to leave.

“Hey. Leaving so soon?” Elsa was obviously not done. “How about two more rounds of dancing? F*ck. You don’t even know how much of a commotion you caused in there. I dare say that 80% of the men here want to take you away tonight, and the remaining 20% are gay.”

It was rare for Monica to talk nonsense with Elsa. “I’m living with my parents right now. If I get back too late, I’ll be beaten to death.”

“When did you become so obedient? You’re even living with your parents. What? Your parents can’t bear to part with you because you’re getting married soon or something?”

“Whatever. Go and play on your own. I’m leaving.”

“Really? Come on. One more dance?”

“Dance yourself.”

“I pulled so many handsome boys for you, and you’re just going to leave like that…? ” Elsa looked at her with puppy dog eyes.

Monica waved her hand. “Keep them for yourself and enjoy. ”

“F*ck. How can I even enjoy it now?”

Monica had already left. She didn’t know where her shirt was nor where she had thrown shoes since it was rare she found herself in the chaos of the dance floor. Fortunately, she still had a warm windbreaker on her. Otherwise, she would have frozen to death when she walked out.

She sat in the nightclub’s dedicated shuttle car and went back. She had never left so early before. Monica was indeed a little bored with nightclubs.

When she returned home, it was 11 p.m. Although it was still early in the night, this was the time most families slept.

She walked into the villa carefully, afraid of disturbing her parents’ rest. However, as soon as she entered the living room, she noticed a figure sat on the sofa, which almost made her jump up in fright.

“Dad,” she said. Monica was a little flustered and exasperated. It was scary, alright?

Gary watched as his daughter clutched tightly onto her clothes. Seeing as she didn’t even have shoes, he couldn’t help but ask, “Where did you go?”

“Uh…” She didn’t dare to say.

“It’s late. Aren’t you afraid that your mom and I would be worried?”
