942 Monica Stirring Up Trouble

By the way, is Kingsley’s birthday next Wednesday?” Jeanne suddenly changed the topic.

The corners of Lucy’s mouth curled up into a smile.

Jeanne could tell that Lucy had been waiting for that day.

“How old is he? 50 or 60?” Jeanne pondered seriously.

Lucy almost choked on the tea she was drinking.

“If Kingsley heard it, he’d probably be furious.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

In fact, Kingsley was not even 40 years old.

…

In South Hampton City, Monica had fallen asleep on the office table in Cardellini Pharmaceutical.

At that time, Steve was still analyzing the Sunny Pharmaceutical with her, but when he looked up, he saw Monica lying on the desk and then falling asleep.

Steve had been working overtime with Gary over the years and was used to working late at night.

He lowered his head to look at the time on his watch. It was already 2 a.m. in the morning, so it was no surprise that Monica was tired.

He got up and quietly went to the lounge behind the chairman’s office to get a blanket. Then, he gently draped it over Monica’s body.

Monica was in a deep sleep and did not wake up.

Steve did not want to disturb her sleep, so he stood up and left the office.

Suddenly, Monica jolted awake.

She looked around in a daze. After a while, she remembered that she was in her father’s office and was helping him with his work.

She was discussing work matters with Steve last night. How did she fall asleep?

After that, she turned to look at the time. It was 7 a.m. in the morning. What time did she fall asleep last night?

It was too embarrassing.

Monica stood up from her chair, stretched her back, and then went to her father’s private bathroom to wash up. Looking at her bare face, she decided to not care about it anymore.

She returned to her office and opened the door. There were basically no one in the office at the moment.

However, when she opened the door, she saw Steve walking out of the office next to her.

Steve naturally had his own office, which was right next to the chairmen’s office. Although his office was not as luxuriousness and magnificent as hers, his status in the Cardellini Enterprise was not low.

“Are you awake?” Steve was drinking his coffee and coming out for a walk as if he wanted to make himself more energized.

“Last night–”

“No, you worked hard last night, and your health is more important,” Steve consoled her.

“Does my dad do this all the time?”

“Not very often.” Steve said, “But when something happens, he forgets to eat and sleep. For example, when a new product is launched, the effect of the drug is not obvious, and so on, your father will become a workaholic when something comes up.”

“No wonder he’s so weak.”

“That is why you shouldn’t repeat his mistake,” Steve reminded.

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

At that moment, she understood why her father had to work so hard.

This was the only way to lead the company when there was no one to share his burden with. If she had joined the company earlier and helped her father do more things, this might not have happened.

She could not help but feel a little sad.

“Do you want some coffee? It’ll refresh you.”

“Okay, thank you.” Monica really needed a pick-me-up.

“You’re welcome.”

Steve then turned around and went to make a cup of black coffee for Monica.

When Monica returned to the office, she took a sip. It was so bitter that she almost vomited. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Steve looked at her. “Once you get used to it, you’ll find it delicious.”

What kind of people were the people in the workplace?

Monica forced herself to take a few sips before the two of them went back to work.

In the morning, the company’s public relations department came to report that the quality inspection department had attached great importance to Cardellini Enterprise’s medical malpractice and would carry out strict quality inspection work. They had also set up a special inspection team. Other than the members of the special team, no one was allowed to interfere in the matter. The members of the special team had already imposed a closed management system. Before the results were out, they were not allowed to contact any outsiders for fear of being bribed by people with ill intentions.

In other words, the progress of the Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine test report was in the hands of this special team, and no one else could interfere.

Many board members also reported the same news.

It meant that it was difficult to control the progress of the inspection and that they had to wait for the other party’s results.
