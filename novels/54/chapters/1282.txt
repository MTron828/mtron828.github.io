1283 Edward Attends a Charity Banquet

“It’s just a business meeting. How do you want me to answer you?” Edward’s deep voice was clearly very magnetic.

“F*ck,” Nox could help but curse.

He knew that he would not hear anything good from Edward.

Monica could not help but laugh.

Every time, Nox seemed to want something nice to come from Edward’s mouth. It was probably psychological comfort, but every time, he was ruthlessly given harsh treatment.

Monica thought that Edward and Nox should have a good relationship.

However, ever since Edward became the leader, the domains they were in charge of were different. They seemed to have gradually drifted apart.

Therefore, every time they met, Nox childishly wanted to prove his existence.

“Nox, don’t swear in front of the chief,” Zoe could not help but remind him.

“I’m used to it.” Edward did not mind. “By the way, have you seen George?”

“I saw him,” Monica replied.

“He’s here?”

“He got here early but he didn’t seem to like the surroundings much, so he went off somewhere.’

Edward nodded slightly.

“Chief.” Monica still respected Edward.

“Mm.” Edward treated Monica well.

“I know you’re very busy, but sometimes I still hope that you can spend some time with George. I always feel that George…” Monica pursed her lips. After all, she understood the principle that accompanying a king was like accompanying a tiger. “George is a little lonely.”

“Okay.” Edward agreed immediately.

His answer was so straightforward that even Monica was surprised.

“I have been too busy with work and neglected him. I’ll try my best to make up for it in the future,” Edward added.

He seemed to have sensed Monica’s disbelief.

“Mm.” Monica nodded.

There was also a hint of flattery.

Sometimes, she looked down on her own compliance, but in front of Edward, she could not help herself and naturally wanted to obey him.

Damn it. She was livid.

“Good evening, everyone!” The host’s voice suddenly resounded in the banquet hall.

Everyone could not help but walk toward the center.

Edward remained unmoved.

Nox and Monica did not dare to join in on the fun either.

He was also watching the center of the stage from afar.

The staff members were giving out charity bids one by one. It was obvious that the auction was about to begin.

“I’m very honored. The annual charity banquet of Harken has invited all the distinguished guests here today. I’m especially grateful to the Chief of Harken for coming in person.” The host was very respectful.

He even bowed deeply in Edward’s direction.

Edward remained calm.

He just accepted the compliments indifferently.

“Thank you again, Ms. Nicholson, the organizer of this charity banquet. Most of the items in this charity auction were donated by Ms. Nicholson for free. Thank you for your strong support for our charity. Thank you!” The host bowed deeply.

The crowd applauded continuously.

After the introduction, the host hit the gavel. “I announce that the charity auction has officially begun. First, let’s invite our staff to take out our first auction item. This auction item dates back to ancient times and comes from the genuine work of the famous poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Now, only the authentic work of Ralph Waldo Emerson is left on the market. It can be said to be priceless. This charity item is provided free of charge by Ms. Nicholson. The bid starts at two million dollars, with fifty thousand dollars with every increase. Begin!”

“Five million!” Someone suddenly raised the price.

Everyone who was about to bid paused.

Then, the young man said, “Since it’s Emerson’s only authentic work, it’s naturally worth this price.”

“5.2 million.” Someone finally started to raise the price.

“5.5 million…”

The charity auction was in full swing.

Monica was not interested in this item at all. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

In fact, she was actually not interested in these charity auctions. However, she would symbolically bid for one or two items every time to promote herself. It could be considered as supporting the charity.

She raised her hand. “Ten million!”

Everyone who was still competing fiercely immediately settled down.

Nox could help but mutter, “Aren’t you afraid that your family will go bankrupt because of you?”

“What’s there to be afraid of? If I go bankrupt and the chief sponsors me with another ten billion, I can be revived.”

“Tsk,” Nox said disdainfully.

Naturally, Monica won the first auction. There were many items that came after.

Nox also made a bid for one.
