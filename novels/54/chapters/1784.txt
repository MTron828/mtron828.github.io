Chapter 1785: A Forced Relationship Won’t Last

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Once he had cleaned up the kitchen, he went straight back to his room. When he came out of the shower, Shelly had also returned to the room after putting Bella to sleep. The two of them did not communicate much. Since Shelly would not take the initiative to talk to him, Nox gradually became less proactive.

After Shelly came out of the shower, her phone suddenly rang. She glanced at the caller ID and smiled brightly. It was a smile that she would show anybody but Nox.

He watched as Shelly took her phone and put on a bathrobe to go to the balcony outside the room to answer the call. With the floor-to-ceiling glass door closed, he could not hear what she was saying at all.

“Sarah, you’re finally awake, huh?” Shelly teased. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Sarah blushed and glanced at the man sleeping on his bed. She said, “You came to pass me a phone today.”

“I didn’t mean to bother you.”

“Shelly.”

Shelly teased, “Didn’t you say you didn’t like Brandon? And that you broke up with him? Don’t tell me you guys had a one-night stand last night?”

“Shelly, how could you mock me?”

“I’m not mocking you.” Shelly denied it. “Actually, you and Brandon are quite compatible. I can tell that he cares about you a lot.”

“I don’t know.” Sarah was a little confused. “I feel like he still likes my cousin.”

“Brandon doesn’t seem like that kind of person. If he liked your cousin, he wouldn’t be with you. After all, by dating you, he would have to see Monica and Dr. Jones together frequently, and why would he want to torture himself like that? The reason he could accept your cousin’s marriage so calmly and get together with you is simply because he has let go of Monica.” Shelly comforted Sarah.

Sarah felt better after hearing Shelly’s words. She was really afraid that Brandon would still have feelings for her cousin, and she had to admit that she was afraid because she liked him.

“I’m waiting for your wedding invitation,” Shelly joked.

‘Who said anything about getting married? I haven’t had enough fun yet! Give me at least three more years.”

“That might not be the case.” According to Shelly’s understanding of Sarah, once Sarah liked someone, she would want to marry him immediately.

“Shelly, why are you going against me today?” Sarah complained.

“Alright, I won’t say anymore.” Shelly was not a particularly gossipy person. “Anyway, just be with Brandon. It’s getting late now, so I’m hanging up.” “Wait a minute.” Sarah quickly stopped her. “What’s wrong?”

“About you and Benjamin,” Sarah said bluntly.

Shelly’s expression changed slightly, and she said, “There’s nothing between us. It’s over. Don’t worry about it.”

“I can see that Benjamin still likes you very much. Since you also have feelings for him, why don’t you give yourself a chance? Nox is really not worth your time.” Sarah was rarely so serious.

“I won’t be with Nox, and I won’t be with Benjamin. I don’t want to hurt him.”

“Hurt him?” Sarah raised her voice. “I’m afraid you’re wrong about yourself. Don’t you know that women like you are extinct? All men in the world would love to have a good wife and mother like you, but you’re afraid that you would hurt him? Shelly, be more confident in yourself!”

“This has nothing to do with my confidence.” Shelly said, “Benjamin’s parents will never allow me to be with him. And after breaking up with him that year, I have never thought of getting back together with him. I believe Benjamin thinks so too.”

“If I were you, I would choose to pursue happiness. You’ll be marrying Benjamin, not his parents. I don’t know why you’re so timid.”

Shelly did not explain further. After all, Sarah would never understand her perspective. As someone who was born with a silver spoon and pampered at home, Sarah did not know what reality was.

The way Sarah saw it, as long as she liked a man, she could have him. However, that was not the case for Shelly. From the moment she was born, she did not have many choices.

She said, “Let’s not talk about it anymore, Sarah. I know what you want to say to me, and I also know what life I want in the future. You should be with Brandon, and as for my matters, I know how to handle them..”
