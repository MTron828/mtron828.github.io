Chapter 466: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

“Take advantage of this child of yours and behave yourself in the Swans. Otherwise, if you’re useless, Eden will dump you sooner or later,” Jeanne advised kindly. “You better behave yourself.”

“Jeanne!” Jasmine suppressed her anger and called out to her.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“You really want to see me as a joke now, don’t you? You really look down on me now, huh?”

“Don’t you know how much you weigh?” Jeanne looked at Jasmine. “My advice to you is not to think too highly of yourself!”

After saying that, Jeanne turned around to leave without talking nonsense to Jasmine.

Just as she raised her feet, she suddenly heard a scream behind her.

Jeanne’s expression darkened as she turned her head, only to see Jasmine’s entire body suddenly fall backward to the ground.

Normal people would know that that kind of fall was dangerous. If not careful, one might really fall to his or her death.

However, Jasmine just fell straight to the ground with a loud bang and Jasmine’s scream.

It instantly attracted the attention of everyone who was still talking in the hall, and the first person to run over was Eden.

After that, everyone came over.

Jasmine was holding her stomach.

......

Her entire face looked as pale as paper. She pointed at Jeanne with her eyes red and looked like she was in pain. “Sister, why did you push me?”

‘Hah!’ Jeanne really wanted to laugh.

Jasmine was probably crazy because only a crazy person would use such a method to frame her.

“Jasmine! Jasmine, what happened to you? Are you okay?” Eden looked extremely worried. At that moment, he was supporting Jasmine and was frazzled.

“S-Sister, she pushed me. Ouch... It hurts.” Jasmine held her stomach in pain.

“What happened, Jasmine? What happened?” Belle’s frantic voice sounded beside Jasmine/

She quickly went over to look at Jasmine lying on the ground. Her entire face was pale with fear.

“Mom, I’m in so much pain. My stomach is in so much pain...” Jasmine’s eyes were filled with tears as she said to Belle in an extremely weak voice.

“How did you fall so suddenly? You’re pregnant. What happened? You knew that the bathroom would be slippery, but why didn’t you be careful?” Belle said with a reproachful tone. However, she then said, “Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!”

Jasmine seemed to be in so much pain that she could not speak.

She just lay in Eden’s arms, clutching Eden’s clothes tightly. “Eden, I’m so afraid. I’m afraid that something will happen to the baby...”

“Don’t be afraid. With me here, the baby will be fine. Trust me.” Eden’s expression was one of deep affection.

At the entrance of the washroom, a lot of people crowded over at once, squeezing Jeanne out of the crowd.

Edward held Jeanne in her arms. Seeing Jeanne’s grim expression, he did not say anything.

After a while, the ambulance stopped at the entrance of the Swans’ Universe Garden.

Eden quickly and anxiously carried Jasmine into the ambulance while Belle and Henry followed.

Due to the ambulance’s limited space, the others did not follow.

As they sent Jasmine away, Elaine looked in the direction the ambulance left in and said deliberately, “And said that they would give birth to a child? I’m afraid they would not even be able to save the fetus.”

She said that probably because Belle’s words just now had provoked her, and she sounded smug.

The others did not speak up for Belle.

Then, Elaine seemed to have thought of something and said to herself again, “Jasmine seemed to have said something just now. Did someone push her?”

All of a sudden, the finger was pointed at Jeanne, and everyone looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

It seemed impossible for her to defend herself.

Moreover, Jasmine, the person involved, was not around right now, so everything she said would just be an excuse.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

At that moment, Wade walked out from the main hall to the door, but Old Master Swan did not follow him out.

Wade said to everyone, “The Old Master said it’s getting late, so everyone can go back now.”

He did not express any opinions about the accident that happened today.

Elaine glanced at Jeanne and said in a strange tone, “Let’s see if they can save Jasmine’s child.”

It meant that now may not be the time to be calculative, but someone would always be calculative.

The others did not say much as they left in twos and threes.

Jeanne followed Edward back, with George by their side.

The three of them were very quiet along the way.

“Do you think I’d push Jasmine?” Jeanne suddenly said. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’m thinking about how to make Eden’s family behave themselves,” Edward said bluntly.
