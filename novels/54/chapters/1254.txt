1255 Standing Up For Shelly

It was so crazy that…

“Ah!” Shelly could not help but cry out.

Nox seemed to like biting her lips.

The last time he bit her, her lips were injured for a few days. It was also very embarrassing for her to go to school with such lips. Was Nox going to do that again?

Shelly was in so much pain that her tears flowed down her face.

That was when Nox let go of her and saw her crying under him.

Nox was really a little frustrated as he did not know why he suddenly lost control of himself. He just really wanted to do something, but he was unwilling to accept that Shelly seduced him.

Most importantly, he was the one who took the initiative. If Shelly had taken the initiative, he could have said that Shelly had forced him to do it. After all, he could not run away with his crippled legs.

However, at that moment, he was the one doing all of it, and she looked so pitiful. She even had the cheek to cry…

Shelly should be shedding tears of gratitude right now because according to his grandfather’s nature, he would immediately marry Shelly the moment he doted on her.

At the thought of marrying Shelly, Nox immediately sobered up. To think he was so close to ruining his life!

He suddenly pulled his hand out from Shelly’s clothes, as if he had touched something dirty, and his disgust was visible.

“Get lost!” Nox roared.

Shelly did not waste any time. She got up from under Nox and left with no reluctance at all.

She got up so fast that she made Nox a little unhappy.

“Shelly!” Nox suddenly stopped her.

Shelly pursed her lips.

She finally managed to hold back her tears, but she did not know what Nox was up to again.

It turned out that she did not want to have a relationship with Nox as she thought. Perhaps Nox was too rough, which made her feel afraid… Or perhaps, she really did not like Nox.

If she did not like him, she would naturally reject skin-to-skin contact with him. However, if Nox really wanted to do something with her, she would allow it.

After all, once Nox did it, she would be the young mistress of the Winters, and Grandpa Winters would definitely force Nox to marry her.

“Are you leaving just like that?” Nox asked.

She had just teased him to the point where his body was about to explode, and she was going to leave just like that?

Shelly took a deep breath and returned to Nox’s side.

“Give me your hand!” Nox ordered.

She really did not want to, but she still reached out her hand…

Shelly went to wash her hands, washing them over and over again many times.

Then, she looked at herself in the mirror, her face visibly pale. Suddenly, the words that the boy at her table said today appeared in her mind. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He said that she lived a cheap life!

“Shelly!” Outside the bathroom, Nox’s voice sounded again.

Shelly turned off the tap and went out.

After helping Nox, the first thing she did was clean him up, and only after she was done did she wash her hands. However, it was clear that Nox could not stay in bed any longer.

“Help me up!”

Sure enough, Shelly basically knew what Nox was thinking by now.

When she went over to help him, Nox said unhappily, “Did you fall into the toilet bowl? Why were you in there for so long?”

Shelly did not answer. She just reached out to help Nox up from the bed.

“Could it be that you were secretly reminiscing that moment?” Nox suddenly smiled sarcastically

For a second, Shelly did not understand what Nox meant, but when she did, she was a little speechless.

Reminiscing the moment?

Well, she did not puke out of disgust there and then because she had endured it. However, she would not say it out loud. If Nox knew that she despised him, he would probably beat her to death.

Seeing that Shelly remained silent, Nox thought it was a tacit agreement. Hence, he smiled casually and seemed to be in a good mood.

Shelly struggled to get Nox into the wheelchair.

Nox was a little heavy. On top of that, he was more independent now, so he was using his own strength most of the time. The more he did that, the more difficult it was for Shelly to support him. In the end, Nox almost fell to the ground, and Shelly hurriedly used her body to support Nox. Nox also grabbed Shelly’s shoulder in an attempt to stabilize himself the moment he was about to fall.

“Ow!” Shelly screamed.
