Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Teddy, long time no see.” On the contrary, Jeanne greeted him very calmly.

Teddy snapped back to his senses. He had not seen her for three days. Was it considered a long time?

At that moment, he quickly reacted.” Welcome back, Madam.” Jeanne smiled and nodded.

It gave Teddy a feeling that the madam who returned this time was a little different from before.

“Where’s Paige?” she asked casually.

“Fourth Master sent Paige away,” Teddy replied. Jeanne froze.

“He just sent her to Dr. Jones and asked him to take care of her for a few days.” Teddy quickly explained, “Fourth Master hasn’t been in a good frame of mind for the past two days, and he didn’t want Paige to see him like that.”

Jeanne pursed her lips and asked, “Is Edward home?”

“Yes, he hasn’t gone out for three days.”

Jeanne felt a sharp pain in her heart. No matter what, she still felt bad for the man.

She brought George upstairs and walked to the door of her and Edward’s room. After standing there for a long time, she mustered her courage and pushed the door open.

“Mom,” George called out to her.

‘Yes.” Jeanne placed her hand on the doorknob. If one took a closer look, one could see that it was trembling slightly.

“Actually, he hasn’t been doing so well the past few years,” George said bluntly.

Jeanne nodded, signaling that she knew.

“I’m not trying to persuade you to get back together with Dad. Mom, I’ll support you no matter what decision you make. I just…” As if he wanted to explain something, George said, “I don’t think it’s been easy for him.”

In fact, he wanted them to reconcile, even though he chose to side with her unconditionally.

With that, Jeanne pushed open the door and was welcomed by the smell of alcohol and smoke inside the room. A man was lying on the bed, looking at the ceiling and seemingly in a daze. Cigarette butts and empty wine bottles were everywhere.

“Teddy.” The man lying on the bed did not even blink.

When he heard the door open, he said, without even looking at who it was,

“Bring me a few bottles of wine.”

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly. She did not know that Edward had stayed at home for the three days she was gone.

When she told him not to come to her, his answer was so straightforward. It made her believe that he had made all the necessary preparations, and that was why he was so calm when she left. However, it turned out that he just did not want her to know.

“I’m fine. I just want to drink some wine,” Edward muttered.

“How much more do you want to drink? Jeanne asked him.

The sudden sound stunned Edward, and his body stiffened for a long time as if he was frozen.

Then, he suddenly chuckled, and his gaze did not shift as he said, “I’m hallucinating again.”

As he spoke, a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye.

She looked at his tears, and her eyes suddenly reddened.

She controlled her emotions and said, “Shouldn’t you turn your head around to see if it’s an illusion?

“I don’t want to look. I’m afraid I can’t accept it,” Edward said as if she was talking to herself. Her voice was muffled. “I still have to take care of Paige. Since Jeanne doesn’t want Paige, I have to take good care of her. I still have to be a good father…”

Therefore, if there was no Paige, would he continue to waste his life away like that?

‘Who told you I didn’t want Paige anymore?” Jeanne asked him.

Yes, she did leave Paige behind, but it was not because she did not want her. It was because she was telling him that she would come back after she had done what she had always wanted to do.

“That’s how Jeanne is. She will not take advantage of anyone…” Edward muttered.

Did he think that by her taking away George and leaving Paige behind, she was dividing the “assets” fairly?

“Edward, turn around,” Jeanne called out to him firmly.

However, Edward did not move.

Jeanne was so speechless that she walked over. As she walked over, the smell of alcohol on his body became stronger. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She said, “I’m back.”

Edward was still stunned by that sentence. He hope it was not a dream or his imagination. However, in those three days, he had been hallucinating that scene so many times that he was afraid that he would be disappointed again and again…

Edward’s eyes widened as he looked at a woman up close. He looked at her familiar face and felt the touch of her lips, which felt extremely real. He was petrified. He was afraid that if he moved, she would disappear..
