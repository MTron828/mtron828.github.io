Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly just stood outside the door to Nox’s room.

It seemed to her that marrying Nox would not be easy for he really, really hated her.

Then, she returned to her room and lay on her bed, a little absent-minded. She still felt sad about Nox’s attitude toward her.

Nox had never liked her since she was young.

She remembered Nox’s parents forced Nox to take her out to play with him once. Since she was eight years younger than Nox, he was already 18 years old at that time while she was only 10 years old. She did not know any of the things he liked to play with and was ridiculed by a group of his friends. After that, Nox seemed to hate her even more.

Whenever she got close to him, he would fly into a rage.

For a period of time, she actually avoided Nox.

However, the consequence of avoiding Nox was that she might never be able to marry him! It was only by marrying him that she could enjoy everything she had now.

Therefore, she could only choose to pander to him and curry favor with him.

Shelly thought about some things and quietly readjusted her mindset.

Anyway, she only wanted to marry Nox so that she could continue to stay in the family and live a wealthy life.

As long as she knew her purpose, she could endure it even if Nox treated her badly.

She turned around and took her phone, which was ringing.

After a glance at the incoming call, she picked it up. “Sarah.”

“What are you doing?”

“Lying in bed thinking about something.”

“Thinking about what?”

“Thinking about how I can marry Nox.”

“I was just thinking about how I can woo my Prince Charming.”

Shelly could not help but laugh.

She was pretty happy for Sarah that her Prince Charming was now single again.

Moreover, looking at the situation on the news, her Prince Charming should be done with his ex-wife. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Tell me, what should I do?” Sarah was feeling distressed.

“I don’t know.” Shelly really did not know.

If it were about academics, she would, but she had no experience in dating.

It could even be said that she was rather stupid in that aspect, or Nox would not hate her so much.

“To be honest, your matter is easy to resolve.” Sarah seemed to have sensed Shelly’s emotions. She said, “Nox’s family wants Nox to marry you, but Nox doesn’t want to marry you because he doesn’t like you, and it’s too difficult to make him like you. But if your goal is to marry Nox, regardless of whether he likes it or not, the most direct and effective way is to have his child. Once you’re pregnant with Nox’s child, no matter how much Nox resists, he will marry you. That way, isn’t the position of Young Mistress yours?”

“I would like to, but Nox won’t agree.”

“Force yourself on him.”

“I can’t, and I don’t want to scheme against him. I’m afraid Nox will strangle me to death,” Shelly said straightforwardly.

“I heard that Nox is quite hot-tempered.” Sarah nodded. “But Nox and my Prince Charming are great friends. If I manage to pursue my Prince Charming, he can persuade Nox, and maybe you and he will be together.”

“You must be dreaming. Although your Prince Charming is single again, I don’t think it’s easy for you to conquer him. It’s obvious that he doesn’t like you.”

“Can you not rain on my parade? I figured that since my cousin has hurt my Prince Charming so deeply, he needs someone to comfort him. If I take advantage of this moment, he might see my good side and fall in love with me,” Sarah thought.

“In that case, I wish you good luck.”

“I wish you good luck too.”

The two of them chatted for a while before they hung up.

Shelly stared at the ceiling above her head and took a deep breath.

Actually, all she wanted was the position of the Winter family’s Young Mistress.

She had lived a tough life before she was eight years old, and having tasted happiness, she could not bear to let it go!

..

One week later, in Lawrence Enterprise’s marketing director’s office, Jeanne received the information Nox gave her.

Her so-called one week was just a casual remark. She had never thought that Nox would really be able to settle it for her within a week.

It seemed like she really could not underestimate Nox or to be precise, the Swans’ capabilities.

She carefully sorted out the information before picking up the phone. “Amy, report to the general affairs department that I want to hold a senior management meeting.”

“Yes, Director Lawrence.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

A fight was about to start in Lawrence Enterprise.

Half an hour later, Jeanne sat in Lawrence Enterprise’s senior management meeting room.

A week ago, Jonathan had come to the company again and specially set up a special team for the employee transfer within Lawrence Enterprise with Jeanne as the team leader. She mainly handled the transfer arrangements while the position of authority to approve was still under the chairman.
