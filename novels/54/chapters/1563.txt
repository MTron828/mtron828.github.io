Chapter 1564: An Abnormally Drunk Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The reason why she did not call and went out directly was because she wanted to walk around. She had eaten a little too much that night and had to take a walk.

She kept telling herself that she had no feelings for Finn at all.

A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door. Monica knew it was Finn, but she did not open it. Then, the phone rang after a while, and she did not pick it up either.

Finn sounded a little agitated as he stood outside the door. “Monica, if you don’t open the door, I’ll kick it down.”

He was probably afraid that something had happened to her.

Monica believed Finn meant what he said, so after some thought, she opened the door for him. As soon as she opened the door, she saw the panic on Finn’s face.

When he saw Monica standing in front of him, he calmed down a little. “Were you taking a shower?”

Monica did not answer him.

“Your underwear was in my suitcase. I brought it over for you.” He waved the bag in his hand.

If she were not mistaken, it should be the shopping bag that Wendy gave Finn when she gave him the scarf.

“Give it to me.” Monica took the shopping bag from him and was about to close the door after.

“Monica.” Finn held the door open. “What’s wrong? Are you angry?’

“No, I just don’t want anyone to disturb my sleep tonight. I won’t be able to sleep well. ”

“What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

“I feel fine. I just can’t sleep with you beside me,” Monica said bluntly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn pursed his lips.

“Go back to your room. I want to take a shower and rest.”

“I can sleep on the sofa too,” Finn suggested.

“Finn, what is the relationship between us?” Monica was suddenly a little annoyed.

Finn was stunned. However, she was right. He was neither her boyfriend nor her husband yet.

“So, do you think it’s appropriate for you to sleep in my room?”

“I won’t do anything,” Finn said.

“What about the time when you secretly kissed me after I fell asleep?” Monica asked.

Finn was a little embarrassed, and his ears were red. He thought Monica did not know.

“I don’t want to fuss about it. Just don’t sleep in my room tonight.”

“Monica.” Finn was still holding the door open.

It made Monica even angrier.

“Remember to cover yourself with a blanket when you sleep. Also, turn on the heater. The temperature at night will drop to at least 5 or 6 degrees, which will be relatively cold. When you sleep, don’t turn off all the lights. Leave one light on so that it won’t be too dark and you won’t fall if you decide to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. You must remember to keep your hotel slippers on when you go to the bathroom. Although I’ve verified that the floor in the bathroom is not slippery, you might slip and fall, even if it’s not wet. Also, I just told the waiter to bring you some milk. You must drink a glass of milk before you go to bed. It will help you sleep better.”

Monica simply stared at Finn.

Finn continued, “If you’re afraid of sleeping alone, just give me a call. I won’t turn my phone off or put it on silent.”

Only after that did Finn let go of the door, and Monica slammed the door shut in the next second with a bang.

Finn stood at the door, still finding it hard to accept that Monica had rejected him. Nevertheless, he forced himself to relax. Just as he was about to leave, the door of the room next door opened. It was Brandon.

Brandon looked at Finn’s expression and then looked at Monica’s tightly shut door. He gloated, “Rejected?”

Finn made himself seem aloof. No matter what, he could not allow his love rival to see him as a joke.

“Do you want to get a drink together?” Brandon asked.

Finn looked at him.

“I slept all afternoon and can’t sleep now, so I thought I’d go out for a walk. I saw a bar in the hotel just now. Let’s go and hang out together.”

However, Finn was a little hesitant.

“Monica has shut the door on you. Do you still think she’ll open the door for you?” Brandon urged, ‘We’re both in the same boat. Let’s go and drown our sorrows in alcohol.”

In the end, Finn gave in.

The two of them sat down at the bar, which was relatively quiet. It was the kind of place where people went just for drinks. There were no DJs, no dancing, and no loud music. On the contrary, the lights were dim, and some nice songs were playing.

“I can’t hold my alcohol very well,” Finn said.

“I know.” Brandon poured him a glass of wine and said, “I won’t get you drunk.”

Finn did not refuse..
