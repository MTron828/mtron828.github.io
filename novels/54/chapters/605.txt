Chapter 606: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It doesn’t mean I don’t care how my grandfather died!” Jeanne shouted at Alexander in an imposing manner.

Alexander was stunned.

For a second, he was frightened by Jeanne’s determination. He even had an illusion that Jeanne knew something.

There was no way. How could Jeanne know?

When the incident happened, no one was present.

Furthermore, he had sent away many of the servants in the house, and the rest did not live in the main courtyard. They all stayed in another small courtyard, so when he made his move, he locked all their doors. There was no way the servants could have climbed over the wall and seen anything.

As for the personal servant by his father’s side, he had given him sleeping pills that night.

It was not until his father had died for more than an hour that the personal servant woke up to find that his father was not there. Then, he found his father dead downstairs.

At that thought, Alexander became more confident.

He felt that Jeanne was just bluffing.

Moreover, the current Jeanne was different from the past. She could be invisible and give people a sense of oppression, making people tremble involuntarily.

“Jeanne, that’s enough!” Alexander rushed at her. “If you cause a scene here, I’ll kick you out!”

Jeanne did not care about Alexander’s threats at all.

On the contrary, George, who had been standing obediently by Jeanne’s side, looked at Alexander’s appearance, and his little face darkened.

The same happened with Monica.

She wanted to go up and fight Alexander, but Michael kept stopping her, telling her not to act rashly. It made Monica furious.

Alexander was bullying Jeanne so badly in public. How could she not act rashly?

She may not know what was going on, but she refused to believe that Jeanne had anything to do with Jonathan’s death.

Since it had nothing to do with Jeanne, how could Alexander accuse Jeanne so matter-of-factly and in front of so many people?

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.

She twisted her body to try to get out of Michael’s grasp, but Michael tightened his grip on her.

Finn was standing not far from them, watching the subtle physical battle between Monica and Michael.

However, his attention was not on them either. He was looking at Jeanne, looking forward to what Jeanne would do.

“Cause a scene?” Jeanne sneered, “Yes, I’m here to cause a scene! I’m here to find the truth about my grandfather’s death!”

“The truth is that you made my father get up in the middle of the night last night, and then he fell from the second floor absent-mindedly!” Alexander continued to argue.

“Father, don’t you think it’s ridiculous for you to say something like that?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Alexander’s expression sank.

At that moment, Jenifer pretended to be a good person and said, “Jeannie, please don’t argue with your father anymore. Your grandfather just passed away, and your father is in a bad mood, so his words are a little harsh. He didn’t mean to blame you. He just feels bad and wants to vent for a moment. You should understand your father’s current mood and say less.”

Jeanne looked at Jenifer and said coldly, “You’d better not speak.”

Jenifer’s face turned red in embarrassment as if she had suffered a great injustice.

Her eyes turned red. “Jeannie, I know you’ve never acknowledged me as your mother. I also know that you’ve always looked down on me, but... But for so many years, everything I’ve done for our family is sincere. I really want to keep the family together...”

As she said that, tears started to overflow, and she looked pitiful.

Jasmine had learned from Jenifer since she was young, so Jenifer was more skilled. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jeanne had yet to speak, but there were people around who could not stand it anymore.

An older elder from a family stood out and said, “Jeanne, I’m not trying to teach you a lesson or anything. After all, you’re not my granddaughter, but I really can’t stand it anymore. Can you please let your grandfather rest in peace? As a junior, not only do you not respect your elders, but you even argue with your father and stepmother in public. Don’t you have any manners at all?”

“That’s right. I can’t stand it anymore either.” Another slightly older woman said, “If it were my granddaughter, I would beat her to death! Look at how haggard your stepmother looks because of the family, yet you’re still shouting at her. You have no manners at all!”

The words of a few respected elders seemed to increase Jeanne’s crime even more!
