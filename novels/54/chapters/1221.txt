1222 George Gets Angry

Even after a long time after Susan left, Edward did not turn around.

It was not because he was reluctant to leave, but because he probably did not know how to face the current situation; it was an irreversible situation. However, he went back in the end.

Step by step, he walked into the living room, where Jeanne was sitting on the sofa, waiting for him.

It was already past midnight, so he thought that Jeanne would have gone back to her room after witnessing what just happened.

Sometimes, he even wanted to deceive himself and pretended that Jeanne did not know anything. Then, he would continue to deceive herself and live with Jeanne… for the rest of his life.

However, he could no longer deceive himself. He could not pretend that he did not know that Alex had come to look for her and that she knew nothing.

Jeanne was waiting for him to make things clear.

Edward walked to Jeanne’s side, sat down, and asked, “Not asleep yet?”

“Are you planning to keep this a secret from me forever?” Jeanne asked him.

“That was the plan,” Edward answered honestly.

Jeanne smiled faintly, but it was hard to tell what she was feeling. Perhaps she was already prepared for it, so when it came down to it, she was calm.

She asked, “When did you start dating Susan?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“From the moment I decided to compromise.”

“That was the day Alex took you away,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward nodded.

“Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Jeanne asked him.

“Because I wanted to trick you into continuing to love me.” Edward’s lips curled into a smile. He was trying his best to make himself look less ugly. “I thought that once I told you everything, that I chose to sacrifice you for my so-called family, my so-called relatives, my so-called power and status, and those things that I couldn’t lose, you would hate me.”

“I won’t.” Jeanne was certain.

Edward looked up at her.

“From the moment I couldn’t leave Harken, from the moment you threatened Alex to bring me back to your side, I knew that you would compromise sooner or later. If you could break off your relationship with Alex for me, you could also choose to give up for many others. Edward, before I got to know you, I really thought that you were cold, strong, emotionless, and wouldn’t be soft-hearted easily. But after getting to know you better, I realize that you actually have a lot of feelings. You’re the typical man who is cold on the outside but warm on the inside. You can’t be insensitive to things,” Jeanne said in a deep and calm voice.

Today, she was a little emotional because of Alex’s arrival. However, after calming down, she realized that there was nothing to complain about.

As the saying went, with great power comes great responsibility.

Since Edward had already reached this point, and he could not leave, he had to endure many things!

She said, “The reason why Alex is stronger than you is that he can have no feelings for things, but you can’t. You can’t hurt me, you can’t hurt your family, and you can’t even hurt Alex. That’s why you’ll eventually compromise. Of course, I’m not blaming you, and I don’t think Alex is better than you. I don’t want you to become like Alex either. Even if you become like him, we won’t have any feelings for each other anymore.”

Edward listened quietly.

It seemed that for a long time, he had always chosen to be silent when dealing with people and things — silently accept and endure.

“Edward, I really don’t hate you,” Jeanne told him loud and clear.

She really did not hate him.

Just like what Alex had told her today, Edward had done his best for her. For her, he was willing to risk his life and become a tool for her. For her, he was willing to fall out with the person he could not afford to break ties with. For her, he went against his own conscience and lied to her. Even now, he still wanted to deceive himself and not admit that there was another woman in his life, a woman named Susan.

He had tried very hard, but he had no choice.

“I still have three months, right?” Jeanne suddenly asked him.

Edward’s eyes flickered, and he nodded.

He did not mention what he had done for the past three months.

She said, “Can you stop lying to me for the next three months?”

Edward pursed his lips.

“Don’t lie to me anymore. We might still have a future. You can still have other women besides me, but don’t lie to me again.” Jeanne said, “I’ve accepted my death and that you will have another woman. I don’t want you to be a widower and grow old alone.”
