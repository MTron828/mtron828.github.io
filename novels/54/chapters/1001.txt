1002 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

Therefore, once there was an emotional entanglement, they would do their best to repay it.

She returned to the small car.

All things considered, she had managed to let go of that one thing. At least, she could have a clear conscience now.

She drove to the hospital.

Tomorrow, her father would have a heart transplant surgery, and today, she had proven the innocence of Cardellini Pharmaceutical. It was the best gift she could give her father.

As for whether Michael would be brought to justice because of that incident, she did not have much hope. However, as Jeannie said, that would definitely be a fatal blow to Michael.

The thought of Michael exasperated in some corner made her very giddy.

She was driving a little faster because she wanted to go to the hospital as soon as possible to spend time with her father.

From today to tomorrow, she would definitely stay by his side and cheer him on.

As the traffic light in front turned red, Monica stepped on the brakes.

She frowned and stepped on it with a little more force. However, the car showed no signs of stopping.

At that moment, she started to become a little flustered and hurriedly stepped on the brakes. Even then, there was no reaction.

How could that be?

She was still driving a little too fast, and the intersection was right in front of her. If she sped over now, she could easily collide with the cars coming from other directions. However, she could not stop, and she immediately felt scared.

She was a little flustered as she tried to maneuver the steering wheel.

At that moment, her car was already out of control and had driven past the traffic light.

Suddenly, a loud horn sounded in his ears. A bus was driving over from her left, and they were about to collide.

Monica gritted her teeth and stepped on the accelerator. The brakes were no longer working, but the accelerator was still there.

She sped up and the bus brushed past her. She managed to escape, but before she could breathe a sigh of relief, a motorcycle sped over from the right.

Monica screamed in shock.

She gripped the steering wheel tightly and used all her strength to frantically avoid the motorcycle. However, the moment she avoided it, she slammed into the guardrail at the side.

Following a “bang”, all the airbags popped out.

Due to the impact of the collision, Monica fainted in the driver’s seat.

The moment she fainted, she kept telling herself, ‘I can’t die. I definitely can’t die.’

If she was dead, what about her parents?

She still had to accompany her father for the surgery, so nothing must happen to her

That sentence repeated itself in her mind, telling herself that she could not die!

…

It was a cool autumn day in South Hampton City.

Michael was still sitting in the coffee shop, and cigarette butts were scattered all over the ground.

His eyes flickered, and he glanced at the vibrating phone before picking it up. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Mr. Ross, Monica got into a car accident,” the other party reported.

“Is she dead?”

“She was sent to the hospital, but she didn’t look like she’d die.” The other party speculated, “Do you need me to do something about it?”

“That’s enough,” Michael said bluntly.

In the end, he still could not bear to see Monica die. Otherwise, he could have arranged for a car to kill her.

He just wanted to teach her a lesson.

Of course, if Monica would not learn her lesson, she would still die!

His expression changed, and he picked up his phone to call Brie. “Monica got into a car accident.”

“Is she dead?” Brie asked him coldly.

“I don’t know. She was sent to the hospital.”

“You’re still going soft on her.”

“I just don’t want to make a big deal out of this. If Monica is really dead, we will be suspected of murder, and the first suspect is me. After all, she pointed me out in front of everyone today, so I have a very strong motive for killing her. Even though they might not be able to convict me, I don’t want to get myself into unnecessary trouble. The Sanders have lost their patience with me. ”

“Whatever you say makes sense.”

“Teaching Monica a lesson is also giving you an explanation. I will fulfill my promise to you sooner or later.” Michael promised. “Not only will I kill Monica, but I will also make you my wife.”

“I hope so.” Brie did not say anything more and hung up the phone.

Michael did not say much either because it did not matter if Brie was willing or not.

As long as she agreed to help him, he would be able to send her on her way without anyone knowing.

It was tonight!

He stood up and left the cafe.

He needed to personally make arrangements to silence her.

…

Monica opened her eyes, and all she could see was a vast expanse of white.

Was she dead?

She was still alive!

Suddenly, her eyes focused because she saw Finn, who was wearing a white coat, appear in front of her.

“Are you awake?” He asked.

Monica cleared her throat. “I didn’t die.”

“You’re not dead, and your injuries aren’t serious.” Finn said bluntly, “In other words, you didn’t lose an arm or a leg from the car accident. The airbag helped a lot.”

It was good that she was alive.

Monica did not even have time to rejoice that her body organs and limbs were intact. All she knew in her head was that she was not dead.

She moved her body.

Finn pressed the button for the bed, and the bed raised her head so that she could sit up.

“May I know what time it is now?” Monica asked.

“8 p.m. in the evening,”

“I’ve slept for so long.” Monica could not believe it.

“Yes, the doctor said that you’re overworked and need to rest,” Finn replied.

Overworked? It seemed so.

For the press conference today, she had not slept at all last night. She had probably slept for one to two hours at most, and she was dreaming the entire time.

Moreover, it was not just because she did not sleep well last night.

Ever since her father had fallen ill, she had not had a good rest. However, the car accident made her sleep better.

She struggled for a moment and got off the bed.

Finn also looked at her coldly and watched as she finally got down from the bed.

Just as she was about to take two steps, her body went limp, as if she was about to fall.

Seeing that, Finn reached out to support her. However, the moment he held her, Monica pushed him away with great strength.

After pushing him away, she fell back onto the bed because she had used too much strength.

On top of that, her breathing was uneven.
