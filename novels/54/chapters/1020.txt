1021 Millie’s Tragic End

“Who?”

“Lucy. Lucy of the Hills.”

“3 million dollars.” The other party immediately quoted a price.

“Sure.” Millie agreed.

“According to the rules, the deposit will be half and the remaining half will be paid after the matter is completed.”

“Alright. Give me your account number.”

“It’s been sent. Please check that you’ve received it.”

With that, the call ended.

After listening to the recording, Millie looked visibly flustered, but she forced herself to calm down.

She said, “Are you accusing me just because of this recording? In that case, I can get someone to record a voice recording and say it’s someone else! Besides, this isn’t my voice. How can you be so sure that it’s me? I refuse to accept your accusation!”

“Whether this voice is yours…” Lucy’s eyes flickered as she asked Kingsley respectfully, “Can I borrow your computer?”

Kingsley did not look too happy, but he nodded in the end.

Lucy took out a USB drive and plugged it in.

In fact, Millie was already panicking. She no longer had the confidence and calmness from before.

After inserting the USB drive into the computer, Millie’s face appeared on the screen. It was a video of Millie taking the voice-changing test in the assassin training class.

Assassins had to go through many tests before they could leave the assassin base and become real assassins.

In the video, Millie’s voice was exactly the same as the one she had used on the call.

Millie quickly explained, “It’s not me. It’s really not me. This voice… I admit that this voice is similar to my voice change, but it’s not me. Yes, Lucy is slandering me. She deliberately got someone to record their voice that isn’t much different from mine to frame me. I would never do such a thing. Mr. Thorn, you have to believe me. I’m loyal to you and the Hills. How could I do such a thing? You have to believe me…”

Kingsley’s expression was cold as he looked at Millie.

He looked at Millie, who was so stressed out that she looked like she was about to burst soon.

He said, “A recording can’t prove anything.”

Millie was stunned.

Therefore, Kingsley believed her at that moment.

In an instant, she calmed herself down. She could not panic or allow Lucy to expose her.

Lucy looked at Kingsley calmly.

Kingsley said, “In the world of assassins, voices can be disguised as all kinds of sounds. Finding a voice like Millie’s to record is a piece of cake for you, Lucy.”

Millie quickly agreed, “Yes, Lucy has such a wide social network that she can easily find such a person! She’s trying to frame me because she’s jealous that I can be by your side, Mr. Thorn!”

Lucy watched Millie’s performance and then looked at Kingsley indifferently.

As for Kingsley’s protection of Millie… She began to wonder if Kingsley wanted her to expose Millie, or if he wanted her to know her place and not try to touch Millie.

She was silent for a long time.

That made Millie even smugger. At that moment, she was still acting all high and mighty. “Lucy, I’ve always admired you. You’ve been with Mr. Thorn for so many years that Mr. Thorn trusts you a lot, and so do the assassins of the Hills. I’ve always seen you as a role model. But now, you’ve done such a disgraceful thing for your own selfish desires. I’m sure Mr. Thorn must be very disappointed in you.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lucy felt that even if she offended Kingsley, she would admit it. However, Millie must die!

She said, “Millie, your bank account number is…”

Lucy immediately blurted out a series of numbers.

Millie looked at her.

“This is a transaction record from your bank account number.” Lucy took it out and said, “The day before the mission, you transferred 1.5 million dollars to the official account of S Underground Organization.”

Millie became nervous again.

How did Lucy get her record?

“You haven’t been in the Hills for long, so you might not know much about the internal affairs. All the assassins’ account numbers in the Hills were given by the Hills. In other words, all the information about the assassins’ accounts is in the hands of the internal affairs director, Cain. To put it bluntly, he could check the account number of any assassin he wanted to check, and he was the one who gave me this list. Of course, if you suspect that I’m faking it, I can get Cain to testify,” Lucy explained clearly.
