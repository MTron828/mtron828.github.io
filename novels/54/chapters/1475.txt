The person on the other end reported nervously, “Ms. Carter’s child is indeed not yours…”

At that moment, Nox felt as if his vision had gone dark. He was so angry that his eyes were red. He thought, ‘So that’s how shameless Shelly is, huh?’

Even though he kept telling himself that it was impossible for her child to have anything to do with him, when he knew the answer, it hit him really hard.

Back then, when Shelly said she liked him and that she would not marry anyone but him, she was lying, right?

His hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

“Ms. Carter’s child is-I‘

Nox hung up the phone abruptly.

Who Shelly’s child belonged to had nothing to do with him, and he did not have to be concerned as to what kind of filthy life she was living now.

Hence, he suddenly turned back into the hospital and pushed the door to the ward open.

In fact, Shelly did not expect Nox to turn back and with such a murderous look on his face at that.

How childish was the man to do irrational things?

However, Shelly ignored Nox. Instead, she got up from the bed and wanted to go to the bathroom because she had to pee.

Just as she was about to remove the drip and go to the toilet, Nox suddenly said, “2000 dollars!”

Shelly did not know what was Nox up to.

“I spent 2000 dollars on the hospital fees. Pay me back!” Nox said coldly.

He felt that it was not worth it to sDend a single cent on Shellv.

After sending Shelly to the hospital, he even took into account her financial situation and took the initiative to save 2000 dollars for her hospitalization fees. However, he wanted it all back now.

Shelly fell silent after hearing what Nox said. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

2000 dollars was too much for her. She had not even received the 50,000 dollars that Nox was supposed to give her, and she had to pay him back 2000 dollars? She would rather be dead!

“Didn’t you hear me?” Nox roared.

“Are you deliberately looking for trouble?” Shelly was relatively calm.

2000 dollars was nothing to Nox! Why did he come back to ask her for it?

“As a matter of fact, I think that spending a single cent on someone like you is a waste of my money.”

“I didn’t come to the hospital willingly, nor did I want to stay in such an expensive ward,” Shelly retorted. “You were the one who made all the decisions when I was unconscious, so it has nothing to do with me. Why should I pay?

“So you won’t agree to it, will you?” Nox gritted his teeth.

“No,” Shelly said confidently.

When it came to money, she would never compromise.

“Alright.” Nox nodded. “I’ll deduct it from your 50,000 dollars.” “No!” Shelly refused. ‘You can deduct 100 dollars at most.”

Nox sneered. He found Shelly ridiculous.

“I’ll only go to a cheap clinic when I’m sick. The expenses there are at most a few hundred dollars, and 100 dollars is the limit.”

It meant that she was at a disadvantage, even though he had brought her to such an expensive hospital and such a top-notch ward.

“You can deduct 100 dollars.” Shelly enunciated each word.

‘Why should I listen to you?” Nox sneered.

“In that case, why did you come back and ask me that?”

“I just wanted to inform you.”

“I’m leaving the hospital,” Shelly suddenly said.

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

“Can I leave?” Shelly asked Nox.

Although it was a question, she was already removing the IV drip from her hand. However, because the technique was incorrect, blood oozed out the moment she pulled it out.

Nox’s eyes widened.

After Shelly took it off, she pressed it down hard with her hand. At that moment, she was so angry that she did not feel any pain. She did not even feel like peeing anymore.

As Shelly walked out of the ward, Nox stopped her. “Shelly!”

However, Shelly ignored him.

Recently, Nox had felt powerless toward Shelly, who had been ignoring him as if she wanted to get rid of him.

The more he had that misconception, the more he wanted to target Shelly. Hence, he went forward and slammed the door of Shelly’s ward shut.

When Shelly realized she was locked in, she was so angry that she could not care less about anything and slapped Nox hard on the face.

Nox was stunned by Shelly’s slap. He could not believe that Shelly had slapped him on the face..
