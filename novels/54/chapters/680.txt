Chapter 681: What Right Do You Have to Say You Love Me?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Finn, I just want to say a few words to you. Give me a chance.”

Finn looked at her.

“This is the last time. I swear,” Monica promised. “After this, I will not pester you ever again.”

“What do you want to say?” Finn compromised probably because he did want her to pester him again.

Monica hurriedly said, “Come to my room.”

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

Seeing that he was unmoved, Monica mustered up her courage and tried to reach out to pull his hand.

However, Finn raised his arm.

Then, Monica watched as he turned around and walked directly to Monica’s room.

Monica took a deep breath and quickly chased after him.

She was not even using her crutches today because she did not want them to ruin her mood. Besides, it did not hurt to walk anymore.

When she closed the door, Finn’s expression changed, but he did not take the initiative to speak.

Monica, on the other hand, was extremely nervous. She did not expect that she would one day seduce Finn like that.

The room was a little too quiet, and Finn was getting impatient. “Aren’t you going to say it?”

“No.” Monica quickly shook her head. “I-I wanted to say that I love you!”

It was obvious that it took everything in her to say the words “I love you” out loud.

Finn was a little surprised as he did not expect that Monica would suddenly confess to him.

However, in the next second, he just looked at her coldly, and she could not see any emotions on his face.

Monica gritted her teeth and said, “There’s really nothing between Michael and me. I just want to help him. After three to five months, I’ll break up with him, and we’ll be together again. Do you trust me?”

Finn just kept looking at her coldly.

“Can you not be so cold to me? I’m really afraid of losing you. I’ve liked you since I was 19 years old, and that makes it six years since I’ve liked you. Although I was with Michael halfway through, I was with him because I wanted to forget about you… Anyway, I really like you, and I don’t want to end things with you just like that.” Monica said emotionally. Even her eyes were red with tears.

Thinking about how cruel Finn had been to her during this time, she could not fight back the urge to cry.

She said, “Finn, it was really difficult for us to be together. We used to have so many misunderstandings back then. If it weren’t for that incident, we might have continued to misunderstand each other, and we wouldn’t be together. Now that we’ve finally opened our hearts and let each other in on our feelings, I don’t want it to end like this. I’m really scared that you’ll leave me.”

Monica said, her eyes reddening as she kept trying to persuade Finn to stay.

Oh, how determined she was to leave Finn back then. Yet now, she was so humble in front of him.

Step by step, she approached Finn carefully because Finn had kept his distance from her after entering the room.

As such, she could only approach him slowly until she was a step away. Then, her footsteps stopped.

She reached out and pulled Finn’s hand.

The moment their fingers touched, Finn avoided her and said, “Are you done?”

His ice-cold tone was devoid of any warmth.

At that moment, her tears fell. Did that mean whatever she said was useless to Finn?

As expected, Finn was indifferent to her tears. He walked past her and said, “I’m done. Don’t come looking for me anymore.”

“Why do you have to treat me like this? Finn, why can’t you trust me just this once? Why can’t you wait for me? Is our relationship worthless to you? Is it undeserving for you to give in a little?”

“It’s not worth it.” Finn said, adding, “You’re not worth it.”

“Do you really love me?”

“I have.”

“No, you love yourself more! Once you think you’re hurt in this relationship, you’ll choose to let go immediately! Aren’t you willing to make a little sacrifice for this relationship? How can you be so selfish?”

“Because you’re not worth it,” Finn repeated every word.

“Am I that bad?” Monica asked self-deprecatingly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Was she so bad that Finn looked down on her?

However, Finn did not answer her question, or maybe he just did not give a damn about her.

She did not realize that was the extent of their relationship.
