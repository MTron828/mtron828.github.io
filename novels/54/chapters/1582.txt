Chapter 1583: The Conflict Between Shelly and the Winters

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox looked disgusted. “Who wants to treat her as a sister? I don’t want to see her at all.”

“Nox.” Mrs. Winter’s face darkened.

Nox was getting a little impatient. “Zoe is here. Can you not talk about Shelly?”

Mrs. Winter pursed her lips. After thinking about it, she realized that it was indeed inappropriate for her to talk about Shelly on such an occasion. Hence, she did not say anything else and changed the topic.

The dinner lasted for two hours. When the group walked out of the private room, they saw Shelly standing at the front desk. She seemed to be talking to the manager, and she looked anxious. However, the manager looked serious. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Suddenly, the manager shouted at Shelly, “You’re the busiest person ever, aren’t you? You’re either leaving early or late! And now, you’re saying that your daughter is sick at home. Since you’re so busy with your family, why are you still working? Go back and be a full-time wife!”

Shelly was a little upset from being scolded. She had just received a call from Sarah saying that Bella seemed to have a fever, and it made her want to go back.

However, as the customers she was serving had not left yet, she could only bite the bullet and request to leave earlier from the manager so that someone else could replace her, which resulted in her manager scolding her.

In fact, she understood that from a manager’s point of view, if her subordinates were always on leave, how could they do their work? If she kept agreeing, how could she manage her employees?

Despite that, she had no other choice. Once Bella fell sick, she would be the only one left to take care of Bella. For one, Sarah could not handle Bella, and secondly, Sarah had no obligation to help her take care of the child.

At that thought, she braced herself and said, “I’m sorry, manager, but I really have to go back. I’m a single mother, and my daughter needs me very much now.”

“If she really needs you, you shouldn’t be working! Let me tell you, Shelly, if you leave today, don’t ever think of coming back in the future!” The manager threatened, “You’ve only been working for a few days, and you’re always taking a leave of absence. I’ve had enough of you!”

While Shelly hesitated, she figured that once the doctors confirmed Bella’s surgery, she would not be able to make time to go to work anyway. As such, she did not have to worry about losing her job.

Just as she was about to speak, Mrs. Winter rushed up and scolded the manager, probably because she could not stand it anymore. “How inhumane are you?”

The manager was stunned. As Mrs. Winter was a guest in the VIP room, she did not dare to offend her.

At that moment, she immediately put on a smile on her face. In the service industry, they had to have no self-esteem sometimes.

Mrs. Winter said angrily, “Shelly told you that her daughter is sick, yet you still threatened her. Are you even human?”

“I’m sorry, Madam. I was too reactive and didn’t control my emotions just now. The main reason is that the restaurant is short of manpower. If she leaves so suddenly, it will be difficult to serve her. I’ll be more mindful next time,” the manager apologized.

Mrs. Winter still wanted to say something else, but Shelly quickly said, “It’s my fault. I did make things difficult for the manager. How about this? I’ll resign.”

She did not want to embarrass herself in front of the Winters and the Sullivans.

“Thank you for taking care of me during this period of time. I’ll come over tomorrow to handle the resignation procedures.”

The manager did not agree to Shelly’s request because she had offended a customer. Shelly, however, knew that the manager was put in a tough spot, so she turned to leave.

“Shelly.” Seeing Shelly leave, Mrs. Winter quickly chased after her.

Shelly did not want to stop. When she thought about how Bella was sic how she really did not want to get entangled with the Winters, she quil her pace.

“Shelly, wait… Ah!” Mrs. Winter lost her footing, rolled her ankle, and accidentally fell down.

The fall shocked everyone, but Nox was the first to rush up and help hi mother up.

Everyone asked with concern, “Are you alright? Did you fall? Where do hurt? Should we call an ambulance?”

Shelly stopped in her tracks and turned around, watching everyone’s c for Mrs. Winter from a distance. In fact, she also looked concerned as that a fall could lead to something more serious when one was older.

However, at that moment, she gritted her teeth and left. After all, she ( help much if she stayed here. With the Winters’ power, Mrs. Winter wo be in any danger.

Nox naturally saw Shelly leave, and he wondered when Shelly had becc cold-blooded! Did she not see that his mother had fallen?
