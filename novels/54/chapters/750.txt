Chapter 751: Monica and Michael’s Conflict

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Quinn Sanders was the very definition of an independent, new-age woman.

“By the way, why did you look for me?” Quinn Sanders asked.

She knew that Jeanne would not visit unless there was something.

“I heard that Joshua Lawrence often comes to harass you.” Jeanne didn’t beat around the bush.

“Not exactly harassment.” Quinn smiled.

When she smiled, she looked dignified. Quinn was used to putting on her professional smile.

She replied, “He just occasionally asks about my work.”

“He’s not a good man,” Jeanne said bluntly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Quinn looked at Jeanne.

“Of course, he’s not quite capable so he won’t be a threat to you. But he’s in cahoots with Eden Swan and that man is cunning and will do anything to achieve his goals. Be careful,” Jeanne reminded her.

Quinn’s eyes narrowed as she examined Jeanne.

Jeanne said no more.

She stood up. “I just don’t want anything to happen to you while he’s in Lawrence Enterprise, Director Sanders. I can’t bear the responsibility.”

With that, Jeanne turned to leave.

“Jeanne,” Quinn said, suddenly addressing her by her first name.

Jeanne paused slightly.

“You know who you are, right?” Quinn said.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“That means we’re similar in status. So why are you being so respectful to me?”

Jeanne smiled. “We’re quite different in status.”

“Like I said, I know your true identity, including the fact that you’re my father’s...”

“That’s not important,” Jeanne interrupted Quinn. “To me, the Sanders and I are from two different worlds.”

Quinn looked at Jeanne as if she was sizing her up.

Jeanne said, “I’ll get off work first. You should head home soon.”

Then she left.

Quinn watched Jeanne walk away.

This woman sure was unpredictable.

When her father asked her to come to work at Lawrence Enterprise, he told her of Jeanne’s true identity and her relationship to the Sanders. He asked Quinn to help her completely takeover control for Lawrence Enterprise. Quinn had thought that her father wanted to use the opportunity to bury the hatchet with Jeanne. After all, Jeanne had been abroad for so many years so he must have felt guilty and he wanted to make it up to her.

But Jeanne didn’t seem as easy to approach as they’d thought, nor was she one they could bribe.

Quinn put down her work, picked up the phone, and dialed a number.

“Dad,” Quinn said affectionately.

“Yeah.”

“Jeanne’s out of touch with our family.”

“I know,” Warren Sanders agreed.

“Lawrence Enterprise is basically in Jeanne’s hands now. Although the biggest shareholder is still Joshua Lawrence, it shouldn’t be long before Jeanne will take it all.”

“Quinn,” Warren called to her.

“Yes?” Quinn replied respectfully.

“I didn’t send you to Lawrence Enterprise just to help Jeanne. I did it so you could reap the benefits.” Warren enunciated each word clearly.

“Please enlighten me, dad.” Quinn didn’t understand and she didn’t want to speculate.

“You’re a smart woman. You know that much of Harken’s economy is now in the hands of the Swans, and that Sanders’ influence is almost gone. In the long run, if the Swans threaten us, we’ll have no choice but to submit to their influence. So now, we need to turn the economies we own into state-owned economies.”

“You mean...” Quinn sounded surprised.

“Jeanne’s with Edward Swan now, and I am not certain that I can control her completely. So once Jeanne poses a threat to us Sanders, you have to replace her. The reason why I let you enter the company when Lawrence Enterprise is basically in Jeanne’s hands is because I don’t want to waste too much of your time. Now, all you have to do is familiarize yourself with the company management. When the time is right, the company will be yours.”

“Alright, dad. I understand.”

“As someone of the Sanders family, we are destined to be different from ordinary people. You are my most trusted daughter. Don’t disappoint me.”

“Yes, dad.” Quinn replied respectfully.

After hanging up, Quinn sat on the sofa with a thoughtful look on her face.

So… Jeanne was merely a pawn of the Sanders.

At first, she thought that her father was sincere about Jeanne.

Now that she’s aware of the actual reason, she won’t need to be too polite with Jeanne.

...

Jeanne drove home at a steady speed. Many things weighed on her mind.
