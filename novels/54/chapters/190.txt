Chapter 191: Jeanne Mocks the Lawrences

“Whose fault is it?!” Kingsley’s expression darkened slightly.

“Who knew Melody likes Fourth Master Swan so crazily?” Jeanne was speechless, “I had always thought that it was just a political marriage. After all, Fourth Master Swan’s dislike for her is clear to see. As the third princess of Harken, for the sake of a man, she disregarded her identity and dignity. What can I do?”

“That’s enough. Now that things have developed to this point, I don’t want to pursue the reason behind it. Now, think about how to solve your problem.” Kingsley did not seem to want to think too much.

After all, there were many times he was helpless against her although he was very fierce toward her.

Jeanne did not say anything more. She changed the topic to the case itself. “It’s a fact that the dual contract exists, so there’s no way to investigate it from the perspective that it was fabricated. I can only prove that I didn’t do it and then catch the real culprit. Finn made two points clear to me. Firstly, look into the contractor and the chief engineer. There’s no need to doubt that those two people are in cahoots, so let me understand why they framed me. If it’s not due to personal grudges, then there must be someone behind it. Secondly, check the accounts again. Given that it’s done in such detail in such a short period, it might look perfect at first glance, but in fact, the more flawless they are, the more likely it is that there are impractical aspects. If the accounts are found to be fraudulent, it’ll be of great help to my case.”

“Where will you start from?”

“Hire a lawyer first,” Jeanne said.

“I’ll arrange it,” Kingsley agreed immediately.

“I’ll go to the Lawrence Enterprise tomorrow and see if there’s anything suspicious in the contract. Finn asked me to look into the contractor and the chief engineer. I think the chief engineer should be the most suspicious person, so I’ll go and see him in person.”

“Okay.”

“As for the accounts, I’ll get George to take over the internal network of the two brands and get a copy of the accounts of the two companies to see if there are any discrepancies between their accounts and mine.”

“Okay.” Kingsley nodded.

Jeanne said, “You should rest for a while. I’ll get Miles to send me back to the Lawrences’ manor.”

“Are you sure you want to go back now?” Kingsley asked.

“George is over there.” Jeanne was straightforward. “Besides, do you think that people like the Lawrences can really do anything to me?!”

“I’m really regretting letting you come back,” Kingsley enunciated each word.

“I would’ve come back sooner or later anyway. I’ll be leaving. I won’t disturb your rest,” Jeanne responded

As she said that, she called out to Miles and left with him.

Kingsley watched her leave.

He remembered the time when he found Jeanne abroad…

At that time, she was on the verge of death!

If he had been a minute later, she might have gone to reunite with her deceased mother.

Kingsley’s eyes moved slightly. He turned around and walked to the french window of the presidential suite, looking at the strange South Hampton City.

If it were not for Jeanne’s mother...

He would not have any feelings for this city!

…

Jeanne returned to the Lawrences’ manor.

Miles left.

Jeanne walked into the hall.

In the hall, Alexander and Jenifer were watching TV on the sofa.

Jasmine had also returned at this moment, obediently accompanying them on the sofa.

Joshua was not around. He was probably hiding in his room playing games.

Jeanne’s appearance instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

Alexander’s expression changed. “How dare you come back?!”

Jeanne sneered.

Alexander said angrily, “The Lawrences have been completely embarrassed by you! If you’re short of money, tell me! Why did you have to resort to dirty means to get money? Jeanne, I thought that your return this time would bring some difference to the Lawrences. In the end, it’s you’re lowlier than I thought!”

Jeanne did not want to argue with the Lawrences.

In reality, she was too clear about what kind of people the Lawrences were. She did not want to waste her time on them.

Nonetheless, at this moment, she had to admit that when she heard Alexander’s unpleasant words, her expression still turned a little ugly.

Jeanne said coldly, “Dad, I’m your daughter! Now that I’m in trouble, apart from looking down on me, what else did you do? Monica’s dad isn’t my biological father, but he’s helping me raise money now, trying to reduce my sentence. As for you, you act like this has nothing to do with you. Don’t you think that you’re not qualified to be a parent?!”

“Jeanne!” Alexander’s expression changed greatly when he heard Jeanne’s sarcastic words. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He slammed the coffee table, causing a loud sound to be heard.

Jenifer and Jasmine, who were at the side, were both shocked.

Even so, when they saw Alexander and Jeanne being so aggressive toward each other, they were secretly happy.

“What right do you have for me to help you? You’ve embarrassed my family to this extent. What right do you have for me to come and help you in the face of the law?!”

“Spare the rod,spoil the child,” Jeanne enunciated each word, “It can only mean that you don’t deserve to be a parent.”

“Jeanne!” Alexander was furious.

At this moment, Jasmine hurriedly went over and pulled Alexander. “Dad, don’t be angry, don’t be angry. She’s the one who made a mistake, so don’t put a toll on your body because of that.”

“Jeanne, if you were half as good as Jasmine, we wouldn’t have ended up in this state!”

“What’s so good about Jasmine?” Jeanne’s eyes turned cold.

“Everything!”

“Other than pleasing men, what else can she do for you?!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly, “Will she help you negotiate business in the business world? Will she let you hold your head up high in front of the board of directors? Will she bring the Lawrence Enterprise hundreds of millions of dollars of profits?!”

“You…!” Alexander was so annoyed by Jeanne that he could not say a single word.

Jeanne’s performance in the business world during this period was indeed astonishing.

Jasmine could not hold it in anymore after being ridiculed by Jeanne. “I admit that I can’t help Dad too much in the business world, but I can help the Lawrences from many other places. My marriage to the Swans is the greatest contribution to the Lawrences. The Swans’ assets are worth over a hundred billion dollars, and they’re the top of the twelve families in South Hampton City—”

“Jasmine, you’d better understand that you’re married to Eden, not the Swans! The Swans don’t belong to Eden!”

“Sooner or later, the Swans will belong to Eden. Eden is the eldest young master of the Swans. Who else can it belong to if not him in the future?!”

“Henry is still the eldest son of the Swan. Has he taken over the Swans?!”

“But Fourth Master Swan has no children!” Jasmine was furious.

“Ha!” Jeanne laughed sarcastically.

“What are you laughing at? Do you really think Fourth Master Swan has taken a liking to you?!”

Jeanne had a rare chance to argue with Jasmine. She said, “Jasmine, Fourth Master Swan is only four years older than Eden. So, are you hoping that Fourth Master Swan will pass his inheritance to Eden when he dies? At that time, Eden wouldn’t be able to move anymore even if he’s still alive!”

Jasmine was rendered speechless by Jeanne’s words. At that moment, she wished she could tear Jeanne’s mouth apart!

“Jasmine, since you think that your greatest ability is to please men, take good care of Eden.”

“What do you mean?!” Jasmine’s expression became even fiercer. “Jeanne, what do you mean?!”

“Why are you having such a big reaction? It seems that you already know a lot of things.”

“Jeanne, what are you talking about?!” Jasmine broke down.

“Back then, Eden was able to be seduced by you. Have you ever thought about whether he’d be seduced by other women…?”

“Jeanne, shut up!”

“I’m just reminding you.” Jeanne sneered and turned around to leave.

When she left, she said, “Oh right, I was bailed out by Fourth Master Swan.”
