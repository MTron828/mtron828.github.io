Finn did not reply, but she was used to his indifference toward her.

After taking that pill, they would no longer have anything to do with each other, and their ambiguous relationship would be dead.

She put down the phone and walked to the dining table, where Michael had already prepared the mac and cheese for her.

Monica ate slowly, bite by bite. It tasted neither good nor bad. She was probably she was so sad that she lost her sense of taste.

However, she still ate a lot because she did not want to let Michael down.

At least that man treated her sincerely.

“Is it good?” Michael asked expectantly.

Monica nodded.

“That’s good. I was really afraid that my culinary skills would disappoint you–”

“Michael,” Monica called out to him.

“Hm?” Michael’s face was full of smiles.

Monica said, “Stay away from me.”

The smile on Michael’s lips stiffened.

“It’s not fair to you.”

“Monica–”

“When I was still in love with Finn, I chose to be with you, and it was unfair to you. It was like this three years ago.” Monica said, “Actually, I’ve always liked Finn. I’m only with you because you’re too good, so good that I don’t know how to reject you.”

Michael pursed his lips tightly.

“I don’t want to hurt you anymore.”

“I don’t care,” Michael replied. “Even if you use me, it’s fine. I will never fall in love with other women in this world except for you.”

“In that case, I definitely can’t be with you.” Monica looked at Michael and said, “I’m not worthy of your feelings, and I don’t want to owe you anything. I’m afraid I can’t pay you back.”

“Why do you have to pay me back? Everything I’ve done for you is out of love. I’ve never thought of wanting you to pay me back. I–”

“No, I will pay you back eventually.” Monica interrupted Michael and said clearly, “By helping you this time, I’m paying you back what I once owed you.”

Michael was suddenly rendered speechless.

He thought that Monica had given up on Finn, so she would choose to return to his side.

Just like three years ago, Monica started dating him ever since Finn hurt her.

He had used so many methods to completely separate them, but Monica still rejected him in the end.

He suppressed his emotions and tried to control himself so that Monica would not realize how vicious he was.

He said, “I don’t need you to return anything to me.”

“I know very well that I will return it. I grew up with my parents pampering me, and before I met Finn, my life was smooth sailing. I didn’t need to work hard for a lot of things. From the moment I was born, I was way ahead of a lot of people. Therefore, I didn’t need to learn too many things growing up. I just had to know how to be grateful.” Monica was very calm.

After experiencing so many cruel things, Monica was surprisingly calm and rational.

She said, “That is why I’m most afraid of owing people favors. Once I owe people favors, I won’t be able to clear my conscience.”

Michael kept quiet.

Hence, Monica continued, “I’m sorry, Michael. I can’t accept your feelings for me. I hope you can stay away from me.”

“I’m sorry to have put you... in a difficult position.” Michael looked very upset.

However, Monica did not have a soft heart because she did not want to become so indecisive again.

She seemed to have seen through a lot of things regarding Finn.

“I’m helping you this time to repay all the good you’ve done me. In the future, I don’t want to owe you anything.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Can’t you try to like me?” Michael, on the contrary, did not agree.

He was trying to persuade her to stay.

“After Finn, there is no way I can fall in love with someone quickly. I’ve tried for three years and failed. I don’t want to try again,” Monica refused.

Therefore, no matter how Finn treated Monica, and even if Monica had completely let go of Finn, she was still in love with that man.

Michael suppressed his emotions.

“I’m sorry, Michael,” Monica apologized again. “The only thing I want to do now is to maintain this relationship with you until you regain your glory. I can only give you and this relationship another three months.”

After three months, she could no longer be entangled with Michael.

Even without Finn, she also did not want to mess up her relationship anymore.

Michael nodded silently.

Although Monica could see how sad he was, she did not give in to him.

In fact, Finn and Jeanne were right.
