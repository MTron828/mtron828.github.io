853 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

Jeanne bit her lip.

Except for her, they were all unimportant to Kingsley.

Lucy said, “I swear I didn’t see the descendant of the Duncans. While I did take off his mask and injured his face, I didn’t get to see his face at all.”

“I believe you.” Jeanne nodded.

If she had seen it, Lucy would definitely not have lived to tell the tale. It was because she didn’t see it that Edward spared Lucy’s life for her.

“Why didn’t you leave, then?” Jeanne asked her.

Lucy did not answer.

“You knew that you might have to face this when you came back. So why didn’t you leave?”

Lucy smiled.

She did not know how to reply. If she said that she could not bear to leave, would she sound ironic?

She had indeed anticipated the consequences of her return and made all the necessary preparations. Perhaps, she was also holding onto a trace of luck. Hoping that Kingsley might still be able to bear with her, but it was obvious she thought too highly of herself.

In Kingsley’s heart, she was just a useful pawn. An assassin. Occasionally, she could accompany him to bed, but he didn’t miss it. He had so many women, there was no need to miss any of them.

“You like Kingsley, don’t you?” Jeanne was almost certain of it.

“Isn’t liking someone a luxury for people like us?” Lucy smiled faintly. “Maybe I just didn’t know where else to go.”

The world was huge. How could there not be a place to go?!

“I’ve followed Kingsley since I was twenty-five years old. Though It’s been seven years, it feels more like seventy. It’s been so long that I thought the Hills would be my final home. If I had to die, it’d be here. That’s why I never thought of leaving.”

“You’ve never thought of leaving Kingsley, have you?” This was not about the Hills.

“No matter what.” Lucy did not refute.

“Is it worth it?” Jeanne asked her. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Was it worth it for the heartless Kingsley?

In this world, only she would treat Kingsley with her life. He didn’t need it from anyone else, nor did they owe him anything.

“I’ve never been calculative about gains and losses, so there’s no such thing as worth to me,” Lucy said.

Jeanne bit her lip and just stared at Lucy.

The feelings she had for him could just be very faint. However, if she did not really love him, why would she come back to suffer? She had such a good opportunity to leave this bloody place, but she chose to return anyway. With Lucy’s skill and strategy, she could live anywhere she wanted to. No one would be able to find her.

“Come on. I’ll take you out.” Jeanne supported Lucy.

“No need. I don’t want to cause a conflict between you and Kingsley.”

“I’ll deal with the elders of the Hills if they come looking for trouble. I won’t make things difficult for Kingsley.”

“I didn’t mean it that way.”

“If Kingsley comes to question me, I’ll explain it to him.”

“Jeanne….”

However, Jeanne was already helping Lucy up and leaving for the basement.

Melinda was waiting for them at the door. When she saw Jeanne taking Lucy away, her expression changed. She blocked their path and said, “No one is to take her away. These are Mr. Hill’s orders.”

There had actually been many people in the Hills who supported Lucy and pleaded for Kingsley’s mercy. However, Kingsley had rejected each and every one of them, sometimes even cruelly. In the end, no one dared say anything. Now Jeanne wanted to take Lucy away.

Melinda could not let Lucy leave ever again. If she did, it would affect her status.

“Move!” Jeanne shouted. Her face turned cold, looking very imposing.

Melinda gritted her teeth. Mr. Hill said that Lucy could not leave this place without his permission.

“I said, move!” Jeanne’s tone became more and more serious, and the aura she exuded was rather intense.

Melinda looked at her. Since Kingsley could not do anything to Jeanne, she would not dare to either. With Jeanne already so angry, Melinda said nothing more.

She bit her lip and backed away.

Jeanne helped Lucy back to her previous room, Melinda trailing behind them.

“Open the door,” Jeanne instructed Melinda.

Melinda hesitated.

“Open the door!” Jeanne demanded.

Melinda mustered up her courage. “This is my room now.”
