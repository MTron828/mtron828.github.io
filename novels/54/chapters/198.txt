Chapter 199: Don’t Be Afraid, I’ll Always Be With You

In any case, Jeanne was going to be sentenced today.

‘No matter how powerful Fourth Uncle is, can he forcefully save Jeanne from the law?!’ Eden thought.

He sneered.

His fourth uncle chose to do these things to Jeanne at this time. In the end, he would be slapped in the face!

Eden wanted to see what his fourth uncle would say to the media when Jeanne was sentenced!

Would his fourth uncle wait for Jeanne to be released from prison?!

If that was the case, without needing him to take revenge, his grandfather would already beat his fourth uncle to death.

“Eden,” Jasmine called out to Eden softly from the side.

Eden snapped back to his senses.

He held Jasmine’s hand and entered the court.

At this moment, Monica also rushed to the court in a hurry and was stopped by the reporters.

Monica was originally burning with anxiety, so she did not treat the reporters well. “All of you, stay away from me. I don’t want to talk to you.”

The reporters still surrounded Monica tightly.

“I’m telling you, Jeanne was wronged.

“All of you, move aside, move aside. I’m going in...” Monica was fuming.

If she had known earlier, she would have found someone to accompany her. She had forgotten how shameless the reporters from Harken were.

Just as she was about to explode…

“If you have any questions, we’ll only have answers after the court passes judgment. You won’t be able to get any answers even if you ask questions now?!” A male voice sounded from behind her.

Monica turned her head.

When she turned her head, she saw Micheal appear behind her.

Micheal smiled at Monica.

When the reporters saw Micheal appear, they immediately abandoned Monica.

Monica also regained her “freedom”.

Micheal was surrounded by the reporters instead. He quickly signaled for Monica to leave.

Monica reacted and smiled gratefully at Micheal. She quickly walked into the court.

It seemed that whenever she was in trouble, Micheal would always appear at the first moment.

Besides...

Were her eyes playing tricks on her? She seemed to have seen the back view of Finn, that scum.

In fact...

So what if she could not see him.

He would just stand by and watch anyway.

Monica panted heavily as she walked into the courtroom.

At this moment, the court staff was preparing. There were many people in the audience seats that Monica did not recognize. Even so, she knew that they were all people of high status. They were probably here to see for themselves the sensational case that had caused a stir in Harken and how Jeanne would be sentenced.

Monica swept her gaze around.

‘Eden brought that b*tch here as well?!

‘Is he here to watch Jeannie make a fool of herself?!

‘Damn it.’

Every time Monica saw Eden and Jasmine together, she could not help but want to kill someone.

Back then, it was that cheating couple that caused Jeanne to suffer so much!

“Monica,” someone called out to her.

Monica turned her head.

Nox waved his hand. “This way.”

Monica saw Fourth Master Swan sitting there.

Beside Fourth Master Swan were Nox and Finn.

She hesitated for a moment before walking over and sitting directly next to Finn.

It was not that she wanted to sit beside Finn, it was just that Nox sat by the aisle and that there were no seats beside him. Fourth Master Swan sat between Nox and Finn, and there were many seats beside Finn.

No matter how bad it was...

Monica still had an image.

To outsiders, she and Finn were still “husband and wife”.

She sat down.

Finn remained expressionless.

Monica did not put her attention on Finn either. She looked left and right.

Her eyes suddenly paused. “Isn’t that George?”

Fourth Master Swan obviously looked over there.

“Who’s the man next to him?” Monica was surprised. She looked him up and down for a long time and concluded, “He’s quite handsome.”

“Handsome? How handsome?!” Nox had a deep prejudice against Kingsley, so he did not want to hear any good words about him. “Is he as handsome as Fourth Master Swan?! He’s not even close.”

“...” Monica looked straight at Nox. “Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?!”

Nox rolled his eyes.

“I’ll go ask George.” Monica got up and was about to go over when her palm was suddenly grabbed by someone.

She looked down at Finn and saw him holding her hand tightly.

“It’s about to start,” Finn reminded her.

Monica pursed her lips.

At this moment, she saw Micheal walking into the courtroom.

As he walked in, he saw Monica and Finn’s physical contact from afar.

Monica pushed Finn’s hand away.

Finn’s eyes moved.

He naturally saw Micheal appear in the audience stand of the court.

Finn did not say anything else. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Monica also did not impulsively go to George’s side.

After all...

It was really going to start.
