1047 If She Fails, She’ll Get Back Up Again

At that moment, she could not help but frown.

That kind of mental endurance was definitely not what a top assassin should have.

Kingsley observed the expression on her face.

“Mr. Thorn,” Kerby called out to him respectfully.

Kingsley shifted his gaze away from Lucy and to the target that the two of them had just hit.

“Did you do that?” he asked Kerby.

“Yes,” Kerby said respectfully.

“Shoot two rounds with me.”

Kerby was flattered, and the next second, he quickly agreed, “Yes.”

Lucy just stood there and watched the two of them shoot.

...

Kingsley was actually very skilled.

Very few people had seen his skills but Lucy had. Therefore, it was within her expectations that Kerby would be crushed.

Kerby, however, was a little shocked. After all, Kerby was the most outstanding out of his batch of assassins.

“K01 and Lucy both have high hopes for you. They said you’re the rising star of the Hills. Don’t let them down.” Kingsley left after firing his gun.

Kerby stared at Kingsley’s back.

Then, he suddenly said to Lucy, “Ms. Harmon, I think I have a new goal.”

“What is it?”

“My goal is no longer to surpass K01 but to surpass Mr. Thorn.”

Lucy smiled.

When Kingsley was young, he was really amazing.

She said, “We’ll talk after you’ve sorted your body out.”

...

Kerby was embarrassed.

“How about I sleep with you tonight?” Lucy said in a composed manner. It was as if she was talking about the weather today.

Kerby looked at Lucy in a daze. He was completely dumbfounded.

“Mr. Thorn has told me to help you out.”

The flirtatious words made Kerby a little shy.

Kingsley also happened to hear that sentence, so he left and came back with the intention of taking Lucy away.

However, upon hearing Lucy’s voice, he left again. When he left, his expression was extremely cold.

The two high-level assassins by Kingsley’s side really felt like they had been living their days walking on eggshells!

…

In South Hampton City, Monica was sitting in her office in the Cardellini Enterprise building, looking at the documents in front of her.

All the pharmaceutical companies that used to work with Cardellini Enterprise had rejected the offer to cooperate, and she did not even have the chance to meet them.

...

They were probably afraid of falling into the same trap as Harry Chance did.

Cardellini Enterprise was in a critical situation. Now that the stock price had hit rock bottom, they could face bankruptcy at any time.

Monica stared at the financial report sent to her by the finance department.

According to the current situation, the sooner Cardellini Enterprise declared bankruptcy, the more they could cut their losses.

She picked up the phone. “Mr. Burts.”

“Chairman.”

“Call Steve in for me.”

“Yes.”

Steve soon appeared in her office.

“Do you think there’s still a chance for Cardellini Enterprise to turn things around? Just like what the finance department said, declaring bankruptcy is the greatest help to cut our losses,” Monica said.

“Yes.” Steve nodded.

...

He, too, was at his wits ‘end.

The current market had been completely dominated by Sunny Pharmaceutical. If Cardellini Enterprise continued to struggle like that, they would really end up with nothing.

“But…” Monica said, “I don’t agree.”

Steve looked at her.

“So, I’m going to continue.”

Even if she was courting death, she would never give up.

She asked, “Have we gotten all the penalty fees from the research and development personnel who resigned?”

“We’ve got them all,” Steve said respectfully.

“Let’s follow our previous plan and have the lawyer sue them.”

“Yes.” Steve nodded.

It was good to sue.

...

After all, she had to let the other party suffer a blow and teach those people who hit her when she was down a lesson.

“You may leave.”

“Chairman…”

“I’m fine.” Monica smiled.

Everything was hitting her a little too hard, and she was somewhat exhausted. However, she would not fall just like that.

In the afternoon, Monica received a call from Michael, but she did not take it.

She knew very well why Michael was calling her. It was because she had sued those research and development personnel who resigned and dealt Michael another blow.

Since she was going to go bankrupt anyway, what could not she do? Why could she not offend him?

She still wanted to make things worse.

With that, she called Nox to post all the benefits that the research and development staff had received from Sunny Pharmaceutical on the Internet.

They did not go through the media, but through George, who opened a web forum and pinned the post at the top. No matter what, the post could not be taken down.

...

At that moment, everyone started to go against Sunny Pharmaceutical, saying how despicable the latter was.

The public could not believe that they had used unscrupulous means to take advantage of the situation, and some people even proposed boycotting Sunny Pharmaceutical’s drugs.

However, the pressure to boycott them was very weak.

After all, all the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals were using Sunny Pharmaceutical’s drugs. If they did not use those drugs, they would have nothing.

In the face of life and death, everyone would still choose to survive.

Therefore, even if the public was bashing Sunny Pharmaceutical, they would still use their drugs.

Even so, Sunny Pharmaceutical’s reputation was greatly affected, and Michael was once again scolded by Warren Sanders.

First of all, they had lost all of their talents after spending so much money poaching them, causing them to lose more than 10 million dollars for nothing.

Secondly, the benefits given to the research and development team were all exposed. Some of the benefits even required a certain amount of power to fulfill, which had led people to suspect that Sunny Pharmaceutical’s operation was related to the Sanders. That was against the positive image of the Sanders.

Michael put down his phone, his expression grim.

Everything was still under his control, and he was even starting to find out what he wanted. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, Monica was fighting him with desperate attacks that inflicted damage on him and also on her but on a smaller scale!

As the saying went, those who were poor did not fear those in power. Michael had a feeling that Monica was going against him like she wanted to take him down with her!

He could not let Monica ruin his big plan!

His eyes flickered as he picked up the phone and said to his assistant, “Arrange a dinner for me!”

He smiled coldly.

Monica was really too inexperienced!

In Cardellini Enterprise, Monica was in the office when she received a call from the company’s shareholders who were all persuading her not to persist. They did not blame her and knew that she had tried her best.

In fact, getting the understanding of the shareholders was good enough, but Monica refused, destroying the shareholders’ goodwill!

She hung up the phone.

Right now, she did not even feel guilty. She was just really numb to everything!

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

Monica responded and heard Steve say somewhat excitedly, “I just received news that Richie Sanchez, a pharmaceutical agent from the central-southern region, has a dinner party in South Hampton City tonight. Do you want to go and meet him? He used to work with Cardellini Enterprise and is friends with your father. Perhaps this will be our chance of survival!”
