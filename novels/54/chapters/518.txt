Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Reese was a little agitated as she did not expect Monica to be so clear-minded. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

She had always thought that Monica was a simple-minded woman who could even be so kind sometimes that she could be taken advantage of.

Reese said, “If you think it’s unfair to Finn, do you think it’s fair to Michael? Michael needs you the most right now, yet you’re abandoning him just like that. Have you thought about what he’s going through? His father just passed away, and if he also has to suffer from the impact of his career, do you think he can survive? You’ve never been in politics before, so you won’t know that falling from power is not the same as never having had it. This might even destroy the Rosses!”

Monica did not think too much into it even though Reese said it sincerely and did not seem like she was exaggerating.

However, she remained unmoved. “Auntie, I can understand where you and Michael are coming from, but we’ve broken up already, and what Michael encounters has nothing to do with me anymore. I can help if I have the ability, but if I don’t, I can only let go. And now, I know full well that I have no way to help Michael rebuild his image because this rebuilding will take me a lifetime to do. I can’t afford it.”

Monica spoke very firmly, rendering Reese speechless.

Monica knew that once she was involved in the relationship, it would be difficult for her to get out of it in the future.

After all, having a good image was very important in politics. Things like divorce and adultery would damage one’s image, so a politician had to steer clear of them. It meant that if Monica agreed to help Michael restore his image, Monica was likely to help Michael for the rest of her life unless Michael gave up on his future.

However, Michael would never give up on his career. If he did, he would give up now. There was no need for him to wait until then.

Seeing that Monica had thought things through, Reese stopped arguing and said, “In that case, tell me, Monica. What will it take for you to start over with Michael? I know the two of you used to be in love. Whatever you want, I will grant you your wish as long as you get together with Michael again.”

“I’m sorry. I don’t like Michael anymore,” Monica said bluntly.

Reese looked at her and said sadly, “It was Michael’s father and my fault. We–”

“No. I’ve always liked Finn. Even if you didn’t stop me back then, I don’t think I would end up with Michael either. I might’ve even gone to look for Finn impulsively, so it’s not your fault. What you did was right. If I had cheated on Michael back then, Michael would have been hurt even more. I also believe that both your resistance back then allowed me to be together with the love of my life.”

At that moment, Reese was truly speechless.

She had originally planned to lie to Monica and make use of Monica’s sympathy for Michael to get her to put up a show with Michael. Once she agreed to it, it would be a piece of cake for them to be together in the future. After all, they had done so much so that Monica would be together with Michael.

That was an order from their leader. If they could not complete it, the Rosses would be done for.

Therefore, when she realized she could not lie to Monica, she thought of playing the emotional card since Monica and Michael used to be in love with each other. She wanted to apologize to Monica and fulfill any request she had as long as she was together with Michael.

Never did she expect Monica would say that she had always liked Finn and that she was very grateful for their resistance against her and Michael being together back then.

In the end, did she not humiliate herself instead?

She had always thought that Monica was not a crafty person, but at that moment, she suddenly felt that she had underestimated Monica.

Monica said it so well, and instead of blaming them, she seemed to have mocked Reese.

Seeing that Reese did not say anything else, Monica stood up and said, “Auntie, regarding Michael’s matter, there’s really nothing I can do.”

After that, she left determinedly.

Reese stared at Monica’s silhouette, and her expression twisted.

She did not expect that she would be defeated by that woman one day!
