948 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

“What’s wrong?” Monica directly went to her mother’s accompanying bed.

Other than Ruby, Sarah was also on the bed.

Sarah had been accompanying them in the hospital for the past two days, and it was not in vain that her mother treated Sarah so well. Sarah was not too heartless, after all.

“Aunty is not used to sleeping on a bed that’s not her own,” Sarah suddenly said, keeping her voice as low as possible, afraid of waking her uncle.

Only then did Monica remember that her mother was not used to sleeping on a bed other than her own.

She had been so busy the past two days that she felt like she had not been able to take care of anything.

She said, “Mom, why don’t you go back? I’ll stay with dad tonight.”

“No, I’ll be able to sleep if I’m tired.” Ruby refused flatly.

“Mom, your health is more important than dad’s right now. Who’s going take care of you if you torture your body like that? Who’s going to take care of dad?” Monica was a little agitated. “Just listen to me, go back, take a good bath, and rest. Come back tomorrow morning. Anyway, dad is asleep now, so there’s no point in you accompanying him.

Ruby wanted to say something, but Monica continued, “Mom, after what happened to dad, I’m really afraid that something will happen to either of you. If something happens to you, I won’t be able to take it.”

Ruby looked at her daughter in the dark.

At that moment, her heart ached.

She had never thought that one day, her daughter would have to shoulder everything in the family.

She said, “Monica, I’m sorry that it’s been hard on you.”

“It’s not. As long as you and dad are alive, nothing is hard.” Monica hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. I don’t want to think about anything else now. I just want you and dad to be safe and sound. Mom, as long as you and dad are well, I’m willing to do anything.”

Ruby’s eyes turned watered at her daughter’s words.

“Promise me that you’ll take good care of yourself, okay?” Monica asked her expectantly.

Ruby hesitated, but she nodded in the end.

“Sarah,” Monica called out to Sarah, who was sleeping beside Ruby. “Can you accompany my mom back to get some rest?”

“Alright,” Sarah agreed and quickly got out of bed.

“If anything happens to your father, you must call me,” Ruby reminded her worriedly.

“Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of dad for you.”

“You should remember to rest too. You have a lot on your plate at work.”

“I know. Don’t worry about it. Hurry back.”

“Alright, alright, alright.” Ruby could not argue with her daughter, so she had to keep agreeing.

With that, Ruby left the ward with Sarah.

After Monica watched them leave, she returned to her father’s bed and saw that he was sleeping with difficulty.

His heart was weak, so he should be in great pain.

Monica’s eyes reddened.

In fact, she knew that her father would still undergo heart transplant surgery. If he did not do it, Finn would not have brought it up so often or contacted her about the heart donation for her father. The reason why Finn did not confirm that her father would definitely do the surgery was probably that he wanted them to be mentally prepared.

It had to be said that Finn’s strategy was right.

At least, when she first heard that her father needed a heart transplant, she rejected the idea. Yet now, she was willing to wait for the right time for her father’s heart transplant.

She stayed with her father for a long time. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After making sure that her father was sound asleep, she carefully walked into the bathroom, planning to take a shower and go to bed.

She had slept in the office the entire night before, so even though she had removed her makeup in the morning, not taking a shower still made her feel uncomfortable.

She turned on the light in the bathroom, and when she looked at herself in the mirror, she was stunned.

F*ck.

She leaned closer.

Was her face disfigured? Why did she not notice such a long scratch?

At that moment, because the scratch was turning into a scab, it was very obvious on her face.

It was not just the scratch on her face. When she pulled open her clothes, her neck and even her collarbones had several similar scratch marks.

However, on second thought, she did not blame the woman. After all, it was the woman’s son who was dead. No one would be able to remain calm.

Monica sighed, took off her clothes, and took a shower.

As she did not have any clothes to change into, she used the hospital gown that the hospital had prepared. Although it was loose, she could wear it.

After her shower, she lay on the bed and sent Sarah a message. “When you come over tomorrow morning, bring a set of clothes and innerwear for me. It has to be slightly more formal.”
