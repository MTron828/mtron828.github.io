Chapter 635: Monica Was Drunk and Walked Into the Wrong Door

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Forget it.

Now that he had seen what the world was made of, Alexander felt relieved instead.

The knot in his heart... Suddenly, he seemed to have let go of the fact that Jeanne was not his daughter.

Now that he had nothing, he actually had a sliver of conscience. He felt that he owed Jeanne a lot.

Regardless of whether Jeanne was his daughter or not, she was innocent in the feud between him and Penelope, and she had been suffering from his unfair treatment.

The only thing he could do to make up for Jeanne now was to not tell anyone that she was not his biological daughter.

If no one knew, Jeanne still had the right to inherit Alexander’s inheritance.

That was it!

Alexander suddenly laughed out loud like a maniac.

At that moment, he did not seem to feel any pain.

He laughed madly until he suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and could not laugh anymore.

He had bitten his tongue and committed suicide.

When that news came out, Jeanne was lying on Edward’s big bed by herself. She did not sleep and just stared blankly at the ceiling above her head.

Her mood was very low, and her mind was filled with the conversation she had with Alexander today.

Of course, she was not pitying Alexander, for he did not deserve any pity.

She was just trying to imagine the scene of her mother’s death from what Alexander told her. As she did that, she became sadder, and it showed on her face.

Just then, the phone rang.

Jeanne took a look at the caller and just watched as the phone rang.

A second before the call ended, she picked it up and answered it.

Her voice was low and hoarse.

She was not crying, but she suddenly could not make any sound.

She said, “Kingsley.”

Kingsley, on the other end of the phone, suddenly paused.

He swallowed the words that were at the tip of his tongue and asked, “Does it hurt?”

“Probably.”

“Are you soft-hearted toward Alexander?”

“No.” Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. “I was trying to imagine how my mother looked when she died. She didn’t leave any last words. When she died, her face was disfigured.”

Kingsley said, “Don’t think about it.”

“So, what you said is true,” Jeanne muttered.

Kingsley’s throat bobbed.

“I actually doubted you for a while,” Jeanne said calmly. Her depressed mood was obvious.

“I know.”

“I thought you just wanted to use me.”

Kingsley listened quietly.

“However, it’s true. Jonathan and Alexander really did kill my mother,” Jeanne said. As she said that, tears flowed down from the corners of her eyes.

“Although you can’t bring your mother back from the dead, at least now, the two culprits who killed your mother have received their retribution,” Kingsley said. “Alexander is also dead.”

Jeanne was stunned.

For a second, she thought she had heard wrongly.

“He committed suicide in prison by biting his tongue!”

Jeanne’s hand that was holding the phone tightened unconsciously. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She did not think Alexander would choose such a method.

She even thought Alexander did not have the courage to die, but she never thought he would choose the cruelest way to end his life.

“So, don’t be too sad. I believe your mother can finally rest in peace. At least, she has rested for half of her life!” Kingsley comforted her.

When Jeanne was really sad, he would try his best to lift her up.

Actually, she was not feeling too bad.

She was definitely not sad to hear news of Alexander’s death. She was just not as happy as she had imagined!

She felt that it was a matter of course.

On second thought, Alexander most likely felt miserable toward the end of his life.

However, she would not be the only one to feel indifferent to his death as Jenifer, Jasmine, and Joshua probably would not feel sad too.

“I’m fine,” Jeanne told Kingsley.

She was fine and could quickly adjust her state of mind.

After all, her mother would not want to see her so depressed, and taking revenge on the Lawrences was just the tip of the iceberg in the matter of her mother’s death.

What she really needed to deal with was still to come!

“It’s good that you’re fine. If there’s anything, you can call me anytime.”

“Okay.”

“In that case, I’ll hang up now,” Kingsley said.

“Uncle,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

Kingsley could feel his heart beating at an unusually fast rate, but he tried his best to seem as calm as possible.
