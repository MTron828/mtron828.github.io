Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Monica finished washing up, Finn, too, had finished washing up.

Breakfast was delivered to the room by the staff. The two of them sat at the dining table in front of the large floor-to-ceiling windows and ate breakfast.

The sun was shining brightly, and the light spilled onto the dining table, creating a resplendent scene.

“I have a meeting about a collaboration in the morning. Then, I’ll have lunch with them and visit their pharmaceutical factory in the afternoon. Logically speaking, I should be back after dinner,” Monica said as she told Finn about her schedule for the day.

Finn was a little surprised. He did not expect Monica to take the initiative to tell him that. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“So, you can go about on your own during the day,” Monica said coldly, making it impossible for Finn to tell her emotions.

Finn said, “Can I accompany you?”

“I don’t think you should.”

“You’re pregnant. I’m worried about you being too far away from me, especially in this foreign country.”

“Haven’t you seen me? I’m fine. I don’t feel nausea at all.” Monica frowned, clearly displeased.

“There will be no signs of it most of the time, and sometimes, it might happen when you eat something that upsets your stomach,” Finn said seriously. Just as Monica was about to retort, Finn said, “I won’t disturb you.”

“Even if you don’t disturb me, what do you think the company I’m supposed to negotiate with will think? I don’t want them to think that I’m too pretentious.”

“To the public, you can introduce me as your subordinate. Why don’t I be your secretary? It just so happens that your secretary isn’t here,” Finn suggested.

Monica pursed her lips, speechless. She did not think that far ahead, but it was true that she did not want him to follow her because she did not want the other party to think that she was too pretentious. If he was her secretary…

Finn saw her hesitate and quickly said, “I definitely won’t interrupt your negotiation. ”

Monica did not say anything else, which meant that she had tacitly agreed to it.

A smile appeared on Finn’s face. He was like a child who wanted to go out with his parents and was rejected at first but was overjoyed when they suddenly agreed. However, he tried very hard to hide his smile.

Monica, on the other hand, shifted her gaze as she did not want to be affected by Finn.

After the two of them had breakfast, Finn was dressed in a suit and leather shoes. He followed Monica, who was also dressed formally, out of the room.

Brandon watched them leave together and felt a little disgusted. Looking at them, it gave him a feeling that his presence was not needed.

The three of them arrived at Casterbridge’s largest pharmaceutical company in the hotel’s private car, where the staff received them warmly and respectfully. It was also Finn’s first time seeing Monica at work.

He knew that Monica had changed a lot, or she would not have been able to manage a company well. However, when he really saw her socializing, he was still a little surprised at how much Monica had changed. Now, no matter where she was, who she was facing, or how many people she was facing, she was reserved and calm. She even had a powerful presence.

In front of the heads of a large corporation, or even a middle-aged man who was more than ten years older than her, she could command herself well.

Both sides seemed to be negotiating politely and amicably, but in reality, they were both very aggressive. They were giving each other the greatest benefits.

In the end, Finn believed Monica was the winner. The other company was convinced by her words and finally signed a trade contract with her. A contract worth tens of billions was finalized in just an hour.

Suddenly, Finn had a feeling that Monica was beyond his reach. It made him think that if he had been a little careless, Monica would really have left him.

Thank goodness that he realized it soon enough and caught her in time, just as she was about to leave. Now, he would not let go of her even if he was dead.

After the contract was negotiated, the other party naturally invited them to have lunch together. Lunch was at a famous high-class restaurant in Casterbridge.

As Monica had only brought two people with her, the other company, as the host, brought more guests along. However, because they made Monica feel pressured, they only had two more people than Monica’s group. Therefore, there were eight people at the table.

In the business world, positions were important, so Monica and Finn were arranged to be separated..
