957 I Can’t Think of a Title Anymore, Let’s See What the Officials Do

Lucy pursed her lips.

In response to Kingsley’s action, she could only accept it.

“Mr. Thorn.” When the aesthetician saw Kingsley coming in, he greeted him respectfully.

Kingsley glanced at the aesthetician, who was a man.

In fact, other than some women who did skincare and massage, all the doctors here were male.

Kingsley watched as the male aesthetician’s hand slowly ran over Lucy’s naked body.

“Is this how scars are removed?” Kingsley asked.

“Yes, Mr. Thorn.” The male doctor quickly replied, “If the scar is too deep, we will perform surgery to remove it. After the removal, we will use a laser to polish it. Slowly, it will become exactly like the original skin. Now, Ms. Harmon only has the last stage to go through.”

“So there are many stages?”

“Ms. Harmon has been working on it for half a month. She comes here every day,” the doctor replied immediately.

“Every day.” Kingsley sneered.

Then, he turned around and led Millie away.

Millie could not understand Kingsley’s expression either. It was an indescribable feeling. She felt that he seemed a little angry, but he also seemed like his usual self.

She could not and did not want to figure it out.

She had to admit that Lucy had a great figure, which she had never noticed before. She had always felt that because she was young, she had more assets than Lucy.

However, having taken one look at Lucy, she started to feel inferior.

Not only did she have a good figure, but her skin also looked very fair and tender. It was completely different from what she had imagined. A woman in her thirties should have loose skin, but even she, a woman, found Lucy very attractive.

Millie was starting to feel threatened.

It was no wonder Lucy could stay by Kingsley’s side for so long.

It seemed like she really could not underestimate that woman.

…

After Kingsley left, the aesthetician in the beauty room could not help but ask in a low voice, “Was Mr. Thorn dissatisfied with me just now?”

“Why do you think so?” Lucy smiled.

“His gaze felt strange.”

“When has he not had that look in his eyes?”

“That’s true.” The aesthetician smiled.

Kingsley did not really care about the manor’s internal affairs.

He did not have any special requirements for the staff members who were not assassins and would not kill them for no reason.

In fact, the people who worked here, other than not having much freedom, lived quite well.

After receiving three hours of cosmetic treatment, Lucy put on her clothes and left.

In fact, the laser still hurt a little when it hit the body. However, for assassins like them, it would not feel like much.

Lucy walked toward her room, and the moment she pushed the door open, she paused.

The person waiting for her in her room was not Jeanne but Kingsley.

To be honest, she was a little surprised, but he would not show it. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She walked over and appeared very respectful. “Mr. Thorn, is there anything you need me to do?”

“Strip!” Kingsley’s face suddenly darkened.

Lucy gulped.

“I told you to take off your clothes!” Kingsley enunciated each word.

Lucy had rarely seen Kingsley lose his temper for no reason.

He had a bad temper, but he would only fly into a rage when something happened.

Nevertheless, Lucy undid her silk nightgown.

Jeanne was right. She could not fall for a man like Kingsley. The only thing she could do was to please him so that she could live a better life here.

She took off all her clothes and faced Kingsley.

Instead of touching her, Kingsley just stared at her.

She did not know what kind of gaze he was looking at her with.

Although the heating in the villa was sufficient, Kingsley had opened the floor-to-ceiling window on the balcony. He was probably smoking on the balcony, and the cigarette butt was still burning in his hand.

However, she was really cold. It was early winter, and the cold wind gave her goosebumps.

Nevertheless, the man standing in front of her was Kingsley, so she did not dare to show anything, not even a frown.

Just as she was wondering what Kingsley was going to do and how long he was going to be in a stalemate with her, Kingsley pressed the cigarette butt that was still burning in his hand on Lucy’s collarbone.

Lucy pursed her lips as she felt the painful sting. The burning hot cigarette left a deep mark on her skin.

She really did not know how she had offended that old man again. Kingsley was evil and fierce, but he had never tortured her for no reason.

She just endured it and did not say anything.

Kingsley only threw the cigarette butt away after it was completely extinguished at Lucy’s collarbone.

After throwing it away, he still did not say a word.

As for Lucy, she could only endure the pain from the burns and keep quiet.

The temperature in the room was getting colder and colder, and Lucy was starting to freeze.

“Keep it,” Kingsley suddenly said.

Lucy did not understand what he meant.

He said, “Keep the scar here for me.”

His tone was cold and commanding.

“Yes.” Lucy nodded.

Since when did she dare to disobey his orders?

Fortunately, Kingsley left after he finished speaking. He just came and went.

Lucy sneered.

After Kingsley left, she quickly closed the floor-to-ceiling window. Then, he returned to the bathroom and quickly rinsed her body with warm water.

She could not catch a cold.

As an assassin, the first thing she had to do was to ensure that she was absolutely healthy. Only when she was in good health could she ensure her own safety.

That had almost become instinctive, and instinctively, her eyes turned red.

Jeanne said that she could not have feelings for Kingsley. However, once there were feelings, it was too difficult to take them back.

When Lucy came out of the bathroom again, Jeanne was waiting for her in the room.

Jeanne said, “I need to go back for a while.”

“What?” Lucy’s eyes flickered.

She tugged at her clothes to cover up the scar that Kingsley left behind, as well as all her emotions.

“I’m worried about Monica,” Jeanne said bluntly.

She did not think that the quality inspection department, or rather, Michael, would really let Monica off.

“When are you leaving?”

“Tonight, when we celebrate Kingsley’s birthday.”

Lucy nodded.

“Do you think I’m cruel?” Jeanne asked.

It was rare for Kingsley to celebrate his birthday, but she wanted to take the opportunity to leave.

More importantly, she was doing it without him knowing.

Kingsley would probably die of anger when he learned of it.

“No, it’s not cruel.” Lucy enunciated every word.
