Chapter 847 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

“But I’ve always been home late, even since I was young.”

“You still have the cheek to be smug,” Gary said sternly.

Monica pouted.

“Go put on your slippers. It’s late fall. Aren’t you cold?” Gary was speechless.

Monica hurriedly went to the entrance and changed into a pair of slippers.

“You don’t even know how to take care of yourself.”

“That’s why I’m relying on you guys for the rest of my life.” Monica smiled brightly.

Since her relationships have not been going so well, she felt that she would be alone for the rest of her life. Now, she had to please her parents so she would not be chased out of the house.

“You’re talking nonsense again.” Gary chided.

“Dad,” she whined and sat beside her father.

What Gary could not stand most was her sudden act of obedience. She would lose her principles every time.

“I won’t marry Michael, okay?”

“You said you—”

“I really don’t like him. I’m afraid that after I marry him, I’d end up like how Finn was back then.”

Gary stayed silent.

“I was young before, but I’m all grown up now. I can’t keep making mistakes. I just want to live with you and mom now.”

“You can’t stay single forever.”

“What’s wrong with being single for the rest of my life? If you’re afraid that I won’t carry on our family’s bloodline, I can just make a test-tube baby. I can even make twins— Ah!” Monica hugged her head.

She felt that she had been beaten silly by her father since she was young.

“Don’t joke.”

“I’m not. I don’t want to get married now, and I don’t want to be with anyone either. Could you not force me? I’ve been hurt deeply and emotionally.” Monica’s eyes were a little red, feeling very aggrieved. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Gary swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth due to the sight of his daughter’s tears.

“Dad, please believe me. I know what I want, and I’m sure that I have no feelings for Michael.” She hated this man to the core.

“Monica, I’m just afraid you’ll be alone at the end.”

“There’s really wrong with that. In this day and age, women don’t have to rely on men to live,” Monica said very seriously. “Don’t worry. Once I’ve settled my personal affairs, I’ll follow you to the company and work hard. In the future, I’ll carry on our family’s business.”

“You?” Gary smiled helplessly. “I didn’t even count on you.”

“Dad,” Monica was angry. Was she that unreliable?

“Alright, alright. As long as you know what you’re doing, I’ll do as you say.” Gary compromised.

He always pretended to be strict with her, but in reality, he would agree to her every request.

“It’s late. Head upstairs and get some sleep.” Gary stood up from the sofa and left.

Monica just stared at her father’s back.

He had clearly been worried about when she would be home and waited for her. She had such good parents. She must cherish them.

Especially when she thought of Jeanne’s inhuman father, she felt really blessed.

“Dad,” Monica suddenly called out to him.

“Is there anything else?” Gary turned around.

“I think you should… prepare your heart medicine when you go to work tomorrow.”

“What’s wrong?”

“I’m afraid you’ll vomit blood when you hear my news.”

“What are you planning on doing now?!” Gary’s face darkened. Could his daughter not stop for even half a second?

“Just brace yourself.”

“…”

“I love you, dad.” Monica suddenly confessed and ran upstairs, “Goodnight.”

Gary was really afraid of Monica.

Fortunately, his tolerance for her had built up over the years. As long as she did not commit suicide, he could accept whatever Monica did.

However, when he saw the news about Monica the next day, he was about ready to vomit blood. Gary had been diligent all his life and had never done anything outrageous. He even worked in a medical company with a conscience. So how could he have given birth to a daughter like Monica? He simply refused to read Monica’s news. He was too pissed off!

In fact, Monica was also afraid to look at it. After all, she was embarrassed to expose her coquettish appearance to the media. When she first gave George the video and photos, she was afraid it would affect George’s health. Fortunately, George was a cold person and had not reacted at all. He treated it as a task and posted her footage and photos onto the internet headlines.
