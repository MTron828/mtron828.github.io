1104 Announcing Jeanne’s Identity As The Princess of the Sanders

“Leader, if you have something to say, just say it.”

“I want to hand over the matter of finding the Duncans’ descendants to you,” Warren said.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

He replied, “As a member of Harken, I naturally have the responsibility to share the leader’s worries, so I won’t reject your request of me. However, Nox isn’t as capable as people say, and the Winters aren’t as powerful as the rumors say. I can only do my best, but I can’t guarantee that I can give you a satisfactory result.”

“That’s not important. All I ask is that you put some effort into it.” Warren made himself clear. “I just don’t want to waste too much of my time. I should have more time to deal with national affairs.”

“Yes,” Edward replied respectfully. “It’s my honor to be able to share your burden.”

Warren patted Edward’s shoulder and said, “I’ll leave it to you then.”

“I’ll definitely do my best,” Edward promised.

Then, Warren nodded. “It’s getting late. The wedding is about to start.”

Edward quickly stood up from the sofa. “In that case, I shall not waste more of your time.”

“Edward,” Warren called out to him again the moment he left.

Edward was still very respectful.

“I won’t mistreat you for helping me.” Warren said, “You’ll know that the Swans and the Sanders are actually one family.”

“Thank you, Leader.”

“You may leave.” Warren waved his hand.

With that, Edward left Warren’s study.

After leaving, a man walked out from behind the screen in the study. It was Warren’s eldest son, Chester.

Warren would naturally do his best to groom Chester, who was the heir to the throne.

“Father.” Chester appeared to be very respectful. “Edward is not a simple person indeed. Even under our threats and temptations, he did not lose his composure.”

“So, it won’t be easy for us to touch him.” Warren’s expression turned cold. “The fact that he came to our residence alone with such a domineering attitude today and even faced my conversation with a straight face is enough to show that he has the confidence to escape unscathed.”

“It means that if we make a move today, we might end up in a situation that we can’t control.”

Warren nodded.

“In that case…” Chester did not know what decision to make.

He knew that the Swans could already threaten the Sanders, so if the Swans were not eliminated, they would definitely become a great threat. However, if they were not eliminated properly, they would also become a great hidden danger for the Sanders.

Right now, the Sanders were forced into a dilemma.

“We’ll let them kill each other,” Warren said viciously with a sinister look in his eyes.

“Father, you’re saying...”

“That’s right. We still have a trump card.” Warren sneered. “Jeanne.”

Chester’s expression turned cold.

He knew that his father’s plan would never go wrong.

The Swans had planned everything, but never in a million years would they imagine that Jeanne was a daughter of the Sanders!

…

Edward returned to the ceremony hall.

At 11:18 a.m., the wedding ceremony began.

Everyone quietly watched the overly procedural wedding in front of them.

The clapping was done under the guidance of the staff. Every single reaction was instructed, and some were even a little too serious.

Once the wedding ended, all the guests moved to the banquet hall in the Sanders’ residence. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

For a ceremony with thirty people, there were only three tables. Including the Sanders’ round table, there were four tables in total.

The banquet hall was not gorgeously decorated and even seemed a little too simple.

After everyone was seated, they waited for the meal to begin.

Before dinner, Chester went up the stage to give his thanks on behalf of Warren.

After all, Warren was the leader of a country. He naturally could not be too polite to subordinates, which would be beneath his status.

Chester picked up the microphone and said to everyone seriously. “Good afternoon, everyone! Thank you very much for coming to my little sister and brother-in-law, Stacey and William’s wedding. On behalf of the Sanders, I sincerely thank you for coming.”

The audience burst into applause and ended in the next second.

“My younger sister and my brother-in-law, Stacey and William, they...” He then went on to tell their relationship history.

Even though Chester’s tone was a little too serious, at the very least, it was a blessing to the newlywed couple. Hence, it did not give the impression that it was an official statement by the Sanders.

“Lastly, I’ve been entrusted by my father to wish my little sister and my brother-in-law, Stacey and William, a lifetime of love and care for each other. He also hopes that they will not forget their purpose to repay the country and society. Here, I wish both of you a happy marriage.”

Another round of applause broke out. This time, it lasted for a slightly longer time, but it ended in an instant.

Just when everyone thought that the toast was over, Chester stayed on the stage. He seemed a little emotional, which was different from the usual him.

He took a deep breath and said, “On this joyous day, the Sanders has a piece of good news that we hope to share with everyone.”

Everyone’s attention was attracted by that sentence.

Perhaps everyone was bored from following along with all the instructions during the wedding ceremony just now because, at that moment, their interests were piqued.

After all, everyone knew about the wedding and knew that they had to go through the motions. However, no one knew about the other happy news.

Some people started to wonder if Stacey was pregnant or…

...

Of course, it did not seem like a good idea to announce her pregnancy at a wedding.

Harken was a country that took tradition very seriously. Although they did not reject a non-married couple from living together, living together after marriage was much preferred.

As the rulers of Harken, the Sanders naturally would not insult themselves like that.

Just as everyone was deep in thought, Chester finally spoke. He announced loudly, “The Sanders have a missing daughter, and she has returned!”

After he said that, the crowd was in an uproar as they were really surprised by that piece of news.

What did he mean by that? Did the Sanders have a missing daughter? Did that mean that other than his five children, the leader had another child?

Who was it? How could they be lost? Why was he or she back now?

Everyone’s mind was filled with questions until a figure walked onto the stage before everyone’s eyes.

She was wearing a light blue dress, which made her look like the daughter of a humble family. It was completely different from the feeling she gave off before. At that moment, she seemed to have restrained all her brilliance and have obediently become the lovely princess of the Sanders. She looked so pure and… beautiful.

Edward’s eyes were fixed on her. He watched as the woman, who had disappeared from his side and had cruelly stood him up, appear in front of him again in a way that he could never have imagined.

There was a distance of two tables between them, but from then on, it felt like they were separated by a mountain that could not be crossed.

...

At the scene, everyone looked at Jeanne.

They all knew her. After all, that woman had become extremely popular in South Hampton City not long ago, and everyone knew who she was.

Yet now, she went from rags to riches.

Everyone was shocked, but no one dared to ask a single question.

Chester said, “Back then, my father was assigned to investigate a huge incident that jeopardized the interests of the country. He made a mistake and was discovered by the other party. Fortunately, in the midst of danger, Jeanne’s mother came to his rescue, and the two of them put on an act. However, we didn’t expect that Jeanne would be left behind as a product of that act. If Jeanne’s uncle had not told us the truth recently, we wouldn’t have known that Jeanne was the daughter of the Sanders. Perhaps Jeanne’s appearance will cause a lot of controversies, but for now, we have to give her a legitimate and bright identity. From now on, her name will be Jeanne Sanders!”
