Chapter 1402: Finn Drinking His Sorrow Away

“But I still managed to subdue him.” Zoe was a little proud.

“When do you plan to marry Nox?”

“In another year and a half.” Zoe said, “I have subdued Nox, but he hasn’t subdued me yet!”

“Aren’t you afraid you’ll fail?”

“If you’re so worried about me, why did you ask me out?”

“I’m a person with good character too, and I’ve never made things difficult for a woman. If you really get together with Nox, I’ll bear the pain and give up on you.” As the man spoke, he moved his face closer to Zoe’s mouth and kissed her again and again.

Shelly looked away. However, she could still hear their conversation.

Zoe said, “You may say that, but your body isn’t as honest as you are.”

“You’re not married yet, aren’t you? Before you get married, you have to enjoy the best in the world…”

Just like that, the two of them started kissing at the dining table.

Shelly wondered whether Nox had ever thought that he would fall into a ditch one day.

As expected, Nox, in the private room next door, had never thought of that. When he saw that the waitress who walked in had been replaced by another person, his expression was ugly.

Finn saw it all. He said, “If you’re unhappy, you can ask for it.”

Of course, Nox knew what Finn meant. However, he sneered and said stubbornly, “I’m very satisfied.”

Finn did not say anything else.

“Let’s drink.” Nox held up the glass of tequila. “I’ll get drunk with you tonight.”

Seeing that Finn did not refuse, the two of them started drinking, and they went hard on it. Finn’s alcohol tolerance was very average, so it did not take long for Nox to get him drunk. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Nox looked at Finn with disdain. “Your alcohol tolerance is so weak.”

Finn looked up at Nox before he stood up unsteadily and went straight to the washroom in the private room.

That was it? Was he throwing up already?

Nox felt even more bored because he had not even started yet! However, he had drunk quite a bit and felt like peeing.

After some thought, he walked out of the private room and went to the public washroom outside the restaurant.

He had just walked out when he saw Shelly walking out of the private room next door, and the two of them bumped into each other again.

Shelly could be very calm in front of Nox. However, when she thought about how his fiancée was getting intimate with another man in the private room, she wondered if she should tell him.

After all, he was being cheated on…

Just as Shelly was hesitating, Nox said with disgust, “What are you doing here?!”

Shelly realized she was indeed too kind to Nox.

She smiled. “I’m sorry I’m in your way.”

As she spoke, she turned her head sideways, looking very respectful.

Nox glanced at Shelly. Seeing the smile on her lips, his expression turned even uglier.

What was that woman laughing at? Was she too happy to see him?

He, on the other hand, did not think she was laughing at him but… mocking him. Despite that, Nox strode past Shelly, not wasting his breath on her.

Shelly turned to look at Nox’s back, and after a second, she went back to work calmly.

When Nox was in the toilet, his mind was filled with Shelly’s pensive smile. The more he thought about it, the creepier he felt it was. Why was that woman so persistent?

After using the washroom, he walked out and saw… Monica.

Although Monica was also surprised to see him, she was not too surprised. After all, South Hampton City was not a big city, and there were only so many high-end restaurants. It was not surprising for them to bump into each other occasionally during meals. “You’re here too?” On the contrary, Nox’s reaction was a little exaggerated.

“I have a business dinner to attend,” Monica replied.

She had told the other party to drink to their heart’s content, but her stomach had not been feeling well over the last few days.

The other party seemed to think she was just being polite and had been toasting her all night. After drinking two glasses, her stomach did not feel too good, so she found an excuse to come out for a breather and hide from the alcohol. She thought that when she went back later, she would say that she had something to do and end the dinner.

Unexpectedly, she bumped into Nox. “Are you done socializing?” Nox asked.

“What’s up?”

“I’m very annoyed.” Nox said, “Drink with me.”

“I haven’t been feeling well the last few days.”

“Cut the cr*p.” Nox did not have much patience, so he grabbed Monica’s arm. “Your body will feel better after drinking it.”

Monica was speechless. Anyway, nothing good ever happened every time she met Nox..
