1257 Standing Up For Shelly

He was the only one who could bully her! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Half an hour later, Nox’s phone rang, and he answered.

“Young Master Winter, I found him. It’s a boy named Benjamin Bacon. He’s Ms. Shelly’s deskmate, and they got into a fight in the classroom today.”

“What’s the reason?”

“It seems that Benjamin Bacon was mocking Ms. Shelly. Ms. Shelly couldn’t stand it anymore, so she started fighting him.”

Nox smiled.

He did not expect Shelly to be so hot-tempered. However, on second thought, Shelly did not seem to have a good temper either. She could only tolerate him.

“When can you bring him out?”

“He usually stays in school for self-study in the evening, and it’ll be about 9 p.m. when the self-study ends. I’ve already told someone to stop him at the school gate.”

“Alright, tell me when you catch him.”

“Yes.”

Nox hung up and then pushed his wheelchair out of the room, where Shelly was in the open kitchen, helping the servants prepare dinner.

Nox took another look at her.

Shelly felt Nox’s gaze and raised her head to look at him. Seeing his strange expression, she immediately looked away.

Nox could not be bothered to say anything to Shelly. Since he had nothing to do, he went to the living room and watched a variety show.

At 6 p.m., Shelly pushed Nox to the dining room.

In order to match the height of his wheelchair, the tables in the dining room were lowered so that Nox could eat in his wheelchair. It was usually Nox and Shelly who ate at the table, and the servants would sit separately.

Nox had strong tastebuds, so he liked to have something flavorful for every meal. With that, Shelly ate her tomato soup and bread in silence tonight.

However, even having bread soaked in the soup was a little difficult for her. After all, the wound on her mouth was not small. It would hurt even if it came into contact with water, let alone hot soup.

The maid seemed to have noticed Shelly’s discomfort, so she quickly cooled the soup down for her. “Sarah, eat this. It’s cooled down.”

“Thank you.” Shelly smiled.

Nox glanced at Shelly but did not say anything.

“I don’t know why your lips are always broken. It was the same last time, but this time, it looks bigger.” The servant could not help but sigh.

Shelly pursed her lips.

“Could it be some bugs?” The servant asked worriedly, “Could there be spiders, cockroaches, or mice in the house?!”

The more she spoke, the more excited she became.

At that moment, Shelly could not help but smile.

Originally, Nox did not think much of it, even if the servants were speculating. However, it was Shelly’s smile that made him feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Then, he heard Shelly say, “I wonder whether these animals are poisonous.”

Before the servant could answer, Nox suddenly exploded, “Shelly, who are you calling an animal?”

The servant was shocked at how Nox reacted.

Not only was she a little surprised, but she had always thought that the Young Master did not like Shelley. Yet now… Did it mean that it was the Young Master who bit Xiaoxiao’s lips…

That was when she seemed to have realized something, and the servant tactfully walked away.

“Shelly!” When Nox did not get a reply from Shelly, his expression turned unsightly.

Shelly replied calmly, “I didn’t say you’re an animal, so why are you so agitated?”

“You!”

“I’m full. You can take your time.” Shelly suddenly put down her utensils.

Shelly usually did not eat much because she was trying to lose weight to maintain her figure even though she was already very thin.

She stood up and was about to leave. However, she suddenly turned back to the angry Nox. “By the way, you should eat more vegetables. I heard that people who don’t eat vegetables tend to have bad breath.”

“Are you saying I have bad breath?” Nox was about to explode.

Shelly turned around and left.

Nox threw his chopsticks down angrily.

What an ungrateful Shelly!

…

At a certain time at night, after Shelly finished her revision, she walked out of her room to pour herself a glass of water when she saw Nox pushing himself out in his wheelchair.

She frowned and saw Nox being pushed away at the gate.

It was so late. Could it be…

Shelly was suddenly a little excited.

The moment the door was closed, she quickly followed.

She pressed the elevator button, left the estate, and hid at the side, where he watched as a black car drove away from the entrance of the garage.

After that, Shelly quickly hired a taxi.
