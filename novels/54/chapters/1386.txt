1387 Parent-Teacher Conference: You’re My Son!

Was it a relationship between friends? It should be. From the name, she could tell that his mother was unconventional.

She silently listened to the teacher recite the name of the top student in the class, repeating Elias Swan like a recorder.

In fact, Candice knew that the only person Edward loved was his first wife, Jeanne, and he only married Susan for political reasons.

Although Jeanne was his only true love, Candice was not jealous. After all, Jeanne had passed away. She even felt sorry for Edward and Jeanne’s relationship.

After the teacher announced the overall results of the class, he talked a lot about the school’s learning philosophy, learning plans, and many other things.

In the end, the teacher said, “Today, all the children have prepared a sentence for their parents. They have placed it in a pink or blue envelope inside the desk. Parents, please look for it.”

After saying that, all the parents were searching for the letter enthusiastically, including Candice. She searched for a while and found it.

In fact, she felt that with George’s personality, he might not have written something. After all, he had never thought that his father would attend the conference for him, let alone her.

Candice opened the letter nervously, and there was a note inside. It said, “Thank you, Teddy.”

Her eyes suddenly turned red, and a kind of sadness made her vision a little blurry.

George was only a ten-year-old child. However, he had to endure the loneliness that many children of his age did not need to.

She looked at George’s handwriting, which was really good, and thought for a moment. Then, she found George’s pen and wrote a sentence on the paper before putting the note back into the envelope and into George’s drawer.

When the parent-teacher conference ended, everyone left one after another. Candice, too, followed the crowd.

“Madam.” Suddenly, someone called her from behind.

Candice turned around. Seeing that it was George’s class teacher, she smiled in a friendly manner.

“Thank you very much for coming to our class’ parent-teacher conference.”

“You’re welcome. It’s what I should do.” Candice said bluntly, “Elias is our child, so of course, I have to attend.”

“Yes.” The teacher also quickly said, “Elias is doing well in school. Madam, you don’t have to worry too much.”

“Thank you, teacher.”

“Madam, take care.”

Candice nodded. She roughly knew why Edward never attended George’s parent-teacher conference. Being busy was one aspect, but his status was another.

When she attended the parent-teacher conference, she could already feel the teachers’ and parents’ wariness. If Edward really came, the entire school would probably be sealed off.

Sometimes, it was not that Edward did not want to attend but that he had no choice.

Candice walked out of the school gate and walked toward the car parked at the entrance. The chauffeur opened the car door for her.

By then, George was already waiting in the backseat of the car. When he saw her, he was obviously a little surprised. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He asked, “Where’s Teddy?”

“He’s at home.”

“Were you here for the parent-teacher conference?” George looked at her.

Candice was already sitting beside George, and the chauffeur had driven away from the school.

“Yes.” Candice nodded.

“I didn’t tell you to attend,” George said bluntly.

It was clear that he was still rejecting her.

“I know.” Candice said, “But your dad has something on, and it’s not convenient for him to come and attend it, so I have to do it.”

“I didn’t expect him to attend, but I didn’t expect you to come either. In the future, Teddy can attend it for me.” His tone was a little cold.

“You’re my son. Isn’t it natural for me to attend?” Candice was inexplicably angry.

It was just that George’s rejection of her was too obvious. Understanding that he rejected her was one thing, but her feelings about it were another.

“I’m not your son,” George said bluntly.

Candice almost choked.

“Don’t do anything unnecessary in the future,” George said coldly.

He looked cold and distant, which resembled the way Edward treated others outside.

She said, “George, whether you admit it or not, we will be a family in the future. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like it or if you don’t accept it, but I’m your mother. Even if I’m not your biological mother, I’m your stepmother. There’s no way to change that fact unless your father divorces me. Before the divorce, apart from your father, I’m your guardian, and you have no choice.”
