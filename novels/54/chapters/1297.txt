1298 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

She frowned and looked at the caller ID. When she saw the words “Sc*mbag Swan”, she was shocked.

She was the one who changed the name of the Sc*mbag Swan today.

She was furious, so this was the only place she could vent her anger.

But now, she suddenly got a call from him.

No matter how she looked at it, she felt that there was something fishy going on.

However, since she was such a lackey, she still had to answer the call.

“Chief.” She was clearly trying to curry favor with him.

D*mmit.

As expected, she had really become the person she hated the most when she was young.

“Make time tomorrow. I have something to ask you,” the person on the other end said bluntly.

“Are you looking for me or Finn?”

“You.”

“Only me?”

“Yeah.”

“Oh, okay.” Monica agreed and asked, “What time?”

“Nine o’clock in the morning.”

This meant she was not going to work.

“Okay.”

“I’ll get someone to pick you up at nine,” Edward said.

“Okay.”

“It’s late. Good night.”

Good night my *ss.

“Good night.” Monica smiled.

Edward hung up before Monica put down her phone.

D*mmit.

Right then, the bedroom door was suddenly pushed open.

Finn was back. He seemed to be a little tired, but it also seemed to be an illusion.

In fact, most of the time, Monica could not understand Finn’s emotions. She could not even read his expression.

“Are you still awake?” Finn asked.

“Yes, I just received a call from Edward,” Monica said bluntly.

“Fourth Master is looking for you?” Finn seemed a little surprised as well. “What’s the matter?”

“He asked me to make time to see him tomorrow. He didn’t say more.”

Neither did Finn when he answered, “Okay.”

Sometimes, Monica had no idea what kind of relationship she had with Finn.

Friends with benefits?

She watched as Finn walked into the bathroom.

Monica also lay on the bed and tried to sleep.

A while later, Finn came out of the bathroom. He threw back the covers and got into bed.

The two of them slept together every night. There was basically not much talking, except… some regular workouts.

Although she knew that it was already a little late, she still could not fall asleep.

She was not sure if it was Finn’s words in the morning that had been bothering her until now, or if it was because Edward had called her in the middle of the night, but she suddenly felt that she was not sleepy at all.

She asked in the dark, “Finn, are you asleep?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If he was still awake, she wanted to talk to him about the baby.

However, just as she finished speaking, she felt Finn’s body getting closer to her.

After having known each other for a long time, she knew exactly what the other person wanted with just a small gesture.

Monica tensed up.

Fine.

They could satisfy each other’s physical needs first before talking about the child.

So, she gave in to Finn. Habits could sometimes be scary.

There was nothing much to feel about it. It was just very ordinary sex, which seemed to have become a necessity in life.

“Give me a minute,” Finn suddenly said in the dark while the two of them were on top of each other.

Monica frowned.

Finn returned to her side after a while.

She saw what Finn brought with him and she stopped for a moment.

...

So… was it just a casual remark of him wanting a child this morning?

The night was getting darker and colder.

…

The next day, Monica’s biological alarm clock woke her up early in the morning.

In the past, her daily routine was the other way round; she could not wake up in the morning no matter how hard she slept. Now, he woke up at first light. Sometimes, even if she was very sleepy, she had to get up because there was a lot of work to do.

She left the bed, washed up, and changed her clothes.

She was going to meet that Sc*mbag Swan today. What should she wear?

In any case, it did not really matter so she decided on what to wear easily.

She walked out dressed very casually with a bun on her head.

In the blink of an eye, she felt like she had returned to her twenties.

She walked out of the room.

...

He saw that Finn was making breakfast again.

Now that he saw her come out with that outfit, his gaze seemed to pause on her.

It had probably been a long time since he last saw her in this outfit.

For a long time, she had been wearing a suit and dress, seldom so casual.

“Don’t you need to go to work?” Finn asked.

“Edward said that he wants to see me today. I don’t know how long he’s going to see me for, so I’ll wear whatever I want first. If it’s done early, I’ll come back and change,” Monica explained.
