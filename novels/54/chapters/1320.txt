1321 Finn Is Jealous

At first, Finn was a little depressed, but he felt much better now.

That was right. For so many years, since he was young, he had endured everything himself. Anyway, given some time, he would be able to recover to his best state.

He felt much better after taking his time with two cigarettes.

“You called me at this hour. It can’t be nothing. Hurry up, if you have something to say, say it. Don’t dawdle.” Nox obviously would let Finn go.

Finn had no idea where to start.

Nox said firmly on the other end of the line, “Did you quarrel with Monica?”

Finn agreed tacitly.

“I knew it. Other than Monica, no one can keep you awake in the middle of the night. Tell me, what happened between the two of you? Did you suddenly feel that there’s something wrong with your relationship with Monica? Did you suddenly feel that Monica doesn’t seem to love you that much anymore?!”

“Maybe.” Finn was not denying it anymore. “I think you’re right. Monica and I don’t seem to be a normal couple. Other than sleeping together, we rarely interact with each other. We hardly do anything intimate either.”

“And you still think that the two of you have a good relationship?! Let me tell you, Finn, people who have a good relationship can’t wait to stick together. Even if they can’t stick together forever because of work, as long as they have time, the two of them will definitely be intimate. And now you’re saying you’re only intimate with Monica in bed, let me tell you—sleeping with her isn’t an expression of your feelings. You’re just satisfying the normal physical needs of humans. In today’s society, there are too many men and women like this. Once they lose interest in each other’s bodies, they will leave immediately!”

Listening to Nox’s words, Finn’s emotions were clearly fluctuating.

“Of course, you and Monica are different. After all, you’ve been together for so many years. You’ve been on and off, and you’ve quarreled with each other. In the end, you chose to be together. In addition, Monica was willing to give up her life for you. This is enough to prove that Monica definitely has feelings for you. Since there’s a foundation established for your relationship, it’s very easy for you to salvage this relationship,” Nox said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He was used to Finn not saying much. In any case, all these were enough for him to express his views clearly.

As for whether Finn wanted to listen or not, it was his business.

Nox continued, “The biggest problem between you and Monica is the lack of communication. Do you know that? If you don’t say anything, Monica will never know what you’re thinking. She might not even know that you still love her very much. She might think that you’re with her to repay her for saving you with her life back then. Think about it, Monica was originally such a cheerful person. Even if she has experienced a lot of things to make herself mature and steady, her personality will not change. Moreover, all changes in a person are external. She won’t disguise herself like this to her own people. Once she puts on a mask with anyone, that means she’s not treating that person as one of her own.”

Finn simply listened. It turned out that even Nox could see through it, but he could not.

“Finn, if you want to be with Monica, I advise you to try to change and be more proactive. If you don’t say it, no one will know what you’re thinking. If you express yourself, Monica will never know how much you like her. A woman, who has really been hurt, can’t open her heart to anyone so easily. The more you don’t do anything, the more she will protect herself. Her calm attitude towards you now is obvious that she doesn’t want to share too much with you. Perhaps, she still has the impression that the two of you can break up at any time. Do you think Monica has such thoughts? Can the relationship between the two of you improve?” Nox questioned.

At that moment, Finn was utterly speechless.

Nox was such a tough man, but on some days, he would become a relationship expert.

F*ck. Finn cursed at himself.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore.” Nox seemed to be unable to accept that Finn was being so wishy-washy. “Anyway, I’ve already made myself clear to you. What you do next is your business. That’s all the advice I can give you.”

“Mm,” Finn replied.

“Don’t just give me that one-word reply. If you have something to say, you have to say it. Do you know how anxious you make people feel like that?!” Nox was obviously a little agitated. “Let me remind you again. If you have something to say, you have to say it out loud. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance to say it in the future. You’ll regret it for the rest of your life!”
