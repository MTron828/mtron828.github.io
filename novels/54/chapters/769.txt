Chapter 770: Jenifer Playing Tricks, An Exciting Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What nonsense are you spouting?”

“What nonsense were you talking about just now?” Jeanne had an imposing aura.

“I’m just telling the truth!”

“It’s just a video. Is it enough to prove that what you said is the truth?” Jeanne’s eyes hardened.

Frightened by Jeanne’s gaze, Jeanne did not know what to say.

At that moment, Jeanne did not give Jenifer a chance to speak as she said bluntly, “In the video that Jenifer just released, I was indeed the one who told Finn and Miles to rescue Quinn. I was the first to find out because I was well aware of Joshua’s enmity toward me. In other words, I was also afraid that I would one day follow in my mother’s footsteps, so I sent someone to keep an eye on Joshua in secret. I was afraid he would do something harmful to me. ”

“The best way to protect yourself is to take precautions. Although I didn’t find out that Joshua wanted to harm me, I found out that Joshua had ulterior motives toward Quinn. Why would Joshua do such a thing to Quinn, you may ask? Think about it. If Joshua plays up to the Sanders, wouldn’t it be easy for him to kick me out of Lawrence Enterprise?”

Jeanne’s words confused the reporters at the scene.

However, those people… Most of them were probably ordered by someone to be here.

Hence, a reporter disagreed with her point of view. “According to my understanding of Joshua, he doesn’t have such courage. In other words, he isn’t that bold. If someone didn’t instruct him to do so, he wouldn’t have done it. ”

“You’re right. Someone did instruct him to do it.” Jeanne enunciated her every word.

The reporter was stunned, wondering if he had said something wrong.

“If Joshua wouldn’t dare to do this to the young lady of the Sanders but did, there must be someone behind this.” Jeanne was certain.

“Isn’t that person you? How dare you try to put the blame on someone else?” Jenifer said agitatedly. ” Joshua told me everything last night. You were the one who made him do it. You were the one who told him to leave everything to you. That was why Joshua did it, and now you want to push the blame onto someone else? Jeanne, stop denying it”

“Why are you so agitated? Are you afraid that I’ll reveal who’s behind this?” Jeanne asked coldly.

“There’s no such person!” Jenifer was still very agitated. She said, “You’re just making things up to confuse us.”

“Eden,” Jeanne suddenly said.

She said the person’s name.

“What nonsense are you spouting?”

“I said, the person who instigated Joshua was Eden!”

“First, you frame my son, and now you frame my son-in-law? Are you trying to destroy our family? Jeanne, how can you be so evil? How can you be so vicious? How can you…” Jenifer looked like she was about to faint from anger.

“Ms. Lawrence, may I remind you that this is broadcasted live on the internet. The more you deny it, the more you’ll be humiliated. You’d better think twice before you act.” The reporter reminded Jeanne kindly.

It was great that it was broadcasted live on the internet. In fact, what she was afraid of was that the live broadcast would suddenly be cut off.

Therefore, she told Mason to sneak into the crowd of reporters quietly and then install live broadcast software.

Once she made sure that Mason had taken care of everything, she took her time to say, “Jenifer just said she’s been good to me since I was young, right? ”

“Don’t I treat you well?”

“Whether you treat me well or not, someone will expose you,”

“I’m not afraid of you!” Jenifer purposely made herself look strong. “No matter who in the Lawrences, including the Lawrences’ servants, they all know how well I treat you!”

Did that mean she had bribed the servants in advance?

However, Jeanne did not get a servant. She got Jasmine.

She had given Jenifer so much time to perform just now not to humiliate Jenifer even more later but to give herself enough time to arrange many things.

She arranged everything one by one, and after making sure everything was fine, she walked into the press conference.

At that moment, she turned to look at the door.

“Open the door, Amy,” Jeanne instructed.

Amy was shocked. However, she had a feeling that a good show was about to begin.

She quickly opened the door of the meeting room, and a woman walked in from the door.

The moment Jenifer saw Jasmine, she was shocked.

She thought of how Jeanne could look for anyone to complain about her past attitude toward Jeanne, but she had never thought that Jeanne would look for Jasmine.

She could not help but feel afraid. She knew very well that Jasmine had not been doing well recently, but because she wanted to use Eden, she could only turn a blind eye to what Jasmine was going through.

However, Jasmine would not disown her as her mother.

Jenifer had taught Jasmine so many things over the years, so it was impossible for the latter to turn her back on her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was a joke that Jeanne wanted to use Jasmine.

Jenifer kept consoling herself when she saw Jasmine walk in while looking at her deep in the eyes.

Jenifer also gave Jasmine a look, indicating for her to not speak nonsense.

Jasmine had always understood what she meant and was very obedient.

Although Jenifer was a little nervous, she believed Jeanne was wrong.

Then, she saw Jasmine turning to face everyone at the scene and saying, “My mother, Jenifer, has never treated Jeanne nicely. She even tried to frame her in every way possible!”
