1202 Nox’s Deliberate Torture

When Shelley walked into Nox’s room with the pizza, she saw a woman in the room, a charming woman.

The woman was sitting by Nox’s bed, gently peeling fruits for him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

When she saw Shelley, she blurted out, “Young Master Winter, I think your servant is here?”

Nox suddenly laughed and said, “Yes.”

“Why are you so late?” The woman frowned and looked at Shelley. “Is that Young Master Winter’s dinner? It’s already past 7 p.m. Are you trying to starve your young master?”

Ignoring the woman, Shelley placed the pizza she had made on the table in the ward and took it out. Then, she walked in front of Nox. “You can eat now.”

“I’ve eaten,” Nox spoke bluntly.

Shelley glanced at him.

“You’ve been making this since noon. If I haven’t found something to eat, are you really trying to starve me to death?”

Shelley took away the pizza. “It’s fine if you’ve eaten.”

Then, she put it back in the box.

“Young Master Winter, your servant has a bad temper. She missed your meal time, and now she’s throwing a tantrum because you don’t want the food she sent,” the woman said sarcastically.

“I didn’t lose my temper,” Shelley said to the woman, enunciating each word clearly.

“You didn’t lose your temper? Look at how you’re glaring at me.” The woman looked aggrieved. “Although my line of work isn’t respectable, it’s still a job. What right does she have to be so mean to me? Besides, Young Master Winter told me to come. I’m also Young Master Winter’s friend. As a servant, how could you be so rude?”

Shelley just watched that woman’s performance coldly.

“Look, she’s still glaring at me!” the woman said with an exaggerated expression on her face.

It rendered Shelley speechless.

Hence, she picked up the pot and was about to leave when Nox suddenly stopped her. “Shelley!”

Shelley stopped in her tracks and turned around.

“Who said you could go?”

“Wasn’t I disturbing you?”

“When did you become so tactful?” Nox mocked.

“Don’t I have to be a little tactful to please you?”

“Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking! You can’t wait for me to have some kind of relationship with another woman so that you can tell my grandfather and get me to marry you!”

“Since you knew, why did you invite a woman over?”

“To piss you off!”

“I’ve seen you in bed with a woman. What’s there to be pissed off about?” Shelley said in a flat tone.

“F*ck!” Nox cursed.

Was Shelley a saint? Nothing could piss her off! He had taken things so far, yet Shelley was still so indifferent to him.

That woman must be crazy!

He was so angry that his head hurt.

When the charming woman heard their conversation, she felt that something was wrong. It turned out… the couple was quarreling, and what did she call the girl just now? A servant?

Feeling like she had said something wrong, she quickly put down the fruit knife in her hand. “Young Master Winter, I have something to do after this. I’ll take my leave first.”

“Where are you going–”

By then, the woman had run away as she was afraid of being implicated.

Shelley watched as the woman fled before she turned back to look at the furious Nox.

Nox looked back at Shelley. “What are you looking at?”

Shelley looked away and returned to the ward. However, she ignored Nox.

Nox was so angry that he naturally ignored Shelley. Ideas about how he could chase that woman away were spinning in his mind.

In the quiet ward, Shelley took her school bag, took out her homework book, and started to do her homework.

When Nox turned around, he saw Shelley with her head on the dining table in the ward, doing her homework seriously.

At that moment, he seemed to recall something. Shelley was only 18 years old, and she was still in her senior year of high school.

‘F*ck.’ He was so angry that his lungs were about to explode because of a young female student.

Shelley did not know what was on Nox’s mind.

It was winter break now, and after the winter break, the college entrance examination would be in the second half of the year.

She also wanted to get into a good university. At least, if Nox didn’t marry her in the end, she would still have a good future!

“I want water.”

Nox’s voice suddenly rang out in the ward.

Shelley was currently solving a math problem and was at the key point.

“Shelley, I want water!” Nox’s voice grew louder.

Shelley refused to hear anything at that moment. With a pen in hand, she continued solving problems on the draft paper.

“Shelley!”

“I heard you!” Shelley was a little angry, and she shouted to Nox, “I’m not deaf!”

“If you’re not deaf, why aren’t you making a sound?” Nox’s voice was even louder.

...

He could not believe Shelley was throwing a tantrum at him. Was she going to go berserk?

Shelley was really angry. She suddenly put down her pen and slammed it on the table. Then, she got up and walked over to Nox. She poured him a glass of water and handed it to him.

Nox looked at Shelley’s expression and took it.

Right after he took a sip, he spat it all out. “Pfft!”

“Shelley, are you trying to burn me?!” Nox’s mouth was in so much pain.

“How old are you? Don’t you know how to test the temperature yourself?”

“Shelley!” Nox was so angry that he wanted to jump to his feet.

Unfortunately, he could not.

Shelley held it in. She took the glass of water from Nox’s hand and began to cool the water for him.

When it was cooled, she handed it to him. “Drink it.”

Nox glanced at Shelley before he slowly took a sip.

...

Shelley did not stay by Nox’s side. She returned to her desk and continued to do her homework.

“Shelley.”

Shelley gritted her teeth.

“I want some fruits.”

Shelley did as she was told.

“Shelley, turn on the TV.”

“Shelley, change the channel.”

“Shelley, I need to pee...”
