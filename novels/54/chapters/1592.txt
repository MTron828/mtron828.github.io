Chapter 1593: Forever

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A man like him probably could not live without sleeping with someone for a day!

Thinking back to the year when he was banned from sleeping with women, he also made a lot of trouble. However, in the end, he cracked under pressure and succumbed to his desires. He could even sleep with her in his arms, not to mention other women. Hence, Zoe really did not have to worry about anything. Shelly then put down her phone and fell asleep happily. With Bella’s fever subsiding and her having money now, she was beyond happy.

Zoe waited for a while after sending the message, but Shelly did not reply to her.

She realized Shelly, that woman, was really tolerant. If it were anyone else, they would at least respond. Yet, Shelly did not ask about the money or her relationship with Nox at all.

Zoe gritted her teeth. Could it be that Shelly really had no feelings for Nox and the Winters? Was her worry unnecessary? However, she still felt that she could not let her guard down. What if Shelly suddenly went crazy?

She refused to believe that Shelly would remain unmoved by Nox and his wealth. With that, she could not help but shake Nox, who was already asleep beside her.

Nox frowned as he opened his eyes. “Why aren’t you asleep yet?”

“I can’t sleep. I get so excited at the thought of us getting married that I can’t sleep.”

“So do you plan to stay up for the next ten days?” Nox teased.

Then, he hugged Zoe tightly and said dotingly, “Be good and get some sleep. Staying up late won’t be good for your skin. You have to look beautiful on your wedding day.”

“Annoying,” Zoe said coquettishly.

The two of them teased each other under the covers. Just when Zoe thought Nox would do something with her again, Nox just hugged her in his arms and told her to sleep early.

Recently, Nox seemed to have been… much worse at performing in bed. Was it an illusion? Or was Nox really getting old? However, a 30 -year-old man was not considered old.

“Nox.” Zoe did not force to have sex with Nox. Instead, she lay quietly in Nox’s arms and said, “I have something to say. Don’t be angry.”

‘What is it?” Nox asked. “I’ll tell you if you say you won’t get angry.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright, I won’t get angry.”

“I just transferred 200 thousand dollars to Shelly,” Zoe said.

As soon as she said it, Nox’s expression darkened, and he looked straight at Zoe.

Zoe was also stunned by Nox’s sudden appearance because Nox had never lost his temper with her. However, at that moment, he was visibly angry.

“You said you wouldn’t get angry, but your expression looks scary.” Zoe looked extremely aggrieved.

Nox was silent for a while before saying, “Why did you give her money?

“I saw that her life wasn’t easy, so I thought of giving her some money to make her life better. It was mainly because I noticed that your mother couldn’t let go of Shelly. Their relationship is so tense now, so I thought I should be a good person and give Shelly some money to make up for what your mother owes Shelly,” Zoe explained.

“In the future, you don’t have to worry about Shelly and my family.” “Do you think what I did was unnecessary?” Zoe asked him.

“No, it’s just that Shelly doesn’t need you to care for her,” Nox said coldly.

His disgust toward Shelly was obvious.

“Actually, that’s not entirely the reason. Also, didn’t I bump into Shelly tonight? She said a lot of things to threaten me. She even said that you slept with him and that she would tell others… I’ve already let go of the accident between the two of you, but if she really tells others, it’ll affect your reputation. Shelly said that she wouldn’t say anything if I gave her money, so I agreed to give her 200 thousand dollars to keep her mouth shut.”

Nox’s expression turned ugly.

“Don’t be angry.” Zoe looked at Nox. “It scares me when you’re angry. After all, she has been in your family for so many years. Since you can’t marry her, I thought giving her a sum of money would buy her peace of mind.”

“Do you think I haven’t given her money?” Nox asked.

Zoe was stunned.

“Forget it.” Nox did not seem to want to say anything more. “Anyway, don’t bother with Shelly anymore. She has chosen her own path, and you don’t have to pity her.”

“Yes, I won’t do it again in the future. This time, I just wanted to make it up to

Shelly. After making it up to her, I can marry you with a clear conscience..”
