Chapter 202: Fiercely Defend to Turn the Tables

In fact, Eden did not know who Jeanne had hired to defend her. Anyway, he had asked and even secretly asked those more famous lawyers. No one would take up Jeanne’s lawsuit. At this moment, Eden treated Judah lightly as he had never seen or heard of him before.

As for how exactly Judah was…

In any case, anyone under Kingsley could not be bad.

At this moment, Judah said unhurriedly, “Your Honor, I’ll plead for my client’s innocence.”

The moment he said that, everyone in the courtroom was in an uproar.

Eden’s face instantly turned cold.

‘Where did Jeanne get the courage to plead for “innocence”?

‘Is she really that shameless?! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

‘Isn’t she afraid of how she would be insulted once the lawsuit is over?!’

“Jeanne is still so ungrateful.” When Jasmine heard Judah’s words, she could not help but sneer.

There was noise at the scene.

“Silence!” The judge was serious.

Only then did the scene quieten down.

Those mocking voices gradually disappeared.

“Please continue, attorney for the plaintiff.”

“Understood,” Judah said respectfully.

He spoke to the judge, “Your Honor, just now, the witness, Mr. Zimmer, kept saying that the matter of the dual contract of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse was related to my client, but from the beginning to the end, he only came into contact with the contractor, Tenda. Through Tenda’s one-sided words, he concluded that this case was instigated by my client. Throughout the entire process, he never mentioned that he had any interactions with my client. He didn’t even mention what my client’s motive was!”

“Isn’t the motive obvious? Of course, it’s for profit,” Adrian suddenly spoke, very agitated.

Judah glanced at Adrian. “Mr. Zimmer, before you’re asked to speak, don’t speak.”

“Please control your emotions, witness. Before you’re asking to speak in court, don’t interrupt,” the judge ordered.

“Okay.”

Judah continued, “If the so-called signed contract without handprint and the so-called records can prove my client’s guilt, Harken’s law is too child’s play then. I think that my client was deliberately framed!”

“Attorney for the plaintiff, please watch your words.” The judge was very serious.

“Yes, Your Honor.” Judah appeared much more respectful. “May I ask the witness a few questions?”

“Permission granted.”

“Mr. Zimmer,” Judah said straightforwardly.

Adrian looked at him.

“How long have you been at the Lawrence Enterprise?”

“15 years of service.”

“So you’re considered a senior employee at the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“It’s precisely because of my feelings for the Lawrence Enterprise that I sued Jeanne for the sake of justice.”

“You kept saying that you’re very righteous. What does justice mean to you?”

“Objection.” Josiah stood up. “Your Honor, I strongly protest against the plaintiff’s attorney asking questions that are useless to the case. In fact, his words even contained sarcasm toward the witness, seriously affecting the emotions of the witness.”

“Objection sustained. Plaintiff’s lawyer, please watch your words again.”

Judah nodded.

It was worth noting that the prosecution’s side had the dominant position in this case.

Judah continued, “Just now, you said that you’ve been at the Lawrence Enterprise for 15 years, Mr. Zimmer. Have you been doing their construction work for the past 15 years?”

“Yes.”

“According to your profession, you should be very familiar with the construction companies of all scales in South Hampton City?”

“Yes, I’m very familiar with them,” Adrian answered.

“It means that you should be very familiar with Tenda,” Judah said straightforwardly.

Adrian was stunned.

At that moment, he panicked for a second.

The next second, he quickly said, “I do have some dealings with him, but I knew he would do such a thing. If I knew, I would definitely advise the company not to choose Tenda...”

“I just need to clarify whether you and Tenda are very close.”

Adrian hesitated for a moment.

He gritted his teeth and said, “We’re very close.”

“Okay. I understand.” Judah nodded and said respectfully to the judge, “Your Honor, may I ask the defendant, Tenda, some questions?”

“Permission granted.”

Judah turned to face Tenda.

Tenda was also a little nervous.

Judah said, “Mr. Wadler, just now, Adrian said that you’re very close. Is that right?”

“Yes, we know each other because we often collaborate in construction.”

“You often collaborate? How many times have you worked with Adrian?”

Tenda thought for a moment before he answered, “Three or four times.”
