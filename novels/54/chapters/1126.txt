1127 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

Mason looked at Jeanne and at how stubborn she was.

If even Kingsley could not control Jeanne, he was even more helpless. Hence, he accompanied Jeanne and dug a grave for Kingsley.

The hole was not very deep but could at least bury Kingsley and give him a safe place to rest in peace.

After they dug a grave for Kingsley, they dug another one for Lucy.

Then, they buried Kingsley and Lucy together.

She did not know if Lucy would be willing to die and still be with Kingsley, but she was selfish. She selfishly hoped that Lucy could accompany her uncle.

She had a feeling that the moment Kingsley died, he might have had some regrets about Lucy.

If there was a so-called hell or an afterlife, she hoped that Kingsley could face his feelings bravely and make up for his regrets in this life.

After digging, Jeanne’s and Mason’s hands were already scratched beyond recognition.

At that time, the sky had turned dark.

Jeanne finally stood up from the ground and said to the grave, “Uncle, I’m sorry for not being obedient. I’ll avenge you. I don’t agree with the survival of the fittest. I’ll kill everyone who deserves to be killed!”

Mason looked at Jeanne from the side and saw the killing intent in her eyes, which she did not hide.

She turned around with her back facing Kingsley and Lucy. “Wait for me. I’ll take you back to the Delta Islands.”

One day, she would bring them back to the Delta Islands.

She then strode away, and Mason followed behind her.

There were a few cars in the distance. Kingsley had driven them here when he came to pick her up.

Once they got in, Mason started the car and asked her, “Where are we going?”

“To the Sanders.”

Mason turned to look at her.

“Warren will need me.”

Mason nodded.

Since Kingsley was dead, Jeanne would be the most powerful person in the Hills from now.

Hence, he would do whatever Jeanne said, and no one was allowed to disobey her orders.…

In the Swans’ courtyard, Edward and Nox knelt in front of Zachary.

However, they were not whipped according to the family rules.

Zachary said, “The reason why you’re not being punished after making such a big mistake is that the Duncans need you now! I don’t want to delay the Duncans’ great cause.”

Edward did not react. He just listened to his father’s scolding.

“I don’t want to see you go soft-hearted on anyone else. If there really is such a person, I will kill her for you so that you will never have any more worries.” Zachary threatened Edward.

He was obviously talking about Jeanne.

Edward, who was initially unmoved, immediately reacted.

He said to his father loud and clear, “If anyone dares to touch Jeanne, I’ll bury the entire Swans with them. I mean what I say!”

“How dare you!” Zachary slammed his hand on the coffee table beside him.

There was a loud sound.

Nox was shocked.

Nox clutched her injured little heart.

When the immortals fight, the people suffer!

“Do you know what nonsense you’re talking about? Do you know how rebellious it is of you to give up the great cause of a country for a woman? All these years, have all the training I’ve given you been in vain?”

“You didn’t train me in any way. You just gave birth to me and gave me to the Duncans. When have you ever cared about how the Duncans raised me? And if I don’t meet the requirements of the Duncans, you will come to me with a whip!” Edward looked straight at Zachary.

That was probably the first time in her life that he had talked back to her father.

Wade, who was standing at the side, was also surprised.

Edward had never spoken to Old Master Swan like that before.

“You won’t even acknowledge me because of Jeanne?!” Zachary’s expression changed. “I shouldn’t have agreed to your wedding with her!”

“Do you think you could’ve stopped me?” Edward said coldly.

Zachary’s expression was extremely ugly. He probably did not expect Edward to have such a huge reaction today.

He glared at his son and was about to speak when Edward immediately said, “My life is yours, but my feelings are not! I have my emotions too. I can die for you, but you can’t control my thoughts. I’m a human, not a machine!”

“Edward!” Zachary was so angry that he stood up from his chair. “Are you trying to rebel?!”
