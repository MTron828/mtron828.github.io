Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Sometimes, she envied Sarah’s cheerful and optimistic personality. Although Sarah had been deeply hurt by Finn, she could give up on him just like she said so and did not take it seriously at all.

“Shelly.” A boy approached Shelly.

Shelly looked away.

“I notice you’ve been pretty quiet the whole night. We all used to be classmates, so relax and don’t worry,” the boy said.

“No, I just know how to have fun. You don’t have to worry about me.”

“I used to think you were quite cold when we were in school, but you’re still as unapproachable as ever, ” the boy said with a smile.

Shelly did not know how to answer that statement.

“How about this? I’ll toast you.” The boys did not press on about the matter.

Shelly took a glass of wine and started drinking with the boy. The two of them drank one glass after another, and Shelly was too embarrassed to refuse.

When they felt like they were going to get drunk, Benjamin suddenly appeared and said to the boy, “If you can hold your alcohol so well, why don’t I drink with you?”

Shelly looked at Benjamin, feeling grateful.

The boy laughed. “Yo, are you trying to be a hero saving the damsel in distress?” “It’S nothing. Seeing that you’re in such a good mood, I’d like to join too. Can’t I?”

“Why not? Shelly seems pretty closed off, so let’s drink more and loosen her a little,” the boy suggested.

“Alright.”

Benjamin agreed immediately, but he started drinking with the boy. In fact, Benjamin’s alcohol tolerance was not great. Toward the end, Shelly thought he was going to throw up, so she quickly picked up the glass and drank with the boy.

The boy smiled. “Oh, look. You’re finally taking the initiative.”

Then, he started drinking with Shelly, and the atmosphere was lively. Shelly could barely blend in. Other than that guy, there were also other guys and girls who came over to drink with Shelly.

By the end, Shelly was a little drunk. She hurriedly went to the bathroom to hide from the drinking. If she continued drinking, she would definitely make a fool of herself, so she went to the bathroom to sober up for a while.

When she came out, she saw Benjamin standing at the door. As soon as she opened the door, he rushed in. As he probably could not hold it in anymore, she leaned over the toilet bowl and threw up quite a bit.

Shelly stopped in her tracks and walked toward Benjamin. Seeing him throw up, her whole body tensed up. She quickly stroked his back for quite a while, and only then did Benjamin feel better. He flushed the toilet before cleaning his mouth and cheeks. He said, “Thank you, Shelly. I’m fine now.”

“Don’t drink so much.”

“There’s no other way. I can’t hide from those b*stards.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In fact, if he did not step in to drink for her just now, he would not have been so drunk.

“It’S fine now. Let’s go out,” Benjamin said.

“Yeah.”

With that, the two of them walked out of the bathroom. As soon as they walked out, they bumped into Sarah walking toward the washroom in a drunken state and seeing the two of them come out together.

Sarah’s dazed eyes suddenly became clear. She pointed at the two of them and stammered, “Y-You…

Please don’t tell me you’ve rekindled your old flame?”

“What nonsense are you spouting!” Shelly grabbed Sarah and walked into the washroom.

Benjamin turned his head and looked at the door that was closed again with a bitter smile. How nice would it be if he could rekindle an old flame?

Shelly dragged Sarah into the bathroom. “Don’t misunderstand. There’s nothing between Benjamin and I.”

“If it’s nothing, why did the two of you come out of the same bathroom?”

“He threw up, so I took care of him.”

“Why did you take care of him and not the other drunk boys?” “I’m not familiar with them.” Shelly was speechless.

“So you’re familiar with Benjamin?

“Don’t you know that between us…” “I do. That was why I asked whether you were rekindling an old flame.”

“I’m not, I swear,” Shelly explained.

“Why are you getting so worked up if you’re not?” Sarah smiled. “With my years of research on relationships, even if you don’t have it on your mind, deep down, you’ve started to have such thoughts.”

“1…”

“Don’t deny it. I’m a good judge of character.” Sarah stared at Shelly and said, “Aren’t you going to break up with Nox soon? I think Benjamin will do.” “You’re overthinking it. We can’t be together. Benjamin’s parents won’t agree.”

“So if his parents agree, you can date Benjamin again?”

“It won’t happen.”

“Shelly, I think you should fight for your own happiness. Nox is such a sc*mbag. Don’t waste the rest of your life on him, okay?” Sarah said seriously.

From her understanding of Nox, Nox was a scumbag. Not only did he hurt Shelly, but he also had a terrible reputation.

There was a period of time when he was fooling around a lot in the nightclubs at night and heard that many women in the entertainment industry had an improper relationship with Nox. In fact, in the eyes of those women, they would be embarrassed not to get involved with Nox.

At that time, she had an unshakable feeling that Nox was filthy and that Shelly had laid waste to him. However, what else could she say now? She had to persuade Shelly to leave Nox. A good woman like Shelly should find a gentleman like Benjamin and be doted on for the rest of her life..
