Chapter 1664: Utterly Despicable

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He had spent so much money and done so much, and instead of them breaking up, he had even made their lives better. Did he not suffer a double loss?

“I didn’t expect Shelly to be so rational.” The other party also felt a little guilty.

According to ordinary people’s thinking, most people would choose to break up if pressured by their parents. However, who knew that Shelly would be so smart in dealing with that matter? She did not act on impulse at all.

“So tell me, what should we do now?” Nox gritted his teeth.

How could he give money to his love rival to further his studies? He was not that great of a person!

“I think we can create a conflict before Benjamin leaves,” the other side quickly said.

“What do you mean?” Nox asked fiercely.

“That is, before Benjamin leaves, we’ll cause a rift in their relationship. Once there is a rift in their relationship and Benjamin is in a hurry to leave, their relationship will suffer. Then, once they’re separated, they will naturally break up.”

“Just tell me what to do!” Nox was so angry that he was about to explode.

“Get Benjamin to misunderstand that you and Shelly are still together.” The other party mustered up his courage and said loudly.

“Are you stupid? Do you think Benjamin doesn’t know how much Shelly hates me? Are you crazy to make him misunderstand that Shelly and I are together?”

“When a man and a woman are in a relationship, they will care more about each other. And especially since Shelly and Benjamin are in their honeymoon phase, there is definitely no room for someone else to come between the two of them. So, when Benjamin is about to leave, you will go crazy to pursue Shelly and use all kinds of big moves to make Benjamin feel threatened. No matter how hard Shelly rejects you, Benjamin will definitely feel insecure and might make the decision not to go abroad again. After all, if Benjamin’s first reaction when he received this opportunity was to reject it because of Shelly, it’s very likely that he will reject it for Shelly a second time. Once he refuses to leave, Shelly will definitely get anxious. Coupled with the pressure from Benjamin’s parents, Shelly will have to break up with him to make him leave!” The other party explained it clearly.

Nox also understood the situation, but he could not help but ask, “If that’s the case, will Shelly hate me? Will she think I’m despicable?” “Um… Has Shelly ever liked you?” the other party asked.

‘F*ck!’ Nox secretly cursed.

“Don’t you think you’ve been very despicable in your ways of pursuing Shelly?” the other party asked again.

“Believe it or not, I’ll fire you!” Nox was exasperated. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Believe it or not, I’ll fire you!” Nox was exasperated.

“All I’m saying is that love is innocent. Mr. Winter, no matter what method you use, all you’re doing is pursuing your true love. That’s not despicable.” The other party said respectfully, “Besides, Shelly can’t complain about you either. You’re just pursuing her because you like her. You’re not forcing her to be with you.”

If Nox could force Shelly to be with him, he would not have had to use so many tricks to get her and Benjamin to break up.

“What should we do next?” Nox asked. It was obvious that he agreed to the plan.

“The next step is to let the whole world know that you are pursuing Shelly. That, you can leave it to me.”

“If you screw it up again this time, I’ll kill you!”

“…Yes.”

After hanging up the phone, Nox was still a little flustered. He could not understand why it was so difficult to woo a woman. Why could Shelly not be with him for the sake of money?

Benjamin went to school to settle the procedures, and because there were many things to sort out, he could not settle them all in a day. That was why Benjamin did not go back to Shelly’s place that day.

His parents were also keeping an eye on him as they were afraid that something would happen. Hence, they did not allow him to leave until everything was settled and stayed with him at a hotel near the school for the night.

The next afternoon, Benjamin finally managed to convince his parents to let him go to Shelly’s. In other words, he was leaving early the day after tomorrow.

The night before his flight, he would have to depart from school as there was a private car to send him to the airport. It meant that he and Shelly would have tonight until tomorrow afternoon to spend time with each other. That would be the last time they could see each other until a year later.

Thinking about it still made him feel a little uncomfortable. He did not expect that they would have to be away from each other right after they started dating.

When Benjamin went to Shelly’s house, he got off the car halfway to buy a bouquet of flowers..
