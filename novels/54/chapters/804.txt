Jeanne hugged Edward tightly.

The expansion of his body and the movement of his muscles felt out of control.

She remembered that the last time Edward was in such a situation, Nox had knocked him out.

Hence, she gritted her teeth and gave Kingsley a look.

Kingsley put down his gun. What he wanted was not Fourth Master Swan’s corpse. Hence, he raised his hand.

Mason approached Edward and Jeanne cautiously.

When he was hunting Edward down, he also exchanged a few blows with Edward. He knew he could not win, so he asked Kingsley for help. In a short time, Edward had killed three assassins. It was brutal and crazy.

He was very careful as he approached Edward from behind.

Seemingly having noticed him, Edward pushed Jeanne away.

Mason’s eyes narrowed, and he turned around, dodging Edward’s crazy attack.

He still had a lingering fear that if Edward’s kick landed on him, he had a feeling that his internal organs would explode.

As such, Mason took a few steps away.

“Give it to me!” Jeanne called out to Mason from behind.

Mason suddenly threw a syringe at Jeanne.

Jeanne leaned over, and the moment Edward attacked Mason, she injected the drug that could instantly knock someone out into Edward’s body from behind.

Edward’s body froze before he turned to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne took a few steps back after she was done.

Edward’s appearance was so terrifying that anyone would be afraid, and she was no exception.

If they hadn’t met for the second time, she did not know if she would have chosen to kill him to make him behave.

She looked at Edward calmly, watching as he approached her step by step.

She did not know if she still existed in Edward’s mind.

Then, she saw that his bloodshot eyes seemed to have lost focus.

She knew that the drug would take an average person only a second to fall to the ground, but now, seconds had passed, and Edward had yet collapsed.

Instead of falling, he kept closing in on Jeanne.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and looked at how terrifying Edward looked and how he looked as if he was about to pounce on her…

The next second, he suddenly fell to the ground without any warning. His tall figure fell flat on the ground, and after ten seconds, the man was still down.

After he fell, his body started to recover at a speed visible to the naked eye. The bulging muscles all over his body quickly recovered to normal.

She remembered Nox saying that Edward’s body was like a spring. If the spring lost its elasticity, the spring would be useless. If a person lost their elasticity, they would… die.

Jeanne was shocked.

She quickly ran over and called out, “Edward.”

By then, Edward had already fallen into a deep sleep.

Mason, on the other hand, had leaned over. After making sure that Edward was no longer a threat, he squatted down to check on Edward’s physical condition, which had recovered to normal when he looked like an alien species just now.

Kingsley also walked over. He looked down at Edward and said, “Take him away.”

Mason nodded his head respectfully and helped Edward up.

Jeanne also supported Edward.

“Jeanne, come with me,” Kingsley ordered. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jeanne glanced at the unconscious Edward and looked at his cold body, which was covered in injuries.

He was covered in wounds because of his inhuman physique just now. However, now that he had recovered to normal, one could see the countless injuries on his body, especially on his right palm.

After jumping down from the 50-meter-high platform and his palm rubbing against the iron pillar, it was now a bloody mess.

“Jeanne!” Kingsley’s voice turned cold.

In the end, Jeanne let go of Edward, followed Kinglsey, and got into his car.

Meanwhile, Mason brought Edward to another car.

With that, a row of cars left.

Jeanne had no idea what Kingsley would do to Edward or what she was going to do to Edward next.

…

Everything seemed calm and less thrilling in South Hampton City, but it could also make people feel like they had nothing to live for.

Monica thought she would forget about it after she woke up. It would be as if nothing happened yesterday, and she would live her own life.

However, that did not happen.

As soon as she opened her eyes and regained consciousness, her mind was filled with Finn’s indifferent expression and Michael’s face when he lied to her. She felt that one day, she might suffocate to death at home.
