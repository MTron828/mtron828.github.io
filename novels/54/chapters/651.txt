Monica nodded. “Okay.”

“Finally, during this time, you have to show that you don’t trust him enough. Let him think you’re doubting everything he’s doing now. This way, it will cause Michael to feel threatened. Once he feels threatened, he’ll do a lot of things that will give him quick success and instant benefits. This will speed up the occurrence of the above two things and then show his flaw!” Jeanne continued.

“Must we do that?” Monica was still a little reluctant.

“We must.” Jeanne gave an affirmative reply.

Monica ultimately agreed.

“Now, let’s settle the matter of the trending list first. After all, the impact it has on Dr. Jones is too great!”

“Alright.” Monica hurriedly nodded.

“In that case, I’ll hang up now.”

“Goodbye.”

“Goodbye.”

After Jeanne hung up the phone, she immediately made another call. “Miles.”

“Yes,” Miles answered.

“Keep an eye on Monica during this time for me.”

“What’s wrong with her?” Miles was surprised.

“I’m afraid she might be in danger.”

“Oh.” Miles agreed. “But what about you?”

“Isn’t K01 here?”

“That’s true.” Miles nodded.

Jeanne did not say much before hanging up the call and getting up from her big bed.

She had rested for two days and had to go back to the Lawrence family’s manor today.

Last night, Jenifer called her to say that the inheritance distribution would be announced today, so she had to be there.

She was rather curious.

Did Alexander not tell Jenifer and Joshua that she was not a Lawrence before he died, so she did not have the right to get the Lawrences’ inheritance?

Unless Alexander had discovered his conscience?

She did not think Alexander had discovered his conscience. Rather, Alexander would have been disappointed when Jenifer and Joshua’s true colors were exposed.

The corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile.

To her, the shares were not important.

If she wanted to get the Lawrences, it would be easy for her! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

…

After Monica and Jeanne ended the call, she immediately called Michael, who picked up her call as soon as it rang.

Monica did not want to suspect Michael, but…

Jeanne would not hurt her.

If Michael really did not do anything, even if it was just a test, it would not matter.

With that thought in mind, she said, “Michael, have you seen the news?”

“Yes, I didn’t think someone would take pictures of us. I’m trying to figure out a way to clarify this matter...” Michael seemed a little agitated.

“Can you think of a way to remove this news?” Monica went straight to the point.

Michael seemed stunned for a moment before he agreed immediately, “Okay, I’ll think of a way.”

“Thank you.”

“Monica, I’m wondering if we should remove the news or explain the situation with Finn to the media. He seems to be getting a bad rap right now,” Michael suddenly suggested.

“What do you mean?” Monica did not quite understand what he was trying to say.

“What I mean is that we should first gather the media and explain to the media what happened with Finn, that it was just a misunderstanding and not what they think about Finn taking revenge on me–”

“How do you make the media believe that Finn isn’t taking revenge on you?” Monica suddenly asked.

Michael was stunned.

He felt that something was different about Monica today.

In the past, he could tell Monica trusted him, but today, she seemed to have some doubts about him.

It was true. He did not want to take down the news so quickly.

He wanted to smear Finn’s name. By doing that, Finn would hate Monica even more, so much that Monica could not even get close to him anymore.

“It takes two to clap. Finn and I… It wasn’t him who hit me. I also hit him. If we fight, it won’t just be Finn’s fault, and the media won’t hold onto him and not let him go!” Michael explained.

He was deliberately making Monica think that he was willing to sacrifice his name for Finn.

“Finn’s notoriety has spread far and wide now. The media won’t believe it. Even if you say that, the media will still think that you’re sacrificing yourself so that Finn won’t be humiliated. That way, they’ll see you as nobler and Finn more despicable,” Monica said bluntly.

Michael frowned.

Today, Monica was not as gullible as usual.

He said, “I didn’t think so far ahead. I just didn’t want to hurt Finn even more. I already felt sorry for him for taking you away from him, but I didn’t expect his reputation would be damaged because of me…”
