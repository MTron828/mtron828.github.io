“Sc*mbag!” Monica said that and left.

Furious, Nox thought, “I treat everyone equally! What a shallow woman!”

..

At the wedding reception, Edward brought Jeanne and gave a toast to them, one by one.

In Harken’s tradition, the newlyweds had to thank all the guests, regardless of their status.

Jeanne only found out through the toast that all of Harken’s influential people were here.

Putting aside the twelve families, even the president was here, but because it was not appropriate for him to be seen in public, he left early. However, Chris Sanders who represented the Sanders, the well-respected Liam and his family, many high-ranking officials, and many businessmen were present.

West was also among those people.

When Edward and Jeanne were giving toasts, he quickly went up to congratulate them.

While he was congratulating them, he did not forget to joke around. “There is no hope for my son.”

Jeanne smiled.

“Fortunately, I’ve detained that kid overseas. If he were here, he might stir up trouble.” West lamented. “Anyway, congratulations to the two of you.”

“Thank you, godfather.”Jeanne smiled.

......

Fourth Master Swan also said respectfully, “Thank you, godfather.”

Jeanne just could not describe the feeling.

She did not know why but hearing Fourth Master Swan addressing someone the same way as she made her feel like they were now one entity, and she found it… unbelievable.

The wedding reception lasted for a very long time. The ceremony started at noon and ended with the wedding reception at night.

After a day of excitement, everyone was tired.

Edward and Jeanne sent off each and every one of the guests until only some of their closest family and friends were left.

Seeing everyone had left, Monica immediately took off her high heels as they really hurt. She held the high heels in her hands without care for her image and said, “It’s finally over.”

Jeanne was also relieved.

Getting married was really tiring. It was not physical torture, as that kind of intensity was nothing for her, but it drained her of her energy.

All the laughing and socializing had made her face stiff.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll head off now.” Monica was really exhausted.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

“I’m sure you can’t wait for us to leave as soon as possible.” Monica flashed Jeanne an evil grin.

Jeanne was speechless.

She simply thought Monica would be really tired after accompanying her for the whole day.

“I don’t want to disturb your wedding night.”

Jeanne almost forgot about that, and her body tensed up.

Monica turned to look at Edward. “Fourth Master, you have to go easy on her.”

In response, Edward glanced at Monica and said, “Okay.”

Okay?

“In that case, goodbye.” Monica picked up her high heels and left.

“We’ll head off now.” Finn smiled.

“Okay.”

With that, Finn and Monica left together.

Seeing there was nothing else to do, Nox left too.

By then, the rest of the Snows also left one after the other until no one else was around.

Other than the servants at home who had started cleaning up the place, only the two of them were left.

The two of them suddenly fell silent.

“Ms. Lawrence, it’s time to go back to the room.”

Jeanne’s heart tightened. She felt... inexplicably nervous.

Then, Edward suddenly bent down, and Jeanne instinctively hugged Fourth Master Swan’s neck in shock.

With a smile on his face, Edward carried Jeanne and strode into Bamboo Garden, which was extremely quiet tonight.

Even Teddy was not there.

It was as if the place was suddenly cleared out.

Only then did it hit Jeanne, and she became a little agitated. “Where’s George?”

Edward smiled again, but this time, his smile looked like he had committed a crime.

“You’re only thinking about your son now?”

She had handed George over to Teddy because of all the wedding ceremonies and reception she had to attend. However, now that Teddy was not around, where was George?

“George will be staying at Universe Garden tonight,” Edward suddenly said.

“What?” Jeanne was shocked.

Did he send George to Old Master Swan?

“My dad is quite lonely by himself, so George can accompany him.”

“George is not used to talking to strangers or staying in a stranger’s place.”

“My dad is not a stranger.”

“Fourth Master Swan!”

“Shh.” At that moment, Edward had already carried her into his room.

The room, which had always been black and white, had been decorated with more pastel colors.

Even the big bed was white and covered with white rose petals.

As Edward placed her on his bed, the seductiveness of the rose under the night light made her even more attractive.

At that moment, Edward stared at her in a daze.

A little numb from the man’s stare, Jeanne said, “I’m talking about George–”

“Stop fooling around,” Edward said.

She felt his warm breath on her cheek and furrowed her brows.

“Tomorrow morning, I’ll ask Teddy to bring him back.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

He should have discussed it with her first!

She could totally imagine how upset George was at that moment.

“But tonight.” Edward leaned closer to Jeanne’s ear.

Jeanne’s body went numb.

“No one can disturb us.”

Jeanne started to feel nervous, so nervous that her heart was about to beat out of her chest.

She then felt Fourth Master Swan’s lips on her earlobe…

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne stopped him.

Edward stopped.

“Isn’t this a marriage of convenience?”

“So...” Edward raised her eyebrows.

“Don’t do it.” Jeanne’s voice was very soft.

“Ms. Lawrence.” When Edward said that, her magnetic voice sounded a little sexy. “Isn’t a marriage of convenience another term for friends with benefits?”

“...”

Ew!
