Chapter 496: Father and Son “Reunited”

“You can choose your husband, but you can’t choose your dad!” Edward reminded George.

He meant that with all the facts laid out, so the little one had to accept it.

George turned to look at Edward. Displeasure was written all over his small face.

He did not understand why his father would suddenly appear again after being dead for so many years.

Hence, he said, “I may not be able to choose my dad, but I can choose whether I like him or not.”

“You will eventually like me.” Edward was certain.

“I won’t.” George was also very certain.

There was some tension between the adult and the kid.

Jeanne felt she was in a difficult position by being put in the middle.

On second thought, everything started because of her as she was the one who had been lying to George that his father was dead.

However, it was not entirely her fault.

She had never thought she and Edward would cross paths, let alone be together. At the thought that George would not get to know his father and might not even meet him, she could only tell him that his father was “dead”. That made him give up the idea of finding his father ever since he was young.

Little did she know that the world was unpredictable and that she and Edward would... get married.

......

Suddenly, she stood up from the sofa.

George and Edward both looked at her.

She said, “You two have a good chat. I woke up too early today. I’m heading back to my room to take a nap.”

After that, she really did leave.

She had a feeling it was best she stayed out of this father-and-son reunion.

However, she also admitted that she did not want to make things difficult, so she left it to them to solve the issue themselves.

Once she left, George, who was in the living room, could not be bothered to hide his emotions anymore. He looked unhappy. “Fourth Master, you don’t have to try. I won’t like you.”

“I will try my best to change what you dislike about me,” Edward said sincerely.

After all, he was still a little unhappy about his son not liking him.

“No, thanks.”

Edward was really rendered speechless by this little brat. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Nevertheless, George continued, “So, Fourth Master, don’t waste your time.”

After saying that, George also wanted to get up and return to his room.

“George,” Edward suddenly called out to him.

George turned his head around.

Edward said, “Why don’t we make a deal?”

George frowned, thinking that Fourth Master Swan was always evil.

He said, “What do you want to talk about?”

“You love your mother very much, don’t you?” Edward asked.

George thought for a moment before answering, “I do.”

The reason why he thought about it was not that he needed to think about it but to prevent Fourth Master Swan from scheming against him.

He believed that his mother married Fourth Master Swan because she was schemed against by Fourth Master Swan.

“Since you love her very much, you don’t want her to be sad, do you?”

“I don’t.” George nodded.

“But you know, if you don’t like me, your mother will be very sad. After all, I am indeed your biological father.”

George bit his lips.

“Of course, I’m not asking you to like me from the bottom of your heart. However, when your mother is around, don’t show her that you reject me.” Edward lured George into his trap, step by step.

George looked at Edward and said firmly, “Even if I don’t like you, my mother won’t be sad. My mother will never tell me to do anything or like any kind of person.”

Convincing him was not so easy.

“It’s because she loves you very much, and that’s why she indulges you. She doesn’t want to make things difficult for you, so she hides her emotions. If you really love your mother, you should be more considerate of her.”

George scrutinized Edward. He had a feeling that the latter was lying to him.

Edward’s expression did not change. Instead, he continued, “The reason your mother married me and gave birth to you is simple. It’s because your mother liked me. With that, the fact that you don’t like me will put your mother in a difficult position.”

“My mother has never said that she liked you.” George was confident in his reply.

Edward choked on his saliva and coughed.

Teddy, who was beside them, secretly laughed again.

He did not expect that one day, his high and mighty master, Fourth Master Swan, would be helpless against a six-year-old brat.

Edward had a serious look on his face. “Some things don’t need to be said. I can tell.”

“Well, I can’t.” George was still indifferent to Edward. Then, he added, “Moreover, my mother once said that in this world, other than Kingsley and I, other men should be killed.”

Edward was stabbed in the heart again. “What else did your mother say?”

“Why should I tell you?” George raised his eyebrows.

Edward stared at George.

For the first time, he was rendered speechless by a little kid.
