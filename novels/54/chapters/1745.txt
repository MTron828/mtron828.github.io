Shelly looked at Nox, who was sweating profusely, and wondered whether he ran over. After all, the parking lot of the kindergarten was half a street away from the main gate.

She said, “It’s alright. It’s good that you’re here. Bella has been waiting for you. The teacher had urged her to go in a few times, but Bella refused to leave. She said that since you promised her that you would come, you would be here.”

Nox explained, “There was some traffic on the road. Let’s go in.”

“Let’s go. “Shelly nodded.

The three of them walked into the kindergarten together. By then, the teacher had begun to line everyone up. Since they arrived a little late, they were at the back of the queue.

The principal of the kindergarten presented a speech first. However, it did not take long before the sports games began, and the classes started to gather and arrange themselves.

Bella’s class teacher said, “The activities this time will include ball tossing, piggybacking, water balloon race, kangaroo jumping, ring tossing, and wheelbarrow. In the end, there’s a school-wide parent relay race. For the first five activities, all parents of the students must participate. Then, according to the ranking points, the top three families will be given individual rewards.

“Of course, the families that do not get into the top three will also be given special rewards. As for the last relay race, our class requires five fathers and five mothers. Parents who are willing to sign up can raise their hands.”

After the announcement, Bella was getting restless. She had been holding Nox’s hand the entire time. It seemed like she could not bear to leave him because she was really happy that Nox was there to attend her sports day.

She said, “Uncle Nox, can you participate?”

Nox lowered his head.” Do you want me to participate?”

“Yes,” Bella hurriedly replied in her tender voice.

Then, Nox raised his hand without hesitation. “I’ll participate in the parents’ relay race.”

“Alright, Bella’s father will be the first to participate.” The teacher said, “Let’s give him a round of applause.”

The whole class clapped for Nox, and it made Nox feel a little embarrassed.

“Other parents, please don’t be shy.” The teacher continued to encourage the crowd.

Shelly was about to raise her hand when she heard the teacher say, “It’s best to send only one parent in each family so that more families can participate.” Hence, Shelly put her hand down.

While the teacher was tabulating the name list, the others got a little noisy waiting for the start of the games.

“Uncle Nox.” Bella looked at Nox and called out to him.

“Yes?” Nox smiled.

He was really patient with Bella, and Shelly saw it.

“Can I call you Daddy today?” Bella asked.

Nox’s heart skipped a beat. When he heard Bella’s request, he felt rather nervous. He turned to look at Shelly, obviously seeking Shelly’s opinion. However, Shelly did not answer, so Nox did not dare to say yes.

Seeing that Nox did not say anything, Bella said in a childish voice, “The teacher said you were my father just now.”

Nox patted Bella’s head, and when he looked at Bella’s expectant eyes, he could not care less anymore. Even if Shelly did not like it, it would only be for half a day today.

Therefore, he said, “Okay.”

Bella, upon receiving a reply, became even more excited.

Her crisp voice was loud and clear as she said, “Daddy.”

It looked like she had been waiting for that moment for a long time. After all, every child would want parents of their own. As Nox stroked Bella’s head, the two of them looked intimate, like they were really father and daughter. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Once everything was prepared, the sports games officially began. In the first activity, the child was supposed to throw the ball into the parent’s basket. Whoever threw the most balls within the specified time would win. The participants would be a parent and a child.

When Shelly was about to go on stage, Bella said, “Daddy, I want you to do this with me.”

Shelly simply looked at him. This time, Nox did not ask for Shelly’s approval and agreed immediately.

According to the arrangement, the two of them walked to the waiting area. Bella and Nox were put in the third group.

Nox was observing the situation of the two groups in front of him. Then, she squatted down and said to Bella, “When you throw the ball later, you must throw it hard. Just throw it at me, and I will think of a way to catch all the balls for you.”

“Alright.” Bella nodded.

Nox even did a demonstration for Bella, who observed very seriously.

Shelly was also beside them. For the first time, she felt that Nox was different from how she had imagined him..
