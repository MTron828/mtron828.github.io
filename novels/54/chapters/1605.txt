e in the room, including Edward, Jeanne, Finn, and Monica.

At that moment, Nox thought that he should stay fainted as he did not want to see anyone for even a second. They should just let him die!

“What’s wrong? Are you still feeling unwell? The doctor said you have a slight concussion and there’s a huge bump on the back of your head. Where does it hurt? I’ll call the doctor to take a look at you immediately,” Mrs. Winter asked anxiously.

“I want to die,” Nox said bluntly.

Mrs. Winter pursed her lips. She, too, did not know what to say about his son’s wedding.

She had been looking forward to her son’s wedding with Zoe as she had thought that Zoe was the best daughter-in-law the Winters could have. She was even glad that she did not stop Nox’s marriage because of Shelly. However, she was utterly humiliated at the wedding hall today.

She, too, was furious. When she thought about how Zoe had deceived them, she really wanted to slap Zoe. At that moment, she was so angry that she almost fainted. Fortunately, she managed to calm herself down, but she did not expect Nox to faint from anger instead.

If it were anyone else, they probably would not be able to accept that fact either, and she could not help but feel sorry for what happened to her son. Upon hearing Nox’s words now, she felt bad but did not know how to comfort “Even if you die, you’ll still be cuckolded. It doesn’t mean everything will go back to normal after you die,” Monica suddenly said.

She just had to make sure she pissed Nox off, huh?

As Nox expected, they would see him as a joke, and it was not just them. The entire country was laughing at him, and his life was a joke.

“It’s not your fault that you were cheated on. What’s the use of you wanting to die? Zoe isn’t dead, so why take it so hard?” Monica spoke again.

Nox opened his eyes again after closing his eyes for a while. When he opened them again, the world was not spinning as fast as before.

He shouted at Monica, “Try cheating on Finn and see if he feels like dying!”

Finn’s face immediately darkened. He knew that nothing good ever came out of Finn’s mouth, and he should not have any sympathy for him.

“Alright. All of you, get out. I want to be alone, ” Nox said impatiently to them. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At that moment, he was a wreck, and he did not want to see anyone, now or in the future. He would hide himself in the room and never go out again!

Mrs. Winter still felt a little sorry for him. “Nox, don’t be too upset. It’s not your fault anyway. Don’t be too hard on yourself. We’ve already broken off the engagement with the Sullivans. They’ll compensate us for all the losses caused by the wedding-”

“Don’t mention the Sullivans or Zoe in front of me. I don’t want to see that woman for the rest of my life, and I don’t want to hear anything about her,” Nox said with a broken heart.

Never in his life did he want to see her again. From now on, that woman would no longer exist in his life..
