In the basement, Jeanne walked in with the first aid kit.

Both of Edward’s wrists were bound by chains, and his entire body was leaning against the wall. His head was low, which gave the illusion that his entire body was so weak that he did not even have the strength to raise his head.

Jeanne walked over and squatted in front of him.

However, he did not seem to sense her presence because there was no reaction from him.

Jeanne looked at him pensively.

“Edward,” she said.

There seemed to be a slight reaction from Edward’s body, but it also seemed like there was none.

Jeanne called out to him and reached out to unbutton his white shirt.

Rather than calling it white, it was more appropriate to say that it was now all red — blood red.

She was careful not to touch his body.

Under his tattered shirt, whip wounds were all over his body. There were also some soft tissue abrasions and bruises from jumping off the 50-meter-high platform last night.

Falling from such a high platform last night, she was unharmed, yet he was covered in injuries.

After Jeanne took off his clothes, she opened the first aid kit, took out disinfectant iodophor, and approached his body.

The moment she saw his bloody marks, she paused and said softly, “Bear with it. There’s no anesthetic.”

Edward did not answer her. It was as if he was already dead and would never speak again.

Jeanne applied the iodophor on his wound.

Instinctively, Edward’s body trembled uncontrollably from the intense pain. However, he did not make a sound or a groan.

As Jeanne cleaned his wound and disinfected it, she said, “The assassins from the Hills can’t use anesthetics because it will paralyze the body. Assassins are in danger their entire lives, so in order to stay alive, they can’t lose control of their own bodies. ”

She was explaining why they had no anesthetic, and he just listened without reacting.

She carefully cleaned all the wounds on his body before she started to apply the ointment to his wounds.

The medicinal properties of the ointment were very strong, so it could cause bad irritation on the skin.

Just as she rubbed it on, Edward’s body trembled violently again. It was as if his entire skin was trembling uncontrollably. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly but did not stop. Instead, she sped up and applied it all over his body.

After applying it, Edward’s body was covered in a layer of sweat, despite the cold weather. He was in so much pain that he was sweating.

Jeanne wiped him down with a clean handkerchief. Then, she wrapped his wounds with gauze and bandages.

With his upper body cleaned and bandaged, Jeanne took off her thick coat that was still warm from being on her body and draped it over Edward’s body.

As usual, Edward did not react much. His body was so weak that he probably only felt pain.

Jeanne lowered her head and continued to treat the wound on his lower body.

She used a pair of scissors to cut open his pants. Under his pants, his thighs, waist, and abdomen were covered in wounds.

Bit by bit, she disinfected, applied medicine, and bandaged his wounds.

After a long time, she finally cleaned up all his wounds. However, he was sitting in a pool of blood. Even if he was treated, he would still be infected by the blood.

As such, she had no choice but to take off another piece of clothing.

Then, she helped Edward sit on the ground.

“Aren’t you cold?” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne had just placed the clothes under him when she heard Edward’s words, and her fingers stiffened.

For a moment, she really thought that Edward had fainted.

In fact, he should not be conscious at all. Otherwise, how could he have endured it and not made a single sound?

However, she said, “I won’t be cold in a while.”

It would not be cold when she returned to her warm room in a while.

Edward did not say anything more.

After Jeanne had treated the wounds on his upper and lower body, Edward’s entire body was wrapped up like a mummy.

Then, she turned to look at his right palm, where his injuries were the most serious. She felt that if she allowed it to fester, his right hand would be crippled.

She looked at the bloody palm, lowered her head, and picked up the cigarette that she had just taken from the assassin. She asked, “Do you want to smoke?”

Edward’s lowered head seemed to move, and he raised his head to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “I’ll light a cigarette for you. You can distract yourself for a while.”

Edward’s body and head were leaning against the wall as he looked up at her.
