1299 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

Finn nodded. He then placed the breakfast in front of her. The two of them sat opposite each other and ate quietly.

“Monica,” Finn suddenly said.

“Yeah.”

“I will take the contraceptive measures from now on,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica’s gulped. She was already aware of it last night.

She said, “Okay.”

In any case, it did not matter who did it.

Since… Finn did not really want it.

“There’s an academic exchange at the hospital. I’m going on a business trip for a week,” Finn said.

“When are you leaving?”

“Today.”

“Oh, okay.” Monica nodded.

“If you’re scared, you can stay with your parents for a few days.”

“I’m not a child.” Monica could not help but laugh.

At her age, she was no longer afraid of the dark.

“The way you look today reminds me of the first time I saw you,” Finn said. “You look very youthful and energetic.”

“Looks like all these years of maintenance weren’t in vain. I didn’t spend so much money for nothing.” Hearing the praise, she was rather happy.

Moreover, it was unprecedented to hear it from Finn.

Finn smiled as well.

Yesterday, he had actually thought about it for a long time. He wondered why Monica did not want a child, and if he should have one.

Later on, he decided to respect Monica’s choice.

After all, she was different from before. She used to be a little girl who did not know the hardships of the world. She could be carefree and do whatever she wanted. However, she had a lot of responsibilities now. She was at the peak of her career, so it was natural that she did not want a child.

There were so many late marriages and late pregnancy nowadays. He thought that in a few years, it would still be fine.

Looking at Monica’s youthful and energetic appearance today, he was once again determined.

They finished their breakfast. As Finn was going on a business trip today, he was not required to go to the hospital to work, so he did not have to go out so early.

As Monica was waiting for Edward to pick her up, she was not in a hurry to leave either.

The two of them sat on the sofa and used their phones to deal with their own matters.

It seemed to be a way for them to get along. They did not need to talk much. The two of them just needed to stay by each other’s side. They needed not stick together all the time too.

Everyone was busy with their own things. It was fine as long as they came home.

The phone finally rang.

Monica answered and instantly greeted respectfully, “Chief.”

“Get downstairs. I’ll wait for you downstairs.”

“Okay.”

After Monica put down her phone, her expression changed instantly.

Finn looked at Monica’s small actions and smiled. Monica was actually still the same old Monica; a person’s nature would not change.

“I’m leaving,” Monica put down her phone and said to Finn.

“Mm,” Finn replied.

Monica walked out of the house.

There were no emotions on her face even though they would be apart, nor any reluctance that Finn would be away for a week.

She walked into the elevator. At this moment, all she could think about was why that Sc*mbag Swan was looking for her.

When it came to work stuff, did he not usually ask Nox to do it?

She could not figure it out and refused to speculate anymore.

She braced herself and walked to the entrance. She saw a few black cars parked at the entrance with an imposing aura.

She walked over and a bodyguard in a black suit opened the car door for her.

She got in.

The moment she sat in, she saw the Sc*mbag Swan. Although he was a sc*mbag, he was still handsome! He was so handsome that it was as if the world had collapsed.

She settled in her seat and the car departed. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Monica did not know where Edward was taking her, so she just sat there obediently.

Until Edward started the conversation, “Candice—you should know her.”

Monica was speechless. Once she got into the car and told her about Candice, was he not afraid that she would be so angry that she would scratch his impeccably handsome face?!

“She’s not familiar with South Hampton. Help me bring her around today,” Edward said bluntly.

Was this guy out of his mind?

He wanted someone else to bring his woman out to play. She thought about it again; Edward was so busy that he probably did not have time to accompany her.

Even so, he should not have asked her to do it.

...

She could sell her skills but not her body.

F*ck.

“This is for your expenses.” Edward handed a card to Monica.

Monica simply accepted it, because when with this man, she could not resist at all.
