861 Jeanne and Monica’s Joint Counterattack

She should have contacted them long ago but chose not to time and time again because of her own reasons.

However, when she opened up the news of Harken to see a piece about Monica and Michael’s wedding, she could not control herself and called her.

There was no way Monica would be so sincere about marrying Michael. Something must have happened to her.

She recalled how bad of a friend she had been. Every time she needed help, Monica would risk her life to help her. However, when Monica needed help, she was always absent.

“Jeanne, you were finally willing to call me. Do you know how worried I’ve been? When you suddenly disappeared, I thought it was going to be a repeat of seven years ago. I couldn’t find you no matter what!” Monica cried fiercely. She felt so wronged.

Jeanne wanted to ask if Monica had asked Edward about her disappearance. Although, even if she did, that did not meant Edward would tell her since Edward was probably prejudiced against Monica because of Finn.

She could even imagine that if Monica had went to Bamboo Garden to find her, she would probably have been rejected, especially if she met Nox. With Edward injured as well, Nox definitely would not have left.

Jeanne felt very guilty at the thought of this. She had indeed cared too little about Monica.

She said, “It’s not that I wanted to disappear all of a sudden. There were just some things that made it impossible for me to return to Harken for the time being.”

Monica was still sobbing. Other than crying, She did not know what else she to say. So she hugged the phone and continued crying. Jeanne cried until she was on the verge of a breakdown. At this moment, she really felt that she had committed an unpardonable crime.

“Don’t cry,” Jeanne consoled her, little speechless. “I’m not dead.”

Monica was suddenly amused by Jeanne. For the first time in forever, she cracked the most sincere smile she ever had.

She had been too depressed recently.

Even though she kept rejecting Michael in her own way, deep down in her heart, she really did not want to court death to this extent. She did not want all these people despising and insulting her, either. All she wanted was to live a peaceful life.

With Jeanne’s phone call, she felt that the world was not such a cold and distant place anyway. At least she had the best family in the world and a friend who was sincere. They would never betray her.

In actuality, as long as one’s pursuit in life was not too high, one could still discover many beautiful things in the world. Therefore, she did not need to feel that the world had collapsed because of Michael.

She had to live on.

“I saw the news of your marriage to Michael,” Jeanne said.

Monica wiped away her tears. Now that she had thought it through, she felt much more relaxed. She said, “It’s on the 15th of next month.”

“Do you still want to be with him?” Jeanne asked.

She had missed a lot of things between Monica and Michael while she was away. Jeanne did not know if Monica was still oblivious to the fact that Michael had been lying to her, and that’s why she was not very emotional about it.

“What else can I do? I can’t beat him,” Monica said as she calmed herself down.

“You can’t win?” Jeanne frowned.

“That’s right. You all knew that Michael was lying to me, and I was stupid enough to think that I was only saving the dying and healing the injured, doing the god’s work in the world.” Monica mocked herself.

“You found out?” Jeanne was almost certain.

“Yep. Michael’s mother personally told me that Michael was not in a crisis of unemployment at all. It was just a show for the Sanders so that they would put him in a position of power without any worries. To the Sanders, Michael was a threat if his ambition was too big. Michael had to let the Sanders think that he would give up everything for me. Only then would the Sanders sincerely support and promote him,” Monica said angrily. “Michael admitted it too.”

When she thought about how she had been deceived by Michael, she hated him to the core.

Jeanne fell silent.

She did not think Michael’s goal was that simple. After all, the Sanders would not be so easily deceived. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, she felt that the most important thing now was not to find out Michael’s other purpose, as that would take time. It was to make sure that Monica would not be threatened by Michael and forced to marry him.
