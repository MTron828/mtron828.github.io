Chapter 467: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

Jeanne looked at Edward.

“What an eyesore.” Edward enunciated each word clearly.

Suddenly, Jeanne smiled.

They were indeed an eyesore.

She initially had a lot of things to do and was too busy to deal with Jasmine and the Lawrences, but now it seemed like she had given them too much time to mess about.

She said, “I can handle it myself.”

Edward frowned.

“I really can this time.” She could do it even without his help.

Edward hugged Jeanne in his arms and said, “Okay.”

He had absolute trust in her.

With that, the three of them returned home.

Edward and Jeanne returned to their room while George returned to his.

At that moment, Jeanne suddenly called out to George. “George.”

......

“Yes.”

“Your hair is too long. Let me trim it for you.”

“Okay.”

“You know how to cut hair?” Edward was a little surprised.

Jeanne said, “I know a lot of things.”

Edward had a pensive look on her face. “Is that so?”

Jeanne ignored that flirtatious man and brought George back to George’s room.

When she closed the door, Jeanne immediately gave George the piece of stubble she had hidden and wrapped inside a napkin.

George was surprised.

Jeanne said, “Give it to Miles.”

“Alright.” George nodded.

He usually did not ask too many questions, but at that moment, Jeanne was rather silent as she looked at the napkin, which was wrapped in a ball in front of her.

“Mom,” George called her.

It was because she did not have the intention to give the ball of napkin she was holding to him.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

“Are you okay?”

Jeanne also realized that she was overthinking it.

Hence, she took a deep breath and gave the tissue to George. She said, “Don’t let anyone find out. Otherwise...”

George looked at her.

Otherwise, they might die a horrible death.

“Let me cut your hair.” Jeanne took another deep breath and got up to pick up the professional scissors that were in George’s room.

After George sat on the chair obediently, Jeanne started trimming his hair.

Once she trimmed his hair, Jeanne made George take a shower, and George walked into the bathroom obediently.

Jeanne squatted down to wash George’s hair. As she was washing it, she seemed to be a little distracted…

If Old Master Swan’s stubble was replaced with George’s hair…

Jeanne suddenly broke out in cold sweat.

How could she have such thoughts?

She gritted her teeth and threw all George’s hair into the trash can before returning to her room.

When she pushed open the door, Edward had already finished showering. A towel was draped over him while he lay on the bed, looking at her phone as if he was waiting for her.

Jeanne asked as she walked in, “Why aren’t you asleep?”

“I can’t sleep without you.”

That fellow really had a sweet mouth.

With that, she walked into the bathroom. After taking a shower and drying her hair, she returned to the room, where Edward was still waiting for her.

Jeanne climbed onto the bed and was about to turn off the lights.

“Are you going to sleep already?” Edward asked.

Jeanne’s body trembled.

Could she just rest for one night after all that had happened today? Tomorrow morning, she would be torn apart by others.

Could he give her some space tonight so that she could wake up tomorrow feeling more energized?

She turned her head and looked at Edward resentfully and unwillingly.

“Come and help me untie the towel,” a certain someone said.

Jeanne stared at him and did not move, but Edward was not embarrassed either. He stretched out his long arm and pulled Jeanne into his embrace.

While Jeanne struggled, Edward pressed Jeanne under her body, separating a little distance between them.

“My period is coming.” Jeanne found an excuse.

“It won’t stop you from taking off my clothes.”

Jeanne was speechless.

“Be good.” Edward enticed her.

Jeanne really could not resist a man’s lust sometimes.

She reached out her hand, slowly untying Edward’s bathrobe, and was stunned to see what was under the bathrobe.

She looked straight at his underwear.

“Does it look good?” Edward asked.

He was so slutty.

“Alright.” Edward suddenly got off Jeanne’s body.

Upon seeing that, Jeanne somehow felt a little reluctant for him to get off.

“Go to sleep.” Edward turned off the light.

Jeanne was speechless.

Did he do all that just so she would look at the leopard print thong she had chosen for him today? What the hell was that man trying to do?

In the darkness, Edward hugged Jeanne in her arms. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

Edward said, “Jeannie.”

“Hm?”

“I love you very much.”

Jeanne bit her lip unconsciously, and her heart beat a little faster.

Edward would often say some sweet words when they were together, and each time, it would make her heart beat abnormally. She even felt a little... guilty.

It was not a nice feeling.

She said, “Don’t love me too much.”

However, that man hugged her even tighter.

“At least, I don’t love you that much.”

Since she did not love him that much, he should not love her that much because there would come a day when they would fight each other mercilessly.

That night, Edward did not say anything else after that. When she said that she did not love him that much, he hugged her tightly in his arms.

The two of them hugged each other as they lay there.

With their thoughts running, they just… waited in silence.

The next day, the sky had just brightened when Teddy knocked on their door.

“Fourth Master. Madam.” Teddy sounded a little anxious. “The Old Master wants you to hurry over!”

Jeanne opened her eyes, and Edward also opened his at that moment.

The two of them clearly had insomnia last night.

At that moment, upon hearing Teddy’s anxious voice, they both woke up. It was as if they had long expected that something was about to happen!

“Fourth Master?” Teddy knocked twice again when he did not hear a response.

Edward sat up from the bed and replied coldly, “I heard it.”

“Yes.” Only then did Teddy leave respectfully.

Edward turned to look at Jeanne, who had also woken up.

As she got off the bed, she said coldly, “Since she can’t help but seek her destruction, I will fulfill her wish!”

She would fulfill Jasmine’s wish!
