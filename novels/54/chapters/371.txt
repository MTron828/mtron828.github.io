Chapter 372: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

“So was my decision to marry you and have you protect me wrong from the start?”

“No,” Edward answered her with certainty. “Even if I die, I will protect you.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

The environment they were in right now did not seem suitable for stirring up emotions, much less talking about love.

Hence, Edward stood up and said, “Let’s go to the forest to find some fresh water and then think of a way to find something to eat.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne followed behind Edward.

The forest at night was dark.

Since both of their phones had been in the water and had yet dried completely, they dared not turn on their phones. Therefore, they just fumbled around and kept walking deeper into the forest.

“Jeannie,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

“Hm?” Jeanne carefully observed the environment here.

“Are you afraid of ghosts?”

Was he crazy to talk about ghosts at a time like that?

......

Nevertheless, she replied, “I’m not.”

“In that case, are you afraid of animals?”

“No.”

“Are you afraid of snakes?” Edward asked again.

“No!” Jeanne replied. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“That’s good.”

Jeanne was speechless.

The two of them went deeper into the forest.

Fortunately, there was usually a lot of rain on the small island.

The two of them had drunk enough water while they were walking. All they needed now was to eat something and then sleep to recover their strength. After that, they would wait for Nox to come and get them.

When they walked to a certain spot in the forest, Edward suddenly stopped.

“Let’s rest here,” Edward said.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

At that moment, she could only listen to him.

“I’ll go and make a fire,” Edward said.

“Sure,” Jeanne replied.

“Hold this for me.” Edward suddenly handed her something.

In the darkness, she could not see, so she asked with a frown, “What is it?”

By then, she had already reached her hand out. However, all she felt was a bone-piercing coldness and a soft body.

The next second, she retracted her hand.

“Didn’t you say you weren’t afraid?” Edward suddenly smiled.

Jeanne rolled her eyes at him.

She might not be afraid of that soft and cold-bodied animal, but she still found it a little... disgusting.

“When did you catch it?” Jeanne asked.

“When I asked you if you were afraid,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Why did she not notice it?

She did not even notice any movements along the way.

How did he find a snake?

“Take it from me,” Edward said.

Hence, Jeanne could only grit her teeth and take it. The feeling of it was really... hard to describe.

After Edward handed the snake to Jeanne, she went to pick up some dry leaves and branches. In the process, she also found a stone and wood to make a fire.

In a short while, they had a fire.

Jeanne watched Edward move about with astonishing familiarity and thought, ‘Who the hell is Edward?’

Jeanne sized him up without batting an eyelid and saw that he had already started the fire.

In an instant, the surroundings became warmer.

On a small island like the one they were on, the difference in temperature between morning and evening was drastic. At that moment, it was only about ten degrees.

The two of them were also in wet, thin clothes, so it was only a matter of time before they started feeling cold.

“Come closer.” After Edward had started the fire, he made a mat out of dry leaves for her to sit on.

Jeanne went over and sat down before Edward took the snake in her hand.

First, he used a stone to blow up the snake’s head and remove its gall. Then, he placed it on a simple stand and roasted it.

After a while, the smell of meat wafted in the air.

The two of them looked at the fire in front of them, and just like that, the clothes on their bodies were eventually dry.

“Nox should arrive tomorrow.” Jeanne calculated the time.

“Yes.” Edward nodded. “So if we don’t encounter any danger tonight, we can return home safely tomorrow.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh. She deliberately asked, “Edward, are you happy with this honeymoon?”

“Of course.” Edward smiled. “I’m happy with being with you no matter what.”

He really knew how to pass the buck.

As Jeanne hugged her body and squatted in front of the fire, she looked at the snake before her with eager eyes. It was getting cooked bit by bit.

Edward took the snake off the grill and tore a piece for Jeanne. “There’s no salt, but filling your stomach is more important.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded and started eating.

Although it was tasteless, it was better than not eating it.

Moreover, there was a semi-charred area on the meat that was a little crispy and moist. In short, she found the taste not bad.

With that, the two of them quickly ate the snake, which was not considered small, to fill their stomachs.
