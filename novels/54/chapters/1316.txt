1317 The First Negotiation With George

Monica frowned.

Frankly, she had never really thought about this.

After all, for so many years, there did not seem to be any outstanding men pursuing her.

When she thought of Michael, her ex, she felt an inexplicable fear.

“I’m just saying.” Brandon saw that Monica was a little embarrassed and quickly added, “However, since you’ve been with Dr. Jones for so many years, it doesn’t matter if you make do or not. It’s also because you have feelings for him. Otherwise, who would be willing to waste their youth on anyone?”

Monica felt that what Brandon said made sense.

Besides, she did not want to think too much about it. She felt that the relationship between her and Finn would one day… take its natural course.

On the road to a breakup.

Or a marriage.

The two of them finished breakfast. Brandon handed a wet tissue to Monica.

“As a man, you’ve prepared quite a lot of things.” Monica could not help but praise him.

After all, other than wet tissues, there was also mouthwash and chewing gum. After eating the dumplings, there was surely an aftertaste in the mouth that would feel uncomfortable.

“Thank you for the compliment,” Brandon said cheerfully.

It was just the two of them. There did not seem to be any awkwardness even though it had been so many years since they last met.

When they were done eating, Brandon started the car and drove. When they arrived at Brandon’s villa, Monica’s parents were already there.

Seeing them come together, they were still a little surprised. “Why are you together?”

It was Ruby. Monica felt her mother’s question was a little suggestive.

Brandon quickly explained, “My parents asked me to pick up Monica.”

Monica turned to look at Brandon. This guy was quite smart.

Ruby did not think too much about it. However, her sharp eyes saw their attire. “Is this… a couple outfit?”

“Oh you, where has your mind wandered to?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

Ruby was a little speechless. “You kid!”

“Monica, come here. Let me take a good look at you. You’ve grown so big.” A woman in her fifties walked out of the kitchen into the hall and walked toward Monica enthusiastically.

Monica greeted politely, “Hello, Mrs. Hayes.”

“Look at you, you’re so beautiful. I remember you playing with our Brandon when you were young. At that time, Brandon was running behind Monica’s butt. Now that I think about it, it’s been many years.”

“That’s right,” Brandon’s father chimed in. “When our family left, Brandon cried so sadly. It was only when Monica comforted him and said that she would wait for him to come back that we could successfully take him away.”

“Now that you mention it, I still remember that Brandon said that he wanted to marry Monica when he returned!” Brandon’s mother smiled and said, “It’s true that children’s words carry no harm.”

The two families chatted happily.

Initially, Monica thought that it would be awkward to not see him for a long time. Unexpectedly, she did not feel anything at all. Instead, she felt very at ease.

Monica’s family only left Brandon’s house after dinner.

Since Monica’s parents were next door, there was no need for anyone to send her home. Monica wanted to leave on her own to her and Finn’s apartment, but Brandon insisted on sending her there.

She did not refuse.

They arrived at her neighborhood.

“Thank you for your hospitality today. See you at work on Monday.” Monica was obviously very casual with Brandon.

“See you on Monday.” Brandon smiled.

Monica opened the car door and got out. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She had just taken a few steps when Brandon called out loudly, “Monica.”

Monica turned around.

Brandon walked up to her a few steps and said, “This is a box of cookies that my mother baked herself. She asked me to bring it to you before we left. I almost forgot.”

“Thank you.” Monica took it. “Mrs. Hayes is still so nice.”

“But don’t force yourself if it doesn’t taste good. Sometimes, my mother does things on a whim.”

“Who would say that about their own mother?” Monica was speechless. “It’s getting late. I’m going in.”

“Take care, Monica.”

Monica smiled faintly.

The moment she turned around, she suddenly saw a familiar figure standing at the entrance of the neighborhood.
