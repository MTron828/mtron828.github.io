Chapter 540: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I have thought it through. I know all of you think I’m stupid for using this method to help Michael. You think I think of myself as a saint, but I’m actually evil. However, you’re not me. You don’t know how bad I feel when I see Michael like this because of me. I feel so guilty!” Monica’s sobbing voice sounded, and she said fiercely to Jeanne, “Michael is really, really good to me...”

Jeanne did not expect Michael to be such a good person in Monica’s heart.

In fact, did she know what kind of person Michael was?

Edward and Nox had been secretly investigating Michael, but after so long, they did not find any evidence against Michael.

Moreover, Michael and Eden were friends. Yet, out of so many things Eden had done to hurt her on purpose, none of them had anything to do with Michael. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She held her phone tightly.

At that moment, she was also a little speechless.

In the end, no one knew what kind of person Michael was, and Monica was not so stupid as to not tell if a person was good or bad to her!

If she was willing to sacrifice herself to that extent for Michael, at least Michael must be treating Monica pretty well.

Jeanne was silent for a moment while Monica cried from all the grievance she was feeling.

She was also sad to have made the decision to help Michael, and what she needed was everyone’s encouragement instead of their disapproval.

If she had other choices, why would she choose such a method?

If she had other choices, she would not have had to do this.

Jeanne said, “Even if Michael is good to you, what about Finn? Is he not good to you?”

The tears that Monica was holding back overflowed.

“He almost died because of you. Is he not good enough for you? All you can see now is Michael’s misery, but have you seen Finn suffer? He has to watch you and Michael be together. Have you ever thought about how he feels about that? Monica, I know you sympathize with Michael and want to help him. But when you help him, you must first consider whether you can afford the price you have to pay for helping him!”

“Ever since we were young, I have never been as good as you when it comes to considering things. I have grown up in a happy family, and I... I really can’t think of so many things, and I don’t want to think too much about them. The only thing I can think of now is that I can help Michael. As for Finn...” Monica kept looking at him and his indifference toward her.

Throughout her phone call with Jeanne, he did not even turn around to look at her.

On the contrary, Michael, who was in the passenger seat, kept looking at her with concern.

She said, “As for Finn, even if he doesn’t understand me now, he’ll wait for me as long as he still loves me. When that day comes, everything will return to normal, and I believe we can get back together.”

“You won’t.” Jeanne was sure of her answer.

At that, Monica felt her heart ache.

“You won’t get back together. If you and Finn divorce, you will never get back together. Let’s not talk about whether you can leave Michael, but even if you do, you will never be able to get back together with Finn. The reason is simple. I don’t know how good Michael is to you, but wanting to repay him is your business. Finn has nothing to do with Michael, so he has no reason to bear the pain of someone who has nothing to do with him. If I were Finn and you really wanted to help Michael by being with him, I would choose to fulfill your wish.”

Monica held her phone tightly.

“Monica, don’t think so highly of love. Love has never been selfless. If it were, loyalty or the saying ’till death do us part’ would not exist. If Finn could watch you and Michael together, he definitely doesn’t love you. If he does, he’ll choose to let you go because you’re trampling on his feelings by doing so...”

Just as Monica was about to speak, Finn suddenly took the phone.

Monica looked at Finn saying into the phone, “Jeanne.”

“Dr. Jones?” Surprised, Jeanne paused for a moment.
