1346 Parting On Good Terms and Breaking Up In The End

If Monica wanted to break up, he would break up with her. Then, after breaking up, they started over again.

The only conflict between Monica and Finn’s relationship was that Finn did not take the initiative and that she could not feel Finn’s love for her. Only by having Finn pursue Monica again seriously and using practical actions to prove that Finn really loved Monica could that relationship be repaired.

However, the second option was risky. Once Monica fell in love with Brandon, Finn would be in trouble. Therefore, Nox still hoped to solve the problem with the first method.

“Monica left,” Finn said, but there was not much emotion in his tone.

Nox sighed. In the end, he still had too high of an expectation for Finn.

He said, “In that case, you have to keep an eye on Monica. I have to remind you that Monica is really popular now. At least half of South Hampton City’s bachelors have their eyes on Monica. You really shouldn’t be too confident.”

Finn chose to remain silent. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Forget it. I won’t hurt you. From now on, you just have to pursue Monica seriously and let Monica feel that you care about her. ” Nox said, “If you need any technical support, look for me.”

“Alright,” Finn replied.

Then, he hung up.

He was not as confident as he thought. However, he realized that he should change himself.

…

Monica moved to a new house instead of returning to the Cardellini family’s residence. She was afraid that her parents would kick up a fuss.

The last time she went back, they asked her when she would marry Finn and when they would have children.

Now that she had to tell them that she had broken up with Finn… She did not dare to imagine that scene. Therefore, it was better to find a place to lie low for now.

That new home was a high-class apartment that she had just told her secretary to buy for her. It was relatively close to Cardellini Enterprise. Anyway, as long as she had money, buying a house was easy.

She took out her things from the suitcase and organized them. She was only halfway through unpacking when her phone suddenly rang.

She looked at the caller ID and frowned.

Why was Candice looking for her? Although she was okay with the woman, she hated that sc*mbag Edward.

At that thought, that sc*mbag Edward, that *sshole Finn, and that d*uchebag Nox… Birds of a feather really did flock together. No wonder they were such great friends.

Nevertheless, she endured it and answered the call.

“Monica.” The voice on the other end was very casual.

It made Monica feel a little uneasy, like she wanted to keep a distance from Candice at that moment.

She took a deep breath. “What’s the matter?”

“I’m trying on the wedding dress now. Can you come over and help me take a look? It’s Saturday today. You shouldn’t be at work, right?” the other party asked sincerely.

Monica wanted to refuse, but for some reason, she could not reject Candice. She felt that one day, she would kill herself because of that sc*mbag Edward and Candice.

She said. “Alright.”

“I’ll give you the address.” Candice did not seem surprised by Monica’s agreement.

The conversation between them was also very natural. It was as if Monica’s answer was within her expectation.

Even Monica even felt like it was normal. For some reason, it did not feel distant.

After putting down the phone, Monica did not waste any more time and went to the address Candice had sent.

When she arrived, she saw many people waiting at the door. That was the treatment the Leader’s wife would get.

She did not know if she felt sad for Candice. However, once Candice married Edward, she would no longer have any freedom in her life. Her every move would be monitored by tens of thousands of people.

As she walked in, Candice was the only one in the large hall choosing her wedding dress.

Was that sc*mbag Edward not here?

“Monica.” Candice greeted her warmly when she saw her.

It was that feeling that made it impossible for Monica to reject Candice’s approach.

Candice held Monica’s hand naturally. Even Candice herself did not realize that her closeness to Monica was a little abnormal.

“Look at these two wedding dresses. Which one do you think looks better?” Candice asked.

Monica followed Candice’s line of sight.

To be honest, both outfits were elegant and gorgeous, and the styles were similar. It was the most modest and noble style in Harken, which was completely different from the traditional wedding dresses. However, even though they looked very high-end and noble, they lacked… the wow factor.
