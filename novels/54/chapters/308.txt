Chapter 309: Edward Agrees to Get Married

He nodded, indicating that he did not mind.

With that, Jeanne held George’s hand and walked out of the waiting room.

The group of people in black suits watched them leave the airport without stopping them.

They all took a taxi, but Jeanne took George with her while Miles took a taxi back to his apartment.

Since she was going to Fourth Master Swan’s place, she thought it was best for Miles not to be there. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Thus, she and George returned to the Swans again.

Thinking about it, she found it pretty ridiculous. She had been scheming for so long, only to return with her tail between her legs.

She held George’s hand and walked into Bamboo Garden.

When she walked in, she heard Nox’s voice shouting, “Jeanne, that fickle and cold-blooded woman, is really not worthy of you!”

Nox was right, and that was why she could accept Nox’s accusations so calmly.

Then, she brazenly and shamelessly appeared at Fourth Master Swan’s door again.

As soon as she knocked on the door, he opened it.

She said, “Fourth Master, do you want to get married?”

......

Kingsley had told her to come back and marry Fourth Master Swan.

In fact, on the way back, she had thought a lot about it and how she could get Fourth Master Swan to marry her. In the end, she figured it was better not to play tricks on someone like Fourth Master Swan. After all, she did not think she could trick him, and it was better to be straightforward — to be straightforward and tell him her purpose.

She saw the surprise in his eyes.

From the second she saw him to her saying those words, it would be strange if he were not surprised.

Therefore, she waited silently, waiting for Fourth Master Swan’s reaction.

One second.

Two seconds.

One minute.

Two minutes.

Ten minutes.

Time passed... just like that.

However, he did not say anything in the end.

Jeanne took a deep breath, intending to break the silence when the man in front of her suddenly closed the door.

It was the most obvious rejection, yet Jeanne felt as though her heart was pierced by a needle.

She pursed her lips.

If it were her, she would not agree to it either.

After all, she had humiliated him, and now she wanted to marry him? Who was she kidding?

She quietly composed herself and thought about how she could complete Kingsley’s order.

To people like Kingsley, she could never dream to leave if she did not complete the mission!

With that, she took a deep breath and turned around to leave.

However, the room door suddenly opened again.

Jeanne was stunned.

She saw Fourth Master Swan again, standing high and mighty in front of her, and heard him say, “Miss Lawrence, have you been... possessed? !”

Jeanne smiled brightly, but Edward stared at her coldly.

“No,” Jeanne answered seriously. “I just suddenly can’t bear to leave you, Fourth Master.”

“Miss Lawrence, it’s best if you’re honest.” Edward’s eyes narrowed.

Hence, it was still pretty hard to deceive Fourth Master Swan.

She said, “I’ve thought it through and realized I can’t just leave like this.”

Edward just looked straight at her as if checking to see whether she was lying or not.

She continued, “I was once bullied so badly by the Lawrences. Now that I’ve finally returned, I want to take back everything that belongs to me. If I give up halfway through, I’ll be unsatisfied.”

“Aren’t you terrified of the Sanders, Miss Lawrence?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

“Didn’t you say he could protect me?”

“Do you believe me?” Edward sneered and thought, ‘When have you ever believed me?’

“I do.” Jeanne was certain.

There was a subtle change in Edward’s expression.

He knew what she said was somewhat true, but at that moment, he was still stunned by her determination.

He kept silent.

“Fourth Master, let’s make a deal,” Jeanne said, which prompted Edward to look at her.

“If you can guarantee my safety in Harken, I will make sure the Sanders don’t harass you.” Jeanne was negotiating with him very seriously. “What do you think?”

However, Edward did not respond.

Jeanne continued, “Melody isn’t the only one in the Sanders. Since they have taken a fancy to the Swans, they will definitely think of ways to get it. If one Melody dies, thousands and thousands more of Melody’s will appear. You’re rejecting the Sanders because you have someone in your heart, right? Once we get married, the Sanders should have no reason to marry one of the Sanders to you. After all, Harken has a monogamous marriage system. No matter how dominant the Sanders is, they can’t take it that far.”

“You think it through very clearly.”

“Since you’ve been using me since the beginning, why not continue using me? My request is very simple. All you need to do is ensure the safety of me and my son, George, in Harken.” Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan and said, “After all, this will be a marriage of convenience. If you want to back out, I definitely won’t pester you.”
