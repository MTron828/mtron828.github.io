Chapter 402: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship

At least, Nox was suspicious of her, and if Nox could be suspicious of her, so could Edward.

She admitted that Edward loved her very much, but Kingsley just said that love could also come with many labels.

She took a deep breath. At that moment, she could only keep going because she did not have the ability to resist.

With that, she got up, walked into the room, and lay beside Edward. His body was visibly much more relaxed than when in the Balti Islands.

She was so close to him that she could feel his stable heartbeat.

She wondered if they would really fight each other one day.

As the night got darker and darker, the two of them slept in each other’s arms.

A night passed.

Jeanne furrowed her brows, feeling like she did not sleep well enough.

She wanted to turn over, but something seemed to be pressing down on her, and she could not move no matter how hard she tried.

She struggled in her sleep for a long time until she suddenly opened her eyes.

Only then did she see a handsome face up close before her, kissing her like glue.

“Mm.” Jeanne made a sound.

......

She finally understood why she felt like she was having sleep paralysis. It was because a “pervert” was pressing down on her. Hence, she wriggled her body around to resist.

When that man learned she was awake, he kissed her even more passionately.

That was the first thing he did when he woke up so early in the morning? Jeanne felt helpless.

Just as she thought they would get out of bed when the sun was in their faces, the man in front of her suddenly let go of her.

As they were both panting, they looked at each other.

Jeanne could feel that her lips were swollen at that moment.

She looked at Edward, who was right in front of her face, and smiled at him out of embarrassment.

Most importantly, her smile was very good-looking. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Do you like to be woken up like this, Jeannie?”

No, she did not like it because she did not want to wake up. She still wanted to sleep.

Yesterday, a certain person had slept for dozens of hours, but she had only slept for less than five hours.

“You still want to sleep for a while?” Edward looked at her expression and asked.

Jeanne simply closed her eyes.

“In that case, I’ll sleep with you for a while.”

“You should get up and go eat.” Jeanne closed her eyes and instructed him.

After all, he had slept for so long and had not eaten anything.

On the other hand, she had forced herself to eat some food on the plane, so she did not have to rush to eat for the time being.

“Are you worried about me?”

Jeanne did not answer.

“Did I scare you yesterday?” Edward asked her.

In her ear, his voice was very low.

She thought, ‘Can I please get my sleep first?’ After she had slept enough, she would talk.

However, that man had no thoughts of letting her go. He said, “If not for that, it would be difficult for me to escape from so many people.”

She did not need him to explain himself to her

“Jeannie.” Edward hugged her in her arms.

Did she not tell him to go eat?

“Every time after that state, I thought I would never wake up.” Edward whispered in her ear, “Fortunately, I woke up.”

Jeanne’s heart began to pound.

Fortunately, he woke up, but would there really be a day when he would not wake up at all?

She turned around and opened her eyes. In the end, she could not fall asleep, so she asked, “Why did you become like that?”

She was very curious, but she did not think Edward would tell her.

After all, she had a feeling that was Edward’s Achilles heel, which most people might not want others to know.

However, at that moment, Edward told her bluntly, “Because of the effects of the medicine.”

Jeanne frowned.

Medicine?

“I’ve told you that Finn is a medical genius, right? You really can’t tell from his looks that he’s a genius heart surgeon. He has developed many medicines, and the medicine that I mentioned is one of them. This medicine includes extracts of the genetic material of many large-scale beasts and some stimulants that are now well-developed in medicine. After consuming it, it will temporarily make people lose their rationality. Then, their muscles will expand, and their strength will reach the limits of a human.”

Jeanne was a little surprised to learn that such a drug existed.

Edward said, “Actually, there are a lot of things in medical research that you never imagined could be invented. It’s only because it is harmful to the body, has no health benefits, and can’t be used to save lives that the scientists have hidden them.”

Jeanne agreed.

After all, not all scientific research would be published, so no one knew how far technology or medical science had progressed.

“But why did you take this medicine?”

“To not get myself killed,” Edward replied. “At the crucial moment, to prevent myself from dying, I turned my body into one like King Kong.”
