Chapter 784: Eden’s Regret, A Tragic End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In fact, it was a no-brainer. Jake’s death was just Michael trying to silence him.

He killed Eden because he was afraid that Eden would testify against him. On the other hand, he killed Jake because Jake’s actions had been exposed, so Jake was no longer of any use to him.

Only death awaited those who were a threat or useless to him.

In the darkness, a man said respectfully, “Mr. Ross.”

“Yes.”

“It’s settled.”

“Alright.”

With that, Michael hung up.

After hanging up, he took out the SIM card from his phone and destroyed it.

Just like how he had destroyed that SIM card, Eden and Jake’s corpses were nowhere to be found.

…

Under the night sky of South Hampton City, Jeanne looked at her phone, and only endless silence greeted her.

In the end, even until the moment of Eden’s death, she did not get any useful information from him.

It made her wonder if Eden had any regrets when he died. Did he regret everything he had done in his life or regret that he was the author of his own demise?

She believed he probably did regret it, but unfortunately, he was dead. There was no use in regretting.

God was still fair. Those who were good would be rewarded, and those who were evil would be punished.

Eden only had himself to blame for his fate and did not deserve any sympathy.

Hence, Jeanne’s sadness only lasted for a few minutes as it was not worth it to be sad for a person like that.

She just felt a little sad.

She almost had it in her hands, but it slipped away.

With that, she quietly adjusted her emotions and looked up at the police station in front of her.

Nox had already driven them there.

However, Jasmine did not get out of the car.

“You’re here,” Jeanne reminded her.

Jasmine held back and looked at Jeanne. “Is Eden really dead?”

“He’s dead.” Jeanne was very certain.

Suddenly, Jasmine laughed coldly and said, “He’s finally dead.”

Jeanne had no idea what Jasmine was up to. However, she knew very well that she had no time to waste on Jasmine.

She said, “If you want to celebrate, get out of the car and celebrate by yourself. I’m very busy.”

Jasmine looked at Jeanne and asked, “Aren’t you unhappy? He treated you so badly back then. Aren’t you happy that he ended up like this?”

“It’s an expected result, so I’m not surprised, and there’s nothing to be happy about.”

“It turns out that you’re much stronger than I thought. I once wanted to kill you, but I overestimated myself,” Jasmine said faintly.

Jeanne did not react to that comment.

She had been busy the whole day, tormented by Eden’s matter, so she was tired.

She said, “Get out of the car!”

Jasmine glanced at Jeanne again. When she opened the car door, she suddenly asked, “Have you ever liked Eden?”

Jeanne frowned.

“You like him because he got close to you and made you feel loved when your mother died, right?” Jasmine asked Jeanne.

However, Jeanne no longer wanted to dwell on the past because she did not think it was worth it.

“I don’t think you’ve really liked Eden.” Jasmine said, “Otherwise, you wouldn’t have kept your distance from Eden or prevented Eden from even touching you.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She could not deny that she really did not like Eden getting close to her.

She could play with him and was very happy to do many things with him, but she just did not like Eden getting close to her.

She had always thought that it was because she believed that they would only have sex after marriage.

Yet, when she was 18 years old, she slept with Edward. Although it was for revenge, she still got close to another man.

Now, she no longer knew if she had liked Eden back then.

Did she really like Eden?

That was because her feelings were no longer with Eden, and she had completely forgotten what it felt like to be with Eden.

She turned to look at Jasmine. “What happened in the past is no longer important to me.”

“Eden liked you,” Jasmine said.

Jeanne narrowed her eyes.

“Eden had liked you from the beginning. He just couldn’t let go of his ego to please you,” Jasmine said calmly.

She did not expect she would be so calm after admitting that Eden had always liked Jeanne. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the past, she would not let herself think about it. She had been deceiving herself and making herself believe that Eden loved her.

It was probably because she was really hurt that she felt so relieved.

Jasmine said, “No matter what, thank you for saving me from Eden. So long, Jeanne.”

‘So long.’

That was probably the best ending for Jasmine, and letting go was all for the best.

Jeanne watched as the car door closed.

The Lawrences’ drama today would definitely go down in history.

Joshua was suspected of sexually assaulting the second princess of the Sanders. Not only would he be charged with attempted rape, but he would also be charged with assaulting an important figure in the country. Hence, he would be sentenced to life imprisonment or at least ten years in jail. His life was over.

As for Jenifer, she was suspected of instigating others to commit crimes, rape, cover-up, and so on. Hence, she would be sentenced to at least five years in jail. When she was released after five years, everything would have changed, and she would not be able to cause any trouble. Coupled with Joshua’s imprisonment and Jasmine’s betrayal, Jenifer’s spirit was completely defeated, and she would never be able to get back on her feet again.

The Lawrences’ cruelty would end here!

Nox drove away from the police station and sent Jeanne back to the Swan family’s manor.

He had been observing Jeanne from the start to the end and realized that she was frighteningly cold.

He could not believe that she could be so indifferent toward Eden’s death and Jasmine’s tragedy.

He even wondered if she would react the same should anything happen to Edward…

Suddenly, Nox narrowed his eyes, and Jeanne, who was sitting in the back seat, had also noticed something amiss.

“Get down!” Nox shouted.

At the same time, countless gunshots sounded from their car, and a car came straight at them.

Without thinking twice, Nox turned the steering wheel sharply and hit the guardrails at maximum speed.

At that moment, the streets of South Hampton City were filled with loud and terrifying sounds that echoed in the air!
