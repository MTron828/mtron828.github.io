1162 The War Has Started: Igniting the War

Jeanne was also trying her best to control her breathing.

She had not expected a child would suddenly appear at a time like this either. She had always been careful as she was afraid of getting pregnant, but it seemed that it was fate.

Edward had said previously that he wanted a second child. Now that she was really pregnant, she did not even know if he was happy or resentful. Perhaps he blamed her for threatening him with the child. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She lay down beside Edward.

The two remained silent, and the temperature that had just been ignited in the room was cooling down bit by bit.

Suddenly, a large pair of hands came close to her abdomen.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat. She could feel the warmth of his palm on her abdomen. It was very warm.

He asked her in a serious tone, “Three months. How big are you?”

How big was a three-month fetus?

Jeanne could not help but laugh. It turned out that even Edward, who was well-versed in everything from astronomy to geography, did not know it all.

“About nine centimeters and twenty-three grams,” Jeanne replied and gestured with her hands. “About this big.”

Edward looked at the shape of her hands and muttered, “It’s only that big.”

“Yep.” Jeanne nodded.

As she nodded, she felt his warm hands moving gently around her abdomen. It was as if he was feeling it. Where exactly was the tiny baby in her abdomen?

“Third Miss.” There was a sudden knock on the door.

Jeanne froze. Edward, however, instinctively hugged her tighter.

Mason walked toward the door. “What’s the matter?”

“To celebrate Fourth Master’s release from prison, the leader wanted to have dinner together at six in the evening.”

Mason turned to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne nodded.

“Alright,” Mason replied.

With that, the servant left.

When the door closed, Jeanne got out of bed.

Edward leaned back on the bed and looked silently at his palm. It was as if there was still a trace of an indescribable feeling left there.

“I don’t have your clothes here with me. I’ll borrow a set for you now, and I’ll have someone send your clothes over tomorrow,” Jeanne said as she walked to the door.

Once Edward replied, Jeanne left immediately to Justin’s room, with Mason following her.

“Brother,” Jeanne called out to him.

Justin opened the door.

“Sister, you were looking for me?”

“Can you lend me a set of clothes?” Jeanne asked.

“Why?” Justin seemed a little surprised.

“Edward was released from prison today and came back here with me. Father invited us to dinner tonight, and he has no other clothes. Since we can’t go to see him in pajamas, we need your help.” Jeanne smiled brightly. “You should be about the same size as Edward, so I thought to borrow them from you.”

“I have a custom-made suit that just arrived this afternoon and hasn’t been worn yet. He can have it.” Justin smiled. “I was afraid Edward would have a problem with me since I sent him to prison. It’ll be a good atonement.”

“Business is business, and private is private. Don’t think too much about it,” Jeanne consoled him. “I won’t be polite with you about that set of clothes.”

“There’s no need, sister. Come in.” Justin warmly welcomed Jeanne into his room.

After a while, Jeanne asked Mason to take Justin’s clothes and left his room.

Justin walked Jeanne out. The two seemed to have a good relationship and were even seen chatting happily together.

Such a scene was naturally being watched by many people.

In his quarters, Chester’s expression turned ugly. “Are you saying that Jeanne and Justin are very close?”

“I just saw her looking for Fourth Young Master. The two seem to be on good terms,” The subordinate reported respectfully.

What the hell was Jeanne up to?! Why was she trying to hide from him but took the initiative to get close to Justin?! What secret did she and Justin have?

…

At night, the Sanders gathered. Even Stacey, who was married, brought William back to the Sanders for dinner.

In the dining room, many sumptuous-looking dishes filled the table.

Warren said, “The country and the family have always been in a dilemma. While I must enforce the law impartially, as a father, I can’t bear to see my children suffer.”

As he spoke, he let out a sigh. “I really had no choice but to imprison you this time, Edward.”
