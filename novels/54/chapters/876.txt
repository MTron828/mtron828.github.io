However, Monica still pretended to greet her. “Happy Birthday, Auntie.”

Reese turned to look at Monica and said coldly and sarcastically, “Just a Happy Birthday?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

What else did she want?

“Monica and I have been so busy preparing for our wedding that we haven’t picked out a present for you. How about we go buy it together this weekend?” Michael tried to smooth things over.

Monica sneered. It was not that Reese wanted a present from her, but to embarrass Monica in front of everyone. Sure enough, a few wealthy ladies who surrounded Reese were all looking at Monica with disdain.

However, Monica pretended to be oblivious. Whatever Michael said was true, anyway. She was not the only one who lost face.

“Auntie.” A female voice suddenly echoed in the hall.

Monica turned her head to take a look. She looked familiar, but Monica could not seem to remember who she was.

“Auntie, Happy Birthday.” The woman was very eager. “This is your present. I hope you like it.” As she spoke, she handed over an exquisite gift box.

Reese deliberately glanced at Monica when she accepted it. Monica, of course, knew what she meant, but she continued to remain indifferent.

Reese opened the woman’s gift in front of everyone and was surprised to see an exquisite watch inside. “Brie, how did you get it? Isn’t this a limited edition? There were only eight pieces on sale in Harken. When I went to buy one, it was all sold out.”

Brie smiled. “I heard from my mother that you liked it a lot but couldn’t get your hands on it, so I got someone to buy it overseas. I’m glad you like it, Auntie.”

“You’re such a considerate child.” Reese praised her with satisfaction.

Brie smiled brightly.

“By the way, Michael. You know Brie, right?” Reese suddenly said.

“Auntie, you must be joking. Director Ross is my immediate superior now, so of course, we know each other. ” Brie appeared to be very proactive and generous. “I’ll be counting on you in the future, Director Ross.”

“That’s right. I forgot that you were also admitted to the quality supervision department.” seemed to have just remembered and said to Michael, “Take care of Brie.”

“Will do.” Michael was very obedient.

“That won’t be necessary. As long as Director Ross doesn’t despise me for not being capable enough,” Brie quickly interjected. As she spoke, she glanced at Michael.

There was no telling through the look in her eyes if she had been gazing at Michael in some other way. Monica also could not see the reason. She had been observing this woman to see if she could be the woman Jeanne was talking about.

Suddenly, she understood why Brie was so familiar. She was Michael’s subordinate and would often follow Michael to all kinds of official events, including meetings, dinner parties, and so on.

Monica gently pursed her lips, making herself look very calm.

“Don’t just stand there. Sit,” Reese said to Brie. “There’s no need to be shy.”

“Thank you, Auntie,” Brie replied with a smile and sat obediently beside her mother.

Monica was sitting on the other side of the sofa with Michael, casually watching the interaction between them.

So, Brie’s mother was on good terms with Reese? Could Brie and Michael be considered childhood sweethearts?!

“I still have some work to do. Wait for me here, but if you can’t stand it any longer, come upstairs and find me.” Michael suddenly whispered into Monica’s ear. It almost scared Monica to death.

She nodded, feeling a little guilty.

As Michael stood up and left, Brie glanced at him. Could it have been an illusion?

In the main hall, everyone but Monica was chatting and socializing. She felt so out of place. She did not know anyone, nor did she want to.

Just as she was about to leave, she saw Brie suddenly stand up from the sofa and smile at the people around her before leaving politely.

Monica watched her walk to the second floor.

Seeing her leave, Reese couldn’t help but say. “When they were young, I liked Brie so much that I even promised to betroth her to our Michael. Now that I’m looking at it, it really is a pity.” Perhaps she said it on purpose for Monica to hear.

“That’s right. I had been looking forward to Michael marrying me, but in the end, he changed his mind just like that. You have to give me an explanation and make up for my hurt feelings.” Brie angrily said on purpose.

“Alright, alright. When the time comes, I’ll introduce you to someone as talented as Michael, okay?”

“That’s a deal.”

A few wealthy ladies were chatting with each other. While it was very lively, not a single nice word had been said. From time to time, they would even mock her. So Monica stood up and left the hall, heading straight upstairs.

She was unfamiliar with the Rosses’ house, let alone the second floor. Thus, she could only bump around randomly before crashing into Michael’s room.

Inside the half-closed door, Michael was working in front of the computer. Brie stood next to him, her head close to the screen. The two of them looked very close.

However, Michael noticed her the second she appeared. Brie, noticing Michael’s change, turned to look at the door. When she saw who has there, she stood up straight and kept a distance from Michael.

“Miss Cardellini.” Brie took the initiative to call her.

Monica glanced at her, then turned to look at Michael.

“Why did you come up?” Michael’s expression did not change.

“Didn’t you say that I could come upstairs to find you if I was bored?”

“Sit here for a while, then. I’ll take you back once I’m done with the things at hand.”

Monica nodded and sat on the sofa.

“You can head out first. I know what needs to be done.” Michael’s tone towards Brie was very cold.

“Understood.” Brie smiled before leaving Michael’s room.

Monica looked at Brie’s back as she left, not showing any emotion. Then, she sat on the sofa in the room and played games on her phone to pass the time.

After about an hour, Michael seemed to have finished his work.

Just as he stood up and was about to leave with Monica, Reese pushed the door open and said to Monica bluntly, “Have you told your parents about the dowry?”

Monica really, really hated Reese.

However, at this moment, she secretly smiled to herself. She had been worried about how to uncover Reese’s vicious face that she kept hidden from others, but it had delivered itself to her door so quickly!
