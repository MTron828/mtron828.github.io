“Sarah, where’s Finn?” Monica grabbed Sarah and asked anxiously.

Sarah was startled. Why was her cousin here?

Shelly had seen Monica, but Lizzy and James had never, so they both looked at her in surprise. They did not know who the person who had suddenly appeared was.

Only Shelly secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

“Where’s Finn?” Monica did not want to waste her breath on Sarah.

All she could think about was the girl named Shelly telling her that Finn had fainted in the hotel.

She did not even think before rushing out of the room or care about her leg and injuries. She just drove and came out.

Sarah stammered.

“Sarah!” Monica was furious. “You want me to call your father and have him beat you to death, don’t you?”

“Monica, you’ve divorced Finn, so you shouldn’t care about anything related to him anymore!” Sarah was also driven into a corner. She thought about how Finn had locked her out of the room, and now that her cousin was here, how could she sleep with Finn?

“You’d better mind your own business with Finn!” Monica was even angrier. “Now, tell me. Where did you take Finn?”

“I won’t tell you!”

“Damn it!” Monica cursed.

Sarah was still a little afraid of Monica.

Although she had complained about her cousin in front of her aunt and uncle since she was young, and her cousin was often scolded because of that, she was still timid when her cousin was fierce.

She looked at her furious cousin in a daze.

When she thought that her cousin was going to throw a fit again, she watched her cousin rush to the front desk with an aggressive look on her face. “Which room is Finn in?”

The staff member was startled by the woman in front of her.

In fact, she was a little scared. “Miss, we’re not allowed to disclose information about the guest without permission. Please–”

“Slap!” Monica slapped her palm on the table in front of her, and a loud noise sounded.

The staff stood up respectfully. At that moment, she was almost scared to tears by Monica. “I’m sorry. We really can’t...”

Monica clenched her fists and knew that it was useless to force the staff to tell her which room Finn was in.

With that, she turned around and glared at Sarah, who was just standing there.

When Sarah noticed Monica’s gaze, she felt a little timid but braced herself and looked into her eyes.

“I won’t tell you!” Sarah said loudly.

Monica was on the verge of exploding in rage and looked like she was going to fight Sarah in the next second, Shelly suddenly reminded Sarah, “Sarah, if this goes on, what if Finn suffocates to death?”

Sarah’s face was pale with fear.

“Didn’t they say that if he holds it in for too long he might die? It’s been so long. We don’t even know what Finn is doing in there. What if something...” Shelly deliberately made it sound serious.

Sarah could not hold it in any longer and quickly walked to the front desk. “I just came to get a room. The room number is 2008, but I’ve been locked out. I need your spare room keycard to open the door.”

“Okay, sure.” The staff was still a little frightened as she said, “Miss, please tell me your ID card number, and I’ll check it.”

Sarah quickly told the staff her ID card number.

The staff checked it successfully and took out the room keycard. “This is the spare room card for 2008. Miss, please–”

Before the staff could tell Sarah to take it, Monica snatched it.

“Monica!” Sarah was angry and anxious.

As soon as Monica took the room keycard, she walked straight to the elevator.

Sarah, as well as Shelly, Lizzy, and James, quickly followed

Lizzy and James were both a little anxious.

From the way Sarah addressed the person in front of them, they knew that she was Finn’s ex-wife, Monica. In that case, would Finn and Sarah still be able to sleep together successfully?

Lizzy and James exchanged glances, not daring to say anything, and could only follow Monica into the elevator.

Monica swiped the room keycard in the elevator and looked at the floor number increase. She was very nervous.

Sarah was also nervous as she did not know how Finn was doing now.

What if... What if he was really dead?

No. She did not want Finn to die. She just wanted to have sex with him.

Tears welled up in her eyes as she tried not to cry out loud.
