“I want to rest by myself,” George said bluntly. He did not seem to want them to accompany him.

Edward looked at George. “If the pain is unbearable, just let me know. I’ll get someone to give you a painkiller.”

George, as stubborn as he was, did not answer.

Edward did not say much either because he knew that George did not like to show his weakness, especially in front of Candice.

“Let’s go out too and let George get some rest,” Edward said to Candice.

Candice, however, was still worried about George. She felt that the pain his body was enduring was completely different from what he was showing on the outside.

Nevertheless, she left with Edward. She figured that George did not want them to see him in a sorry state.

“Is he in pain?” Paige raised his little head and asked Edward.

Edward said, ‘Yes.”

The pain from being injured by an animal would be worse than ordinary injuries.

“What should we do?” Paige’s big eyes were filled with tears.

“Your brother will be fine soon.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

“I want him to get better soon,” Paige said sadly.

“He will get better soon.” Edward comforted Paige.

Candice listened to their conversation and looked back at George’s room from time to time. She felt heartbroken but could not express it. She had a feeling that George grew up being protected by someone, and now, he was seriously injured.

Candice followed Edward back to the living room.

After Edward comforted Paige, she picked up her phone and dialed a number.

“Finn. ”

“Fourth Master.” The other party was respectful.

“George went to the base for training this time, and his leg was scratched by a tiger. The wound is a little deep but has been treated urgently. Can you come over and take a look at George’s wound?”

“Alright, I’ll be there immediately,” Finn quickly agreed.

He was no longer a doctor to the public, but he was still Edward’s personal doctor. That was his life’s mission, and it would never change.

Then, he looked at the tall buildings in front of him. At that moment, he was at the entrance of the Cardellini Enterprise’s building.

He had accompanied Monica to work.. but from afar. For example, she was in Cardellini Enterprise’s building while he was outside.

He had gone to pick up Monica early that morning, and Monica naturally ignored him. However, he followed her around for the entire day and was now about to drive away.

Suddenly, he had an idea and called Monica, who obviously would not pick up. Hence, he sent a message over. “George is seriously injured, and I need to go over to treat him now. Do you want to come along and take a look at him?”

The next second, Monica called. George was probably the person she was most worried about in her entire life.

“How serious is it?” Monica immediately asked.

“I don’t know. All I know is that an animal scratched him. However, based on my understanding of Fourth Master, he wouldn’t have called me over if it wasn’t particularly serious.”

“I’ll be right down,” Monica said bluntly.

Then, the call was hung up.

A smile appeared on Finn’s face. He suddenly felt that George’s injury was not necessarily a bad thing. With that, he got out of the car and waited for Monica at the entrance of Cardellini Enterprise’s building.

Monica looked at him, her expression grim. However, because of George, she did not throw a fit. She walked to Finn’s side and walked with him to the car he had parked beside him but paused when she saw the exaggerated words plastered on the back of the car.

When Finn noticed her gaze, he said, “This way, the people behind won’t keep honking.”

Monica kept her mouth shut and got into the backseat while Finn got into the driver’s seat. She really felt that the words “pregnant woman onboard” pasted on the back of Finn’s car were very glaring.

Was he trying to tell the whole world that she was pregnant?

Monica told herself not to lose her temper. In any case, she would not be in Finn’s car that often. Right now, she was in it only because she was going to see George.

At the thought of George, Monica looked a little nervous.

Finn, on the contrary, was as nonchalant as ever. He was still driving at the same speed — slow.

Was he not driving quite fast when he chased her to work in the morning?

“Can you hurry up? Didn’t you say George has been seriously injured?” Monica believed she would be angered to death by Finn one day.”

“His life is not in danger..”
