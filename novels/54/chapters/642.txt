She could even bite anyone she was hugging when she was unconscious.

It was surprising that she did not lose her virginity after so many years of wandering around the nightclub.

He casually wiped it with his hands. He knew he could not wipe it off, but he still felt irritated because of what Monica left on his body.

He could still remember the scene of Michael leaving with Monica in his arms.

His throat bobbed, and his expression was cold.

After all, Monica was saving her first time for Michael.

In that case, she can give it to Michael.

He did not want it or think it was a pity either.

…

The next day, Monica crawled out of bed with a splitting headache.

Being drunk and crying was not a great combo.

Her head was about to explode, her voice was hoarse from crying, her throat was sore from swallowing, and her body was weak.

She looked at the incoming call and really wanted to smash the phone.

It was so early in the morning. Could they please just let her sleep?

As soon as she picked up the call, she snapped, “Who is it?”

The other party was a little shocked by Monica’s tone. He was stunned for two seconds before he carefully said, “Hello, Ms. Cardellini. I’m from the Orthopedics Department of Central Hospital. I’m calling you to inform you that you can come to the hospital today to remove the cast and then check on your broken bones.”

“Oh, is that so?” Monica rubbed her head.

She did think that she had lost her temper just now.

“Since you’re sleeping now, can I make an appointment for you to see your specialist doctor in the afternoon?”

“No need. I’ll come to the hospital in an hour.”

“Okay. Thank you, Ms. Cardellini.”

After that, Monica hung up the phone.

She was actually still very sleepy, but in her current state, she probably would not be able to fall asleep anytime soon.

It had been like that for a long time.

Once she woke up, she would not be able to fall asleep, no matter how hard she tried.

She endured the heaviness of her body, got up to wash up, and then went downstairs to take a taxi to Central Hospital.

She finally removed the annoying cast and took some x-rays. Then, the doctor told her that she had recovered well and that she would be able to remove the steel nails from her bones after another two months of rest. During this time, she should try her best to use her crutches to support the weight of her ankles, but occasionally taking one or two steps without it would be fine too.

Monica nodded obediently.

After seeing the doctor, Monica left because she felt that a lot of people were looking at her.

Whenever she turned her head, she thought she was hallucinating.

Then, she walked into the elevator, where quite some people were inside.

She did not know why there were so many people in the hospital either.

The moment she made her way into the elevator, she was pushed into a corner.

There were a lot of people on every floor, so Monica was squeezed deeper and deeper into the elevator. Then, she looked up and saw that Finn was also in the elevator.

Instead of wearing a white coat, he was standing beside her in casual clothes.

She was a little stunned.

Finn had come to work? Was he feeling better for him to start work?

However, she kept it to herself and did not speak.

She then thought of last night.

In fact, she did not know what happened last night.

After thinking about it carefully, she only had a few fragmented images that she could not piece together.

At that moment, two nurses came in from another floor.

One of the nurses said, “Dr. Jones came to work today. Did you see him?”

“I saw. Our company’s official group chat exploded the moment Prince Charming came in.”

Monica frowned.

Finn was their Prince Charming?

Was he so popular?

“By the way, Dr. Jones is single now.” The nurse was suddenly very excited.

“Although he is single again, I get angry whenever I think about Monica and Michael! To think Monica has been having an affair with Michael all this while. Dr. Jones and Monica were still very loving despite being injured a while ago. However, as soon as they were discharged from the hospital, Monica rushed to Michael’s embrace and said she had always liked Michael. It makes me so angry.” Another nurse felt indignant for Finn.

“That’s right. When I saw the news, I almost smashed my phone. What gives Monica the right to make such a big cuckold of our Dr. Jones and tell the entire country that Dr. Jones was her substitute!”

The nurses kept going on and on.

Monica’s grip on the crutches tightened.

At that time, she only thought of helping Michael so that Michael could get what she deserved. She did not think that her leaving Finn would have any effect on him.

Right now, she wished she could bury her head in a hole in the ground.
