Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“So you’re with me because I’m a breath of fresh air?” Brandon asked her coldly.

“Why else would I love you wholeheartedly when I know you have someone else in your heart? Brandon, this is the 21st century. Women are different from the traditional women of your impression. Now, gender equality matters, and women no longer care about whether it’S their first or hundredth time.

“It’s very popular now to test out different partners to see if they’re husband material. I can date and sleep with you today, and I can do the same with other men tomorrow. I don’t need you to take responsibility for what you did.”

“Damn it!” Brandon was so angry that he felt as if his entire body was on fire.

Sarah could really piss him off.

“If you understand it, leave now,” Sarah urged him again. “I don’t want to waste any more time with you. If I sleep any later, it won’t be good for my skin.”

“Sarah, you best remember what you said today!” Brandon gritted his teeth.

“Don’t worry, I won’t pester you anymore.” Sarah was very sure. “From now on, we’ll each live our separate lives.”

“Alright!” Brandon was so angry that he agreed immediately.

No matter what, Sarah felt a little upset. However, she could endure it, and it made her realize maybe she did not truly love Brandon. As such, the earlier it ended, the better.

“Goodbye,” Sarah said without hesitation.

With that, she closed the door abruptly. Although she did not feel sad, tears started streaming down her face. After trying to suppress it for a while, she felt that crying was meaningless. Since her relationship with Brandon had never started, so what if it ended?

In the end, she quickly adjusted her emotions and tried her best not to think about Brandon. From now on, she would live her life as she wished.

In fact, her life was really good. She returned to living the life she liked and no longer had to worry about anyone. She had dinner with his friends, drank, and hung out. Every day was very fulfilling.

She would occasionally think of him when she returned home in the dead of night, but she would not get emotional thinking about it. After all, Brandon had not appeared in front of her for the past few days or called her. It seemed like Brandon really had no feelings for her, and she understood very well that the relationship was over.

After that, she was very proactive in finding a boyfriend. Even her parents were urging her to at least have a boyfriend if she did not want to get married. Since she did not want to listen to those nagging every day, she decided to satisfy them. However… it was not easy to find a man she liked. Were all the good men taken?

She raised her head and stared at the man in front of her. She could not see him clearly, but she knew who he was.

Suddenly, she calmed down. “Since we’ve broken up, don’t hang around in front of me anymore.”

“I was wrong that day. I’m sorry.” Brandon’s voice also became much gentler. “When you sober up, I’ll explain it to you properly.”

“There’s nothing to explain. I’m fine now. Ever since I broke up with you, I’ve been having dinner with my friends, drinking, and looking at beautiful men every day. My life is great. Why did you show up in front of me and make things difficult for me?” Sarah said impatiently.

Brandon’s expression turned dark. He had been living a life worse than death the past few days after they broke up. Yet, she was having dinner, drinking, and even looking at beautiful men. What a heartless person!

He said, “Sarah, did I say that we broke up?”

Sarah was stunned, but she tried to recall in her muddled head and then quickly nodded. “I told you! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Didn’t we agree on It tnat mgnt(”

“That was you. I didn’t agree to break up.”

Sarah frowned. She clearly remembered Brandon agreeing to it.

“Your temper got the better of you that night, so you said a lot of impulsive things. And because I didn’t want to argue with you, I didn’t refute it. In fact, I didn’t agree to break up with you.”

“In that case, agree to it now.” “I won’t agree now or for the rest of my life.”

“Brandon… Ah! ” Sarah was shocked.

Shelly watched as Brandon carry Sarah away. Now knowing what to do, she instinctively wanted to grab Sarah back.

However, Benjamin suddenly grabbed Shelly. “Don’t..”
