Chapter 243: A Big Accident Happens

Monica’s calves were resting on the edge of the sofa, and her bare feet were dangling in the air.

“Don’t even think about it. I won’t go out.” Monica felt Finn approaching her, so she said confidently.

“Your dad is going to blow out the candles,” Finn said condescendingly.

‘Why would someone still do that at such an old age?

‘Wait… I was the one who strongly requested it at that time!’

As expected, she had brought this upon herself.

Monica sat up from the sofa with great difficulty, her face filled with anger.

‘Whatever.

‘I’ll just let it hurt and die.’

She reached her foot into her high heel.

“Hiss...” Before she could even wear the heel, she felt like she was going to die from the pain.

Finn looked at her exaggerated expression and said coldly, “Serves you right for wearing such high heels.”

“Yes, serves me right!” Monica glared at Finn. “Serves me right for wearing such high heels just to reduce the height difference between us!”

Finn was stunned.

“I’m f*cking 163cm while you’re 185cm. I’m like a dwarf next to you. Serves me right to try to be more compatible with you. I’m wearing a pair of 12-centimeter high heels. I deserved it!” Monica was furious.

She deserved it if it was anything related to Finn. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Monica gritted her teeth.

She decided to let the pain go and wear the heels.

At this moment, Finn suddenly squatted down and grabbed her foot.

Monica was stunned.

She saw Finn put her foot on his knee and found a few band-aids from his suit.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

Finn tore the band-aid off and stuck it on her wounded heel.

Monica did not know if it was because Finn was a doctor, but the band-aids were different from others. They looked nice and pretty.

That was why she was lost in thought at that moment.

Yes.

That was why she was lost in thought.

“The other one,” Finn reminded her.

Monica pursed her lips.

She stretched out her other foot.

Finn stuck the band-aid on her heel again.

After the band-aids were put on, Finn asked, “See if it feels better now?”

Monica glanced at Finn.

‘This man’s sudden kindness... Something must be wrong with him!’

She endured the emotional turmoil in her heart and stuck her feet into her high heels.

Miraculously, it did not hurt anymore.

When Finn saw Monica’s expression, he knew that the pain must have been relieved.

He stood up from the ground. “Alright, follow me out.”

Monica rolled her eyes.

All the good feelings she had for Finn would always be gone in the next second.

Finn wanted her to go out to socialize, which was why he went to find band-aids for her, right?!

Monica stood up and rushed out of the room. She looked very elegant.

Finn smiled and followed in Monica’s footsteps.

At the banquet, Gary blew out the candles, cut the cake, and even danced with Ruby. He kissed her in public and showed off their love

Monica watched from the side. She was envious of her parents’ love.

What kind of fate would it take to meet someone who loved each other so much?

After eating the cake, people began to leave one after another/.

The Caredellinis began to send off the guests.

Jeanne was not in a hurry to leave. She accompanied the Caredellinis until the end.

She finally sent off the last guest.

Everyone could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

It was tiring to hold a banquet.

“Jeannie, it has been hard on you tonight. I saw you helping me accompany the guests all night long,” Gary said sincerely.

Although Jeanne did not say that she would help him greet the guests, he saw what she did tonight.

Jeanne smiled. “Uncle, don’t say that. You and Aunt Ruby have watched me grow up and are just like my parents. Of course, I have to help you celebrate your birthday.”

“You’re much more sensible than Monica.” Gary suddenly glanced at Monica. “I don’t know where you went to hide halfway, but you only know how to slack off.”

Monica pursed her lips.

She wanted to remind his dad that he did not need to criticize someone else when he praised someone.

“It’s getting late, and everyone is tired. Go back and rest early.” Ruby saw that her daughter was unhappy and tried to smooth things over.

“Mm.” Gary nodded. “We’re indeed tired. Do you have a ride, Jeannie? Your dad and the others seem to have left. Do you want me to send you back first?”

“That’s not necessary. I knew that I’d go home later today, so I drove.” Jeanne smiled.

Moreover, even if she had come with the Lawrences, the Lawrences would not want her to travel with them in the same car.
