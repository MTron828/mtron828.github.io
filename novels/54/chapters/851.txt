852 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

In a damp room in the cold and gloomy basement, Lucy laid still on the ground, unmoving. She had bloodstains littered all over her body, making her look like a corpse.

Jeanne’s suppressed emotions finally exploded. “Who did this?!” Her voice filled with irrepressible anger.

The woman lying on the ground seemed to have a slight reaction to her exclamation. Melinda, who was beside Jeanne, was also a little afraid of her anger.

Before, Melinda had already become the closest person to Kingsley. Though now, she had everyone in the Delta Islands eagerly attentive and fawning over her. The only person she ever feared was Jeanne. However, as Jeanne never returned, she was content living a carefree life! What she did not expect was Jeanne to return so suddenly. So she could not help but feel tense and careful around her.

“Speak!” Jeanne’s face darkened as she glared at Melinda.

“It was Mr. Hill…” Melinda answered quickly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She did not mention that she was the one who had injured Lucy. Kingsley had only ordered her to interrogate Lucy, not torture her. However, she just could not stand Lucy.

She had always thought Lucy was dead, so it was to her surprise that she suddenly returned half a month later. Her return had seriously affected Melinda’s position by Kingsley’s side. It caused her to be in a state of unease. However, when Kingsley suddenly locked her up here, it made her secretly happy. She couldn’t wait for her to die in this place.

“Is he crazy?!” Jeanne’s voice was slightly loud.

Melinda did not dare to speak.

Lucy, who was lying on the ground, moved her body. She forced herself to slowly get up from the ground. Seeing her reaction, Jeanne hurriedly went over to support her.

As Lucy’s body was covered in so many injuries, she did not even know where to help her so that she would not be in more pain. With Jeanne’s help, Lucy leaned against the wall.

“I’ll get you out,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Monica,” Lucy called out to her.

“Why would Kingsley do this to you?” Jeanne was agitated, and overcome by it, did not bother to think deeper as to why.

Lucy’s body was so weak that she spoke in a very low voice. “Send Melinda out first.”

Jeanne nodded and turned to Melinda. “Wait for me outside.”

Melinda’s expression turned ugly.

She knew that Lucy and Jeanne were close, and she was afraid that Lucy would complain about her abusing her power. However, at that moment under Jeanne’s imposing manner, she had no choice but to just grit her teeth and leave.

Once Melinda had left, Lucy said, “Don’t blame Kingsley.”

“You’re still speaking up for him?” Jeanne was a little sarcastic.

Kingsley was indeed not a good person, and it seemed he was terrifyingly cruel to everyone other than her.

“I came back from the ancient area. I should have died, but I didn’t. So of course, Kingsley has his concerns.”

“What’s he worried about?” Jeanne asked. The next second, she suddenly thought of something. “Does he suspect that you’re in cahoots with Edward?”

Lucy nodded her head. “Edward had no reason not to kill me.”

“Yes,” Jeanne paused after every word. “There was.”

It was because of her. Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat. She had always thought that Edward had killed Lucy.

Lucy smiled faintly. “Indeed. It was because of you.”

Jeanne looked at her.

“There was another reason. I really didn’t see what the descendant of the Duncans looked like, so he spare my life,” Lucy said slowly. “However, the people of the Hills found that hard to believe. They felt that I had to have either died at the hands of Fourth Master Swan or colluded with him. From Fourth Master Swan’s perspective, regardless of whether or not I saw the Duncans’ descendant, Fourth Master Yan and I are enemies. He would never have left me alive. More importantly, under the Hills’ interrogation, I couldn’t tell them what the Duncans’ descendant looked like. So he’s certain that Fourth Master Yan and I are colluding.”

Jeanne nodded. She knew that, but Kingsley would never suspect Lucy. Even if the others did not believe her, was Kingsley that stupid?

“Kingsley also needed an explanation to give to the other members of the Hills.” Lucy continued, “His current status isn’t what we thought. He can’t do whatever he wants. His every move is being watched, like a tiger watching its prey. He can’t make any mistakes. At least, mistakes for significant people anyway.”

Lucy laughed at herself when she said that.
