1303 Monica Brings Candice to the Nightclub

However, Monica pulled her and made her dance together.

Candice was too embarrassed to dance in front of so many people. It was an environment that was too unfamiliar to her. She had probably never done it before, but Monica kept pulling her and making her dance with her.

She was blushing, but it was impossible to tell in the flickering lights amid the noisy surroundings.

She did not want to dampen Monica’s excitement, so she moved her body to the beats.

When Monica saw her dancing, a look of surprise immediately appeared on her face.

In the beginning, Candice could not relax and she was only slightly moving her body to dance.

Later on, she did not know if it was because the alcohol had started to get to her head or was it because of Monica’s influence, but she soon let herself go.

The two of them danced to their hearts’ content on the dance floor.

Many people started gathering around them. The crowd was surrounding them and gave them room to shine, making the two of them the focus of the stage.

Monica had initially thought that Candice would not know how to dance.

Human nature needed to be explored indeed.

Was she not dancing excellently now?!

The curves of her delicate body made Monica want to go forward and touch it.

She wanted to do whatever she had in mind but just as her “magic claws” were about to reach Candice…

A man suddenly appeared in front of them.

Before Monica could react, the man had already taken Candice away domineeringly.

She was carried away.

F*ck!

Did he have to be so domineering?

She even heard someone screaming beside her.

It was because the man in front of her was so handsome.

Monica could not react for a few seconds before she quickly chased after him.

Was this not that sc*mbag Edward?!

He actually came to such a place and gave up his image for Candice.

His action was so swift just now that many people probably did not react. Who was that guy?

She followed him to the entrance. Candice was carried over Edward’s shoulder.

Monica could tell that Candice was drunk. They were probably in a daze and did not know where they were.

Edward placed Candice into the black car in front of her.

Just as he was about to get into the car, he turned around and looked back.

Monica was stunned. She really wanted to disappear on the spot.

She saw nothing, really. She turned and tried to flee. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Finn won’t be home for the next few days, you should go home early.” Edward’s magnetic voice came from behind.

He did not seem very angry. He was asking her to go back earlier.

Monica halted.

So she would not be beaten to death by Edward?!

She silently turned around and saw that Edward had already gotten into the black car. At this moment, the majestic car left.

Of course, there was still one left for her.

Monica heaved a sigh of relief. She got up and prepared to get into the car and leave too.

After all, although she went all out tonight, she could no longer find the carefree happiness she once had.

Rather, all that was left after the high was indescribable loneliness.

“Monica.” A man’s voice suddenly sounded behind her.

Monica turned around and saw Brandon walking out of the nightclub. He walked up to her with his long legs.

“Are you going back?”

“Why are you here?” Monica was surprised.

“I just came back so a few friends are catching up and drinking inside.”

“Oh,” Monica replied. “Go and drink then.”

“Do you want to join us?” Brandon asked.

“No, thanks…”

“It’s been a long time since we last met. Let’s get together,” Brandon invited.

Monica hesitated for a moment.

“Don’t worry. If you don’t want to drink, I won’t let you drink. If you want to leave, I’ll send you home. I won’t make things difficult for you,” Brandon quickly said.

In fact, Monica also felt that it was only right to accept the invitation after not seeing him for so many years. Besides, they were already here at the nightclub.

It seemed a little unreasonable for her to refuse.

Monica nodded. “Okay.”

...

A bright smile suddenly appeared on Brandon’s face. It was the smile of a young and sunny boy. This was completely different from how he looked when he was at the company. He was dressed very casually tonight and looked really young.

Monica followed Brandon into the private room. There were several people in the private room, both men and women. When they saw a woman following Brandon, they could not help but jeer.

“Don’t make noise. This is my childhood friend, she’s like a sister to me,” Brandon quickly introduced.

“Why does your sister look younger than you!” a man could not help but say.

Monica seemed to have just remembered that she was dressed especially young today.

“Can’t she take good care of herself?” Brandon still looked proud.

As he spoke, he pulled Monica to the sofa and sat with her.

“Monica, do you want to drink?” A man poured a glass of wine for Monica.

“She’s not drinking. Stop being so attentive to pretty girls. Monica has a boyfriend.” Brandon was obviously very protective. It made Monica feel safe and she felt an inexplicable warmth in her heart.

She smiled. “I can drink a little. You’re all my brother’s friends, so you’re my friends too.”

“Since the girl herself has spoken, Brandon, stop talking nonsense. Come, let me raise a toast to you.”

...

Monica started drinking with the men and women inside. The atmosphere in the private room was obviously very good.

Monica could not remember how long it had been since she had drunk and had fun with a crowd like this.

All these years, she had dedicated her time and energy to her work.

“Monica, don’t drink too much.” Brandon took away her wine glass. “It’s uncomfortable to be drunk.”

Monica smiled faintly.

He probably did not know how good her alcohol tolerance was.

“I’ll help you drink.” He took her wine glass domineeringly and started fighting with his friend.

Monica did not refuse. It actually felt good to be taken care of like this.

But of course, there was a price to pay.

In the end, that drunk Brandon became her responsibility. His friends also left one after another because they were drunk.

Only she and Brandon were left. She had no choice but to help Brandon up and bring him out of the nightclub.

Monica had a hard time walking.

The man did not look fat, but why was he so heavy?

With much difficulty, she helped Brandon into the car. Panting heavily, she asked him, “Where is your house?”

Brandon seemed to have fallen asleep and did not answer.

“Brandon, where do you live?” Monica pushed him.

Brandon moved his body and slowly opened his sleepy eyes. “Monica, I want to go to your house.”

She was speechless.
