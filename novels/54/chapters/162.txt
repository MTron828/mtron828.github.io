Chapter 163: Jeanne’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Bryce was embarrassed.

He thought of how Alexander had always been mocked by him in the past. Now, he was unable to say a single word because of Jeanne.

When Alexander saw how Bryce looked, he could not help but feel great.

He had once been unable to raise his head in front of Bryce. Now, he wanted to return the favor tenfold.

Alexander was in a good mood and announced, “Today’s meeting ends here. You’re dismissed.”

After he finished speaking, he stood up and left.

The others also left one after another.

Jeanne returned to her office.

This matter had finally come to an end.

Next was the specific operation of the e-commerce project.

Once the e-commerce project could develop in Harken, then the Lawrence Enterprise’s glory would not be far away.

During this period of development, Jeanne needed to completely control the Lawrences.

Her eyes moved slightly.

She looked at a pop-up screen of a chat on the screen.

[Ed: I’m free tonight.]

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She picked up her phone from the desk and opened the chat.

When she opened it, the other party sent another message.

[Ed: Let’s have dinner together tonight.]

[Ed: I’ll wait for you at Chez Jeanne.]

Jeanne immediately quit the chat on WhatsApp.

She picked up the phone in her office. “Amy, tell Forrest to come in for a moment.”

“Yes.”

After a while, Forrest knocked on the door and entered.

“Director Lawrence, you asked for me,” Forrest said respectfully.

He sincerely admired Jeanne.

Who would have thought that there would be such a huge surprise to the incredibly difficult project?

Not only did the Lawrences manage to develop online, but the offline projects that the old fools from the Lawrence Enterprise had been planning for a few years were planned by Jeanne in three days and implemented!

Jeanne was simply god-like.

At this moment, the various major financial news outlets were all praising her.

Her reputation was great. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The construction of the logistics warehouse is going smoothly for the time being. Many of the things are routine, so there’s no need to put in too much effort. What’s more important right now is the first real operation of the online platform with MUK. Previously, due to the logistics warehouse, a lot of time was delayed. Now, we have to devote all our attention to the actual sales.”

“Understood.”

“I have a basic plan here. Take it and discuss it with the project team. We’ll have a meeting in half an hour to perfect it.”

“Understood.”

Forrest quickly took the plan and left.

Jeanne did not waste any more time and devoted herself to her work.

…

At the same time, in the Sanders’ residence.

Micheal finally saw Melody, who was being grounded.

Melody had obviously lost a lot of weight.

She looked at Micheal, and her eyes turned red.

It was probably because she felt so wronged.

Micheal comforted her, “Chief is doing this for your own good. If you really gave the order to stop Klaus’ traffic planning, the result might be a hundred times worse than this. Mel, I know that you feel very wronged, but you can’t be impulsive.”

“That’s why I’m seeing Jeanne being so smug right now!” Melody said fiercely with tears in her eyes.

She had been locked in her room for the past few days and was not allowed to go out.

Fortunately, her father was not so cruel as to even confiscate her phone. Due to that, she saw Jeanne’s glory.

“Micheal, do you think I’ll be resigned to this?! I have done so much, but in the end, not only did I not pull Jeanne down, I even let her take advantage of me... Now, the entire nation is praising her! What was our original goal? It was to destroy her reputation! Now, we’re letting her be sought after by the world!” Tears fell from Melody’s face. She was infuriated.

She was mad at Jeanne’s achievements.

After all, Melody had spent so much time planning the amusement park project to stop the development of the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse. In the end, not only did she not stop it, but she even created another business opportunity for Jeanne. Thinking of this, Melody wanted to kill Jeanne to relieve the hatred in her heart!

“Calm down,” Micheal comforted her.

Melody could not calm down.

Micheal also knew that she was not listening to him at the moment. He did not continue to persuade her and went straight to the point. “Mel, the reason I’m able to see you today is that Chief personally asked me to persuade you.”

Melody looked at Micheal in surprise.

“He didn’t want to treat you like this. It was just to give an explanation to your family’s internal affairs.”

Melody felt a little better.

When she thought about Jeanne’s glory and how she was instead grounded by her dad, whom she disappointed, she felt more twisted.

“He said that if you learn from your mistake and don’t lose your mind to do things that are detrimental to the Sanders, he won’t ground you anymore,” Micheal said.
