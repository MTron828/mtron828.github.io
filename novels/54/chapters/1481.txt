“Yes.” Teddy naturally stopped talking about Chloe.

“You can get busy with your work.”

“Yes.”

With that, Teddy left, and Candice watched the interaction between Chloe and Paige.

At that moment, Chloe also turned to look at Candice eating her breakfast. The corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile.

Candice might not even know what she was eating. She thought it was

Edward’s love for her, but if she found out the truth, she might break down. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Chloe really wanted to see that scene play out, but she told herself to be patient because now was still not the time. She would make Candice wish she was dead for stealing her man, status, and wealth!

She wanted everything back.

“Aunt, I’m done.” Paige’s young voice called out to her.

Chloe looked at Paige dotingly. “I will take you to wash your mouth, okay?”

“Alright.” Paige nodded obediently.

Chloe held Paige’s hand and left.

Candice just watched from afar without any reaction.

“Are you jealous?”

Candice turned around and saw George, who rarely came downstairs. Usually, he would stay in the bedroom and never come out. However, Teddy seemed to have carried him down just now, and she did not notice. She had to admit that Chloe did make her a little… angry.

“First, she’ll bribe Paige, me, and then my dad.” George looked at Candice. “The mistress of this place is about to change.”

Candice was speechless. ‘George, don’t you think you’re a little too mature?!’

“Anyway, my dad changes women all the time.” George said calmly, “It’s not much to change another one.”

“George, are you worried about me?” Candice grinned. Her smile was bright.

George’s face was a little red, and he was a little angry at that moment. “Are you stupid? I’m mocking you.”

“But why do I feel you’re afraid your father will dump me?”

“What am I afraid of? I can’t wait for you to leave my house. Seeing you annoys me.”

“In that case, why did you come downstairs to remind me of Chloe’s motive?” Candice raised her eyebrows.

“I-I… I just want to see you make a fool of yourself.”

“If you want to see me make a fool of myself, you can wait until I’m really made a fool of. By reminding me now, aren’t you afraid that I’ll really be made a fool

“How can you be so thick-skinned?” George gave up. He could never win against Candice.

“George, why are you so cute? Even when you’re angry, you’re cute.” Candice suddenly bent down and pinched George’s cheek.

George’s face was bright red. He thought, ‘Can this woman be more reserved? Did I allow you to touch my face? Not everyone can touch my face.’

However, although he was angry, he did not refuse. Candice pinched his face so hard that it was deformed.

When Chloe came out with Paige, she saw the interaction between Candice and George.

She had always thought that Candice and George were not on good terms. After all, George did not leave his room for the past few days, and even in his room, he ignored everyone who came. It made her think that George did not accept Candice either.

Yet, when she saw the interaction between the two of them… Somehow, she felt that George was indulging Candice.

It was not that she had never seen George before. George was a mature young man who did not smile, unlike now, when he was tortured by Candice but did not resist at all.

“George.” Chloe took the initiative to call out to George.

Candice then let go of George’s little face. Although it was not as chubby as Paige’s, it felt good to touch. She suddenly understood the happiness of a rich woman.

“Big brother.” Paige was still very close to George. She quickly shook off Chloe’s hand and ran toward George.

George, who was sitting in the wheelchair, picked Paige up. The strength of his arm was too shocking. To think that a ten-year-old child could carry the chubby Paige, who weighed at least 30 pounds, so easily. It was as easy as plucking a carrot for George.

“Wow, George, you’re so strong.” Standing at the side, Chloe was starry-eyed. It was obvious that she wanted to please George.

She knew very well that it was easy to please Paige as all she had to do was satisfy Paige’s little needs. However, George was older, and it was difficult to please him. Therefore, once she had the opportunity, she had to think of a way to show herself..
