Chapter 233: Jeanne Is Drunk

It was just that Kingsley was occasionally strict.

“Mm.” Jeanne ate the pork rib and chewed it.

It was oily but not greasy. It was delicious.

“Your mother also liked to eat pork ribs,” Kingsley suddenly said.

Jeanne paused.

Her memory of her mom had become somewhat blurry.

She only knew that her mom was amazing.

Her mom was good at everything.

She did not care about what Jeanne did. There was even a time when Jeanne did not want to go to school. Her mom said that she could do anything she wanted.

Her mom would always pat her little head and tell her, “Jeannie, as long as I’m here, you can do anything you want, and I’ll always have your back!”

Jeanne always felt that her mom was different from other moms.

Other moms always forced their children to learn this and that, but her mom only let her play.

Once, Jeanne questioned her mother because her teacher said that she would become a useless child if she continued like this.

Despite that, her mom told her, “Jeannie, you can crush a lot of people with just a little effort, but I don’t want you to be like that.”

For many years, Jeanne did not know what her mother meant by that.

It was not until she met Kingsley that she found out.

It turned out that her IQ was surprisingly high!

Her eyes moved slightly.

At this moment, Jeanne’s eyes were a little red.

Jeanne suddenly remembered that when her mother died, she was badly mutilated. It was really bad. Jeanne almost could not recognize that the person lying there was the woman who had always been energetic in front of her. She no longer remembered how hard it was for her back then, and she did not want to remember it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She silently drank the white wine.

It was too much for her to finish.

Even so, Kingsley did not try to persuade her.

He could probably feel her pain.

In actuality, he also could not forget… the death of Jeanne’s mom.

Otherwise, he would not have let Jeanne come back.

At this point, he began to doubt if letting her come back was the right choice!

During the meal, it was a little quiet.

George had always been quiet. At this moment, he could not help but tug at the corner of Kingsley’s shirt. “Is my mom unhappy?”

Kingsley patted George’s head. “Everyone has something they’re unhappy about. You’ll know when you grow up.”

“Is she unhappy because we don’t allow her to be with Fourth Master Swan?” George continued to ask.

“No!” Kingsley denied.

“Fourth Master Swan is actually not bad...”

“George.” Kingsley covered George’s small mouth. “You can’t compromise so quickly.”

George blinked and looked at Kingsley in a daze.

“Did you hear me?” Kingsley threatened.

George nodded.

Kingsley let go of him and whispered in his ear, “Your mom can only be ours. Other men can’t peep at her, so you have to keep a close eye on her. Let me know if anything happens.”

Before returning to South Hampton City, this was also what Kingsley had told him.

George thought for a moment and nodded.

Kingsley patted George’s head, “Be good and eat more. Look at how thin you are.”

George ate his meal obediently.

After the meal, it was late at night.

Jeanne had knocked herself out from drinking.

Kingsley was not surprised. Once Jeanne indulged in drinking, this would happen.

He carried Jeanne in his arms, and the others left with him.

They had just walked out of the private room when they saw Edward walking over with Nox.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

It was obvious that Edward had not come with good intentions!
