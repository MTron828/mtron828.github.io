Chapter 190: Jeanne Mocks the Lawrences

The car that Jeanne and Kingsley were in drove into the most luxurious star-rated hotel in South Hampton City.

Jeanne followed Kingsley and entered the presidential suite that Kingsley had booked for her.

She sat on the sofa in the room and took out the documents that Finn had given her.

It was worth noting that the contents of the document were very complete. Moreover, the points where there were problems were marked and annotated for her. It saved her a lot of time.

She focused on studying them.

Kingsley went to take a shower first. At this moment, he wore a hotel bathrobe and walked out. He saw Jeanne’s serious look.

“How many days until you go to court?” Kingsley asked casually.

“Five days.”

“Give me a brief account of your case,” Kingsley asked while drying his slightly long hair.

“The e-commerce cooperation platform that I negotiated with MUK is building the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse. Now, someone reported that I used a dual contract to seek personal benefits and that the profit is as high as 30 million dollars. I did participate in the tender for the construction of the logistics warehouse, and I did choose the supplier for the tender. The contract was signed by Alexander. The problem is that the construction materials used in the contract were different from the ones used in the current warehouse. The ones in the contract were all from the top brands in the country, but in reality, the materials used were from another brand. Here’s a list that you can take a look at. Finn prepared everything very well.”

Jeanne handed the list to Kingsley.

Kingsley took it and looked at it.

“I just checked. The quality of the materials of the two brands isn’t different but because of the brand effect, the prices are indeed very different. If the materials from the ordinary brand are used to build the warehouse, there’ll indeed be a huge profit margin. This private contract is the most important evidence against me.” Jeanne showed the private contract to Kingsley.

Kingsley looked at the signature. “It’s very well imitated.”

“Yes, there’s basically no way to identify the handwriting, but there’s still a loophole in this contract.”

“There’s no handprint,” Kingsley said straightforwardly.

“Yes, there’s no handprint or stamp on the signed document. In fact, there’s no legal effect in the contract. The main point is that there’s an additional 30 million dollars in my account out of thin air. This can make up for the loophole in the contract,” Jeanne said straightforwardly as if she was just analyzing a matter. It did not seem like the case had a great impact on her.

Kingsley nodded.

Jeanne continued, “Previously, there was only an anonymous report. Now, from the latest case that Finn gave me, I can see that there are two more witnesses to testify against me. The first one is the boss of the contractor that signed the contract with me. His confession clearly states that when the Lawrences’ first bid was submitted, I approached him alone. I asked him to lower the price of the project and replace the materials to obtain a higher profit. He said that he got 5 million dollars from it but most of the profit was deposited into my account.

“The second witness is an anonymous informant, who is also the chief engineer of the construction department of the warehouse construction. In his confession, he said that he only recently discovered that there are discrepancies between the materials stated in the contract and what is being used. He thought that it was the contractor’s problem, so he directly went to the contractor and asked the contractor to rebuild. However, the cost of rebuilding is too great. The contractor refused and even said that I was the instigator, threatening the engineer not to get involved and asking him to let it slide. The chief engineer said that he’s a righteous person and that he couldn’t just ignore it. He was afraid that the Lawrences would be biased because I’m a Lawrence. Therefore, after much hesitation, he chose to report me to the public prosecutor’s office.”

Kingsley listened calmly.

Jeanne finished explaining the case and looked up at Kingsley. “This is the whole case.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“In other words, although you didn’t do it, the fact that there was a dual contract for the construction of the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse is an established fact.” Kingsley hit the nail on the head.

That was right.

It was the most troublesome part of the case.

Due to that fact, it was very difficult to prove Jeanne’s innocence. Moreover, there were witnesses and physical evidence.

“It seems that she really wants to kill you,” Kingsley muttered. His tone was very soft, but one could feel his cruelty.

Jeanne nodded. “So, it’s not that I want to fight with the Sanders, but I’ve become an eyesore to Melody. To put it more bluntly, between me and Melody, either she dies or I die. I have no choice.”
