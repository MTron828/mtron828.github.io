1165 The War Has Started: Igniting the War

“You mean...” Warren could not help but shudder. “This person is in our circle?”

“It’s just my suspicion.”

“No, I think that after what you’ve said, the possibility is actually very high.” Warren’s expression changed.

If that person was really in his circle, was their every move now being watched? If he was being watched, all of their plans were simply useless.

“Father, why don’t you check the people around you?” Jeanne suggested.

“Yes, we should’ve done this long ago! We’ve been searching for the Duncans’ descendant for so long, but it didn’t cross our minds that we would have to first investigate the people around us.” Warren was a little angry.

Moreover, he did not think of that.

At that moment, he was naturally not in the mood to play chess.

“Other than five of us, everyone around us is a suspect. That includes...” Jeanne looked at Warren and said clearly, “William.”

Warren was shocked to hear William’s name because he had never considered that there would be any problems with this person.

“If there’s no problem, forget it. But if there is, it’ll be a problem. That’s why I think you should put down your pride and verify William’s DNA on the spot!”

“But… Still, I need to rely on William’s manpower and financial resources now. If we do that, I’m afraid I’ll offend him.” Warren still had his concerns.

“It’s simple. During the verification, let Chester, Justin, and Edward do it together with William. As long as everyone is treated equally, William will have nothing to say.”

Warren was overjoyed to hear Jeanne’s suggestion.

He said, “Jeannie, I’m very pleased with you. To think you can think of things that I can’t.”

“I’m just trying my best to help you and share your burdens,” Jeanne said with a smile. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Warren patted Jeanne’s shoulder in relief and asked, “When do you want to verify them?”

“The sooner the better.”

“Tonight,” Warren insisted.

Jeanne nodded in agreement. “Let me remind you to not tell anyone about what we’re going to do tonight.”

Warren frowned.

“What I mean is, don’t tell Chester and Justin either. The fewer people who know about this, the better.”

“Alright.” Warren nodded. “there’s no harm in being cautious.”

“Prepare for the worst,” Jeanne reminded him again.

Warren looked at her.

“That is to say, if William is really the Duncans’ descendant, we can’t make any mistakes and must take him down in one fell swoop!”

Warren nodded silently, thinking about what he should do next!

“Father, have you thought of a comprehensive plan?” Jeanne asked him.

“I’ll send more people to our residence tonight.”

“No.” Jeanne objected. “If that’s the case, people will be suspicious and know that you will definitely make a big move tonight. The descendant of the Duncans has been in hiding for so many years! Even the slightest clue could be discovered.”

“So, do you have any good ideas as to how we can go about it?”

“Are the assassins of the Hills still with you?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

When it came to the assassins of the Hills. Warren still felt a little ashamed. After all, he did not get his hands on them legitimately.

He explained, “If I had known that Kingsley was in such great danger, I wouldn’t have detained his assassin. The main thing was that I didn’t get any news that night. Moreover, I did have selfish motives. I was afraid that Kingsley would not listen to my arrangements, but I didn’t expect–”

“Let’s forget about the past.” Jeanne did not seem to want to talk about it. “Besides, the person who killed Kingsley was Edward.”

“As long as you don’t hate me.”

“I don’t hate you. Kingsley made it clear to me that the Hills’ mission was to help you stabilize your power. Moreover, if you don’t stabilize your power and the country is taken over by the Duncans, the Hills will be the first to be killed by the Duncans as we are the greatest contributors to your power. So, the only thing I can do now is to help you eliminate the remaining members of the Duncans.”

“Jeannie, I’m glad you understand,” Warren said with relief.

Jeanne was not used to being emotional, so she suggested, “If you believe me, you can hand over the Hills’ assassins to me.”

Warren was obviously hesitant.
