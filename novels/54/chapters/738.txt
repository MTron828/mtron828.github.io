Chapter 739: I Wish Them All The Best

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

No one noticed, but at that moment, Finn, who had always been cold, also... silently regulated his emotions.

About half an hour later, Sarah was wheeled out. By then, she was completely awake.

She saw everyone and then Finn. Seeing him, her heart still skipped a beat.

When she was met with the car accident, she thought she was dead for sure. Apart from her parents and her family, she also had regrets about Finn.

She was unwilling to end her life at her age in such a way, but fortunately, she was not dead.

When she opened her eyes and saw her family and Finn, she closed her eyes silently. While everyone gathered around her to ask about how she was feeling, she reached out and grabbed Finn’s hand.

The anesthetic had just worn off, so she did not have much strength in her hands.

Finn pursed his lips and looked down at the bruises on Sarah’s hands.

Monica had only been paying attention to Sarah. Like the others, she lowered her voice to ask about Sarah’s condition. Hence, when she saw Sarah holding Finn’s hand, she was caught off guard. Moreover, Finn did not push her away.

Monica was shocked, but she pretended not to see anything.

The nurse said the patient had to be sent to the ward, so everyone pushed Sarah along the corridor outside the operating theater.

Only then did Sarah’s hand leave Finn’s hand.

Monica turned around to take a look.

She saw Finn standing there and did not seem to have any intention of accompanying her.

In the ward, Sarah quickly settled down and was put on an IV drip.

Ever since Sarah came out of the operating theatre, she was surrounded by noise.

“Sarah, why did you run a red light? Don’t you look where you’re going? Fortunately, the other driver wasn’t going fast. Otherwise, do you think you’ll be seeing us right now?”

“That’s right. How can you make us worry? It was a red light. Didn’t you see it? If anything were to happen to you, how are your mother and I supposed to live?”

“You must be careful next time.”

“Why did you go to Lambert Road? Do you have a classmate who lives there?” asked Sarah’s mother, Yvonne Taylors.

Monica, who had been sitting on the side, acting like she had nothing to do, suddenly paused.

Lambert Road…

She knew very well that it was where Finn was living now.

“I heard you were crying when you got into the car accident. Did you quarrel with your classmate?” Yvonne asked again.

“Mom.” Sarah was finally a little impatient. “Can’t you let me rest for a while? The doctor said I have to rest. However, you keep talking non-stop, and my head is about to explode. It hurts so bad.”

“Where does it hurt? Where does it hurt?” Ruby said agitatedly.

“Just don’t talk to me. Let me rest quietly for a while, okay?” Sarah could not take it anymore.

Ruby held her tongue and did not say anything more.

Everyone stayed with her quietly.

“By the way, where’s Finn?” Ruby suddenly asked, “He was here just now. Where did he go?”

At that moment, Sarah, who had her eyes closed, opened her eyes when she heard his name.

Monica was peeling an apple for herself at that moment.

The premium ward was fully equipt. However, Sarah had just moved into the ward, and the nurses were busy, so they could not help Monica with peeling the apple. She had nothing to do or was intentionally distracting herself, so she chose to do it herself for the first time. She peeled it until it was beyond recognition.

At that moment, she even cut her finger. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It hurt, but Monica gritted her teeth and covered the wound with a napkin to stop the bleeding.

“I’ll call him to ask,” Gary quickly said.

Sarah looked in her uncle’s direction and gently bit her lip, not saying anything.

At the thought that Finn did not reject her just now, she controlled her heartbeat and tried to listen to her uncle’s call to Finn.

After the call ended, Gary said, “Finn, can you follow up with Sarah’s treatment and come over later?”

“Finn is such a kind person.” Ruby could not help but sigh.

At that moment, she even looked at Monica and was clearly a little... disappointed.

However, Monica pretended not to see it.

She felt that her self-control was quite strong recently.

Ever since she slept with Finn and was almost strangled to death by him, she seemed to have learned... how to control her emotions.

“Will Finn come over?” Sarah asked.
