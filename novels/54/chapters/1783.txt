Chapter 1784: A Forced Relationship Won’t Last

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Shelly left Sarah’s house, she went straight to Bella’s kindergarten. As it was about time she made her way over, she took the bus there.

In fact, it had been a long time since she had taken a bus. Bella’s kindergarten was so close to home that they could walk there, and since she rarely went to other places, she would take a taxi sometimes when she had to. However, she thought she would take the bus today since she was a little early.

She looked at the scenery of South Hampton City outside the window. If Nox did not go back on his word, in less than a month, she would leave Nox and go back to living her original life with Bella.

Suddenly, she felt somewhat emotional. She could not seem to pinpoint if it was because she was so happy that she was feeling sad.

After the bus arrived at Bella’s kindergarten, Shelly waited for a while before Bella walked out with her small school bag and jumped into Shelly’s arms excitedly. “Mommy.”

Shelly smiled at Bella and patted Bella’s head lovingly. She said to Bella, “Are you happy at school?”

“Yes, I have a lot of friends to play with.” Bella hurriedly nodded and even talked non-stop about what happened at school.

At some point in time, Bella had become much more lively and cheerful. She was no longer as self-abased and introverted as before. Shelly thought about it carefully and realized that ever since Nox accompanied her to the sports day, Bella seemed to have changed completely.

At that thought, Shelly sighed and held Bella’s hand as they went back.

When they passed by the newly opened chicken shop outside the school, Bella got a little greedy. “Mommy, I want fried chicken.”

“Bella, you can have fried chicken once in a while, but eating it too often isn’t good for you, and it can affect your growth.”

“But Mom, I haven’t had it for a long time. I really want some fried chicken and fries,” Bella said pitifully.

Shelly hesitated. Bella had never made any requests of her since she was young, and most of the time, her heart would ache because of how sensible Bella was. Now, seeing Bella’s expectant gaze, she finally gave in.

She said, “I can take you out to have fried chicken, but you have to promise me that if you eat it today, you won’t ask for more tomorrow. You can’t have fried chicken every day. It’s not good for little kids like you. ”

“I promise you that I won’t ask for it tomorrow.” Bella nodded, looking very serious.

Shelly was amused by her, and they walked into the chicken shop hand in hand. After the two of them ate slowly, Bella would usually play in the children’s area of the chicken shop for a while. During that time, Shelly would sit in the shop, look at her phone, and quietly accompany Bella.

At around 7 p.m., Shelly called Bella back. As Bella had to go to kindergarten tomorrow, she could not stay out for too long. Besides, after all these years, Bella had developed the habit of going to bed early and waking up early.

Daddy.”

Shelly was stunned. At that moment, she remembered Nox asking her if she would be back for dinner tonight and she casually said she would, not expecting Bella to request to have fried chicken.

She felt a little guilty about that, but on second thought, Nox did not call her either. Hence, he probably knew how to settle dinner himself. With that in mind, she returned home with Bella.

At home, Nox was alone, watching TV in the living room.

Seeing that Shelly and Bella had returned, he casually asked, “Have you eaten dinner?”

“We have.” Shelly said, “Bella wanted to have fried chicken, and there was a restaurant not far from the kindergarten, so I brought Bella to have dinner.”

‘Yes,” Nox replied without much emotion.

Shelly wondered whether it was all her imagination, but it seemed like Nox had not lost his temper in a long time. Logically speaking, it was abnormal for a hot-tempered man like Nox to not have a temper!

“Have you eaten?” Shelly asked him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes,” Nox said lightly.

“That’s good.” Shelly seemed relieved. She was really afraid that Nox was waiting for her to have dinner.

After that, she added, “In that case, I’ll take Bella to her room to wash up.”

Nox nodded again, and Shelly brought Bella into Bei’s room. Then, Nox stood up from the sofa, walked into the kitchen, poured all the food that he had made tonight into the sink, and cleaned up all the food that he had cooked for the entire afternoon..
