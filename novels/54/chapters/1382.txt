1383 Getting Along and George’s Rejection

Paige’s body was covered in foam as she threw himself into Edward’s embrace.

As she cried, she said, “Mommy was bullied. Boohoo. Mommy was bullied by a big bad guy. Boohoo…”

She was crying so hard that she was heaving.

Edward wrapped the towel around Paige’s small body and coaxed her gently, “There’s no big bad guy? Daddy has chased away the big bad guy a long time ago.”

“In that case, can you explain why Mom’s body is covered in bruises? They’re all injuries.” Paige pointed at the marks on Candice’s body.

Coincidentally, there was one on her shoulder, and it was very obvious.

Edward saw it immediately and understood that the big bad guy that Paige was talking about was himself. Hence, when his eyes met Candice’s, he felt a little embarrassed.

Then, he carried Paige out of the bathroom and coaxed her as he carried her away. Gradually, Candice could hear their voices getting further and further away.

She did not know how Edward coaxed Paige, but she did not waste any more time and planned to take a shower earlier.

Just as she had finished showering, the bathroom door was pushed open again. Candice happened to be standing in the bathtub at the moment, preparing to come out, when… it became awkward.

At the same time, a certain someone started to take off his clothes.

Candice shrieked and retreated back into the bathtub. She looked at Edward’s actions and asked nervously, “What are you doing?”

“I’m taking a shower,” a certain someone said matter-of-factly.

“Y-Y-Y-You… You’re taking a bath here?”

“Why else would I take off my clothes?”

“Wait for me to be done.”

“When you’re done, I won’t need to shower.”

‘What a pervert!” Candice thought to herself, but she asked, “Where’s Paige?”

Candice quickly found a topic to talk about.

“She’s fine. Paula is sleeping with Paige now.”

“How did you explain to her about the big bad guy?”

“Of course…” Edward’s tall body leaned closer to Candice. “I told her the truth.”

“Oh.”

Candice really thought that no one could match how flirtatious Edward was. The well-dressed man she usually saw on television… Well, she was blind before.

After the two of them came out of the shower, Candice was a little thirsty and wanted to go downstairs to get some water.

“I’ll get it for you.” Edward pulled her back.

“No need. You should sleep early.” Candice did not allow him to get up. “You’re starting work tomorrow, so you should sleep early. I’ll go downstairs myself and see Paige on the way.”

Her heart still ached when she recalled Paige crying so sadly just now, and she did not know how Edward managed to coax Paige.

With that, he walked out of the room and went to pour herself a glass of water first. Then, she walked into Paige’s room.

Paige had her own little princess bed, and there was another bed next to it, where Paula slept.

The moment Paula saw Candice, she quickly got up.

“Paula, go to sleep. I’m just checking on Paige,” Candice quickly said.

“Alright, alright,” Puala quickly replied respectfully.

Candice walked to Paige’s bedside.

She looked at Paige’s chubby, red face and saw her hugging a little white rabbit as she slept soundly. Her heart would melt because of Paige. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She lowered her head and kissed Paige’s forehead before touching her smooth and tender face again.

Paige seemed to be having a good dream because, at that moment, she even grinned. It was so cute that Candice stared at Paige for a long time.

After a while, George’s figure suddenly appeared in her mind. Hence, she smoothened the covers for Paige, walked out of Paige’s room, and gently closed the door behind her.

Then, Candice hesitated for a moment before turning around and walking to the room next door.

Just as she walked over, the door suddenly opened. It was not Paige who came out but Teddy, who looked at Candice in surprise.

Teddy was about to call out to her when Candice made a gesture to stop him from speaking. He understood and closed George’s door.

The moment he closed the door, she could see George sitting at his desk, studying.

George was only 10 years old, and it was past 10 p.m. Did he need to work so hard?

Candice and Teddy walked to the side.

“Madam, what’s the matter?” Teddy said respectfully.

“Does George study like this every day?” Candice asked.

“Yes, Young Master George has a lot to learn, so he goes to bed very late almost every night.”

“Won’t it affect his growth and development?”

“Young Master George’s growth and development will be checked regularly by experts. Nothing will go wrong.”

Nothing would go wrong? Who would treat their son like that? He was like a machine.

As if he had read Candice’s mind, Teddy said, “Fourth Master has his own difficulties too.”

Of course, Candice knew about it. She just could not accept it emotionally.

“It’s getting late. Madam, you should rest early,” Teddy said respectfully.

The moment Candice was about to leave, Teddy said, “Oh right, Madam. There’s a parent-teacher conference at Young Master George’s school tomorrow. It’s around 10 a.m. and it’ll probably last until 12 p.m. I might not be around during that time, so if there’s anything, you can call me.”

Therefore, had Teddy been attending George’s parent-teacher conference?
