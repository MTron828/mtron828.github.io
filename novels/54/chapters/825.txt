Chapter 826: Jeanne’s Soft Spot for Edward

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He dodged the bullet and carefully hid behind the helicopter.

Instantly, the sound of guns and bullets rang out around them.

His men should not be able to hold on for long. If Nox did not come to his aid, he could not guarantee that he could successfully rescue the Fourth Master.

Moreover, they all might get killed.

Finn held his breath and listened to the sound of footsteps approaching him. Then, he raised his gun and focused.

Three, two, one…

Finn leaned out and raised his gun, ready to shoot, but he saw a figure. The moment he was about to fire, he hesitated for a second, and that was all it took for the man beside him to kick the gun in his hand away.

At the same time, Finn shackled the hand of the man next to him who was shooting at him. As soon as the bullet burst out, it was aimed at the sky, and in the next second, the two of them began to fight fiercely.

The sound of gunshots around them continued.

The fight between Finn and the man in front of him was fatal, crazy, and intense.

That chaos went on for about 20 minutes, and Finn managed to hold on until his troops were completely wiped out.

A cold male voice rang out beside Finn, who was frantically fighting. “To be able to find me so quickly, the people around Fourth Master Swan are smarter than I thought!”

Finn’s heart skipped a beat, and he turned his head.

The second he pretended to panic, he was kicked away by the man who was fighting with him.

The moment he was kicked out, everyone around him let their guard down, and Finn took advantage of the situation to roll directly to the side of the helicopter, dodging the line of people in front of him.

He calmed himself down. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Then, he found the pistol in the hand of the assassin who he had killed. He held it tightly in his hand and remained vigilant.

“Are you sure you don’t want to come out?” Kingsley asked coldly from a distance.

Finn’s body was tense, and he was sweating profusely.

He knew that regardless of whether he could get out or not, he would die in less than five minutes, and his only chance of survival was if Nox rescued him.

With that, he grabbed the gun and kept calm.

“I’ll count to three.” Kingsley threatened, “If you don’t come out, your corpse will remain intact.”

Kingsley meant that if Finn revealed himself, his corpse would be kept whole.

Finn’s forehead was drenched in sweat.

In the dark, he could hear the countdown that sounded like hell. “Three, two, one.”

Finn appeared and stood in front of them with his hands raised, surrendering.

Kingsley looked at Finn coldly, and after fixing his eyes on him for a while, he said with certainty, “Finn.”

He was trying to confirm Finn’s identity.

“Yes,” Finn responded.

“I didn’t expect Fourth Master Swan to have so many talented people by his side. To think you managed to chase me here and arrive before me.” Kingsley was truly surprised.

When they first arrived, he did not think they would be ambushed, and that was why he lost two of his assassins.

The trip this time was more disastrous than he had expected.

He looked at Finn with a murderous gaze.

“Thank you for your praise.”

“It’s not a compliment. It’s just a pity,” Kingsley’s voice was cold. “It’s a pity that such a talented person is about to die.”

“Before I die, I want to see the Fourth Master.” Finn made a request.

Kingsley sneered. “Why should I do what you say?”

“Jeanne,” Finn called out to Jeanne, who had been silent beside Kingsley.

She did not join in the fight, but if she had joined just now, she could have killed Finn with a single shot when he was fighting with an assassin. However, she did not. She just watched indifferently as they fought.

That made Finn feel that Jeanne might still sympathize with the Fourth Master. She knew very well that once Finn died, their plan to save the Fourth Master would fail completely.

Hence, she left some leeway.

Unfortunately, Kingsley’s men were too strong. Before Finn could attempt to try to save Fourth Master, he failed.

He looked at Jeanne, asking for her help.

He knew that Kingsley had no reason to satisfy him, but Jeanne could. If Jeanne still cared about their old friendship, she could do it.

However, Jeanne did not say anything.

She looked at him without a word and did not say anything.

Finn gritted his teeth. “From as soon as I can remember, my mission has always been to protect Fourth Master Swan. So, my wish before I die is that at least Fourth Master Swan is alive.”
