When the door to Monica’s ward was pushed open, Monica thought it was Brandon. However, when she saw Finn, her expression changed.

Even if Finn wanted to ignore the displeasure in her eyes, it was hard for him to do so. Still, he chose to ignore it as he walked to Monica’s ward and sat beside her.

“Where’s Brandon?” Monica asked him.

“He left,” Finn replied.

Monica was speechless. Brandon, that brat, said he would help her raise her children just a second ago, and now, he was gone!

Silence filled the ward again. When did they go from him not talking to the two of them not talking at all?

Perhaps Monica did not want to talk to him on purpose. However, Monica’s drastic change did not attract any attention from him. It served him right that they had become like that.

Finn thought about it calmly and suppressed his emotions before saying, “The doctor said it’s twins.”

Monica just looked at him. Of course, she knew why Finn had come. “I don’t need you to take responsibility.”

“It’s not about taking responsibility.” Finn said, “The children are mine. I should be by their side as they grow up.”

“Finn, we broke up.” Monica reminded him.

She knew that although they had broken up, Finn would still show up because of those two children.

“I never agreed.”

“Didn’t I make myself clear to you last time?” “I understand, but I didn’t agree,” Finn said firmly.

Monica was suppressing her anger.

“The doctor said that your morning sickness is very serious. Get some sleep. I’ll stay with you.” “I don’t need your company.” “The babies want it.”

“Finn…”

“Go to sleep.” Finn’s slender fingers caressed her hair as he said, “Don’t make yourself suffer.”

She had never thought of making herself suffer. She just wanted to make Finn suffer.

With that, Monica turned around, her back facing Finn. Her indifference and rejection of Finn were obvious.

Finn did not react to her behavior. He just sat there silently and accompanied her without saying a word.

Monica originally thought that she would not be able to sleep with Finn around. She did not want to talk nonsense with him, so she chose to keep a distance from him in that way. Unexpectedly, she fell asleep.

She did not know if it was because she did not sleep much overseas or because she was pregnant, but even if her stomach felt uncomfortable, she fell asleep in the end.

Soon, the sound of even breathing could be heard. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Monica was really asleep, Finn finally dared to get close to her.

His slender fingers held Monica’s hand which was free and gently wrapped her palm in his. At that moment, it was as if his heart was trembling and he was holding the entire world.

The ward was very quiet. Monica was sleeping the entire time, while Finn just sat by the side to accompany her.

Monica did not know how long she had slept. Anyway, when she woke up, she felt like an eternity had passed all because she had a nightmare.

She dreamt that she chose to have a miscarriage and was lying on the operating table. She dreamt that the doctor had taken the child away from her and that the child was crying. The sad cries made her break down…

“No, no… I won’t abort them! I won’t abort them… Let me go. Give me back my children. Give them back to me… Ah!” Monica suddenly opened her eyes.

At that moment, she felt as if she was lying in a warm and familiar embrace.

Monica stared blankly in front of her. Her mind was still filled with a bloody and cruel scene from her dream, and she could not calm down.

“It’s okay. It’s just a nightmare.” Someone was comforting her, and his gentle voice was filled with affection.

It made Monica wonder whether she was still dreaming. If it were not a dream, how could Finn have changed so much?

She forced herself to calm down, and once she was of sound mind again, she pushed Finn away. “Why are you still here?” Finn’s sadness flashed on his face. He said, “I will always be by your side.”

“I said I don’t want it!”

“I’ll stay with the kids.”

Finn, are you really going to force me to do something extreme?” Monica asked him fiercely.

Then, she instantly recalled the scene from her dream..
