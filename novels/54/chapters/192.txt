Chapter 193: Jeanne Backs Her Team and Finds the Key to Her Case

Joshua was threatened by Jeanne.

He was displeased, but seeing how furious Jeanne was, he still got someone to tidy up her office. He also got someone to call the people on her project team and Amy back.

After Jeanne’s office was tidied up and everyone had returned, she said to Joshua word by word, “Before I really go to jail, I advise you not to touch any of my things!”

Joshua gritted his teeth.

He glared fiercely at Jeanne, feeling very sullen but unable to resist.

Jeanne left.

Joshua could not help but want to call Eden. Only then did he know that Jeanne had smashed his phone into pieces.

He gritted his teeth.

He wanted to see how long Jeanne could act like this!

…

Jeanne returned to her clean office and sat on the chair. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Amy appeared in front of her.

“Call the project team for a short meeting.”

“Understood,” Amy quickly responded. She could not help but feel a little worried. “Director Lawrence, your case...”

“We’ll talk about it after the meeting.”

“Understood.”

Amy left respectfully.

After a while, Jeanne appeared in the meeting room.

Everyone on the project team looked at her.

These people were the only people she trusted in the Lawrence Enterprise.

She said bluntly, “Today, I won’t talk about work matters. I’ll mainly talk about my current situation.

“Director Lawrence, were you wronged?” Mandy could not help but feel a little agitated.

“Yes, so I’m now looking for evidence to clear my name. I originally just wanted to come to the company to take a look at the contracts. I didn’t expect Joshua to go to this extent.”

“He did more than these!” Forrest gritted his teeth. “After you were taken away by the prosecutors, he made your office a warehouse. Amy stepped forward to stop him, but Joshua scolded her in front of everyone in the marketing department.”

Jeanne glanced at Amy.

Amy lowered her head in embarrassment.

“Amy cried when she was scolded, but he even made her work as a warehouse clerk. No matter what, Amy graduated from a famous university and studied to be a senior administrative secretary. How could she be sent to such a place?!” Forrest became angrier as he spoke.

Jeanne’s eyes were cold, and her face was dark.

Forrest continued, “Amy was only Joshua’s first target. After that, it was our project team. When we were working with you, Joshua came to each of us and asked us to be his informants. He even said that he’d give us a raise and a promotion, but we all refused. He took revenge on us when he saw that you were in trouble. First, he disbanded the project team and told the public that it was a place for idlers. Then, he transferred us to the worst department of the Lawrence Enterprise one by one. For example, Mandy was transferred to the front desk to serve tea and water. Hans was transferred to drive for the sales department...”

Forrest was filled with righteous indignation. At this moment, he wanted to give Joshua a good beating.

“I almost resigned,” Hans said, “When it happened, I felt that I didn’t have any dignity in the Lawrence Enterprise. Fortunately, Forrest persuaded me to wait for you. If you can’t come back, we wouldn’t have any lingering feelings for the Lawrence Enterprise, so we wanted to resign and leave. However, Forrest said that you’d definitely come back.”

“I’ll come back!” Jeanne looked at everyone on her project team and was very sure. “I’ll clear my name and come back.”

“We believe in you!” Everyone on the project team expressed their stance.

Jeanne nodded and was not too emotional, but she was straightforward. “I’ve threatened Joshua just now. At least before I’m sentenced, he won’t dare to do anything to you! Don’t worry and just do what you’re doing. While I’m away, keep a close eye on the current project for the logistics warehouse.”

This was also why she had such a big reaction after Joshua moved her office and her people.

Other than to threaten Joshua not to touch her team again, it was also to show everyone in the marketing department and even the company that even he could not touch her people, let alone the others who wanted to see the joke.

It was so that the people on the project team would not be wronged!

“Okay.” The people on the project team were all obedient.

“Even if I really can’t come back, I’ll compensate you so that you can leave the Lawrence Enterprise without any worries.”

“Director Lawrence, we didn’t stay here to ask you for benefits. We also want to fight for ourselves. We believe that you’ll never do anything illegal!” Mandy was a little agitated.
