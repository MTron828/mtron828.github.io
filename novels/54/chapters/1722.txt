Chapter 1723: Monica Goes Into Labor

After Nox’s assistant picked him up, Shelly cleaned up at home and boiled some water again.

For some reason, her mind was filled with the image of Nox reaching out to help her with the water just now. Then, she pursed her lips and stopped herself from overthinking it.

At the thought of the one-year deadline that Mrs. Winter had mentioned, she looked forward to it even more. However, she also wondered if it was because of the one-year deadline that she did not resist Nox so much. After all, it was only one year.

When Nox returned, Shelly was already asleep, so Nox carefully returned to the room and went to bed. The burn on Nox’s hand was pretty serious, so the doctor wrapped it up like a ball. Although it was no longer swelling and blistering, he could not touch Shelly.

Just like that, he stared at the ceiling melancholically, wondering whether he could expect anything in the one-year deadline he gave himself.

The days seemed to have returned to normal since Shelly and Nox were no longer giving each other the silent treatment. Their lives were still the same, with nothing much happening. All in all, there was no progress in their relationship.

One day, Nox had just returned home from work that day when he suddenly received a call from Jeanne and was flattered by it. For some reason, he felt that Jeanne was superior to him because, in his mind, a woman who could capture Edward’s heart was no simple person.

“Nox, where are you?” Jeanne asked anxiously.

“I’m at home. I just got off work. What’s wrong? Are you buying me a drink tonight?” Nox asked casually.

“Damn it. Monica is in labor!”

“What?!” Nox was also shocked. “It’s only been a few months, and she’s already in labor?”

“It’s been nine months,” Jeanne said. “And since it’s twins, they usually come a little earlier. I’m going to the hospital now, so you should hurry over too. I’m afraid Monica will be nervous.”

“Oh, okay, I’ll be right there!” Nox quickly hung up the phone. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, he was still mumbling to himself, “How is Monica in labor so soon? She was walking fine the last time I saw her!”

Nox was excited as well.

“Nox, did you say that Monica is in labor?” Shelly asked.

“That was what Jeanne told me on the phone just now. I didn’t ask for the details, but I’m going to the hospital now.” Nox quickly said, “I won’t be home for dinner tonight.”

“Can I go with you?” Shelly suddenly asked.

“Do you want to?” Nox was surprised.

Shelly nodded. She just really wanted to see Monica.

“Sure. What about Bella?” Nox asked. “Can I bring Bella along?”

“Alright.” Nox agreed immediately.

His reply put a bright smile on Shelly’s face.

Nox was a little lost in thought as he stared at her smile. The moment he came back to his senses, he could not help but curse, ‘F*ck. Even Monica can make Shelly so happy.’

With that, Shelly quickly carried Bella and left in Nox’s car. Shelly and Bella sat

in the backseat while Nox drove a little faster than usual.

As he drove, he said to Shelly, “I didn’t expect Monica to go into labor so soon. She was the one who didn’t want the children at first, and Finn was panicking. Fortunately, Monica’s heart softened in the end.”

“Based on my understanding of Monica, she probably couldn’t bear to abort the babies.”

“Who knows? Monica can be heartless sometimes too.” Nox commented, “If she were cruel enough to abort the children back then, Finn would’ve been devastated. You have no idea how badly he wants children.”

Shelly nodded and suddenly thought of Mrs. Winter, who wanted grandchildren so badly that she went crazy.

Having noticed Shelly’s sudden silence, Nox did not say anything else either. Soon, they arrived at the hospital and entered the delivery room.

When Nox showed up with Shelly, there were already quite a few people in the delivery room corridor, including Monica’s parents, Sarah, Edward, Jeanne, and Monica’s subordinate, Brandon. As they walked over, they added to the crowd, and Monica’s shouts could be vaguely heard in the corridor. Nox quickly asked, “How is it? Has she given birth?”

“Do you think we’ll be standing here if she has?” Jeanne asked, a little speechless.

Nox rolled his eyes.

“Is this Shelly?” Jeanne asked Nox..
