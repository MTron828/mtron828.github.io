Chapter 413: Fourth Master Swan Is Jealous

In the senior management’s meeting room in Lawrence Enterprise, everyone looked at Jeanne as she walked in.

Alexander’s expression was especially unpleasant.

He said to Jeanne, “The e-commerce project we invested in hasn’t made any progress so far. We’ve spent so much effort and invested so much money into it, but it hasn’t shown any results at all. We were proud to have received this project at first but look at us now. We’ve achieved nothing!”

Jeanne frowned.

She had only left for a week. What had happened to cause Alexander to fly into a rage?

Jeanne thought for a moment and asked, “The results for the first phase of the pilot marketing weren’t good?”

“Results weren’t good?” Alexander’s expression became even uglier as he shouted, “There was no result at all! We invested 20 million to do this pilot marketing, but in the end, we only sold less than 3 million dollars worth of products! If we go on like this, we will lose 1.7 billion from the 2.1 billion we invested!”

Right after Alexander said that, an uproar started among the other senior management leaders.

A loss of 1.7 billion would make Lawrence Enterprise bankrupt! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although Lawrence Enterprise’s market value was over 10 billion dollars, if they lost so much on one project, it would naturally implicate the other projects. In addition, if the stock market fluctuated…

Lawrence Enterprise might not be able to hold on for long.

“This won’t do!” The director of the finance department, Bryce, was getting flustered. “The Lawrence Enterprise’s finances are already very tight. If we lose so much more, it’ll put the company in a critical situation. President Lawrence, as the executive general manager, you have to think of a way to deal with this matter.”

“That’s right. We’ve been with Lawrence Enterprise for so many years. You can’t just let the company go bankrupt and send us home! I still have the original shares of Lawrence Enterprise!” The director of the general affairs department, Winston, was also agitated.

......

All the senior management leaders present were also on edge.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Before she got married, she had already made arrangements for the pilot project. According to the market estimates, it was impossible to have only a turnover of 3 million dollars. She estimated it would be at least 50 million, but the gap was so big that she believed there was more to it than a competitive market.

Her silence made Alexander even more furious.

He said, “Jeanne, you’re responsible for this project. If the losses of this project are serious, you’ll have to take full responsibility!”

“How do you want me to take responsibility, general manager?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

She did not want to comment too much on the project before she understood the truth of the matter.

“You will personally subsidize whatever we lose!” Alexander made sure to enunciate each word.

Jeanne sneered at how ridiculous she found Alexander.

Before she could speak, the others echoed, “That’s right. If this project fails, Jeanne should make up for it with her own money! She should take responsibility for what she does instead of making us all suffer as well!”

“That’s right.” Bryce’s tone was firm. “Isn’t Jeanne rich? You have more than 50 billion, so 2 or 3 billion dollars should be just a drop in the ocean? I believe that for the sake of Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne shouldn’t care about that little bit of money.”

“Moreover, Jeanne is now married to Fourth Master Swan, who’s in charge of all the Swans’ assets. The Swans’ assets are in the hundreds of billions, so that little bit of money is even less of a problem.”

In an instant, everyone started to talk about Jeanne forking out her money as if it was a matter of course.

Jeanne looked at these people indifferently. The more she looked at them, the more excited she became.

Then, she opened her mouth and said, “My money, the Swans’ money… They all grow on trees, huh?”

Everyone looked at Jeanne.

“I haven’t seen any company that made a mistake in their marketing decision but wants an individual to compensate for it. I don’t think Harken has such a law!”

The sarcasm in her tone made everyone’s expressions turn a little ugly.

Alexander said coldly, “You’re in charge of this project. Now that the project has failed to reach its target, shouldn’t you be responsible?”

“I am.” Jeanne nodded. “But isn’t everyone responsible? This project was approved during the decision-making meeting, which means it represents the company’s decision. I’m only in charge of executing it. Whether it was executed well or not is my responsibility. If you think I’m not executing it well, you can fire me. However, the policy guidelines are set by the company. In the end, the company is responsible for the profits and losses of this project, and I will not take out a single cent!”

“Jeanne!” Alexander slammed his hands on the desk.
