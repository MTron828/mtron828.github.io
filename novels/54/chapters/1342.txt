1343 Monica, I Don’t Want to Break Up

Monica had never seen such a shameless man, who could make how happy he was about somebody else’s breakup sound so natural.

“Whether it was when we were young or not, I’m telling you now that I don’t like you. Don’t waste your energy on me. If you have the guts to try to woo me, I’ll fire you.”

“Monica, you must separate business from private matters. How can you put them together?” The person on the other end of the phone was unhappy.

“I’m the boss. What can you do to me if I don’t want to separate business and private matters?!”

“Monica–”

“Let’s not talk about it anymore.” Monica’s expression was serious. “And I don’t want to chat with you anymore. Anyway, I won’t accept the fact that you like me.”

“Hey–”

Monica hung up the phone immediately.

F*ck. Was her luck with men that good? She had yet to break up with Finn, yet someone was already pursuing her.

Although she strongly denied Brandon’s feelings for her over the phone, she knew that Brandon really like her.

In the beginning, she did not expose that part of their relationship and could still call him her childhood friend. However, now that she had exposed it, it felt like she was deceiving herself.

As for her feelings for Brandon… It could only be said that she did not dislike him, but she did not have feelings for him.

Moreover, she was not interested in dating either. She felt that she was suited to spend the rest of her life alone.

Monica put down her phone and did not allow herself to mull over her dilemma for too long. In any case, she did not like him, so she would not allow him like her too.

When she walked out of the room, the house was empty. Sarah had probably gone to work, and Shelly and her daughter were not there either.

She had never thought of staying in Sarah’s house for too long because she was just here to take a nap. Now that she was awake, she naturally left and took a taxi to Finn’s apartment.

She had never been one to drag things out. Since she had decided on something, she would do it immediately. Right now, she had to pack her things and leave.

In fact, she could remember clearly that back when she divorced Finn, she was a few days late to pack her things, but that *sshole Finn had thrown them all away.

As that memory was replaying in her mind, she got out of the car. her footsteps were a little fast. One had to know that all her clothes now were branded, and her heart would ache if she lost all of them.

With that, she quickly walked into the elevator and pressed the button.

When she arrived at the entrance of Finn’s apartment, she was calm, but at that moment, she was inexplicably hesitant. After all, the moment she entered the house, it would mean that her relationship with Finn was over.

They had been entangled for so many years. It had been ten years since she started pursuing Finn in her first year of university!

How many decades had she, a woman, spent on a man?

At the thought of that, Monica seemed much more confident now. After all, she had spent ten years trying to warm a man’s heart. Did she think that things will change in the next ten or twenty years?

She pressed her fingerprint on the door. The moment she did that, she even wondered if Finn had deleted all of them as he did in the last divorce.

Finn could really piss people off by acting like an *sshole sometimes.

Fortunately, he did none of that this time as the door opened. When Monica walked in, Finn was in the living room, and Patsy was there too.

The two of them were sitting on the sofa and watching TV. They were watching Patsy’s favorite TV show, with Finn sitting at the side.

For some reason, she felt that the two of them got along with each other pretty well.

Would Finn’s life be better without her around?

As for her so-called dilemma… She was just confused as to how Finn could let go of her when he made the decision, just like when they divorced.

At that time, she could feel that Finn loved her, but he could do as he said and stopped loving her. She felt that she had to learn more from Finn on that.

Her appearance at that moment instantly attracted the attention of Finn and Patsy. Both of them looked at her, stunned at her abrupt appearance.

Monica said bluntly, “I came back to pack my things. It will take half an hour at most.”

Finn’s eyes seemed to flicker.

Patsy, however, was baffled. She did not know what was up with Monica.

When she woke up early that morning, she only saw Finn sitting in the living room, and Monica was nowhere to be seen.

The woman was out all night, so what could she have been up to?

Just as Patsy was about to ask, Finn suddenly called out to her, “Patsy.”

“Huh?” Patsy looked at Finn in surprise.

“Go back to your room.”

Patsy frowned.

“Be good.” Finn’s voice was cold.

Patsy pursed his lips and obediently returned to her room.

In fact, she could tell that Finn and Monica must have had a conflict, but she did not understand why Monica would have had a conflict with Finn. Finn treated her so well, so why was she so ungrateful?

If a man treated her like that, she would repay him wholeheartedly.

After Patsy left, Finn followed Monica into their room, where Monica found a big box and started to pack her things.

“Let’s talk.” Finn looked at her and said bluntly.

“Alright, go ahead. I’m listening,” Monica replied as she packed her things.

She did not stop what she was doing.

“Don’t pack yet.”

“Go ahead. I can hear you.” Still, Monica was packing her things seriously.

Finn pursed his lips.

“Monica, I don’t want to break up with you.” Finn compromised and said.

...

Monica’s hands, which were packing up her things, paused.

Slowly, she continued to pack up and said firmly, “But I’ve thought about it. I think we’re wasting each other’s time by being together.”

“If I’ve done something wrong, you can point them out.” Finn maintained his calm voice as he talked to her.

When Monica heard him speaking calmly, she somehow felt like he was talking about the weather today.

She said, “It has nothing to do with whether you’ve done wrong something or not. I just don’t think we should be forced to be together. ”

“I don’t feel forced. In fact, I’m–” Very happy.

“But I feel forced and tired,” Monica interrupted him.

“Do you like Brandon?” Finn asked her seriously.

Monica sneered. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She said, “You can think whatever you want. Anyway, I’ve always been half-hearted in our relationship. Be it the Michael in the past or the Brandon now, just take it that it’s all my fault. It’s all because I don’t take relationships seriously.”
