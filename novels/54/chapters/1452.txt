Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

That night, Chloe followed Candice back to Bamboo Garden, and it was her first time visiting Edward’s residence.

She had always thought that with Edward’s personality, the decoration style would be cold and would make people feel that it was very serious and dignified. However, she did not expect it to be so warm.

The decoration in the house was not festive, but it gave off a very warm vibe. As she quietly sized up everything there, she saw that there was only one servant in the house, and it was a man.

In that case, who would serve her?

“Teddy,” Candice called out to Teddy, who was still busy. “Come over here for a moment.”

Teddy quickly walked over.

“This is Chloe, my younger sister. She will be here for a week. Her right hand is injured and scalded. Please take care of her.” Candice introduced him naturally.

“Yes, Madam.” Teddy appeared very respectful as he called out to Chloe respectfully, “Ms. Nicholson, nice to meet you. I’m Teddy.”

“Hello. I’ll have to trouble you for the next few days.” Chloe smiled in a friendly manner.

In fact, she did not care about the servant in front of her. Especially when she heard him call Candice “madam” and her “miss “, she felt inexplicably unhappy. “Ms. Nicholson, you’re too polite. It’s my duty to serve.”

Chloe and Teddy exchanged a few pleasantries. She gave people the impression that she was very easygoing and did not put on any airs.

“I’ll take you to your room. It’s getting late, and you should rest early.” Candice said, “Teddy, please help Chloe with her luggage.”

“Alright.”

Candice handed Paige to Edward and took Chloe upstairs.

Chloe got excited the moment she walked up to the second floor. The thought of her entering Edward’s private space made her inexplicably excited. “Sister, which room are you and Edward staying in?” Chloe asked curiously.

Candice pointed. “This room.”

“In that case, can I choose the room closest to you? I’m afraid I won’t be used to living here, and I’ll be more comfortable living next door to you.”

“The room next door to mine is Paige’s.” Candice said bluntly, “And across from ours is George.”

Chloe’s face sank.

“There’s only one guest room on the second floor.” Candice pretended not to notice Chloe’s expression and continued to say to herself.

“I don’t want to live in the corner room.”

“Then, there’s only downstairs. Teddy lives downstairs, and there are two rooms next to him.”

“Isn’t the servant living downstairs?” Chloe expressed her displeasure.

“That’s why I brought you upstairs,” Candice said matter-of-factly.

Chloe forced herself to accept it. Anyway, she would be sleeping on the bed in the master bedroom one day. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Here.” Candice brought Chloe to the room at the end.

In fact, the room had everything, including an attached bathroom. Still, Chloe walked in reluctantly, and Teddy put down her luggage.

“Teddy, you can go do your own thing now,” Candice told Teddy to leave after he put the luggage down.

Chloe’s eyes widened. Was that servant not going to unpack her luggage for her?

“Chloe, I won’t disturb you anymore. Your hand is injured. You should wash up and rest early.”

“Alright.” Chloe nodded obediently.

At the thought that her impatience would mess up a big plan, she chose to bear with it. She could not afford to fall out with Candice now.

“By the way, other than Paige, there’s also George. George has a cold personality and doesn’t like outsiders to get close to him. He’s been injured and resting at home recently. Try not to provoke him,” Candice reminded Chloe.

“Is George a bad person?” Chloe asked. “He’s considered quite good,” Candice replied.

“Alright.” Chloe nodded

However, she secretly knew that Candice was definitely afraid that she would curry favor with George. After all, it was rumored that Edward loved his son, George, the most because he was Jeanne’s son.

Therefore, as long as she could please George, she would most likely become the mistress of the house and the most respected wife in the country.

Chloe was secretly coming up with a scheme in her mind. “I’ll leave first. If there’s anything, you can come and look for me.”

“Sure.”

With that, Candice left and closed the door for Chloe. Hopefully, Chloe could behave herself, or she would be courting death.

Candice did not return to her room immediately. Instead, she walked into George’s room, and George seemed to have given in to her as the door was not locked from the inside..
