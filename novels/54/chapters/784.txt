Chapter 785: Monica and Michael’s Conflict Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The streets of South Hampton City echoed with a burst of ear-piercing noises.

The two people in the car were temporarily unconscious because of the sudden impact.

While they were in a daze, someone smashed the car window, which shattered into pieces on the ground.

Nox tried his best to open his eyes.

His face was covered in blood.

As soon as he moved his body, the airbag burst and trapped him in the driver’s seat, rendering him immobile.

However, he stretched his hand out. With the last of his consciousness, she reached out to pull the person behind her.

Just as his hand touched the other party’s arm, he heard a click.

Nox felt like his wrist was broken, and it hurt so bad that it was numb. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, there was no strength left in his wrist, and he could only watch as Jeanne was dragged away from the car window.

The car window was covered in debris, and Jeanne, who was covered in blood, bled even more.

Nox’s eyes were red.

He tried to call out to Jeanne, but he could not. All he could do was watch Jeanne getting taken away right in front of his eyes.

As for himself, he fainted in the car.

The moment he fainted, he was thinking about how he was going to answer to Edward.

Should he… apologize to Edward with his life?

…

When Nox opened his eyes, everything before him was unfamiliar.

He looked at his surroundings.

In his mind, he was also trying to figure out why he was there and what had happened to him.

“You’re awake.” A familiar male voice sounded in his ear.

Nox turned his head and looked at Finn.

Finn said, “Car accident, concussion, no injuries to internal organs, and all your limbs are fine.”

“Where’s Jeanne?” Nox asked.

“I don’t know,” Finn replied.

Nox’s expression was extremely ugly.

“When we arrived, you were the only one who fainted in the car, and Jeanne was no longer there. Fourth Master has gone to look for her, so you can rest easy and recuperate,” Finn explained briefly.

“Do you know who took Jeanne away?” Nox asked.

“I don’t know,” Finn said bluntly.

“Is there any news from Edward?”

“I didn’t ask.”

Nox struggled to get up.

Finn pressed him down on the bed and said, “You should rest first. Fourth Master will inform us if he has any news. If you call him now, you’ll only be causing him more trouble.”

“I can’t f*cking believe something happened to Jeanne while she was by my side!” Nox suddenly lost his temper.

Finn understood him.

Since young, Nox was taught to protect Edward and follow Edward’s orders. Even his own life belonged to Edward.

Yet now, Edward had handed Jeanne over to Nox, but something happened to her while she was by his side.

Regarding Jeanne… They all knew she was not who they thought she was, but they did not know whether she was a friend or foe.

Moreover, they were not sure whether her accident was a good or bad thing for them.

Since Edward had handed Jeanne over to Nox, Nox had a mission to protect Jeanne with his life.

However, Nox did not manage to protect her. Instead, he watched Jeanne getting taken away from him.

Nox was on the brink of breaking down.

Finn looked at him and said, “I’ll send a message to Fourth Master to ask about Jeanne.”

Nox said nothing.

A while after Finn sent the message, Edward called, and Finn answered, “Fourth Master.”

“How is Nox?”

“He’s been unconscious for a day, but he’s awake and in a good state of mind now. I think it’s just a minor concussion. He’ll be fine after a few days of rest.”

“Alright,” he said.

“How are things on your end?”

“Tell Nox to get some good rest. I will inform you if I need anything.”

After that, Edward hung up.

Finn put down his phone. “Fourth Master said he will inform us if he needs us. He wants you to recuperate in peace.

“How the hell can I recuperate in peace?” Nox was irritated.

From a young age, he had heard the phrase, “If there is any danger, you must rush in front of Edward.”

Even if he had to die, he would die in front of Edward.

Yet now, Edward was looking for Jeanne alone, while he was sleeping in the hospital.

“Nox.” Finn said, “You once said that the three of us are like brothers.”

Nox suppressed his emotions.

“We were born to protect Edward, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t have feelings for each other,” Finn repeated what Nox had once said.

Even though men rarely got emotional, he had to say that Nox’s words at that time warmed his heart.

He said, “I’m sure Fourth Master doesn’t want to see any of us dead because of him.”
