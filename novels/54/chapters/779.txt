He chose not to know anything and just do what he was told.

Jeanne remained silent for a few seconds before she picked up her phone and dialed a number. “Ms. Sanders.”

“I watched your live stream today. You tore the whole thing up beautifully.” Quinn did not hide her praise.

“Eden ran away,” Jeanne went straight to the point.

Quinn was a little stunned.

“Eden is definitely involved in this. Eden must’ve ordered Joshua to do what he did to you, considering he suddenly ran away and disappeared before the police could arrest him.”

“You want me to use the Sanders’s power to capture him?”

“It’s not only related to the harm they did to you but to the person who is disloyal to the Sanders.”

“Do you mean the person you warned me about last night?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Quinn was still smart and immediately understood what Jeanne meant.

“Alright, I got it.” Quinn hung up the phone immediately.

Jeanne also put down her phone.

Nox turned to look at Jeanne again. He was driving the car, wandering on the streets. He said, “You’d rather ask the Sanders than Edward for help?”

“This matter concerns the Sanders’ interests. They should do something about it.”

“Is that so?” Nox smiled. “I thought you trusted the Sanders more.”

Jeanne looked at Nox and did not answer.

Nox could only smile quietly.

The car was still on the streets of South Hampton City, and Nox’s subordinates still did not have any news of Eden.

After all, it was indeed very difficult to find someone who was in hiding and even had counter-reconnaissance abilities.

Of course, the one with counter-reconnaissance capabilities was not Eden but Jake.

When Miles told her about Jake, Jeanne had requested Kingsley to help her investigate him. Hence, she knew that although the person was over 40 years old, he was still one of the best in the Special Forces in all aspects. It was a piece of cake for him to fool some of the City Police.

In the quiet car, Jeanne’s phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the caller ID. “Ms. Sanders.”

“I’ve asked my father to launch a city-wide siege operation and mobilize all the armed forces of Harken. As long as he hasn’t left South Hampton City, we’ll definitely be able to capture him.”

“I’ll be waiting for your good news.”

With that, she hung up the phone.

Jeanne was a little worried.

If it were only Eden, it would be easy. However, if it was Michael, things would not be so simple.

Michael should know everything about how the Sanders operate. Therefore, he had probably planned out all of Eden’s routes beforehand.

He might even kill Eden on the spot.

To Michael, all he wanted was Eden’s body.

In fact, the best way now was not to look for Eden so openly. That would only bring forward Michael’s plan to kill Eden.

Although she managed to think of it, she still chose that method because Eden’s life was not important to her at all.

Her main goal now was to get something on Michael, and she was betting that Michael would not be able to hold back.

If he could not hold himself back, he would do something he was not confident in.

The car was still driving on the street aimlessly.

At that moment, South Hampton City was already filled with armed forces, and the number of people mobilized was more than they had imagined.

Nox looked at the people around her and could not help but laugh. “Jeanne, you’re more capable than I thought. You really got the Sanders to help you with such a big thing.”

“As I said, it’s because it’s related to the Sanders’s interests. That’s why they’re mobilizing their forces. It has nothing to do with me.

“No.” Nox smiled, “You’re more powerful than we thought.

Jeanne did not deny it because they knew everything.

…

A day passed, and the street lights were lit.

However, there was no news from the Sanders or from Nox’s men.

Eden could not have disappeared into thin air! Or… he was already dead.

Jeanne felt that the possibility of him being dead was very high.

After all, the Sanders had sealed off all exits, so there was no way Eden could have left unless he was dead in South Hampton City.

She would not be surprised if the Sanders found a corpse in the end.

In fact, Jeanne had given up.

After all, she had never been confident about Michael.

If he could toy with the Sanders, he could also avoid her and Edward’s sights. This person was not simple.
