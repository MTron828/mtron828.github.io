Chapter 275: There’s No Need for a Fruitless Relationship to Begin

Melody’s death caused a huge sensation in Harken.

It was officially announced that she had died unexpectedly.

What was the accident? The Sanders did not announce it. They refused to announce the true cause of Melody’s death on the grounds that they were “extremely sad and unwilling to talk about it”.

Internally…

No one dared to discuss it.

Hence, Melody’s accidental death was shrouded in mystery in Harken. Those who knew the truth did not dare to say it. Those who did not know the truth would never know it.

When Jeanne saw the news of Melody’s death, it was two days after the incident.

She was still at the Swans’ Bamboo Garden, on Fourth Master Swan’s bed.

She sat at the head of the bed and watched the gray news.

Usually, when an important figure of Harken passed away, the news would be in gray.

At least, Melody’s birth gave her this “honor” in the end!

Jeanne was a little silent.

Of course, it was not because of sympathy, but because she did not expect that the chief would go this far.

Melody was his biological daughter... VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Thinking back, back then, Alexander had beaten Jeanne half to death for the sake of benefits and sent her abroad to fend for herself.

Therefore, as the ruler of the government and the chief of the great Harken, it was within expectations that he would go this far when his reputation was threatened and his dignity challenged.

Jeanne did not need to think so much.

The moment Jeanne was about to put down the phone and get up, her phone rang.

Fourth Master Swan was no longer on the bed.

To be precise, the condition that Jeanne agreed to stay was that she would not sleep on the same bed as him. It was her bottom line, and Fourth Master Swan agreed.

Fourth Master Swan was much easier to talk to than she thought.

So after Jeanne stayed, Fourth Master Swan went to the next room.

She looked at the incoming call and picked it up.

“Are you still at Fourth Master Swan’s place?” Kingsley asked her directly.

“Yes,” Jeanne also answered directly.

“Melody is dead.”

“I saw the news.”

“The chief personally gave the order,” Kingsley said.

Jeanne bit her lip. “What do you want to say?”

“It’s risky to stay with someone of high position. The chief even killed his daughter who offended him.”

“Are you reminding me not to provoke him?” Jeanne understood what Kingsley meant.

“But you already did.”

Jeanne was silent.

“Have you thought about what you’ll face next?” Kingsley asked.

“I haven’t thought about it. I only want to carry out your task for me as soon as possible. I want to take revenge for my mom as soon as possible and then leave Harken. I’ll never interfere with the matters of Harken again after that.” Jeanne made it very clear.

“Jeanne, you can’t get rid of the crap in Harken,” Kingsley enunciated each word, and his tone became cold.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She held her phone tightly, waiting for Kingsley to reprimand her.

“Didn’t I tell you that the Sanders will have many people like Melody?”

Jeanne did not respond.

“Melody died, but there’ll be someone else to replace her.” Kingsley paused for a second before he continued, “That person is going to be you!”

Jeanne tightened her grip on the phone.

“From the moment you returned to South Hampton City, what have I been telling you the most?” Kingsley asked her.

Jeanne did not answer.

Kingsley said coldly, “Stay away from Fourth Master Swan.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved.

She knew that Kingsley was very emotional toward her at this moment.

“Now, do you know why I have to ask you to stay away from him?” Kingsley’s tone today was obviously not good.

Jeanne did not want to answer him.

“You should be clear about the current situation of Harken. Most of the economic lifeline of the country is in the hands of the Swans. The Sanders don’t have enough control over the economy. After the Sanders stabilized their political power, they naturally had to secure the business industry as well. Therefore, the Sanders took the initiative to rope in the Swans, trying to take over the management rights of the business industry from them. In order to take over the management rights of the Swans, the best way is to use marriage. After becoming a family, the Sanders will have a reasonable excuse to interfere in the Swans’ business. In addition, with the power of the Sanders now, it’ll be easy for them to swallow the Swans’ assets bit by bit,” Kingsley said clearly.

Jeanne listened and understood.

She understood clearly the determination of the Sanders in the matter of the marriage with the Swans.

The marriage had failed because of her.

She gritted her teeth and retorted, “Do you think that the Swans can’t think of something that even the Sanders can think of?! From the start, the Sanders were wrong to try to set up a marriage with the Swans. Did you really think that the Swans would accept the Sanders’ conspiracy and agree to the marriage just like that ?! The Swans shouldn’t be as stupid as we thought! Yes, I admit that I didn’t listen to you. I didn’t completely stay away from Fourth Master Swan, but even if it wasn’t for me, Fourth Master Swan wouldn’t have married Melody. So, I shouldn’t be charged guilty for the failure of that marriage! Besides, I’ve made it clear to you that I was only doing Fourth Master Swan a favor. Of course, I didn’t expect him to cling to me like that!”
