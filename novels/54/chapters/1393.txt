1394 Nox and Shelly Meet Again

“How much were the flowers? I’ll pay you back.”

Finn looked at Monica’s reply and stared at it.

That was the first time Monica had replied to him in a month. Although the content was not great, it made him excited.

At least, Monica was reacting to everything he did, and everything he did could still affect her. It proved that being annoying could be a good thing too.

He was afraid that she would feel nothing for him — no expectation or even resentment.

After a long time, he typed a few words in the chat box. “This is for you. You don’t have to pay me back.”

The other party replied very quickly, “I don’t need you to send me flowers. From tomorrow onwards, I will also get my secretary to reject your flowers. Please don’t make things difficult for my secretary.”

Finn looked at the text Monica sent, which was a little hurtful, and wondered if it was the same for Monica in the past. Was she also hurt by his indifference toward her when she was pursuing him?

In the past month, he had truly felt how hurtful it can be.

Ever since Monica and Brandon left that day, Monica had been ignoring him.

No matter how he texted her to explain his past thoughts or how he insisted on sending her flowers every day, she remained indifferent and even pretended not to know.

He had a feeling that Monica would ignore him every time he sent her a message, but the text gave him hope. Even if she hated him, Monica was not completely indifferent to him.

Yet, at that moment, Monica’s cold rejection made him a little flustered again.

He may have never pursued a woman before, but deep down, he had always felt that it was not difficult to woo women.

Perhaps he had always had suitors around him, so he subconsciously felt superior. Now, all his efforts were wasted on Monica.

He looked at the text on his phone and did not reply for a long time as he did not know how to reply.

Seeing that Finn did not reply, Monica did not take it to heart. When it came to breaking up with Finn, she was much more carefree than she had imagined.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Brandon pushed the door open and entered. The first thing he saw was the dazzling bouquet of flowers.

Monica seemed to have noticed Brandon’s gaze. She said, “If you like it, you can take it away.”

Brandon smiled. “Finn hasn’t given up yet?”

“I don’t know.”

“He has exceeded my expectations. I didn’t think he would be so persistent.”

“Me, too.” Monica agreed.

“It seems that he really can’t let go of you.”

“No, he just can’t let go of himself.” Monica was certain. “He has been entangled with me for so many years that he just can’t figure it out at the moment.”

“If Finn really changed for you, would you return to his side?”

“Finn won’t change.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What if?”

“There are no ifs,” Monica said, setting up a huge wall in her heart. “I won’t try again.”

To put it bluntly, Monica did not believe that Finn would really change.

Just as Brandon wanted to say something, Monica directly interrupted him, “It’s working hours. Do you have too much free time on your hands?!”

Brandon swallowed the words he was about to say. Then, he changed the topic and reported his work. “The development of the new product has been successful, and it will soon be available on the market. Before this, you mentioned that you wanted to go abroad to learn about the market’s operating concept. So, I’ve contacted the world’s most famous S Group, and they said they’ll welcome us next week.”

“Next Monday?” Monica asked.

“Yes, next Monday.”

“Okay. Book the plane tickets and plan the itinerary in advance. We’ll leave on Sunday.”

“The flight will take about eight hours, so I suggest we leave on Saturday. Then, we can still have some time to rest on Sunday. Otherwise, it’ll be very tiring on Monday. Moreover, if we don’t adapt to the weather there, I’m afraid it will affect the outcome of the visit.”

Monica thought for a moment and said, “Let’s leave on Saturday night.”

“Are you busy on Saturday?” Brandon was smart enough to figure it out immediately.

“I have something very important on Saturday. Book a flight for after 10 p.m., ” Monica said.

It should be fine after 10 p.m.

“Alright.” Brandon naturally did not probe further. He said, “Your secretary, Tim, and I will accompany you on this business trip. Is that okay?”
