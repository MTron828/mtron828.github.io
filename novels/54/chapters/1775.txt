Chapter 1776: Shelly Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Sarah, that’s enough!” Brandon’s tone was a little sterner.

“Look at you raising your voice at me again! What right do you have to scold me?” Sarah looked aggrieved. “Were you like this when you were with my cousin? You were obviously much gentler to her, but look at how you’re treating me now! You don’t love me at all.”

“Let’s talk when you sober up.”

“I’m not drunk! Brandon, I remember the fight we had a few days ago. I even remember everything you said to me!” Sarah accused.

Brandon was speechless. The situation that day was that he had to work overtime. As Monica had not been at work for a long time, most of the workload was on him.

However, he had to admit that even though Monica and Finn had reconciled and he had completely given up on Monica, he treated Monica differently from others. He seemed to be instinctively more attentive toward Monica, so when Monica was not working, he would do whatever he could to share Monica’s burden.

That day, he was planning the sale of a listed drug when Sarah called and asked him to have dinner with her. He agreed, not expecting work to end so late. He got so busy with work that he had forgotten about it, and by the time he remembered it, it was 9 p.m. at night.

He quickly called Sarah, who said that she had eaten and gone back, so he did not take it to heart. Although he felt a little guilty, he was not too worried about Sarah as the two of them seemed to be in a normal relationship and were not too serious yet. Moreover, ever since that drunken incident, they had never slept together again.

Since he knew that Sarah had gone back, he did not look for her and went back himself. When he returned home and was lying on the bed, ready to sleep, he suddenly remembered that today was Sarah’s birthday. He remembered her saying a few days ago that she wanted to have dinner with him on her birthday, yet he stood her up in the end.

At the thought of that, he felt a little apologetic. He quickly called Sarah, but she did not answer his call. Perhaps it was because it was a little past his bedtime, but he could not fall asleep after that. Hence, he climbed out of bed and drove around the city before finding a 24-hour flower shop.

He bought a bouquet of flowers and went to apologize to Sarah. After knocking on Sarah’s door, Sarah opened the door in her pajamas and looked at Brandon coldly.

“Happy birthday.” Brandon smiled.

However, Sarah was very indifferent to him.

She said, “It’s past 12 a.m. now. My birthday was yesterday.”

“I’m sorry. I had a lot on my hands, so I forgot for a moment.”

“It’s nothing.” Sarah yawned. “It happens once a year anyway. It’s getting late. You should go back.”

“Are you angry?” Brandon asked.

“I’m not angry.” Sarah replied, “I’m just sleepy.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Tomorrow night— No, I’ll make up for your birthday tonight, okay?” Brandon could feel Sarah’s emotions.

She was not usually that cold. In fact, her personality was very similar to Monica’s when the latter was younger, and she was clearly angry.

“There’s no need. I’m meeting a friend for dinner tonight, so I don’t have time.” Sarah yawned again. “It’s really late, and I have work early tomorrow. Besides, you’re so busy at work all day. You should go back and rest early.”

As she spoke, she was about to close the door , but Brandon hurriedly held the door open. Sarah frowned. She did not know what the man wanted to do. Between her and Brandon… what happened tonight had indeed disappointed her.

In any case, Brandon would not take her words seriously. She waited until 9 p.m. and not any longer. She told herself to treat it as if nothing happened, so she ate a romantic candlelight dinner alone and came back peacefully. If Brandon had not appeared so suddenly, she would have forgotten about the matter.

“Can I stay over at your place tonight?” Brandon asked her.

His goal was obvious. Of course, a night spent between an adult man and woman was not just a simple

She said, “Maybe next time. It’s too late tonight.” Brandon just stared at her.

Sarah said, “Go on. I’m really sleepy… Oh..”
