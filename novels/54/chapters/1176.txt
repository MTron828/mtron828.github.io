“Have you said enough?” Warren’s face was tense, and he looked extremely terrifying. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that moment, Jeanne clenched her fists tighter and tighter.

Chester sneered as he looked at Warren. He was no longer afraid after being afraid for the first half of his life.

“Not yet,” he said.

Warren’s eyes were red, and he was furious.

Chester then looked at Jeanne and said, “Jeanne, do you think you’ll get anything in return for helping Warren? Even if I don’t kill you now, once you lose your value, he will kill you mercilessly. Let’s put it this way, if the Duncans were to catch up now, you would be the first person Warren would take as a hostage. Do you believe me?”

Of course, she believed him. However, it was not the time for her to go all out with Warren yet.

No one knew who would win until the last second!

“Don’t be so naive to think that you’ll become Warren’s most beloved child. His love will always be based on his own interests, and it will be the same for you!”

“I don’t care. All I care about is living in the Sanders. Without Kingsley’s protection, I need to find a safe haven. I don’t mind being used by my father. After all, I’m also using him to give me a safe place to stay!” Jeanne said to Chester, enunciating each word.

“What a joke.” Chester said sarcastically, “Your so-called safe place is just a hell that can kill you at any time! I’m not even afraid to tell you that Warren planned Kingsley’s death! Do you think we didn’t receive Kingsley’s request for help that night? It was Warren, the father in front of you who you thought could keep you safe. He pretended he did not hear it. His goal was to make Kingsley and Edward kill each other. In his opinion, whether Kingsley or Edward died, it would be beneficial to him. He was planning to sit back and enjoy the fruits of someone else’s labor!”

Jeanne glared at Chester and watched as he told her everything she knew.

“Enough!” Warren roared, “Don’t make me lose all my affection for you!”

“Do you think I still have affection for you? Although I’ve inherited your cold-bloodedness, ruthlessness, and cruelty, I still scoff at how you treat everyone to achieve your goals. I still detest you. So, if you die, I won’t be sad at all. Not just me, but no one else should be sad! After all, if it weren’t for your own disgusting incompetence, the Duncans wouldn’t have been able to bribe so many people from the Sanders so quickly, and you wouldn’t have to die so quickly!

“Warren, what happens to the Sanders and you, in the end, is the retribution you deserve. Even if you die, you’ll die a sinner!” Chester gritted his teeth as he spoke.

At that moment, he seemed to have lost all his affection for his father.

He moved his hand. It was obvious that he was giving orders to kill Warren and Jeanne.

Jeanne had previously thought that Chester might be more humane than Warren. However, it was only at that moment did she realize that Chester hated Warren for his ruling that caused the Sanders’ decline and for allowing him to take over a terrible mess.

In reality, Chester and Warren were the same. They had no conscience at all! There was only power, desire, and killing!

She watched as Chester retreated step by step and ordered his personal bodyguards to surround Warren and Jeanne to shoot them dead!

At that very moment, a violent gunshot suddenly sounded in the sky. After that, a dense barrage of gunshots rang out from all directions, shooting all the bodyguards in front of him dead.

Jeanne and Warren quickly crouched down and rolled to the ground. With the sudden support of people, they successfully escaped from the gates of hell.

They were closely protected by a group of people, and naturally, Chester was defeated.

In just a few minutes, Chester had become that dog of death again as more people suddenly appeared and pointed their guns at his head.

Then, he knelt down in front of Warren, who looked down at his own son with a cruel expression on his face.

Chester seemed to be shocked as to why he had suddenly fallen into Warren’s trap.

Did Warren not only have one personal bodyguard? Why did so many people suddenly appear?

“Bam!” Warren kicked Chester to the ground.

Chester fell to the ground, his face covered in blood.

Warren said, “I brought you to this world and raised you. Do you think I don’t know what’s on your mind? Do you really think I didn’t notice that you changed my bodyguard? I was just testing you to see if you were loyal to me! I didn’t expect that you would really want to kill me to usurp the throne! You beast!”

With that, Warren kicked Chester’s face again, and Chester rolled on the ground in pain.

“Ah!” Chester screamed.

At that moment, Warren stepped on the back of Chester’s hand.

After he stepped down, he kept pushing down with his feet to crush Chester’s hand. He did not care about their father-son relationship at all.

Chester was in so much pain that he wished he was dead!

Jeanne stood at the side and watched coldly as the father and son killed each other.

In fact, the moment Chester was feeling smug, she had already noticed the strange situation around her — that many people were lying in ambush around her.

As long as they found the right time, Chester would die immediately!

In that case, how could she have exposed her inner thoughts? She could only accompany him as he continued his act.

Then, she saw Chester courting his death.

“Father!” Chester was in excruciating pain. He said, “Let me go! I’m begging you to let me go! Please! I’m your son. If you kill me, who will inherit your legacy? Don’t kill me. I know I was wrong…”

He was quick to submit. However, Warren was never such a benevolent person.

Warren continued to step on the back of Chester’s hand and grabbed his hair. Chester’s face was covered in blood, and Warren could not help but look at his ferocious expression. Other than cruelness, there was no trace of restraint in Warren’s eyes. “Why didn’t you say I was your father when you had someone point a gun at my head?”

“Father, I was wrong. I know I was wrong. I was too arrogant. I beg you to let me go. I beg you…” Chester was in excruciating pain. Tears, snot, and blood were all over his face. “I really won’t do it again. I won’t do it again!”

“A dog can’t change its ways! Do you want me to let you go and wait for you to make a comeback one day?”

“I won’t, father…” Chester kept calling out for his father.

He was trying to make Warren pity him and let him go.

“I’ve reminded you before that if you want to achieve great things, you can’t be soft-hearted! And although you’ve learned it, you’re using it on me!” Warren’s cold voice was extremely terrifying. “Now, I’ll show you what it means to not acknowledge your family!”

“No, father, don’t kill me. I beg you, don’t kill me…” Chester’s eyes widened, and he was so frightened that it was as if he had lost his soul.

Warren reached out his hand coldly, and the subordinate beside him respectfully handed over a black pistol.

The muzzle of the gun was aimed directly at Chester’s head.

Chester was so scared that his entire body went limp. It was as if he did not know how to resist at that moment. He just allowed Warren to shackle him, and then he kept mumbling, “Don’t kill me. Don’t kill me–”

“Bang!”

A bullet directly shot through Chester’s head, and his brain exploded.

...

Warren’s face was covered in Chester’s blood, but he did not react at all.

He threw Chester’s body on the ground and stood up. He took out a handkerchief from his suit pocket and wiped Chester’s face clean. It was as if nothing had happened just now. No one could tell that he had killed his biological son!

Once he was done wiping, he threw the handkerchief on the ground before turning around to face Jeanne.

Jeanne was stunned. At that moment, she was visibly frightened by Warren’s insensitive attitude.

Warren smiled at her and said, “It’s not the cruelty of a father, but that you have to be taught a lesson for doing something wrong. But don’t worry, Jeannie, I know how loyal you are to me. As long as you do what I say, I’ll leave everything to you, even the Sanders’ empire.”

Jeanne quickly regained her senses and said respectfully, “Don’t worry, father. I will never betray you.”

“I knew it. You’re smarter than the others!” Warren felt a little relieved.

Then, he turned around and walked toward the helicopter not far away. Jeanne held it in and followed him.

At that moment, she finally saw Warren’s true strength.

She turned to look at Chester, who looked unrecognizable as he was lying on the ground. She had watched him die a tragic death.

However, she gritted her teeth and quickly followed behind Warren.

...

Just as they were about to board the helicopter, a subordinate beside Warren suddenly pounced on him and pushed him to the ground. “Leader, be careful!”

At the same time, Jeanne quickly moved to the side and kneeled on the ground.

The next second, a loud noise sounded was heard. “Boom!”

She was sprawled on the ground, her back covered in wounds.

Her vision was also blurry, and her head felt heavy. There were a few times when she almost fainted, but Jeanne forced herself to stay awake.

As she stayed awake, she saw a group of people suddenly rushing over from within the fire with guns in their hands and firing at them.
