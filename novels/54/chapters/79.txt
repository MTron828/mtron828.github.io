Chapter 80: Your Mother Is Always Right!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On this day, at 4:00 pm.

Teddy did not know what had happened to his master. His master was obviously busy, but he suddenly asked him to leave the company. Teddy thought that something big had happened to his master, but he did not expect that he was just wandering back and forth on this ordinary street.

He did not know what his master saw in this street!

It was until...

School was over at a school called Angerburg.

Their car stopped at the gate.

There were many children coming and going after school, and almost all of them were picked up by luxury cars.

“It’s Little Master Lawrence,” Teddy said as he looked at a small boy.

His master naturally saw it too.

George stood at the gate. The car from home had not arrived yet, so he stood there obediently and waited.

A few senior primary school students suddenly appeared and surrounded George.

“I heard that you’re a genius?”

“I heard that you caused a sensation in the entire school on the day of your interview?”

“My parents are all talking about you at home.”

“You’re so amazing, aren’t you?”

A few boys cornered George.

One of the teachers clearly saw it, but because he did not dare to provoke the students involved. In particular, the one leading the group of people surrounding George had a prominent family background, so he turned a blind eye to the situation.

“It seems like he’s going to be bullied,” Teddy said quickly.

Edward’s expression was cold.

He opened the car door.

Teddy also got out of the car hurriedly.

When the two of them walked over, George was pushed to the ground by the few boys.

George was not afraid, but he did not resist either. He just looked straight at the few tall boys in front of him.

“What are you doing?!” Teddy shouted sternly.

When the boys heard the noise, they immediately turned their heads and saw Fourth Master Swan and Teddy.

The little boy who was leading the group was not afraid of them at all. He raised his head and said fiercely, “It’s none of your business. We’re teaching our little brother a lesson. Get out of my way— Ah!”

Teddy grabbed the little boy’s collar and fiercely threw him to the ground.

When the other little boys saw that their leader was hit, they quickly went forward to hit Teddy.

A commotion instantly broke out at the school gate.

The school security guards and the teacher quickly made their move. “Stop! Stop right now!”

Teddy pretended not to hear him and settled the other boys in no time.

At this moment, the security guards went forward to restrain Teddy.

“Stop!” Edward’s voice was deep.

The few security guards seemed to be stunned.

A security leader asked, “Who are you? Why did you hit our school’s students at the school gate? We have to call the police!”

“Call the police and arrest them! Call the police and arrest them!” A little boy lying on the ground shouted loudly, “Do you know who I am? I’m Young Master Reed of South Hampton City. I’m the young master of one of the twelve great families of South Hampton City. Given how you treated me, I’ll ask my father to kill you!”

Edward sneered. “I’m Edward Swan. Tell your father to come and find me. I’ll be waiting for you at the Swan family’s courtyard anytime.”

“Alright, you better remember this. I’ll make you go bankrupt!” The boy said fiercely.

Edward completely ignored him. He turned around and faced George, who had stood up. “Come with me.”

“No.”

Edward frowned.

“My mom will look for me.”

“Are you planning to go back to see your mom like that?” Edward asked.

George lowered his head and looked at his dirty clothes. He shook his head.

He had never wanted Jeanne to worry about him since he was young.

George had never thought of telling her about what had happened today.

“So, let’s go. I’ll tell your mother,” Edward said and turned around to walk toward his car.

Teddy respectfully opened the car door for Edward.

George hesitated for a moment before he followed Edward into the car.

At the same time, Quinton stayed behind for a while because of a performance at school. The moment he stepped out of the door, he saw his fourth uncle. He was a little excited and ran fast with his short legs. Just as he reached the door of his fourth uncle’s car, the car started to move.

‘Aren’t you here to pick me up…?!’

Quinton watched the car leave with his eyes wide open.

In the car, Teddy looked at the rearview mirror. “It seems to be Little Master. Do you want me to pick him up and bring him back?”

“Doesn’t he have parents?”

“...”

Teddy was speechless.

They did not go straight back to the Swan family’s courtyard. Teddy was used to his master’s crazy behavior. In any case, he thought that it was a matter of fact that the car was parked in the shopping mall.

It was worth noting that his master never went shopping. Now that he was strolling around the children’s clothing area, he looked calm.

“Do you like any of them?” Edward asked.

He asked George.

George responded, “My mom said that I can’t take things from strangers.”

“Am I considered a stranger?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“My mom said that you’re not a good person.”

Edward stopped in his tracks.

George looked up at him.

Edward squatted down.

He was 189 cm tall, whereas George was 120 cm tall. In front of him, George was pitifully small.

Edward maintained the same height as George and said, “In this world, other than your mom, I’ll be the best person to you.”

“Why?” George did not believe him.

“That’s because...” Edward paused and said to George, “You can go back and ask your mom.”

Then, he stood up and casually walked into a children’s clothing store. He said to the shop assistant, “I want every style and color of clothes that he can wear.”

“...” Teddy went to pay for the clothes.

After buying the clothes, they returned to the Swan family’s Bamboo Garden.

“Take a shower first,” Edward instructed.

George nodded.

At that moment, the phone suddenly rang.

George hurriedly picked it up. “Mom.”

“Why aren’t you home?” Jeanne’s anxious voice came from the other end.

George was about to reply when Edward directly took the phone over and said calmly, “He’s at my place.”

At this moment, George looked at Fourth Master Swan talking on the phone.

Although Fourth Master Swan looked calm and collected, George still felt that her mother was very angry, so much so that she could kill someone!

Fourth Master Swan hung up the phone.

George looked at him and asked, “Is my mom angry?”

“No.”

He did not believe it.

“Take a shower.” Edward did not explain.

“I’ll take Little Master Lawrence to take a shower,” Teddy quickly said.

“There’s no need. You can arrange dinner.”

Teddy expressed that he was used to the crazy fourth master.

Hence, he turned around and went straight to the kitchen.

Edward brought George to the bathroom.

“You want to take a shower too?” George saw Fourth Master Swan taking off his clothes.

“If not?”

“I can do it myself.”

“I didn’t say I want to help you take a shower,” Edward said, “Do you know how to save water?”

“Do you lack money?” George asked.

“Saving is a virtue.”

“...”

The two of them showered in the bathroom.

“Don’t you need to take off your glasses?” Edward asked.

“No.” Jeanne had said that he could not take off his glasses in front of outsiders.

Edward did not insist.

He grabbed the small-sized George to his side. “I’ll help you scrub your back.”

“No need...”

Despite his protest, George’s back was already being scrubbed.

“Do you want a dad?” Edward asked casually.

“No.” George refused immediately. “Men are all undesirable.”

“Who said that?”

“My mom.”

“...” Edward paused for a long time before he asked, “Aren’t you a man too?”

“She said that I’m still a boy and not a man. Once I become a man, I’ll become undesirable.” George turned his head and seemed a little puzzled. “Is that true?”

Edward chuckled. “Your mother is always right!”
