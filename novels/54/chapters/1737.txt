Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hehe.” Monica smiled sinisterly. “Do you also think that Finn and I are very lovey-dovey? How can we be so lovey-dovey?”

Jeanne rolled her eyes at Monica, who believed Jeanne was jealous of her. Although Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were very much in love, Fourth

Master Swan was always busy and did not have much time to accompany Jeanne. However, Finn was different. Finn was willing to give up his job for her.

‘Oh, how am I so lucky?’ she thought.

Jeanne could tell what Monica was thinking just by looking at her. As always, that woman’s emotions were displayed on her face, and only those who were doted on could act so unrestrictedly.

In the end, Jeanne stayed with Monica for the entire day because Monica refused to let her go. She said she was bored and insisted that Jeanne stayed with her. No matter how good Finn was to her, no one could replace Jeanne’s position in her heart.

In the afternoon, Nox came over.

Monica was a little surprised when she saw Nox. “Why are you here again?” “You don’t welcome me, do you? If you don’t, I’ll leave immediately,” Nox threatened.

“When did you become so petty?” Monica called out to him. “I’m just saying you don’t seem like someone who likes to come to the hospital. Why? Did you quarrel with Shelly?”

“Quarrel? What can we quarrel about?” Nox looked unconcerned.

In fact, they did not quarrel; they got along very peacefully.

Last night, when Nox drove home and Shelly and Bella were sitting at the back, he talked a lot about the babies. However, Shelly did not interrupt. Since he did have the slightest intention of having a baby, he felt a little awkward toward the end and stopped talking altogether.

He figured that he and Shelly would spend their last year together peacefully. Then, a year later, they would no longer be each other’s.

“It sounds like your relationship with Shelly isn’t going well.” Monica frowned and asked.

“Nothing can be forced.” Nox said bluntly, “I was too naive in the past and thought of everything too simply.”

“It’s not too late to understand that now.” Monica did not give Nox any way out.

She was trying to persuade him to stop making things difficult for Shelly, but Nox did not answer. He had decided to keep his thoughts to decisions to himself. One day, when he had had enough of it, he would naturally get over it.

“I’m going to take a look at your two ugly babies.” Nox changed the topic and smiled brightly.

“Who are you calling ugly? You’re the ugly one. Your entire family is ugly!” Monica was angry.

Even though she did not think they looked good either, her mother said they were very good-looking newborn babies, and she believed it. After all, even if they were ugly, she had to tell herself that they were beautiful.

Nox walked over to Finn, who was holding a baby in his arms. The baby was not vet asleep and was staring at Finn with wide eves. looking at him curiously without crying or making a fuss. She even looked a little cute but ugly.

“This must be the younger sister.” Nox was certain.

“How did you Imow?” Finn asked.

“It’s obvious from the look in your eyes that she’s your little lover.” Nox was certain.

“Is that so?” The smile on Finn’s face was wide.

“Can I hold your little lover?” Nox asked.

Upon hearing that, Finn hesitated a little, and it made Nox wonder whether they were still best friends. Fortunately, Finn hesitated for a few seconds before handing the baby to Nox, who was not experienced at holding a baby. The baby was just too soft and cute that he was at a loss as to what to do.

“One hand on her head, and the other holding her little butt.” Finn taught Nox.

Nox was sweating profusely. He thought that carrying a baby would be an easy task, so he did not expect it to be so difficult. The baby’s body was soft, and he was afraid he would accidentally drop it. Even after a while, he felt awkward holding her.

Nox’s appearance amused Monica and Jeanne.

“You guys are not allowed to laugh,” Nox shouted at them, but he did not dare to raise his voice. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He was afraid he would scare the baby, who was looking at him curiously, in his arms. As she stared at him, she suddenly smiled..
