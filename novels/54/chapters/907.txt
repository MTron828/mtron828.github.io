908 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

Jeanne was starting to get suspicious that there really was no sign of Alex. However, it would mean everything they had done was in vain. It was just a trick by Edward.

Otherwise, how could Edward be so calm? Though…

She pursed her lips. There seemed to be some obvious signs between his legs. How could he be in the mood to do such a thing in this situation?

The inspection was halfway done. At that moment, everyone probably had the same thoughts as Jeanne.

In the wedding hall, the lights were suddenly extinguished. Before anyone could react, intense gunshots were heard in the darkness. The gunshots instantly threw the entire scene into chaos, and screams of fear rang out continuously. The scene was completely out of control.

“Don’t move, everyone! Be quiet! One of the Sanders’ guards said loudly, “We will ensure everyone’s safety. Everyone, don’t move!”

However, it did not make anyone quiet down. People were shuttling through the banquet hall, and some were screaming and crying. They were uncontrollable in the darkness.

The guards of the Sanders did not dare to shoot rashly and would only stand positioned to protect everyone. One by one, the guards at the entrance of the wedding banquet hall fell under the gunfire.

The doors of the wedding banquet hall opened. When everyone saw the light, they started to rush out without a care for their lives.

“Everyone, don’t leave! Keep quiet, and don’t move!” The guards had been preventing everyone from leaving.

The hall was filled with heart-wrenching wails. There were screams everywhere because of the guards’ obstruction. It was utter chaos.

At this moment, the assassins of the Hills also took action. They only had one target, Edward!

As soon as the lights turned dark, Jeanne immediately went in Edward’s direction. She saw him leave quickly in the dark, and Jeanne could only follow her instincts as to where he was.

Amid the chaotic crowd, she struggled to keep up. However, she could still see Edward’s figure. Perhaps it was someone similar. After all, he had clearly disappeared from her sight. It was due to that feeling. The feeling of him walking past her that she had recognized Edward’s existence in the dark.

At that moment, she finally understood why Edward could recognize her immediately. Sometimes, it really was not the eyes that determined a person but the heart.

She gritted her teeth, reached out, and grabbed him. It had not been Edward, but the person Edward was protecting in the dark and currently leading out. This explained why Edward, who had disappeared in front of her, suddenly appeared behind her. It was obvious he had gone back to save her, and the person he was protecting was the Duncans’ descendant.

Jeanne had just grabbed the man’s arm when she felt a sharp pain in her wrist. The strong force made her instantly let go. She could only watch as the man whom she had finally touched for a second left her grasp. She stared straight at the figure and watched as he quickly left the banquet hall and followed the crowd to the exit.

While it was dark inside the wedding banquet hall, daylight still shone outside. As long as the light outside shone on the man once he walked out the door, she would be able to see who he was. Even if it was just a back view, one could be sure who it was.

Just as the truth was about to surface, she was suddenly shackled in someone’s arms. He even used a lot of brute force to bury her face in his chest, making her unable to see anything in front of her. Jeanne resisted with all her might, but it was to no avail. She was firmly trapped by Edward and could not move.

She gritted her teeth and aimed the black muzzle of the gun in her hand directly at his abdomen. This was the weapon she always carried with her. Even when she had been intimate with Edward, he would strip her of her clothes but never her weapon.

She said, “I swear I’ll shoot!”

Edward could feel her determination.

“I know.” Edward said, above her head, “But I have no other choice.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne’s body trembled uncontrollably. She only needed to kill Edward with one shot to find out who the descendant of the Duncans was. As long as she fired the shot, she would know. However, her trembling fingers could not bear to pull the trigger.

Suddenly, a gunshot rang out and landed on Edward.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat. She was even a little flustered. She did not fire her weapon. So who was the one who shot Edward?

Before she had time to collect her thoughts, Edward was already rolling on the ground with Jeanne in his arms and buried her face in his chest. She used all her strength but still could not break free.

“Edward!” Jeanne sounded anxious. She did not know where Edward had been hurt.

She did not know…

“I’m not going to die.” He said right beside her ear. As he spoke, he brought her to a corner of the banquet and hid.

“Where are you hurt?” Jeanne asked him loudly. As she was trapped by him, she had no idea where the bullet had hit him. There was unconcealable worry in her tone.

“Let me go!” Jeanne said.

Edward twisted his body and said fiercely, “If I let go, you won’t go looking, right?”

“I promise,” Jeanne replied.

Edward released her, trusting her. However, the moment he let go, Jeanne got up from Edward’s side to chase after him.

Since she was delayed for some time, that person must have already gotten out. However, as long as she chased after him and checked the time, she might be able to find him.

The moment she stood up, her body was suddenly pulled back.

F*ck. Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“I knew you wouldn’t be so honest.” Edward even laughed. Even in the dark, his smile could be clearly felt.

Jeanne glared at Edward. He had just been testing her. As he could guarantee that she would not be able to escape, he deliberately tested her!

Between them, who was more cunning?!
