1381 Getting Along and George’s Rejection

“I know. Daddy and Mommy worked so hard last night just to give me a younger sister. Daddy, am I going to be an elder sister soon?” Paige asked happily.

Edward was stumped by Paige’s question.

“Daddy, can I see my sister tomorrow?” Paige was so caught up in her own joy that she could not help herself but ask.

Candice looked at Edward speechlessly for a long time. She wondered if that was what people meant by something would always conquer another.

Fortunately, at that moment, Teddy walked over respectfully. ” Fourth Master, Madam, dinner is ready.”

Edward nodded and said to Candice, “Let’s eat.”

“Yes.”

The family walked to the dining table.

The moment they walked over, Candice glanced at George, who was sitting on the sofa and did not participate in their conversation. He did not even look at them.

George did not like her very much, and she could tell. However, it was understandable. Who would want their father to marry another woman?

She followed Edward to the dining table.

Although George did not like her, he was extremely well-mannered and would not lose his temper willfully. Hence, he sat quietly at the dining table.

With that, the family ate dinner quietly.

“Daddy, I don’t want to eat this green vegetable.” At the dining table, only Paige’s voice could be heard.

Paige had a very generous character and lively personality, which was completely different from George’s.

Was it because George was 10 years old this year, so he was mature and sensible, or had he always been like that?

Candice looked at the scene of Paige eating on Edward’s lap and suddenly felt sorry for George. She felt that Edward had given all his love to Paige and seemed to be much colder to George.

Of course, she also knew that George, as the Leader’s next successor, had to be nurtured differently. However, George was still a child, who needed companionship and love.

Candice suddenly picked up a piece of potato and placed it on George’s plate.

George, who had been eating properly and with good manners, paused for a moment when he saw the potato in front of him and looked up at Candice.

Candice said, “You’re a growing boy. Eat more.”

Actually, she had been carefully observing George and noticed that he liked potatoes, so she chose his favorite.

The surprise in George’s eyes slowly dimmed. At such a young age, he was very good at controlling his emotions.

“Thank you,” he said politely.

It was soft and distant.

Candice smiled.

Edward hugged Paige and looked at her and George, choosing to remain silent.

At the dining table, Peggy’s cute voice and Edward’s doting voice could still be heard.

Candice would also say a few words because the clever Paige would call out to her from time to time. Her heart would melt when she heard him call her ‘mommy’.

However, George did not participate in their conversation from the beginning to the end, and neither did he eat the piece of potato Candice had placed on his plate.

After dinner, Edward was playing with Paige in the living room. Candice accompanied Paige too, whereas George returned to his room early.

Candice looked at George’s back.

While Edward was helping Paige pile up the wood, she said calmly, “He needs some time.”

Even though Edward did not do much tonight, he still saw everything.

“Yeah.” Candice nodded.

In fact, she was fine. She was not even angry at George’s coldness or deliberate rejection of her, but for some reason, her heart ached.

Candice played with Paige for a while before Paige started yawning.

“Paige, time to go to bed.” Edward reminded her. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, Paige was having a good time and did not want to go to sleep.

“Be good and go to bed early. You can still play with Mommy tomorrow.”

“Really?” Paige’s eyes sparkled like stars.

It made people think that her world was full of colors.

“Of course, it’s true.”

“Won’t Mommy be as busy as Daddy?”

“Your mommy will stay home with you,” Edward replied.

Was Edward making arrangements for her life now?

However, she was prepared to stay at home. As the Leader’s wife, she naturally could not go out often.

Besides, she did not seem to have anything to do.
