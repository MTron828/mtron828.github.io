Chapter 830: Jeanne’s Soft Spot for Edward

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’ll tell you who the Duncans’ descendant is.” Edward enunciated every word.

When he said that, everyone was shocked, and they looked at Edward as if they could not believe that he would suddenly compromise.

He did not even mention the existence of that person when he was beaten to death last night.

Nox and Finn were also a little surprised.

The two of them looked at Edward.

Nox was angered, and he rushed toward Edward. “You’re not allowed to say anything!”

That was because he knew that to Edward, revealing that person was worse than him dying.

Since they were young, they had been living for that goal. Edward was even born for that person.

For that person, he had suffered the greatest torture in the world and given up everything!

Now that things had come to this… He could already see the light of hope, but Edward suddenly gave up.

For their sake, he suddenly had to give up.

“No,” Nox said as he looked at Edward. “If you tell him, Finn and I will die too. You’re not allowed to say anything.”

He would not allow Edward to bear such a bad name and bear the blame for them.

He would rather die.

“Nox.” Edward could see how agitated he was and knew what he was thinking. He said, “I know what I’m doing. Even if I tell them who this person is, it doesn’t mean they can do anything to him. Our efforts over the years have not been in vain.”

“However, you’ll be spurned. You’ll be spurned by your clansmen and those so-called loyal people. They will not deny everything you’ve done for this.”

“I know,” Edward replied.

“I can die.” Nox was certain, “I can die with you!”

“Me, too,” Finn was also very certain.

“Listen to me.” Edward was very weak, but his voice was very authoritative.

Nox’s eyes were red as he looked straight at Edward.

“If the three of us will die today, who will protect him? I don’t trust anyone else but the two of you.” Edward said bluntly, “By revealing his identity, I’m also leaving behind two of his most loyal people for him. Once I die, I can only leave him to you.”

“Edward!”

“Listen to me!” Edward’s tone turned cold.

Nox bit her lips and endured it.

“I’m aware of my current physical condition. Even if the three of us survive, it’ll be difficult for my body to recover when I return. I’m also crippled, so my life isn’t really important anymore. Compared to his identity being exposed sooner or later and him continuing to hide without caring about the consequences, I think it’s worth it to say it now to save your lives.”

Nox’s eyes turned watered, and his vision was blurry.

Edward was just finding an excuse to let them live, but he would become a sinner by doing so.

However, under Edward’s gaze, Nox could not say a word to refute him.

Since young, he had always done whatever Edward said. If the latter asked him to die, he would do it.

He looked at Edward, who was now facing Kingsley, asking, “Can I?”

Edward was asking Kingsley if he could let Nox and Finn leave if he told him who the Duncans’ descendant was. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Kingsley was silent for two seconds before he said, “Sure.”

“Jeanne,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

There was no emotions in his words.

She turned to look at him.

The moment she met his eyes, Jeanne’s eyes were visibly red.

She knew that Edward would really exchange his life for Nox and Finn.

“You said that if I tell you who the Duncans’ descendant is, you will use your life to ensure my escape.” Edward said, “I don’t need you to protect me. I only need you to protect Nox and Finn. ”

Jeanne bit her lip.

“Can you do that?” Edward asked her.

He was giving Nox and Finn double protection.

Although Kingsley agreed, he could not guarantee that Kingsley would keep his promise.

However, if Jeanne agreed, he would believe her.

Jeanne looked at Edward and asked, “Is this what you want?”

He would use his own life to pay for the lives of Nox and Finn.

“Is this what you want?”

“Yes.”

“Alright,” Jeanne agreed.

Since that was what he wanted, she would be satisfied.

After Jeanne agreed, Edward turned to Kingsley and said, “Nox and Finn will leave as I speak.”

Kingsley nodded.

“I’m not leaving!” Nox shouted.

He would not allow Edward to go to that extent to save him and Finn. He refused to!

“Finn!” Edward’s eyes narrowed as he said that. He was forcing Finn to take Nox away.

Finn was calmer than Nox, but his throat moved slightly.

He had been suppressing his emotions, but under Edward’s gaze, he pulled Nox along and turned to leave.

Kingsley narrowed his eyes and had Mason aim at their backs. If Edward played any tricks, Mason would shoot them both dead.

With that, he turned to look at Edward, waiting for him to speak.

After Edward confirmed that Nox and Finn had started to leave, he said, “There is indeed an orphan left behind by the Duncans, the former rulers of Harken. He has been growing up under the protection of the Duncans’ loyal men and has been hiding for many years. Now, he has returned to South Hampton City. The last time I went to the remote area, it was indeed to bring him back.”

Edward’s tone was neutral, and no one could tell his emotions.

As he spoke, he watched Finn and Nox leave.

The descendant of the Duncans is called Alex Duncan. He’s currently…”

Edward’s expression changed as he suddenly grabbed the assassin who was restraining him and pulled him back!

Behind them was a bottomless abyss. Once he jumped down, he would definitely die.

The assassin was shocked. At that moment, he instinctively let go of Edward, to avoid jumping down and dying with him.

However, at that moment, a figure quickly rushed over and grabbed Edward, who was about to fall.

Just as she grabbed his arm, Edward suddenly restrained her before she could pull him back.

Edward immediately stabilized his body, allowing the two of them to stand on the edge of the cliff, preventing them from falling.

Such control was truly astonishing. Moreover, he did it all in a second.

At this moment, the man who had put his life on the line was using his agility to control Jeanne!

“Don’t shoot!” Edward shouted at Kingsley.

Nevertheless, the movements of Mason’s fingers were noticeable.

Jeanne sneered.

As expected, she was still no match for Edward, and he was much stronger than she had imagined.
