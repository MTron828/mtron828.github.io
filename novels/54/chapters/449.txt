Chapter 450: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide

“Didn’t you hear what Eden said? Jasmine forced him to do this!”

“No matter if she did or did not...” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Without the person involved present here, none of us will know the truth!”

“What do you mean?” Henry’s face turned grim.

“Do you believe Eden’s one-sided story?”

“Eden has never lied!” Henry was certain.

“In that case, why did he keep defending himself just now?” Jeanne mocked.

Jeanne made Henry speechless.

At that moment, he was also extremely embarrassed.

Not only Henry but Eden was also extremely embarrassed.

From the moment he entered the company until now, his development had been smooth. Although he was not as outstanding as his fourth uncle, he was still a rather capable leader. The people under him and even some senior executives had high evaluations of him.

However, that woman, Jeanne, ran his reputation through the mud today.

He really did not expect that one day, he would be reduced to such a sorry state by that woman!

Jeanne said, “Of course, even if Jasmine forced him, the person who did wrong was ultimately Eden. Shouldn’t he be punished for his wrongdoings?”

......

Henry was furious. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Then, Elaine finally started to speak up for Eden.

Henry and Elaine were on the same page because the two of them were not very satisfied with Old Master Swan’s arrangements for Edward. As such, they had formed a united front.

At that moment, she said to Jeanne with the tone of an elder, “Jeanne, don’t be unreasonable!”

Jeanne’s gaze fell on Elaine again.

She even smiled at her. “Sister– No, Director Elaine, do you think I’ve taken it too far?”

“Yes.” Elaine nodded.

“The way you see it is he shouldn’t be responsible for something wrong he’s done, and our company should be the one bearing the financial loss instead! However, if the person who made the mistake wasn’t Eden but another person with another family name who has nothing to do with the Swans, would you think so too?”

“But Eden is a Swan!” Elaine was biased. “This is Swan Enterprise, so the Swans naturallyhave their privileges!”

“What you mean is that the Swans can do whatever they want, even if it means destroying the family.”

“Don’t twist the facts around!” Elaine’s presence was intimidating!

“Are you saying that since the Swans slowly built this company up from the ground, it can also be slowly destroyed?” Jeanne’s presence was no less intimidating. “It cannot be denied that the Swans are part of Swan Enterprise, but the company is not only made up of the Swans. Swan Enterprise doesn’t only need the Swans, but we also need the tens of thousands of employees as well! You’re so biased towards Eden, but have you thought about how to convince the public? Or do you think there’s no need to convince the public? After all, the Swans have the final say in Swan Enterprise!”

“Jeanne!” Elaine was also embarrassed by Jeanne’s words.

“I’m just reminding you, Director Elaine, that as a leader, you should act like a leader. Leading by example is what a leader should do!”

“It’s not your place to lecture me!”

“You have misunderstood. I’m only stating my point of view. My intention wasn’t to lecture you.” Jeanne even smiled. Her attitude was very good.

The more she acted like that, the angrier Elaine became.

However, Elaine suppressed her anger and turned her head to look at Edward. “Tell me how you’re going to deal with this!”

Everyone was also looking at Edward.

Even though Jeanne was now the second largest shareholder of Swan Enterprise, the real power lay in Edward’s hands.

He was the key person who could dictate that matter.

Edward said without thinking twice, “Let’s go with what Jeanne said.”

“Edward!” Henry started to throw a fit.

Edward said, “If you did something wrong, being a Swan won’t give you any privileges.”

“He’s your nephew. How could you bear to do that?” Henry was so angry that his body was trembling.

“All the more for you to take this as a lesson.” Edward said indifferently, “If you, as a member of the Swans, don’t consider things from the family’s standpoint, you’ll be punished even more.”

“You!” Henry looked at Edward and could not find the word to say.

Edward could not care less about Henry.

Then, he moved his finger, gesturing for the staff next to him to come forward.

“Call the judicial department to come over and collect evidence to investigate–”

“Edward, you’re not the only one with the final say in the company’s matters!” Henry stopped him.

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

Just that alone could make all of them shudder.

“After all, our father is the chairman of the company! You can’t make a decision on your own!” Henry said fiercely, “This matter should be handled by the chairman and not you!”
