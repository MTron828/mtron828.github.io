932 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

He seemed to have noticed Monica’s gaze.

He said, “These four hours are critical, so I’ll stay with you.”

Monica nodded.

She thought that he would be sleeping with Sarah in his lounge, but in the end, his good professionalism made him put his work first.

Monica did not say much as all her attention was on her father. She called out to him from time to time, making sure he was not asleep.

That went on for four hours, and four hours later, her father opened his eyes.

Even though his body was stiff and he could not move, he finally regained consciousness.

At that moment, Ruby had also woken up. When she woke up and saw Gary open his eyes, she could not help but cry.

As she cried, she said, “You’re finally up! How could you leave your daughter and me behind…”

Gary wanted to comfort his wife, but he did not have the strength to.

Monica saw through her father’s thoughts and quickly said to her mother, “If you continue to agitate him, he will go to sleep again.”

Those words obviously threatened Ruby.

She immediately stopped talking, and they accompanied each other like that.

In the meantime, Sarah seemed to have woken up as well. When she walked into the ward and saw Gary waking up, she was also very excited.

For a moment, the room was filled with joy and harmony.

Some happiness was so easily satisfied, but that was until two uniformed prosecutors walked into the ward.

Everyone’s smile froze.

“May I ask if Gary from Chi pharmaceutical is in this ward?”

“What are you looking for my dad?” Monica asked.

“He’s suspected of violating medical regulations, and he needs to come back with us for an investigation.”

“No!” Monica immediately stopped him.

“This is an order. Please cooperate.” The other party showed his proof with a cold-blooded expression on his face.

“My dad has just been resuscitated. How can he go with you now? If anything happens to my dad, you guys are abusing your power!” Monica said loudly.

The two prosecutors’ expressions turned ugly.

“I’m Gary’s attending doctor. I can write a medical report to prove that Gary is not fit to go anywhere other than the hospital. If you need to investigate anything, you can do it in the ward. Otherwise, if anything happens to the patient, our hospital will not take any responsibility, and the prosecutor’s office will not bear the responsibility!” Finn walked to Monica’s side and said sternly.

At that, the prosecutors looked at each other in dismay.

After careful consideration, a prosecutor said, “Please provide Gary with a medical certificate, and I will report back according to his physical condition. However, during this investigation, Gary can not leave this ward. If we need anything, we will come here to interrogate him.

“Sure.” Finn nodded.

Following that, he left the ward with the two prosecutors.

At the same time, Monica returned to her father’s side.

Gary could barely speak, but of course, he had also seen the prosecutors come. He said, “There can’t be a mistake. My medicine is perfectly fine–”

“Dad,” Monica called out to him. “Don’t think too much about it first. Let’s talk about it after you’ve recovered. I believe that the truth will speak for itself.”

Gary nodded. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In fact, he was not too worried about it. After all, the main reason for his heart attack was that he had been mentally and physically exhausted from work.

Hence, he said, “Call Steve over. I have something to tell him…”

“No!” Ruby immediately stopped him. “Are you still thinking about work at a time like this? You should rest.”

“That’s right, dad. Don’t think about it for now. The most important thing is to recuperate. Finn said that you’re only temporarily out of danger. If you don’t recover properly, I’ll have to send you off at your funeral!”

“What are you saying?” Ruby hit Monica.

Monica yelped in pain.

She was just telling the truth.

“I know my body, and I’ll be fine after a rest…”

“There’s no room for discussion!” Ruby refused to listen.

Gary could not argue over Ruby, so seeing how adamant Ruby was, he gave in to her even if he had something on his mind.

Monica also thought that her father had stopped thinking about work.

However, when her mother turned around to go to the toilet, he made another request to Monica, “Can you call Steve over for me?”

“Dad, can’t you just listen to mom’s advice?”

“I can’t ignore the company’s matters. I know about my body. I can handle it. ” Gary sounded very anxious.

At that moment, Monica felt that the company’s affairs might not be as simple as what Steve had said. There must be a lot of urgent matters that her father had to deal with regardless of whether he was dead or alive.

She hesitated for a moment before saying, “In that case, give me a moment.”

“Don’t let your mother know.” Gary reminded her.

“Alright.”

Coincidentally, as Monica took her phone and walked out of the ward, Ruby came out of the washroom and accompanied Gary, taking good care of him.

When Monica made the call, she hesitated for a moment and walked to Finn’s office.

She originally wanted Sarah to go, but she was afraid that Sarah would not be able to explain it clearly.

Besides, it should be normal for a family member to communicate with doctors.

With that in mind, she went straight there. She even forgot to knock and pushed the office door open.

The moment she pushed it open, she found the situation a little awkward and slammed the door shut.

That was because she saw Finn changing out of his clothes.

Although his upper body was naked and his lower body was dressed, it was still very awkward.

She always seemed to act rashly.

She stood at the door for a long time before the door opened from the inside.

Monica looked at Finn and saw that he was wearing a hospital white coat. He said, “Come in.”

He was not angry, nor did he lose his temper.

In fact, Monica was already prepared to be scolded by Finn. After all, based on her understanding of Finn, she knew that he valued his innocence more than anything else.

The scene of them getting into bed with her and almost strangling her to death was still vivid in her mind!
