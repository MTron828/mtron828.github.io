Chapter 387: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

Monica had felt cold for a long time now. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Other than a pair of underpants that she had not taken off yet, she was not wearing anything else.

She took Miles’s clothes and could not even bring herself to thank him as all her attention was on Finn — on his dying face.

She thought, ‘Don’t die. Finn, I beg you, don’t die.’

The car soon arrived at the Central Hospital.

Miles had called the emergency department, so when their car arrived, a few doctors were already waiting for them. They then placed Finn on the white moving bed, put an oxygen mask on him, and quickly pushed him into the emergency room.

Monica and Miles quickly followed.

In the corridor of the emergency room, the light from the operating room lit up, and the door was tightly shut.

With that, Monica did not know what was happening inside.

Could Finn…

Finn would not die.

He definitely would not.

Monica’s eyes were red as she sat as stiff as a board in the corridor, waiting.

......

Miles took a clear look at Monica. He was going to ask her if she wanted to treat her wounds first, but he eventually decided not to say it.

Instead, he turned around and made a call. “Mr. Thorn, I’ve successfully rescued the two of them.”

“Are their injuries serious?”

“Finn is now in the emergency room. When he was sent there, he was completely unconscious. There were many wounds all over his body, and many looked fatal. It’s difficult to determine if he would survive. As for Monica, she shouldn’t be too serious. It’s just some superficial wounds. It won’t be fatal.”

“Okay.” Kingsley instructed, “For the time being, stay by Monica’s side and protect her.”

“Yes.”

Then, the person on the other end of the phone hung up the call.

After a clear report, he returned to the corridor.

The moment he returned, he thought for a moment and went to get a doctor from the doctors on duty. Since Kingsley had ordered him to protect Monica, he had to be responsible for her wellbeing.

Hence, the doctor approached Monica and cleaned the wounds all over her face, body, and hands.

Monica turned to look at the doctor, her eyes filled with rejection.

“Mrs. Jones, I know you’re worried about Dr. Jones, but I believe he won’t want to see you ruin your body like this,” the doctor advised.

Monica bit her lip.

When she heard the words ‘Dr. Jones’, she burst into tears. She cried as if the world was going to crumble because of those three words.

Feeling a little helpless, the doctor turned to look at Miles.

Miles said, “Finn protected you with her life. Do you want to let him down?”

She did not want to let him. All she wanted was for Finn to live.

If he was alive, he could do anything he wanted.

If he was alive, she could do anything he wanted her to do.

“Take good care of your body first, and then you can take good care of Finn,” Miles said.

After that, he told the doctor to clean up Monica’s wound, so the doctor nodded and treated Monica again.

This time, Monica did not refuse.

She was afraid that she would let down Finn. After all, he had protected her with his life.

The corridor was still as quiet as ever.

The woman, who had been afraid of pain since she was young and could cry just from getting pricked by a needle, did not cry or make a fuss despite the pain. It was as if she could no longer feel it.

Her body was indeed covered in superficial wounds that were not serious

After the doctor finished cleaning up the wounds, he turned his attention to her ankle, which was swollen and deformed.

The bone inside should be seriously injured.

The doctor said, “We need to take an x-ray to see the condition of the bone.”

Miles shook his head.

It was impossible to take Monica away at a time like that.

The doctor nodded. “I’ll use a stent to keep it in position first to prevent the bone from being hurt again. When Dr. Jones comes out, we’ll do further treatment.”

With that, the doctor helped Monica to bandage her ankle.

After making sure that all the injuries on her body had been treated, he even brought her a wheelchair before he left.

By then, it was already very late at night.

Monica did not know how long Finn had been in there.

Eventually, three hours passed, and she did not know how she had sat through it while reading the words “Operation ongoing”.

However, she had to keep going.

Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded in the corridor, and Monica’s body was wrapped in someone’s embrace.
