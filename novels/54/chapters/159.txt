Chapter 160: Fourth Master Swan, Enough Is Enough

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“This is a thank-you gift,” Fourth Master Swan said.

He said seriously.

Jeanne’s palm... was hot.

She could push the memory to the back of her head.

She could have pretended that nothing had happened.

At this moment, how could she eat properly?

How could she use this hand to pick up food properly? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She moved her palm and broke free from Fourth Master Swan’s hand.

That’s right.

They did not do it in the end.

It was just that...

She helped him vent a little.

Her palm moved slightly.

There seemed to be some remaining... indescribable… feeling on her palm.

However, the person who started it looked calm and composed. In his pleasant voice, he said again, “Ms.Lawrence, eat more.”

Her mind was only filled with the feeling of her palm.

Edward had already picked up his utensils and started eating.

Jeanne had to suppress her emotions before she picked up her fork and started eating silently as well.

She did not actually know the taste of the food.

“You don’t like them?” Fourth Master Swan raised his eyebrows slightly.

“No.” Jeanne lowered her head and started eating.

“Eat more,” said Edward. As he spoke, he even picked up a piece of meat for her.

Jeanne glanced at Fourth Master Swan and said, “Thank you.”

Edward nodded slightly.

Then, he continued filling her plate from time to time.

Almost as soon as she finished eating this piece, the next piece was placed on the small plate in front of her.

“Fourth master, I can pick it up myself.” Jeanne felt that Fourth Master Swan was raising her like a pig.

If this continued, she would vomit.

“You’ve lost weight,” Fourth Master Swan said lightly as he placed another piece of meat in front of her.

“I haven’t,” Jeanne retorted.

“Compared to seven years ago, you’ve lost weight,” Fourth Master Swan said.

As he spoke, his gaze seemed to circle around her chest.

Jeanne’s face turned red.

She said, “That’s just your illusion. I’ve grown in size.”

When it came to a woman’s figure, she would not easily compromise.

“I’m talking about your face. At that time, there was still some baby fat.” Edward suddenly smiled. Her smile was very obvious. “What is Ms.Lawrence thinking?”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

This flirtatious man!

“As for some of Ms.Lawrence’s measurements...” Fourth Master Swan’s tone was slightly raised. “I have to verify it myself.”

“...”

Pervert.

Jeanne was not happy at all during the meal.

After the meal, Jeanne did not want to stay for a minute and left.

She even refused Fourth Master Swan’s offer to send her off and asked Teddy to send her off.

Teddy braced himself and sent Ms.Lawrence off.

He could imagine how he would be “treated” by his master when he returned.

Jeanne left.

Nox sat down beside Edward. “You took down Jeanne just like that?”

Edward glanced at Nox but did not reply.

“It was much faster than I thought. I thought you would have to chase her for at least a year and a half. You got Ms.Lawrence in just a time more than a month?”

“Why are you looking for me?” Edward changed the topic.

It did not matter whether he took her down or not.

What was important was that Jeanne was his.

She could only be his.

“I’m here to care about the important matters in your life.”

“You don’t need to care about my matters,” Edward refused.

“Heartless!” Nox complained.

“You can leave now.”

“Edward, you’re too realistic. Even if there’s someone of the opposite sex, you should at least restrain yourself. I’m very hurt.”

Edward ignored him.

Nox pursed his lips.

He said, “I have something important to tell you.”

Edward nodded slightly.

“Didn’t you ask me to investigate the person who touched our firewall last time? After such a long time, there hasn’t been much progress, but...” when Nox was talking about serious matters, he was still a lot more serious.

Edward looked at him.

“This time, when Ms.Lawrence released the news, the news that was posted on the Internet couldn’t be deleted no matter how hard you tried. I’ve also secretly gotten someone to crack it. This person’s method is exactly the same as the method the hacker used to break our firewall. I suspect that person has a deep relationship with Ms.Lawrence.”

Edward was silent.

“Currently, the other party throws a bomb on our firewall from time to time. After throwing the bomb, he would leave and appear at random times. It is as if he is deliberately playing with us. As he does not play by the rules, we have yet to crack his IP. I think we can investigate from Ms.Lawrence...”

“I know who it is.”

“What?” Nox was a little excited.

“Just keep an eye on it.”

“You mean, I don’t need to care about him?” Nox was trying to confirm if he had misunderstood.

Edward nodded.

“Edward, are you kidding me? This person breaks through our internal information firewall, and it can expose our trade secrets at any minute. You’re letting Ms.Lawrence play around with it?” Nox was certain that it had something to do with Jeanne.
