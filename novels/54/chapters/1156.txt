1157 Edward, I’m Pregnant

“Alright.” Edward agreed.

So, the deal was made.

“Jeanne.”

Jeanne had turned to leave when Edward called out to her. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jeanne. It seems she was no longer Jeannie.

Jeanne turned around. “Is there anything else, Fourth Master?”

So, he had returned to being Fourth Master.

“Don’t be too eager for quick success,” said Edward.

“I don’t need you to remind me.” Jeanne left without further ado.

Edward looked in the direction that Jeanne had left. He was well aware of what Jeanne was doing.

She had just never trusted him.

…

At 10 a.m. the next day, Harken released explosive news.

The first piece of news came from Jasmine, who had disappeared from South Hampton City for a long time.

She had recorded a video. From the video, it could be seen that she was now overseas and living a good life. She said in the video, “I’ve seen the news recently about the dispute over the inheritance of the Lawrence Enterprise. While I don’t know the implications, I stand here from my perspective to clarify everyone’s misunderstanding of me. First, I gave up the inheritance of the Lawrence Enterprise on my own accord. I don’t think I have the ability to devise strategies in the business world. Most importantly, South Hampton City is a sad place for me, and I might not ever go back there again. So, Jeanne asked me about the inheritance. I didn’t want it. Secondly, the current development of the Lawrence Enterprise is all due to Jeanne’s hard work. I don’t think there’s anything inappropriate about her inheriting the Lawrence Enterprise.

“On the contrary, due to her management, if Miss Sanders were to be in charge of the Lawrence Enterprise, I feel that it would be a blessing for the Lawrence Enterprise and its many employees. Jeanne should not be criticized, and the outside world’s speculations about Jeanne and the Sanders are a little out of line. Of course, this is my opinion. I don’t represent the thoughts of all other companies. I won’t comment or reply if other companies have different opinions. Thank you.”

The moment the video was released, it was interpreted and forwarded by many people.

She seemed to have given a clear answer to Jeanne’s inheritance of the Lawrence Enterprise while clearing up the first slander in the news.

At two in the afternoon, the Sanders’ official spokesperson, Chester, made a public statement and gave a clear response to the public’s doubts about the Sanders. “Regarding the anonymous tip-off letter yesterday, it has attracted the attention of the Sanders, including my father. In the face of doubts from all parties, as the Sanders’s official spokesperson, I would like to give the following response. First, the Lawrence Enterprise is indeed under Jeanne’s control, and Ms. Lawrence’s right to inherit the company is legitimate. There are no so-called secret operations. I believe Miss Jasmine Lawrence’s words today have explained everything. Secondly, regarding Cardellini Medical Technology, the Sanders never allowed Michael Ross to interfere with the economic medicine market. Ever since Mr. Ross got demoted by the Quality Inspection Hall, he has had nothing to do with the Sanders. All of Michael’s actions were his own and have nothing to do with us. Please do not blame us. In addition, we have also taken the initiative to contact the person in charge of Cardellini Medical Technology, Miss Monica Cardellini. Due to her sudden accident, we were unable to communicate with her and could not come forward to prove our innocence. We will confirm with Miss Cardellini again once her body has recovered and give everyone an explanation.

“Thirdly, regarding the Swan Group’s incident, the Sanders have given it much thought and used the most cautious method to arrest the person in charge of the Swans. There are pros and cons to this arrest, but it’s clear that the progress of the case is slow, and the shortcomings are becoming more and more obvious. Therefore, in the absence of concrete evidence to prove the Swan Group’s illegal economic dealings with other countries, we have decided to temporarily open the Swan Group’s economic dealings and release the Swans from imprisonment. This doesn’t mean that we admit that the Swans are innocent. We will continue to investigate this matter until we can confirm whether or not the Swans committed a crime! During this period, we also request that all the people in charge of the Swans not leave South Hampton City. We will use legal means to deal with them based on the results of our investigation!”

Chester paused.

He seemed to be letting everyone slowly digest his speech before saying in a strong and sonorous voice, “Finally, I would like to make it clear once more that we have never deliberately done anything with the mentality of causing a company to go bankrupt. We stand on the side of the country and its people to ensure the implementation of legal regulations. All citizens of Harken, please believe in the fairness and justice of the Sanders!”
