At King-T Nightclub.

It was 11:00 pm, the busiest time of the night.

Finn sat on the sofa and poured himself a glass of wine.

Nox asked casually, “Where did you go?”

Finn did not answer and continued drinking.

“You went to find Monica?”

Finn still did not answer.

Nonetheless, he drank differently than usual.

“Finn.” Nox held his hand. “Aren’t you going to work tomorrow?”

Drinking so boldly was not Finn’s style at all.

“I’m taking a break tomorrow,” Finn said.

Nox still wanted to say something.

In the private room, Monica and Michael came back together.

Michael walked toward Eden.

Monica walked toward Finn. “Where’s Jeannie?”

Finn ignored Monica. He did not even look at her.

Monica really wanted to smash the wine bottle in front of her on this man’s head.

Nox said, “After Fourth Master Swan and Ms. Sanders went out, Ms. Lawrence went out as well.”

“She didn’t come back?” Monica was surprised.

“No.”

Monica quickly called Jeanne.

At this moment, Jeanne was sitting in the car. She looked at the incoming call and picked it up. “Monica, I’m leaving first.”

“Why are you leaving? Where’s Fourth Master Swan?”

Jeanne glanced at the man next to her. “He’s sending me home.”

Monica, who was initially a little angry, instantly beamed with joy. She said, “Then you should go back earlier. You’ve worked so hard. You must rest well.”

Jeanne was a little speechless.

The speed at which Monica’s mood changed was too astonishing.

Jeanne said, “Help me tell Finn that I’m sorry for coming in a hurry and leaving in a hurry without wishing him a happy birthday.”

“Birthdays happen every year. It’s not a big deal. Don’t feel guilty. Go home happily with Fourth Master.” Monica smiled brightly.

Monica was a frank but not tactful person.

She did not try to avoid suspicion when she called.

In short, everyone could hear what she said.

Nox turned to look at Finn.

Monica’s indifference toward Finn could be seen with the naked eye.

“Birthdays happen every year. It’s not a big deal...” Birthdays did come and go every year, but this was Finn’s 30th birthday.

At this moment, the door of the private room was pushed open by the waiter, and Melody entered.

There was no emotion to be seen on her face. It was as if she had not experienced anything just now.

She said to Michael, “Send me back.”

Michael put down his wine glass and stood up. “Okay.”

“I’ll go with you guys,” Eden quickly said as well.

Michael nodded.

The moment he nodded, he glanced at Monica.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

Since she had promised to give Michael a chance, the relationship between the two of them had become a little more affectionate now.

Michael said, “I’ll send Melody back first.”

“Okay.”

“If you stay for long, I’ll come and pick you up later.”

“There’s no need for that,” Monica flatly rejected.

Michael still wanted to say something.

Melody urged him impatiently, “Michael, let’s go.”

Michael smiled at Monica. He, Eden, and Melody left.

Eden had his car, but at this moment, he chose to sit in Michael’s car.

Actually, Eden was able to appear at such an occasion today because Melody was in a bad mood and asked Michael to drink with him. Michael just happened to invite Edem, so the three of them came to the nightclub together and coincidentally met his fourth uncle and the rest. Melody naturally would not let go of such a good opportunity, so she went to his fourth uncle’s private room with a thick skin.

At this moment, it was obvious that Melody was in a bad mood.

Eden took the initiative to ease the atmosphere. “I don’t even know why my fourth uncle would suddenly have a relationship with Jeanne. Everyone knows what kind of person Jeanne is. Not only was she too unruly a few years ago, but she was also chased out of the house by her father. At that time, she was a big joke in upper-class society. Later on, when she went abroad, she had an illegitimate child and was extremely indecent. I don’t even know what my fourth uncle is thinking.”

When Melody heard Eden’s words, her mood became even worse.

The words “worse than a broken shoe” kept echoing in her mind!

Ever since she was young, when had she ever been insulted like this by others?

“Personally, I feel that my fourth uncle doesn’t really like Jeanne. At most, Jeanne’s looks aren’t bad, so perhaps my fourth uncle was momentarily bewitched...” Eden seemed to be nonchalant as he continued to speak.

“How can I make your fourth uncle break up with Jeanne?!” Melody suddenly spoke. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Eden looked at her. “Break up? I’m afraid my fourth uncle hasn’t established a relationship with Jeanne yet.”

“I don’t care. I want to ask you now. How can I make your fourth uncle and Jeanne not be together?!” Melody’s expression was very ugly.

Eden thought for a moment and said, “Let Jeanne’s reputation be ruined once again.”

Melody frowned.

“If Jeanne’s reputation is ruined, given my fourth uncle’s identity, he wouldn’t want her anymore. More importantly, she’s useless. My grandfather wouldn’t let my fourth uncle marry Jeanne.”

“What should we do?” Melody was straightforward.

“Jeanne is now in the Lawrence Enterprise, trying to wash away her bad reputation in the business world. Our first step now is to drive Jeanne out of the enterprise and stop her from doing that. After that, we’ll do the rest.”

“Isn’t that very simple?” Melody sneered. “You’re the great young master of the Swans. Can’t you do that?”

“Why not? I just don’t want to ruin my reputation because of Jeanne. It’s not worth it. So, it’s not convenient to go against her in public. Sometimes, things in the dark are more difficult to handle.”

“If there’s anything I can help you with, just say it. As long as you can get Jeanne out of Edward’s sight!”

“Okay.” Eden quickly agreed, a sinister smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

‘Jeanne is such an ungrateful woman. Did she really think that she could turn her life upside down just because she hooked up with my fourth uncle?!

‘I have 10,000 ways to make her suffer!’

Eden and Michael first sent Melody back to the Sanders Residence before driving back.

Michael said to Eden, “The matter between Melody and your fourth uncle will depend on you.”

“Leave it to me.” Eden was confident.

Michael nodded.

This was also the reason he let Melody and Eden get to know each other.

“Oh right, your feelings for Monica can’t be real, right?” Eden suddenly asked.

Michael’s hands that were holding the steering wheel tightened.

“That woman doesn’t have many abilities. Other than being crazy, she won’t help your career at all. Your future is bright now. Don’t be held back by her,” Eden reminded him seriously.

Michael responded, “It won’t affect me.”

“Didn’t your parents reject Monica?” Eden frowned. “Even if your parents compromise, given your status, you should at least marry someone from the Sanders. You’d be showing Monica favor if you marry her.”

“I know what I’m doing.”

Eden glanced at Michael and did not say anything more.

He knew what kind of person Michael was.

If Michael was not a career-minded person who had ambitions for his future, he would not have compromised to his parents’ pressure to break up with Monica back then.

Eden also did not believe that Michael would do anything for Monica.

Michael would certainly be in power in the future.

Eden, of course, wanted to cling to him!
