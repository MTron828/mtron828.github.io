1185 In The Nick of Time, Jeanne and Edward Meet

Jeanne did not know what she was feeling at the moment, nor did she know what she should feel.

She even thought that what Finn meant just now was that she would leave South Hampton City and Harken and never contact them ever again.

She really did not expect that Edward would give up everything to look for her.

“Jeanne, don’t let Fourth Master down,” Finn said sincerely.

Finn had never been a talkative person, but at that moment, he could not help but say something.

Jeanne did not answer because she did not know how to answer. She did not even know how to face the strong feelings Edward had for her.

After experiencing so much…

“Teddy, land,” Finn suddenly ordered.

Jeanne turned her head and looked out of the helicopter window. They had already arrived at South Hampton City.

Teddy barely managed to descend the helicopter and lower the ladder.

Finn said, “You’ll have to rely on yourself for the rest!”

Jeanne nodded before turning to look at the pale Nox. After that, she turned back and walked toward the ladder. “Goodbye, Finn.”

Right, it was goodbye, and they might never see each other again!

As soon as Jeanne got off the helicopter, the helicopter hovered in the sky and left.

Jeanne did not dare to waste any more time. She immediately took out her car keys and pressed the unlock button.

At that moment, a black car lit up.

She quickly got into the car and called Mason while driving.

Mason quickly picked up the call. His voice sounded agitated. “Jeanne.”

“We’re leaving South Hampton City now and returning to the Delta Islands.”

“Where are you?”

“I’ll give you the location, and you can meet up with me.”

“Yes.”

“How many casualties did the Hills suffer?”

“There are still some left. I’ll inform them to leave.”

“No rush.” Jeanne said, “After we leave safely, inform them to evacuate. Don’t alert the enemy.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Understood.”

“Be careful,” Jeanne warned.

“You, too.”

After hanging up the phone, Jeanne drove straight to the escape route that Kingsley had left for her.

When he had first come to Harken, Kingsley was prepared to be defeated and had made preparations to escape.

That day, when Kingsley was being hunted down, he told Mason to take her away because he was sure that Jeanne could escape.

However, she chose to return halfway.

Now, she had finally chosen to leave, or did she choose to walk on the path Kingsley had laid out for her?

She was driving a little fast.

Finn was right. She was no longer safe in Harken. Once Alex caught her, she would end up like the rest of the Sanders — dead.

She readjusted her emotions and parked the car by the side of the road.

Then, the door to the front passenger seat opened, and Mason sat in the front passenger seat.

Now that the two of them had successfully met up, the next step was to go to the destination and leave Harken.

The car was still moving at a high speed, and no one spoke or ask about each other’s physical condition. In any case, anything was fine as long as they were alive.

Jeanne quickly parked the car at their destination, a private airport in South Hampton City.

It was a piece of land that Kingsley had bought anonymously in South Hampton City and built into a private airport. Other than Kingsley’s plane, other people’s private planes were also parked there. At least when mixed together, the Sanders had not discovered the existence of Kingsley’s private airport. Therefore, in the Sanders’ eyes, Kingsley had always used the airport they provided to come to South Hampton City. That way, it was impossible for him to leave so easily under their watch.

Of course, no one else knew about Kingsley’s private airport other than her and Kingsley.

It was only because Jeanne had brought him there that Mason knew of such a place to leave Harken.

Once the car was parked, Jeanne and Mason did not waste any time and walked straight into the airport.

The airport had layers of security checks, and all they needed was Jeanne’s facial recognition.

It did not take long before they arrived in front of a private plane and were about to board it

“I was almost too late!” A man’s voice suddenly sounded from behind them.

Jeanne and Mason were stunned.

Perhaps the two of them were so focused on leaving that they did not have time to care about anything else, or perhaps they did not expect to be followed so quickly, so they did not notice when a group of people appeared behind them.

The two of them quickly took out their guns and aimed at the person, William Gates, who had appeared with a group of people.
