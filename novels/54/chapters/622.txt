Chapter 623: The Cause of Jeanne’s Mother’s Death Revealed (Must Read)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jeanne, dreaming on! Do you think you can obtain the Lawrences’ assets just because you schemed against your father and sent him to prison? Do you think I’ve been living in the Lawrences for nothing all these years? I advise you not to have any ill intentions!”

“So what if I did? What can you do to me, mother?” Jeanne did not take Jenifer’s threat seriously at all. “If you have the power, I should’ve been chased out of the family long ago. How could I still show off what I can do in Lawrence Enterprise?”

She sounded like she was mocking Jenifer for being useless.

“Jeanne!” Jenifer was so angry that her face turned pale.

“Mother.” The corner of Jeanne’s mouth curled into a smile. That smug smile made Jenifer, who had mastery in seeing through people, almost go crazy. “I’m the one who should advise you not to have any ill intentions. Look at Jasmine and your grandfather. Both of them wanted to harm me, yet they eventually ruined it for themselves. I don’t want the same thing to happen to you!”

“You’re finally admitting that you planned everything, huh? You purposely set Jasmine and my grandfather up!”

“Why does it matter whether I admit it or not?” Jeanne still had a smile on her face, and it became increasingly colder. “All you need to know is that you can’t win against me.”

“Don’t threaten me here!”

“If you don’t believe me, try it,” Jeanne said. Then, not wanting to waste her breath on these people anymore, she said to Finn, “Let’s go.”

Finn nodded, and the two of them left the Lawrences’ cemetery.

After they left, Jenifer could no longer hold back the rage she was feeling.

Joshua was also so angry that he gritted his teeth. “Who does Jeanne think she is? What gives her the right to act so high and mighty in front of us?”

Jenifer’s expression was extremely ugly.

Eden looked at the mother and son.

He knew well at this point in time that the person who would be the head of the Lawrences was basically set.

The family would definitely fall into Jeanne’s control in the end.

At the thought of that woman who looked down on everything and acted so high and mighty, he could not stand it either!

He said, “If you still believe me, I can help you with this matter regarding Jeanne.”

Jenifer looked at Eden and did not believe him.

At the same time, Joshua also looked at him.

It was not that he did not believe Eden, but they did not have the upper hand even after scheming against Jeanne so many times!

Eden’s powers seemed mediocre at best.

Eden said, “I need time to get over Jasmine’s matter. I didn’t choose to divorce her because I think we still have feelings for each other, but I’d be lying to say that there is a distance between us. All I can say is that I’ll try my best to readjust my state of mind.”

When Jasmine heard what Eden said, she was stunned.

She looked straight at Eden. Then, she looked at her mother, telling her with her eyes not to trust Eden, that cold-blooded and heartless man.

However, she did not dare to say anything because she was afraid that if she did, Eden would beat her to death when they returned home.

She looked anxious, but her mother did not even spare her a glance.

Jenifer also needed someone to rely on now.

Once Alexander was dead, she could not rely on Joshua alone. If Eden could help, it would no doubt be the best choice at the moment.

Even so, she did not express it immediately. Instead, she said, “I originally planned to take Jasmine home after all this. As to what she did, whether it was her fault or not, it has ultimately brought shame to you. I know that very well. Even if you don’t want Jasmine anymore, it’s only natural.”

“I have feelings for Jasmine. What she did... Only time can heal the pain. Moreover, after thinking through it recently, I believe that Jasmine was schemed against by Jeanne.”

Jenifer was somewhat persuaded.

“I can’t accept it now because I am a man, after all, but I believe I will be able to let go of it after a while. So, if you and Joshua believe in me, I hope I can lend you a hand in dealing with Jeanne and the matters regarding who will lead the family.”

“How are you going to lend us a hand?” Jenifer asked.

It was obvious that she had accepted Eden’s proposal.

Tears welled up in Jasmine’s eyes.

She knew that once her mother agreed to Eden’s help, the Lawrences would end with two results. One was that the family would still fall into Jeanne’s hands, and Eden had never fought against Jeanne. The other was that after Eden fought against Jeanne, the family would finally fall into Eden’s hands.

There was no way Joshua would be the head of the family.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
