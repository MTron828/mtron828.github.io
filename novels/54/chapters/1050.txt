1051 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

Upon hearing what Michael said, Richie quickly agreed. “Okay. Ms. Cardellini, let me know how much you want to distribute to us. I’ll look at our company’s situation and give you an answer.”

“With Mr. Sanchez’s volume, eight million dollars shouldn’t be a problem.”

“Eight million...” Richie was still hesitant.

Although he was hesitating, he was just listening to Michael’s arrangements.

At that moment, Michael said naturally, “I’m afraid that eight million is a bit difficult for Mr. Sanchez. I think 800 thousand shouldn’t be a problem.”

“Yes, yes. If it’s 800 thousand dollars worth of medicine, I’ll buy them directly in cash. Your father’s help to me back then won’t be in vain,” Richie quickly said.

Drugs worth 800 thousand dollars were a drop in the ocean, but to the current Cardellini Enterprise, it was a lot.

Monica smiled. “800 thousand dollars? That’s so petty of you, Mr. Sanchez.”

“Back then, Ms. Cardellini’s father gave Mr. Sanchez 800 thousand dollars worth of drugs, and now he’s returning the money to you, Ms. Cardellini. Isn’t he just replaying your father’s kindness?” Michael sneered.

“Was 800 million dollars from 20 years ago the same as 800 million dollars 20 years later?

Instead of arguing with Michael, Monica said, “I believe Mr. Sanchez can weigh it out himself and not listen to other people’s arrangements.”

By saying that, she was obviously mocking Richie.

At that moment, Richie was also a little embarrassed. He said, “Ms. Cardellini, it’s not that I don’t want to help Cardellini Enterprise, but I’ve just negotiated a billion-dollar collaboration with Sunny Pharmaceutical. I really don’t have any extra money to help Cardellini Enterprise. We’re all businessmen here. It’s true that I received help from your father back then, but at the end of the day, we’re all looking out for our own interests. Now, you’re asking me to fork out money to save Cardellini Enterprise? I think you know Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation, and I can’t afford to go down with you.”

Monica looked at Richie coldly.

Richie continued, “Actually, I would like to give Ms. Cardellini a suggestion. Now that Ms. Cardellini has declared bankruptcy, Cardellini Enterprise can still save some things for themselves. If you persist, you will really go bankrupt.”

“Mr. Sanchez, you don’t have to worry about that.” Monica downright rejected his suggestion. “Since you can’t lend a helping hand, I won’t make things difficult for you. After all, businessmen only care about their own interests. I’ll do the same once I climb up the ladder one day.”

She meant that it was best not to let her make a comeback. If she made a comeback, she would also want those people to die a horrible death.

As she stood up from her seat, her body fell backward, but Steve quickly supported her.

She had drunk a lot of wine just now, so she was feeling very dizzy.

Monica steadied herself. “In that case, I won’t disturb everyone’s fun. I’ll take my leave first.”

“Monica,” Michael called out to her.

However, Monica pretended not to hear him.

She could talk to anyone else, but with Michael, she would not let herself suffer for even a second.

“Monica!” Seeing that Monica did not react to him, Michael’s voice became colder.

Even so, Monica ignored him.

“If you’re smart, you’ll be able to tell who’s in charge of today’s situation.” Michael’s voice was deep.

Monica left with Steve.

She was not so stupid as to ask for trouble from Michael.

The moment Monica walked out of the private room, somebody suddenly grabbed her body.

Monica gritted her teeth.

Steve watched as Michael pulled Monica away and immediately wanted to go up to get Monica back.

“Mr. Warren, wait for me at the side!” Monica called out to him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

They were in Michael’s territory, and she did not want to cause any unnecessary trouble.

She especially did not want to implicate others.

Michael looked at Monica coldly and dragged her to another private room.

It was a private room as luxurious as the one before, but there was no one else inside.

Michael said, “Monica, you’ve persisted for so long. Isn’t that enough? Don’t you know what you’re capable of by now?”

Monica just looked at him coldly.

“Why do you have to fight with me? Do you think you can win?” Michael was furious. “Look at yourself. Look at how you’ve tortured yourself! Having sex with people, drinking with people, and you’re stick-thin! When I was holding your wrist, I thought I was holding a dried corpse! Monica, haven’t you had enough of this? I don’t want to kill you.”
