Chapter 1405: Are You Saying Zoe Is Lying To Me?

Thank you readers!

For a second, she had the urge to push open the door of the private room and show him what was happening inside.

Yet now, she was a little hesitant as she felt like she was meddling in other people’s business.

“Are you crazy?” Nox suddenly turned around and scolded Shelly, “You were the one who called my name. Why aren’t you speaking?”

Nox had no patience for her. In fact, he was even a little annoyed. It was as if her existence had provoked him.

“What I want to say is, don’t worry. No matter how bad my life is, I won’t pester you anymore,” Shelly said.

She decided not to meddle in other people’s business. Besides, Nox would not appreciate it even if she did show concern for him.

She had a feeling that if Nox knew she had seen his fiancée having an affair with someone else, he might even kill her.

Therefore, why did she have to get involved in that mess? If Nox could find out, great; if he could not, he would just be cheated on.

Anyway, he had fooled around with many women, so what his fiancée was doing now was just an eye for an eye.

“Shelly, you better keep your word!”

When Nox heard Shelly’s words, he was about to burst with anger. However, he suppressed his emotions and said through gritted teeth.

“Alright.” Shelly agreed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Then, Nox strode away.

Shelly could see that Nox was furious, but she was not surprised. In her memories, Nox was always like that.

Nox quickly returned to the private room, picked up her phone, and left.

The moment he left, the door of the private room in front of Shelly was suddenly opened. Zoe and the man walked out, still very intimate with each other.

Shelly looked at Nox’s back from the corner of her eye. If Nox had turned around at that moment, he would be able to see an exciting scene. However, he left without looking back, missing out on the perfect opportunity to discover the truth.

“I’m leaving,” Zoe said coquettishly to the man.

“Must you leave so early?”

“You know I have to go back to be with Nox.”

“Can you still go back and accompany him in this state?” the man said lewdly.

At that moment, their reluctance to part somehow seemed erotic.

“If you weren’t so rude just now…” Zoe blushed. “If you do this again, I won’t hang out with you anymore.”

“Isn’t that what you like about me?”

As he spoke, the man wanted to get closer to Zoe.

However, Zoe refused. “Be serious. We can’t be discovered.”

“Don’t you like the thrill-”

Zoe’s expression suddenly changed, and the man also noticed Zoe’s expression. Hence, he looked up, only to see a woman looking at them.

Everyone knew that woman. In the business world, other than Nox, she was probably the most famous.

“Monica.” Panic flashed across Zoe’s face for a second.

She looked at Monica who had suddenly appeared and quickly took the initiative to greet her warmly.

Monica glanced at the man beside Zoe before shifting her gaze to Zoe.

Zoe smiled calmly. “What a coincidence.” “Yes, what a coincidence.” Monica nodded.

“Are you having dinner here too?” “Yes.” Monica said, “Nox is here too.”

Panic flashed across Zoe’s eyes.

“Really? He didn’t tell me that he was also having dinner here.” Zoe acted very naturally. “Is he with you? Is he still here? I’ll go find him.”

“No, Nox was with Finn, and I just happened to bump into Nox.” Monica replied, “Nox said you were having dinner with your colleagues today.”

“Oh, yeah.” Zoe quickly said, “Nox asked me out tonight, but I rejected him because I had already made arrangements with my colleague. I felt bad, so I wanted to end it early and go back to accompany him. But because I drank, I got him to send me off.”

She openly introduced the man beside her.

Shelly really admired Zoe’s acting skills. Had it been anyone else, bumping into someone else in that situation would have scared them to death.

However, Zoe’s performance was so natural. If Shelly had not seen what had happened between Zoe and the man with her own eyes, she would have believed that Zoe and that man were just friends.

“Nox should’ve just left.” Monica said, “You can give him a call.”

“Alright, thank you.” Zoe smiled.

She kept her image as a daughter from an upper-class family and made herself seem well-mannered..
