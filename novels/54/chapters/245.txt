Chapter 246: Jeanne Escapes From Non-stop Danger

The person who answered the phone was not Finn; it was a lady. “Hello, I’m Dr. Jones’ assistant. Dr. Jones is currently treating a patient who had a sudden heart attack and is in the operating room. If you have any…”

Monica put down the phone.

There seemed to be no chemistry between her and Finn.

In fact, she did not blame Finn.

As a doctor, Finn should save patients.

He was different from others. He had a sense of responsibility, so it was impossible for him to be on call for her.

Besides...

That was not the kind of relationship they had.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She was trying to keep herself calm.

She told herself that the most important thing at this moment was to help Jeanne.

That way, Jeanne would be out of danger.

‘Right, Fourth Master Swan!’

Monica called Fourth Master Swan.

The phone rang, but no one picked up.

Monica called Nox instead.

Unexpectedly, no one picked up as well.

Monica broke down completely.

Why was Fourth Master Swan not around every time something happened to Jeanne?!

If something happened to Jeanne…

Monica began to cry like crazy.

When she thought about how Jeanne had just been chased by someone… If something happened to her...

At this moment, it seemed that Monica could only look for Micheal. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She dialed a number.

The call was connected after just one ring.

Micheal’s slightly groggy voice sounded as if he had fallen asleep.

At this moment, when Micheal saw Monica’s call, he sounded concerned. “Monica, you’re calling me so late at night. Did something happen?”

“Micheal, Jeannie is in trouble!” The moment Monica spoke, she started crying like she had gone mad.

On the other side, Micheal was obviously shocked as well. “Monica, calm down. What happened? Don’t panic. Where are you? Where are you? I’ll go find you right away.”

Micheal was a little agitated.

“I-I’m... I’ll share you my location. Micheal, can you help me call the police? Jeanne is being chased by someone.”

“Okay, I’ll help you call the police. Share me your location first. I’ll go find you right away.”

“Okay.”

Monica hung up the phone and sent the location to Micheal.

Micheal casually got dressed and left the house.

Actually, when Monica said that Jeanne was in trouble, he thought that it was Melody’s doing.

‘Why can’t Melody learn from her mistakes?

‘If she does this, she’ll be courting death!’

Micheal called Eden directly.

Eden naturally did not sleep tonight.

He sat in the Swans’ courtyard and smoked. From time to time, he would receive information about the situation that happened tonight.

When he saw Micheal’s call, he paused.

Melody had told him not to tell Micheal about this.

That was because Micheal’s opinion was to let things settle down first and think about the long-term.

However, Eden and Melody could not swallow their anger.

They had to make Jeanne suffer!

Eden took a deep breath and answered the call. “Micheal.”

“What are you and Melody doing?!” Micheal’s voice was filled with anger.

Eden did not reply.

“Do you know that you’re taking a risk now? If you don’t succeed, you’ll bring about your own destruction! Chief had personally instructed Melody not to go against Jeanne, but she’s still doing things her way. It’ll be fine if Jeanne dies, but if she doesn’t, do you know how severe the consequences would be for Melody to disobey Chief’s order?”

“Chief is Melody’s father. No matter what—”

“It’s risky to stay by the side of a powerful person!” Micheal said word by word and continued, “Melody has done many things that enrage Chief just because she’s Chief’s daughter. This is going to be the last straw before Chief ignores their family ties. If Chief finds out, Melody will die without a doubt!”

Eden was obviously frightened by Micheal.

“Eden, I’m only telling you so much because I take you as a friend. I advise you to let go now and stop helping Melody do things. She has lost her mind. Besides, I can clearly see from this matter that her future development won’t be good! She’s too eager to be powerful. She didn’t learn to be shrewd as a political authority. Even if it’s not because of Jeanne, she’d still be killed by her other brothers and sisters. She’s not worth our lives anymore!”

Eden gripped his phone tightly.

“Listen to my advice,” Micheal said and hung up the phone.

Micheal could indeed see it clearly now.

All of Melody’s assets came from the chief’s love for her. In reality, she was not that capable. Not only that, but she also did not hide her competitiveness. She could not accept any failure. It would make her die very quickly!

Micheal had given up on Melody.

Hence, during this period, when Melody looked for Micheal, he would find an excuse to reject her. He even tried to persuade her to stop fighting with Jeanne. It was all to make her hold a grudge against him so that the distance between them would grow further.

Micheal did not want to be dragged down by Melody!

Nonetheless, he did not expect that Melody would be so impulsive to such an extent.

How long had it been? She had started to attack Jeanne again!

She even dragged Eden along.

Of course, Micheal was not trying to take into account the friendship between him and Eden.

In their living environment, no friendship was more important than benefits.

Micheal only felt that Eden still had value.

It was not worth it for Eden to fall together with Melody.

Micheal had a lot of things that he needed Eden to do for him in the future.

He gritted his teeth and quickly drove to the location that Monica had sent her.

…

Jeanne got rid of Monica.

After making sure that the cars behind were coming for her, she stepped on the accelerator again and sped up on the streets of South Hampton City.

As she was fast and there were no brakes, Jeanne did not even have the time to call for help.

Even so, she was not too anxious.

She believed that after Monica called Finn, Finn would go to look for Fourth Master Swan.

If Fourth Master Swan came to look for her…

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She admitted that at this moment, she had hope for Fourth Master Swan.

Her eyes moved slightly.

She watched as the four black cars behind her got closer.

Jeanne kept driving forward, entering the city area and heading toward the outskirts of the city.

She did not have the time to choose which way to go.

Jeannie just kept driving forward.

She just kept driving, not letting the people behind her catch up.

Her speed became faster.

In front of her was a relatively narrow country road.

The road was curved.

It made Jeanne drive with some difficulty.

After all, she was not familiar with the road.

She was also afraid that—

All of a sudden, Jeanne’s body tensed up.

She saw a large truck suddenly appear in front of her. A dazzling headlight directly blurred her vision.

Jeanne quickly grabbed the steering wheel and suddenly made a big turn to the side.

It was a sharp turn.

The road was very narrow, and the guardrail at the bottom was very low.

Jeannie’s car was very fast.

With a single impact, the guardrail was directly broken.

Once it was broken, the car directly rushed down from the guardrail.

Below was a steep slope. The car could not control itself as it slid along the steep slope. At this moment, due to the impact, the car had completely lost control, and even the steering wheel was useless.

Jeanne just watched helplessly at a big rock ahead. She could not avoid it, so the front of the car suddenly crashed into it.

She tried her best to protect her head.

Next, the car rolled and continued to slide downward.

Jeanne heard crackling sounds, and her body was covered with injuries.

She did not know how long it took before the car finally stopped.

Jeanne did not dare to stop. She opened the car door.

The car door was locked.

She gritted her teeth.

With one push from her elbow, she smashed the car window that was already somewhat broken into pieces.

Jeanne climbed out of the driver’s seat.

She climbed out covered in blood.

The moment she climbed out, she heard the sounds of footsteps from her surroundings. They quickly ran toward her!
