She looked very serious, and it made him tense up instantly.

Shelly, on the other hand, was not as overwhelmed as Nox. She just thought that Nox was sweating a lot, and it seemed that a piece of tissue was not enough. After she was done with one tissue, she took another one to wipe off the sweat on his face. She figured he had worked hard today.

However, she felt there was something wrong with Nox’s gaze after a while. The way he looked at her seemed to be filled with emotions, so her eyes flickered and met his gaze. The moment their eyes met, Nox instantly shifted his gaze.

To avoid awlwardness, he said, “I didn’t expect a kindergarten sports game to be so tiring. I sweated a lot.”

Shelly was also calming herself down, but her heart was still beating irregularly.

She quietly put her hand down and said, “It’s almost time.”

“Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

The two of them were very distant and still a little awkward with each other. Fortunately, the teacher had the parents who were participating in the relay race prepare to walk to the field. With that, Nox followed the group and prepared to go over.

“Daddy,” Bella suddenly called out to him.

Nox stopped in his tracks and looked at Bella.

Bella ran to his side with her short legs and tugged at the corner of his shirt.

“Daddy, bend down.”

Although Nox was surprised, he still bent down.

Seeing that Nox had bent down, Bella quickly leaned over and kissed Nox on the cheek. “Daddy, you can do it!”

Bella’s words warmed Nox’s heart.

He patted Bella’s head. “Alright, Daddy will get you first place.”

“I love you, Daddy.”

“I love you, too.” Nox also kissed Bella on the cheek.

Then, he stood up to leave, but Bella pulled back again.

“Mommy hasn’t cheered for you yet,” Bella said to the nearby Shelly, who was stunned when she heard Bella.

“Mommy, come here,” Bella called out to her anxiously. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Shelly walked over.

“Mommy, you need to cheer Daddy on too!” Bella said, “My teacher said that our parents worked the hardest in today’s sports games, so we have to encourage them. Since Daddy has worked so hard, you have to encourage Daddy too. ”

Shelly glanced at Nox, who also looked at Shelly. The two of them remained silent for a few seconds.

Nox said, “Mommy has encouraged me. I will do my best.”

“No, she didn’t.” Bella was rather angry.

Generally speaking, when Bella was angry, she was truly unhappy. Considering Bella was not a child who would easily throw tantrums, Shelly gritted her teeth and suddenly approached Nox. After all, today was Bella’s sports day, and she could not make Bella unhappy. Hence, she went forward and planned to kiss Nox’s cheek.

The two of them did not have a pure, innocent relationship. Even if they had a huge conflict between them, they would sleep together. Especially now that they were getting along peacefully, sleeping together was a normal thing. The only difference today was that they were in public. Fortunately, many families were doing the same thing, so no one was surprised.

As Shelly’s lips moved closer, Nox was actually looking at Bella with his head lowered. However, when he felt that Shelly was close to him, he raised his head and turned his face slightly, causing Shelly’s kiss, which was supposed to land on Nox’s cheek, to land on his lips.

Shocked by the sudden turn of events, Shelly quickly pulled away while Nox could not help but lick his lips. It made Shelly so embarrassed that she blushed and did not look at him for another second.

“Mommy cneatea,” Bella complamea.

Shelly frowned. Today, Bella seemed unusually lively.

“I kissed Daddy’s face, but Mommy kissed Daddy’s lips. Mommy cheated.” Bella was still rather unhappy.

It was as if she had received unfair treatment.

“I want to kiss Daddy’s lips too,” Bella requested.

Nox smiled and comforted her. “Be good. I have to go on stage now. Wait for me to bring you back the trophy.”

“Alright.” Bella was, after all, a little kid. As such, she was easily distracted. Nox patted Bella’s head and strode toward the group. The others were outside the arena, watching the ceremony.

Bella held Shelly’s hand, excited and nervous. Her eyes were fixed on Nox, and she would occasionally call out, “Daddy, you can do it.”

Shelly, on the other hand, seemed much calmer. In fact, she was in a daze and could not help but purse her lips..
