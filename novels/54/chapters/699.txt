There were some things that once compromised, she would always compromise again, and she could not compromise all the time.

Whether it was to do it for Finn or she really did not like Michael, she still had to leave Michael!

Instead of saying something, Michael forced himself to smile. “In that case, I’m leaving.”

“Okay,” Monica replied calmly.

As Michael walked out of her house, she still felt a little uncomfortable.

It was really hard to reject someone so directly and hurt someone who treated her well. However, she really did not want to repeat the same mistake.

It hurt too much this time.

She did not even know if she would be able to walk out of this pain alive.

...

In Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was sitting in the president’s office, with the door tightly shut.

Jeanne was on the phone with Miles.

“Someone was following Finn’s every move last night?” Jeanne asked.

Ever since she suggested to Monica to probe Michael, Jeanne had gotten Miles to protect Monica in the dark.

“Yes. Last night, Monica returned to the Cardellini family’s villa, so I waited outside the villa to see if she would leave. I would only leave when I confirm that she was staying. However, I discovered a suspicious person around the villa. That person lingered outside the villa for a long time until Finn left the villa, and he followed Finn.”

“You didn’t follow Finn.”

“No. Didn’t you ask me to protect Monica?”

The fixed thinking of an assassin really caused Jeanne to break down at this moment.

“Moreover, Monica left the Cardellini family’s villa in a hurry less than an hour after Finn left. I quickly followed her and watched as Monica walked into Imperial Luxury Hotel, but she didn’t leave until just now. However, during that time, no suspicious people appeared. The point in question is that after Monica left the hotel, Finn also left. It seemed that the two of them had gotten a room there the night before,” Miles explained.

Jeanne frowned.

At that moment, she was naturally stunned. She had already told Monica not to test Finn like that, but Monica still did not trust her.

Hold on. Jeanne had a feeling that something was wrong.

What Miles meant was that when Monica suddenly went to the hotel, Finn did not go with her, which implied that Finn had gone ahead of time. Did Monica go because she received the news that Finn had gone?

Her thoughts were a mess.

She listened to Miles explain, “You told me to protect Monica, and I did. However, I just have a feeling that something was up with the man who was following Finn. That is why I reported it to you. Do you think I should investigate who that person is? According to my experience, that person might be a danger to Monica.”

“Investigate.” Jeanne was very certain. “Not only investigate but also catch that person. I need some evidence.”

At that moment, Jeanne was almost certain that the person was Michael’s man, and the incident of Finn sleeping with Monica last night should not be a coincidence.

During that time, something must have happened, and there was no need to guess.

After Jeanne hung up the phone, she immediately called Monica. However, Monica’s phone... was turned off.

Jeanne frowned.

After thinking for a while, she called Finn’s number.

Finn picked up the call, and there was no emotion in his tone. “Jeanne.”

“Did you sleep with Monica last night?” she asked immediately.

There was no need to be tactful.

“I did,” Finn said.

“Are you willing–”

“I’m not,” Finn said bluntly. “Last night, I was plotted against by Monica’s cousin.”

Jeanne was a little surprised.

Hence, Finn briefly told Jeanne what happened yesterday.

Then, she said, “It’s impossible for Monica and I to be together again.”

“I’m not trying to mediate your and Monica’s relationship.” Jeanne made her position clear.

Finn remained silent.

“Regarding Monica abandoning you to help Michael, I don’t agree with her actions. I just wanted to tell you that the person who ambushed you may not have been Sarah.”

Finn thought of that as well, but he was not interested in digging deeper into it.

“I don’t trust Michael. I refuse to believe that Michael’s intention toward Monica is innocent, so I secretly got someone to protect Monica. And that person is now telling me that you were followed last night,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

He did not notice it last night.

Monica could really... distract him sometimes.
