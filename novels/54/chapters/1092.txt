1093 Neither of Them Needed The Other Anymore

Richie no longer tried to hide it. “I believe you should know why I’m looking for you.”

Steve was indeed efficient. In just a short while, the news of them refusing to supply to some pharmaceutical companies had been spread.

“Mr. Sanchez, if you have something to say, just say it. I really don’t have that much time to waste with you.” Monica’s face darkened.

Her poise surprised Richie a little.

That night, although Monica’s performance did not match her youthful maturity, she was still lacking in confidence. Moreover, he had always thought that Monica was only 25 years old. How could she really have the ability to manage tens of billions of assets? Now, Monica seemed to have convinced him a little.

He said, “Sunny Pharmaceutical isn’t selling their products now, but we have a few billion in our inventory and want to return it to Sunny Pharmaceutical. Sunny Pharmaceutical has accepted it, but because they’ve declared bankruptcy, we can’t get back the money. Of course, if a business investment fails, so be it. I, Richie, am not someone who can’t afford the loss. However, now that the products in Sunny Pharmaceutical have been seized and Cardellini Pharmaceutical won’t provide us with any drugs, it really is forcing companies like us to die.”

“So, Mr. Sanchez, do you think Cardellini Enterprise is in the wrong for not supplying you with the goods?”

“Monica, you’re still young–”

“When at work, please call me Ms. Cardellini,” Monica interrupted him.

Richie held it in. “Ms. Cardellini, you’re still young. Profits are the most important in the commodity market, and everyone just wants money. I know I didn’t help Cardellini Enterprise out back then and you’re upset about that. So, I’m here to apologize to you. Now that it’s over, let’s not get too involved in personal emotions.”

“What right do you have to say it’s over?!” Monica sneered, “Do you think really think that’s enough after you’ve done something wrong?! If that’s the case, did Michael need to pay the price of death?”

Richie’s face turned red from Monica’s mocking.

“Mr. Sanchez, I, Monica, have my own principles when it comes to doing things, and I don’t think I can live my life knowing that I crossed it. As for the matter of Cardellini Enterprise not supplying you with products, I can tell you clearly again that if we don’t supply the products to you now, we won’t do so in the future! Your name has been removed from Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s trading list, so I hope you don’t waste your breath and waste my time. My time is very precious, and I don’t want to waste it on people like you.”

Her words made the other party feel embarrassed.

Moreover, she did not even give Richie a chance to speak. After she said that, she turned around and left. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Monica!” Richie, who was obviously provoked, grabbed Monica.

Monica’s expression was extremely ugly, and she suddenly pushed Richie away.

She hated anyone touching her, and it was obvious that she was angered.

Richie did not expect Monica to burst like that, but he did not back down. Instead, he shouted at Monica, “If you refuse to supply us now, do you think Cardellini Enterprise can develop? If your products can’t be sold, can Cardellini Enterprise still survive in the future?”

“You don’t have to worry about that, Mr. Sanchez. I know how to solve the Cardellini Enterprise’s problem.”

“Monica, I’m not threatening you. But since you’re so ruthless now, I can also unite all the pharmaceutical companies in Harken to boycott your drugs. Then, we’ll just fight to the death. Who’s afraid of who?”

“Sure.” Monica gave the other party a definite answer. “Coincidentally, I’m still investigating which medicinal material suppliers hit us when we were down. You’d better form an alliance immediately. Then, I’ll know that those people can’t be traded with.”

“You!” Seeing that he could not threaten Monica at all, Richie’s face turned red.

“Mr. Sanchez, take care.” Monica really did not want to waste time with such a person.

With that, she left.

“Monica, since you want to force me to my death, I’ll take you down with me!” Richie was probably forced to the limit.

The fall of Sunny Pharmaceutical had already caused him to lose a large sum of money. Now, his only chance to come back from the dead was the supply from Cardellini Pharmaceutical, but Monica had directly rejected him.

He was furious.
