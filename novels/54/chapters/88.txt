Shelly said that and went back to her room.

Nox’s chick hugged his arm and said coquettishly, “Young Master Winter, does your sister, who isn’t related to you by blood, have improper thoughts about you?”

“I called you here to sleep with me, not for you to gossip. If you say one more word, the sex deal between us tonight will be over.”

The chick quickly shut up again.

All the chicks at the nightclub knew that Young Master Winter was generous and good in bed. They always hoped to be summoned by him and hoped to be summoned by him a few more times. How would they dare to offend him?

The chick said with a smile, “Then let’s start the sex business again.”

Nox glanced at the chick.

After being made fun of by Shelly, he lost most of his interest.

Thinking of the long night, he brought the chick back to his room.

At this moment, Shelly was lying on the bed in her room, listening to the moans coming from the next room.

She got up and closed the bedroom window.

The sounds instantly disappeared.

Shelly lay back on the bed, unable to sleep.

She remembered the first time she saw Nox. At that time, she was only eight years old, and it was her first time entering the Winters.

Shelly was the child bride of the Winters. It was said that a half-immortal told Nox’s fortune and said that he was born with a life in conflict and was prone to bloody disasters. The only way to alleviate the situation was to find a wife who was compatible with his life. He had to raise her by his side since she was young because they were afraid that Nox would die before she reached adulthood.

According to Shelly’s birth data, she was chosen by the half-immortal.

Shelly was not an orphan. She was born in a relatively remote village that was poor and backward. The village took pride in having children, but the more one gave birth, the poorer one became. When Shelly’s parents heard that a rich family had come to buy her, they happily sold her. After all, having one more child or losing one would not make a difference. Moreover, she was a girl. A girl was not favored when she was born. The local people said that they were “money-losing goods”. Sooner or later, a girl would have to get married.

In Shelly’s case, she simply “got married” ahead of time.

She did not blame her parents. Compared to the life of her original family, the Winters gave her a world of difference. Therefore, once she arrived at the Winters, she tried her best to cater to the Winters, hoping to stay forever.

After so many years in the Winters, she studied seriously, followed their arrangements, and was obedient and sensible. Indeed, she catered to the Winters, young and old. The only person she did not cater to was Nox.

Nox did not like her, and it seemed that he did not want to marry her.

Shelly sighed lightly.

She turned around and tried her best to fall asleep.

…

The next day, at the Lawrence Enterprise.

Jeanne sat in the meeting room, going through the proposal for the collaboration with MUK.

After two hours of on-site modification of the proposal, Jeanne finally finalized it. She took the proposal and went to Alexander. The proposal involved costs and expenses, so she had to seek the approval of the person in charge of the company. At the same time, she also had to attend the board decision meeting.

Once she left, one of the project team members, Kelly Waters, walked into Joshua’s office.

“You got it?” Joshua was a little excited.

Kelly held a USB drive in her hand, but she did not take it out for a long time.

Joshua frowned slightly.

Kelly said with some fear, “Deputy Director Lawrence, is this illegal?”

“Illegal? I just want to know if Jeanne is working hard or not. I’m afraid that she’ll ruin our family business!”

“Team Leader Lawrence is quite capable. Under her leadership, we changed three drafts of this proposal, and the final draft is the best I’ve seen after staying at the Lawrence Enterprise for so many years,” Kelly said sincerely.

“That’s why you should let me see it. You also know that Jeanne has always been against me. She won’t let me learn how to make a good draft, so I can only work hard in secret.” Joshua was a little impatient. “Alright, stop talking. Hurry up and give it to me.”

Kelly was still a little hesitant.

Joshua stood up and went over directly. He took the USB from Kelly’s hand. Kelly struggled for a while and then gave up.

He said, “Don’t worry. I won’t mistreat you. Go out.”

Kelly gritted her teeth and walked out in the end.

Joshua hurriedly plugged in the USB and opened the document.

When he looked at the document, he was stunned.

He had never thought that Jeanne only spent ten days writing such a perfect proposal.

From the cooperation between the two sides, to how they would operate online, to offline logistics distribution, to publicity, to marketing, to after-sales. Jeanne even accurately calculated the budget for each transaction, and the profit value was also estimated. If Joshua had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not believe that it was written by Jeanne. It only took her ten days.

Joshua could not have written it even if he had a year.

He was jealous. He quickly called Eden. “Eden.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I’ve got the collaboration proposal between Jeanne and MUK.”

“So fast?” Eden was not praising Joshua’s ability to do things, but that Jeanne’s proposal would come out so quickly.

“Yes, I’ll send it to you.”

“Wait.” Eden said, “Give me the USB flash drive. Don’t leave any traces. I’ll get someone to go and get it right away.”

“Okay.” Joshua nodded and said, “Eden, I feel that Jeanne is really... very strong.”

Eden did not agree.

To him, no matter how strong Jeanne was, how strong could she be?!

He still did not regard her as anything.

It was until Eden received Jeanne’s collaboration proposal. There was a second where he started to doubt himself.

In actuality, Eden had also written a draft proposal. Although the Swan Enterprise did not participate in the collaboration with MUK, in order to prevent Jeanne from developing in the business world, he had secretly found a company to help him compete with the Lawrence Enterprise. Once he got the collaboration, the profits would be split 50-50. This way, he could create his business without relying on the Swans!

No matter what, due to his fourth uncle’s existence, Eden’s status in the Swans had always been low. The Swans were still under the control of his fourth uncle. He did not want to yield to this, so he needed to make his achievements and let the Swans, especially his grandfather, look at him in a new light!

However, at this moment, Eden looked at the proposal and felt as if he had been suddenly hammered. He held a breath in his heart and could not calm down.

He did not believe that it was written by Jeanne.

It was such a mature collaboration case. If one had not really struggled in the business world and was not familiar with the e-commerce industry, one would not have been able to write it.

As for Eden’s case, he had even found an international gunman to write it. In front of this proposal, the things that the gunman wrote were ridiculously low-class.

Eden suppressed his emotions and did not react for a long time.

Fortunately, he was smart enough to have Joshua secretly monitor Jeanne.

Why would he not use such a perfect collaboration case directly?

Whoever used it first would be the winner.

He picked up the phone and quickly dialed. “Ms. Sanders.”

“Eden?”

“Yes. Last night, you said that if there’s anything I need, I can just let you know.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You found a way to get rid of Jeanne already?”

“I need a sum of money.”

Melody frowned slightly.

“A sum of money to get rid of Jeanne completely!”
