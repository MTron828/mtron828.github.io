George quickly grabbed the sandwich, looking as if Teddy wanted to harm him.

However, Teddy looked at George in a daze.

George said, “Enough!”

“Alright.”

George took another bite, and it tasted terrible. He hated eating tomatoes the most, but at that moment, he ate the entire sandwich to not humiliate himself.

His little face twisted from eating the sandwich.

Seeing that George had finished his food, Teddy hurriedly said, “In that case, I’ll ask the kitchen to prepare a sandwich with ketchup for you tomorrow.”

“...”

No. He would never eat a sandwich again in his life.

“Young Master, get ready for school,” Teddy reminded George as he cleaned up the dishes.

George burped. The taste of tomato in his mouth was unbearable.

“I’m going to rinse my mouth.”

“I’ll help you,” Teddy said quickly.

George did not refuse either. He was probably used to Teddy taking care of him so attentively now.

Back then, George hated strangers getting close to him. Other than Kingsley and Jeanne, others would find it difficult to approach him.

Jeanne lowered her head and ate her breakfast while scrolling through some news on her phone. When George and Teddy were walking away, she said, “George is not going to school today. Teddy, help George change into a set of black clothes. I’m bringing him back to the Lawrence family’s manor.”

“Is it because Old Master Lawrence gas passed away?”

“Yes.”

“Alright,” Teddy quickly agreed.

Jeanne nodded and then continued to eat breakfast while reading the news.

On the news, she was indeed being bashed terribly by the media.

They said she was heartless, and not only did they blame Jonathan’s death on her, but they also scolded her for her indifference at Jonathan’s funeral.

Jeanne looked at the news calmly. After all, those gossips, and the premeditated gossips of others, were just a flash in the pan.

Soon, they would be humiliated.

When she was almost done with reading and was about to close the news website, she suddenly saw another piece of news — Monica’s news.

Although it was not very popular, she clicked on it.

The photo was of Monica protecting Jeanne behind her and throwing a fit at Alexander.

The news roughly repeated what happened at the scene and concluded that Monica did not have proper manners. Not only did she address her elders by their first names, but she even had an arrogant attitude.

Such news was not necessarily bad for Monica back then because Monica already had a bad reputation in upper-class society.

It was not that she was bad. It was just that she did not put on airs like the other rich young ladies, and so, she was seen as an anomaly.

Yet now, she and Michael were a thing.

Michael had to keep a positive image. Considering that, Monica’s actions were a little inappropriate. Some people even wrote very bluntly in the comments below that Monica was not worthy of Michael.

Jeanne still felt something when she saw that comment, but she was calmer than Monica.

Instead of calling Monica right away to tell her, she would calm down and think about what to do next that would be more beneficial to her.

With that, she put down her phone and decided to concentrate on eating her breakfast.

Meanwhile, in the office of the quality inspection department’s director, Michael received a call from his mother, Reese. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Reese sounded a little angry on the phone. “Someone called me today to say that Monica and Jeanne went to the Lawrences’ house last night and caused a ruckus. They were very unruly, and the news is out. Monica doesn’t carry herself like a rich young lady at all.”

“Mom.” Michael’s tone was unpleasant. “It’s best that you don’t interfere with Monica’s and my affair.”

“I’m not trying to interfere, and it’s not that I don’t want to accept Monica either. In any case, the president personally handpicked Monica. Even if I don’t like Monica, I won’t separate the two of you. I’m just reminding you to tell Monica to watch herself and not ruin the positive image that our family has had for so many years.”

“I know what to do.”

“I don’t understand why the president has taken a fancy to Monica.” Upon hearing his son’s reply, Reese still felt a little uncomfortable about it. “Since he thinks so highly of you, why won’t he marry his daughter to you? There’s Quinn and Stacey. Why can’t one of them marry you? Why does he insist on giving you Monica, the most unreliable one.”

“He has his selfish motives too.” Michael could see it clearly.

“What selfish motives?” Reese asked.

“If he wants to regain control of the economy and manage it by himself, he naturally has to control the current large fortune group. The Cardellinis own the largest enterprise other than the Snows, and their line of work is related to pharmaceutical products. Once they rebel, it will easily cause huge unrest. Therefore, he has to have all of the Cardellinis technology,” Michael explained, “The second reason is that he’s wary of me. He’s afraid that if I become too powerful, I will affect the Sanders’ power. That is why he will not consider marrying his daughter to me.”
