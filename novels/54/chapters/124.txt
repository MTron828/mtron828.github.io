Chapter 125: Ms. Lawrence, Can You Show More Sincerity?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Just as she was feeling a little strange, someone knocked on the office door.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She tried her best to adjust herself.

She was actually very glad. After all these years of training, she could be indifferent to anything she encountered in the next second.

“Come in.”

Forrest pushed the door open and entered. “Director Lawrence.”

“You’re back from the logistics warehouse.”

“Yes.” Forrest sat directly opposite Jeanne.

He knew that she did not have the habit of taking lunch breaks, so he came straight back to report himself.

“How’s the progress of the construction?”

“It’s not bad. But…” Forrest’s expression was a little solemn, “When I went to the scene today, I accidentally heard the people over there say that a large outdoor amusement park will be built around our logistics warehouse. It’s said that the planning bureau just came over and took a look at the site.”

Jeanne frowned.

“I was wondering if the construction of this large outdoor amusement park would affect the transportation of our logistics warehouse. Based on experience, the flow of people in an amusement park would skyrocket during weekends or holidays.”

“It would definitely affect it.” Jeanne gave her affirmation. “Did you hear about the planning of an amusement park over there?”

“I didn’t hear about it. It’s relatively remote over there, and it’s not within the scope of the city’s planning. I also went over there a few days ago, but I didn’t hear anything about it. When I went over today, I heard the locals saying that the planning bureau would be coming over early this morning.” Forrest paused and continued. “Since it’s still just in planning, Director Lawrence, do you want to go ask the executive general manager to go to the administrative office? Perhaps, he can communicate with them so that it won’t affect us when the time comes?”

Jeanne did not say anything.

The phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne looked at the incoming call.

Under normal circumstances, Alexander would usually be taking a nap around this time.

For him to be giving her a call at this time, there must be nothing good about it.

She picked it up. “General manager.”

“Come to the executive meeting room, right now!”

“Yes.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jeanne hung up the phone and said to Forrest, “Go and find out more. When will this plan start? Has it been confirmed? We can talk about it after the meeting.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne got up and went to the Lawrence Enterprise’s executive conference room.

Not all the senior managers were there. After all, it was lunchtime and some of the senior managers had to go home.

There were a few scattered people.

Jeanne appeared very polite. “General Manager.”

“Do you know that an amusement park is planned to be built near our logistics warehouse?” Alexander asked immediately.

“I just heard that it hasn’t been confirmed yet.”

“There’s no need to confirm, it’s true!” Bryce Hoffman, the senior director in the meeting room, said bluntly. “My friends in the executive office have already informed me. They have confirmed that the largest amusement park in the entire South Hampton City will be built right opposite our logistics warehouse. This means that our logistics transportation will be seriously affected due to the flow of people. How do we resolve this now?”

Jeanne was silent.

Bryce’s tone was very blunt as he said, “Logistics warehouses should be located according to the convenience of transportation. Didn’t you guys think about this problem back then?”

“I didn’t hear that there would be an amusement park there back then,” Jeanne said honestly.

Moreover, she had indeed gone to see it at the location back then. As the logistics warehouse was relatively remote, the traffic was smoother and it was the best location to choose.

“You didn’t ask in advance?” Bryce said in a mocking tone.

Jeanne’s expression changed slightly. “Director Hoffman, I’m afraid that this is your problem and not mine.”

“How dare you say that!”

“My marketing department is only responsible for marketing planning and implementation. The general department is in charge of public relations and logistics support. When I chose the location for the logistics warehouse, you did not give me any professional advice. The decision-making meeting was unanimously approved. You probably also raised your hand and approved this. Now that we have a problem, you are questioning me? Shouldn’t you be questioning the support of your general department?”

“You!” Bryce was deemed speechless by Jeanne’s words.

“Of course, I don’t think that now is the time to point our fingers at anyone. The most important thing now is to solve this.”

“Have you thought of how to solve it?” Bryce suppressed his anger.

“I just received the news and I’m thinking about it too.” Jeanne’s tone was also very heavy. She said, “First of all, we have to find out more about this matter...”

“There’s no need to find out more. It’s already planned and written. It’s an iron-clad fact.” Bryce was very certain.

“That means that if we go to public relations now, it would be futile to let the executive office choose another location. It would also waste time and energy.”
