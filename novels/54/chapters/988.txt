989 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

After all, even if she was not calm, she could not avoid it, right?

She bit her lip and waited for a long time, but Kingsley did not explode.

She could not possibly face the four men in the room naked the entire time, so she said, “Mr. Thorn, can I take a shower and put on my clothes first?”

The moment Kingsley’s eyes flickered, Lucy’s entire body tensed up.

“You’re only showering now?” Kingsley suddenly asked.

Lucy nodded. “Yes.”

She had just woken up, so of course, she was only going to take a shower now.

Kingsley’s eyes seemed to glance over at her body before he instructed the others, “You guys can head out first!”

“Yes.” The two high-level assassins and Kerby left immediately, not daring to stay for even a second longer.

Only Kingsley and Lucy were left in the room.

“Did it feel good?” Kingsley asked.

Lucy frowned.

“I said, does it feel good to deal with Millie this way?” Kingsley asked.

At that, Lucy pursed her lips. It turned out that he was angry only because she dealt with Millie in that way.

She explained, “I’m just showing you what kind of person Millie is. It will not benefit the Hills if she stays by your side.”

“So you think I don’t know?” Kingsley raised his eyebrows.

“I was afraid you’d get carried away by your sexual desires,” Lucy kept talking.

At that moment, she thanked God that the other assassins had gone out. Otherwise, if she questioned Kingsley like that, Kingsley might kill her even if he wanted to save face.

“Lucy, aren’t you a little too full of yourself?” Kingsley suddenly reached out and grabbed Lucy’s neck.

“I was just thinking about the bigger picture.”

“You think I won’t dare to kill you?”

“So are you going to kill me for Millie?” Lucy asked.

Her originally pale face was now flushed red from Kingsley choking her. It was because she was running out of oxygen!

“Do I need a reason to kill you?”

“Kingsley, doesn’t your current action prove that you’ve been blinded by your sexual desire? You knew that Millie was useless and even a femme fatale, yet you kept her around and even killed me, who have been loyal to you…” Kingsley’s grip around Lucy’s neck was so tight that she could not say a word.

She even felt that in the next second, Kingsley would strangle her to death.

If she died, she had to appear in Jeanne’s dreams and ask Jeanne to kill Millie for her. Jeanne must help her kill that woman!

“Ah!” Kingsley pushed Lucy pushed to the ground.

Lucy did not even have the strength to resist, and her entire body hit the coffee table beside her.

Then, the vase on the coffee table fell to the ground and shattered beside Lucy.

However, she did not feel any pain at that moment. All she wanted was to take deep breaths and keep herself alive.

“A femme fatale?” Kingsley crouched down and looked at Lucy, who was panting on the ground.

Lucy could feel Kingsley getting closer to her.

At that moment, an uncontrollable fear instantly washed over her body, and her body’s instinctive reaction even made her move away from him.

However, she forgot that the pieces of the broken flower vase were around her.

She endured the pain and did not dare to move.

She only saw Kingsley’s body leaning closer to her. He was so close that she could feel his breath when he spoke.

His breath was surprisingly warm.

She had always thought that it should be cold.

He said, “You’re loyal, aren’t you?”

“Yes.” Lucy nodded. “If I weren’t loyal to you, I wouldn’t have dealt with Millie like this. I wouldn’t have risked my life to do this! Mr. Thorn, that’s the bitter truth. Please– Mm.”

Her lips were suddenly sealed with Kingsley’s lips, and the words that she wanted to say were all silenced.

Lucy used to think that Kingsley was brutal, but she had never thought that Kingsley would be so unpredictable.

She could not even predict what he was going to do next.

Everything she just said was in the hopes that Kingsley would not kill her and that he would believe her. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Yet now, what was the meaning of this?

Suddenly, she felt a pain in her mouth because Kingsley had bit her lip hard. However, she could only endure the pain.

“Can’t you learn how to please me?” Kingsley said coldly.

She was distracted just now, so she did not put any effort into Kingsley’s kiss. In fact, she did not even respond.

She hurriedly explained, “Mr. Thorn, give me some time to recover. I’m a little exhausted from last night–”

Before she could finish her sentence, Kingsley’s face darkened.

No. She was wrong and should not have any recovery period. If Kingsley wanted it, she could not refuse.

She quickly wrapped her arms around his neck and took the initiative to approach Kingsley’s lips with her blood-stained lips.

Just as she got close, Kingsley pushed Lucy away. “Ah!”

He pushed her onto the broken pieces of the vase beside her.

The broken pieces pierced into her flesh, and the pain made Lucy’s face turn a little hideous.

Kingsley saw that, but he remained unmoved. Instead, he ordered coldly, “I’ll give you ten minutes to get dressed and come out!”

After saying that, he left!

Lucy looked at Kingsley’s back and got up from the ground without wasting any more time. Then, holding onto the wall, she walked toward the bathroom.

She looked into the mirror, took out the glass shards on her back, and took a shower as fast as she could.

After the shower, she did not need to blow dry her hair, nor did she have time to bandage her bleeding wounds.

Since she could not wear her clothes from yesterday, she just put on a bathrobe. With that, she walked out of the room barefoot and opened the door.

She said, “I’m done.”

It took her eight minutes!
