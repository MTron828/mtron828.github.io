1313 The First Negotiation With George

Hence, George had been hostile to the woman in front of him from the moment he knew of her existence.

When he went to the charity banquet that night, he just wanted to see who Candice was. He had known from a young age what it meant “to know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles”.

He even knew a lot about this woman. He knew that she had been unconscious for many years and had just woken up from a vegetative state, so dealing with this woman should not be too difficult. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“But since your father is going to marry me soon and we’re about to become a family, I think you should try to accept me,” Candice said bluntly.

“That’s my father’s business. It has nothing to do with me.” George looked at her. “My father never forced my feelings. He wouldn’t have forced me to do something I didn’t like because of you.”

Candice felt that she could not treat George as a child.

“I didn’t come looking for you today to get to know you, or please you. I just wanted to tell you that my sister, Paige, is young. She doesn’t know the dangers of the world, or that Mom is gone. You’d better be nice to her. If you hurt her, I won’t let you off the hook,” George said solemnly.

George probably loved his sister very much, and that came as no surprise.

Even Candice herself could not resist loving Paige’s cuteness, let alone George, who was Paige’s brother.

She said, “George, since I chose to join your family, I’m prepared to treat everyone in it with all my heart, including your father, Paige, and you. I don’t know how much you dislike me, but I’ll definitely tell you that I’ll try to get you to accept me.”

“No,” George refused directly.

His tone was so determined that Candice felt hurt.

Her sincerity was denied so blatantly.

“I won’t accept anyone but my mother. Don’t try to please me,” George replied affirmatively.

Candice was speechless. George did not seem to be a talkative person. He explained what he wanted to say clearly and no need to drag it out. He turned around and left.

Candice watched George leave. For some reason, there was an indescribable pressure.

It was clear that for a long time, her feelings for others were faint. Even when she returned to the Nicholson family and knew that her mother and sister did not welcome her or even have any hostility toward her, she could not care less.

However, the little boy in front of her made her want to win him over. The more he rejected her existence, the more she wanted him to genuinely like her.

She did not know that she had such a strong fighting spirit and such a huge pursuit.

“By the way,” George suddenly turned around and said as he was about to leave. He seemed to have thought of something to add, “Only people close to me can call me George. You can call me Elias Swan from now on.”

Elias Swan.

Is he for real?

He looked serious though.

Anyway, Candice seemed to have seen it on some news before that George took her mother’s surname. However, because he was Edward’s only heir, he naturally had to bear the Swan family name.

The name was Elias Swan.

However, many people still habitually called him George. It was probably a kind of affection for George. After all, George was still young. There was nothing wrong with the outside world calling him affectionately.

Perhaps as George grew older, the name Elias would be used more frequently. On formal occasions, it would completely replace the name, George.

She suddenly felt a little suffocated. It was likened to a surging sympathy.

And that was for George’s mother. After all, she had raised her own son for many years, yet he had completely become someone else’s child.

Candice took a deep breath.

She took a deep breath and walked into the room.

It was clearly an unfamiliar room, but there was an indescribable sense of familiarity.

She took her phone and saw that there were two messages.

Both messages came from Monica. Candice suddenly realized that her world seemed a little too lonely. After not returning for the entire night, the only person who cared about her was Monica, whom she had only known for a day.

She could not help but find that amusing. What was once filled with indifference, she had been overwhelmed with strong emotions in her heart ever since she stepped into Edward’s house.

She clicked on Monica’s message. “How were you last night? Were you drunk? Are you awake now? How do you feel? Did the Chief treat you well?”
