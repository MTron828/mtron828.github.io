Chapter 136: Counterattack. The Eruption of the Public Opinions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

For a moment, Eden could not comprehend Jeanne’s counterattack.

He held his phone with a ferocious expression.

The person on the other side of the phone did not know if he heard it or not, but he said anxiously, “Mr. Swan?”

“I heard it!” Eden’s tone was very cold.

He put down the phone and opened the website.

A few clicks and it came to the main page.

The headline at the top was – How could the Lawrence Enterprise survive if the Government deliberately targeted it?

The number of comments increased crazily at a speed visible to the naked eye. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He looked at the time when it was posted. It was less than 10 minutes, yet the number of comments had already exceeded 5000.

He gritted his teeth and picked up the phone again. “Get someone to fix it and delete the post immediately. We can’t let the news become popular and we must restrict the net flow.”

“Yes.” The other side was respectful.

Eden fiercely hung up the phone and directly threw his phone on the office desk.

Jeanne Lawrence!

You’re really not simple!

At the same moment, at Jeanne’s side.

She was also sitting in front of her computer while she browsed through the internet.

She was calm as she looked at the continuous increase in views and comments.

Half an hour passed.

There were more than ten thousand comments and more than a hundred thousand views.

However, it was not enough.

Among them, the vast majority were her internet trolls. To really spread the news over the internet, they were still a little lacking.

Two hours.

There were 30,000 comments and over a million views.

Jeanne thought that it was about time.

She picked up the phone. “Amy, let the project team have a meeting in the conference room.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne stood up and walked towards the conference room.

The project team members were a little excited. Mandy said, “Director Lawrence, my troll army only contributed about 8,200 comments and an average of 20,000 views. As expected, the matter of the Lawrence Enterprise being targeted by the Sanders will be trending soon.”

“The number of comments and views are still exploding.” Hans kept refreshing his phone with excitement.

At least their first step was successful.

It was not in vain for them to work overtime and stay up all night.

“Stage-by-stage victories come in stages after all. Until the last moment, no one knows who the final winner is. Everyone, please stay awake and be alert.” Jeanne appeared very calm about the current situation.

Everyone really admired the woman in front of them.

She could face setbacks calmly and be indifferent to her successes.

A strong psychological quality was definitely needed.

She said, “We should strike while the iron is still hot. Now, let’s talk about our next step.”

“Yes.” Under her guidance, everyone instantly got back to work.

“Hans, remember the photos you took of our employees who were chased away by the police in the City Hall? Get all the 100 employees to share these photos on their personal social media platforms. There will definitely be some of them who are afraid of leaving evidence behind. These people’s actions may even affect everyone else. You have to pay attention to your communication skills. Stand in their shoes and tell them about the Lawrence Enterprise’s current predicament. At the same time, you have to give them a guarantee.”

“Okay, I understand.” Hans quickly nodded.

“Mandy, keep monitoring the flow of comments on the news. Once the trend is slowing down, report to me immediately.”

“Yes.”

“Forrest, come to my office. I need you to cooperate with me on something.”

“Yes.”

“Everyone, please be alert. Meeting adjourned.”

Jeanne brought Forrest back to her office.

She said to Forrest, “Help me record a video.”

Forrest was a little surprised.

“Since the matter has reached this stage, as the Lawrence Enterprise’s person in charge, I will definitely need to appear in public. This is what the people are looking forward to the most. An official statement from the Lawrences will also force the Sanders to respond. The faster we do it, the less time they have to prepare themselves. So, we can’t afford to waste time.”

“Okay, I understand.”

Forrest quickly took out his phone and started filming.

He really admired Jeanne.

He really admired this woman... She was so cold and calm, and she was so strategic.

At the same time, at the Swanhaven Bank.

Eden slammed his hands on the office desk.

He said angrily into the phone, “Are you all trash? Can’t you fix it even until now? Your software has been hacked, and you don’t even know it. How do you even run your business?”

“Mr. Swan, we’ve really met an expert this time. Our firewall has been upgraded and the security index is very high. Before the news was released, there was no warning at all. It was attacked suddenly. All of our technicians are working hard to fix it now. Please give us a little more time.”
