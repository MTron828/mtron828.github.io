1192 Forced Into A Marriage

He was injured, yet that old man still hit him.

After beating him up, the latter’s eyes turned red.

Nox looked at his grandfather in disbelief as he had never seen his grandfather cry before.

His grandfather always hit him when he was young, and he had always looked forward to the day when he could beat his grandfather up and defeat him.

Later, when he could hit his grandfather back, he naturally did not do it. However, he still found that old man cold-blooded and wanted nothing to do with him.

Hence, what was the meaning of him crying at that moment?

“When you can stand, I’ll fight with you!” Wade promised, but he was also controlling his emotions.

“How did you know I wanted to fight you?” Nox was surprised.

“Your thoughts are written all over your face. I’m not stupid.”

Was his grandfather saying that he was stupid?

“Have you eaten anything, Finn?” Wade changed the topic.

“I don’t have an appetite.”

“Eat something.”

“Alright.” Now, he suddenly felt like he was starving.

“Shelly,” Wade suddenly called out to the quiet Shelly in the room.

“Grandpa.” Shelly quickly replied.

“Feed Nox something.”

“Yes.”

“Who wants her to feed me?” Nox looked disgusted.

Why was Shelly still so persistent?

“Can you feed yourself?” Wade looked at his bandaged body.

Nox pursed his lips. “Call Jenny over– Ah!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Nox shouted.

He was a f*cking patient and was extremely weak right now. One slap was enough to knock him out of breath.

“That part of yours isn’t working anymore. Why can’t you wise up?!” Wade lectured.

He really could not indulge Nox for even a second. One second was all it took for the tides to turn.

“Who said I can’t do it?” Nox was agitated again.

That part of his was fine! Finn even said that it was still there!

“Once you’re discharged from the hospital, you’ll get married immediately.” Wade could not be bothered to waste his breath on Nox and directly gave the order.

“Do you think I’m crazy? Why do I want to marry Shelly? Why should I marry her when she looks like this?”

“How could you be so picky when your legs are crippled?” Wade was about to explode from anger.

He had completely forgotten that the two of them were sappy just a while ago!

“Am I really your grandson? If you insist on making me miserable, I will die in front of you, believe it or not!”

“If you want to die, go ahead!”

F*ck. If his grandfather was in a bad mood, he would have died a few hundred times over.

“Let’s find a day to get him married,” Wade ordered Nox’s father in a cold voice.

“Yes.” Nox’s father quickly agreed.

“I said, I’m not getting married!” Nox was fuming with anger. “I don’t understand. Why do you want me to marry Shelly? I can marry anyone else, but why do you want me to marry her?”

“You and her are the perfect match in terms of horoscope!” Wade enunciated each word clearly.

Could his grandfather be any more superstitious?

Nox was furious. “How good is she? Would she make me so sore that I can’t get out of bed?”

“If you don’t have her, would you still be lying in bed? You would’ve been buried a long time ago!” Wade showed no mercy. “It’s because you don’t have a good relationship with her. Otherwise, you might have been able to avoid this accident.”

Nox felt like he was about to die from anger.

It meant that Shelly was just like a f*cking good luck charm!

“There’s no need to say anything else. It’s decided!” Wade said, “You’ll get married immediately after you’re discharged.”

After saying that, Wade turned around and left.

Nox was so angry that his eyes were burning with anger, and he shouted at Wade, “I said I don’t like Shelly. Why are you still forcing me?”

“Feelings can be developed. How do you know you don’t like Shelly when you haven’t even tried to be with her–”

“She’s so ugly that I feel nauseated just looking at her. How can I like her?” Nox never cared about Shelly’s feelings.

At that moment, Shelly was holding a bowl of porridge and listening quietly to the conversation

Mrs. Winter felt that Nox had gone too far and could not help but reprimand him.

“Fine” Nox was getting annoyed. “I’ll try to cultivate my relationship with Shelly for a while. If I fall in love with her, I’ll marry her.”

“Really?” Mrs. Winter beamed.

“Of course.”

...

Anyway, he would never like Shelly.

“How are you going to train him?” Wade asked him seriously.

“Shelly can take care of me while I’m in the hospital. After I get discharged, Shelly and I will return to my apartment to live alone. If I fall in love with Shelly in one year, I’ll marry her. If I don’t, can you guys let me go?”

Wade seemed to hesitate for a moment.

Nox looked as if there was no room for negotiation!

Suddenly, Wade agreed. “Alright, if you really don’t like Shelly, we can’t force it. However, I have a condition.”

“What condition?”

“You’ll have no other women this year!”

Nox stared at Wade with wide eyes.

“If you don’t look for another woman within a year and still don’t like Shelly, I’ll admit that it’s impossible for you to like her, and I won’t force you to marry her! But if you have another woman within the year, you’ll have to marry Shelly immediately.”

Nox gritted his teeth.

...

That old man was really cunning.

Not having a woman for a year? Does his grandfather want him dead?

If he had known earlier, he would have said that he would try to develop feelings for Shelly for half a year or half a month.

However, he had already said it, and it was the only way to avoid getting married to Shelly.

He gritted his teeth and agreed. “Fine, if I don’t have a woman or like Shelly within this year, promise me that you won’t force me to marry Shelly.”

“Alright.” Wade nodded.

“In that case, you can all leave now,” Nox suddenly urged.

“Nox, let us spend more time with you. It’s so boring for you to be alone in the hospital,” Mrs. Winter said gently.

“Shelly will accompany me.” Nox said, “Anyway, I’ll have to cultivate a relationship with her, right?”
