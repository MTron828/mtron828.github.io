“So this project can only succeed. There’s no other choice,” Jeanne affirmed.

“But now, the government is targeting us. Just now, Team Leader Jackson also gave us a general outline of the government’s construction plan. Our logistics warehouse is basically surrounded by the amusement park. A large-scale amusement park will have countless people flowing through it, and it will definitely cause traffic jams and congestion. There’s even a high possibility of traffic control. I initially thought that we could plan for logistical transportation only during the night, but after thinking about it, it was not realistic at all. If the original 24-hour operation was shortened to eight hours at night, it would obviously be impossible.” Mandy voiced her worries.

“Indeed. Based on the current situation, if we stop construction, we would lose money. If we don’t stop construction, it will be difficult for our operation.” Jeanne said. “Don’t worry too much just yet. Let me talk about my principles first. I will not stop this project and I will not choose another site. In other words, I need everyone to think of a way to prevent the government from building this amusement park project. Even if they proceed with this project, how can it not affect the normal transportation of our logistics warehouse.”

Everyone was silent.

For a moment, it was hard for everyone to think of something at all.

Jeanne’s eyes moved around the room. “Does everyone agree that the government is targeting us?”

“It’s very obvious,” Forrest affirmed.

“Yes.” The others nodded as well.

“The government, which is in power in Harken, should do everything based on the interests of the people. With its current plan, everyone can see that they are deliberately targeting the Lawrence Enterprise. They should give us an explanation.”

“Director Lawrence, what do you mean?” Forrest hurriedly asked.

“Create news and public opinion,” Jeanne emphasized each word.

Everyone stared at her with their mouths gaping. They really admired this woman’s ability.

How could she think so quickly?

How could she hit the nail on the head?

“This is undoubtedly the best method, but Director Lawrence…” Another member of the project team, Ken Xavier, said, “By doing this, you are publicly going against the government.”

“They made the first move,” Jeanne said.

Ken was stunned.

That was not what he meant.

It was not that whoever made the first move would be at fault.

He hurriedly explained, “Director Lawrence, I didn’t mean that. I meant that people like us don’t fight with the officials. I’m afraid that if the Lawrence Enterprise were to go against the government, they will further suppress us.”

“This is a world where the strong prey on the weak. You can’t compromise with the excuse of protecting yourself. In fact, the more we compromise, the more we will be crushed.” Jeanne said clearly, “So, we must resist.”

“Yes.” Ken nodded without hesitation.

At that moment, he was really influenced by Director Lawrence’s determination. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Everyone, don’t worry,” Jeanne said again.

“Yes.” Everyone agreed in unison.

“Now, we have to split ourselves again.” Jeanne arranged, “Forrest, you are in charge of docking a news media. Try to find someone who has a good relationship with the Lawrence Enterprise and it will be easier to persuade them. Mandy is in charge of finding some keyboard warriors and internet trolls. Once the news is published, there should be at least tens and thousands of posts. I hope that once the news is published, the heat will definitely rise. Hans is in charge of contacting the human resources department. Tomorrow morning, I need 100 of our company employees to do one thing. There are no requirements for the staff – the old, the weak, the sick, and the disabled are all fine. I just need to be free tomorrow morning.”

“100?” Hans was a little surprised. He had no idea what Director Lawrence was going to do.

“You didn’t hear wrong.”

“Yes.” Hans was puzzled, but he still agreed.

“I want the results first thing tomorrow morning. This means that everyone will probably stay up all night tonight,” Jeanne said. “I believe that everyone has just received Amy’s notice.”

“No problem,” Forrest said first.

The others also expressed their views one by one.

“Okay, everyone hurry up and end the meeting.” Jeanne was not a person who liked to play the emotional card.

Those words could not compare to the extra digit in the month’s pay.

She would only use practical actions to make them feel that it was worth it to work with her.

…

After Jeanne returned from the meeting room, Amy walked into Jeanne’s office with a pale face.

“Director Lawrence.”

Jeanne looked up at her. “Are you feeling better?”

“Yes,” Amy quickly answered.

“Your job tonight is to take care of the project team members, who will be working overtime. Serve them tea, prepare some snacks and supper.”
