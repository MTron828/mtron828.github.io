Chapter 1517: Side Story: Lucy, I Want You To Like Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lucy’s blade gently cut Kingsley’s throat. A bloody mark appeared on his throat, but it was only a superficial wound.

As Kingsley touched it with his hand, Lucy looked at the man in front of her warily. Ten thousand scenes of him being killed appeared in her mind.

She even had a feeling that the man in front of her knew all her killing methods. It was as if he had predicted her actions in advance.

As expected, the rumored head of the Hills was not a simple man. So many people had tried to kill him, but no one had succeeded. In the end, they all died in his hands.

“Come here.” Kingsley suddenly said.

Lucy could not help but take a step back.

“Come here. I won’t kill you,” Kingsley said.

Who would believe that? She had heard too much about how cruel Kingsley was.

“Anyway, you don’t have a choice.” Kingsley looked at her, his eyes fixed on her.

It felt as though he was not looking at his enemy but his lover.

“Kingsley, why don’t you just kill me?” Lucy kept talking.

Killing her directly was better than torturing her like that. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“When have assassins become so reckless?” Kingsley asked.

Indeed, assassins were not afraid of death, but they also valued their lives. Otherwise, they would not have become an assassin. Lucy looked straight at Kingsley. “Will you let me go?”

“I won’t,” Kingsley said straightforwardly.

Lucy pursed her lips and thought he made sense. How could he let her go?

“Come back to the Delta Islands with me and be my assassin.” Kingsley suddenly made a condition.

Lucy was obviously surprised.

“You don’t have to feel like you betrayed your organization. After all, if I expose you, you’ll only end up dead. In other words, under such circumstances, you’re already dead. Your service to your organization ends here. For the rest of your life, I’ll be the one to give you your life, and you’ll have to be loyal to me!” Kingsley seemed to be persuading her.

Lucy had been an assassin for so many years, but it was her first time meeting someone like that.

“I’ll give you three seconds to consider.” Kingsley did not give Lucy much time to think. He said, “Three, two, one…”

“Alright.” Lucy agreed because he had no choice.

Assassins cherished their lives, and no one wanted to die. Besides, loyalty was all about staying alive.

Moreover, the original organization had chosen her to deal with Kingsley even though they knew she was not capable enough. It was obvious that they did not give her any way out, and she was not so foolish as to stay loyal to them.

When Lucy agreed, a wide smile seemed to appear on Kingsley’s face. Seeing that stunned Lucy.

Did they not say that Kingsley had always been a quiet person? Did she get the wrong person?

That person was not Kingsley at all, but in the next second, she denied her thoughts. If the man were not Kingsley, she would not have been discovered so easily.

With that, she suddenly walked toward Kingsley, whose eyes moved slightly as he watched Lucy walk up to him.

The two of them were very close to each other.

Kingsley was really tall. Standing barefoot in front of her, she only reached his chin, making her seem very petite. She said, “Didn’t you tell me to come over?” Kingsley’s eyes flickered.

“Well, I’m here now.” Lucy looked up at him.

There seemed to be a hint of redness on her face.

“How many people have you killed in this way?” Kingsley asked.

He was her asking how many men she had killed by seducing them.

“Would you like to take a guess?” Lucy smiled charmingly.

A normal man would not be able to reject her. However, she had only ever used that tactic on Kingsley, and ironically, she was discovered before she even started. As expected, she was not made to assassinate men through seduction.

“Don’t use it again.” Kingsley’s tone was somewhat overbearing.

However, he did not ask how many times she had used that tactic. He was just telling her not to do it again.

“Of course, I won’t use a failed tactic anymore, and I won’t dare to.” Lucy smiled and looked very obedient.

“Go and get changed,” Kingsley said.

After all, she was only wrapped in a towel at the moment.

As soon as he said that, the towel suddenly fell to the ground beneath Lucy. Kingsley’s eyes flickered, but he did not look away.

“Since we’re here, why don’t I serve you for a night, Mr. Thorn?” She had heard that Kingsley did not reject any woman..
