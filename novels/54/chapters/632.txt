It was because they were all his biological children, but Jeanne was not.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she got!

“No matter what, the more shares we have, the more we have the right to speak in the family. Alexander, don’t think too much about it. Just transfer the shares first.” Jenifer did not want to waste more time, so she took out a transfer form and asked Alexander to sign it.

Alexander took a look at it.

No matter what the circumstances were, he was actually against transferring the shares to Joshua even though he planned to do it.

He said, “What’s the rush? I still have something to say.”

Alexander still held the poise of the head of the family. He wanted to tell them that Jeanne was not his daughter and that she was not qualified to inherit his and Jonathan’s inheritance.

However, before Jenifer could speak, Joshua could not hold it in any longer. “Dad, you’re going to die. Tell us! We’re in a rush!”

“Who says I’m going to die?” Alexander was furious.

“I’ve asked the police. You’re charged with intentional homicide, and it’s the worst in terms of severity. Once you go to court, the sentence will be immediate death! And if you die, your inheritance will be divided equally. So, before you die, transfer your shares to me!”

“Didn’t you promise to bring me a lawsuit?” Alexander’s face was pale.

He was frightened again after hearing Joshua’s words.

“Forget it. I’ll explain it to you clearly so you know the situation you’re in!”Joshua said fiercely. He did not care about the fact Joshua was his father. “About you killing my grandfather, they already have all witnesses and evidences. Even the Gods can’t help you anymore. My mother only agreed to it so that you wouldn’t be too sad, yet you’re still so naive to think you can live and even get out of this cell. Dad, now I finally understand why you haven’t achieved anything after so many years. It’s because you’re useless!”

“Joshua!” Alexander roared at Joshua.

He did not expect that after being ridiculed by Jeanne, he would also be scolded by Joshua.

“What I said is the truth! Anyway, we don’t want to waste our time on a dead person like you. We still have a lot of things to do! Hurry up and sign the document!” Joshua was ordering him.

Alexander was so angry that his body was trembling. “You’re going against me now, aren’t you?”

“So what if we are? I really hate you to the core. I hate having such an incompetent father that has caused us to suffer for so many years. If only you were capable enough, our family wouldn’t have ended up like this!” Joshua looked at Alexander without the slightest bit of respect for the latter anymore. Instead, his words were deliberately said to hurt Alexander, and he said fiercely, “I want you to sign it. Sign it right now!”

“I won’t sign it!” Alexander was also so angry that he wanted to slap Joshua to death.

“In that case, don’t blame me for being rude.” Joshua gave the two prison guards beside him a look.

Suddenly, the prison guards restrained Alexander.

Alexander looked at Joshua in disbelief. He could not believe that his son, whom he had always valued, would treat him like that.

“Eden has done some arrangements and bribed the police here, so you’d better sign it honestly. Otherwise... don’t blame me for being rude to you!” Joshua threatened.

“How dare you! How dare– Ah!” Alexander suddenly screamed.

Then, countless fists kept landing on his body.

He was in so much pain that he lay on the ground, screaming non-stop.

It went on for a long time until Joshua finally made the police stop. He squatted down and pulled his father’s head. “Are you going to sign it now?”

Alexander looked at Joshua fiercely.

He never imagined there would come a day when Joshua would treat him like that!

“Fortunately, my mother expected you would be reluctant to give up your shares. Hence, she told us to prepare in advance so that you would have to sign,” Joshua said mercilessly.

Alexander endured the pain in his body and looked at Joshua. “I’ve always treated you so well, yet how dare you treat me like this now? Y-Y-You... You unfilial son.”

“No matter how bad I am, I learned it from you. At least I wasn’t cruel enough to kill you, who mercilessly killed my grandpa. Dad, you put yourself in this situation. If I didn’t see how cruel you could be to grandpa, I wouldn’t treat you like this! You deserve It!”

“Y-Y-you...”Alexander was so angry that he could not speak.

At that moment, he was on the verge of breaking down, and his expression was ferocious.

“Sign It!” Joshua was starting to get impatient.

He believed his father’s incompetence was the reason why he had to go through all this.

If his father were not so incompetent, the family would not have been crushed by Jeanne at every turn!

“Don’t waste any more time. Sign it.” Jenifer did not seem to have much patience either.

Alexander’s bloodshot eyes glared at Jenifer.

“How can you let him treat me like this?” Alexander asked her fiercely.

“At this time, why do you have to make yourself suffer?” Jenifer still looked kind.

“Jenifer, haven’t I been good enough to you all these years?”

“That’s what I deserve!” Jenifer could no longer keep up with the act.

“What did you say?”

“I’ve worked so hard all these years. I deserved everything I got!” Jenifer shed all pretense of cordiality with Alexander. “Do you think I like you? I just want your money. Now that you’re useless, I don’t have to please you anymore. Alexander, you’d better sign it right now, or don’t blame us for being rude to you!”

Alexander simply stared at Jenifer and Joshua.

He could not believe he would end up in this situation.

It was karma!
