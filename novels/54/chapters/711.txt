Chapter 712: Frighten, Edward’s Return

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

To say that assassins were not afraid of death was actually a lie — assassins killed to live.

After Millie left, Kingsley stood on the balcony outside the room for a long time, smoking.

He smoked cigarette after cigarette.

“Don’t you feel sad about her death?” Jeanne’s words kept ringing in his ears.

He did not feel sad.

He had seen many assassins die. He had seen many assassins leave and never come back, so he really was used to it.

Moreover, his life did not give him the right to feel sad about their deaths!

…

After hanging up the phone, Jeanne could not fall asleep either.

Lucy’s death really made her feel bad.

In fact, even though she had only been with Kingsley for a few years, she had seen many assassins leave and die tragic deaths. That was why the Hills continued to nurture assassins and watch those assassins die one by one.

She just did not expect that Lucy would be the one to die this time.

Originally, Lucy did not go on missions alone.

She suppressed her emotions and thought of many things about Lucy.

Back when she went to the Delta Islands, the first woman who accompanied her was Lucy. After her body recovered, Lucy was also the one who taught her how to be an assassin. Even though Kingsley and Mason had taught her before, in her heart, Lucy was the only teacher she recognized.

Lucy treated her very well. Perhaps it was because they were both women, so when Jeanne was in the Delta Islands, she relied on Lucy even more.

However, Lucy always said that the person who treated her the best was Kingsley, and the former treated her well only because of Kingsley and the fact that she needed to survive.

No matter what, she received a lot of care from Lucy during those years.

Yet now, Lucy was dead.

In fact, everyone would die. She even felt that she might die soon. After all, it was difficult to determine the life and death of an assassin.

However, Jeanne still could not accept Lucy’s death and that she died in Edward’s hands.

It made her think about how she should face Edward again.

Should she pretend that nothing happened and continue to pretend to be in love with him, or should she think of a way to take revenge for Lucy?

She then turned around.

Just like that, she looked at the sky outside the window. It was getting brighter and brighter, but her heart was getting colder and colder.

She got up and composed herself.

After washing up, she changed her clothes, put on her makeup, and went downstairs, where George was having breakfast.

She did not know when it started, but George seemed to be used to getting up early and going to school on time.

Jeanne smiled and went over.

An assassin was a tool that had no emotions.

Therefore, she could only hide the pain in the deepest part of her heart, so no one would be able to see it.

When George saw Jeanne coming over, he called out obediently, “Mom.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jeanne nodded and had breakfast with George.

It was a little quiet at the dining table.

As usual, Jeanne neither ate too much nor too little.

Meanwhile, Teddy waited on them by the side.

Suddenly, George suddenly asked, “Is Fourth Master Swan not coming back?”

Jeanne drank her cup of milk. “Do you miss him?”

“No,” George denied. “I don’t miss him at all.”

Jeanne stroked George’s soft hair. “I really want you to grow up as soon as possible.”

George blinked and looked at Jeanne, not understanding what was going on.

However, Jeanne smiled and did not say anything more. She was just afraid that she was not strong enough to protect him. She was even afraid that he would not grow up…

She felt a lump in her throat but did not allow herself to reveal her emotions.

She said, “Be a good boy and eat your food. I’m going to work.”

“Okay.”

With that, Jeanne left.

As she was leaving, she turned her head and looked at George as he continued to eat at the dining table.

Even though he matured earlier than his peers, he still had a baby face. After all, George was only six years old.

Jeanne drove to Lawrence Enterprise.

She knew that with the information Kingsley gave her, she would not be at Lawrence Enterprise for long. Many big things might happen when they were not paying attention, and right now, she had not completely taken back Lawrence Enterprise — the business that her mother developed — for herself. Hence, she needed to speed up.

She walked into Lawrence Enterprise, with Amy following behind her.

“Gather all the senior management for a meeting in half an hour. The topic of the meeting is to discuss a solution for Lawrence Electrical’s retail agency. Today, we need to decide on the best solution.”

“Yes,” Amy answered respectfully.

Jeanne then sat in her office, looking through some of the solutions.
