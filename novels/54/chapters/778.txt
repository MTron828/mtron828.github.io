Chapter 779: Eden’s Regret, A Tragic End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After that, Michael was about to hang up the phone.

He did not force Eden. Instead, he just analyzed the pros and cons for Eden to make his own choice.

The most impressive thing about Michael was that he would not say much, but others would do as he said.

Sure enough, Eden compromised in the next second. “I’ll go.”

If he did not leave, Jeanne would definitely kill him.

Now that his reputation was ruined and everyone in Harken wanted to beat him up, there was no way he could make a comeback. If he did not leave, he would only bring disgrace to himself by staying in Harken. As the Eldest Young Master Swan, who was used to being praised by the world, he could not stand being humiliated like that.

All he could do was leave.

“Don’t pack anything. Go downstairs immediately. Jake is waiting for you downstairs.” Michael instructed him, “I’ll get Jake to send you out of Harken and go overseas with you. Once you’ve settled down, I’ll find a way to make sure you’ll have a comfortable life. However, don’t contact any of your family members for the time being. Anyone could betray you. Before you’re safe, don’t let anyone know your whereabouts. Otherwise, all our previous efforts will be in vain.”

“I know.”

“I can only help you that much.” Michael hung up the phone after he said that.

After hanging up the phone, the coldness in Michael’s eyes became more obvious.

‘Don’t blame me for being ruthless. After all, natural selection ruled.’

Eden’s skills were inferior, so he deserved to end up like that.

As for him, it was just to protect himself.

…

Jeanne and Jasmine followed Nox and walked out of Lawrence Enterprise.

The three of them got into a car.

Nox had just said that Eden had run away.

When the police went to arrest him, he suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Jeanne did not expect Eden to leave.

Based on her understanding of Eden, he probably could not bear to leave the Swans, who had such a huge family business. Even if he chose to run away to avoid going to jail, he would not make a decision immediately.

Was there someone else secretly instigating Eden to do so? Was that person Michael?

Her eyes narrowed as she wondered if she could take that opportunity to get some dirt on Michael!

In fact, in the video Miles sent her, Jake’s split-second image was enough to conclude that Michael had something to do with the matter. However, in the eyes of the law, it could not be used as effective evidence against Michael.

She gritted her teeth, picked up the phone, and dialed a number. “Miles.”

“Yes,”

“Has Jake made any moves?”

“He should’ve noticed that I’ve been following him,” Miles said bluntly.

Jeanne’s eyes turned cold.

“That’s why he completely avoided my sight today. I don’t know where he has gone, but it’s obvious that he went to do something important. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have shaken me off,” Miles replied.

“Alright. I got it.”

With that, Jeanne hung up.

It turned out Michael was the one secretly manipulating the whole thing.

Now, she was almost certain that Eden had been taken away by Jake.

However, where to? To help Eden leave Harken?

‘No.’ Jeanne felt a chill down her spine.

Michael would not be so kind as to help Eden after he had failed. He was just afraid that Eden would expose him, so he wants to kill Eden to silence him!

Eden was still in Michael’s trap and was oblivious to it.

Hence, she gritted her teeth and gave Eden a call.

It was clear that the other party had turned off their phone. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, it occurred to Jeanne that Eden might not know that he would one day be killed in his best friend’s hands, just like how he never thought that he would one day be destroyed by the seemingly useless Jasmine.

Jeanne was trying to calm herself down and think about how to find Eden and how to expose Michael’s true colors.

“Do you want to inform Edward?” Nox asked as he looked at Jeanne.

They had left the Lawrence Enterprise to find Eden.

However, they were driving somewhat aimlessly.

Even though Nox had informed his subordinates to search for Eden, it was still like looking for a needle in a haystack. It was not easy to find someone who had deliberately gone into hiding.

“No need. He has important things to do. Besides, he has done his best by giving you to me.” Jeanne did not want to disturb Edward.

When she left that morning, Edward said that he had an appointment at 10 a.m., and she knew that matter was important.

Nox glanced at Jeanne.

Sometimes, he really did not know if that couple was really thinking for each other or if they were deliberately giving each other some leeway.
