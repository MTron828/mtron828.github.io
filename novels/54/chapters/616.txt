Chapter 617: How Could Finn Forget Me So Easily?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was so direct that Sarah was stunned.

“You haven’t even tried it. How do you know you don’t like me?” Sarah rushed up to Finn, a little agitated. “I’m no worse than my cousin!”

“I know.”

“Then let’s give it a try. I will definitely be a good girlfriend and a good wife. I won’t be as fickle-minded as my cousin, and I will definitely not cheat on you. I will love you and only you forever.” Sarah mustered up her courage to confess her feelings for him.

After all, she was only 18 years old. She still felt a little shy saying those words out loud.

However, the man in front of her did not react to her confession. Instead, he said in an unusually cold tone, “It’s impossible for us. Don’t waste your efforts.”

“Are you still trying to let go of my cousin?” Sarah was a little hurt.

Even though she knew he loved her cousin very much, now that things had come to that, could he still not let go?

“It has nothing to do with her.”

“Then why don’t you give me a chance? I can be better than my cousin. No matter in which areas, I can be better than her.” Sarah tried hard to convince Finn, “Can you give me a chance?”

“No.” He was still indifferent to her.

Sarah’s eyes were red.

“Stay away from me.” With that, Finn turned around and left again.

“What’s wrong with being with me? I’m younger than my cousin, I’m more chaste than her, and I love you more than she does. Why are you rejecting me?” Sarah was on the verge of breaking down.

She did not expect Finn to reject her so mercilessly after she confessed her love to him.

“Finn, if you get together with me, you can take revenge on my cousin. I’ll definitely cooperate with you and make her regret it,” Sarah said loudly to Finn, who had his back toward her.

Finn finally stopped in his tracks.

It made Sarah a little nervous as she did not know if that reason could persuade Finn.

Hence, she watched Finn turn around and say to her, “I’m not that childish.”

Sarah looked at him with tears in her eyes.

“I’ll try my best to avoid anyone related to Monica.”

Sarah was stunned.

What Finn meant was that he rejected her without mercy because she was Monica’s cousin.

Hence, she was not the reason. It was her relationship with Monica that was the reason.

She was lost in her thoughts as she consoled herself and watched Finn leave the hall.

Finn, on the other hand, left because he saw Monica coming. She was probably back after a short nap.

When Monica walked into the hall, she saw Finn leaving with his back to her.

She did not notice Finn earlier that day because she did not know he was there. However, now that she knew he was there, she caught sight of him at first glance.

Seeing his cold back, she gritted her teeth and tried not to overthink. Then, she walked toward Jeanne with her crutches.

Only then did she realize that her parents were also there.

She wanted to run away because she did not want to deal with her parents. After all, her parents were very unhappy with what she had done recently.

“Monica.” Before her parents managed to spot her, that brat Sarah did.

Monica quickly told Sarah to lower her voice, which Sarah did obediently and ran to Monica’s side.

“Why are you here?” Monica asked Sarah with a frown.

Did all the senior-year students have nothing to do these days?

“I’m here with your mom and dad,” Sarah replied.

“Why are you running around every day instead of studying?” Monica asked reproachfully.

“Studying isn’t everything,” Sarah retorted. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica and Sarah had been at odds since they were young and would bicker whenever they met.

Monica could not be bothered with Sarah, so she turned around and planned to avoid them until her parents left.

“I just confessed to Finn,” Sarah suddenly said.

Monica’s footsteps halted.

“I’ve always liked Finn, and now that he has divorced you, is there a problem for me to pursue him?”

“Who said we’re divorced?” Monica’s blood was boiling.

“Didn’t you admit it to the media? And didn’t you say you were divorced from Finn the other day when you went home?”

“Do you know what’s a fake divorce?”

“A divorce is a divorce. There’s no such thing as it being fake. Anyway, I’m going after Finn now.” Sarah did not listen to Monica at all.
