Chapter 1695: How ‘Sweet’ Nox and Shelly Are

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

That day, Shelly moved into Nox’s high-class apartment along with Bella.

She was no stranger to this place as she had once lived here alone with Nox for a year. However, who would have thought that she would be back again after so many years? Everything was the same, but the people had changed.

Shelly was packing her things one by one. In fact, neither she nor Bella owned many belongings or clothes as she had not been very rich in the last few years. Hence, she was done packing after a while.

When Shelly walked out of the bedroom, she saw Nox on the phone in the living room while Bella was watching television on the sofa.

Since Nox was the one who brought Bella back, Bella’s impression of Nox changed greatly. She was not afraid of Nox anymore and would occasionally get close to him. Even though Nox was not good at interacting with children, he would not be fierce with Bella. At most, he would smile at Bella after exchanging a few words with her, and then the two of them would do their own things.

Shelly did not know if her expectations of Nox were too low, but for Nox to be able to treat Bella like that, she was content. Seeing that Nox was on the phone, she did not disturb him.

The move took them more than half a day. By the time they were done, it was dinner time, so she went straight to the open kitchen in Nox’s house.

Although Nox lived alone, as it was a high-class residential area, every apartment had a butler provided by the property management. The butler would come to the house regularly to clean and buy daily necessities, including fresh ingredients. If necessary, he would also help to cook dinner.

Shelly opened the fridge and saw that it was full of ingredients enough for her to make a feast tonight. With that, she began to cook dinner. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Nox, on the other hand, did not pay much attention to what Shelly was doing as he was on the phone with Jeanne to report his situation.

“Are you really together?” Jeanne was still in disbelief.

Logically speaking, Shelly should not have changed her opinion of Nox so quickly.

“Of course, she has moved into my apartment with Bella,” Nox said smugly.

“What did you do?”

“Shelly is touched by my heroism!” Nox said proudly.

“What heroism?

Nox then told her about Bella and even exaggerated how brave he was.

On the other end of the phone, Jeanne could not stop laughing. “That’s why Shelly has agreed to be with you.”

“How can she not be with me when I’ve risked my life for her? How heartless would she be to do that?” Nox said matter-of-factly.

“Aren’t you worried that she’s only with you to repay your kindness? In fact, she might not even like you.”

“What’s wrong with that?” Nox said nonchalantly, “As long as she’s with me,

I’m content.”

“You’re so open-minded.”

“What else can I do? I can’t make her like me because I say so, can I?” “If she doesn’t like vou. vour relationship with her won’t be sustainable.” Jeanne said bluntly, “In other words, if Shelly is forcing herself to be with you, she can decide to abandon you one day.”

“Can’t you say something nice? It wasn’t easy for me to get back together with Shelly!” Nox’s expression darkened.

“It’s precisely because it wasn’t easy that I have to remind you to not only care about yourself. You have to make Shelly like you. Now that Shelly has chosen to be with you, you should take advantage of the opportunity and seize it.”

“How can I do that? I’ve been good to her. I’m very considerate of her.” Nox was dumbfounded.

“As I’ve said to you before, Shelly likes gentlemen, so don’t lose your temper and be more concerned about her. For example, when she’s on her period, take care of her, let her rest more, rub her stomach, and so on. Or when she’s cooking at home, help her. Oh, by the way.” Jeanne suddenly thought of something and said, “Shelly is a mother. Although Bella is not her biological child, Bella means a lot to her. If you want Shelly, there’s nothing wrong with pleasing Bella.”

“Alright.” Nox quickly noted it down in his mind.

“Also, don’t force Shelly to do anything,” Jeanne reminded him. “You haven’t slept with Shelly yet, have you?”

“Aren’t you looking down on me? Of course, I slept with her last night!” Nox said arrogantly.

Jeanne was speechless.. That guy could never change his ways, could he?
