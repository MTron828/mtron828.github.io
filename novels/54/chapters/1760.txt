At that moment, she was holding George’s hand while Edward was holding Paige in his arms. The family of four was standing in a hidden corner.

In fact, Edward should not be appearing in crowded places, but for the sake of a friend, he decided not to care so much about it. After all, he had his bodyguards with him — the two who would follow him at all times, except when he was at home, and the other bodyguards were waiting for him outside.

“Monica has finally found her place.” Jeanne sighed silently.

She was happy for Monica. After going around in circles with Finn all these years, they were finally together. If they missed the chance to be together, they would probably regret it for the rest of their lives.

“Finn finally has a family of his own,” Edward echoed.

Edward never used to have much expectations for Monica. However, seeing that they both had such a good relationship now, he agreed that they were meant for each other.

“I’m suddenly a little envious that they can get along so well.” Jeanne smiled and sighed.

Edward paused for a moment.

Jeanne smiled. “I’m not complaining about anything.”

“No, you’re complaining.” Edward was very certain.

“So, how would you like to compensate me, Fourth Master?” Jeanne asked. Since he insisted that she was complaining, she would not be shy. Edward was silent for a few seconds. “I’ll let you have your wish.”

Jeanne frowned. “Won’t you be despised by tens of thousands of people? Edward, you’ll be notorious for all eternity.”

Edward smiled, wondering what Jeanne thinking. Since he had fought hard to conquer the land, how could he bear to let it go to waste? However… Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

Feeling a gaze on him, George raised his head and looked at his father with a frown. Somehow, he had a feeling that his father was plotting something, and he could feel his hair stand on end.

Fortunately, at that moment, the lights in the banquet hall turned on, and the staff guided the guests to the hall next door. Since it was a traditional seating, everyone sat at a long dining table to eat lunch.

Meanwhile, a hotel staff invited Jeanne and Edward’s family to a special private room. It was because of Edward’s identity that they prepared it for him.

A while after the family of four sat at the dining table, Nox walked in with Shelly and Bella. Nox sat next to Edward, and Bella sat on Nox, just like Paige sitting on Edward. The two men looked like slaves to their daughters, even though Bella was not Nox’s biological daughter.

‘Edward, how long has it been since we’ve seen each other? You’re so busy.

Have you forgotten about me?” Nox teased.

Edward could not be bothered with him. He glanced at Bella, who was in Nox’s arms. “Is this your daughter?”

“Yeah, this is Bella,” Nox answered very naturally. “Bella, this is Uncle Edward.”

“Hello, Uncle,” Bella called out in her tender voice.

“This is my daughter, Paige. You look about the same age,” Edward said. “Hi, Uncle Nox.” Paige’s young voice was clear as she called out, “Hello, Bella.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bella looked at the beautiful little girl in front of her without blinking. She had no idea such a doll-like little girl existed in this world, and she just stared at

Paige in awe.

“What are you looking at, Bella?”

Nox, who noticed Bella’s sudden silence, did not reprimand her for being rude to Paige. Instead, he asked her what was wrong! Even Shelly could not do that sometimes.

For example, whenever Bella was rude, she would reprimand her severely. Every time she did that, it would upset Bella, and she would regret it later. After all, Bella was only three years old, so it was understandable that she would be distracted sometimes. However, Nox’s way of dealing with it was different, and he would first ask Bella about the reason.

Bella quickly replied, “Daddy, I think Paige is very pretty. She’s as pretty as the

Barbie doll my teacher gave me a few days ago.”

Bella’s innocence made everyone laugh. Although everyone knew that Paige was good-looking, Bella spoke of it in a completely different way.

Shelly heaved a sigh of relief. She was afraid that Bella’s behavior would make everyone feel awkward..
