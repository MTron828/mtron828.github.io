Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“If Shelly has half of your conscience, she wouldn’t have ended up in this state with my family.”

“Are you praising me?” Zoe smiled brightly.

She was very good at pleasing men.

Nox pulled Zoe into her arms again. “That’s why I’m very happy to be able to marry you.” “In that case, you have to cherish me.”

“Of course.”

The two of them exchanged sweet nothings until Zoe fell asleep. Nox, on the other hand, was no longer sleepy. In fact, he was very frustrated.

He let go of Zoe, picked up the bathrobe on the bed, put it on, and walked out to the balcony. He then took a cigarette and lit it. As he sat on the balcony, he stared at the moon in a daze.

He did not understand how Shelly could be so annoying. It was obvious that he had no feelings for Shelly, but he had been thinking about her recently.

At the thought of all the bad deeds she had been, he really wanted to strangle that woman. Where did she get the confidence to treat him and his family like that? What was so great about her?

The more Nox thought about it, the angrier he got. Then, he suddenly picked up the phone and dialed a number.

Shelly’s phone was on silent as she was afraid that the ringing of the ringtone would disturb Bella’s sleep. However, because she did not feel sleepy after lying down and had picked up her phone to scroll on it, she saw the string of numbers appear on her phone screen.

Actually, she did not want to remember Nox’s number. It was just that Nox’s number was too recognizable, especially the triple eights at the end of the number.

She hesitated for a moment before picking up the call.

“Shelly, you took Zoe’s money, didn’t you?” the other party asked immediately.

Shelly frowned. Would Zoe tell Nox about that?

“Can you be any more shameless? You can ask anyone for money!” Nox cursed.

Shelly was speechless, but she said, “Your wife gave it to me voluntarily. I didn’t ask for it.”

That was why she could justify taking the money.

Nox gripped the phone tightly. The word “your wife” made him feel an indescribable emotion. He and Zoe would only get married in ten days, so in some way, she would be his wife.

“If you want to ask me to return it, I’m sorry. I won’t return it,” Shelly said straightforwardly.

She knew that Nox was stingy, especially with her, and knowing Zoe had given her 200 thousand dollars in one go must make his heart ache. However, tens of millions of dollars were nothing compared to 200 thousand dollars! Was there a need for him to attack her like that?

“Shelly, I’m just telling you, you better not ask anyone for money from now on, especially with Zoe and everyone in my family. If you ask for money like this again, I’ll make sure to teach you a lesson!” Nox threatened.

Shelly was used to Nox’s viciousness. In her head, she thought, ‘So if you don’t give me money, no one else is allowed to give me money too? Who are you to tell me what to do?’

“Did you hear that?” Nox berated.

Shelly replied, “Okay.”

To her, all she had to do was dismiss Nox. She was really afraid that if she angered Nox, the 200 thousand dollars would be gone. At that thought, she told herself that she had to spend the 200 thousand dollars tomorrow. Otherwise, Nox would definitely take it back from her

“Nox, why aren’t you asleep yet? I can’t sleep alone…”

On the other end of the phone, a sweet voice sounded, and Shelly hung up. Suddenly, she felt that the phrase, toxic people should stay together forever, was very appropriate.

Shelly put down her phone. Even though she was not sleepy, she did not plan to be on her phone in case she received another phone call that would make things difficult for her. Instead, she lay down and hugged Bella.

She had never regretted bringing up Bella all on her own.

The next day, Shelly slept a little longer, and because of Bella’s cold, Bella was also sleeping soundly. The two of them slept until 10 a.m. in the morning.

Sarah had her afternoon shift today, so she woke up at that hour and saw Shelly and Bella.

She was obviously surprised. “Shelly, don’t you have to go to work today?”

“I’m not going to work for the time being, ” Shelly replied.

“You resigned?”

“No, I was fired,” Shelly said nonchalantly.

What Shelly said shocked Sarah. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I’m making porridge. Let’s eat together later,” Shelly said.

“Alright. By the way, is Bella fine?” “It’s nothing. The fever has subsided. She’ll be fine after taking some medicine.” “That’s good.” Sarah was relieved.

“Oh right, Sarah, I’m bringing Bella to take a look at some houses today. I’ll move out after I get a house,” Shelly said.

“Do you have money?” Sarah asked.

“I suddenly got a huge lump sum of money”

“Are you for real?” Sarah was shocked by Shelly’s appearance. She quickly walked to Shelly, who was busy in the kitchen. “You didn’t sell your organs, did you?”

Shelly was really amused by Sarah.

“What are you thinking? Do I look like someone who doesn’t care about my life?” Shelly did not hide it from Sarah. “Zoe gave me 200 thousand dollars.”

“Zoe? Nox’s fiancée?” “Yes.” Shelly nodded. “Why did she give you money?”

“To keep me away.”

“Does she need to keep you away? Nox doesn’t even look at you.”

“But some people are just not confident. She’s afraid that I’ll cause trouble.”

“Zoe is too cautious. No, I think Zoe isn’t a good person.”

“Hm?” Shelly did not quite understand what Sarah meant by that.

“That’s right. What kind of person would think of others like that? Zoe must be that kind of person herself to think of you as someone with the same character as her. That is why she gave you the money,” Sarah analyzed. Shelly nodded. “I agree with what you said.”

“Are you really going to accept the 200 thousand dollars?”

“Are you looking down on me for accepting it?” Shelly said deliberately.

“No, I’m just jealous that you didn’t want the money I gave you but took the money Zoe gave you!”

“How can you be jealous? Well, give me 200 thousand dollars now, and I’ll accept it too. ”

“My friend, you’re going to lose your friends if you ask for so much.”

Shelly smiled and explained, “If I didn’t accept Zoe’s money, she would never get over it; but if I accepted her money, she would be able to be with Nox in peace. I’m just helping her by taking her money.”

“Only you can say that.”

“That is the truth.” Shelly was very serious.

“Do you really have no feelings for Nox?” Sarah suddenly asked. Shelly frowned. “Why are you asking that all of a sudden?”

Sarah knew best how much she disliked Nox.

“No, it just seems to be that you’re too cold to Nox. Also, since you don’t like Nox, why don’t you return to the Winters? The Winters have so much glory and wealth. It’s much better than you working so hard alone out there.”

“It’s not because I like Nox that I don’t want to go back. The Winters actually have a lot of concerns about… In short, it has nothing to do with Nox that I don’t want to go back to the Winters. Don’t even think about it. After all, when you’ve all of Nox’s bad sides and all the women…” Shelly glanced at Bella, who was playing on the sofa in the living room. She felt that there were some things that were not suitable for underage people to know. “In any case, ordinary women won’t like Nox.”

“Do you mean Zoe is not ordinary?” Sarah raised her eyebrows.

That woman was really extraordinary, but Shelly did not share the gossip with Sarah. After all, it was better to have the upper hand in the situation, and she still had her professional ethics to keep.

“I feel like there’s a hidden meaning behind your words.” Sarah mumbled,

“Anyway, don’t get yourself too emotionally involved with it.”

She would never get too emotionally involved with Nox because she did not love him at all..
