Suddenly, in the car stopped by the roadside, Finn enunciated each word to Monica. “Don’t hate me. I’ll change.”

Monica looked at Finn’s anxious expression.

In the past, he had always been unwilling to voice his thoughts, but now, he would tell her anything, for fear of losing her.

Monica was touched. She did not know if it was because of her pregnancy, but she had become much more emotionally sensitive, and Finn’s words made her heart skip a beat.

She said, “Alright, change.”

Finn was still slightly hurt. In Monica’s heart, how bad was he in bed?

Nevertheless, Finn took a deep breath and calmly accepted everything.

Just as he got up and was about to leave and return to the driver’s seat, Monica suddenly said, “Finn, other than you, I’ve never slept with any other man.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Finn was about to open the car door when he heard Monica’s voice, and it took him a moment to react.

What did Monica just say?

He turned back to look at her. He was not confident that he was the only man Monica had slept with!

“What you encountered before was just a facade. In the beginning, in order to break up with Michael, I created a bad image of myself. I knew my indecent behavior would affect Michael’s future, so I chose that extreme method.”

Monica explained, “Later on when the Cardellini Enterprise was facing a crisis, I had no choice but to say that I was prepared to sell my body in exchange for the company. However, it didn’t succeed because even if I used my body, no one was willing to help me at that time.”

As Monica recalled the past, she got a little emotional.

There was a point in time when life was just too hard. Now that she thought about it, she could not see to figure out how she had survived to have not gone crazy.

“Fortunately, Fourth Master Swan helped me when I was going through a difficult time.” Monica was gratified. Even when the whole country was not optimistic about her and thought she would be defeated, Nox brought Fourth Master Swan’s financing to revive Cardellini Enterprise.

Finn listened in silence. He, too, was upset that he did not return to Monica’s side when she needed him the most.

Back then, because he had completely given up on her and their relationship, he deliberately turn a blind eye to Monica’s pain. Now that he thought about it, he regretted what he had done back then.

“1 billion!” Monica was suddenly a little excited. “He gave me 1 billion to play with! To be honest, if I didn’t know that Fourth Master Swan was helping me because of Jeanne and that he loved Jeanne, I would have thought that Fourth Master Swan had a crush on me. Perhaps, I would have fallen in love with him too—”

“Did you say Fourth Master Swan gave you 1 billion?” Finn’s face twitched. Monica looked at him. “Are you also surprised by how well Fourth Master Swan treated me?”

Finn pursed his lips. At that moment, he finally understood why Monica was so disappointed in him. It was because Monica never knew what he had done for her.

For the first time, he really hated himself. If he had told her more about what he had done, Monica would not have been so desperate.

He cleared his throat and looked at Monica seriously, “If I said that the 1 billion was mine, would you be less disappointed in me?”

Monica was stunned. She thought she had heard wrong.

“I told Nox to give you the 1 billion.” Finn repeated, “I didn’t want you to know that I was helping you, so I told Nox not to tell you. I didn’t expect that it would be a misunderstanding. I thought you would be able to figure out…”

“So you’re saying I’m stupid?” Monica came to her senses and could not hide the anger on her face.

“No, I just-”

“Finn, you were so cold-blooded to me at that time. How did you think I would have guessed that you were the one who gave me the 1 billion? More importantly, where did you get so much money? Aren’t you poor?” Monica asked curiously.

“Actually, I’m not poor,” Finn said, “because I sold a lot of patents by being in a lot of medical research and development. On top of that, Fourth Master Swan would send a huge sum of money to my account every month. There was a period of time when I was bored and studied the market economy. Then, I bought a lot of real estate, opened a lot of hotel chains, and so on. Anyway, I invested quite a lot of my money, and unknowingly, the money in my account kept increasing. Even I don’t know what to do with it..”
