1372 I Love You More Than You Think

With that, she lifted the blanket and got up from the bed.

It was quite satisfying to sleep until late in the morning.

After all, she had not slept well the night before and had attended a wedding the entire day yesterday. To be able to sleep so soundly last night was incredible, and she felt revived!

Feeling refreshed, she washed her face and came out of the bedroom in her pajamas.

It was a rare weekend, and she wondered whether she should go back to the Cardellini family’s residence to spend time with her parents. After all, it was quite lonely for the two elders were lonely at home.

At that thought, her body suddenly froze, and her eyes widened.

Was she hallucinating? Why was Finn at her house?

That was her own apartment, not the place where she and Finn used to live together. How did he get in? Moreover, he was in her kitchen, cooking.

She froze for a few seconds, and after that, she asked him, “Why are you here?”

“I came early in the morning. I saw that you were sleeping soundly, so I didn’t want to disturb you.”

“How did you get in?” Did she ask him what time he arrived?

“I walked in.”

“Finn!”

“I sent you back the night before last, so I saw the password you entered and remembered it,” Finn explained calmly.

Damn it. It seemed like she had to change the password!

However, that was not the main point. The main point was, “What are you doing here?”

“I told you that I’d come and bring you home after Edward’s wedding.”

Monica sneered. She thought Finn was joking.

She looked at him coldly, but Finn pretended not to see it.

He said, “Lunch will be ready soon.”

She knew that it was lunchtime, but when did she agree to have lunch with him at her house?

She said, “You can eat. I’m going back to my parents’ place.”

“They’re on a vacation,” Finn said bluntly.

“What?”

Why did she not know that they had gone on a long vacation again?

“They told me a few days ago, and I even did a full-body checkup on your father. He’s fine, so he can go out and have some fun,” Finn said.

Monica was a little angry.

She could not believe that the couple would tell Finn where they were going instead of their own daughter. No matter what, she felt a little upset.

“Get a knife and fork for me,” Finn told her to do something for him very naturally.

Monica instinctively wanted to help, but she held herself back. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She said, “I don’t have an appetite. If you want to eat, you can have it yourself.”

After saying that, Monica turned around, went back to her room, and locked the door. The sound of the lock clicking was loud and clear.

Finn looked at the two steaks he had made, and finally, he could not hide the panic under his calm appearance.

He had thought about the calmest way he could use to pretend that nothing had happened between them and bring her back. However, her rejection was obvious.

He also felt very distant from her, like she really did not love him that much.

His throat moved slightly.

Monica probably did not know or, to be precise, he did not know either how much of an impact that sentence had on him. Whenever he thought about it… he felt like he was suffocating.

Despite that, he placed the steak on the dining table. Then, he found a knife and fork and put them on the table.

After he prepared everything, he knocked on Monica’s door. However, no one answered the door.

Finn said, “You can sleep after you eat. If you don’t eat breakfast or lunch, you could have gastric issues.”

There was still no answer from inside the room.

“Monica, listen to me,” Finn called out to her patiently.

Monica still did not respond.

“I’ll wait for you.” In the end, Finn had no choice but to compromise and wait.

He waited until the door suddenly opened.

The moment it opened, he saw that Monica had put on light makeup and gotten dressed. It was obvious that she was ready to go out.

Finn swallowed the words that he was about to say.

“Once you’ve eaten, pack up and leave. When you leave, close the door for me.” Monica said as she walked towards the main entrance, “I’ll change the password when I come back tonight.”

Having made herself clear, Monica walked straight to the door. She opened the door, and just as she was about to leave, the door closed with a bang.

Monica looked at the tightly shut door and turned around to look at Finn with a frown. The disgust was visible on her face.

“We’ll go out after lunch,” Finn said firmly.
