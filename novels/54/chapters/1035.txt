1036 Pushed To The Limit

Monica just watched Harry fly into a rage.

She had never thought to use this method either. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Before she walked into the room, she thought that she would use normal means to discuss the collaboration. However, when she walked in and was hugged by Harry, she suddenly changed her strategy as she felt like she could achieve her goal by any means.

In the room, they were having a standoff.

Once three minutes had passed, Monica lowered her head and made a call.

Harry looked at Monica’s actions and was getting restless.

Monica said into the phone, “Hello, is this the police station? I–”

“Enough!” Harry said loudly, “I promise you!”

Monica grinned coldly and put down her phone. After all, she did not make the call and was just putting on an act.

Harry was not in the mood to care whether Monica was acting or not, but he knew very well that Monica was threatening him.

At his current age and social status, he could not go to jail, nor could he ruin his reputation.

He could not help but glare at Monica again.

In fact, he had never taken Monica seriously. He had always heard that Gary had a daughter who did not want anything except to have fun. However, she had a rich relationship history, and after Gary’s incident, he did not think that Monica would do anything. Even though Monica had made a name for herself at a press conference with the quality inspection department, no one in the industry was optimistic about Cardellini Enterprise’s predicament, especially with Sunny Pharmaceutical’s development. They believed that Cardellini Enterprise would go bankrupt sooner or later.

However, at that moment, Monica had driven him to a corner.

Harry’s body was trembling.

He had fallen into that woman’s trap because he was not prepared at all! He even wondered whether the rumors were biased against Monica!

To think that the calm woman in front of him could push him to his limit, the woman was not simple.

Monica did not care what Harry was thinking. Anyway, she won this round.

With that, she picked up her phone and dialed another number. “Mr. Warren.”

“Chairman, I’ve already brought your clothes to the next room.”

“Leave that aside first. Now, I want you to draft a collaboration plan with President Chance in the shortest time possible. President Chance has agreed to cooperate with us,” Monica instructed.

Steve was somewhat surprised. However, he quickly replied, “Okay.

After hanging up the phone, Monica said to Harry, “President Chance, please wait a moment.”

As she did not expect to use this method and succeed, she did not prepare a draft in advance.

Monica felt that through the discussion about the collaboration, she still needed to review the whole thing and see how she could make it better.

Having been threatened by Monica, Harry’s expression was ugly.

Half an hour later, there was a knock on the door.

Monica went to the door and opened it. She received the contract and pen that Steve had prepared.

Then, she walked toward Harry and handed him the contract.

Harry looked at the contract, and his face twisted in anger. “When did I promise to buy so many products?”

“With your capability, this is nothing.”

I’ve already made it clear to you that I’ve been working with Sunny Pharmaceutical. How can I possibly sell all the products you distribute to me? It’s useless even if you kill me!”

“In that case, buy less from Sunny Pharmaceutical.”

“I’ve paid to get the goods, and all my money has been spent on that. If you tell me to sell less, aren’t you sentencing me to death?” Harry was extremely agitated.

“Isn’t that your problem?” Monica said indifferently, “I don’t think you have a choice now!”

Harry gritted his teeth in anger.

He looked at the contract angrily again. “Change the validity period of the product from three months to six months. Otherwise, it’s no use even if you force me to accept it! At most, we’ll fight to the death. I’ll go to jail, and Cardellini Enterprise will go bankrupt!”

Monica was silent for a few seconds before she nodded. “Alright.”

She knew that she would not gain anything from forcing anyone.

With that, she picked up the contract and walked to the door, telling Steve to change the deadline.

After about an hour, Harry gritted his teeth and signed the contract.

There were four copies of the contract, so Monica took two copies, leaving the other two for Harry.
