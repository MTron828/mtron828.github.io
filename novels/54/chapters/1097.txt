1098 Lucy’s Resistance

“Maybe we can give it a try,” Kerby said.

Lucy frowned, but the smile on her lips was charming.

“Do you think you can do it?” Lucy asked.

“I don’t know, but if Ms. Harmon can’t do it, no other woman can.”

“When you’ve thought it through, come and find me.” Lucy said, “I’m a little tired tonight.”

“Alright.”

“Good night.”

“Good night.”

Lucy returned to her room and casually turned on the light in the room.

At that moment, she had even unbuttoned her trench coat. Under the trench coat was a red high-quality silk camisole dress, which faintly outlined her figure.

In that second, Lucy instantly tensed up.

Just as she was about to throw the trench coat that she had taken off onto the sofa, her hand froze.

It was because she saw the man on her balcony, Kingsley. He stood there, looking at her with hostility.

At that moment, Lucy was even glad that she did not let Kerby sleep with her tonight. If she did, Kingsley would have had a live broadcast of the action.

Next time, before entering the room, she must first see if there were other people inside.

Most importantly, Kingsley had never appeared in her room like that before. He did not even turn on the lights and just looked at her with a sinister expression.

However, Lucy was a calm and collected person, so she could handle the situation with ease.

She suppressed her emotions and looked very calm. She put on the trench coat that she had taken off, and as she put it on, she said respectfully, “Mr. Thorn, is there something you need from me?”

“Where did you go?” Kingsley said coldly.

His eyes were fixed on her movements. He watched as she put on her trench coat and even put on a belt. That way, everything on her body was covered up tightly.

She said, “I took Kerby for some extreme training.”

“Who said you could go?” It was obvious from Kingsley’s voice that he was suppressing his anger.

Lucy really did not know what she had done to provoke that man today. Or did someone else provoke him?

Could it be that K01 did not arrange a woman for Kingsley?

Many scenarios flashed through Lucy’s mind, but she still appeared respectful on the surface.

“Mr. Thorn, you were the one who told me to train Kerby well. On top of that, the Hills will be in urgent need of manpower in the near future, so I’ve spent more time and effort nurturing him,” Lucy replied, trying not to look too strange.

“Have you both slept together yet?” Kingsley asked.

Lucy’s heart trembled.

She pursed her lips.

“Have you both slept together?” Kingsley was furious.

“I’m sorry.” Lucy quickly apologized. “Kerby is a little repulsed by me, but I’ve been getting closer to him recently. It should be within the next two days.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Kingsley’s expression was still unsightly.

“We can do it tonight too,” Lucy said.

Kingsley clenched his fists unconsciously.

Lucy gritted her teeth. She had a feeling that Kingsley might tear her apart.

Regardless of whether she had provoked Kingsley today or not, it was obvious that she would be punished for not completing the task Kingsley had given her.

She endured Kingsley’s approach as he walked closer to her.

Kingsley’s entire body gave off a hint of cold air.

She did not know if it was because he had been on the balcony for too long and that it was too cold or… However, she felt an oppressive aura from him that made her shiver.

“Look up at me!” Kingsley suddenly ordered.

Lucy felt that she was in the wrong, so she kept her head down. However, when she heard Kingsley’s order, she quickly raised her head.

As soon as he raised his head, the hideous scar on her face appeared in front of Kingsley’s eyes.

His fingers moved slightly as he stared at the ugly scar.

Lucy was also a little… frightened by Kingsley’s gaze. It even felt… humiliating.

After all, she was a woman who cared about her appearance, and someone staring at her ugly face like that made her feel ashamed.

However, when facing Kingsley, there was nothing she could do; she could not act out of character.

In the room, the air was a little tense.

“Mm.” Lucy’s eyes suddenly widened.

She saw Kingsley suddenly approach her and kiss her on the lips roughly. It was so painful that Lucy’s entire body subconsciously tensed up.

That was probably the most brutal experience Lucy had ever experienced.

Although Kingsley had always been a little domineering in bed, at least it was not to the point of abuse.
