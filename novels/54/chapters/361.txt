Chapter 362: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

Just as Edward had said, Balti Islands became a tourist destination because it was a cluster of islands. Each island was not big, but they were all separated. They could travel to other islands by ships, and the islands were also divided into many levels. For example, Jeanne and Edward were on the S-level island, which was the best. The best advantage was that only one villa was on the island. Or, to put it more bluntly, no one else was on the island. Hence, they could run naked on the island if they wanted to!

She unconsciously bit her lips, feeling as though she had nowhere to turn for help.

She looked at Edward in front of her with a guarded look. Looking at his face at such a close distance, she found him really beautiful.

Suddenly, she closed her eyes and looked as though she was ready to face death.

Since she could not escape anyway, why should she waste her energy resisting?

Hence, she kept her eyes closed, waiting for the certain someone to come closer… However, nothing came for a long time.

She opened her eyes in bewilderment, only to see the beautiful face smiling in front of her.

He was clearly mocking… her self-indulgence!

At that moment, she heard Edward say, “Jeannie, although you do look excited, we have to fill our stomachs first. Otherwise, we won’t have any strength!”

“Bastard...” Who the hell looked excited?

She stretched out her leg and kicked Edward in the face.

She really wanted to kick Edward’s face, which could bring disaster to the people of a country.

However, just as her foot reached out, a large hand caught her.

......

Jeanne gritted her teeth. The guy’s reaction and strength were really… shocking.

She looked at him fiercely, watching him with that smile still on his face as he suddenly moved closer to her foot.

Then, he planted a soft kiss on her foot.

“...Mm.” Jeanne’s face turned red.

She felt that the current Edward was very flirty.

At that moment, she felt that the sole of her foot was burning hot.

His lips parted from the sole of her foot, and he said, “Jeannie, why don’t you go take a shower and change out of your clothes? The clothes are in the cloakroom. The hotel has prepared new ones according to your size. Once you’re done, head downstairs, and we’ll have dinner.”

After giving his instructions, he took the lead to get down from the bed.

Jeanne unconsciously placed her feet on the bed sheet, feeling the part where he kissed…

“Don’t waste too much time. I’m hungry,” Edward reminded her. Before he left, he did not forget to add, “And I’m not just talking about my stomach.”

‘What a beast,’ Jeanne thought.

With that, Edward left.

Jeanne finally heaved a sigh of relief and quietly composed herself.

In fact, she had been clear-minded and had not had any desires for many years.

Never did she think that there would be a day when her mouth would dry up, her heart would beat faster, and her face would turn red because of a small movement.

She got out of bed and went to the bathroom. After a day of traveling, she really needed a shower and to relax.

However, she did not take long in the shower. After all, she was really hungry. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Once she changed into a set of loungewear, she picked up her phone and went downstairs.

While she went downstairs, she turned on her phone and looked at it. That was when she saw a message from Monica, and her face stiffened.

George had… sports day today.

She remembered George saying a while ago that their school would be having a sports day, and George had signed up for long-distance running. However, too many things had happened recently that she completely forgot about it. Hence, when she saw Monica’s message, she felt extremely guilty.

That culprit…

Something in her eyes moved as she turned her head and looked at the man standing in front of the floor-to-ceiling window on the first floor. He seemed to be waiting for her.

At that moment, he was looking out the window.

As they were on an island, outside the window was the endless sea. Especially at night, with the stars reflecting on its surface, it was really a beautiful scene.

However, Jeanne was not in the mood to appreciate them all. She walked toward Edward angrily and asked, “Why did you bring me here without my permission?”

‘Ms. Lawrence really knows how to throw a fit sometimes,’ Edward thought.

Then, he turned his head to look at her.

Looking at her flushed little face, he could tell that she was throwing a tantrum.

Even so, why did he like her so much?

At least, she was no longer as respectful and polite to him as before. Moreover, she did not avoid him anymore.

He reached out and caressed her head.

“Don’t touch me!” Jeanne was angry.

Right now, all she wanted was to strangle the man in front of her for making her miss George’s sports day.
