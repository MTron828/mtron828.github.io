Chapter 1470: Shelly, Whose Child Is It?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It seemed like he could never tolerate Shelly.

The more unpleasant his words were and the more they could agitate Shelly, the more he wanted to say them. Though, he had never treated anyone like that in his life.

Shelly remained calm when she heard Nox’s words. After all, she and Nox had been at odds for so many years, and it was rare for them to reach an agreement on that matter.

She said, “Why don’t you continue to give me a sum of money to get rid of me?” “Shelly, money is your real goal, huh?!” Nox asked.

Shelly should know very well that he would never marry her, and that was why her biggest goal was to get money from him. For the sake of money, Shelly was willing to do anything.

“Yes,” Shelly admitted.

It was as if she said yes to everything he said about her — like she just wanted to zet rid of him.

Nox gritted his teeth. “How much?”

In his opinion, anything that could be solved with money was never a problem.

“50,000 dollars.” Shelly was asking for an exorbitant price.

Nox smiled. It was obvious from his face that he was mocking her.

He said, “Do you still think you’re the Shelly from back then?”

Back then, Shelly was considered a member of the Winters, but the current Shelly was nothing!

However, Shelly thought that since Nox wanted to get rid of her with money, why did she not ask for more? She was short of money anyway, and money was nothing to Nox.

“Last night, we did a total of five times, and it’s 10,000 dollars each. To others, it might be an astronomical price, but to you, it’s nothing,” Shelly said bluntly, as if she was still negotiating seriously.

“Do you think that I’m a sucker just because I have a lot of money? Shelly, let alone 50,000 dollars, even 5000 dollars is too much.”

“Didn’t you come to me today because you were afraid I would tell Zoe about what happened yesterday? I’m not worth 50,000 dollars, but Zoe should be.” Shelly raised her eyebrows.

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

Shelly was never stupid. “So, 50,000 dollars is not much.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Nox seemed hesitant.

After sending Shelly away, he naturally had to confess to Zoe, so he was not threatened by Shelly. Yet now, he said coldly, “What if you still say it?” “I, Shelly, swear on my life that I will not say it!” Shelly swore.

Nox was stunned as he did not expect Shelly to be so extreme.

“Alright.” Nox did not want to waste any more time with Shelly.

50,000 dollars was not worth it for Shelly, but to him, it was not much at all.

He said, “Give me your account number. I’ll get someone to transfer the money to you tomorrow.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

She did not know what to feel about earning 50,000 dollars in one night. No matter what, she believed she had profited. After all, her body was just a worldly possession. After a while, she would forget about what happened.

“But I have a condition,” Nox said bluntly.

“Tell me.”

“Apart from the fact that you can’t say anything about it, you should resign from your job here immediately. I don’t want to see you in a place like this again.”

“Alright.”

She was about to resign anyway. Although the salary was considerable, in the end, it took up a lot of her time, which was not suitable for her.

Now that she had such a huge sum of money, she did not need to work so much and could treat Bella’s medical condition now. “Don’t play games with me.”

“I just swore an oath,” Shelly said bluntly.

“I’ll trust you one more time.”

“In that case, I’ll be leaving. I don’t want to be an eyesore to you, Young Master Winter.” Shelly even nodded to Nox.

She was so respectful that Nox wondered whether Shelly treated all her sugar daddies like that. However, he really could not understand Shelly’s thoughts.

Could she not stay in the Winters? Why did she have to live such an unsightly life?

Nox did not call for Shelly anymore since he believed the matter had been resolved. All he needed to do now was confess to Zoe. Then, he would wait for her answer and respect her choice.

With that thought in mind, Nox picked up the glass of wine and drank some. Even though he understood what he was supposed to do, he felt a little troubled. After all, he did not even know if he would be accepted or rejected.

He drank a few glasses by himself but found it meaningless. Hence, he got up and left the nightclub.

When he was in the car, it was raining cats and dogs..
