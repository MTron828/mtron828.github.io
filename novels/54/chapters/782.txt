Chapter 783: Eden’s Regret, A Tragic End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Yet, he was smug about it.

His entire body was filled with fear as he looked at Jake, who was approaching him and looked like he was about to murder someone!

“What are you trying to do?!” Eden was on high alert as he kept retreating.

“Mr. Ross said we can start after you’re done with the call,” Jake said bluntly.

Eden was stunned.

That meant Michael had deliberately arranged for him to make that call.

“The purpose is to get the Sanders to withdraw their armed forces. After all, if they investigate it, they might trace it back to Mr. Ross. Once they know that you’ve escaped and might even die in the next second, the Sanders won’t waste their resources to look for you anymore, and Mr. Ross won’t have to constantly guard against the Sanders’s power anymore.” Jake made it clear to Eden.

Eden stared at Jake.

By then, he was lost for words.

He glanced at the turbulent waves on the sea and could not believe that he would die in Michael’s hands.

He did not expect Michael to be so cruel as to kill him to protect himself.

He could not die like that.

No. He did not want to die.

With that, he looked at Jake and quickly said, “Don’t kill me. I’ll give you whatever you want! There are only the two of us now anyway, and Michael won’t know if you killed me or not. Once you send me overseas and I’ve contacted my family, I’ll give you whatever you want.”

Jake sneered.

He was Michael’s loyal man, so how could a few words make him betray Michael?

He walked over and grabbed Eden’s neck with his thick hands.

Eden was so scared that his entire body started trembling, and he felt a chill down his spine.

Then, Eden begged for mercy. “Don’t kill me. I’ll give you anything you want. Please don’t kill me. Please don’t kill me.”

Nevertheless, Jake was unmoved, and the killing intent on his face was obvious.

“Don’t kill me. Please don’t kill me, ” Eden could feel the pain in his neck.

At that moment, breathing became so difficult that he could not even speak.

Truth be told, he did not expect that his life would end like that.

He was always the center of attention.

From the moment he was born, everyone would treat him with respect and shower him with compliments. On top of that, he had always lived under the spotlight.

For all his life, he could have lived such a wonderful life…

‘No,’ Eden said to himself.

His life could not end like that. He could not lose such a perfect life. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He had yet to inherit the Swans’ assets. He had yet to enjoy the feeling of being on top. He had yet to make Jeanne submit to him.

At the last moment, Jeanne’s figure appeared in his mind.

Suddenly, he recalled the first time he met Jeanne. That time, she was kneeling on the ground, her face covered in tears.

He seemed to remember that it was his Fourth Uncle who had told him to take care of the girl kneeling on the ground.

The memories came flooding into his mind…

He also recalled that his Fourth Uncle only treated him differently from the others after he started to be friends with Jeanne.

His Fourth Uncle would intentionally or unintentionally teach him many of the business world’s strategies, and his Fourth Uncle always gave him many opportunities to gain experience in the business world. His Fourth Uncle really treated and nurtured him as the heir, and that was how he became the poster child!

Ha!

It turned out that from the very beginning, his Fourth Uncle wanted to give Eden everything because his Fourth Uncle loved Jeanne and he wanted to give her everything.

Edward gave it to Eden to give to Jeanne!

Eden suddenly laughed out loud.

He did not know if only before one’s death would one see the truth in many things or if only before one’s death would one regret everything.

Anyway, he regretted it. He regretted that his life had been wasted on himself.

He had such a good life, yet he ruined it for himself! He was the one who killed himself!

…

Jake only threw Eden into the sea after confirming that the latter was no longer breathing.

He was from the Special Forces, but after he retired, he had been working for the Rosses. At first, he was a follower of Michael’s father, and after Michael’s father died, he naturally became loyal to Michael.

He watched as Eden’s body was washed away by the sea, with no emotion on his cold face.

To him, killing people was as easy as eating.

However, just as he turned around to leave, his eyes narrowed.

Before he could even react, a gun with a silencer was aimed at his head and shot him to death.

Jake did not even have time to think or resist before he was also thrown into the sea.
