She said, “Finn, Jeannie once told me you’re an orphan, and orphans often don’t have a sense of security. I didn’t think much of it before, but now I see it. Because you don’t feel secure, you think badly of the world and that you need others to do more for you! Finn, don’t you think it’s hard for people to accept you like this?”

Finn stared intently at Monica with his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down.

In Monica’s heart, Michael was despicable, but Michael was great.

“Let’s get a divorce,” Monica said again.

Finn glared at her.

“Tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. Michael has already spoken to the people from the civil affairs bureau. Before they open, they will first process our divorce certificate, and after that, Michael and I will announce to the public that we’ve been together this entire time– Mm...”

Monica was taken aback.

Suddenly, her words disappeared in Finn’s kiss.

She instinctively resisted, for she was not in the mood to do that with Finn at that moment.

She twisted her body and pushed Finn away. However, Finn hugged her even tighter until both of them fell onto the sofa together.

“Ah!” Monica cried out.

It was because her head had hit the armguard on the sofa. Although it was soft, falling from a high altitude still frightened her. However, Finn kissed her again the next second.

“Mm.” Monica resisted.

She kept pushing Finn away, trying to escape.

Finn’s current behavior was frightening. What was more, the doctor said he had yet recovered fully to have sex.

At that thought, Monica pushed harder.

She managed to push him away forcefully, but in less than a second, Finn pressed her down again ruthlessly.

Finn was so strong that Monica could not resist at all.

No matter how she struggled, he trapped her under his body and kissed her fiercely and madly.

Monica suddenly fell quiet, and her tears kept streaming down her face.

She did not know why Finn was suddenly acting like that, especially at a time like that.

All she knew was that him kissing her somehow made her feel even worse.

Finn kissed her like he had lost his mind, and only after a very long time did he stop.

She could feel him stopping just as he was about to go deeper into the kiss.

Then, he looked at her crying her heart out, and the anger and desire in his eyes seemed to disappear.

He looked straight at the woman under him and her pale, tear-filled face.

Suddenly, his rationality returned to him.

He said in a deep and cold voice, “Was my kiss so agonizing?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica’s eyes moved.

“Was what I did to you so agonizing?”

Monica’s tears flowed even more.

She believed there was a huge gap separating her and Finn, and no matter how hard they tried, they could never understand each other.

She could not understand him, and he could not understand her either.

Even if they were in love, and their feelings were mutual, ultimately, they were different people.

Once a conflict arose, their relationship would be broken into pieces.

Since Finn did not get any response from Monica, he got up from her body, tidied her messed-up clothes for her, and sat aside.

Monica’s heart ached.

In fact, she was fine with having sex and doing anything with Finn. She even looked forward to this day, but at that moment, under Finn’s coercion, she felt a pang in her heart.

The two of them suddenly fell silent.

Amid the silence, Monica did not stop crying.

She did not even know why she was crying like the world was ending if Finn did not understand her.

After a long time, Finn suddenly spoke. He said, “Monica, regarding Michael’s matter, let’s think about how to help him.”
