Chapter 78: Win Popular Support

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the office, Forrest looked straight at Jeanne as if he could not accept it.

Jeanne did not consider Forrest’s emotions at all. She handed Forrest a stack of resumes. “Help me choose the other nine people.”

Forrest was still a little confused.

It seemed that he had never thought that such a good thing would happen to him.

“The selection principles. First, they must not be Joshua’s confidants. Second, they must not have any connections with anyone in the company. Third, they must not be too weak.” Jeanne looked very serious.

Forrest took a long time to react. He asked, “You’re not playing tricks with me, are you?”

Jeanne smiled. “At this time, you have to believe in yourself.”

Forrest took a deep breath. “Even if you’re playing tricks with me, I don’t have a choice.”

It seemed that he was a sensible person.

Jeanne just watched as Forrest took the resumes and then picked and eliminated them.

She did not rush him and just waited quietly for him.

After nearly an hour, Forrest hesitated and left 15 people behind, “I think these people are the most suitable for the project. Apart from meeting the three conditions, their attitude toward work is also relatively positive.”

Jeanne took the list of the 15 people. “Are there any of them that you have a good relationship with?”

Forrest was stunned and nodded. “Yes.”

“Remove those that you have a good relationship with.”

“I’m very fair and just,” Forrest said righteously, “I definitely didn’t choose them from my personal standpoint.”

“I know, but the workplace is a place that isn’t friendly to friends. Once it involves interests, it’s very easy for you to turn against each other,” Jeanne said to Forrest, “Rather than leaving behind hidden dangers that may harm the relationship between friends, it’s better to nip it in the bud.”

Forrest was convinced by Jeanne.

He eliminated the two people he had a better relationship with, leaving 13 people.

“Are there any under 25 years old?”

“No.”

“Anyone over 45 years old?”

“No.”

“Then pick the nine people you think are the most suitable from this pile of people and pick them again based on your feelings. Don’t hesitate.”

Forrest nodded and went through the list again.

In the end, the list of the nine people was decided.

Jeanne looked at the resumes of the ten people in front of her, including Forrest’s. She said, “Okay, the meeting will be held in the conference room in 20 minutes. I have work arrangements.”

“Okay.” Forrest was respectful. The moment he left, he was a little hesitant. “Are you really going to use these people?”

“Or else?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

“I’m just a little employee, after all...” Forrest wondered, ‘Is she not worried that the people I chose might not be capable enough?!’

“Use people without suspicion and don’t use suspicious people.” Jeanne smiled. “I believe in you.”

Forrest’s heart wavered a little.

This was the first time he was trusted so much.

“Thank you,” Forrest said sincerely and then walked out of Jeanne’s office.

Jeanne looked in the direction of the door.

She turned back to look at the list in her hand.

Ability in the workplace was important, but winning popular support was even more important!

Jeanne picked up the phone. “Amy, come in for a while.”

“Okay.”

Amy knocked on the door and entered.

Jeanne handed the resumes in her hand to Amy. “Report to the general affairs department and have them send out documents immediately. Withdraw these people from their current positions and let them join the marketing department’s Special Reinforcement Team. The team leader is me, and the direct leader is the executive general manager, Alexander Lawrence.”

“Understood.”

“Half an hour. I need to see the internal documents.”

“Understood.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Amy took the list respectfully and left.

After Jeanne gave her instructions, she thought for a moment and called her dad. “Dad.”

“Yes.”

“I’ve picked out the list of my team members.”

Alexander frowned slightly. He hadn’t expected Jeanne to be so efficient.

“Now, I’ll get my secretary to report to the general affairs department and send out the documents. Dad, you should also send out a document regarding your concurrent position as the marketing director.”

“Okay,” Qiao Jinhong responded.

“Thank you, Dad.”

“Do well. If you don’t, you know the consequences.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She sat in the office and waited for a while. When Forrest came to the office to look for her, she walked into the meeting room.

Everyone in the meeting room looked at her, feeling a little overwhelmed.

Although Jeanne’s reputation was not very good, no matter what, she was a Lawrence, so she definitely had rights. Now that they were suddenly selected, they could not help but feel a little excited.

Jeanne was straightforward. “The company gave me a test. They asked me to take down the MUK cooperation rights within a month. If I can’t take it down, I’ll have to return home. Only by taking it down will I be able to take up the position of marketing director, so I need your help.”

“There are so many people in the company. Why did you choose us?” One of the employees suddenly asked. In the end, he was still very puzzled.

“I won’t say much about the selection criteria. You just need to know that you’re the best to me,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

Everyone was still a little surprised.

Jeanne did not think of spending time explaining. She went straight to the point. “Let’s talk about the next work arrangement.”

The others also listened quietly to her instructions.

“The general affairs department is currently making drafts. They’ll temporarily divest all of your current jobs so that you can devote your attention to my project team. The work of the project is simple but tough at the same time. It’ll be very difficult to take down an international company within a month. Therefore, before detailing the specific work, I need to reiterate one thing. Once the project is completed, I’ll become the marketing director, and everyone here will be promoted and given a raise. If I fail and leave, you should be able to return to your original positions, but it’s unknown whether they’ll accept you if you go back.”

“What do you mean?”

“What I mean is that once you follow me, you’ll have made enemies with many people, so it won’t be as easy as you think to return to your original positions.”

“Then we...”

“Opportunities and challenges go hand in hand. The reason I didn’t try to get everyone’s opinion was that I didn’t want you to have the chance to regret it.” Jeanne looked at them, and she was extremely serious. “I didn’t give you any way out. From now on, you can only follow me forward, and I won’t allow my project to fail!”

Everyone looked at Jeanne. Since she had said so much, they knew that they could not refute her.

Jeanne said, “Alright, let’s talk about the specific work...”

In the meeting room, Jeanne arranged the division of work for the project team one by one. She also clarified everyone’s work responsibilities and gave them tasks at the same time.

It lasted for a full three hours.

Jeanne looked at the time. It was 2:00 pm.

She said, “Your assignment is due tomorrow at 10:00 am. From now on, please be prepared to work overtime and miss your mealtime at any time. Of course, I’ll compensate you three times your salary when you’re not working. Meeting adjourned.”

Jeanne stood up and left.

After she left, everyone also left.

Some people still had some objections at the beginning, but after the meeting, everyone was speechless.

They were completely subdued!
