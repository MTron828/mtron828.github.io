1004 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After eating, she listened to Finn’s instructions and lay down for a while. After making sure that he had recovered a little, she got off the bed and left the ward to go to his father’s ward.

In the ward, she did not know if it was because of the surgery tomorrow, but her father was not asleep yet.

Her mother was not asleep either.

When she showed up, her mother was worried. “Monica, you’re finally here. If Finn didn’t tell us that you fell asleep because you were too tired, I would’ve called the police.”

Finn told her parents that she had fallen asleep from being overly exhausted, huh?

Fortunately, he did not mention that she got into a car accident. If he told them, his parents would probably be worried to death.

She made sure that her clothes covered her wounds before she walked to her mother. “I just wanted to lie down for a while, but I overslept.”

“You’ve been working so hard recently. You should rest more. It’s just that your dad can’t sleep without seeing you, and I also felt my eyelids twitching. But now that I see you’re fine, I’m relieved.” As Ruby spoke, she seemed to notice some scratches on Monica’s face.

It was probably caused by the broken windshield in the car accident.

“What’s wrong with your face? Why is there a cut and it’s a little swollen?” Ruby asked.

Monica touched it nonchalantly and smiled. “It was because of today’s press conference. By the way, mom, have you seen it?”

“I watched some of it. I was afraid that your dad’s heart wouldn’t be able to take it, so I didn’t let him watch much. But knowing that you exposed the quality inspection department’s scheme in front of everyone and proved the innocence of Cardellini Pharmaceutical, as well as seeing your intimidating presence at the scene, it made me suspect whether you were my biological daughter!” Ruby said proudly, “When did my daughter become so powerful?”

“I’ve impressed you, haven’t I?” Monica was also very pleased with herself.

“Your dad and I were so shocked that our eyes almost fell out of our sockets.” Ruby did not hold back on her praise. “I really think you’ve grown up! Now, your dad and I don’t even have to worry about you anymore.”

“So, leave the company’s matters to me from now on. You and dad don’t have to worry about it.” Monica said very firmly, “But I have to say that it’s all thanks to Jeannie that everything went smoothly this time.”

Ruby nodded. “Your father and I both thought so too. We’ll really have to thank Jeannie later.”

“Alright,” Monica also agreed.

“By the way, you haven’t told me what happened to your face,” Ruby asked.

“Oh.” Monica came back to her senses and lied, “Didn’t I show off my amazing ability at the press conference?! The reporters at the scene were all deeply impressed by me, so after the press conference ended, I was surrounded by those unscrupulous reporters. At that time, I was in a hurry to come to the hospital to accompany you and dad, so I had some conflicts with the reporters. I bumped into them, and my face was injured.”

“Why were you making a fuss with the reporters? What if they write nonsense about you again?”

“My reputation hasn’t been good either.” Monica said nonchalantly, “Besides, I don’t want a good reputation. I’m afraid that I’ll do something out of the ordinary if I lose the splot. It’s better not to have any good reviews so that I won’t be humiliated.”

“Can’t you work harder to improve yourself?”

“Aren’t I improving myself now? I just don’t want the media to brag about me too much. I’m afraid I can’t afford it.”

She was afraid that the pressure would be too great.

Ruby could understand, so she smiled. “Alright, alright. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.”

“You’re the best, mom.” Monica acted like a spoiled child, and at that moment, she also focused her attention on her father.

Gary had been watching the conversation between the mother and daughter.

It was just that his body was too weak. Now, he would feel tired even when he was breathing, so he could not speak much. On the contrary, he liked watching the mother and daughter talk and bicker.

Monica squatted beside Gary’s bed and asked, “Dad, how did I do today?”

Gary smiled, and his eyes were filled with love.

“Don’t say anything. I know it’s ten out of ten.” The moment Gary opened his mouth, Monica had already stopped him.

She knew that talking was tiring for him, and that was why she used that method to communicate with him.

Gary nodded helplessly.

“Now that our family’s name is cleared, we’ll be launching the new products again. I’ve already discussed it with Steve and the board of directors in the company. It’s not difficult to get Cardellini Enterprise back on the right track. You just need to finish the surgery and recuperate. Leave the company’s matters to me.”
