Chapter 459: Sweet Shopping

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Even though everyone said that his personality had changed drastically after he got married, they still could not afford to offend him.

Edward said, “Isn’t being good-looking for others to see?”

Jeanne was speechless. How could he be so shameless?

“Moreover, we are legally married.” The corners of Edward’s mouth curled up into a beautiful smile.

When he smiled, Jeanne seemed to have heard gasps among the crowd around her.

The only thing missing was the frantic screaming.

Despite that, Edward still held Jeanne in his hands. The two of them walked back and forth to many shops, but they could not find anything they liked.

Edward said, “If you can’t find something, it’s fine. Let’s go and eat something.”

“Since we’re here, how can we not find something?” Jeanne was a little angry as she was not someone who would give up halfway.

“In that case, just pick anything.” Edward seemed a little impatient.

After all, she had never been so torn about picking out a gift for him.

“Let me think.” Jeanne looked around, and her eyes suddenly lit up. “Let’s go over there and take a look.”

Jeanne pulled Edward over.

......

Edward was a little reluctant, but the two of them walked into a high-end luxury store.

It was not a place to sell clothes or bags. Instead, it was a luxury store specializing in selling razors.

“Your father seems to have grown a long beard,” Jeanne said.

Edward frowned. “My beard has also grown. You didn’t notice it.”

“Don’t you shave every day?”

“I have a lot of growth hormone.”

Jeanne was afraid that was not the case. He just had high levels of sex hormones!

Jeanne ignored Edward. With the staff’s introduction, she chose a limited-edition razor. “Let’s gift this to your father!”

“Why?”

“It’s suitable! Your father definitely won’t like those fancy things, and he’ll just leave them lying around. However, the razor is different. Men need to use it every day,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Not every man has growth hormones like mine.”

Yes, not every man has sex hormones like his.

“Anyway, your dad would definitely like something more practical. And if I do something wrong in the future, your dad might even let me off with the razor I bought!”

“Why do you think you will do something wrong?” Edward raised her eyebrows.

“I’m just preparing for a rainy day.”

“Is that so?” Edward looked at her.

The look in her eyes was clear... and deep.

However, Jeanne pretended not to see it and smiled at the staff member. “Wrap it up for me, please.”

“Sure.” The staff member was respectful.

“It’s a gift. Make the packaging more exquisite,” Jeanne reminded.

“Yes.”

With that, the staff member left.

Jeanne and Edward sat in the shop and waited. Meanwhile, Edward looked at the rows of razors in the shop and did not say anything.

After a while, the staff handed an exquisite gift box to Jeanne.

Jeanne held the gift box and said to Edward, “Let’s go and have lunch.”

They had strolled around the mall for quite some time. It was 11:30 p.m. when they left Swan Enterprise, and at that moment, it was already 2 p.m.

It was no wonder Edward was a little impatient.

Therefore, the two of them had lunch in a high-class restaurant in the shopping mall.

Edward asked, “Do you have anything else planned in the afternoon?”

“No, I plan to take a break in the afternoon. I will deal with Lawrence Enterprise’s work matters after Eden has settled that matter.”

“In that case, let’s go back earlier this afternoon,” Edward said.

“I want to do more shopping.”

Edward frowned.

“Hey, if you are busy, you can go back. I can go shopping by myself.” Jeanne knew men hated shopping.

“I’m not busy,” Edward said.

Upon hearing his answer, Jeanne smiled softly. Then, she put down her utensils and wiped her lips. “I’m going to the washroom.”

“I’ll go with you.” Edward also put down his utensils.

“Fourth Master, I’m going to the washroom.”

“It’s not like I’ve never seen you in the toilet before.”

Jeanne looked at him, feeling speechless.

Seeing that, Edward compromised. He picked up his knife and fork and continued to eat. “You go ahead.”

Only then did Jeanne stand up.

Her interaction with Edward made her feel... uncomfortable as Edward seemed to pamper her more than she thought.

She pursed her lips and walked toward the washroom before turning around and walking out of the restaurant. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She looked behind her and then took out her phone to make a call. “Kingsley.”

“Yes.”

“Tonight, I will think of a way to get Old Master Swan’s hair.”

“Okay.”

“If Eden and Old Master Swan are not related...” Jeanne wanted to say something but hesitated.

“You don’t have to care about that. All you need to do is complete the task I’ve given you.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.
