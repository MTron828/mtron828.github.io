1067 Finn, I Killed Someone

He said, “Under normal circumstances, Monica should have just gotten off work at this hour. So, the place where something happened to her should either be in the company’s underground parking lot or on the way to the hospital. I’ll drive over to look for her now. You can mobilize all your manpower and get someone to take a look at the surveillance footage from Cardellini Enterprise’s underground parking lot to the hospital. It shouldn’t be difficult to find Monica.”

Nox responded, “Okay.”

By then, Finn had already rushed out of the house. He started the car, stepped on the accelerator, and rushed out.

As expected, he could not let his guard down when it came to Michael, who could really do anything for his own goals.

Finn quickly drove to Cardellini Pharmaceutical.

After arriving, he pulled out the surveillance footage of Cardellini Enterprise’s underground parking lot. He saw that in the video, Monica was knocked unconscious by a man wearing a cap whose face could not be seen clearly. Then, the man carried Monica into her car and drove away.

He gave Nox a call. “Have you found Monica’s car?”

“I found it,” Nox quickly replied.

Finn’s hands tightened.

“It stopped at Richmond Road, in an alley not far from Cardellini Enterprise’s building. However, there was no one there. I also got someone to check the traffic cameras. We found that the area is a blind spot for surveillance, and there are no cameras in the entire alley. Then, I started to check the cars that passed by and locked onto a few. I’m sending people to look for them. I’ll give you a call when I have news.” Then, he was about to hang up.

He seemed to be in a hurry to find Monica.

“Nox,” Finn suddenly called out to him. “Send me a few suspicious routes.”

“Alright,” Nox agreed.

Finn did not stay in Cardellini Enterprise’s building. Instead, he quickly drove to Richmond Road.

After a while, he received a map from Nox, on which the suspicious cars were moving in all directions.

As Finn analyzed the situation, he was suddenly hit with a realization.

If it was Michael, Monica was very likely to have been brought to the place where he and Monica were kidnapped the last time.

If it was done by the same person, there was a high chance that it was done with the same method and also at the same place.

Moreover, there was indeed one car whose route matched the place he was thinking of.

Finn stepped on the gas pedal and sped toward the destination. He was very fast. It would have taken at least half an hour to get there, but he only took ten minutes.

He stopped the car a street away from his destination and quickly ran over. He was afraid that the sound of the car engine would alert the enemy.

When he approached, he suddenly discovered a black car parked in front of the old warehouse.

He checked the information on his phone and found that the suspicious car was that one. With that, he was sure that Monica had been kidnapped here.

He sent a location to Nox. “I found it. Here, come quickly!”

Then, he put his phone down, took a deep breath, and pushed open the warehouse door.

The warehouse was silent. It was not the scene that Finn had imagined. However, step by step, he walked in carefully.

The warehouse was not very spacious, and there were a few old boxes piled up inside, blocking some of his vision.

Finn held his breath as he passed through a few large shipping containers and suddenly sensed a movement not far away.

His chest tightened.

He leaned against the back of the container and adjusted her breathing. He was almost certain that behind the container was Monica and the person who kidnapped her.

He did not know what he would see if he went out now.

Was Monica lying on the ground, covered in blood, or… was the other party holding a pistol and waiting for him to walk into the trap.

He counted to himself three times.

One, two, three!

At that moment, he rushed out of the container and was prepared to fight with the other party.

However, the moment he went out, he was stunned by the scene in front of him.

He looked at Monica, who was on the ground. She was kneeling at the side, holding a dagger in her hand, and her hands were covered in blood. The man lying next to her had a knife wound in his abdomen and was bleeding non-stop. Finn did not know whether he was dead or…

Finn hurriedly rushed over and put his hand close to the man’s heart, feeling his breath. His expression was solemn.

Only then did Monica seem to realize that there was someone else in the warehouse.

She turned to look at the clean and pure Finn, who was trying to confirm if the man lying on the ground was dead.

She was still holding the dagger that had killed the man. That was what she used to defend herself, or perhaps…

However, it really came in handy. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When she woke up and the man was about to rape her, she stabbed him when he did not expect it.

The man slapped her a few times, but he still could not hold on and collapsed to the ground, with blood flowing non-stop.

Monica, on the other hand, was surprisingly calm. Looking at the man’s dying appearance, she did not react at all.

She had always thought that she would be afraid of blood, death, and all cruel things. However, she felt nothing. She just watched as the man died slowly.

“Finn,” Monica suddenly called out to him.

Finn’s expression was grave.

It was probably because that man was beyond saving.

“I killed someone,” she said.

She had killed someone, and as the saying went, a life for a life. With that, she very calmly put down the dagger.

She said, “You can call the police.”

He could call the police because she had killed someone.

“No, you didn’t.” Finn answered her firmly, “No, he can still be saved!”

Monica’s eyes moved.

...

She did not believe it.

At that moment, she saw Finn calling Nox. “Find a phone and call the ambulance. Don’t use your own number. We don’t want to bring any trouble to ourselves.”

“Alright.” Nox agreed and asked anxiously, “What happened? How’s Monica?”

“She’s fine,” Finn said directly.

She looked fine anyway.

“I’ll be there soon!” Nox quickly hung up.

In less than two minutes, Nox led a group of people into the warehouse, where he saw the same scene.

He could tell at a glance that Monica was the one who killed the man, who should still be alive.

At that moment, Finn was giving the man emergency treatment.

However, what surprised Nox was that Monica did not cry or make a fuss. In fact, she did not even have any emotions.

That was not a state that Monica should be in.

...

Monica even stood up slowly from the ground and walked to Nox. She said, “Don’t mind if I’m too dirty.”

Then, she threw herself into Nox’s arms right in front of Finn.
