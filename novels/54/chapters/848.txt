Chapter 849 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

While it was no big deal to gossip about other people’s women, Finn didn’t answer.

“What’s the matter? Flashbacks?” A noob like Finn would have been taken advantage of by Monica, Nox thought. He did not dare imagine.

“No.” Finn said, “I felt nothing.”

“What?” Nox’s eyes widened.

He could not even recall what they did that night. In his memory, he was just venting. Any other woman would have had the same experience.

“I’m going back to my room to rest. Call me if anything happens to Fourth Master.” Finn left indifferently.

Nox watched as Finn left, noticing his cold expression.

He did not think he was lying to him. However, what Finn said he experienced was impossible. Nox had seen countless women and could tell at a glance what they were like in bed. Monica was definitely the best in the world. Yet Finn felt nothing?! There must be something seriously wrong with Finn’s body!

…

When Finn returned to his room, he laid on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling. Forget it, he thought, and closed his eyes, preparing to take a nap. Suddenly, the phone rang.

He glanced at the caller before answering, “Director.”

“Finn, how are your private affairs? The cardiology department hasn’t been operating well recently. If you’re free, could you come back to work earlier? We have no other choice but to ask since many patients insist on waiting for you.” The hospital director said in a gentle tone.

Finn said bluntly, “Give me three days. I should be able to come in then.”

“Three days? That’s great.” The director quickly said, “I’ll be sure to take this into consideration when it’s time for your bonus.”

“Thanks.”

After hanging up the phone, Finn didn’t fall asleep. It would be more productive to get up and deal with work matters.

He called the department’s assistant director to better understand the current situation and hand over some work.

He opened his WhatsApp and was about to post the work he wanted to assign when he saw a video emoji sent to the group.

It was Monica.

She was currently the trending topic on the internet. The WhatsApp group instantly exploded with messages.

“It’s Monica, isn’t it? Oh my god. I’m a woman, and even I’m smitten by her figure.”

“What a dance.”

“The man beside her must have gotten a reaction.”

“She’s so good at dancing. I want to learn this kind of dance too. It’s so mesmerizing.”

“I don’t think there’s a man alive who could resist her charm.”

They chatted enthusiastically.

Then, a notification mentioning all members was sent out.

“I’ll officially start work at the hospital next Thursday. I’ll need a report from the department on the situation during my absence, including how many patients were received, the number of operations performed, and all medical records of hospitalized patients.”

There were many terms and conditions to the message. In an instant, the group chat went silent. Awkward…

Then, as one started to reply, the rest of the group chimed in.

“Roger that, Director.”

“Okay, Director.”

“Director, I’ll get it ready right away.”

“I look forward to your return, Director.”

“Welcome back, Director.”

Finn slammed his phone down.

…

In the afternoon.

Monica got out of bed and ate at home. Her father was not coming back at noon, which meant she and her mother were the only ones having dinner at home.

With how popular her dance video had gotten, There was no way her mother had not seen it yet. She looked carefully at her mother and did not dare speak.

“Why are you looking at me?” Ruby smiled gently.

“You’re not angry, Mom?” Monica gathered her courage and asked.

“So what if I am? Are you not allowed to dance?”

“...Mom, you’re too good to me.” Monica’s eyes watered. No matter what she did, her mother seemed to stand by her side unconditionally.

She said, “Mom, I only did it to dump Michael.”

“You’ve decided, then?” Ruby asked with pity in her eyes.

“I can’t be with him. I’d rather die than marry him.”

“Weren’t you very good to him before? Why do you suddenly hate him so much?” Ruby was surprised.

“He lied to me,” Monica said, still feeling extremely aggrieved. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What?” Ruby was a little confused.

So Monica told her about Michael’s plan to make her leave Finn. As she did not want her parents to worry, she initially did not want to tell them about it.
