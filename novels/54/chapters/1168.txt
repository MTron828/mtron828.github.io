1169 The War Has Started: William Gates’s Identity Exposed

Just like that, she watched as Edward and the guards started fighting.

There were many guards, and no matter how good Edward was at fighting, he would not be able to last long.

At that moment, Warren even had the intention to kill Edward. However, Jeanne stopped him. “Father, I think it’s William.”

Warren was stunned, and that was when he seemed to realize that William had yet to return.

“We have already verified that Edward is not a descendant of the Duncans. Since he is not, Edward is now deliberately attracting attention so that the real descendant can leave successfully!” Jeanne said quickly and anxiously.

Warren reacted quickly by standing up and leading everyone to the washroom.

At the entrance of the washroom, the two guards who had left with William were still there.

“Where is he?” Warren asked loudly.

“He’s inside,” the guard answered quickly.

“Knock it down!” Warren ordered.

The guards obeyed his order and knocked on the door.

When there was no response at all, Warren’s expression sank. He shouted, “Knock it down!”

The security guards rushed to the bathroom door and broke it open.

The moment the door was pushed open, only Stacey was left lying on the ground in the huge bathroom. William was long gone.

As everyone hurried in, Chester hurriedly picked Stacey up from the ground and called out to her, “Stacey!

Stacey did not move.

“Stacey...”

“Blood…” Quinn was shocked at that moment to see that Stacey’s head was covered in blood.

Chester also noticed that the hand that was holding her head was now covered in blood. He, too, was shocked by the sudden scene.

“Where’s William?” Warren looked at Stacey, who looked like she was on her last breath, and was extremely furious.

No one could answer.

Warren yelled at the guards, “Where is he?!”

The guard replied nervously, “We’ve been waiting at the door. We didn’t see him come out.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Didn’t you see him come out? Didn’t you hear the noise inside?” Warren questioned.

“There was some noise, but we thought…” The guards could not bring themselves to say it.

They probably thought that William and Stacey were making love.

After all, the two of them had not been married for a long time. Since they were newlyweds, it was inevitable that they would not be able to control themselves.

“Trash!” Warren cursed.

Jeanne’s attention was also focused on the washroom at that moment.

How did William escape? Where had William escaped from?

She looked up and down. When she saw a crack in the ceiling, she quickly said to the guards, “Help me open that.”

The guard quickly jumped onto the sink and reached out to touch the ceiling that Jeanne had mentioned.

The moment he touched it, the ceiling began to slide.

Everyone’s attention was on that.

The guards quickly slid the ceiling open, instantly revealing a hole big enough for a person to crawl through.

“Go up and see where it leads to!”

“Yes.” The guards quickly climbed up.

Just then, a servant suddenly ran into the bathroom. “Leader, Mr. Swan has knocked down all the guards and left!”

Warren’s expression became even more grave!

He quickly led his men out.

Since everyone’s attention had been on William, they had neglected Edward, allowing him to escape!

When he returned to the main hall, there were indeed a few unconscious guards on the ground, and Edward was nowhere to be found.

“Father.” Jeanne whispered in Warren’s ear, “There are assassins from the Hills all around us. They won’t be able to escape.”

Warren calmed himself down a little and ordered loudly, “Find them! Even if you have to dig three feet into the Sanders’ residence, you have to find those two people!”

“Yes.”

The guards all dispersed.

At that moment, Chester was still holding the bleeding Stacey in his arms. He walked straight out of the hall as if he wanted to send her to the hospital.

“Stop!” Warren called out to him.

Chester turned around. “I’ve contacted the driver to send Stacey to the hospital first. She’s lost too much blood.”

“No one is allowed to leave today. Everyone can only enter! Inform all the doctors in the Sanders’ residence to come here to treat Stacey!” Warren ordered emotionlessly.

Chester stopped in his tracks.

He had no choice but to place Stacey on the sofa in the living room, and in an instant, the sofa was covered in blood.
