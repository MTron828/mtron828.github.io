960 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

At that moment, everyone’s eyes were on the two people standing on the red carpet on the second floor.

Kingsley was wearing a black suit. He was tall and had a strong aura that carried a hint of nobility.

If it were not for the fact that he was so cruel, there would be countless upper-class heiresses pursuing him.

In fact, Kingsley had indeed attracted many rich ladies and daughters.

The business of the Hills also required him to attend many important banquets in many countries. Every time he showed up, some women would always take the initiative to flatter him. It was no exaggeration to say that Kingsley had many women, but none of them were of poor quality. Some of the women who had one-night stands with him would even make people dumbfounded if they revealed their identities.

Today, Kingsley’s intentional dressing also gave him a different kind of charm.

As for Jeanne, who was beside him, she was wearing a white fluffy princess dress tonight, which made her look very delicate.

Her looks did not really suit that kind of outfit, but it did not make her look ugly either.

Jeanne’s beautiful face could crush everyone in the audience. It was only because she was so beautiful that simple or conventional clothes would not be able to match her beauty.

Kingsley also knew that the gown he prepared for her every year was the same. They were all princess dresses.

His explanation to Jeanne was also very one-sided and stubborn. He said, “You’re a little princess when you’re by my side.”

She felt that those were the most touching words Kingsley had ever said in his life.

Other than her, no other woman could enjoy his coddling.

When the two of them stood together, it gave off a feeling that Jeanne was being protected by Kingsley.

In fact, Kingsley was not much older than Jeanne.

They only had an age gap of more than ten years.

Moreover, Kingsley did not look old. If Jeanne were dressed more maturely and sexier, she would easily match his appearance.

However, the scene of the two of them walking together at that moment made people feel as though Jeanne was being protected by Kingsley, like a father and daughter.

It was very heartwarming.

That was something that could never be found on Kingsley alone!

As the two of them walked into the hall, people came to toast and wish Kingsley a happy birthday one after another.

Jeanne would accompany him to socialize for a while and then leave on his own some other time.

It was the same every year, and Kingsley was used to it.

Hence, after Jeanne left, Millie took the initiative to take Jeanne’s place and held Kingsley’s hand, as if to declare her identity and status to everyone. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Kingsley did not refuse.

Lucy stood in a corner and looked at the hall. Almost half of the people had already approached Kingsley, and some were even lining up in an orderly manner to propose a toast.

“Why are you dressed so plainly tonight?” After leaving Kingsley, Jeanne walked straight to Lucy.

Lucy swirled the glass of red wine she was holding and took a sip.

She had originally chosen a bright red evening dress for herself tonight. It was a low-cut design, and the deep cleavage was visible.

Meanwhile, the back was mostly bare, with only a few thin ropes crisscrossed. Moreover, the hems only reached the middle of her thighs, and the tassels made her look sexier as she walked.

However, she ended up wearing a light blue evening gown, which was a collared design.

Apart from the small diamonds on the dress, which looked gorgeous under the light, there was nothing special about it.

In fact, it was a little too conservative.

“Could it be that Kingsley likes this kind of style now?” Jeanne could not help but tease Lucy.

She knew that Lucy would definitely sleep with Kingsley tonight.

That was why she thought that Lucy would dress up. Although Kingsley was easy to seduce, would it not be better to use her physical advantage to get double the result with half the effort?

At that moment, she even glanced at Kingsley, who was standing on the other side, and then at Mi Li, who was beside him.

Millie was almost completely naked, except for the parts that could not be exposed.

Most female assassins would not dare to dress like that, especially at Kingsley’s party.

It would expose their ambition too much. To put it bluntly, it would be overly obvious that they were seducing Kingsley, and it would cause hostility between assassins.

However, the fact that Millie was dressed like that meant she was already Kingsley’s woman, and she had that privilege.

“No.” Lucy said, “I just like this style.”

“You look like you’re lying.” Jeanne exposed her.
