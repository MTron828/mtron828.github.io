970 How Should She Repay Jeannie?

When Finn heard Jeanne’s sarcasm, he chose to remain silent.

After all, he could easily guess what kind of sinister and cunning tricks Michael would play, but he did not let himself think about that.

Or rather, he did not dare to think too much about it.

It was not because he was afraid of Michael. It was because he just did not want to do anything that was out of his control.

Monica’s matter was something she should solve herself, and it had nothing to do with him. The only thing he had related to Monica was Gary, her father’s illness.

He was a doctor. His duty was to save patients and help the wounded, and no personal relationships should be involved.

At most, Gary had done him a favor, so he would pay more attention to him. That was all.

“Can you help?” Jeanne’s tone was cold. She did not beat around the bush and said bluntly, “If you don’t want to or think it’s unnecessary, I won’t trouble you.”

“When do you need it?” Finn did not give her a direct answer, but the question he asked showed that he had agreed.

“Immediately. The little boy’s body is already showing signs of decomposing. We don’t have time to waste.”

“Okay. I’ll call you when I’ve found the person.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne thanked him and did not say anything else.

There were some things to take note of, such as not letting anyone else know and et cetera. However, she felt that Finn would know better than her, so she did not need to remind him too much.

After Jeanne hung up, she made another call.

As Jeanne’s original phone number had been changed, the other party asked, “Who’s there?”

“It’s me, Jeanne,” Jeanne said.

“Who?” The other party thought that he had heard wrong.

“Jeanne,” Jeanne replied impatiently. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Eldest Young Lady Lawrence? Why are you calling me? Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?” Nox’s tone was rather sarcastic.

Jeanne pursed her lips and did not argue with Nox. Instead, she asked, “Do you know anyone from the crematorium?”

“Jeanne, are you cursing me?” Nox was furious. ‘What was wrong with Jeanne?’

“Do you know anyone?”

“How would I know someone from the crematorium? I’m in good health, and the people around me are in good health. I don’t need to know anyone from the crematorium.”

“In that case, can you get to know someone from the crematorium for me?” Jeanne asked.

The meaning was very clear — she just wanted Nox to help her pull some strings.

Nox had a lot of connections as he had been helping the Swans deal with business matters. Without his network of connections, it would be hard for them to survive in the business world.

Nox said, “What do you want?!”

“The Cardellinis’ pharmaceutical company has run into some trouble that needs to be resolved now. I’m worried that someone is trying to frame them, so I need to do something to pass off the fake as the real thing,” Jeanne explained. She knew that Nox would not stop until she made her intentions clear. “I’ll make it short. I suspect that the little boy who died because of Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine has nothing to do with the vaccine. Someone is deliberately trying to frame and suppress the Cardellinis’ pharmaceutical company, so I need to do an autopsy on the little boy to get the evidence. I’ve just convinced the little boy’s family, but I’m worried that such a move will alert the enemy.”

Nox was a little confused, but he roughly understood that Jeanne had returned to South Hampton City for Monica.

“Now, we need you to use your relationship with the crematorium staff to stop the person who secretly wants to frame Cardellini Enterprise from becoming suspicious. We don’t need to do anything. We just need to inform the other party that the little boy has been cremated so that they can do what they think they can do without anyone knowing.” Jeanne said, “That’s why I need your help to bribe the people at the crematorium.”

She was very sure that Michael was a careful man. He would never make a big deal out of something that could be solved on a small scale, and he would never bribe some unimportant people. For something that could be solved with a casual inquiry, he naturally did not need to go to the crematorium to make a fuss.

However, not bribing the crematorium’s people was just her assumption of Michael.

Michael probably would not even ask for the result.

He probably would not have thought that Monica would do an autopsy.

In his mind, Monica was not smart or cunning enough, so she would not have thought that far.

However, Jeanne could not let her guard down at all when it came to Michael!

“Why should I help you?” Nox understood her situation, but why should he help her, a woman who did not even want her own husband and son?
