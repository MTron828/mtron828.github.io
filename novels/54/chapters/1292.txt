1293 Edward and Candice’s First Date Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The moment Monica saw the news, her lungs were about to explode.

Edward, this sc*mbag, was getting married again!

Why would he not just eat sh*t!

She knew that it was not simple for Edward and Candice to meet alone last night. She knew that Edward, that sc*mbag, could not resist beautiful women. When he saw any pretty women, he would turn into a sc*mbag. She even felt that Edward was not as noble as Nox in this aspect. At least Nox was not lying to her whereas Edward was not only hurting himself pathetically, but he was also praising himself for doing so.

D*mmit.

She really wanted to kill someone.

She really wanted to kill Edward.

What was with Jeanne’s taste back then? Why was she with Edward?

None of the people surnamed Swan was good.

Both Eden and Edward were the same.

Monica was so angry that she smashed her phone on the desk. She could not keep her cool at all. She truly wanted to exhume Jeanne and make Jeanne see what kind of man Edward was!

Monica’s eyes were red with anger.

She just suddenly felt that if Jeanne knew about this in the afterlife, how terrible would it be?!

…

Meanwhile in South Hampton, in one of the highest offices, a man in a suit and leather shoes stood respectfully beside another man and reported, “Chief, the news is published.”

Edward was handling official business and nodded. “Watch out for any negative news.”

“It’s been arranged.”

“Mm,” Edward replied and said casually, “Have you booked a table for tonight?”

“It’s been booked and cleared. I’ve also confirmed with Ms. Nicholson the time for you to have dinner with her tonight. She’ll be here on time.”

“Okay,” Edward replied calmly. His expression did not seem to be too emotionless.

However, the hand that was holding the fountain pen clearly trembled for a second at the moment of the next stroke, no matter how fleeting it was.

…

In the Nicholsons’ residence, Candice looked at the dress in the room in a daze.

She was really careful when she was about to go on a date with the Chief. He even specially sent her what she was going to wear.

She just looked at it before finally putting on the white dress.

Though it had to be admitted that the man’s taste was not too bad. Such a simple dress would not look good at a glance but after putting it on, it exuded an air of elegance. What a classic piece, simple yet extraordinary.

She put on her makeup.

Dinner was at six in the evening and she could not afford to be late.

She was ready at five o’clock, finished dressing up, and walked out of the room, into the living hall.

Her mother, Claire Moore, and her sister, Chloe, were watching television. At this moment, people from the Moore family came to visit, including the wife of Claire’s brother, Lillian Harper, and her daughter, Roxanne Moore.

The moment Candice appeared, the four of them looked at her one kind. She greeted all of them politely.

The few of them were not very enthusiastic about her, so they simply hummed.

It was true that Claire’s feelings for her were lukewarm.

Previously, Candice had always thought that Wyatt doted on her so much that the rest of the family would treat her very well. However, when she really returned home, she realized that she seemed a little out of place.

Actually, it was understandable.

It was said that Wyatt had brought her to the army when she was young. She rarely interacted with her family, so she did not share a close relationship with the rest of the family. It was also said that Claire gave birth to Chloe because she was extremely displeased with Candice not being by her side. She gave birth to one child and put all her feelings into the second one. She distanced herself from Candice.

Even her own mother was distant from her. Naturally, the rest of the family held an even more jarring distance.

Fortunately… Although they were distant, they did not have any conflicts after coming back for a month. Candice was naturally not someone who liked to stir up trouble, so she did not mind too much.

She was also about to get married anyway.

“Have you arranged a time with the Chief?” As a mother, Claire would still ask simply.

“Six in the evening. I was afraid of being late, so I’m leaving early,” Candice replied.

The moment she answered, Chloe, who was sitting next to Claire, sneered.

Candice could tell that Chloe was unhappy with her.

It was not surprising. Chloe used to be the only treasure in this family. Now that Candice had suddenly woken up, coupled with the fact that the two sisters had never been close since they were young, Chloe would definitely be jealous. Especially when she saw Wyatt’s meticulous neglect of her and Chloe, Chloe would be very unhappy.
