Translator: End less Fantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly did not explain much. All she said was, “Let’s head back now, or we’ll be late.”

“Shelly.”

“Quick, hold Bella for me. We’re running back.”

With that, Shelly lifted her dress and ran.

Nox was stunned for a second, but he quickly picked up Bella, who was also wearing a dress, and followed Shelly. Anyway, as long as he could marry Shelly, he would do anything.

When all of them were in a car, Shelly kept urging the driver to drive faster as time was running out. Nox looked at how anxious Shelly was and held his tongue several times.

At 11:50 p.m., Shelly, Nox, and Bella arrived at the wedding venue. Shelly took a deep breath, tidied up her wedding dress, and turned to look at Nox. Seeing that Nox’s hair and suit were a little messy, she tiptoed to tidy him up. Nox, on the other hand, kept his eyes on Shelly. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After Shelly helped Nox tidy up, she held his hand and planned to walk into the hall when Nox suddenly pulled her closer. “Shelly.”

“What’s wrong?” Shelly turned around.

Time was running out.

“If there’s a commotion inside, don’t worry. I’ll handle it,” Nox said seriously.

“A commotion?”

“If the other bride wants to snatch me away, I’ll deal with it,” Nox promised Shelly.

Shelly could not help but laugh. She could not believe Nox thought a bride was waiting for him inside.

“Young Master Winter, you’ll be fine.” Shelly laughed. “It’s just me.”

“What?”

“I’ve sent the other one away.”

“How did you get rid of her?”

“I’ll tell you later.” Shelly said, “We’re in a hurry. Let’s go in.”

Then, Shelly dragged Nox, who was still confused, into the hall. With Bella in Nox’s arms, the family of three walked down the aisle on a long red carpet. The hall was surrounded by flowers and dazzling lights, which made it look like they were in a fairytale world.

All the guests were seated on both sides of the aisle. The moment they appeared, they became the center of attention, and the wedding march started playing in the background.

The familiarity made Nox’s eyes water. He had never expected that one day, he would walk the down the aisle with Shelly. As he turned to look at Shelly, he saw the smile on her face. He did not know whether it was because of the lighting, but not only did Shelly look beautiful, but he thought she looked happy too.

It made him think, ‘Would Shelly be happy marrying me?’

However, Nox decided to put that thought away for now. Together with Shelly, they walked to the end of the aisle, where Bella was carried away by a staff member. Shelly had already told Bella what to do beforehand, so Bella left obediently.

When it was only Nox and Shelly, the wedding officiant looked at them and joked, “Our newlyweds are finally here. Let’s cheer for them.”

The applause and cheers echoed in the hall.

“Welcome, friends, family, and loved ones. We are gathered here to celebrate the union of Nox Winter and Shelly Carter. We are all here to support this commitment of love and to share the joy of Nox and Shelly as they choose to spend their lives together!”

The officiant’s words made Nox’s eyes redden.

“Ms. Shelly, do you take Mr. Nox to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day onward; for better and for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do you part?”

Shelly turned to look at Nox, whose eyes seemed to have been red since they were in the airport.

She smiled. “I do.”

Nox looked at Shelly with tears in his eyes.

“Mr. Nox, do you take Ms. Shelly to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day onward; for better and for worse, for richer and for poorer, in sickness…”

Nox looked at the officiant in front of him and opened his mouth but did not say anything for a long time.

“Mr. Nox?” The officiant could not help but call out Nox’s name again.

Nox nodded heavily and said with tears in his eyes, “I do..”
