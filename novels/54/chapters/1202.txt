1203 Monica, Do You Want A Wedding?

Shelley could not do her homework at all, so she put down her pen and put her homework into her school bag.

Then, she was constantly ordered around by Nox, who instructed her until very late at night.

“Alright, I’m going to sleep. Wipe my body down,” Nox ordered. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Shelley went to get him a basin of warm water.

In the past, those things were actually done by the nurses. The Winters’ servants had also come, but they were all chased away by Nox, and the job was specifically assigned to Shelley.

Nox just wanted to torture her.

Shelley put the warm water aside and went to help Nox undress while Nox stood there like a boss.

Under his clothes, there were injuries everywhere. Although the doctor said that the external injuries would heal quickly, the dense blood-colored scabs were still a little frightening.

Shelley’s movements gradually became gentler.

After she was done wiping his upper body, she helped him put on his clothes. Then, she went to take off his pants and wiped his legs for him.

“Don’t you feel anything?” she asked as she was wiping him.

“No,” Nox replied impatiently.

Shelley knew that Nox actually cared a lot about his legs, so he did not say much.

After she was done, she replaced the water in the basin and proceeded to take off Nox’s boxers.

“Shelley, what are you doing?” Nox pulled his pants up

“Don’t you need to clean this area?” Shelley asked.

“You can’t wait, huh?” Nox’s eyes were round.

Shelley was really speechless.

“Give it to me. I’ll clean it myself,” Nox ordered.

With that, Shelley handed him a warm towel.

“Turn around!”

Shelley turned around.

Seeing that Shelley’s back was facing him, Nox took off his pants with great effort and wiped himself clean.

“Your junk is not that great anyway,” Shelley retorted.

“You’re just sour because you can’t have it.” Nox was still very proud of his body structure.

Otherwise, he did not know what would become of him.

Anyway, if the lower half of his body could not work anymore, at least that part of his would still be there.

“The men in all the films I’ve seen look better than you!” Shelley said bluntly.

“I’m learning some techniques.” Shelley was very calm. “I might be able to seduce you in the future.”

“F*ck!” Nox cursed.

As he had been with women for too long, Shelley managed to tease him with just one sentence.

He suppressed the desire in his heart.

At that moment, he thought about how he still had to endure for another year!

He really wanted to strangle Shelley to death!

“Are you done?” Shelley asked after turning her back to him for a long time.

However, Nox did not reply as he was still angry.

Without waiting for Nox’s reply, Shelley turned around to see that Nox had already put on his boxers and had thrown the towel aside.

She picked up the towel and placed it in the basin of warm water. Then, she bent over and put on Nox’s pants for him.

As she leaned over, Shelley suddenly paused and looked at his body.

When Nox saw that Shelley had noticed it, he was even angrier. “What are you looking at?”

Shelley helped Nox put on her pants and walked into the bathroom with a basin of warm water.

After entering the bathroom, Shelley looked at herself in the mirror and blushed. She had not seen it or tried it, but because of Nox’s physical reaction, her face was… flushed.

On the bed, Nox’s face was also dark.

He could not find a woman to solve it, but he did not want to solve it himself. Hence, he picked up his phone to distract himself.

The call went through.

“Finn, are you still in the hospital?” Nox asked.

“Yes.” He was now in Monica’s ward.

“I’m bored to death. Come and accompany me.”

“Hasn’t Shelley been with you?”

“Can’t I have your company?” Nox was unhappy.

Who cared about Shelley’s company? He needed a cold and straight man like Finn, who was abstinent, to suppress his desire.

“Nope.” Finn refused.

“Why?”

“I’m at Monica’s.”

...

“What are you doing at Monica’s place?!” Nox was unhappy. “Is she awake?”

“Oh, she’s been awake for a week,” Finn said.

F*ck. He had been wondering why he had not seen Finn a few times that week, but it turned out that Finn had been seduced by Monica, that sly fox.

“I’ll come and accompany you tomorrow,” Finn said.

“Are you back together with Monica?” Nox could not help but ask.

“Yes,” Finn admitted.

“Can you be more serious?” Nox was speechless.

Did they not say that they would never be together again? Yet, how long had it been, and they were back together again?

“I’m serious.” Finn said, “You, too, should be more serious and cultivate your relationship with Shelley.”

“I’d rather die than fall in love with Shelley,” Nox said firmly.

“You might slap yourself in the face by saying that.”

...

“So what? I won’t even die!”

Then, he abruptly hung up the phone. After hanging up, he saw Shelley coming out of the bathroom.

That was right. Those words were meant for Shelley, to let her know her limits.

…

In Monica’s ward, Finn put down the phone and said, “Nox.”

“Yes, I know.” Monica nodded. “How is he now?”

“He’s fine.”

“Is it possible for him to recover in the future? I’m talking about his legs,” Monica asked.

“There are many miracles in the medical world.”

It meant that Nox’s legs could still recover, just like how she escaped death and like her father who suddenly woke up.

She even believed that Nox’s legs would recover immediately.

“It’s late. Do you want to go back and get some sleep?” Monica asked.

“Are you sleepy?” Finn looked at her.

“Uh, yes.” Monica nodded.

Actually, she was not sleepy. It was just that suddenly… she did not know how to get along with Finn. Although they had made up, there was some awkwardness between them.

Perhaps it was a little overwhelming to be back together with him so suddenly because she had been through so much.

“In that case, go to sleep. I’ll leave after you fall asleep,” Finn said.

He had become more proactive. He would take the initiative to tell him who he was on the phone with and to accompany her.

In the end, Monica did not refuse. She simply closed her eyes and tried her best to go to sleep

That was when she suddenly heard Finn say, “Do you still want a wedding?”

Stunned, Monica opened her eyes and looked at Finn.

“If we get married again, do you want to have a wedding–”

“No.” Monica directly rejected him.

Finn held back the words he was about to say.

She said, “Let’s not get married for the time being.”

Finn looked at her.

“I think there’s no need to get married. I’ve already gotten married twice.” Monica said self-deprecatingly, “So, I don’t want to get married for the time being.”

“Is that so?” Finn smiled faintly.

There were not much emotions to observe on his face either, and it seemed like he was genuinely wondering.

Monica said, “Let’s just date.”

“Alright.” Finn nodded.

He thought perhaps they should start anew again from dating. After all, it seemed a little too abrupt to suddenly talk about marriage.

“You should sleep early.” Finn was gentle.

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

Then, she closed her eyes, and as she felt Finn’s gaze on her, Monica turned her back to him.

She thought about whether she really wanted to start anew with Finn, or was it because of the regret she felt deep in her heart?

After all, they had never seemed to love each other at the right time, so she just wanted to make up for it.

Otherwise, why would she feel so repulsed when Finn was talking about marriage?

…

Three months later, an unprecedented civil unrest broke out in Harken.

The rumors that a fire broke out in the Sanders’ residence, the Sanders’ deaths, and the many unspeakable things that the Sanders had done in private were all gradually confirmed. Soon, the country was in a perilous situation.

In the face of the country’s leader’s crimes, and in the situation where a country was without a leader, an unprecedented civil unrest broke out in the country under the instigation of the so-called righteous people. The entire Harken was plunged into darkness!

All of a sudden, the economy was declining, everything was in chaos, and the people were struggling to survive.

In South Hampton City, in a spacious back garden in Bamboo Garden of the Swan family’s residence, a pregnant woman was sitting on a recliner and watching the news.

It had been three months, and finally, everything erupted! It seemed to be the most chaotic and darkest time, but in reality, it was the darkness before dawn.

After all, it meant that Alex was ready to step onto the stage of history.

The point was to mess society up so badly and then heroically quell the situation. In the end, he would naturally return to his position as the head of the Duncans with the support of the country!

Jeanne watched the latest news of the day seriously.

In fact, it was not that she cared much about the country’s affairs. She was just so bored that she did not know what else to do other than watch the news.

She put down her phone, got up, and got out of the back garden where she was basking in the sun.

Three months had passed, and the baby in her belly was already six months old.

At that moment, she was walking back to the living room with her big belly.

Teddy was cleaning the living room. When he saw her return, he quickly went up to her. “Madam, are you tired?”

Jeanne smiled. All she would do every day was walk up and down the stairs and go to the back garden. How tired could she be?

She said, “No, the sun is just a little glaring. I want to go back to my room.”

“I’ll help you upstairs.”

“No need. You can do your own thing.”

“Be careful, Madam.”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Step by step, she slowly walked upstairs. She was six months pregnant, so she had to be more careful.

When she returned to her room, she lay on the bed again and looked out of the window. The sun was shining brightly in the sky.

It had been three months since she returned to the Swans.

She had no place to go, so she stayed there for three months, during which Teddy was the only one who had spent the most time with her.
