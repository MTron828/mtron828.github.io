“Jeanne, are you listening to me?” Kingsley did not get a response and was a little unhappy.

Jeanne came back to her senses. “I heard you.”

“From my standpoint, I think you could fix up the marriage between Fourth Master Swan and Melody,” Kingsley said seriously. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Do you think I can fix it up?” Jeanne put down the document and casually lit a cigarette.

Sometimes, when she was not in a good mood and had a lot of stress, she would want to smoke a cigarette.

“Smoke less,” Kingsley reminded when he heard the sound of a lighter.

Jeanne did not reply him. She took a deep breath and said, “What do you think is the main reason why Fourth Master Swan did not agree to be with Melody?”

“Old Master Swan did not agree.”

“That’s why matchmaking is a waste of time. Think about it. Back then, when Old Master Swan helped the Sanders family conquer the country, he suddenly chose to give up military power and leave the political arena. I don’t know the reason, but at least everyone can see that Old Master Swan really doesn’t want to be involved in politics anymore. So now, the Sanders family wants to make the Swan family return through marriage. They even want to control the Swan family. It’s originally a matter of self-entertainment.”

“Self-entertainment?” Kingsley smiled. “You know that you despise the leader of Harken.”

“Stupid, regardless of the position.”

“...” Kingsley was speechless.

“Rather than doing something useful and unrewarding, it’s better to do a favor along the way. This time, I’ve helped Fourth Master Swan a great deal. Maybe I’ll still need him in the future,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“You’re determined to fight with Melody, aren’t you?”

“Just let the Sanders family know how useless those canaries he raised are!” Jeanne sneered.

Kingsley was silent.

Jeanne’s personality was really the same as her mother’s. If it was not for her mother’s willful behavior back then, she would not have ended up like this!

“I originally wanted you to come back to take revenge and start a small business at the same time.” Kingsley sighed with a little sadness.

Jeanne was indifferent.

“In the end, you caused me a lot of trouble.” Kingsley was a little helpless. “In short, don’t let your guard down. After all, it’s hard to guard against a hidden arrow. I’m far away. Even if I wanted to help you block the arrow, I wouldn’t be able to fly over so soon.”

“Yeah,” Jeanne responded. She did not retort back. Her tone still seemed to be a little emotional. It was rare for Jeanne to be so obedient in front of him.

Kingsley’s tears flowed freely, and he was about to speak.

Jeanne did not care and hung up the phone. She was just not used to things that were too emotional. It did not match her current life.

She put out her cigarette and was about to call West when she suddenly quivered. She pursed her lips and pressed the landline. “Amy, come in for a moment.”

“Yes.”

Amy knocked on the door and entered.

“Did Deputy Director Lawrence do anything today?” Jeanne asked.

“What do you mean by anything?”

“Any abnormal behavior.”

“I don’t think so.” Amy was a little uncertain. She said, “For the whole morning, Deputy Director Lawrence was in his office. He did not even come out of the door. Usually, he’ll act like this when he has nothing to do. I heard that he’s hiding in the room playing games.”

Jeanne was silent for a few seconds.

It was impossible for Joshua to let her develop in the Lawrence Enterprise. She had already passed the board’s decision-making committee’s proposal. He would definitely not be so indifferent. No matter what, he should at least go to Alexander Lawrence’s office to inquire about it. It was really strange for him to be so calm unless he already knew about her proposal in advance. He could even say that he had already started planning.

She raised her eyebrows. “Then, has anyone entered or left Deputy Director Lawrence’s office?”

“I didn’t pay much attention to that,” Amy replied. “Although I’m outside your and Deputy Director Lawrence’s office, sometimes I’m too busy at work to notice that much.”

“Okay, I got it.” Jeanne did not ask further. “Get Forrest to prepare and meet West at two.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne looked at Amy’s back. She sat in her office chair and thought for a while. She suddenly picked up the draft proposal in front of her. After hesitating for a while, she revised the investment cost.

It was just a precautionary action. In any case, whether she wanted to cooperate with MUK or not, and how they cooperated, it was all up to her.

What she was doing now was just to prove herself, so that she could establish herself in the Lawrence Enterprise in the future.

...

2 pm.

Jeanne brought Forrest to the high-class hotel that West was staying at.

Forrest was a little nervous. “Team Leader Jeanne, isn’t it a little too abrupt for just the two of us to meet the President of MUK? Are you sure you don’t want to ask the general manager to come along?”

“Don’t worry, foreigners don’t have so many levels. They’ll be happy as long as it’s win-win cooperation.”

Forrest sometimes really felt that Team Leader Jeanne had a mature and steady personality that did not match her age. She was very convincing.

The two of them stood outside West’s room. Then, they knocked on the door.

West’s assistant opened the door and politely led them into the room. There was another person in the large living room.

That person looked at Jeanne and took the initiative to smile.

Jeanne smiled back politely. At that moment, she had a plan in mind.

West stood up from the sofa and was especially warm to Jeanne. “The sun has risen from the west. Are you now willing to come and see me?”

“Godfather, I’m a little busy?”

“What are you busy with?” West asked angrily on purpose.

“I’m busy discussing a collaboration with you,” Qiao Qing said straightforwardly.

West looked surprised. “Could it be that you’re also here to talk about e-commerce marketing with me today?”

“Also?” Jeanne frowned. “Could it be that someone has already beaten me to it?”

“This gentleman,” West introduced, “He’s the boss of Ascension Technology, Cameron Hall.”

“Hello, Jeanne. I’ve heard a lot about you. I’m Cameron Hall,” as he spoke, he handed over his business card with incomparable enthusiasm.

Jeanne took it. “Hello.”

“I didn’t expect to meet Jeanne here. It’s my honor.”

“You flatter me.” Jeanne was neither servile nor overbearing toward Cameron Hall’s compliment. She smiled and asked, “Cameron is also interested in e-commerce projects?”

“E-commerce is the future development trend. I think not only me but more than half of the enterprises in South Hampton City are interested. So, I volunteered myself and brought my proposal to seek cooperation with Mr. West.” Cameron Hall admitted generously.

Jeanne smiled without batting an eyelid, expressing her approval.

At this moment, West said straightforwardly, “My principle is very simple. I’ll choose whoever’s proposal is more attractive and advantageous to me. Jeanne, don’t blame godfather for not giving you preferential treatment.”

“Business is business.” Jeanne smiled. “Godfather doesn’t have to worry.”

“In that case, let’s sit down and talk together.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne and Cameron sat opposite West.

“Cameron arrived first. According to the principle of first-come-first-served, Cameron will talk about his cooperation proposal first.”

“Then, I’ll respectfully accept this arrangement.” Cameron quickly took out his proposal confidently.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. What made him so full of confidence?!
