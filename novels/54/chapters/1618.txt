Not only would he be pressured with money, but the world would also look down on him. She had never thought of harming anyone.

“Yes,” Benjamin replied.

Although it was a little uncomfortable to be rejected by Shelly, he knew he could not give Shelly a sense of security when he was powerless.

“Then, can we be friends now?” Benjamin looked hopeful.

Seeing that he was compromising, Shelly could not refuse.

She could really not leave any leeway for Nox because she did not owe him anything, so she could do whatever she wanted to him. However, with Benjamin, she could not bring herself to resist his kindness.

When she was in school and Benjamin was pursuing her, she was also touched by Benjamin’s kindness.

She hesitated tor a moment before nodding.

Benjamin smiled brightly and said, “Alright, let’s start as friends.” “There’s no start. We’re just friends,” Shelly said frankly.

“Okay, let’s be friends.” Benjamin quickly corrected himself, like he was afraid that Shelly would get angry.

It was very similar to a boyfriend’s endless compromise and pampering of his girlfriend.

From that day onward, Benjamin often visited Bella’s ward, and he soon developed a great bond with Bella. Moreover, as an innocent child, Bella would naturally be nice to whoever treated her well. Occasionally, when she did not see Benjamin, she would ask when he would come over.

Today was the day Bella was discharged from the hospital, so Benjamin came over early in the morning to help Bella with the discharge procedures. Although he was very busy, he did not complain at all. In fact, he was even very enthusiastic about the work.

Shelly observed how busy Benjamin was. It would be a lie to say she was not touched, even though she had been suppressing it and not letting it show.

Once everything was sorted, Benjamin carried Bella out of the hospital. Shelly wanted to carry Bella herself, and if not, Bella could walk on her own. However, Bella refused to let go of Benjamin, and there was nothing Shelly could do. As such, she could only let Benjamin carry Bella out of the hospital.

As the three of them took the elevator downstairs, Shelly was still reprimanding Bella. “The doctor said you can walk on your own.”

“No, I want Uncle Ben to hold me. I like it when he holds me.” Bella grabbed onto Benjamin’s neck and refused to let go.

“It’s okay. She’s not heavy anyway. Not only can I carry you, but I can also lift you up high.” As he spoke, Benjamin lifted Bella up.

Bella could not stop laughing at Benjamin’s teasing. Infected by their laughter, a smile appeared on Shelly’s face too.

At that moment, the elevator door opened, and Nox suddenly walked in, only to see the scene in front of him.

Shelly also saw Nox immediately, and the smile on her face instantly faded. She frowned, not expecting Nox to be hospitalized for a week.

He had only gotten a bump on his head, which would heal in a day or two, yet he stayed on for a week. The life of a rich person was probably too boring.

When Nox saw Shelly, Benjamin, Bella, and the smiles on their faces, his face darkened. He realized that Shelly had never smiled at him as brightly as she was at Benjamin right now.

What did Shelly like about Benjamin, that pauper? He suddenly felt an inexplicable pain in his heart and realized that Shelly liked Benjamin.

Suddenly, the space became a little stiff.

Benjamin held Bella in his arms and said, “Mr. Winter, what a coincidence. Are you getting discharged today too?”

Nox returned to his senses and tried his best not to look out of the usual.

Who Shelly liked had nothing to do with him, and she could like whoever she wanted. He did not care at all.

He said, “Yes.”

“Are you sick too, mister?” Bella blinked as she asked Nox.

Nox glanced at Bella with a long face. He was inexplicably unhappy that she was in Benjamin’s arms.

Bella could sense that the man in front of her was in a bad mood. She grew up fatherless and only had her mother, who was very busy, so she had always been more sensitive toward others.

At that moment, she was a little afraid. She hugged Benjamin’s neck and hid in the crook of Benjamin’s neck, not daring to look at Nox again.

Shelly had raised Bella, so she naturally knew that Bella’s current behavior was because she was frightened by Nox..
