1268 The Birth of Paige

It should be known that Fourth Master Swan had never been afraid of anything since he was a child.

Now because of Jeanne, he had become so wary.

As time went by, Jeanne’s voice became louder and louder.

At first it was just a few grunts.

Thereafter... the screaming grew more miserable.

Dr. Jones just looked at Edward like this.

Watching him clenched his fists, motionless.

The cries in the delivery room were intermittent.

Once there was no sound, Edward would look up at the door.

It was not until the sound came that he relaxed a little bit. Even so, his face was full of worry.

It lasted this way for a long time.

It was past three o’clock in the morning when Jeanne entered the waiting room, and it was dawn now.

Dr. Jones looked at the time, it was past eight o’clock in the morning.

She was still in there, yet there was no cry of a child.

Still, Jeanne’s intermittent shouts resounded in the villa.

“How long will Madam be in labor?” Teddy could not help asking.

It was also because of the cry that he was woken up, and then he also stood at the door, waiting.

Waiting for the birth of Little Miss.

“It depends on the condition of the pregnant woman.” Dr. Jones replied, “Some people can give birth in two hours, and some people... can’t even deliver in two days and two nights.”

“No way.” Teddy was obviously frightened.

Dr. Jones looked at Edward.

Seeing him still standing there, motionless.

He had no idea how Edward was feeling.

It was now eleven o’clock in the morning.

The delivery took eight hours.

Jeanne’s powerful voice in the beginning became obviously weaker now.

Dr. Jones seemed a little uneasy, he said, “I’ll go in and have a look.”

Edward neither nodded nor refused.

Dr. Jones still could not grasp what Edward was thinking right now.

What else could he think?

The birth of a new life was something to look forward to…

Yet for them, it became such a contradictory existence.

Dr. Jones pushed open the door of the delivery room to enter.

The doctor inside was also a little tired. She said, “According to Ms. Lawrence’s current condition, a normal delivery will not be very smooth. The night passed but only managed four-finger wide of dilation. If this continues, the baby may be hypoxic, so we recommend a C-section.”

Dr. Jones turned to look at Edward.

At the beginning, Edward might still have some emotions, but now Edward was just too indifferent.

“Fourth Master.” Dr. Jones called him.

His eyes moved slightly, “Okay.”

Okay.

It was a simple word.

That was it, uttered ever so softly.

A C-section would take up to half an hour.

In other words, after half an hour...

Dr. Jones pursed his lips, and he said to the doctor, “Get ready for a C-section.”

“Alright.”

The doctor went in.

After a while, he came out again.

“What’s wrong?” Dr. Jones asked.

“Ms. Lawrence refused the C-section.”

Dr. Jones was helpless.

“Does it need to be enforced?” asked the doctor.

To them, Jeanne was just a reproduction tool, so they were not emotionally involved.

“Let her have a natural delivery,” Edward said.

The doctor said no more and went in again.

...

Two hours later at one o’clock in the afternoon, Teddy was so anxious that he almost jumped.

Those people inside were all highly skilled doctors, but they had not come out for so long. Moreover, to be delivered at home where the environment was not the best. What if something happened to the wife and the baby?!

Teddy could not keep calm at all.

Dr. Jones was actually not that calm either.

On the contrary, Edward was really too calm.

In the delivery room, Jeanne’s voice was not heard much as she was past the point of exhaustion.

The doctor opened the door again.

“Fourth Master, I suggest a C-section. If you insist on natural birth, the baby will be in danger.” The doctor’s attitude was obviously much firmer this time.

Well, obviously.

It had come to a point where there was no other way.

Edward did not answer.

...

At this moment Edward, it seemed that no one could tell what he was thinking.

“Fourth Master.” The doctor was a little anxious.

Edward walked directly into the delivery room.

Inside the room, Jeanne’s face was pale and she was sweating profusely.

Her pained expression was obvious.

Her whole being was so weak that she might faint any second.

At that moment, she still saw Edward clearly, watching him walk in suddenly.

She thought he must have come in to persuade her to have a C-section. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In actuality, she was also giving up.

She thought she could give birth to the baby naturally with her and her baby’s strengths alone.
