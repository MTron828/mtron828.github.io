Chapter 157: I’ll Never Sleep With the Woman I Don’t Like

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne was pressed under Fourth Master Swan’s body, their lips in a tight lock.

The soft bed even trapped Jeanne inside and she could not move.

Just when she felt that... a lot of things might happen.

A male voice suddenly sounded from outside the room, “Uncle Edward, what are you doing?”

It was Eden’s overly excited voice.

The two people who heard the voice did not have any special reaction.

At that moment, Jeanne could even feel Fourth Master Swan’s tongue licking her lips.

He reluctantly let go of Jeanne’s obviously red and swollen lips.

He turned his head.

He did not get up and leave Jeanne’s body. Instead, he turned around and looked at the two people at the door.

One was Eden, and the other was Melody.

At that moment, Jeanne also saw it.

She saw that the expressions of those two were extremely distorted. They probably did not expect to bump into the scene of them being intimate.

Jeanne seemed to have understood Fourth Master Swan’s sudden move.

“What am I doing? Can’t you see?” Fourth Master Swan’s low voice was very cold.

When Eden met his Uncle Edward’s gaze, he sucked in a breath of cold air.

He had been afraid of his Uncle Edward since he was young.

At this moment, the aura that his Uncle Edward suddenly emitted really made him tremble.

He gritted his teeth and did not dare to speak anymore.

He was only mad with anger in his heart.

Jeanne was actually on his Uncle Edward’s bed!

This woman was actually shameless to this extent!

Eden was not the only one who was also angry.

Melody’s face was red with anger.

She came here only to warn Jeanne. She only wanted to tell this woman directly that she was just Edward’s shield. However, at this moment, when she really saw the scene of them entangled together, she could not find her words.

She did not know if this was Edward’s intention. Her mind was filled with the image of Jeanne sleeping on Edward’s bed and her being under Edward’s body. They were doing things that could not be described between a man and a woman.

Regardless of the relationship between Edward and Jeanne, regardless of whether Edward was really using Jeanne as a shield, regardless of whether he liked Jeanne or not, Melody only had one thought at the moment.

She wanted Jeanne to die.

“You’re not leaving? Are you planning to watch us?” Fourth Master Swan’s face darkened.

That kind of aura would make people fearful.

Eden wanted to leave.

Even if he was so angry that he wanted to kill someone, at that moment, he still instinctively wanted to leave.

He wanted to turn around.

“Edward!” Melody suddenly spoke. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Eden looked at her.

“The more you act like this, the more I have to have you!” Melody enunciated each word.

Edward smiled.

When he smiled, it was very cruel.

“A fruit that is forcefully obtained will never be sweet.” Edward sneered. “Ms. Sanders is a princess of Harken, so it’s best not to bring disgrace upon yourself.”

“You are just humiliating yourself!” Melody was furious. She no longer cared about her identity and image. “I know you deliberately slept with Jeanne for me to give up on you. Do you think that I’ll really believe that you like Jeanne? If you really liked her, you wouldn’t have let me know that you like her. You knew that I would take revenge on her!”

Edward’s expression turned cold.

Melody said fiercely to Jeanne, “Jeanne, you’re really stupid! Do you really think that Edward loves you? He’s just using you, using you to reject me. Now that you’re lying under Edward, are you proud of yourself? Actually, in your current state, what’s the difference between you and a prostitute?”

“Melody Sanders,” Edward called her by her name.

His cold voice carried waves of coldness.

Eden, who was beside her, did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Ever since he was young, he had never seen his Uncle Edward throwing such a huge tantrum.

Even if he was angry, he would not show it so clearly.

At this moment, Melody was also stunned by Edward’s sudden anger.

However, she could use her identity to not give in.

“I have never slept with a woman I don’t like.” Edward enunciated each word clearly.

Melody’s eyes were red.

What did he mean by sleep?

“As for the matter of liking Jeanne, I am not only letting you know, but I’m letting everyone in the world know about this. Don’t think too highly of yourself.” Edward’s words were piercing.

Melody could not hold back her tears and they fell crazily.

“Moreover, even if you know, do you really think you can harm Jeanne?” Edward’s eyes narrowed.

At that moment, the bloodlust in the air was extremely obvious.

Melody’s emotions exploded. Being mocked by Edward, she screamed, “Edward!”
