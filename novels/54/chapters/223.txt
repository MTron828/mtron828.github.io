Chapter 224: Slap Alexander Hard in the Face

Jeanne still ignored Alexander.

She could imagine Alexander’s anger. After so many years, other than Jonathan, no one in this family would dare to ignore him like this. No one would dare to challenge his bottom line like this.

Her indifference could really anger Alexander to death.

Alexander jumped up from the sofa and strode toward Jeanne.

Jenifer was also frightened by how Alexander was acting.

Nonetheless, when she thought of how this temper was directed at Jeanne, not only was she not afraid, but she was also gloating.

Jeanne’s face darkened.

She could feel Alexander approaching menacingly.

Without needing to think, she knew what he wanted to do!

Jeanne protected George behind her because she did not want him to be hurt.

She turned around and faced Alexander coldly.

She looked at him coldly as he walked over and raised his palm fiercely.

Jeanne suddenly stopped him.

Alexander’s expression was extremely ugly.

His face was ferocious, but at this moment, he could not break free from Jeanne’s shackles.

“Jeanne!” Alexander looked as if he wanted to kill her. “Do you think that this is a place where you can do whatever you want?!”

Jeanne grabbed Alexander’s arm and fiercely pushed him a few steps back.

Alexander took a few steps back.

He was somewhat frightened by Jeanne’s strength.

The last time in his office, Jeanne had also flown into a rage once.

Alexander stared fiercely at Jeanne.

Jeanne said coldly, “It’s not a place for me to do whatever I want, but it’s also not a place for you to do whatever you want to me!”

“Jeanne, believe it or not, I’ll kick you out immediately!” Alexander threatened.

Jeanne suddenly smiled.

She smiled contemptuously.

Alexander seemed to be embarrassed by Jeanne’s smile.

It was as if he was asking for humiliation.

He heard Jeanne say, “You can try.”

“Don’t threaten me here. Do you think that the Lawrences can’t live without you? Don’t you have just a little money? You’re so self-righteous! Do you think that the Lawrences want that little money of yours?!” Alexander said through gritted teeth.

“Since you say so, I’ll pack up and leave.” Jeanne was calm and composed. At this moment, no emotions could be seen on her face. “Dad, don’t regret it.”

“You can’t threaten me!”

“I’m just reminding you that you can’t take back what you said after this,” Jeanne said, “Of course, you’re the head of the family, so your decisions are the orders. With just a word from you, I’ll listen to whatever you say. Don’t worry, I’ll leave immediately.”

As she said this, she even smiled.

She turned around and held George’s hand. She said to George in a low voice, “George, haven’t you always wanted to leave? Now, I’ll satisfy your wish.”

As she said this, she planned to leave with George.

Alexander looked at Jeanne’s manner and saw that she did not seem to care at all. He was so angry that he was trembling.

Jeanne treated him lightly!

‘What’s the big deal if she has a bit of money?!

‘I don’t care!

‘I don’t care about that bit of money. I wouldn’t fawn over her because of that.

‘No matter how powerful she is, she can’t do whatever she wants here.’

“What happened!”

All of a sudden, Jonathan’s stern voice rang out in the hall.

Jonathan was pushed out of the elevator by a servants

Alexander and Jeanne had just finished arguing, and Jeanne was about to go upstairs.

When Jeanne heard Jonathan’s voice, she stopped in her tracks and lowered her head to say something to George.

George obediently went upstairs on his own.

“You can’t be at peace anymore, can you?!” Jonathan’s angry voice was directed at Alexander as he lectured him fiercely, “You’re so old, yet you don’t know your limits. Our family has come to this point, Alexander. You have to take full responsibility!”

Alexander was suddenly scolded by Jonathan. He was extremely embarrassed.

Even so, he was still the head of the family. Although Jonathan was still in charge of the Lawrences, he was the face of the family. What would happen to his image if he was scolded like this In front of Jenifer and Jeanne?

Alexander said unwillingly, “What’s wrong with the development of the Lawrences? All these years, I’ve been working diligently, supporting the entire operation of the Lawrences...”

“Shut up!” Jonathan did not listen to Alexander’s explanation at all. “How dare you say that you’ve supported the Lawrences? If it wasn’t for Jeanne coming back this time to take down the e-commerce collaboration with MUK, the Lawrences would’ve been bankrupt sooner or later!”

Alexander was blushing red from Jonathan’s words.

“Don’t think that you can do whatever you want. Don’t make me revoke your management rights to the Lawrences!”

“Dad!” Alexander was a little agitated.

“In my opinion, Jeanne is stronger than you! She’s more suitable for your position!” Jonathan said mercilessly.

“Dad, what do you mean?! You mean you want to hand the Lawrence Enterprise over to Jeanne!” Alexander looked at Jonathan in disbelief.

“If you continue to be so ungrateful, it’s not impossible!”

“Dad...”

“Shut up!” Jonathan seemed to not want to hear another word from him.

Alexander’s face was completely twisted, looking very hideous.

Jonathan did not care at all. He said to Jeanne, “Jeannie, come to my room with me.”

“Okay.” Jeanne naturally had a lot of respect for Jonathan.

No matter what, the person in this family who could make Alexander lose face was Jonathan.

Jeanne walked toward Jonathan and took the initiative to push Jonathan’s wheelchair. Then, they went up the elevator.

Alexander was so mad that he fiercely kicked the flower pot in the living room.

The flower pot fell to the ground, and a violent sound suddenly rang out.

Jenifer was so scared that she did not dare to speak.

Alexander’s anger was clear to see. If she were to approach him at this time, she would only be courting death.

Nevertheless, at this moment, she sensed a crisis after seeing Jonathan treating Alexander like that.

If this continued...

Would Jonathan really hand over the Lawrence Enterprise to Jeanne?

If that was the case…

‘No!

‘I won’t let that happen!’ Jenifer thought.

…

Jeanne followed Jonathan into his study.

Jonathan seemed to have been slightly affected after shouting a few times. At this moment, he was holding a cup of tea and quietly recuperating. He did not speak.

Jeanne did not take the initiative to speak either. She stood by the side obediently and waited for his instructions.

She was delighted that Jonathan was able to stand up for her and make Alexander look bad.

Despite that, Jonathan was probably not doing it for her.

He was only doing it for benefits.

Hence, Jeanne did not need to be moved.

She only needed to put on an act and act with him.

Jonathan finished his tea and slowly put it down. “You’ve indeed impressed me.”

“Grandpa, you flatter me.”

“Where did the 53 billion dollars come from?”

“Would you believe me if I said I borrowed it?” Jeanne smiled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Borrowed it? From whom?”

“Grandpa, don’t ask anymore.” Jeanne’s tone was gentle, but she rejected him directly.

Jonathan looked at Jeanne as if he was sizing her up.

Jeanne was calm and indifferent.

“Alright, you’re an adult anyway. You know what to do with your own matters.”

“Yes.” Jeanne was respectful.

“There’s nothing else. Go back to your room and rest.”

“Grandpa,” Jeanne took the initiative to call him, “I have something to tell you.”

Jonathan looked at her.

“Grandpa, don’t you think there’s something fishy about the logistics warehouse project of the Lawrence Enterprise?”

“Why do you say that?”

“Adrian and Tenda are colluding well, and they’re earning money by themselves. Why did they suddenly frame me?! Don’t you think there’s something fishy going on here?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

Jonathan frowned slightly.

“I won’t beat around the bush. The person who wanted to frame me was none other than Joshua!”

She said it in an affirmative tone.

At this moment, Jonathan’s expression changed drastically!
