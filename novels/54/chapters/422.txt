Chapter 423: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

“Is there anything else?” Monica listened very seriously.

“Dr. Jones’s mysophobia is very serious. He has to have his body wiped every day, and you have to do it three times a day.”

F*ck!

Did that mean she had touched Finn three times every day?

“Oh, right. Dr. Jones can barely get up, so the doctor gave him a catheter. If he wants to go to the bathroom, please help him there. The doctor said that Dr. Jones must not fall now.”

“Oh, okay.”

“Well, I’ll wait outside. If you have anything, you can call me.”

“Hurry up and go out.” Monica’s face was full of impatience.

With that, the nurse left.

Monica turned back to look at Finn, thinking how much longer Finn would be asleep.

Just like that, she looked at him anxiously and then waited for him to wake up.

She waited for a long time.

Could it be that Finn had fainted?

......

Monica was frightened, so she quickly used her hand to feel if Finn was still breathing. After trying to feel it for a long time, she reckoned he was still breathing.

However, to double confirm, she listened to his heartbeat.

The moment she placed her feet on the ground and lay her head on Finn’s chest, she heard his heart beating faster and faster.

“Ba-dump. Ba-dump. Ba-dump... Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump...”

Monica frowned.

Why was his heart beating faster and faster? Could it be that something was wrong again?

She hurriedly got up from Finn’s body and was about to ring the bell.

“Monica.” Suddenly, a familiar voice called out to her.

Startled, Monica quickly turned around and looked at Finn, who had opened his eyes.

When he opened his eyes, her face was very red.

Could it be that he was having a fever?

She quickly touched his forehead. “Finn, are you alright? Are you feeling unwell? Your face is so red, and your heart is beating so fast. I’ll call a doctor for you right away.”

“I’m fine,” Finn said.

“How can you be fine? I’d better get a doctor to take a look at you.” Monica was flustered.

“I’m really fine.”

“You’re fine? If so, why is your face so red and your heart beating so fast?”

Finn gritted his teeth. “You’re disturbing me.”

Monica was stunned.

Finn said, “You’re disturbing me. I need a quiet environment.”

Monica looked at Finn and felt a little upset.

She sat quietly beside Finn and calmed down while Finn was also quietly adjusting her breathing.

Actually… He was not sleeping at all.

He had even overheard the conversation between her and Nox, not to mention the conversation with the nurse.

The ward suddenly became quiet.

Instead of saying anything, Monica just looked at him helplessly.

Finn also gradually calmed down and did not say anything.

Suddenly, the room fell silent.

“How’s your ankle?” Finn suddenly asked.

It was because Monica was never a person who could stay quiet. Wherever she was, there would always be chatter and laughter, so now that it had suddenly become so quiet, he felt uncomfortable.

Fine. He admitted that he did not want to make Monica feel upset or want her to change anything for him.

Otherwise, he would be heartbroken.

Finn took the initiative to speak, but there was no response after a long time.

He frowned and looked at Monica, who kept her small mouth shut.

“Monica?” Finn called out to her.

Monica still did not speak.

Feeling speechless, Finn said, “You can speak now.”

Only then did Monica say, “I’ve had the surgery. The doctor said that as long as I don’t fall, I’ll recover soon.”

“Be more careful,” Finn reminded her.

“Okay.” Monica nodded obediently.

In the past, she would never be so obedient. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What about you? Do you feel unwell?” Monica asked.

“I’m recovering very well,” Finn replied.

“Finn,” Monica called out to him.

“Hmm?”

“I broke up with Michael.”

Finn’s eyes flickered.

He had actually overheard the conversation between her and Nox earlier. However, he was still shocked when Monica told him personally, even though there was no expression on his face.

“I will never cuckold you again.”

Finn was speechless.

“Can you promise me that you won’t be with your little darling ever again?” Monica asked.

She was very careful with her question

Finn looked at Monica, whose eyes were red.

Monica did not get an answer from Finn, so she quickly said, “In that case, don’t let me know, okay?”
