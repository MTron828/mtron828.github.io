In the vast room.

On the huge bed.

Jeanne lay on the bed and looked into Fourth Master Swan’s deep eyes. She stared straight at the wound on her collarbone.

The injury there was more serious. The broken glass of the car window pierced straight into her flesh, leaving a very deep wound that looked ferocious.

His slender fingers were using iodophor to disinfect her wound, bit by bit.

“Doesn’t it hurt?” Fourth Master Swan asked.

His voice was low and deep.

“It’s alright,” Jeanne answered.

‘It’s good that you’re used to it.’

‘Bear with it, you can get over it anyway.’ Thoughts like this appeared in Jeanne’s mind 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m in pain,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly said.

Something flashed across Jeanne’s eyes.

From her angle, she could only see Fourth Master Swan’s lowered eyes, and his eyelashes were unusually thick and curled up.

There was a hint of familiarity, and it even made her a little absent-minded.

“Am I good-looking?” Fourth Master Swan’s thin lips moved slightly.

Jeanne regained her senses and calmed her heart.

She chose to remain silent.

In a quiet room.

The medicine was applied.

The bandages were done.

Fourth Master Swan’s fingers started to move downwards.

“Fourth Master, there are no injuries inside,” Jeanne reminded.

It was only a reminder, but it did not stop him from pulling on her bathrobe.

Fourth Master Swan pursed his lips.

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at her.

“Fourth Master, if you don’t believe me, you can check it yourself.” Jeanne smiled.

When she smiled, it was enchanting and charming.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you mind?” Fourth Master Swan asked.

“You saved my life today. I can repay the fourth Master you by doing this. Fourth master, feel free to do so.” Jeanne still had a smile on her face.

His throat moved slightly.

He looked straight at Jeanne, watching her speak calmly.

He said, “Do you not care?”

“Even if I do care, if you really want it, can I resist?” Jeanne said indifferently.

So why struggle?

“Ms.Lawrence, you really do understand.” Fourth Master Swan’s voice was neither cold nor warm.

It was really difficult for others to guess his thoughts.

She could not even sense that Fourth Master Swan was interested in her body.

The two of them just looked at each other.

Fourth Master Swan’s slender fingers once again placed on her messy bathrobe. However, he was tidying up her bathrobe to cover her body.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

Actually, she did not care that much.

She tidied up her clothes.

Fourth Master Swan said, “Are there any other wounds?”

“No.”

“Then you can lie down and rest for a while. When your clothes are delivered, I will send you back.”

“Thank you, Fourth Master.”

Fourth Master Swan stood up and walked out of the room.

Jeanne lay on Fourth Master Swan’s big bed.

Honestly, she was not used to it.

There seemed to be a unique smell of him on the bed.

Actually, it was just the smell of shower gel.

Even her body had the same smell now.

It was refreshing and clean.

She closed her eyes.

She was not sleeping but was thinking about something.

She was thinking about what other tricks the other party could pull at this time.

And that other party.

Melody and Micheal were indeed thinking of countermeasures.

Melody could not hide her anger. “Eden is really good-for-nothing.”

“This time, it really can’t be all Eden’s fault.” Micheal was not trying to put in a good word for Eden, but after calming down, he spoke the truth. “Leaving aside those strategies in business, Jeanne has been abroad for so many years and managed to reach the position of marketing director. Her ability is definitely not to be underestimated. Of course, even so, as a member of the Swans, and as a businessman who has some experience in business, Eden still can’t be compared to Jeanne. I won’t deny questioning his ability. But today’s mistake wasn’t because of Eden’s incapabilities. It was because Jeanne was too unexpected.”

Melody gritted her teeth.

“None of us expected Jeanne to have such astonishing power. Before you really experienced this accident, would you know that Jeanne’s control of the car has already exceeded the ability of a professional racer? I just took the video of Jeanne racing from the traffic control hall. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s already superb.”

“How on earth did that woman have this ability?” Melody said fiercely.

“I’m also very curious. I think we should start investigating Jeanne’s background now and not rashly go against her. Previously, we thought Jeanne was too simple.”

“No!” Melody could not accept it, “I spent so much effort to fight with her this time, I can’t just admit defeat.”

“Melody.”

“No matter what, I will never let her logistics warehouse project go smoothly. I must make her pay a price.”
