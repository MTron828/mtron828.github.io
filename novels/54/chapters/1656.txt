Chapter 1657: Shelly’s Smart Response

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly was slightly relieved after hearing what Benjamin said. Even though she and Bella were left with a table full of food, as long as he was fine, all was good.

Shelly and Benjamin exchanged a few more words before hanging up reluctantly.

“Is Uncle Ben not coming?” Bella asked.

Shelly nodded. “He’ll come over tomorrow. Let’s eat.”

“Oh, okay.” Bella nodded obediently. “I really miss Uncle Ben.”

Shelly smiled. ‘Yes, I miss Benjamin too.’

The next day, at 10 a.m. in the morning, all the passengers underwent a physical examination again. After confirming that they were all fine, they left the ward.

Benjamin had planned to take a bus to Shelly’s place, but he received a call from the school. Hence, he had no choice but to return to school, where the counselor and the dean were waiting for him in the office.

After saying a bunch of stuff, the dean could not suppress his excitement anymore and told Benjamin, “Benjamin, congratulations! You have a chance to go abroad to further your studies!”

Benjamin was surprised. He had never applied to go abroad, so how could there be such an opportunity all of a sudden?

“Do you find it unbelievable? We’ve kept it from you for a long time. We were afraid you would be disappointed, so we decided to tell you now that we’ve confirmed everything. Instead of going for an internship next year, you’ll go abroad for a year. And when you come back, the value of your graduation certificate will be different from others.” The dean was very excited. “Currently, there is only one spot for the entire university. After thinking about it, we have decided to give this opportunity to you.”

Benjamin was still shocked.

His grades were usually not bad, and he could be considered to be in the top ten achievers in the university, but he was not ranked first or second. Why did they not give such a good opportunity to someone more outstanding, and why would they give it to him?

While he was in disbelief, he still felt grateful. He said, “Thank you for your affirmation, Dean. I’m also very happy to have the opportunity to further my studies overseas. However, with my personal situation, I really don’t have the means to go abroad, and my family’s financial situation can’t support my expenses to study abroad. I’m really grateful to you for giving me the opportunity, but I’m really sorry to disappoint you. This opportunity should be given to others.”

“Benjamin, do you know why I gave you this opportunity? It’s because of your family’s situation, or I could have given it to someone with better results. The main reason is that this study abroad program is almost free, and you don’t have to spend a single cent. The cost of studying abroad is all covered, including air tickets, accommodation, and three meals a day. As long as you study hard and don’t embarrass our school, you don’t have to consider the other expenses.”

The offer attracted Benjamin’s attention. Firstly, he could study abroad for a year, which would definitely help his future as companies nowadays value candidates who had studied abroad. Secondly, he did not have to pay for his

studies, making it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It he did not take it, he would miss out on the opportunity for the rest of his life. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Benjamin, go back and prepare yourself. Make sure to also tell your parents so that they are mentally prepared. You’ll set off in a week. Because there are many research projects happening during the summer at the University of Celte, we hope that you can join them as soon as possible.”

“University of Celte?” Benjamin could not believe it.

It was one of the top universities in the world, and it was really hard for him to reject such a school.

“Yes, the University of Celte’s Department of Finance. Once you return from this school, you can enter any financial company in Harken.” The dean said excitedly, “Benjamin, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Cherish it!”

Benjamin pursed his lips tightly. To him, the temptation was indeed great. If he went abroad to further his studies for a year, it might save him at least five years of hard work. Who would say no to a shortcut to success? He even thought that when he returned a year later, he could give Shelly a better life.

He gave it a lot of thought before he took a deep breath and rejected the offer. “I’m sorry, Dean. I don’t think I’ll go.”

As soon as he said that, the dean was shocked. He did not think that Benjamin would reject his offer. In fact, when he received that offer and saw the conditions, he believed that no student would reject it.

The other party had also mentioned Benjamin by name, and based on the dean’s understanding of Benjamin, he believed Benjamin would not reject him..
