Chapter 839 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

Nonetheless, Finn was only expressionless in front of others.

Finn, Nox, and Edward had practically grown up together.

Finn did not try to hide his emotions in front of them.

“That’s true.” Nox suddenly wanted to say something but stopped.

Finn looked at him.

“Having a son doesn’t seem to be a bad thing.” Nox concluded.

He thought about George feeding Edward.

For some reason, he felt very warm.

He also felt a little touched.

‘Does George know his parents’ situation now?!’

For some reason, Nox felt a little sorry for George.

“Don’t you have a child bride?” Finn reminded.

“You mean Shelly?” Nox looked disgusted as if he had eaten a fly. “I’ll never have a child with her in my life! I’m afraid that my child’s looks will be ruined.”

“…”

“I’m about to starve to death. Aren’t you hungry?” Nox quickly changed the topic.

Nox lived a clear life. He would not think too much and would not dwell on things too much. He only focused on what he wanted to do. As for other things that he did not care about, he would not even think about them. Thus, he lived a carefree life.

“Come, let’s go down to eat.” Nox suggested.

“Let Teddy accompany Fourth Master Swan first. He can’t be left alone now,” Finn said.

“I’ll go get him. You can come down to eat in a while.”

“Alright,” Finn said.

Nox walked out first.

After a while, Teddy walked in.

Since it was the weekend, George did not go to school.

Hence, he followed Teddy and entered Edward’s room.

Edward looked at George and smiled.

He closed his eyes and went to sleep.

He would think of many things but because of his weak body, he quickly fell asleep again.

In the living room downstairs, Finn and Nox were having breakfast.

Nox was probably starving, so he gobbled down his food very quickly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Finn was relatively more civilized.

As he ate, he said, “I’ll go back and pack a few clothes after dinner.”

“Do you want to stay here for the night?”

“Fourth Master needs to be taken care of.”

“Then I’ll stay here too,” Nox said without even thinking.

The three of them had not been under the same roof for a long time.

When they were young, they were sent for training. The three of them lived together and even slept under the same blanket.

Nox was younger than Edward and Finn by a few years.

He had to sleep in the middle every time.

It was just that he was like a little kid who was very dependent on them.

In fact, they had not spent much time together other than physical combat training.

The three of them had different specialized training directions.

Finn studied medicine, so he would be locked up in a small room after training to dissect corpses and study drugs. The first time Finn faced a dead person was when he was 12 years old. At that time, he was locked in the room with the corpse for a full 72 hours without eating or drinking. It was only because he did not dare to make a move on the corpse. In the end, he did it.

People had to be forced.

They either forced themselves to their deaths or to live.

Finn chose to live.

For a long time after that, he was almost always with corpses.

Different corpses had different body organs.

Finn was terrified, disgusted, and against it at first. Later, he became indifferent.

He became indifferent to anything he saw.

Rather than saying that Finn’s indifference to love was innate, it was better to say that he was not given many opportunities in his life to warm up to people.

Nox, on the other hand, mainly studied business.

On the surface, the Swans’ main focus was still business. Nox needed to assist their development in business. Therefore, after Nox’s physical training, he would go to another place to study finance. Since he was young, he had been exposed to all kinds of financial knowledge. As far as he remembered, he spent a long time crying while memorizing words he did not understand at all.

As for Edward, he had to learn everything.

Edward had to face everything.

His training was much more than Finn and Nox’s.

Every time Finn and Nox were sent for training, Edward would already be there. After they left, he would still be there.

For so many years.

From the age of 6 to 8 or even younger, Edward underwent all sorts of cruel training.

Sometimes, they were so brutal that even Finn and Nox, who were training with Edward, could not imagine it.

However, the three of them persevered throughout the years.
