936 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

Therefore, she went home to take a nap and regain her energy. Then, she called her mother to make sure that her father’s condition was stable before she went to the headquarters of the Cardellini Pharmaceutical Group.

She had been here before, but she worked in fits and starts until she found all sorts of reasons not to go to work.

Now, she finally had no choice.

She felt that God was still fair. No one could get everything without hard work, and there would always be retribution for what you did not work for.

When she showed up at the company, it instantly caused a huge commotion, especially when she went straight into her father’s office and sat in her father’s seat.

His father’s secretary, Tim Burts, quickly walked in.

Monica looked at him.

Considering that even the secretary was a man, her father’s desire to live before her mother was really strong.

“Ms. Cardellini,” Tim replied respectfully.

“Mr. Burts, you should know about my dad’s situation. He’s currently hospitalized and can’t work for the time being, so I’ll be in charge of my dad’s work for this period of time,” Monica said bluntly.

Tim tried to look calm, but even though he had practiced it many times to make himself look very calm, he was still a little surprised.

However, his professionalism made him look calm. He said, “Okay, Ms. Cardellini. Feel free to let me know if you need anything.”

“Call Mr. Warren, I have some things to ask him.”

“Alright.” Tim agreed.

Monica took a deep breath and told herself that it should be fine if she maintained that demeanor.

Hence, she pretended to turn on the computer and saw Steve walk in from outside the office. When he saw Monica, he also looked surprised. “Ms. Cardellini, what’s wrong?”

“My dad’s health condition doesn’t allow him to come to work, so I’ll take his place.”

Steve cast a few glances at Monica, who tried her best to keep calm.

“Have a seat.” Monica gestured for Steve to sit opposite her.

Steve hesitated for a moment before he nodded and sat down.

“My dad’s health isn’t great right now, so I’ll be in charge of the company for him for the time being. I know the company must have encountered some problems, or my dad wouldn’t have wanted to come to the company and look for you even with his poor health. However, the doctor suggested that he should rest in bed, so I will help my dad with his work.”

“That’s good, but…” Steve did not speak frankly.

He was afraid that if he said it out loud, it would hurt Monica.

In fact, Monica could guess so too. “My dad trusts you very much, so I won’t pretend in front of you. I really don’t know anything about work, and I’ve been living a comfortable life since I was a child, so I’ve never encountered any setbacks. But since I’ve come to the company, I’m ready for everything. I’ll try my best to learn what I don’t know, and I hope Mr. Warren can help me.”

“Of course, that’s my duty. However, this is not a good time for you to come to the company to learn, Ms. Cardellini,” Steve said bluntly.

“Has something big happened to the company?” Monica asked.

Steve nodded. “I told you in the hospital before that our new drugs are in an awkward position in the industry because of the time it’ll hit the market. The plan we’ve decided on has to be delayed because of the chairman’s sudden illness. As far as I know, Sunny Pharmaceutical has banned all the hospital drug chain stores to stock the drug that we wanted to release. If we hit the market now, the effect will be bad.”

Monica listened carefully.

“This is only the first problem we’ve encountered so far. The second is that because the vaccine we produced has killed children, it is now being investigated by the quality supervision department. If there’s no problem with the vaccine, it’s fine, but if there is, Cardellini Pharmaceutical will bear a lot of the responsibility. It may also lead to your father’s criminal charge, and this can be a felony. In Harken, the sentence for drug and food safety is usually very heavy.”

“My dad is very sure that there’s no problem with the vaccine.” Monica was very determined.

“I’m sure of it too.” The assistant, Mr. Warren said, “There’s definitely no problem with our vaccine, so there’s no need to worry too much. However, whether there is a problem with the vaccine itself will have a huge impact on our company. Right now, all the rumors in the market are spreading, saying that there is a quality problem with our medicine. Not only will the pharmaceutical companies and major hospitals want a refund on previous purchases of medicine, but the patients will also deliberately refuse to use our medicine. Many medicinal company companies are now wanting a refund, and once we do that... our funds will be severely affected. If we can’t push out our products, the Cardellini Enterprise will face bankruptcy in less than three months.”
