882 They Gave Up on Each Other

“In that case, don’t let Alex go,” Nox suggested.

“He has to go. If he doesn’t go, it’ll be even more suspicious.” Edward denied it. “The Sanders will definitely check the invitation list one by one. Once they can’t find that person at the venue, they’ll lock onto those who didn’t go. This will increase the possibility of Alex being exposed.”

“What if they get the DNA? The Sanders won’t even let a fly go.” Nox was very sure about that.

“That is why we have to think about a way to protect Alex so that the Sanders won’t get his DNA.”

“This is too f*cking difficult.” Nox was a little speechless.

Finn also thought that it was a little difficult, and that was why he did not give a constructive suggestion.

Suddenly, silence filled the hall.

“Let’s think about how they’re going to get him first,” Finn suddenly said.

“How do you think they will do it?” Edward asked.

“I think no matter how bad the Sanders are, they won’t do anything too overboard at such a huge banquet. After all, the people who come would all be high-ranking officials and nobles. The leader can’t embarrass himself, so he would do it in secret.”

Edward nodded in agreement.

“And the easiest way to get a DNA sample is through the hair.”

“You mean the Sanders will secretly collect the hair of each guest.”

“That’s right.” Finn nodded.

“As long as we pay attention at the wedding and change Alex’s hair out,” Edward said firmly.

“Right.”

“Okay.” Edward made a prompt decision. “I’ve received the invitation to the wedding on the 15th, so I will attend it. Since Alex also received the invitation, he will be there. Nox will come with me. Finn, you’ll pretend to be a hotel staff and sneak in to protect Alex secretly.”

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“Prepare a strand of hair in advance and be prepared to swap it. Use… hair from anyone on the street.” Edward said, “It can’t be anyone around us. Otherwise, we’ll be exposed.”

“I’ll go to the street to pull a strand of someone’s hair right away.” Nox was a little excited.

“Let me finish,” Edward called out to Nox, who sat down obediently.

“In order to prevent the Sanders from worrying about us, I will bring George along. If anything happens, Nox, help me take care of George,” Edward said seriously.

“Don’t worry.” Nox agreed immediately.

“I repeat, during the wedding banquet on the 15th, Finn is mainly responsible for protecting Alex. We can’t let his DNA be taken away. If he is discovered, ensure that he is escorted away safely. Nox will be in charge of George’s safety. I will leave everything to you!”

“Okay,” Finn and Nox said in unison.

“By the way…” Nox suddenly looked at Edward. “Will the Hills be there on the day of the banquet?”

“Probably,” Edward said.

“Will Jeanne come?”

“Perhaps.” Edward pursed his lips.

At that moment, the emotions in his eyes were clear.

“If you fight her head-on…” Nox was worried.

Edward would be beaten to death by Jeanne. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’ll try to avoid it.”

“Edward, you and Jeanne…” Nox said with frustration.

“We might,” Edward said firmly.

Nox swallowed what he wanted to say.

Anyway, Edward had the final say.

Since he said that he and Jeanne still had a chance, Finn would wish him well.

“It’s getting late. You guys should head back.” Edward ordered them to leave. “The relevant details have been given, and I’ll inform you guys when it’s time. Just prepare yourselves.”

“Okay.”

Finn and Nox left without saying anything else.

Nox sat in Finn’s car. It was obvious that Nox drove here, but he was too lazy to drive back.

“Isn’t it cruel to have you attend Monica’s wedding?” Nox suddenly asked.

Finn knew that the reason why Nox was so enthusiastic about getting a ride from him was definitely not because he was lazy.

“It’s not cruel.”

“Huh?”

“Yeah.” Finn’s face was expressionless.

“You can really let go, huh?” Seeing that Finn did not have any reaction, he just leaned against the passenger seat with his legs crossed. “I thought you loved Monica a lot.”

“That’s in the past, and that’s why I can let it go. It’s over.”

“In that case, why don’t you teach Edward that? Teach him how to let go of a relationship,” Nox said. “I’m really afraid that he’ll die at Jeanne’s hands sooner or later.”
