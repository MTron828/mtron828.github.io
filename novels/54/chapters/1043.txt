1044 If She Fails, She’ll Get Back Up Again

There was no need to torture herself. Life was short, and it was not worth it!

When Lucy pushed open the door to Kerby’s room, she was stunned for two seconds.

Assassins could be the most relaxed in the Hills, so they might not lock the door.

Moreover, as long as one did not do anything that violated the Hills’ principles, there was no need to lock the door.

Hence, it was normal for assassins to see anything.

For example, Lucy was watching Kerby sleep with a female assassin.

She turned around and was about to leave, thinking there was no need to disturb him at that time.

“Ms. Harmon,” Kerby suddenly called her.

Lucy stopped in her tracks.

At that moment, the female assassin who was under Kerby had left his side.

Lucy took a look.

Kerby told the female assassin to leave. Then, the female assassin wrapped a towel around herself and covered her body.

“Are you here to look for me?” Kerby was still very respectful to Lucy.

He did not dare to blame Lucy for him almost being castrated.

“You can continue,” Lucy said.

However, the female assassin had been called away by Kerby.

“I can’t continue, so I don’t want to waste Ms. Harmon’s time.” Kerby was very straightforward.

Lucy could not help but look down at Kerby’s body.

Kerby said, “I just found out that my mind is really not strong enough. I probably can’t be a qualified assassin.”

“No, it’s just that you haven’t been an assassin long enough to adjust to your best condition.”

“But I’ve been greatly affected over the past few days. I just can’t calm myself down. I used to be very conceited, especially with K01’s encouragement. I thought I would be like him one day, but only now do I realize that the gap between us is too big.” Kerby laughed at himself.

“You can’t do it all the time?” Lucy asked him.

She was obviously asking about his body.

After all, Lucy had seen it with her own eyes.

“I wanted to use this method to vent my emotions and adjust my mentality. However, I didn’t think that every time I did it, I would suddenly recall what happened on the operating table that day. Once it’s in my mind, I would… have no reaction, just like what you saw just now. I’m always in that state.”

“Have you switched to a female assassin with better skills?” Lucy asked him.

“There are only a few assassins at our level whom I can sleep with.”

Kerby was not complaining.

It was a fact.

The Hills treated their assassins according to their levels. Although Kerby was a rising star, the treatment she was receiving now was the most ordinary.

Lucy knew very well what that previous female assassin’s skill level was.

She said, “I’ll find two for you so that you can try the better ones.”

“No need,” Kerby refused.

“You can give it a try.” Lucy felt that when it came to matters between men and women, a different person could give a completely different effect.

“I don’t want to make things difficult for you.” Kerby said bluntly, “Back then, I hadn’t really met Mr. Thorn before and had only heard rumors that he was very powerful and authoritative. However, because I had never experienced it personally, everything about Mr. Thorn was just a rumor, and it didn’t make me afraid of him. But now that I’ve seen it for myself, I’m overwhelmed by a sense of fear. I wouldn’t dare to provoke him again, nor would I dare to ask you to do something that goes against the Hills and against Mr. Thorn.”

Lucy remained silent.

That incident must have left a deep trauma in Kerby.

“The girls you find for me must be something that I can’t have at my current level, and I don’t dare to cross the line again,” Kerby explained.

He was just afraid.

In fact, the last emotion that an assassin should have was fear. The moment he was afraid, he was completely crippled.

She said, “I will ask for Mr. Thorn’s permission.”

Kerby looked at her. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Kerby, as an assassin, it’s one thing to abide by your principles, but it’s also important for you to be in your best state. You can’t become timid just because you’re afraid of some things. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult for you to carry out missions in the future.”

Kerby was embarrassed by Lucy’s words.

“This matter started because of me, and I will do my best to help you overcome your trauma.” Lucy was very serious.

Kerby was stunned by Lucy’s determination.

Lucy was in a life-threatening situation just like him, and she even had to pay a price for it.
