Chapter 255: Jeanne Resists: Do You Know Who I Am?!

At this point, Eden said that he still cared about his relationship with Jeanne in the past.

Micheal also listened to Melody’s dad and even advised her to let the matter rest.

Men were truly laughable.

Those who did great things should disregard everything and be cruel and cold-blooded.

Anyone who was indecisive was simply trash!

Melody’s expression was ferocious as she asked one of her bodyguards to take her phone.

She also moved her high heels away from Jeanne’s hand.

Melody said coldly to the bodyguards around her, “Lift her up!”

Next, Jeanne was lifted up by two bodyguards.

The pain in her body had made her go numb. Being treated so rudely, she did not even know where exactly the pain came from.

Jeanne looked weakly at Melody in front of her.

Other than the blood stains on her body, her skin was extremely pale.

Perhaps she would die in the next second if she could not hold on any longer.

Melody was very satisfied with Jeanne’s appearance.

She looked at Jeanne coldly and asked, “What do you think I should do to you now so that I can take revenge for you showing off to me previously?!”

Jeanne’s eyes moved.

At this moment, on her face that was as still as death, only her eyes were moving. The other parts of her face looked dead.

“Cut off your flesh one by one?!” Melody asked cruelly.

“Or cut your body into pieces?”

“Or…” Melody’s eyes narrowed, and she looked even more sinister.

Jeanne just looked at her like that.

She could imagine how cruel Melody could be.

As Melody was from the Sanders, where power was everything, she could do many things that ordinary people could not do.

Therefore, she would have all kinds of ways to torture someone. Ordinary people would not be able to imagine it!

Melody continued, “Or should I reward these men by my side? They chased you for an entire night before they brought you here. One of them even had his hand stabbed by you. They worked so hard, so I should let them enjoy your body properly. What do you think?”

Jeanne’s face turned cold.

She was indifferent just now, but she was finally showing a little bit of emotion at this time.

‘Yes.

‘This is it.’

Melody smiled.

That was it. She wanted Jeanne to live a life worse than death. Only then would she be able to alleviate all the unhappiness that she had suffered from her!

‘Making Dad scold me?!

‘Ha!

‘You’ll suffer a tragic end for going against me!’

Melody grabbed Jeanne’s chin and looked down at her face. Despite what Jeanne had gone through, she was still pretty.

At this moment, Melody said fiercely, “Jeanne, keep your pretty face for the time being and let my men have an enjoyable time. After that, I’ll make your face look unsightly!”

A sinister and terrifying voice was heard.

Jeanne looked at Melody just like that.

She looked at the perverted woman whose mind was twisted.

Jeanne tried her best to speak, “Have you thought about your end after treating me like this?”

“My end?!” Melody laughed somewhat crazily. “I’m the dignified third princess of the Sanders. I can do whatever I want and get whatever I want. Why would I need to think about my end if I want to kill you?!”

“The third princess of the Sanders?” Jeanne sneered. “Didn’t your dad tell you who I am?!”
