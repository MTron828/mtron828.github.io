Chapter 104: Divorce Without Success, Conditions Negotiated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I agree to the divorce.”

Five words.

When Monica heard that, her heart suddenly pounded.

She thought that she would be very happy. She thought that she could finally be free, but in her heart, there were some... inexplicable feelings.

“Have you decided?” Gary asked Dr. Finn.

Dr. Finn nodded. “Yes.”

Gary was a little silent.

At that moment, Monica was also unusually quiet.

On the contrary, Ruby felt that it was a pity.

Dr. Finn was really one of the best men they have met. He was responsible, he did not mess around, and had a sense of responsibility. If Monica could get along well with him, they would not have to worry about Monica being deceived by others with her naive personality.

She quickly said, “You and Monica were truly in love before. Although something happened in the middle of it, you both got through it together. Are there any misunderstandings between the both of you? Don’t be impulsive.”

“I’m not impulsive.” Dr. Finn said calmly.

Ruby wanted to say something else.

Gary suddenly became very angry. “Monica, did you hook up with Micheal Ross again?”

Monica, who was in a daze, suddenly came back to her senses.

She said, “Dad, why are you suddenly asking this?”

“You want me to beat you to death, don’t you? Don’t you remember how the Ross family chased you out back then? Now, you actually want to go back? Do you not care about my reputation at all? Monica, you’re really infuriating!”

“You only care about your reputation.” Monica pursed her lips. “Don’t you care about who I like?”

“Who do you like?” Gary looked very fierce.

“Micheal Ross.”

“You...” Gary was so angry at Monica at that moment that he almost had a heart attack. “You really want to drive me mad!”

“What can I do if I like someone? !”Monica did not care anymore and said what she wanted. “I like Micheal Ross because I like him. I want to be with him now, so it’s useless for you to say anything. I’ve made up my mind!”

“Monica!” Gary roared, “How did the Ross Family treat you back then? Don’t you have any shame?”

Monica’s eyes were red.

Actually, her father rarely scolded her so harshly.

Unless she really crossed his bottom line.

She actually knew that being with Micheal Ross would really anger her father.

But she did not want to drag it out any longer.

She had no feelings for Dr. Finn. Being together was a burden to each other, and she really had enough.

She shouted loudly, “Micheal said that in three months, he will make his family accept me. At that time, we will get married immediately.”

Gary was stunned when he heard Monica’s words.

The silent Dr. Finn also looked at Monica.

“So, I have to get a divorce immediately. I can’t delay for even a second.”

“Do you really believe what Micheal Ross said is true?” Gary asked fiercely.

“I believe him.”

“I don’t.”

“Dad, it’s my business who I live with!”

“But you grew up under your mother and my care. How can we let you go ahead and get hurt?”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She knew that every time her father played the emotional card, she would be powerless to fight back.

She bit her lips and held back her tears.

Gary’s heart actually ached a little.

Seeing his daughter cry so sadly, he felt a little sad.

There was a moment of silence.

Dr. Finn suddenly said, “Let’s get a divorce.”

Monica looked at Dr. Finn with tears in her eyes.

Dr. Finn looked at Gary. “Monica and I are indeed not suitable. Divorce is our best choice.”

When Gary heard what Dr. Finn said, he sighed heavily at that moment.

Actually, it did not have to be Dr. Finn.

Why did Monica insist on being with the Ross Family?

Back then, Monica and Micheal broke up because of the Ross Family. He had even heaved a sigh of relief because of that. Why were they involved with each other again?

He looked at his daughter and asked, “Must it be Micheal Ross?”

“It must be him.” Monica was very determined.

Dr. Finn’s throat was trembling.

“I can agree to your divorce.” Gary compromised.

“Really?” Monica looked at her father excitedly.

“But I have one condition.”

“I’ll agree to whatever condition you have.” Monica’s tears instantly turned into a smile.

“Before the Ross Family really accepts you, and before they personally acknowledge you, you must maintain your marriage with Dr. Finn.”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
