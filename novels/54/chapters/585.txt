Chapter 586: Big Shots Showing Up One After Another: Jeanne, I Know Your Identity!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the hall, as Michael held Monica in his arms, the applause was non-stop.

Monica was very repulsed by it.

However, in front of everyone, she could only force herself to smile sweetly and accept everyone’s blessings for her and Michael.

“Marry him!” Suddenly, a man’s encouraging voice sounded in the hall. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After that, more and more voices echoed.

“Marry him!”

“Marry him!”

“Marry him!”

Monica’s smile dropped.

She was really afraid that Michael would suddenly follow everyone’s wishes and propose.

It was, without a doubt, that if they could really “be together”, it would be the best for Michael.

However, Monica secretly gritted her teeth and went up to Michael’s ear.

It seemed like she was whispering intimately into his ear, but from some angles, it looked like she was kissing him.

She said, “Michael, we can’t get married.”

‘We can’t fake it either.’

Getting married and having physical intimacy was her bottom line for helping him.

The people around her now thought she had no principles. They all felt that she was too impulsive and doing herself a disadvantage when, in fact, she knew very well why she did it. She also knew very well how far she could take it. The only thing different was that she was willing to do more to help Michael than the others.

Michael listened to Monica, but his reaction was not obvious.

He had long been used to controlling every move, frown, and smile. His appearance was always controlled, so no one could tell how grim he felt at that moment.

In fact, even if Monica did not say those words today, he would not marry Monica on impulse. He knew very well that he could not rush things with Monica. This whole thing today was just a part of his improvisation because Monica came back crying from Finn’s place last night and he wanted to create a conflict between Monica and Finn again.

He did not know what happened between Monica and Finn last night.

All he needed to know was that by doing so, he would put more and more distance between Monica and Finn.

After all, the election speeches today were broadcasted live, so the entire nation could see him and Monica hugging each other.

Finn could also see them hugging.

Only after a long time did Michael let go of Monica.

He did not propose, nor did he do anything else. He simply flashed her a deep smile before turning around and returning to his seat, waiting for the results.

By then, the crowd had quieted down.

However, they all thought it was a pity that Michael did not marry Monica.

Quite a number of people shipped her and Michael’s relationship. They were not public figures, celebrities, or internet celebrities, yet netizens loved them as a couple and even called them the “national couple”. Some people even made them a topic on Twitter, and quite a number of people supported them. When the topic was at its peak popularity, the topic “national couple” was ranked third on the trending list.

Many seemed to be looking forward to their marriage and their future.

In the quiet hall, Michael won in the end as expected and became the youngest director of the quality inspection department in the history of Harken. He deserved it.

With the election ended, Monica sat in Michael’s car and went back.

Michael’s assistant, Joel Warner, sat in the front passenger seat.

In order to liven up the atmosphere, Joel kept talking about the speech, the current news, and so on.

When Monica heard Joel mention the news, she could not help but take out her phone and open the news. That was when she saw the trending news about her and Michael.

Their relationship was highly praised by the media.

The following comments kept saying, “If they weren’t together, I wouldn’t believe in love anymore!”

There were a lot of comments like those.

Monica did not expect that the matter would become so popular.

After all, Fourth Master Swan was famous in Harken. However, when he and Jeanne got married, the two of them only trended and became the subject of discussion among the netizens because of their wedding. They were not trending because of their marriage or relationship. Even the last time someone filmed the two of them choosing lingerie together, it trended only for a day.
