“Alright.” Candice helped Paige to get changed.

Paige was really a beautiful little girl. Once she put on the princess dress, she really looked like a little princess in a fairy tale. She looked extremely cute.

“Mommy, do I look good?” Paige stood in front of the full-length mirror, showing off her outfit.

“Yes, you do.” Candice nodded. “You’re the most beautiful girl in the world.”

“You’re also the most beautiful mommy in the world.” Paige’s emotional intelligence was really high.

“Let’s go downstairs and wait for Daddy.”

“Mommy, aren’t you going to get changed?” Paige asked. “Well, because I’m taking care of you, it’s better to wear something simple.” “No, I want you to be as beautiful as me,” Paige demanded.

Candice could not refuse Paige, so she went back to her room and changed into a tennis skirt and a top. She also chose a pair of Dad’s sneakers. She thought she would be able to walk better while carrying Paige in that outfit, in case Paige got tired from walking.

She even tied her hair into a bun. When her hair was up, Paige said sincerely, “Mommy, you’re so young. You look just like my sister.”

“You’re so sweet.” Candice tapped Paige’s little nose.

Her heart was also bursting with joy from Paige’s words. She figured that if she lived with Paige for a while longer, she would really become younger.

Candice took Paige’s hand and went downstairs.

They waited in the living room for a while before Edward’s assistant walked in and said respectfully, “Madam, the Leader has told me to pick you and the

Little Miss up.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Thank you.” Candice smiled politely.

She quickly led Paige out the door, where a black car was parked at the entrance, and the assistant respectfully opened the car door for Candice.

The moment Candice sat down with Paige, she was stunned as she never thought Edward would be there.

Paige did not expect her father to be in the car either. At that moment, she was wearing a fluffy princess dress, and her short legs crawled into Edward’s arms. “Daddy, do you want to go to the amusement park with us too?”

“Yes.” Edward hugged Paige and nodded.

Candice was even more surprised. She thought that perhaps he was just picking them up on the way, but she did not expect him to take the time to go have fun with them.

“Don’t you have work to do?”

“I don’t.” Edward smiled. “Besides, you guys are more important.”

‘As if! You’re bust with work everv dav.’ Candice thought.

However, his words still warmed Candice’s heart.

The car drove straight into the amusement park without them needing to buy tickets or getting off at the entrance. In fact, the amusement park was empty. Other than the staff, there was no one else.

Candice was speechless. She had originally planned to bring Paige here to experience the outside world, but what was there to experience was there was no one?

Edward seemed to have noticed the disappointment in Candice’s eyes. He said,

“Let’s wait for a while more. It’s not too safe during this period of time.”

To Edward, it might never be safe. However, Candice did not show her emotions. After all, Paige was Edward’s daughter, and she could not interfere too much.

The car stopped in front of the carousel in the amusement park, and the staff respectfully opened the car door for them.

Paige was so excited when she saw the choice of the Trojan horses that she ran in with her short legs. Candice quickly caught up to her.

Edward, on the other hand, stayed standing outside and watched as Candice sat on a large wooden horse beside Paige, who was on a small wooden horse. Candice’s arm was around Paige.

After sitting down, the carousel started moving. Paige giggled happily, and the innocent smile on her face was infectious. As Edward watched them, his eyes seemed a little red. However, it also seemed like an illusion.

After one round, Candice picked Paige up and left the carousel. Then, she brought Paige to other attractions.

Paige was like a bird that had been released from a cage. She was beyond excited and happy. Candice accompanied Paige to almost all the children’s rides. At the end of all the rides, they went to ride the Ferris wheel.

Paige’s little butt was propped up on the glass, and she was completely unafraid of heights. In fact, she was very excited.

“Mom, I like it here so much. I want to come here every day,” Paige said innocently.

Candice smiled, thinking, ‘Your father will probably be despised by tens of thousands of people every day.’

However, at that moment, Candice mustered up her courage and said, “Edward, I don’t think you’re educating Paige well.”

It was the first time she wanted to discuss with him how overly protective he was of Paige..
