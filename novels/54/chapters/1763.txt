Chapter 1764: Bella Breaks Down

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly pursed her lips as she looked at Mrs. Winter, clearly rejecting her. The people who were originally the closest to each other in the city had fallen out because of the many things that had happened.

At that moment, Mrs. Winter felt the same way when she saw Shelly. She said bluntly, “Shelly, come with me. I have something to tell you.” “Nox is drunk downstairs.”

“I’ll get someone to take care of him. You don’t have to worry.”

Shelly pursed her lips and nodded. Since someone was going to take care of Nox, she would not go.

Shelly followed Mrs. Winter to her room. Coincidentally, the room was opposite hers. Perhaps the host had arranged for people familiar with each other to be together, which was quite thoughtful of them.

“Shelly, I told you that you and Nox would be together for a year and that Nox would leave you if you two had no feelings for each other after a year. Is that right?”

“Yes.” Shelly remembered that.

It was about to be a year soon.

Mrs. Winter said, “In that case, there are two months left. If you don’t have any plans to be with Nox in the next two months, I hope you don’t involve yourself too much with him so that he won’t miss you when you both break up.” Shelly was silent. In fact, she did not know why she was silent.

“Shelly?” Mrs. Winter looked at Shelly’s expression and raised her eyebrows.

“Yes,” Shelly replied.

“What do you mean?” Mrs. Winter’s expression changed slightly. “Do you want to get back together with Nox?”

“No,” Shelly denied.

She had never thought of getting back together with Nox. To her, Nox was not someone she could live with, and he was especially unsuitable for the role of a husband.

“In that case, you have to take what I said seriously.”

“Alright.”

“Oh right, let me tell you something else. Nox is drunk now, so I’ll send someone to take care of him. At this time, you have to maintain a cold attitude and show Nox that you don’t care about him. It’s best if you leave now and show him that you don’t want to participate in any activities with him, let alone stay with him,” Mrs. Winter suggested.

Shelly looked at Mrs. Winter. ‘Must you be so ruthless?”

“If we don’t do this, do you think Nox will let you go?” Mrs. Winter was serious.

Shelly hesitated before she said bluntly, “I think the current Nox is different from the old Nox. The current Nox is more mature and calmer than the past him, so he won’t do such childish things. Aunty, I personally think that when it’s time, he’ll let go as long as I make it clear to him that I won’t be with him.”

“I don’t think so.” Mrs. Winter denied it directly. “Shelly, I don’t have much of an opinion on who Nox is with. Even if it’s with you, I can accept it. Although your reputation isn’t great, I’ve raised you since you were young, and I care for you. The only wish I have now is to have a grandchild. Nox isn’t young, and at his age, he should have a child. He can’t continue to fool around anymore.”

Shelly understood where Mrs. Winter was coming from. To a wealthy family like theirs, it was important to carry on the family line. That idea had been instilled in them for generations, and no one could change it.

Nox was also a wild horse that was out of control. Since it was probably difficult for anyone to tame him, it was normal for Mrs. Winter to be afraid that Nox would not get married and have children.

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

She was not convinced by Mrs. Winter, but she agreed because she did not want to cause too much conflict between her and Mrs. Winter. To be honest, Shelly did not know how to describe their relationship. It did not feel like a kinship, but they were not strangers because they still cared for each other.

In the end, Shelly sighed and thought, ‘So be it. When we meet in the future, a polite greeting would suffice.’

After Shelly left Mrs. Winter’s room and returned to her room, she left with Bella. Since Mrs. Winter told her to leave and be a little ruthless, she would do as Mrs. Winter said.

As she walked toward the elevator, the elevator door opened, and it left her stunned. Why was it that every time the elevator door opened, she would be shocked? First, it was Mrs. Winter, and now it was Nox, who was supported by a woman.

It was obvious that Nox was drunk. He was leaning against the elevator wall with the woman supporting him while the woman held his arm and pressed her chest against his, looking very intimate..
