Chapter 528: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

When the car arrived at the car park, Reese parked the car and got out to help Michael down.

However, Michael pushed her away with such force that she almost fell to the ground.

Monica was shocked.

Reese’s eyes turned red immediately, and she said, “No matter how much you hate me, you can’t take it out on yourself.”

Michael did not even spare Reese a glance as he alighted from the car with great difficulty.

Monica also struggled to get down from the car. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Then, Reese hurriedly handed Monica her crutches.

“Thank you.” Monica looked at Reese, whom she thought had changed too much.

Reese shook her head and said, “Monica, I’m sorry.”

Monica bit her lip.

She knew what Reese was talking about, but she did not plan on forgiving her. Hence, Monica said, “I’ll be leaving first.”

If she went back now, she could discuss with Finn how to resolve Michael’s issue. Finn said if she wanted to help Michael, they would do it together.

She did remember Finn saying that.

However, she admitted that she was impulsive and was regretting it now.

“Monica.” Reese pulled her back. “Don’t go. Let’s discuss what to do next and how to face the world. I was impulsive just now and didn’t consider your situation. Let’s discuss it properly now, alright?”

Seeing that Monica was a little hesitant, Reese begged, “Monica, I’m begging you.”

Monica looked at Reese’s expression and eventually nodded.

With that, the three of them returned to Michael’s apartment together.

It was not a big apartment, and there were not many things in it. However, it looked clean and tidy.

Michael sat on the sofa with a long face, and Monica sat beside Michael.

Reese poured a cup of water for Monica and Michael before she sat down on the sofa beside them. Then, her eyes suddenly turned red. “It was my fault just now. I was just afraid that Michael would get into a fight with the reporters. Besides, Michael is heavily injured, and–”

“Enough!” In a fit of rage, Michael shouted fiercely at Reese, “You schemed against others for your selfish desires, so don’t pretend to be pitiful now. Anyhow, I won’t let Monica take the blame for me! Even if you just claimed Monica and my relationship to be true in front of the reporters, I’ll tell them later that you were lying! I’ll tell them that Monica and Finn have a great relationship and that I’m the third party who’s getting between their relationship!”

“Michael... Why are you doing this? Even if we put up a show, once the situation calms down and you can hold onto your current position, we’ll say that you two broke up peacefully because you lost feelings for each other. When that time comes–”

“Shut up!” Michael was furious at Reese.

He looked mad.

However, Reese just cried silently by the side. Under Michael’s vicious aura, she did not dare to say a single word.

Michael ignored Reese and turned to Monica. He said, “Monica, I’ll definitely settle this matter for you.”

Monica looked at Michael.

“Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.” Although his face was covered in wounds, he was still consoling her with a smile.

Monica felt that Michael was too kind, so much that she would sympathize with him.

She said, “Michael, can you pull through? With your current situation, can you–”

“Don’t worry. I can handle it.”

Monica stared at him.

Michael said, “It’s getting late. You should go back first. You left Finn behind just now, so he must be very jealous. Hurry back and explain to him. If you can’t, I’ll give him a call.”

“No need. I’ll explain to him, and he’ll understand. You don’t have to worry about me.” Monica felt beyond guilty.

“Okay.” Michael nodded and then asked, “Can you make your way back yourself? Or do you want me to get someone to send you back?”

“No, I can head back by myself. Michael, you have to take care of your body. It’s more important than anything else.” Monica did not forget to remind him.

“Don’t worry. I know how to take care of myself.” Michael kept smiling at her.

Monica looked at him, telling herself that she could not give up on Finn and that she could not help Michael.

Hence, she stood up and left.

After Monica left, Michael gave Reese a look.
