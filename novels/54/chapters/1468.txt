Chapter 1469: Shelly, Whose Child Is It?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Alright.” Shelly agreed.

If he thought it was fine, that would be great.

Nox gave Shelly 200 thousand dollars, which to Shelly, who was still studying at the time, was a huge sum of money. Therefore, he believed it was enough for Shelly to go to university.

In his mind, Shelly would definitely take the college entrance examination again and go to university. However, he did not expect Shelly to take his money and go for plastic surgery.

Did she think she could charm anyone because she had plastic surgery? He, Nox, hated people who went under the knife the most in his life because no matter what, it would affect the next generation.

After that showdown with Shelly, she did not appear in front of him again. There was a short period of time when he felt a little guilty, wondering if he had misunderstood Shelly back then. Perhaps her car accident was an accident, and he had thought too badly of Shelly.

However, because Shelly did not appear in his life again, even if he did feel a little guilty, he gradually forgot about it as time passed.

That was until now, when he finally bumped Shelly again. After disappearing for a few years, she was now trying to seduce him again, and her skills this time were higher than the last.

That woman, Shelly, was getting increasingly disgusting.

He pulled himself back to reality and looked at Shelly coldly.

Shelly could tell what he was thinking from his eyes. Anyway, in Nox’s heart, she was a bad person.

In fact, she did not know why Nox looked down on her so much. Thinking about it carefully, it was probably because she insisted on marrying Nox even after pursuing Nox for a period of time and Nox had made it very clear that he would not be with her.

Could she say that she regretted it too?

Back then, she wanted to marry into the Winter family. Although she knew that Nox did not like her and even hated her, she did not care and thought that marrying into the Winter family would give her glory and wealth. Now, she really regretted it.

“Yes, I was the one who drugged you because I wanted to seduce you. I was still eyeing the position of the Winters’ eldest young mistress,” Shelly suddenly admitted.

In any case, even if she did not admit it, Nox would have thought the same. It was better to do as he wished and send him away as soon as possible. It would save her the trouble of dealing with him.

Nox’s expression changed when he heard Shelly’s sudden admission. She had denied it at first, but now she suddenly admitted it.

That woman… Was she compromising because she think she could not fool him?

He found it odd but did not want to think too much about it.

“So, what does Young Master Winter intend to do to me?” Shelly asked him. Nox even felt provoked at that moment and secretly cursed in his heart. ‘F*ck.’

She had done such a terrible thing, yet she could still act so righteously. Did she have no sense of shame?

“Shelly, where did you get the confidence to say such things?” Nox was furious.

He could feel a ball of raging fire in his stomach but could not find a suitable time to vent it. Where did Shelly learn those despicable tricks over the years?

“Didn’t you want me to say this, Young Master Winter? Didn’t you want me to admit I’m dirty and disgusting? Didn’t you want me to make you think that not marrying me was the best choice you made?” Shelly sneered.

Nox could explode at any moment. “I don’t need you to admit anything. You’re not worthy of being my wife. Everyone knows that!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Since that’s the case, what do you want from me? Why did you come looking for me? You could’ve ignored me. After all, the best way to stop me from marrying you is to treat me coldly. As long as you ignore me, even if I want to marry you again, I can only watch helplessly and achieve nothing!”

“If I didn’t come, do you think my grandfather would let me off if you got pregnant?” Nox sneered. “Shelly, do you think I’m stupid?”

“Didn’t I take the medicine in front of you?”

Nox was rendered speechless by Shelly’s words.

“Young Master Winter, do you still think that’s not enough?”

“Since there’s a first time, it’ll happen many more times. If I don’t make it clear to you this time, you’ll treat me like this again, and I don’t have that much time to waste with you. When I think about having sex with you, I feel all kinds of disgusted, ” Nox said fiercely..
