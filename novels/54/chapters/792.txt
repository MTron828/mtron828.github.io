Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

His face was cold as if he had expected such an outcome.

She said, “So, you’ve thought about my feelings and how much you’ll hurt me by doing so. You’ve thought about what it’ll do to me, yet you still did it! I’ve dropped everything and done so much for you, yet you’ve hurt me like this! You…”

Monica’s voice was getting louder and louder.

Her emotions, which she could not control anymore, erupted at that moment.

She had never been so devastated before. She did not even know how to vent her anger or calm herself down.

She even had the urge to kill Michael.

How could he lie to her like she was a fool? What right did he have to make her divorce Finn?

“But Monica, I love you…”

“Slap!” Monica slapped Michael’s face hard.

It took all her strength to slap him

However, Michael did not dodge, nor did he show any expression on his face. He just endured it.

Monica said, “You have no right to say you love me, just like…”

It was just like her, who no longer had the right to tell Finn she loved him because she was so stupid.

She was so stupid that she was not worthy of Finn’s love.

Her tears fell like crazy.

That was probably the most devastating thing she had ever encountered in her life.

However, what she did not know was that there would be more shocking events that would shatter her understanding of the world in the future.

“B*tch!” Reese cursed.

How could she bear to see her son being slapped by Monica?

From her point of view, Monica was not worthy of Michael. Who was Monica to shout at Michael, let alone slap him?

She pushed Monica’s body away fiercely.

Monica lost her balance and fell to the ground.

Reese looked down at Monica and roared at her, “Monica, know your place and stop acting so arrogant in front of Michael. He treats you with dignity because he’s kind. Otherwise, you’re just a useful tool for the Rosses. If you perform well, the position of the Rosses’ young mistress will still be yours. But if you don’t…”

Reese’s expression was extremely vicious as she threatened, “If you don’t, you’ll suffer the consequences!”

Monica sneered.

What young mistress? What suffer? She did not care at all!

Moreover, she was not someone who would be bullied easily.

She had never been afraid of anyone. Even if the leader of Harken was standing in front of her and had provoked her, she would fight him to the death.

Hence, at that moment, she abruptly got up from the ground and grabbed Reese’s exquisitely tied hair without a second thought. She used all her strength to pull on Reese’s hair. It was like she was going to tear Reese’s scalp off.

Reese was used to being on top, and the Rosses had always been above everyone else. Who would dare to offend the Rosses? Once she offended them, she was bound to suffer all kinds of revenge. Reese was just treating Monica like how she treated others. However, no one had ever dared to resist her like that, so she never thought that Monica would actually hit her.

Her scalp was about to explode from Monica’s grip. Hence, she could not care less about her image and shouted, ” Monica! Monica, you sl*t. Let go of me!

“Let go? If I don’t beat you to death, I won’t let you go, you old b*tch!” With that, Monica even dragged Reese by her scalp and took two steps outside, just so that Reese’s head would hit the wall directly.

Reese was stunned as she had never been treated like that or felt so insulted before.

She swore was going to kill Monica, that b*tch.

However, she endured the pain in her head and called out to Michael loudly, ” Michael, why aren’t you coming to help me? Ah… You b*tch!”

Michael, on the other hand, held back and watched as the two women fight crazily.

In fact, Monica was not uninjured, and Reese was extremely cruel when she went crazy.

Reese’s long nails kept scratching Monica’s body, tearing Monica’s clothes to pieces.
