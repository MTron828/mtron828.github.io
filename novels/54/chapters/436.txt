Chapter 437: The Swan Enterprise’s Senior Management Meeting, Confronting Eden Swan

She was thinking about how she could get a single strand of Old Master Swan’s hair. Would she have an opportunity for Old Master Swan’s birthday banquet tomorrow?

Kingsley sure knew how to give her a difficult task by making her pluck the hair of the tiger!

Jeanne lay on the bed and thought about it for a long time. However, the more she thought about it, the more she found it hard to fall asleep.

She did not know how much time had passed when Edward pushed open the door.

Seeing that Jeanne was still sitting by the bedside with the light on, he was in a good mood. “Are you waiting for me?”

He should not be too confident.

“Wait another two minutes for me,” Edward said.

Why did she have to wait for him for another two minutes?

“I’m going to take a shower.” Edward smiled.

Jeanne instantly understood. How could that fellow have so much energy in a day?

He sure had a lot of energy.

After taking a shower, a certain someone directly pressed her under his body.

Jeanne was really on the verge of breaking down. At that moment, she could barely breathe. She said, “Do you want it every night?”

......

“Yes.” A certain someone nodded.

“Do we have to do it so many times every night?”

“To help you sleep.”

What a liar!

After a night of torment... Who the hell said he was cold and restrained?

She wished she could beat that person to death!

…

The next day, Jeanne opened her eyes.

She had to admit that ever since Edward came along, she had been woken up by the alarm clock every day. She did not have to worry about waking up early in the morning herself as she could not fall asleep after.

Insomnia and the like did not exist anymore.

She woke up with a sore back.

“Jeannie.” Beside her, a charming male voice called out to her.

Jeanne really did not want to hear that word, or her imagination would run wild. Hence, she lifted the blanket and left.

She felt that it was dangerous to stay in bed for even a second longer.

Edward looked at the view of Jeanne’s back, and the corner of her mouth curled up into a very nice smile.

Then, he slowly got up and followed her into the bathroom.

Jeanne, who was sitting on the toilet, stared at Edward with her eyes wide open.

“I have the key.” Edward waved her hand.

What was the point of her locking herself in?

“Continue. I’ll wait for you.”

“...”

After the two of them washed up, Jeanne got changed and put on makeup. At the same time, Edward also got changed and waited for her.

Then, they went downstairs together to have breakfast.

At that moment, George was already at the dining table. He was probably not fully awake and was a little listless.

Jeanne patted George’s head. “I’ll find some time to cut your hair.”

George looked up at Jeanne and nodded.

While they were eating breakfast, Edward asked, “Do you want to follow me to Swan Enterprise, or would you come over from Lawrence Enterprise later?”

“I’ll follow you to Swan Enterprise.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded.

The moment she nodded, he smiled.

Jeanne looked at Edward, not understanding why she was happy. They were just talking.

“Don’t forget to wash the dishes,” George suddenly said.

He was unhappy that his mother’s attention was all on Fourth Master Swan, which made him feel that he was about to fall out of favor.

“Okay.” Edward nodded.

Hence, after breakfast, Edward started to wash the dishes again.

Since school started a little earlier, George left the villa first.

After he left, Edward put down the dishes. “Teddy.”

Did he not agree that he would wash them?

With that, Teddy went over to take over.

Edward washed the foam off his hands slowly and then walked toward Jeanne, who was waiting for him on the sofa in the living room while playing with her phone.

Jeanne looked up at Edward and then at Teddy, who was washing the dishes.

“Fourth Master, it’s not kind of you to lie to a child like this.”

“I didn’t want you to wait for me for too long.”

“It’s alright. I’m very free.”

“Oh, I’m not.”

The next second, he pounced on her.

Teddy did not even dare to raise his head. When did his master become so flirtatious?

‘Always!’ Jeanne roared in her heart.

At that moment, she was sitting in Edward’s luxurious car and reapplying her lipstick.

Edward looked at her, his gaze on her face the entire time.

Jeanne pretended not to see it. She was afraid that if she gave a casual glance, the lipstick she reapplied would be gone again.

Eventually, the car arrived at the Swan Enterprise’s headquarters.

It was actually Jeanne’s first time here, and she was shocked by the architecture. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Lawrences could actually maintain a decent facade, but in the face of the Swans, they were nothing in comparison.

She remained calm.

After the chauffeur opened the car door for Edward, Edward got out of the car and then bent down to lead Jeanne out of the car.

At the entrance, the receptionist was already waiting for them.

When she saw Edward and Jeanne get out of the car, she quickly greeted Edward respectfully, “President.”
