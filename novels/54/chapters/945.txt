946 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s press conference went viral in South Hampton City.

Monica had publicly accused the quality inspection department of not being effective in giving them the quality inspection result and was even suspected of favoritism and abuse of the law. That caused an uproar in the industry.

Of course, what aroused the public’s indignation more was the dispute between Monica and the victim’s family, which was made into emojis and spread on the Internet.

Apart from Monica, no other non-artiste in Harken had been made into emojis so frequently. Most importantly, it was extremely popular.

The last time was the sexy dance last time, and this time was the bad behavior.

In short, in many people’s minds, Monica was not someone with common sense. She was even a little… deranged.

That news incident had, once again, caused Monica’s public image to plummet.

The Internet was filled with curses, scolding Monica for not having a moral bottom line and that she was inhumane. Those vicious words could drive people crazy. However, not only did Monica not go crazy, but she even started quarreling with the netizens.

When the netizens scolded her, she retorted, “Before the results are out, what right do you have to scold me? I’m just defending my rights!

“I can sue you for defamation if you slander me without knowing that Cardellini Enterprise is the one at fault!”

“If Cardellini Enterprise isn’t at fault, should I also ask the family to compensate me for my financial and mental losses?”

…

Monica’s every reply was trending, and it even got tens of millions of replies, which instantly surpassed all the A-list celebrities.

The fight lasted for more than two hours.

Someone organized a public vote and asked the quality inspection department to come up with a result as soon as possible.

They just wanted to see Cardellini Enterprise and Monica get slapped in the face. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

That was Monica’s goal.

Let the so-called “justice” blow up the news and pressure the quality inspection department so that they have no choice but to produce the results as quickly as possible.

Finally, at 9 p.m. that night, under pressure from the public, the quality inspection department made an official statement. There was a lot of information. First, it explained why they had used the method to conduct the test. Then, they explained why they were fair and just and that it was absolutely impossible to target anyone or any company. Finally, they were willing to accept the public’s suggestion to re-plan their testing method for Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine and would try to produce a quality inspection report within a week!

Only when they received a reply from the quality inspection department did the conflict on the internet subside a little.

Everyone waited patiently for a result.

If the results were not good, Monica did not dare to imagine what kind of existence she would become in Harken.

She sat in her office. After returning from the press conference, she had been there for the entire afternoon and half a night, constantly scolding the netizens. Now that she saw the official statement in the quality inspection department, she could finally put an end to it.

Monica put down her phone before she stretched her body, twisting it around.

Just as she was considering whether she should go to the hospital to see her father after work, the phone suddenly rang, and she glanced at the caller ID.

It was Finn.

She told herself to have any emotional reaction. However, she could not control herself.

She took a deep breath and answered the call. “Fin–”

“If you have time, I’d like to talk to you about your father’s heart transplant.”

She pursed her lips.

She should not have any expectations of him to take the initiative to care about her.

Although she had indeed been scolded badly by the netizens today, if not for her good mindset, she would have committed suicide hundreds of times.

Before Finn could get Monica’s answer, he said again, “Or should I talk to your mother directly?”

“I’ll be right there.” Monica said, “Give me about 20 minutes.”

“Alright,” he said before hanging up the phone.

Monica also hung up the phone.

She took a deep breath and slowly calmed herself down.

When she left, she rang Steve on the phone and told him to go back and rest early. There was no way he could work overtime every day. Steve was in his forties, and if he kept going like that for a few more years, he might end up like her father.

Monica got into her small car and drove to the hospital.

She had not driven a car since the last time she broke her leg. Perhaps it was because she was traumatized.

After all, the scene of her and Finn almost getting killed by a car was still fresh in his memory.

Hence, she drove slowly.
