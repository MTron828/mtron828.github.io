1345 Parting On Good Terms and Breaking Up In The End

Seeing Finn turning around and leaving, Monica sneered.

As far as Finn was concerned, he just needed to fight for her for a little bit. However, since he could not get her, it was no longer his responsibility.

That was good too. Since things were calm regardless of whether they were together or not, it would not be too awkward when they met in the future.

Monica packed up three big suitcases of things. After making sure that she did not miss anything, she dragged the three big suitcases out of the room.

The moment she left, she could not help but sigh. It turned out that leaving someone was not as difficult as she thought it would be.

When she walked out of the living room, Finn was sitting on the sofa, seemingly waiting for her.

Seeing her dragging the suitcase, he quickly went forward.

“Let me help you,” Finn said.

Monica smiled, thinking, ‘Finn, that *sshole, is quite proactive.’

However, she did not refuse. From now on, they were friends, and it was okay for friends to help each other. If Finn wanted to help her in the future, she would not refuse.

“Thank you.” Monica nodded.

Finn dragged her three large suitcases out of the door. By then, Monica had contacted her driver, who was waiting for her in the garage.

When the driver saw them, he quickly took the luggage from Finn.

“It’s okay. I’ll do it.” Finn refused.

The driver was a little embarrassed, but Monica was not. Anyway, Finn was insistent on sending her off personally.

It seemed like only when it was time to break up did she know the man’s character.

Finn was not all great, but he was not bad either.

She watched as Finn put all her things into the trunk.

Monica said politely, “Thank you.”

Then, she got into the backseat of the car.

She did not expect her breakup with Finn to be so ‘pleasant’. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The first time they broke up, she thought that Finn had cheated on her, and Finn thought that she had cheated on him. Although they did not fight at that time, it was obvious that they had left a very bad impression on each other. As a result, when they were forced to get married the second time, their relationship was bad. Then, when they got divorced the second time, it was a very painful divorce.

Only this time, the two of them did not seem to react to the breakup.

Now that she thought about it, she probably did not love him anymore.

In fact, the breakup the first time and the second time was so hard because they loved each other too much. It was only when they stopped loving each other that they no longer felt the pain.

As Monica thought about it, she realized that the relationship between them was a little funny. They had already broken up three times. How did they let each other do that?

Monica closed the car door, not wanting to pretend to say goodbye to Finn.

In the future, they would just let nature take its course when they met. There was no need to be too conscious about it.

With that, she told the chauffeur to drive away.

The moment the driver started the car, Finn knocked on Monica’s car glass door.

Monica rolled down the car window. “What’s wrong?”

She used a very normal tone. It was the tone and demeanor she would use with ordinary friends.

“Take care of yourself,” Finn said.

Monica actually expected Finn to say that, so it was no surprise.

She nodded. “Alright, you too.”

After that, Monica rolled up the car window and thought to herself, ‘I cannot meet a sc*mbag like that again in the future.”

Then, she instructed the chauffeur to drive away. She did not turn around to look at Finn, who had been standing in the garage the entire time until his phone suddenly rang.

Finn looked down and picked up the call. “Nox.”

“How did it go with Monica?” Nox asked excitedly.

Last night, in the middle of the night, a certain someone called him and told him about his relationship crisis. Hence, he pointed out two things Finn could do.

One of it was that he had to have a good talk with Monica. He had to tell her all the conflicts between them and everything that Monica cared about. Once everything was resolved, they could bury the hatchet.

However, with Finn’s personality, if he could explain things to Monica, he would not be Finn.

Nox was 80 percent sure that as long as Monica refused to have a deep conversation with Finn, Finn would give up after a few tries. Therefore, that perfect solution was useless.

Then the second thing Finn could do was go along with Monica.
