Chapter 571: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

“Have a safe journey.”

Edward’s expression changed.

Jeanne immediately changed what she said. “Oh, it’s not a safe journey on a plane but have a safe flight.”

Edward smiled and said, “Remember to think of me.”

After that, he hung up the phone.

Sat beside Edward, Nox was disgusted by the man beside him and had goosebumps all over the floor.

How did that man change so much after marriage?

He had never seen Edward smile like that before in his entire life, nor had Edward smiled as many times in the past twenty-nine years combined than over the past three months of marriage.

Nox lowered his head and continued to deal with his own matters.

He looked at the pile of photos of women that had been sent to him on Facebook. Each one of them looked sexy and had amazing figures.

He wanted to give Finn a perfect first time.

Hence, he went through the list of women for a long time before choosing a girl who looked relatively pure.

More importantly, it would be the girl’s first time. If not, Finn would suffer a great loss.

Nox spent a lot of money on it, costing him 200 thousand dollars. He even had to think twice before transferring the money to the girl.

“Why aren’t you getting out of the car?” Edward reminded him.

Nox quickly came back to his senses. He took a look at the airport and opened the car door while replying to the message, sending Finn’s home address.

Tonight, he wanted Finn to forget about Monica once and for all!

After all, he put down his phone and followed Edward directly to the boarding gate.

Nox asked, “Did something happen suddenly? Why are you in such a hurry to leave?”

“The Sanders have been doing a lot recently and have found a lot of clues. Just in case, we have to conceal ourselves again.”

Nox’s expression sank.

He felt that some things were getting closer and closer to him.

Edward also noticed Nox’s change in mood. He said, “I would like it to end as soon as possible.”

Nox looked at him.

“After so many years, aren’t you tired?” Edward asked.

“Are you tired?”

“I am.” Edward came straight out with it. “I want to settle down.”

“For Jeanne?” Nox was sure of that.

“Maybe.” Edward did not deny it.

“But have you ever thought about who Jeanne is?”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly, but he did not answer. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Kingsley might be related to the Sanders,” Nox said. In fact, he had never given up on investigating Kingsley.

Edward listened in silence.

Nox said, “Back when the Sanders seized power, an underground organization was secretly supporting them. In fact, when the civil war started, victory was already in their grasp. It was later that the powerful organization suddenly appeared, causing the Duncans to fall into disarray and lose miserably. This organization was also rather mysterious, or perhaps the Sanders intentionally concealed it. After the civil war, the moment the Sanders took the position of leading the country, that organization suddenly disappeared into thin air. Right now, I still have no evidence to prove that Kingsley is related to this mysterious organization, but what I know is that Kingsley was leading the mafia in the Delta Islands. I have found the records of him entering and leaving the mafia headquarters.”

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

“To be able to enter and leave as he pleases, his position should not be low. The reason why I suspect Kingsley is related to the Sanders is that this mafia is also very mysterious. I have sent many powerful spies to infiltrate the inner circle, but they have failed every time. Not long ago, a spy got close to those in the mafia headquarters, but in the end, he was only in the outer circle and could not reach the heart of the organization. We have come into contact with so many organizations in the country and abroad over the past few years. Regardless of whether it is the government or the underground organizations, we’ve been able to deal with all of them. As for the Delta Islands, we couldn’t.”

“Get to the point.” Edward’s expression was cold.

Nox glanced at him, “An organization that is so guarded against the outside world must be hiding a huge secret. Once this secret is exposed, it’s very likely to cause a certain degree of unrest. The lowest standard definition of unrest for me is that it will affect the political system of a country. Therefore, I suspect that the mafia in the Delta Islands has a close relationship with the Sanders.”

Edward nodded, seemingly agreeing with Nox’s point of view.

“If they’re related...” Nox looked at Edward. “You and Jeanne will be on opposing sides.”

“No,” Edward said.

Nox was speechless at Edward’s reply. To what extent did one have to love a woman to be able to trust her so unconditionally?

“We won’t,” Edward added.

By saying that, he meant that someone would always compromise in the end.
