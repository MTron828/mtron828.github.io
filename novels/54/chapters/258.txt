Chapter 259: A Close Call

At night.

It was very late at night.

Monica watched Finn leave.

She watched him leave after snatching her phone.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She gritted her teeth and suddenly got out of the car from the front passenger seat. She ran straight to Finn.

Micheal’s eyes narrowed. Before he could speak, he saw Monica quickly run to Finn’s side.

“Finn,” Monica called out to him.

Finn turned to look at her.

“I’ll go with you,” Monica said.

She knew that he would follow Fourth Master Swan to save Jeanne. She wanted to go with him.

Finn refused immediately, “No!”

“Let me go with you. I want to save Jeanne—”

“If you come with us, you’ll only be a burden to us,” Finn told her coldly.

Monica was stunned.

She just looked at Finn like that.

It seemed that he always looked down on her.

From what she had experienced tonight, she knew she was indeed very weak, but...

Monica told Finn with certainty, “I won’t be a burden to you. I’ll be careful.”

She just wanted to save Jeanne as soon as possible.

She was just worried about Jeanne’s safety.

“Fourth Master Swan will save Jeanne.”

Finn said coldly. When he saw Fourth Master Swan’s car, he quickly ran over.

He left Monica behind and got into Edward’s car.

Then, the car drove away.

Monica’s eyes were red.

She stood there and looked at the car in front of her leave at the speed of light.

Finn had always not known what she needed.

Even though Monica knew very well that she might not be of much help and might even become a burden to them if she followed them, Finn just didn’t know how badly she wanted to see Jeanne and know if she was okay.

At this moment, in the car behind Monica.

Eden, who was sitting in the back seat, felt as if he was sitting on pins and needles. Under such an intense situation, he was also somewhat apprehensive.

He was hesitating whether he should inform Melody or not.

Eden did not know what Melody was doing to Jeanne at the moment.

It had been such a long time.

It had only been half an hour since Melody had called him.

Eden did not know if Melody had tortured Jeanne enough during this period!

If not…

Eden’s body went cold.

He felt that his fourth uncle could really save Jeanne.

No.

They had come this far tonight.

Eden could not let Melody fail.

If she failed again, just as Micheal had said, there would be no chance anymore.

He took out his phone and was about to make a call.

“Eden,” Micheal suddenly called out to him.

Eden was shocked.

He looked at Micheal.

“I advise you not to leave any evidence,” Micheal said. While Monica was not in the car, he seemed to have noticed Eden’s actions and reminded him, “If you inform Melody now, once your fourth uncle finds out, do you think that you’ll be fine?!”

Eden’s heart skipped a beat.

“Tonight, we had better be a bystander,” Micheal said coldly, “Otherwise, we’ll be setting ourselves on fire!”

Eden trusted Micheal very much.

He always felt that Micheal’s thoughts were deeper than his and that Micheal always thought things through.

“Besides, at this stage tonight, if Melody still hasn’t killed Jeanne, it’s because she doesn’t have the ability to do so! Even at this stage, she still failed. Do you think there’s still a need for us to be loyal to her?” Micheal asked Eden.

Eden pursed his lips.

“There’s plenty of time in the future. We’ll have better developments in the future,” Micheal affirmed. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Eden nodded. “Compared to Melody, of course, I trust you more.”

After Micheal received Eden’s affirmative answer, he quickly stepped on the accelerator and stopped the car next to Monica.

At this moment, Eden also put down his phone and sat in the back. It was as if the two of them had not communicated at all.

“Monica, get in the car!” Micheal called out to Monica anxiously and quickly.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She turned around and sat in the passenger’s seat.

Micheal drove very fast and quickly caught up to Fourth Master Swan.

Fortunately, it was nighttime and there were few cars at night. Otherwise, with Fourth Master Swan’s speed and his driving skills, Micheal would not be able to catch up!

Monica watched nervously as Micheal struggled to keep up.

Micheal held the steering wheel tightly, and his speed became a little faster.

He had reached the limit of his life.

At this time, he did not forget to comfort Monica, “Don’t worry, I’ll try my best to keep up with Fourth Master Swan. Just sit tight.”
