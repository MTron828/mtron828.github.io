Chapter 576: Don’t Show Up in Front of Me, I Think You’re Disgusting

Alexander’s face turned green with anger when he thought of Jeanne’s actions.

“From father’s attitude today, I finally see that he has accepted Jeanne. I already thought it was irrational of him to give Jeanne the shares, and he even gave her a portion of your shares. At that time, I didn’t think about it too much, but now that I do, is father intentionally giving your shares to Jeanne so that you won’t have any right to speak in the Lawrence Enterprise in the future? Oh, the heavens!” Jenifer suddenly exclaimed dramatically, “If that’s the case, could we have been schemed against by father and Jeanne all this while?”

When Alexander heard Jenifer’s analysis, he was stunned for a moment.

His shares were given to Jeanne for no apparent reason. Although he did not think much of it at that time, now that he did, he believed he had been schemed against by Jonathan!

At that, his expression darkened.

He did not expect that his father, whom he trusted and always obeyed his orders, would fool him like that.

He kicked the floor lamp in the bedroom.

Jenifer was shocked.

She looked at Alexander and gathered her courage to ask, “What should we do now? Should we allow father and Jeanne to plot against us like that? I’m fine with it. To be able to marry you was all I ever wanted, and I don’t have any big ambitions either. I just don’t think you deserve to be treated like that. All these years, you’ve worked so hard to manage the company, yet now, father wants to give everything to Jeanne–”

“Enough!” Alexander was furious.

Jenifer’s eyes were red. “I just can’t stand seeing you–”

“I won’t allow Lawrence Enterprise to fall into Jeanne’s hands.” Alexander’s face was flushed red as he gritted his teeth.

“But father is obviously on Jeanne’s side. If he wants to give it to Jeanne, what can we do?”

“Well, that’ll depend on whether he can give it to her or not!” Alexander laughed coldly.

Jenifer looked at Alexander in confusion.

“One way to make a person lose his ability to control others is to make him shut up forever.” Alexander’s eyes narrowed. “At my father’s age, he has lived long enough.”

Jenifer looked shocked, but in her heart, she was extremely cruel.

Jonathan was seeking his death by treating them like that!

…

Jeanne left the Lawrence family’s manor and stepped into Mile’s car.

Then, she leaned against the back seat while thinking about something.

After tonight’s incident, the Lawrences would definitely have internal strife.

After all, Jonathan now sincerely wanted to use her, so he would also ask Alexander to treat her a little better. Jonathan just wanted her to work for the Lawrence Enterprise for free, but Alexander thought Jonathan wanted to give the company to her.

In that case, there would always be someone who could not hold back.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a cruel smile.

All the internal strife now was based on her identity as a Lawrence. If she was not a Lawrence…

Even Alexander did not know that she was not a Lawrence.

Her eyes moved before she picked up the phone and dialed Kingsley’s number.

The call went through. “What made you think of me?”

“I have something to trouble you with.” Jeanne went straight to the point.

Kingsley was also used to Jeanne’s attitude, so he asked, “What is it?”

“I have stirred up a conflict between Jonathan and Alexander. I suspect Alexander will make a move against Jonathan!” Jeanne said, “Get someone to monitor Alexander’s every move. I don’t know what method he’ll use to make it seem like Jonathan died in an accident.”

“Has Jonathan been paralyzed for many years?” Kingsley asked.

“Yes.”

“Does he go out often?”

“He hasn’t left the house over the last few years. If he feels unwell, the doctor will come and check on him.”

“Does he have any hobbies?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“He likes to drink tea. Occasionally, he will go downstairs and take a walk in the backyard.”

“Okay.” After hearing what Jeanne said, Kingsley came to a conclusion. “Jonathan will die in two ways. One, he’ll be drugged dead by Alexander drugging Jonathan’s tea. Then, Alexander will announce his accidental death to the public. After all, Jonathan is so old. His death would not surprise many people.”

“Yes.”

“The second is death by accident. Since Jonathan has been paralyzed all these years and cannot move, he can accidentally fall from the stairs and die. That’s also considered an accident,” Kingsley analyzed.

“If he’s drugged, Alexander will send people to buy drugs. As long as you send people to keep an eye on Alexander’s men, you will definitely be able to find evidence. When that time comes, if Jonathan was to be poisoned to death, I will get the forensic doctor to perform an autopsy and then take out evidence to testify against Alexander.”
