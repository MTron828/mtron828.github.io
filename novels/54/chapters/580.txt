Chapter 581: Monica and Finn’s Relationship Ended A Long Time Ago!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The woman certainly did not dare to offend Finn.

She was afraid she would not get the money because she did not sleep with him.

Finn knew what she was worried about too. “You were sent here by my friend, and he paid you. If you’re worried he’ll take it back, the consensus is that we slept together.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The woman stared at him with her eyes wide open.

She had been unlucky since she was young, so she never thought there would be a day when she would get a free meal.

“By the way...” Finn’s eyes narrowed.

The woman listened to his arrangements carefully.

An hour later, Finn opened the door again, only to see that Monica had not left.

She thought Finn and that woman were just trying to annoy her.

She was such a stupid person, someone who did not like to think, yet she kept finding excuses for Finn. She even wondered if the woman was sent here by Nox, who could do anything…

She believed Finn would not touch that woman.

Regardless of their current relationship, based on her understanding of Finn, he would not sleep with any woman.

For so many years, other than Patsy, Finn did not have any other woman by her side. Moreover, Finn never did anything with Patsy!

Finn would never be so casual with those things…

She kept trying to convince herself, making excuses for the woman who appeared in Finn’s room.

It felt like time was passing so slowly.

Several times, she wanted to hit Finn’s door like she had gone mad, but she forced herself to give up again and again.

Finn’s indifference to her just now really hurt her, and she did not dare to face him again.

Hence, she just sat at the door and looked at the tightly shut door with tears in her eyes.

She kept thinking maybe the door would open in the next second, but it did not.

She waited for an hour before the door finally opened. By now, everything that should have happened would have happened long ago.

Looking at Finn and the sweet-faced woman beside Finn, she sneered.

Perhaps she really thought Finn was too noble. What right did she have to think she knew him? In fact, she did not know him at all.

Therefore, she was unsure if Finn would have casual sex with a woman.

At that moment, she saw the woman kiss Finn on the cheek, and Finn did not refuse.

The woman smiled and said, “I’ve given you my contact information. Next time, call me, and I’ll pay you a visit.”

Finn was not as proactive as the woman. He just nodded and then said to the woman, “Be careful on your way.”

With a smile, the woman left his house.

After the woman left, Finn closed the door without even glancing at Monica.

Monica gritted her teeth and got up from the ground.

She did not know how long she had sat there, but the moment she got up, she felt dizzy.

Even then, she did not allow herself to stabilize herself before she quickly caught up with the woman who had left.

The moment the woman walked into the elevator, she rushed in.

The woman looked at Monica in shock.

“Did you sleep with him?” Monica asked straightforwardly.

The woman stared at her.

“I asked you if you slept with Finn!” Monica roared angrily.

It was as if she was venting all her emotions.

The woman looked at her ferocious appearance and nodded. “Yes.”

“How many times?”

“Huh?”

“How many times did Finn sleep with you?” Monica questioned loudly.

The woman was so frightened by the person in front of her that she could not even speak properly. “T-Two times.”

“Heh.” Monica sneered.

The woman looked at her and did not dare to say another word.

Fortunately, the elevator reached the first floor fast, and the woman rushed out.

The man told her to do a small favor, which was to make her admit to the woman outside that they really slept together.

She was actually not too old and had never experienced any heartbreaking love. However, she had experienced first love in her student days, so she could not understand why they clearly liked each other but chose to torture each other.

Those two clearly liked each other.

…

Monica did not know how she left Finn’s neighborhood as her mind was filled with the thought of Finn sleeping with a strange woman twice.

They had been together for so many years, yet nothing happened between them.
