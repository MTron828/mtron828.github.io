Chapter 274: Jeanne’s Identity as a Sander Is Exposed?!

In the end.

Edward did not force Jeanne to have sex with him.

Even so, he did not let Jeanne leave either.

After the two of them had lunch, they returned to bed.

They did not sleep anymore. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was because they had slept enough.

They did not know what to do, so they could only sleep and pretend to sleep.

In the quiet room, Jeanne’s phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up.

“Monica.”

“Jeannie, are you awake?” Monica asked very agitatedly.

“Yes,” Jeanne answered.

“How are you feeling?”

“I’m okay. I’ll be fine after a few days of rest.”

“You were seriously injured. How can you only rest for a few days? You should rest for a few months!”

Jeanne smiled.

She did not have so much time.

She wanted to leave South Hampton City as soon as possible.

She did not want to be entangled with Fourth Master Swan.

“How about you? How are you?” Jeanne changed the topic.

She knew that Monica had also suffered some injuries last night.

“I’m in the hospital!” Monica had a smug look on his face. “I’m pretty good now as I’m being taken care of by a designated nurse.”

“You’re in the hospital?” Jeanne frowned. “Are you seriously injured?”

“No, I only scraped my knees. I was too lazy to go back and forth, so I chose to stay in the hospital. They’re minor injuries,” Monica explained quickly.

“Where’s Dr. Jones?” Jeanne asked naturally.

“Who knows where that b*stard went. Ever since I was admitted to the hospital, Finn has never appeared again. Let me tell you, Finn was the one who suggested that I get admitted to the hospital. He was just looking forward to dumping?me here so that he wouldn’t have to care about me anymore,” Monica said indignantly.

“I always feel that you have some misunderstanding about Dr. Jones.”

“There’s no misunderstanding. Finn is such a sinister person.” Monica was very certain.

Jeanne still wanted to say something but Monica spoke again, “Are you still at Fourth Master’s place?”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

The person next to her was still sleeping.

She did not know if he was really asleep or if he was pretending to sleep as she did.

“I think he treats you really well. You don’t even know how flustered he was the moment I told him about your accident. I’ve never seen him like that. It’s like... f*ck, my level of education isn’t high. I can’t find an adjective to describe it. Anyway, I’m just very concerned about you,” Monica said very excitedly, “Don’t push Fourth Master away. Stay with him well. In the future, no one will dare to bully you. You can do whatever you want in South Hampton City, no, in Harken!”

Jeanne smiled.

Monica really wanted her to marry Fourth Master Swan. She wanted her to be able to show off in the city.

Jeanne said, “Monica, I know how to deal with my matters.”

“I just don’t understand. What’s wrong with Fourth Master? If he likes me, I’ll marry him right away!”

“...”

‘You can’t even make things clear with Micheal and Finn, and yet you want Fourth Master now too?!

‘Do you really think that your relationships aren’t complicated enough?’

“Jeannie, just like Fourth Master Swan. Eden is far inferior to him. If you can fall in love with Eden, can’t you fall in love with Fourth Master Swan?! Fourth Master Swan is truly the prince charming of the whole nation!” Monica advised earnestly. She really wished that she could help Jeanne get married!

“I got it,” Jeanne responded.

Fourth Master Swan was by her side, so there were many things that she could not say to Monica.

“I’ll take that as a yes.” Monica beamed with joy.

Jeanne was speechless.

“Let’s catch up another time. The nurse came to change my dressing.” Monica had always been in a rush.

After saying that, she hung up the phone.

Jeanne also put down the phone.

After putting it down, she curled up under the blanket.

She was staring straight at the ceiling, a little lost in thought.

If it was seven years ago…

Perhaps it would still be possible.

Now that seven years had passed, it was just too difficult!

…

In the Sanders’ residence.

Inside the black confinement room.

The floor was cold and covered in blood.

There was also a desolate cry.

“Let me out, let me out, I want to see my dad, I want to see my dad! You bunch of lowlifes, if you treat me like this, my dad will kill you!” Melody’s heart-wrenching voice was heard. She used all the strength in her body and roared fiercely.

It had been a few hours since she was locked in this room.

No one had come in, nor did anyone treat her injuries. She was not given food or water.

If this continued, she might really die here.

No!

Melody did not want to die!

She wanted to kill Jeanne.

She had suffered the greatest humiliation in her life. She had to return an eye for an eye. She had to!

Melody screamed in the cold confinement room.

The heavy metal door was suddenly opened.

Melody, who was lying on the ground, suddenly became excited. She quickly got up from the ground and rushed over.

She wanted to rush out of the door, but she was pushed back rudely.

The moment she was pushed back, her body fell heavily to the ground again. Her weakness made it impossible for her to get up.

She kept shouting, “You dogs, how dare you treat me like this? I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you!”

“Enough!” A fierce shout suddenly came from the confinement room.

Melody’s body stiffened.

She raised her head and saw her dad.

He was standing tall in front of her.

Her eyes turned red immediately.

Melody went from being ferocious into aggrieved. She crawled over and hugged her dad’s leg. “Dad, you’re finally here. You have no idea how scared I am. I’ve been bullied so miserably. You must help me. You must help me kill Jeanne.”

The chief looked at her coldly.

His expression was extremely ugly.

He suddenly kicked Melody away.

Melody looked at her dad in disbelief.

Ever since she was young, although her dad was very dignified, he had never treated her this way.

He had always doted on her the most.

“I’ve warned you not to go against Jeanne!” The chief’s cold voice was emotionless.

“She was the one who kept clinging to Edward. She didn’t know her place!” Melody was very agitated. “She’s a b*tch. What right does she have to snatch my man?! Dad, I’m your daughter. I’m a Sander and the third princess of Harken! What right does she have to snatch my man? I should let her learn a lesson. I should let her know that she’s courting death by going against a Sander. Dad, I’m doing this for the dignity of our family...”

“A Sander!” The chief sneered. His smile was extremely cruel. “Do you think that she isn’t one?!”

Melody was shocked.

She looked straight at her father.

She looked at him in disbelief. She did not believe it at all.

The words that Jeanne had said to her suddenly rang in her mind.

Jeanne had told Melody that she could also be a Sander.

It was obvious that she was telling her that she was also a member of the Sanders.

No.

Melody did not believe it.

She did not believe that Jeanne was her dad’s daughter!

She did not believe that her dad had an illegitimate daughter outside.

It was clear that her dad and her mom were a match and had been in love for decades.

They had raised a total of five children.

To everyone in the world, her dad had always loved her mom.

It was not just in the eyes of the public. Melody could also see that her parents had a very good relationship.

How was that possible?!

Melody looked at her father malevolently, but since her dad had said it, she had no choice but to believe it!

She gritted her teeth and looked at the chief. “You betrayed my mom? You actually betrayed my mom?!”

The chief’s expression was cold.

He was indifferent to Melody’s madness.

He said, “I’ve given you enough chances. Today, it ends here.”

Melody’s heart skipped a beat, and a chill ran down her spine.

She looked straight at her dad. Her dad, who was usually very nice to her, had a cruel expression on his face.

He said cruelly, “7:14 pm is an auspicious time. Send her on her way.”

“Dad!” Melody screamed, “What are you going to do? Are you going to kill me?!”

The chief glanced at her. “You don’t know what’s good for you, so you deserve retribution. This is also to set a good example for your brothers and sisters!”

He left coldly after saying that.

“Dad, Dad, I’m your daughter. You can’t treat me like this... Dad... How can you do this to me because of Jeanne, an illegitimate daughter? You... Dad... I was wrong, I was wrong. Please let me go. I know my mistake now... Please don’t kill me, please don’t kill me. I beg you. I’ll be obedient in the future. I won’t mess with Jeanne anymore. I won’t Mess with her anymore… Ah...”

From resisting at first, Melody became angry, then she broke down. Afterward, she compromised as she was afraid and in despair…

Melody’s life ended here.

Virtue had its reward, evil its retribution.

This was her retribution.
