Chapter 1534: Paige, The Divine Helper

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Paige asked in her young voice, “Godfather, how long do we have to wait? I’m hungry.”

It was Finn who told Paige to call him Godfather. Since Piage was at an age where she did not know how to address him, she would call him whatever he told her to.

“Wait a while more. When Godmother comes out, I will bring you home to eat your favorite barbecue pork ribs.”

“Alright.” Paige nodded obediently.

Finn patted Paige’s head lovingly and then turned to look at the entrance of the Cardellini Enterprise’s building. He looked for Monica among the people who were coming and going from work.

Suddenly, he quickly opened the car door. After getting out of the car, he quickly opened the back door, picked up Paige from the child seat, and strode over. He walked up to Monica, causing Monica to stop in her tracks and frown.

At that moment, many employees were getting off work, so everyone could not help but look at them. They watched as a man appeared in front of their chairman with an extremely cute little girl in his arms.

“Godmother.” The moment Paige saw Monica, she was beyond excited.

Monica forced a smile at Paige. She had been prejudiced against Paige and was resistant toward her. Yet, for three consecutive days, Finn had brought Paige here to look for her.

She already disliked Finn, so what more another one? Did Finn not know who she liked and disliked?

“Paige kept requesting to see you, so I brought her here,” Finn said.

Paige quickly nodded at the side. “Godmother, I miss you so much.”

She missed her godmother so much because her godfather said that they could eat barbecue pork ribs after seeing her.

Monica responded, “Now that you’ve seen me, you can go back.” “I want Godmother to go back with me,” Paige said loudly.

She also sounded a little willful. However, because of her cute face and unusually soft voice, no one could not get angry at her at all.

Monica’s heart softened at that moment, but she still managed to remain calm.

She said, “I have something on today, but next time, I’ll come and look for

Paige when I have the time.”

“No, I want to go back with you,” Paige cried out like a spoiled child, looking extremely aggrieved.

Of course, Finn, who was standing at the side, taught Paige everything. He just did not expect Paige to have such good acting skills.

In fact, he did not have much hope for a three-year-old child, but at that moment, she had completely exceeded his expectations.

He looked at Monica, who looked very troubled.

Still, she stood her ground. “Be good, Paige. I’m really busy. If you don’t want to be with Uncle Finn, you can get him to send you back to your father.”

“Boohoo…” At the mention of her father, Paige cried even louder.

Of course, it was also Finn who taught her that. He knew very well that Monica would use that excuse to reject Paige, so he told Paige to cry whenever Monica mentioned her father. The more she cried, the better.

Not only was Paige good at acting, but she also had a good memory. At that, Finn felt relieved.

“Don’t cry, Paige. Don’t cry.” Monica was a little flustered.

At that moment, all the people coming and going were her employees. If everyone saw her bullying a child, what threat would she get in the future?

“My father doesn’t want me anymore. Boohoo…” Paige muttered.

She looked extremely pitiful, and Monica could not bring herself to say no to Paige, even though Paige was not Jeanne’s daughter.

Paige was simply a little witch!

“Alright, I’ll accompany you. Don’t cry.” Monica agreed, reluctantly.

“I knew you love me the most, Godmother.” As she said that, she was about to jump into Monica’s embrace.

“Be good, Paige. Your godmother is pregnant with two little sisters, so she can’t carry you.” Finn held Paige tightly and explained.

confusion. However, the look on Page’s face at the moment made his heart melt.

He had never thought about whether the child in Monica’s stomach was a boy or a girl… but it was clear that he was really biased and wanted a daughter.

“It won’t be long before you become an elder sister, Paige,” Finn explained.

“That’s great. I’m finally going to be an elder sister.” Paige looked excited.

“Godfather, is it a younger sister? Is the baby in Godmother’s stomach a younger sister?”

“Of course.” Finn was certain.

Overjoyed, Paige wrapped her chubby arms around Finn’s neck. “I love younger sisters the most.”

“Me too.” Finn was very loving when it came to interacting with Paige.

Beside them, Monica’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

Why must it be girls? She was only three months pregnant. There was no way to tell the gender. How could he be so sure that they were girls in her belly? She suddenly wanted to give birth to a pair of sons to piss Finn off.

“Are you hungry, Paige? Let’s go home early, okay?” Finn asked Paige.

A man, who had always been cold, was suddenly unusually warm toward Paige. When they were in Bamboo Garden, Finn had never been so intimate with Paige! Could he have changed because he was going to be a father?

Monica stopped her train of thought. They were her children. What did they have to do with Finn?

She watched as Finn placed Paige into the backseat and carefully fastened her seatbelt. Then, he turned around and said to her, “Get in here.”

The next second, he went to hold her hand, but Monica immediately avoided him. Instead of feeling embarrassed, he walked over to the car and opened the door for Monica.

Once Monica sat down, Finn returned to the driver’s seat and drove back at the speed of a snail.

Monica was also relatively quiet in the car. Although she did not like those two people, for some reason, she still got on their pirate ship.

It took a long time before they arrived at Finn’s garage. On the way there, the movement of the car made Monica fall asleep. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica felt sleepier after she got pregnant. Coupled with the fact that she did not get to take a lunch break after they encountered an unexpected accident, she fell asleep in Finn’s car, which was moving too slowly.

Paige naturally noticed it. The moment she wanted to call Monica, Finn quickly covered Paige’s small mouth and whispered in her ear, “Your godmother is too tired. Don’t wake her up.”

Paige blinked as if she had something to say.

Finn let go of her and reminded her, “Speak softly.”

Paige said in a very, very soft voice, “We’re getting out of the car. Aren’t we going to take Godmother with us?”

“I’ll carry her. Paige, be good and follow me home, okay?” Finn asked.

Paige nodded obediently. “Okay.”

Finn was very gentle to Paige.

He got out of the car and closed the door carefully. Then, he carried Paige out of the car before he walked over to Monica and picked her up from the back seat.

The moment he picked her up, Monica moved her body uncomfortably. Finn’s body stiffened as he thought that Monica was about to wake up. Unexpectedly, she found a comfortable position and lay quietly in Finn’s arms.

Finn smiled. At that moment, it felt like he was holding the entire world in his arms..
