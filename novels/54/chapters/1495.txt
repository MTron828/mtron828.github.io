Chapter 1496: Edward and Candice Clarify Their Relationship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It did not go according to her expectations at all. In fact, it was completely out of her expectations.

How could Candice be so calm? How could she let that matter go as if nothing had happened? She had finally created a conflict between them. How could she just flush it away like that?

Chloe gritted her teeth. She refused to believe that she would not be able to affect Candice and Edward’s marriage. With that, she composed herself and picked up the phone to make a call.

The call connected. “Hello.”

“Edward, I’m sorry. I’m sorry…” Chloe sobbed.

“What’s the matter?” The other party sounded indifferent.

“I didn’t do it on purpose. I really didn’t. I-I…” At that moment, Chloe was even getting a little emotional and sounded like she was about to cry.

“If you can’t explain it clearly now, you can call me back when your emotions have stabilized. I’m very busy.” He was so cold that he was almost inhuman.

So many men in the world loved her, but how could Edward be so cold-blooded to her?

She quickly said, “I didn’t mean to tell my sister about Teddy giving her birth control pills. I just let it slip. I’m really afraid that it’ll affect your relationship. I don’t know what to do. I…

The more she spoke, the more sorry she sounded. It was as if she had done something terribly wrong and was extremely guilty when, in reality, a triumphant smile was stretched across Chloe’s face.

Candice wanted to let the matter rest peacefully, but she would not let Chloe get what she wanted. She had to expose the conflict between them so that they had to talk about the matter!

“Edward, what should I do now? What do you think I should do to make up for the mistake I just made? Otherwise, I’ll feel bad for the rest of my life.” Chloe kept making herself seem like the victim to make herself seem pitiful.

However, the other party hung up the phone. He was so cold to her that Chloe wanted to smash her phone!

No men could resist her pitiful appearance! What right did Edward have to treat her like that?

Edward hung up the phone and sat in the huge office.

The highest administrative office of Harken was right beside the moat. Even though it was not high up, nothing was in front of it to block the view.

“You guys should head out first,” Edward said coldly.

“Yes.”

The people who had been respectfully accompanying him left. After that, Edward took out a cigarette and lit it.

He thought, sure enough, if he lied once, he would have to cover the lie up with more lies until he could not pull himself out from the lies. Then, when the day come when those lies were exposed, it was too late!

He smoked one cigarette after another until the entire office was filled with the smell of cigarettes. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He put out the last cigarette butt and picked up his phone. He opened the surveillance application on his phone and looked at the surveillance camera in Bamboo Garden.

Candice was playing with Paige in the hall. There was a smile on her face, and she looked no different from usual. However, was it good or bad?

At night, Candice coaxed Paige to sleep. Just as she was about to return to her room, she stopped in her tracks when she passed by George’s room.

It was because there was something about George’s diary that she could not describe. It was as if she had an uncontrollable impulse to look at that diary. For some reason, it seemed to her that there was a lot of truth written in that diary.

Nevertheless, she controlled her emotions and walked past George’s room. She was just at the door to her room when she saw Edward return in his suit.

No matter how late it was, his aura was still powerful, and he would never let her see how tired he was.

“You’re back.” Candice smiled. Edward nodded. “Yes.”

“Have you had dinner?”

“I have,” Edward replied.

“You should rest early.” Candice naturally took his hand.

It was as if nothing had happened between them and things were still the same between them — as if Candice did not know that he had put birth control pills in her breakfast.

When they returned to the room, Candice went to the bathroom to prepare a bath for Edward. “You should take a shower first.”

Edward nodded and watched as Candice busied herself for him as usual. By the time he came out of the shower, Candice had fallen asleep..
