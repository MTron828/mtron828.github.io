She suppressed her emotions.

Indeed, Kingsley did not turn her into a cold-blooded and heartless machine. However, to a large extent, he did have her learn how to disguise and control her emotions.

She picked up the phone and sent a message. “I’ve adjusted my state of mind.”

She was indirectly telling Kingsley that she would let go of Lucy’s death and learn how to accept the death of an assassin.

She would even learn how to accept the death of someone close to her.

However, there was no reply from the other end.

Kingsley looked at the words on his phone screen and chose to ignore them.

There were rumors that he was the Hills’ most capable successor over the years, but the rumors had never been true. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at the man who had entered from the corner of his eye.

“We went to the old town and found the bodies of the other five killers, but we didn’t find Ms. Harmon’s body,” the man reported.

Kingsley’s expression changed.

“Ms. Harmon’s accident happened at a different place than the others. The other party must have destroyed her body to cover up the evidence.”

“Yes,” Kingsley replied.

“In that case... do we still need to gather manpower to look for Ms. Harmon’s body?” the man asked.

“There’s no need.”

“Yes.”

With that, the man left respectfully.

Kingsley stood on the balcony outside, looking at the countless Delta Islands.

In fact, it was good that she did not come back.

The Delta Islands were not a place for people to rest in peace!

…

In Lawrence Enterprise, in the vice president’s office, Joshua threw his phone in front of Eden and flew into a rage. “You said to use the trouble caused by the agents to kick Jeanne out of the Lawrence Enterprise! Now, look at it! It was a blessing in disguise for Jeanne.”

Eden looked at Joshua coldly.

Joshua had gained a lot of courage now and even started yelling at him.

Seeing that Eden did not answer, Joshua became even angrier. “Eden, is that all you’ve got to prove yourself? I thought you were really powerful, but after plotting against Jeanne so many times in the dark, when was a success? When have you not been fooled by Jeanne? If my mom didn’t think you could do it, I wouldn’t have wanted you to help me at all. It’s a waste of my time!”

“Are you done?” Eden’s face was extremely grim.

He still had a lingering fear in his heart after his Fourth Uncle threatened him today. At the thought of how he almost died at the hands of his Fourth Uncle, he felt so aggrieved that he wanted to kill someone.

In front of his Fourth Uncle and Jeanne, was he worthless?

On top of that, while he was questioning himself, Joshua mocked him. His expression was hideous, to say the least.

However, Joshua did not seem to care because he was furious. “You can’t even admit that you’re not capable!”

“If I’m not capable, are you? If you’re capable, you wouldn’t have no say in the company with so many shares you have. What right do you think you have to criticize me? Let me tell you, Joshua, you best not provoke me. If I don’t help you, Jeanne will kill you in a minute!”

“What did you say?” Joshua was also furious at that moment.

“I told you to get lost!” Eden roared.

His hostility made Joshua’s imposing manner look weak.

“If you still want me to help you, you’d better shut up and get out!” Eden vented all his anger on Joshua.

“Eden, what exactly are you so proud of? I’m flattering you by asking you to work at Lawrence Enterprise. I can’t believe you’re so ungrateful. In the end, you’re just a f*cking dog that the Swans kicked out–”

“Bam!” Eden punched Joshua hard in the face.

Eden’s sudden punch caught Joshua off guard as he never thought that Eden would hit him.

Who the hell was Eden? What right did Eden have to hit him?

He was the chairman of Lawrence Enterprise, and Eden was just a dog that he raised. What right did Eden have to treat him like that?

However, before Joshua could react, Eden opened the office door rudely and left.

Joshua looked at Eden’s back.

He was so angry that he wanted to kill Eden!

Eden, on the other hand, immediately left Lawrence Enterprise.

He had suffered enough from his Fourth Uncle and Jeanne, but he knew his worth not to take Joshua’s insult of him. Besides, he had never taken Joshua seriously. He was the dignified Eldest Young Master Swan, and he grew up with other people’s praises! Never in his life had he been in such a sorry state before!
