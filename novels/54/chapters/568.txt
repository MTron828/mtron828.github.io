Chapter 569: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Alexander had said everything he wanted to.

However, Jeanne did not need his permission to leave.

As soon as Jeanne left, Alexander exploded in anger and hit his desk hard to vent his emotions.

Joshua was also furious at that moment, but seeing that his father was even angrier, he did not dare to lose his temper and could only stay by the side.

Alexander vented his anger for a long time before he finally calmed down.

When Joshua saw that Alexander’s expression had eased up a little, he quickly said, “Dad, what does Jeanne mean? Does she just mean that grandpa is now siding with her?”

Alexander glared at Joshua and did not reply.

Taking Alexander’s no reply as a tacit agreement, Joshua immediately panicked. “Has grandpa changed his attitude toward Jeanne? Seeing that Jeanne is capable and has the money, he probably thinks of handing Lawrence Enterprise to Jeanne. If that’s the case, dad, what should I do? What should I do?”

“Enough!” Furious, Alexander said, “If you were more capable, you wouldn’t be in this position now!”

“B-But... I still can’t accept it. Dad, I will never accept Lawrence Enterprise falling into Jeanne’s hands. Think of something. I’m your only son. Only I can carry on the family line.”

“Other than forcing me like this, can you think of anything else?” Alexander shouted at Joshua. “It’s useless.”

Joshua’s face flushed red at Alexander’s words. “It’s not my fault. You didn’t teach me anything.”

“Joshua!” Alexander was exasperated.

“It’s a fact.” Joshua was probably speaking rashly because he, too, was angry. “Grandpa doesn’t trust you because you’re not capable enough. I’ve been following you all these years, and I really haven’t learned anything from you–”

“Shut up!” Alexander was embarrassed by his son’s words. “If you can, go and fight for it yourself! Jeanne doesn’t have anyone to teach her either, yet she’s so powerful. Why don’t you go and compete with her?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After being yelled at, Joshua did not dare to say anything else.

Alexander shouted at Joshua, “Get out!”

“Dad, about Lawrence Enterprise–”

“I told you to get out!” Alexander was fuming.

Hence, Joshua left without resisting anymore.

Alexander was so angry that he pushed everything in front of him to the ground.

If Lawrence Enterprise was really handed over to Jeanne… He would never agree to it, even if he died!

…

When Jeanne returned to the office, she was in such a good mood that she had her secretary make another cup of cappuccino.

She sipped on it slowly, thinking Alexander must be very angry at that moment.

Not only would he be angry, but he must also be dissatisfied.

She deliberately let Alexander think that Jonathan taught her everything she knew today and that Jonathan taught her but not him. Alexander should finally see the light now.

Toward Jonathan and Alexander, that father and son duo, who were equally vicious and merciless, they should be allowed to kill each other.

Jeanne’s mood was perfect.

She took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up. “Grandpa.”

“I heard things went very smoothly.”

“You’re really well-informed, grandpa. I was going to report it to you.”Jeanne appeared very respectful. “According to what we discussed previously, it has gone very smoothly. Now, we’re just waiting for the senior management to go to their posts or leave their posts. I guess that in three days, it should be settled.”

“Since these people have left, have you thought about who will take over some of the vacant positions?”

“I have. I will immediately get the secretary to draft a recruitment advertisement. According to the current situation in Lawrence Enterprise, quite some people should have signed up. Grandpa, you don’t have to worry about it. I can give you an answer in at most a week.”

“I believe you.” Jonathan did not hide his confidence in Jeanne.

“Thank you, grandpa.”

“Come back home for dinner tonight. I’ll get the servants to prepare some of your favorite dishes.”

“Grandpa, do you know what I like to eat?”

“I don’t know, but can’t I ask?” Jonathan asked back.

At that old fox’s age, his reaction was still really quick.

With that, Jeanne told Jonathan what she liked, meaning that she accepted how good Jonathan was treating her.

Jonathan said, “Jeannie, I never used to care about you, but from now on, I will try my best to make up for it.”

“Okay.” Jeanne also agreed immediately.

She did not make herself sound too emotional, or it would seem fake. After all, to make a person believe in oneself, one could not be too excessive in their act.
