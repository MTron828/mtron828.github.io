Chapter 1781: The Drastic Change in Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The smile on Shelly’s face gradually faded. She did not Imow why, but she started to feel that Nox had changed for the better, and she seemed to have started to accept him.

She gritted her teeth, not wanting to think too much about it. Seeing that Nox had finished his meal, she took the initiative to clear the plates.

“I’ll do it.” Nox shouted at Shelly, “Since I’ve cooked, let me do the dishes as well.”

Shelly frowned. Did Nox’s personality change today? What was he trying to do? She found it very unusual. Moreover, it was not the weekend. Did he not need to go to work today? Shelly had many questions, but in the end, she kept it all to herself.

She sat on the sofa and watched Nox busy himself. Although his movements were a little clumsy, she could tell that he was trying his best to adapt to the situation. Hence, she turned around and decided not to look.

She was afraid that it would stir up some emotions in her. In fact, she was even more terrified that she would develop a good impression of him, so she decided to watch some TV on the sofa.

While she was watching, her phone suddenly rang. Shelly glanced at the caller ID. Even though the number had been deleted, she could recognize the string of numbers. She could not help but glance at Nox, who was still busy in the kitchen. Then, she picked up the phone and walked to the balcony outside the living room.

Nox glanced at Shelly. In the end, he did not say anything and just smiled bitterly. Only God knew that when she was drunk and called out Benjamin’s name last night, his heart shattered into pieces. He could not help but get someone to check if Benjamin was back, and sure enough, Benjamin was back. Therefore, Shelly and Benjamin met last night.

Shelly would not usually come back so late at night, but she did last night. On top of that, she had never been a woman who would get herself so drunk, but she was really drunk last night. There were too many abnormalities, and it turned out to be because she saw Benjamin, whom she had not seen for a long time.

He lowered his head and continued to wash the dishes seriously. Even though he could guess who the call was from, he was still trying to make himself look indifferent.

Shelly answered the call. “Hello.” “Are you awake?” the other party asked.

“I just woke up.”

“You were drunk last night.”

“Yeah, I thought I wasn’t drunk, but when I went back, I was so drunk. I can’t remember much from last night as well. I really can’t drink like this next time.”

The other party seemed to chuckle. “I tried to tell you that last night, but you didn’t listen to me.”

“I didn’t anticipate the aftereffects to be so bad.”

“Are you feeling better now?”

“Much better.” Shelly nodded.

The conversation between the two of them was so easy-going and calm. Nox could not see her clearly from afar, but he was certain that Shelly was smiling the entire time.

“Oh, right.” Shelly asked, “Did you call me just to ask how I was today?”

“No. Sarah drank too much last night, and I just received a call from the private room saying that she had dropped her phone at the nightclub. After asking around, I found out that it should be Sarah’s. But since Sarah’s phone is at the nightclub, no one can contact her, so I’m calling you to see if it’s okay for you to send it to Sarah or how to contact her.”

“Did you leave it at the front desk?”

“Yes.”

“In that case, I’ll go get it and send it to her later.”

“Will it be too much trouble for you?” Benjamin asked with concern.

“No, I don’t have anything to do at home anyway. Besides, I have to pick Bella up from school later, so

I just need to leave a little earlier.” “Thank you.” Benjamin was very polite.

“No trouble at all.”

“Then… If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up now,” Benjamin said. It seemed like they were deliberately keeping a distance from each other.

“Bye-bye.”

“Bye-bye.”

After hanging up the phone, Shelly was still in a daze as she looked at her phone. She felt differently toward Benjamin than others.

She took a deep breath. Of course, she did not want to repeat the same mistake since Benjamin’s family could not accept her. Before Benjamin made a career for himself, she did not think she was worthy of him. Now, she was even more unworthy.

She put down her phone and turned around to walk into the living room. By then, Nox had washed the dishes, and Shelly instinctively went to the kitchen to clean up..L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
