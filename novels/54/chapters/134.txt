Chapter 135: I’m Not as Easy to Deal With as Before

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Actually, what’s the big deal?

She just wanted to tell these people that she was not easily bullied.

In fact, she wanted to say that they can not bully her.

Something flashed across her eyes.

There was a knock on the door.

Jeanne controlled her emotions, and she only needed a second.

Her tone was calm. “Come in.”

Forrest pushed the door open and entered.

“Director Lawrence.”

Jeanne nodded slightly.

Forrest said bluntly, “I just heard that you had an argument with the Executive General Manager .”

“Yes.”

“Did he disagree with us going against the government?”

“Don’t bother about him.” Jeanne was cold.

“But...”

“Don’t worry, his authority has been stripped away. He doesn’t have the ability to order us around.”

“But will this affect the relationship between the two of you?” Forrest asked.

Relationship.

What kind of relationship could they have?

Her father had never had any feelings for her.

She said, “No.”

“Then...” Forrest seemed to still have some hesitancy.

“The reason why Lawrence Enterprise has developed into such a pathetic state was because of the leader’s cowardice and incompetence. The reason why you were all waiting for something to happen without working hard was that everyone looked down on the leader. Until now, don’t tell me you still have expectations for them?” Jeanne mocked.

Forrest shook his head, “No, I’m just afraid that it would be difficult for you.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even though Forrest had not been working together with Jeanne for long.

However, he truly admired Jeanne.

He was even worried that because of this incident, she would be kicked out of the Lawrence Corporation.

“If this project fails in the end, it’s because I’m not capable enough. Of course, I should leave. If it succeeds, no one from the Lawrence Corporation can make things difficult for me.”

Forrest pursed his lips.

This domineering attitude was what he admired about Jeanne.

“If you’re afraid of being implicated by me, you can choose to withdraw now...”

“I’m not afraid,” Forrest interrupted Jeanne, “It’s been a long time since I’ve done something that made my blood boil. It was you who ignited my passion for work. At worst, we can just end this once and for all.” Forrest was very determined.

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “Then go out and work.”

“Yes.”

Forrest left.

At this moment, Jeanne had completely calmed down.

She looked at the time.

It was still early.

She had to give George a little more time.

…

Joshua left Alexander’s office.

The kick he received from Jeanne caused him so much pain that he felt like dying. However, after the pain passed, he could not find which part of his body was injured.

Moreover, Alexander was in a fit of anger. Joshua did not dare to say anything more. He was afraid that if he said too much, he would be scolded instead. Hence, he found an excuse to return to his office.

The kick really did not hurt anymore.

He even took off his shirt to take a look. Other than the slight redness, he did not seem to have any other injuries.

He endured it and did not go to the hospital.

Moreover, if the news of him being beaten up by Jeanne got out, his reputation would be damaged.

He sat on his office chair and hurriedly called Eden. “Brother-in-law.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Just now, Jeanne and my father had an argument. They even fought.” Joshua reported.

“Is that so?” Eden smiled with pride.

“My father probably hates Jeanne now. Once this project fails, Jeanne will definitely be kicked out of the Lawrences. I think she might even be directly kicked out of the Lawrences like she was seven years ago.”

“That’s what she deserves.”

“That’s right.” Joshua chimed in, looking a little excited. He suddenly thought of something and quickly said, “But brother-in-law, I feel that Jeanne has really changed a lot.”

“What?” Eden frowned.

“Just now, when my dad tried to hit her, his hand was caught by Jeanne instead. At that moment, my dad was even shackled and couldn’t move an inch! Not only that. I wanted to go up and help, but Jeanne gave me a kick and sent me flying.” Joshua said angrily.

“That’s why I told you to train more.” Eden did not take it to heart. “Are you still a man when you can’t even beat a woman?”

“Brother-in-law, I just want to tell you that Jeanne knows martial arts.”

“Martial arts? When I was dating Jeanne back then, Jeanne even needed me to open a bottled drink for her.”

“That’s why I’m suspecting that Jeanne must have experienced something during these seven years abroad.”

“What could she have experienced? All she could do is sell her body.” Eden said with a sarcastic expression. “If there’s nothing else, don’t waste my time. I still have something important to do.”

“Brother-in-law...”

Eden had already hung up the phone.

Joshua was speechless.

He admitted that he was lazy and did not like to exercise, so his body was not strong.

However, no matter how bad it was, he would not be kicked away by a woman.

Jeanne was definitely not simple.

On second thought.

In any case, Jeanne had provoked Eden.

No matter what, she would still be killed by Eden.

So he did not need to be afraid, nor did he need to worry about anything.

Sooner or later, the Lawrence Enterprise would belong to him.

…

An entire morning passed.

Eden sat on his office chair, looking very relaxed.

He looked at the computer screen and the corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

So that was all Jeanne was capable of…

She tried to attack for about ten minutes in the morning, and now she was completely quiet.

She was indeed a woman.

A stupid woman.

He picked up his phone and dialed. “Micheal.”

“Yes.”

“From what I know, Jeanne no longer has the ability to resist.” He was a little proud, “Next, I will think of a way to get MUK to terminate the contract from their side. At that time, I will also bribe the media to ridicule Jeanne’s incompetence, and even create some negative news to damage her reputation, so that she can no longer stay in Harken. This way, Ms. Sanders will clear the obstacle between her and Uncle Edward.”

“Okay.” Micheal nodded, “But don’t be in a hurry to take the next step. Since the matter is already under our control, don’t be too hasty. I’m afraid that something uncertain will happen. At this time, seek stability.”

“Don’t worry, I know what to do.”

“Right.” Micheal suddenly thought of something. “Have you ever thought of taking control of the Lawrence Enterprise?”

Eden was stunned.

Micheal said, “I’m only making a suggestion. With Edward taking control of the Swan Enterprise, it’ll be harder for you to truly establish yourself in the same company. On the contrary, it’ll be easier for you to take control of the external parties.”

“Once Jeanne gets lost, it will be a piece of cake for me to acquire the Lawrence Enterprise.” Alexander and Joshua were really useless, after all.

“In short, it’s up to you. After all, you have a special relationship with the Lawrences.” Micheal only said what he needed to say.

“Yes, I understand.”

“I won’t say anymore. I’m about to start my meeting.”

“Alright.”

After hanging up the phone, Eden sneered.

He had never thought of buying the Lawrence Enterprise. In his heart, he did not really fancy such a company. However, after Micheal’s reminder, he suddenly felt that it made sense.

Instead of being bullied by his Uncle Edward in the Swan Enterprise, it was better for him to find another way to improve his strength.

Without a doubt, the Lawrence Enterprise could be the first door to his new world.

The corners of his mouth curled up into a sinister smile.

He should not be blamed for being ruthless and merciless. Instead, the Lawrences should blame themselves for their own incompetence.

If he really purchased the Lawrence Enterprise, he would be doing them a great favor.

The Lawrences should be grateful to him.

With this thought in mind, Eden’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked up the call unhurriedly. Today, he had an inexplicable sense of superiority. “Hello.”

“Mr.Swan.” A somewhat urgent voice came from the other end, “Many public platforms on the internet were hacked. The news about the Sanders targeting the Lawrence Enterprise is all up on the platforms now. No matter how hard we try to fix it, the posts can not be deleted. The number of viewers has started to soar, and the number of comments is also increasing at an alarming rate.”

Eden’s expression suddenly changed.
