The moment they walked in, the two of them were instantly stunned as there were many cars parked under the bushes.

However, because it was blocked by the leaves, no one would see it if they did not walk in.

All the cars did not go back the way they came. Instead, they were parked and hidden here.

Finn turned around and looked at Nox, who quickly nodded, confirming that Kingsley and his men must be there.

After knowing that, Nox became excited.

Finn also confirmed out loud, “They should be in the forest over there.”

He did not know why they were hiding, but judging from the current situation, Kingsley and the others were definitely there.

“Let’s go in!” Nox made a prompt decision.

Finn nodded.

With that, the two of them led a group of people, divided them into several groups, and carefully walked into the forest.

After walking for about half an hour, Finn and Nox stopped in their tracks when they saw a building in the distance.

The building was lit up, and it was obvious that it was inhabited. The existence of buildings in an old forest was already inconceivable, and now, there were even lights, which was really strange.

The two of them immediately knew what was going on.

Finn gave Nox a look, and Nox understood tacitly what he meant.

Nox lowered his head and said into the walkie-talkie, “Everyone, gather at the location I mentioned.”

“Okay.”

Once Nox sent out a location, Finn gestured to Nox.

When Nox received the signal, he did not hesitate and led a few people to approach the building first.

Finn waited for about ten minutes before he followed along with a few people.

Nox took the lead, so if they were discovered, Nox would lead them away, and Finn would take the opportunity to sneak in. That was a tacit understanding they had developed over the years.

As expected, after about two minutes, gunshots sounded in the quiet forest.

Meanwhile, in the building, Jeanne, who had just laid down, suddenly sat up on the bed.

Kingsley was already at the door of her room. He said coldly, “Someone’s here. Let’s go!”

Jeanne’s heart raced.

Before she could think about who it was, she quickly left with?Kingsley.

The two of them went to the basement first. By then, Edward had changed into clean clothes, but he still looked weak and was on the ground, leaning against the wall behind him. When he sensed someone approaching, he looked up.

In the next second, he saw them quickly untie his chains and drag him into an underground tunnel.

From the start to the end, he did not ask about what was going on.

However, with Edward’s intelligence, he should be able to guess why they had left in such a hurry.

Someone must have caught up.

That person… would mostly likely be Nox and his men!

Edward did not have much strength and was ruthlessly dragged away.

Kingsley and Jeanne walked in front of him and did not turn back to look at him. They simply hurried on their way.

The reason why they stayed and interrogated Edward was that they did not want to bring the war to the Delta Islands. If they killed Edward, they could throw Edward’s body at M Underground Organization’s base and make it look like the latter killed him. Then, no one would come to seek revenge on them.

On the other hand, it was because they had an escape route here, and no one would pose a threat to them.

Kingsley and company passed through the underground tunnel very quickly.

At that moment, there were only six people with Kingsley. Other than Jeanne and Mason, he only had four personal bodyguards, and one of them was holding onto Edward.

Hence, only a few people were left in the building to stop Finn and Nox’s attacks.

Kingsley did not leave too many people behind, probably because he did not expect to be found so quickly.

Inside the building, Nox’s group quickly took care of the remaining assassins because of the disparity in numbers. Finn had also found the underground tunnel and was about to follow them when he stopped.

Nox cleared out the last assassin and rushed over. Without thinking twice, he rushed in.

“Calm down.” Finn pulled him back.”There might be a bomb buried inside.”

“I don’t care!”

“Let’s go outside,” Finn suggested.

“God knows where he is taking Edward to.” Nox could not care less about anything else and wanted to rush in. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Finn thought about it for a moment, but in the end, he did not stop Nox.

However, he quickly left the underground tunnel and led the group into the forest.

He could not allow their men to be killed. He needed to ensure that at least one of them was alive to have a chance to save Edward.

Moreover, the underground tunnel was nothing more than a shortcut to escape to a certain place.

Since they could not leave on foot, they would either return to the exit, which was the place where they parked their vehicles, or they could go to another open space and leave.

Other than the highway at the exit, the other places here were all dead ends.

Even so, he did not think that they would return to their original location. After all, if their base was discovered, the exit would definitely be discovered as well. It was impossible for them to go back and seek their own deaths. The only possibility was that they would go somewhere else.

Since there were no roads or cars to go somewhere else, they had to use a helicopter.

Finn stopped in his tracks.

The trees here were dense, making it difficult to land the helicopter. Therefore, the place somewhere else should be quite far from here.

At least, at a glance, he could not see any open spaces.

If the distance was far, there would be time to catch up.

Furthermore…

Finn’s eyes narrowed. He had, almost instantly, figure out where they were going, and that was at the edge of the cliff at the end of the forest.

If he guessed it right, he was right. However, if he guessed wrong, he could only rely on Nox.

Without any hesitation, Finn led a group of people on a mad chase.
