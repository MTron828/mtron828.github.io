997 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

“You’re slandering me!” Daniel was agitated.

He could not refute anything else, but he had to refute that matter.

In front of so many people, and now it was even a live broadcast on the internet, he definitely had to clear his name.

“Otherwise, how would you explain the false report you made? We have no enmity between us!” Monica was overbearing.

Daniel said in a panic, “Regarding this report, all I did was read it out. As for whether there were any problems with the report, whether it was a mistake or it was intentional as you said, I can only tell you that I know nothing. The report that I have is the one in my hands. I’m not the person in charge of the quality inspection and even the release of the report!”

“So, you’re selling Michael out to protect yourself, Director Cook!”

“Monica, you– If you continue to slander me like this, I’ll call the police!”

“There’s no need to trouble you for that, Director Cook. I’ve already called the police!” Monica said loudly and clearly.

Daniel’s expression changed, and he looked at Monica in a panic.

Monica said, “I called the police for Cardellini Enterprise and also for that child who died unjustly! Director Cook, you should go to the police station and explain the truth. I believe the law will give you justice!”

At that moment, Daniel wanted to say something to Monica, but he could not. It was clearly useless to say anything!

No one had expected Monica to have changed into another person!

The door of the press conference hall was pushed open again. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A few police officers walked toward Daniel and cuffed his hands. “You’re suspected of abuse of power, favoritism, intentional murder, framing, and other charges. We need you to follow us to the police station for investigation.”

“I’m innocent. I really didn’t do those things,” Daniel hurriedly explained, and his face was already pale from fear.

He probably never thought that he would be taken away by the police less than a month after he became the head of the quality inspection department!

“Whether you’re innocent or not, the court will decide.” The police officer’s face was cold.

Monica also said to Daniel, “Director Cook, being the mastermind and the instigator of the crime is different. You have to come clean. By the way, let me remind you again that the personnel whom you mentioned did the test has also been taken to the police station. I believe that under the strict interrogation, the truth will soon be revealed!”

Daniel was frightened by Monica’s words, and his whole body trembled. He was completely out of his wits.

He just numbly followed the police and left the press conference.

Monica watched his figure disappear. Then, she turned around to face the camera and all the reporters at the scene.

She said, “I don’t know if someone is manipulating the situation behind the scenes, or if there’s a greater force deliberately hiding it, but I hope I’m just overthinking. Through the screen, I would like to make a solemn request to the leader of the Sanders. I hope you can pay attention to this matter and give the innocent little boy who died an answer. I hope that your official authorities can give us a fair and just result. I hope that under your leadership, there is no unjust in Harken, only prosperity!”

When Monica finished, she took a bow.

The purpose was to prevent the Sanders from secretly tampering with the matter.

After all, all the officials were under the Sanders, such as the police, the court, and even the law.

It was not difficult for the Sanders to control anything!

Fortunately, Harken was a country where freedom of speech and human rights were paramount. Although it was ruled by the Sanders, they had to proritize the people. If they could not convince the people, it would cause turmoil. Once there was turmoil, the ruler might change. The Sanders would not dare to openly go against the people’s wishes.

Now that the matter had escalated to this point, they could force the Sanders to resolve the matter fairly.

At the very least, they would give the people a reasonable explanation.

Of course, Monica did not think of that series of actions, especially the last one. It was Jeanne who repeatedly reminded her to point out the Sanders so that they could not stand by and do nothing. She had to make them feel responsible

She did everything according to Jeannie’s instructions.

Monica straightened her back before she left in a domineering and carefree manner.

The moment all the reporters present came back to their senses, all they saw was Monica’s slender and strong back.
