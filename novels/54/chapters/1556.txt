Chapter 1557: Monica Gets Jealous

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn’s gaze was naturally on Monica, who was sitting in front of the high-class sofa and was elegantly eating a small snack. Beside her was a glass of warm water.

At that moment, the floor-to-ceiling window in the pantry allowed the setting sun to shine on Monica. It made it look like her body was enveloped in a ring of dazzling light, and her fair skin even softer and smoother. There was also a faint smile on her face.

Finn’s heart skipped a beat. For the first time, he felt that was what it meant to live a peaceful life.

They rested for nearly an hour, and after that, the other company had arranged some other visits for them. At 6 p.m., they were invited to dine at a high-class restaurant.

Since noon, Wendy had been very friendly toward Finn.

“Ms. Hansen,” the person in charge of the other company suddenly called out to Wendy.

“Yes, director,” Wendy hurriedly replied respectfully.

“Do you have a crush on our Mr. Jones?” The person in charge was joking. In fact, he was trying to liven up the atmosphere.

Sometimes, when they had talked too much about work, they would deliberately joke around to make the dinner table less serious.

Wendy blushed at her superior’s words and quickly denied, “No, I noticed Mr.

Jones didn’t eat much, so I was asking him about his food preferences.”

“You don’t usually ask us about our preferences?” Another senior executive also tried to liven up the atmosphere.

“Isn’t that because I know what you like?” Wendy was somewhat flustered and exasperated.

Sometimes in a room full of men, even on formal occasions, women would need to act coquettishly to liven things up.

“Look at how anxious you are.” The person in charge smiled. “I just wanted to tell Mr. Jones that Ms. Hansen is still single.”

“Mr. Jones might be married. Quit joking with me,” Wendy said shyly.

In fact, she was also echoing her boss by deliberately bringing up the topic that everyone loved — gossip about people’s relationships.

“Is Mr. Jones married?” the other company’s senior executive asked.

Finn glanced at Monica, who was eating her dinner with her head lowered. She seemed to be used to such social interactions.

He said, “Not yet. However-I‘

Before he could finish his sentence, the other company’s senior executive quickly said, “Ms. Hansen, the opportunity has come.”

The others also laughed along.

Finn had never attended such a business meeting before and did not need to entertain so many people when he was a doctor. However, seeing that the atmosphere at the dining table was lively, he kept quiet.

Monica drank her soup and did not say anything. On the other hand, Brandon, who was sitting beside him, was gloating.

“By the way, Director Cardellini, you will be staying in Casterbridge for a few more days, right? I’ve arranged some tourist attractions in Casterbridge to bring you around,” the person in charge asked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He diverted the topic from gossip.

“Thank you.” Monica did not reject him either.

In a business collaboration, apart from the cooperation of interests, customer relations were also very important. They had come all the way to Casterbridge, so of course, they had to accept the hospitality of the other company. Otherwise, they would be disrespecting the other party.

“You’re welcome. Since you’ve come all the way here to Casterbridge, it’s my duty to show you the local culture and customs of Casterbridge,” the other party hurriedly said.

Then, the two of them chatted warmly again.

The banquet lasted until 8 pm. As Monica was pregnant, the other party could not arrange for other events at night. Hence, after dinner, they personally sent them back.

Monica naturally sat in the car of the other company’s person in charge and brought Brandon along. Since Finn carried a ‘secretary’ status, it meant that he could only sit with Wendy in the car behind.

It was very quiet in the car. After interacting with Finn for a day, Wendy realized that Finn was a relatively quiet person.

Secretaries were supposed to be articulate, were they not? Could it be that Director Cardellini valued work ethics over anything else?

Wendy did not suspect anything. She had taken care of Finn because she was the host. However, when she heard him say that he was not married, she felt a little moved for some reason.

Finn was the kind of person that she did not think looked handsome when she first saw him.

He was a very ordinary-looking man with refined eyes. He was tall and looked well-mannered. Finn was not that outstanding compared to many other people in the business world, but after spending a day with him, she was inexplicably attracted to him..
