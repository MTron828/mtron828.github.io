Chapter 227: Jeanne Takes More Shares

In the study, Alexander was so angry that he wanted to beat Joshua to death.

If Joshua was not his only son, he would definitely chase him out of the house and let him die outside!

“How do you want to resolve the matter with Joshua?” After Jonathan lost his temper, his tone softened slightly as he asked Jeanne.

Obviously, the truth was out. The truth was that Joshua had instigated Adrian to frame Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “I can let it go.”

Alexander and Jenifer were a little surprised.

They did not think that Jeanne would let it go after being so wronged.

Jeanne was straightforward. “However, this matter has indeed had a great impact on me. If I hadn’t found the evidence, I would be in jail right now! That said, for Grandpa’s sake, I won’t send Joshua to jail, but I have to get what I deserve.”

“Go ahead.” Jonathan agreed.

“First, I need Joshua to apologize to me,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

“I’ll make Joshua do it even if you don’t bring that up.”

“Second, I want Dad to apologize to me.”

Jonathan glanced at Jeanne.

Alexander also looked at Jeanne fiercely.

“I’m very grateful that you stood up for me, Grandpa, but from the beginning to the end, I didn’t feel any guilt from Dad. He even said that he wanted to kick me out of the family... ” Jeanne chuckled.

“Your father misunderstood you, so of course, he should apologize.”

Alexander gritted his teeth.

He was already in a sorry state.

Jeanne was going too far!

Despite that, he had no choice but to lower his head to Jeanne because of Joshua, his unfilial son.

“Thirdly, I need the Lawrence Enterprise’s shares as compensation,” Jeanne said clearly.

Jonathan’s expression changed. “Jeanne, you know that this makes me feel that your motive is very strong.”

He was also warning Jeanne not to go too far.

“I’ve never concealed my motives,” Jeanne answered directly, “Seven years ago, I was chased out of the Lawrences by you guys, and my reputation was in tatters. Seven years later, I came back to clear my name!”

Jonathan looked at Jeanne coldly.

“I need honor, I need identity, and I need to be recognized by others. Having more of the enterprise’s shares is the most direct and effective way to prove my existence in the family!”

Jonathan was silent.

It seemed like he was thinking.

Jeanne was calmly waiting for his answer.

In fact, before Joshua completely disappointed Jonathan, Jonathan would not let the only descendant of the Lawrences go to prison just like that. Once Joshua went to prison, his future would be ruined.

After about ten minutes, Jonathan asked, “How much do you want this time?”

“Not much; the same as last time.” Jeanne smiled.

When she smiled, she looked very pretty.

Nevertheless, her smile seemed deadly to Alexander and Jenifer that became furious.

It was about shares again.

Jeanne must have come back to take over the Lawrences’ business!

“Okay.” Jonathan suddenly agreed.

He actually agreed.

Jeanne knew that it was easy to negotiate this time.

It was because the Lawrences had no choice.

They could either let Joshua go to jail, or they could choose to compromise with her.

Naturally, they would choose the latter.

“But one should take responsibility for one’s actions. Joshua should be the one to bear the responsibility for his mistakes. I can’t clean up the mess for everyone!” Alexander said fiercely.

Joshua lay on the ground, enduring the pain as he forced himself to get up. He said, “I don’t have shares.”

“It’s the father’s fault that his son is spoilt. You don’t, but your father does!”

Alexander’s face turned red. He could not help but say, “Dad, I only have 10% of the shares. What else will I have if I give them to Jeanne! You can’t condone her like this!”

“I’m not condoning Jeanne. It’s your son who’s useless! You can choose not to hand them over, but if you don’t, I won’t care about the matter of Joshua instigating others to commit a crime,” Jonathan said coldly.

Jeanne cleverly echoed, “I only listen to Grandpa. If Grandpa doesn’t care about this matter, I’ll still send Joshua to prison no matter how much shares you give me, Dad!”

“Jeanne!” Alexander gritted his teeth.

He had never been forced to this point.

“Dad, I believe you know very well what kind of personality I have now. Sometimes, I can be like you...” Jeanne said coldly, “Self-centered and not making allowances for my family!”

Alexander had never been so angry.

He did not expect that he would one day be so angry with his daughter.

As for Jeanne, she was still indifferent. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It was not that she had no feelings.

It was that she had no feelings for the Lawrences.

After learning about the cruel things that the Lawrences had done behind her back, she only had hatred for them.

A deep-rooted hatred.

“If you don’t agree to this, then forget it.” Jeanne did not seem to want to say anything more. “Let’s meet in court.”

“Dad, Dad, don’t!” Joshua was suddenly agitated.

He hurriedly crawled over and clung to Alexander, “Dad, I’m your only son. You can’t just abandon me like this. If I go to prison, who will carry on our family’s legacy? Dad, you can’t cut me off like that...”

“Get lost, you useless thing!” Alexander was mad. “The most regretful thing in my life was giving birth to a useless thing like you.”

“Dad, Dad... I know I’m wrong. I’ll change—I’ll change from now on.”

Alexander still did not agree to it.

Of course, he would not agree to it so easily.

He had gone through so much effort to get only 10% of the shares, and now he was going to give half of them away.

After giving them away, Jeanne would be the largest shareholder other than Jonathan.

If news got out, how would Alexander be able to gain a foothold in the enterprise in the future?

Jenifer could also see Alexander’s hesitation. At this moment, she was also afraid that he would refuse. After all, she knew very well how much Alexander valued his shares. He might be angry and…

No.

Jenifer could not let his son go to jail.

She quickly went forward and said, pulling Alexander’s arm, trying to please him. “Alex, we’re all family. It doesn’t matter who holds the shares, right?”

Alexander fiercely glanced at Jenifer and abruptly pushed her away.

He was very strong.

Jenifer was instantly thrown to the ground.

In all these years, she had always tried to curry favor with Alexander. She had never been treated like this before.

That said, she also knew that this was not the time to be calculative. She cried and said, “It’s all my fault. I didn’t educate Joshua well. It’s my fault, but Joshua is still young; he’s only 23 years old. If he goes to prison, how will he be able to live in the future? It would be better for me and Joshua to die together. It would also leave the Lawrences with a clean slate...”

Joshua also started to cry. “It’s my fault. If Dad doesn’t forgive me, I’ll... I’ll die to atone for my sins...”

“Enough!” Alexander roared. He glared fiercely at Jeanne. “I’ll give you my shares!”

Jenifer and Joshua secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Jeanne smiled at Alexander, “Thank You, Dad.”

“How can I guarantee that you won’t let Joshua go to jail after I give you the shares?!” Alexander said fiercely, “If I remember correctly, the last time you took 5% of our shares, you didn’t marry Thedus in the end!”

“I didn’t marry him,” Jeanne admitted and asked, “but wasn’t the result what you wanted?”

Alexander frowned.

“The 300 million dollars of financing from the Lockes were provided by Swanhaven Bank. The Lockes wanted to cooperate with MUK, but now the Lawrences are doing it. The marriage between the two families would’ve promoted the growth of the stock market, but the shares for the Lawrences are booming now. Aren’t all these what you want? What does it have to do with me marrying him or not? Could it be that you’re still unhappy?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

At that moment, Alexander was speechless.

Jeanne said, “Besides, you don’t have the right to negotiate with me now. If you’re willing to take out your shares to protect Joshua, do; if you’re not willing, then I won’t force you. After all, the shares won’t benefit me much other than being able to prove my existence in the Lawrences. 5% of the shares have a market value of around 900 million dollars only. That’s nothing to me.”

Alexander was obviously mocked by Jeanne.

Even if it was something that was very precious to them, it was nothing to Jeanne.

Alexander’s expression was extremely cold.

Jeanne was calm.

Jonathan said, “If you still don’t trust Jeanne at this point, I don’t think you need to give the shares anymore!”

At this moment, he felt that he had to beg Jeanne to take his shares instead.

Since when did Jeanne become so powerful?

She was so powerful that he felt that he was useless!
