Chapter 1541: You Still Can ‘t Let Go of Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Or their love would always be one step behind others.

From the first time they broke up, they had missed the chance to be together.

“Finn, it’s really hard for me to convince myself to be with you.” Monica decided to have a good talk with him again.

“I know.” He knew that Monica had decided on her attitude toward him.

He did not expect that Monica would really give up on him. When the two of them were together, her heart was as still as water.

“So, let’s not make things difficult for each other, okay?”

“I’ve always thought that I was a cold person. I could pick up and let go of my feelings for anyone. I would never be hurt. Even if I was hurt, I could quickly close myself up and readjust myself quickly. I wouldn’t be defeated or be in unbearable pain.” Finn looked at Monica deeply. “But now, I realize that I can’t get over you. I don’t even dare to think about you leaving me forever.”

“Time can heal everything.” Monica said, “I used to think that I loved you very much too. However, at this moment, I’ve really let go. If I can do it, you can do it too.”

“I can’t—I‘

“I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Monica interrupted Finn.

There was nothing to talk about between them since Finn would not be convinced by her. In fact, she had never had any control over Finn. Regardless of whether they were together or not, she would always be the one to compromise between them, and he would not be influenced by her.

Just like that, Finn swallowed the words he was about to say. Right now, it seemed like nothing he said would work. Even if he wanted to dig out his heart to show it to her, it seemed to be useless.

Time passed, minute by minute, until one hour later. They just sat there quietly and did not say a word, like two familiar strangers.

Then, a reminder came from the dryer. Finn stood up and walked into the laundry room. Monica’s eyes flickered, but she still looked indifferent.

Once Finn took out her clothes, Monica walked into Paige’s room and changed. After she changed, she saw Finn waiting for her at the door. It was obvious that he wanted to send her home.

“There’s no need. Paige is alone at home. I’ll be worried if she wakes up in the middle of the night.”

“No, Paige sleeps very well and never wakes up in the middle of the night.”

“What if she wakes up?” Monica questioned.

“If she wakes up, Paige will know to call me. She’s smarter than her peers.”

“But she’s only three years old. Isn’t it common on the news that three-year-old children get into trouble at home alone?”

“On television, aren’t there many news about women getting into trouble on the streets alone in the middle of the night?” Finn asked. “Brandon will pick me up,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn held back the words he wanted to say.

Therefore, she had already sent someone to pick her up. Monica was no longer the woman who only knew how to act on impulse. She had become mature, not giving anyone the chance to take advantage of the situation.

The two of them were silent for two seconds before there was a knock on the door. Since it was late, it was clear that Brandon had come.

Monica did not hesitate or was reluctant to leave. She directly opened the door.

“Have you decided to be with him?” Finn asked her.

“If I had to choose between you and him, I would choose him.”

It meant that if he continued to pursue her, she would choose to be with Brandon.

Finn pursed his lips tightly and watched as Monica opened the door. Brandon was indeed at the door, and he smiled at Monica, who also smiled at him.

“Let’s go.” Brandon did not even look at Finn. His eyes fixed on Monica.

Monica followed Brandon away and left. She did not even turn around to look at him. If she looked back, she might have noticed the redness in his eyes.

In reality, even if Monica saw it, she would feel nothing. She would not choose to stay because of his discomfort.

Brandon drove Monica back. As Monica was pregnant, she sat in the backseat.

The two of them were silent. It was a little late now, and she seemed to be a little sleepy.

“Why were you at Finn’s place?” Brandon broke the silence between them..Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
