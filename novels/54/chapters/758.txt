Chapter 759: The Upper-Class Banquet, the Conspiracy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was not easy for her to get up. Yet, she still had to dress herself up and choose an evening gown.

If she did not know that Jeannie was there, she would die.

Her father had something to do at work, so they were late to the banquet. If they were not late and she had to keep her fake smile with her father the whole night, she would go crazy. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She used the excuse of going to the toilet and left her father’s side. Then, without a second thought, she went to Jeanne.

At that moment, Jeanne was accompanying Edward in his social activities.

Edward’s reputation in South Harken City was very high. Even in a gathering of so many upper-class people, Edward was an existence that could not be ignored. Therefore, people kept approaching him to propose a toast, and Jeanne was a little bored from entertaining them.

Seeing Monica coming over, she found an excuse to leave Edward and went to the back garden with Monica to get some fresh air.

As soon as they arrived at the back garden, Monica sat on the swing, took off her high heels, and threw them on the ground without any care for her image.

Jeanne was also somewhat helpless against Monica as she sat next to the latter, looking much more dignified than her.

“Jeanne, can you stop looking so good?” Monica complained.

‘What’s wrong with this girl?’ Jeanne thought.

“Every time I attend a banquet, I think you’re much more beautiful than before. Is it Fourth Master Swan’s presence that makes you shine?” Monica blurted out.

Jeanne was speechless.

“You may not know, but at least 80 percent of the people at the banquet are talking about your godly looks. You’re making me look like a peasant by your side.” Monica was unhappy.

Jeanne smiled.

Had Monica not been dying of sadness recently? How could she still have the energy to compare her looks? It seemed that this girl was much stronger than Jeanne had thought.

“Although I’m not happy that my best friend is much prettier than me, I’m secretly happy because Eden’s face has been dark from the beginning to the end. After all, everyone’s praise for you and Fourth Master Swan is a form of hurt to him. He cheated on you back then, and he was the one who was stupid enough to lose you. I’m sure you saw he didn’t bring Jasmine with him today. Well, I think it’s because he’s disgusted with Jasmine. Speaking of which, I haven’t seen Jasmine act up in a long time. Has she turned over a new leaf?”

Jeanne admired Monica’s quick thinking.

She would always be led astray by Monica when she spoke to her.

Before Jeanne could say anything, Monica concluded, “Maybe Eden is tired of Jasmine. A disgusting man like Eden must have wanted to get rid of Jasmine a long time ago when he saw how beautiful you were and how useless Jasmine was compared to you.”

Jeanne believed that if Monica focused more on her work, she might be able to make some groundbreaking achievements.

After all, when it came to gossip, Monica had never been wrong.

“Oh, right. Do you know William’s background?” Monica suddenly mentioned the host of the day.

“Do you?”

“When I was on the way to the banquet just now, I heard my dad talking about him in the car. Apparently, this person is very powerful. On the surface, he’s an antique collector, but he has a very strong and secret network of connections not just in Harken.”

“I’ve heard of it.” Jeanne nodded.

“It’s no wonder the Sanders are so friendly to him. All three of them came to attend his banquet.”

Jeanne did not say much to Monica, who was just purely gossiping and nothing would come out of that.

However, the same Jeanne was not. She had many things to consider, and the walls had ears. The more she said, the more something could be used against her.

The two of them casually chatted for a while before Edward came out to look for Jeanne. He said he was going to socialize with the Sanders.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

To be honest, she did not want to go.

Throughout the entire banquet, many people were surrounding Edward and the Sanders, so they did not have time to socialize. However, Jeanne had expected it too, and there was no way she could miss it.

In the eyes of outsiders, the Sanders and the Swans were now the two giants of Harken — one managed the political scene, while the other controlled the economy.

The outside world was also abuzz with rumors that the two families had a deep conflict.

After all, Harken was under the Swans’ regime, but the Swans had their fair share of power in the country.

Even so, only one of them could hold the power in the country, and there would be a day when the two families would kill each other.

However, before killing each other, they still had to pretend to be friendly.
