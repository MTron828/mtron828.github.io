The next day, when Shelly woke up, it was already noon. Usually, she would wake up naturally at 7

a.m., even without an alarm clock. However, this morning, even the alarm clock could not wake her up. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When she turned around and saw the time, it was already 12 p.m. She quickly got out of bed and looked at the alarm clock on her phone. It was obvious that it had been turned off.

With gritted her teeth, she lifted the blanket and walked out of the room to see Nox in the kitchen. It was rare to see that he was not at work, much less in the kitchen, which was in a mess. Shelly just stared at Nox and saw how flustered he was.

When Nox noticed that Shelly was up, he quickly said, “We can have lunch soon.”

Shelly gulped and said, “Why was I still asleep?”

“You were drunk last night.”

“Did you turn off the alarm for me?”

“A drunk person needs enough sleep. Do you feel much better now that you’re awake?” Nox answered calmly.

“I’ve sent her to kindergarten.”

“What did she have for breakfast?”

“I took her out to get some buns. She ate two buns and had a hot chocolate.”

Shelly pursed her lips, not knowing what else to say about Nox helping her with everything. Even his appearance in the kitchen right now warmed her heart, despite it being in a mess.

Shelly said, “I’ll go wash up first.”

“Alright.” Nox replied, “There’s no rush. Lunch will only be ready in a while. You can even take a shower. ”

Shelly nodded. She really wanted to take a shower. She could not even remember how she got into bed last night. All she could remember was when she finally got home and nothing after that. However, it was obvious that she did not shower because the discomfort on her body was obvious.

Except… did Nox help her change into her clothes? It was not that she felt shy, but she did not think it was something Nox would do. According to Nox’s personality, he should have ignored her.

As Shelly walked into the bathroom to take a shower, she had to admit that drunk people really needed enough sleep. Now that she had woken up, although her stomach was empty, she felt much better. If she had been forced to wake up in the morning, she might be living a life worse than death.

She thought to herself as she showered and silently felt that Nox had really changed. After showering, she brushed her teeth and washed her face, which instantly refreshed her. Then, she dried her hair and walked out of the bedroom.

In the dining room, Nox had placed the lunch on the dining table. Shelly was stunned to see that he had cooked a full meal with appetizers. Although they were all very simple dishes, she never thought Nox could cook.

“This is my first time making it, so I don’t know how it tastes.” Nox looked at the dishes expectantly.

Shelly picked up her utensils and put a piece of Iamb in her mouth. Just as she started chewing, she frowned.

“Does it taste bad?” Nox asked.

“No.” Shelly quickly replied, “I thought it wouldn’t taste good, but it tastes okay.”

Nox was confused.

“Try it yourself, and you’ll know,” Shelly said bluntly.

What Nox did not tell her he was almost full from taste-testing while cooking that lunch. He was afraid that it would not taste good and that it would not be seasoned well. After all, he did mix up salt and sugar. When he tasted the dishes, he began to doubt his life and questioned whether he was cut out for cooking.

He even wanted to give up several times, but he persevered in the end. He really wanted to fulfill his promise to help her cook, wash clothes, and take care of the children after being with her for so long. Even if he did it once, it would leave the relationship with no regrets.

Shelly was really surprised by Nox’s cooking. She had never thought that it would taste so good. She did not know if it was because she was really hungry or something else, but she ate everything until she was full.

Nox did not expect Shelly to like his food so much, so he was in a good mood. He started to show off. “I didn’t realize I was so talented.”

Shelly glanced at Nox and smiled.

“You might even become a super chef in the future.”

Nox was a typical CEO who would be walking on air with just a small compliment. What kind of bad
