Chapter 840 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

Finn, Nox, and Edward finished their training in one piece, and none of them gave up halfway. They persisted.

Until now.

It seemed like they were finally going to put their life’s work to use.

The war was about to start.

After breakfast, Finn returned to Edward’s room to check on his body. After confirming that nothing unusual would happen, he prepared to leave Bamboo Garden to pack his things.

Nox did not need to go back. He could just get his servants to send his things over.

Finn walked out of the hall quickly.

He did not want to waste too much time.

In medicine, there were too many unexpected incidents where a person’s life could be taken away in just a few seconds.

Finn had just reached the entrance of the hall when he suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Monica looked at Finn, and she also paused.

She did not think that Finn would be here.

‘Yesterday, the day before… Yes, didn’t he go to the airport with Nox the day before?

‘They seemed to have left South Hampton City.

‘He returned so quickly.

‘Could it be that they had gone to look for the missing Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne?

‘So, did they find them?

‘Is Jeanne back?’

At the thought of this, Monica was a little excited. She hurriedly asked, “Is Jeanne back? ”

Finn looked at her.

He was still as cold as ever.

At this moment, his eyes seemed to move as if he was looking at Monica’s wrist, but it also seemed to be an illusion.

Monica still hid her bandaged wrist in the sleeve of her windbreaker.

She did not want Finn to know.

Even if he knew, he was still indifferent.

She asked, “Is Jeannie back?”

Compared to the emotional outburst just now, she was much calmer now.

It was because she did not want Finn to see her being so rash.

She tried her best to meet and talk to Finn in the calmest way possible.

Finn still did not answer her.

He walked past her coldly.

Monica froze at the door for a long time.

Perhaps she still had some feelings for him.

She thought that she and Finn might not even be able to be strangers, let alone friends.

When strangers met, they would still greet each other out of courtesy.

However, they could not.

Finn’s loathing for her had reached the point where he felt that just looking at her would dirty his eyes.

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

At this moment, she heard Nox calling her.

Nox walked down from the second floor. Seeing that Monica was obviously angry, he asked in a bad tone, “What are you doing here?”

Of course, Monica could also feel that Nox did not welcome her.

Even so, she could pretend that she did not know.

She took a deep breath to make herself look natural. “I’m here to see George.”

“Why are you looking for George?” Nox was baffled.

“It’s none of your business,”

“Monica, you still don’t know your place, do you? You’ve been removed from our list, so how can you still have the face to come here?” Nox mocked.

“I’m thick-skinned.” Monica did not seem to care.

‘F*ck.’

Nox was infuriated.

He was a little speechless.

Monica did not pay much attention to Nox. She directly walked past him and went up to the second floor.

The moment she went up, she could not help but turn around and ask Nox, “Is Jeannie back?”

“No.” Nox got angry when he said, “She won’t be coming back in the future. She’s just like you, an ingrate.”

Monica frowned.

Nox did not want to waste any more time with Monica.

He went straight downstairs.

Monica endured it and did not ask further. She went upstairs to find George.

When he went to George’s room, George was not there. She could not help but knock on the door of Edward and Jeanne’s room. Teddy opened the door and was a little surprised to see Monica. “Miss Cardellini, who are you looking for?”

“I’m looking for George,” Monica said directly.

“He’s asleep now.”

“What?” Monica frowned.

‘He sleeps more than me?

‘It’s 11:00 am.’

“He didn’t sleep well last night. If you have something urgent to tell him, I’ll wake him up,” Teddy quickly said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“No need, no need. I’ll just wait for him. It’s not an urgent matter.” Monica glanced into the room.

She watched as George slept next to Fourth Master Swan.

The scene was a little strange.

Speaking of which, Monica really did not see Jeanne.

‘Where did Jeanne go?’

She could not help but ask again, “Is Jeanne not around?”

“Madam isn’t back.” Teddy did not hide anything. “It was Dr. Jones and Young Master Winter who carried Fourth Master back last night. Madam didn’t return with them.”
