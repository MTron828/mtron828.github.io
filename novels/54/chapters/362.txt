Chapter 363: Honeymoon: I Love You, Jeanne

“I’m pissed.”

Edward looked at her and smiled faintly.

It was obvious that he was doting on Jeanne and did not care about Jeanne’s emotions at all.

“Do you know what day it is for George today?” Jeanne asked angrily.

Edward frowned.

He remembered George’s birthday very clearly.

“Today is George’s school sports day! It was supposed to be my first time participating in the parent-child sports day, but I was absent!” Jeanne was furious.

She was really fuming.

George had been with her since he was a baby. Although she would leave him when she received a mission, she would never leave without saying a word.

However, what she did this time was no different than abandoning him.

Edward said, “I promise you won’t be absent next time.”

“Next time? Who knows when the next time will be?”

“If you want, we can go back,” Edward promised her.

......

However, Jeanne simply glared at him.

“You know I have some power in South Hampton City...” There was clearly a smug look on her face.

Jeanne was furious. She turned around and was about to leave when somebody suddenly pulled her into an embrace.

Jeanne resisted, but Edward hugged her even tighter, rendering her resistance useless.

She looked at Edward fiercely.

“Compared to George, I’m more afraid of being abandoned by you,” Edward whispered in her ear.

His voice was low, but it seemed he did not say it to flatter her. In fact, it was his true thoughts.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat. It was very easy to be moved by his words.

He said, “I love you, Jeanne.”

Jeanne’s heart started to pound against her chest.

The confession caught her off guard…

Previously, when she was about to leave Harken for good, Edward had also told her that he liked her.

However, every time she heard him say those three words, she would be emotionally moved because she thought a person like Edward would not like or talk about love at any time.

She was silent, and in silence, she could only feel her heartbeat accelerating. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Sir, Madam.” In the hall, a middle-aged woman suddenly appeared and greeted them in English.

Stunned, Jeanne quickly pushed Edward away.

Edward did not force her either.

However, every time he saw her flushed face, he would be in a good mood for some reason.

“It’s time to eat,” the middle-aged woman said respectfully.

“Let’s eat.” Edward held her hand and walked toward the dining hall calmly.

He was the one who confessed, but why was she the one who felt uncomfortable instead?

She composed herself and sat at the dining table with Edward.

The middle-aged woman stood beside them and said respectfully, “Mr. and Mrs. Swan, thank you very much for coming to Balti Islands. We’re happy that you have chosen our hotel, the Balti Villa. I’m Dale, the housekeeper of this villa, and I am here to serve you. This is the only villa on this small island. During your stay, no one will be allowed to set foot here without your permission. I will also leave after I’m done with my work. I won’t disturb your honeymoon trip.”

The two of them listened to Dale’s introduction as they ate.

“I’ll be in this villa at 9 a.m., 11 p.m., and 5 p.m. every day. If you have any special requests, I can come back to serve you at the time you specify.”

“Thank you,” Edward responded.

“In that case, I won’t disturb your meal,” Dale said respectfully before she continued, “I wish you a happy marriage.”

After saying that, she left.

Jeanne looked at the woman’s back and then turned back to eat her steak.

What Dale meant was that Jeanne would be spending a week alone with Edward on the island, where no one else was around.

Her heart started to race again, and she pursed her lips. At the thought that they had left George at home, she felt numb.

“We’ll go out to sea tomorrow.” During the meal, Edward suddenly spoke.

Jeanne raised her head.

“Once you’re awake, we’ll go out to sea on a speedboat tomorrow. We’ll have some fun at sea.”

Jeanne ignored him, thinking, ‘Who wants to go with you?’

However, she had to say that she was looking forward to it. It had been a long time since she had such a relaxing time.

In the past, in order to survive and become stronger, she had always suppressed her needs and worked hard.

Actually… No, she would never say it.

She continued to eat her dinner quietly.

“Right.” Edward suddenly thought of something.

Jeanne frowned. When did the man have so much to say?

Edward asked, “Do you want to have children?”

“Ahem.” Jeanne almost choked to death from his words.

Edward passed her a glass of cold water.

Jeanne took a sip, and it took a while for her to calm down before she said, “I don’t want to.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded and did not forget to remind her at that moment. “I didn’t use protection on the night of the wedding.”

“...”

“I forgot to ask for your opinion,” he said with an apologetic tone.

Jeanne thought, ‘Did you really forget, or was it never on your mind?’

However, she said, “It’s alright. We should be safe that day.”

Logically speaking, she should not be pregnant.

“I will pay special attention to it next time,” Edward promised.

Next time…

Jeanne’s face was slightly red.

After the two of them had dinner, Edward said, “Why don’t we go out for a walk?”

“I want to sleep,” Jeanne blurted out.

It was because she was really too tired and wanted to get some rest earlier.

However, she could see the change in expression on Edward’s face.

What was Edward, that beast, thinking about now?!
