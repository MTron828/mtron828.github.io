Chapter 1690: Nox Helps Shelly To Find Bella

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox calmed his breathing and endured it.

He said, “The doctor said you fainted because you were too tired. It’s nothing serious. If you want to be hospitalized, you can stay for two more days; I’ve paid for it. But if you don’t want to stay, you can be discharged. I’ll head off now.”

Jeanne said he had to learn not to pester Shelly, which meant he should leave after finishing the matter so that Shelly would not find him annoying.

Today, he was just going to deliver the flowers and then leave. He had never thought of pestering her, and naturally, it was the same at that moment.

Just as he turned around and was about to leave, Shelly suddenly called out to him, “Nox.”

Nox’s body tensed up, and he told himself not to get excited.

He had to make himself look like he did not care as he turned around. “Is there anything else?”

“Do you still want to be with me?” Shelly suddenly asked him seriously.

Nox was stunned. Did Shelly wake up on the right side of the bed? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“If I agree to be with you, can you help me find Bella?” Shelly asked him calmly.

However, deep down, she was trying his best to control herself from breaking down and not thinking about the pain of having Bella taken away from her.

Nox was confused again. What the hell was Shelly talking about?

“My sister has sold Bella, and I don’t know where she is now. I called the police, but they told me to go home and wait for the news. I don’t know how long I can wait, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to wait for Bella to return.” “Speak clearly!” Nox became serious.

Shelly looked at Nox. In the end, she explained everything to him

Nox gritted his teeth. He could not believe such irresponsible parents existed in this world. He thought he was unreliable, but they were people worse than him!

“Help me find Bella, and I’ll be with you again,” Shelly repeated.

She knew nothing came for free. If she wanted Nox to help her, she had to make a deal with him.

She had nothing to trade with Nox, who already had everything he wanted. However, Nox was currently pursuing her. Regardless of whether he liked her or what would happen in the future, as long as she could find Bella again, she was willing to die, let alone be with Nox. After all, what more would a person who was unafraid of death care about?

Nox stared at Shelly. Then, without giving her an answer, he turned around and left the ward. After he left, he started to make phone calls and give instructions before personally joining the search for Bella.

He did not know too much about the relationship between Bella and Shelly. All he knew was that for Bella, Shelly was willing to throw away her studies, become a single mother that was looked down upon by others, and live such a hard life. Worse, she was willing to agree to be together with him for Bella’s sake.

He knew very well how much Shelly hated him, yet she was willing to give up everything for Bella. Based on that fact alone, he could not fathom how important Bella was to Shelly.

After Nox left for a week, the police still did not have any concrete information. Coupled with the fact that Nox did not give her any promises or reply, Shelly was in despair.

Harken was huge. Where on earth was she going to find Bella? Bella might even have been taken overseas… Anything was possible.

She looked at her phone, where Nox’s number was displayed on the screen. Her only hope was still Nox. If Nox could not do it, he could ask the Leader to do it for him.

In fact, she had a feeling that Nox could do it if he were willing to help her, but what reason did he have to help her?

Perhaps he was just unsatisfied with not having had her and only wanted her because he could not get her. Once he got her, he lost interest. What could she expect from Nox?

With that thought in mind, she quietly put down her phone and decided to make another trip to the police station.

She had just opened the door when she suddenly saw a man in front of her. Shelly’s eyes flickered as she stared at Nox, who looked weak and dirty.

“Nox-” Before she could speak, she saw Bella walk out from behind Nox.

Upon seeing Bella’s dirty appearance, she was shocked. However, it was the Bella whom she thought she would never see again.

The moment Bella saw her, her tears instantly flowed out. “Mommy…Mom…”

Shelly thought she was hallucinating. For the entire week, it felt to her as if Bella had never left her side the entire time. Hence, she did not dare to believe that it was real.

Then, she looked at Bella, who was crying as she hugged Shelly’s calf. The real touch made Shelly’s heart tighten and made Shelly realize that it was not an illusion.

Shelly slowly squatted down and hugged Bella tightly in her arms. The two of them were in tears.

Meanwhile, from the side, Nox watched as Shelly sobbed. He could not believe that, after much effort, he finally found Bella.

Then, he suddenly felt his vision go dark, and he fell to the ground. As expected, he would faint if he was exhausted to the bone.

He had initially despised Shelly for overworking herself, but now that he finally experienced it, all he wanted was to sleep peacefully for a day and a night!
