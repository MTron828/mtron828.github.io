947 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

She arrived at the hospital about half an hour later and rushed to Finn’s office from the parking garage.

She really did not dare to be impolite to the people she could not afford to offend.

This time, she was very well-mannered and knocked on Finn’s office door.

However, the door was not closed.

Finn was dealing with his work with his head lowered. When he heard the sound, he said without even raising his head. “Come in.”

Monica walked in and then slowly sat down opposite him.

Finn put down the fountain pen wrapped in gold in his hand. The moment he raised his head, he paused for a moment.

Monica sat up straight.

Finn’s eyes flickered as he said, “I’ve connected to the source of your father’s heart attack.”

“Thank you,” Monica said gratefully. “But do we have to do the transplant? My dad is already 50 years old. Can he take such a big risk with surgery?”

“I’ll assess the risk based on your father’s condition, and I won’t perform the surgery rashly,” Finn answered Monica’s doubts. “I called you over today not to get you to sign the consent form for the surgery immediately, but I just wanted to tell you that your father’s recovery in the past two days hasn’t been optimistic. His heart can no longer support his normal needs, so you’d better be mentally prepared.

Monica nodded silently.

She had never thought that her father, who had always protected her, would one day collapse.

“On top of that, I need to tell you in advance that if your father wants to do a heart transplant, the medical standards of heart transplant surgery in Harken are not great. This is extremely dangerous, and I have never really done this kind of surgery in my clinical practice. Of course, there are domestic experts. I can ask them to come over and help your father with this operation. But at the end of the day, the medical standards in the country are still limited, so I will suggest finding an international expert to help your dad with this surgery.”

“If it really comes to this, please help me contact the international experts,” Monica quickly replied.

Finn nodded. That was the first consensus he had reached with Monica.

“Secondly, the cost of a heart transplant is quite expensive, especially when you need to invite international experts to help you with the surgery. Coupled with rehabilitation treatment later, you’d better be mentally prepared for the money.

“Money is not a problem,” Monica quickly said.

Monica had never felt that money could be a threat to her.

“Finally, after the heart transplant surgery is successful, your father will need at least a year to recover. This means that he won’t be able to deal with work-related matters for a year.” Finn said, “You better be clear about this.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Finn was reminding her that she would be in charge of all the work in Cardellini Enterprise for a long time.

Monica smiled. “All I hope for is for my father to live now. Other things are not a problem.”

Finn nodded.

Then, he said, “That’s about all the matters related to the surgery. Because we’re not completely sure that your father will do this surgery, I won’t go into the specific details and precautions for the time being.”

“Alright.” Monica hurriedly nodded.

Anyway, she would listen to Finn on everything.

After that, she stood up from her chair, thanked him, and turned to leave.

Monica thought that Finn did not want to have too much to do with her after he explained the situation to her. Hence, she immediately left after he finished and did not notice whether he have any reaction.

In fact, she did not dare to have any expectations of Finn. Or rather, she was becoming more and more aware of her own limitations.

She knew very well what kind of person Finn thought of her

She would try to stay away from him as she did not want to add to his troubles.

After she left Finn’s office, she went straight to his father’s ward.

There was a light in the ward, but the people inside were probably asleep.

It was now past 10 p.m. at night.

She walked in quietly, trying not to disturb them. However, just as she walked in and before she could reach her father’s bedside…

“Monica, you’re here.” In the dark room, Ruby called out to her softly.

“Mom, did I wake you up?” Monica felt a little guilty.

“No, I didn’t really sleep.”
