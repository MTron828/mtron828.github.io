Thank you readers!

The moment Monica opened the car door and got out of the car, Finn also got out.

“Finn, enough is enough.” Monica was still as aversive and indifferent toward him as before.

“I don’t feel comfortable with you living alone,” Finn said bluntly. Monica looked at Finn coldly. “So you plan to move in with me?”

“If possible—”

“You can’t.”

Finn pursed his lips and said, “I’ll help you pack your things and go to your parents’ house.”

“I won’t go. I won’t tell them I’m pregnant for the time being,” Monica replied.

She was giving herself a way out.

Finn fell silent. “And I hope you won’t tell them.”

Finn looked at her.

“If you tell them, I’ll choose not to go ahead with this pregnancy.” Monica said coldly, “You should know that if I’m forced to a corner, I will do anything.” Finn’s throat moved slightly, and he nodded.

Monica did not waste her breath saying anything else. She simply turned around and walked straight into the neighborhood.

Finn looked at Monica’s slender back.

He was actually not confident that he could woo her back in one month.

In Bamboo Garden, Candice stayed at home with Paige almost every day, and Paige lived a routine life at home.

While she was sitting on the ground watching cartoons, she suddenly pointed at the amusement park in the cartoon and said, “Mom, I want to go on the Ferris wheel too.”

At that moment, Candice was reading a book. She, too, would get bored and had to do something to kill time. Hence, when she heard Paige’s voice, she glanced up.

“I want to ride that carousel, the buggy, and the roller coaster…” Paige said excitedly.

“Have you been on those rides before?” Candice asked casually.

“No, I haven’t.” Disappointment filled Paige’s little face. “Daddy is very busy. He doesn’t have time to go out with me.”

Candice looked at Paige and felt her heart ache.

Edward was probably not just busy. It was also because he was very protective of Paige. After all, Jeanne had died giving birth to that child, so Edward treated Paige differently.

“Mom, can you take me there?” Paige looked at her expectantly.

Candice hesitated. After all, Edward was unwilling to bring Paige out of the house. In case anything happened to Paige… she would not be able to atone for her sins even if it cost her her life.

“Mommy.”

Seemingly having noticed Candice’s hesitation, Paige threw herself into Candice’s arms and started acting cute.

Candice had never been able to say no to Paige, so she said, “I’ll discuss it with your father, okay?”

“Alright.” Paige nodded obediently.

Her big eyes were filled with anticipation.

With that, Candice took out her phone and called Edward.

In fact, she did not call Edward often because she knew that he was very busy and she did not want to disturb him. However, every time she called him, he would definitely pick up the call immediately. It inexplicably warmed her heart.

“Candice.”

“Edward, I have something to discuss with you.” “Tell me.”

“Paige wants to go to the amusement park.”

The other part fell silent.

Candice knew that Edward would not agree so easily. However, when she saw

Paige’s big black eyes filled with anticipation, she still could not bear to say no.

She added, “Paige should be exposed to the outside world. She can’t always grow up at home. It’s not good for her physical and mental development.”

Edward hesitated, but at that moment, he still agreed. He said, “Wait a moment. I’ll get someone to pick you up.”

“Alright.” A surprised smile appeared on Candice’s face as she was not at all confident that Edward would let them out. She put down the phone and picked up Paige. “Your father said yes!”

She was clearly happier than Paige.

Paige hugged Candice’s neck tightly and said in a soft, excited voice, “Mommy, you’re the best. I love you the most. I can finally go to the amusement park with you. I’m the happiest child in the world…’

Paige was such a sweet talker, which was a stark contrast to George.

At the thought of George, Candice’s heart ached again.

“Mommy,” Paige called out to Candice when she sensed that Candice was lost

“Let’s get ready. Your dad will get someone to pick us up later.” Candice smiled. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright.”

Candice carried Paige upstairs.

Although Paige was only three years old, she already knew what she wanted to wear, and her closet was full of clothes.

She pointed at a pink princess dress, a pair of pink princess shoes, and a small pink crown. “Mommy, I want to wear this..”
