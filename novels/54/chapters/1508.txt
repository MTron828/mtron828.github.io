Chapter 1509: Chloe’s End: True Colors Revealed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Minister Nicholson, don’t you know everything?” Edward ignored Claire and turned to look at Wyatt.

Wyatt’s expression sank. He even felt a little ashamed.

Back then, in order to protect Chloe, he had indeed hidden the truth. After all, he was selfish. Having lost a daughter, he could not lose a second one. Therefore, the moment the truth came out, he used his power to hide all of it and turned the incident during Candice’s drill into an accident.

To keep the real reason a secret, he did not tell anyone — not even Claire — nor did he expose Chloe. However, because his impression of Chloe was ruined and he could not get over it, he could not bring himself to treat Chloe too well. Even so, his selfishness made him keep it a secret.

Candice looked at her father’s expression and sneered. That was why, in everyone’s eyes, her father treated her the best. Yet, when faced with a choice, he would selfishly choose to protect Chloe and let others misunderstand that she was the one who made a mistake and ended up in the accident.

She remembered seeing the news back then. Most of the people in the news felt sorry for her, but there were still some haters who said her skills were not up to standard and that she was just being flattered. Some said she was too proud and complacent because she was famous at a young age…

In any case, her reputation was partly affected because of that incident, but her father still chose to protect his other daughter.

From a rational standpoint, what her father did was understandable. Back then, she was so severely injured that nobody knew if she would wake up and he was afraid of losing his second daughter.

However, emotionally, even though she had no recollection of what she had gone through in the past and did not seem to feel much about it, she still felt a little angry. Even an outsider would probably stand up for Candice. It was simply unfair!

“Minister Nicholson.” Edward did not get an answer, so he called out to him again.

Wyatt had been holding his emotions back for a long time. At that moment, he finally nodded heavily. “Yes, it’s true that I covered up all the truth.”

“No, Dad. I didn’t do it. Don’t listen to that nonsense. How could I harm my sister? How could I harm her? Don’t think of me as such a bad person. I’m not that bad-”

“Enough!” Wyatt roared.” If I had known that you were so unrepentant, I wouldn’t have covered up everything. I should’ve exposed you!”

“Dad, I really didn’t do it. Someone must have wrongly accused me. You have to believe me…” Chloe refused to admit it.

Wyatt’s expression turned even uglier. “You still won’t admit it at this point!

The hospital found sleeping pills in the juice you gave your sister back then!” Shocked, Chloe could not say a word for a long time.

“I saw you give that glass of juice to Candice with my own eyes. Do you think I’m blind?” Wyatt said fiercely.

“I didn’t make that juice myself. Someone must’ve framed me on purpose.

Someone must be jealous of my sister’s talent, so they deliberately framed me. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That must be the case—”

“Chloe, how many more lies can you tell? You said you made the glass of juice yourself back then, and now you’re saying it was someone else who made it? If you insist on that, I’ll take out the evidence and hand it over to the court for judgment! ” Wyatt was so angry that his body was trembling.

He did not expect his daughter to be so cruel. It was as if he had accepted that his own daughter would be so vicious.

“No, you can’t!” Chloe panicked. “Dad, you can’t do this. You can’t!” By saying that, she had tacitly agreed to have plotted against Candice back then.

At that moment, Chloe broke down and fell to the ground. She thought no one else knew about it, but now it seemed that the whole world knew.

In that case, was her usual act of pretending to be kind, cute, and innocent not a slap in her face? Was she not like a clown to them?

Feeling ashamed from being exposed, she lay on the ground with a hideous expression and looked extremely miserable.

“Did you really drug Candice back then?” Only then did Claire come back to her senses, and she looked at her daughter in disbelief.

She thought Chloe was a little willful but not to that extent. She thought that by giving Chloe most of her love and being so protective of her, Chloe would be an innocent little princess. Unexpectedly, the daughter she had raised was so vicious as to give her sister sleeping pills and cause a huge accident to happen during her sister’s drill.

Claire looked at Chloe in disbelief, unable to accept the truth, while Chloe was having a mental breakdown and no longer dared to deny it.

Her appearance really infuriated Claire, who suddenly went crazy and started yelling at Chloe. She probably could not control her emotions anymore because she was dealt such a hard blow.

Candice did not try to dissuade Claire, nor did the others.

Without even glancing at the mother and daughter, Edward said to Wyatt, “Minister Nicholson, you should know what to do next, right?” Wyatt looked at Edward and nodded slowly and heavily.

“Oh, right. This is a video of what Chloe did to me last night. Don’t say I wronged her.” Edward passed a phone to Wyatt.

Wyatt did not doubt that Chloe would go that far, but he took the phone silently.

After giving his instructions, Edward turned around and was about to leave when he stopped in his tracks. He said, “Candice.” Candice’s eyes flickered.

“Come here.” He stretched his hand out to hold her hand

Candice looked at his clean and slender fingers.

Actually, she did not know what Edward was planning to do now! She did not even know whether she could return to his side..
