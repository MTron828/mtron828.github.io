Chapter 646: Can You Not Be So Cold to Me? It Scares Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica held her phone tightly.

“I’m sorry, Monica. I might be selfish. I might–”

“I don’t blame you, and you shouldn’t blame yourself so much,” Monica comforted her nervously.

Michael was silent on the other end of the phone.

He seemed to be suffering.

“Don’t think too much about it. First, stabilize your power. I’ll know how to handle the matter between Finn and me.”

“Thank you, Monica,” Michael said with a heavy tone.

Monica said, “I won’t take any more of your time at work. I’ll hang up now.”

“Monica,” Michael called her.

“Hm?”

“Can we have dinner together tonight?”

“I’m still feeling a little unwell,” Monica refused.

“I just want to make up for what I owe you–”

Monica thought for a moment. “Alright, let’s have dinner together tonight.”

“I’ll pick you up.”

“No need. I’ve gone to the hospital to remove my cast today, so I’m alright now. Give me the address, and I’ll come over.”

“Okay.”

“I’ll hang up now.”

“Bye.”

“Bye.”

When Michael hung up the phone, his expression was horrendous.

It looked like using such a simple method to make Monica and Finn break up was a little too ineffective.

He felt that he needed to add more fuel to the fire.

Then, he turned his eyes and looked at the caller ID. The call went through.

“Director Ross.”

“Speak.”

“I’ve found the person you need. Can I come and see you now?”

“Bring him here.”

“Yes.”

Michael hung up the phone, and the coldness in his eyes was even more obvious.

‘Don’t blame me for being ruthless. I’m only doing it to protect myself.’

…

At night, Monica changed into a rather decent dress.

Michael gave her the address of a high-end western restaurant. No matter what, even if she had been living a life worse than death, she still had her dignity and kept her image.

Her famous saying was that even if she wanted to die, she had to die beautifully.

She walked into the western restaurant with her crutches.

Under the staff’s guidance, she walked to the designated location.

Just as she walked over, her footsteps suddenly halted not far away because, other than Michael, she also saw Finn.

Therefore, Michael also invited Finn.

Her heartbeat raced.

At that moment, she could not help but fix her hair.

Luckily, she had dressed up today.

After all, for convenience’s sake, she had worn a very ordinary outfit to the hospital this morning. Even though she had put on a little makeup, she still felt she was not exquisite enough. Then, she even bumped into Finn. That was when she finally understood the meaning of the phrase, “A woman looks good for herself”.

She really cared about how she looked to Finn now.

She took a deep breath. After making sure nothing wrong was with her posture, she prepared to walk over again.

However, Finn suddenly stood up and punched Michael’s face hard.

Michael, as a result, flipped over from the chair.

The originally quiet western restaurant was suddenly filled with a loud noise.

Monica was so shocked that she stood rooted to the ground.

After Finn punched Michael, he pulled the chair away and walked past Monica to leave.

“Finn!” Monica suddenly reacted and caught up with him.

Finn acted as if he did not hear her and walked away quickly.

Monica chased after him, but her crutches and high heels made it impossible for her to catch up with Finn.

At that moment, she even fell to the ground.

Monica was in so much pain.

When Finn heard the sound of her falling, he seemed to slow down a little. However, instead of stopping, he continued to walk forward.

Michael came to Monica’s side and wanted to help her up, but Monica gritted her teeth. “Stop Finn for me.”

Michael quickly ran up and chased after Finn while the staff at the restaurant helped Monica up.

That fall almost gave her a concussion.

After she got up, she took off her high heels and walked out barefoot.

Outside the restaurant, Michael kept pulling Finn.

Finn’s expression was ugly, and he seemed to have threatened Michael before kicking Michael over.

“Finn, what are you doing?” She looked at Michael on the ground and then at Finn’s expression. She was still furious at that moment.

Finn said, “Beat him up. Can’t you tell?”

“What’s wrong with you? You’re not like this.” Monica was frightened by Finn.
