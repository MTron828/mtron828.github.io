Elaine paused again.

Jeanne did not expect that Henry’s family would allow Elaine to be the one to testify against her. That way, it would make people more convinced of their story because no matter what, Elaine was speaking as a third party. Compared to Henry’s family, it was definitely more convincing.

Elaine looked at Jeanne. “I heard Edward’s body is flawed.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed before she turned to look at Edward beside her. Did that mean the Swans did not know about Edward’s condition?

“At first, I thought Edward would never in his life get married, and I also didn’t know how you married Edward with a child. However, Edward has been alone for so many years, which is not something normal. Either he’s physically or mentally flawed. Anyway, I heard somewhere before — I think it was from that br*t, Nox — that there was something wrong with Edward’s body.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Nox, who was still sleeping soundly on the bed, expressed his innocence.

When did he say that there was something wrong with Edward? Well, he might have said it before. After all, he had brought Edward women before, but the latter did not want any of them.

Moreover, he did have a big mouth sometimes.

At that moment, Elaine turned her gaze to Edward. “Edward, we might as well take this opportunity to bring it all up, and I won’t beat around the bush. The Swans have a big family business. Since dad has handed the family over to you, you have no choice but to shoulder a heavy burden on the family and bring the family to greater heights. This is one of your duties. However, the continuation of the family line is also an indispensable part of it. Just tell us honestly. Do you have any physical defects? Are you incapable of having a child, or is it not even a possibility? If so, I really think you should give up your power to the next successor. In my opinion, Eden is the most capable person to become the next successor.”

At that moment, the topic shifted to Edward instead.

Edward said, “Sister, you don’t have to worry. I am completely fine.”

“I don’t think you’d admit to your problems at a time like that. After all, you have to protect Jeanne.” Elaine was certain of that fact. “I don’t know what Jeanne did to you to make you treat her like this, but Edward, I hope you’ll wake up this time. Jeanne killed a Swan!”

Edward’s face darkened.

......

Just as he was about to speak, Old Master Swan spoke.

His voice was stern as if he had had enough. “After hearing so much and for so long, everything all of you said is just your one-sided statements. I’ve said it before. Without concrete evidence, I don’t think Jeanne did this!”

“Dad, stop being so biased toward Edward and Jeanne!” Elaine had said so much, only for her father to insist he did not think Jeanne did it. Her expression stiffened. “The truth is obvious. Jeanne was just jealous that Jasmine was pregnant with the child of the Swans, and since Edward can’t get her pregnant, she was afraid that from then on, Jasmine would be more favored than her in this family! Dad, Jeanne has taken it so far, yet why are you still treating her like this? How do you think big brother’s family will be alright with that? According to tradition, big brother should be the one taking over the family. The fact that you’ve given it to Edward has already upset big brother and his family, yet you’re still defending Jeanne. Let’s not talk about what big brother thinks, but I feel sorry for big brother.”

“Elaine!” Old Master Swan’s expression became even uglier.

However, Elaine did not seem to care anymore. She said directly at Old Master Swan, “Dad, even if you think we’re accusing Jeanne because we might be biased, Jeanne’s father has already said those things about Jeanne. Do you still think you should protect Jeanne? I’m sure Jeanne’s father should know best what type of person Jeanne is, not you.”

Since Elaine mentioned Alexander, he hurriedly went forward with a look of certainty. “Jeanne must have pushed Jasmine and caused Jasmine to fall. Jasmine has always been a very careful girl, and she definitely would be more careful after finding out she was pregnant. She definitely wouldn’t have fallen. Furthermore, when she fell, Jeanne and Jasmine were together. I understand Jeanne’s personality very well. She has always been very competitive and can’t stand to see others being better than her, so she likely attacked Jasmine out of jealousy! What’s more, only Jeanne and no one else were there when Jasmine fell. I refuse to believe that such coincidence can happen.”

When Jeanne heard Alexander saying it with such confidence, she snickered.
