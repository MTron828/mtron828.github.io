1037 Pushed To The Limit

She said, “President Chance, I’m very busy with work, so I won’t be able to accompany you anymore.”

Harry glared at her.

Monica smiled flirtatiously. “Harry, if you think of me next time, you can give me a call.”

She purposely said it very flirtatiously to piss Harry off.

Monica walked out of the room, and after that, her expression changed.

She handed the contract to Steve and said, “Tell the sales department to supply the goods to Harry immediately.”

“Yes,” Steve said respectfully.

As he watched Monica enter the room next door, he could not help but be amazed.

Monica was growing at an astonishingly fast rate.

To Cardellini Enterprise, it was a pleasant surprise, but to Monica…

In fact, he was very worried that Monica would not be able to keep up with her own growth. If she could not keep up, it would be easy for things to backfire on her!

Since Steve waited for her at the door, Monica quickly got changed and came out.

She even joked with Steve, “I didn’t expect it to fit me so well. Do you often buy clothes for your wife?”

Steve was a little embarrassed by Monica.

“I’ve been single for a long time,” he said.

“Huh?” Monica was surprised.

“I put too much effort into my work, and my wife couldn’t take it, so she divorced me eight years ago. I’m living with my son now. He’s in junior high,” Steve briefly explained his situation.

“Didn’t my dad give you a raise?” Monica asked.

There was no need for her to care too much about his personal affairs.

Back then, she used to love to gossip, but now, she had to stay away from those things.

“Your dad has been treating me very well,” Steve said sincerely.

“That’s good.” Monica did not say anything more and walked toward the elevator with Steve.

Just as she got there, Monica bumped into Nox again. As the saying went, those who hate each other would surely meet.

Nox noticed that Monica did not look to happy as well, so he said, “Why are you always following me?”

Monica also wanted to ask him the same question.

When the elevator arrived, the two of them went in together, with Steve following behind Monica. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Nox turned to look at Steve and asked sarcastically, “How many men do you do in one night?”

“As many as you say.” Monica even laughed innocently.

Nox could not take it anymore. “Monica, can you be a little more decent? Even if yor family is going bankrupt, you don’t have to stoop so low! Can’t you suffer a little?”

Steve wanted to say something, but Monica held him back.

Nox watched their interaction and suddenly felt very uneasy.

In the past, although Monica did as she pleased, she was not as shameless as she was now, and he really had the urge to beat her to death.

Monica said, “Nox, men and women are equal. Who said I’m degrading myself?”

Nox was startled.

He did not quite understand what Monica meant.

“You’ve been with so many women. Why don’t you say that you’re demeaning yourself?” Monica smiled.

Nox was speechless. ‘Are we the same?’

“I’ve been hurt so deeply by my relationships. Can’t I vent it out?!” Monica said righteously, “You’re only seeing the older ones this time. I also have younger and extremely handsome ones. You haven’t seen them yet!”

“F*ck!” Nox cursed.

Monica had really changed, and he did not recognize her anymore.

“Back then, I never could understand how you could fool around with so many women, but now, I think I finally understand how happy you are,” Monica said matter-of-factly.

At that moment, Nox did not know how to refute.

“By the way, have you made any progress with the matter I asked you to do the other day?” Monica changed the topic.

Nox said, “I have some. I’ll give it to you when I’m done.”

“Thank you.” Monica smiled.

At that moment, the elevator arrived.

Monica walked out with Steve. “I still have some things to do, so I’ll take my leave first. I’ll treat you to a meal later.”

‘Who wants you to treat them to a meal?’

Nox stared at Monica’s back and cursed, “Damn it.”

Was Monica mentally unsound? Otherwise, how could she have changed so much?

He gritted his teeth.

There was one thing that he did not intend to tell Monica at first, but he was wondering if he could tell her in advance.

Reality had dealt a huge blow to the current Monica!
