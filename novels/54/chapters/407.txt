Chapter 408: Fourth Master Swan Bullies George Translation

At that moment, Edward seemed to have turned back to look at George and said nonchalantly, “You have to get used to it.”

George frowned.

“You have to get used to it. Your mother will be mine from now on.”

George’s small face instantly turned red.

“I told you before. I lent her to you in the past, so it’s time you return her to me now.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

George was already very angry, so when he heard Fourth Master Swan say that, he felt like he was going to explode.

On the other hand, Jeanne looked at George in surprise and did not participate in their conversation.

“If you feel lonely, I will ask your mother to give you a younger brother,” Edward said.

Jeanne was speechless.

When did she say she would give him a child?

“I don’t need it!” George’s voice was loud.

He was obviously extremely angry.

“How about a younger sister?” When someone mentioned the word ‘younger sister’, the corners of his mouth raised.

......

“I don’t need it!” George was even angrier. Did Edward not understand what he said?

“Oh, I need it,” Edward said faintly.

That made George infuriated.

If Edward wanted it, why did he have to force his thoughts on him?

“Mom, don’t give him a daughter!” George said angrily.

Jeanne had always found George very mature for his age.

She did not raise him to be like that. In fact, he had been like that not long after he was born, ever since he discovered his potential as a genius, so George had never had a childlike innocence that a child should have. However, she seemed to be seeing some of George’s willfulness now.

Those were some of the emotions that only a child would have.

He was so angry that his face turned red.

Jeanne had yet to reply before Edward said bluntly, “Whether she gives me a child or not, it may not be up to your mother.”

George stared at Edward with eyes wide.

At that moment, he looked like he wanted to go up and bite Edward.

However, he said fiercely, “The child is born from my mother’s womb. Why doesn’t she have the final say?”

“You won’t understand,” Edward said.

Ever since George was young, he had hated people who said he did not understand because in the field he was in, he was a genius.

Everyone’s evaluation of him was that he was too amazing, and no one had said he did not understand anything!

“After all, you’re still a little brat,” Edward added.

George was fuming, but he was not the kind of person who would make a scene. He suddenly jumped up from the sofa, left in front of them, and went upstairs in a huff.

.

He was throwing a tantrum because Edward pissed him off.

Jeanne looked at George’s back before turning her head and glaring at Edward.

Edward looked back at her. “I think our son could be more down to earth.”

What did he mean by “our son”?

How shameless of him.

Moreover, which father would anger their son like that?

Fourth Master Swan was really sick!

“Don’t you think he’s too cold and aloof?” Edward said.

“Is there a problem with that?”

“No,” Edward said bluntly. “I just think we’ll have a lot less fun with the child like this.”

Did the big boss think that the parents and children had fun when they fought?

“By the way, do you want a daughter? “Edward suddenly changed the topic.

Jeanne was speechless. “I already said I don’t want any children for the time being.”

“Oh,” Edward replied. “I forgot.”

Did he?

Jeanne ignored him and stood up from the sofa.

Edward watched her every move.

“I’m going to see George.”

In the end, if she did not love her son, who would?

She reckoned that George was so angry that he was pulling a long face.

With that, she went upstairs and knocked on George’s door.

It was rare that George was not on the computer in the room. Instead, he was lying on the bed, in a bad mood.

He turned his head to look at Jeanne and then continued to bury his head in the blanket.

He was probably furious at Edward.

In fact, George usually would not bother with the others, but it seemed like he could not control his emotions with Edward every time.

As she sat by his bed, she said, “Edward doesn’t have any ill intentions.”

“I don’t like him,” George said bluntly.

Jeanne did not think that the identity of a peacemaker was not suitable for her.

“I know.”

“He’s too annoying.”

“He is indeed very annoying.”

“Why did you want to marry him?” George raised his head and looked at Jeanne.

His small face did not look happy.
