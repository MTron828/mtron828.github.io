In the quiet space, Monica could not help but say, “Do you like the scarf Ms.

Hansen gave you?”

She regretted it the moment she said it. There was no doubt that she was jealous. Clearly, she should not fuss over it, but she felt disgusted by it.

At the thought of Finn wearing the scarf that Wendy gave him… Did Finn know what a scarf meant? It was like giving a man a tie, which meant that they wanted to hold each other’s hand for the rest of their lives

“I don’t like it, but I was afraid I’d catch a cold and infect you. So, after weighing the pros and cons, I decided to put it on.”

“Didn’t you pack more clothes?” Monica complained, trying to hide her embarrassment.

“I’ll make sure to next time.”

However, there would be no next time. The next time, she would not bring him out to attract girls anymore.

Monica closed her eyes again and allowed herself to fall asleep. Just as she started getting sleepy, she felt a certain someone approaching her body again and holding her tightly in his arms-

Did she not say that he was not allowed to get close? As expected, no man would keep his word.

Despite that, she did not resist. She told herself it was because she was sleepy and did not have the strength to resist. Her acquiescence made the man behind her smile brightly.

The next day, she slept until she woke up naturally. After lunch, they returned to the city of Casterbridge, where they rested briefly at the hotel they were staying at before heading to the airport.

It was still a night flight as Monica was used to traveling at night. It made it easier for her to sleep and prevent her from getting airsick.

The other company sent them to the airport. After the two parties bid each other farewell, Monica, Finn, and Brandon walked into the security check and then boarded the plane.

When the plane took off, Monica had already fallen asleep. As such, Finn pulled her into his arms.

Brandon, who was sitting next to them, was wondering whether the business trip was for work or to accompany those two on their honeymoon. He still felt a little bitter that he could only watch helplessly as the woman he liked ended up in the arms of another man.

The plane also arrived at South Hampton City at night, and Monica’s chauffeur was already waiting at the airport. He respectfully took the luggage and put it into the trunk before driving them back.

Although Monica had slept on the plane, she did not sleep well enough. At that moment, she was still a little dozy, so she leaned lazily against the seat behind the car and looked out of the window of South Hampton City.

Looking at the street, she thought something was wrong but could not put her finger on it.

Brandon, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, suddenly asked, ‘Why is South Hampton City so dark tonight?”

That was when Monica also realized that there were no lights on either side of the street. The night view of the city was not as gorgeous as it seemed, and it felt like the entire city had a blackout.

Of course, no one thought too deeply about it. After all, sometimes the city would turn some lights off to conserve energy. Besides, it was getting late, and there were not many cars on the road, so there was no need to turn on so many lights.

As everyone sat quietly in the car, Monica still felt that something was amiss.

She said to the driver, “Are you going in the wrong direction?”

The driver quickly replied, “No, Director Cardellini. A section of the road on the original route has been blocked, so we’re on another route.”

“Oh,” Monica replied.

She did think too much about it. What she also did not notice was that the man sitting next to her looked a little nervous.

The car drove at a moderate speed until suddenly, they stopped outside the People’s Square.

Monica frowned. “Why did you stop?”

“I’m sorry, Chairman. My stomach hurts a little. I need to use the public washroom in the square to use the toilet.”

Monica nodded. “Oh, go ahead then. Don’t worry, we’ll wait for you.”

“Thank you, Chairman.”

After the chauffeur left quickly, Finn suddenly opened the car door.

“Why are you getting out of the car?” Monica asked.

“I’m just a little car sick. I need to get out of the car to get some fresh air.” Since when did Finn get carsick?

Monica did not ask further and just watched as Finn got out of the car. Then, he paced around, seemingly a little flustered.

After a long while, he mustered his courage and said, “Monica, come down for a moment.”

“What’s wrong?” Monica frowned.

“Come down for a moment,” Finn continued.

Was Finn possessed?
