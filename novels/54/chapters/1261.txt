1262 A Sudden Heartwarming Moment, My Sister Will Be Named Paige

She had been sleeping since 2 a.m. last night until now... She turned around to take a look at the time on the bedside table.

It was 11 a.m. in the morning, which meant that she had slept for a total of nine hours. That had not happened since she was pregnant with the baby.

While she was still in shock, she suddenly heard a voice behind her whispering into her ear, “Do you need to pee?”

Jeanne was speechless. Did he have to be so direct?

Edward seemed to know what Jeanne needed, so he got up from the bed, carried her, and went straight to the bathroom. Then, he gently placed her on the ground and helped her take off her pants…

Why did Jeanne feel that it was too early for that in the morning… No, it was close to noon.

Even so, she sat on the toilet and glared at Edward.

When Edward felt Jeanne’s gaze on him, he seemed to smile before turning around with his back facing her.

Jeanne wanted him to leave, but she could not resist her physiological needs and went to the toilet quietly. She felt very awkward as a faint sound echoed in the bathroom…

After a long time, Jeanne got up from the toilet.

By then, Edward had also turned around and was helping her to adjust her clothes.

He said, “As expected, you’ve held it in for very long.”

Jeanne’s face turned red from embarrassment.

Edward helped her to the sink, where he squeezed some toothpaste for her and passed her a toothbrush. He also filled a glass of water for her.

Jeanne silently accepted his service, and after rinsing her mouth, she washed her face.

Then, Edward held Jeanne’s hand as they walked out of the room. She was hungry, and in fact, Edward was also hungry since he had not eaten for the entire day.

When they arrived at the hall downstairs, George was watching TV in the hall.

Seeing them come down, the delight on his face disappeared, and he deliberately kept his distance from them by turning his head and shifting his gaze away, forcing himself to watch TV.

“Fourth Master, Madam, you’re finally awake.” Teddy looked worried.

He was afraid that the two of them would die in their sleep in the room. After all, be it Edward or Jeanne, their sleeping time was abnormal.

“Is the food ready?” Jeanne asked.

She did not answer why they had slept for so long because she was too embarrassed to answer.

“It’s been prepared. Please wait a minute. I’ll bring it out immediately.”

“Thank you.”

With that, Teddy hurried to the kitchen.

Edward and Jeanne sat at the dining table, and it did not take long before Teddy placed a table full of dishes on the table.

The two of them were hungry, so they ate a little more quietly.

“George.” Teddy stood at the side and suddenly thought of George. He said, “It’s noon. Why don’t you have lunch together?”

It was visible from George’s expression that he refused to have lunch with them.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile. She could not believe that the little brat whom she had raised had a temper now. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She put down her utensils, wiped the corners of her lips, and said, “George, come and have lunch.”

When George heard his mother’s voice, he was still a little emotional at that moment. After all, he had been prepared to give her the silent treatment for a while.

He wanted to let her know that he was entitled to his own emotions and that he did not have to do whatever she wanted him to. However, when his mother took the initiative to greet him, he could not keep the act anymore.

“Ah!” Jeanne suddenly cried out softly.

That cry was clearly meant to attract George’s attention. Instead, it made Edward, who was beside her, nervous.

He quickly put down his utensils and asked, “What’s wrong?”

Jeanne quickly winked at Edward, who naturally understood what she meant. He heaved a sigh of relief and picked up his utensils again to eat.

However, Jeanne’s cry made George run over and look at her worriedly.

“George, touch my belly,” Jeanne said.

George frowned.

He did not want to get close to his mother.

“Feel it. Your sister is moving so hard. Don’t you want to feel her?”

“No.” George would not be fooled so easily.

He was a genius child with an IQ of 200. His mind was much stronger than the average person’s, so he was not so childish.

However, when his mother took his hand and placed it on her round belly, he did not refuse.

Just like that, he felt her huge belly, and then something magical happened. The place where his little hand touched really did move.
