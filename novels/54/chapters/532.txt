Chapter 533: Do I Deserve to Be Abandoned by You, Time and Time Again?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“When did you become like this?” Monica looked at Finn in disbelief.

She had dated Finn for a year and had been married to him for three years. Although she hated him sometimes and thought he was narrow-minded and treated her badly, she never found anything wrong with Finn’s character. She believed he was a principled man and always thought that…

Anyhow, she did not expect Finn would one day disregard the life and death of others.

“How can you be so selfish?” Monica asked him.

Selfish?

That was right. He was a selfish man who neither wanted her to have any interactions with other men nor wanted her to leave him.

He laughed sarcastically and said, “Monica, you’re supposed to be selfish about your feelings for someone. If everyone could be as caring as you, do you think faithful love would exist in this world?”

“I said it before. Michael and I are just putting on a show, but you and I are serious. It’s just a temporary separation. Once Michael–”

“You trust Michael, but I don’t.” Finn interrupted Monica. “So, I won’t let you go to him.”

“Can you trust me? Just trust me!” Monica was getting a little anxious.

If he did not trust Michael, could he trust her?

“I only trust myself.” Finn enunciated each word, and there was no room for rebuttal.

Monica looked at him with her eyes red.

He said, “You only have two choices. It’s either you choose him or me! Once you choose him, I will never have any feelings for you, and I will do as I say!” Finn was forcing Monica to make a decision — the decision to leave Michael.

Even if she found him despicable and disgusting, he would not allow her to go to Michael’s side.

He knew very well that once Monica returned to Michael’s side, it would be impossible for her to return!

“Finn, are you really going to force my hand?” Monica asked him.

Finn did not compromise.

“Do you have to make me feel so bad?” Monica asked Finn.

Other than saving her with his life, Finn had never treated her well.

She had always thought that Finn would never express his feelings for her, but since he saved her with his life, it must be because he loved her very much.

Yet now, she suddenly felt that… maybe that was not the case. Perhaps it was as he said. In that situation, he would save anyone, but it just happened to be her at that time.

She even realized that other than the time he saved her, Finn had not done anything for her. He had also never confessed that he liked her.

“Finn, do you really like me? Do you really know what I want? Do you really know how sad I would be if you forced me to make a decision? I always thought that as long as I explained it to you, you would understand me and know I had no choice but to help Michael. However, you don’t. You just keep forcing me to make a decision!” Monica’s tears kept streaming down her face.

She did not expect Finn would treat her like that.

Despite seeing Monica in pain, Finn simply looked at her coldly and said, “Have you ever liked me?”

Monica was stunned, and her tears continued to overflow.

Was it not obvious that she liked him? Could he not sense that she liked him so much?

“Or do you like me because I saved you? Now that you think Michael is in his current predicament because of you, you’ll run toward him! Monica, how can your love be so cheap? How it be so disgustingly–”

“Slap!” Monica suddenly gave Finn a tight slap on the face.

Finn glared at her with bloodshot eyes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica clenched her fists so tightly that her whole body was trembling.

Why did Finn have to question her love for him?

Why did Finn have to trample on her feelings like that?

She had made it clear from the start that she had always liked him.

It was because she liked him that she felt guilty toward Michael.

That was why she wanted to help Michael to get through the difficult times, which she was part of the cause.

Only by helping Michael could she be together with him in peace.

She had made it clear to him, yet why did he still question her?

Her tears kept falling.
