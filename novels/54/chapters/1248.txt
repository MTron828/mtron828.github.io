1248 Nox’s Accusation Against Jeanne

Zachary’s death caused a huge sensation in South Hampton City and even in Harken.

It was also because of Zachary’s death that everyone knew what contributions the Swans had made to Harken all those years!

The building of Hope Primary school, funding of nursing homes for the elderly, setting up of a youth employment fund, the establishment of a free medical fund for major diseases, the construction of impoverished mountainous areas… The list of countless charitable causes was listed one by one, and it shocked the entire country.

The entire country was saddened by Zachary’s death.

On the day of Zachary’s death, the entire nation mourned, and entertainment was banned.

On the day of Zachary’s burial, the streets of South Hampton City were packed with people sending Zachary, a great man, off.

It was then that Jeanne truly understood why Edward had chosen to be loyal to the Swans and why he had no choice but to give up on her for the sake of the Swans.

The Swans were truly a great family that was dedicated to the country.

It all started with Zachary, or perhaps the family members before that. Everything the Swans did was for the benefit of the country and the people, and generations of Swans could not be destroyed in Edward’s hands.

Edward could not become the sinner in the history of the Swans. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jeanne stared at the news in a daze.

From the death of Zachary to his burial, it took five days. For five days, Edward had been taking care of Zachary’s funeral and had not returned to Bamboo Garden.

As a “dead” person, Jeanne naturally could not appear at Zachary’s funeral. Hence, they had not seen each other for many days.

The next time they met was after Zachary’s burial, when Finn and Nox came back with Edward and George.

George was brought back on the day of Zachary’s death. He had been by Edward’s side for the past five days and had only just returned.

Jeanne was having breakfast when she saw the three of them. Then, she looked at Nox, who was sitting in a wheelchair.

Nox seemed like he was in a good place. Even though he was a little tired because of Zachary’s funeral, he did not give up on herself because of his crippled legs. Instead, when he saw Jeanne, she was unusually excited. “Damn, Jeanne, you’ve grown so fat!”

He called her fat, not chubby.

Jeanne was truly impressed by Nox’s bluntness.

Even if she was pregnant, she still had the desire to be attractive. Hence, when Nox said it so bluntly, Jeanne still felt a little… upset.

“Are you pregnant with twins?” Nox continued.

If it were not for the fact that Nox sacrificed his legs for her, she would have ignored him.

“No, I only have one daughter,” Jeanne said.

“F*ck!” Nox cursed again. “How are you so lucky to be pregnant with a daughter? You know Edward wants a sweet little girl.”

“Your sacrifice wasn’t in vain.” Jeanne smiled.

Nox thought for a moment and smiled proudly. “That’s true.”

“By the way, how’s your leg?” Jeanne asked.

“It’s pretty good.” Nox seemed a little excited. “I can still feel pain, but I can also stand up. My doctor said that I’ll be able to run in a month.”

“You mean, take two steps,” Finn corrected Finn.

“That’s just a conservative estimate,” Nox retorted.

“No, the doctor said you can do that if the situation is optimistic.”

“Finn, I told you to come and support me!”

“Just pretend I didn’t say anything.” Finn shrugged his shoulders. “I’ll accompany Fourth Master upstairs to rest.”

“I want to go with you guys.”

“How are you going upstairs?” Finn raised his eyebrows.

Nox looked at his leg and cursed irascibly again.

Finn and Edward went up with George.

This time, George was really cold to Jeanne as he did not greet her or look at her. She figured that her conversation with him last time had hurt him.

Jeanne controlled her emotions and turned to look at Edward. She saw his undisguised fatigue, and the redness in his eyes was evident.

She really did not know if it was because he was tired or… he was sad.

Edward did not stay in the living room. He held George’s hand and went upstairs with Finn.

Nox cursed as he watched them leave like an abandoned wife.

“What are you laughing at?” Nox turned around and saw Jeanne mocking him.

Jeanne stopped smiling and said, “Are you sleepy? Do you want to rest? There’s a guest room downstairs too!”
