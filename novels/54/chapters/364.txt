Chapter 365: The Accident Is Just the Start

She looked at him, who was asking her if her tattoo was painful with a serious expression, and said, “To you, it shouldn’t be painful.”

Compared to his previous injuries, it would probably feel nothing to him.

“Okay,” Edward replied.

Then, he continued to apply sunscreen on her body attentively.

When he was done, Jeanne’s entire face was red as she lay on the sofa, not moving at all.

“Now help me with it.” Edward suddenly lifted her up.

He was so strong that he could lift her up in one go. She even felt that he could lift her up into the air.

She said, “You’re a man. Why are you applying sunscreen?”

“I care about my image.”

“...”

Jeanne sat up from the sofa and applied sunscreen on Edward.

The man’s figure…

He had such amazing muscles. How did he train it?

......

Her fingers brushed against his lats, which was hard but bouncy.

“Do you like it?” Edward’s back was facing her, but he could feel her fingers deliberately caressing it. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jeanne was speechless.

She did not like it. She did not like strong and powerful men.

Every time she was underneath him, she always felt extremely weak.

She was a little rude when she applied sunscreen on Edward. She was definitely not as careful as Edward was when he was with her.

The sea breeze blew, and the waves rippled.

Never would they imagine that that would be the most peaceful moment in their entire lives.

…

In South Hampton City, Monica got up from her bed.

“Ouch.” She could not help but let out a low cry as she had forgotten about the fracture of her ankle.

She even pulled it carelessly, and it was really painful.

She struggled to get off the ground, picked up her crutches, and limped into the bathroom to wash up.

Then, she looked at her slightly swollen face in the mirror before patting it with water.

F*ck.

It was all Finn’s fault for making her so angry yesterday that her face was now swollen.

She looked unhappily at herself in the mirror.

In the future, she would never take the initiative to say a word to Finn, that *sshole!

After washing up, Monica picked up her crutches and prepared to walk out of the bathroom.

As she had just washed her face, and there was some water puddles on the bathroom floor, she slipped.

“Ah!” Monica fell directly to the ground.

She felt like she was about to meet her end as her vision went black.

It took her a long time before she realized she was not dead and still alive.

However, it was so painful that her big, fat tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

She broke down and shouted at the top of her voice, “Is anyone there? Is anyone home?”

She called out for someone for a very long time, but other than her own voice echoing, there was no one else.

Monica felt her nose turn sour while thinking about what a tragic situation she was in.

She had fallen so badly, yet she had to get up by herself in the end.

She gritted her teeth.

After she was certain that Finn was not around and that the cleaning lady had not come, she could only rely on herself to get up.

She could not just sit in the bathroom and wait for her death.

With that, she practically crawled to pick up the two crutches that had been flung far away. Then, she supported herself with the sink beside her and slowly stood up.

She took a deep breath before carefully walking out of the bathroom and out of her bedroom.

When Monica was in the living room, she was stunned as she watched Finn sit elegantly in the living room and watch TV.

Did that mean… he heard her crying and howling in the room just now but chose to block it out?

Yes, they had nothing to do with each other. Even if she died, he would be indifferent about it, and she did not care.

Anyway, they did not need to be responsible for each other.

Anyway... that was it.

She limped to the kitchen with her crutches.

She was starving.

Although she had ordered takeout yesterday, she was so angry that she did not eat much. When she thought about that b*stard Finn saying, “I have no obligation to help you”, she got so angry that she wanted to tear him apart. She felt she could not live with Finn anymore, for she would go crazy if it continued.

She went to the kitchen by herself and planned to make herself a bowl of pasta.

Sometimes, too much takeout would get boring after a while.

Hence, she tried to prepare a bowl of pasta for herself.

It was said to be very simple.

At that moment, Finn, who was sitting on the sofa, turned to look at Monica. Then, she continued to sit on the sofa and watched TV.

Monica searched the Internet for a tutorial on how to make pasta. She followed the steps, boiled the water, and waited for it to boil.
