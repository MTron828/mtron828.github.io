949 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

After all, she could not dress too flamboyantly to work.

“Alright,” Sarah quickly replied. “I’ll bring them over for you when I come over tomorrow.”

“Is my mom asleep now?” Monica asked.

“She just took a shower and laid down.”

“You should sleep early too. The past two days must’ve been exhausting for you.”

“Cousin, I’m a little flattered by your words.”

“Get lost!” Monica could not help but laugh.

“Alright.” Sarah felt that Monica was back to normal.

Monica then put down her phone.

She did not sleep well last night, and today was another day of high-intensity work. Hence, Monica fell asleep as soon as she closed her eyes.

She slept soundly.

Fortunately, she did not have the habit of being picky about beds. If she was tired, she could sleep anywhere.

She did not know how long she slept when she started to feel a little uncomfortable.

She turned over, wanting to flip over and change her position, but she suddenly felt as if something was pressing down on her.

She jolted awake and opened her eyes, only for someone to cover her mouth.

Monica just stared at the person in front of her in a daze.

At such a close distance, and under the dim light, she could still see that the person was… Michael.

Why was he here? Why did he come?

Just as she was about to resist, she heard Michael whisper in her ear, “If you’re not afraid of waking your father up, you can shout. I don’t mind making your dad suffer a little more.”

Monica instantly fell silent and looked straight at Michael.

She did not know why he was in the ward or what was his motive for coming.

At that moment, she even felt Michael covering her mouth with one hand and slipping his hand into her clothes.

Monica’s eyes widened, and she looked at him with red eyes. However, she did not move.

“Monica, how does it feel being molested?” Michael whispered into her ear.

Monica had been enduring the emotions that she had been suppressing.

“You know, you ruined the innocence I’ve kept for you for so many years. Do you know how terrible I felt at that time? To have to hug another woman before the wedding and make love to her while I still had to force a smile and feel guilty about it. However, little did I know that it was all your doing. Monica, you’re really disappoint me.” Michael spoke softly in her ear, and the anger in his voice was not discernible.

Monica clenched her fists tightly.

“Were you happy when Finn slept with you?” Michael suddenly asked her.

Tears streamed down Monica’s face.

She did not want to cry.

She felt that even if she was defiled by Michael, it was nothing. She would just treat it as being bitten by a dog.

What innocence did she have anyway? She had lost hers the last time she slept with Finn.

Besides, it would not be her first time, so she did not care about it.

When she woke up tomorrow, she could pretend that nothing had happened.

“Do you know how terrible I felt that night?” Michael said, “It was second only to the pain of me sleeping with Brie.”

Monica the pain in her throat. Even though she consoled herself, it still hurt. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She looked at Michael’s ugly face, which revealed his true nature. It used to make her think that he was a good person.

“You must hate me now.” Michael buried his head in her neck.

Then, he landed one kiss after another on her neck, on her already loose shoulders, on her collarbones, and even further down…

“Can we go somewhere else?” Monica suppressed her voice and asked him.

She wanted to go at least somewhere else that was not by her father’s side.

She did not care if her body was ruined, but she cared about her family.

She did not want to disgrace her father. It did not matter to her how filthy she was, but she just did not want her family to see her like that

The moment Michael kissed her body, he suddenly laughed. Then, his lips returned to Monica’s ear, and he said, “No.”

He refused her flatly.

“I’m here to take revenge on you, so of course, I’ll do whatever I can to make you feel bad. The greatest gift I can give you is to try not to make any sound. Otherwise...”

Monica was really filled with hatred. She hated Michael so much that she wanted to kill him.

How could someone like Michael exist in this world? How could there be a man as bad as Michael?

Time and time again, he had crossed her boundaries.

Why did she think back then that Michael was the best man in the world and the man who treated her the best?
