Chapter 1732: The Twins’ Names

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn walked towards the two babies, who were sleeping soundly. As Nox said, they were not good-looking, but it warmed his heart.

He had been looking forward to the day when he would become a father. However, now that he had truly become a father, the feeling was completely different from what he had imagined. The joy was indescribable, and he wanted the world to be peaceful for his kids.

“Sir.” The nanny saw the look in Finn’s eyes and said, “Sir, do you want to hold them?”

She had probably noticed that from the moment the babies were born, he had been by the mother’s side and had no time to see his children. On top of that, she could feel his love for the children from the look in his eyes.

Finn turned around and glanced at Monica. Seeing that she was still sleeping soundly, he nodded.

“I’ll hold the sister first.”

It was not that he was biased. It was just that girls were naturally more favored.

The nanny hurriedly took the sister out of the crib and brought her to Finn. Even though she was moved around so much, she was sound asleep and showed no signs of waking up.

When Finn took the baby in his arms, she was soft and warm, even though she was so small. The feeling was magical. It was magical in the miracles that life could bring to a person — to soothe all the pain and make one so happy.

Finn had never been a sentimental person, but when he hugged his daughter, he felt a mix of emotions. He kept sizing up his daughter. Although she looked really ugly now, he just could not put her down. It felt as if he had the whole world in his arms.

Monica was initially sleeping soundly, but for some reason, she suddenly woke up. When she opened her eyes in a daze, she saw Finn carrying the child a few steps away from her.

She looked at the smile on his face and his gentle expression. She had thought that she would be jealous, but on the contrary, seeing the baby in Finn’s arms warmed her heart.

At the thought that Finn was an orphan and had never had any relatives… Now, she had finally given him a family with two kids, and she felt satisfied. She was happy to be able to do something for the person she loved the most.

Instead of disturbing Finn, Monica closed her eyes and continued to sleep. She was so exhausted that she just wanted to sleep.

Finn also did not notice that Monica had woken up. He had to admit that the baby in front of him had all his attention. He wanted to look at her forever. He said in a low and gentle voice, “Baby, I’m your dad.”

Monica, who was asleep, heard it, and the corners of her mouth curled into a slight smile as she fell asleep. In her sleep, she felt a pair of warm hands holding her. Occasionally, she could also hear the babies’ cries, but they quickly disappeared.

When Monica woke up from the most comfortable sleep she had ever had, she felt as if all her cells had been reborn.

“I’m so hungry,” Monica called out.

She had rested enough, but she was starving. She felt that she could eat a

whole cow at that moment.

“Are you awake?” Finn was sleeping beside her.

The bed was small, so Finn had to sleep very closely next to her. Logically speaking, with Finn’s sensitivity, he would notice her every movement. Yet, he only woke up today after she spoke, showing how tired he was.

Even in her sleep, she could feel that Finn had been taking care of the children besides accompanying her. Whenever the children cried, he would go over to take a look at them. Then, he would help the nanny with the feeding and changing of the diapers. In any case, he would try his best to do things he could personally do.

Upon knowing that, Monica’s heart warmed up again. Finn was an aloof person, but she was touched beyond words.

Finn, who had already gotten up from the bed, said to the nurse, “Monica is hungry. Can you request the hospital to send the meal over quickly?”

“Yes, sir,” the nurse said respectfully.

Finn then went to the bathroom to wash up. After a while, he came out with a cup of water, a toothbrush with toothpaste, and a small basin.

He said to Monica, “Brush your teeth first.”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
