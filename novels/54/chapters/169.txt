Chapter 170: Failed Confession, but There’s Still Time

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward was silent.

He looked at Jeanne coldly in silence.

At this point, Jeanne felt that she had expressed herself very clearly.

She left once again.

“I thought that I could make up for the regret from seven years ago. I didn’t expect that it was just my wishful thinking.” Edward’s voice was extremely low and deep behind her.

“I never felt that it was a regret. It was just an accident that arose from many causes.”

Therefore, the past was in the past. There was no need to hold on to it.

Jeanne left.

This time, she really left.

She left very resolutely.

Edward just watched her leave.

He watched as she disappeared from his sight.

Teddy looked at his master. It had been a long time since he saw his master in such a state.

Fourth Master Swan was clearly upset, but he could hide it well and not let anyone know.

Teddy thought about it and decided to go after Ms. Lawrence.

After all, Fourth Master had prepared a lot tonight.

The meal was just a small part.

There were going to be fireworks, gifts, and others…

However…

Teddy could not let his master’s hard work go to waste.

His master had never been so serious for a woman.

Nevertheless, just as he reached the door…

“Teddy,” Edward called out to him.

Teddy looked at him.

“Forget it,” Edward said.

Teddy had never heard his master say those two words in his entire life.

In his master’s life, there was no such thing.

Did Fourth Master Swan just give up?!

It was not easy for him to fall in love with a woman, but he gave up just like that.

Teddy felt a little bad for his master.

He could not understand why Ms. Lawrence would reject such an outstanding man.

If the Fourth Master Swan took a liking to Teddy, even if he was a man, as long as the fourth master asked, he would agree immediately.

How could Jeanne be so indifferent?

As a bystander, Teddy could not see even a trace of Ms. Lawrence’s longing for his master.

That was good.

It was good that Fourth Master Swan had given up.

Teddy thought that Ms. Lawrence was heartless. The one who would get hurt would be Fourth Master Swan if he persisted.

In many aspects, Teddy’s master was much calmer than the average person. He knew very well what he should do and what he should not do.

When Teddy thought of this, the emotions in his heart calmed down slightly.

All of a sudden, he heard his master say, “I might’ve scared her.”

“...” Teddy looked at Fourth Master Swan in a daze.

“There’s still time in the future.”

Hence, Fourth Master Swan, who was rejected, did not give up after being rejected so bluntly.

How much did he love Jeanne?

So much that he could lie to himself and others!

“Let’s go,” Edward said.

He somehow just appeared very calm.

It was as if he was not the one who was rejected just now.

After getting up, Edward stopped again. He turned around and picked up the bouquet of roses that Jeanne had thrown away.

Teddy looked at his master’s actions.

Who would have known that every single flower in this bouquet was personally picked by Fourth Master Swan? Every single one of them was cut by him.

Edward picked up the bouquet of flowers and sat in the back seat of the car.

It was quiet in the car.

Edward’s phone rang.

He took a look and picked it up.

“Fourth Master Swan, I really don’t want to disturb your wonderful night. I just want to remind you not to overindulge. We have to leave first thing in the morning tomorrow.”

“Okay,” Edward responded faintly and hung up the phone.

The moment he hung up the phone, a trace of cruelty flashed across his face.

Every year, there was this day!

…

Jeanne left Chez Jeanne.

She sat in a taxi and returned to the Lawrences’ manor.

She just watched the night view of South Hampton City.

She did not think about anything.

Jeanne did not want to think about anything.

It would be the end of her relationship with Fourth Master Swan.

Everything that had happened in the past and now was just a flash in the pan. Once she left South Hampton City, she might not even be able to remember them.

Despite that...

Her rationality had always been firm, but her emotions had always been in turmoil.

She even felt a wave of heartache.

From the moment she left Chez Jeanne until now, she had been enduring silently, but she could not ignore it…

Jeanne told herself that Fourth Master Swan was very powerful.

She did not need to feel burdened.

Yes.

It was just a psychological burden.

She would not fall in love with Fourth Master Swan so easily.

Her feelings were not so cheap.

Jeanne returned to the Lawrences’ manor calmly.

She only needed a little time.

A little time and she would be able to return to normal.

In the room, George sat in front of the computer, typing and clicking away.

Jeanne smiled. “You’re still working on the design draft.”

“There’s still some unfinished work.” George broke down. “Master is too strict.”

“Can you do it tomorrow?”

“I have to go to school tomorrow,” George replied.

“Hm?” Jeanne almost forgot that George was still a primary school student.

“Right. I skipped school for a week, so the teacher asked you to bring me to school tomorrow,” George reminded her.

“...” Was this going to be the first time in Jeanne’s life that she had been invited as a parent?!

Jeanne suddenly felt a little awkward.

She braced herself and agreed. “Okay.”

George did not say anything more.

In his world, inviting a parent was probably just... A small matter!

The next day, Jeanne was ready to go to school and be criticized by the teacher.

Just as she arrived at the school gate in a bright car, she received a call from Amy.

She had told Amy last night that she would be late today, so if she were to be suddenly called at this point, something bad must have happened.

Jeanne picked up. “Amy.”

“Director Lawrence, Hurry and come to the company. The people from the prosecutor’s office are coming to look for you.”

“Who?”

“The prosecutor’s office.”

Jeanne frowned.

“What’s the matter?”

“They only said they’re looking for you. They didn’t say anything else.”

“Okay, I’ll go over in a while.” Jeanne hung up the phone.

George looked at Jeanne. “Did something happen?”

“I ran into some trouble, but I can handle it.”

Jeanne would never show any panic in front of George.

She did not want George to worry about her.

“Oh.”George nodded. “Then can you still bring me to the school?”

“Of course.”

No matter what happened, George was the most important.

Jeanne brought George into the school.

As expected, she was severely criticized by the teacher and even the principal.

Even so, as George was a genius, only Jeanne was criticized.

The school still treated George as if he were a warm spring breeze.

Jeanne spent the morning dealing with the situation.

When she came out of the school, she had at least 20 missed calls.

Some were from Forrest, some were from Amy, and some were from Alexander.

She ignored them.

Jeanne sat in a bright and open car and went to the Lawrence Enterprise.

The car she had crashed yesterday had been knocked out of shape. Now that she had sent it to the garage for repair, it would probably take at least a month for it to be fixed.

“Miles,” Jeanne said.

“Yes?”

“If I don’t return today, help me inform Kingsley.”

“Okay.”

After Jeanne gave her instructions, she did not say anything more.

Miles would not ask too much either.

Most of the time, they were just carrying out simple tasks.

The car arrived. Jeanne walked straight to the sales department.

There were three men in uniforms standing in the sales department’s office.

The three of them seemed displeased about Jeanne being late.

Amy saw her and hurried forward. “Director Lawrence.”

Jeanne nodded slightly.

She walked toward the three men with a calm expression. “You’re looking for me.”

The man in the lead glanced at Jeanne and said, “I’m the prosecutor of the administration office, Ron Hamilton. This is my work permit.”

Jeanne looked at him.

“We received an anonymous report that you secretly profited while building the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse. The amount of profit you made was as high as 30 million dollars, which is an economic crime! Please come back with us and help with the investigation.”
