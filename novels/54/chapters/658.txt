Chapter 659: The Relationship Between Edward and Jeanne Started When She Was in the Womb!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Michael might not be who you think he is.”

“I didn’t say that. I only asked you to test him and not to make you think he’s a bad person.”

“Oh.” Monica replied and asked, “Then, do we need to do anything else?”

“Monica, you need to change your mindset.”

“What mindset?” Monica was dumbfounded.

“We’re testing Michael now, not harming him. Everything we do won’t cause any harm to Michael, and please don’t think you owe him anything by doing this.” Jeanne was a little disappointed in Monica. “What did Michael do to you to make you think you owe it to him by helping him?”

“I…” Monica did not know why she felt that way.

However, Jeanne knew.

It was because Michael was pretty smart. He knew very well how to treat Monica to soften her heart.

Despite knowing that, Jeanne would not say it out loud.

If she did, Monica would assume she had ill intentions toward Michael, and once she had ill intentions, Monica would think more about Michael.

“You only need to think of it in this way. Everything you’re doing now is to remove one of our prejudices toward Michael. You’re helping him now, not harming him. If Michael can do everything I’ve told you, I’ll believe he’s a good person and that he had no choice but to choose to be with you in such a way. I’ll even support you in helping Michael. I’ll also convince your parents, including Finn.”

“Really?” Monica was pleasantly surprised, but she suddenly felt disappointed. “I feel like I can’t convince Finn.”

“Huh?”

“I called him today. He said if I went near him again, he would kill me.” Monica wanted to cry.

Jeanne was also a little surprised.

Had Finn reached that breaking point?

“Jeannie, do you think I can return to Finn’s side after all this with Michael is over?”

“I don’t know.” Jeanne really could not give her an answer.

“I’m really scared that Finn doesn’t want me anymore…”

“It’s useless even if you’re afraid now.” Jeanne had no choice but to tell her the cold, hard truth. However, she was also giving Monica some courage. “As long as you’re still with Michael, whatever you do will hurt Finn. Therefore, what you need to do now is not to salvage your relationship with Finn but to end it with Michael as soon as possible. Once it’s over, you can think about how to get Finn back.”

“Right.” Monica agreed with Jeanne’s thoughts.

Finn was treating her that way now because he did not believe she was only doing it to help Michael. He did not even believe that Michael was a good person and that once she helped Michael, she would be able to return to his side. Once she proved to him that it was all true, Finn would not treat her like that anymore.

Suddenly, she felt motivated again.

As expected, Jeanne was the best at comforting people. No matter how unhappy she was,?she would feel much better under Jeanne’s guidance.

“Alright, let’s not talk anymore. I have work to do.” After Jeanne said that, she did not forget to remind Monica, “Regarding the matter of testing Michael, take it seriously.”

“Alright,” Monica agreed immediately.

After that, they both hung up.

Having received a resume from Michael, Monica took a few glances at it and forwarded it to her father. Then, she made a call to her father. “Dad.”

“You still have the guts to call me?” Gary gritted his teeth.

“Dad.” Monica acted like a spoiled child.

“What did you just send me?”

“A friend’s resume. He graduated from a famous university overseas and now wants to join our company’s research team–”

“Do you have reliable friends?” Gary interrupted Monica mid-sentence.

“Dad.” Monica got annoyed.

“Except for Jeannie.”

F*ck! Was she not his biological daughter?

“The company has its own rules and regulations when selecting people. If everyone pulls some strings to get into the company, what threat will we invite? No matter who it is, I won’t agree to this matter. Don’t waste your breath.” Gary directly rejected Monica.

Monica was a little angry, but she also knew that her father was sometimes a principled person, especially when it came to matters of work.

Moreover, the research team was the lifeblood of their family’s business, so they could not be careless.

She thought about it for a while but did not say anything else so as to avoid asking for trouble.

“In that case, I’ll hang up.”

“Monica!” Gary suddenly flew into a rage.

Monica was shocked. “Dad, why are you shouting?”

“Do you know what day it is today?”

“What day is it?” Monica was dumbfounded.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
