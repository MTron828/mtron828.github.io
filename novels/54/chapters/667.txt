Chapter 668: The Shareholder Meeting, A Huge Catfight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Quinn had always had high expectations of herself. Although it seemed like her father did not like her, in reality, his father held her in high regard. As for the rumors that her father was fondest of Melody, it was just a show for the outsiders! In the royal family, useless people would never have any status.

Yet now, Jeanne had a place in the Sanders.

Naturally, it was a threat to her.

As the saying went, know yourself and know your enemy… She wanted to see just how strong Jeanne was! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

…

Jeanne walked into the meeting room of the shareholders’ meeting.

At that moment, all the shareholders were present, and Joshua was already sitting in the middle seat.

Jenifer sat beside Joshua, followed by the other shareholders in Lawrence Enterprise. There were a total of 15 people around the table.

When Jeanne arrived, no good seats were left, so she sat down in the furthest seat but did not feel aggrieved.

Joshua looked at Jeanne coldly, stood up, and said, “With my grandfather and my father passing away, I’m in a lot of pain, but I can’t turn back time. I can’t change anything other than continuing to develop Lawrence Enterprise.”

Everyone looked at Joshua. Even though he looked very imposing at the moment, no one believed that he could manage a company.

Unaware of what the others were thinking, Joshua continued, “I believe everyone knows that I own 43 percent of Lawrence Enterprise’s shares, which makes me the current chairman of Lawrence Enterprise. Although I have the obligation to manage the entire Lawrence Enterprise well, I know I’m still young and do not have the ability to do that. I also don’t want Lawrence Enterprise to suffer a huge loss because of me. Therefore, to ensure the development of Lawrence Enterprise, I hope someone more capable will take the role of executive general manager and take full responsibility for all the management and operations in the company.”

Joshua’s straightforwardness made the other shareholders look at him in a different light.

They thought that Joshua would use his shares to order the company around, and if that were the case, it would not be long before the company would be doomed! In fact, many shareholders had discussed in private that they would protest against Joshua being in charge of the entire Lawrence Enterprise. However, what Joshua said won the favor of all the shareholders.

“I’ve thought about it for a long time and decided to hire the former general manager of Swan Enterprise’s Swanhaven Bank, Eden, as our company’s executive general manager,” Joshua suddenly announced.

As soon as he said that, the entire room was in an uproar.

Jeanne was not very surprised, but she was surprised by the Lawrences’ actions.

Without a doubt, letting Eden go against her was the best way the Lawrences could think of now.

It turned out that the Lawrences were not too stupid after all.

“I believe all the shareholders have heard of how capable Eden is. I’ve also spent a lot of effort to get Eden to accept the position of executive general manager. If no one has any objections, the position will be confirmed. I will get Eden to work in the company as soon as possible and put Lawrence Enterprise back on the right track.”

“I have objections,” Jeanne said right after Joshua said his piece.

“What objections do you have? Do you want to be the executive general manager?” Joshua’s tone was full of sarcasm. “Do you think you’re more capable than Eden?”

“In that case, how confident are you that Eden is more capable than me?” Jeanne asked back.

Joshua was stunned and suddenly could not find the words to refute Jeanne.

However, Jeanne ignored Joshua. She stood up and said domineeringly, “With my grandfather and father’s passing, as the Lawrences’ eldest daughter, I have the responsibility to support Lawrence Enterprise. I also have the confidence to grow the company to greater heights. Since we can handle the matter of managing the company internally, why do we still need to hire outsiders?”

“Eden is not an outsider. He’s the son-in-law of the Lawrences and part of a Lawrence,” Joshua retorted.

“But his surname is not Lawrence.”

“You’re twisting the facts here.” Joshua’s calmness was about to break.

“I just don’t understand why I can’t manage the company. Why do you need to find someone else?”

“Because you’re not as capable as Eden!”

“Whether I’m capable or not depends on my achievements. May I ask what kind of great achievements Eden has made during his tenure that you trust him so much?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“When Eden was at Swanhaven Bank, he increased Swanhaven Bank’s cash flow by two percentage points. At the same time, it increased its annual profit by three percentage points. He also negotiated for the exclusive use of the bank for three Fortune 500 companies.” Joshua should have done his homework in advance, or he would not have answered so fluently.

Coincidentally, she had also done her homework.

She said, “The increase in Swanhaven Bank’s cash flow and profit was significant, but that wasn’t due to Eden’s contribution. If you carefully analyze the development of Swanhaven Bank over the years, they have been growing by two to three percentage points every year for the last five years. So, as long as Swanhaven Bank doesn’t make any big decision-making mistakes, this increase is a trend value. It’s not from someone’s achievement.”

Joshua’s face turned red.

“Moreover, if I remember correctly, the so-called three Fortune 500 companies only signed an exclusive agreement with Swanhaven Bank’s South Hampton City branch. I don’t think the entire company was included in the agreement. As far as I know, many of the three companies’ other branches use accounts from other banks. Hence, I don’t think signing on with three Fortune 500 companies is something to brag about. And what really counts as an achievement for Swanhaven Bank is its expansion in the overseas market. But apparently, when Eden took office, he didn’t manage to negotiate it.”

Joshua stared straight at Jeanne.

He was really rendered speechless by this woman’s rebuke.

He had prepared so well and did not even give the woman the time to prepare. Yet, she could refute him so smoothly.

At that moment, he even heard her say very domineeringly, “As for my achievements, they surpass Eden’s by miles!”
