Chapter 525: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

At least she had never done anything to harm him.

Everything he was facing now was of his own making, so she should not blame everything on herself. Perhaps it was related to her, but it was not to the point where she needed to take responsibility.

She took a deep breath, and a wide sweet smile stretched across her face. “Hubby, luckily you showed up, or I would’ve given in again. It seems I just can’t refuse someone when I see them sad. In the future, you must remind me. Otherwise, I would be too stupid to know that people are taking advantage of me!”

Seeing that Monica had accepted it, Finn secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

He knew Monica too well.

He was afraid that she was moved by Michael and would agree to help Michael with many things.

What was more, once Monica accepted being with Michael, Michael had many ways to make sure that Monica could never leave his side again.

With that, he hugged Monica in his arms.

This time, he did not blame her. He just hugged her tightly and said, “No matter what, we’ll face it together. Even if you want to help Michael, we can think of a way together, but we absolutely can’t use the method of getting back together with Michael to help him!”

“Okay.” Monica nodded seriously.

She knew very well that the person she liked now was Finn, so she had to hold on to her principles.

The two of them hugged each other for quite a while.

In the meantime, Finn also told Monica a lot about the pros and cons of the matter.

Monica listened carefully and made up her mind that she would not be influenced by Michael.

She believed that Michael could survive, and she knew very well that she did not want to be together with Michael again.

By the afternoon, all of Finn’s examination reports were out. Since everything was normal, they could be discharged from the hospital and go home to rest.

It took them some time to go through the discharge procedures.

Around 4 p.m., the Cardellini family’s chauffeur came to pick up Monica and Finn.

Gary and Ruby rarely came to the hospital since Finn left the intensive care unit because one time, they happened to bump into Monica’s shenanigans... to Finn. Although the two elders felt awkward, they were relieved. After that, they only communicated over the phone as they did not want to disturb Monica and Finn’s relationship.

Therefore, they only exchanged pleasantries over the phone and sent a chauffeur to pick them up.

After Monica and Finn finished packing, they left the hospital.

When they arrived at the car park, Monica and Finn were stunned because they saw Michael in front of them.

A lot of bandages were wrapped around Michael, but he was leaving the hospital.

It had only been a few hours. How could Michael be discharged already?

Monica bit her lip.

However, Finn pulled her into his arms, which subsequently pulled Monica back to her senses, and she followed Finn into her family’s car. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Michael and Reese walked in front, while Monica, Finn, and the chauffeur walked behind.

Their cars were parked not too far away from each other, so the moment Michael and Reese were about to get into the car, Monica and Finn were also about to get into their car.

However, at that moment, some reporters swarmed out of nowhere and instantly surrounded Michael and Reese.

“Mr. Ross, I heard you were in a car accident. You look like you’re seriously injured. Why are you leaving the hospital?”

“Mr. Ross, I heard Minister Ross has passed away. Is that true?”

“Mr. Ross, now that your popularity has dropped, it’s very likely that you’ll lose your position as the?Director of the Food Inspection Department. What do you have to say about that?”

“Mr. Ross, I heard you and Monica have always been in a complicated relationship, and it’s because of your moral ethics that your popularity has dropped. Do you have anything to say about this?”

…

The reporters surrounded them, making it impossible for them to escape.

Monica’s expression was a little unsightly.

Could those unscrupulous reporters not see that Michael was seriously injured and needed rest?

Yet, they still had to stop them at that moment.

Monica was so angry that she gritted her teeth, and Finn could only hug Monica tightly.

“Get out of the way!” Reese had been protecting Michael behind her the entire time. Probably it was her maternal instincts, but for her son, she made herself seem much tougher. “If you guys go on like this, I’ll call the police. Get out of the way, all of you!”
