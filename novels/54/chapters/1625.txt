Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox’s anxious expression changed the moment he saw Benjamin, and it was very obvious.

He only found out where Shelly was staying through Monica’s cousin, Sarah. However, he did not expect to see Benjamin here and wearing an… apron!

At that moment, he blurted out without thinking it through, “Are you guys living together?”

Just as Benjamin was about to ask Nox if he was looking for Shelly, Nox’s words stunned him, and he was going to deny it.

“Why are you here?” Inside the house, Shelly came out with Bella, who had gone to the toilet.

The moment she saw Nox, impatience and rejection filled her face.

“Can’t I be here? Is he the only one who can be here?” Nox pointed at Benjamin angrily.

His voice was so loud that it frightened Bella. Her body even trembled a little.

Shelly quickly took off Bella’s hearing aid and said to Benjamin, “Take Bella back to her room for me.”

Benjamin looked at Nox’s angry face and hesitated. However, Shelly said firmly, “Thank you.”

With that, Benjamin nodded, took Bella from Shelly’s arms, and walked into the bedroom. Shelly and Benjamin’s intimate interaction was an eyesore to Nox.

After sending Benjamin and Bella away, Shelly asked Nox coldly, ‘What do you want?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What did he want? He wanted to strangle Shelly!

He had just received a call from Zoe’s father, who said that they had a video of him cheating on Zoe too when him and Zoe were in a relationship. Mr. Sullivan said that they knew they were in the wrong, but they hoped he would not take back the funds to give them a chance to live.

They were obviously using the video of him and Shelly sleeping together to threaten him into letting them go!

Was he someone who could be threatened? Obviously not! However, he felt that he should tell Shelly about it first.

After all, once the video was exposed, it would hurt Shelly too. That was why he rushed over to tell Shelly about it in person, just so she could be mentally prepared. Then, later on, he would naturally settle the matter. To be frank, he

was just trying to make the Sullivans kill themselves.

He knew very well that the night he slept with Shelly, he was drugged. Based on his current understanding of Shelly, he knew she had no feelings for him, so he was absolutely sure that Shelly had not done it. After thinking it through, he realized that the person who could have drugged him that night was Zoe, but he needed some time to verify it.

Hence, he would get the Sullivans to release the video, which would be evidence. Once the video was released, Zoe would be sent to jail!

He did not have any pity for Zoe. Since she had a death wish, he would send her to her death!

He had thought of everything, and the first thing he thought of was to minimize the damage to Shelly as much as possible. Knowing that the Sullivans would soon expose the video if he did not relent, he rushed to give Shelly a heads-up.

Unexpectedly, he, who was considerate of Shelly, was met with Shelly’s indifference. He even had to witness Shelly’s and Benjamin’s intimate interaction! Nox felt that he had made a fool of himself; he had asked to be humiliated!

“What do you want from me?” Shelly did not hide her impatience and disgust for Nox.

She had really had enough of Nox! What exactly did she have to do so that he would not find fault with her and pester her? What must she do to fulfill Nox’s wish?

“From the moment I entered your family until now, I’ve never done anything to let you down. I don’t owe you anything. Now, I just want to live my life, and my only hope is that you won’t appear in front of me again. I really don’t want to see you for even a second!” Shelly suddenly lost it.

She really could not take it anymore, and she could not understand why Nox had to come here to pick a fight. What did she do to let him down and for him to make her life so difficult?

Did she have anything to do with him being cheated on by Zoe?
