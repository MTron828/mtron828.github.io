1223 George Gets Angry

Edward’s Adam’s apple kept bobbing. His emotions were bursting, but he was also suppressing them.

He said, “Alright.”

“Let’s get along well for the last three months.” Jeanne looked at him with a smile.

She really felt relieved.

“Alright.” Edward nodded again.

His eyes were red as he nodded.

Sometimes, he was afraid of Jeanne’s calmness. It was because once she was calm, it would mean that she had let it go. Once she let it go, she would never love him again.

“I made a cake.” Jeanne changed the topic.

After everything was said, she returned to her usual self.

“Do you want some?” Jeanne said.

In the end, she made a birthday cake for herself today. Even though her birthday had passed, she felt that she could still celebrate a little.

After all, that would be her last birthday on this earth. It could also be considered the last celebration in her life.

Jeanne did not seek Edward’s permission. She simply stood up and walked into the open kitchen to take out the cake she had made in the afternoon before returning to Edward’s side.

The cake was very small, and it was a very cute light blue color.

It read: “Jeanne’s 26th Birthday!”

She would forever be 26.

Jeanne placed the candles by herself one by one and lit them up.

“I’ll go get George.” Edward suddenly stood up.

He had lost control of his emotions because he just could not accept how calm Jeanne was after knowing everything.

“Don’t.” Jeanne said coldly, “George should learn to forget me in the future.”

Edward looked at her, his eyes red.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile. “I’m going to make a wish.”

She looked at the cake in front of her and the lit candles. Then, she closed her eyes and clasped her hands together to make a wish. She was taking it very seriously.

In fact, she only made one wish because she was afraid that she would not be able to realize it if she was too greedy.

She took a long time to make her wish because she thought that it would be easier to fulfill it if she was more sincere.

When she opened her eyes, she was caught off guard by the teardrop in Edward’s eye that was blocked the moment he lowered his head.

Jeanne’s eyes reddened quietly before they faded away. She then blew out the candle, removed the candles one by one, and cut the cake.

She cut a piece for Edward. “Try it.”

Edward took it.

It might have only been a few seconds, but their relationship would return to normal.

Jeanne also cut a piece for herself. It was her first time making a cake, and she did not know if she had succeeded.

Hence, she picked up the spoon and took a bite. After taking a bite, she suddenly laughed.

She looked at Edward, watching as he continued to stuff the cake into his mouth. She said, “I think I mistook salt for sugar.”

The cake was actually salty, and the taste was indescribably unique.

“No.” As Edward ate, he said, “It’s very sweet.”

Jeanne bit her spoon and moved her lips slightly. She put down the cake in her hand as she did not want to harm the baby in her stomach. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, she looked on as Edward finished the large piece of cake. After he finished eating, he wanted to cut another piece.

Jeanne immediately grabbed his hand. “It’s not good to eat too much at night.”

Edward nodded silently and stopped cutting the cake.

“It’s late. You should rest early,” Jeanne said.

With that, she was prepared to get up.

Her stomach was quite big now, and it was really not easy for her to get up without supporting herself with her arms.

At that moment, a pair of large hands held her arm.

Jeanne held it in and accepted Edward’s help. She stood up by holding his hand, and after she steadied herself, she turned around to leave.

Edward’s hand suddenly reached out to her cheek.

Startled, Jeanne dodged a little.

Edward’s fingers twitched as he said, “There’s some cream on your mouth.”

Jeanne quickly wiped it off with her hand.

Edward watched Jeanne try to distance herself from him.

By saying they would get along well for the next three months, did she mean they get along well on the surface level only?

He stared at Jeanne’s back and watched as she wiped the corners of her mouth and left.

Eventually, he followed behind her. Even if she might be fed up with him, he followed behind her and kept a distance that was not too far but not too close.

She actually walked very slowly, especially when going up the stairs.
