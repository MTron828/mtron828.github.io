Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“There’s a breakfast diner up ahead. I’ll go in and get a takeaway.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“There’s no need to trouble yourself.” Monica appeared very polite.

“I haven’t had breakfast either.” Michael smiled.

Monica wanted to say something but did not.

She could tell that their current interactions were quite awkward, so it was best they had fewer interactions in the future.

The car stopped at the entrance of the breakfast diner, where Michael went in to get some takeaway breakfast.

When he came back, he handed her a breakfast burrito and coffee.

Monica took it, and the two of them ate in silence.

Michael was not a talkative person, whereas Monica had something on her mind as she ate.

It seemed Michael still remembered that she liked burritos.

In fact, it had not been long since Michael came back and when the two of them got back together again. Moreover, they barely met up because they knew they were not officially a couple, so they had never had breakfast together. She did not expect Michael to still remember after so many years.

Feeling conflicted, she finished the muffin and the coffee.

After that, Michael naturally took Monica’s paper bag filled with rubbish, got out of the car, and threw it into the trash can. When he came back, he gave her a bottle of mineral water, a bottle of mouthwash, and a pack of chewing gum.

......

That was her standard back then.

She liked to eat burritos, but she always complained that it left a strong taste in her mouth that made her sick.

Therefore, Michael would prepare those for her every time.

She took them and said softly, “Thank you.”

Michael smiled faintly and drove to his father’s private hospital again.

On the journey there, Monica did not say much.

She was not a person who could keep quiet no matter how hard she tried, but now, she seemed to have nothing to say to him.

Michael was suppressing his anger, but his expression remained gentle as always.

He took the initiative to ask again, “Is Finn treating you well?”

Monica was stunned.

Michael said, “I’m just asking. As a friend, I still care about what’s happening in your life.”

“It’s alright,” Monica answered after pondering for a while.

Other than the incident where Finn protected her with his life, he seemed to treat her the same as usual.

He was often quite fierce to her too.

“It seems like Finn is a man who is very good at taking care of people,” Michael murmured, with no emotion in his tone.

It was as if he was talking about daily life.

“No.” Seeing Michael being friendly, Monica also relaxed. Moreover, she was not someone who liked to hide things from people, so she said, “Finn isn’t as good at taking care of people as you are.”

“Is that so?”

“Yeah. He’s always so fierce,” Monica said with dissatisfaction.

Michael just chuckled as if agreeing with Monica.

Monica continued, “Finn definitely doesn’t know what I like to eat or what I like to do. Unlike you, you seem to know everything about me.”

“But I still can’t beat him because you like him.” Michael sighed faintly. It sounded like he was sighing helplessly.

Stunned, Monica turned to look at Michael. “I’m sorry.”

“It’s okay.” Michael smiled. “There’s no right or wrong in a relationship. All that matters is that you’re happy.”

“Michael,” Monica called out to him.

“Hm?”

“I’m really glad I dated you before and have an ex-boyfriend like you. I’ve always been afraid that after the breakup, you would hate me, or we would constantly be entangled. However, I’m grateful for your understanding and tolerance towards me.”

“Silly.” Michael smiled dotingly. “You can’t force a relationship.”

“Yeah.” Monica nodded hard.

That was right. They could not force a relationship, and that was why she could not force herself to be with Michael.

She really did love Finn very much.

In the car, the atmosphere was good as the two of them conversed.

There was no awkwardness after the breakup, and they were just chatting like two friends.

Once the car arrived at its destination, Michael parked the car and took the crutches out for Monica.

Monica leaned on the crutches and limped into the private ward with Michael.

When the two of them arrived at the door to the ward, Michael suddenly stopped, to which Monica turned to look at him.

Michael said, “My dad still thinks we’re dating.”

Monica nodded. “Okay. I know what to do.”

“Monica.” Michael wanted to say something but hesitated. He seemed to have mustered up a lot of courage before saying, “Can I hold your hand?”
