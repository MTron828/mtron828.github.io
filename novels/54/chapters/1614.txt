Shelly said, “I already knew that Zoe was cheating on you.”

Nox was stunned. He thought he had misheard.

Shelly continued, “Zoe would often go to the nightclub to have fun. Since I was also working at the nightclub at that time, I met her many times. I also met her a few times when I was working as a waitress in a high-class restaurant. By the way, do you remember the time you drank with Dr. Jones? Zoe was in the room next to yours with another man—”

“Shelly!” Nox interrupted him abruptly.

His voice was so loud that even Bella, who was asleep, was startled. The little girl beside them was also crying in fear because of the sound.

The little girl’s father was angry again. “Are you done?!”

Having been scolded again, Nox suppressed the displeasure he felt and dragged Shelly out.

Shelly turned to look at Bella. When she left the room, she could not help but say to the man beside her, “Sir, please help me keep an eye on my daughter. If she wakes up, call me.”

“Should I call the police?” the man asked as he did not think the two of them looked like husband and wife.

“Not at the moment.”

She said not at the moment because if Nox was really too unreasonable, she would call the police.

When Nox heard Shelly’s words, he was furious. What did she mean by “not at the moment”? Who did Shelly think she was? What could he do to her anyway?

Nox dragged Shelly to the emergency stairway, where there was a fire door, so she could not hear anything from the ward at all. In other words, she would not be able to hear Bella calling her when she woke up.

A little angry about that, Shelly pushed Nox away. Nox took a few steps back, and behind him were the stairs. Did Shelly want him dead?

“What are you trying to do, Nox?” Shelly flew into a rage. “I already said that I knew about Zoe cheating on you a long time ago. Now that it’s been exposed, it’s all the same to me. What can I feel? I don’t feel happy! I just thought it was a little funny. There was no other meaning. Regarding what you said about me thinking that I have another chance…”

Shelly paused for a moment, telling herself not to get too agitated.

She took a deep breath to calm herself down before saying, “If I really wanted to be with you again, I would have told you about Zoe cheating on you. I

wouldn’t have waited for your grandfather to expose you.”

“You, you, you!” Nox was so angry that he could not say anything else.

He did not expect Shelly to have known all along. What was even more unexpected was that Shelly knew and did not tell him. She watched as he was deceived by Zoe like she was watching a joke. How could Shelly be so cruel?

“By the way, I also took 200 thousand dollars from Zoe. Don’t you know that?” Shelly decided to tell Nox everything so that Nox would not think that she was fantasizing about being with him. “That 200 thousand dollars was to shut me up and make sure I didn’t tell you that she cheated on you. I gladly accepted it.”

Nox thought his life was a joke. The critical hits he had suffered during this period of time were getting more intense each time.

As he looked at Shelly, the cold-blooded and heartless woman, he did not believe that she had no feelings or fantasies about him. He even wondered if he had a chance with Shelly should he and Zoe fell out…

That’s right. When he heard his grandfather mention Shelly’s ward, he made a mental note of it. However, he could not control himself from going to Shelly’s ward to look for her, and that was when he saw her smiling at his news.

He was so agitated just now because he wanted Shelly to admit that she cared about him. In the end, the answer he got was not only that Shelly did not care, but she also chose to ignore it and even benefit from it.

Nox’s eyes were bloodshot as he was really furious. If his heart were a little weaker, he would have died. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He looked at Shelly fiercely, wishing he could strangle that woman.

Shelly pursed her lips. She also knew that she had gone a little overboard. However, if she did not clarify some facts, she would be causing trouble for herself, and Nox would be a really big problem..
