Chapter 158: I’ll Never Sleep With the Woman I Don’t Like

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Teddy!” Edward did not care about Melody’s breakdown at all.

Teddy hurriedly went forward. “Fourth Master.”

When the Fourth Master set his mind to it, he could really make someone go mad.

The dignified third princess of the Sanders was already going crazy.

“Send the guest out.”

“Yes.” Teddy said respectfully to Melody, “Ms.Sanders, this way please.”

Melody’s eyes were red.

She looked at Edward fiercely and then at Jeanne who was underneath Edward.

She would kill them.

She would definitely kill them.

“Ms.Sanders,” Eden called Melody softly.

At this moment, he really felt that he should leave.

Staying here would not bring any benefits.

At that moment, he really felt that his Uncle Edward might kill them for Jeanne.

His heart turned cold and he said in a low voice, “Let’s leave first.”

Melody looked at Eden coldly. She bit her lips tightly and suppressed her madness.

She turned around.

“Oh right.” Edward’s cold voice sounded behind her. “Ms.Sanders, you’d better not try to hurt my woman again. Otherwise, no matter how high your status is, I have 10,000 ways to kill you.”

Melody felt a chill down her spine.

She was stunned by Edward’s sinister voice.

She would not be threatened.

No!

In her life, she had never lost and never compromised.

At worst, they would perish together.

Melody left in anger.

Eden hurriedly followed.

When he left, he could not help but turn around and take a look.

“Eden.” Edward’s voice came from the room.

Eden hurriedly greeted “Uncle Edward.”

“Close the door.”

“...” Eden gritted his teeth.

In the end.

He closed the door for them.

As he was closing the door, he saw Edward approach Jeanne, who was on the bed.

Eden’s heart was incomparably frantic.

However, at that moment, he could only grit his teeth and leave.

Jeanne... was clearly his woman.

Now, he could only watch helplessly as she and another man... slept together.

He was unwilling!

Absolutely unwilling!

…

On the huge bed.

Jeanne just looked at Fourth Master Swan in front of her.

Melody and Eden left.

After the confrontation, she had a feeling that both Melody and Eden left with their tail between their legs.

This was the first time she felt Fourth Master Swan’s aura.

Such... shocking aura.

Without doing anything, he could already make people fearful.

She quietly calmed herself down.

She said, “Fourth Master, the show is over. Can you let go of me now?”

“Do you think it’s an act?” Edward approached her.

Jeanne smiled. “Your acting skills are very good.”

“Is that so?” Edward’s lips were close to her ear. His deep voice said, “Then I’ll let you see what real acting skills are.”

Jeanne’s body tensed up.

She was trembling slightly.

She felt that Fourth Master Swan was not joking at this moment, nor was he trying to scare her.

She deeply felt his threat.

She admitted it.

She was afraid.

She was even a little flustered.

She tried her best to remain calm and said calmly, “Fourth master, am I a prostitute?”

The man on top of her paused for a second.

The handsome face buried in her neck lifted up again and looked at her.

She could see the turmoil in his eyes…

However, in the next second, his eyes returned to normal.

Such a look made her even think that this man was poisonous.

So poisonous that she wondered if she had just said something she should not have, which affected his mood.

He said, “You’re not.”

It came out of his mouth in a dull voice.

Jeanne pursed her lips, trying to control her emotions.

“But I still need to... vent.”

“...”

In the room.

From start to finish, it was very quiet.

A lot of things happened quietly.

…

After Teddy sent Ms.Sanders and the Eldest Young Master away, he returned to the living room and saw Nox rushing over.

Nox opened his mouth and asked, “Where’s Fourth Master Swan?”

“Upstairs.”

“I’ll go look for him.”

“Young Master Winter.” Teddy hurriedly pulled him back. “It’s not convenient.”

Nox frowned and instantly understood. “Is Ms.Lawrence here?”

“Yes.” Teddy hurriedly nodded.

When Ms.Sanders and the Eldest Young Master went to the Fourth Master’s room just now, he had also gone.

He had also seen it.

He saw Fourth Master Swan push Ms.Lawrence onto the bed and kiss her passionately...

“Why are you blushing?” Nox stared at Teddy.

Teddy did not dare to say a word.

“You saw it?”

Teddy nodded silently.

“Intense?”

Teddy continued to nod silently.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
