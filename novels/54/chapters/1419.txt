Thank you readers!

She could not let herself be hurt again and again for the sake of a man like Nox.

With that, she pushed Nox away hard, but her body was pinned down.

At that moment, Nox was on top of her, tugging at her clothes roughly…

“Let me go, Nox! Let me go!” Shelly’s twisting body aroused the man’s desire.

It was the effect of alcohol, on top of an inexplicable sexual interest. At that moment, Nox really wanted to do something…

“Nox!” Shelly was about to go crazy.

Was he really unconscious when he was drunk? Did he know who the woman he was going to sleep with was?

Shelly opened her mouth to bite Nox’s neck with all her strength, and Nox stopped because of the pain.

In his mind, he thought, ‘Damn. I can’t believe she bit me, but damn, that feels great.’

After that, Nox started behaving differently… VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Shelly was almost driven crazy by Nox. She really regretted involving herself in

Nox’s mess. In her defense, she did not expect Nox to do such a thing to her

because she knew very well how much Nox despised her.

It was impossible for him to sleep with her again, so she was completely unprepared. However, she should have known that a drunk man could not be treated normally.

Shelly really did not know how to push Nox away.

At that crucial moment, Shelly suddenly shouted, “Nox, I’m Shelly! Are you crazy? Are you sleeping with Shelly now?”

Nox’s body stiffened.

He seemed to have heard the name “Shelly”. Was he hallucinating?

Shelly was so desperate that when she felt Nox’s body stop, she quickly said, “Nox, open your eyes and take a look. I’m Shelly. Open your eyes and take a look! ”

Nox really opened his eyes to see a pale face up close. Although it was very different from what he remembered, it was still Shelly’s face.

Suddenly, he came to his senses. His eyes went from confusion to shock to disgust… In the next second, he pushed Shelly off the sofa. It was as if he had touched something unclean.

Shelly was caught off guard and pushed down the sofa. Fortunately, the carpet under the sofa was very thick, so she did not hurt herself.

However, as the coffee table was not far away from the sofa, the sharp corner of the coffee table dug into her waist, causing Shelly to feel a sharp pain.

She gritted her teeth and endured the pain.

Before she could get up from the ground, she heard Nox’s voice trembling with anger. “Shelly, are you shameless?!”

Shelly was too lazy to argue with Nox, so yes, she agreed she was shameless. Anyway, in his heart, she was not a good person.

“Even after so many years, you still want to marry into our family, don’t you?!” Nox yelled at her.

She could feel how angry and humiliated he was, as if she had sullied him. However, she did not refute him and simply got up from the ground.

Since there was not much fabric on her body, Nox could see everything when she stood up.

Nox swallowed the words that he wanted to curse and shifted his gaze. However, he still felt a little angry. If Shelly was not shy about it, why the f*ck should he be?

He said to her, “Are you still going to seduce me in the future? Why don’t you look at your figure? So what if your breasts are big!”

Shelly pretended not to hear him. In any case, the more she talked to Nox, the more agitated he would become.

“Why? Are you still trying to seduce me? Let me tell you, I was drunk just now and didn’t know who I was making out with. If I knew it was you, I would never have touched a single strand of your hair—”

Shelly suddenly walked up to Nox.

Nox’s heart skipped a beat, and he stopped scolding her. It was as if he was frozen by Shelly.

“Move aside!” Shelly frowned.

Nox snapped back to reality.

“My clothes are behind you,” Shelly said bluntly.

Still, Nox did not move.

Shelly did not ask Nox again. Anyway, Nox never listened to a single word she said.

With that, she walked to Nox’s side and climbed onto the sofa to pick up her coat that Nox had thrown on the sand armrest.

Nox watched Shelly quietly..
