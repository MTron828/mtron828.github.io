1260 A Sudden Heartwarming Moment, Your Sister Will Be Named Phillipa

In reality, he clenched his fists and tried his best to hold the urge to turn around and hug her back countless times.

He did not know if she was being intimate at that moment because she was compromising on purpose so as to not cause any more conflicts between them or because she really wanted to get close to him.

As he held it in, his heart kept beating until…

“Edward, I’m sorry,” Jeanne suddenly said.

The man who was suffering suddenly trembled again.

“I thought that since my time is limited, I should let our feelings for each other fade away and rationally tell George to accept Susan and his new family in the future,” Jeanne said quietly as she buried herself in his back.

Edward’s body tensed up as he listened quietly.

“But now, I suddenly understand it all, and your father’s death also made me feel a little emotional. I think he still had many regrets when he died, and I don’t want to die like him. So, I don’t want to suppress my feelings anymore and push you away...”

Edward’s body was trembling, and he seemed to be trembling non-stop because of Jeanne’s words.

“Edward.” Jeanne buried her head deeper into his back.

In the end, she did not say the words “I love you”.

She believed there were some feelings that did not need to be said out loud yet they could both feel them.

At that moment, she saw Edward finally turning around to face her after suppressing his emotions and remaining silent for a long time.

Then, his large hands cupped her face. Although her face had become rounder, she was still beautiful.

He looked at her intently and saw the clarity in her eyes. With no more deceptions or hatred, her eyes were so clean and pure. She had really let go of her prejudice, her hatred, and her complaints about the world.

In fact, Old Master Swan was right. She still hated Edward, or perhaps she hated herself. She hated herself for not being strong enough and Edward for caring so much about her yet could not risk everything for her.

Now, she was really trying to let it go because two months were very precious. She would rather use those two months to love him properly than continue hurting him.

What did she say about keeping their distance and learning to forget each other?

They were still living together, so how could they forget each other?

It was just a way for her to torture him on purpose; it was just a way for her to express her anger.

With their eyes fixed on each other, she took the initiative to kiss Edward on the lips.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly. His eyes, which were still on her face, looked at her closed eyes as she kissed his lips.

His throat was moving up and down. His body was clearly at its limit of holding back, but at that moment, he could not move under her teasing. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Then, when he felt her little hand reaching into his clothes, his hand that was cupping her face slid to the back of her head, and he began to be proactive.

Their kiss deepened, and their lips entangled with each other’s as if there would not be a next time. Moreover, there was no gap between them when they kissed each other.

The temperature in the room was slowly rising until…

Jeanne suddenly grabbed Edward’s hand. “No.”

Edward’s eyes were filled with desire, and they were burning so intensely that it made her feel as though they could set her on fire.

In fact, under Edward’s teasing, she actually… felt the urge to go further. However, Finn said that it was very dangerous now for them to have sex.

She held Edward’s hand tightly, and their fingers interlocked, with their palms covered in sweat.

As her breath kept hitting his face, he was trying hard to suppress his desire. However, he suddenly lifted the blanket and was about to leave to take a cold shower.

He was so close to losing it that second just now. However, he knew very well that even if they went a little further and Jeanne did not stop him, he would not be able to continue because he would not hurt their child.

He thought that he could manage his desires and not lose control of himself when he was with her. Obviously, he had underestimated Jeanne’s influence in his life.
