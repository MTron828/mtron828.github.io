Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn took a few minutes to come out of the shower. When he came out and saw that Monica had fallen asleep, he carefully got on the bed, turned off the lights, and lay down beside Monica.

His body naturally embraced her and pulled her into his embrace. Just as he was about to fall asleep, Monica muttered, “Finn should watch more p*rn…”

She was clearly talking in his sleep. However, Finn heard everything she said, and his body stiffened.

Then, he recalled what Monica said about him in the Bamboo Garden that day… She said that if he was better in bed, she would not have broken up with him! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just how much did Monica despise him?

After Finn was done with the IV drip, he left the ward alone. He was really paying the consequences because he wanted to save his dignity. If he had known earlier, he would have gotten Zoe to take care of him.

He was drunk and sleepy as he walked into the elevator. Then, when the elevator suddenly opened two floors down, he saw… Shelly.

‘F*ck.’ Nox rubbed his eyes, but he really did see Shelly, who was also in the hospital. It was so late at night. What was she doing here?

Shelly was also stunned when she walked into the elevator. She had never expected to bump into Nox at such a late hour. If she had known earlier, she would not have gone to buy instant noodles now.

She and Bella had been in the hospital since the afternoon, waiting for the surgery tomorrow. Bella could not eat anything from that night onward, so she fasted with Bella. Now that Bella had fallen asleep, she went out to buy a packet of instant noodles to fill her stomach.

In fact, she did not feel like eating, but she knew she would feel hungry eventually. She also knew that she would have to take care of Bella after the surgery, so she had to eat, and that was when she bumped into Nox.

As soon as she got close to Nox, she could smell the strong smell of alcohol on Nox. Did that mean he was drunk? Was he too excited about tomorrow that he got drunk and had to come to the hospital for an IV transfusion?

At that moment, she could still see the traces of an IV drip on the back of his hand. However, in the next second, Shelly left immediately, not wanting to be with Nox or see him. At the thought that she could bump into anywhere, especially in a place like that hospital, she really felt helpless.

The moment Shelly exited the elevator, Nox grabbed Shelly and pulled her into the elevator angrily. “Where are you going? Am I that f*cking annoying?”

Shelly’s arm really hurt when Nox grabbed it. She knew that every time she met

Nox, she would be treated awfully.

She gritted her teeth. “Let go of me!”

“Do you think I’ll let you go just because you want me to?” Nox asked coldly, as if he was not someone to be trifled with.

Shelly really wanted to slap him, but she was shackled by Nox in the elevator. Then, the elevator went down a few floors and opened. However, Nox did not go out.

As it was late at night, the hospital was deserted, and no one else was around.

“Let me go!” Shelly twisted her body.

She did not know what had gotten into Nox.

“I won’t let go!”

“Are you crazy?” Shelly was infuriated. At that moment, she was so angry that her head hurt. Even the words that came out of her mouth were unfiltered. “If you’re sick, go to the doctor, not me. F*ck you, you psycho, retard, idiot… Oh.”

Shelly widened her eyes at Nox, who had suddenly pushed her into the elevator and kissed her fiercely. Shelly’s eyes were filled with anger, but she could not break free from him.

She did not know what was wrong with Nox again, but she narrowed her eyes and bit down, hurting Nox’s tongue.

Nox suddenly let go of Shelly. Then, he felt a metallic taste in his mouth. It was obvious that he was bleeding and quite a lot at that.

How ruthless was Shelly? He almost died from the pain.

“Are you awake?” Shelly did not rush to leave and was rather calm toward Nox.

Nox really wanted to strangle Shelly. What right did that woman have to be so arrogant in front of him?

“Nox, if I remember correctly, aren’t you getting married tomorrow?” Shelly looked at Nox and enunciated each word. “Why? Are you regretting marrying Zoe? Do you want to get back together with me? In that case, break off the engagement with Zoe and let me marry you tomorrow-”

“In your dreams!”

Nox frantically pressed the elevator button and bolted out. It was as if… he was running away from something terrifying.

Shelly stared at Nox’s back and sneered as she wiped her mouth. She would just take it that she was bitten by a dog..
