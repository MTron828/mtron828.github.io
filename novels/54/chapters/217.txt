Chapter 218: She and Fourth Master Swan Won’t Be Together

“If I leave, you might really get together with Fourth Master Swan,” George said.

“...” Jeanne did not even think that far ahead.

“I’d better stay by your side and watch you,” George spoke like a little adult. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jeanne smiled helplessly and caressed George’s small head.

She and Fourth Master Swan would not be together.

Whether or not there was so much as a spark between them.

In fact, they could not be together.

...

In the same city in a different black car.

Fourth Master Swan’s car drove toward the Swans’ manor.

Nox was a little active in the car.

He said, “Jeanne is too amazing. Once this lawsuit is over, she’ll really become famous in South Hampton City. She’ll become famous. How domineering is it to be known as the richest woman?!”

Edward ignored Nox and looked out of the window.

His mind was filled with the scene of Jeanne leaving with Kingsley.

“Speaking of which, the next lawsuit might not be an easy one,” Nox said bluntly, “I think Melody will think of ways to make Adrian, Tenda and Lunetta take the blame without implicating others. However, it’s hard to say. With Jeanne’s ability, she might already have evidence. She just has to wait for those people to act then give them a hard slap! The thought of it feels so good!”

Nox was very excited.

Edward and Finn did not comment.

Edward only felt that Jeanne might not pursue the matter further.

The accusation today was just in passing. She might not waste her energy to do these things alone.

She would definitely use a more direct and effective method to get what she wanted!

‘Jeanne.’

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

He repeated her name internally.

‘What exactly did Jeanne experience in those years abroad?!

‘What exactly is her identity now?!’

“Right.” Nox suddenly thought of something. “Finn, didn’t I tell you that we were investigating Micheal during this period?”

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“Micheal was probably not involved in Jeanne’s case,” Nox said bluntly, “If he was involved, Melody wouldn’t have done so many things herself.”

Finn did not show any emotion.

“That said, we’ll keep an eye on him. You should be careful too.”

Finn nodded.

The car arrived at the Swans’ manor.

Finn followed Fourth Master Swan and Nox into the manor.

Despite that, Finn did not spend much time with them. After all, he had work and was busy. Other than when Fourth Master Swan was unwell or if there was something special, he would not come at other times. Today, he had only come to check on Edward’s recovery.

Finn had asked Edward to rest, recuperate, and lie in bed…

Nevertheless, his advice as a doctor would be useless whenever Jeanne was in the picture.

Finn treated Edward’s wounds again.

Edward’s phone rang. He took a glance at the caller and picked it up.

A respectful voice came from the other side. “Fourth Uncle, do I go look for you at your place?”

“Why are you looking for me?” Edward asked back.

“... Didn’t you ask me to follow you?” Eden was a little surprised. “Aren’t you looking for me for something?”

“It’s nothing. I just said it casually.” Edward was indifferent.

“...”

“I’m resting. Don’t come and disturb me.”

After saying that, he hung up the phone.

Finn could not help but laugh.

‘Does Eden want to go against Fourth Master Swan?

‘He’s still too inexperienced!’
