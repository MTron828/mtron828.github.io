Chapter 203: Fiercely Defend to Turn the Tables

“You and Mr. Zimmer are really very close then, Mr. Wadler.” Judah once again made a conclusion.

Tenda did not refute.

“Just now, Mr. Zimmer said that you admitted that you and my client had a dual contract deal. May I ask how my client contacted you, trusted you, and cooperated with you when she just returned to South Hampton City for a month?” Judah enunciated each word clearly. He hit the nail on the head.

Tenda was a little nervous.

He said, “I don’t know why Jeanne trusted me. Perhaps she knew that I didn’t have enough funds, so she used me. I heard that she’s very capable in the business world. It shouldn’t be difficult for her to spot someone. So, on the eve of the Lawrence Enterprise’s tender...”

“The exact time, please,” Judah said coldly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“At 10:00 pm on September 23rd, Jeane came to me and said that she wanted to discuss a deal with me. I was a little hesitant at the time. At that time, I didn’t think about breaking the law. I was afraid that she would lie to me, asking me to deliberately submit a tender at a low price but not give me any profit in the end. However, Jeanne gave me a contract that she signed on the spot, and she even wrote down the specifications for the replacement of the materials in the contract. I saw that she was sincere, so I agreed to it.”

“Didn’t you notice that there was only a signature and no fingerprint in the contract?” Judah raised his eyebrow. “As the boss of a construction company, a contract without a handprint has no legal effect. It’s impossible for you not to know this.”

“I really didn’t notice at that time. In fact, I’m in debt. Some time ago, I lost nearly five million dollars in gambling. If I can’t pay it back, I’ll sell my company’s shares. I built the company from scratch. I don’t want to be bought by others, so I gritted my teeth and took the risk. I also followed Jeanne’s instructions and made a low-price tender.”

The reason given was very good.

“I have the loan shark’s settlement request note here.” Tenda seemed to be afraid that what he said was unbelievable, so he quickly showed his evidence.

The staff member took it from Tenda and handed it to the judge.

“If what you said is true, then the 30 million dollars in Jeanne’s account was from you?!”

“Yes, once the Lawrence Enterprise’s construction fund arrived, I called Jeanne. Our agreement was very clear. It was to be split 20-80 between us. Since the profit was 35 million dollars, I could only get 5 million dollars, and 30 million dollars would belong to Jeanne. There was some remaining amount beyond the 35 million dollars. If not for this sudden case, it would’ve been split the same way.”

“Did you personally call Jeanne?”

“Yes. I don’t trust others, so I did it myself.”

“Did you tell Jeanne after you transferred the money?”

“No. When Jeanne worked with me, she told me not to contact her too much. Of course, I knew that this matter was illegal, so the less contact we had, the better.”

“Didn’t you just say that you didn’t think too much about whether this is illegal or not?” Judah found a loophole.

Tenda was a little agitated. “I was talking about that time. I didn’t think too much at that time. I’m not stupid. Of course, I knew after that.”

“Okay.” Judah nodded.

He turned his head to face the judge. “Your Honor, I’ve finished asking my questions.”

Everyone at the scene felt that it was a little funny.

Judah had merely stated the matter once again. He did not defend Jeanne at all.

As expected, Jeanne and her lawyer were the same. They just looked grand for attention.

All of a sudden, everyone heard Judah say, “Next, I’ll officially begin to plead my client’s innocence.”

He suddenly had an imposing manner.
