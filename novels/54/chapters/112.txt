Chapter 113: I Helped Fourth Master Swan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward’s expression remained unchanged, obviously unmoved by her words.

He pushed Melody’s arm away. “I don’t want to waste Miss Sanders’ time. You should know very well that I already have someone I like.”

“Don’t lie to me. How could you like that woman, Jeanne? She is just an excuse for you to reject me.”

“I’m not that bored.”

“I won’t believe it!” Melody insisted.

“Whether you believe it or not is your business. I don’t care.” Edward did not even look at Melody. He stood up and was about to leave.

“Edward.” Melody was a little choked up. “Even if you don’t like me, I am still a member of Sanders. You should do your part and listen to my arrangements.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

“When I’m in the Swans’ territory, shouldn’t you do your duty as a host? Or should I tell my father that the Swans no longer take the Sanders seriously?”

Edward turned his head and saw Eden, who was just puking his guts out in the toilet.

“Are you planning to let a drunkard stay behind to accompany me?” Melody mocked.

“Since Miss Sanders has already said so, I will naturally accompany you to the end. Teddy!” Edward called out to Teddy who did not dare to leave the door.

“Yes.” Teddy hurriedly went over.

“The dishes are already cold. Change another table for Miss Sanders.”

“Yes.”

“In addition,” Edward gestured.

Teddy hurriedly bent down and approached Edward.

Edward whispered something in Teddy’s ear.

Teddy nodded and left respectfully.

At this moment.

Eden also came out of the toilet and said to Edward, “Uncle Edward, I’m not feeling very well, so I want to go back first.”

Edward glanced at Eden and nodded slightly.

Eden left.

When he left, the corners of his mouth curled into an evil smile.

He had two plans in mind tonight. Either he gets his Uncle Edward drunk and lets Melody send his uncle back, or he could get himself drunk and leave Melody Sanders and Uncle Edward alone.

In any case, it was just to let them be alone.

Eden sat in his car in discomfort and the driver drove him back.

He endured intense nausea and made a call.

Jeanne had just finished showering. She took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up.

“Jeanne, do you know who my Uncle Edward is with?”

Jeanne thought that Eden would talk about work matters.

After all, he had allocated 200 million interest-free loans to the Lawrence Enterprise today. She thought that he would be unwilling and called to make a fuss.

If she had known earlier that he would say these things, she would not have picked up at all.

She said, “Does it have anything to do with me?”

“Stop pretending to be aloof. Aren’t you trying to seduce my Uncle Edward? I know exactly what you’re thinking!”

“Since you know me so well, why are you asking me?” Jeanne’s attitude towards Eden Swan was basically indifferent.

“Let me tell you, Jeanne, my Uncle Edward is currently having dinner with Melody Sanders. He even chased me away to be alone with her.”

“So?”

“You’d better have some self-awareness. Don’t seduce my Uncle Edward!”

“Whether I can seduce him or not, that’s my business. There’s no need for Eldest Young Master Swan to worry.”

“Jeanne, how can you be so shameless...”

“There’s still a long distance between you and Jasmine Lawrence,” Jeanne mocked.

“Jeanne!”

“If you have nothing else to say, I’ll be hanging up.”

“You...”

Jeanne hung up directly.

Talking to this man was just a waste of time.

She put down her phone and prepared to go to bed.

The phone rang again.

Jeanne frowned and looked at the unfamiliar number on the screen.

She picked it up. “Hello.”

“Hello, Miss Lawrence. I’m Teddy.”

So it was Teddy.

To be honest,

Teddy was actually as annoying as Eden Swan.

However, at this moment, she still had to show her courtesy. “Mr.Dolittle, it’s already so late. Is there anything you need from me?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“My Fourth Master is looking for you, but it’s not convenient for him to make a call right now.”

All because Melody was there, right?

“Fourth Master is caught in some trouble right now. I hope Miss Lawrence can come to the restaurant where you were dining tonight. Fourth Master is waiting for you.”

“It’s too late. I’m really sleepy.”

“Fourth master said that if Miss Lawrence refuses, then the deal between the two of you will be invalid. He even asked Miss Lawrence to consider it carefully.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

This fellow actually threatened her.

She said, “I have to wake up early tomorrow, so I won’t be coming.”

“Okay, then I won’t disturb Miss Lawrence any longer,” Teddy said.

“Mr. Dolittle,” Jeanne said, “Help me pass a message to the Fourth Master.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne recorded a voice message and sent it to Teddy.

Teddy accepted it and then respectfully walked towards Edward who was sitting at the dining table.

At this moment, Melody was eating dinner alone.

Edward was really just purely accompanying her.

He did not eat, drink, or speak.

It was an extremely quiet space.

Teddy said, “Fourth Master, Miss Lawrence has something to say to you.”

Melody’s eyes moved slightly. She looked at Edward with an obviously unpleasant expression.

Edward took Teddy’s phone.

A few words appeared in the dialog box. “Turn on the speakerphone. The effect will be better.”

Edward smiled.

He actually smiled at his phone.

He had never smiled this entire night, but he smiled because of Jeanne’s words.

Melody tried her best to suppress her anger.

Edward turned on the speakerphone.

Jeanne’s unique gentle voice had a lingering charm at that moment. It was extremely pleasant to the ears. “Fourth Master, I have warmed the bed for you tonight.”

Edward’s thin lips pursed slightly. It was obvious that he was smiling.

Melody’s face darkened.

Edward clicked on the second voice message.

“Come back soon. I will wait for you.” It was said in an extremely ambiguous tone again.

Melody suddenly put down her chopsticks.

Edward looked very calm. He calmly handed the phone back to Teddy.

Teddy was actually shocked too.

He did not listen to Miss Lawrence’s voice message at all. He did not know that it was actually such... bold words.

Edward turned to look at Melody with his eyebrows raised slightly. “Miss Sanders, have you finished eating?”

“Edward, what do you mean?” Melody was so angry that her body was trembling.

“Do you still need me to explain in detail? What happens between an adult man and woman?”

“Edward Swan!”

“It’s rather late. If Miss Sanders has finished eating, you should leave soon. If anything happens to you, I really can’t take the risks. Teddy.”

“Yes.”

“Prepare a car for Miss Sanders and send her off.”

“Yes.”

Melody glared at Edward, holding back her anger.

She stood up from the chair.

She said, “Edward, one day you will regret treating me like this!”

Edward was indifferent.

Melody was from a noble family after all. After being treated like this, she could not bring herself to continue fawning on Edward.

She left in a huff.

Edward also left.

In the car.

Teddy sat in the front passenger seat, while Edward was in the back seat.

It was very quiet in the car.

“Teddy,” Edward called out to him.

“Yes.”

“Where’s your phone?”

“Ah?”

“Your phone.”

“Here.” Teddy quickly took it out.

“Give it to me.”

Teddy respectfully handed it over.

“Password.”

“What?”

“Cell phone password?”

“Fourth Master, cell phones are my privacy...” Teddy said weakly. When he met his master’s eyes, he said the password in a dejected manner.

Edward’s slender fingers carelessly swiped on Teddy’s cell phone screen.

Teddy was a little nervous.

After all, he would occasionally watch some things that were unsuitable for children. If his master knew about it, Teddy would lose his reputation.

“Teddy.”

“Master.” Teddy quickly agreed.

“Buy a new phone tomorrow.”

“My phone can still be used...”

Edward gave him a look.

“Yes.” Teddy could only agree.

His heart ached.

It was not that his phone was expensive.

There were... many out-of-print treasures inside. They were all wiped clean by the internet and could not be downloaded anymore.

Just like that.

Just like that, gone!
