1084 Great Satisfaction, Michael’s Tragic End

The judge and the jury studied the document carefully.

“Who issued this report?”

“Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team.” Monica enunciated each word clearly.

That was the world’s most high-end and authoritative research and development team. The products and many technologies they had developed were now at least 20 years ahead of Avalon’s medical treatment!

When the judge heard the news, he was a little shocked.

Logically speaking, a pharmaceutical research and development team like that would not accept a drug test report from Cardellini Pharmaceutical. Yet now, the document was clearly stamped with the seal of Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team.

“I’ve invited the person in charge of Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team, Ms. Lena.” Under everyone’s doubts, Monica went straight to the point.

“Your Honor, please allow our witness to appear in court,” Judah quickly said.

“Permission granted.”

With that, a foreigner appeared in the court.

To everyone’s surprise, Monica had invited the person in charge of Willis here.

It was already hard to accept that she had managed to get a report done, and now she even got someone to testify for her.

The court staff verified Lena’s identity in front of everyone. After making sure that it was Lena, Judah began to ask questions. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ms. Lena, may I ask if the document in my hand is the report issued by Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team?”

Leena took the document and confirmed, “Yes.”

“Ms. Lena, why did you help my client to produce such a report? As far as I know, Willis’s team has never accepted any pharmaceutical company’s test application.”

“Harken has an important member of my research team. He went through my team through the formal procedures and applied for us to run a test on Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s products. My team accepted his request.”

“May I know who’s the important member you mentioned?”

“This concerns the confidentiality of my team’s personnel, so I’m not going to tell you.” Lena refused.

In fact, it was understandable. Any team in an important field would keep their technical researchers a secret.

Just like Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development staff, they had always been kept confidential, if not for Michael stealing that information.

“In that case, can you swear in front of the Supreme Court of Harken that the test report in my hands is true and valid? That it is not fake?” Judah asked.

“In the name of the Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team, I swear to the Supreme Court of Harken that the test report that Willis International Pharmaceutical Research Team submitted to the court of Harken is true and valid. It is not fake.” Lina enunciated each word clearly.

Judah quickly looked at the judge. “Your Honor, can we determine through this document and Lena’s statement that this report is true and valid?”

The judge asked the jury, who then all agreed.

The judge concluded, “Based on the evidence presented by the plaintiff and the witness, it can be determined that the report is true and valid.”

“Thank you, Your Honor,” Judah said respectfully. Then, he said to Lena, “Thank you for appearing in court.”

Lena gave a small nod and left the court with the staff.

“Based on the evidence and witnesses provided by the plaintiff, it proves the possibility that Sunny Pharmaceutical stole Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development information. However, it can’t completely prove that they did it, nor can it be fully proven that Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s theft is related to the defendant, Michael!” The judge explained his argument.

“I still have a witness,” Monica said shamelessly.

Judah quickly said, “Your Honor, please allow our witness to go to court.”

“Permission granted.”

At that moment, Rob appeared in court.

Michael looked at Rob, and his expression was extremely cold.

Back then, he was the one who arranged for Rob to join Cardellini Enterprise. At that time, in order for him to get into the Cardellini Enterprise’s Research and Development Institute, he used his connection with Monica to send Rob in.

Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and endured it.

Rob did not even dare to look at Michael. At that moment, he appeared on the witness stand, a little nervous.

“May I know your name?” Judah asked.

“Rob Witherspoon.”

“What is your relationship with the defendant, Michael?”

“We’re distant relatives. My grandfather and Michael’s grandmother are biological siblings.”

“May I ask what’s your relationship with Cardellini Pharmaceutical?”

“Three months ago, I entered Cardellini Pharmaceutical under Michael’s arrangement.”
