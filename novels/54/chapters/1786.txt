Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now that the enthusiasm had passed, he was back to his normal self.

After dinner, Shelly received a call.

It was a call from a high school classmate. He said, “Shelly, I’m getting married this Saturday, and I’d like to invite you to my wedding.”

Shelly was not familiar with that classmate. However , because they had attended the class reunion that night, they were friends.

Shelly was not someone who would reject such a thing, so she said, “Okay, give me the details, and I’ll be there.”

“I wanted to send you the wedding invitation in person, but because I’ll be a little busy for the next two days, but I’ve asked Benjamin to send it to you. The details are on there, ” the other party said.

“Okay.” Shelly agreed immediately. “Congratulations in advance.”

“Thank you.”

Shelly congratulated him a few more times before hanging up. As she hung up the phone, another phone rang.

She looked at Benjamin’s call and slowly picked it up. “Hello.”

“Shelly, did Anthony call you just now?” Benjamin asked her in a casual tone, which was not much different from him talking to their other classmates.

“He did. He said he’s getting married on Saturday and has invited me to the wedding.”

“That kid invited everyone who was at the class reunion. He really knows how to seize the opportunity,” Benjamin joked.

“It’s rare for us to get married, and it’s such a big event in our lives.”

“Will you be there?”

“If I have nothing else, I will be there.”

“By the way, your wedding invitation is with me. I just got off work, so I’ll bring it to you now,” Benjamin said bluntly.

“You’re only getting off work now?” Shelly raised her eyebrows.

“I’ve just started working, and there are quite a lot of things to do. It’ll be fine once I get familiar with it,” Benjamin explained.

Shelly did not ask further. It was not suitable for the two of them to talk about anything too in-depth anyway.

“Where are you staying now?” Benjamin asked.

“It’s late. You should go home now and pass it to me when you have time. ” Shelly said, “You can pass it to me on Saturday.”

“Tell me where you’re staying now, and I’ll see if it’S convenient for me to pass it to you. If it’S not, I’ll pass it to you on Saturday.”

Shelly thought about it and told Benjamin the address.

“I live two streets away from you and will pass by your neighborhood on the way back. I’ll bring it to you right away. Give me ten minutes.” Benjamin made a prompt decision.

He did not discuss it with Shelly. He even hung up the phone after saying that.

Shelly felt helpless. She put down her phone and looked at Nox, who was playing games on the sofa.

Recently, Nox had returned to his usual routine, and he would play games when he had free time.

Seeing that Nox was having fun, Shelly did not disturb him. She went back to her room to change out of her home clothes before walking out of the house. Nox glanced at Shelly’s back and tried his best to not think about anything. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Shelly waited at the entrance of the neighborhood for a while before Benjamin drove a black car over and stopped the car beside her. As he opened the car door and got out of the car, Shelly was stunned as she thought Benjamin would take a taxi or walked over.

Benjamin also noticed Shelly’s confusion and said, “It’s the company’s car.”

Shelly smiled. “Congratulations.”

Benjamin also smiled.

He handed the wedding invitation to Shelly. “There are two here, and one is for Sarah. I won’t look for her alone. You can give it to her when the time comes.”

“Alright.” Shelly took it.

“Will you really be there?” Benjamin asked. “Probably.” Shelly said, “What about you?”

“I should be there,” Benjamin answered.

Then, the two of them smiled in a similar manner. “It’S getting late. You should head back early.”

“Alright.” “Don’t forget to eat dinner.”

“Yes. ”

“Bye-bye.” Shelly waved her hand and walked away from Benjamin with two wedding invitations in hand.

“Shelly.” Benjamin suddenly stopped her.

Shelly turned around. “What’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing.” Benjamin held his tongue. “See you on Saturday.”

“Alright.”

As Shelly walked into the neighborhood, her mood changed. She understood Benjamin’s hesitation. However, no one broke the silence because once it broke, they would not be able to have each other in their lives anymore.

As for her… she hoped that she could be friends with Benjamin. There was no need for them to become complete strangers. With that thought in mind, Shelly took a deep breath and adjusted her emotions for a long time before striding home.

Meanwhile, Nox saw the entire process of the two of them meeting. He watched as Shelly and Benjamin talked, laughed, and endured the discomfort of being separated. Thinking about it, it was he who ruined their relationship, and he smoked one cigarette after another on the balcony.

When Shelly came back and saw Nox standing on the balcony, she did not disturb him. Nox was a heavy smoker, and she did not like the smell of cigarettes, so she would not usually go near them. Nox turned to look at Shelly’s cold back and smiled. In the end, a forced relationship would not last..
