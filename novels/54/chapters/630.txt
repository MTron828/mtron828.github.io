Chapter 631: The Identity of Jeanne’s Mother Exposed, Alexander’s Tragic Ending

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“In other words, she wanted to take Lawrence Enterprise as her own! Your mother could also give the company to you to give you a better life!” Alexander refuted Jeanne.

“My mother wasn’t short of money.” Jeanne said, “Where do you think my tens of billions came from?”

Alexander stared at her with wide eyes.

Half of it was what her mother left her, and the other half was... Kingsley’s.

Jeanne said, “Moreover, with my mother’s ability, if she wanted the Lawrence Enterprise, wouldn’t she get her hands on Lawrence Enterprise’s shares? Yet, she didn’t take any of the company’s shares, which showed that even though she was in charge of managing the company, it still belonged to the Lawrences.”

Alexander clenched his fists.

He did not want to believe it.

He refused to believe that Penelope did not want Lawrence Enterprise for herself!

His expression was ugly as he said fiercely, “If she really didn’t want Lawrence Enterprise, why did she refuse to let go of the company’s management rights? Isn’t that contradicting?”

“Of course not.” Jeanne said, “It was because you guys were too stupid. If she didn’t hold on to the management rights, you guys would try your best to stop her from making decisions. Then, how can she develop Lawrence Enterprise to greater heights? She only did it to prevent you guys from dragging her down.”

Alexander still did not believe it. To be more precise, he did not want to believe that he had misunderstood Penelope.

Jeanne said, “If it weren’t for you killing my mother back then, the current Lawrence Enterprise would probably be on par with the current Swan Enterprise. Then, why would you need to constantly curry favor with the Swans?”

“I won’t believe your nonsense. I won’t believe it!” Alexander said with certainty. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was clear that he was starting to feel guilty.

Jeanne said, “It’s fine if you don’t believe it. I just wanted to explain everything to you before you die. At least now you know how stupid your decision to kill my mother back then was. Although you didn’t have a wife who loved you very much, you could at least have unlimited wealth and glory. And although you couldn’t disclose it, at least you had a family with two children. But unfortunately, you had to ruin such a good thing going for you.”

“I didn’t!” Alexander roared angrily as if it had hit his nerve. He raged on. “Your mother deserved to die for scheming against me like this! I didn’t do anything wrong. I didn’t do anything wrong!”

“That’s right. Whether you regret it or not, that’s your business. But let me tell you, the Lawrence Enterprise that originally belonged to the Lawrences will, just as you thought, fall into my hands, someone who isn’t a Lawrence. I, who am not a Lawrence, will also tear your family with two children apart. They would wish they were dead!” Jeanne looked at Alexander going mad. “This is the retribution you received for choosing to kill my mother back then. Are you satisfied with this retribution?”

“Jeanne!” Alexander roared heart-wrenchingly.

Nevertheless, Jeanne kept her indifferent attitude toward him.

The truth was as such. If Alexander did not have the heart to kill her mother back then, he would not end up in the position he was today.

Unfortunately, Alexander was too cruel.

Her mother might not have thought that Alexander would be so cruel, or perhaps she did, but she did not think the Lawrences could touch her with their ability.

Jeanne suppressed her emotions.

All these years, she had endured it.

Ever since Kingsley told her about the cause of her mother’s death, she had been harboring hatred deep inside her.

Now that Jonathan was dead, and Alexander was about to die, the Lawrences would be hers sooner or later.

Then, Jenifer and Joshua would probably seek their own death.

The entire Lawrence family would soon be in shambles.

Now, her revenge was half complete. As to the other half…

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

One day, it would all be avenged!

With that, she got up and left the detention center.

For her, seeing Alexander with this ending was enough.

When she walked out of the detention center, Finn was leaning against the car and smoking.

Seeing Jeanne come out, he put out the cigarette and got into the car.

Finn drove Jeanne back, and the two of them did not talk much on the journey.

They were not that close even though they had two important people who were very close to each other.

The car soon arrived at Bamboo Garden.

However, Jeanne did not get out immediately, and Finn did not urge her to.
