855 Monica’s Extreme Counterattack, a Struggle Between Life and Death

Monica glanced at Elsa.

Elsa looked serious. “For someone like you, with your chest, waist, buttocks, long legs, and fair and tender skin…”

She was even shameless enough to touch Monica.

“After your touch, which man would still fall for another woman? Which man would be able to leave your bed after sleeping with you? You’re simply the best.”

Monica sneered.

If she told Elsa that there was not only such a person but had made her so nauseous she vomited the next day after they slept together, would Elsa doubt her life?

“Leave one of your young hunks for me tonight,” Monica said.

“What?” Elsa was still admiring Monica’s figure. Even as a woman, she was a little seduced.

“Him. The one with the best figure.” Jeanne pointed at one of the men dancing on the dance floor.

“What are you going to do with him?” Elsa was baffled.

“Just give him to me.”

“I’ll give you whatever you want, but are you sure? You’re getting married next month. Dancing is just testing the waters on the edge of being a good woman. If you get caught doing something immoral by someone, you’d really be drowned in a pig cage!”

“Don’t ask so many questions. Get him to come with me at 10 p.m.”

“…”

After drinking for quite some time, Monica was not in the mood to dance anymore. At 10 p.m., she left with the young hunk.

He was flattered that Monica picked him and followed her into a car. As soon as they got in, Monica said the name of a certain hotel. The young hunk was even more excited now. His blood surged at the thought of Monica’s touch on his body while they were dancing last night.

When the car arrived at its destination, Monica got out of the car, the young hunk trailing behind her.

Monica looked left and right. After confirming that all the people she was looking for were there, she brought the young man to the side of the hotel entrance. It was a little dark, but one would still be able to clearly see their faces.

“Corner me against the wall,” Monica instructed.

“Of course.” The hunk smiled handsomely.

He immediately pushed Monica against the wall outside the hotel, tightly pressing her petite body against him. Then, the young hunk lowered his head and leaned over.

“If you dare kiss me on the lips, I’ll beat you to death.” Monica threatened.

The young hunk froze. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Don’t you know how to act?” Monica whispered in the young hunk’s ear.

“...It’s a little difficult.” The hunk said bluntly. The feeling of not being able to taste a sexy stunner right in his grasp was simply terrible.

Monica took out a stack of money she had prepared earlier from her clothes, placing it between their bodies.

The hunk’s eyes lit up. For people like them who came out to play with rich women, money was their main priority.

“Do well, and I’ll double it.”

As she spoke, she reached down and put the stack of money into the young hunk’s pocket. It was dark, and the two of them were very close. Monica’s actions made it look as if she had put her hand into the pants of a young hunk.

“Oh my God.” The hands of the reporter who took a video of Monica yesterday were trembling.

Monica was going overboard, so far as to ask him to take pictures of her in public. So he flashed many photos and recorded a few more videos.

At this moment, on his camera screen, the man on top of Monica was kissing her impatiently from her face all the way to her neck. His hand had even reached into Monica’s windbreaker unruly, and it looked like…

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

The two of them canoodled outside for a long time before Monica pulled the young hunk into the hotel.

The reporter sat in the dark, looking at the content he had taken in a daze.

If it were anyone else, it would definitely be big news. However, for Monica… it was just a little too tame.

He reluctantly placed the memory card at the front desk of the hotel. This was what he had previously agreed with Monica. Once he was done, he would hand the memory card to the front desk, and Monica would get it herself.

Sure enough, Monica came down from the hotel room half an hour later. After taking the memory card from the front desk, she took a taxi back to the Cardellini villa.

She excitedly turned on the computer and inserted the memory card.

“…”

Monica was dumbfounded. Did those two scam her?!

Although the young hunk’s lips never touched her throughout the whole process, his hand only reached into her windbreaker and had not touched her at all. While she was only putting money in the hunk’s hand, the photos and videos made it look like...
