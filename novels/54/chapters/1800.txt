Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Isn’t this my usual way to get rid of you? You don’t have to feel like you’re taking advantage of me. I’ve always been generous to women, ” Nox said bluntly.

His voice was so cold that Shelly felt that she was nothing to Nox — not a woman he had proposed to.

“You’ve been with me the longest, so I’m giving you more. Keep it. It might come in handy in the future,” Nox said calmly.

Shelly realized she had thought too highly of herself. Nox was giving her money to dismiss her just like how he dismissed other women. There was no special meaning behind it.

“Alright,” Shelly agreed.

Since Nox had said so, she would accept it.

“In that case, sign the documents and hand them over to Mr. Logan,” Nox said emotionlessly.

“Sure.”

“I’ll hang up now.”

“Nox,” Shelly suddenly called out to him.

“Hmm?” Nox held his phone tightly, but his tone was cold.

“Did the blind date go well?”

“It went well. We’re meeting each others’ parents tomorrow and getting married in a week,” Nox said straightforwardly.

Shelly felt a sharp pain in her heart. However, it was not excruciating, as if it had happened before.

She said, “Congratulations.” “Thank you.”

“I’ll leave it at that. Goodbye.”

“Goodbye.”

When the call ended, Shelly looked at the scenery outside the balcony, and her vision was a little blurry. She smiled and thought, was that not the ending she wanted the most?

She took a deep breath before returning to the living room and started eating with Bella. From now on, she and Nox would have nothing to do with each other anymore. However, life with Bella was pretty good too.

Two days later, the news of Nox’s wedding went viral on all the major news websites. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Who would have thought that Nox was getting married again? It seemed like it was only yesterday when that bizarre thing happened at his last wedding, and he was getting married again now.

Most importantly, the identity of the bride this time was mysterious. Shelly heard that the Winters kept her protected very well by hiding her identity because they did not want her to be disturbed by the media.

Anyway, Nox, the most eligible bachelor in the country was finally getting married, and Shelly was calm as she watched the news. It seemed like Nox really meant it when he said he would get married in a week.

She watched for a while and was about to put her phone down when it rang. Only then did Shelly remember she had not returned Benjamin’s calls for the past two days. It was not intentional. In fact, she had really forgotten about it. She picked up the call. “Ben.” “Shelly, Nox is getting married.”

“I saw the news.”

“I didn’t expect him to get married so fast.”

Shelly did not expect it either. However, Nox had always been unpredictable. Moreover, he had been a heartless person since he was young. To him, a relationship would come and go quickly. “Shelly, about what we talked about that day…” Benjamin wanted to say something but stopped.

He wanted an answer from her.

She said, “I’m sorry, Ben. I think we’ve missed the chance to be together.”

Benjamin tightened his grip on the phone.

“I always thought I still liked you and that you were probably the only person I liked in my entire life. But when I was considering whether I should be with you, I suddenly realized that I didn’t want to anymore. Once a relationship is over, it’s over. To me, we’re just friends now.” Shelly voiced her thoughts.

Benjamin remained silent.

“It seems that relationships can’t withstand the torment.” Shelly chuckled. “Ben, thank you for liking me and for allowing me to feel what it’s like to be loved. I cherish the relationship we once had, but in the future… I’m sorry.”

“It’S alright.” Benjamin said with some discomfort, “You can’t force a relationship.”

“You’re a good man. You’ll meet a better girl.”

“Yes,” Benjamin replied, and his voice sounded a little choked up.

He had always thought that Shelly would be with him if she broke up with Nox. As long as there were no obstacles in the way, Shelly would return to his side. He also assumed that Shelly still liked him, iust like how he still liked her. Unfortunatelv, Shellv thought that their relationshiD was in the Dast.

It took him a long time to calm down and ask, “Shelly, do you like Nox?”

“No,” Shelly denied firmly.

“I heard that the best way to forget someone is to fall in love with another person.” Benjamin said quietly, “In other words, it’S because you’ve fallen in love with another person that you don’t love the person you once loved.”

Shelly’s heart skipped a beat. That thought had never crossed her mind.

“Actually, Nox…” Benjamin wanted to say something but stopped himself. “I just want you to be happy.”

“I want you to be happy too,” Shelly said sincerely.

“I’ll hang up now.”

“Alright.” “Goodbye, Shelly.”

“Goodbye, Benjamin.”

After they hung up, Shelly stared at her phone in a daze. In a few days, two men had disappeared from her life.

In the end, her days would return to their usual dullness, just like back then, when it was only her and Bella. In fact, with only Bella by her side, she led a pretty good life.

At midnight on the day before Nox’s wedding, Shelly’s phone rang. She did not have the habit of turning her phone off to silent mode because she did not have many friends and no one would look for her. Hence, she was a little shocked when she heard her phone ring. She looked at the unknown number and picked it up. “Hello.”

“Shelly, it’s me, Candice, but also Jeanne,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Shelly pursed her lips. She had heard Monica blurting out Jeannie several times, so she could kind of figure it out. However, there were many secrets that the public could not know, so she pretended not to know. She did not expect Jeanne to tell her so bluntly. “I’ve told you honestly who I am just so you can trust me.”

“I trust you,” Shelly quickly said.

“In that case, let me tell you about Nox. I don’t want to put you in a difficult position, and I don’t want to add to your burden. If you were with Benjamin, I definitely wouldn’t disturb you. But since you’re not together with him, there are some things I need to tell you.”

“Please speak.” Shelly was very modest.

Somehow, she could not reject Jeanne, whether it was because of her identity or how she was treating her at the moment.

“Nox, that idiot, is drunk now.” The first thing Jeanne said was to criticize Nox.

Shelly was stunned.

“He’s so p*ssed drunk that we can’t drag him out of the nightclub, ” Jeanne said in exasperation.

Shelly did not seem to understand why Jeanne was telling her that.

“You know that Nox is getting married tomorrow, right?” Jeanne returned to the main topic.

‘Yes,” Shelly replied.

“But this guy is suddenly going back on his word and saying he doesn’t want to get married anymore. He has told Edward to send him overseas overnight.” Shelly was speechless at how childish Nox was.

“He said he wants to be alone for the rest of his life.” “Nox might’ve said that because he’s drunk. It’ll be fine when he wakes up tomorrow.”

“Do you think Nox will be fine?” Jeanne asked.

“He never sticks to what he says. He’ll think differently tomorrow.”

“Well, he’s calling your name now. Should we ignore him and wait to see if he recovers tomorrow?

Jeanne asked Shelly..
