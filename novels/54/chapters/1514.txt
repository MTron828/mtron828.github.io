Chapter 1515: Candice Recovers Her Memories, Jeanne Is Alive

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She said, “Can you pass a message to Edward?” “Tell me,” Finn agreed immediately.

“Tell him not to kill the Hills.”

Finn was silent as he probably did not expect that. It had been so long, yet she still had memories. Moreover, her dosage was already shockingly high. Finn replied, “I can only pass on the message.”

It meant that nothing could be changed, and from the looks of it now, nothing had changed. As expected, Edward did not hold back when it came to the Hills.

It was not that she could not understand his reasoning for doing so. After all, the existence of the Hills was a threat to the Duncans or the Swans, and there would always be some loyal assassins from the Hills who would take the risk and choose to take revenge. For the sake of his safety, he would choose to eliminate the threat, and that was one of the reasons.

The second reason was that, as an assassin family, the Hills had once thrived because they had a connection to the country’s regime, and many assassin organizations wanted to follow suit. In order to prevent that from happening, they could only exterminate the Hills so that those assassin organizations would not dare to cause trouble.

There would not be another assassin family or organization like the Hills that would become a future threat to the regime.

While thinking about some things in the past, Jeanne pushed open the rusted iron gate of the Hills and walked in with George.

Inside, it was barren. The once splendid and magnificent scene had long become history. She did not know what Kingsley would do if he saw all of this; he would probably go crazy!

After all, the Hills that had existed around for so many years had been destroyed in his hands. Any successor of a family would feel that they had let down their ancestors. Yet, she was still so cruel as to bring Kingsley’s ashes back.

She held George’s hand and walked straight to the Hills’ cemetery, which was

inside the manor. Every member of the Hills would be buried there after they died.

Kingsley had once said that if he was going to die, he would be buried here, to return to where he came from. Hence, she dug Kingsley out of the ground in South Hampton City and brought him here.

Looking at the densely packed tombstones inside, she found herself a little emotional.

“Mom,” George called her.

He seemed to be worried that she would not be able to accept it. However, Jeanne smiled faintly.

In fact, there was nothing that she could not accept. After all, Kingsley had been dead for so many years.

She squatted down and found an empty space. She said, “Let’s bury Kingsley here.”

“Alright.” George nodded. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jeanne went to find a shovel and began digging the soil bit by bit, with George helping her from the side. Once the two of them had dug a deep grave, Jeanne opened the suitcase and took out the ashes inside. Then, she buried the ashes in the soil.

In the end, her vision blurred. The Kingsley in her memories was powerful, glorious, and insufferably arrogant. Now, he had been reduced to ashes.

George’s eyes reddened as well. As he buried the ashes in the soil, his tears fell into the soil.

The two of them were silent until they finally buried Kingsley.

“George, do you think Lucy should be buried next to Kingsley?” Jeanne asked George.

George was sobbing. However, he kept holding it in and stopped himself from crying out loud.

Jeanne, too, had been holding back her tears. Sometimes, the sudden death of the person was not the cause of grief. It was from suddenly thinking about the person and knowing that they would never be around again.

She picked up the shovel and dug a deep grave right next to Kingsley’s.

She did not know whether Kingsley had ever loved Lucy in his life or whether Lucy was willing to stay by Kingsley’s side. As stubborn as she was, she just wanted them to have a companion after death, hoping that they could be together in the end.

After they buried the two of them, Jeanne left with George and walked into the empty manor building.

She returned to her room, which was filled with dust. Hence, she did a simple cleaning.

“George, let’s just make do for now.”

“Alright.” George nodded.

After all, they were all tired after a full day of traveling.

As the two of them lay on the same bed, George asked Jeanne, “Mom, where are we going next?”

Jeanne looked at the ceiling above her and suddenly felt that the world was huge. It was as if no place was her home..
