1211 Accompanying Jeanne For A Pregnancy Checkup, Nox’s Condition Improves

“It’s not magical at all.” Jeanne put the clothes down.

Edward looked up.

“Isn’t it all the same? He was sent away in the end anyway.” Then, she walked out of the room.

Edward smiled.

George’s departure had probably become a thorn in Jeanne’s heart that could not be removed.

When he walked out of the room, Finn and Jeanne were talking about some things to take note of during her pregnancy.

Edward sat down and listened quietly.

“When you’re seven months in, I don’t recommend you both sleep together in the same room,” Finn said.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered, and Edward glanced at Finn.

“It’s because you’re back, and that’s why I want to remind you of that. The baby is very big now, and it would be easy to hurt her. Also, sharing the same room can easily cause premature labor, so you need to be careful,” Finn said.

If he said the word out loud, he would feel embarrassed instead.

“Yes,” Jeanne replied.

“These are the things you need to take note of this month,” Finn said. Then, he seemed to have thought of something. “Jeannie, are you planning to give birth naturally?”

“Yes.”

“If it’s a natural birth, I suggest you watch your diet. The baby looks a little chubby now, which means it might be more difficult for you to give birth naturally.”

“I also think my belly has grown especially fast this month.”

“Anyway, just pay a little attention to it,” Finn said with a smile.

“Alright.”

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.” With that, Finn got up and left.

Before he left, he glanced at Edward and said, “Are you free? Let’s go and see Nox.”

Edward glanced at Jeanne, who walked away from them.

Finn looked at Jeanne and turned to look at Edward. “Did you both quarrel?”

“I sent George away.”

“To where?”

“Where we used to be.”

Finn was stunned. Then, he asked, “Alex told you to do it.”

“Yes.”

“He’s too possessive of you.” Finn enunciated each word.

Edward did not seem to want to talk about it. He said, “Let’s go and see Nox.”

The two of them left Bamboo Garden and went straight to Nox’s private apartment. Other than Nox, there were two other servants in the apartment.

At that moment, Nox had just finished his treatment and was lying on the sofa like his life was devoid of meaning. His entire body was drenched in sweat.

In fact, the so-called health treatment was torture, so the recovery process was brutal.

Nox gasped as he looked at the two men in front of him, thinking that he was hallucinating. He cursed, “Damn it. I haven’t had a woman for a few months, and I’m even starting to miss men.”

Edward could not help but laugh, and Finn smiled as well.

Wherever Nox was, it would always be fun. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Holy sh*t, you guys are real!” Nox reached out and touched the person in front of him.

He could not help but be surprised.

“Did you think we were ghosts?” Edward was speechless.

“Aren’t you supposed to be busy all day? How do you still have the time to care about me?” He sounded jealous.

At that moment, he sat up from the sofa with the help of Finn.

“I’m done. Alex gave me three months off.”

“Is he that kind?” Nox did not believe him.

“I’m waiting for Jeanne to go into labor.”

“I knew it! You did it for that woman!” Nox was still very prejudiced against Jeanne.

It was not because Jeanne made him a cripple, but because of Jeanne’s attitude toward Edward.

He had always felt that Edward loved Jeanne so much that he could die for her, but Jeanne treated Edward… She could turn hostile against him with just a snap of her finger.

“Are you feeling better?” Edward immediately changed the topic.

In fact, Edward had come to see Nox before. However, because she was too busy later on that he did not have time.

“It’s alright.” Nox said, “The doctor said there’s still room for improvement.”

“Can you feel your legs?”

“I feel a little numb.” Nox said, “I don’t know if it’s an illusion or not.”

At that moment, Finn used his hand to press hard on the nerves in Nox’s leg.

“Hiss.” Nox grinned.

Finn’s expression changed at that moment.

...

Edward, who was standing at the side, looked nervous.

Finn used a little more strength.

“Can you be gentler?” Nox could not help but curse.

The moment he cursed, he was also stunned. He looked at Finn in disbelief. “Was I screaming in pain just now?”

Finn was speechless at Nox.

“Congratulations,” Edward said. His voice sounded a little emotional.

“I can actually feel pain.” Nox touched his thigh, feeling a little too excited.

“I told you. A person like you would not have too bad of luck.” Finn could not help but smile.

He did not think that Nox would be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life.

“Help me up. I need to walk two steps.” Nox was extremely excited.

“You’re only feeling pain. It’s not time for you to walk yet. Just follow the doctor’s instructions and do your rehabilitation. Don’t rush things,” Finn reminded Nox.

...

“A month at most.” Nox boasted, “I’ll run to see you.”

It was typical of Nox to act like that. All they had to do was compliment him a little and he would be walking on air.

Finn could not help but say a few words to Nox, but obviously, Nox did not listen to him.

The three of them stayed in Nox’s house for half the afternoon.

Although Nox was very reluctant to let them leave, he did not want them to know for the sake of his dignity.

Hence, he watched them leave and took a deep breath.

As expected, now that they had all grown up, they would be separated. When they were young, their only support at the training base was each other, but now, things were different.

Nox sat in the wheelchair and could not help but touch his legs. Then, he pinched himself hard.

‘F*ck!’

Where did Finn pinch him? Why did he not feel any pain when he pinched himself?

However, he did not care anymore. In any case, he was about to regain his dominance!
