Chapter 260: A Close Call

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

She asked Micheal, “Aren’t you scared?”

“I’m scared—I’m scared to death,” Micheal said. As he said that, he even laughed at himself, “But I know that you want to see Jeanne as soon as possible. You want to know how she is! So even if I’m scared of death, I’ll try my best to keep up!”

Monica’s heart palpitated.

She said, “Thank you, Micheal.”

‘Thank you very much.’

Micheal smiled dotingly. “Silly.”

At that moment, he stepped on the accelerator again and sped up.

It was because the car in front of him had sped up even more.

Micheal gritted his teeth.

The reason he did not care about anything else was to cater to Monica. He knew that Monica wanted to see Jeanne, but most importantly, he also wanted to see the outcome. He wanted to see the final outcome between Melody and Jeanne. At the same time, he also wanted to see how extraordinary Edward and the others were!

He had a feeling that he had to know himself and his enemies.

His eyes narrowed.

The speed of the car was getting faster and faster.

At this moment, in the crazy car in front.

Fourth Master Swan was driving at an incredibly fast speed. When he stepped on the accelerator, he was not going in a clear direction. It was as if he was just making himself move. Once he knew the direction, he might rush over even faster.

Finn was trying his best to maintain his balance as he used Monica’s phone in the fast-moving car.

At this moment, the phone screen had shattered.

After going through so much tonight, Monica’s phone had been smashed many times.

Fortunately, Monica at least remembered to bring her phone with her.

Finn looked at the phone screen.

Of course, he was not looking at the pretty selfie on Monica’s lock screen. Instead, he was calmly thinking about the password on her phone.

He pursed his lips.

Then, he entered Monica’s birthday number.

The phone was unlocked.

Finn made a call according to Fourth Master Swan’s instructions.

“Fourth Master, it’s connected,” Finn said.

Then, he put the phone on speaker.

Edward said coldly, “This is Edward. I have three things for you to do.”

“Yes, Fourth Master.” The person on the other end instantly became respectful.

“First, look for a sedan with the car plate AXXXXX and tell me where it is now. Second, look for the location of the base station where the phone number 1390XXXX6366 made the last call. “Third, look for the location of the base station where the phone number 1390XXXX8888 made the last call,” Fourth Master Swan instructed.

“Got it.”

Seeing that Fourth Master Swan had finished his instructions, Finn quickly hung up the phone.

The next moment, Finn made another call.

“This is Edward.” Edward’s voice was cold. There was no trace of panic in his voice. “Mobilize everyone in the city to search for Jeanne’s whereabouts! If you have any news, call me immediately!”

“Understood.”

After making the call, Edward continued to drive crazily on the streets of South Hampton City.

He did not know where Jeanne was, but at this moment, he seemed to have a strong sense of purpose and drove very fast in one direction.

After ten minutes or maybe less, the phone in Finn’s hand rang.

Finn hurriedly picked up the call and put it on speaker.

The person who called respectfully reported, “Fourth Master, the car fell off the highway in Landford Village at around 12:10 am and fell into the farmland down the hill. The police are currently on camera, but there’s no one in the car at the moment. The car is badly damaged.”

Finn saw Fourth Master Swan tighten his grip on the steering wheel.

“The last call from the number 1390XXXXXX6366 was made at the Lawrences’ manor. The call was made at 4:00 pm yesterday,” the person continued.

So, Jeanne did not have time to call for help.

“The last call from the number 1390XXXXXX8888 was made at an abandoned barn in the southern suburbs. The call was made at 1:20 am, which is half an hour ago!” The other party reported as if he knew that this information was the key. He said, “I’ll send the address to your phone.”

“Continue to pay attention to the last number’s base station information. If there’s any change, call me immediately,” Edward ordered coldly.

“Got it.”

Finn hung up the phone. He knew what Fourth Master Swan was going to do and called the other number.

Fourth Master Swan instructed, “Everyone, wait for orders in the abandoned barn in the southern suburbs. Don’t act rashly without my instructions.”

“Understood.”

After hanging up the phone, Finn forwarded the address he received.

At the same time, he calmly guided Edward in the direction according to the electronic map.

They suddenly had a clear direction.

The car behind Fourth Master Swan found it harder to keep up.

Monica also noticed that the car in front was no longer driving aimlessly. It seemed to have a direction and was at least making turns.

Monica was a little excited.

Of course, Micheal also noticed it.

His eyes narrowed.

He could not help but be surprised.

‘Fourth Master Swan found out Jeanne’s location so quickly?!

‘How is he so capable?!’

Micheal stepped on the accelerator again and chased the car in front.

Eden, who was sitting in the back seat, became even more anxious.

He had no idea what was happening on Melody’s side.

He gritted his teeth.

Micheal was right.

If Melody did not kill Jeanne tonight…

That would be her incompetence!

…

In an abandoned barn in the southern suburbs.

Melody coldly and cruelly watched Jeanne being pressed down by her two subordinates.

Jeanne lay on the ground.

At this moment, she seemed to have accepted her fate and did not move at all.

Melody’s smile was extremely evil. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She wanted to know if Edward would still have any lingering feelings for Jeanne after she was trampled on!

Men were all selfish.

How could they allow their women to be trampled on by other men?

Their self-esteem could not take it.

Melody wanted to trample on Edward’s self-esteem.

She wanted to let him know that if he provoked her, she would do anything to make him suffer!

The cruel smile at the corner of her mouth suddenly stiffened.

Jeanne was lying on the ground in despair. Just as Melody’s subordinate was about to get close to her body, she suddenly kicked his lower body.

“Ah!” The big man suddenly fell next to Jeanne.

He held his body.

His hands were covered in blood.

It was so painful that he looked hideous.

At this moment, the other burly man had not even gotten close to Jeanne when he was stunned by her appearance.

He was stunned for two seconds before he could react.

Jeanne quickly got up from the ground.

She crazily headed in Melody’s direction, trying to get close to her without any regard for her life.

Melody held the black pistol in her hand and aimed the pistol directly at Jeanne!

Yes.

Jeanne would not accept her fate.

She admitted that she could not become a successful assassin.

Jeanne had her own thoughts.

She did not want to be touched by others even if she had to pay with her life!

‘I’m sorry, Kingsley!

‘Your training was ultimately a failure in my hands.

‘In the end…’

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

The black pistol was aimed straight at her.

Next, a gunshot was heard in the abandoned barn.

On such a quiet night, a deafening gunshot was heard.

It even alerted the people outside.

Outside, the others had finally arrived.

Edward’s body stiffened for a second.

Finn turned his head to look at Edward. He saw him quickly getting out of the car.

Edward quickly ran into the barn.

The door of the barn was kicked open.

Once it was kicked open, Edward saw Jeanne. He could only watch as Jeanne, who was covered in blood, fell to the ground!

When she fell to the ground, their eyes seemed to have met for a second.

They only met for a second.
