“Many things.” Monica obviously did not want to say more.

“What do you plan to do now?” Brandon asked her, “Do you want to keep the child or abort it?”

Monica pursed her lips, feeling very conflicted.

“You can’t bear to abort it.” Brandon already saw through her.

Monica still chose to remain silent.

Yes, she really could not bear to abort her children. The thought of two lives in her hands… However, she was unwilling to accept the reality. Brandon suddenly said, “Why don’t I raise them with you?”

Stunned, Monica stared at Brandon with wide eyes.

“Before we left South Hampton City, didn’t you ask me if I was willing to be a father?” Brandon looked at Monica seriously.

“I was just saying it.”

“But I’ve been thinking about it during the business trip.” Brandon said bluntly,

“I think I can accept your children.”

“You’re just acting on impulse.”

“No.” Brandon refuted, “If it was just a moment of impulse, I would’ve agreed to it at that time. However, I’m only saying it after a week because I’ve thought it through. When I kept asking you whether there was still a chance for you and Finn to get back together, I was trying to confirm if you would return to Finn’s side after knowing you’re pregnant with his children. If you won’t get back together with him, get together with me. I’ll take good care of you and the baby.”

“Are you crazy?” Monica was a little agitated.

Was that guy crazy to think he wanted to raise someone else’s child?

“I probably love you too much.” Brandon smiled helplessly. “Although I’ve been trying to persuade you to get back together with Finn, deep down, I don’t want you to be with him at all.”

“I won’t agree.” Monica did not want to say too much.

In any case, she had never even thought about it. Now that she was pregnant, it was unfair for anyone to be with her.

“This is the best way for you to keep the child and not be with Finn.” Brandon looked at Monica.

“But it will hurt you.”

“Whether it’ll hurt me or not, isn’t that something for me to decide? As long as

I don’t think it hurts me, that’s enough.”

“I don’t want to talk about it anymore.” Monica refused to talk to Brandon anymore because she was afraid that he would convince her.

She had to admit that she was tempted for a second. After all, that was really the best of both worlds. However, after calming down, she knew that she could not do such a thing.

She really did not want to hurt Brandon like that or for him to suffer for her.

“I’m serious.” Brandon looked at Monica, his eyes full of affection. “You can take me up on that offer anytime.”

“You can head out first. I want to be alone.” Monica immediately ordered him to leave.

Brandon pursed his lips.

In any case, he had been rejected by Monica many times, so it did not matter if it happened once or twice.

He said, “Get some sleep. I’ll be outside. Call me if anything happens.”

“You can go back,” Monica said bluntly.

“Until I woo you, I won’t leave your side.”

Monica was speechless as she turned her back to Brandon. Was that guy crazy?

She had to admit that at that moment, her heart was beating faster for no reason.

Initially, she did not take Brandon to heart because she thought it was definitely impossible for the two of them to be together. However, Brandon’s actions today made her heart skip a beat.

Were all women’s feelings more fragile when they were pregnant? Was that why Brandon took the chance to take advantage of the situation?

Brandon walked out of the ward.

He, too, knew that he could not be too hasty.

Monica was deeply hurt by her relationship with Finn, so it was impossible for her to accept him so easily. However, if Monica was still determined not to be with Finn even though she was pregnant, he would never let go of Monica.

Just then, he stopped in his tracks because he saw Finn standing at the door. Finn was also looking at him, and the two of them were silent for a long time.

Finn said, “Let’s talk.”

Brandon also felt that he could have a good talk with Finn. Hence, the two of them walked to the rooftop of the hospital.

“Do you smoke?” Finn asked Brandon.

“No. Monica is pregnant. I’m afraid that when I go back later, the smell of smoke will make her feel uncomfortable,” Brandon refused.

At that moment, Finn laughed at himself. He was mocking himself for needing others to think about his own children. With that, he did not smoke.

“Monica’s child is indeed yours,” Brandon said..
