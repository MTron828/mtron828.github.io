Chapter 1715: The Conflict Between Shelly and Nox Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I told you, the child isn’t Nox’s, so you don’t have to be upset!” Zoe said bluntly.

“What did you say?” Mrs. Winter looked at Zoe in disbelief.

Just a while ago, Zoe was confident that the baby in her belly was Nox’s, but why would she say it was not now?

“I lied to you. I deliberately lied to you for money. I knew you would believe me!” Zoe said to Mrs. Winter. “Now that it’s over, I don’t want to lie to you anymore.”

Mrs. Winter was about to faint from anger. She had never thought that Zoe would fool her like that, and it made her so angry that she rushed up to hit Zoe.

Zoe’s parents quickly stopped her. “We didn’t want to do this either, but Nox forced us into a corner. You don’t have to feel bad. You can take Zoe losing her uterus from the abortion as her retribution, and we’re even now! ”

“Even?” Mrs. Winter was fuming with anger. “Zoe, do you know my son and I got into an argument because of you? You deserve to lose your uterus. You deserve it!”

“Yes, I deserve it. So, can you can leave now?” Zoe yelled at Mrs. Winter.

Ever since she had been exposed for cheating on Nox, her life had been miserable!

“Your family deserves to end up like this!” Mrs. Winter cursed angrily.

Then, she turned and left, not wanting to see Zoe for even a second longer. She was so angry that her lungs were about to explode.

When she returned to the car, she thought for a moment and dialed Nox’s number. “Nox.”

“Mom, I’m busy.”

“I just went to see Zoe. She said the child wasn’t yours. Just thinking about it makes me angry—”

“Okay. As long as how you know awful Zoe is as a person, it’s fine. Just ignore her in the future. I have to go. I’m about to start a meeting.”

“When are you going to have a child with Shelly—”

By then, Nox had hung up the phone, and it made Mrs. Winter furious. She could not understand why Nox was so resistant to that topic. What was wrong with having a child?

Fuming, Mrs. Winter gritted her teeth and dialed Shelly’s number.

When Shelly saw Mrs. Winter’s call, she hesitated for two seconds before answering slowly, “Hello.”

“Shelly, you and Nox should have a baby soon,” Mrs. Winter said. Shelly bit her lip. She did not expect Mrs. Winter to be so straightforward. She said, “Aunty, let us handle our affairs ourselves!”

“Just tell me, what will it take for you to have a child with Nox?” Mrs. Winter did not want to beat around the bush.

Yes, she was crazy about having a grandson.

“Nox and I are not yet at the point in our relationship where we want to have a baby yet.” Shelly tried to explain calmly, “We can have a child when the time is right.”

“Nox is already 30 years old.”

“Many 30-year-olds out there are still single at 30!”

“Shelly, I’ve raised you for so many years. For my sake, marry Nox and have a baby as soon as possible. You have no idea how much I want a grandson very much. A few days ago, I was almost deceived by Zoe,” Mrs. Winter said with great anger and sadness.

Shelly frowned and asked in surprise, “What happened to Zoe?”

“Zoe came to me a few days ago and said she was pregnant with Nox’s baby, so I believed her and didn’t expect her to lie to me! The baby in her belly isn’t Nox’s at all. Shelly, please understand me. From now on, I will treat you as my daughter,” Mrs. Winter said earnestly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“How do you know that the baby in Zoe’s belly is not Nox’s?” Shelly asked.

She suddenly thought of Zoe looking for Nox yesterday and realized something was amiss.

“Zoe said it herself. She also aborted the child, so I guess she couldn’t keep the secret anymore. Fortunately, God is all-knowing, and Zoe lost her uterus after aborting the child. It can be considered as revenge on her!” Mrs. Winter was very angry.

However, Shelly did not think it was that simple. Perhaps it was Nox who forced Zoe to say so. Otherwise, why would Zoe tell Mrs. Winter that the baby was not Nox’s? There was no need for her to do that, so it meant that Nox killed his own child, and it must have been in a very cruel way..
