Chapter 814: Edward and Jeanne’s Standpoints

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hah!” Monica sneered.

Should she feel touched and honored to be the only one loved by a demon?

“But compared to my career and future, love is nothing.” Michael shed all pretense of cordiality with Monica.

Monica looked at him coldly.

At that moment, she could not find the words to say. She was so shocked by Michael’s true colors, which had been exposed in the past few days, that it overturned her worldview.

“So, don’t force me to use a crueler method on you. Once my interests clash, I’ll do many things you can’t imagine.” Michael threatened, “It’s a hundred times more painful than what you’re going through right now.”

“What are you doing?” Monica screamed.

She finally broke down.

Her scream made Gary and Ruby, who were waiting at the door, push open the door.

“Monica, what’s wrong?” Gary and Ruby were worried when they saw how emotional Monica was at that moment.

“I tried to contact Finn, but he didn’t pick up. Monica couldn’t accept it, so…” Michael hesitated, and his expression instantly changed.

Monica laughed so hard that she was in tears. She never realized how good he was at acting!

Gary also got a little angry at that moment. He looked at Monica and said, “Enough, Monica! Your relationship with Finn is over. Don’t think about him anymore! Your mother and I have also thought it through and realized that nothing can be forced. You and Finn’s relationship have been on and off for so many years that we should’ve known you two are not suitable for each other! Although Finn is indeed a good man who can be trusted, your relationship with him is broken. Even if you mend it again, there will be cracks, and you won’t be happy! Your mom and I were too naive back then, but we understand it now!”

Therefore, her parents were really touched by Michael.

Monica bit her lips so hard that they turned white.

She really wanted to kill Michael.

“You should be with Michael now. Your mother and I can see how well Michael treats you. We’ve also agreed to the wedding on the 15th of next month. You should take good care of yourself and marry Michael.” Gary’s voice was a little loud as he was obviously a little angry.

Monica looked at her father and saw that his face was red with anger.

What would her father think if she told him now that everything was orchestrated by Michael?

Her father would probably do everything he could to stop her from being with Michael. However, Michael had ten thousand ways to force her to be with him.

She did not dare to imagine what Michael would do to her parents when the time came. Would she lose her family?

Her eyes were red.

For the first time, she felt incompetent. She was so useless that she did not even know how to resist.

How should she resist?

“Monica.” Ruby’s heart ached when she saw her daughter’s silent and aggrieved expression. Her tone became gentler as she said, “Your father and I watched Finn grow up, so we know he’s filial and capable. He’s outstanding in all aspects, and your father and I both like him. However, we overlooked one thing, and that is Finn is an orphan. We originally thought that with your carefree personality, you wouldn’t be liked by the elders, so you definitely wouldn’t be able to handle your mother-in-law after you get married. If you marry Finn, you’ll be able to save yourself from these troubles, but we also forgot that an orphan won’t put much effort into relationships. Finn may like you, but the fact that he can leave the relationship whenever he wants to means that he’s better at protecting himself than most people. If you’re with him, you’ll be the one who gets hurt in the end.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

No, Finn was not like that.

In fact, his heart was broken by her, and he thought that she was hopelessly stupid.

Her eyes were red, and tears flowed down from the corners of her eyes.

Ruby’s heart ached as she wiped Monica’s tears. She said, “Michael treats you very well. Your father and I used to be prejudiced against him, but this time, your father and I finally see it. When something happened to you, he was really scared that his face turned pale. He really likes you, so don’t let him down again.”

Monica really admired Michael.
