865 Jeanne and Monica’s Joint Counterattack

“The Hills have always been ranked by status. Since you’re now the closest person to Mr. Hill, naturally, your status is different from ours. Though I’m indeed much older than you, I won’t address you respectfully, and you don’t have to be so polite to me. It’s best if you call me by my name.”

“Since you’ve said so, I’ll call you Lucy from now on.” Melinda looked pleased with herself. When she heard Lucy say that she had a higher status, she couldn’t help but feel smug.

Lucy nodded. “I’m looking for Mr. Hill.”

“He’s showering.”

The bathroom door opened, and Kingsley walked out naked. Lucy glanced at him before shifting her gaze away.

Melinda walked over self-assuringly and tied the bathrobe she had been wearing around Kingsley’s waist. “Mr. Hill, Lucy is looking for you.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Okay,” Kingsley responded.

After receiving permission, Lucy entered the room.

Naked, Melinda climbed onto Kingsley’s bed while he took a cigarette and walked to the balcony. Lucy followed him and stood behind him respectfully.

“What’s the matter?” Kingsley asked.

“Nothing. I’m just here to report to you,” Lucy said. “I’ve fully recovered.”

Kingsley turned to glance at Lucy and sized her up.

He fixed his gaze on her chest and said, “You’ve lost weight.”

Lucy felt his gaze eyeing her up and down.

She smiled. “You get smaller when you’re old.”

“Is that so?” Kingsley smiled at her response, the corners of his mouth seemingly mocking.

“Yeah.” Lucy appeared very respectful.

“Get out. I understand.” Kingsley shifted his gaze to the balcony.

As Lucy turned to leave, Kingsley asked, “How’s Jeanne? ”

In Kingsley’s world, the only person he cared about was Jeanne.

“She’s fine physically. As for her heart, she might still carry some burden.” Lucy did not hide anything from him.

“Enlighten her.”

“Understood.”

When Lucy saw that Kingsley had stopped talking, she got up and left his room.

The moment she left, Melinda called out to her. “Sister Lucy— No. Lucy.”

Lucy turned to look at Melinda.

“Could you go to my room and get me some clothes? I was with Mr. Hill just now, and they were torn.”

“Sure,” Lucy agreed.

She walked out of Kingsley’s room and into Melinda’s. This was where she used to live… She was really a beauty in her twilight years!

She randomly found a set of clothes for Melinda. When she returned to Kingsley’s room, she saw a glaring scene on the balcony.

She had missed it previously, but from where she was standing now, she could clearly see a long wound on Kingsley’s abdomen. It looked like a new wound, it was obviously just healed into a scab.

As expected, Melinda was good at making men like her. So, it was not that she had lost weight, only that some people’s breasts were more voluptuous.

She placed Melinda’s clothes on the bed and left, even closing the door behind her. She did not notice, but a line of sight from the balcony watched her leave.

When Lucy returned to her room, Jeanne was already gone. These past few days, Jeanne had been spending time with her from time to time. She was well aware that Jeanne had a lot on her mind and her heart. Unable to express it, she could only find someone to accompany her to ease her emotions.

Lucy picked up another cigarette and started smoking. She wondered what the future had in store for her, and what would happen to the Hills.

…

South Hampton City.

Monica sorted out all the information Jeanne had told her. She took a deep breath and decided to take a gamble.

Although she did not know the final outcome, she called Michael anyway.

“Have you thought it through?” The other party asked immediately.

“Will you let my family and my parents off if I agree to marry you?” Monica said through gritted teeth.

Jeanne had told her not to let Michael think that she would accept his proposal easily. Though, she did not need to perform. The thought of accepting Michael, even if it were fake, made her feel terrible.

“Yep,” Michael said bluntly.

“Alright, then,” Monica said. “I’ll marry you.”

Michael was a little surprised.

Monica said coldly, “You’ll always know what I care about the most.”

Jeanne also said that she had to make Michael believe that she was really compromising, so she deliberately spoke a lot of guiding language.

Michael believed her.

From what he knew, Monica not only treated her family but the people she acknowledged as well. She would even help them at the cost of her own life. Back then, he was able to use Monica to get what he wanted because of his grasp of Monica’s mentality.

“So, can you solve our family’s crisis?” Monica asked.

“Sure,” Michael said.

It was so straightforward that even Monica was surprised.

‘However, I need you with me to clear up all the previous misunderstandings and announce our engagement,” Michael said bluntly.

Monica was fuming. She was so angry that she wanted to vomit blood.

However, at that moment, all she said was, “Okay.”

“I’ll pick you up at 9 a.m. tomorrow.” Michael was not someone sloppy. “Remember to dress appropriately. If you play any tricks, not only will Cardellini Medical Technology fire its Chairman, I’ll make the Cardellini’s bankrupt too!”

“Michael, you really are disgusting.”

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. It’s because I love you.”

“You’re only doing this for your benefit and future.”

“I love you as long as it doesn’t affect my future.” Michael enunciated each word clearly.

Monica really wanted to kill Michael.

“See you tomorrow.” Michael hung up.

Monica was so angry that she smashed her phone. She must make Michael regret treating her like this!
