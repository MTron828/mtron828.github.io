1324 Asking For Hand in Marriage

Edward nodded slightly. Candice walked into the Nicholsons’ residence.

Edward kept looking at her back for a long time, at her… familiar back, until she disappeared in front of his eyes before letting the driver leave.

Candice also felt Edward’s gaze. She had a feeling that Edward could not see her anymore. She could sense that he was looking at her. It made her feel a lot of emotions, but she did not know which emotion it was.

It was clear one second, and unfamiliar the next.

“I thought you weren’t coming back.” A sarcastic female voice suddenly sounded in the hall.

Candice came back to her senses. Only then did she realize that Chloe was still awake in the living room, watching television on the sofa.

She was too engrossed in her thoughts just now and did not notice that there was someone else here. She actually walked past her without even greeting her.

“Candice, have you ever taken me seriously?” Chloe’s face darkened. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Candice’s disregard for her made her expression turn ugly.

All this time, she seemed to have grown up in Candice’s shadow. Ever since she was born, everyone had compared her to Candice. Everyone said that they wanted her to learn from her sister. She had been jealous of her since she was young and hated Candice. She had finally waited for Candice to fail the aerial drill and almost died. She would then be able to live a glorious life in this family. However, she did not expect that after so many years, something that never crossed her mind, Candice would actually wake up?!

God knows how upset she was when she found out that Candice had regained consciousness!

Now, she was even more unhappy.

She had initially comforted herself that even if Candice woke up, she would no longer be the Candice of the past. She had been unconscious and out of society for so many years. She would just be a piece of trash. Chloe did not need to care about her at all. Little did she know that the first thing she did when she woke up was to go against her—to steal her man!

Candice stole the best man in Harken, Edward.

The happiness that originally belonged to her had all been snatched away by Candice!

How could Chloe let this go?! She would not be satisfied even if she died.

She looked at Candice with an extremely ugly expression and felt that it was time to teach Candice a lesson.

Her father had gone to the army a few days ago and would not be back for at least half a month. If her father had not been biased toward Candice, Candice would not have had a good time. Since her father was not around, she would torture this b*tch to death!

“You’re thinking too much. It’s just that it’s too late now. I’m very tired, so I want to go back to my room and sleep early.” Candice was actually very calm about Chloe’s provocation.

She just felt that… she could not care less, so she did not want to waste time on Chloe.

There was also an inexplicable feeling.

Chloe was a weakling, so she did not want to lower herself to her level.

She actually did not know why she felt so superior.

“Why? Are you showing off that you’ve spent a lot of time with the Chief?” Chloe was obviously looking for trouble. “You didn’t come home last night and slept with the Chief? That’s why you’re parading it to everyone by coming home so late, just so everyone knows that you’re being lovey-dovey with the Chief, right?!”

“When did I do that?” Candice raised her eyebrows. “Did I ask you to stay up till late and wait for me to come back?!”

Chloe was speechless. Candice did not want to waste time with her and left immediately.

The moment she left, she paused for a moment. “Chloe, there’s a limit to being unruly and willful. You can do whatever you want in this family, but there are some things that you shouldn’t say. You’d better know your limits. Otherwise, you’ll implicate the Nicholson family. You’ll be a sinner for eternity!”

“Candice, what do you mean? Are you threatening me?! Why? Now that you’re the Chief’s woman, do you think you’re superior?!”

“Indeed.” Candice enunciated each syllable clearly. “So, you have to treat me with respect from now on!”

“Candice!”

“You’re on your own,” Candice said and left.

Chloe looked at Candice and was about to explode with anger! What right did he have to strut around in front of her? What right did she have to be so self-righteous?!

If it was not for her political marriage with the Chief, she would be nothing!

Just because she was going to marry him, she thought she had become the queen?!

Dream on!
