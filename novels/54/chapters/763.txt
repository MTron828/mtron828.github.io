Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne got out of bed after the call, opened the floor-to-ceiling window, and walked to the balcony.

On the balcony, Edward was smoking.

Smoke filled the air, and the red cigarette butt flickered in the night.

Upon sensing Jeanne coming out of the room, he put out his cigarette and was about to turn around when Jeanne hugged him from behind.

Edward was smiling.

“Do you usually smoke a lot?” Jeanne asked.

“Sometimes...”

“I smoke too.” Jeanne confessed.

“I know.” Edward’s answer surprised Jeanne little.

She had never done so in front of Edward.

“When I came back, I saw some cigarette butts at home. If it wasn’t yours…” Edward deliberately dragged his tone.

If it were not her, it would be a wild man’s cigarette buds.

Jeanne smiled and did not explain further.

She did not think Edward was so narrow-minded that he could not accept women smoking.

In fact, she told him that she smoked just to let him know that she did not mind him smoking in front of her and that he did not have to put out the cigarette every time she appeared.

“It’s late. Let’s go to sleep,” Jeanne said.

Edward nodded.

With that, the two of them returned to the bed together.

As soon as they lay down, Edward sat up again. He rummaged through the bedside cabinet and took out an allergy cream.

Jeanne was surprised.

Edward passed the cream to Jeanne and said, “Apply it on my body for me.”

“Huh?”

“I’m allergic,” Edward said.

Only then did Jeanne remember that Edward had eaten the chocolate in her mouth tonight.

At that moment, her face was blushing. However, she was also a little flustered and exasperated.

He knew he was allergic to chocolate, yet he still kissed her. Did that guy care more about flirting than his life?

Even so, she took the cream and lifted Edward’s clothes, revealing the countless red dots on his body which made him look a little ferocious.

Jeanne did not expect it to be so serious. After all, he had only eaten so little.

Upon careful consideration, she had also given George chocolate-related food when he was allergic. After George ate it, he instantly turned red, and it frightened her to the core.

As expected, genetics were indescribable.

“Does it itch?” Jeanne asked as she helped him apply the cream.

“It’s manageable”

That meant it was itchy, and he was just holding it in.

She asked, “Why didn’t you have me apply the cream for you earlier?”

“I thought I could endure it.”

“Why do you have to endure it in front of me?”

“I like to act tough.” Edward laid on the bed and said in a domineering manner.

However, the next second, he suddenly twisted his body to her.

“Yes, there. Scratch it for me.”

Jeanne was speechless. Since he wanted to act tough, he should not ask her for help.

“There’s no need to act tough in front of my wife.”

Anyway, he had said everything.

Jeanne applied the cream on Edward’s body and scratched his back for him. After scratching it, it looked even redder and more ferocious.

“Can you watch what you put in your mouth?” Jeanne could not help but grumble as she looked at his tragic back. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It’s a little difficult to stay away from your lips.”

“…”

“However, it’ll be fine as long as you don’t eat chocolate in the future,” Edward said matter-of-factly.

F*ck. What a sinister man.

He was beating around the bush to scheme against her.

It was food that he could not eat, yet he still wanted others to not to eat it with him.

How cunning could he be?

…

The next day, Jeanne’s alarm clock rang for a second before she immediately turned it off.

She looked at the time, 7:30 a.m., and stretched her back.

When she got up, she saw that the man beside her was still sleeping.

She did not know when it started, but the fellow beside her was getting better and better quality sleep.

In the past, he was the one who got up first.

Now, as long as she did not get out of bed, he would not move at all.

Just as she was about to get off the bed, she thought for a moment and gently lifted Edward’s pajamas.

She was not sure if the cream from last night had any effect.

Just as she lifted his pajamas up, she heard someone say, “I see you’re in high spirits early in the morning.”

Jeanne’s hands trembled.

Edward laughed with his eyes closed.

“You don’t have to take advantage to touch me while I’m sleeping. I don’t mind being ravaged by you.” A certain someone opened his eyes. A certain someone opened his eyes, and there seemed to be a hint of lust in them.

Jeanne immediately ran off.

She knew from that familiar gaze that something would happen in the next second.

With that, she went into the bathroom to wash up.

All traces of Edward’s allergy had disappeared overnight. What kind of medicine was so powerful?

She figured she had to prepare two tubes of that cream for George as well.

After all, what would happen if George accidentally ate something with chocolate?
