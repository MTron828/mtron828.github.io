Chapter 1566: The Confession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica was really rendered speechless by Finn. Was he not usually quite calm?

Now that he was drunk, he was like an entirely different person

At that moment, he was staring straight at her, but Monica could not understand what he wanted! She wished he could just go to sleep and stop fussing around.

“Monica.” When Finn did not get a response from Monica, he spoke again. He stared at Monica with his dazed eyes and said, “Can’t I kiss you?”

He looked extremely aggrieved, like he was going to die of sadness and pain if she did not kiss him. When did Finn, that *sshole, learn to act like a cute child? However, due to his expression, she could not help but lean over and kiss Finn on the lips.

Finn seemed stunned and flattered. He was so overjoyed that he could not hide the smile on his face. He was like an excited child who finally got his wish of having candy.

Monica, on the other hand, could not take Finn anymore. She looked away, afraid of being bewitched by the guy. She got up, and just as she was about to get off the bed, someone suddenly held her body tightly. Monica frowned unhappily. “Finn, let go of me!”

“No.” The man hugged her firmly.

“Finn, I’m angry!”

‘The man is really curious!’ Monica thought to herself. In the future, if Finn got drunk, she would never let him in again.

“You’ll leave after I let you go.” Finn suddenly said faintly, “I’m really scared you’ll leave me…”

As he spoke, he hugged her tighter, with his entire face buried in her body. It was as if he would never let go even if he died.

Monica almost broke down. To begin with, Finn was strong, and a drunk man who did not know how to control his strength was even stronger. Hence, she simply could not move.

Moreover, she really did not want to hug Finn like that. For one, Finn reeked of wine. Even if he did not want to take a shower now, she could at least help him take off his clothes and wipe his body clean.

Now, he was hugging her like a bear… It was not comfortable for her at all, but she did not say anything in the end, allowing Finn to hug her like that.

As the night deepened, the two of them fell asleep. When Monica woke up again, she could feel a burning gaze staring at her.

She opened her eyes and was met with a pair of eyes, which seemed to have been staring at her for a long time. Even after she opened her eyes, they were still staring at her affectionately.

Having been greeted by such a scene in the morning, Monica could not take it anymore. Finn may have changed, but did he have to change so much? It was scary!

“Are you awake?” Finn’s charming voice rang in her ears.

Monica moved her body. Last night, she was hugged by a bear and did not sleep well at all. His entire body was stiff.

“Are you getting up?” Finn asked as he watched her.

“Isn’t it late now?” Monica asked.

Although she did not wake up halfway, her biological clock could tell that it was getting late.

“It’s 9:30 a.m in the morning,” Finn told her the time.

“It’s so late! Didn’t they agree to gather at the sightseeing spot at 9 a.m. today yesterday?” Monica was shocked.

“I told them to arrange the schedule for the afternoon because I didn’t know how long you were going to sleep.”

“Couldn’t you wake me up?” She also felt bad about changing the schedule.

“I couldn’t bear to.” Finn said bluntly, “I didn’t have the heart to disturb you. You looked well-rested when you were asleep.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Did she?

“So I thought you could sleep a little longer,” Finn added.

“Well, I’m awake,” Monica refused.

At her current age, once she woke up, it would be very difficult for her to fall asleep again. It even baffled her as to how she used to sleep for an entire day when she was younger, which was the complete opposite of how she was now.

“Alright.” Finn did not say anything else.

He was completely different from the stubborn man from last night. Today, he had become especially obedient again.

F*ck. Did Finn have two faces?

Finn helped her sit up. Then, she got out of bed to wash up..
