1258 Standing Up For Shelly

She thought that Nox might have gone out to have an affair tonight. Once she got the evidence… She gritted her teeth and told the taxi driver to follow the car in front.

The car stopped at an abandoned warehouse that was a little far away.

Shelly was a little surprised that Nox would come to that kind of place… Why did she find it out of the ordinary?

Could it be that he had deliberately chosen that place to avoid Grandpa Wade’s eyes?

Shelly got out of the car. After seeing Nox being pushed into the warehouse, she followed him carefully. The night was a little dark, and there was not much light in that place, so it was still a little scary. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Shelly gritted her teeth and finally reached the entrance of the warehouse. Then, she held her breath as she gently pushed open the door to see Nox sitting in a wheelchair and a man kneeling in front of her.

If she was not wrong, that man was actually Benjamin Bacon.

Her heart skipped a beat. Why did Nox kidnap Benjamin Bacon here?

At that moment, she heard Nox’s cold voice. “Were you the one who fought with Shelly?!”

“Who are you?”

“Me?” Nox laughed coldly, “It doesn’t matter who I am. What’s important is that I want you to know that Shelly isn’t someone you can throw your fist at!”

As he said that, he suddenly threw a punch at Benjamin’s face.

Benjamin was in pain, and his entire body suddenly fell to the ground in a sorry state. He endured the pain and said fiercely, “I can’t believe Shelly is taking revenge on me like this!”

“Shelly’s not the one who wants to take revenge on you. It’s me!” Nox bent down in his wheelchair and warned Benjamin, “Stay away from Shelly from now on!”

“You are Nox, right?” Benjamin shouted.

“I didn’t know I was so so popular even among the high school students!” Nox was smug.

“For a man like you who only thinks with your lower body, what right do you have for Shelly to treat you so well? I’ve been deskmates with Shelly for the past few months, and I’ve been hearing Shelly receive your unreasonable calls every day!” Benjamin seemed to be defending Shelly.

Nox frowned.

Did Benjamin not hit Shelly? Why did he suddenly say such things?

Could it be…

“Why? Do you like Shelly?” It was because he liked her that he did not want her to be ordered around by other men.

“Yes, I like her!” Benjamin admitted it, “I like Shelly, and I just can’t stand how she treats you. That was why I fought with her today. It was because I didn’t want her to go to your side and have you ruin her!”

Nox’s expression darkened. He was just saying it casually, but he did not expect Benjamin to really like Shelly.

He looked at Benjamin, who looked quite good-looking and well-mannered with his pair of sleek glasses.

Was he blind? To think he actually liked the ugly Shelly!

“Do you really like Shelly?” Nox found it impossible.

“I like her very much. If Shelly didn’t want to marry you so badly, I would’ve confessed to her a long time ago–”

“I don’t like Shelly.” Nox interrupted Benjamin, “Why don’t you confess to her?”

Benjamin was stunned.

“How about this? I won’t hit you today, but can you woo Shelly for me? If you get together with her, I’ll give you a huge sum of money.”

Benjamin’s eyes widened.

He was confused as to how the situation had suddenly changed. In fact, he was prepared to be beaten up by Nox.

On the other hand, Shelly, who was standing outside the door, was very calm. After all, Nox was an abnormal one.

With that, she turned around and left the warehouse. She was now embarrassed by how touched she felt by Nox’s gesture just now.
