Chapter 1667: Monica Takes A Jab At Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica lay on the comfortable bed while Finn helped her with the ultrasound. However, she seriously doubted Finn’s skills. After all, he was no longer a doctor.

As if Finn could feel Monica’s doubts, he said, “Don’t worry, I won’t forget the basics.”

Monica rolled her eyes at Finn’s humble bragging. Performing an ultrasound was not a basic skill! It was clearly a test of one’s skill!

Finn was very serious, and the assistant doctor beside him had been helping him record the results. Throughout the whole process, Finn also told Monica about the baby’s development. There was a smile in his tone, obviously indicating that the baby was fine.

The other staff members in the ultrasound room were shocked by Finn’s change. Although the rumors said that Dr. Jones was not fierce or stern but just cold to everyone, from the looks of it, Dr. Jones treated his wife very well! It was obvious that he doted on her and was very attentive toward her.

The ultrasound went on for quite a while. Finn’s device was fixed on Monica’s lower abdomen for a long time as if he was seriously observing the baby’s development. He even paused for a few seconds without saying anything.

“Finn, don’t scare me!” Monica was a little nervous when she saw his serious expression.

Usually, there must be something wrong for him to have such an expression.

“Don’t worry, Mrs. Jones. Dr. Jones is checking the gender of the baby,” the assistant doctor quickly said.

Now that she was four months into her pregnancy, they should be able to tell the babies’ genders.

When Monica heard the assistant doctor, she became even more nervous. She, too, was very curious about the baby’s gender and was looking forward to it, but she suddenly had a bad feeling about it when he saw Finn frowning.

It was a long time until Finn let go, put the apparatus away, and helped Monica clean the couplant gel on her stomach.

Monica looked at Finn’s serious expression and could not help but ask, “Are they boys?”

Finn’s hand that was wiping Monica’s pregnant belly paused for a moment, and he looked stunned.

“Is it really a boy?” Monica knew from Finn’s expression.

“One is,” Finn replied.

At that moment, he carried Monica down from the bed and tidied her clothes for her. Recently, Finn had been taking good care of her. If he could stop her from doing anything, he would.

Monica did not know when she got used to it, but she was used to it.

“And the other one is a girl?” Monica was a little excited.

Having one boy was good too. However, Finn shook his head, and Monica’s eyes widened. It turned out she was pregnant with sons!

“I still can’t see the other one,” Finn said.

Monica heaved a sigh of relief and thought, ‘Damn it. Couldn’t he just finish his sentence?’

The assistant doctor quickly added, “Girls are usually shy, so they won’t let you see them.”

“Really?” Monica asked excitedly.

“That’s what everyone says.” The assistant doctor smiled. “But there’s no scientific basis for it.”

You’re just teasing me!

“Let’s go.” Finn tidied Monica’s clothes and held her hand as they walked out of the ultrasound room.

The two of them left the hospital after receiving the results.

On the way back, Monica was looking at the baby’s ultrasound report. She did not really understand it, but when she looked at the little guy in the picture, a warm feeling filled her heart.

“Which one is the boy?” Monica suddenly asked Finn.

Finn looked at her through the rearview mirror and replied, “The one on the left. ”

Then, Monica took a few more glances before looking at the one on the right and saying firmly, “I think the one on the right will be a girl.”

Finn pursed his lips and did not respond.

Monica was a little hurt. “Finn, do you not like it?” “No,” Finn quickly denied.

“Do you hate me because I’m pregnant with a boy?”

“No.” Finn had a feeling that he would never be able to clear his innocence.

He did not hate her. If he wanted to hate someone, he should hate himself because he was the one who could not give them a daughter.

“Are you unhappy? You’re angry because you didn’t see the daughter you wanted.” Monica was certain. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The thought of that also made her upset. She did not know if it was because she was pregnant, but she had become fragile, sensitive, and unreasonable.

Finn, who was a little helpless, explained, “I’m just a little disappointed..”
