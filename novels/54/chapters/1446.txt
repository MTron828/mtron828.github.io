“I don’t need your company.”

“Teddy needs to rest too.”

“I don’t have to rest…” Teddy swallowed his words when he met Candice’s gaze.

In fact, he would now go back to his room after George fell asleep at night.

George’s injuries were recovering very quickly. Other than the wound on his legs, everything else was fine. Hence, he did not need any special care.

“I don’t need Teddy to accompany me. All of you, get out.”

“Young Master, didn’t we agree to wash your hair tonight?” Teddy had already dressed George.

At least it made things less awkwvard for George.

“I’m not washing it anymore.”

“You… haven’t washed your hair for a week.” Teddy could not stand it anymore.

George was a little obsessed with cleanliness. If Teddy had not stopped him, he would have washed his hair long ago.

“I’ll help you wash it.”

“No.”

“Teddy, get out,” Candice ordered.

Teddy was in a dilemma.

“Fourth Master is looking for you.” Candice found an excuse.

Everyone knew that Candice was lying, but she gave Teddy an excuse. Hence, Teddy quickly walked out before George could not call out to him.

When the door closed, Candice turned back to look at George and smiled triumphantly.

George said, “I’m not washing my hair. You can go out.”

“Are you sure you don’t want to?”

“I’m sure.”

“I smell something…”

“Don’t come near me!” George quickly dodged.

“If you don’t wash your hair, I’ll come near you.”

“Candice!”

“You called me Mom that night.”

“In your dreams!” “Step-mom works too.”

“Candice.”

“Alright, it’s just a form of address.” Candice compromised.

George was furious.

“I’ll prepare the bathtub for you.” Candice turned to leave without giving George a chance to retort.

After a while, Candice came out of the bathroom. She said, “I’ll carry you to the bathtub to lie down, so you won’t get wet.”

“I’m not washing… I’ll wash my hair!” When he saw Candice’s face really coming closer, George immediately corrected himself.

He could not accept how dirty he was now.

Candice smiled triumphantly. For some reason, she felt a great sense of accomplishment with George.

“Come up.” Candice sat on the edge of the bed with her back facing George. She wanted George to get on her back.

“I’ll go to the bathroom myself.” “Get up here!” Candice commanded.

“I’m afraid you can’t carry me. I’m very heavy.”

“I can carry your dad.” Candice was determined.

Although she had never carried him, she… was often crushed under him. Hence, carrying George should not be a problem.

George hesitated for a moment but still got onto Candice’s back.

Candice carried George on her back. He did not look fat, but he was not light at all. It was on a completely different level from Page’s weight.

“I told you I was heavy.” George seemed a little embarrassed.

Candice smiled. “Don’t worry, I’m as strong as a bull. I can still run 1000 meters with you on my back.” “Liar.”

“It’s called a white lie.”

George chose to shut up.

Candice carefully placed George in the dry bathtub. George could not take a bath now because of the wound, so she wiped the bathtub clean in advance.

After putting George down, Candice lay George’s head on the side of the bathtub, imitating the way a salon washed its customer’s hair.

She squatted beside the toilet and started to rinse George’s hair with water. Candice squeezed a lot of shampoo on George’s head and scratched his scalp for him.

“Are you comfortable?” Candice asked.

“No.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Can you be honest with your words? How can someone like you get a wife in the future?”

“Who wants a wife?”

“You’ll get married when you grow up. Are you planning to live under the same roof as your father for the rest of your life?” “I don’t want to.” George refused.

“That’s right.”

“But I can also be alone for the rest of my life.”

“I think your mother will definitely crawl out of her grave and beat you to death for that.”

Was that woman not afraid of saying anything at all? All these years, he had nnt allowed anvnnp to mention his mother

“Are there any other itchy spots on your scalp?”

“No,” George said angrily.

“If there isn’t, I’ll just rinse your hair.”

“No… Yes.” George changed his mind again because the back of his head was indeed itchy.

He could endure the pain, but the itch was unbearable.

“Where?” Candice scratched his head.

“The back of my head. Yes, a little in the middle, a little on top. Yes, that’s it.” George guided Candice to the itchiest spot.

However, Candice did not help him with scratching it.

Just when George could not stand it anymore, he heard Candice say, “Call me your stepmom.”

“Candice!” George was about to explode.

“If you don’t call me, I won’t scratch it for you.” Candice was obviously doing it on purpose.

George had never been so angry before, and the two of them were in a stalemate for a long time.

Candice, in fact, knew how unbearable the itch could be. She was just about to compromise when George gritted his teeth and called out in an extremely low voice, “Mom.”

The smile on Candice’s face was obvious, and it was bright and warm. She must be very happy to smile like that, right?

George saw her smile too. There was a reflective glass above the bathroom, and since George was laying down, he could see Candice’s every frown and smile through the glass.

“I was forced,” George suddenly said.

At that moment, Candice was already helping him scratch the itchiest spot on his scalp.

“If you didn’t scratch the itch for me, I wouldn’t have called you that. Don’t be smug. ”

He did not want to see Candice’s bright smile and be infected by her.

“Your hand isn’t injured. Can’t you scratch it yourself?” Candice said on purpose.

George was fuming. Being with Candice made him feel stupid.

Candice looked at George’s expression, with the smile still on her lips. However, she suddenly seemed a little more serious.

She said, “George, if I say it feels to me that you’re my biological son, will you think that I’m lying to you?”

George pursed his lips.

He actually… felt the same too, especially that night. Even though he was in a daze, the feeling Candice gave him was too similar to his mother.

If not for the fact that Candice looked completely different appearance from his mother when he woke up, he would have thought that his mother was still alive.

He had even secretly observed whether Candice had a human skin mask on her face. However, Candice was not his mother, so he would stay away from her. He would not accept anyone other than his mother getting close to him. “Can we get along peacefully?” Candice asked George seriously.

“No.” George refused.

Candice rolled her eyes. That little brat was really invulnerable, and he would not budge at anything she said.

“What are you afraid of?” Candice asked him.

“I’m not afraid of anything.”

“Are you afraid that I’ll replace your mother? Are you afraid that you won’t remember her? Are you afraid that you’ll forget her?”

“No.” George retorted.

“Don’t worry.” As if she did not hear George’s voice, Candice continued, “No one can replace Jeanne. Be it you or your father, no one can change her position in your hearts.”

“My dad…”

“Your dad often calls Jeanne’s name when he’s asleep.” Candice smiled. Her smile looked a little sad, but she seemed to be forcing herself to accept that fact..
