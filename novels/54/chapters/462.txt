Chapter 463: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

Elaine presented her gift. “Dad, this is a custom-made statue of Jesus. I’ve been preparing it since last year, and it only got done recently. Also, it has been blessed by the pastor.”

Old Master Swan took a look and accepted it.

“Dad, this is an antique vase I had a friend buy for me in Europe. It’s said to be a thousand years old. I know Dad has always had a habit of collecting antiques,” Henry quickly said.

Old Master Swan looked at it and accepted it too.

At that moment, Richard also went up to present his gift. “Dad, my gift isn’t as expensive as Henry and Ruby’s gifts, but here’s an oil painting for you, dad. Kenny has been learning painting from you since he was young, so he has gotten some of your hand-down techniques. He spent nearly a month completing this painting. I hope you’ll like it, dad.”

As he spoke, he took out the painting he had prepared with all his heart and showed it to Old Master Swan.

Old Master Swan took a few glances and nodded. “Not bad.”

“Aren’t you going to thank your grandfather for his praise?” Richard hurriedly called out to his eldest son.

“Thank you, grandfather.” Kenny was very respectful.

Old Master Swan took a few more glances at it and had Wade put it away for him.

Now that everyone had gifted their presents, they all looked at Edward as if waiting for his present.

However, at that moment, Old Master Swan suddenly said, “It’s time to eat.”

“Dad,” Jeanne called out to him. “Edward and I have also prepared a present for you.”

......

Old Master Swan looked at Jeanne and said, “Haven’t you already given me your present?”

When everyone heard the word ‘given’, they looked at Edward and Jeanne.

What did they give it?

“Of course, that doesn’t count.” Jeanne smiled very sweetly. “However, the gift from Edward and I is a little simpler. I hope you’ll like it.”

“Take it out,” Old Master Swan said, sounding excited.

Henry and Elaine looked at the couple with ugly expressions.

They had not gotten over the anger they had suffered at the senior management meeting today, so how could they tolerate those two people acting obediently in front of Old Master Swan again?

Henry and Elaine were not the only ones. Eden’s expression was also extremely ugly.

As the younger one in the family, he had no right to speak at an occasion like Old Master Swan’s birthday dinner or gift presents. However, looking at Jeanne acting such matter-of-factly now, like she had more seniority than him, his expression turned even uglier. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jasmine, who was by the side, was naturally filled with intense hatred.

Seeing that Jeanne could speak to Old Master Swan so calmly made her feel so angry. It felt as if her heart was on fire.

After all, she had been married into the family for so long, yet Old Master Swan had never spoken to her. Not to mention take the initiative, Old Master Swan had never mentioned her even when the Swans members were chatting.

Nevertheless, she suppressed her anger.

Everyone watched Jeanne as she took out an exquisite box.

Henry sneered.

His father hated those flashy things the most, and looking at her box, he knew his father would not like it.

Then, Jeanne opened the box.

Old Master Swan just looked at it with no particular expression on his face.

Jeanne took out the razor from inside and said, “I saw that your beard was a little long, so I thought of buying a razor for you. The shop owner said that this razor is very good and wouldn’t cut your skin no matter what. I don’t know if your previous razor was good, but since the shop owner said this is good, I had to buy it for you, dad.”

The underlying meaning was that she did not know if he would need it, but she wanted to give him something good.

Such a kind intention naturally made people feel her sincerity.

Jasmine looked at Jeanne coldly.

She never used to think Jeanne was so good at talking. What exactly had Jeanne experienced in the past seven years that allowed her to come back as a new person?

In the main hall, Old Master Swan took the razor from Jeanne’s hand and glanced at it a few times.

“Dad, do you want to give it a try?” Jeanne asked.

Old Master Swan looked at Jeanne. “Let’s give it a try.”

The others were surprised because Old Master Swan gave off a dignified, distant, and unapproachable air to him!

However, when did he become so easy to talk to?

Jeanne quickly volunteered, “I’ll help you, dad.”

“Okay,” Old Master Swan agreed just like that.

After all, other than Wade, Old Master Swan had never allowed anyone else to get close to him.
