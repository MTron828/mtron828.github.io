“Henry!” Old Master Swan’s voice was loud, and his angry expression made everyone present tremble in fear. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Old Master Swan still looked very authoritative after these years. No one knew whether it was because of his age or not, but he rarely lost his temper.

Now, he said coldly to Henry, “Since you question my management of this family and think that my actions are unacceptable to you, you can leave the Swans!”

“Dad!” Henry looked at Old Master Swan in disbelief. “You want to kick me out just because of Edward and his little wife? Don’t you think you’re too selfish? Do you really want all of us to leave you one day? Aren’t you afraid you’ll regret your decision?”

“I, Zachary Swan, have lived for so long and have never done anything I regret, including whatever I’ve done to you! You can choose to leave if you don’t understand, and I won’t stop you!”

“Dad! Why do you have to treat us like this? Why can’t you be a fair and just father? Why do you have to protect Edward so much? Aren’t the rest of us your children as well? We’re your biological children too. Why do you have to side with Edward?” Henry questioned him. At that moment, he vented all the grievances he had felt for all those years!

“I’m not on anyone’s side! I treat all of you fairly and justly. I have a clear conscience!” Old Master Swan said firmly.

“Fair and justly? You gave everything to Edward. Do you call that fair and justly? You’re lying through your teeth! How can you even say it in such a dignified manner?”

“Have you ever thought about what Edward had to go through for everything he received today? What was he doing when you were enjoying yourselves?” Old Master Swan said coldly, “Who was the one who shouldered all the burden of Swan Enterprise? Was it you? Why do you think you could live a luxurious life with a high salary? Who gave you an easy life? You’ve been enjoying all of this so naturally, and now, you’re telling me you don’t think it’s fair?”

“I’m mediocre because you valued Edward too highly, allowing him to take charge of everything and making me useless! If it weren’t for Edward, I could have supported the entire Edward and become the pillar of the family!”

“Have you forgotten that one of your decisions almost caused the Swans to go bankrupt?” Old Master Swan looked at Henry with a grim expression. “Need I list all the ridiculous things you did in the company?”

“I was still young back then. I might have made some mistakes, but you can’t use that to deny me everything!”

“You were still young? You were already 30 when I gave you the power to manage the family. Meanwhile, Edward isn’t even 30 yet and has been managing the Swans for almost ten years. Who gave you the confidence to compare yourself with Edward?” Old Master Swan mocked Henry in front of everyone.

......

Henry was embarrassed by Master Yan’s words.

He admitted that he was not as capable as Edward, but he still could not accept it.

They were all Zachary’s sons. Why would he protect Edward more just because Edward was more capable?

In Zachary’s heart, the others were nothing at all.

Looking at Henry’s expression, Old Master Swan did not think of giving him a way out. He said coldly, “Today’s matter ends here. From now on, I don’t want to hear anyone else say I’m biased towards Edward! I can let it go this time, but it doesn’t mean I can tolerate it next time!”

Old Master Swan’s words were intimidating, and no one dared to go against him.

No matter what Elaine said or how much she acted like a spoiled child fawning over Old Master Swan, she did not dare to anger Old Master Swan.

She looked at her big brother, who was also shaken by Old Master Swan’s hostility and did not dare to say another word.

Everyone knew very well that if they angered Old Master Swan at that moment, they would be kicked out of the family.

No matter what, they were, indeed, living a luxurious life with no worries about food or having shelter over their head. They had so much money that they could not even use it all. If they were really kicked out of the family, they would have no ability to survive in the outside world and would be penniless sooner or later. No one dared to take it that far.

Suddenly, a suffocating silence filled the air.

Old Master Swan intended to get up and leave.

Just like that, the matter would end under Old Master Swan’s authority.
