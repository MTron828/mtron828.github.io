Chapter 537: Do I Deserve to Be Abandoned by You, Time and Time Again?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As for Michael, he only suffered a little injury and a setback, and she thought the sky was falling!

Finn said to Monica in a cold voice, “It doesn’t mean I won’t die!”

Monica felt a pang in her heart when he heard him saying that he could not feel pain, but it did not mean he would not die.

Her tears kept flowing as she said, “Finn, Michael won’t ask me to help him even if he died because he doesn’t want to make things difficult for me. Yet, you keep forcing me to do things I don’t want to. Your so-called love is just so selfish that I find it scary!”

Finn kept pushing his fists into the wall.

Now, he wished he could feel the pain. If he could feel the pain physically, would his heart hurt less?

Monica gritted her teeth and pushed Finn away.

“Even if you and I break up, I will help Michael. This is my moral baseline. I can’t abandon my principles just because of love, and one day, you will know how selfish you are.”

Finn watched as she attacked him, showing him how great she was and how despicable he was.

Monica also stared at Finn for a while before turning around and leaving heartlessly.

No matter how much he was suffering, she would leave for the sake of her so-called human nature.

Finn looked at Monica’s indifferent silhouette.

“Don’t go,” Finn called out to her one last time.

Monica stopped in her tracks, but she did not look back.

“Please. Don’t go...” Finn said. He tried to hold back his emotions, but it sounded like he was choking up.

In the end, Monica left. Even with her crutches, her walk was firm.

After she entered the elevator, Monica broke down crying.

She could not take it when Finn tried to persuade her to stay. He even lowered his ego and begged her not to leave.

Why did Finn refuse to support her decision?

Why could he not trust her?

Why did he have to make her feel so bad about her decision?

She squatted in the elevator and cried like a child.

At the thought of how Finn acted just now and how he had begged her not to leave after she abandoned him, she felt terrible.

She never wanted to see Finn take it to such an extent…

She cried bitterly.

When the elevator door opened, Michael was standing by the door.

Michael had sent her back, and seeing her crying so sadly, he knew very well that with Finn’s personality, Finn would never support Monica’s decision to be with him.

He even believed that with Finn’s intelligence, Finn might notice that he had other motives for doing so.

However, Finn did not know Monica well enough — that Monica could not be forced. The more he asked her not to do something, the more she would do it.

The only thing that could make Monica do something without hesitation was to make her feel guilty.

With that, he walked into the elevator, squatted beside Monica, and gently stroked her back. “If this is too hard on you, you don’t have to do this.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica raised her head and looked at Michael with tears in her eyes, saying, “Michael, you’ll let me leave after all of this, right?”

“Yes,” Michael answered affirmatively.

Monica stood up from the ground, and Michael stood up with her.

With her crutches, Monica walked out of the elevator and said, “Finn will eventually understand.”

He would come to understand that she was just trying to help Michael and that Michael was not as bad as he thought!

At that moment, she really thought she would prove through her action that everything Finn was biased.

However, it did not cross her mind that her foolishness had caused her to lose the person she loved the most and that she was the one who brought a lifetime of sadness upon herself.

As Michael stared at Monica’s back, an evil smile stretched across his face.

He said it before.

Even if he had to resort to all means, Monica would be his, and he got her!

…

At 7 a.m. the next day, Finn’s phone rang.

He glanced at the incoming call but did not pick it up. Instead, he slowly got up and brushed his teeth.

Meanwhile, a lot of calls and text messages came through.

“Finn, I’m waiting for you in the garage. Call me back when you see the message.”

“Finn, why aren’t you answering your phone?”

“Finn, I’m in the garage.”

“Finn...”

Finn rinsed his mouth and washed his face before going back to his room to get changes.

He had just taken off her clothes when the door was suddenly pushed open.

Monica came in with her crutches, looking a little angry. “Why didn’t you answer my call?”

However, Finn did not respond to her. He simply took his time to take off his clothes and put a new set on.

He still had a lot of injuries on his body, so the doctor had told him not to prevent making any big movements. If possible, he should have someone help him to put on his clothes.

Without thinking about it, Monica put her crutches aside and went over to help him.

Finn’s body moved as he avoided her.

Monica looked at him, who said, “Stay away from me.”

Monica gritted her teeth, but she knew Finn was angry, especially after she left last night.

Hence, she put down her hands and said, “Hurry up.”

Finn kept quiet as he put on his clothes.

After putting them on, with all the injuries on his body covered and his back straight, he suddenly did not look like he was injured.

Then, he put on the glasses.

In fact, Finn’s nearsightedness was very low, so he could live without glasses.

He did not wear them once during his stay at the hospital. Yet now, he took them out and put them on.

Monica did not know why, but seeing Finn in his glasses made him feel much more distant.
