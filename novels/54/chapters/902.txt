903 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

In the wedding hall, most of the people did not know what was happening, and they did not think that the so-called spy was real.

After all, Harken had been peaceful for a long time, and nothing shocking had happened so far. Most people were living in their comfortable homes and had never experienced the so-called suffering.

Therefore, when the Sanders’ guards began to inspect them one by one, many people at the scene felt a trace of disgust.

The inspection was also quite strict.

They were required to conduct a body search on the guests to see if they were carrying weapons or something that should not be at the banquet. The guests’ identities were also checked to confirm if they were invited by the Sanders and Rosses. Finally, they were required to cut off each guest’s hair for a DNA backup.

The wedding banquet hall was silent.

Nox glanced at Edward.

If they were to search the place one by one and collect the hair through the proper means, it would be obvious if they were to do anything sneaky. They would be judged as the Sanders’ enemy and would be detained as the so-called “spy”.

Therefore, they could not act rashly.

However, if they did not act rashly, Alex Duncan would only be discovered by the Sanders.

Edward’s face remained calm, and no one could tell what he was thinking.

A third of the investigation was completed.

One of the guards checked Finn’s identity, sized him up, and said sternly, “You’re not invited among the guests!”

Everyone in the tense and quiet banquet hall looked over because of the guards.

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

The guard’s voice became sterner. “How did you get in?!”

Finn glanced at the guard and said, “I came in with her.”

The guard looked at Sarah.

At that moment, Sarah was already scared silly by the situation at the scene. Seeing that Finn was being questioned by the guard, she knew that the matter could be serious if not handled properly. Hence, she quickly said, “Yes, I brought him in early this morning.

The guard looked at Sarah coldly.

Sarah was frightened by the look in his eyes. “H-H-He’s my boyfriend. Can’t I bring him to my cousin’s wedding?”

Finn glanced at Sarah and did not refute her.

However, the guard was not so easy to fool. He said frankly, “Even if he’s your boyfriend, you should be on the guest list! Raise your hands and follow me!”

“No!” Frightened, Sarah quickly pulled Finn back. She mustered her courage and said to the guard, “Who are you to take him away? Who are you to do that?”

“Based on the fact that he showed up here without an invitation. His motive is impure, and he is very suspicious. We will interrogate him alone.

“I’m attending my ex-wife’s wedding through my connections. Is this considered to have impure motives? ” Finn questioned the guard.

The guard frowned, his expression cold.

“Have you ever been in love? Have you ever been married? If you were dumped by your ex-wife, you would also have the urge to see why she betrayed you and married another man! I’m here to make myself give up on this woman. What’s wrong with that?” Finn said righteously, making it seem like he was not lying at all.

The guards stared closely at Finn.

Of course, he still would not change his view of Finn just because of what Finn said. With that, he interrogated Finn in public, “When did you arrive? Where were you during the wedding?”

“I arrived at 10 a.m. in the morning, and I was there the entire time.” Finn pointed to a corner, which was the blind spot of the surveillance cameras. He had inspected the hall before he came, so he knew all the secrets behind it. He said, “You can check the surveillance footage.”

When the guard saw that Finn’s expression did not change, he ordered his subordinate beside him, “Go back and watch the recording to see if what he said is true!”

“Yes!”

At the banquet hall, the suspicion of Finn slowed down the search.

As time passed, the crowd started to get restless.

All of them were people of status, so some people could not stand being watched and searched like that.

The guards were divided into two teams, and the other team had a dispute at the scene. “What right do you have to touch me? What right do you have to imprison all of us here and let you do such things to us that hurt our pride and violate our human rights? I want to see my lawyer! I want to see my lawyer right now. I want to sue you!”
