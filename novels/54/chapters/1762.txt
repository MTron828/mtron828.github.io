Chapter 1763: Nox Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Then, the two of them started drinking.

“Finn, do you want some?” Nox asked.

“You guys can go ahead. I have to take care of the babies later.”

“What a filial father,” Nox teased.

“When you have a baby, you’ll know what it’s like to be a father.” Finn was still immersed in the role of being a father.

Nox said indifferently, “I won’t be as corny as you guys.”

“By the way, Nox, when are you and Shelly getting married? You’ve been together for a year, right?” Monica suddenly asked,

To be honest, Nox did not know how to answer that question. He knew very well that Shelly would never marry him, but he could not say it out loud in front of so many people. If he did, they would be the ones embarrassed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Hence, he thought about it for a moment before saying, “I’m not that stupid to enter the tomb of love so early. I’ll just watch all of you suffer.”

He decided to take everything on himself.

“How stubborn.” Monica retorted, “One day, you’ll know what it’s like to love and be happy at the same time. I, too, never considered having a baby before and thought they were a pain in the *ss. But now, I think they’re delightful.”

“That’s you, not me.”

“I’m just reminding you out of kindness as a person who has been through it before. You should appreciate it-”

“Alright, Monica, that’s enough,” Jeanne called out to her. “Eat more, and you’ll be able to produce more milk.”

All Jeanne knew was how to poke fun at her. However, as long as Finn did not mind her being fat, she could eat as much as she wanted. With that thought in mind, she lowered her head and continued eating.

Harmony was restored at the dining table. While Edward and Nox were sipping on wine, the others would chime in occasionally. Jeanne and Monica would also take special care of Shelly and talk to her from time to time. In short, the atmosphere in the room was lively.

Nevertheless, Shelly was still somewhat overwhelmed, and it did not seem like it was because she was embarrassed by the dignitaries in front of her. When she thought about it carefully, it seemed like what Nox said had made her emotional.

She had never thought of marrying Nox. She even thought they would break up soon, but for some reason, she felt a little unhappy. To force herself to stop thinking about it, she took a deep breath and silently adjusted her emotions.

The meal lasted quite a while, mainly because Nox kept pestering Edward to drink. Monica and Finn had left early because she had to rush to take care of the baby. Hence, they ate from 12 p.m. to 2:30 p.m.

It was only after Edward got Nox drunk that Edward could escape. However, Edward was already a little tipsy by then. Jeanne held Edward up and got George to take care of Paige.

“Can you not go to work this afternoon?” Jeanne asked.

Edward glanced at Jeanne and nodded. He knew that he was dizzy and could not concentrate on work even if she wanted to.

“In that case, I’ll help you up to the hotel to get some rest.”

“Alright.” Edward nodded.

Jeanne supported Edward to his feet, and as they left, she said to Shelly, “Take care of Nox. He’s drunk.”

“Alright.” Shelly quickly agreed.

After Jeanne left with Edward, only Nox, Shelly, and Bella were left in the room, with Bella playing by herself in the private room.

Shelly nudged Nox. “Nox, wake up. I’ll help you to the hotel room. Can you sleep after you get there?”

Nox did not move. Instead, he muttered, “I want more drinks. I can drink. Edward, don’t be such a coward…

Shelly was speechless. She could not believe that they had both gotten drunk in the middle of the afternoon. Then, she thought for a moment before getting up and leaving with Bella.

She did not think she would be able to take care of Bella if she helped Nox up later. Hence, she carried Bella to the staff to get the room key card and then brought Bella to the room first.

When they were in the room, Shelly told Bella seriously, “Bella, can you watch TV here while I help Daddy up to sleep? But once I close the door, you cannot open the door for anyone. Do you understand?”

“Alright.” Bella nodded obediently.

Shelly checked the window again. After confirming that Bella could not open it, she walked out of the room, closed the door, and quickly went to find Nox. Just as she arrived at the elevator entrance, she bumped into Mrs. Winter, whom she found strangely distant now..
