…

Lucy left Kingsley’s room.

There were many assassins in the Hills. Every year, they would train a large number of them, and some had been trained since they were young. However, due to the high risk of being an assassin, there were too many deaths and injuries. Those who were left behind were only a limited number of people.

Moreover, in order to protect Jeanne, Kingsley already sent many top-notch assassins to South Hampton City.

Some top-notch assassins were also carrying out the Hills’ normal business. Hence, very few people could be selected for a last-minute mission.

However, testing Fourth Master Swan this time was not a small matter, so she could not randomly pick one.

She thought for a moment before saying to her assistant, K06, “I’ll go this time.”

“But what about Mr. Thorn?” K06 was a little surprised.

Lucy had always accompanied Mr. Thorn, and K06 had never seen her act alone in the past few years.

“We have limited manpower now. I’ll be more at ease if I go alone.” Lucy instructed directly, “Inform K09 and the Vermillion Bird to set off in half an hour.”

“Yes, ma’am,” K06 replied respectfully.

Lucy raised her head and glanced upstairs. In the end, she did not have much emotion.

…

In the dark night, the ancient and remote town was as quiet as it could be. It was the most remote place in Harken, but the border region had never been peaceful.

At that moment, a row of black cars was parked on the sparsely populated dirt road.

Everyone seemed to be waiting.

At 1 a.m., Nox turned off his muted cell phone, and the screen was flashing.

He looked at Edward, who nodded.

With that, Nox picked up the call.

“We’re here.”

“Ten minutes,” Nox answered before hanging up the call.

Nox said, “The other party is here.”

“Go over.”

“Okay.”

Nox told the driver to start the car and drive them to the destination.

They then arrived at a forest with grasses and trees. The surroundings were overgrown with weeds. It was a suitable area to hide in.

Since the cars could no longer drive in, the group of people got off the car and walked toward the trading area.

Slowly, the group of people also appeared on the opposite side.

Under the dark night sky, it was quite the situation.

“Fourth Master Swan, it’s been a long time.” The leader of the group stepped forward respectfully.

Edward shook hands with him. “Mr. Locke, it’s been a long time.”

“Have you brought the money?”

“Of course.” Edward made a gesture, to which Nox had a few of his men open the briefcases full of money.

Locke was very satisfied. He said, “It’s always a pleasure working with you, Fourth Master Swan. Bring them over.”

The people next to him quickly took out a wooden box, opened it rudely, and took out the things inside. “Harken definitely doesn’t have this weapon. It’s new.”

Edward gestured to Nox.

Nox stepped forward, took out a weapon, and aimed it directly at Locke.

Locke’s face darkened, and the people around Locke instantly raised their weapons.

Suddenly, Nox put down the weapon and played with it skillfully a few times before disassembling it.

Locke’s expression changed.

After Nox disassembled the weapon, he placed it back in the wooden box. Then, he turned to Edward. “It’s the real thing.”

Edward nodded.

Locke looked at Edward. “How is it?”

“It’s indeed a good item,” Edward replied.

Locke smiled coldly and said, “Hand over the money, and we will pass you the goods.”

“Sure,” Edward agreed immediately.

“Boys, bring them down.”

At the same time, Edward was also instructing Nox to hand the money over to the other party. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The transaction seemed to be going smoothly.

However, when the people on both sides were about to meet, Locke’s men suddenly shot at Edward’s men.

Edward and Nox were quick to react and dodged the bullets.

In an instant, the people on both sides started to fight, and twice the number of people showed up from the other side.

They had no chance of winning if they fought head-on.

As such, Edward said, “Evacuate!”

“Yes.” At a crucial moment like that, Nox always stayed obedient to Edward’s orders.

The two of them quickly left the scene of the fight and got into a black car, with Nox driving the car while Edward sat in the back seat.

However, two bodyguards were sitting in the front passenger seat and the back seat who left together with them.

With that, the car sped off, leaving the scene.

After leaving, a few people who were hiding in the depths of the forest came out.

Lucy did not expect that Fourth Master Swan would be schemed against during that deal.

The situation was that the other party wanted to extort the money without handing over the goods.

Yet, Fourth Master Swan left just like that?

Lucy made a call. “Mr. Thorn.”

“Are you in that old town?!”

“We have limited manpower.”
