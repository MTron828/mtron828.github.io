Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Since he had decided on something, he had to complete it immediately.

K01 jumped down from the balcony.

The moment he jumped down, he immediately attracted people’s attention.

K01 fell to the ground and fired a few shots. It did not hit the target, but it caused a commotion.

The two people in front and behind quickly caught up to K01, who dodged while deliberately luring them.

With four of them gone, the remaining three were much easier to deal with.

Edward jumped.

Other than the person who was holding Jeanne, the other two people beside her picked up their guns and quickly fired at Edward.

Edward rolled on the ground a few times, dodging the bullets, but he also forced himself into a dead end.

With that, he turned around, picked up his gun, and aimed at the two people approaching.

Just as he was about to shoot, a man threatened, “I’ll kill her if you shoot!”

Edward gritted his teeth and held the gun tightly in his hand.

At that moment, he finally saw Jeanne, who was still alive despite the many wounds on her body.

“Drop the gun!” the man shouted.

The black pistol in his hand was pointed at Jeanne’s head.

Jeanne also saw Edward. She just looked at him without saying anything.

Edward could not read Jeanne’s emotions.

“I’ll say it again!” The man who had the gun pointed at Jeanne’s head raised his voice. “I’ll count to three. if you don’t put down the gun, I’ll kill her immediately. Three, two–”

Edward immediately placed his gun on the ground.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly, and she looked a little emotional.

She was not surprised that Edward would come to save her, but she had never thought that Edward would put himself in such danger for her.

He was trying his best to save her because, no matter what, Edward liked her and would not watch her die. However, between his life and hers, she did not think that he would choose her without thinking twice.

Moreover, it did not mean she would survive even if he lowered the gun. In fact, putting down the gun would only put them both in danger.

Yet, he actually let it go. He actually threw his weapon on the ground to save her.

Jeanne stared at Edward.

At that moment, Edward’s mouth seemed to have opened.

From the shape of his mouth, she could tell that he was saying, “Don’t be afraid.”

He was about to die, yet he still told her not to be afraid.

She suppressed her emotions and watched as the two men in front of Edward approach him carefully and search his body. They took away all the weapons on him and threw them on the ground. After making sure that he had nothing on him, they dragged him to Jeanne’s side.

The two of them were shackled and brought to their destination.

Under the night sky, other than the sound of footsteps and gunfire, there was the sound of heavy breathing.

Both Edward and Jeanne had guns pointed at their heads. If they made the slightest movement, they would be shot dead.

The group walked for a distance until they saw a long flight of staircases in front of them, above which was a battle platform.

The two of them were forced to walk up.

Then, Edward and Jeanne appeared on a platform about 50 meters high, with someone pointing at their heads.

Immediately, a loudspeaker suddenly sounded in the empty night sky. “Hill, if you don’t put down your weapon, I will kill your family’s eldest daughter!”

Immediately after, a bright light shone on Edward and Jeanne.

Jeanne closed her eyes subconsciously. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Edward’s eyes were also dazzled by the light, and he could not open them for a second.

The two of them were pale from the light.

Meanwhile, the sounds of gunfire around them gradually died down until there was none.

Kingsley had clearly put down his weapon.

“What do you want?” Kingsley’s voice rang out from below.

“Back then, my sister was shot dead by your family’s assassin. I will never let this matter rest!”

“We, the Hills, only do things for money. Someone wanted to kill your sister, and we were just following the rules of the industry. If you want to seek revenge, you should go and look for the person who wanted to kill your sister.”

“I will definitely kill the person who wants to kill my sister. But before I kill him, I will have the Hills understand who you can and cannot touch!”

“You best understand if you have the ability to touch the eldest daughter of Hills!” Kingsley’s voice carried a hint of cruelty.
