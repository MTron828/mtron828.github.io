1007 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

They could even feel each other’s breathing.

At that moment, Jeanne closed her eyes and thought, ‘Between men and women, husband and wife… absence should make the heart grow fonder.’

However, the kiss she had imagined did not happen.

She could only feel Edward’s hand holding hers and taking the gun from her hand.

Jeanne’s fingers twitched. Then, she opened her eyes and looked at Edward’s handsome face up close.

He said, “This kind of thing shouldn’t exist between the two of us.”

The next second, she saw Edward throw the gun on her bed in a parabolic motion.

Jeanne smiled and said, “Alright.”

After that, she reached out and wrapped her arms around Edward’s neck.

Edward was still looking at her intently.

She said, “I’ve slept with you so many times, but I don’t think I’ve ever taken the initiative.”

Edward chuckled and said, “I’m afraid you’ll run away after, so...”

‘So?’ Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“I’m just inviting you to dinner.”

“Now?” Jeanne was surprised.

It was past midnight, and they were having dinner?

Nevertheless, Edward bent down and carried Jeanne in his arms.

He picked her up and closed the hotel door with his long legs. Then, he left the room with Jeanne.

Jeanne wrapped her arms around Edward’s neck and rested her head on his chest.

How long had it been since she heard Edward’s heartbeat?

It sounded sonorous and powerful.

She lay quietly in his arms as he carried her into the hotel’s high-class restaurant. At that moment, other than a few waiters standing in the dark, there were no other guests.

Edward placed Jeanne in the middle of the dining room, on a chair in front of the dining table.

After that, he returned to his seat like a gentleman.

The two of them sat opposite each other.

The moment Edward raised his hand slightly, the waiter respectfully served the dinner that had been prepared in advance and red wine.

Jeanne looked at the food in front of her.

It was so exquisite and gorgeous, but she felt that it was a little too extravagant.

Most importantly, she said, “I’ve eaten.”

“Well, I haven’t.” Edward looked at Jeanne with his deep eyes. “I’ve been waiting for you all night.”

“You could have asked me out earlier.” Jeanne replied bluntly, “I’ve been in my room.”

“I was afraid I’d disturb your plan. Isn’t tonight the most important part of your return?” Edward picked up his knife and fork and began to eat his dinner.

As expected, Edward knew everything.

“Nox just called me to say that everything is done,” Edward explained as he ate.

Jeanne responded with a nod.

There were some things she did not know how to explain to Edward.

For example, she had looked for everyone around him but not him. She could not find a reason to explain why she did it.

If she said she was afraid of meeting him, he probably would not believe her. He would not believe that she would not want to leave if she saw him.

Hence, she lowered her head, picked up her fork and knife, and started eating quietly.

“Nox rarely admires someone, but he just called and said that you’re smarter than he thought.” Edward took the initiative to start a conversation.

It was as if he was trying to avoid awkwardness between them.

“We’ve actually been paying attention to Michael for a long time,” Edward said as he ate his steak, “but we just haven’t been able to find anything against him. This person is too vigilant. Basically, he would notice anything we do, so we didn’t dare to alert him. I didn’t expect that you would lure him into the trap so quickly!”

“It’s not that I caught him too quickly, but because Michael doesn’t really threaten your interests, you won’t put in much effort to deal with him. However, Michael has threatened Monica. If he doesn’t die, Monica will die. I can only do my best.” Jeanne explained.

It was not a polite remark but the truth. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

To Edward, Michael was not an absolute threat.

He was just one of the Sanders’ useful talents. It would be better if they could get rid of him. However, if they could not, it would not affect them too much, so there was no need to spend too much time on Michael.

She knew too well that if Edward really wanted to touch someone, he would definitely be able to do so.

For example, he could hide the Duncans’ descendant so well and play the Sanders in his hands.

She really did not dare to brag about herself in front of him.

“For Monica’s sake, I’ll do my best,” Edward muttered, repeating her words.
