Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

That was when he concluded he was right. Finn’s eldest son was ugly!

In the delivery room. Monica felt like she was going to die. She had no strength left to push and wanted to take a breather, but Finn and the midwife refused to let her rest.

They said the baby might lack oxygen if it stayed inside for too long. However, she was exhausted. If she continued, she would die from exhaustion!

“Mrs. Jones, if you push as much as you just now, your second baby will be out soon.” the midwife said quickly.

“I’m out of breath, and I don’t have any strength left. I’ve used up everything I have to give birth to the baby boy.” Monica panted heavily.

“If you don’t have any strength left, we’ll have to use a vacuum to take the baby out,” the midwife said.

“What?”

“Otherwise, if the baby is in there for too long, it might run out of oxygen.” “Then, what will become of me?” Monica asked emotionally.

Were they going to put a vacuum in her? Was giving birth to a baby so scary? Just thinking about it terrified her.

“A fertile land,” Finn added.

As soon as he said that, the originally serious atmosphere in the delivery room lightened up when everyone laughed.

Monica was about to die from anger. “Finn, how are you still in the mood to joke around with me? I’m about to die!”

“You won’t die.” Finn said seriously, “I won’t allow you to die.”

But I really can’t push anymore.

“You can.”

“I really…”

“Then, get a vacuum!”

“Boohoo…” Monica felt aggrieved.

She could not understand why it was so difficult to give birth to a child!

She shouted at Finn, “Why can’t a man give birth to a child? Why must a woman give birth to a child? Why can’t you do it? If do it, I can make sarcastic remarks at the side too!”

Finn caressed Monica’s cheek. “If it’s possible, I would.”

“All you know how to do is coax me!” Although she did not believe Finn, she calmed down a lot after hearing Finn’s comforting words.

“Be good. If you push harder, we will be able to meet our second baby soon.”

“Why do I have to get pregnant with two at once? Boohoo…” Monica cried and pushed at the same time.

She, too, knew that if she delayed it any longer, she would not be able to accept it if anything happened to the baby. Hence, she gritted her teeth and pushed harder, with the midwife and Finn helping her.

Monica took a deep breath again and pushed. At that moment, she could not even make a sound because the moment she cried out, she would lose the rhythm of her breath, and it would be harder for her to push. Fortunately, after the first one was born, the second one was much smoother.

About ten minutes later, the midwife quickly said, “Alright, don’t push too much. Breathe slowly. I can see the baby.”

Monica did as the midwife said. Finally, she felt like she had pooped out a thousand years’ worth of shit, and she instantly felt relaxed. It was as if a huge weight had been taken off her body.

In the delivery room, another baby’s cry sounded, and it was much louder than the previous baby’s.

Then, she heard the midwife doctor say, “Girls are naturally more prone to crying than boys.”

Monica was stunned when she heard it was a girl, and so was Finn. All his attention was originally on Monica as he was touched that she had given birth to two babies for him. However, when he heard the midwife’s words, he was a little distracted.

They had done so many prenatal checkups but had never been able to see the gender of the baby. Hence, Finn eventually stopped trying to figure it out and thought they might as well find out when the baby was born.

It was what it was, and he had mentally prepared himself to have two sons. However, he did not expect the baby that he had never been allowed to see the gender of to be a shy girl.

At that moment, the smile on his face changed, and he became gentler.

“Finn, you’re smiling.” Monica looked at the change in Finn’s expression and was unhappy about it.

She Imew that Finn would not love her as much anymore after he had a

daughter.

“You gave birth to two babies! Should I cry instead of smile?”

“You didn’t smile like this when I gave birth to a baby boy.”

He was smiling as if he had won 50 thousand dollars. In fact, Finn would not be happy if he won 50 thousand dollars because he had no concept of money!

“You had another baby on the way just now! I was so worried about you that I

couldn’t be happy..”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
