Chapter 747: She Couldn’t Please Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica had nothing to say. Her mother was right.

“Come and help me deliver lunch to your cousin at noon.”

“Isn’t there food in the hospital?” Monica said irritably.

When Monica was hospitalized, her mother did not send her any food.

All her meals were fine dining meals catered from the hospital and it tasted pretty good.

“Your cousin said she wants to eat the soup I made. I have a gathering with my friends, so I can’t make it. That’s why I’m asking you to deliver it.”

“Where’s Uncle and Aunt?”

“Don’t you know how busy they are?” Ruby Harrison said, unhappy with the couple.

Since Sarah was born, not much effort has been made by her parents.

That was why Ruby doted on Sarah so much as Ruby wanted to make up for the lack of affection from Sarah’s parents.

“Sarah’s banged up, and they’re in the mood for work?”

“They said that there’s an urgent business to attend to.” Ruby said, helpless. “I just received their message. So spend some time with Sarah when you deliver the lunch. I’ll come over after dinner.”

“Alright.” Monica said in agreement.

Not that she had a choice. Sarah was always pampered in their family.

Monica called a taxi and headed to Cardellini’s villa where she waited for her mother to finish preparing the lunch before taking the taxi to the hospital.

She opened Sarah’s door.

Sarah Harrison was lying alone on the hospital bed. At this moment, because there were still many wounds on her body, it was not convenient for her to use her phone. She lay there alone, looking inexplicably pitiful.

When she saw Monica, her eyes lit up. “Cousin, you’re here!”

Monica was expressionless, but she couldn’t help but sigh. Sarah was just a child after all.

Although that child was also aiming for her man, she still couldn’t bring herself to be too calculative with Sarah.

“Mother ordered me to bring you lunch.”

“I knew you and Aunt Ruby always treated me the best.”

“I was forced to do this.”

“I know you have a sharp tongue but you’re a softie at heart.”

Monica glanced at Sarah but ignored her.

“Have you eaten?” Sarah asked as she ate.

“I’m not hungry. Once you’re done eating, I’ll go for a fancy meal. Maybe some hot crayfish, or steamed crab...” Monica listed down dishes. “In short, it’s all things you can’t eat now.”

“That’s so evil.” Sarah’s expression was resentful.

Monica couldn’t help but smile.

She had always been at odds with Sarah since young. Though if something really happened to Sarah, she wouldn’t just sit back and do nothing.

She suddenly recalled something Finn had scolded her about. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Saying that she… “a saint”. More accurately, he meant that Monica allows people to treat her like a doormat.

As Monica waited for her cousin to finish eating, Monica lay on the sofa beside her and fiddled with her phone.

She didn’t know how long her mother would be at the gathering, and she felt bored staying here.

Sarah looked at her cousin lying on the sofa. She couldn’t help but ask, “Cousin, will you be angry with me?”

“Huh?” Monica wasn’t paying much attention to Sarah.

“About me chasing Finn.”

Monica pursed her lips.

“I actually told you a long time ago that I liked Finn.” Sarah seemed to have taken great courage to talk to Monica about Finn. “But you always thought I was joking. Now that you’re divorced from Finn, I won’t give up this opportunity.”

“Go after him if you have the patience.” Monica continued using her phone nonchalantly.

“You don’t mind? You really don’t like Finn anymore?” Sarah appeared agitated.

What was the use of liking him? Finn already made it clear what his thoughts were.

Monica only felt a slight regret. She’ll show Finn he was wrong about her and Finn. In the end, even if they’re no longer together, Monica can tell him with her head held high that he was the one to let go of their relationship, not her.

“Monica.” Sarah did not get an answer from Monica and called out again, “Don’t be angry if I managed to get together with Finn in the future, okay?”

“I told you to go ahead if you have the patience and confidence. You don’t have to ask for my permission. A relationship is between two people, after all.” Monica’s tone was on the haughty side.
