1184 Nox, You’re Meant To Achieve Greater Things

It was also because of Warren’s death that Warren’s men were already out of their wits and were quickly under control. Some of them even chose to surrender the moment Warren died.

At least on that battlefield, the Duncans had won a big victory.

However, Nox was dead.

Was he dead?

Jeanne’s vision was blurred by her tears, and she suddenly saw a familiar figure, who quickly supported Nox’s body and checked his condition.

Then, he placed a pill in Nox’s mouth and whispered in his ear, “Nox, hold on.”

Nox’s seemed to move a little, and it made Jeanne a little excited.

She looked straight at Finn, who had suddenly appeared, and asked him about Nox’s situation.

“I don’t know if he’ll die.” Finn said bluntly, “Let’s leave this place first.”

With that, he picked Nox up and walked to the helicopter not far away.

Jeanne quickly got up from the ground. The moment she got up, her body went limp. As she fell, she tried her best to stabilize herself and quickly caught up with Finn.

The helicopter’s ladder lowered and pulled them up into the helicopter in the air.

Finn placed Nox on the helicopter and laid him flat. Then, he quickly took out a respirator and put it over Nox’s mouth.

He immediately ordered the pilot in the cockpit to fly to South Hampton City Central Hospital.

While Finn was focused on treating Nox, he was also contacting the hospital and making all the necessary preparations to save Nox. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After explaining everything, Finn raised his head and glanced at Jeanne. “How are you?”

She did not expect that Finn would still care about her at that moment.

She said, “I’m fine.”

“What about the baby?” Finn asked.

“I don’t know.” Jeanne shook her head.

She really did not know. Moreover, she did not seem to feel any pain now.

“Give me your hand,” Finn suddenly said.

Jeanne slowly stretched out her arm.

Even though Nox tried his best to protect her, her arm was still covered in wounds, and her body was covered in blood.

Finn took a stethoscope and gently rested it on Jeanne’s belly as if he was checking a pulse.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly. She did not know what kind of emotions she should be feeling at that moment.

Seconds ticked by, and after a long time, Finn retracted his hand.

Jeanne did not ask him for the result, and Finn did not tell her either.

All he said was, “Fourth Master is also in a coma now.”

Jeanne was stunned.

“It was caused by the drugs.” Finn explained, “In order to protect Alex, he was given hormonal drugs again. When the battle on the other side ended, Fourth Master fainted, and he told me to save you.”

She bit her lip, and her eyes were extremely red. After all that she had done, did he not blame her for it?

“The Sanders has been defeated.” Finn didn’t say too many emotional words and just described the results. “Stacey died on the spot because she didn’t receive timely treatment for her cerebral hemorrhage. Justin was shot dead on the spot because he resisted. Quinn didn’t resist and even chose to surrender, but she was still shot dead by Alex!”

Jeanne listened quietly.

In fact, she did not feel much for the Sanders.

Kingsley was right about how everything was the result of natural selection. If the Sanders were defeated, they would naturally suffer the same fate as the losers.

“Now that Alex has control over half of the government, and the Sanders has been defeated, Alex will soon be able to return to the stage of the Duncans’ history. All he needs is some outside push to the fore. In other words, the world will belong to the Duncans in the future.” Finn looked at Jeanne and said bluntly, “Jeanne, it’s not safe for you to stay in South Hampton City and Harken.”

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

As a member of the Sanders, or even if she was not one, she was still a member of the Hills. She should not stay in South Hampton City.

“Fourth Master told me to send you away, but now, I need to save Nox first.” Finn freed one hand and handed Jeanne a gun, a cell phone, and a car key. “Mason escaped during the chaos, so you can try to contact him. Once the helicopter leaves this forest, I’ll arrange for a car for you to leave. Right now, Edward and I are surrounded by Alex’s men. The only one who is flying the helicopter is Teddy.”

Jeanne was stunned.

She did not realize that Teddy was the one flying the plane. In fact, she never knew that Teddy could fly a plane!

Teddy quickly turned around, feeling aggrieved. “I just learned it. I learned it on my way here.”

That night, he received a call from Dr. Jones, who told him to come out and meet him.

He did not know what had happened, but since it was Dr. Jones’s order, he had no choice but to hide George in the Lawrence family’s manor and meet up with Dr. Jones himself.

That was right.

Dr. Jones had told him to take George to hide, but he did not know where was safe. After thinking about it, he remembered that no one lived in the Lawrence family’s manor and that it was a good place to hide. Hence, he brought George there.

It was really quite safe, and at least no one had found it.

However, when he was suddenly called out, he found it strange too! He was even told to fly a helicopter for no reason.

Fortunately, technology was advanced now, and the helicopter had an unmanned function. All he needed to do was sit in the cockpit and make sure that nothing went wrong. Other than that, there was not much else to do.

Jeanne looked at Teddy and swallowed the words that she wanted to say.

“George is safe now.” Finn said, “George is Fourth Master’s child. As long as nothing happens to Fourth Master, Alex won’t do anything to George, so he’s safe in South Hampton City. You can leave without worry. Once you feel better, Fourth Master will bring George to meet you.”

Jeanne frowned.

“You didn’t hear wrong. Once you’re safe and Fourth Master has settled the matters here, he’ll give up working for the Duncans and come to look for you,” Finn explained.
