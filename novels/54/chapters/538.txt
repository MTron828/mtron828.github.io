Chapter 539: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica said, “Jeannie, Michael’s image is damaged because of me. If I can help him, I have to.”

“Even if you can help him, there has to be a limit. You’re not great but foolish to use yourself to help him! If you help him and destroy yourself, do you think such help is meaningful? Monica, don’t think of yourself as a saint who is here to help all living beings!”

Monica was rendered speechless by Jeanne.

“Monica, we’re ordinary people, and you should care more about yourself. If you think this person is worth you doing so many things for him, you can as long as you don’t have to harm your interests in doing so. If you lose everything you have, that’s not considered helping at all.”

Monica was a little upset. She retorted, “I didn’t lose everything I have. Once Michael has everything back on track, I’ll leave him-”

“And be with Finn, right?” Jeanne asked.

Monica nodded. “Yes.”

“Do you think Finn will agree?” Jeanne found herself annoyed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica’s heart ached.

Then, her eyes darted at Finn. As she looked at his indifference, she said, “If he loves me, he will agree.”

“Do you think marriage is a child’s game, or what the hell do you think love is? Monica, do you know that the most unbearable part of love is suffering? Do you think that if you and Michael were to be together, based on the current political situation, you would be able to escape unscathed? I’m telling you, that’s a no! Once you compromise and be with Michael, you will always compromise because Michael’s positive image requires you to maintain it. Once you choose to leave, Michael’s image will be damaged again. That way, you’ll have to constantly compromise, and in the end, you can only be with Michael.”

“I won’t. I believe in what Michael promised me.” Monica seemed a little agitated. “One year. The agreement between Michael and I is one year.”

“Monica–”

“Don’t think so badly of Michael! He would never do anything to hurt me.” Monica interrupted Jeanne.

She refused to listen anymore.

Jeanne decided to swallow the words she was about to say. Right now, she was helpless against Monica.

When she first saw the gossip about Michael and Monica, she wanted to remind Monica not to make any wrong choices. However, after much consideration, she felt that since Monica had decided to be together with Finn, she would not do such a stupid thing. Moreover, if she deliberately called to remind Monica, it would only make the latter feel uncomfortable.

Edward said that Nox was secretly investigating Michael. If Michael had ulterior motives, it would be a good reason to convince Monica to stay with him. However, if Michael was really a good person, he would not make things difficult for Monica.

Little did she expect to see Michael and Monica in the headlines again this morning.

That was when she started realizing that something about it was off, but she could not believe that Monica had made the stupidest decision.

She had to calm herself down before saying, “Monica, not all forms of hurt have to be a wound on your body. Some are invisible, and the hurt comes gradually. In this case, you’re hurting yourself by giving up your happiness to help Michael. Do you understand?”

“No.” Monica kept retorting, “Michael didn’t ask me to help him. I was the one who volunteered.”

“So you willingly gave up your happiness and broke off your relationship with Finn?” Jeanne was furious now. “Is this voluntary or forced voluntary? If it puts you in a difficult position or makes you feel bad — even just a tiny bit of it — it isn’t voluntary! You’re just hurting yourself!”

Monica’s eyes were a little red.

Seeing that no one in the world, including Jeanne, understood why she was doing that, her tears started to fall.

On the other end of the phone, Jeanne could feel her emotions.

Knowing that she had spoken too harshly today, Jeanne took a deep breath and said, “You’re in the car, aren’t you? Come over to Bamboo Garden, and we’ll talk about it.”

“I’m on my way to get a divorce right now,” Monica said bluntly.

Jeanne could not hold it in any longer. “Monica, come over right now!”

“I’m going to get a divorce.”

“Monica, have you thought it through? You can’t act rashly.”
