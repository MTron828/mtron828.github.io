1059 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

When the morning sun rose, Ruby was asleep on the sofa.

Monica covered her with the blanket before she got up and left the ward.

Just as she walked out, Sarah ran out barefooted. “Monica.”

Sarah must have gotten off the bed and chased after her.

Monica turned around and looked at her.

“Monica, last night, you…” Sarah was still worried about what Monica did last night.

“It’s nothing. I ran into something last night, but I’m fine now.”

“Are you sure you’re fine?”

“Do I look like I’m not fine?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

Monica’s sudden seriousness made Sarah feel like Monica was her cousin again.

“Although you wish to get into higher vocational college, you’re always skipping classes. This is not what a senior-year student should do!” Monica reminded.

Sarah pouted. “I’d rather stay by my aunt’s side now.”

Monica smiled.

At least, she still had a relatively nice family. Take Sarah, for example. Although she had once hated Sarah, the latter could be of use at critical moments and warm her heart.

Monica left without saying anything more.

Before she left, she went to the payment room.

She had seen the bill in the ward in the morning and noticed that there was not much money left.

It made her wonder if Finn had suddenly called her over last night to remind her that it was time to pay the bill.

Fortunately, Cardellini Enterprise was not yet penniless, so she still had some money to spare for her father’s treatment.

She even thought that she had to pay more this time because otherwise, she might not have a single cent left.

She took her father’s medical record number and went to top up his account. She asked the staff, “Can I put in a few million?”

The staff member looked at Monica, checked the account, and said, “There’s already 5 million in there. Do you still want to top up the account?”

Monica was stunned as she had never topped up her father’s account before.

Could it be that her mother had gone to top up the account yesterday?

However, her mother did not even have a card with her. How could she have so much money?

“Can you check if it’s the correct account?” Monica asked the staff.

“Gary, 50 years old, heart transplant. He’s currently in the intensive care unit.” The staff checked the information with Monica. “Is that right?”

Monica nodded.

It was correct.

“Although your father’s fees are on the higher end and the daily expenses are expensive, you already have more than 5 million dollars in here. I suggest that you don’t rush to top up. If the money is low, the medical staff will remind you about it,” the staff member suggested.

“Alright.” Monica did not probe further.

She thanked him and left the hospital.

However, even as she was driving to the company, she was still a little baffled. Who on earth had paid for her? Moreover, they had paid so much at once.

Just then, her eyes narrowed.

Was it Finn?

Did Finn not call her over last night to talk about the payment but to say that he had already paid for her?

She did not think so.

Although Finn had a good income, he could not have 5 million in savings, could he?

With that thought in mind, Monica walked into her office.

Steve was a little surprised to see Monica. He had thought that she would at least rest for a day.

Had the incident yesterday happened to anyone else, they would definitely be traumatized.

“Did the police look for you yesterday?” Monica asked.

“No,” Steve quickly replied. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

“Chairman, your body–”

“It’s nothing.” Monica said, “In half an hour, call for a meeting with the department’s senior management. I have something to say.”

“Yes.”

Once Steve left, Monica turned on her computer and started to work. She was very calm and serious when it came to handling work matters.

Then, the phone rang.

Monica took a look at it but did not pick it up.

It rang a few more times, and just as Monica was about to blacklist that number, Michael sent a message. “If you don’t answer the phone, I’ll call the police.”

Monica pursed her lips and immediately called back.

The other party sneered. “Monica, you’re still afraid–”

“I just want to tell you that if you dare call the police, I’ll fight you and expose all the evil deeds you’ve done to me to the world. This is me now anyway, and my image doesn’t matter to me anymore. If you don’t care, let’s give it a try!”

...

“Monica!” Michael gritted his teeth.

He really could not threaten that woman now!

Monica abruptly hung up the phone, no longer getting triggered by Michael. Then, she turned to look at the computer screen.

At that moment, Tim knocked on the door. “Chairman, someone named Nox is looking for you.”

Monica’s fingers that were typing on the keyboard paused.

“Do you want to see him?” Tim asked.

“Let him in.”

“Yes.”

Nox pushed the door open and entered. When he saw Monica sitting in the office chair, he was still a little surprised.

He just could not get used to it, but he did not comment much.

He was only here today because someone had entrusted him to.

...

Before Monica could open her mouth to ask Nox why he was there, he said, “Don’t say anything. Let me tell you my arrangements.”

Monica frowned as Nox sat opposite her.

It was rare for him to wear a suit and tie, and he looked very formal today.

“I have a copy of Sunny Pharmaceutical’s drug composition here. I’ve compared it with Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s drugs, and the formula and content are exactly the same. However, according to common sense, there will definitely be differences in the same drugs produced by different manufacturers. However, the few best-selling drugs in the market now have the same ingredients, especially the micro-nano and hydroxyl composition that Cardellini Enterprise has applied for a patent. This is a research and development achievement that no other pharmaceutical companies have been able to achieve for many years.”

Monica just looked at him.

She still did not quite understand what Nox was trying to do. Or rather, she could not believe that he would come to help her.

“This report fully explains that Cardellini Enterprise’s technology and products have been stolen by a commercial company.” Nox said straightforwardly, “As far as I know, Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development staff only chose to jump ship to Sunny Pharmaceutical when Cardellini Enterprise was in a crisis. However, these drugs in Sunny Pharmaceutical were already on the market two months ago. It means that Sunny Pharmaceutical has stolen your technology.”

“Do you mean there’s a mole in Cardellini Enterprise?!”

“It’s impossible for Sunny Pharmaceutical to have your research and development technology just like that. If it were an established pharmaceutical company, it’s possible that they’ve been focusing on their research and development. However, Sunny Pharmaceutical is a newly-established pharmaceutical company. Before releasing new products, they were only a pharmaceutical agency. There is no way for them to have had their own research and development team then and to have the technology that Cardellini Enterprise has developed for so many years. The only possibility is that a mole in Cardellini Enterprise stole and gave your product technology to Sunny Pharmaceutical!”
