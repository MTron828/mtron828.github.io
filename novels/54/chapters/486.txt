Chapter 487: Jasmine’s Video Exposed, and a Slap in the Face

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Madam.” Teddy quickly stepped forward.

“Bring George back.”

What! He still wanted to stay and watch the highlights!

Then, Teddy felt a gaze shot at him, so he quickly brought George away.

Jeanne watched as George left before opening the video.

Everyone was staring intently at the screen. However, horror was written all over Jasmine and Eden’s face.

On the screen, a shining white scene appeared. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Elaine was watching it very seriously, and when she saw that scene, her face turned ghastly. She refused to take another look and shouted angrily at Jeanne, “Jeanne, you and Edward can save this to watch in private. Don’t you feel ashamed showing it in front of all these people?”

“Sister, why don’t you take a closer look?”

“Jeanne, why are you so shameless–”

“I’m not the shameless one!” Jeanne snickered.

Elaine’s eyes narrowed. At that moment, she also thought the contents of the video might be different, so she forced herself to look again.

She watched the two bodies tangle around each other in the room, and they kept going on exaggeratedly.

......

Everyone was blushing from watching it, but only Jasmine’s face was ashen. It was much paler than before as if her vitality had been sucked out and only her body was left.

In the video, the two of them were buried on the bed, and their faces were unclear. Only Jasmine knew that the woman in the video was her and that the man on top of her was Sam. It was the night before her wedding when she wanted to plot against Jeanne, but unexpectedly, Jeanne plotted against her in the end!

Moreover, she had never thought that Jeanne would have the video.

She thought that if Jeanne had the video, she would have exposed her immediately. In fact, it would have been exposed before she got married.

Never did she expect Jeanne would keep it hidden for so long. It was as if she was waiting for her to walk into the trap and humiliate herself.

No. She could not allow everyone to know that the person in the video was her.

There was no way.

Hence, she suddenly pushed Eden away like she had gone mad and ran straight to the laptop, wanting to slam the computer onto the ground.

Luckily, Jeanne was quick to react. She quickly picked up the laptop and avoided Jasmine’s approach.

Jasmine, as a result, lost her balance and fell directly onto the coffee table in front of her. She glared fiercely at Jeanne, her eyes turning extremely red.

Her ferocious appearance surprised everyone. In the next second, they saw the man on the screen flip over and expose the woman under him.

No!

Jasmine saw herself on the screen — her eyes were closed, and she was ravaged by the man in front of her in all sorts of ways.

No. No!

Jasmine’s vision was blurry, and she was on the verge of breaking down.

Jeanne looked at Jasmine, pressed the pause button, and said, “Do you still want to continue?”

That sentence was directed at Eden. By then, the horror on his face had turned to anger, and his veins were popping.

He looked brutal.

He had probably never thought there would come a day when Jasmine would cuckold him or news about him getting cuckolded would be exposed in public.

“You said that even if you broke up with Jasmine, Jasmine wouldn’t do anything to let you down, right?” Jeanne deliberately provoked Eden.

Eden’s eyes were bloodshot. As he looked at Jeanne’s smug look, he really wanted to kill her for embarrassing him to such an extent.

Before Eden could speak, Belle could not take it anymore.

She shouted at Jasmine, who was lying on the side of the coffee table. “You b*tch! How dare you cheat on my son? B*tch! I’m going to beat you to death. I have to!”

“Belle!” Jeanne stood in front of Jasmine.

Belle glared at Jeanne hysterically and roared, “Get out of my way. I’m going to beat Jasmine to death for seeing a man behind my son’s back! What a b*tch!”

“Before we settle your family affairs, I think we should settle our matters first. Dad, Elaine, and Richard are all waiting for this matter to come to light. Belle, I think it’s best not to waste more of everyone’s time.”

“What do you want? What do you want to do?” Belle looked like a madwoman.
