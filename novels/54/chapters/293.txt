Chapter 294: Jeanne Stays, and Fourth Master Swan Confesses

A familiar voice came from behind, causing Jeanne to clench her teeth unconsciously. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She knew very well

Everything was far from simple.

Fourth Master Swan had gotten many people involved to kidnap George, so he would not let Jeanne take him away so easily.

Jeanne was hoping to be lucky.

Facing such a situation was within her expectations. Nevertheless, her heart was still filled with rage.

Her eyes narrowed.

“Ms. Lawrence, it’s best if you don’t act rashly,” the man behind her said.

It was as if he could see what she would do next.

He said, “I don’t want to cause unnecessary harm between us, and I don’t want to implicate the innocent.”

As soon as he finished, Jeanne saw Nox appear on the balcony on the second floor and stand next to George.

Nox looked very helpless. “Jeanne, the kidnapping of George has nothing to do with me.”

He quickly clarified the situation.

Even so, he would obey Fourth Master Swan’s orders.

In other words, if Jeanne made any move at the moment, Nox would make a move on George.

The emotions that Jeanne had been holding back exploded bit by bit, but she was also restraining them bit by bit.

“Ms. Lawrence, if you understand, don’t resist. Come back to the house with me,” the person behind her said nonchalantly.

Edward knew that her emotions had reached their limits, but he chose a casual approach. Jeanne even felt that he had turned around and left.

It was as if he knew that she would follow him back to the house.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

She forced herself to calm down.

When she came back, she had thought that it would not be so easy.

Now, she had just guessed correctly.

She tried hard to calm herself down. She turned around and followed the tall man.

Under the dark sky, his broad shoulders and straight back were right in front of her…

For a moment, Jeanne was in a daze.

It was only for a moment.

She pursed her lips and followed Edward into the hall.

The lights in the hall were very bright.

Nox had appeared in the hall with George.

He yawned.

Nox felt that he was quite innocent.

Why did he have to get involved in this fight between the “married couple”?

He was so sleepy.

He wanted to go home to sleep.

Therefore, he collapsed on the sofa and looked at the couple helplessly.

He looked at the couple who had not spoken a word since they returned to the hall.

It was not only the two of them who did not speak, but the little brat was also waiting quietly.

Time ticked by…

Nox felt like he was more anxious than the people involved in the situation.

He could not take it anymore.

“Can the two of you speak?!” Nox broke down. “I’m going crazy.”

Edward turned to look at Nox.

Jeanne also looked at him. Slowly, her gaze landed on George.

George also looked back at Jeanne.

The mother and son looked at each other for a while.

Edward interrupted them. “Ms. Lawrence, you suddenly left without saying goodbye at the shopping mall. Where are you going?”

Jeanne turned back to look at the man who was talking.

Even though she had chosen to take George away like this, she was prepared to be caught by Fourth Master Swan at the scene.

Hence, she had prepared an excuse. “I’m leaving South Hampton City.”

Edward’s eyes obviously tensed up.

Jeanne added, “I’m leaving Harken.”

“So, you want to do what you did seven years ago. You want to leave as you please again.” Edward’s tone was indifferent. It carried a hint of coldness.

‘This is different from seven years ago.

‘I was forced to leave seven years ago.

‘Now…’

On second thought, Jeanne seemed to be forced this time as well.

She looked straight at Fourth Master Swan and said, “I don’t think I need to report my whereabouts to you, Fourth Master.”

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

It was obvious.

Nox was yawning at first.

When he heard the conversation between Edward and Jeanne, he suddenly felt energized.

Why was he so excited by this tense situation?

Nox looked at Edward and Jeanne like a busybody.

He heard Jeanne say again, “I’m not related to you at all, Fourth Master Swan. Aren’t you being... too controlling?”

‘Too controlling!!!’

Nox wanted to laugh.

This was probably the first time a woman despised Fourth Master Swan so much.

On second thought, what Jeanne said was not unreasonable.

To put it bluntly, Fourth Master Swan had no relationship with Jeanne, so what right did he have to stop her actions?
