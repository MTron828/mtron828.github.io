996 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

The scene was silent.

Monica’s words were so domineering that Daniel, the head of the quality inspection department, was left stunned on the spot.

He could not say a word for a long time. He just stared straight at Monica.

Monica, of course, did not give Daniel any way out. She continued imposingly, “Director Cook, the fact that you don’t dare to admit that the quality inspection department can’t produce a full quality inspection report in a week means that for the quality inspection department, a week is enough to ensure the result’s quality. Of course, I fully believe that the quality inspection department, under the Sanders’ governing, can’t be what Director Cook just said. I also believe that all the previous reports from the quality inspection department are true and valid and that there were no mistakes with them.”

Monica recognized one of the abilities of the quality inspection department. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, it was not to praise the quality inspection department but to verify what she was going to say next.

She was clear-cut and logical as she said, “Since there is no way that the quality inspection department would issue a faulty quality inspection report, the only explanation for the results of Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine is that someone did it on purpose! He deliberately framed us and wanted to put us out of business! I’m not making it up. I have my logic and reasoning.”

All the reporters at the scene looked at Monica with anticipation.

The words “hurry up and say it” kept appearing in the comment section of the live stream.

Monica took her time to continue, “Let’s analyze Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s incident from the beginning. A little boy died because he was injected with Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine. Everyone accused Cardellini Pharmaceutical, and the entire country even boycotted us, putting our company on the verge of collapse. But of course, that’s not the main point. The main point is that the little boy’s autopsy results showed that his death was caused by potassium cyanide and had nothing to do with the vaccine. Think about it. The official vaccination center of the Sanders, as a designated hospital for tens of thousands of children, will never be able to explain the existence of the highly toxic potassium cyanide.”

The reporters at the scene nodded repeatedly.

The screen kept flashing with comments that say, “We’re confused. Please give us the answers.”

“Its existence is not an accident. Someone must’ve brought it there on purpose. Why did this person bring it there and use it on that boy? The boy’s family was an ordinary working-class family and didn’t make enemies with anyone. We also did a background check on the staff member who administered the vaccine. He wasn’t a native of South Hampton City and hadn’t been in South Hampton City for long. He had just started working at the vaccine center, so he had never met the boy’s family before. Therefore, it could be ruled out that the boy was killed because of a vendetta! Since the possibility of a vendetta has been ruled out, we can logically conclude that the boy’s death was to frame Cardellini Pharmaceutical. After all, the best way to make a pharmaceutical company go bankrupt is if there’s a problem with the product. There’s no other way!”

“Perhaps everyone will ask, why did he or she want to frame Cardellini Enterprise?” Monica looked at everyone and answered her own question, “Because Cardellini Enterprise has made an enemy of someone!”

There was an uproar.

“I believe everyone can figure out who the enemy is if you think about it carefully.” Monica deliberately left the audience with suspense.

It was to draw everyone’s interest, and everyone had no choice but to follow her rhythm.

Monica said, “Michael!”

That one word made everyone at the scene gasp in shock.

Everyone on the live stream was also shocked and probably did not know how to believe it.

Yet, at the same time, they wanted to know the result.

“My wedding with Michael came to an end after I exposed his disguise in public. Michael should’ve had a bright future, but because of his private relationship with me, his career was ruined. He held a grudge, so he plotted this to take revenge on me, causing Cardellini Pharmaceutical to be destroyed! My suspicion of Michael is not without reason. As the former director of the quality inspection department, he knows everything about the quality inspection industry and how to make this matter look like an accident. He even had a bit of power to influence the people in the quality inspection department to come up with a faulty report!”

Monica turned to face Daniel and said clearly, “If I remember correctly, Director Cook is qualified to take on the position of director of the quality inspection department because of Michael’s recommendation of you back then, which made you Michael’s deputy. That’s why you’re qualified to take on the position of director of the quality inspection department after Michael left! Since Michael has done you a favor, you’re repaying him and returning the favor now!”
