Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Paige stopped at the sound. When she saw Chloe, she called out obediently, “Hi, Aunt.”

“Where are you going barefooted?” Chloe walked in front of Paige and asked her gently.

“To find Mommy,” Paige answered honestly.

“Your mom is still sleeping. Why don’t I bring you out to play?” “No, Mom wants me to kiss her every day.” Paige refused. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chloe felt a little embarrassed after being rejected so directly.

“Paige, do you want some ice cream?”Chloe asked. Paige’s big eyes were shining because she loved ice cream.

“Come with me downstairs. I’ll buy you ice cream now, okay?”

“Uh…” Before her mother and her favorite ice cream, she began to hesitate.

“Let your mom sleep a little longer. We’ll go look for her after we’ve had ice cream, okay?” Chloe tried to tempt her. “Otherwise, if your mother finds out, she definitely won’t let you eat it.”

Having been deceived by Chloe, Paige nodded and held Chloe’s uninjured hand as they went downstairs together.

Behind them, a half-closed door suddenly closed. George sat in his wheelchair and returned to his bed.

How smart was Candice? She was actually stupid enough to invite a wolf into her house!

Candice waited for a long time, but Paige did not wake her up. Surprised, she could not help but get out of bed and go straight to Paige’s room to see if Paige had overslept or was sick. However, Paige was not in her room.

The nanny who was taking care of Paige was tidying up the room. She looked at Candice and said respectfully, “Madam.”

“Where’s Paige?

“Didn’t Paige look for you first thing in the morning?”

“No, she didn’t.” Candice was getting a little agitated.

“No, she’s been out for a long time. I wanted to accompany her, but she said she wanted to look for you herself and didn’t allow me to go with her. I….” The nanny was also shocked.

Candice tried her best to remain calm as she rushed downstairs. The moment she went downstairs, she saw Paige and Chloe sitting together on the sofa, happily eating ice cream. She held it in.

The nanny was also following behind, and when she saw that Paige was home, she heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sis, you’re up.” Chloe called out to Candice warmly when she saw her, making it seem like they had a good relationship as sisters.

Candice responded and walked toward them unhurriedly.

Paige was also very excited to see Candice. “Mom.”

“Why are you eating ice cream so early in the morning?” Candice was obviously displeased.

“Uh…” Paige lowered her head as if she had done something wrong.

“Sis, don’t be so harsh on a little kid for having ice cream.” Chloe deliberately pretended to be a good person. “The most important thing is that you’re happy.

Isn’t that right, Paige?”

As Chloe spoke, she became friendly with Paige.

When Paige heard Candice’s words, she quickly replied happily, “Yeah, I’m happy too. Ice cream is the best thing in the world.” “I will take you out for more ice cream in the future, okay?”

“Okay. I love you the most, Aunt.”

“If you love me, just give me a kiss.” Chloe leaned over.

Paige was not stingy and kissed Chloe’s cheek. The two of them looked extremely intimate, and Candice just watched them.

Eventually, Candice turned around and said as she left, “Paige, when you’re done with your ice cream, come over for breakfast.”

“Alright,” Paige said in her soft and cute voice and nodded obediently.

When Candice was at the dining table, Teddy placed Candice’s breakfast in front of her as he did every morning, and Candice was already used to it.

“Teddy, keep an eye on Paige in the future. She shouldn’t have ice creams so early in the morning.”

“I tried to stop her, but Second Miss said I was being a busybody.” Teddy was filled with anger.

“Come look for me next time.”

“Second Miss forbade me from looking for you.”

Candice’s face darkened.

“You two sisters seem close, so I don’t want to affect your relationship,” Teddy explained.

Teddy could not be blamed for thinking that way.

Ever since Chloe moved in, Chloe’s attitude toward her seemed to have changed. She was always calling her elder sister, making people think that the two sisters were close.

“I don’t have a good relationship with her.” Candice enunciated each word.

“Don’t hide it from me next time..”
