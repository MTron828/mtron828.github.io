1246 Zachary’s Death

“You’ve given the world an outstanding Edward.” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

Zachary was stunned.

“You should have seen a lot of news and know that Edward is doing very well in politics. His success can benefit the entire Harken, so you’re a great man.” Jeanne affirmed him.

At that moment, Old Master Swan was really amused by Jeanne. It was probably his first sincere smile in a long time.

“So, you really don’t have to feel sorry.” Jeanne forced a smile.

Old Master Swan nodded, seemingly convinced by Jeanne.

He said, “I always thought that you would blame me.”

“No, I don’t,” Jeanne answered with certainty.

She had no right to complain about Old Master Swan. From his perspective, there were a lot of things he could not control too.

“Don’t hate Edward either,” Zachary said in a low voice.

“No, I don’t,” Jeanne continued to affirm him. “I don’t hate him. If it weren’t for him, I would’ve been dead. I can live longer because of him, so I really don’t hate him.”

“Is it true that you’ve never hated him?” Zachary looked at Jeanne intently.

Jeanne bit her lip.

“I met Susan today,” Zachary said straightforwardly.

Jeanne nodded.

“Because of Alex’s request, we have to cooperate.”

“I understand that.”

“Jeannie,” Old Master Swan suddenly called her by her nickname.

He had probably acknowledged her status in the Swans.

He said, “I’ve asked Teddy about your relationship with Edward recently, and he said you’ve been pushing Edward away. Of course, I understand why you’re doing this. Perhaps you think that by doing that, you’re letting go.”

“I’m trying to let go,” Jeanne said firmly. “I only have two months left to live. I don’t want us to be too involved with each other. I don’t want him to be sad or feel reluctant to part with me.”

“No, you actually still hate him.” Old Master Swan exposed her.

Jeanne bit her lip.

“Perhaps you don’t hate Edward alone. You hate your identity, what you’ve gone through, Edward’s identity, what he has gone through, and even Alex’s existence.”

Jeanne remained silent.

She did not allow herself to think that way. However, she could not refute Old Master Swan’s words.

Zachary looked at Jeanne and said seriously, “Perhaps what I’m saying is a little selfish, but I hope you can let go of your prejudice and hatred for Edward and treat him better. Whether it’s for a lifetime or only for two months, he hasn’t been given much warmth in his life.”

Jeanne’s throat moved.

She did not agree, and Zachary did not force her to agree either.

He said, “Jeannie, lastly, I would like to apologize to you.”

Jeanne looked at Zachary.

“If I didn’t stop you, you and Edward wouldn’t have ended up like this.” Zachary’s eyes were still red when he said that.

It was probably the thing he regretted the most in his life. That was why he was so emotional.

“I know that if Alexander hadn’t sent you abroad, Kingsley wouldn’t have looked for you. It had been so many years, so he should’ve known about your existence. Yet, he didn’t take you away, probably because he didn’t want you involved in all this bloodshed. However, because of what happened to you, he took you away and made you and Edward enemies. If I hadn’t stopped you back then, you would’ve been with Edward. Then, you wouldn’t have known your identity, and I believe that Kingsley wouldn’t have told you his true identity. Not only that, but Warren wouldn’t have thought of using you to achieve his goals, and you would’ve been a carefree little girl.”

Jeanne’s eyes turned red as she held her emotions in.

Actually, it was not that she had not thought about it. If she had not been rejected by Old Master Swan, she might not have had to go through so much.

Although there was a lot of hatred in her, as long as she didn’t know, she could continue to live innocently. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You may not know this, but when Edward came back covered in blood and learned that you had left, it was obvious how much pain he was in. That was the first time I saw his emotional side since I raised him. His unconcealed emotions moved me, but I didn’t think I did anything wrong. After all, with Edward’s identity, it’s better for him not to have any feelings. Once too many feelings were involved, it would be easy to be tied down. I was still glad that I made the decision to cruelly reject you back then, but now…” Zachary choked up. “It’s too late for regrets.”
