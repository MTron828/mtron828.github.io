Chapter 1733: The Twins’ Names

“You’re in the recovery phase now, so you shouldn’t tire yourself out.” “I’m just getting out of bed. How am I tiring myself out?” Monica asked.

“You’ve tired yourself out giving birth to two fat children.”

Monica was speechless.

“Why don’t I brush your teeth for you?” Finn suddenly suggested.

In the end, Monica took the toothbrush from Finn. She did not think Finn was joking when he said he would brush her teeth for her. After rinsing her mouth, Finn wrung a hot towel for her to wipe her face and hands.

Once everything was done, the hospital delivered the meal and placed it on the simple dining table on the hospital bed.

The moment Monica picked up her utensils and was about to eat, Finn said, “I’ll feed you.”

“No need.”

“Your mom said that the more rest a woman has during the recovery period, the better health they will be in in the future,” Finn explained.

“But I will still be able to take care of myself,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn smiled. “It’s okay. Even if you can’t take care of yourself, I’ll take care of you.”

It seemed like there was no way she could get through to Finn now. Therefore, she eventually gave in, and Finn fed her until she finished her meal. Feeling happy and satisfied, Monica lay motionless on the bed. At that moment, she felt that everything in the world was perfect.

While she lay there, she saw that the two babies in front of her had woken up. As if they were telepathic, one baby woke up and cried, and the other one followed, filling the room with the sound of babies crying. Fortunately, the experienced nanny quickly changed the babies’ diapers and fed them milk.

Monica, on the other hand, just stared at the two babies. She still found it unbelievable that she had given birth to two children and that she was going to be a mother.

As she was staring at them in a daze, the curtains in the room were suddenly pulled around her bed, separating her bed from the outside.

Monica looked at Finn in front of her and was a little frightened as she said, “Finn, the doctor said you can’t…’

“Can’t what?” Finn asked.

“You can’t have s*x.” Monica complained, “I just gave birth!”

Finn could not help but laugh. “Monica, how desperate do you think I am?” Was he implying that she was cheap?

“The nanny said you should keep your body clean, but it’s best not to take a shower on the first day. So, I thought I’d give your body a wipe for you,” Finn explained.

“Oh,” Monica replied.

As expected, Finn was not someone who could not control himself.

She watched as Finn carried a basin of hot water over and began to undress her. Although they had been together for many years and had seen each other’s bodies, it would be awkward if only one of them took off their clothes.

“If you’re embarrassed, close your eyes.” Finn seemed to have seen through Monica’s thoughts.

Monica quickly closed her eyes but felt that something was amiss immediately after. Hence, she suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Finn.

“Shouldn’t you close your eyes?”

“How can I clean you up if I close my eyes?”

“Then, what the hell is the use of me closing my eyes?”

“So that you can fool yourself.”

‘F*ck!’ Monica cursed to herself.

However, Finn did not stop what he was doing just because Monica’s face was as red as a tomato. He was very skilled and very careful as he cleaned her up, not missing any part of her body. After wiping her clean, he helped her change into a new set of hospital gown.

Monica did not know if it was her imagination, but she thought she heard Finn take a deep breath when he turned around, reacting weirdly.

When the curtain was pulled open again, the nanny asked Monica, “Madam, do you think you’re lactating?”

“Lactating?” Monica was dumbfounded.

Did she need to be producing milk as well? Would that not make her a cow? Being a woman was not easy at all! Her entire body structure had changed after she got pregnant.

“Yes, some pregnant women lactate quickly.” The nanny said, “I can check it for you.”

Just as she was about to walk toward Monica, Finn came out of the bathroom. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It’s okay. I just checked. There’s nothing for the time being.” When Monica heard Finn’s words, her entire face turned red again..
