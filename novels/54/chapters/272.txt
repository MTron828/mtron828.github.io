Chapter 273: A Saving Grace Should Be Repaid With Your Body

Jeanne’s gaze was also fixed on her phone.

After a long while, she received a message: [At 8:00 am today, Melody was left naked and injured on the pedestrian street in front of the most luxurious luxury brand store in South Hampton City. As many people were shopping on Sunday, many people came and went, causing the Sanders to lose face.]

Jeanne looked coldly at the message sent by Kingsley.

It seemed that Kingsley was recounting Melody’s suffering.

Jeanne exited the chat and opened the news client, but there was no information about Melody on the news.

She returned to the chat.

Kingsley sent another message: [Of course, the news agency didn’t dare to report the news about the Sanders, but because Melody appeared on the busiest street, many people saw it. Many people even took photos. Not all of them were spread, but a small part of them was. Everyone in the government knew about Melody’s matter in an instant. The chief flew into a rage. After Melody was brought back to their residence, she wasn’t given any treatment and was directly thrown into their confinement room. I heard that she’s on her last breath.]

Jeanne continued to look coldly.

What would happen to Melody was her own business and had nothing to do with her.

All she did was return an eye for an eye.

[I remember reminding you that Melody is the chief’s most beloved daughter.]

[So, you’re not asking what I experienced under Melody’s methods last night.] Jeanne replied.

It was just that she felt a chill in her heart.

There was no reply from Kingsley.

Jeanne continued to type another message: [Isn’t she known as the most beloved daughter because the chief thinks that she’s more useful?! Now that he knows that she’s useless, shouldn’t he thank me?!]

[Jeanne.] Kingsley sent two words over.

Jeanne’s expression was a little ugly.

She could imagine Kingsley’s anger.

Jeanne admitted that she was just quibbling—deliberately quibbling.

She also longed for Kingsley to greet her and care about her.

She did not want him to treat her so coldly because she did something that he thought she should not do.

[What I care about has never been Melody’s life or death. What I care about is that you’ll pay the price for this!] Kingsley seemed to be gnashing his teeth as he typed the message.

Price?!

What other price could Jeanne not bear?

“The Sanders will have more than one Melody. If this Melody is gone, there’ll always be someone to replace her!”

Jeanne looked.

She looked at the message Kingsley sent her.

In the end, he sent another message: [Take care of yourself.]

Their conversation ended there.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly.

The change in her expression was very obvious.

Edward also noticed it, but he did not ask her.

The stalemate lasted for a few seconds.

Jeanne put down her phone and tried her best to look at Fourth Master Swan without any emotion.

The steaks that he was cooking had all been burnt.

Fourth Master Swan also felt that he was not a good cook. He said, “Forget it, I’ll get someone to send some food over.”

“Let me do it.” Jeanne took the initiative.

Edward frowned slightly.

Jeanne asked, “Do you have any extra steaks?”

Edward took out two more pieces.

Jeanne got down from the bar chair and walked into the kitchen.

Edward made space for her.

Jeanne started to fry the steaks.

She was very skillful, and she did not look like a newbie.

“You know how to cook?” Edward asked her.

Jeanne nodded.

“Did you learn it in those few years abroad?” Edward continued to ask.

“Yes.”

“Why didn’t you come to me before you went abroad?” Edward kept looking at her, seeing how she was somewhat silent.

Jeanne’s eyes moved. She looked at the butter in the frying pan melting bit by bit.

She did not answer.

Some things were over if they were over. She did not want to bring it up again.

Edward did not ask further.

The two of them seemed to have formed a tacit understanding.

When one of them did not want to talk, the other one would choose not to speak anymore.

For a moment, it was a little quiet.

In the kitchen, there was only the sound of the steaks sizzling in the pan.

“Why didn’t you ask for help when you were abroad for a few years?” Edward suddenly asked.

Jeanne had always felt that Fourth Master Swan was not a person who liked to talk. However, today, he seemed to be a little talkative.

“I didn’t?want to ask for help.” Jeanne appeared very indifferent.

She always felt that she could survive on her own.

If life was a little bitter at the beginning, she might be able to endure it slowly.

Kingsley was right.

Jeanne’s personality was actually not good at all. Sometimes, she was just so stubborn.

It was clear that back then when she was abroad, she did not have to live such a miserable life. Even so, she gritted her teeth and endured it.

“Nox said that you disappeared completely for three years when you were abroad.” Edward’s tone was indifferent as if they were talking about the weather today.

Jeanne glanced at him.

Edward said straightforwardly, “I’ve investigated you.”

Jeanne smiled.

Right.

How could someone like Fourth Master Swan let others get close to him so easily.

After Jeanne came back, she had become completely different from before. Of course, he would pay attention to her.

“What’s your relationship with Kingsley?” Edward asked her straightforwardly.

“Fourth Master,” Jeanne said while frying the steak, “Let Nox help you investigate my matter. I won’t tell you.”

Edward looked at her as if he was sizing her up.

“Fourth Master, stay away from me.” Jeanne also turned her head to look at him.

The two of them looked at each other.

They looked at each other.

Jeanne enunciated each word clearly and told him, “I have bad Intentions!”

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

Jeanne did not pay attention to Fourth Master Swan’s emotions.

She turned around and plated the steaks. Then, she boiled the black pepper sauce that had been prepared long ago.

Everything was ready.

Jeanne poured the black pepper sauce on the steaks and picked up the plates. “Fourth Master, we can eat now.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Edward took the plates from Jeanne’s hands.

He placed them on the dining table in the dining room.

Jeanne took out knives and forks from the cupboard and followed behind him.

Edward put down the plates and pulled out the rather heavy dining chair for Jeanne.

Jeanne sat down, and Edward sat next to her.

She handed a knife and a fork to Fourth Master Swan. “Have a taste and see if it’s overcooked.”

Edward nodded.

The two of them started eating silently.

Perhaps they were too hungry, the two of them ate rather quickly. Moreover, the two steaks that were not considered small were finished by the two of them!

Jeanne wiped the corners of her mouth.

“Fourth master, I should go back.”

Edward turned to look at her.

“Thanks for saving my life last night,” Jeanne said. She smiled slightly and added, “There’s no way to repay you.”

After that, she did not say anything else.

It meant that there was no way she could repay Edward.

She only thanked him.

“You can give your body in return,” Fourth Master Swan said straightforwardly.

Jeanne knew he could say such words very naturally.

“I’ve said that I came with bad intentions. Fourth Master, it’s best if you don’t draw fire to yourself.”

“If you come with bad intentions, I’ll accept all of it.”

As Edward finished, he suddenly moved his face closer to Jeanne.

At such a close distance, Edward paused for a second. Next, he pressed his lips hard against Jeanne’s.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She looked at Fourth Master Swan in front of her. This man who should have been unapproachable was now so close to her and kissing her deeply.

Jeanne did not know how to react at this moment.

She did not know if she should push him away or take the initiative.

Or, should she passively accept it?

Jeanne closed her eyes.

She should repay Edward’s saving grace with her body.

She would repay him with her body alone…

In the huge room, the temperature in the air seemed to be getting higher and higher.
