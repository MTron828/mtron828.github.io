“How should I arrange it?” Lucy asked.

She really did not know.

“Open the door for me tonight. When I’m sleeping with Mr. Thorn, you can leave the room.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Sure,” Lucy agreed.

“I didn’t expect you to be so sensible.” The woman stared at Lucy. “If you listen to me, I guarantee you won’t be too sad in the Hills.”

“Thank you.” Lucy was very sincere.

In an unfamiliar environment, the most important thing was to make friends, not enemies.

Therefore, just as they were about to go to sleep at night, there was a knock on the door. Lucy quickly opened the door and saw the woman who had talked to her today.

That woman was called Daisy. She was currently the number one female assassin in the Hills. As she had a close relationship with Kingsley, she could often enter Kingsley’s room. She had a high status among the assassins, and many people were afraid of her and even tried to curry favor with her.

“Mr. Thorn is preparing to go to sleep,” Lucy reported.

Daisy nodded and gave Lucy a look. Seeing that, Lucy hurriedly walked out of the room and even closed the door for them.

She was about to wait at the door when she suddenly heard a baby crying. Since she did not know how long she would have to wait, she thought she might as well go and see Kingsley’s niece.

Considering that Kingsley had instructed her to take care of Jeanne and George, she naturally followed his orders.

She Imocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Lucy pushed the door open and entered to see that George was crying and Jeanne looked helpless.

“Why is he crying?” Lucy asked.

“I don’t know either,” Jeanne replied.

It was her first time being a mother, so she did not know many things. Furthermore, the people here, even the servants, had never given birth before, and no one knew how to coax a baby.

“Is he hungry?” Lucy asked according to common sense.

“I just fed him.”

“Is he feeling unwell?”

“I don’t know if he is.”

“Did he poop?” Lucy asked.

“I don’t know.”

“Let’s see.” With that, Lucy went over to help Jeanne check George’s little butt.

The moment she opened the diapers, sure enough, the stench of poop filled the room.

That was the first time Lucy was so caught off guard by the smell of someone’s poop, and she was not used to it. However, Jeanne seemed to be used to it.

She picked George up. “I’m going to wash his butt.”

“Let me help you.”

“Don’t you think it stinks?” Jeanne asked.

She had clearly seen Lucy’s expression just now.

“I’ll probably be fine after a few times.” Lucy did not deny it.

Jeanne did not refuse Lucy’s offer to help.

Lucy had always thought that Jeanne was the kind of person who was unreasonable and even difficult to please. Yet, after exchanging a few words with Jeanne, she suddenly found Jeanne to be a very straightforward person.

After the two of them washed George’s butt and changed his diapers, George stopped crying. He even blinked his beautiful eyes and stared at them.

“Your son is really handsome.” Lucy lamented, “He looks like his dad, right?”

She said that because he did not look like Jeanne at all. However, Jeanne did not answer, and Lucy immediately stopped asking. After all, people could die from talking too much sometimes.

Therefore, she quickly changed the topic. “Can I hold him?”

“You want to hold him?” Jeanne seemed a little surprised.

“Can’t 1?”

“I just thought that assassins weren’t interested in children.” Jeanne said, “Kingsley hasn’t even held him.”

Jeanne knew very well that it was not because Kingsley rejected her and her son. If he rejected them, he would not have brought them back.

On the contrary, having children was not a concept that Kingsley understood, or to put it bluntly, the man did not have any compassion at all. Therefore, he did not believe that the child needed to be cared for or doted on. In his eyes, babies were invulnerable.

“Didn’t Kingsley tell me to help you with taking care of him? I’ll just have to get used to it,” Lucy said bluntly.

She did not lie about the fact that assassins were not interested in children.

Without saying much, Jeanne handed George to Lucy.

Lucy obviously did not know how to hold a baby, so Jeanne taught her for a while before she could hold George more comfortably.

When George was in Lucy’s arms, George smiled at her, and it made her laugh.

That was why assassins were not allowed to have children. It was because children were an obstacle in an assassin’s career and life. After giving birth, one’s heart would not be as cold anymore..
