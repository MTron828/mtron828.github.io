Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was already 10 p.m.! He could not believe that he had slept for so long. Did Shelly not say that she would wake him up for dinner? As expected, it was just a casual remark. Although he was a little disappointed, he was calm about it. In any case, he had accepted Shelly’s dislike for him.

Then, he climbed out of bed. As soon as his feet touched the ground, he yelped, “0w!”

It hurt so much more than before. He did not know if it was because he had not moved for too long, but when he got off the ground, he pulled the wound on his knee. It felt like it had stretched his skin apart.

After a long time, he managed to gather himself, stand up from the bed, and carefully open the bedroom door. That was when he saw Shelly watching TV on the sofa in the living room.

The volume of the television was very low, but she could not hear anything from the bedroom. Hence, he thought Shelly was asleep and that she chose to sleep in a separate room to avoid touching his wound. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Just as he had found an excuse for Shelly, he suddenly realized that Shelly was still watching TV in the living room.

Seeing that he was awake, she quickly stood up from the sofa and walked toward him. “Are you awake?”

“Yes.”

“I’ll help you to the sofa first. Then, it’ll be a few minutes before we can eat.”

“Were you waiting for me?” Nox asked.

Had she been waiting for him because she was afraid of disturbing his sleep, or was he overthinking things again just like last night, when she waited for him because she wanted to remind him that Bella’s sports day was today?

He felt a little nervous when Shelly said, “Yes, I was waiting for you.”

Nox was very excited, yet he was forcing himself to suppress it. He was afraid that Shelly would think he was an idiot if he showed it.

Nox sat on the sofa while Shelly turned around and went to the kitchen. It did not take long before Shelly placed the food on the table. It should have been cooked long ago and kept warm.

Shelly placed a plate with some grilled chicken and a pair of utensils in front of him. After everything was done, she went to the sofa to help Nox to the table. Every time Nox changed from one position to another, her knees would tremble in pain for a second.

“Does it hurt?” Shelly asked nervously.

“It’s alright.” Nox pretended.

“Don’t move your right foot. Try to walk with one foot, and I’ll support you,” Shelly suggested.

“Can your small body support me?” Nox found it amusing.

Shelly, however, was a little unhappy. She said bluntly, “But I hold on every time you try to put your weight on me.”

“When did I put my weight on you…” Nox immediately understood that Shelly must be referring to when they were in bed.

After Shelly said that, her face turned red. The two of them seemed to be a little embarrassed. Amid the awkwardness, there seemed to be a hint of sweetness.

Nox hid her emotions and said, “In that case, I’ll walk on one foot. You hold on.”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded silently.

Nox hopped on one foot, and his appearance was a little comical. Although he said he wanted Shelly to support him, he did not allow her to. He was afraid that he would really crush her, and if he did, how was he going to press her down in bed in the future?

The two of them finally walked to the dining table. Shelly supported Nox to sit down first before she sat down beside him.

Nox was a little surprised to see two plates on the table. “Haven’t you eaten yet?”

“No, I was waiting for you,” Shelly said naturally. At that moment, she added, “Because Bella is growing and has to eat on time, I served Bella dinner first. She’s asleep now.”

“Actually, you didn’t have to wait for me. It’s so late at night. You should be hungry, ” Nox quickly said.

However, in his heart, he was overjoyed.

“I’m fine,” Shelly said, unwilling to explain further.

She did not want to tell him that it was not just to thank him for everything he did for Bella today. Deep down, she really wanted to have dinner with him. She felt that the two of them had not had dinner together for a long time.

“You can’t just eat meat. You should eat more vegetables too.” Shelly gave Nox some salad and changed the topic.

Nox was a picky eater. He would usually eat fish and meat, but she had never seen him eat vegetables. However, Nox did not refuse Shelly. He may not like to eat vegetables, but he could eat anything that Shelly gave him, including feces..
