1189 Nox’s Mental Breakdown and Finn’s Counseling

Jeanne overheard the conversation between Finn and Alex. Although she could not hear clearly what Alex said, she could roughly guess.

She said, “It’s nothing. I’m sure the baby is strong.”

Finn’s throat moved. “I’ll think of a way to move the examination here.”

“Don’t put yourself in a difficult position.” Jeanne really did not want anyone to get hurt because of her.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

Then, he left.

Jeanne looked at Finn’s back and the men guarding her before turning around and walking into the hall.

She wondered if she would ever be able to walk out of that door again in that life!

…

Edward woke up three days later.

When he woke up, Jeanne was sleeping beside him, quietly and soundly.

His throat moved slightly. He was afraid that he would wake her up. He was even afraid that she would suddenly disappear. Hence, he just look at her, without moving, until she frowned and woke up.

Jeanne felt like someone was looking at her in her sleep, but she could not tell who it was.

Then, she woke up and saw that it was Edward, who had been unconscious for three days. He had finally woken up.

“Are you awake?” she asked him.

Her voice was very soft, and the corners of her mouth were lifted into a smile.

It felt as if he had returned to the past when not much went on politically and it was just the two of them.

At that moment, Edward grabbed the back of Jeanne’s head and kissed her deeply on the lips.

Jeanne was stunned for a second, but she then closed her eyes and kissed him back.

The two of them kissed deeply. It was as if all the love they had for each other during that time had been melted into this kiss and all their hatred for each other had been resolved.

The kiss closed the distance between them. That was until…

“Edward.” Jeanne stopped him from doing anything inappropriate.

Did all men have that kind of instinct? The kiss was pure at first, but later, it was no longer innocent.

Jeanne suddenly stopped Edward because he was so hungry that he did not have any strength left.

After being pushed away by Jeanne, he lay on the bed, so weak that he was panting.

“Weren’t you quite energetic just now?” Jeanne looked at him and could not help but find it funny.

“That’s why I used my last breath to kiss you, but you heartlessly pushed me away. Don’t you feel guilty?” Edward raised his eyebrows. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“...Even at your last breath, flirting comes first.” Jeanne was speechless.

After that, she got up from the bed. “I’ll get Teddy to bring you some food.”

“Thank you, my wife,” Edward said in a low voice.

Jeanne, who was leaving, stopped in her tracks for a moment, and her eyes were a little red.

She had thought that after all that had happened, there were some grudges between them. However, the word “my wife” fully expressed his feelings for her, including her identity.

Nevertheless, Jeanne pursed her lips and walked out of the room.

Edward looked at her back and tried his best to sit up on the bed.

He was given a strong dose of hormones and forced himself to wake up after he was sedated because he would not be at ease until Jeanne really left Harken. Hence, he followed Alex, but in the end, he could not send Jeanne away.

If she did not leave this time, she would never be able to leave, and the only safe place would be by his side.

He picked up his phone and dialed a number. The through went through quickly. “Nox…”

“It’s me, Fourth Master.” Finn’s voice came from the other end.

“Are you with Nox?”

“I’m with him in the hospital,” Finn said bluntly.

“What happened to Nox?” Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“He’s crippled in both legs.”

Edward’s expression changed, and he was speechless.

“He’s still in the middle of a mental breakdown, so don’t provoke him for now.” Finn said bluntly, “I will try my best to counsel him.”

“Alright” Edward replied.

“How are you feeling?” Finn asked.

“I’m fine.”

“Rest more and try not to overexert yourself during this time. Don’t take hormone drugs as nothing.” Finn reminded Edward.

“I know what I’m doing.”

If he knew what he was doing, he would not have forced himself to wake up with a sedative when his body could not take it at all.

Finn did not know how long Edward could last if he treated his body like that.

Finn’s eyes flickered. Then, he turned to look at Nox and said, “Fourth Master, I’m hanging up. Nox is starting to throw a tantrum again.”
