Chapter 110: Another Identity of Jeanne, Exposed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Eden Swan’s eyes moved slightly.

This was the reason why he took the initiative to curry favor with Melody Sanders.

He was a person with ability and ambition. He could not bear to be inferior to his Uncle Edward.

Especially now that his uncle was actually involved with Jeanne, he wanted to climb above his uncle.

He wanted to let Jeanne know clearly that it was useless for her to seduce anyone. In this life, provoking him would be her tragedy.

“Don’t worry, Miss Sanders, I won’t let Jeanne have a good life.”

“I’ll trust you one more time.”

“Okay.”

“Right, does your Uncle Edward have any activities during this period of time?”

“Hmm?”

“Help me find some opportunities to interact with him more,” Melody said bluntly. “I don’t believe that I am inferior to Jeanne in any way, especially when she has been with another man previously.”

“It was my Uncle Edward who did it on purpose. In order to not get married to your family, he deliberately found Jeanne as an excuse. Of course, Jeanne isn’t your match.” Eden had always been good at talking, especially to women.

“That’s why I need to interact with him more. After interacting with him more, he will naturally fall in love with me.” Melody was extremely confident.

“Okay, I’ll think of a way to create opportunities for you guys.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Melody did not say anything more and directly hung up the phone.

Eden held the phone with a ferocious expression.

He was thinking about how to achieve his goal.

He gritted his teeth and picked up the phone to make a call.

The other side rang a few times before it was picked up.

“Uncle Edward.” Eden Swan called Edward. Somehow, Eden naturally felt fearful towards this man.

“What is it?” The other person replied.

“Are you free tonight? I want to have dinner with you alone.”

“What’s the matter?”

“I just took over Swanhaven Bank, so I want to report to you about a job I’ve been working on recently. I also want to have a few drinks with you, Uncle Edward.”

“I’m free tonight.” Edward agreed.

“Then I’ll book a place. I’ll pick you up tonight.”

“There’s no need. Just send me the location in a while.”

“Okay.” Eden sounded really respectful.

“Oh, right.” Edward said, “You applied for a three-year interest-free policy?”

“Yes, I wanted to report it to you, but I didn’t want to disturb you during the weekend. It happened to be within my jurisdiction, so I made the decision first.” Eden quickly explained. At that moment, his palms were sweating. “The Lawrence Enterprise negotiated a contract with MUK Group, and they have some difficulties with funding. It’s only 200 million, so it’s not a big sum. Jasmine’s father came to ask me personally. After all, he is my father-in-law. Since he has already lowered his head, it’s really hard for me to reject him. Just treat it as helping a relative.”

“Is it because of the contract with Muk Group?” Edward asked.

“Yes.”

“Okay,” Edward replied.

“Then...” Eden Swan was a little confused about what his Uncle Edward meant.

“Send me the location of the dinner in a while.”

“Yes.” Eden Swan quickly agreed. “Then, I will not disturb you anymore. Bye.”

Edward hung up the phone.

Eden looked at the “end of call” display and took a deep breath.

Edward was only four years older than Eden. Eden did not know why, but in front of his Uncle Edward, he always felt that he was inferior to him. The feeling of oppression he felt from his uncle was even greater than Eden’s own father.

He gritted his teeth.

One day, he would definitely climb above his Uncle Edward.

…

6 pm.

Jeanne stretched and got off work.

Her entire afternoon was packed, so she felt very tired.

She picked up the phone. “Miles.”

“Yes.”

“I’ll come and pick you up right away.”

“Okay.”

She drove from the Lawrence Enterprise to Miles’s apartment.

The apartment was not far from the Lawrence family compound, and it would take about five minutes to get there by car. It was probably Kingsley Thorn’s deliberate arrangement.

She called George while driving.

“Mom.”

“Miles is here, so we’ll have dinner outside tonight. Wait for me at the door. I will come to pick you up after I pick him up.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and thought for a while before calling Kingsley.

“Miss me?”

“Don’t you have any self-respect?” After all, her reply to that question would always be a no.

“I thought that I’d move you someday.”

Jeanne smiled faintly and said, “Miles has arrived at South Hampton City.”

“Have you met up with him?”

“We’ll meet up soon.”

“Alright. If you have any other requests, let me know.”

“Okay.”

“Jeanne.” Kingsley Thorn appeared very serious.

“Yes?”

“No matter what, your life is the most important thing.”

“I’m very clear about that.” Jeanne smiled. “Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’ve arrived at Miles’s apartment.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and could see Miles standing there from afar.
