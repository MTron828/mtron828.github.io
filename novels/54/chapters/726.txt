Chapter 727: The Family of Three

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is George still angry?” To divert her attention, Jeanne asked him a question.

She just saw Edward go and comfort George.

“I don’t think so...”

“I’m very angry now.” George’s loud voice suddenly came from the living room.

There was no way George heard them, so he was most likely just venting out his frustrations at that moment.

However, Jeanne was stunned. George had never exposed his emotions so openly before, and she could not help but turn her head to look at Edward behind her.

Everything could be dealt with, so did that guy not comfort George?

Edward was also a little embarrassed. He said, “I’m not good at coaxing children.”

“Then what do you know?” Jeanne was very unhappy.

“I know how to...” Edward’s magnetic voice sounded flirtatious. “I know how to coax you.”

Who the f*ck said he could coax her!

Jeanne’s face turned red again.

Edward hugged her in his arms and was in an extremely good mood.

In the huge hall, Edward’s face was full of smiles, Jeanne’s face was blushing, and George’s body was full of resentment…

That was probably their family of three’s happiest moment.

…

Finally, lunch was ready, and Jeanne made a meal with three sides.

In fact, she did not know how to cook an elaborate meal. Hence, in her limited time, she learned to cook some easy and simple dishes.

Jeanne rushed to the hall. “George, come and eat.”

“I’m not eating.”

“If you don’t eat, you won’t grow tall,” Edward answered.

Jeanne glanced at Edward.

No one could ever force something on George.

“Whether I grow tall or not is none of your business,” George grumbled. His small face was filled with unhappiness.

“If you don’t grow tall, you won’t be able to get a wife in the future. If you can’t get a wife, you won’t be able to have children. If you can’t have children, our family line will be cut off,” Edward said. His tone was neither cold nor indifferent but was mixed with some deliberate intent to provoke George. “In Harken, there are three ways to be unfilial, and not having children is one of the worst ways to be unfilial. It means that if you don’t have children, you’ll be unfilial to me and your mother.”

George was so angry that his face was red.

“The point is, if you don’t marry, your mother will be very sad,” Edward said slowly. “For your mother’s sake, I suggest you come and eat.”

George pouted. At that moment, he wanted to fight Edward to death.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was speechless at Edward.

Who would treat their own son like that?

George was fuming now.

She glared at Edward. Sometimes, she felt that the man was rather childish.

Just as Jeanne wanted to go over and coax George, Edward spoke again. “If you don’t eat, I will eat all the food your mother cooked. Then, you won’t be able to it any of it.”

This time, George was provoked.

He walked over in a huff, climbed onto the chair, and sat down. “What gives you the right to eat all the food my mother cooked?”

Jeanne looked at George.

As expected, he was not a match for his father.

“Mom, I want two bowls of rice,” George said angrily.

At that moment, Edward smiled, and Jeanne’s heart ached for her son for a second.

Fortunately, the family of three finally ate quietly at the dining table.

“Eat some carrots,” Jeanne ordered.

There was a portion of steamed carrots in front of them.

Other than Jeanne who had eaten a few pieces, the other two people had not touched it at all.

George pouted as he did not like to eat carrots, whereas Edward pretended not to hear her and picked up some meat.

“I said, eat some carrots.” Jeanne was starting to get annoyed.

How could they eat meat only and not vegetables?

Seeing that Jeanne was getting angry, Edward said to George, “Eat some carrots. They have a lot of vitamins in them, and they’re good for children.”

“I’m talking to you both!” Jeanne added. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Edward pursed his lips.

Jeanne could not be bothered to waste her breath on them anymore. Hence, she placed a piece of the carrot on each one of their plates.

George frowned, and so did Edward.

“Eat it,” Jeanne instructed.

Having always been obedient, George reluctantly picked up the piece of carrot, looking as if he was ready to die. His expression twisted as he ate, but he still ate it in the end.

On the other hand, Jeanne stared at Edward, making him uncomfortable.

He raised his head. “Do I have to eat it?”

“You don’t have to,” Jeanne said.

Edward heaved a sigh of relief.

“I don’t have to be your wife either...”

A certain someone chomped down on it without hesitating for a second.

Jeanne looked at Edward’s expression and could not hold back her laughter.
