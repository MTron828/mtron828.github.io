963 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

Even if they did not capture her, they would have started to hide and fight with their wits!

Her eyes moved slightly as she felt the plane take off.

In six hours, she would be back in South Hampton City!

…

Back in the Delta Islands, in the manor where the party was held, it was around 12 a.m. at night when Kingsley left.

He had obviously drunk too much, but that was the only day in a year when he would let himself go a little.

Millie helped him back to his room.

The moment he lay on the bed, he instructed, “Call Lucy over.”

Millie’s expression was ugly. She thought that Kingsley would forget about it since he was drunk. If he really forgot…

In that case, she would just pretend that she did not know anything and would never ask Lucy to come.

However, at that moment, although her expression was extremely unsightly, she did not dare to disobey Kingsley’s orders. Hence, she could only stand up and get Lucy.

Just as she walked out of Kingsley’s room, she saw Lucy waiting at the door in a sexy red nightdress.

As Lucy watched Millie come out, her eyes flickered.

Millie held it in for a while before saying, “Go in.”

The corners of Lucy’s mouth curled up into a grin that made her look charming and enchanting.

How could that old woman have that kind of style? How did she make herself so feminine?

Millie glared at Lucy’s back.

No. She would never let that woman return to Kingsley’s side. She absolutely could not.

When she returned to her room, she instructed the servant, “Get Cain to come to my room.”

“Okay, Ms. Millie.” The servant was extremely respectful.

After a while, Cain entered.

Cain was currently the Hills’ manager. He was mainly responsible for arranging for the assassins of the Hills to carry out missions, but they were all small missions. The bigger missions required Kingsley’s approval. In the past, Kingsley’s approval was required, but in reality, Lucy was the one in charge. However, now that she had become Kingsley’s subordinate, they had not had any particularly big missions recently, so Millie had not had a good opportunity to replace Lucy.

“Ms. Millie, is there anything I can help you with?” Cain asked respectfully.

In fact, Cain was also an assassin, and he was quite competent. Hence, he had now retired to work behind the scenes.

In the Hills, only Kingsley’s women could have that kind of status and treatment.

She said, “Let me take a look at the assassin’s mission list during this time and mission arrangement recently.”

“Do you have something in mind, Ms. Millie?”

“Mr. Thorn has instructed me to manage the internal affairs of the Hills, so there are many things I need to know. Why? Can’t I know?” Millie raised her eyebrows.

Cain hesitated for a moment.

Previously, when Lucy was in charge of internal affairs, she had never put her nose where it did not belong. She had never asked much about the work he was in charge of.

Nevertheless, he said, “Ms. Millie, please wait a moment.”

Millie nodded.

After Cain left, he quickly returned with a list and handed it to Millie.

Millie looked at it for a long time.

“There’s an assassination the day after tomorrow?” Millie asked as she looked at the list.

“Yes, it’s already been arranged–”

“Let Lucy go,” Miley said bluntly.

Cain was stunned for a moment. “These are all small missions. There’s no need for Ms. Harmon to go personally.”

“I have other plans for Kelly the day after tomorrow.”

“In that case, we can send other assassins–”

“What’s wrong? You don’t dare put Lucy for the mission? If you don’t dare to, I’ll help you.”

“I just don’t think it’s necessary.”

“If I say it’s necessary, it’s necessary.” Millie’s face darkened, and she threw the list in front of Cain. “Lucy will be carrying out an assassination mission the day after tomorrow. I’ll arrange it myself. You don’t need to get involved!

Cain nodded. “Yes.”

In the Hills, Kingsley had always been the one calling the shots, and when Kingsley was not around, his woman had the final say.

It was not that Kingsley had told him that before, but when Lucy was with Kingsley back then, Kingsley had silently allowed her to help him deal with it.

Thus, everyone thought that as long as Kingsley acknowledged a woman, she had the right to interfere in internal affairs.

“You may leave.” Millie waved her hand.

With that, Cain left.

Millie smiled. She refused to believe that she could not kill Lucy!

At that moment, in Kingsley’s room, Kingsley was already asleep when Lucy walked to his bed, and he reeked of alcohol.

She was hesitating whether to wake him up or to help him wash up. In the end, she thought about it for half a minute and chose the latter.

She then went to the bathroom and wrung a hot towel to wipe his face.

When exactly did that handsome face find a way into her heart?

However, she looked away

After all, Jeanne’s reminder was right. She could not fall in love with Kingsley; she could only make use of him.

She was just using his power to give her a better life.

After she was done wiping his face, she took off his suit jacket and shirt, which were a little tight.

Kingsley’s muscles were visible, and each of them was bulging as if cut by a knife.

In fact, apart from Kingsley’s power, his appearance could make women admire him.

Lucy quickly wiped Kingsley’s body clean before taking off his pants and continued to wipe him down.

Suddenly, she smiled.

That was because she suddenly remembered that Jeanne had described Kingsley as ‘still young’. In that case, he should be embarrassed by his current state.

Once she was done, she stood up. Just as she was about to leave, someone suddenly hugged her body.

The movement was smooth, and he pressed her under him.

When it came to sex, she did not know whether Kingsley was naturally gifted or that he was very skilled in bed.

All in all, he was very good at it

She closed her eyes, thinking that things would go on as they usually did between a mature man and woman. However, she felt Kingsley’s kiss suddenly land on her collarbone.

Lucy frowned.

Kingsley really knew how to torture her. As long as it was a wound, he had to touch it.

She gripped the bedsheets tightly as she felt Kingsley’s lips kissing her wound, pressing against it.

The kiss made her sweat profusely as it was an instinctive pain-induced response. Fortunately, Kingsley was not as horrible as to bite down on her wound.

After he kissed her, he suddenly lay on top of her and fell asleep. Lucy could even hear Kingsley’s heavy breathing.

At that moment, she thought about it carefully.

That seemed to be the only time she had not had sex with him in Kingsley’s bed, and it ended because Kingsley was drunk.

However, she did not know if she should push him away or just let him lay on her…

In the end, she chose the latter. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When it came to Kingsley, she did not dare to offend him, so she could only obey him unconditionally.
