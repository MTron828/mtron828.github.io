Chapter 566: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In Lawrence Enterprise’s senior management meeting room, Jeanne sat in the middle of the room while being questioned, accused, and denounced by all the senior managers present.

Nevertheless, Jeanne appeared very calm.

Alexander was originally angry with Jeanne, but at that moment, he had to admit that he sincerely admired Jeanne.

He, too, had also been the target of the senior management before. However, what he did was settle the matter and end the meeting as soon as possible because he did not have the confidence to argue with them. However, the current Jeanne was neither servile nor overbearing. To think she could be so indifferent in the face of so many people’s resistance.

Even when Michelle was scolding her, not only was she not intimidated, but her presence was much more imposing than Michelle’s.

One had to know that Michelle dealt with public relations and customer service, so her words could be unforgiving, and her voice was loud. In any case, no matter who she quarreled with in the company, she had never lost.

Yet, she was subdued by Jeanne, whose authoritative statement stunned Michelle and made her speechless.

Jeanne stood up from her seat and said, “If any of you are dissatisfied with this arrangement or the layoff, you can make a big fuss out of it. But if you do, I wonder who will be humiliated instead? I hope you’ll reconsider after you’ve seen your respective documents.”

As she spoke, Jeanne gave a look to Amy, who hurriedly handed the documents she had prepared in advance to all the senior managers present, one by one.

The senior management was fuming as they took the documents and opened them dramatically. It was obvious that they were displeased with Jeanne.

Winston opened them while saying, “What are these again–”

He was halfway through his sentence when he suddenly stopped.

Upon seeing the documents in front of him, his expression sank, and his forehead started to sweat.

Then, he raised his head to look at Jeanne.

He did not expect the contents of the document to be the material procurement contract he signed a few years ago, for which he took a portion of the commission. The commission was not much, to begin with, so under normal circumstances, no one should be able to discover it. Moreover, the other party had also given him cash. Logically speaking, no traces of it should be left behind. However, Jeanne had discovered it, and his entire face sank.

At the same time, Michelle’s expression also changed drastically as she looked at the document in front of her.

In order to climb to a higher position, she slept with many people in the room. If that indecent photo in the document was exposed, she would be too embarrassed to stay.

She gritted her teeth, feeling angry and humiliated.

One had to know that considering her high position as a director, she had long looked down on those people she had slept with.

At the thought of her scandal being exposed, her expression turned ugly.

However, most of the other senior managers had the same expression.

Everyone present was silent, and no one dared to say anything about Jeanne’s arrangements.

Alexander was stunned by the scene in front of him.

He frowned, having no idea what documents Jeanne had prepared for those senior managers that could make all of them suddenly lose their confidence. They even fell silent and compromised.

What exactly did Jeanne do?

Alexander held it in and did not ask. After all, it was not appropriate for him to speak in that situation. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The moment he opened his mouth, it would seem as though he did not know anything about the arrangements. Not only would it show that he was lowering himself, but it would also show that Jeanne was in charge.

When Jeanne saw that all the senior management had stopped talking, she said calmly, “I believe all the leaders have seen the reason why they’re fired, demoted, or even transferred. I will not make it public here as long as everyone understands why. Of course, if you think it’s unfair, feel like you’ve been wronged, or have a misunderstanding toward us, you can bring it up separately. I will try my best to explain it to everyone.”

Who, at that moment, dared to bring it up?

Did that not mean they were exposing themselves?

The room was pin-drop silent.

Compared to the uproar they were causing earlier, they were awfully quiet now.

Jeanne waited for a few minutes, “If everyone has no objections, I will announce the change in the senior management. Please complete all the handover or resignation procedures within three days.”

“Director Lawrence.” Michelle gritted her teeth and spoke.

“Madam Williams, please speak.” Jeanne still kept a good attitude.

“I agree with Director Lawrence’s evaluation of my work,” Michelle acknowledged.
