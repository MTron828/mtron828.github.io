Chapter 1721: De-escalating Their Relationship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Oh.” Bella was a little unhappy.

“Be good, and we’ll head back after eating. You still have school tomorrow, so you have to sleep early.”

“Alright.” Bella could only nod obediently.

After having hamburgers and fried chicken, Shelly and Bella were ready to leave.

Suddenly, Bella called out to Shelly, “Mommy.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Can we buy more?” Bella asked.

“Aren’t you full? It’s unhealthy to eat so many hamburgers and fried chicken, you’re still a growing child. I will bring you here again next time, okay?” Shelly comforted Bella. “No, I want to bring some back for Uncle Nox.”

Shelly paused.

“Didn’t you ask him if he had dinner just now?” Bella asked.

Bella was so thoughtful that even Shelly felt a little guilty. As she had always lived under someone else’s roof and did not have a father, Bella had always been good at reading people’s expressions since she was young.

She patted Bella’s head. “Uncle might have eaten already.”

“What if he hasn’t?” Bella asked, still determined on getting Nox dinner.

Shelly was helpless. “Alright, we’ll buy some back, but I can’t guarantee that he will eat it. Because even if Uncle hasn’t eaten dinner, he might not eat this kind of food.”

“That won’t happen. As long as you bought it, Uncle Nox would eat it,” Bella said firmly.

Shelly patted Bella’s head and did not take Bella’s words to heart. She went to take away a hamburger and fried chicken before going home with Bella.

When she opened the door, Nox was lying on the sofa, seemingly asleep. From the looks of it, he probably had not eaten dinner yet. In fact, Nox had never taken care of himself.

“Uncle Nox.” The moment Bella entered the living room, she called out to Nox loudly.

Shelly could not stop Bella even if she wanted to. She knew very well how angry Nox was when he woke up. If Bella woke Nox up, Nox might lose his temper again.

However, at that moment, Nox opened his tired eyes in a daze. When he saw

Bella, not only was he not angry, but he even smiled. “You’re back so soon.”

“Yes, we also packed hamburgers and fried chicken for you,” Bella said excitedly. “It’s with Mommy.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bella turned to look at Shelly.

Shelly had no choice but to walk to Nox with the takeout in her hand. “Bella told me to pack just now. Do you want to eat it? If you don’t, I’ll make you dinner.”

Nox simply stared at Shelly, not expecting Shelly to have packed food for him.

“I’ll go make dinner for you,” Shelly said when she saw that Nox did not take it.

“No need. I’ll eat.” Nox took it and explained, “I thought you would rather starve me to death than pack food for me.”

Shelly was speechless. Was she that vicious?

“Mommy won’t starve you to death.” Bella hurriedly said, “On the way back, Mommy said that if you don’t want the food we packed for you, she’ll make you dinner. Mommy won’t starve you to death.”

Nox could not help but laugh. He was truly amused by Bella.

Shelly looked at Nox’s smile and froze for a moment before saying, “If you’re fine with it, eat up. If not, I’ll cook for you after I help Bella with washing up.”

As she spoke, she carried Bella into the room, and Nox watched as they went into the room. He thought, perhaps if he could not woo Shelly in one year, he would let her go and allow Shelly to go back to living her life.

After Shelly bathed Bella and coaxed her to sleep, she walked out of the room to see that Nox had finished the burger and fried chicken, leaving behind an empty takeaway bag.

When she walked over, Nox even burped. He was really full, and even he did not know how he had finished all that. Shelly, too, did not expect Nox to finish it in one go. After all, the hamburger and fried chicken were enough to feed two people.

At that moment, she saw that Nox was slumped on the chair from eating a little too much. Hence, she tidied up the takeout box and poured Nox a glass of water.

“Drink some water.”

Nox glanced at Shelly. “Thank you.”

Shelly nodded and stood up to leave. Her attitude toward him was still lukewarm.

Shelly walked into the kitchen to boil some water. Although there was an electric kettle at home, she was used to boiling a pot of water. It was just a habit..

Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!
