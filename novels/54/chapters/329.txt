Chapter 330: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

She bit her lips lightly and waited.

“As everyone knows, you and my Jeannie got married in a flash. Therefore, we need to test how well you know Jeannie!” Monica said loudly, “I’ll ask you ten questions about her, and you have to answer each question within three seconds. Otherwise, it will be considered a failure!”

“Okay.” Edward agreed.

“Please listen carefully.” In a formal manner, Monica asked, “Please tell me how old Jeannie is this year?”

“25 years old.”

“Please tell me when is Jeannie’s birthday?”

“April 12th.”

“Please tell me Jeannie’s height?”

“I estimate her height to be 1.6 meters,” Edward answered.

Monica was about to speak, but Jeanne’s expression had changed as well.

Did she look that short?

Fourth Master Swan was just a little taller than her. Why did he have to say that she was only 1.6 meters tall?

“Her actual height is 1.66 meters.”

......

Monica paused for a moment. “So the Fourth Master knows how to joke, huh?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jeanne was displeased.

“Continue!” Monica asked again, “Please tell me what Jeannie’s bust, waist, and hip measurements are?”

Edward did not answer, to which Nox could not help but say, “Monica is going all out on this game!”

“34C, 24,36.” The other side answered accurately.

“...F*ck.” Monica cursed softly. She turned her head and asked Jeanne in a low voice, “Is that right?”

Jeanne blushed and nodded.

There was indeed something fishy going on between those two people.

“Hey, why aren’t you talking?” Nox urged.

“Next question.” Monica said aloud, “Please tell me Jeannie’s shoe size?”

“Size 36.”

“Please tell me what Jeannie’s favorite food is?”

“Chicken... parmigiana with pasta.” Edward paused for a moment when he answered. He originally wanted to say chicken soup because when Jeanne was at Monica’s the last time, she seemed to like it very much. However, when the two of them were alone for a week, she said that she wanted to eat chicken parmigiana with pasta.

“May I ask when was the first time you kissed?” Monica suddenly changed the topic.

Everyone seemed to pause for a moment.

There was also no response from the people outside the door.

“You only have three seconds to think. Three, two–”

“Seven years ago, August 21st.”

Monica suddenly looked at Jeanne.

Did she hear wrongly?

Seven years ago! When did Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan cross paths seven years ago?

Jeanne’s eyes sparkled.

That night was the night she climbed into Fourth Master Swan’s bed.

With her face blushed red, she nodded her head.

Monica looked at Jeanne and smiled evilly. “Fourth Master, you and Jeannie have been hiding it really well, huh?”

“Yes,” Edward replied, and he did not forget to remind Monica. “This is also considered a question. I have answered a total of seven questions. Ms. Cardellini, you still have three more questions to go.”

D*mn!

That fellow was too calculative.

Nevertheless, it did not bother Monica, who continued to ask, “What part of the Jeannie do you like the most?”

“Her hand,” Edward said straightforwardly.

“Why?” Monica was a little surprised.

Most men would say their eyes, lips, face, the desire to live, and all that, but her hand…

Monica looked at Jeanne’s fair hand and admitted that Jeanne did have nice hands

However, Fourth Master Swan’s hobbies were too unique.

“It’s because Ms. Lawrence uses her hands to do things I like,” Edward said bluntly.

“Pfft!” Monica almost burst out laughing.

Did she misunderstand him?

Outside the door, Nox almost died from laughing.

Did it mean that…

Monica looked at Jeanne’s tomato-red face.

At that moment, Jeanne unconsciously clenched her hands into a small fist, with the urge to kill Fourth Master Swan right there and then.

It was the first time that Monica found Fourth Master Swan so amiable.

She used to think of him as an elder and a distant one at that.

Yet now, he was just... someone of the same age as her, and he was especially good at saying dirty things!

“She made a meal that I like,” Edward added.

“...” F*ck.

“Ms. Cardellini, let me remind you that you still have one last question,” Edward said bluntly.

She clearly had two more.

F*ck! The “why” just now also counted!

With that, she gritted her teeth. She always felt that she could not outsmart Fourth Master Swan.

Then, she said, “Last question.”

“Please go ahead.”

“When did the Fourth Master start to like Jeanne?” That question was something that she was really curious about.

When did the two of them start to have feelings for each other?

After all, she was still a little surprised that they got married so suddenly.

Everyone was waiting for Edward’s answer with anticipation on their faces.

A few seconds passed, and even Monica had forgotten to count down.
