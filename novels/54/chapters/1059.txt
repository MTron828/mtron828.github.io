1060 Crushing Michael (Confirmed To Be A Sc*mbag)

In Monica’s office in Cardellini Enterprise, Nox’s sudden appearance and the news he brought surprised her.

She had never thought that Nox would suddenly help her.

She thought that Nox hated her and that she was being shameless enough to ask Nox for help occasionally.

At that moment, Nox passed the document to Monica and said, “So, the important thing now is to find the mole. Find him and get evidence of Sunny Pharmaceutical plagiarizing from Cardellini Enterprise. Then, sue Sunny Pharmaceutical and force Sunny Pharmaceutical to stop producing all the drugs and compensate Cardellini Enterprise for all their losses!”

Monica nodded.

Since Nox wanted to help her, she would not refuse.

People were like that; they would become thick-skinned for certain benefits.

“This is the list of everyone on the research and development team.” Nox took a document. “I will check them one by one. See if there’s anything you find suspicious. If there is, point it out for me, and I will check that one first. If not, I will check everyone.”

He did not want to waste too much time, so he wanted Monica to confirm it first.

Of course, Nox did not have much hope that Monica would know anything and was just asking casually.

Nevertheless, Monica carefully checked the list of names that Nox had handed to her.

After coming to Cardellini Enterprise, she had become more familiar with the research and development staff. Thus, she might be able to give Nox some advice.

As she looked at it silently, Nox waited. Even though he did not have much hope, he still gave Monica time.

No one said a word in the office. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After a long time, Monica pulled out a person’s information from the list of names.

She looked at it a few times and went to her computer to pull out that person’s personal information from the human resources department. She confirmed it a few times, hoping that she could give Nox some advice because she really did not want to waste too much of his time and effort.

Although she did not reject his help, it did not mean that she would not be grateful to him.

“Is there a problem?” Nox looked at Monica’s appearance and asked coldly.

Monica nodded. “This man, Rob Witherspoon, is Michael’s distant cousin.”

Nox just looked at her, speechless.

He was not surprised that she had found that person. In fact, he was mocking Monica’s stupidity.

Monica also found it ironic that only now did she remember that such a person existed in Cardellini Enterprise.

At that time, Michael and Reese had put on an act to get that person into their company. Of course, she did not know that they were acting before, but now she knew.

Therefore, Michael already had the idea of taking away their family’s assets at the time, and it was not a conflict that broke out later.

Monica’s indifferent look did not reveal any of the emotions she was feeling.

She had to admit that no one else in Cardellini Enterprise knew Rob Witherspoon’s identity except her father and herself. Since her father was in a coma, she was the only one who knew about that, yet she had completely forgotten about that important part.

Monica did not care about Nox’s gaze. She said, “Focus on investigating him. He didn’t come with good intentions.”

Nox nodded and did not say much. In fact, he already had his own thoughts.

Monica was a little glad that Nox did not say anything because the moment he opened his mouth, he would definitely be looking down on her.

“While I’m investigating the truth, do you have any ideas on how to make Cardellini Enterprise last for a little while longer?” Nox changed the topic and asked her.

“Yes.” Monica nodded and did not hide anything from Nox. “Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation is that all the pharmaceutical companies refuse to buy our drugs. We have a lot of stock, and we have a huge backlog of funds. On top of that, the stock market has been falling, and we can’t get any loans from the bank. The company’s finances don’t look good. We told the public that we can still hold on for two or three months, but in fact, if Michael comes up with some tricks, we might not even be able to hold on for a month.”

Nox nodded.

He originally did not have any hope for Monica. Therefore, when he heard Monica’s analysis of her situation, he could reluctantly accept that Monica had indeed been doing things seriously during her time at Cardellini Enterprise.

“If you didn’t show up, we would only go downhill from here.” Monica chuckled.

Now, her smile was no longer carefree. On the contrary, it was more of a social one.
