1391 Birthday Surprise

“Did Edward love her very much?” Candice could not help but ask.

Just from Teddy’s short comment, she could tell that Teddy approved of Jeanne. After all, anyone who could be evenly matched with Edward was definitely no ordinary person.

Teddy hesitated, but he nodded in the end. “She was Fourth Master’s first love.”

“They seemed to have had George quite early on.” Candice had also learned a little about Edward’s love history.

“When Ms. Lawrence was 18 and Fourth Master was 22. I wasn’t even here yet,” Teddy said.

“Why did they split up?”

“There seemed to have been a lot of misunderstandings.” Teddy was not too sure either. “However, after Ms. Lawrence returned to South Hampton City at the age of 25 and married Fourth Master, their relationship was great.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Candice nodded. She did not need Teddy to tell her what happened after that.

Due to political reasons, Edward and Jeanne had no choice but to separate, and Jeanne died in that political dispute.

“Where’s Susan?” Candice asked.

She asked about Edward’s second wife, Paige’s biological mother.

“Her?” Teddy was stunned and said bluntly, “Fourth Master didn’t love her.”

“I know.” Candice nodded. “But I’m just a little curious. How did Edward and Susan…”

Candice did not continue her sentence. Instead, she just glanced at the innocent Paige in her arms.

Initially, she did not question the idea that Edward and Susan had a child because of political reasons. However, after interacting with him for a long time, she did not think that Edward was such a person.

Edward would not do things that went against his conscience for political reasons, and no matter how she looked at it, she did not think that Page was a product of politics. If she were, Edward would not love Paige so much.

“Oh, no.” Teddy understood what Candice was talking about and quickly denied it. “She’s not Ms. William’s.”

Stunned, Candice looked straight at Teddy.

She was not? In that case…

Teddy suddenly felt like he had said something wrong. However, by the time he realized it, it was too late.

He asked Candice with a trembling voice, “Don’t you know?”

He did not hide anything from Candice or even guard against her because he thought that Candice already knew.

After all, the people closest to Fourth Master knew that Paige was Jeanne’s child. Since Fourth Master and Madam had such a good relationship now, he assumed that Fourth Master had told her.

Now that he realized that he had spilled the beans, he wanted to slam his head against the wall and kill himself. Had he made a big mistake?

“Is she Jeanne’s?” Candice did not answer Teddy’s question. Instead, she asked what she was thinking.

At that point, Teddy did not dare to say anything anymore.

“Didn’t Jeanne die in that fire?” Candice did not need Teddy’s answer to confirm what she suspected.

That was why Edward loved Paige so much.

Paige was the child that Edward and Jeanne had after they got together, so no matter what, it would mean a lot to Edward.

Teddy would rather die than say anything.

“Could it be that Jeanne isn’t dead?!” Candice was shocked.

In fact, she was using words to provoke Teddy so that he would tell her the truth.

When Teddy heard what Candice said, he was indeed shocked. However, he quickly denied, “Jeanne is dead. She died giving birth to…”

Teddy bit his lips. After saying it out loud, he seemed to realize that he had been tricked again.

When he saw Candice looking like she finally understood what had happened, he really wanted to kill himself. He could even imagine how Fourth Master would beat him to death if he found out that he had divulged so much today!

Candice fell silent at that moment.

Therefore, Jeanne’s death was not in that fire. Jeanne’s death was due to childbirth, and that was when she gave birth to Paige.

In other words, there was nothing between Susan and Edward. It was just for show, and his goal should have been to protect Jeanne. After all, at that time, Jeanne’s identity was somewhat illegitimate.

Moreover, Jeanne and Edward were probably enemies. Jeanne was from the Sanders, and Edward was from the Duncans. With such an identity, even if they let go of everything, it was impossible for them to be together without any grudges.

More importantly, the Duncans’ loyal followers would not allow Jeanne’s existence. Hence, Edward could only hide Jeanne.
