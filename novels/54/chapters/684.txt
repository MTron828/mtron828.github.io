“Ah!” the boy shouted, not expecting the other party to be so strong. “Let go of me!”

Finn pushed the boy out forcefully, and the boy fell to the ground.

It shocked everyone in the private room.

They all looked straight at Finn, who did not so much as glance at anyone else and walked away with Sarah.

“Wait.” A boy rushed up to Finn.

Finn’s face darkened.

“She came to drink with us today, and we’re not done drinking yet. How can she leave just like that?” the boy said loudly to Finn.

He looked very imposing as well.

“So, what would you like to do?” Finn moved his body and stretched his bones.

It was obvious that he was warming up for a fight.

The boy was a little scared, but at that moment, he could not back down because he was the leader of those people.

He said, “You can leave if you want, but you have to drink her last glass of wine before you leave!”

That was the most dignity he could save himself.

Finn was once their age, but he did not have the so-called “leader” mentality, nor did he have that much dignity to care about. On the contrary, when Nox was at that age, he would never admit defeat.

“Okay.” So, he gave the “leader” a way out.

The boy quickly took a glass of wine from the coffee table and handed it to Finn. “Bottoms up!”

Finn took it and drank it in one gulp without even thinking.

When Sarah saw Finn’s reaction, her heart raced.

She did not know if scheming against Finn like that was a good idea, but she did not regret it.

She was willing to do many things in order to take things one step further with Finn.

“Is that all?” Finn handed the glass of wine to the boy.

The boy paused. “That’s all. But Sarah, if you can’t have fun next time, don’t come out!”

“I won’t go out with you guys anymore!”

With that, she quickly followed Finn out of the private room.

Finn’s footsteps were a little fast, and Sarah struggled to follow.

The moment Finn walked to his car and opened the driver’s door, he suddenly closed it again.

That was not a glass of beer just now but a glass of white wine, and he gulped it down so fast that alcohol was now kicking in.

Looking at his appearance, Sarah quickly went forward. “Finn, how are you?”

“I’m fine.” Finn waved Sarah away and stopped her from approaching.

Sarah was a little uncomfortable at his rejection as she did not know why Finn would reject her so much.

Nevertheless, she suppressed her unhappiness and said, “I’ll call a taxi.”

Finn did not refuse.

As such, Sarah quickly went to hail a taxi, and the two of them got into the car together.

It was very quiet in the car.

After all, Finn had always been cold to her, but it made her wonder whether Finn was the same when he was with her cousin…

She bit her lip tightly, feeling very nervous right now.

Then, she stole a few glances at Finn.

She had heard that the drug would make people fall asleep for a while.

However, why was Finn still awake? How long would it take for the drug to take effect?

What should she do when she gets home?

She looked at the street outside the window anxiously.

Finn, who was sitting next to her emotionlessly, was actually beginning to experience some changes in his body. He frowned and was a little surprised.

Logically speaking, a glass of white wine should not have made him so dizzy. Even his vision was a little blurry.

He rubbed his temples and closed his eyes for a while as if to steady himself. Little did he know that as soon as he closed his eyes, he would suddenly fall asleep. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After falling asleep, he lost his balance and fell directly onto Sarah’s shoulder.

Sarah felt the weight on her shoulders, and her body suddenly tensed up. When she turned around, she saw Finn’s head leaning against her shoulder with his breathing heavy.

At that moment, she felt like her heart was about to jump out of her chest.

Was he not fine just a moment ago? Why did he suddenly fall asleep? Was the drug taking effect?

She was so nervous that her face began to flush red.

She did not even dare to touch Finn as she was afraid she would wake him up.

Hence, she quickly asked the driver to change the destination and send them straight to a hotel.

Since it was a five-star hotel, waiters were waiting at the entrance to receive her.

Sarah had wanted to help Finn and get a room, but Finn was too heavy.

He did not look fat, but even after all her efforts, she still could not pull Finn down from the car. Did all men grow up eating iron?
