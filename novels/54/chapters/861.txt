862 Jeanne and Monica’s Joint Counterattack

Jeanne asked, “You said just now that you couldn’t win against Michael. What did he do to force you to marry him? ”

Monica became even angrier as she spoke. However, she did not hide anything from Jeanne and told her everything she had been through. She sounded indignation.

“Do you think I’m stupid?” Monica asked Jeanne.

Now that she had replayed her plan to Jeann, Monica felt she was hopelessly stupid.

Jeanne even gave an affirmative reply, “It was very stupid, indeed.”

Monica felt uncomfortable.

Jeanne said, “While it wasn’t the smartest method, and although the outcome wasn’t what you hoped for, it did make Michael uncomfortable. So it wasn’t a complete loss.”

Monica felt that Jeanne was trying her best to find something to comfort her.

“Although, I do have to say that you’ve been going about this wrongly from the start.” Jeanne hit the nail on the head.

Monica held the phone, still a little sulky.

“From the beginning, you were only thinking about how you could torture yourself. You thought it was easier, so you chose the shortcut. Perhaps if it were someone else, someone who was not as shrewd and scheming, you would have achieved your wish. However, Michael isn’t as simple as you think. In the face of your revenge, he definitely wasn’t thinking about how to break up with you but how to force you to let go. This is the difference between you and Michael. You tortured yourself, and he tormented you. That’s why you lost so badly.” Jeanne analyzed thoroughly.

“How can I torture him? He’s in a high position and has great power now.” Monica had no confidence at all.

“You just aren’t cruel enough,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Monica gripped her phone tightly.

“You just dare not to hurt others. That’s why you put everything on the line. Even though you knew that Michael was the cause of everything, you still bore all the consequences! At the end of the day, even if you used this method to divorce Michael, he still wouldn’t be affected in any way. In fact, you left him a bright path,” Jeanne said, feeling helpless toward Monica.

Though, it was understandable. As Monica had never been hurt since she was young, it would not be the way she would retaliate first.

Silly Monica. It is that simple.

While Jeanne really did not want her to lose her innocence, this was the reality. Monica must learn to grow up.

When society began to test her, she could only accept the cruelty of reality.

“Monica, are you willing to marry Michael?” Jeanne suddenly asked her in a serious tone.

“No!” Monica said firmly and without hesitation.

At the thought of living under the same roof as Michael, sleeping with Michael, she was honestly afraid that she would suffocate to death.

“Then, listen to me. Do not give Fu Kang any leeway,” Jeanne said word by word.

“There’s no way I can win against him!”

“You can.” Jeanne was very certain.

Monica was still not confident.

“I think it’s the easiest thing to do in this world reject a marriage,” Jeanne said.

Monica had obviously been dealt a huge blow and had already started digging her own grave.

Jeanne could actually say that it was the easiest, but the distance between them was probably a galaxy away.

Jeanne said, ‘First, a peaceful breakup. Second, a one-sided breakup. It’s obvious you failed both ways.”

“Yeah.”

“Therefore, we only have the third option, force the other party to break up. In fact, you have thought of it and even done it. You just didn’t do it perfectly,” Jeanne said tactfully.

However, Monica knew. Her plan had not been flawed but completely useless.

“What you need to do now is not to make Michael undesire you. None of us know the bottom line of a person. You don’t know Michael’s bottom line, either. If he dared expose your private photos, then he shouldn’t have any bottom line,” Jeanne said sarcastically. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Monica gritted her teeth. Michael was indeed crueler than she thought.

“So, you should push Michael out of your league.”

“...” Was Jeanne joking?

Though she did not say it out loud. She was afraid Jeanne would scold her if she did.

She heard Jeanne say, “The way to make Michael fall short of you is not by showing how outstanding you are, but how much of a scumbag he is.”
