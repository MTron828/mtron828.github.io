Chapter 427: Monica Confesses Her Love

“As expected, it tastes amazing.” The smile on Monica’s face was beaming.

He looked at Monica’s lips and the color of her lips…

“Are you reminiscing too?” Monica also noticed his gaze.

Finn quickly looked away and made himself appear cold. “I’m not like you.”

“Not like me what?” Monica looked at Finn.

“So... perverted.”

Monica rolled her eyes.

She had no choice but to expose that certain someone.

Finn looked at her.

“Don’t think I can’t feel it,” Monica insisted.

“I’m afraid there’s something wrong with your senses!” Finn refused to admit it.

Finn’s eyes looked away. It was obvious that he did not dare to look directly at Monica. He said, “It’s instinctual.”

Monica could not help but laugh. “So, all men... are instinctive!”

......

Finn frowned, feeling that Monica was implying something.

He lowered his head. As the hospital gown was very soft, many of his movements were very obvious.

At that, Finn got a little embarrassed.

“Men are indeed the most unreserved,” Monica concluded.

When did Monica become so sharp-tongued?

“Open up...” Monica did not want to expose Finn all the time. She was also afraid that if she exposed him too much, with Finn’s bad temper, he would kick her out of his ward. Hence, she scooped another spoonful of soup and put it next to Finn’s mouth.

Finn could not even look at the soup in Monica’s hand. Now, he felt that the nutritious soup was tainted with the taste of lust.

“Aren’t you going to eat it?” Monica asked.

Finn did not open his mouth.

“No.” Monica was very determined. “You have to eat it all.”

Finn looked at her.

“If I don’t make you fat and healthy, how are we going to have a child?”

“...”

“Open up.” Monica tried to bait him again.

In the end, Finn ate it.

Monica continued to feed Finn mouthful by mouthful. As she fed him, she asked, “Finn, do you want to have children?”

Monica’s mind was everywhere, and it was hard for ordinary people to keep up.

“I want to have two children,” Monica said to herself.

“Oh,” Finn replied.

“A boy and a girl.”

Finn’s eyes seemed to move. He looked at Monica with a serious expression.

“Do you like boys or girls?” Monica asked him.

“I like both,” Finn replied.

“So you’ve been wanting to have a child with me for a long time, haven’t you?” Monica smiled cunningly.

Finn’s face darkened.

Monica just loved to plot against him verbally, did she not?

“Finn, do you like me?” Monica asked.

At her sudden question, Finn’s heart skipped a beat.

The word ‘like’...

For a long time, he thought that liking her had become a luxury.

Ever since they got together, he had been worried about losing Monica. Not to mention, she really abandoned him later.

Finn kept silent for a long time until Monica said to herself, “I like you.”

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

Her fingers seemed to clench unconsciously.

“I don’t know why, but I’ve liked you for many years,” Monica muttered.

“Don’t you like Michael instead?” Finn’s voice did not sound too emotional.

“Do you think I like him?” Monica looked at him.

“Didn’t you say you were happier with him?”

“That’s because you never reciprocated my feelings,” Monica said.

She thought, no matter what feelings Finn had for her now, she could tell that Finn still liked her. Regardless of whether he admitted it or not, she had to tell him how she felt.

Since she was certain she would be with him in the future, she did not want to hide it anymore.

Anyway…

In her relationship with Finn, she was the one who took the initiative from the very beginning; she was the one who pursued Finn.

However, she was also used to it, and she would give as much as she could. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She said, “That year, I was really sad when I bumped into you and Patsy, so I went to the bar to get drunk. After that, I met Michael, and he stayed with me for the whole night.”

Finn’s body tensed up a little.

“That night, I really felt that living was worse than death. I had never been so sad in my entire life, and there was really a moment when I wanted to die.” Monica could still remember how terrible she felt at that time.

Just like now, even thinking about the ambiguous relationship between Finn and Patsy made her feel terrible.
