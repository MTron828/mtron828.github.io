981 Finn Is Not Good Enough For Monica

Upon hearing Monica’s words, Sarah was so embarrassed that she wanted to dig a hole in the ground and hide in it.

She did not even know what to say to her cousin.

What should she say in front of Finn?

Monica also knew that Sarah would be shy. No matter what, a woman would still be a little nervous about her first time. She had experienced it before, so she could understand. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Monica continued, “Your uncle will undergo surgery in the morning the day after tomorrow, and Finn will be accompanying the specialist doctor. Although the specialist doctor is excellent, I don’t know why I still trust Finn more. It’s probably because he’s always been my dad’s attending doctor, but that is why I hope Finn can be in his best condition. In case of an accident, Finn can rescue my dad in time.”

“I ... I might not be able to seduce Finn.” Sarah blushed and decided to voice her thoughts.

“Finn has needs now, so just tell him that you’re willing to sleep with him. How else do you need to seduce him?” Monica said bluntly.

Sarah kept looking at Finn, who remained indifferent after hearing what Monica said.

“But…” Monica suddenly thought of something, and her expression became very serious. “You can’t overdo it.”

“Huh?”

“Once or twice is enough. You can’t overdo it. It’s not good for your body, understand? There must be a limit to everything, and too much of something is not good. You mustn’t do it with Finn too many times,” Monica reminded.

It could not be like what had happened to Finn and her the last time when they did it many, many times.

“I’ll try,” Sarah said with a trembling voice.

“Tonight would be the best. It’ll be a little late tomorrow night.” Monica reminded her, “Remember to let me know when you’re done.”

“Yes.” Sarah blushed and nodded.

With that, Monica hung up the phone and took a deep breath.

She felt like she had just handed over a plushie that she had treasured for many years.

However, handing it over was good for her too. At the very least, she would not have feelings for him anymore.

…

In the hospital, in Finn’s office, Sarah hung up the phone and was not in the mood to do her homework anymore.

She blushed as she looked at Finn, wanting to see his reaction. Even if it was just a look, she would be able to act according to the situation.

She bit her lip.

The office was extremely quiet.

However, the moment Sarah could not wait any longer, Finn suddenly asked, “Are you not going to do your homework?”

Sarah’s heart skipped a beat.

Then, she quickly closed her homework and mustered up her courage to say, “I won’t do it tonight.”

“In that case, you should head back early,” Finn said straightforwardly.

Even so, Sarah did not leave. She just stared straight at Finn.

Seeing that, Finn’s expression clearly changed slightly.

“I’m sure you heard what my cousin said just now,” Sarah said.

She decided… not to pretend anymore.

She just wanted to sleep with Finn, and any reason would do as long as they could have sex.

Finn’s eyes flickered.

“My cousin told me to help you relax so that you can be in your best condition for my uncle’s surgery.”

“I’m a doctor. I know better than any of you what’s best for me!” Finn’s tone was a little cold.

She did not sense his anger just now, so she thought that he did not care about what her cousin had said and that they had really let go of each other.

“But this morning, you–”

“That’s my business!” Finn’s face was dark.

As Sarah bit her lip, her eyes reddened.

“I’ll repeat it. I’m a doctor, and I know my body’s condition better than anyone else. I don’t need you to remind me, and you don’t have the right to! Also, we’re only pretending to be a couple. Even if I have needs, you won’t be the one to satisfy them!”

“If not me, who else? Do you plan to look for my cousin?” Sarah’s tears fell. “My cousin has told me to sleep with you, yet you’re still keeping your chastity for her!”

“She has nothing to do with it! I just don’t want anyone to suffer.”

“Does it pain you to sleep with me?” Sarah’s tears streamed down her face.

How could Finn be so cold?

How could Finn be so evil?

Back then, how on earth did her cousin manage to woo Finn? How did her cousin bear with Finn and finally move him?

That man was like an ice mountain that could not melt no matter what.
