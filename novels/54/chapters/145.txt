Chapter 146: Jeanne Might Not Be an Ordinary Person

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne invited the world-class transportation master, Klaus Maine. The news of Maine’s arrival in South Hampton City spread throughout the country in an instant.

There were many onlookers.

“Is it really the legendary Klaus? The master who can unimpeded traffic no matter how complicated the traffic environment is under his design?”

“Klaus only spent a week solving a traffic problem that had caused congestion in Maccens for ten years. Now that so many years have passed in that city, even the rush hour is extremely smooth. It’s said that those streets are even named ‘Klaus Route 1’and ‘Klaus Route 2’...”

“Didn’t Klaus retire many years ago?”

“Who is Klaus... everyone is very confused.”

“Looking forward to Klaus’ arrival, looking forward to the final resolution...”

…

The news of the transportation master was in full swing.

Jeanne’s office.

Jeanne was also flipping through the news.

Her expression was very calm.

Forrest really did not dare to believe it. After he helped Jeanne record the video, he actually had a lot of questions. At this moment, he finally could not hold it in anymore. “Director Lawrence, you are not joking, right?”

Jeanne looked up from the screen. “You mean the matter of inviting Klaus?”

“Yes.” Forrest nodded and voiced his doubts, “Actually, I’m quite interested in world-class celebrities, especially those with technical influence. I have some understanding of Klaus. He had already announced three years ago that he would no longer accept invitations to design transportation plans. Moreover, many important leaders of many countries had personally gone to invite him, but he refused them all. I don’t know how you got him to come out of his retirement.”

“It’s not me,” Jeanne said. “I don’t have such great abilities.”

“Then who is it? Is it your friend? Who could be this influential?” Forrest was very curious.

He suddenly felt that the woman in front of him was unfathomable.

She seemed to... always make people feel extremely shocked.

“It’s my son,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“...” Forrest felt that this was even harder to accept than the Director herself being acquainted with Klaus.

Jeanne was really calm to the point that it drove people crazy. She casually said, “Klaus is one of the people in charge of the Mensa organization. My son’s IQ just happened to be online. When he entered Mensa, Klaus accidentally discovered my son and felt that he was amazing. Thinking that he was a talent that could be trained for, he made George his apprentice. In layman’s terms, Klaus is my son’s master. Now that his disciple’s mother is in trouble, he can’t just stand by and do nothing. So, I asked George to tell Klaus about my request, and Klaus agreed.”

“...” Forrest was speechless.

Could you not say it so casually? It would make people jealous.

“Director Lawrence, you… you… You’re just not an ordinary person.” Forrest was even stuttering.

The father of e-commerce, West from the MUK Group, was her godfather.

The world-class transportation master, Klaus, was her son’s master.

No ordinary person would not be able to befriend these big shots.

Unless she was a big shot herself.

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “Everything is a coincidence or fate. I’m not as powerful as you think, just a little lucky.”

There was probably no one in this world who could rely on luck to become a king.

Forrest had a feeling that Jeanne would definitely be more successful in the future!

“Let’s not talk too much. Tell Mandy to keep an eye on the news. We can’t let the news go cold like this. The internet trolls we hired have to keep building momentum.” Jeanne returned to the main topic, and she looked at the time again. “It’s 8 pm now. The matter is about to come to an end. Tomorrow morning, I will go to the airport to pick Klaus up. I will be a little late. When the time comes, you will be in charge of the project. If you encounter any problems, call me immediately.”

“Don’t worry, Director Lawrence.” Forrest agreed immediately.

Jeanne nodded. She picked up her bag and stood up to leave the office. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Forrest followed her out and looked at her silhouette.

These few days, she had clearly experienced some high-intensity and high-pressure work. He did not know why this woman in front of him could still remain calm. It was as if everything was within her expectations, and she only needed to wait for a good result.

He truly admired her so much.

Wondering if those who tried to put her down were fuming right now.
