Chapter 1440: George Came Home Injured

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“So you don’t care if his life is not in danger?”

“…George can take it.”

‘Damn it.’ Monica really wanted to kill Finn at that moment.

In the end, Finn arrived at Bamboo Garden at the slowest speed possible. When he walked into the hall, Edward was also there.

“How is he?” Finn asked nervously when he saw Edward.

Monica looked at Finn’s current appearance and really wanted to expose that b*stard!

“Let’s go up and take a look,” Edward said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Then, he went upstairs with Finn. Monica also followed.

“Come up later,” Finn instructed.

After that, he went upstairs with Edward without waiting for Monica to agree.

Monica was filled with anger. Why should she listen to him?

At that moment, Candice walked to Monica’s side and said, “Don’t worry, George should be fine.”

Monica was still worried.

“Come over and take a seat first.” Candice dragged Monica along naturally.

Monica could never refuse Candice, so the two of them sat on the sofa.

Candice looked a little down, and it was not an act. It was really because George was injured that she felt a little heartbroken.

“Monica, do you know why George left South Hampton City for a period of time and went to a so-called base? What is that place?” Candice asked her.

“I’m not too sure either.” Monica did not lie to Candice.

There were many things that she did not know about Edward, Nox, and Finn.

All she knew was, “Edward, Nox, and Finn are different from ordinary people. They must have been trained like this, and everything George is going through now must be what the three of them have gone through before.”

“Why must it be like this?” Candice asked.

Monica thought for a moment before saying, “It’s probably because the greater the responsibility, the more capable one has to be.”

After all, George was the Leader’s future heir. Since he was young, he was naturally educated differently from ordinary people.

Candice pursed her lips. It was not that she did not accept that logic, but she just felt uncomfortable with that idea because of George’s injury.

“Ugh.” Monica suddenly retched.

Candice looked at her. Monica covered her mouth “I’m going to the washroom.”

Then, she left in a hurry.

Candice looked at Monica’s back. She was almost certain that Monica was pregnant.

Monica and Finn had broken up for more than a month, so that child… should be Finn’s. Moreover, Monica was not the kind of person who would sleep with other men after breaking up with Finn.

Having figured that out, Candice stood up and waited for a while at the bathroom door.

The moment Monica opened the door and saw Candice’s meaningful gaze, she admitted, “Yes, I’m pregnant, and they’re twins. Damn it.”

“Twins?” Candice got a little excited. “This is something to be happy about.”

“Not really.” Monica retorted, “Would you be happy if you get pregnant with your ex-boyfriend’s child?”

“I don’t have an ex-boyfriend.”

Monica was speechless.

“You can also make your ex-boyfriend your current boyfriend or even your current husband.”

“Stop joking around.” Monica denied that idea. “It’s impossible between Finn and me.”

“Although I don’t advocate that two people be together because of the children, I think that two people who love each other shouldn’t miss the opportunity to be with each other, ” Candice advised.

“Who said we’re in love?” Monica retorted, “I’ve long given up on Finn.” “Do you know that every fire starts with a tiny spark?”

“Where is this spark coming from? I only have a bucket of cold water.” “No.” Candice pointed at Monica’s stomach. “This is the spark.”

“I won’t compromise for the sake of the children,” Monica said with determination. “If it weren’t because I was afraid of killing two lives — if I wasn’t pregnant with two children at once, I might not want them anymore.”

Candice refused to believe that Monica would not want a child. Once the child was involved, it was impossible for the two of them to not be in each other’s lives.

Monica could read the expression on Candice’s face, and it made her a little unhappy. “Can you stop acting like you know me very well?! We’re not friends.” Candice was speechless.

“To tell you the truth, I don’t even like you. In my opinion, you’ve snatched Jeanne’s position.”

“I know.” Candice did not seem to care. “I thought we weren’t friends at first, but for some reason, the moment I saw you, I felt a sense of familiarity. I thought we could be friends..”
