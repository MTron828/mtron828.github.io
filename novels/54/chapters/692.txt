Chapter 693: Letting Go: Sorry I Made You Feel Disgusted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I said, Monica and Finn are sleeping together now,” Lizzy repeated, still in shock.

“Are you sure?”

“I’m sure. When they were in the bathroom, they... We were too embarrassed to look, so we came out.”

“F*ck!” The other party suddenly cursed.

Then, he hung up the phone abruptly.

After hanging up the phone, his hands were trembling.

He had planned for Sarah and Finn to have sex, but how did it turn out to be Monica? How was he going to explain that to Mr. Ross?

If Mr. Ross found out that Monica and Finn had slept together, he was afraid Mr. Ross would kill him.

The man’s face was extremely ugly as he gripped his phone tightly, his hands trembling.

In the end, he mustered up his courage and said, “Mr. Ross.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“How was it?” The person on the other end of the phone had not slept either, as if he was waiting for the final result.

“Everything was going well, but I didn’t expect–”

“Was?” The other person’s face darkened.

Nervous, the man said, “Monica suddenly appeared, and then–”

“What did you say?” The other person’s voice was higher, and it was obvious that he was angry.

The man was trembling with fear. “Now, Monica is sleeping with Finn!”

“Trash!” Michael was furious.

The man even heard a crash as if something was smashed to the ground.

“I don’t know how things turned out like this either. Everything was going according to our plan. I never expected Monica to suddenly appear!” The man was also very surprised, but he knew that it was useless to explain anything, “I’m sorry, Mr. Ross. It’s my fault. I’m willing to accept any punishment.”

However, Michael immediately hung up the phone and threw the phone to the ground.

His expression was ferocious.

He had smashed his phone and the table lamp, but that did not seem to have vented his anger. He even kicked the coffee table in front of him.

A violent sound rang out in the room.

He really did not expect that after calculating everything, his last kick would be interrupted!

Never could he have imagined that after all that careful planning, everything would be messed up at the very last minute!

Who the hell messed up?!

He held himself together, but at that moment, he wished he could kill someone!

At the thought of Monica and Finn together…

“Clang!” Michael punched the overturned coffee table and smashed his fist into the broken glass to relieve the pain he was suppressing!

He could only suppress it instead of going to the hotel to stop it because if he did go to the hotel, he would be exposed!

Therefore, he could only endure it. He had to endure it and accept that Monica and Finn really slept with each other!

A cruel glint flashed across his bloodshot eyes.

One day, he would make them pay a hundred times over for the suffering he went through today!

…

The night sky was filled with darkness, and under different night skies, there were always different things happening.

In a five-star hotel, the sky was slightly bright, and dawn had begun to break. With the entire city still in a deep sleep, everything was quiet.

On a soft white bed, two people were tightly pressed together.

Monica endured the pain in her body until finally, Finn was exhausted.

She thought she was probably the most miserable woman in the world. It was her first time being in such a baffling yet painful experience.

It was only just that it finally ended when Finn was still on top of her.

Then, Finn fell into a deep sleep, with his body buried in hers.

In fact, she was also exhausted. She was physically and mentally exhausted, but she could not fall asleep.

No matter whether she closed her eyes or opened them, her mind was filled with images of her and Finn. She could not get them out of her mind.

She was thinking about how Finn would react after he woke up. Would he... be slightly moved?

Would he feel the same as her? Even if her body was in extreme pain, sweetness filled her heart.

Every time the thought that they had really slept together crossed her mind, her face and ears would flush red, and her heart would beat faster.

She had been wanting to sleep with Finn since the first time she saw him. Having waited for so many years, although the process was not pleasant, she was very satisfied with the result.

She was very happy that she had satisfied all of Finn’s desires.

She let him fall into a deep sleep on her body while she hugged him tightly with both her hands.

From the bottom of her heart, she looked forward to getting back together with Finn again.

As the sky was getting brighter, the sun shone through the window and on the curtains of the hotel’s floor-to-ceiling windows.

The scattered light enveloped the room.

It was… a good day, like her mood.

Monica did not sleep the entire night.

She kept her eyes open and looked at the clear sky outside the window.
