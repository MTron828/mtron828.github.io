Chapter 1609: Nox Fainted At The Scene

Monica paused for a second and asked, “In Bamboo Garden?”

Finn nodded, causing Monica to be a little embarrassed.

“You said, if I were a little better in bed, you wouldn’t have broken up with me,” Finn said.

Monica’s words back then had hurt him a lot, and there was no way he could conceal it.

“I was just saying.” Monica suddenly smiled.

She did not expect Finn to hear what she said and understand what she meant. In that case, there was no need for her to hint at him later.

“I was just listening,” Finn replied nonchalantly, trying to make himself feel less embarrassed!

“How could you?” Monica was a little excited.

Finn pursed his lips. Could Monica not give him a way out?

“You have to improve, do you understand? As a married couple, we need a little bit of fun! Pleasure has to be given both ways. You can’t be so selfish!” Monica complained.

Finn was extremely embarrassed. If nothing were discussed today, he would just do his homework quietly. However, now that it was out in the open, his ego was bruised, and most importantly, Monica was pressuring him to ‘improve’.

“Forget it.” Seeing that Finn’s face was red, Monica sighed. “Anyway, it’s useless to talk about this while I’m pregnant. Let’s talk about it after I unload the goods.”

Finn was speechless. He wondered, just how many men had she slept with to have such a rich experience?

He was not angry at first, and he also told himself that he would not fuss over it. After all, only their feelings for each other mattered the most. Yet, at that moment, he was still brooding over Monica’s words.

In the quiet car, Monica was in a good mood. It was a stark contrast to Finn’s dark expression.

“Let me tell you something,” Monica said, her voice filled with joy.

“I don’t want to know,” Finn said.

He did not want to know how much better other men were when she was with them.

“Are you sure you don’t want to know?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

Finn refused to give in.

“If you really don’t want to know, I won’t say anything.”

Seeing Finn remain silent, Monica believed that she would be angered to death by Finn one day. Anywvay, if the two of them quarreled, Finn could definitely not speak all day, but she could not take it.

“I insist on saying it.” Monica’s tone was firm.

She had a look that said she would do whatever she was not allowed to do.

Finn’s grip on the steering wheel tightened.

“Between me and many other men…’

“Monica, do you think you can do whatever you want just because I like you?” Finn suddenly shouted at her angrily.

Monica stared at Finn with wide eyes.

“Damn it, I have a temper too. If you continue talking about you and other men, believe it or not, but I…” At that moment, Finn was so angry that he could not even speak.

“You what?”

“I’ll jump off a building, and your children will be born without a father! ”

She thought he was going to beat her to death.

“Damn it.” Finn suddenly cursed again.

After so many years, it was really rare to hear those words coming out of Finn’s mouth.

Then, he suddenly pulled the car to the side. He looked extremely angry, but he was very gentle when he parked the car. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After making sure that it was safe, he unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the door of the backseat, and sat in.

Monica looked at Finn in shock. Was that guy not going to jump off a building? Was he going to strangle her now?

She said, “Didn’t you say you didn’t mind? You clearly mind very much now…”

“Even if I don’t mind, you should stop testing my limits! You keep going on and on about it… I’m a f*cking man too, you Imow?” Finn was so angry that he was about to explode.

He finally knew why Nox fainted at the scene because he, too, was about to faint from anger.

At that moment, he hugged Monica, placed his cheek close to hers, and kissed her hard on the lips.

‘Let’s see how you think about other men now!’ he thought.

Finn’s kiss was a little rough, but it did not seem to hurt her at all. In fact, it seemed to be directed at himself, like it was some sort of self-destruction.

They kissed for a long time, and Finn looked much calmer. He let go of Monica and said seriously to her, “Monica, don’t hate me. I’ll change.”

What he meant was he hoped she would not mind his poor performance in bed and that he would change for the better..
