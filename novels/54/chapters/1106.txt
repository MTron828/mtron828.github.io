1107 You Can Have Any Identity But Not The Daughter of the Sanders

If Michael had not failed completely, the Sanders might have given him a little more time.

It was precisely because he had failed that all their schemes failed, and the Sanders started to lose their patience.

The Sanders also knew that the descendant of the Duncans was powerful enough to threaten their interests, and that power was led by the Swans.

The Swans were now in control of the Harken’s economy. Even after the Sanders had done so many shady things in the dark to destabilize the Swans’ economic status, it was to no avail. In fact, it made them look like clowns, so they could only choose to take the risk.

The best way was to make use of Jeanne’s relationship with Edward.

Once her identity as the daughter of the Sanders was revealed to the public, Edward and she would become complete enemies. In other words, Edward had to kill her.

The Duncans would never allow Edward to marry the daughter of the Sanders or even have any feelings for her because that would threaten the trust that the Duncans had in the Swans.

Everyone was afraid of switching sides.

After all, the fall of an empire was always because of the rebellion of their subjects.

Jeanne was well aware of the Sanders’ wishful thinking, and Edward was too. In fact, even the Duncans might be aware of that.

Everyone was aware of it, but they would just change their plans according to that.

No one was willing to take risks or gamble with their emotions to assume who was loyal to whom.

The room suddenly became silent again.

Since Jeanne did not say anything, Edward did not say anything either. The two of them just sat on the sofa without saying a word.

No one knew what would happen the moment they left the Sanders’ residence.

“I’ve thought about your identity,” Edward said.

In the room where the two of them were together, Edward spoke after a long time.

“But I never thought that you were Warren’s daughter.” Edward enunciated each word.

She could have any identity, but she could not be Warren’s daughter. Due to that identity, it would be impossible for them to be together in the future.

In the quiet room, someone’s phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne lowered her head and looked at the small bag she had brought along. Then, she opened it and took out her phone.

The name “Monica” was displayed on the phone screen.

She pressed the button.

By then, Edward had walked out to the balcony. He was smoking outside, taking in drags of smoke, and she could not tell his emotions.

“I thought I wouldn’t be able to get through,” Monica said, her voice calm.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly. “Yes, I’m back in South Hampton City.”

“I know. I saw the news.”

‘News?’

Come to think of it, the Sanders had announced her identity to all the officials at the banquet, so it was understandable for her identity to be announced to the entire country.

It was supposed to be Stacey’s wedding, yet she had stolen all the limelight.

If it were anyone else, they would probably go crazy!

However, it was precisely because Stacey was part of the Sanders that she could not even express her emotions.

“So, your surname is Sanders,” Monica said faintly.

She did not seem to know how to express her emotions. When she saw the news, she actually thought that she had seen it wrongly.

The news said, “The Sanders’ lost princess, Jeanne Sanders, has finally returned home!”

At that time, she found the name Jeanne Sanders strange.

Why did the princess have such a similar name to Jeanne?

However, only when she opened it and saw Jeanne’s photo did she truly believe that the so-called Jeanne Sanders was her best friend, Jeanne, who had grown up with her.

It was the woman she had thought was extraordinary since she was young was really extraordinary.

She did not know how to express her feelings. It was probably the first time she had felt emotional after such a long time. That was why she desperately wanted to give Jeanne a call.

It had been a long time since she had been so eager to do something.

In fact, she did not expect the call to go through. She just wanted to vent her emotions, but unexpectedly, Jeanne answered her call.

After the call connected, the two of them did not speak much.

In the past, she would babble non-stop, but now, she really did not know what to say. She could not figure out what their relationship was.

Was she considered an enemy?

After all, the Sanders had always wanted to bring down Cardellini Enterprise, and Jeanne had become their daughter.

“Monica,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Monica gripped her phone tightly.

“I’ve known about this for a long time.” She was saying that she had known for a long time that she was the daughter of the Sanders.

“Why did you hide it from me?” Monica asked her.

In fact, what she was most concerned about was how Jeanne was doing or what Jeanne was going through right now.

It really did not matter whether they were enemies or not.

“I didn’t want to drag you into any trouble,” Jeanne replied.

“Am I that untrustworthy of your trust?”

...

“No,” Jeanne said, “but I hope that you can live a better life.”

“Jeanne, am I really that weak to you?”

“I’ll feel bad if you get hurt.”

“Me too. I’ll also feel bad because you hid it from me!” Monica was a little agitated and sounded a little riled up.

“But if you can live a good life, I’d rather you blame me.”

“Jeannie–”

“Monica. The only thing I can do is protect Cardellini Pharmaceutical. As for the rest, I can’t make any promises, nor can I agree to let you get involved in my affairs. I don’t want you to take on any innocent sacrifices. The only people important to me in this world are Kingsley, George, and you! You better live well!”

Monica’s eyes were red. She could hear the determination in Jeanne’s voice that Jeanne would not tell her anything.

The two of them held their phones tightly and did not speak for a long time.

“Jeannie.” Monica regained her calm and forced herself to calm down.

Jeanne was a little surprised that Monica could control her emotions so well.

...

As expected, Monica had grown up. In fact, it could be said that she had grown up in the cruelest conditions.

“Don’t die, okay?” Monica suddenly begged.

When she was powerless and did not have the ability to help Jeanne, she only had one request, and that was for Jeanne to be alive.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
