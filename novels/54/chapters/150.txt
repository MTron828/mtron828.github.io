In the spacious living room.

Monica was frozen as she held her phone.

Finn was expressionless. He walked past her coldly and went to the medicine box in the corner of the living room to look for medicine.

“Monica.” Micheal’s voice called out to her once more. He seemed to have called her a few times.

Monica came back to her senses. “I’m here.”

“What’s wrong?”

“Nothing.” Monica said, “It’s getting late. You should get off work early. Don’t delay your dinner, it’s easy for you to get stomach problems.”

“Okay.”

“Then I’ll hang up.”

“Bye-bye.”

“Bye-bye.”

Monica hung up the phone.

At that moment, Finn walked toward her with a pill in his hand.

As she was standing in front of the kitchen island with the water heater beside her, Finn picked up his special cup and took the warm water.

Monica looked at his cold expression and frowned. “Are you unwell?”

Finn took the medicine but did not answer.

“Aren’t you a doctor? How can you get sick?” Monica frowned.

After Finn took the medicine, he turned around and went to the sink to rinse his own cup. He replied indifferently, “A doctor is not a God.”

Monica was speechless.

Finn ignored her most of the time, but one sentence from him could easily kill her.

She was a little unhappy and turned around to return to her room.

Out of sight, out of mind.

She simply did not want to be in the same space as Finn and breathe the same air.

She had just taken two steps when she suddenly thought of something. “Finn, I’m not unwell.”

Finn put the water cup away.

“I said I don’t have cancer. Don’t curse me.”

Finn raised his head and looked at Monica.

Monica said loudly, “I went to the hospital for an examination today. The Doctor who performed the ultrasound on me examined me very carefully. The result was ordinary hyperplasia of the mammary glands.”

“Okay,” Finn replied.

“Forget it. You don’t care anyway,” Monica mumbled and then felt that it was meaningless for her to tell him anything at all.

She turned around and went back to her room.

Finn looked in the direction of Monica’s room door.

He held his stomach.

It was just a little stomach ache.

Actually, Monica’s reminder was right. As a doctor, he would not get sick so easily unless it was due to genetic reasons. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The next day.

Jeanne habitually opened the news and took a few glances.

Yesterday’s news was still trending, and it was still very eye-catching on the news app.

No media outlet had dared to broadcast their news before.

Ever since the administrative office had responded positively, all the major media outlets were now in a frenzy, and they were afraid that they would be a minute late.

She put down her phone.

She came out of the bathroom to wash up.

George was still sleeping on the bed.

Jeanne went over to wake him up. “George, wake up.”

“I don’t want to go to school.” George turned over, his butt facing Jeanne.

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled into a smile.

Looking at George’s cute appearance at this moment, she wondered if it was a good idea for George to go to school or not?

She said, “Not to school, to pick up your master.”

George twisted his body. His brain was probably responding, but his body instinctively resisted.

Jeanne did not want to force George anymore. She said softly and gently, “Sleep for a while more, then. I’ll go pick Klaus up, but I’ll call you after. You have to go out, understand?”

“Okay,” George agreed.

Jeanne covered George with the blanket, put on makeup, and changed her clothes. She then walked out of the Lawrences courtyard.

At this moment, on the second floor, Joshua stood on the balcony and said to his phone, “Brother-in-law, Jeanne has gone out.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne drove to pick up Klaus.

Since it was still early, she drove at a moderate pace.

The phone rang. She glanced at it and picked it up. “Godfather.”

“The media has found me,” West said straightforwardly.

Initially, Jeanne had specifically told West that when she was dealing with the matter of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse, the Muk Group should try not to make a sound.

Now that the media had found him, West needed to seek Jeanne’s opinion.

“They probably want to know your opinion of me and our current cooperation project,” Jeanne said, “Now that the results have been finalized, you can answer them directly.”

“Okay,” West agreed immediately. He could not help but say, “I’ve been watching your news for the past two days. To be honest, I’m a little scared of you now. Mr. Thorn really did train you personally. Your ability is indeed amazing.”

“Godfather, you’re flattering me. I’m driving to pick up Klaus now, so I won’t say anymore.”

“Be careful.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.
