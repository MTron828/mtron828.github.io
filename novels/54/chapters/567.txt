Chapter 568: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Jeanne smiled. “Since we have reached a consensus, I won’t waste more of your time. I hope everyone can take their places in three days.”

After that, she turned around and looked at Alexander with great respect. “President, my meeting is over. Do you have anything else to say?”

“No.”

“Meeting adjourned.”

As soon as Jeanne announced the end of the meeting, Alexander was first to walk out of the meeting room, with Jeanne following behind him.

The rest of the senior management also left quickly.

Since everyone was holding the document that contained whatever shameful deeds they had done, they had to leave as soon as possible.

Just as Jeanne returned to her office and sat down, the phone rang.

She glanced at the incoming call.

Alexander must be exasperated.

Jeanne took her time and made a call to Amy. “Make a cup of coffee for me.”

“Yes, Director Lawrence,” Amy replied respectfully.

“Cappuccino,” Jeanne suddenly reminded Amy.

Amy was stunned as Jeanne used to drink black coffee without sugar.

However, Jeanne did not explain herself to Amy. She had just thought of what Edward once said and went with her mood.

That was why she wanted something sweet.

She seemed to be thinking more and more about that man. When she thought of him, she would even smile.

She did not know if she would look forward to it in the future, but she felt that during this period of time, even if her happiness would be short-lived, she had to enjoy it.

At least, when they were separated, there would be no regrets.

Amy made a cup of cappuccino and placed it in front of Jeanne. “Director Lawrence, President Lawrence seems to be looking for you.”

“I know,” Jeanne said. “I’ll look for him after I finish my coffee.”

Amy really found Director Lawrence domineering.

She was always confident, calm, and composed in everything he did.

Jeanne finished her coffee, put on some makeup, and fixed her clothes before leaving the office to Alexander’s office.

During that time, Alexander had called her three times, and every time she said she would be there soon.

However, she did not make a move to his office until after a long time.

At that moment, Alexander was probably furious.

She knocked on the door and entered to see the furious Alexander and Joshua standing beside him.

Joshua had just gone through the whole fiasco with the senior management, so he probably was curious about it now. However, at the same time, he was probably mad with jealousy.

She appeared to be very respectful. “President, are you looking for me?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Stop that act!” Alexander did not seem to want to put on an act with Jeanne anymore and asked fiercely, “What did you do to make all the senior management accept your arrangements?”

Alexander probably did not expect the employee transfer to go so smoothly.

After all, he took two months back then, and even then, he did not produce any results.

At the thought of the possibility of being talked about, Alexander’s expression became even more unsightly.

However, Jeanne did not answer him.

Alexander was so angry that he slammed his hands on the desk. “Jeanne, what are you standing there for? Answer me. What did you do?”

“It’s not that I don’t want to answer, but grandpa doesn’t want me to tell you.”

“What did you say?”

“Grandpa said it’s related to some business secrets and that I can’t tell anyone. I’m just following what grandpa told me to do.”

“You!”

“President, I can’t go against my grandfather. If you really want to know, you can ask grandpa about it, and he’ll tell you.”

Alexander’s expression was grim.

Jeanne added, “Grandpa was the one who taught me to move the senior management around this way. Otherwise, how could I alone convince all of them?”

The anger that Alexander had been suppressing started to show on his face.

What Jeanne meant was that Jonathan taught her everything and that Jonathan taught her but not him.

He was so angry that his body was trembling.

“So, you should go and ask grandpa. He knows better than I do.” Jeanne flashed him a pure and innocent smile.

She even looked harmless.

That made Alexander even more furious.

He roared at Jeanne, “Don’t be so smug in front of me!”

“I’m not smug. It’s just what Grandpa told me to do. I have to listen to him.” Jeanne looked innocent.

The more she acted that way, the angrier Alexander became.

Jeanne could naturally see Alexander’s anger.

However, she did not care at all, and the corner of her lips curled into a faint smile. She said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first. After all, although all the senior management has accepted our plan, I’m still a little worried about whether something unexpected will happen.”
