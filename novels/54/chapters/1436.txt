On the Ferris wheel, Candice looked at Paige’s excited expression and said to Edward seriously.

Actually, she could let it slide. After all, it was understandable why Edward would do that. However, when she saw Paige’s innocent expression, it was hard for her to remain indifferent.

In Paige’s case, Edward’s overprotection of her was a form of harm to her.

Edward also saw the seriousness in Candice’s eyes at that moment, but he did not seem to be disgusted by her taking the initiative to bring up the issue of Paige’s education. He even seemed to be willing to discuss it with her.

“Paige has only grown up with a few people in her life. She has never interacted with outsiders or played with children of the same age. When she grows up, how will she integrate into society? Paige can’t be under your wing forever. One day, we’ll have to leave her, and she’ll have to live independently. One day,

she’ll get married and become someone else’s mother. By protecting her now, she’s losing the chance to be independent. Paige is still young and can still be corrected. Once she’s used to that kind of life, I don’t think she will be able to adapt to this society in the future. Humans are, after all, social animals.”

Edward listened to Candice’s righteous speech.

He said, “Then, what do you think I should do?”

After making sure that Edward was not angry, Candice said, “Send Paige to kindergarten. Don’t hire a private tutor for her. I should bring her out more often to let her interact with the outside world and show her what the world looks like.”

Edward fell silent.

Candice continued, “Harken has many high-class kindergartens, and I heard there are some aristocratic kindergartens with high privacy and security. Sending Paige there shouldn’t be too much of a security issue. If you’re really worried, you can send your guards to guard Paige every day during school hours.”

Edward said, “Do you really think Paige should go to kindergarten?” “I really think so,” Candice answered him firmly.

“Alright.” Edward nodded. “After I settle the paperwork, I’ll send Paige to kindergarten. ”

“Really?” Candice’s eyes lit up with surprise.

She was really excited.

How long had it been since he had seen the light in her eyes?

The corners of Edward’s lips curled up slightly. Then, he suddenly reached out and held Candice’s hand.

Candice was stunned. The two of them were originally sitting opposite each other. To balance out the weight in the carriage, Candice and Paige sat on one side while Edward sat alone on the other.

Hence, Edward’s actions at that moment startled Candice. He asked, “Candice, have you heard of a tale about the Ferris wheel?” “What?” Candice was still a little shy.

Although the two of them had kissed each other hundreds of times, she still felt a little uncomfortable kissing in public.

“When the carriage is at the highest point of the Ferris wheel, two people in love can kiss and receive God’s blessing.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That was probably a romantic lie made up by young couples to kiss each other.

Candice’s lips were suddenly sealed, and she stared at Edward with widened eyes.

Was he not aware that his precious daughter was still beside him? He…

“Oh.” Candice’s eyes widened.

She thought it would just be for a moment, enough for the so-called God to see them kissing. Unexpectedly, he deepened the kiss.

Was he not ashamed?

Candice blushed as Edward kissed her deeply.

That kiss was not erotic. It was… as if he loved her so much that he seemed to be afraid of losing her. However, Candice did not know why Edward had such deep feelings for her.

Just then, something flashed through her mind. It was a fleeting image of her having seen Edward covered in blood before. However, when she thought about it carefully, the memory was blank.

At that moment, Candice felt a little uncomfortable because of the images in her mind. The feeling was indescribable, but somehow, her heart ached for Edward.

She took the initiative to wrap her arms around his neck in response to his affection for her, forgetting where she was now.

Two people were stuck like glue.

“How long are you going to kiss for?” A childish voice suddenly sounded in their ears..
