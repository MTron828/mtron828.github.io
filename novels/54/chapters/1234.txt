1235 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise

“There won’t be any.” Edward gave her a definite answer.

“So, you’re saying that if we get married, everything will be simple?”

Edward put down his utensils and wiped the corner of his mouth. He said to Susan, “Ours is not called a marriage.”

Susan sneered and nodded. “That’s true too.”

Edward did not say anything else. He picked up his glass of red wine and drank it. At that moment, he had already shifted his gaze.

Susan looked at Edward’s side profile.

To Edward, their relationship was all for the sake of completing his mission.

With that, Susan lowered her head and continued to play with her phone. She opened her Facebook, typed a message, and posted it.

After posting the message, she said, “Go to my Facebook’s latest post and interact with it.”

Edward put down his wine glass. Then, he picked up his phone from the dining table and opened his Facebook.

When he opened it, his eyes paused.

He did not have many followers on Facebook, but he had quite a few. Besides, ever since he started Facebook, he had only posted one post.

That post was “Jeanne, My Heart”, and there was a photo attached to the post. It was a photo of him and Jeanne wearing their wedding gown and suit.

“I think you should delete it,” Susan suddenly said.

She knew what Edward was looking at.

After all, when she reminded Edward to interact with her post, she was suddenly curious and went to search for his Facebook.

That was when she saw the post, which had many likes and comments. There were even a few new ones questioning her and Edward’s relationship.

Edward’s throat moved as he covered up his emotions.

Then, his slender fingers deleted the post.

Susan smiled and said, “My Facebook account is my name.”

She reminded him that she could interact with him now. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Edward entered Susan’s name, and her latest post read, “Does anyone else think he’s handsome too?”

Below was a photo of him having dinner just now. At that moment, there were countless likes and comments below that post.

All of them said, “Handsome.”

“How sweet.”

“He’s too handsome.”

“The best in the world.”

Edward gave her post a like, and that was all.

Susan was speechless.

That guy was really too perfunctory. However, it was in line with his personality. If he were to say anything in the comments section, the public would probably think that they were deliberately acting.

In fact, just that little interaction was enough for the media to make news out of it for a long time.

After about ten minutes, the news came out.

“Ms. Gates Praised Fourth Master For Being Handsome, and Fourth Master Praised Himself.”

Susan could not help but laugh when she saw the news. The media really knew how to come up with titles.

She clicked on it and saw a screenshot of her Facebook post. Naturally, the screenshot also included the one that Edward liked.

After that, another piece of news came out. “Fourth Master Has Cleared All His Facebook Posts, Which Seems To Mean He’s Starting Anew!”

In one night, countless news articles revolving around Edward and Susan caused a huge commotion.

Jeanne would sometimes feel a little speechless as well because of her own doing.

When she woke up, it was already nighttime, and she was woken up by hunger again.

She sat in the dining room for dinner. Usually, if Edward did not eat with her, it meant that he would not be eating at home that night.

Since Jeanne was alone, she read the news while eating her dinner. She was reading the news about Edward and Susan.

It turned out it was Susan who had called him that afternoon, and the two of them were out for a candlelight dinner.

Jeanne scrolled through the news.

Teddy could not stand it anymore. He said, “Madam, it’s best if you don’t read it. It’s bad for your digestion if you look at your phone while you eat.”

Jeanne put down her phone.

It was not that he thought it would affect his digestion, but he really could not stand it anymore. Besides, she did not want Teddy to worry about her.

She did not think much of it when she saw first saw it anyway.

“Teddy,” she said.

“Yes, Madam.”

“Don’t call me Madam,” Jeanne said.

Teddy was stunned.

“Just call me Ms. Lawrence,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Teddy did not dare to call her that.

However, Jeanne did not make things difficult for him. She knew that it was not easy for Teddy either.

...

Anyway, it would not be long now.

After dinner, Jeanne habitually walked around the living room for a while as she thought that Edward would not be back so early.
