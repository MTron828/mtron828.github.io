Still, she was starting to panic, yet she could not help but check the news.

There were a lot of comments on the news — most of them denouncing Michael and her.

After all, from a moral standpoint, the affair between her and Michael was a heinous act.

She was still in a good state of mind as she read the news and comments like it was nothing until the car arrived at the hospital.

On the way to the ward, Monica, who was walking with her crutches, could feel a lot of pairs of eyes on her.

F*ck.

Had the news spread so quickly?

Those people looked at her with strange gazes, but she remained calm.

In the elevator, a few nurses walked in, and they seemed to be chatting. “Did you know Dr. Jones has been cheated on?”

“I saw the news. I heard his wife is dating her old lover–”

“Shh.” A nurse hurriedly called out to the other two.

At that moment, the two of them also noticed Monica, who had a gloomy expression on her face.

Then, instant silence filled the elevator.

Monica was fuming.

Seeing it on the news was one thing, but hearing it in person was another, and it made her mood worse.

The moment the elevator opened, Monica walked to the ward in a huff and stopped when she was at the door to the ward.

How was she going to explain it to Finn?

Now, everyone in the country thought she had cheated on him…

Nevertheless, she took a deep breath and pushed open the door.

In the room, Finn was on his phone. He did not even look up when he heard the door open. All he did was lay on the bed with his eyes on the phone screen.

Monica told the driver to put down the things and leave after.

As she was walking over to Finn, he ignored her.

Monica took a look, only to see that Finn was reading the news and its comments.

At that moment, all the news comments were filled with angry emojis as the entire country felt that she had cuckolded Finn.

She had thought of an explanation for herself, but at the moment, she could not bring herself to say it.

Instead, she stared at Finn’s expressionless face.

Every time Finn looked like that, Monica would start to get nervous.

She was fine with Finn losing his temper because, at least then, she would know how he felt about the situation. However, he was so cold and silent right now that she did not know how to approach him.

In the tense space, Finn lifted his eyes and looked at Monica. “Do I look like a cuckold to you?”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat before she answered seriously, “No, I don’t like cuckolds.”

Finn looked at her coldly, and Monica could not pretend anymore.

Suddenly, she climbed onto Finn’s bed.

Finn’s face darkened as he watched her do so.

After Monica climbed onto the bed, she did not lay her hands on Finn. Instead, she knelt in front of him.

Finn’s expression changed.

Monica said, “Hubby, I was wrong.”

Finn was stunned.

“I was wrong. I shouldn’t have hooked up with my ex-boyfriend.”

“So you hooked up with him?” No matter how tolerant he could be, Finn still could not hold himself back from saying that.

“It’s all a misunderstanding,” Monica quickly explained.

Finn glared at her.

Monica said, “Michael’s father is about to pass away. He treated me badly back then, so he felt guilty and wanted to apologize to me before he died. Since I’m a kind person, I agreed. I didn’t tell you because I was afraid you would misunderstand. You’re so narrow-minded. What if you get angry at me?”

“I’m narrow-minded?” Finn’s face darkened even more.

“No, no. I’m narrow-minded. I’m the one who judged a gentleman with my narrow-minded heart.” Monica admitted her mistake sincerely.

Finn kept quiet.

Monica continued, “So, I went to see Michael’s father. After that, nothing else happened. Michael just sent me back for me to pack our clothes, and then I wanted to come back to see you. I really couldn’t wait to return to your side.”

Finn pursed his lips.

Monica said, “I didn’t know Michael was still in the garage crying, so I comforted him a little. Who would’ve thought that the paparazzi would take a photo of us?”

Finn’s expression was still unsightly. “Comforted?”

“It was really just a hug,” Monica quickly said.

“So what else did you want to do?” Finn asked.

“No, no, no. I didn’t even want to hug him. Michael was the one who took the initiative to hug me. Besides, I didn’t push him away because I saw his tears on my skin and because he was really sad,” Monica kept explaining herself.
