Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’ll help you,” Monica suddenly said.

Reese fell silent. She looked at Monica quietly, but her face was filled with disbelief.

“What do you think I should do? I’ll help you,” Monica told them calmly.

At that, Reese cried even harder.

She looked at Monica and said, “Monica, I really don’t want you to–”

“I know.” Monica nodded as if she understood. Then, she turned to Michael. “Michael, am I the only one who can help you now?”

“No–” Michael shook his head.

“Tell me the truth.” Monica was very serious.

Michael chose to remain silent, which meant tacit agreement.

Monica said, “If you lose everything because of me, I’ll feel guilty too, and I don’t think I’ll be with Finn with peace of mind.”

Monica was speaking the truth.

It would have been fine if she did not overhear that conversation, but since she did, she could not be so indifferent to it.

“You just have to promise me we’ll part ways once you succeed.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I promise you!” Reese hurriedly said, “Once Michael gets a position in politics and can go against everyone who covets the Rosses, we definitely won’t make things difficult for you. I promise, and I’ll guarantee it with my life!”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

“Monica–”

“Michael, stop talking.”Monica looked at him. “I believe you’ll be able to get it done very quickly.”

Michael looked at Monica, and his eyes were filled with gratitude.

He said, “I never thought there’d come a day where I’d have to hurt you like this. I only wanted to give you the best in the world, and to think I’m asking you to do this for me now...”

His eyes suddenly turned red again.

He seemed to be filled with guilt.

“Michael, friendship is a two-way street. Since you’re in trouble, why can’t I help you? As long as you get yourself out of your current predicament quickly, we can part ways then. It’s just a small delay, but it doesn’t really affect me,” Monica comforted him.

“But Finn–” Michael looked at her.

Monica said, “I believe he’ll understand.”

He should understand. As long as she explained the situation properly... he would understand.

Michael nodded as if Monica had convinced him. “Monica, I promise you. I’ll definitely resolve the matter as soon as possible!”

“Monica, thank you so much.” Reese was beyond grateful to her.

Monica smiled and turned to look at the wound on Michael’s hand. She said, “His hand is still bleeding. Should we send him to the hospital?”

“No, we have a first-aid kit at home. I’ll just bandage it up here,” Michael said. “It’s not that bad.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

Reese brought the first-aid kit over and said awkwardly, “Monica, can you put this bandage on Michael for me? I’ll go to the kitchen and make some sandwiches. Michael hasn’t eaten anything all day.”

“Alright.”

Monica took the first-aid kit before she carefully stopped the bleeding, disinfected it, and bandaged it.

Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the high-rise apartment, a person had secretly photographed everything.

…

It was already nighttime when Monica left Michael’s apartment.

Once she was back, she planned to have a good talk with Finn.

She did not know if Finn would agree, but she could not let Michael be now.

Moreover, they had discussed in the afternoon that they would announce her divorce from Finn and her relationship with Michael to the public tomorrow. Hence, she wanted to make things clear to Finn before they announced it to the public.

She returned home, feeling a little nervous.

The moment she pushed open the door, she saw Finn sitting on the sofa in the living room.

Finn did not call or send her any messages after she left with Michael.

When she was at Michael’s apartment, she even picked up her phone a few times but did not see any messages from Finn.

As he walked over, Finn looked up at her.

Monica said, “I’m back.”

Finn nodded.

“Well...”

“It’s getting late. Rest early,” Finn said.

Monica bit her lip.

She did not know if Finn was angry at the moment, but she knew he was avoiding her.

Seeing that Finn suddenly stood up from the sofa, she threw her crutches aside and grabbed him.

Something in Finn’s eyes moved.

“Are you angry?” Monica asked carefully.

“I’m fine.”

That meant he was angry.

Monica explained, “I was caught between a rock and a hard place.”

“I know.”

Hence, he decided to endure it because Monica was like that — a person who could not bear to see others sad.

He admitted that when he saw Monica and Michael leave, he was so angry that he even wanted the chauffeur to crash into them.

However, he calmed down in the end.

He knew very well that Monica did not want to do that voluntarily. She just could not bring herself to hurt others in that situation.

He could understand, so he told himself that as long as Monica returned voluntarily, he would pretend that it never happened and that Monica never abandoned him.

Then, he could still be together with Monica.

Fortunately, she came back on the same night, and all was good.

He did not want to ask any more questions because he believed her.

He said, “Let’s go and get some sleep.”

They could go and get some sleep together.

At that moment, Monica said, “Finn, let’s get a divorce.”
