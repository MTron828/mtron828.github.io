1332 Chloe Slapped in the Face

“Alright, I’ll be there soon.” Monica was naturally in a good mood when she heard this news.

She had been working on this project for a long time. Moreover, she had drunk earnestly with him last night. If she still could not achieve her wish, she felt that she would be a failure.

She put down her phone in a good mood and walked out the door.

“Aren’t you going to eat breakfast?” Finn suddenly asked from the living room.

“Oh, I’m late already,” Monica said casually.

She also did not notice that there was porridge cooking through the open kitchen door.

“Are you free tonight?” Finn suddenly asked.

As Monica put on her shoes, she replied, “I can’t decide now. Is there anything?”

“The hospital’s department is having a gathering. They said we could bring family.”

“Let’s contact each other later,” Monica said.

Finn stared at Monica’s figure. He watched as she put on her shoes, opened the door, and prepared to leave.

He suddenly paused. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She saw Patsy at the door.

It had been a long time since this woman came here to look for Finn, even though she knew that Finn was still taking care of Patsy.

“Who are you?” Before Monica could speak, Patsy asked.

Monica frowned. This woman was crazy. Although they rarely see each other, because of Finn, they had more or less met twice in the past year. Now, this woman was actually asking who she was?!

What was going on?!

Just because Patsy had a facelift, she pretended not to know her?!

Monica actually did not quite understand Patsy. She had not realized before that Patsy had changed over the past few years.

Since the last time they met, what else had she done to her face?! Eyes, nose?! Or did he cut off her cheekbone?!

The woman still looked like Patsy but it was obvious that the details on her face had been altered.

“Monica,” Patsy suddenly called out her name in a daze.

Was this fellow putting on an act?!

It was believable.

It was rare for Monica to pay attention to Patsy so she opened the door and left.

So, the reason Finn did not go to work today was that he was waiting for Patsy?!

Anyway, how could a model worker such as herself give herself a break?

She left the house to work.

Patsy walked in.

“Finn?” Patsy walked in and looked at Finn with uncertainty in her voice.

Finn nodded slightly. He did not seem surprised by Patsy’s condition.

He asked, “Why are you here?”

“It’s just… found myself here. It’s as if I forgot something,” Patsy said in confusion. “Then, it was as if this was the only place I wanted to come to.”

Finn looked at Patsy and the confusion in her eyes.

He said, “Don’t worry. You’re fine.”

“Okay.” Patsy nodded.

She believed everything Finn said.

“Can I stay here for a few days?” Patsy asked.

Finn pursed his lips. He was hesitating.

The last time he talked to Nox about his predicament with Monica, he and Monica had not been relieved for nearly a month. Not only that, but he seemed to feel that Monica had distanced herself from him. It was just that she no longer cared about his existence.

Last night, he had also picked her up from another man’s embrace. He could even feel that the distance between Monica and the man was closer than he was to her.

“Finn?” Patsy was a little upset when she did not get an answer.

“Yea sure, just stay here.” Finn nodded.

“Thank you, Finn.” Patsy smiled gratefully.

She did not expect herself to be with Finn anymore. Her feelings for Finn were not love, but pure dependence. She was here now only to find that sense of security.

She felt that she was forgetting a lot of things. She was afraid that one day, she would not even remember herself!

She did not know why she had such a thought.

“Have you eaten?” Finn asked Patsy.

Patsy shook her head.

“Let’s eat together.” As he spoke, he went to the kitchen to get some porridge.

Patsy looked at Finn’s back.

No matter how she looked at it, he seemed… to be in low spirits.
