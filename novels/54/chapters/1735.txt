Chapter 1736: The Twins’ Names

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“If you weren’t named Monica, you might not have met Finn and given birth to twins. ”

“I don’t care.” Monica was very determined for Ruby not to name her children. Ruby wanted to say something else, but Finn said, “Mom, just let Monica be.”

“That’s right, Aunty. My two children were randomly named as well.” This time, Jeanne also took Monica’s side.

At the end of the day, she believed that the parents should be the ones to name their children. After all, it was a product of their love.

“Alright, alright. Whatever you young people say goes. Just don’t make them weird.” Ruby gave in.

Monica pouted angrily. She could not believe her mother had the cheek to complain about the name others suggested when she was not great a coming up with names herself.

“But what should I name them?” Monica muttered, seemingly finding it difficult to come up with names. The next second, she said excitedly, “Let me look through the internet.” “You can’t look at your phone,” Finn said. “It’ll tire your eyes.”

“Don’t be so superstitious!”

“I’d rather believe it than not,” Finn said with a serious expression. “We can’t take risks when it comes to your health!”

Even though he seemed domineering, she felt that she was doted on very much. Hence, she compromised.

“Let’s think of a nickname first.” Jeanne suggested, “Coming up with a nickname is a little easier. Then, after that, we can figure out a name. There’s no rush anyway.”

“That’s true.” Monica nodded. “What can their nicknames be? Hansel? Gretal?

“What do you think they are? Storybook characters?” Ruby could not help but mock. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I’m just throwing out ideas. Mom, haven’t you realized that you’ve stopped loving me ever since we had two babies?” Monica said angrily.

Ruby bit her lips and said, “That seems to be the case.”

Monica almost choked on her own saliva. She thought that her mother was silent for two seconds because she was reflecting on her guilt. Unexpectedly, she was only verifying whether what she said was true.

“I’ve thought of two,” Finn said.

“What are they?” Monica asked.

She was surprised that Finn was prepared. If she had known earlier, she would have thought about it earlier to avoid being looked down upon.

“The brother can be named Felix and the sister, Maya,” Finn said. “Isn’t that similar to our names?” Monica took half a second to react.

“Yes.” Finn nodded. “F for boys, and M for girls.”

“I think that works.” Ruby echoed, “The older brother will be called Felix, and the younger sister will be called Maya. How nice.” Monica thought so too.

“Jeannie, what do you think?” Monica asked Jeanne.

“It sounds good..” Jeanne agreed.

“Alright. Let’s call them Felix and Maya.” Monica was certain. Then, she added, “Felix and Maya Jones sound perfect.”

She seemed to like those two names very much. It was very simple but thoughtful.

“It’s Maya Cardellini,” Finn corrected her.

“What?” Monica did not understand.

“I said, the sister’s name will be Maya Cardellini,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica blinked. She was the only one not smart enough to realize what Finn was trying to say.

Gary got a little excited. “Finn, are you saying the sister can take our last name?”

“Yes. If you think it’s necessary, I can take your surname too. I’m an orphan, so I don’t care about this.”

However, it was obvious that the elderly valued it more because they were always talking about carrying on the family line.

“There’s no need for that. Only the sister taking our last name is fine.” Gary quickly said, “Alright, it’s settled. The older brother will be named Felix Jones, and the younger sister will be named Maya Cardellini! Honey, let’s go and register the two babies’ names as soon as possible.”

He was afraid that Finn would suddenly go back on his word. Ruby, on the other hand, glanced at Gary as if telling him to contain his excitement.

Only then did Monica seem to come to her senses, and at that moment, Finn’s gesture moved her again. Although she did not think he needed to do that, she realized Finn was always there for her and was always thinking of her..
