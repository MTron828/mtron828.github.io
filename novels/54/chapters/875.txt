876 Accumulating Power, Return to South Hampton City

There had also been times when she was so weak that she just wanted to lie on the bed and never get up.

She extinguished the cigarette. “You should rest, then.”

Lucy nodded.

As Jeanne left, Lucy looked at Jeanne’s back, the smile on her face fading away.

She did not know if she could help Kingsley to kill Jeanne’s Fourth Master Swan!

…

South Hampton City.

Monica was going mad.

She had carefully investigated everyone around Michael, but none of them matched Jeanne’s description of someone who would be interested in Michael.

Michael’s life was just too simple. All he did was work.

He did not have any interactions with the outside, let alone with any woman she could use.

She was close to having another mental breakdown. Why was it so difficult for her to achieve something but so easy for Jeanne?

She was in an extremely irritable state when the phone suddenly rang.

Monica looked at Michael’s incoming call, wanting to smash her phone. However, she fought the urge and answered the call. “Hello?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s my mom’s birthday tonight. We’ve invited some relatives and friends to a small birthday party. Dress up. I’ll pick you up after work.” Michael’s tone was very cold.

Ever since the two of them had blown up in the face of the public, their relationship had been in bad shape.

She did not answer. She did not want to attend Reese’s birthday party.

“I hope you know your place. We’re getting married soon, so don’t cause any unnecessary trouble.” Michael’s tone was even colder.

Monica pursed her lips. “I understand.”

Just like that, she reluctantly agreed to go.

Michael, on the other end, did not say anything more and hung up. Monica was so angry that she threw her phone on the bed again.

She really was being led by the nose by Michael, but Monica calmed herself down. If what Jeanne’s said was true, when the time came, she would tear Reese’s face apart and ruin her high and mighty image as a noble lady!

Today’s birthday party might be an opportunity. With this mentality, Monica went to participate. She even dressed up meticulously.

Michael looked at her clothes, a little impressed.

“I thought you told me not to cause trouble? I’m afraid if I don’t dress up to attend your mom’s birthday party, she’d beat me to death!” Monica said fiercely.

Michael did not suspect anything.

As he drove, he said, “The crisis of Cardellini Medical Technology has been resolved.”

“Okay.” She knew.

Her father had told her about it. Michael was really realistic.

Two days after the news came out, Cardellini Medical Technology returned to its absolute position in the medical world. Her father was not being ostracized by the board of directors anymore, and his position as chairman was secure. Now that their family crisis had been resolved, she had nothing to worry about.

Michael drove to the Rosses’ compound. Every time she came here, Monica would feel traumatized.

A few years ago, she had lost all face here and was mocked by the Rosses. The last time she was here, she was even slapped by Reese. Just thinking about it made her angry.

Walking into the hall, she noticed that some people were already there. It was obvious that it was a small gathering.

What a tragedy to be born into a family like the Rosses. He had to pay attention to everything and also suppress.

Michael and Monica attracted everyone’s attention as soon as they entered the hall. Since Michael was doing very well now, his relatives and friends naturally took the initiative to curry favor with him.

Many people in the hall walked over. “Michael’s back.”

“Michael has grown so much.”

“Michael’s such a talent.”

Everyone was complimenting Michael while treating Monica like she was air.

Oh, how she wished she was air.

However, she had to hold Michael’s hand and force a fake smile.

“Is this Michael’s fiancée? She’s even more beautiful in person than on television. When I saw the news about you, I thought you two were a perfect match.” Finally, someone noticed her.

Monica barely managed to cope with it. It was not easy to deal with most relatives.

Then, Michael led Monica to the main character of today’s banquet, Reese.

Reese was dressed in a bright red today. With her noble temperament and well-maintained figure, she did not look fifty at all. At forty years old, she still had a lingering charm.

“Mom,” Michael said respectfully. “Happy Birthday.”

Reese had always been good to Michael. The corners of her mouth curled out a smile, never once looking at Monica.
