1358 I Actually Don’t Love You That Much

He just did not want to make things difficult for Monica. Moreover, Finn’s tone was firm.

Did they break up or not?

Brandon just stared at their silhouettes, and it took everything in him to hold himself back.

…

Finn carried Monica back to her apartment. Monica was well-behaved as she slept peacefully in Finn’s arms.

When he gently placed Monica on the bed, she frowned, turned over, and fell asleep again.

However, Finn did not leave immediately. Instead, he undressed her. She reeked of alcohol, and her clothes were so tight that no matter how he looked at them, they just looked uncomfortable.

Just like that, he helped her undress. Monica did not resist and even slept very well. However, when she felt a little chilly, she subconsciously opened her eyes.

The moment she opened her eyes and saw a man, she was so shocked that she instinctively covered her body. Only then did she realize that her body felt bare and that she had been stripped naked…

“You–” Finn said.

“Brandon, I knew you had bad intentions toward me!” Monica suddenly shouted.

Finn was petrified.

“I-I-I-I…” Monica pulled the blanket and burrowed herself in it. “Men are all evil. Leave immediately, or I will call the police!”

Finn did not know whether he should be happy. Although Monica was drunk and called out another man’s name, it was to reject the approach of that man.

His throat moved slightly, and he said, “I’m Finn.”

The woman who had shrunk into the sheets seemed to pause for a moment.

Finn? Did she not go drinking with Brandon? How did it become Finn?

She did not see the person clearly when she opened her eyes just now, and her mind was still stuck on the scene when Brandon sent her home. Therefore, she naturally thought that Brandon was the one taking off her clothes.

At that moment, she felt hurt that she was wrong about him. In fact, she trusted Brandon because she felt that he would not do such a thing.

Monica stuck her head out from under the blanket for a long time until she confirmed that the man in her room was Finn.

After the shock just now, she was more than half sober now.

“Why are you here?” Monica asked.

“I was passing by and saw you drunk. I thought you needed help.”

“Where’s Brandon?”

“He left,” Finn said casually. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Left?” Monica found it unbelievable.

How could Brandon hand her over to Finn and leave?

“Are you feeling better?” Finn could tell what Monica was confused about, but he did not intend to explain himself and changed the topic.

“I’m fine. You can leave.” Monica was indifferent.

It was just that her attitude toward Brandon was completely different. It was true that she rejected Brandon just now, but it was obvious that she did not feel as distant toward him as she did Finn.

“Don’t get drunk next time.”

“That has nothing to do with you,” Monica said bluntly.

“You’re the one who doesn’t feel good,” Finn said.

Sometimes, Monica really hated how serious Finn was. He would always come across as a good person who had no emotions, and he would treat everyone the same.

“I’ll get you a glass of water. You’re drunk, so you must be thirsty.”

“Finn,” Monica called out to him. “Can you stay away from me?”

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

“I can take care of myself.” Monica enunciated each word clearly, “I don’t need you to act like a good person.”

“If you could take care of yourself, you wouldn’t get so drunk.”

“It has nothing to do with you how drunk I am. We’ve broken up.” Monica reminded him.

Finn looked at her and saw how determined she was.

“I don’t want to argue with you.” Monica seemed to have lost a lot of patience with Finn. “You can leave now. I want to rest.”

Finn hesitated for a few seconds before he around and left.

The moment he walked out of the room, Monica suddenly said, “Finn, I actually don’t love you that much.”

Finn’s hand paused for a moment.

“Back then, I stopped the car accident for you not because of love, but because I was depressed and didn’t want to live.” Monica said, “Please don’t misunderstand and feel burdened by it.”
