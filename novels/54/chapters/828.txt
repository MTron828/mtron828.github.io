Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No,” Jeanne replied. “I remember it very well. I remember that Edward and I have different standpoints, and no matter who leads Harken, it won’t end well for us. However, Edward is trying to save me this time, and I can’t be indifferent to him.”

“You can’t do it?” Kingsley was truly pissed off.

“I can’t do it.” Jeanne was certain.

“Jeanne, you’ve really disappointed me.” Kingsley, who was trying to suppress his anger, was starting to become enraged.

It was very intense and terrifying.

If anyone else were standing in front of Kingsley, that person would have died a thousand times over.

Jeanne was the only one who could do whatever she wanted to Kingsley and live after doing that.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed, and he ordered, “Take her away!”

It was an order to Mason.

Mason walked over and glanced at Jeanne.

“Don’t touch me!” Jeanne’s voice was loud as she shouted at Mason and Kingsley, “If you kill them today, I’ll die in front of you!

“Jeanne!”

“I mean what I say!” Jeanne’s sudden outburst was actually very strong.

At that moment, she even picked up the gun and pointed it at her own head, forcing Kingsley to agree to her request.

Kingsley’s expression was extremely unsightly.

He asked, “Jeanne, are you sure you want to go against me?!”

“I’ve never been able to meet your demands!” Jeanne yelled at Kingsley, “I can’t be as cold-blooded as you. I’m not as cruel as you.”

It turned out that in Jeanne’s heart, he was cold-blooded and cruel.

He glared at her, his only family member in the world, and said, “In that case, I will help you reach my level.”

Kingsley raised his hand again, and the gun still aimed at Nox.

At the same time, his other hand grabbed Jeanne’s hand that was holding the gun and forced her to shift the muzzle from her head to his chest, pointing it directly at his heart.

He said, “The best way to stop me from killing them is to kill me. ”

Jeanne’s entire body was trembling.

She tried to pull the gun away from Kingsley’s chest, but he was too strong, so strong that she could not resist him.

She heard Kingsley say, “I’m not wearing a bulletproof vest.”

With no bulletproof vest, if she were to shoot him in the heart, he would definitely die.

Jeanne broke down as she could not suppress her emotions anymore.

Why did Kingsley have to force her hand?

“I’ll give you three seconds to think. Kill me or let me kill them!” Kingsley’s harsh words sounded in Jeanne’s ears.

In this world, there was no one crueler than Kingsley.

He was not just cruel to others, but he was so cruel to himself that it was terrifying.

Was that the head of the Hills?

“Three.” Kingsley counted down.

Jeanne was shaking as she gripped her gun tightly.

“Two,”

“One.”

Kingsley did not slow down the countdown.

He said, “Have you thought about it?”

Jeanne, who was still holding the gun in her hand, did not respond.

She knew very well that she would not shoot Kingsley. However, if she did not shoot, Edward, Nox, and Finn would be the ones to die.

“Even if you haven’t. I’m going to do it.” Kingsley did not give Jeanne any more time to think.

His eyes narrowed.

The gun was pointed at Nox when suddenly, a deep male voice rang out, “I’ll die.”

His voice also successfully attracted everyone’s attention.

“Kingsley,” Edward called out to him.

In the end, Kingsley still showed Edward some respect by turning to look at the man who had not involved himself too much in the entire thing.

After all, his body’s condition did not allow him to be involved in the gruesome fight.

However, he spoke up in the end.

He said, “If you kill them, it’s just two more lives in your hands. But if you kill me, you’ll kill the most loyal supporter of the Duncans’ descendant.”

Kingsley sneered. “So you’d rather die for Nox and Finn?!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“To you, they’re nothing, but to me, they’re so much more than that,” Edward said bluntly.

“But why should I let them go? It’s a piece of cake for me to kill you now. Why should I leave behind a future threat?”
