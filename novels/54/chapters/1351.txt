1352 The Wedding: Last Night As A Bachelor

How could Edward get married like it was a matter of fact? Was he not afraid that Jeanne would crawl out of her grave?

She wanted to dig Jeanne out of her grave to scare that sc*mbag, Edward.

Of course, Monica was just being unreasonable. When she had to face him, she still fawned over him.

Thinking about how scared she had been for the past few days, afraid that Edward would take revenge on her, she put down her phone and turned to face the door. “Come in.”

The door was pushed open.

Tim walked in with a bouquet of flowers. “Chairman, your flowers.”

Monica was used to it.

She had been receiving them every day for the past few days. She did not know who sent them as they were unsigned. Every day, there was only a card with a sentence written on it.

Tim put the flowers aside and handed the card to Monica as usual.

Monica took it and glanced at it.

“A day apart feels like three years.”

Monica threw the card into the drawer beside her. She did not have to think much to be certain that it was Brandon, who was the only person she thought would do something so boring.

In fact, she did not give Brandon any hope. She believed that in her current state, she was not suitable for dating at all. She even had a huge aversion to relationships between a man and a woman.

Suddenly, the phone rang.

Monica took a look and answered the call. “Nox.”

“I’m celebrating Edward’s last night as a bachelor. Do you want to come along?”

“He still has the cheek to celebrate being single.” Monica looked down at Edward. “He’s been married three times. How can he be so thick-skinned?”

“Should I say that Edward is right beside me? And that you’re on speaker?”

Monica really felt Nox would kill her one day.

Just as she was racking his brains to think of a way to make things right, Nox smiled brightly and said, “I’m lying to you.”

‘Damn you, Nox!’

“I’ll send you the address.”

“No, thanks.” Monica rejected him directly. “I’m not free tonight.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What are you busy with?” Nox did not believe her at all.

“I’m busy accompanying Jeanne,” Monica said bluntly.

Nox was speechless.

“To tell her that the man she loves is getting married again; to tell her that she should find a few more men in heaven and not stay single. It’s not worth it.”

Nox could never out-talk Monica.

“Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’m very busy.” Immediately after, Monica hung up the phone.

She was not so kind as to celebrate Edward marrying someone. On the contrary, she could not wait for the heavens to suddenly strike him down and make him impotent for the rest of his life.

On the other end of the phone, Nox put down his phone helplessly. Edward was not by his side, but Finn was.

Evidently, Finn had heard their conversation, even though he did not show much emotion on his face.

“So, you won’t be able to see Monica tonight,” Nox said.

He had asked Monica out not for Edward but for Finn.

“Alright.” Finn nodded.

Nox could not help but ask curiously, “What have you done for Monica these past few days?”

“I’ve been sending flowers.” Finn did not hide it from Nox.

“I can’t believe you know how to send flowers.” Nox suddenly felt that Finn was not as simple-minded as he thought. “Did Monica accept it?”

“I told the florist to send it directly to her company.”

“Did you sign it?” Nox asked.

“No.”

“So, it’s very likely that Monica doesn’t know that it’s from you.”

“She should be able to recognize my handwriting,” Finn said.

Nox felt a little worried.

However, that was a good idea. Pursuing a woman should be done step by step and not too hastily. Especially in Finn and Monica’s current state, the best way to help with their relationship was to be silent.

As such, Nox did not ask further. He was excited as he made plans to go drinking with Edward tonight.

It had been a long time since they last drank together, and he had almost forgotten the feeling of drinking with the three of them.

Finn had also specially requested a day off for Edward’s wedding tomorrow.

When it was past 6 p.m., Nox and Finn went to their usual place to wait for Edward.

There were only three of them tonight, and Nox did not bring Zoe either. After all, it was a man’s bachelor night, and it would be weird to have a woman by his side. Moreover, Zoe was obedient and would not pester him at a time like that.

In fact, Nox was very satisfied with Zoe.

Just when he thought that he had had enough fun and that it was time to stop and live a good life, Zoe fulfilled all his criteria for choosing a wife. For example, she came from a wealthy family, was beautiful, had a great figure, and had a good personality.
