Chapter 316: Set a Date for the Wedding

She was not supposed to come, but she did not explain further. “I heard from Amy the transitioning of the senior management role isn’t going well.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Everyone in the senior management is with power, and in Lawrence Enterprise, they each have seniority and status. Even if the human resources department has been taking the lead in this matter, without a strong leader to push it forward, as long as the senior management doesn’t do their job, the human resources department can’t make the transition go smoothly.”

“That is to say, President Lawrence didn’t care about it at all.” Jeanne knew very well.

“Indeed, he didn’t. Moreover, President Lawrence’s attitude when doing things is that as long as he has given the orders, he’ll wait for the results. He will not waste any more time and handle things personally unless he encounters a problem. If he encounters a problem, his ability to solve the problem would also be very worrying,” Forrest said bluntly.

Jeanne did not need to put in any good words for Alexander because that was the truth.

She said, “Okay, I got it. I’ll think of a way to solve this matter. By the way, have you sorted out the senior management’s previous situation?”

“It’s here.” Knowing that Director Lawrence would want it, he already had it prepared.

Jeanne took it and looked at it seriously.

Then, she said, “Gather the project team members to have a meeting to discuss the sales pilot of the logistics warehouse.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne put down the information and went to the meeting room with Forrest.

In the meeting room, the project team members were all present.

Jeanne did not waste any more time and went straight to the point. “I need three sets of data. First, how many users do we have for the pilot marketing, and what is the success rate of the sales? Second, how many users do we have to contact for promotions, and what is the success rate of the sales? Third, I need a questionnaire. The questionnaire should include whether they like the interface of the e-commerce platform, whether it’s user-friendly, whether the e-commerce activities are attractive, and what suggestions they have for the e-commerce platform. Forrest, make the necessary arrangements.”

......

“Yes.” Forrest was extremely respectful.

“Who is currently liaising with MUK Group?” Jeanne asked.

“I am,” Hans quickly replied.

“Once the data is out, meet with the person in charge tomorrow morning to discuss the optimization of the progress of the pilot project. Let me know when you’ve confirmed the time.”

“Yes.”

“Right. Who is the person in charge of the pilot project this time?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“It’s Deputy Director Lawrence.”

“Okay, I got it.” Jeanne nodded. “Everyone dismissed.”

After that, she left immediately.

The people in the meeting room could not help but lament, “I don’t know why, but I have a feeling that with Director Lawrence around, our work efficiency will be much higher.”

“That’s true. She can get to the point and explain it clearly to us every time. On the other hand, Deputy Director Lawrence doesn’t know what he wants and still has to rely on us to figure it out.”

“I hope Director Lawrence will always lead us.”

…

Jeanne did not return directly to her office.

Instead, she knocked on Joshua’s door.

Joshua was in the middle of a game, so when he heard the knocking on the door, he ignored it.

Jeanne did not want to waste more time and immediately pushed open the door.

Joshua was a little unhappy, but the moment he turned his head and saw Jeanne, the words got stuck in his throat. Even so, he ignored Jeanne and continued to play his game.

Jeanne did not react to Joshua’s lack of work etiquette. She simply went up to Joshua and said indifferently, “You don’t need to be involved in the pilot marketing of the e-commerce platform anymore!”

Joshua’s expression changed instantly, and he roared at Jeanne, “Why?”

“Because my position is higher than yours. I’m not discussing it with you but arranging it for you.”

“Jeanne, don’t think you’re so great just because you have some money!” Joshua was so angry that he quit his game and stood up angrily from his seat.

“I’m just informing you.”

“Jeanne!”

By then, Jeanne had already walked out. The moment she walked out, she said to Joshua’s secretary, “Give Amy all the information on the e-commerce platform project.”

Joshua’s secretary was put in an awkward situation.

She turned her head to look at Deputy Director Lawrence in the office.

Deputy Director Lawrence was so angry that he could kill someone, while on the other hand, Director Lawrence was so nonchalant that she could not refuse.

The secretary braced herself and handed the things to Amy.

When Jeanne returned to the office, she devoted herself to her work.

Kingsley said the most valuable thing about her was that she was more serious than anyone else when doing something.

However, this was not valuable.

She was forced to do it.

The environment made people, and she just went with the flow.

At 5:30 p.m., Jeanne’s phone rang.
