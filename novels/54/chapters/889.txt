890 Humiliated At the Wedding, Michael Is Utterly Embarrassed!

Once the wedding ceremony was over, all the guests made their way to the banquet hall at the golf club to enjoy lunch.

Monica, on the other hand, was once again sent to the dressing room to change into another outfit.

She started to feel a little uneasy.

When was Jeannie going to expose Michael’s video? She was not planning to post it once the wedding had ended and they were sent to the bridal chamber, was she?

Monica really did not want to sleep with Michael. She could not even stand the moment Michael kissed her, let alone…

Monica shook her head. She felt that she should trust Jeannie.

However, she was still a little worried. How was Jeannie going to post the video?

Michael had done all the wedding arrangements, and she had not intervened in any of the circumstances, so she did not know where to find a loophole.

That made Monica a little anxious.

“Godmother.” Outside the door, a little boy walked in.

Monica saw George.

George was wearing a black suit with a small bow tie, and his hair was especially combed back. Although he was still wearing black-rimmed glasses, he still looked very handsome. He gave off the feeling of a little prince.

Monica beckoned George over, and George obediently walked over to Monica’s side.

“What are you doing here?”

“I’m here to congratulate you,” George said bluntly.

“So, you still do have some conscience.” Monica smiled. “My love for you isn’t in vain.”

Every time she said she loved George, his face would turn red.

He said, “Godmother, I’ve prepared a wedding gift for you.”

“You’re a good boy, aren’t you?” Monica was overwhelmed by the unexpected favor.

George said, “Lower your head.”

“Huh?” Monica frowned and bent down, thinking that George was going to whisper something to her.

George suddenly planted a kiss on her face, and she heard a loud “pop”.

Monica was stunned.

Did George not hate getting close to anyone?

She looked at George, and it made George blush.

George said, “My mom said you’ll like it.”

“Your mother? Your mom is back?” Monica was pleasantly surprised, but in the next second, she realized that she was overthinking. She muttered, “She told you on the phone, right?”

George did not answer because his mother said that he could not tell his godmother.

“Whatever. I really like your gift.” Monica did not allow herself to be sad.

She then held George’s face and returned the gesture by planting a kiss on his little face with a pop.

George blushed again. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Monica looked at George’s face and could not help but laugh. At the same time, she also could not help but sigh. “I originally wanted to give you a younger brother.”

“Huh?” George looked at Monica.

“A little brother as cute as you.”

“In that case, have one.” George said innocently, “I’ll try my best to… take care of him.”

Monica smiled again.

She felt an inexplicable warmth in her heart as she realized that there were still many people who loved her, even if she was not very smart and sometimes even a little stupid.

She said, “I’m afraid there won’t be many chances in the future. But to me, you’re enough. Come, let me kiss you again before I go out to propose a toast.”

George quickly dodged.

“I’m going out. My mom– My dad is still waiting for me outside.” George quickly corrected himself.

Monica did not notice those details either.

She just watched as George walked away with his short legs.

The smile at the corner of his mouth was still a little bitter.

She used to think that she would have an adorable son and a child with the person she loved.

Just then, someone knocked on the door again, urging her to go out and make a toast.

She composed herself and put on a red, fishtail gown that had a train. The tight-fitting design revealed her beautiful figure.

She had to admit that Michael had put a lot of thought into the wedding.

At least, Michael knew that she loved to look pretty, so he was careful in choosing a wedding dress and gown.

When she walked out of the dressing room, Michael had already changed into a black suit and was waiting for her at the door.

She recalled her wedding a few years ago.

At that time, she thought it was just a formality, but for some reason, it was so deeply etched in her memory that she could remember many details of the wedding.

She remembered she changed into several different outfits during the wedding, and she had chosen all of them by herself. Due to time constraints, she did not get a designer to custom-make the dresses for her. She only chose the wedding dresses that she thought were acceptable and made her look beautiful no matter what. She even chose a few outfits for Finn, thinking that they had to look like a match. Hence, to not embarrass herself, she picked out the outfits seriously for Finn.
