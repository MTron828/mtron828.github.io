“Why would I do anything rash? I’m just giving you some advice on account of our relationship.” “You’re smart.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Hmph.” Cody snorted.

Zoe abruptly hung up the phone and called her father. “Dad, I have evidence that Nox cheated on me.”

“What?”

“I said, Nox cheated on me when we were in a relationship. Wouldn’t that be beneficial to our family?” “Of course, this is our last hope. Come back quickly and show me the evidence.” “Alright,” Zoe quickly agreed.

She knew very well that it was impossible for her to get back with Nox. Hence, she had to do anything she could to save her life.

After Nox drove Zoe away, he lay on the bed, lost in thought. He thought about something for a moment before picking up the phone and calling his assistant.

“I want you to get back the money that we invested in The Sullivan Group immediately and not a single cent less. If they don’t return the money, we’ll sue them in court.”

“Yes,” the other party said respectfully. “However, Chairman Winter, once we withdraw our investment, based on The Sullivan Group’s current situation, they will have to declare bankruptcy. The artificial intelligence technology we invested in will also go down the drain.”

“Acquire all the artificial intelligence research and development teams in The Sullivan Group, and we’ll manage them ourselves.” Nox said, “Just do as I say. If you encounter any problems, tell me immediately!”

‘Yes.”

Nox hung up and called Edward.

The call connected. “I heard you’ve been discharged from the hospital.”

“Yeah, I stayed for seven whole days, and you didn’t come to see me even once!” Nox said angrily.

“Didn’t I send you to the hospital on the first day?”

“Should I be grateful?”

“You know I’m very busy.”

“So you don’t care if I live or die, right?”

“Well, aren’t you alive and kicking now?

“Would it kill you to care about me?” Nox was so angry that he almost jumped up from the bed.

“Are you feeling better?” Edward asked perfunctorily.

Furious, Nox said, “I’m not going to talk nonsense with you. I’m just calling to tell you that I’ve made a move on The Sullivan Group and I’m taking back the artificial intelligence technology that you wanted me to develop to do it myself. ”

“Sure.” Edward agreed immediately.

“That’s it. I’m hanging up.” Nox was about to put down his phone.

However, Edward suddenly asked, “Are you really feeling better?”

Nox pursed her lips. “So what if I’m not feeling better? Anyway, I’ve become the joke of the nation.”

Edward smiled and said, “Actually, it’s a good thing you didn’t marry Zoe because you might’ve regretted it.”

“What are you talking about?”

“You should know very well that you were hesitating, right?”

Nox gritted his teeth. He knew he could not hide anything from Edward. Others could not tell, but Edward could tell at a glance.

“Now is a good time for you to think about who you want.”

Nox chose to remain silent. It was not that he wanted to hide anything from Edward, but he could not make up his mind.

“I won’t say anymore.” With that, Edward hung up.

The conversations between men were usually straightforward and direct.

Nox put down his phone and lay on the bed. Suddenly, he was not angry anymore. Instead, was deep in thought.

“Who do you want?” Edward’s words were echoing in his mind.

Who else could it be?

Shelly and Benjamin brought Bella home from the hospital. It was a fully furnished two-bedroom apartment. From the 200 thousand dollars that Shelly got from Zoe, she spent 190 thousand dollars on the apartment.

When Shelly bought it, her heart really ached, but now, she was happy to have a place she could call home. After all, the sense of security and the comfort of having her own home was indescribable.

It was also Benjamin’s first time entering Shelly’s house, and he was a little surprised. “Is this apartment yours?” “I just bought it,” Shelly said.

“The houses in this area aren’t cheap.”

“It wasn’t cheap. Zoe gave me money to buy it.” Shelly answered him while tidying up the house, not hiding anything from Benjamin.

“She gave you money?”

“When I was working at the nightclub, I often saw Zoe fooling around with other men. Later, Zoe found out about my relationship with Nox and was afraid that I would tell Nox, so she gave me 200 thousand dollars to keep my mouth shut. I thought that since she was willing to give it to me, I would accept it,” Shelly explained.

Benjamin smiled. “I suddenly realize that you’re smarter than I thought..”
