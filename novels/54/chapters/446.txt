Chapter 447: Humiliating Eden In Public
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
“You’re blaming me for the Lawrence Enterprise suffering a heavy loss? Don’t forget. I married Jasmine, so I’m also a part of the Lawrence family. The Lawrences’ loss is also my loss!” Eden was still agitated.

“To the Swan Enterprise, this small loss is like a drop in the ocean. You don’t have to care about it at all! More importantly, the reason you did this was to use this opportunity to make me leave Lawrence Enterprise. After all, this project is my responsibility, and if the project fails, it’ll be my responsibility!”

“Jeanne, what nonsense are you spouting? Who hurt you? I don’t give a damn about you! Since we broke up seven years ago, I haven’t cared about you at all. Who gave you the confidence to make you think that I still care about you? You think too highly of yourself!” Eden ridiculed her.

Jeanne sneered.

At that moment, Henry said again, “Jeanne, I think you’re unhappy that Eden chose to be with Jasmine back then. To be honest, I don’t think that Jasmine has any outstanding qualities. But now that I see you like this and how ugly you are deep down, I’m really glad that my son didn’t choose you back then. Or else–”

“Or else, what?” Edward’s face darkened.

He had been silent the entire time, but the moment he opened his mouth, he could not suppress his anger anymore

Henry was still a little afraid of Edward, so he paused and did not say anything more.

Then, Jeanne played another voice message in front of everyone.

It was the conversation between Jeanne and Eden.

“Are you still hung up on what happened seven years ago?” It was Eden’s voice.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Young Master Swan, you’re overthinking it…”

“... I’m not that indifferent to you. As long as you take the initiative, I can help you with many things.”

......

“...I dare not ask Young Master Swan for help either... Right now, I don’t have the guts to go against Jasmine...”

“If I promise Jasmine won’t do anything to you, will you–”

“Young Master Swan, your actions have consequences.”

The voice message ended there.

Eden’s face instantly turned black.

He could not believe Jeanne had that recording, and neither did he notice Jeanne was recording!

When Jeanne saw Eden’s expression, she smiled.

When she returned after seven years, she told herself that she would collect as much evidence as she could with a recording device, a miniature camera...

She was everywhere!

At that moment, everyone was also looking at Eden. They did not expect Eden would do such a thing behind Jeanne’s back!

Everyone thought it was Eden who did not want Jeanne back then.

Moreover, Eden had indeed humiliated Jeanne. He did it so resolutely. To the world, he showed that he was in love with Jasmine, but unexpectedly, he was now so shameless toward Jeanne!

Henry’s expression changed as he glared fiercely at his son.

Eden gritted his teeth and kept quibbling, “I was testing Jeanne on purpose!”

Jeanne sneered.

Eden said, “I saw Jeanne was seducing Fourth Uncle, and I thought she was up to no good. That was why I wanted to test her. Jeanne, you think too highly of yourself. I can’t believe you even recorded our conversation. Do you really think that I still have feelings for you?”

“Whether you do or not, you’re well aware of it, Director Eden.”

“Don’t think too highly of yourself...” Eden gritted his teeth.

Jeanne said, “Director Eden, since everyone has their own opinions, let’s meet in court.”

It seemed that she did not want to say anything anymore.

Eden’s body tensed up.

Jeanne ignored Eden and turned her head toward Edward. “Call the police. Let the Judicial Department investigate and collect evidence first.”

Edward nodded before picking up the phone.

“Wait!” Eden became anxious.

Everyone looked at him, who was suddenly looking extremely flustered!
