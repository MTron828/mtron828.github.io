938 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

Before he could finish his sentence, Tim pushed the door open and entered. “The board of directors are in the conference room now. They want Mr. Warren to give them an explanation.”

Steve sighed and thought, ‘Speak of the devil.’

He said, “Okay, I’ll be there right away. You go and calm them down first.

“Yes.” With that, Tim left.

Steve said to Monica, “I’ll go to the board of directors’ conference room first. If I don’t give them an explanation, they won’t let me off.

“I’ll go with you.” Monica gathered her courage and said.

Steve was a little surprised, but he could not help but advise, “They’re not as easy to deal with as you think. At this moment, the conflict is very intense. If you go, they might cause you harm.”

“Since I’ve made up my mind to come to the company, I’ve already made all the preparations. I can’t let you bear the responsibility alone.” Monica was very determined.

Steve chuckled. “In that case, you really have to be prepared.”

“Alright,” she said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Monica followed Steve to the Cardellini Enterprise’s board of directors conference room, where at least 20 people were inside.

Everyone was arguing and filled with righteous indignation.

The moment Monica and Steve pushed open the door, they finally shut his mouth. However, when they saw Monica, the crowd was in an uproar.

With Steve’s help, Monica sat in her father’s seat, and oe of the board members flew into a fit. “Why is Monica here? Is this a place for children to come and play? The Cardellinis are getting more and more unruly!”

“Mr. Warren, I always thought that you knew your limits and was a good right-hand man to the chairman. I can’t believe that you’re playing along with Monica now!”

“Monica, this isn’t the amusement park. Go out and turn right. There’s a children’s play area there. Don’t disturb us from talking serious business here!”

“Hurry up and get lost!” one of the board members cursed, not showing Monica any respect at all.

At that moment, Monica was frightened by everyone’s contempt and criticizm of her.

She had never thought that they would be so fierce.

Steve quickly explained to everyone, “The chairman is in the hospital and can’t come now, so he has told his daughter to temporarily manage the company in his place–”

“Let Monica take over? Is Gary going to die?” One of the board members said mercilessly, “If he’s going to die, he should let one of us take the chairman’s position for him. Yet, he just called some random bugger to do it. Is he trying to destroy Cardellini Enterprise?!”

“How nice of Gary, knowing that he’s about to die, to just let go. We, the directors, have been with him for so many years and have invested so much money in him. All he has to do is he close his eyes and put an end to everything while us, the ones who are still alive, have to deal with what he has left behind. Isn’t he afraid that his grave will be dug up?” Another board member chimed in with his malicious words.

“Why don’t we use all of Cardellini Enterprise’s money to make a flower wreath for Gary and let him die a glorious death? Let everyone know that Gary has destroyed the Cardellini Enterprise…”

“That’s a good suggestion. Even though the Cardellinis only has a little money left, it’s still enough to make a big wreath,”

Everyone at the scene agreed as they cursed Gary and vented their emotions.

Steve looked at Monica and saw that her face had turned pale from their words. At that moment, he bit his lip and did not leave.

“Why don’t you go out first? I’ll handle this.” Steve whispered to Monica.

Monica raised her head and looked at Steve. Her eyes were a little red.

It was because she really did not expect those people to curse her father like that.

She had always thought that her father would be respected by many people, but only now did she know how difficult it had been for her father.

Those people were clearly not easy to deal with.

Suddenly, she stood up from her seat, but it did not attract anyone’s attention as everyone was still saying vicious things to vent their emotions.

“Do all of you want to see Cardellini Enterprise go down like that?” Monica’s loud voice resounded in the conference room.

Her voice stunned the crowd.

Everyone looked at Monica in surprise.

Monica said, “Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation is exactly as you’ve seen. Even if you curse my father and belittle me, you can’t change Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation! Don’t you think it’s disgusting to show your ugliest side? I admit that I’m a novice in the business world. I’ve always thought that businessmen in high positions carry themselves well that they’re all magnanimous and able to take responsibility, but now, I know that’s not the case. It turns out people in the business world can be so immoral and despicable for the sake of profit!”
