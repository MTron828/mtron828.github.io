Chapter 178: Fourth Master Swan’s Domineering Appearance

South Hampton City Central Hospital.

Finn took out all the information on Jeanne’s case and studied them. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jeanne’s case this time was rather tricky. The evidence of the crime was well prepared. It was obvious that it was premeditated.

The so-called dual contract? Jeanne’s signature was clear. The amount of each sum of money generated was even added. The detailed accounts were so well done. Moreover, it was hard to explain the 30 million dollars that came out of nowhere.

Finn thought about it seriously.

He carefully circled the contract and financial statements where there might be loopholes. He also noted down what he could look into.

In fact, when Jeanne’s accident happened yesterday, he had contacted Fourth Master.

Yes.

Apart from his normal phone number, Fourth Master Swan also had a very personal number. That would always be reachable, but very few people knew about it.

When the accident happened, Finn had told Fourth Master Swan about what happened to Jeanne. Nevertheless, there were many things about Fourth Master Swan that he could not tell other people, including Monica.

Fourth Master Swan instructed Finn to gather all the information on Jeanne’s case. He would rush back as soon as possible.

Everything that was required to be done must not alert the enemy and be done in secret.

After Finn finished organizing Jeanne’s case, he put the documents back into the drawer.

From the moment he received all the contents of the case yesterday, he had started to research and investigate. Now, he was only gathering information, so he did not need to spend too much time.

Finn stood up from his office chair, took a cigarette, and walked to an open-air balcony in the office.

The scene of Monica and Micheal kissing appeared in his mind.

In fact, Finn was quite a distance away at that time, but he seemed to have seen everything clearly at that moment, including when Monica initiated a kiss.

Finn took a deep puff of the cigarette.

Monica seemed to like to take the initiative toward everyone.

It was the same for him.

When they had just started dating, not long after they had confirmed their relationship, Monica had started to entice him in all sorts of ways. Although they were only limited to holding hands during the year of their relationship, Monica would still flirt with him from time to time.

The reason Finn did not fidget was only because of traditional thoughts. He thought that he should wait until after marriage.

He thought that precious things should have a sense of ceremony.

Who knew, the marriage between them became a complete marriage of convenience.

Now, this marriage of convenience was about to end!

…

In the detention center, Jeanne had just returned to the detention room when she was called out again.

Then, she saw Melody and Eden.

Her eyes moved, but she appeared very calm.

Melody looked at her, and the corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile. “How is it? Do you feel good now?”

Jeanne did not answer.

“I’ve always been curious. Where did you get the confidence to go against me? You’re just the daughter of a businessman, so what qualifications do you have to go against me?!” Melody was full of sarcasm.

“Ms. Sanders, before the final result of anything comes out, don’t jump to conclusions.”

“You’re still so stubborn at this time. You’re really more powerful than I thought.” Melody sneered. “But so what?! If I want to crush you in Harken, it would be easy!”

Jeanne’s face darkened slightly.

“Jeanne, if you were more sensible, you wouldn’t have to go through this.” Melody was really arrogant. “I heard that you also didn’t know what was good for you seven years ago. Right, Eden?”

Melody deliberately asked Eden, who was standing next to her.

Eden smiled sinisterly. “Yes. Seven years ago, a certain lady was just as ungrateful as she is now. Back then, I was dating her well. It was just a mistake that men often make. After I slept with Jasmine, she clung to me and insisted that I apologize to her in front of the nation!”

Jeanne watched the two of them speak in unison.

She only wanted to sneer.

“Jeanne, who do you think you are? You wanted me to apologize to you in front of the nation and admit that I let you down? Why don’t you see what qualifications you have to make me do that?! It’s undeniable that I did like you back then, but a woman should know her limits. Did you think that you could do whatever you want just because I liked you? Was the lesson I taught you seven years ago not enough?! You’re still so full of yourself. Do you really think that you can beat me?!” Eden was sarcastic. “On this point, Jasmine is much smarter than you.”
