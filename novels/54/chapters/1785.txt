Chapter 1786: A Forced Relationship Won’t Last

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You really do make me worry.” Sarah was speechless at how stubborn Shelly was.

Shelly was usually easy to talk to, but when it came to matters of the heart, she would become abnormally stubborn.

After they hung up, Shelly stood on the balcony for a while and felt a little melancholic about her life. It seemed like she had never been able to do anything as she wished since she was young and had been forced to live every day as it was.

She took a deep breath before returning to the room, where Nox was already asleep. It was rare that Nox had been sleeping earlier than usual. His life was very irregular, especially since he was used to nightlife, but unknowingly, Nox had changed many of his habits. Was it because he was getting old?

Nevertheless, Shelly did not take it to heart. She tiptoed onto the bed, afraid of waking Nox up. In reality, Nox was not asleep. He was forcing himself to sleep and did not ask Shelly who she was on the phone with; he did not dare to ask, even though he was mentally prepared.

In the quiet night, Shelly fell asleep very quickly, and her even breathing could be heard not long after. Shelly had a regular schedule, and since it was around the time she went to bed, she could fall asleep very quickly.

He, on the other hand, could not sleep all night. He wondered how long more would he and Shelly be sharing the same bed. He did not even want to sleep because he wanted more time with her.

With that, Nox turned around and pulled Shelly into his arms. Although Shelly squirmed uncomfortably, there was not much resistance. As soon as Nox hugged her body, he felt an instinctive impulse to kiss Shelly and press his lips against hers.

In the beginning, it was like a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water, but slowly, he could not control himself anymore. As he deepened the kiss, his body started to react.

“Slap!”

In the room that was getting steamy, the sound of a slap suddenly caused the atmosphere in the room to instantly cool down.

Shelly stared at Nox, whose face had turned red, and was completely dumbfounded. In her sleep, she felt like there was a mosquito on her face, so she instinctively slapped it, wanting to kill it. However, she did not expect herself to slap Nox’s face instead.

At that moment, she instantly realized what Nox was doing, but she really did not slap him on purpose. She had never resisted when it came to satisfying Nox’s needs in bed, and she also knew that she could not resist, but tonight…

Just as she opened her mouth to explain, Nox said, “I’m sorry.”

Shelly’s heart skipped a beat, and it seemed to hurt a little. In the past, Nox would fly into a rage, but right now, Nox looked a little sad, as if he had been abandoned. Was it because the lights were too dim that she felt that Nox’s spirit had disappeared and that he had become powerless?

“Nox, I…” Shelly wanted to explain.

She really did dream of a big mosquito on her face. It was not her intention to attack him.

“I woke you up.” Nox interrupted her as if he did not want to listen to her explanation. “You should go to bed early.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As he spoke, Nox turned over and got off Shelly’s body. Then, he lay on the side with his back facing Shelly.

Shelly stared at Nox’s broad back and could tell that Nox was hurt and angry because of her rejection just now. She wanted to apologize, but she was deterred by Nox?s cold back. Perhaps Nox did not lose his temper right now because he was holding it in. Afraid that Nox would get angrier the more she said, she thought it would be better to… let it be.

Anyway, Nox would be fine in two days, and a man like Nox would never mull over it for more than three days. With that thought in mind, Shelly turned around and went to sleep with her back to Nox.

Nox could feel Shelly turning around. He was hoping that Shelly could reach out and hug him. Even if she did it reluctantly, he would be comforted. However, Shelly chose to turn her back on him and distance herself from him.

For a period of time, Nox and Shelly’s interactions were not much different from usual. The days were the same, with Shelly cooking and sending Bella to school while Nox would go to work from nine to five.

After that day, Nox did not cook or wash the dishes anymore. Everything he did that day seemed to be on a whim..
