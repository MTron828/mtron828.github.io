Shelly did not want to hear it, but she did not stop Monica.

Then, she heard Monica say, “He said since he can’t marry you, he can only propose to you to fulfill your wish back then. Back then, you wanted to marry him, but he didn’t agree. Now that he has agreed, it doesn’t matter whether you agree or not. He just wants to give you closure.”

“Actually, there was no need for him to do that.” Shelly’s voice was a little hoarse.

“I didn’t think it was necessary either. Jeannie and I tried to persuade him, but he refused to listen. He said that was the only thing he could think of to make up for his foolish behavior back then. If he didn’t do it, he would regret it for the rest of his life. Now, he can fulfill his wish and let you go to pursue your own happiness.”

Shelly did not know how to respond, so she remained silent.

Monica took a deep breath. “I won’t say anything else. Anyway, whether you want to be with Nox or not is your choice. If you really don’t love him, there’s no point in forcing it, and I believe Nox has really let go.”

Shelly nodded silently.

When the car arrived at the entrance of Nox’s apartment, Monica walked them out of the car. “We’ll still be friends in the future. Don’t let Nox affect our relationship.”

“Yes.” Shelly smiled.

“It’s getting late. You should go back and rest early.”

“You, too.”

“Goodbye, Bella.” Monica smiled at Bella.

Bella waved. “Goodbye, Aunty.”

With that, Shelly walked into the neighborhood with Bella in her arms.

Monica stared at Shelly’s back and sighed heavily. In the end, she still found it a pity that Nox and Shelly could not be together.

After returning to the car, she called Jeanne on the phone. “How are things on your end?”

“I’ve sent Nox back to the Winters’ residence.”

“Is he okay?” “He’s abnormally calm.”

“Has he let it go?”

“He doesn’t want others to see how sad he is.”

“Poor Nox.” Monica sighed.

“Everyone has to pay for what they did in the past. Anyway, no matter what, all Nox has to do is not provoke Shelly in the future.”

‘Yes.” Monica nodded. “He won’t want to make things difficult for each other again.”

“Alright, I’ll leave it at that.” Jeanne clutched her stomach. “I don’t know if it’S because I sat in the car for too long today, but my stomach feels a little uncomfortable. I’ll talk to you later.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded. The moment she hung up, she suddenly thought of something. “Jeannie, are you pregnant ”

However, Jeanne had hung up by then, and it rendered Monica speechless. She had not even finished speaking!

She put down her phone and looked at the starry sky. Tomorrow would be a new day, but unfortunately, it might never be the same for some people again!

After Nox’s proposal failed, he did not return to the neighborhood where he and Shelly lived. Shelly also started moving. She thought that since she had ended things with Nox, she should not have anything to do with Nox again.

While she was packing up, Bella was a little confused. “Mommy, are we moving?”

“Yeah. We’re going to move back to the place where Mommy and Bella used to live together, okay?”

“No.” Bella refused unhappily.

Shelly frowned. “What’s wrong?”

Bella was very emotional.

“I want to live with Dad. I don’t want to move away.”

“Be good. ” Shelly coaxed Bella. “Nox is no longer your father, so we won’t live together anymore.” ‘Why can’t he be my father? Why? Boohoo…” As she spoke, she started crying miserably.

Shelly hugged Bella and comforted her, “Bella, there are many things that children don’t understand. Let me put it this way: Nox and I don’t love each other, We’re only forced to be together, and we’re not happy. That’s why I don’t want to be with Nox anymore. When you grow up, you’ll know why I did it.”

“But it’s obvious that Daddy likes you so much. Why can’t you like Daddy?” Bella refused to give up. When she thought about how she could no longer live with her father, she was extremely sad. “A relationship can only last if feelings are mutual, and forcing it will only make us more unhappy.”

“But Mommy, you’re much happier now. I can see you have started to accept Daddy, but you just don’t want to admit it..”
