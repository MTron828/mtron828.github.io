Chapter 292: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

Nox was angry.

Even so, he told himself that he would not argue with a child.

After lunch, Edward put down his cutleries.

Nox was also full. He leaned against the chair and seemed to be very satisfied.

George ate slower and continued to eat silently.

He ate quite a lot.

This little devil was quite magnanimous.

He was kidnapped, yet he could still be so calm.

“I’m full.” George put down his cutleries.

His upbringing seemed to be quite good.

“Wash the dishes,” Edward suddenly said.

Nox was stunned.

George was also stunned at the moment.

“Wash the dishes,” Edward said again with a determined tone.

George was a little emotional.

Teddy quickly came back to his senses. “I’ll wash them, I’ll wash them.”

As Fourth Master Swan did not like to have many people around, other than a chef, there was only Teddy in the house.

Teddy did almost all the work in Bamboo Garden.

Not only did he clean the house, but he also did the laundry and mopped the floor. Could he also say that he was the gardener in the house?!

“George, wash the dishes,” Edward said again.

His tone was a little heavy.

This time, no one dared to say anything.

George looked straight at Edward.

Edward said, “If you stay with someone, you have to do your part. Washing dishes isn’t difficult for you.”

“He’s only six years old,” Nox reminded him.

‘He can’t even reach the sink.’

Edward gave him a look.

Nox surrendered.

He pretended that he did not say anything.

In any case, he abhorred evil as one did one’s enemy. If he did not vent his anger, he would not let the matter rest so easily.

At that moment, George also knew that he should do as he was told as he was living under someone else’s roof.

He got down from the chair and carried his plate and cutleries to the kitchen.

“Not just yours,” Edward continued to instruct him.

George bit his lip.

After putting down his plate and cutleries, he turned back and picked up the rest of the plates and cutleries on the table and placed them in the kitchen. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Then, he stood on tiptoe and started to wash the dishes.

Nox could not help but go over to look at him.

Edward also went over.

It was obvious that George did not know how to wash the dishes. He only knew how to rinse them with water. He washed them instinctively, but the grease could not be washed away no matter how hard he tried.

He washed everything in the sink for a long time.

Teddy could not stand it anymore. He could not help but remind George, “Little Master Lawrence, the dishwashing liquid is on the side.”

George was startled.

Then, when he saw the dishwashing liquid, he cleverly put the dishwashing liquid into the sink.

He squeezed a little too much.

Teddy wanted to say something, but he was stopped by Edward’s gaze.

For a moment, the sink was filled with foam.

A lot of foam.

Not only was there foam around the sink, but there was also foam on George’s body and the ground.

After washing for a long time, the dishes were finally done. George put the dishes aside obediently and prepared to leave.

“Wipe off the foam around you,” Edward instructed him again.

George was unhappy.

He was unhappy. He took the cloth that Teddy quietly handed to him.

George twisted the cloth and started to clean.

He wiped off the foam around him.

“On the ground as well,” Edward reminded him.

George squatted down again and wiped the ground.

After a long time, George finished.

Edward turned around. “Follow me upstairs.”

George was a little angry.

He put down the cloth angrily and followed behind the person in front of him.

Nox and Teddy watched them leave

Nox said meaningfully, “Teddy.”

“Young Master Winter.”

“Don’t you think that...”

“Huh?”

“Don’t you think that they looked like the abandoned father and son?”

“...” Teddy stared at Nox with wide eyes.

“I’m just guessing.” Nox smiled meaningfully.

At this moment, upstairs.

Edward brought George into the bathroom.

“Take a shower and change into clean clothes,” Edward instructed.

George was unhappy.

“If you’re staying at someone’s place, you should do as you’re told.”

‘I’ll surely leave,’ George thought to himself.

In fact, he knew that his mom would not leave him alone.

She had once said that she would never leave him unless he left her.

George only wanted to leave Fourth Master Swan’s place on his own.

He did not want to bring trouble to his mom.

George bit his lip and obediently took off his clothes. He walked into the bathroom and took a shower.

Edward just stood at the door.

He just looked at George.

Looking at George, he asked, “Does your mom often cook for you?”

The moment George lathered up, he paused and looked up at Fourth Master Swan. “She’ll cook for me when she’s free.”

“Is it good?” Edward asked.

“Yes.” George nodded.
