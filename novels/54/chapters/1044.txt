1045 If She Fails, She’ll Get Back Up Again

Everyone in the Hills knew that Mr. Thorn had disfigured Lucy because she disobeyed his orders.

Yet now, Lucy could still face Mr. Thorn and even violate his principles.

He was indeed too weak.

Kerby watched Lucy leave.

He really wanted to become as powerful as the top assassins of the Hills one day.

…

Lucy walked toward Kingsley’s room.

In the half-closed room, the scene inside was indescribable.

Lucy waited at the door for Kingsley to finish, and she waited for a long time.

Kingsley had never been weak in that aspect.

...

After it ended, the female assassin left Kingsley’s room. When she saw Lucy at the door, she immediately became very respectful.

After all, no matter how serious the scars on Lucy’s face were, Millie did die in Lucy’s hands. Hence, no one dared to take advantage of her or provoke her.

Lucy did not show the female assassin any expression as she walked straight into Kingsley’s room.

The female assassin left tactfully.

In the room, Kingsley was in the bathroom.

Lucy waited for a while before Kingsley came out naked, with water still dripping from his body.

“Wipe me down,” Kingsley ordered.

Lucy took the towel from Kingsley’s hand and wiped him clean.

After she was done, Kingsley lay on the bed and smoked a cigarette.

“What’s the matter?” Kingsley asked her.

His expression did not change as he looked at her face.

...

Lucy did not try to hide from Kingsley despite her disfigured face. Just like before, she faced him calmly.

She said, “It’s about Kerby.”

Kingsley’s hand paused.

“I’ve seen Kerby’s results in the assassin training camp and a few of his missions. I think he’ll be K01’s successor,” Yu Jia kept talking.

“And?” Kingsley asked.

It may seem like Kingsley did not know much about the Hills’ internal affairs, but he was aware of the level of every assassin.

That was especially true for newcomers like Kerby, who had the potential to grow and attract his attention.

“But because you wanted to castrate him, he’s now emotionally unstable. It’s very dangerous for an assassin.”

“So you’re educating me?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I wouldn’t dare,” Lucy replied respectfully. “I’m just thinking from the perspective of the Hills and want to cherish our talents. K01 is already 29 years old, and the golden age for an assassin is between 24 and 30 years old. Once K01 passes the age of 30, we have to train new people. Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to establish ourselves in the assassin world.”

“Do you think Kerby can replace K01?” Kingsley was still smoking.

...

She could not tell what he was feeling.

“Yes. I’m confident, and so is K01.”

“Just tell me what you want!” Kingsley did not seem to want to beat around the bush with Lucy.

However, it was undeniable that Lucy was an expert in negotiation.

She would never tell him her motive so abruptly and directly. She would first tell him what he was interested in so that he had no reason to refuse her.

“Kerby is having some problems with his body, so I’m requesting for a few skilled female assassins to let him try and help him recover and adjust.” Naturally, Lucy could not beat around the bush.

If she continued to waste Kingsley’s time, he would be disgusted.

“Aren’t you the most skilled female assassin?” Kingsley said bluntly.

Lucy looked at him.

“You can help Kerby recover,” Kingsley ordered.

Lucy hesitated a little before she said, “I’m disfigured now.”

...

“Lucy, I thought you understood men very well.”

She did not understand men at all. If she did, she would not have gotten hurt.

“Men don’t care about looks.” Kingsley said, “As long as you have a good figure and good skills, your face is secondary.”

“Alright.” Since Kingsley said so, so be it.

Suddenly, Kingsley got up from the bed and walked to Lucy without wearing anything.

He then reached his hand out and lifted Lucy’s face. His sinister eyes stared straight at her disfigured face.

Lucy was still a little uncomfortable under Kingsley’s gaze.

She was making herself accept her disfigured face, but now, with Kingsley staring at her like that, she still felt embarrassed.
