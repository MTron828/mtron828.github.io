No one could say anything more. Even if Henry’s family had suffered a great “grievance”, they could only do so!

If Old Master Swan wanted to protect someone, no one could go against him.

Yet, under such circumstances, Belle decided to resist.

She roared at Old Master Swan, “I’m a woman, and I really don’t know anything about career. I also don’t care who is in power in the family. Is Edward so outstanding that the Swans can’t survive without him? All I know is that now that my grandson is gone, so Edward and Jeanne must take responsibility. Otherwise, even if I die in the Swans, I will get justice!”

Old Master Swan’s face darkened.

Belle continued saying, “Why? I don’t have a grandson anymore. Why should they be protected like this because they did something wrong? Why?”

“Because you have no evidence!” Old Master Swan scolded her, “If you have evidence, you can do anything!”

“You’re protecting Edward and Jeanne because I have no evidence? Dad, I don’t care anymore. At most, you can ask Henry to divorce me, but today, I will not let this matter go! If you don’t deal with Edward and Jeanne today, I will immediately go out and gather the reporters. I’ll have all the media in Harken expose this scandal of ours. I don’t care what happens to the Swans in the end, but I only seek justice!”

“If you dare, go ahead and do it!” Old Master Swan was not threatened at all.

Belle said fiercely, “I will definitely do it!”

Nevertheless, Old Master Swan remained indifferent. Then, he stood up and was about to leave.

Belle looked at Old Master Swan’s reaction and broke down. She roared angrily, “Dad, Edward can’t have a child. If you do this, your way of doing things will only make the Swans lose their descendants. Even if you die, no one will be at your funeral!”

Old Master Swan’s expression was grim as he looked at Belle’s vicious expression.

......

His gaze tensed.

This time, she had really angered Old Master Swan.

Everyone was shocked by his reaction.

In fact, after Belle said it, she was also shocked by herself at that moment. However, on second thought, she could not let that matter go so easily. In any case, she had to get justice for herself, so she did not care. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She refused to believe that Old Master Swan could kill her, no matter how powerful he was!

She did not understand why everyone in the Swans was so afraid of Old Master Swan. Was it not just for the Swans’ assets?

Was it not obvious that the assets of the Swans would belong to Edward in the future?

Since that was the case, why did they have to be worried?

She stared fiercely at Old Master Swan. Then, she saw Wade, who was beside Old Master Swan, walking directly toward her.

With a bam, Wade slapped Belle to the ground.

Belle was slapped so hard that her vision went black. For a second, she felt like she was going to die from the pain.

When she fell to the ground, she touched her face and could not react in time.

At that moment, everyone else in the hall was stunned by the scene in front of them.

For so many years, no one had dared to provoke Old Master Swan for him to make such a move!

Even more so, no one dared to speak.

Even if Belle was beaten up, Henry and Eden, who were her husband and son, as well as Jasmine, who she wanted to seek justice for, did not dare to move. They suddenly acted like deaf-mutes, pretending to be dumb!

Wade’s face was cold. “How dare you offend Old Master Swan!”

More than half of Belle’s face was red and swollen as she glared fiercely at Wade. Probably because she was so angry, she lost control and roared at Wade, “Who do you think you are? Aren’t you just a dog by Old Master Swan’s side? What right do you have to hit me? You dog...”

Wade’s expression did not look pleasant.

Just as Wade was about to make a move again, Henry hurriedly went over and shouted at Belle, “Enough! Are you crazy? How dare you say that about my father?!”

Henry had finally seen through the situation.

He knew that no matter how much they pestered Old Master Swan, the latter would still protect Edwardi.

Other than enduring that anger, what else could he do?

“I’m not crazy. You’re the ones who are crazy! It’s you cowardly Swans. You parasites! You don’t even have the guts to resist him for treating you like this. Why don’t you resist?” Belle shouted crazily, “Edward can’t have children. If all of you leave, the Swans will have no future, and Zachary Swan will regret it!”
