1337 An Encounter at Dinner and Finn’s Outburst

Finn witnessed the trace of worry on Monica’s face. He then gave a slow nod before saying, “Okay.”

Brandon vomited for a long time before he felt a little better. Monica went to pour him a glass of warm water to rinse his mouth. She found a towel from the dining room and asked him to wipe his face.

Finn watched as Monica took good care of Brandon.

“Brandon, are you feeling better?” Monica asked with concern.

Brandon nodded and Monica felt at ease.

His stomach felt a little better, but his head was still dizzy. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Then I’ll help you up,” Monica said as she helped Brandon up from the toilet bowl.

Originally, Finn had promised to help, but at this moment, he could only watch on coldly.

Monica seemed to have forgotten about asking Finn for help.

Brandon stood up. Suddenly, he lost his balance and fell on top of Monica. Monica almost fell to the ground with him.

She quickly hugged Brandon. The two of them were entangled in a very intimate position.

Finn just continued looking on coldly.

“Monica,” Brandon murmured in a coquettish tone. “I think I’m drunk.”

“You’re totally wasted,” Monica said angrily as she struggled to support his body.

“So I’m drunk. No wonder my head feels so dizzy and uncomfortable.”

“Who asked you to tank the alcohol for me? Your alcohol tolerance is low. How can you have the cheek to drink on my behalf?”

“Because I care for you?” Brandon said in a daze. “I was afraid that you’d feel uncomfortable when you’re drunk, so I’d rather suffer myself. Monica, I really feel terrible…”

“Alright, alright. You’re a grown man. Why are you acting so coy?” Monica was speechless. “I’ll send you back now. You’ll be fine after a good night’s sleep.”

“Oh,” Brandon replied. He murmured, “Monica, I want to sleep at your house…”

Monica did not take Brandon seriously but merely a younger brother who was acting spoiled with her.

She tried her best to hold Brandon upright and help him out.

She suddenly felt a powerful force pulling Brandon away from her.

Monica was stunned. Then, she saw Finn dragging Brandon out. It was so fast and so strong. Brandon was being dragged away by Finn’s brute force.

Monica quickly followed.

Did Finn not know that drunk people should be handled gently?!

It was obvious that Brandon was extremely uncomfortable at this moment. He said in a daze, “Monica, slow down. I’m dizzy. I want to vomit…”

This fellow thought that Monica was the one supporting him. Monica could not help but say to Finn, “Slow down, he’s drunk.”

Finn did not seem to hear her. Without stopping, he dragged Brandon to the entrance of the restaurant. The receptionist at the entrance looked at them and hurriedly went forward to ask, “Sir, do you need help?”

“Get me a car.”

“Yes.” The receptionist quickly agreed and went to call for a car.

Right then, Brandon seemed to be unable to hold it in anymore. He pushed Finn away and leaned against the wall.

“Blergh!” He spat it out again. He felt extremely uncomfortable vomiting.

Monica was speechless. Just how much did this guy drink tonight?

She quickly called for the receptionist again. “Get me a glass of water.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

The staff later handed Monica a glass of water. Monica passed it to Brandon. “Drink some water.”

After throwing up, Brandon felt a little better. He turned to look at Monica and she looked aggrieved.

“Monica, I feel terrible.”

“Don’t drink like this next time if you’re feeling uncomfortable.” There was a hint of coaxing in Monica’s tone. “Come, drink the water and rinse your mouth.”

With that, Monica placed the glass of water beside Brandon’s mouth and fed him water.

After drinking the water, she used a napkin to wipe the corners of his mouth. She was taking care of him very attentively.

Finn was standing beside Monica and saw how well Monica treated Brandon.
