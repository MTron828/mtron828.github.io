Chapter 1398: Nox and Shelly Meet Again

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

“It’s so ugly!” Nox said in disgust, “You look uglier than your original face.”

“Everyone has a different level of appreciation.” Shelly appeared very calm. “And I quite like it.”

“All men hate women who have gone under the knife!” Nox said fiercely.

“I didn’t do it to make you like me. Besides…” Shelly swallowed the words she was about to say.

After all, Zoe had also gone under the knife, but she did not think it was necessary for her to sow discord between them.

However, Zoe’s plastic surgery was quite successful. If she had not bumped into Zoe when she went to the plastic surgery hospital for a follow-up, she would not have noticed that Zoe had done so much to her face.

She said, “I’m here for work now, so please cooperate with me.”

“I’m here to check on work. Why should I cooperate with you?” Nox was very aggressive, and his bad temper was showing.

Shelly could not understand it. They had not seen each other for a few years, but why were they still quarreling when they met?

Was he only gentle and patient to Zoe and no one else?

“I just hope you don’t mix up your personal feelings with work.”

“I’m the boss. Do I need you to teach me how to do things?!”

Shelly felt that she could not communicate with Nox. Therefore, it was a wise choice for her to leave the Winters back then

She said, “If you don’t want me to be your tour guide, I can immediately get someone else to take you around. I don’t want my personal reasons to affect your acceptance of this project.”

With that, Shelly turned around and left. She did not want to waste her breath on Nox as she thought it was useless.

Just as she walked away, Nox grabbed Shelly’s arm. Shelly winced and endured it.

“Do your work!” Nox ordered.

Did that mean Nox wanted her to continue?

She pursed her lips.

Although she was a little surprised, she did not think there was anything to be surprised about.

No matter what Nox did, he never did things according to common sense.

Shelly took a deep breath and smiled professionally. “Mr. Winter, this way please.”

Nox glanced at Shelly, waved his hand, and walked in front angrily. Seeing that, Shelly followed behind.

As Nox walked, Shelly kept talking. To be honest, Shelly did not even know if Nox heard her. In any case, she had told him everything she was trained to do on a tour.

Whether Nox was satisfied or not, she did not care since she had tried her best. At worst, Nox would complain about her, and she would be fired. With that thought in mind, she walked around the island with Nox.

It took them more than two hours to return to the starting point, where everyone was waiting for them.

Seeing Nox return with a dark face, Danny was frightened again. He quickly looked at Shelly.

Shelly, on the other hand, did not know what kind of look she should give her boss. In fact, she felt that she should be praying for herself.

When Danny saw Shelly’s gaze, a chill ran down his back. He trembled as he asked, “Mr. Winter, look-”

“Her professionalism is not bad,” Nox said bluntly.

When he said that, Shelly was shocked because she thought Nox did not even hear what she said.

“But her image won’t do,” Nox said coldly.

Shelly knew that she could not expect anything from Nox.

Danny smiled awkwardly. At that moment, he could not help but retort in a low voice, “Shelly’s image is not bad. She’s considered the best guide among us…”

Nox looked over, and Danny stopped talking.

Nox said without any hesitation, “Is an artificial face good-looking?”

Stunned, Danny could not help but glance at Shelly. In fact, everyone looked at Shelly, who felt a little embarrassed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Of course, she did not deliberately hide that she had undergone plastic surgery, but she did not go so far as to tell everyone that she had undergone plastic surgery either.

Now that it was said in public, it would still be a little embarrassing.

“Um…” Danny said, “Ordinary people wouldn’t be able to tell. Shelly’s face looks so natural that even I couldn’t tell.”

“I could.” Nox was being unreasonable.

Danny really did not know what to say. He felt that Nox was deliberately making things difficult for him by nitpicking on things.

“But Shelly is the best tour guide in terms of looks and professionalism…” Danny really did not want to fire her.

“So are all your tour guides this standard?”

“There’s no need to make things difficult for my boss.” Shelly could not stand it anymore. She said, “I didn’t meet Mr. Winter’s requirements, so I’ll resign.”.
