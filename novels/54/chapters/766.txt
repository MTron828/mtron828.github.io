As if she had thought of something sad, Jenifer’s tears fell even harder.

“I didn’t expect Jeanne to frame Joshua, her younger brother, like that. I can’t believe she... set Joshua up to harass Ms. Sanders!” Jenifer became upset. She looked as if she had never expected it to happen and could not accept it. “Joshua is indeed not as capable as Jeanne. All these years, I’ve also felt inferior compared to Jeanne. She always looks down on Joshua, and recently, Joshua has basically been a decoration in Lawrence Enterprise. Joshua is at the lowest point of his life, and it’s been hard on him.”

“So, when Jeanne suddenly said that she could return Lawrence Enterprise to him and that she would return the company to him if he managed to win Ms. Sanders’ heart, Joshua was tempted. Jeanne said that Ms. Sanders is very capable and could help Joshua manage the Lawrence Enterprise. That way, she can leave Lawrence Enterprise without worry.” Jenifer’s tears continued to flow as she said, “Joshua has been wanting to please Jeanne since he was young, so he naturally listened to Jeanne. In fact, he too liked Ms. Sanders, but because he knew she had a fiancé, he hid his feelings and never thought of doing anything to Ms. Sanders. He just watched from afar and admired her ability to work, not expecting Jeanne to ask him to pursue Ms. Sanders out of the blue. She even said that he could compete fairly for Ms. Sanders’ hand if she was not engaged.”

“Joshua couldn’t resist Jeanne’s persuasion, so he did it.” Jenifer continued, “But it’s obvious that Ms. Sanders doesn’t have feelings for Joshua. Every time Joshua tried to get close to her, Ms. Sanders would reject him. Joshua decided to give up, so he told Jeanne that he couldn’t do it anymore and that he didn’t want to ruin Ms. Sanders’ relationship. Then, Jeanne incited Joshua to use illegal means to deal with Ms. Sanders, saying that a woman’s reputation was the most important thing. As long as Joshua slept with Ms. Sanders, Ms. Sanders would be with him.”

Everyone present was so shocked that they could not say a word.

“I don’t know why Joshua fell for her words, but he really…” Jenifer choked a few times as if she could not speak. She tried her best to control her emotions and said, “Last night, Joshua drugged Ms. Sanders and brought her to the hotel. Who would’ve known that it was all part of Jeanne’s scheme? She wanted Joshua to listen to her and harass Ms. Sanders while she secretly sent people to rescue Ms. Sanders. She wanted Joshua to bear the brunt of the blame and the punishment of the law so that she could get all of Joshua’s shares. Not only that, but she also did Ms. Sanders a huge favor by saving her.”

“Do you have any evidence?” A more rational reporter asked, “You’ve said so much, but you don’t have any evidence. How can you prove that Jeanne planned everything?”

“I have evidence.” Jenifer enunciated every word.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Jenifer said, “This is a video recording that I took from the hotel.”

The staff member had given it to her.

It was a video from the hotel corridor. In the video, Finn and Miles showed up and kicked open the hotel door in a frenzy. It looked like they were trying to save Quinn.

The video was very short.

Then, Jenifer said, “The people in the video are Finn and Miles. All of you should’ve heard of Finn before. This man is the director of the cardiology department of South Hampton City Central Hospital. He is young and has a bright future ahead of him. Moreover, his status is not limited to that. He’s also Fourth Master Swan’s personal doctor. In other words, Finn and Fourth Master Swan have a close relationship. The other is Miles, a private chauffeur that Jeanne specially hired for George. He’s a chauffeur but also acts as a bodyguard. To put it bluntly, these two people are related to Jeanne.”

“What are you trying to say, Mrs. Lawrence?”

“If Joshua wanted to plot against Ms. Sanders, why did Jeanne send someone to rescue Ms. Sanders the moment the incident happened? If Jeanne didn’t know about it in advance, how could Joshua have been discovered? From what I know, Ms. Sanders has always had bodyguards. How could Joshua have escaped from the bodyguards’ sight but get discovered by Jeanne? This doesn’t make sense. The only possibility is that Jeanne knew about this long ago and that she’s trying to divert our attention away from her.”
