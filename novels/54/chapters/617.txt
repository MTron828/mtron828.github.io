Chapter 618: How Could Finn Forget Me So Easily?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Do you want me to beat you to death?” Monica was so angry that she wanted to strangle Sarah.

“I have the freedom to love anyone I want. You have no right to stop me from being with Finn.” Sarah did not care about Monica’s feelings at all.

“Y-Y-You...” Monica was so angry that she could not speak.

“I’ll treat Finn a hundred times better than you treated him!” Sarah said and quickly ran to Gary and Ruby’s side. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Then, she even deliberately said to Gary, “Monica is over there!”

Gary was originally chatting happily with Jeanne, but when he heard Sarah, he immediately shot her a murderous look.

Monica was smart enough to leave the hall with her crutches.

Even though walking was a struggle, she ran and almost fell.

She took a deep breath and leaned against a pillar in the courtyard outside the hall to rest.

She wondered if Sarah had a grudge against her in her past life because, in this life, Sarah had gone against her in every way.

Sarah even said she liked Finn.

F*ck. To think Sarah could like someone. Had she even gone through puberty yet?

After carefully thinking about it, Monica thought Sarah was growing pretty nicely.

However, it made Monica seethe with anger. Although she did not think Finn would be out of his mind to get together with Sarah because the age difference between the two was 12 years, she still felt inexplicably distressed.

She did not think Finn had great charm. In fact, she had always felt that with Finn’s personality, very few people other than her would like him.

Patsy did not count since she was, at most, a childhood friend.

Anyway, other than her and Patsy, no one else would like Finn!

However, the nurses at the Central Hospital once told her, “Monica, you’re really too innocent and stupid.”

In Central Hospital, Dr. Jones was like a Prince Charming!

Not to mention, Prince Charming was divorced now. Even back when he was married, there were still little witches stirring up trouble.

It was just that Dr. Jones made himself clear, so no one dared to provoke him.

Monica panted as she was in deep thought.

Suddenly, she choked on a few mouthfuls of smoke.

She could not help but cough twice and turn her head to look at the person smoking beside her.

As soon as she took a look, her heart skipped a few beats.

Finn also saw Monica and was holding a cigarette in his hand.

The two of them looked at each other for a second before Finn left.

“Finn,” Monica called out to him.

However, Finn ignored her.

Monica gritted her teeth and quickly used her crutches to block Finn’s path.

Finn looked at her, and she said, “Do you really not like me?”

Finn did not answer her, but that damned silence meant he tacitly agreed.

“Can’t we just talk to each other nicely? How can I explain myself so that you’ll believe me?” Monica was a little anxious and a little angry.

“There’s no need for you to explain.” That was because he would not believe her anymore.

Finn’s tone was icy.

Monica was starting to break down. “Finn, can you not be so petty? I really am helping Michael. After this is over, I’ll come back...”

By then, Finn had already walked passed Monica and left.

Monica stood rooted to the ground, her heart aching in pain.

Could Finn not treat her like that?

It had not been easy for her lately. She even had insomnia every day. The moment she closed her eyes, she would think of him.

She wondered if she really hurt him.

“Finn, I will forget about the fact you hired a prostitute that day,” Monica shouted at his back.

Finn’s throat moved.

“I understand you need to solve your physical needs, okay?” Monica really humbled herself.

Only God knew how much pain she felt every time she thought about Finn sleeping with another woman. It was as if countless ants were biting her heart, making her go crazy, but she had to endure it.

She thought that was probably the feeling of living a life worse than death.

Finally, Finn turned to look at Monica, who was staring at him with reddened eyes.

She said, “With this matter of me helping Michael, let’s just call it even, okay?”

“Monica, we’re divorced.” Finn’s indifference and Monica’s anticipation formed a sharp contrast.

“But–”

“I don’t need your understanding to have sex with any other woman, and you don’t need to care about it, let alone call it even.” Finn’s harsh words could really hurt her heart. “Please take note of your identity.”
