Chapter 279: You’re Destined Not to Leave Me Again

“When can you be honest with me?” Edward asked Jeanne.

He asked her seriously.

Jeanne smiled and answered him directly, “Not at any time.”

There was an obvious change on Fourth Master Swan’s face.

“So you should stay away from me.” Jeanne still had a smile on her face.

“I won’t be far away.” Edward moved his face closer to Jeanne.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Despite that, she could not break free.

“From the moment you returned to South Hampton City, Ms. Lawrence, you’re destined not to leave me again.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

So, from the very beginning, she was targeted by this big shot.

Kingsley said that Jeanne wanted to be entangled with Fourth Master Swan. It was clear that she did not do anything; Fourth Master Swan was the one with ulterior motives.

Jeanne wanted to record this message to Kingsley to prove her innocence.

“I’ve always been curious—why did you fall in love with me? If it’s just because I slept with you seven years ago and made you unable to forget me, it’s too melodramatic!” Jeanne was really curious.

Even though there was some sarcasm in her tone.

“If I were to say yes, would you regret having looked for me back then, Ms. Lawrence?”

“Yes, very much,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

When the man in front of her heard her gritting her teeth, not only did he not get angry, but he also smiled. Next, Jeanne felt that Fourth Master Swan’s body became closer to hers.

Jeanne seemed to have felt the aggressive nature of the man in front of her in an instant. It was very strong.

“I want you, Ms. Lawrence,” Edward said. He was talking like a hooligan but in an attractive voice. Even so, due to his stunning face, it sounded like he was saying something sweet, so much so that one would fall in love with him.

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan. She looked as he pointed at her chest with his slender fingers.

Edward pointed at her chest, at her heart.

He said in a deep voice, “I also want... your heart.”

Ba-dump, ba-dump.

Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.

Jeanne could no longer remember how many times her heart had beaten faster in front of Fourth Master Swan.

It was very easy for her heart to beat faster after hearing what he said.

Jeanne looked straight at Edward.

She looked at his desire.

It was so obvious.

Nevertheless, he turned around and left.

Edward left her.

He did not do anything to her.

At this moment, Jeanne felt a little... disappointed.

After he left her, she felt a sudden sense of disappointment.

It was like... she felt empty because what she thought would happen next did not happen.

Jeanne watched Fourth Master Swan leave.

She looked at his tall figure and broad shoulders.

She suddenly ran over.

She ran over and hugged Fourth Master Swan’s back.

It was a study back that gave people a sense of security.

The man who was being hugged suddenly tensed up.

He stood there stiffly, not moving at all.

He could feel that his back was being hugged tightly.

Edward heard Jeanne asking him from behind, “Have the wounds on your back healed, Fourth Master?”

Jeanne had previously seen the whip marks all over his back.

She guessed that they should be almost healed.

After all, the wounds on her body had healed a lot.

Edward said in a lowered voice, “Ms. Lawrence, you can see it yourself.”

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

She agreed and let go of Fourth Master Swan.

Then, she lifted Fourth Master Swan’s clothes.

It was a soft blue t-shirt. The t-shirt was very loose, but one could still vaguely see the outline of Fourth Master Swan’s muscles, which were so defined that it made one’s nose bleed.

Jeanne looked at the whip marks on his body, which had all turned into calluses. They were still so obvious, but they had completely healed.

She used her hand to gently touch his back and asked, “Does it hurt?”

“No.”

“So... can we?” Jeanne asked.

The man whose back was facing her turned around to look at her and whispered in her ear. His voice was very, very gentle…

Nonetheless, she was incredibly shy when she heard his words.

Edward leaned closer to her face.

He looked at her especially red face.

“Do you mean this?” Edward asked her. His voice was so deep that it could not be any lower.

It was as if he was enduring.

He was enduring, and his Adam’s apple kept rolling up and down.

Jeanne suddenly felt that it was so sexy.

She wrapped her arms around Fourth Master Swan’s neck.

Edward’s body moved slightly.

“No,” Jeanne answered.

Her female voice was pleasant to the ear.

The expression on Edward’s face had obviously changed.

He would probably be disappointed just like she did a while ago.

That said, he was not angry.

He was just... restraining herself.

He was trying her best to restrain herself.

Jeanne stood on her tiptoes and moved closer to Fourth Master Swan’s ear.

She did not know why this man liked to bite her ear so much. She just wanted to give it a try and see what it felt like to bite someone’s ear. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Hence, she opened her mouth and bit his earlobe.

She breathed hot air into his ear.

As a result, someone’s ear... instantly turned red.

Jeanne suddenly smiled.

It turned out that she was not the only one whose ear would turn red when being bitten. It was an instinctive response.

Jeanne said, “Didn’t I just promise you that I’ll do it next time?”

A certain someone seemed to be stunned.

She said with hot breath, “One shouldn’t go back on one’s words, so I should return the favor...”

Next, her body was lifted by the waist.

Jeanne’s heart moved.

She hugged Fourth Master Swan’s neck tightly, afraid that she would suddenly fall.

She was carried upstairs by Fourth Master Swan, who pushed open the door to his room.

Then, they lay on the same bed.

The two people looked at each other.

However, they did not move.

Neither of them took the initiative. They just stayed there…

It lasted for a long time.

Jeanne thought her hint was obvious.

Could it be that…

Men would like women who were more proactive?!

Jeanne let go of her hands from Edward’s neck and caressed his face.

Bit by bit, she seemed to be drawing his outline.

In her memory, the first time she met Fourth Master Swan was when her mom passed away.

At that time, many people went to pay their respects.

Fourth Master Swan had been very famous since he was young. After all, Old Master Swan had placed too much importance on him, causing the upper-class society in the city to speak highly of him. It was said that he had been very capable since he was young and had extraordinary talent. He was far inferior to his brothers in the family. Even so, very few people really knew how capable Fourth Master Swan was, and in which aspect. It was to the extent that his mysteriousness made others more curious about him, and it also made people pay more attention to him.

At that time, it was also because of this that Jeanne took a few glances at him.

She was very upset during that time.

Her mom’s sudden death had dealt her the biggest blow in her life for the first time, and she could not accept it.

During those days, she cried so hard that she almost broke down. She was completely immersed in her own sad world and did not pay any attention to the outside world.

It was until she met Fourth Master Swan

Jeanne heard someone say back then. “Is that the legendary Fourth Master Swan? He looks so noble and elegant! He doesn’t look like a 12-year-old child.”

She was only eight years old then.

Hence, she still had the curiosity of a child.

She was a little curious about the “Fourth Master Swan” that everyone was talking about.

So she looked up and saw the legendary person for the first time.

Edward was wearing a black suit, and his hair was combed very neatly. It was the kind of hairstyle that only became popular now. He looked very spirited and handsome. His facial features were very stunning. He was the best-looking person Jeanne had seen. He was much better looking than her. One would not be able to take one’s eyes off him at a glance! Fourth Master Swan was only 12 years old at that time, but he did not look childish at all. Moreover, he was already close to 170 cm tall at the age of 12. Jeanne remembered that when she was 8 years old, she was less than 130 cm tall. At that time, she felt that Fourth Master Swan was unreachable.

It was as if the big shot whom Jeanne would never be able to get in contact with in her life was in a completely different world from her.

In fact, at that time, Fourth Master Swan did not spare her a glance.

He followed his brothers and paid respects to Jeanne’s mother. After the funeral, he left coldly.

That was true.

At that time, Jeanne met Eden, who was the same age as her.

Eden was also with Fourth Master Swan. He followed behind them. After the members of the Swans left, he suddenly ran to Jeanne and held her hands.

He said, “Your mom has passed away, but don’t be afraid. From now on, I’ll be your friend. I’ll protect you.”

It was probably what he said at that special time that moved Jeanne!
