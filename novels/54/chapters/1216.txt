1217 Edward Has Done His Best, He Had No Choice

Who would have thought that when she woke up, the entire situation in Harken had changed?

The Sanders… were completely annihilated, including Jeanne Sanders.

She had only found out that Jeanne had disappeared a long time after she was discharged from the hospital.

At that time, she did not really believe the rumors that all the Sanders members had been burned to death in the fire and that Jeanne had died just like that. Later, as more rumors spread, the news became true. In the end, seeing that she really could not contact Jeanne, she asked Finn.

Finn tacitly agreed.

At that moment, it was hard to describe her grief over Jeanne’s death.

She knew that Jeanne’s life was in dire straits and that something might happen to her. However, what she did not know was that something did happen to Jeanne.

She did not know how she accepted it later on. Moreover, so what if she did not accept it? If she did not accept it, would Jeanne still be alive?

She had already died once, and her family had finally reunited.

Now that she had finally found the happiness she had been looking forward to, she was afraid of crying too loudly. Now, she really treasured everything she had now. She was really afraid that everything she had now would disappear in the blink of an eye. Therefore, she could only… silently accept Jeanne’s death day by day.

It had been more than three months, and she had probably accepted it by now. That was why she was so calm when she saw Edward’s arm being held by another woman.

She believed that time was perhaps the cruelest weapon. It could really make two people who loved each other so much forget each other.

“Do you want to go over?” Finn asked Monica.

Monica’s eyes flickered.

Finn had probably misunderstood because she had been looking at Fourth Master Swan for too long.

She shook her head. “Forget it. I’m afraid we’ll start fighting on the spot.”

Finn smiled faintly.

The current Monica would no longer be as reckless as before. Even when she found out that Jeanne had ‘passed away’, she only nodded silently with tears in her eyes.

Many people were coming and going into the hall where the state banquet was held, and Monica knew some of them but not all of them. Those she had interacted with before and those she had never met were all socializing.

In the beginning, Finn had been accompanying her. However, because their social circles were too different and there was no common topic, Finn left silently later on.

After Finn left, Monica seemed to be more at ease by herself.

Finn just stood in the corner and watched indifferently. He had never thought that Monica would one day shine so brightly.

Halfway through the banquet, the lights in the hall suddenly dimmed. Everyone’s eyes were focused on the light in the center of the hall.

Seeing that Alex was standing there, the audience burst into a warm round of applause.

He bowed to everyone in a gentlemanly manner, appearing very polite. Then, he took the microphone and gave an official speech.

He was neither arrogant nor humble. He was mature and reserved, and his speech was deep and meaningful.

When the speech ended, a faint smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

His sincere smile would not make people think that he was too frivolous, nor would they think that he was just being perfunctory.

Monica could not help but sigh.

That was probably the most handsome and dignified person in the history of Harken’s Leaders! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Most importantly, he was young and promising, and his wife had just died. She wondered how many socialites and upper-class ladies would want to marry him.

While she was thinking about that, she heard him say, “Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to announce something happen.”

Everyone was looking at him.

She was attracted to him.

“My sister, Susan, and Edward have officially gotten engaged today. They will be holding their wedding at the beginning of next year.” Alex’s tone was a little high as if he was happy.

As soon as he said that, there was another round of applause.

Although Monica was also among the crowd, she did not clap. Instead, she looked on as Edward held the woman’s hand and walked under the light, accepting everyone’s blessings.

In this world, nothing seemed to last forever.

Monica turned around and left the banquet hall.

She had come today because she received the invitation and could not be disrespectful to the new Leader by rejecting his invitation.

However, her leaving halfway through now was because… she could not resist what he saw. Thus, she could only choose to leave even though it was a little embarrassing.

She sat in the car and looked at the palace that was getting further and further away from her.

She thought, ‘It has only been four months since Jeanne died, yet the man she had loved for so long has already left her.’

However, it was not Fourth Master Swan’s fault.

From Fourth Master Swan’s perspective, Jeanne had passed away, and the Leader had betrothed his sister to him. No matter what, he could not refuse.

She sat in the car and only found out after receiving the call that she had forgotten about Finn.

She was not the one to ask Finn to come with her to the banquet today. It was Finn who had asked her if she would be attending tonight’s banquet, and that was why she asked him if he wanted to come along.

Then, Finn agreed.

In fact, what kind of relationship had they been in for the past three months?

Occasionally, they would call each other and have a meal together. After that, everyone would return to their respective homes.

Other than the kiss they shared the day Finn said that they should start again, they did not even hold hands. Sometimes, she would even forget that she had a boyfriend.

“I’m sorry. I’m not feeling well so I left early,” Monica apologized.

She could not tell him that she was afraid she would kill Fourth Master Swan, so she left first.

Finn and Fourth Master Swan had a close relationship.

...

In the past, she had never thought of caring about other people’s feelings. However, now that she had been socializing a lot, she knew that she should care about him if she could.

At the very least, it would not do her any harm by doing that

“You’ve left?” Finn had already walked out of the banquet hall at that moment.

The moment the lights were on and she was nowhere to be seen, he chased after her.
