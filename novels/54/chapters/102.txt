Chapter 103: I Agree to the Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Dr. Finn Jones did not reply.

“Forget it. You won’t listen to a word I say anyway. I’m going back to my room.” Monica said and got down from the bar chair.

After Monica left, Finn’s straight posture gave out and he slouched over.

He put down the bowl of noodles and held his stomach.

If it was not for the stomach pains, he would have forgotten that he had yet to eat anything the entire day.

At the moment, he did not have much of an appetite. He just wanted his stomach to feel better.

He endured it for a moment before picking up his utensils and eating again.

Lately, he seemed to be going through the motions of his daily life.

…

The next day.

Monica was still sleeping when she was woken up by the sound of a phone call.

She picked up the phone in a hurry and answered, “Hello.”

“It’s already past midnight and you’re still sleeping. Come back quickly. I have something to tell you!” Gary Cardellini’s angry voice came from the other side.

Monica Cardellini rubbed her messy hair and sat up from the bed. “Do you know what time it is?”

“Who cares about the time! Come back in half an hour!”

“I...”

The caller hung up.

Monica angrily threw her phone on the bed.

What’s wrong with the old man?

She had difficulty falling asleep last night as she’s been suffering from insomnia. She had no idea when she had fallen asleep. It was only seven o’clock in the morning. What the hell?!

Monica removed the blanket and got out of bed angrily. With a ferocious expression, she went to the bathroom to wash up and change her clothes. She did not even put on any makeup, and she tossed on a cap and a pair of sunglasses before leaving the house.

At the door, she happened to meet Finn, who was heading out for work.

Monica asked casually, “You got off work so late last night, and yet you’re going to work so early today?”

“I’m going to your house.”

Monica was stunned by the reply.

“Your father just called me.” Finn continued.

‘He must be telling my dad about our divorce!’ Monica thought excitedly. She grabbed Finn’s arm and said, “Let’s rehearse what we’ll say before we get there.”

Dr. Finn Jones looked at her hand.

Monica frowned and lowered her head as well.

“Let go.” Finn said.

Monica rolled her eyes.

They had even kissed that night, but now just holding his arm isn’t allowed?

She rolled her eyes and let go.

Dr. Finn put on his shoes and headed out as Monica followed.

The two of them arrived at the garage and Dr. Finn went straight to his car.

He opened the door and sat in the driver’s seat.

Monica hesitated for a moment before she took the shotgun seat.

He glanced at her.

Monica said, “Let’s talk about how we’re going to bring it up to my dad on our way there.”

Eitherway, she was getting a divorce. It would be best if there were fewer disputes.

In the end, she still didn’t want to destroy her relationship with her father as she still had to rely on him to support her.

Dr. Finn started the car and drove on the highway at a relaxed pace.

Monica would sometimes get anxious when she saw how Finn drove.

Who would have thought that there would be a man who drove even slower than her?

She endured his driving skills and decided not to waste time on unimportant matters. Going straight to the point, she said, “My dad definitely doesn’t want us to get a divorce. I admit that getting back together with Micheal is one thing, but the most important thing is that we don’t have any feelings for each other. Even though you’ve asked me to get back together with you, it feels like you’re just asking for the sake of it. After all, I’m quite the catch—my background, looks and all. You felt that it’s a pity to divorce me, isn’t it?”

Dr. Finn focused on driving. HIs expression did not change, but he had a slight frown.

“Anyway, we’re going to get a divorce sooner or later. Rather than wasting time, we should do it quick. Once we settle the talk with my parents, we’ll go to the government office and get our divorce officialized.” Monica said anxiously.

Dr. Finn, who had been silent the whole time, said in a low voice, “How do you want me to cooperate with you?”

‘B*stard, so you actually wanted a divorce as well!’ Monica thought.

Monica shifted in her seat and sat up straight. She said, “We’ll just insist that our relationship wasn’t good and that we aren’t compatible. After being together for so long, we no longer have any intentions of living with each other. We’re both unhappy in this marriage and it would feel suffocating to continue living together. And eventually it’ll drive us crazy.”

Dr. Finn tightened his grip on the steering wheel and said, “Okay.”

Monica added, “Anyway, look at me and wait for my signal.”

“Okay.” Finn replied.

“Dr. Finn Jones, do you want some compensation or something?” Monica suddenly asked.

He turned to look at her.

“What I mean is, you weren’t the one who wanted us to get married back then. It was my dad who forced you. Now that we’re getting a divorce, do you want anything?”

“What?”

“Any assets or alimony.” Monica said cautiously, afraid of hurting his pride.

“There’s no need.” Dr. Finn rejected.

“Oh, come on. My family has a lot of money. Even though your doctor’s salary isn’t a small sum, you won’t be able to earn a fraction of my family’s assets in your lifetime. It won’t hurt for you to ask for something.”

“No.”

“Why are you so stubborn?” Monica Cardellini was speechless. “Forget it. I’ll ask my dad to transfer 20 million yuan to you. Since my dad likes you so much, he definitely won’t refuse.”

“I’ve said there’s no need!” Dr. Finn Jones retorted in a cold voice.

“Why are you so angry?” Monica said.

Dr. Finn tightened his hands on the steering wheel.

He was not a low-life that needed money to agree to the divorce.

There was silence again in the car.

Monica did not know why they had a fall out again.

‘It must be that we’re just not compatible with each other!’ Monica thought.

The car stopped at the Cardellinis’ family villa.

The two of them walked into the house, one after the other, all the while maintaining a distance between them.

Gary Cardellini and Ruby Harrison were already waiting for them in the living room.

Surprisingly, Monica’s cousin, Sarah Harrison, was also there.

“Why are you here?” Monica asked her cousin.

“It’s a weekend holiday. I’m here to visit Aunt and Uncle.”

“Aren’t you supposed to be busy in the third year of high school?” Monica frowned.

She didn’t like her cousin very much.

Sarah always acted like a good girl in front of her parents, which made Monica feel like she was adopted.

“No matter how busy I am, I have to come and visit Aunt Ruby! I love her so much that I miss her everyday!” As she spoke, she leaned intimately on Ruby Harrison.

Ruby was naturally doting on her only niece and she gave Sarah a hug.

Monica rolled his eyes. “You two must be biological mother and daughter. I must’ve been adopted.”

“Hehe.” Sarah smiled triumphantly. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I was also wondering if I took back the wrong kid from the hospital! Why must you always anger me?!” Gary suddenly spoke.

Monica sat on the sofa, annoyed.

Dr. Finn Jones was also seated there, but they had some distance from each other.

“I called you back because I want to talk to you both about your marriage,” Gary said.

Monica knew that her father wanted them here to talk about the matter.

She said straightforwardly, “Finn and I have already thought this through. We don’t have any feelings between us. We no longer wish to be a burden to each other.”

“Did I say you can speak?” Gary was furious.

Monica was sullen.

“Finn, what are your thoughts?” Gary asked Dr. Finn.

His voice was not gentle, but it had a friendly tone.

In comparison, he treated her like an enemy.

Dr. Finn Jones was silent.

Monica turned her head and looked at him nervously. She winked at him.

He looked at Monica anxiously.

Finally, he said, “I agree to the divorce.”
