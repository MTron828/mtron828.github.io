Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly still went to settle the admission procedures for Zoe to be hospitalized so that she could nurse the fetus. After completing everything, Shelly was ready to leave with Benjamin and Bella.

Ultimately, that was all she could do for Zoe. There was no way she would stay in the hospital to take care of Zoe. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Shelly,” Zoe suddenly called out to her.

“Is there anything else?” Shelly turned to look at Zoe.

“Can you call Nox for me?” Zoe asked.

Zoe was completely different from the woman earlier who went to Shelly’s house to ask for money. At that moment, Zoe seemed to have recovered her upbringing as a daughter of a noble family and was very polite.

“Can’t you do it yourself?”

“I just called.” She had tried to call Nox when Shelly went to handle the follow-up procedures for her admission. “But Nox didn’t pick up.”

Nox would never give her his attention anymore

“That’s your own problem.”

“I’m begging you, Shelly. Nox hates me so much that he won’t pick up my calls, but I have to tell Nox about the child. I can’t raise the child on my own. I can’t even support myself” Zoe’s eyes reddened. “You don’t know how difficult my life is now. My family just went bankrupt because of me, and my parents hate me to the bone. If I don’t get the money back, they will beat me to death. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come to you for money. I’m really forced to a dead end. ”

Shelly looked indifferently at Zoe, who seemed devastated. “That has nothing to do with me. About what happened between you and Nox, no matter how miserable you are, it’s all your own fault. You can’t blame anyone else for it. On top of that, you were the one who dragged me into this mess, and I have no reason to help you. Helping you settle the hospitalization procedures and making sure your baby is alright the best I can do.”

“Shelly!” Seeing that Shelly was about to leave, Zoe quickly stopped her. “The person who hurt you wasn’t me. It was Nox. At the end of the day, I didn’t do anything to harm you. Instead, you were the one who used the video to bite me back in the *ss. If you hadn’t helped Nox clarify the video and clear his name, I wouldn’t have ended up like this. When I exposed that video, I had people censor you because I was also trying my best to avoid hurting you!”

“You only censored it because if someone recognized me, it would be unfavorable for you to accuse Nox of cheating. After all, if you dig deeper, you’ll know about my past relationship with Nox, and the whole world knows that Nox doesn’t like me! If he doesn’t like me, why did he sleep with me? People might put two and two together and think I was the one who deliberately seduced him. That way, your accusation will easily be overturned. Therefore, you didn’t censor me because of your kindness!” Shelly exposed him.

Zoe was rendered speechless by what Shelly said. At that time, that was indeed what she thought.

“Besides, you were the one who drugged him on purpose. If you hadn’t drugged him and made him sleep with me, I wouldn’t have gotten involved in this mess. I wouldn’t have to suffer so much cyberbullying because of the grudge between you and Nox!” Shelly got emotional as she spoke.

Everything she had been through recently was too overwhelming, and she even believed that if it continued, she would have a mental breakdown. If not for Bella, she might have been defeated long ago. However, because of Bella, she had no choice but to be strong — to grit her teeth and endure it.

Zoe was embarrassed by Shelly’s accusation. With tears in her eyes, she continued to explain, “I really didn’t want to involve you. Besides, Nox was the one who made you do it. I was just trying to protect myself. Everything was Nox’s fault.

“It really doesn’t matter whose fault it is. I just want to stay far away from you and Nox. I just want to live my own life!” Shelly was very determined. “So, whatever happens between you and Nox is your problem. It has nothing to do with me!”

Zoe did not expect Shelly to be so determined. She had always thought that people like Shelly would be soft-hearted. As long as she acted pitiful, Shelly would compromise.

Nevertheless, the gnashed her teeth and said, “If you call Nox for me and explain my situation, I won’t ask you for the 200 thousand dollars anymore.”

Shelly stopped in her tracks. In fact, she had never thought of returning it to Zoe.

“You know how down and out I am now. Even if I’ve given something away, I’ll still shamelessly ask for it back. So, no matter how determined you are about not returning me my money, if I can’t survive anymore, I’ll still come to you fo it..” Zoe said, “The only way to make both of us feel better, or the only way to stop you from me harassing you, is to let Nox take care of me!”
