Chapter 1503: Chloe’s End: The Death Struggle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, to Edward, taking Chloe down was a piece of cake. As long as he wanted to, anyone would die.

As expected, it was dangerous to be with the Leader of a country, and she should be more careful.

In the quiet room, Edward reached out and pulled her into his embrace. Just a moment ago, they were so far away from each other, but now he was hugging her tightly.

He said, “Don’t despise me.”

Candice was stunned. In the darkness, she looked at Edward and saw him looking straight at her at that moment.

She quickly shook her head. “No, I won’t. You guys didn’t even do it.”

When Candice said that, she even smiled. Moreover, even if they did do it… she would not dare to despise him for it.

She now knew what Edward’s stance on marriage was. They were in a marriage with no love. It was a kinship that did not care about loyalty but about whether they could help each other.

“I said, I’m despicable.” Edward enunciated each word.

Candice bit her lip.

At that moment, she did not know how to reply to him. She wanted to say that he was indeed despicable for using Chloe to achieve some of his political goals.

She did not know why she had thought about it to that extent, but after tonight’s incident, the first thing that came to her mind was that Edward definitely had other motives for doing that. It was definitely not just because Chloe provoked him.

“As the leader of a country, you need to think of the bigger picture. I’m just a woman. I won’t question any of your decisions… Mm.” Candice’s heart skipped a beat.

She watched as Edward suddenly kissed her so hard that it was hard to breathe. It was as if he did not want to hear her continue. There was also a kind of feeling that he did not like how calm she was.

Candice did not reject or take the initiative. In front of Edward, she had become… unusually docile.

The next day, Edward left early in the morning, and Candice received a call from her father at 11 a.m. At that time, she was playing with Legos with Paige, who had just finished class.

She looked at her phone, knowing that some things could not be avoided. Then, she patted Paige’s head, walked to the side, and picked up the phone. “Dad.”

“What happened to Chloe? I have just received news that Edward has sent her to the detention center!” The voice on the other end of the call sounded emotional.

Candice replied, “Last night, Chloe seduced Edward when she was drunk. She was caught by Edward’s bodyguards and was sent to the detention center on the grounds that she was harassing the Leader of the country. I couldn’t plead for Chloe in front of Edward.”

Chloe expressed her helplessness — that she would try her best to avoid unnecessary harm. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Your mother and I will be back soon. We’re boarding the plane now and will be back in South Hampton City in about three hours. Is it convenient for you to come and meet us?

Candice glanced at Paige, who was playing at home. “Sure, I’ll wait for you guys at the Nicholsons’ residence.”

“Alright.”

The other party hung up.

Candice put down her phone and walked straight to Teddy, who was helping George downstairs. It was rare to see George leaving his room the last two days.

“Teddy, I have something to sort out at home, so I’ll leave the kids to you. If Edward comes back and asks for me, just tell him that my dad is looking for me. He probably won’t ask too much,” Candice said bluntly.

“Yes, Madam.” Teddy was always extremely respectful to her.

Chloe lowered her head to look at George, who was in a wheelchair. She stroked his hair very naturally. “Be good at home and don’t cause Teddy any trouble.” “I’m not a child.” George looked displeased. “You should tell Paige that.”

Candice smiled. She felt that teasing George was fun. Although Edward and George clearly had the same bad temper, why did she like George so much more?

However, she did not say anything else and went upstairs to get changed.

“Candic, ” George suddenly called out to her.

That little wimp had been calling her by her name, and it really made her a little unhappy.

“You wouldn’t be so stupid as to go back and plead for your sister, right?” George asked her.

Why would she? She was not so stupid as to offend Edward.

“Why? Are you worried about me?” Candice asked George.

George’s face was slightly red. It was probably because he was embarrassed that his thoughts had been exposed.

He quickly retorted, “Who’s worried about you? I just don’t like your sister very much. On top of that, how dare she try to seduce my father? That’s why I told you not to plead for her.. Stop being so narcissistic!”
