Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica thought she had died.

Before she died, she was wondering if she was the only woman who regretted her suicide immediately.

She even looked down on herself.

She should have died a spectacular death. Otherwise, what would others think of her? What would her father think?

To think she had chosen to commit suicide, yet she asked her father to save her.

However… Now that she was dead, what about her parents?

She was indeed the most childish and irresponsible person in the world!

Those thoughts wandered through her mind silently.

“Monica.” A familiar voice sounded beside her ears.

‘Wait a minute.’ Monica was stunned for two seconds. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Why was she still having thoughts? Did the so-called soul exist after a person died?

Suddenly, she opened her eyes. It was a little blurry at first, but they quickly focused.

Then, she caught the scent of the medicine.

“Monica, you’re finally awake.” A slightly emotional and choked voice sounded in her ears again.

With that, she turned around and saw a familiar face.

Was she dead or not?

“Monica, you child! What happened that made you take things so hard? Tell me, what would happen to your mom and me if something happened to you?” As he said that, tears welled up in his eyes.

Monica’s eyes reddened.

It turned out she was not dead.

She moved her fingers, feeling weak.

Gary seemed to have noticed Monica’s small action, so he hurriedly held his daughter’s hand. “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell? I’ll get the doctor.”

“Dad,” Monica called out to him weakly. “Am I not dead?”

“Silly girl!” Gary caressed her head lovingly.

It had been a long time since her father had been so gentle to her.

A faint smile appeared on her face.

“Monica, how are you feeling?” Ruby quickly asked.

When she heard that her daughter had committed suicide, she was in disbelief.

Her daughter had never been better than anyone since she was young, but she had a good attitude. she had never thought that her daughter would commit suicide.

However, when she rushed to the hospital and saw her daughter’s pale face, she was really frightened.

She blamed herself for not caring enough about her daughter.

Ever since Monica’s divorce from Finn, all everyone seemed to do was blame her. They had never comforted her, never listened to her inner thoughts, and never approved of everything she did. If it were not for the timely rescue, it would have led to a tragedy.

At the thought of that, Ruby was shocked, and her eyes instantly turned red.

“Mom, I just feel a little weak now,” Monica replied.

In fact, she was really weak.

“The doctor said you’ve lost a lot of blood, so it’s normal that you feel weak. However, the doctor said that your life is no longer in danger and that you’ll be fine after a few more days of rest. From now on, I will always be by your side. Don’t do stupid things again, okay?” Ruby’s tone was extremely gentle.

Monica smiled.

Her actions this time must have given them a huge scare.

Not only them but she was also scared out of her wits.

How could she have committed suicide?

She still could not believe that she had slit her wrist with a knife.

Where did she find the courage to do that? Did Michael really force her into a corner? Or… did Finn’s indifference make her feel like she had nothing to live for?

Anyway, since she was given another chance, she probably would not do it again.

She moved her body and tried to sit up.

At that moment, her eyes narrowed.

She looked straight at the door of the ward to see Michael pushing the door open and walking in.

His appearance made her originally pale face even paler.

“Michael, aren’t you going to get more rest?” Gary quickly asked. His attitude toward Michael was different from before.

Michael was also very polite toward Gary. He said, “I was worried about Monica, so I came to see if she was awake.”

His voice was a little weak, and his face also looked a little pale.

“She just woke up,” Gary said.

Ruby also brought a chair over for Michael to sit by Monica’s bed.

She swallowed the words that she was about to say.

Monica’s throat moved.

She stared coldly at Michael.

“It’s all thanks to Michael this time.” Ruby said, “If he hadn’t rushed to your house and saved you, you would’ve been dead. The doctor also said that if we were a minute late, they might not have been able to save you.”
