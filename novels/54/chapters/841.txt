Chapter 842 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

This time, Monica was afraid that she did not have enough blood and would just die.

She had clearly said that she would never joke about her body again.

However, she still provoked Nox impulsively just now.

It was too late for regrets.

She called out to Nox in pain.

The next moment, she heard a cold voice say, “Take your hand away and let me see.”

Monica’s body froze.

She raised her head to look at Finn and saw that he had appeared in front of her without her knowing.

At this moment, Nox had brought a first aid kit over.

The most comprehensive thing prepared in Bamboo Garden was probably the first aid kit. There were at least five of them in total.

“Take your hand off!” Finn’s voice became colder as if he was giving an order.

Monica did not want to take it away.

She did not even want Finn to know that she had committed suicide.

She did not want Finn to know about her unbearable side.

She bit her lip and did not move.

Nox could not stand it anymore. He directly went over and used brute force to grab Monica’s hand away.

Monica could not resist at all, and the bloody gauze on her wrist was shown in front of him.

“F*ck! “So much blood!” Nox cursed.

In fact, he still felt a little guilty.

He did not even think that Monica had a wound on her wrist.

If he had known, he would not have treated her like that.

No matter how much he hated her, he had never thought of torturing her.

He just watched as Finn reached out and suddenly pulled Monica’s hand in front of him.

Monica bit her lip.

“Bear with it,” Finn said.

There was still no warmth in his tone.

Monica kept biting her lip, trying to endure the unbearable pain.

Finn held a pair of medical scissors with his slender fingers and used them to remove Monica’s gauze. Under the gauze, there was a long wound on her delicate wrist. The wound had been stitched up, and at this moment, it was obvious that the stitch was torn open, and blood was flowing out continuously.

Finn took out a medical cotton ball, dipped it in disinfectant alcohol, and pressed it hard on Monica’s wrist.

“Ah!” Monica shouted.

She could not help but cry out.

It was too painful.

It was so painful that her whole body was spasming.

She could not stand it.

It was unbearable.

Her tears flowed wildly, and her vision was blurry. Her body was instinctively resisting, and she could not control her other hand as she ruthlessly pushed Finn away.

Monica pushed him hard.

She felt like she was going to die from the pain at this moment.

She could not stand it.

She shouted loudly, “Let me go! Finn, let me go!

Finn’s eyes moved.

He did not let go.

He allowed Monica’s other hand to push him non-stop. When the pain reached her limit, she even scratched his skin with her nails.

Nox, who was watching from the side, was also a little shocked.

He had seen many people get injured with injuries a hundred times more serious than Monica’s, but whether it was him, Fourth Master Swan, Finn, or his subordinates, no one would show their pain as much as Monica did.

Even Nox felt pain.

“Finn, I’m begging you to let me go. I’m begging you to let me go,” Monica mumbled as she cried. She seemed to be in so much pain that she was in despair.

Nox even suspected that Monica was about to die from the pain.

‘F*ck.

‘Women are good at acting.

‘Fourth Master Swan had almost died from his injuries, but he wasn’t in so much pain.

‘It’s just a small cut. Does it hurt so much?

‘Say, why is there a wound on Monica’s wrist?’

The position of the wound was hard to ignore.

In the hall, Monica’s cries were heard.

There were screams.

She even woke George up.

He rubbed his eyes and came down the stairs in a daze. He saw his godmother, who never played by the rules, shouting and wrangling.

In the end, George was still calm.

He just walked over obediently and looked at his godmother. He stood beside her and looked at her.

At this moment, Monica did not even notice George’s arrival.

Otherwise... Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Otherwise, she might have been able to bear it in front of George.

Okay, the truth was that she would not be able to bear it no matter who was present.

At this moment, she wanted to die from the pain.

Finn, who was holding her hand, had no intention of letting go of her wrist.

Gradually, Monica seemed to be numb from the pain.

She calmed down a little.

She calmly looked at Finn’s cold face.

He was completely indifferent to her pain.
