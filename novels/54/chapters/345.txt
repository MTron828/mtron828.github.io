Chapter 346: Madam, Missus, Wife, or Jeannie?

The man hugging her did not close his eyes.

Instead, he looked at her quietly in his arms like a soft little kitten. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The corners of his mouth lifted into a smile, and his eyes were filled with affection.

…

When Jeanne woke up, she was sure that she had enough sleep.

She then tried to turn over, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not move.

With a frown, she opened her eyes, only to see Fourth Master Swan’s handsome face up close.

Did he have to put himself so close to her?

She was afraid that she, too, would not be able to control herself seeing such a handsome face as soon as she opened her eyes.

“Are you awake?” Fourth Master Swan asked her.

At that moment, she was lying on his arm, and the two of them were hugging each other. It was a very intimate position.

Something in her eyes moved, and she averted her gaze. That face was so good-looking that it could be so dangerous sometimes.

Then, her gaze fell on his neck.

......

Looking at his bobbing Adam’s apple, she said, “I’m awake.”

This time, she was really awake, and she also felt very hungry.

“If you’re awake, let’s get up,” he said.

As Jeanne nodded, she heard him say, “I’ve already been in bed with you for an entire day and night.”

What did he mean by that?

They clearly had sex last night! Fine. If being in bed was what he wanted to call it, so be it.

“It’s 6 p.m. now.”

“What?!” Jeanne widened her eyes in disbelief.

She had slept for an entire day. It was no wonder she was starving to death.

As Edward lifted the blanket, Jeanne suddenly felt cold and hugged her body.

Then, Edward got off the bed and picked Jeanne up from the bed.

Jeanne was shocked.

Edward did not seem to care about clothes.

He directly carried her into the bathroom, where they both washed up… naked. She wished she could complain to him about how uncomfortable she was.

Therefore, she washed up as quickly as she could and dashed straight into the cloakroom.

She knew many of her clothes were there, so she randomly picked out a set of loose loungewear.

Just as she was about to change into it, the door to the cloakroom opened.

Jeanne immediately used her clothes to shield her body.

“I’ve seen it.” Edward smiled and began picking what to wear. He was very calm.

Jeanne turned around, and with her back facing Fourth Master Swan, she put on her own clothes.

However, as soon as she was dressed, she was picked up again.

Jeanne was speechless.

She found that men were liars sometimes.

“Does this hurt?” Edward suddenly asked her.

In front of her was a huge mirror, and his slender fingers pointed at her collarbone, where a greenish-purple mark was visible.

It was a hickey.

In fact, there were actually many hickeys on her body.

She looked at the innocent-looking man in the mirror.

At that moment, Fourth Master Swan looked just like the boy next door. He looked so fresh and clean. Compared to the person last night... The difference was like heaven and earth.

She said, “It doesn’t hurt.”

She really did not feel any pain.

Even she was surprised to see so many hickeys on her in the mirror.

“Is that so?” Edward did not seem to believe her.

“Yes.” Jeanne was very sure. Not wanting to argue with the man in front of her, she said, “I’m hungry.”

She was hungry and wanted to eat.

Edward’s eyebrows moved.

“I’m hungry,” Jeanne repeated herself.

She was starving to death.

“Actually, I’m hungry too,” Edward said. When he said it, he even smiled.

“Well then, let’s eat together,” Jeanne suggested.

However, he still hugged her and refused to let her go.

The man smiled again, and he looked so d*mn good when he did.

He said, “So you’re hungry, Ms. Lawrence.”

In her head, she screamed, ‘Duh!’

With that, Edward let go of her and held her hand as they walked out of the cloakroom.

Jeanne glanced at his big hand, which held hers all of yesterday to complete an important ceremony in her life.

Her heart was pounding a little.

She still found it somewhat unbelievable that she had married Fourth Master Swan. For a very long time, at least, they would have to live together.

When they went downstairs, Teddy and George were both there.

George was sitting on the sofa, watching Peppa Pig on the TV.

Jeanne noticed that George looked like his life was devoid of meaning.

George had never watched cartoons. However, at that moment, he was sitting quietly on the sofa, watching it with Teddy, who was enjoying it.

The contrasting looks on those two’s faces were somewhat funny.
