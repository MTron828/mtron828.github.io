Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

With that thought in mind, Jeanne came out after washing up.

Edward lay on the bed as if waiting for her.

“Don’t you have work today?” Jeanne asked.

“I have other things to deal with today.” Edward replied, “My appointment is at 10 a.m. It’s still early.”

“In that case, you should sleep for a while more. I’ll head off now.”

“Jeannie.” Edward stopped her.

“What?” Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“Come here. Let me hug you.”

Jeanne refused as that hug would definitely last the entire morning, and she would not be able to escape.

Hence, she ran away again.

After breakfast, Jeanne drove to Lawrence Enterprise.

Jeanne had seen the news and realized the matter of Joshua’s arrest had not been exposed yet. Perhaps the Sanders did not want to blow up the matter, so they did not announce it to the public. After all, no matter what, Joshua’s actions last night affected Quinn’s reputation.

With that, she picked up her phone and dialed, “Miles.”

“Yes.”

“How was Quinn’s condition last night?”

“She was a little devastated at first, but she slowly calmed down.”

“Did you take the video I asked you to?”

“I’ll send it to you.”

“Alright,” he said.

“By the way, Jake Crawford also appeared last night.”

“Who?”

“He’s the man who followed Finn last time. He’s the retired special forces soldier from the Sanders.”

“Did you get a clip of him?”

“For one second, but we should be able to identify him.”

“Alright.” That was good news. Then, Jeanne said, “Good work last night.”

“Finn also contributed a lot last night.”

“Yeah.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and immediately dialed Finn’s number. “I didn’t wake you up, did I?”

“I have a long break every day, so you’re not disturbing me in any way,” Finn said bluntly.

After all, he had been asked to “recuperate at home ” and was not allowed to go to work at the hospital.

“Thank you for last night.”

“It’s nothing.” Finn appeared very polite.

“Did Miles tell you? Jake Crawford, the man who followed you last time, was also there.”

“He did.” Finn’s tone was cold. “But that’s not important to me.”

“Don’t you want to know who’s plotting against you?” Jeanne asked, “Or in other words, don’t you want to expose Michael? ”

“I don’t want to.” Finn said, “It doesn’t affect my personal interests, so I don’t want to waste time on it.”

“Monica is nothing to you anymore, right? ”

“Nope.”

“Finn, you’re too rational.”

“I just know some people are not worth my time.”

“Monica actually likes you very much.”

“But the person she trusts the most is Michael.”

“In that case, shouldn’t you show her what kind of person Michael is and let her know how stupid she was back then?!”

“That’s her own business.” Finn still remained cold and indifferent.

Jeanne felt that whatever she said would be useless.

After all, it was their relationship, and outsiders should not interfere in that matter.

She said, “After Monica found out that you’ve completely given up on her, she’s been drunk every night. In her drunken state, she said she missed you but didn’t dare to get close to you because she knew you hated her. She’s actually not doing too well.”

“But she still thinks that Michael is the best.”

Jeanne pursed her lips, speechless. “That’s because she hasn’t seen Michael’s bad side.”

“Jeanne. Do you think you can be half-hearted in a relationship?” Finn asked her in return.

“No, but there can be extenuating circumstances.”

“Monica and I have broken up twice. The first time was a misunderstanding, so we could let go of it. However, the second time wasn’t a misunderstanding. That was when Monica knew that I didn’t accept her doing this, yet she still gave up everything for Michael. What am I to Monica?”

Jeanne bit her lip and had nothing to say.

“Not all harm can be forgiven in the name of ‘love’. I have my own principles.” Finn said, ” I can’t accept being abandoned, yet I was abandoned by Monica twice.”

Jeanne believed Finn had completely given up on his relationship with Monica. Once a person gave up, it would be really, really difficult to rekindle the relationship.

She felt that between Monica and Finn, either Monica would always love him but could not get him or she would choose to let go.

In short, their relationship was no longer possible.

Jeanne did not say anything else. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After all, if she said too much, he would be annoyed.

With that, she hung up the phone and continued to drive seriously until she arrived at Lawrence Enterprise.

As she walked into her office, Amy ran in and said breathlessly, “President Lawrence, something bad has happened.”
