She slapped her palms on the door until they were swollen, but Finn still did not open the door.

What should she do? Should she give up just like that?

Sarah cried her heart out, feeling upset.

She was wondering if Finn was still keeping his innocence for her cousin. Hence, no matter who it was, even if he was not in his right mind now, he would not have sex with the woman in front of him because he was not sure who she was!

Did that mean Finn was still waiting for her cousin?

The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt.

She frantically knocked on the door again.

Fortunately, it was a luxurious suite in a five-star hotel. The soundproofing was very good, so it would not disturb the other guests.

Tired of knocking, Sarah squatted down on the ground again and cried hard.

Just then, her phone rang.

Looking at the incoming call, she picked it up with a lump in her throat. “Hello.”

“Oh, here you are. I thought you wouldn’t pick up. What’s the matter? Has it not started, or is it over?” the person on the other end of the call teased.

“Boo-hoo.” Sarah cried her heart out.

“What’s wrong? Did you hurt yourself?”

“No, Finn kicked me out. I’m outside the door now, and I can’t go in.”

The other person was stunned. “How did this happen?”

“I don’t know. Finn just pushed me out like a crazy person. My hand is swollen, but he won’t open the door.”

“Then what should we do?” The person on the other side started to get a little anxious.

She was still hoping Sarah and Finn would have sex so that she could receive a reward of 50,000 dollars!

“I don’t know.”

“You have to think of a way to sleep with Finn.” The other party seemed even more agitated than her. “I heard the drug is very strong. If people who take the drug don’t release its effects, they might bleed from all seven orifices and suffocate to death.”

“Is that true?” Sarah was instantly frightened.

At first, she only felt bad, but now, she was frightened.

“It’s true. I heard if you don’t vent it out after taking the drug, your internal organs will explode. If that’s the case...” The other party was panicking. “Are we considered murderers?”

“No, I can’t let Finn die like that. I can’t!” Sarah was so scared that she quickly hung up the phone.

The other party did the same as well.

After Sarah left, a few of Sarah’s friends were still in the private room of the bar.

The few boys who had come to put on an act had left, leaving only a few of them behind, including Shelly.

Shelly had never agreed to such a method, but Sarah was very determined, so she did not try to dissuade her.

However, seeing that Lizzy did not look good, Shelly could not help but ask, “How’s Sarah doing?”

“Finn has kicked Sarah out of the room,” Lizzy quickly replied.

Shelly heaved a sigh of relief at that moment.

She had a feeling that if Sarah used that method to get Finn, she would only get half the result with twice the effort she made. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“We can’t just stand by and watch Sarah lose such a great opportunity. We have to think of a way to help her,” Lizzy said anxiously.

“Forget it,” Shelly flatly rejected her. “Since Finn has rejected Sarah, even under such circumstances, it proves that he doesn’t like Sarah. We might as well persuade Sarah to let go of him.”

“How can we do that?” Shelly blurted out. “We’ve done so much. How can we give up?”

“This method wasn’t a good one, to begin with. How can anyone get a relationship through scheming? Even if they get one, they won’t be happy.”

“Shelly, don’t you want the best for Sarah? Because you haven’t been able to seduce Nox, you can’t wait for Sarah to be like you, huh?”

“I’m doing this for Sarah’s sake!” Shelly’s face was red with anger. “But you, aren’t you being a little too much? Does Sarah want to sleep with Finn? Why are you more proactive than her?”

Lizzy felt a little guilty, but she mustered the courage and said, “I’m anxious for Sarah because I know Sarah likes Finn very much. Unlike some people who say they’re good friends with Sarah but don’t want Sarah to be happy.”

“Lizzy, what kind of person do you think I am?” Shelly was enraged.

“Moreover, the medicine that Finn took is very strong. If he doesn’t release its effects, he might really die. Do you want Sarah to become a murderer?” Lizzy said aggressively.

“Alright, stop arguing.” Another friend, James, quickly tried to stop them. “We all want the best for Sarah, so let’s stop fighting.”
