Chapter 772: Jenifer Exposed, Utterly Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Without thinking too deeply about why Jasmine was taken away, he could instinctively tell that the matter would do him no good.

After explaining the situation, the usually calm Micheal suddenly flew into a rage. “How could you let Nox take Jasmine away?”

Eden was a little dazed. “I didn’t expect Nox to come to Jasmine, so I wasn’t prepared.”

“If I don’t think of it, you won’t either, right?” Michael was furious.

Eden was also upset by what Michael said about him. “Since last night, I’ve dealt with so many things. How could I have thought of so many things? You said you didn’t think of it, so what’s the use of saying that to me now?”

“How have you been treating Jasmine recently?” Michael suppressed his emotions, seemingly not wanting to waste time arguing with Eden.

“Not good,” Eden said bluntly. “I locked her up, fed her leftovers, and even gave her to my servants to play with. How much of a good life do you think she has been living?”

Michael’s hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

“Is there a problem?” Eden asked.

Michael did not want to answer.

The first thing he thought of was that Jeanne would get Jasmine to expose Jenifer. Then, the image that Jenifer had established as the victim would be reversed!

Michael gritted his teeth. Everything was for naught, and he had overestimated Eden.

“Michael?” Realizing that Michael did not answer, Eden called out to him.

“You should think about it yourself.” Michael really did not want to say anything, so he hung up the phone.

In fact, he had been suppressing his emotions ever since he heard that Joshua failed last night.

He suppressed it and tried his best to calm himself down and think about how he could make that failure work. Hence, he thought of using that opportunity to frame Jeanne.

Jeanne was also a threat to him.

Once Jeanne confirmed that she had saved Quinn, Quinn would be indebted to her in the future. That meant instead of him winning Quinn over, Quinn was won over by Jeanne, and he would never allow anyone to take what was his.

On the other hand, Jeanne was Monica’s best friend, and she had always been suspicious of Monica helping him. If Jeanne found out that something was amiss, his relationship with Monica would be done for.

In summary, he needed to get rid of Jeanne.

He and Eden had discussed it for an entire night. The two of them had split up the work and spent an entire night preparing everything. They even thought of bribing the Lawrences’ servants, but they did not think of Jasmine.

He had been careless because he had not thought about how bad Eden and Jasmine’s relationship was. However, Eden should have known how miserable Jasmine was. He should have thought that Jasmine could help Jeanne to get out of her current situation.

Michael’s expression was extremely ugly.

He looked at the phone screen and saw that Jenifer was still trying to gain sympathy.

With that, a message popped up on the screen. “Your thing last night is on the news now.”

Michael had been busy dealing with Joshua’s affairs the entire night and had forgotten to inform the other party that he did not need to upload the news today.

Even if it was published, no one would pay attention because all attention was on Jeanne at that moment.

He had originally wanted to use the media’s public opinion to force Monica to give up on the idea of breaking up with him immediately, but his efforts were all in vain.

He gritted his teeth and picked up the phone that suddenly rang again. “Jake.”

“I think Finn and Miles discovered me last night,” the other party suddenly said.

Michael’s grip on the phone tightened. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“When I left the hotel, I think I saw Miles glance at me. I kept feeling that something was off, so I spent the entire night checking my tracks through the traffic cameras. It was only then that I realized someone had been following me, and that person was Miles.”

“How long has he been following you?”

“It’s been more than a month,”

“And you didn’t notice?” Michael’s face darkened.

“He doesn’t follow me closely, and he didn’t do it often. It’s on and off, and he would only follow me for a distance before he would leave, making it hard for him to be discovered.” Zhang Liang said bluntly, “And I only found out after checking the surveillance cameras.”

Then, Michael instructed, “Wait for my orders.”

“Yes.”

After hanging up the phone, Michael’s face was frighteningly gloomy.

He had always thought that Jeanne had not taken any action against him and was still just speculating.

Unexpectedly, Jeanne had already started to make a move on him in secret.

Since he had been discovered, he had to eliminate them!

As for last night’s plan, he had to start over right now!
