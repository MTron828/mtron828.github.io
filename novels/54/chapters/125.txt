Chapter 126: Ms. Lawrence, Can You Show More Sincerity?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The only way is to relocate our logistics warehouse.”

“No.” Jeanne directly rejected, “The investments in the logistics warehouse have already gone in. The cost has already been consumed. Moving the location represents a steady loss. Moreover, the implementation of the cooperation with MUK was already imminent. It was already too late to relocate and choose a new land to buy, lease, or plan. More importantly...”

More importantly, things were not that simple.

No matter where she moved to, the final result would be the same.

And she did not think that this was a coincidence.

“Then what do you want?” Bryce was furious. “The transportation to the logistics warehouse will be so bad! Can you guarantee that our operation will be smooth from now on?”

“No. That’s why I’ll think of a way.” Jeanne faced Bryce, “When you encounter a problem, you don’t blindly pursue the blame. Instead, how to solve it. If every leader’s thinking is the same as Director Hoffman’s, then our company won’t be able to survive at all!”

“Jeanne, you’re too presumptuous!” Bryce was so angry that he directly stood up.

“I’m just doing business, unlike Director Hoffman who is clearly being emotional here.”

It meant that he was deliberately targeting her.

“Jeanne, you...”

“Enough!” Alexander said, “Can you be quiet? Can arguing solve the problem?”

“I just can’t stand her attitude! She has no sense of urgency at all,” Bryce said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne sneered.

She said, “I’m in a hurry. I need to leave now to think about how to solve this issue, and not to waste my time here with you guys.”

“How dare you!”

“General manager, I already know about the matter. I’ll go down and think of a solution first,” she said.

Jeanne did not ask for anyone’s consent and turned around to leave.

She was only very clear that rather than wasting time in the meeting, it was better to go and understand the situation as soon as possible.

Once Jeanne left, Bryce could not hold it in any longer. “President Lawrence, how can she be a daughter of the Lawrence Family? She’s so uncultured!”

“Do you think your upbringing is good just because you’re targeting a little girl?” Alexander mocked coldly.

Bryce was somewhat embarrassed by his words.

“Before this matter is resolved, don’t fan the flames here. Meeting adjourned!”

Alexander left.

Bryce’s expression was very cold in the meeting room.

Back then, Alexander had always been bullied by him. Now that they had negotiated a contract, he was more arrogant than ever.

What right did an incompetent leader have to order him around?

Joshua was also in the meeting room. At this moment, he was not in a hurry to leave. It was obvious that he had also seen how angry his father was.

The corner of his mouth curled into an evil smile. He left the meeting room and returned to his own office. He excitedly called Eden.

“Brother-in-law, did you build the amusement park opposite our logistics warehouse?”

Eden sneered, “Would you have thought of it?”

“I knew it was you! Just now, Jeanne was scolded badly by our senior directors during the meeting.”

“She deserved it.”

“If that’s the case, won’t her project be unable to proceed?”Joshua was very excited.

“The logistics warehouse’s location planning is wrong. If we stop the construction, the investment will be directly wasted. If we don’t stop the construction, the later losses will be even greater. Therefore, no matter what they choose to do, this project will be a loss. Once the news breaks out, the stock markets of both the Lawrence Enterprise and MUK Group will plunge. I don’t believe that MUK will let the Lawrence Enterprise off the hook if this happens. According to the commercial contract law, as long as one side makes a unilateral error in decision making that results in a huge loss of profits, the other side can unconditionally terminate the contract.”

“Then hurry up and expose the news.”

“I’ll remind you that it’s already been exposed and even trending. Go enjoy it yourself.”

“I’ll hang up, then.”

Joshua hung up the phone excitedly.

Eden looked at the phone and sneered.

Joshua was a piece of trash. His family’s business had already suffered such a heavy financial loss, yet he was still so excited.

Sooner or later, the Lawrences would be done for.
