“You knew that I like Benjamin and I’m with him, yet you confessed and tried to snatch me away from him. This is enough to prove your character. How are you going to make me believe that you will become a kind person who won’t make things difficult for others?”

Shelly was not tactful with how she phrased her words, and it could make those listening embarrassed.

Nox simply looked at Shelly, speechless because of what she said.

“Let go of me. I’ll help you with the discharge procedures.” Shelly did not want to waste any more time with Nox.

Nox sneered. He realized she had been talking about handling the discharge procedures because she would no longer have to care about him after handling the discharge procedures. Did she really not want to see him?

“Shelly, are you really not going to give me a chance?”

“No,” Shelly replied without thinking twice.

“I thought that as long as I asked, you would return to my side.” Suddenly, he said sadly, “Don’t you like money? Aren’t I rich? Shouldn’t you come back to me?”

“I hate you more than I like money, and because I hate you, I think money is no longer important.”

Shelly’s rejection of Nox every time could really drive him into a corner.

“So, you won’t be with me no matter what?” Nox asked.

“I won’t, no matter what.” Shelly was very sure.

Her decisiveness made Nox’s throat move. It was the first time he had been rejected by a woman like that.

He suddenly let go of her and said, “Shelly, you’ll regret this.”

Shelly knew she would not regret it, not for the rest of her life. When she felt Nox let go, she immediately left him.

Nox stared coldly at Shelly’s back. He had a feeling that Shelly would regret it.

After all, no one would give up such great wealth and choose to live a poor life. Hence, he decided he would give Shelly more time to come back to him on her own accord.

With that thought in mind, he comforted himself. He was even crying because of how determined Shelly was about leaving. Nevertheless, that woman that he hated yet loved to death would come back to beg him one day!

After settling the discharge procedures for Nox, instead of returning to the ward, Shelly left the hospital and returned home.

When she opened the door, Benjamin was combing Bella’s hair. It was obvious that he was not good at it, so Bella’s hair was messy.

That scene made Shelly feel so touched that her eyes turned red. Sometimes, all she wanted was a person who was sincere and kind.

When Benjamin saw Shelly, there was a wide smile on his face. ‘You’re back so early! I’m combing Bella’s hair.”

“Let me do it.” Shelly composed herself and walked over.

When Bella saw that her mother had returned, she jumped with excitement and quickly went over to hug Shelly. “Mommy, I’ve missed you so much.” “Aren’t I back? Be good, don’t cry,” Shelly comforted.

“Promise that you will never leave me again, okay?” Bella said sadly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Okay.”

“Mommy…” Bella continued to hug Shelly.

Shelly also hugged Bella.

Benjamin looked at them with a smile and said, “In that case, I’ll head back now.”

He did not want to disturb their mother-daughter reunion.

Upon hearing that, Shelly looked up at Benjamin, whose kindness sometimes made her feel guilty.

“Bella has had breakfast.” Before Benjamin left, he said, “I also bought some vegetables in the fridge. It should be enough for you to eat for two days. Try not to go out or open the door during this time.” “Thank you.” Shelly nodded.

Benjamin smiled, changed his shoes, and left.

Just as he was at the elevator, Shelly suddenly called out to him from behind,

“Benjamin.”

Benjamin stopped in his tracks and turned around. “What’s wrong?”

Worry filled his face as he was worried about her, and the swords that Shelly wanted to say were stuck in her throat.

“What’s wrong?” Benjamin started getting more nervous.

He was worried that something had happened to Shelly.

“Did Nox do something to you?” Benjamin was a little agitated.

“No,” Shelly said, “I’ve made it clear to Nox, and if Nox has some self-respect, he won’t come looking for me again..”
