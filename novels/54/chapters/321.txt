Chapter 322: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

The big screen of Fourth Master Swan proposing to Jeanne lasted a whole day and night.

The last time such a scene happened was seven years ago when Monica was courting Finn, and the entire South Hampton City was in an uproar.

Just as everyone was still discussing whether Jeanne would marry Fourth Master, the news media had already announced that Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne’s wedding would be on the 16th of that month, which was three days later.

The viral news spread like wildfire across Harken!

Previously, there had been news of Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne having an affair, but nobody thought it was real. Even though they knew that the media would not dare to spread rumors about Fourth Master Swan, it was still... unbelievable, and they thought it was probably just hype.

Yet now, they were about to get married! In that case, they had to believe that Fourth Master Swan was really having an affair with Jeanne!

Did the rumors not say that Fourth Master Swan was cold and abstinent and that he was not interested in women?! As expected, the rumors could not be believed!

The viral news spread all over Harken.

When Monica saw the news, she was also shocked to her core!

The memory of Jeanne firmly telling her that she would never be with Fourth Master Swan was still fresh in her mind. Could it be that Jeanne really was moved? Jeannie was so moved with Fourth Master Swan saving her that…

However, was it not too frivolous to get married as soon as they said they wanted to?

More importantly, they were getting married right away.

F*ck! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

......

Jeanne even lied to her and said that she did not like him. If she did not like him, would she get married to him right away?!

Monica roared on the phone, questioning Jeanne about her dishonesty.

Jeanne could only bite the bullet and accept Monica’s accusations. To be honest, she did not expect it to be so soon either.

She thought it would be at least three to five months later. Yet now, it was in three days.

When she saw the wedding date announcement, she remained silent for a long time, still shocked that she was really going to marry Fourth Master Swan.

After all, Fourth Master Swan…

Although they did have sex seven years ago, she still felt he was out of her reach!

“Jeanne!” Monica roared on the other end of the phone.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

It was not her fault for being absent-minded. It was Monica who kept going on and on.

Her ears were getting calluses from talking.

“Aren’t you going to comfort my hurt little heart? You made me worry about you for so long!” Monica was unhappy.

Jeanne smiled. “How do you want me to comfort you?”

“I want to be a bridesmaid!” Monica enunciated each word clearly.

Jeanne almost choked on her saliva. “Aren’t you married?”

According to Harken’s traditions, a married woman could not be a bridesmaid.

Of course, she was not one to follow traditions, but she was afraid that the Swans would not be able to accept it.

What if it bothers them?

“I don’t care! I want to be your bridesmaid! Back then, we agreed that no matter who gets married, we’ll be each other’s bridesmaids. You weren’t here when I got married, so can’t I come when you get married?!” Monica stood her ground.

Jeanne was actually touched.

When they were young, the two of them had dreams of getting married, so they agreed to be each other’s bridesmaids and be with each other when they got married.

However, she was still under Kingsley’s command when Monica got married. She was trained like crazy and could not get away at all. Thinking about it now, she felt very sorry for Monica.

“I’ll ask the Fourth Master.” Jeanne planned to fight for Monica to be her bridesmaid.

However, getting married was a matter between two people. If the Swans did not agree, she would have to let Monica down again.

“Tell Fourth Master Swan that if he doesn’t agree, I’ll sue him for plagiarism!” Monica said fiercely.

“Huh?”

“For plagiarizing my idea! I confessed to that b*stard Finn that year the same way Fourth Master Swan proposed to you. If he doesn’t agree, I’ll take him to court and sue him for stealing my idea without my permission!” Monica said seriously.

Jeanne almost died from laughter.

She said, “Okay. I’ll try.”

In fact, there were no financial benefits or patent applications, so no legal effect would take place.

“But Jeannie, I don’t think Fourth Master Swan thought it through well enough.” Monica suddenly became very serious, and her words were a little deep.

Jeanne nodded.

He really did not think it through well enough.

Who the f*ck would get married in such a hurry?

However, she had to admit it.

Although she did not want to have any expectations of the wedding, in reality, every woman hoped she would have a special wedding. For it to be in such a hurry...

“He shouldn’t have plagiarized the idea I used to pursue Finn. It’s a bad omen,” Monica said.
