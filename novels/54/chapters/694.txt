Chapter 695: Letting Go: Sorry I Made You Feel Disgusted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Scram!” Finn’s veins were bulging, and his voice was ice-cold.

While looking at Finn, Monica’s tears fell like rain.

It turned out Finn could be so cruel!

Nevertheless, she resisted the urge to cry and fought the immense pain she felt. Then, without crying, she turned around and left.

She had had enough of Finn’s cold-bloodedness and ruthlessness toward her.

The moment she twisted the doorknob and was about to leave, she turned back to change her clothes as there was no way she could leave in her bathrobe.

However, all of her clothes were still in the bathroom, and they were in tatters.

She had just walked in when she saw Finn’s bloody eyes glaring at her fiercely.

Before Monica could speak, Finn said coldly, “Weren’t you leaving?”

Monica bit her lips so hard that they turned white.

All the first times that she had fantasized about had turned into nightmares!

Finn suddenly got up from the ground, picked up his clothes that were soaked, and quickly put them on. Then, he left Monica’s side coldly.

Monica held onto her bathrobe tightly, controlling herself from stopping Finn from leaving and pestering him about why he was treating her like that, why he was so cruel, or if was she really not worthy of his love.

However, she was afraid of Finn’s indifference toward her.

Her body trembled as she felt Finn leave.

In the next second, though, she could not bear it anymore.

Ever since she was young, she had never been a person to keep things to herself. She would say whatever she wanted and do whatever she wanted. Hence, she could not take how Finn was treating her. What did she do wrong for him to treat her like that?

With that, she rushed out of the bathroom.

Coincidentally, Finn opened the door to the room at that moment.

“Finn, stop right there!” Monica used up her last bit of courage to call out to him.

Finn was stunned for a second, but he still opened the door.

“Finn!” Monica’s voice was torn apart.

Was Finn’s heart made of stone? How could he be so heartless? Could he not feel the pain of her despair?

Yes. He could not feel Monica crying her heart out behind him.

The moment he opened the door, he saw Sarah, who had been guarding the door the whole time. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Sarah’s eyes reddened again when she saw Finn come out.

She had waited all night and all morning, and everything that should have happened had happened.

In fact, she knew it already happened from the moment they walked out of the room.

However, she still lied to herself.

By doing that, was she trying to make herself give up on Finn and make herself realize the reality the the person he loved would always and only her cousin?

She thought him coming out from that room and him having sex with another woman was enough for her to give up her feelings for him.

She looked at Finn with her heart broken. Just as she turned around and was about to leave, Finn asked, “Do you like me?”

Sarah was stunned.

“If you like me, don’t reject me!” Finn said.

Then, he suddenly leaned over and lifted her chin before a kiss — an ice-cold kiss — landed on her lips.

Sarah’s mind suddenly went blank.

Finn was there, kissing her, Sarah.

Monica watched silently. After sleeping together last now, Finn was now kissing Sarah in front of her.

She could see everything clearly behind Finn.

Did It hurt? It did not hurt anymore. It was as if she was already numb.

In the end, everything she did was just an insult to herself.

When Finn said to let go, he meant to let go forever, which meant that he really did not love her.

Only she foolishly thought she was going through a fake divorce and that she would be able to return to Finn’s side after that. She even thought that she would treat Finn very well in the future to make up for what she had done to him this whole time.

Well, that would not be necessary now.

Last night was a mistake. She should not even be here.

If she did not come, it would have been Sarah who slept with Finn.

She should wish her cousin and Finn well.

What on earth made her feel so important last night to think she could save Finn’s life?

Finn would probably rather suffocate than touch her.
