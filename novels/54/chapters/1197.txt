1198 The Game Between Edward And Alex

His tone was a little cold.

However, Edward did not respond. He just accepted his criticism in silence.

“Are you feeling better?” Zachary did not seem to want to talk about Jeanne and changed the topic.

“Much better.”

“Since you’ve recovered, go to Alex’s side as soon as possible,” Zachary said bluntly.

Edward looked at him.

“Now that the Sanders have fallen, Alex has no legitimate reason to rule the country. There are still many things that need to be done, and he needs your help now.”

“I won’t go.” Edward rejected him.

“Slam!” Zachary slammed his hands on the coffee table, causing it to shake.

One could imagine how angry Zachary was.

“I’ve already broken off all ties with Alex.” Edward was indifferent to Zachary’s temper.

He seemed to have expected it, so he could be very calm.

“For Jeanne, right?”

“Not only that, but it’s also for me!” Edward said bluntly, “I can only work for Alex to this extent. From now on, that would be his own business. I’ve never thought of helping him to rule the country, nor have I ever thought of entering politics. It’s not just me, but I suggest that you don’t get too involved as well.”

Zachary’s expression was extremely ugly.

“You should know that overshadowing your boss makes them feel uneasy.” Edward said bluntly, “We were the ones who helped him and the Duncans to gain control of the country and dealt with many things in the Duncans. Before he exposed his identity, we did everything for him. Considering that most of the loyal members of the Duncans listened to our arrangements, if we don’t hand over our power now, the first thing Alex will be wary of will be the Swans. Therefore, I suggest that you go your separate ways from the Duncans. We will continue to do business and not interfere with the state’s affairs. He can rely on himself to regain his power.”

Zachary did not say anything. He just looked at Edward with a dark expression.

However, Edward did not expect an answer from him. After all, he could not make a decision for his father and might not be able to persuade him.

Hence, he stood up and was about to leave. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He felt that whatever his father wanted to do in the end was his own business, and he respected all of his father’s choices.

He, on the other hand, would only go with his own choice.

“Edward.” As Edward walked to the door, Zachary suddenly called out to him.

Edward stopped in his tracks.

“It’s already too late,” Zachary said.

Edward’s expression sank.

“Alex has already set his eyes on us,” Zachary said bluntly.

Edward turned back to look at him.

“If it were just a simple master-servant relationship between the Duncans and the Swans, and we have no other connection, we’ve done our best to help them. If we choose to leave, we can leave, but we can’t. Edward, you’re Alex’s brother. When he’s in danger, he will not trust anyone or put anyone in an important position! He will only use you! In other words, he can’t find anyone he can truly trust now, so he needs to give you his power and have you do everything for him! That is until he secures his position.”

“If he secures his position, will I still be able to escape unscathed?” Edward asked Zachary.

At that time, he would just sink deeper into the hole. Once he got himself involved in politics, it would be hard for him to leave whenever he wanted to.

The best time to leave was now. If he did not get involved, nothing would happen to him.

“At the very least, you’ll be protecting the entire Swan family,” Zachary said.

Edward frowned.

“Alex is using the Swans as a threat. If you don’t help him, he will kill all the Swans!”

Edward’s expression changed, and his veins popped as he could not hide his anger.

“As they said in the old days, accompanying a king is like living with a tiger.” Zachary said, “Alex has his own responsibilities and ambitions. It’s only natural for him to use any unscrupulous means.

“This is loyalty, isn’t it?” Edward asked Zachary.

Zachary looked at Edward coldly.

“For the sake of the so-called country, you can even disregard your own family. This is what a loyal man is supposed to be, right?” Edward asked.

“Edward, forming a government has never been simple. No one can rule a country without getting their hands stained with blood. This is history!”

“But I just find it contemptuous.” Edward said, “If Alex really wants to destroy us, he can try. I won’t be threatened by him.”

“Edward!” Zachary called out to him.

“At worst, we’ll die together.”

With that, Edward left immediately.

Zachary glared at Edward leaving without hesitation. His expression was extremely unsightly.

Wade, who was at the side, did not know what to say.

Then, a figure walked out from the inner hall. It was Alex.

Zachary calmed himself down and looked at Alex with respect.

Alex said, “It seems like Edward really has a deep grudge against me.”

“He’s just not into politics,” Zachary explained.

“No, he just doesn’t know that I’ve never been the only one in the Duncans.” Alex said, “When my mother passed away, she made it very clear that half of the Duncans’ business belongs to Edward. Even if he doesn’t want it, I insist on giving it to him!”

“Actually, your mother only made you agree to give Edward a portion as compensation because she felt guilty about him. Now, since Edward doesn’t want it, you don’t have to insist on giving it to him.”

“No.” Alex smiled. “It’s not guilt. My mother knew very well that I couldn’t support the entire Duncans by myself and that I needed Edward’s help.”

Zachary chose to remain silent.

...

He was very clear that he could not help Edward in that matter. From the moment Edward was chosen to be born, it was decided that he would never be able to leave the Duncans.

“Uncle Zachary, I’ll have to trouble you to put on an act with me,” Alex said sincerely.

Zachary promised, “I’ll do my best until I die.”

Alex smiled coldly.

Edward was too emotional, and that’s why he was defeated so badly!
