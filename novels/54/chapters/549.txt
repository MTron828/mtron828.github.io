However, she did not say anything.

Instead, she heard Kingsley say, “Since Fourth Master Swan is son to Old Master Swan, he is definitely not the orphan of the Duncans, so he won’t pose too much of a threat for the time being. Therefore, the Sanders don’t have to waste too much effort or kill more people to target the Swans, but the orphan of the Duncans still exists. So, the Sanders are still looking for this person, and they’re excluding the idea that this person has a relationship with the Swans! However, from the people we’ve excluded, it’s not Finn, Edward, or Nox... Finding this person won’t be easy. In fact, no one has any clues right now. They’ve only deduced that the orphan and the heir to the emperor is alive.”

“What if it’s just an ordinary person out there?” Jeanne asked.

“Even if it’s just an ordinary person, we have to find him or her,” Kingsley affirmed.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“Right now, the Swans aren’t our target for the time being, and you don’t need to be too wary of them. Just treat Fourth Master Swan like you’re in a normal marriage. While the Sanders are looking for this orphan, I advise you to take down the Lawrences as soon as possible and get your revenge. I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle many things in the future.”

“Alright,” Jeanne replied. Then, she could not help but ask, “If the Swans have no relationship with the Duncans, will the Sanders let the Swans off?”

“That’s the Sanders decision. All we do is execute their decision.”

Jeanne pursed her lips at the last sentence.

That was right. Kingsley was actually... part of an underground organization under the Sanders.

To be more accurate, he was leading a powerful underground organization overseas. It specialized in helping the Sanders do some illegal things.

“Oh, right. I’ve arranged for someone to come over and help you,” Kingsley said.

“I know. Miles has told me.” Jeanne nodded.

Sometimes, it did not mean that more people were a good thing.

On the contrary, having more people could only mean the matter was troublesome.

“It’s a new arrangement.”

Jeanne frowned.

“You’ll be surprised.”

Who was the new person?

Jeanne wanted to ask more, but Kingsley had already hung up the call.

Kingsley could be so... annoying sometimes.

With that, Jeanne put down the phone and also thought about it.

Since Edward and Old Master Swan were father and son, were they related to the Duncan orphan?

If they were not, did the Swans grow so strong just to protect themselves?

While Jeanne was in a daze, there was a knock on the door.

Jeanne came back to her senses. “Come in.”

Forrest walked in with a document in his hands, looking a little excited. “After the sales campaign in Minze District ended earlier than expected, our online pilot project instantly blew up. The sales volume this morning was already off the charts. According to this trend, we will start covering a larger area. Then, it’ll only take three years for us to get back 2.1 billion of our company’s cost and 2.5 billion of MUK Group’s investment. And that’s just the revenue from this project. We haven’t taken into account the increase in the stock market value during this period because of the project. If we include that, we might be able to recoup our losses in two years at most.”

Compared to Forrest’s excitement, Jeanne was calm.

She had expected the results, so she was not surprised.

What she wanted now was to find a way to quickly take control of Lawrence Enterprise.

Hence, she changed the topic. “How’s the matter with the position changing within the senior management coming along?”

“There’s still no progress. None of the senior management is willing to leave their positions and try new things, so that issue has been stalled. The human resources department can’t do anything to the senior management anyway. After all, doing that would only offend the senior management, and no one is willing to do that,” Forrest explained.

“Okay, I got it,” Jeanne replied.

“Director Lawrence, are you planning to move the senior management around?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Some key positions needed to be changed.

“In that case, about this project...” Forrest did not understand how Director Lawrence could be so calm.

“Just follow what we’ve planned and hand it over to the appropriate department to execute. Report to me weekly on the progress of the implementation. Once the project is on the right track, there’s nothing to worry about.”

“Alright.”

“Is there anything else?” Jeanne asked. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Not for the time being.”

“Can you send me another copy of the list for the change of positions and the personnel information you gave me last time?”

“I’ll get it right away.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

Forrest left for more than ten minutes before he came back with the document for Jeanne.
