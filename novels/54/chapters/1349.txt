1350 The Wedding: Last Night As A Bachelor

However, Edward ignored them, and his gaze landed on Candice’s wedding dress.

Candice’s face was filled with embarrassment. She felt embarrassed for Monica!

“Oh, right.” Nox, who could never stay out of trouble, continued, “I remember now. You and Finn have broken up, so I don’t think Edward needs to answer to Finn anymore.”

At that moment, Monica really wanted to pick up a kitchen knife and kill Nox!

Why did a man like him not get struck to death by a bolt of lightning?

“You and Finn broke up?” Edward, who had been ignoring them from the start, suddenly shifted his gaze to Monica.

Monica was flustered by Edward’s gaze.

She said, “Actually, we don’t have to break up now.”

That was how spineless she was. In the face of life and death, she still believed that her life was more important.

“What? Are you going to get Finn back now?” Nox asked deliberately.

Monica glared at Nox and thought, ‘How is it that a woman hasn’t castrated him?’

“Why don’t I call Finn and tell him that Monica regrets it and wants to get back with him again? Do you want me to help you with it?” Nox smiled.

Monica told herself that she had to be patient and that she could not be angry.

She smiled. “I’ll handle my own relationship matters, Young Master Winter. You don’t have to worry about me. If you have the time, you should take more care of our Leader. He’s so busy every day, and as his most capable right-hand man, you should share his burden. Leader, you seem to have lost weight recently. You should take care of yourself.”

Nox burst out laughing at the words that came out of Monica’s mouth.

He said, “Monica, when did you become so good at being pragmatic? That’s not what you said behind Edward’s back just now. Didn’t you just say that Edward was a high-quality sc*mbag? I’m really curious. What does it mean for a scumbag to be described as high-quality?”

What did that mean? It meant he was a sc*mbag among sc*mbags!

“You heard wrong. I was talking about quality men. Sc*mbag? Isn’t that you? How can you use it on the Leader?” Monica lied through her teeth.

Nox’s expression changed a little. “Who’s a sc*mbag? I’ve turned over a new leaf, and I’m determined to become a good man! Don’t go around slandering me!”

Monica’s contempt toward Nox was obvious.

“I say, Monica–”

“Oh, look at the time. It’s a little late, and I have a dinner party to attend tonight.” Monica suddenly said with an exaggerated expression.

Nox rolled his eyes.

If Monica would like to put on a show, he would be her guest.

“Um, Candice.” Monica looked at Candice with an overly amicable expression. “I still have something to do, so I’ll be on my way now.”

Candice nodded. “Alright.”

She, too, knew that Monica wanted nothing more than to disappear from Edward’s sight.

“You look really beautiful in your wedding dress, and it matches the Leader very well. I wish you a happy and long-lasting marriage in advance,” Monica said against her conscience.

Having said it out loud, even she looked down on herself.

Nox, on the other hand, smiled brightly. However, he had to say that Monica had really changed a lot.

If it were the old Monica, who had not experienced anything back then, even if she was caught red-handed, she would have fought him head-on instead of fawning as she was now.

For some reason, he missed the silly and naive girl she used to be. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone looked at Monica as she fled.

After Monica left, Nox also left. He knew that he would be a third wheel by staying there.

In fact, he did not know how Edward felt about Candice because he knew that the person Edward liked was still Jeanne.

However, Edward was willing to marry Candice from the bottom of his heart, unlike Susan Gates, whom he married purely for the sake of benefits.

He hoped that Edward would really fall in love with Candice.

Edward had been alone for so many years.

All everyone could see was Edward’s powerful and glamorous side, but no one knew the suffering he was going through deep down in his heart.

No one knew that a drunk Edward would shout Jeanne’s name again and again.

After Nox and Monica left, Candice felt a little uncomfortable, especially under Edward’s gaze. Ever since she arrived, his gaze had been on her, making her a little uneasy.

“Are you going to pick this one?” Edward was calm.
