Chapter 521: Monica Swayed By Her Emotions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn was speechless at how shameless Monica could be.

She had been kissed a thousand times, yet she still thought she was reserved, huh?

Where did she get the confidence to say she was a decent woman?

However, Monica did not care what Finn thought of her and suddenly asked him in a serious tone, “Do you like me?”

Finn was taken aback.

“I like you so much. Do you like me as well?” Monica did not even blink as she looked straight at Finn.

Something moved in Finn’s eyes.

In the quiet room, Monica’s heart seemed to be beating a little faster, and so did Finn’s.

Amid the sudden silence, Finn said, “Come closer.”

Monica was stunned for a second, but she obediently moved her butt so that she was much closer to Finn.

Now, Finn’s face was close to Monica’s, so close that if they moved forward a little more, their lips would touch.

Monica’s gaze was fixed on his lips. She found that she had been easily seduced by him recently and subconsciously licked her lips erotically.

Finn could feel his face burning at that moment.

However, he forced himself to remain calm and pointed at Monica’s heart with his index finger. “Can’t you feel it?”

“Huh?” Monica was lost in her thoughts, with all her attention on Finn’s seductive lips.

“Liking isn’t something you say.” Finn enunciated each word. “It’s something you feel here.”

Monica was stunned.

Although she felt her heart trembling, her entire body would tremble if Finn really did seduce her.

However, she did not agree with Finn. She felt that if she liked someone, she should say it out loud, and those who did not say it out loud were... sultry!

Finn was sultry, but coincidentally, she was the opposite. Whatever he did not dare to do, she would do it for him.

That was why Monica suddenly hugged Finn’s neck, forcing him to come closer to her and kiss him deeply.

Finn seemed to have gotten used to her kiss as well.

The moment her lips landed on his, she did not hesitate to open her lips and... kiss him deeply.

…

The next day, Finn did a full medical checkup. If nothing was wrong, he could go ahead with the discharge procedures.

Monica went along with Finn.

She did not know why, but when she saw all the medical devices on Finn’s body, she would get nervous. She could still remember the image of when he was in the intensive care unit. At that time, she thought Finn was going to die, which pained her to see.

Hence, seeing all the medical devices on Finn made her terrified.

She accompanied him for most of the morning, but because some medical checkup did not allow her to go in, she waited anxiously at the door.

After waiting for a long while, the sound of hurried footsteps suddenly came from the corridor.

Monica turned around, only to see Reese, who looked like she was on the verge of breaking down.

It was clear that she was panicking.

Monica even thought Reese might fall the next second because she was walking so fast.

As such, Monica could not help but step forward. “Auntie.”

Reese looked at Monica as if she saw a life-saver. “Monica, Monica, I finally found you.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What’s wrong, Auntie?” Monica was startled by Reese’s appearance.

“Michael, Michael... Something has happened to Michael.” Reese was slurring a little.

“What’s wrong?” Monica was shocked.

What had happened to Michael?

Michael was just fine yesterday, was he not? What happened?

“He got into a serious car accident and is currently being sent to the emergency room. However, he refuses to go in... and I can’t get him to go and get himself treated either. He has lost so much blood. If it goes on, the doctor said he might die. I’m begging you. Please, can you help me persuade Michael? I’m begging you–”

“I’ll go right away. I’ll go with you.” Monica could not care about anything else at that moment as she left with Reese in a hurry.

She did not think Michael would get into a car accident.

If something really happened to Michael, she might feel guilty for the rest of her life.
