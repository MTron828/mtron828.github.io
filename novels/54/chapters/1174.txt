1175 Chester’s Ambition Exposed

Jeanne followed Warren and was prepared to leave through the secret passage when suddenly, Warren said to Mason, who was beside Jeanne, “He’ll stay!”

Mason had always been by Jeanne’s side, so naturally, it was the same at this moment. No matter what happened, his only mission was to protect Jeanne.

However, it was obvious that Warren was wary of Mason.

Without hesitation, Jeanne agreed. “Mason, you can stay behind and command the assassins of the Hills.”

“Jeanne!” Mason refused.

Jeanne gave him a look.

Mason gritted his teeth and quickly turned around to leave!

The moment he left, Warren aimed his gun at Mason’s back and was about to shoot. It was obvious that he wanted to silence Mason to prevent him from exposing his escape route.

However, Jeanne covered Warren’s gun with her hand. “I swear on my life that he will never betray us!”

Warren did not seem to have much time to waste. Hence, he put down the gun, turned around, and quickly walked into the passageway.

Jeanne secretly heaved a sigh of relief, adjusted her emotions, and followed behind!

After exiting the passageway, they arrived at a remote road far away from the Sanders’ residence. It was a place that ordinary people would not be able to find, and at that moment, a few cars were already parked there.

Warren’s bodyguard opened the door for him and let him in. Then, Jeanne and Chester followed suit.

As the car sped away, Jeanne turned around and looked at the Sanders’ residence from afar. She could hear the countless gunshots.

In the car, Warren’s expression was grave.

He had never expected that he would lose what he was so close to having. In fact, he had never thought that William would even bribe the guards at the Sanders’ residence.

Did that mean William had bribed a lot of the Sanders’ officials as well?

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

Warren gritted his teeth and picked up the phone to make a call. He ordered coldly, “Send all the troops to the Sanders’ residence and capture the descendant of the Duncans.”

“Yes!” the other party replied respectfully.

Then, Warren continued to make a few calls to give instructions. In order to balance the situation, a few people had control over the Sanders’ military power!

After the call, the car fell silent. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Chester could not help but ask, “Father, where are we now?”

Warren turned around and looked at Chester. “Just follow my arrangements.”

At that point, he was so cautious that he did not even trust his own son.

Chester endured it for a while and chose to remain silent.

Jeanne, too, remained silent, and she turned to look out of the window at the pitch-black night sky.

The road they were currently on was not the main road of South Hampton City. There were even trees around them, so it should be a relatively remote place.

The car was moving at a constant speed, which meant that Warren already had a destination in mind. In other words, Warren had planned out his escape route should an accident happen.

Jeanne sat in the car quietly, with no idea where they would end up!

About half an hour later, the car stopped at a flat and desolate place, where a helicopter was parked.

It meant that Warren would leave in a helicopter. No matter what the situation was, his first reaction was to ensure his own safety.

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smirk.

As expected, it was not easy to kill Warren.

It was no wonder Kingsley never dared to make a move. He probably knew that the old fox was not so easy to kill.

Jeanne followed Warren and got out of the car.

Chester also followed her out of the car and walked toward the helicopter.

Just as he had walked over, he stood in front of Warren. “Father, are you leaving just like that?”

Warren’s expression darkened, and he looked at Chester coldly. “Move!”

“Quinn, Justin, and Stacey are still in the Sanders’ residence. Are we just going to leave like this?” Chester questioned Warren.

In terms of human nature, even though Chester was easily jealous and had his own selfish motives, he had not lost his conscience.

At that moment, his dissatisfaction with Warren’s actions was exposed!

“Didn’t I just order someone to save them and capture the remaining members of the Duncans? Or do you think I should go back and risk my life?” Warren said righteously, “I’m the leader of a country. My life is more important than anyone else’s! No one can be a threat to me!”
