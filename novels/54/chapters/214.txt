Chapter 215: Slap Eden in the Face and Infuriate Melody

Facing the reporters, Eden replied, “I’m happy for Jeanne to be able to clear her name. As for her being able to develop so well, I’m also happy for her. Before I entered the court, I said that I felt guilty. Now that I see her like this, I don’t have to feel guilty anymore.”

“Mrs. Swan, regarding Jeanne suddenly becoming so outstanding and the huge gap between the two of you, do you have anything to say about this? I heard that you’re more favored among the Lawrences. After this, will you lose favor?” A reporter asked directly.

Jasmine tried her best to smile. “We’re a family, so how can there be a gap between us? How can one be favored over the others? My parents treat everyone equally. Don’t listen to rumors.”

“The gap is obvious. You’re a typical housewife now, Mrs. Swan, whereas Jeanne has become a businesswoman. It’s an unusually big difference!” A reporter spoke sharply.

“Everyone has different pursuits. I just hope that I can be by Eden’s side, take care of him, and then give birth to his children. My sister might want to develop her career. Everyone has different pursuits, so we naturally gain different things in life. I now have a beautiful marriage, and I feel very happy.”

“Are you implying that Jeanne isn’t happy at the moment?”

“Of course not.” Jasmine did not admit it, but that was what she was thinking internally.

She had to let herself benefit from something.

“In fact, Jeanne is now thriving in her love and career. In Harken, there’s probably no bachelor as valuable as Fourth Master Swan. Now that Fourth Master Swan has clearly stated that he’s dating Jeanne, don’t you think you’re just being jealous, Mrs. Swan?” The reporter hit the nail on the head.

Jasmine could not hold it in any longer, “I already said that I didn’t mean that. What I meant was that I’m very happy now. I didn’t say that Jeanne isn’t happy in her relationship. I only said that I’m very satisfied with my life now. I’ve never liked to compete with others for anything since I was young. Now that Jeanne has developed this far, I’m happy for her. How can I be jealous?!”

“If you’ve never fought for anything since you were young, how did you snatch Eden away from Jeanne?” The reporter continued to question closely.

At this moment, he was deliberately creating conflicts to make the news more valuable.

“Y-you...” Jasmine’s eyes were red with anxiety. At this moment, tears started to fall from her eyes. She looked extremely aggrieved/ “I’m clearly in love with Eden. Why do you have to slander us like this?”

“I just feel that your words are a little incomprehensible. As a reporter, I just want to convey facts to the general public. I’m sorry for making things difficult for you, Mrs. Swan,” the reporter apologized.

Nonetheless, he did not sound sorry at all.

“Eden, let’s go,” Jasmine said pitifully, “I’m really scared. I’m afraid that my words will be misunderstood by them.”

At this moment, Eden wanted to dump Jasmine aside and leave.

He was tired of seeing Jasmine’s pitiful look.

Eden watched Jeanne and the others get into the car from afar. He saw her toughness that she did not deliberately show. This was something that Jasmine could not compare. In particular, Jasmine’s tears were worthless to Eden at this moment.

At the end of the day, Eden was stupid back then, which was why he was seduced by Jasmine and even married her in the end.

He even felt that he should not have chosen Jasmine even if Jeanne was not in the picture.

Jasmine was worthless to him at the moment and was even hindering him from his bright future!

Even so, in front of the reporters, Eden could only smile. He hugged Jasmine and said, “Don’t be afraid. With me around, no one will bully you. I’ll bring you home.”

Eden acted unusually gentle.

It looked like the two of them were in love.

For a second, the reporters felt that the two of them were really close.

Despite that, they had seen too many couples who pretended to be in love. Many famous people looked like they were in love in public before their divorce was revealed. Once they announced a divorce, one could see how viciously they would try to tear each other apart!

Eden took Jasmine and left forcefully.

Joshua followed behind them.

Melody and Michael were the ones who came out of the court after everyone had left.

Melody’s expression was ugly.

Michael knew how she felt at that moment, so he did not take the initiative to speak.

He sent Melody to the car outside the court and opened the car door for her politely.

The moment Melody got into the car, she turned to look at Michael. “What do you think of Jeanne?”

“She’s very powerful and mysterious,” Michael said bluntly.

“So you think that it’s difficult for me to deal with her now?”

“I suggest that you don’t act rashly!” Michael said, “Mel, you can’t be too hasty. Without knowing Jeanne’s background, you mustn’t take the risk again. Lunetta was smart enough to know that they would all be sentenced, so she chose to faint in court. Adrian also saw the situation clearly. Otherwise, you might’ve been implicated already!”

Melody’s eyes narrowed, “I won’t be implicated.”

“Maybe not, but once Eden is implicated, you’ll lose one person to help you. It’ll be your loss!”

“Eden, that trash!” Melody looked down on Eden.

“Mel, it’s not that Eden is trash, but Jeanne is too powerful. You have to admit this, or you would still suffer losses like today,” Michael consoled her sincerely.

“You mean that I just can’t win against Jeanne. You’re asking me to let go!”

“My personal opinion is that you’d better give up on the idea of marrying Fourth Master Swan. Fourth Master Swan has made it clear whether in private or in public. He likes Jeanne and will be with her. He did it as if he had completely turned down the marriage alliance between the Swans and the Sanders. If you continue to do this, you’ll only be...” Michael paused for a moment.

It was as if he was looking for a better adjective.

“Humiliate myself?” Melody said straightforwardly.

Michael pursed his lips.

Silence was acquiescence.

Melody sneered. “Jeanne Lawrence, someone I don’t care about at all, actually made me suffer like this! I’ve never been so aggrieved! Since I was young, I’ve always been the one who bullied others. Regardless of whether they’re my brothers or sisters, as long as they harm me, I have a way to make them suffer. Now, Jeanne made me suffer like this!”

“There’s always someone better than you. Mel, you should learn to acknowledge the abilities of others.”

“Enough.” Melody could not listen anymore.

If it were not for Michael, she would have fallen out with that person long ago.

“Honest advice is hard to hear,” Michael said, “You must think about it carefully.”.

Melody directly got into the car and slammed the car door.

Michael looked at Melody, who could not hide her anger, and watched the car leave.

If Melody did not calm down, she might... lose miserably. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She might end up in a miserable state.

Of course.

Melody was such a proud person. How could she just let this go?

She would not let Jeanne have it so easy.

Melody could not accept Jeanne and Edward being together.

She gritted her teeth, and a trace of viciousness flashed in her eyes.

She did not believe that she could not defeat Jeanne.

At this moment, her phone suddenly rang.

Melody’s expression changed slightly. She picked up the phone and tensed up when she saw the caller ID.

She calmed herself down and answered, “Dad.”

“Where are you?”An extremely serious voice came from the other side.

Facing her father, she could only remain joyful.

At this moment, Melody smiled slightly and answered, “On the streets of South Hampton City. Didn’t you ask me to go to the places where the people live and understand their situation? Whenever I have time, I would come out to take a look.”

“Did you go to watch Jeanne’s lawsuit?” The other party asked bluntly.

Melody’s expression changed slightly.

How could a noble person like her dad mention Jeanne, a slut?

Jeanne was not worthy at all!

“Answer me!” The other party’s tone became even harsher.

Melody pursed her lips. “I dropped by to have a look. I heard that many people are concerned about the lawsuit. I only did it to be closer to the people—”

“You know the consequences if I find out that Jeanne’s case has something to do with you!” The person on the other side threatened Melody.

Melody gritted her teeth.

“Come back immediately!”

“Understood.” Melody could only obey her dad.

Her dad abruptly hung up the phone.

Melody had a grim look on her face.

How could Jeanne make her dad interrogate her?!

On what basis?!
