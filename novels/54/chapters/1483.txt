Chapter 1484: Monica Suspects Candice’s Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Chloe carefully pushed George to the side of the pool, afraid that George would push her down.

Children nowadays were naughty and evil, and he could do anything to her. More importantly, it might not cause him any harm because he was the heir of the Leader. Who would dare to hurt him?

With that thought, Chloe became even more cautious, and George seemed to be able to sense it too.

Nevertheless, he did not behave differently. He just sat quietly in his wheelchair and said, “You often bully Candice, don’t you?”

Chloe was stunned, but she Imew that George was up to no good.

She quickly said, “How is that possible? Candice is my sister. How could I bully her? Everyone knows we’re close.”

“Is that so?” George sneered.

“It’s true. If our relationship wasn’t good, why would I treat you and Paige like this? I also hope that by treating you well, you’ll treat my sister better and integrate her better into your family. Maybe you’ve misunderstood me, George.” Chloe sounded like she had been wronged.

“But I heard you caused Candice’s acting accident a few years ago,” George said bluntly.

Chloe’s face turned green with fear.

She immediately denied it. “How could it be me? She was the one who didn’t feel well and didn’t complete the difficult move. How could I have caused the accident when she was practicing such a highly skilled thing? Who has been the one gossiping and spouting such nonsense?”

“Don’t you know whether I’m talking nonsense or not?” George’s eyes were cold.

“George, you really shouldn’t believe what others say. Think about it. No matter how capable I am, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything to those planes when my sister was practicing, right?”

“Yes, but you could’ve done something to Candice.”

Chloe was stunned.

“You could’ve added sleeping pills to the juice you gave Candice,” George said casually.

“George, don’t talk nonsense!” Chloe’s body was trembling.

How did George know about what happened back then? He was 10 years old now, so how old was George when the accident happened? How could he know about those things?

Of course, George would not tell her that he had been investigating Candice’s past over the past few days. When he saw her glorious achievements, he was pretty surprised as to why the usually stable Candice would make a mistake in a drill. According to the probability, it was almost impossible. Therefore, he went back to investigate that mistake.

George hacked into the official website and found out everything about the accident. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with her body, he hacked into the hospital where Candice had been treated. He found Candice’s medical records and found that there was a certain concentration of sleeping pills in Candice’s blood. Obviously, that was the reason why Candice made a mistake during the drill.

Since the doctor had found out the truth, why did he not announce it publicly? Anyone could tell that he was deliberately trying to hide it.

Logically speaking, it was impossible to hide something related to the country unless the person who drugged Candice was very important to the Nicholsons and could not be announced. After giving it some thought, he figured it could only be Chloe.

In order to verify his guess, George went to check Chloe’s whereabouts back then. He found out that Chloe was indeed by Candice’s side during the drill. He also asked around and confirmed that Chloe had always been jealous of Candice. She had always liked to snatch Candice’s things since she was young, so he was certain about his conclusion.

However, it was one thing to conclude his findings but another to prove it with evidence. Since there was no evidence to accuse Chloe of what she had done back then, it was impossible to send Chloe to prison through legal means.

Of course, George did not have so much free time on his hands to care about such things. He was just afraid that Candice, that old woman, would die at Chloe’s hands before she could Imow the truth.

He heard that Candice had lost her memory and could not remember a lot of things. Hence, she probably did not know how Chloe treated her back then.

Now, Chloe was acting all innocent and deliberately trying to please her, yet Candice was kind enough to accept her!
