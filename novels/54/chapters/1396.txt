Chapter 1397: Nox and Shelly Meet Again

If Shelly had not seen it with her own eyes, she could never imagine that Nox would be like that at work.

Attracted by his aura, everyone looked at Nox.

“Firstly, this is the most high-class restaurant on the island. We’ve injected a lot of cultural ideas into the island, but I don’t see the embodiment of these cultures in the restaurant. In fact, this place makes me feel no different than being in all the other high-class restaurants in South Hampton City.

“Secondly, there’s nothing special about the food here. Although the taste is alright, it doesn’t feel like a local specialty and won’t leave a deep impression on people. Even if you want to promote it, you won’t be able to create the hype.”

“Thirdly, I don’t recommend the staff here to wear formal attire. People come here to relax, and being too formal will make people feel depressed. At least, I don’t feel like I’m coming to the island to relax!”

Those comments made Danny sweat profusely, but he quickly agreed. “Alright. We’ll change it again. ”

“The trial opening is on the 16th of next month. I don’t want to see anything that I’m not satisfied with on that day,” Nox said coldly.

“Alright, alright. I will do everything perfectly.” Danny was practically trying to curry favor.

Nox wiped his lips and got up from the dining table. Then, he said bluntly, “Arrange a tour guide for me.”

“Yes.” Danny gave the staff member beside him a look.

Shelly walked out.

When she first applied to be a tour guide here, she did not know that the Winter Enterprise was involved in the development of that place.

All she saw at that time was the high-paying job in the recruitment advertisement. She just wanted to give it a try but did not expect to be hired. After she was accepted, she had to go through a period of intense training.

Today, the first tour guide she received was to take the big boss on a tour of the entire island, but she did not expect the boss to be Nox. If she had known, she might have gotten someone else to do it.

It had been so many years, and she had never thought that she would have anything to do with Nox again. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

She braced herself and walked up to Nox. “Hello, Mr. Winter. I’m your personal tour guide today, and you can call me Irene.”

It was just a random name that she had thought of.

Nox glanced at Shelly and did not pay much attention to her. He strode in front and said to the others, “You don’t have to come with us.”

It meant that other than the tour guide, no one else should follow.

With that, Shelly followed Nox out.

She took a deep breath and began to explain, “Hello, Mr. Winter. Welcome to Kylin Island. The reason why this island is called Kylin is mainly because of the overall shape of the island. You can look straight ahead now, and right in front of you is the head of the Kylin on the island. If you look carefully, there’s an arc-shaped shape at the end of the sea. That’s the Kylin’s eye. We call it the window of the world—”

“Shelly,” Nox suddenly called out to her.

Shelly suddenly stopped talking.

In the end, he still recognized her.

She pursed her lips and looked at Nox, who was also looking at her from above. The two of them just stared at each other, but Shelly did not feel inferior because of his imposing presence.

“Why are you here as a tour guide?” Nox asked, “Aren’t you in school?”

“No,” Shelly replied.

Nox’s eyes widened in disbelief when he heard the answer.

“I haven’t been to school since I graduated from high school,” Shelly said bluntly.

“Why not?” Nox was surprised.

“I couldn’t take the college entrance examination, so I stopped.”

“Didn’t I tell you to take the college entrance examination in the second year?”

“I lost interest in the second year.”

“Shelly, what are you doing?” Nox suddenly became annoyed.

“Don’t worry, I don’t blame you. It was my choice.”

“Your choice? What? Do you think you’re so great just because you’ve changed your appearance?” Nox’s eyes were red at that moment. He was clearly a little angry.

Shelly pursed her lips tightly.

Yes, she had plastic surgery on her eyes, nose, and even her lower jaw. In short, she had done something to her face.

If it were not someone familiar with her, they probably would not be able to recognize her. That was why she thought that Nox would not be able to recognize her.

“Why do you need plastic surgery?!” Nox asked her.

“Every woman has the right to look beautiful, so why can’t I?”

“So, you took the money I gave you and did this instead of going to school?’ Nox asked her coldly..
