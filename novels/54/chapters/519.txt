Chapter 520: Monica Swayed By Her Emotions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Her eyes narrowed.

Before she came, Michael had already instructed her not to let Monica feel the slightest bit of disgust, regardless of whether the negotiations ended or not. Thus, even though she was feeling extremely aggrieved, she still held it in and did not throw a tantrum at Monica.

She gritted her teeth, got up, and left.

Once she was in her car, she called her son. “Michael.”

“How did it go?”

“She refuses to do it,” Reese said, and her expression turned even uglier. “I never thought Monica would be so decisive. She even said indifferently that she has nothing to do with you anymore. The person she has liked all along is Finn.”

“Alright. I got it.”

“Michael.” Reese hurriedly stopped him. “If we can’t change Monica’s mind, can you explain it to the President?”

“No.” Michael replied bluntly, “The President was very straightforward to say that if I don’t have Monica and Cardellini Medical Technology, he won’t help stabilize the situation for the Rosses. In other words, if I fail, the President will give up on us. By then... What will happen to our family will depend on natural selection.”

“To think your father was so loyal to the President back then. Once we’re useless to himself, he sure is cruel,” Reese said fiercely.

“If he’s not cruel, he wouldn’t have been able to keep his current position.” Michael’s eyes narrowed.

“In that case, what should we do now? I think Monica is determined not to be with you anymore!” Reese was furious.

“She will, and I will make sure of it.”

Reese was still in disbelief.

“As to what to do next, just follow my orders.”

He would make Monica be with him.

No matter what cruel methods he used, Monica would be his!

…

When Monica returned to the ward, the other doctors had already left, and Finn had also got down from the bed. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Now that Finn could walk around for longer, it meant his body was recovering quickly.

The doctor said he had to stay in the hospital for another two days and do a full medical checkup. If nothing went wrong, he could get discharged from the hospital.

Monica really wanted to leave the hospital.

Although the environment here was nice, it was not as comfortable as her home.

Moreover, the fact that Finn could leave the hospital would mean his body was recovering.

According to the doctor, Finn’s recovery was much faster than they had expected. They initially thought he would be in the hospital for at least a month, but now it seemed that he could be discharged a week earlier.

If that was the case, would they be able to have s*x sooner?

Monica walked over intimately and supported Finn. However, as soon as she held him, her crutches fell.

Finn was speechless.

Who was taking care of whom?

With that, he slowly squatted down and picked Monica up. “You should take care of yourself first.”

Monica pursed her lips.

It seemed like Finn really did not trust her.

“Where did you go just now?” Finn asked.

“Mind your own business.” Monica’s tone was unpleasant.

This time, Finn pursed his lips when he saw Monica looking unhappy.

However, he suddenly reached his hand out.

Monica was stunned.

“Don’t you want my help?”

Monica hurriedly held Finn’s hand, feeling very loved.

Once the two of them finally sat down on the sofa after some struggle, Monica said, “Michael’s mother came to look for me just now.”

Finn’s hand, which was holding a glass of water, paused.

Monica said, “Michael has been having a hard time recently, so she wanted me to help Michael, but I refused. I can’t get involved with Michael just because I feel sympathy for him. This will only make us suffer. Although I feel guilty toward Michael, I think the best way for us to forget about each other is to cut contact.”

Finn kept quiet as he was thinking about something.

Nox said he should beware of Michael, and it seemed like he really should pay attention to that.

Since Monica did not get a response from Finn, she frowned. “Did I do something wrong?”

Finn snapped back to his senses.

“You should at least praise me for understanding the situation so well.”

“It’s quite rare,” Finn said straightforwardly.

“Actually, I don’t understand something.” Monica looked at Finn and said seriously, “I know who I like, and that person is you, so I don’t want anything to do with other men! With that said, when did I become such a decent woman? I’m clearly a modern and liberal woman. How did I become so reserved? As expected, I’m a good woman with good values.”
