Chapter 348: Madam, Missus, Wife, or Jeannie?

“Call me Ed.”

However, she could not bring herself to say it.

She felt that word had become very erotic because of what they did last night. Moreover, she found the word Ed too intimate, and she would not be used to saying it.

“Say it to me.” Having not received a reply, a certain someone started to make his request.

“Fourth Master.”

Edward frowned, and the next second, he said firmly, “Ed.”

“Fourth Master.”

“Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne looked at him, speechless. She found Fourth Master Swan very childish sometimes.

“So you want me to call you Ms. Lawrence the entire time?” Edward raised his eyebrows as if saying, ‘If you don’t change the way you call me, I won’t to you either.’

That was childish.

Jeanne gritted her teeth as she opened her mouth to say, “Edward.”

Edward raised his eyebrows.

......

“You didn’t agree when I told you to call me Jeanne either! In that case, let’s compromise, Edward!” Jeanne’s tone did not allow for any rebuttal.

Edward chuckled at Jeanne’s temper and nodded. He could not reject any of the short-tempered Jeanne’s requests anyway.

Then, the two of them lowered their heads and ate.

Since Jeanne was feeling a little full, she slowed down and ate more politely.

“What plans do you have next?” At the quiet dining table, Edward asked.

“Hm?” Jeanne did not quite understand his question.

“Do you have anything important to attend to for the next few days?” Edward became impatient. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Fourth Master–” Jeanne pursed her lips. “Edward.”

“Yes.” The person whose name was called had a bright smile on his face.

What was there to be happy about being called his name?

“Do you have any plans?” Jeanne asked.

“If you don’t, I do.”

“I have to go to work.” Only then did Jeanne understand him.

She really did have to go to work.

The e-commerce project was still in the pilot stage, and the progress could not be delayed. Once that matter was settled, she would have to make a move at the senior management of the Lawrence Enterprise.

If she wanted to control an enterprise, besides having enough shares, she also had to buy the hearts of all the people and control the operation of the entire enterprise.

Edward did not answer, which to Jeanne was acquiescence. Hence, she naturally did not say anything more.

After dinner, Jeanne spent time with George chatting on the open-air balcony in Bamboo Garden.

Edward did not disturb their mother-son time either and watched TV in the hall.

However, from time to time, he would take a few glances outside.

“It must have been difficult last night,” Jeanne said to George.

George bit his lip.

In fact, he did feel pretty upset.

“I didn’t know Fourth Master Swan would send you to Old Master Swan’s place.” Jeanne looked at her son helplessly.

If she had known earlier, she would have stopped Edward.

“Actually...” George wanted to say something but stopped.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“Grandpa Swan was good to me,” George suddenly said.

“Huh?” Jeanne was surprised.

George was usually not one to judge a person.

“He read me a fairytale last night,” George said.

Jeanne found it a little unbelievable. No matter how hard she tried, she could not think of such a scene.

“Although I don’t think it was a good story, but...” George bit his lips. “I think he’s very attentive.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne would not have believed what he said if she did not hear it with her own ears.

“Yes.” George nodded again.

Jeanne’s heart did a flip.

However, it would not expect less of the shrewd Swans.

She smiled faintly.

“Mom, will we leave this place? Will you leave Fourth Master Swan?” George was still a child, after all, so there were some things that he could not keep to himself.

Jeanne fell silent, not knowing how to reply.

“You really like Fourth Master Swan, right?” George was very certain.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She said, “George, feelings are not the only thing. If I have to decide, I will choose how to protect us!”

George did not quite understand what she said.

After that, Jeanne stood up from the sofa and said, “It’s getting late. It’s time to go to bed.”

“Okay.” George did not ask any further as he was not one who would ask a lot of questions

Jeanne held George’s hand.

In the hall, Edward was still watching television, and when he saw them come in, his gaze fell on them.

“Fourth... Edward, I’ll tuck George in bed.”

Edward nodded.

Jeanne held George’s hand and brought him upstairs. After she accompanied him to wash up, George lay on the huge bed.

“Do you need me to stay with you till you’ve fallen asleep?” Jeanne asked George while pulling the blanket up for him.

George shook his head.

Jeanne knew that George was a very independent child

Hence, she bent down and planted a kiss on George’s forehead. “Good night.”
