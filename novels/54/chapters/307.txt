Chapter 308: Edward Agrees to Get Married

At the airport, Jeanne brought George and Miles to the security checkpoint. Soon, they were at the VIP lounge waiting for their flight, waiting to board the plane.

After that, they would leave this place behind.

Jeanne looked at the time.

She was actually a little nervous. Before they left, she could not relax, and if they really left…

She would still have feelings for him.

Quietly, she watched as the minutes ticked past.

“Mom,” George suddenly said.

At that, Jeanne turned her head to look at him.

George said, “Are we going to leave South Hampton City for real this time?”

Jeanne smiled. “As you wish, we’ll be leaving this time. I don’t think we’ll ever come back.”

“Oh.”George nodded.

When he nodded, he did not seem very happy. It looked as if he wanted to say something but did not in the end.

In the waiting room, a staff member walked in and said respectfully, “Miss Lawrence, it’s time to board the plane.”

......

Jeanne nodded in acknowledgment.

Then, she held George’s hand and followed the staff member out.

That was when they saw a group of people suddenly walking into the waiting room.

They were dressed in black suits, and it looked like there were at least ten of them.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed, and at that moment, Miles also felt threatened.

The two of them looked at the person in front of them warily.

As both parties faced each other, Jeanne’s expression shifted.

Was it... Fourth Master Swan’s people again?

She gritted her teeth.

This time, she decided she would fight head-on.

Her eyes narrowed, and just as she was about to strike back, the phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne paused for a moment, to which the person in the black suit said, “Miss Lawrence, please pick up the phone.”

Jeanne frowned.

The other party seemed to have a strong aura but no intention of fighting with her.

She picked up the phone, glanced at it, and picked it up. “Kingsley.”

“Are you at the airport?” Kingsley asked.

“I’m preparing to board the plane, but I’m in a bit of a situation,” she said straightforwardly.

“I know,” Kingsley said, clearly understanding.

His tone was also very cold.

“What do you mean?” Jeanne felt that something was amiss.

Could it be that the people in front of her had nothing to do with Fourth Master Swan but Kingsley instead?

“Stay in South Hampton City.” Kingsley did not beat around the bush.

“Why?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows. “Weren’t you the one who said you don’t want me to stay here?”

“That was a week ago.”

Jeanne did not quite understand.

“In short, you can’t leave now.”

“Kingsley...”

“Stay in South Hampton City and marry Fourth Master Swan.” Kingsley’s tone was very cold.

What? She was speechless!

“I’ve said before, Melody is not the only one in the Sanders. With Melody dead, another person will replace her. Since Melody can’t marry Fourth Master Swan, you will marry him.” Kingsley made sure to pause between every sentence.

“Why?” Jeanne’s eyes turned cold, and her expression was grave. “It’s the Sanders’ problem that they don’t have Melody anymore. If they want to nurture another Melody, they should nurture one of the Sanders. Why should I be the one to replace her?”

“There is no reason why!” Kingsley did not give Jeanne any explanation at all.

“What if I refuse?!” Jeanne asked grimly.

“You can’t refuse.” Kingsley’s tone was firm, and he said coldly, “This is an order.”

Jeanne’s hand that was holding the phone tightened even more.

At the end of the day, she was just one of Kingsley’s professional killers.

Whatever he ordered her to do, she had to do it and obey him unconditionally.

She bit her lips and did not answer.

“Before the mission is completed, you can’t come back,” Kingsley added. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After that, he was about to hang up the phone.

“Yet, you still want me to seduce him,” Jeanne enunciated each word.

He had once said that he would not let her do such a thing.

The other end of the phone went silent for a few seconds.

Then, he said, “Jeanne, this was your choice.”

Jeanne sneered.

Yes, everything was her choice.

Her birth, her experiences, and everything she was experiencing now was her choice.

She said, “Yes.”

No one had ever dared to resist Kingsley’s orders, including her.

Her promise made Kingsley silent for a long, long time.

After that, the other end hung up, and Jeanne also put down her phone.

She looked at the group of people in front of her and slowly lowered her head to say to George, “We can’t leave anymore.”

George frowned.

Miles was also very surprised.

Jeanne said, “Kingsley has asked us to stay. I’m sorry to disappoint you.”

George raised his little face and looked at her without saying anything.

“Miles, we have to stay in South Hampton City for the time being,” Jeanne said to Miles.

Miles did not care.

He was just carrying out a mission anyway.
