1270 Edward’s Rise and Alex’s Defeat

Edward walked out of the delivery room.

Many people were waiting for him at the door.

They were waiting for him to come out before they entered.

They walked past Edward coldly.

Edward’s throat moved slightly.

He was holding back all his emotions as he watched the group of people walk in.

There was a click and the door shut heavily.

So heavy the people inside and outside were completely separated.

“Fourth Master.” At the doorway, Dr. Jones was calling him.

At this moment, he was holding a small baby in his hand.

The baby stopped crying, with red cheeks and eyes opened surveying the world outside.

To her, it was a fresh world.

Edward turned his eyes to look at Dr. Jones.

Dr. Jones’s eyes moved slightly.

A person’s sadness, tremendous sadness, was infectious.

Dr. Jones did not know how much strength Edward used to hold back everything he was now enduring.

He could only imagine.

He saw that Fourth Master Swan was no longer the man he used to be.

The man now could hold the sky even if it was falling.

Dr. Jones asked in a low voice, “Want to carry her?”

Edward laid his eyes on his daughter, who was being held in Dr. Jones’s arms.

He reached out and took his daughter, whom Jeanne had just desperately given birth to, and held her in his arms.

Soft and gentle.

He wished she could no longer see the world clearly, keeping her eyes clean and pure.

He did not know how to explain to her later why she had no mother.

He held his daughter, step by step, and left the waiting room.

One step at a time, he was leaving Jeanne behind.

“Fourth Master.” Dr. Jones swiftly aided Edward.

Edward’s body was half-kneeling at this moment.

Because there was too much grief, he finally collapsed!

...

Half an hour later, Jeanne’s body was sent away secretly.

With Edward still unconscious, she was sent away.

She was buried next to her mother, Penelope Thorn.

A grave was erected “In memory of Jeanne Lawrence, daughter of Sanders”.

Daughter of the Sander family.

No.

Edward’s wife.

The tombstone was made in advance.

Alex ordered someone to make it for Jeanne.

The words on the tombstone were also shown to Edward in advance.

Alex said that it could be changed but he did not change because he thought it was not worth it.

She was not worthy of having his name by her side, afraid that she might taint him in the afterlife.

Half a month after Jeanne’s death, George returned home.

He finally met his sister, Paige.

She was half a month old and had grown a little chubbier than when she was a newborn. She was even more beautiful now.

George reached out to hold Paige’s little hand and she instinctively gripped onto his fingers tightly.

He was smiling in a pleasant surprise.

He suddenly felt at that moment that all the injuries he had sustained were no longer important.

He vowed that he would become very strong, strong enough to keep his sister from getting hurt even a little.

After meeting Paige, his dad took him and went to see his mom.

He did not know what was the reason to see his mother to go to a place so remote that there was no house.

However, he still quietly followed his dad.

He went, and he saw a tombstone.

...

There was a picture on the tombstone. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In the picture, she was smiling.

That familiar smile, as if, still in front of his eyes.

George’s tears rolled down his eyes and they fell in big globs.

He remembered that when his Grandfather died, he was lain in this thing too.

So, is his mom dead?

He clenched his little lips and did not let himself cry out.

He would not believe it.

He would not believe that his mom had just died.

There was so much he had yet to say to her.

He wanted to tell his mom that he was no longer angry.

...

He was no longer angry at the conflict between her and his dad.

He understood that adults could not help themselves sometimes.

For example, his dad sent him away.

He also wanted to thank her for giving him such a cute sister.

He really loved his sister so much.

“George,” Edward called.

George did not answer.

His small body, just standing straight in front of the tombstone, with blurred eyes, just looking straight at his mother’s smile that could never die in his heart.

“I’m sorry I broke my promise,” he said in a voice so low.

George’s scarlet eyes had not stopped tearing.

Kingsley was dead.

Now, his mother was also dead.

The people who had grown up with him were gone.

“I did not bring your mother back. In the future...” Yan Jin said, “You have to learn to take care of yourself.”
