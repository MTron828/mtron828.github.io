Chapter 1547: Jeanne Tells Monica Her Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Behind Monica, Jeanne made sure to enunciate her every word.

Monica froze at the door and thought that she was hearing things. How could Candice be Jeanne? How could Candice call herself Jeanne? They clearly did not look alike at all.

She turned around, her eyes red. As her eyes were red, her vision was blurry, and she could not see that the woman in front of her also had red eyes with tears in them.

“Are you trying to say that you can also become Jeanne?”

“I am Jeanne, Monica.” Jeanne was suppressing her emotions, and her voice sounded choked up.

Even when she regained her memory and found out that she was Jeanne, she did not feel as bad as she did now. Hence, she did think that telling Monica the truth would make her so emotional.

She pursed her lips tightly. She felt good to be alive… and to be able to see the people she loved.

“Aren’t you Candice?” Monica still did not believe her.

How could she believe that Candice had become Jeanne? Was Jeanne not dead?

Jeanne died in the Sanders’ residence, along with all the members of the Sanders. How did she suddenly come back to life? How did she become someone else? Jeanne must be lying to her on purpose.

She could not believe it or accept the little bit of hope that Jeanne was alive because she was afraid that she would not be able to accept the disappointment.

Tears streamed down her face, and she was a wreck.

Jeanne said, “Monica, I’m really alive.”

“Alive? Why did you become Candice?”

“Because in the eyes of outsiders, Jeanne is dead.” Jeanne explained, “As for why I look like Candice, you can ask Finn. It’s all thanks to him.”

“Finn did plastic surgery on you?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“He didn’t tell me.” Monica was still doubtful. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She was probably afraid that everything was a lie, so she did not dare to accept it.

“He didn’t even tell me.”

Monica did not understand what Jeanne meant by that.

Jeanne said, “Edward was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to accept living with this identity, so he made me take amnesia pills. I couldn’t remember anything for a long time until I married Edward as Candice again. Due to a strange combination of factors, I stopped taking the pill and gradually regained my memories.”

Monica still did not believe it. In fact, she felt like she was in a movie. How could there be a pill that could make people lose their memories?

Then, Monica suddenly thought of Patsy from some time ago and Patsy’s strange behavior. There were two times when Patsy could not recognize her. Did Finn give Le Pei the medicine?

At that thought, she started believing everything was real and that the person in front of her was Jeanne. Even though the woman did not look like Jeanne, the person in front of her was Jeanne.

If it were not Jeanne, why did Monica feel so close to her? If it were not Jeanne, how could Monica feel so comfortable with her? If it were not Jeanne… It was Jeanne, the woman she almost wanted to dig out of her grave. Not only was she still alive, but she lived so close to Monica.

Tears streamed down Monica’s face like a waterfall. However, she could not say a word. She did not know how to express her current emotions or thank the heavens for keeping Jeanne alive. All of a sudden, it seemed like all she knew was to cry.

Jeanne rubbed her eyes and looked at the woman in front of her, feeling a little helpless. She had just said that Monica had grown up and matured, yet now she was crying like a child, just like when they were young.

When Monica was young, she loved to cry. Whenever she cried, her tears and snot would be everywhere. With that, Jeanne stood up and walked toward Monica.

Monica looked at the woman in front of her with teary eyes. It was almost impossible to see the latter’s face clearly, and because of that, Jeanne’s face from before appeared in front of her. That face was so beautiful that it made her jealous.

“Monica.” Jeanne lowered her head and held her hand.

When they were young, they always held hands wherever they went. Now, however, it seemed like a lifetime had passed since then.

She felt Jeanne’s gentle hand holding hers tightly.

“Be good, don’t cry. You’re still pregnant.” Jeanne coaxed Monica with her gentle voice.

Monica cried even harder. It was as if she caught of glimpse of their childhood. Whenever she cried when she was young, Jeanne would coax her and treat her very gently..
