Nox Winter’s eyes were completely wide open.

He really did not react for a long time to what Shelly said.

At that moment, he was so taken aback that he stuttered, “You… What did you learn in school? Do you know what you just said?”

“I know.” Shelly was very calm.

“Shelly Carter, you’re only 18 years old, and you’re still a student. Are you crazy? How can you casually invite men to sleep with you?”

“I didn’t do it casually...”

“Don’t say it!” Nox was very serious. “I don’t want to hear such words in the future, and you can’t tell this to any other men. I think I should call my mother and report your situation.”

Shelly just looked at him without any special emotions.

Nox carried the computer and left.

“Brother,” Shelly said, “Mom said we’re going to get married.”

Nox was stunned.

He had almost forgotten about this matter.

“Since we’re going to get married, isn’t it natural to have sex?” Shelly said straightforwardly. “Since you have to find someone to have sex with every day, why not let me do it? Isn’t it the same?”

“It’s different!” Nox was losing his temper. “We won’t get married. I won’t marry you.”

“Why?”

“Who the f**k still wants to have an arranged marriage in this era?”

“But mom said that I can resolve your bloody disaster...”

“It’s all nonsense!” Nox shouted at Shelly loudly, “I’ll explain it to you now. We won’t get married. Don’t believe my parents. I absolutely won’t marry you. From the moment you entered my house, I only treated you as my sister. I have no other feelings for you.”

“No other feelings?” Shelly looked straight at him.

“No.” Nox was resolute. “If I said yes, I would at most have some sympathy for you. I heard that you were sold to my family by your biological parents. At most, I think you suffered a little.”

“Oh,” Shelly replied.

“Stop thinking nonsense if you understand. Focus on your studies.”

“What kind of woman do you like?” Shelly Carter asked.

Nox frowned.

He had never considered this question.

Anyone he deemed pleasant could be brought home. After they had sex, he could leave immediately. He had never really thought about what kind of woman he liked.

To be more precise, he had never liked anyone.

Shelly saw that Nox did not answer. At that moment, she just smiled calmly. “I have to do my homework. Brother, you can go out first.”

Nox glanced at Shelly. Before he left, he did not forget to remind her, “Don’t watch any more movies.”

“Okay.”

Nox Winter left.

Shelly returned to her desk. She fiddled with the pen in her hand and looked at the college entrance examination paper in front of her.

Nox did not like her. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She actually did not like Nox either.

But she had to marry him.

…

After lunch.

Monica and Dr. Finn left the Cardellini family villa together.

Dr. Finn drove.

The speed was very slow.

Monica leaned against the passenger seat and remained silent.

The traffic in South Hampton City was very heavy. At this moment, it suddenly rained heavily and the streets were somewhat congested.

Monica turned her head and suddenly said to Dr. Finn, “We will maintain our marriage for another three months.”

Dr. Finn did not reply.

“We will part ways after three months.”

Dr. Finn continued to drive seriously.

“Just persist...” Monica seemed to be cheering herself on.

It was as if this marriage had caused her immense pain.

And this pain was about to be released.

“I’m annoying, right?” Dr. Finn suddenly asked.

Monica was stunned.

Many times, she felt that she was talking to herself. Dr. Finn rarely spoke to her.

“You’re not that annoying.”

There was a traffic jam in front of them, so Dr. Finn stopped the car.

He turned to look at Monica. “So, I’m still annoying.”

“Dr. Finn, since we’re already at this point, I feel like I have to explain some things to you clearly.”

Dr. Finn unconsciously tightened his grip on the steering wheel.

“Your personality is really not that good. It’s been so long, yet I’ll never know what you’re thinking, what you want, when you’re happy, and when you’re angry. I just have to say a few words to you and our conversation will end. With my personality, I rarely run out of things to say. But when it comes to you, I often don’t know what to say.” Monica was never a person who hid her emotions, so she expressed her dissatisfaction with Dr. Finn all at once.
