Chapter 304: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

The girl kneeling on the ground with tears in her eyes and crying her heart out... He saw her very clearly.

“Anyway, you don’t need to regret missing out on anything. The time you missed out on is a lot of the time we wasted. There is nothing to be envious of.” Jeanne comforted him.

That was the truth.

The so-called good times they had might be the times Fourth Master Swan used to make himself more outstanding.

The Ferris wheel slowly rose into the sky and slowly descended.

After that, the three of them got down from the Ferris wheel.

It was not very exciting.

It was just a dull ride, and they sat through the entire journey.

They had just walked out of the Ferris wheel when a clown stopped them and performed in front of them.

George looked at his performance curiously.

The clown’s performance went on for a while, and when he was done, he elegantly took out a photo and a rose.

He handed the rose to Jeanne, who accepted it and smiled. “Thank you.”

......

Then, he passed the photo to Edward, who also accepted it, and suddenly raised his hand.

Edward was puzzled as he looked at the clown gesturing. However, he still could not understand.

Jeanne quickly took out her phone. “Is it fifty dollars?”

The clown nodded and beamed.

“I’ll pay via QR code,” Jeanne said.

The clown comically took out a QR code from his trouser pocket.

Once Jeanne had paid, the clown handed the photo to Jeanne, who received it and took a look.

She saw her, George, and Fourth Master Swan sitting on the Ferris wheel.

She did not know when the photo was taken, but in it, Fourth Master Swan was looking deeply at her from the side.

At that, she pursed her lips.

Edward was also looking at the photo.

Jeanne smiled cheerfully. “Fourth Master, do you want it?”

If he did not want it, she would keep it for memory’s sake.

“I want it,” Fourth Master Swan said resolutely.

Therefore, Jeanne passed it to him.

She could do without it too.

Fourth Master Swan took the photo and glanced at it a few times before putting it into his trouser pocket. Then, he bent down, picked George up, and walked ahead.

George, who was being carried, was more used to it this time. Out of habit, he put his head on Fourth Master Swan’s shoulder again.

Jeanne, on the other hand, stopped in her tracks to turn her head and look at the sun that was about to set.

With her lips pursed, she strode forward to catch up with them.

“Fourth Master, is there anything else you want to ride?” Jeanne asked him.

“What about you?”

“I...” Jeanne hesitated for a moment. “I want to go to the haunted house to take a look.”

“Okay.” Fourth Master Swan nodded and agreed, so Jeanne brought them to the haunted house.

Since George was too young, he was not allowed inside.

Fortunately, the facilities were well-equipped with places for children to play, and the service was thoughtful of parents. There were also dedicated caretakers to look after the children so the parents could have some fun.

George did not like those games, so he gladly waited for them in the amusement park.

While Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were queuing up, Jeanne asked, “Fourth Master, are you afraid of ghosts?”

“No.”

“Eden once said that he wasn’t afraid either,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward’s face stiffened.

“But after he went in, he was so scared that he became a ghost.”

Edward was unmoved.

“But I believe you, Fourth Master, are not afraid.”

Of course, he was not.

With that, Jeanne and the Fourth Master walked in.

Only six people could enter at a time.

The four people in front of them were a group of friends who looked like young, energetic university students. Once they entered, they started to fight and walk away.

Hence, only Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan were left walking behind at their own pace.

The haunted house was very dark. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The eerie-looking lit-up areas in the surrounding paired with the scary music created a terrifying atmosphere.

The two of them took a few steps before Fourth Master Swan stopped.

Jeanne looked at his feet.

“White bones,” Jeanne said and then added. “It’s fake.”

The two of them walked forward again until Fourth Master Swan stopped in his tracks again.

“Mirror illusion.”

The two of them continued forward.

It was very dark and quiet inside, as if they were in a dead space without air.

Fourth Master Swan’s footsteps were visibly a little slower.

She could even sense that his breathing had become much heavier.

They both felt their way through as they walked in the seemingly endless wilderness.

Just then, a cold wind blew.

In the quiet space…

“Ah!”

Suddenly, a white figure fell from the top of their heads.

Fourth Master Swan instinctively threw out a fierce punch

At that moment, he took a few steps back.
