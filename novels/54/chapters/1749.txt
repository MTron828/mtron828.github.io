Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the sports day ended, school was naturally over. Nox carried Bella and left the kindergarten.

“Bella, come down and walk on your own.” Shelly reminded Bella. However, Bella hugged Nox’s neck, unwilling to do as Shelly said.

“Be good.” Shelly’s tone became stern.

Bella pouted unhappily, but she still struggled to get on the ground. Seeing that, Nox placed Bella on the ground. His legs were also hurting. Otherwise, he would not want to upset Bella.

Although Bella got down, she did not leave Nox’s side. She held Nox’s hand and walked to the parking lot with him

As they walked toward Nox’s car, Shelly frowned. The car had obviously been hit. The front of the car had a huge dent in it, and a lot of the paint had fallen off.

Knowing that Shelly could tell, Nox explained, “This is the only car we have. I’ve checked it. The front of the car may be a little dented, but nothing else is faulty. I’ll get someone to repair it when we go back. We just have to make do with it for now.” “Did you get into a car accident?” Shelly asked Nox.

Nox said, “It was a small car accident.”

Shelly questioned, ‘Was it really just a small car accident? Where is your driver? Doesn’t the driver always pick us up?’

Nevertheless, Shelly held her tongue. Since Nox did not want to tell her anything, there was no need for her to ask. There were many things that they would choose to hide from each other.

In the end, Shelly got into Nox’s car, with Nox sitting in the driver’s seat while she and Bella sat in the backseat. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Just as they sat in, Bella noticed the pastries in the car and said excitedly, “Mommy, there’s a lot of pastries here. I’m so hungry. Can I have some pastry?”

However, Bella hugged Nox’s neck, unwilling to do as Shelly said.

“Be good.” Shelly’s tone became stern.

Bella pouted unhappily, but she still struggled to get on the ground. Seeing that, Nox placed Bella on the ground. His legs were also hurting. Otherwise, he would not want to upset Bella.

Although Bella got down, she did not leave N0X’s side. She held N0X’s hand and walked to the parking lot with him

Just as they sat in, Bella noticed the pastries in the car and said excitedly, “Mommy, there’s a lot of pastries here. I’m so hungry. Can I have some pastry?”

Only then did Shelly see the pastries in the car.

Before she could say anything, Nox said, “Go ahead. I just bought it.”

“Thank you, Daddy,” Bella said politely.

Then, she quickly opened the pastry’s packaging and ate it in big mouthfuls.

Shelly, on the other hand, stared at the pastries in a daze. Nox did not like pastry. As she had grown up with the Winters and lived under the same roof as Nox for a year, she knew all of N0X’s preferences.

She remembered clearly that Nox would not eat pastry. Therefore, was it because he was in a hurry that he bought pastry? Seeing the remaining pastries, did that mean Nox did not eat much at all?

Shelly started to feel overwhelmed again. Deep down, she felt that Nox was not a person who would think about others, but everything Nox did now made her feel that he was really changing. She pursed her lips and remained silent, not showing anything.

The car soon arrived at their neighborhood. After they got out of the car together, Nox called the car mechanics while holding Bella’s hand. Meanwhile, Shelly walked behind them. Perhaps the phone call had distracted Nox, but it was even more obvious that he was limping. After the call, they walked into the elevator.

Back home, Nox sat down on the sofa with Bella. It had been a long afternoon and a long time since he had exercised so much. Now that he had sat down, he did not feel like moving at all.

“Daddy, are you tired?” Bella asked.

“Will you allow me to be tired?” Nox looked at Bella and asked gently.

The innocence and cuteness of children could sometimes warm one’s heart. Nox smiled. “In that case, I’ll go back to my room and take a nap.”

“Alright.” Bella nodded obediently.

Nox stood up from the sofa and walked into the room. Firstly, he was really tired and needed a good rest. Secondly, his right leg was hurting a little, so he needed to go back to his room to check it out. When he got up and left, he took a first aid kit with him.

Shelly, who was busy in the kitchen, saw N0X’s actions at a glance. She looked in his direction silently for a while. In the end, she put down what she was doing and walked to the bedroom.

In the room, Nox had just taken off his pants. Beneath his pants, he could see that his scarlet red knees were covered in blood. It was probably left behind when he fell while running, but it looked ferocious..
