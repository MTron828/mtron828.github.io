Chapter 44: Fourth Master Swan Is Downstairs

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica helped Jeanne to her bed.

She looked at Jeanne panting, then she gritted her teeth as she went to Finn’s room. She knocked on the door.

Finn opened the door and looked at Monica.

Monica said, “Jeanne is looking for you. She’s in my room.”

Finn frowned.

He stood up and prepared to go over.

Monica grabbed his arm.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

Monica took a deep breath and slowly let go of him.

She did not say anything and let go of him.

Monica always felt that Jeanne had been more mature than her since she was young and would not be as reckless as her. Since it was Jeanne’s choice, it must be right.

Finn glanced at Monica and still did not say anything. He walked into her room.

The door opened.

Jeanne was lying on Monica’s bed.

She was hugging the blanket, and her entire body was trembling.

Her face was rosy, and she was having difficulty breathing. Her face was covered in sweat, and she was curled up into a ball. It was obvious that she was in pain.

Finn strode over. Instinctively, the doctor reached out to check on her condition.

“I’ve been drugged,” Jeanne said, “It should be very serious.”

Finn’s hand froze in mid-air.

“I hope you can help me.” Jeanne was panting heavily.

Finn looked at Jeanne’s appearance again and asked, “Are you sure you want me to help you?”

“Yes.”

“With your current condition, I don’t think my medicine is better than... a man,” Finn said bluntly.

“Please try it.” Jeanne held it in. She held it in as long as she could. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Finn wanted to say something but did not delay any further.

He said, “Wait for me for a while.”

Jeanne nodded and hugged the blanket tightly. She was trying her best to suppress the desire in her heart.

Monica stood outside the room. She saw Finn come out and leave without even looking at her.

She was unhappy.

When she returned to her room, she saw that Jeanne was still in extreme discomfort.

She asked, “Jeanne, how are you?”

Jeanne shook her head.

Monica felt uncomfortable just looking at her.

Although she had never tried it before, it was not like she had not seen it before after so many years at the nightclub. She had even seen a hostess show effect on the spot. She could still vividly remember that wild scene…

“Do you want me to help you find a man?” Monica suddenly suggested, “Don’t hold any hope for Finn. He’s a piece of trash!”

“Monica, don’t bother about me. Get out!”

“Jeanne...”

“Get out!” Jeanne was very loud.

She was almost shouting.

Monica looked at her in a daze.

Jeanne suddenly got up from the bed.

Monica was shocked.

The next moment, she saw Jeanne frantically running into the bathroom in her room and fiercely closing the bathroom door. Then, there was what seemed like a violent sound as well as the sound of the shower running.

Monica was frightened.

She hurriedly ran to the bathroom and knocked on the bathroom door. “Jeanne, open the door. Don’t lock yourself up! What’s wrong with you? Quickly open the door.”

There were still some bangings and clangings in the bathroom.

“Jeanne!” Monica’s eyes were red. “Don’t endure it like that! Isn’t it just a problem that a man can solve? Why are you putting yourself through all this?! Just you wait. I’ll immediately find a man for you. I’ll find a tall, handsome, and good one for you. Wait for me...”

Monica cried as she spoke.

She turned around and ran out of the room.

As she was too anxious, she bumped into Finn, who had just entered the room.

In order to prevent the medicine in his hands from falling, Finn raised both his hands, and Monica fell directly onto his chest.

Monica used too much strength. At that moment, her vision was blurry.

She knew that Finn might look like a good-for-nothing man, but the muscles on his body were really tough!

Monica stabilized herself for a while before she left Finn’s chest. The next second, she planned to run out again.

Finn asked casually, “You even know who’s good at it?”

Monica stopped in her tracks and gritted her teeth. “He’s better than you anyway!”

Finn’s expression darkened.

Monica was about to leave.

Finn said coldly, “If Jeanne needed a man, she wouldn’t have come here! Behave yourself and close the door. Wait outside!”

Monica gritted her teeth.

What right did Finn have to order her around?

“Get out!” Finn said again.

Monica glared at Finn and walked out with her red eyes. She then angrily closed the door.

Finn looked in the bathroom’s direction.

At this moment, the person inside had reached her limits.

Finn said, “Jeanne, the medicine is ready. Come out.”

There seemed to be a second of silence inside.

After a long time, the bathroom door suddenly opened.

The moment it opened, Finn averted his gaze.

Jeanne’s entire body was drenched. The curves of her body were clearly visible.

She stumbled back to the bed and tried her best to cover herself with the blanket. At this moment, her body trembled even more violently.

Finn saw that Jeanne was settled down, then he walked over and took her arm out from under the blanket.

The moment he took it out, he could clearly feel Jeanne’s body was startled.

It was obvious that she was feeling intense pressure.

Finn looked at the scratches on Jeanne’s arm. The bloody scratches were made to control her desire.

His throat moved slightly as he maintained his calmness as a doctor. He found a vein and injected medicine into Jeanne’s arm.

After injecting the medicine, he put Jeanne’s arm under the blanket.

He said, “I can’t guarantee that this medicine can completely suppress your desire, and I don’t dare to use too much of it on you. You should also know that too much of something will only bring negative results, especially medicine. Once you take too much of it, there’ll be hidden dangers.”

Jeanne fiercely curled up her body.

“In principle, the medicine will take effect after half an hour, but don’t have too much hope. After all, I haven’t tested this medicine on humans before. You’ve just become my lab rat,” Finn explained.

Jeanne could not hear what Finn said clearly.

At that moment, she kept telling herself that it would be over if she endured it a bit longer.

Finn stood up.

With Jeanne’s condition at the moment, it was not suitable for him to stand guard by her side.

“If you can’t hold on any longer, call me. I’ll be right outside the door,” Finn said.

Jeanne did not move.

He added, “Fourth Master Swan is downstairs.”

Jeanne’s pupils constricted. Her originally unfocused gaze suddenly became focused.

Finn did not say anything more.

He walked out directly.

Outside the room, Monica’s eyes were red. At this moment, when she saw Finn come out, she was a little agitated. “How’s Jeanne?”

Finn did not answer. He was very cold toward her.

Monica wanted to strangle Finn to death.

This man always treated her with indifference. She thought that she would pick up a kitchen knife one day to chop him.
