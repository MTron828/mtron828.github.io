1357 I Actually Don’t Love You That Much

It was so late at night, so she was probably asleep.

Finn gripped his phone tightly, but in the end, he did not make the call. Instead, he turned around and was about to leave when a car suddenly stopped at the entrance of the neighborhood.

Initially, Finn did not care. However, the moment he saw Brandon get out of the car, his expression changed. He then watched as Brandon helped Monica out of the car.

The two of them did not notice him as they walked into the neighborhood together.

“Ugh.” Monica could not help but walk to the side and vomit.

F*ck. It had been a long time since she had been so drunk. After all, she had always been undefeated.

However, after visiting Jeanne tonight and staying at her grave for a while, she was in such a low mood that she was thinking about dying. If Brandon had not stopped her, she felt that she might have drunk herself to death. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She admitted that even after so many years, she could not forget that woman, Jeanne.

How could that woman die just like that?

What she could not understand was… why was it so hard for her to forget her, yet it was so easy for that sc*mbag Edward to let go of her?

She was so drunk that she wanted to kill that sc*mbag Edward with a knife. Fortunately, Brandon pulled her back and sent her back.

“Ugh.” Monica vomited again.

“Look at how drunk you are…” Brandon was speechless.

Monica also regretted it. Why did she have to punish herself for that sc*mbag Edward’s evil deeds?

At that moment, she was filled with regret.

As she slowly stood up, Brandon supported her swaying body. “I’ll send you home.”

“No need, I can walk by myself.”

“How can you walk in this state? Be good and listen to me. I’ll send you back.”

“Don’t think I don’t know what you men are thinking.” Monica pushed Brandon away.

The moment he pushed it away, he took a few steps back. However, Brandon reacted quickly and pulled her back again, afraid that she would fall over.

In Finn’s eyes, the two of them were entangled.

“You want to sleep with me while I’m drunk, don’t you?” Monica was straightforward.

Brandon blushed at her words and said in exasperation, “Monica, who do you think I am? Do I look like someone who would take advantage of others?!”

“Who knows if you are!” Monica burped. “Anyway, I won’t give you a chance.”

As she spoke, she pushed Brandon away. Then, she turned around and was about to go back on her own.

She had only taken two steps when her body suddenly tilted. It was just that no one was there to support her, and she could not stand on her own.

Brandon quickly went over to help her. However, at that moment, a figure was one step faster than him and directly hugged Monica into his arms.

Monica felt dizzy and wanted to vomit again.

Brandon’s hand was hanging awkwardly in the air when he saw Finn and was a little surprised.

“Why are you here?” Brandon asked.

“What does that have to do with you?” Finn asked coldly.

“You and Monica have already broken up.”

“That has nothing to do with you.”

“Let go of Monica.” Brandon’s expression was ugly.

“Monica has rejected you just now.” Finn enunciated each word.

Although he was indeed unhappy that they were so intimate, Monica had rejected Brandon, and he heard her very clearly.

“That’s none of your business.” Brandon was visibly agitated.

He was used to being rejected by Monica, but he had a feeling that he would be able to win her over one day. However, he could not stand it when Finn used that excuse to push him away.

“I’ll send Monica back. You can go now.”

“Why?!” Brandon was even angrier now.

“Because she rejected you.”

“Finn, don’t forget that you and Monica have already broken up. Don’t you think you’re rude to pester her now?”

“Who told you we broke up?” Finn’s eyes turned cold.

Brandon glared at him.

“I never agreed to the breakup.”

“What do you mean?” Brandon questioned him.

“Breaking up was Monica’s idea, but I didn’t agree. I allowed her to leave my side just to calm us down.” Finn said, “We never broke up!”

As soon as he said that, Finn bent over, carried Monica in his arms, and strode into the neighborhood.

Brandon clenched his fists. He wanted to go forward to stop him, but… he endured it.
