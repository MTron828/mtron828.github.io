Chapter 88: I Still Prefer You to Take the Initiative, M. Lawrence

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn closed the door.

He leaned against the door.

His eyes were red.

‘I’m happier with him than I am with you…’

His mind was filled with those words.

Finn endured it, his throat rising and falling.

He looked at the cake in the room.

Finn had prepared it in advance.

He knew very well that Monica would not celebrate his birthday again, so he prepared one for himself, hoping that tonight... he would spend it with her.

Alone.

Then, he would confirm their relationship.

After Finn pushed her away that night, he regretted it.

It was because of his pride.

He had been brooding over how much he loved her but how she let him go whenever she wanted.

Now, she had really let him go.

Whether it was in the past or now…

It was too easy to miss a relationship.

…

Under the same night sky, Edward sent Jeanne back.

The car stopped halfway.

Edward opened the car door and pulled Jeanne out of the car.

Jeanne was a little unhappy.

‘What’s wrong with Fourth Master Swan again?!’

Edward held Jeanne’s hand and walked into a family restaurant.

The restaurant’s environment was very good. It was beside South Hampton City’s riverside. The private rooms by the river could enjoy the beautiful night view of the river.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you have anything special that you like to eat?” Edward asked Jeanne casually while holding the menu.

“No.” Jeanne thought, ‘Can I say that I only want to go home now?!’

“Then serve your signature dishes.”

“Okay.”

The waiter left respectfully.

Jeanne looked at the night view outside the French window.

It had been some time since she returned to South Hampton City, but she had never looked at this city so seriously before.

Perhaps this city was no longer where she belonged, which was why she was not in the mood to enjoy it.

At this moment, as she was facing Fourth Master Swan’s awkwardness alone, she could only look out the window.

Fortunately, Fourth Master Swan was not a person who liked to be lively.

Jeanne was quiet, but Edward was even quieter than she was.

It was until the fragrant dishes were served.

When Jeanne smelled the fragrance of the dishes, she seemed to remember that she was so busy that she did not even eat dinner tonight.

She picked up her cutleries and started eating silently.

Fourth Master Swan ate very little.

He barely touched the food.

Jeanne ate some and was a little surprised. “Fourth Master, aren’t you going to eat?”

“I’m not hungry.”

‘If you’re not hungry, why did you order so much?

‘Why did you suddenly want to have supper?!’

Jeanne’s heart suddenly froze.

At that moment, she seemed to have discovered something.

She pursed her lips lightly and did not say anything else. She continued to eat dinner silently.

Edward looked at her, and the corners of his lips curled up. He could tell that she had suddenly fallen silent.

Even so, he did not say anything either.

After dinner, Edward continued to send Jeanne back.

The car stopped at the Lawrence family’s courtyard.

Jeanne got out of the car.

Edward also got out of the car.

“Thank you,” Jeanne said politely.

“I don’t accept verbal thanks,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Jeanne looked straight at him.

Edward suddenly approached.

Jeanne’s body froze. At that moment, for some strange reason, she did not retreat.

She saw Fourth Master Swan bend over and move his face close to hers.

Her emotions fluctuated, and her eyes flickered.

The moment Fourth Master Swan was close to her lips, she chose to close her eyes.

Jeanne closed her eyes, but nothing that she intended happened.

She opened her eyes.

Jeanne saw the smile on Fourth Master Swan’s lips. He said, “I still prefer you to take the initiative, Ms. Lawrence.”

After saying that, he stood up straight.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

‘This lunatic.’

Jeanne said, “Thank you for the trouble, Fourth Master. Goodbye.”

It would be best if they did not meet again!

She turned around and left immediately.

It was useless to talk to a lunatic.

It was just that…

Since when did her heart beat faster when she was facing that man?

Edward looked at Jeanne until her figure completely disappeared from his sight. Only then did he turn around and return to the car.

He took out his phone and dialed. “Nox.”

“Fourth Master Swan, you’re done so quickly?” The person teased.

Edward ignored him and asked bluntly, “Have you left yet?”

“I just left.”

“Where’s Finn?”

“He left too. He dragged Monica and left. I’m guessing that tonight, they’ll either fight for 300 rounds or go straight to the civil affairs bureau to get a divorce tomorrow.” Nox knew what was going on.

Monica and Finn obviously had a lot of misunderstandings.

If they resolved the misunderstandings, they would get back together.

If they could not resolve the misunderstanding, they would go their separate ways.

There were only two options.

“Okay, I got it,” Edward responded.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up now.”

“Are you busy?”

“I brought a chick home.” Nox did not try to hide it.

Edward directly hung up the phone.

Nox looked at the screen speechlessly.

‘He has never experienced the joy of life, so he doesn’t know how intoxicating my life is.’

“Young Master Winter, is the person who called you the legendary Fourth Master Swan?” The chick next to him asked sweetly.

“Girl, don’t even think about Fourth Master Swan. You can’t hook up with him unless you’re the reincarnation of a fairy.”

“Young Master Winter, you love to joke. I only like you. What I’m curious about is whether he’s rumored to not be interested in women. Does he have a problem in that area? Or is he… gay?”

“Shut your gossipy mouth, or I’ll cut your tongue out.”

The chick quickly shut her mouth.

At this moment, the car had arrived at Nox’s high-class apartment.

The chick followed Nox out of the car.

As soon as the two of them entered the elevator, Nox started to make his move on the chick.

The chick was also very enthusiastic and instantly became unusually engrossed.

They kissed from the elevator all the way to the apartment.

Without turning on the lights, Nox hugged the chick and threw her onto the sofa. Then, he pressed her onto the sofa and tore at her clothes…

“Ah!” The chick suddenly screamed.

It was not a scream that came from lust; she was frightened by the scene in front of her.

Nox was also startled by the chick’s sudden scream. He turned his head and was almost scared to death.

Both of them were so scared that their bodies trembled.

Nox hurriedly got up from the chick’s body and went to turn on the lights.

After turning on the lights, he saw a woman with disheveled hair standing next to the sofa, looking straight at them. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Why are you here?!” Nox’s scalp went numb.

For a second, he really thought that he had provoked a female ghost.

“It’s the third year of high school this semester, so I’m quite busy with my homework. Your place is close to the school, so Mom asked me to temporarily stay at your place. She said that she called you,” the girl said.

The girl still had baby fat on her face and wore a pair of typical student glasses. Her figure was also a little chubby.

Nox seemed to have just remembered that he had received a phone call from his mother before he woke up this morning. She seemed to have said something, but he did not hear it clearly at that time.

He took a deep breath. “Shelly Carter, even if you want to stay with me for a period of time, you should at least not look at us!”

“Oh,” Shelly replied, “I didn’t see anything. You may continue.”

Then, she turned around and left.

Nox looked at Shelly and was a little angry.

The chick was also confused. She twisted her body and moved closer to Nox. “Young Master Winter, who is she?”

“My younger sister—” Nox had not finished speaking when he was interrupted.

Shelly, who was leaving, suddenly stopped. She turned around and said, “We’re not related by blood.”
