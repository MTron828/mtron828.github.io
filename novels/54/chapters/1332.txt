1333 An Encounter at Dinner and Finn’s Outburst

When Monica arrived at the Cardellini Enterprise, Brandon was already waiting for her at the door of her office.

Ever since Brandon came to the company, they had spent a lot of time together. It was not that she was biased toward Brandon, but he was indeed very strong and capable. Soon, he became her right-hand man.

She sat in her office chair and had yet to say anything about work when Brandon placed a portion of breakfast on Monica’s desk.

Monica was surprised. Both of them had drunk quite a bit last night. Brandon should be feeling a little hungover, so she did not expect him to be so energetic.

“Breakfast. I don’t think Chairman has eaten yet,” Brandon said eagerly.

She really had not eaten. When she first woke up, she did not feel hungry. Now that she saw the avocado toasts right in front of her, her appetite surfaced.

Brandon said, “Eat while I report to you. I won’t waste your time.”

Monica’s lips curled into a faint smile and nodded.

During this period of time, she seemed to be frequently taken care of by Brandon. When she was young, she always felt that he was a follower who liked to pester her and was so annoying. Now, she suddenly felt that that annoying little sidekick had really grown up to be able to take care of her well.

As Monica ate her avocado toasts, her thoughts wandered.

She suddenly remembered that the last man who treated her so well was Michael. The thought of Michael made Monica’s scalp tingle. For a long time, she would not dare let her mind wander off to think about this person. She just had the feeling that once she was bitten, she would be twice shy for ten years.

She even began to suspect that Brandon had another motive for treating her so well. As expected, she was enchanted.

“Chairman?” Brandon saw that she was distracted and called out to her.

Monica came back to her senses. “What?”

“I said, after signing the contract, should we hold a celebratory party tonight? The project team has been keeping up with us for a month and it happens to be Friday today. Even if we celebrate till a little later tonight, we’re not coming to work tomorrow.” Brandon seemed to have finished reporting his work and was proposing his ideas.

“Is this celebration mandatory for the team?” Monica looked at Brandon.

She felt that it was unfair to Brandon to confuse him with Michael.

“No, it’s a suggestion of mine. When we’re overseas, foreigners pay a lot of attention to team building. It means that after every project ends, there will definitely be distinctive rewards and punishments. I suggest that at tonight’s celebration, we can reward everyone according to their contributions and the rules that were set at the beginning to build the morale of the employees,” Brandon said bluntly.

“Alright.” Monica nodded. She agreed immediately.

The members of the team had indeed put in a lot of effort to achieve this project. They often worked overtime. Since the project was a success, they should celebrate, so why not?

“Then I’ll leave tonight’s celebratory dinner to the General Affairs Department to make the arrangements.”

“Mm,” Monica agreed.

After they settled on that, Monica saw that Brandon had no intention of leaving.

She frowned slightly. “Anything else?”

“Do the toasts taste good?” Brandon suddenly changed the topic.

Monica looked at the remaining toasts and nodded honestly. “It’s quite delicious. Next time, when I don’t have time for breakfast in the morning, I’ll go to this place and order takeout. Tell Tim the address of this place.”

“This restaurant doesn’t do takeouts,” Brandon said bluntly.

“Then, how did you get it?” Monica raised her eyebrows. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I made it myself.” Brandon smiled smugly, the kind of smile that radiates sunshine and cheerfulness. It made people feel very warm and comfortable with him.

“You actually have such skills?” Monica could not believe it.

“I learned it for you.” Brandon was still full of smiles.

Monica was still quite in disbelief. She said, “You must have especially learned it to make your girlfriend happy. Now, you’re here to bribe me.”

“You even found out about this,” Brandon said with an exaggerated expression.

“Otherwise, could it be that you like me?” Monica said disapprovingly.

The moment she said it, her heart suddenly skipped a beat.

It was as if he had discovered something in that second.

Right then, she vaguely saw the affection in Brandon’s eyes.

It was as if her joke was true.

“I would love to have the honor of liking you.”

Brandon seemed to be very calm when he said this, as if his affectionate gaze toward her earlier seemed to be an illusion. He was speaking jokingly and even added nonchalantly, “But my Chairman is already taken.”
