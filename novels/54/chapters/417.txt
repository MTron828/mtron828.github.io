Chapter 418: Fourth Master Swan Is Jealous

Jeanne frowned. Why was George still awake at an hour like that?

At that moment, when George saw that they had returned hand in hand, his already impatient little face became even more unhappy. He moved his little butt down from the sofa and was prepared to leave with his short legs.

“Master Lawrence, can I call you that?” Nox grabbed George’s little arm.

George frowned.

“Can you be so kind as to take your virus software out of the Swan Group’s firewall? It’s very dangerous for the Swan Group. If people were to find out that there’s this loophole in our internal department and find out about our trade secrets, the Swan Group would go bankrupt. By then, you won’t have such a nice house to live in. All of us will have to sleep on the street!” Nox almost knelt to George.

Jeanne was a little surprised. “What’s going on?”

“Your son has put a virus software on the Swan Group’s firewall. Right now, our people can’t fix it, and with this software, others can easily hack into our software. Hurry up and persuade your son. Tell him that he can’t play with everything.” Nox could not stand it anymore.

From the time George finished school at 5 p.m. till now, he had been painstakingly persuading him for a whole five hours!

However, that little brat was indifferent to him, ignoring him!

“Oh,” Jeanne replied and did not say anything.

Nox’s eyes widened.

Then, Jeanne said to George casually, “George, it is late. Go back to your room and sleep.”

With that, George ran upstairs.

......

Nox watched George’s silhouette and then at Edward and Jeanne going to the dining room to eat.

It turned out he was the one who was worried.

Damn it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Since the Swan Group was not his, they could do whatever they wanted.

“Nox,” Edward suddenly called out to him.

“What’s the matter?”

“You are responsible for the security of the Swan Group’s information. If anything goes wrong, it’ll be your responsibility, “Edward said bluntly.

Nox was about to explode with rage.

He walked furiously to the dining room and said fiercely to Edward, “It’s my responsibility, but what should I do? Even if you force me now, there’s nothing I can do!”

Edward frowned.

“In any case, I don’t care about this matter.” Nox really gave up. “Let me put it this way. George created the virus, and I can’t convince that master to take it down. He has no intention of fixing that loophole, and my people can’t fix it either. This bug is different from the previous one. Although there was a problem with our firewall last time, no one else could break it. It means no one other than Master Lawrences could get in, so there wasn’t much of a security risk. But this time, it’s better. Once someone who knows a little bit of code discovers there’s a bug in our firewall, they can easily get in. Anyway, you can think of the consequences yourself. I’m leaving now!”

Then, he left in a huff.

He was probably pissed off by George today.

Edward looked at Nox’s silhouette and turned to look at Jeanne.

With her head lowered, she said, “I have never stopped George from doing anything he likes.”

“You’re now a shareholder of the Swan Group,” Edward reminded her.

Jeanne raised her head and looked at Edward.

“If the Swan Group has any losses, it’ll also be yours.”

Jeanne smiled and said, “Fourth Master, you can’t scare me.”

“...”

“After all, I only have eight percent, whereas 80 percent of it is in the hands of the Swans. I’m sure you’re even more anxious than I am.”

Edward lowered her eyes. “Eat.”

Jeanne smiled very brightly.

She could tell that Edward was being bullied by George, and she could not let George be bullied by that fellow all the time.

Of course, she would not help anyone.

She would just watch from the sidelines.

“Oh, right,” Edward suddenly said.

“Huh?” Jeanne looked at him.

“My dad’s 75th birthday is next Friday.”

Old Master Swan was 75 years old, while Edward was only 29 years old.

.

That age gap was really… big.

“Are you holding a big banquet?” Jeanne asked.

“My dad doesn’t like to have many people around, so it’ll just be a gathering with the Swans.”

“Do I need to take a day off that day?”

After all, how could she miss Old Master Swan’s birthday banquet?

“There’s no need for that. We’ll have dinner at 6 p.m., and you can get off work on time.”

“Do you need me to prepare any gifts?”

“It’s up to you,” Edward said.

This sentence was worded nicely because it meant she had no choice but to prepare.

Therefore, she nodded.
