Chapter 663: The Shareholder Meeting, A Huge Catfight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At that moment, all her attention was on Finn and Sarah. No matter what Sarah said, Finn was only there for business.

She was not very happy with the meal.

At least Monica felt like a ball of fire was simmering in her heart. She really wanted to vent, but she had no choice but to control it.

She was really afraid of Finn now — afraid he would hate her.

After dinner, Finn accompanied Gary to the second floor, and Monica could not sit still.

She did not know how to face Finn or talk to him. It was as if... she could not talk to Finn anymore.

She glanced upstairs from time to time and tried to stop herself. However, she still got up and went upstairs in the end.

Knowing that Finn was in her father’s room, she walked toward that room but did not dare to knock on the door.

She did not know how long she stood outside the room until the door opened.

Then, Monica saw Finn, who walked out and ignored her existence.

She gritted her teeth and quickly followed him. “Finn.”

Finn stopped.

“I really didn’t know my dad would call you over today. It wasn’t my intention to show up around you.”

“Okay,” Finn replied.

He seemed to have accepted her explanation, and a second later, he left.

Monica instinctively wanted to go after him but tried her best to hold herself back.

She had just said she would not show up in front of him. If she did that again, would she not be slapping herself in the face?

With that, she could only try her best to slow down and go downstairs.

Downstairs, Finn was saying goodbye to Ruby.

“I’ll be leaving first, auntie,” Finn said.

“Aren’t you going to stay for dinner?” Ruby urged her to stay.

“I still have some things to deal with, so I won’t have dinner,” Finn refused.

Ruby still wanted to say something, but Finn had left. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Finn.” Sarah suddenly grabbed Finn.

Monica was standing not far away from them, so she had to endure Sarah’s intimate actions.

“Did you drive?” Sarah asked.

Finn nodded.

“Is it out of the way for you to send me back to school? I skipped class today, but the teacher just called. If I don’t go back to participate in the sports day, they’ll call my parents in.”

“It’s not on the way,” Finn refused flatly.

“It’s fine. Asking you to drop me off on the way is just an excuse. I can take a taxi back to school.”

Finn looked at Sarah, who quickly promised, “I won’t give you any trouble.”

Finn did not want to argue with Sarah at the moment, so he nodded. “Okay.”

Sarah almost jumped up and cheered.

On the contrary, Monica just looked at them and clenched her fists.

“Wait for me. I’ll go pack my things. Aunt, I’m going back to school.” Sarah ran upstairs excitedly.

While Finn was waiting for Sarah in the living room, Ruby looked at her daughter but did not say anything.

She had thought it through. It was not impossible for Sarah to be with Finn.

She and Gary had always regarded Finn highly. Since Monica did not have the fortune to be together with him, there was no way Sarah could not.

Anyway, regarding love, they would never know whether they were suited for each other if they never tried.

Gary went downstairs to the hall and said to Monica, “It’s getting late. Why don’t you leave with Finn too?”

“I’m back to celebrate my mother’s birthday, and it’s only past two in the afternoon! Where do you want me to go?”

“I don’t care where you go! You’re an adult now. Are you going to disturb your mom and me from having time together alone? Can’t you read the room?”

Monica wondered who it was that made her come back.

She rolled her eyes. “Alright, enjoy your time together, you two. Try your best to give me a younger brother.”

“Monica.” Gary’s tone sounded somewhat reproachful.

Ruby blushed as well.

Fortunately, Monica’s phone suddenly rang at that moment. To avoid being scolded, Monica picked up the call without even looking at the caller ID. “Hello.”

“Monica, are you at your parents’ house?” Michael’s voice sounded from the phone.

“Oh, yes.” Monica glanced at Finn, who had been acting indifferently since the beginning.

“I’m outside your parents’ house.”

“What are you doing here?” Monica was a little nervous.

“Don’t get excited. I just bought a birthday present for your mother. I won’t go in, but you can come out and get it.”

“No need. My mom isn’t 10 years old or something,” Monica rejected instinctively.

“It’s a small token of my appreciation, and it’s not a very expensive thing. I just thought auntie might need it,” Michael persuaded.
