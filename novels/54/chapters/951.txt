952 I Can’t Think of a Title Anymore, Let’s See What the Officials Do

In the quiet corridor of the hospital, Monica was wrapped in Finn’s white coat as she sat there and waited silently.

She kept telling herself that her father would be fine and that had to believe in Finn and his ability to save her father.

Time passed, minute by minute. It was as if she was the only one left in the entire world, and she was alone.

After a very long time, so long that Monica felt that her body had turned cold, the light of the operating theatre finally went out.

After that, the door opened, and Finn walked out from inside.

Monica looked at him from afar.

Finn, too, looked at her before nodding.

Did that nod mean that her father was alright?

Her eyes were a little red.

It was true. In her heart, anyone who could save her father was the best person in the world.

Even though Finn hated her a lot, she would be grateful to him.

Finn walked up to her and said, “Your father’s life is not in danger, but…”

It was good that her father’s life was not in danger. As long as his life was not in danger, it was fine.

She said, “I’ll agree to my father’s heart transplant. I’ll convince my mother.”

Finn looked at Monica, not expecting her to be so calm.

He had the impression that she would not be so quiet when she encountered something.

At that moment, he did not say anything more.

He just nodded and said, “A heart transplant is the best thing for your father right now. I will help you contact the best specialist in the world.”

“Thank you.” She meant what she said.

“It’s my job,” Finn replied. It was an official and polite answer.

While Monica listened quietly, her father was pushed out.

Many tubes were still attached to his body, and his face was very pale.

Although he was awake and had regained consciousness, he was so weak that he could not speak.

Monica went over and said in a gentle voice, “Dad, it’s okay. You’re fine.”

Gary opened his mouth.

He wanted to say something, but he could not make a sound.

Monica smiled. “Don’t try to speak. You need rest. When you’re better, you and mom can give birth to a little brother for me.”

Gary was amused by Monica, even though his smile was faint.

Together with the medical staff, Monica sent her father back to the VIP ward.

Finn watched from afar as Monica left with her father.

For the first time, he felt that Monica had changed a little. It was not a deliberate display of maturity, but she had genuinely learned to take responsibility.

He followed her to Gary’s ward.

After making sure that Gary’s physical condition was stable, he left Gary’s ward. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She had just walked out of the ward when Monica’s voice came from behind. “Finn.”

Monica walked up to him and took off the white coat she was wearing. She made sure that she was careful not to expose the torn clothes inside. She said, “I’ll return this to you.”

Finn glanced at her. “You don’t need it anymore.”

“This is your work uniform, right? I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to wear it,” Monica said.

It was true. Working clothes were usually not allowed to be lent out, and that was an unspoken rule among doctors.

Finn took it from Monica’s hand.

The moment he took it, he accidentally touched her finger, which was icy cold, and it made him frown.

It was early winter in South Hampton City, but it was not cold enough to freeze a person to that extent.

He clenched his fingers and held the clothes in his hand.

“You’ve worked hard tonight. Please rest well. My dad needs you,” Monica said sincerely.

Finn nodded in response.

Monica did not say anything else. She simply turned around and returned to the ward.

Finn stood outside the ward for a long time. His head was lowered, and he was looking at the white coat in his hand.

The white coat still had a trace of Monica’s warmth, but the temperature of her fingers was so cold that it was terrifying.

Even so, Finn eventually turned around and left.

That one moment of his heart softening was not enough for him to let go of all the past.

In the ward, Monica sat by her father’s bedside.

Gary was still awake. His body looked very weak, and his lips were pale, but his mind was clear.

Even if he did not even have the strength to speak, Monica could tell from his eyes that her father wanted to have a chat with her.

She also wanted to have a chat with her father.
