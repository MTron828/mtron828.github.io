1103 Announcing Jeanne’s Identity As The Princess of the Sanders

Even though Warren deliberately hesitated to speak, Edward respectfully waited for him to continue.

Warren said, “That year my father passed away, he reminded me that the Swans was a family of loyal officials. If it weren’t for the Swans’ help back then, the Sanders wouldn’t have been able to develop so far. Hence, he told me to treat the Swans well. However, because I’ve been too busy with national affairs all these years, I’ve neglected my father’s will. Thinking about it now, I even feel guiltier.”

“Leader, you’re too kind. A country needs a leader, and of course, national affairs are the most important thing for a leader. Moreover, my father has long since abandoned politics and joined the business industry. For you to give my father a piece of land to develop his business, my family is already extremely grateful, and we don’t ask for anything more.” His words had several layers of meaning.

It expressed the Swans’ determination to no longer participate in political affairs, and it also showed that the Swans wanted stability and had no other ambitions.

Warren naturally understood that.

He laughed out loud. “Don’t worry. I know that the Swans have always been loyal.”

It was also a reminder to Edward that he was well aware of what the Swans were hiding.

“Well.” Warren immediately changed the topic. “Someone has been reporting to me recently that the Duncans still have an heir. I wonder if you know anything about this, Edward?”

“I don’t know anything,” Edward said firmly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Apparently, he has grown up under the nurturing of the Duncans’ loyal men from the previous ruling and already has his own power. He is also eager to make a move on us.”

“If this person really exists, I believe that after so many years, even if the Duncans have that idea, it would only be a thought. Looking at the history of Harken, there has never been a case of rebellion. So, you don’t need to worry too much, Leader. As long as we find this person and execute him, we can settle the country’s dispute.”

“I think you’re right, but it’s just that...” Warren looked at Edward intently. “I still don’t know who this person is.”

“As long as this person is in Harken, it won’t be too difficult for you to find him. Unless...” Edward looked back at Warren. “There is no such person and someone is deliberately instigating the situation and deliberately interfering with the Sanders’ politics.”

“Edward, do you think that there is no such person?”

“I’m just assuming.”

Warren’s eyes narrowed.

There were no loopholes in Edward’s answers. Every answer did not deny his suspicions, nor was it certain that it was the truth.

Moreover, he had completely cleared his name.

Warren said, “I originally wanted to ask your father today. After all, your father was in power back then and was familiar with everyone under the Duncans’ influence. If we investigate them one by one, we might be able to find the existence of the Duncans’ descendant faster.”

“My father has been in business for many years and is now over 70 years old. He may not remember many things that happened when he was younger. However, if you need anything, I can call my father now and ask him directly.” As Edward said that, he was about to make a call.

“Forget it.” Warren stopped him.

Of course, he knew that he would not be able to get anything out of Zachary.

“Your father’s health is more important. Besides, as you said, your father might not remember after so many years, so I won’t disturb his rest.”

“Thank you for your understanding, Leader.” From the start, Edward was extremely respectful.

“Edward,” Warren called out to him.

“Yes, Leader.”

“From my point of view, regardless of the existence of the Duncans’ descendant, I must get all the facts right. However, I’m in a predicament now because I’ve put in so much effort and spent so much manpower and resources only for the result to end up ambiguous. It’s been making it hard for me to sleep.”

“It must be hard on you, Leader.”

“It is indeed.” Warren said, “On one hand, I have to deal with national affairs, and on the other hand, I have to consider the existence of this descendant. On top of that, I have used some of the country’s resources to find this person’s whereabouts. I feel a little guilty for wasting so much on personal matters. So, I have a presumptuous request that I would like you to help me with, Edward.”

“As you command, Leader.” Edward agreed.

“I’ve heard that the Winters, which is your father’s assistant, Wade’s family, are now working for the Swans. I heard that his grandson is very capable and has a good network of connections. He also follows your orders.”
