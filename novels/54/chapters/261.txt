Chapter 262: Successfully Saved Jeanne

At that moment, Jeanne felt that her body was suddenly covered by a piece of clothing.

It was the white shirt on Fourth Master Swan’s body.

On the shirt, there were many bloodstains.

Fortunately, the shirt was very big.

It was so big that it could completely envelop Jeanne’s naked body so that the next person who walked in would not be able to see her body.

At this moment, Fourth Master Swan carried Jeanne up from the ground.

He carried her up so easily while she was on the verge of death.

“Jeannie, Jeannie, how are you?!” Monica looked at Jeanne, who was covered in blood. She was frightened.

Her tears kept flowing, and she did not dare to get close to Jeanne.

“Monica, I’m alright,” Jeanne said.

It was the same comforting words again.

Every time Jeanne said these words, Monica felt extremely uncomfortable.

Jeanne was about to die, yet she was still considerate of Monica’s emotions.

‘Can’t she treat herself better?!’ Monica thought to herself.

Tears were streaming down her face crazily.

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Edward looked at her.

From the beginning to the end, his gaze was only on her.

“Can you put me down?” Jeanne asked.

Edward did not move. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Put me down,” Jeanne said.

Her voice was very soft.

Even so, she sounded very determined.

“Jeannie, look at yourself. Why are you still trying to be strong? Can’t you be at ease in Fourth Master’s embrace and let him protect you?” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

‘Can she not make us feel so distressed?

‘Don’t make my heart ache!

‘She deserves to be loved.

‘She deserves to be loved by the best man in the world.’

“No,” Jeanne said. She was a little weak, but she still said it clearly, “Melody isn’t dead yet!”

Monica seemed to have noticed at that moment that Finn was seizing a woman.

At this moment, this woman was almost going crazy. She kept wriggling and trying to resist.

In the end, she could not move under Finn’s restraint.

“Fourth Master, thanks for the trouble,” Jeanne urged.

Edward squatted down.

He tried his best to let Jeanne’s feet touch the ground before he gently put her down.

Jeanne was put down.

She slowly stabilized her body.

Then, while wearing Edward’s white shirt, she walked toward Melody step by step.

Finn took a glance at Jeanne. He then glanced at Fourth Master Swan.

Edward gave Finn a look.

Finn nodded slightly.

He let go of Melody, who was already in a crazy state.

Melody was suddenly let go.

As she had used all the strength in her body, she fell hard at that moment.

She fell directly under Jeanne’s feet.

At this moment, Melody’s body seemed to be in pain. She was stunned for two seconds. After two seconds, she suddenly wanted to get up.

Jeanne stepped on Melody’s face hard.

She stepped hard on Melody’s face with her bare foot, making it impossible for her to get up.

Due to Melody’s violent resistance, her face continued to rub against the ground, causing blood stains to appear.

At this moment, Melody did not seem to feel any pain. She resisted desperately.

She kept cursing, “Jeanne, you b*tch! You b*tch, let go of me! Let go of me!”

“Dr. Jones.” Jeanne did not hear what Melody was saying. She just did not want to hear it. She called out to Finn softly.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly. He looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne asked, “Can you bring Monica out first?”

There were some cruel scenes that she did not want Monica to see.

She did not want to scare Monica.

Finn nodded.

He stood up and walked toward Monica.

Monica was also shocked by the cruelty that Jeanne suddenly displayed.

She had never seen Jeanne like this before. She suddenly felt that Jeanne had become very scary.

It was as if she suddenly felt that Jeanne was a little fearsome.

What had Jeanne experienced all these years such that she became like this?

Jeanne was covered in wounds but was able to stand tall. It made Monica’s heart ache so much.

Finn held Monica’s hand.

Monica was stunned.

She looked at Finn.

Monica instinctively wanted to resist, but when she saw his hand covered in blood, she gave up resisting.

Besides...

Jeanne had asked her to leave.

Monica knew that Jeanne did not want her to know some things.

She bit her lip and followed Finn out.

After a few steps, Micheal suddenly stepped forward and pulled Monica over.

Finn took a look at Micheal.

Micheal had held Monica in his arms.

Monica did not resist.

Nor was she in the mood to resist.

All her thoughts were on Jeanne at the moment.

She had been thinking about what Jeanne had gone through all these years.

“I’ll send you home. Jeanne is fine now,” Micheal said.

As he said that, he held Monica and left.

Eden, who was standing next to Micheal, hesitated for a moment before leaving with them.

When he left, he could not help but take a look at Melody, who was pinned down by Jeanne with one foot and lying on the ground in a sorry state. She did not look as arrogant as she usually did. She looked like she was in a terrible state.

Actually, when Eden entered this barn, he was very anxious.

He could not accept it.

Jeanne was still alive.

She was still alive.

Melody did not kill Jeanne in the end!

She was indeed useless.

Eden gritted his teeth and left.

He did not know if he could deal with Jeanne again in the future. That said, at this moment, he could only be glad that he was not really implicated.

Hence, he left with Micheal and the rest.

Finn stood there.

He stood there and watched as Micheal took Monica away.

In the barn, other than the unconscious people on the ground, there were only Edward, Jeanne, Melody, and Finn, who had his back facing them.

Melody was making a big fuss on the ground regardless of her image.

“Jeanne! Let go of me! I dare you to let go of me!” Melody screamed.

It was as if she had lost her voice from shouting.

Jeanne let go of her.

She retracted her leg. After Melody obtained her freedom, she suddenly got up from the ground.

The moment she got up, she swiftly pounced in a direction on the ground.

Jeanne’s eyes tensed up.

Her body moved slightly and with a kick, she ruthlessly kicked the black pistol even further away.

Melody’s heart froze.

She fiercely looked at Jeanne.

She saw Jeanne look down at her from above.

No.

Just now, Melody was the one who had treated Jeanne like this.

Melody could not accept being treated like this by Jeanne instead.

She got up from the ground.

She got up and stood up straight.

Melody’s face was covered in blood, and her hair was messy. She looked pathetic.

At this moment, she saw Jeanne suddenly approach her.

She was frightened.

Jeanne was truly scary at the moment.

Even though she looked frail and weak, she carried the smell of blood and seemed terrifying.

Melody could not help but take a step back. She was frightened by Jeanne’s aura.

Ever since she was young, other than her father, she had never been so afraid of anyone…

“Pow!”

Melody only felt a wave of pain on her cheek.

Jeanne seemed to have wanted to knock her out with that slap.

However, before Melody could react, her body was kicked hard onto the ground again.

After the kick, she fell to the ground. The pain made her tears flow continuously.

She endured the pain and fiercely shouted at Jeanne, “Kill me if you can!”

“Kill you?!” Jeanne sneered, “Before I kill you, shouldn’t I let you experience what it means to live a life worse than death?!”

Melody was startled.

She felt that Jeanne was even more horrifying than she thought!
