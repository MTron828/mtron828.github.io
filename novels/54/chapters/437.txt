He nodded with his eyes closed before holding Jeanne’s hand and walking straight in. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In the hall from the main door, two rows of at least 20 people were standing at the front desk to welcome them.

As they walked past, everyone bowed.

Jeanne was shocked.

Did Edward get to enjoy such high treatment every day?

She followed Edward and walked toward an elevator, which was obviously a private elevator.

When the staff at the elevator saw Edward arrive, they hurriedly pressed the button.

The elevator seemed to have been on the first floor for a long time, so as soon as the button was pressed, it opened.

Edward walked in, still holding Jeanne’s hand.

The staff at the elevator also followed them in and respectfully pressed the button to go up as if they were ready to take orders at any time.

Soon, the elevator arrived on the 32nd floor.

The floor was reserved for the president, or in other words, the entire floor was all Edward’s,

When the elevator door opened, a few employees were already waiting outside. They formed two rows, bowing at Edward’s arrival.

......

As if he was used to it, Edward brought Jeanne into his huge office.

It was really huge, and she had never seen such a huge office in her life. Her initial estimate was that it was more than 200 square meters.

That guy really knew how to enjoy himself.

“President.” A female secretary followed them into the office. “Let me report today’s schedule to you...”

“Other than the 10 a.m. senior management meeting today, push all the other agendas on the schedule for me.”

“Yes.” The female secretary asked respectfully, “Would you still like black coffee, President?”

“No. I’ll have a cappuccino today.”

The secretary was stunned.

Their president had never consumed sugar, not to mention such sweet coffee.

“I’m going with my mood.” Then, Edward ordered, “Two cups.”

“Yes,” The secretary quickly said before leaving.

Edward sat in front of his desk while Jeanne sat on his guest sofa.

The two of them were really far apart.

When the secretary gave Jeanne and Edward a cup of coffee each, Jeanne thanked her.

The secretary smiled and left.

After she left, she started to lose her cool.

However, the female secretary was not the only one losing her cool. Everyone in the company was too.

The secretary sat in front of the computer and sent a message to the private group of the company’s employees.

“I saw the President’s wife up close. She’s much more beautiful in person!”

“Really? I took a look from afar today and saw her and the president show up together. The two of them are really a perfect match.”

“I always thought that our president was unworthy of anyone.”

“Why did the President bring his wife to work?”

“He’s newly married.”

“Let me tell you.” The female secretary typed.

The group was in an uproar.

Even when she typed, she missed out on a lot of information.

“Usually, the President drinks black coffee without sugar, but today, he ordered two cappuccinos and said he wanted to go with his mood. “This means he’s very happy at the moment because he has his wife to accompany him.” The secretary typed excitedly. “I’ve been by the president’s side for so many years, and I’ve never seen him smile more than a few times. But ever since he has gotten married, he seems to smile every day...”

“I’m so envious of the President’s wife...”

“Me too.”

There would never be any secrets in a company.

Soon, the news of the private group spread among all the smaller companies of the Swan Enterprise, so everyone knew that the president had brought his wife to work today.

It even spread to Swanhaven Bank, which was under Swan Enterprise.

At that time, Eden was about to leave for a meeting at the headquarters.

He was also a little surprised when he suddenly received an emergency meeting from the higher-ups yesterday.

In the past, for senior management meetings of that scale, they would usually be notified two weeks in advance.

When he walked into the elevator, he heard two female employees talking. “I heard that over at the headquarters, the President brought Madam to work.”

“I heard that too.”

“The people at the headquarters said that the President’s wife is extremely beautiful.”

“I’ve never seen her in person, but I’ve seen her on the tabloids. Her looks are really impeccable...”

Eden’s expression changed slightly.

The assistant beside him instantly noticed the change in his emotions and looked at the two female employees behind him.

The female employees immediately fell silent.

The moment the elevator arrived, Eden walked out with a cold expression and sat in his car.

Meanwhile, the assistant sat in the front passenger seat.

As the car drove to Swan Enterprise’s headquarters, Eden said coldly, “Did my Fourth Uncle bring Jeanne to the company?”

The assistant quickly replied, “There was gossip in the company today, and I heard that was the case.”

Eden’s face darkened.
