1048 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

To Monica, she would not let go of even a glimmer of hope.

At 6 p.m., she brought Steve to Richie Sanchez’s dinner.

Just as she got to the ground floor of the Cardellini Enterprise building, a little boy suddenly ran out from the side, quickly rushed to Monica’s side, and used all his strength to push her.

“You’re a bad person!”

Monica was pushed back a few steps by the little boy’s brute force.

At that moment, Steve stepped forward and pulled the little boy away, ruthlessly restraining him.

Monica also stared at that boy, who was about eight years old and looked very irritable. He gave off a feeling that he was rude and annoying.

“Who are you? Why are you here to beat people up? Get out of here!” Steve lectured the little boy.

The boy frantically tried to break free from Steve’s grasp, but he could not.

With a red face, he shouted at Monica, “You evil woman, nothing good will come to you!”

“What nonsense are you spouting?” Steve was furious.

“I’m talking about her! Her family’s business is about to go bankrupt, but she just had to vent her anger onto others. What right do you have to stop my dad from jumping ship? What right do you have to find someone to defame him? You evil woman, you will get your retribution one day!” The boy cursed.

Only then did Monica come back to her senses.

At first, she thought that the boy had mistaken her for someone else. After all, Monica had not done anything outrageous, so it was unlikely that she would become enemies with a kid.

However, she understood now. It turned out that he was the son of a researcher.

It was true. The things she told Nox to do could directly ruin the reputation of those research and development staff who betrayed Cardellini Enterprise, and they would never be able to establish themselves in South Hampton City!

“You evil woman, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been ridiculed by my classmates and forced to drop out of the best primary school in South Hampton City. It’s all your fault. You’re a bad person. I’m going to beat you to death!” The little boy kept on yelling and cursing.

Steve seemed to have run out of patience, so he called two security guards over to send the little boy away.

However, Monica walked over and said to the little boy, “You see the damage you’re suffering right now, but do you see mine?”

The little boy refused to listen. “What are you suffering from? My dad said that your incompetence was what caused Cardellini Enterprise to go bankrupt. Why should my dad pay for your family? You’re a failure! You’re a failure!”

The boy was making a scene.

...

“What’s there to argue about?” Steve could not take it anymore. He shouted at the boy, “Did your father not tell you how he left the company?! Your father deserved to be taught a lesson after what he did–”

“Alright. That’s enough!” Monica interrupted Steve.

Steve held it in.

He also did not think it was a good idea to say that to the child.

After all, most children respected and worshipped their fathers. Revealing a child’s father’s misdeeds may also affect the child’s development.

However, he could not stand watching that boy criticize Monica so matter-of-factly.

Monica said to the boy, “Yes, I’m a failure, and I’m a very bad person! I ruined your dad’s reputation, but what can you do about it? Let me tell you, in this world, the winner takes all. If you can make a scene with me, you might as well spend more time and effort studying so that you can take revenge on me in the future!”

“You!” The boy’s face turned red at Monica’s words.

Monica looked at Steve and said, “Let’s go.”

Steve let go of the little boy fiercely, glared at him, and left with Monica.

The moment they left, the boy did not seem appeased. He quickly ran to Monica and wanted to hit her again.

...

This time, before Steve could grab the little boy, Monica pushed the little boy away hard, pushing the little boy to the ground.

The little boy started wailing in pain.

However, Monica was unmoved. She even looked a little cruel as she said, “Don’t let me see you again, or I’ll beat you to death!”

Frightened by Monica’s sudden appearance, the boy quickly got up from the ground and ran off.

Monica did not waste any more time and got into the black car next to her.
