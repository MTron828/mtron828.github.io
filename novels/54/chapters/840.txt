Chapter 841 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

“Fourth Master was carried back? Is he injured?” Monica was surprised.

“He’s seriously injured, so Dr. Jones and Young Master Winter will be staying to take care of him.”

“What happened? Why is he so seriously injured?” Monica was puzzled.

Teddy shook his head.

He was not too sure.

In the past, he would often accompany the fourth master on business trips and deal with some non-family matters for him. He did not know when it started, but Young Master Nox had been accompanying the fourth master on all his trips instead. Teddy always felt that something big was about to happen.

Monica saw that Teddy really did not know, so she did not ask further.

She said, “I’ll wait for George in the hall downstairs. Tell him that I’m waiting for him when he wakes up.”

“Alright,” Teddy said.

Monica left Fourth Master Swan’s room and returned to the living room.

In the living room, Nox sat on the sofa and watched TV. He glanced at Monica but did not say anything.

Monica also sat on the sofa very naturally, but she kept a distance from Nox.

Nox was unhappy with Monica, but in the end, he endured it and did not shoo Monica away.

Monica was a little absent-minded.

She did not know where Jeanne had gone!

‘Why did Jeanne suddenly disappear?’

She looked at Nox.

If she asked Nox, he definitely would not answer.

After thinking for a while, she took out her phone to call Jeanne.

However, the reply she got was still the robotic female voice. “The number you have dialed is unavailable…”

Monica was a little restless.

She gritted her teeth and could not help but ask Nox, “Where did Jeannie go? ”

Nox ignored Monica.

“Nox, I’m asking you a question. Where did Jeannie go?” Monica was also a little angry.

Ever since she was young, she had a bad temper.

“Is that any of your business?”

“F*ck,” Monica cursed.

She was angered by Nox.

“Besides, I have nothing to do with Jeanne. How would I know where she is? Aren’t you the best of sisters? Is your friendship fake?” Nox mocked.

Monica was infuriated by Nox.

She was furious.

She was filled with anger when she saw Nox holding the remote control and watching TV leisurely.

‘F*ck.’

Monica suddenly stood up, walked in front of Nox, and snatched the remote control from his hand.

Just as she was about to turn off the television, Nox suddenly grabbed Monica’s wrist tightly.

“Ah!” Monica called out.

It hurt.

Nox had just grabbed the wound on her wrist.

At this moment, he was using a lot of strength, and the pain made her eyes turn red.

Despite that, Nox did not notice at all. He pulled Monica hard, forcing her to fall directly onto the sofa.

Normally, this would just be a small fight. The sofa was soft and would not cause any harm to Monica.

Nox was just deliberately venting his emotions on Monica.

Who knew…

When Monica was forcefully pulled to the sofa by Nox, she instinctively used her palms to support her body. She first placed her hands on the sofa before her body fell. At that moment, due to the strength of her wrists, her newly stitched wound seemed to have split open.

“Ouch…” Monica fell onto the sofa, her face pale from the pain.

Nox thought Monica was pretending and was about to laugh at her.

She saw Monica holding her wrist with her other hand, and a lot of blood flowed through the gaps between her fingers.

Nox was also shocked at that moment.

He hurriedly went over. “Monica, what the hell?”

Although his tone was not good, it was obvious that he was concerned.

At that moment, Monica was in so much pain that she could not speak. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She bit her lip tightly, tears flowing from her eyes in pain.

Just as Nox was about to take Monica to the hospital...

Finn, who had left, appeared with a simple luggage bag.

When Nox saw Finn, it was like he saw his savior.

He hurriedly went over. “Come and see what’s wrong with Monica! I just pushed her a little and her hand became bloody.”

Nox felt baffled after saying what happened.

‘Do I have thorns on my body?’

Finn glanced at Monica, who was sitting on the sofa. In the end, he followed Nox.

When he walked over, he saw Monica covering her wrist with great force. Perhaps she did not notice Finn’s sudden arrival. She forced herself to say, “Nox, take me to the hospital…”

The doctor said that she had lost a lot of blood last time.
