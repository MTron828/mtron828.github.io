Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m going to wash up. Y-Y-You’re lecherous!”

After that, Jeanne hung up the phone angrily. She threw her phone to the side, lifted the blanket, and went to the bathroom to wash up.

It had got to be a joke.

The woman in the mirror had a ruddy, charming, and attractive face. She was... glowing beautifully.

Jeanne gently bit her lips.

Suddenly, the corner of her mouth curled into a smile. It was a lonely smile, which was a contrast to her charmingly attractive face.

At that moment, the only thought in her head was that one day, would everything she had disappeared into thin air?

Would she return to her original self?

She adjusted her emotions, thinking, ‘Is this what people mean by great pleasure will bring about sadness?’

When she was too happy, she would think of many tragic things.

She quickly washed up and went downstairs.

Downstairs, George had just woken up, and Teddy was guiding a groggy George to the breakfast table.

Jeanne walked over and touched her son’s head out of habit. “Are you not awake?”

“Yeah.” George nodded his head in a daze.

“Why don’t you go to school later today? After all, sleep is the most important.” Jeanne doted on him.

Teddy stared at Jeanne with wide eyes, speechless.

It was a typical case of a loving mother spoiling her son.

When George heard his mother’s words, he hurriedly got down from the dining table, went to the sofa at the side, and lay stiffly on it.

“Madam, I don’t think this is a good idea to let the young master do that,” Teddy could not help but say. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

By then, Jeanne was eating her breakfast slowly.

“Why is it not a good idea?” Jeanne was very calm.

“If you do that, the young master might develop a habit of quitting whenever something happens. He won’t learn to be independent and brave. It will be very bad for the young master’s future development. I think the young master should get up and go to school–”

“School work is too easy for George, so it doesn’t matter whether he goes to school or not.” Jeanne stopped Teddy. “On the contrary, the growth rate for his body is too slow, and sleeping helps him grow taller.”

Teddy thought, ‘What kind of reason is that?’

However, Jeanne quickly finished her breakfast. Then, she wiped the corner of her mouth elegantly. “Send George to school when he wakes up. I’m heading off now.”

Teddy looked at Jeanne’s silhouette and then at George, who was sleeping soundly on the sofa.

He was thinking whether there could be a mistake about George being a genius!

…

In Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was in a meeting. She was delegating work about hiring senior managers for Lawrence Enterprise.

The matter of Lawrence Enterprise’s employee transfer and layoffs of the senior managers caused some unrest in a small part of the business industry. No one had expected that the conflict between Lawrence Enterprise and its senior management would end harmoniously. Regardless of whether they were demoted or laid off, everyone in the senior management gladly accepted it. Some even posted their gratitude to Lawrence Enterprise over the years on their personal social media platforms.

Other than Lawrence Enterprise, no one else in South Hampton City could benefit from demoting and laying off their employees.

In the past, there were always rumors that Lawrence Enterprise and its senior management were on bad terms. Now, it seemed that... the only ones on bad terms with the senior management was the former leader. The current leader clearly had amazing leadership.

The current leader…

Alexander looked at the news and was about to explode in anger.

Even until this day, Jeanne had not invited him to be a part of the company’s recruitment. It seemed she really wanted to take over the company, did she not?

Jeanne’s ambition was a little too big.

He read the news fiercely until someone knocked on the door.

Alexander put down the newspaper and said coldly, “Come in!”

Joshua pushed the door open and entered.

“Why are you here and not at work?” Alexander was in a bad mood.

He had not been treating Joshua kindly recently.

In the past, it was fine because there was no one to compare Joshua with. However, now that there was Jeanne to compare, Joshua was simply useless!

“Dad, I came to look for you to discuss something.” Joshua also felt wronged.

He had suffered a lot during this period of time.

Whether it was his grandfather or his father, they had been ignoring, scolding, or even beating him.

At the end of the day, it was all because Jeanne came back!

“What do you have to discuss with me? “Alexander said impatiently.

“Mom told me something last night.”

“What did she say?” Alexander’s face darkened.

“Dad, I’m on your side. You can’t hide everything from me. I can help you too.” Joshua was a little unhappy.

Could his dad not look down on him?
