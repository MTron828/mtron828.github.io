Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“As for whether you believe me or not, all I’ll say is that, by being here and recording the video, I’m leaving behind evidence. If what I said just now was wrong, Zoe can take this video to court and sue me. But if Zoe doesn’t dare to sue, it means that everything I said is true.” Shelly looked into the camera as if she was trying to control her emotions.

After a while, she said, “I’m very sorry to have caused Nox so much trouble. I hope everyone will believe in Nox’s innocence.”

Then, the video recording ended. The man could not help but clap his hands.

He was really surprised that Shelly managed to finish the recording in one go. Moreover, she was not nervous at all, and there was not a single mistake in her lines.

“Is that alright?” Shelly reacted calmly to the man’s praise.

She just wanted to settle everything as soon as possible and cut ties with Nox, so she was very cooperative and serious.

“Wait a moment.”

The man turned around and walked to Nox, who was at the side playing games on his phone. Seeing Nox’s gloomy expression, the man did not dare to disturb Nox, so he just stared at Nox from the side

Shelly also looked at Nox from the side, watching him take everyone for

Shelly also looked at Nox from the side, watching him take everyone for granted and wasting everyone’s time. It seemed like rich people really had the right to be arrogant. No wonder everyone in the world was greedy for money.

After 20 minutes, Nox finished the game. However, he ignored everyone else and started another game.

The man could not hold it in any longer. While Nox was choosing a character, he asked respectfully, “Mr. Winter, we’ve recorded the video. Do you want to take a look?”

“What do you think?” Nox’s eyes was fixed on the phone screen, seemingly unconcerned about the matter at hand.

“I think it’s pretty good.”

“Is that so?”

“Mr. Winter, you can take a look at it.” the man suggested.

“When I’m done with this game.”

“Alright.”

While Nox was playing games, everyone was by his side, watching him play.

Just like that, Shelly watched as Nox behaved rudely in the game. He would even start a voice chat and scold his teammates.

All the staff members in the room waited quietly for Nox until finally, he finished a game.

The man quickly said, “Mr. Winter, I’ve put the video on TV. Please take a look.”

“Wait!” Nox’s expression was ugly. “Can’t you see how badly I lost?” The man held it in and did not dare to say anything else.

Then, Nox started another game. The moment he started choosing the character, Shelly walked over and took Nox’s phone. Now, Nox looked furious, and none of the staff in the room dared to breathe loudly.

They did not expect Shelly to be so domineering that she would snatch the phone from Mr. Winter’s hand. At that moment, she seemed very different to the woman before, who did whatever she was told and did not seem to have a temper.

“Watch the video first,” Shelly said.

Nox’s expression was cold.

“Once you’ve watched the video, you can play as long you want,” Shelly said bluntly. “I don’t have that much time for you to waste!”

“Give me back my phone!” Nox said coldly, not caring what Shelly was saying.

“Watch the video first.” “Give me back my phone!”

“I say, watch the video first!”

As Shelly’s presence grew stronger, Nox’s expression became more unsightly.

The staff members in the room were really shocked, and the man closest to them wanted to disappear from the spot. After all, no one in Harken dared to offend Nox.

In Zoe’s case, she had to go against Nox because she had no other choice. If she did not fight back, she would be left with nothing, so she could only take the risk. However, that woman in front of him… She was really courting death.

Nox suddenly stood up from the sofa, his aura overbearing. Immediately, Shelly was one head shorter than Nox. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Shelly, I’ll say it again. Give me back my phone-”

“Slam!” Shelly returned it to him by throwing it hard at him, and when it fell to the ground, the sound of the phone screen shattering rang out.

The air in the room was really tense, and Nox’s expression was grim.

“Shelly, do you have a death wish?” Nox was so angry that he gritted his teeth and his body trembled.

He clenched his fists so tightly that he might hit her in the next second..
