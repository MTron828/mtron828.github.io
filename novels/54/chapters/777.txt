Chapter 778: Eden’s Regret, A Tragic End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Eden never expected this.

Everything he had done to set up and frame Jeanne had come back and bite him in the *ss instead.

He had never thought that he would one day fall into that b*tch, Jasmine’s hands.

He watched the live stream and saw all kinds of vicious criticisms against him.

The image he had once established as a good man, a good son and a good husband was all ruined today.

His eyes were red, and he looked enraged.

Although he had fallen into Jasmine’s hands, in reality, he had fallen into Jeanne’s hands.

The moment he thought of Jeanne, how arrogant she was, and the pain he had suffered because of her…

“Clang!” Eden’s fist slammed hard on his desk.

Even though he did not hold a high position in the Swans’ subsidiary company, he still had his own office.

Such a loud noise was sure to startle the people outside, and everyone knew why he lost his temper.

Other than the live broadcast, all the major websites had begun to spread the news of Jenifer being utterly humiliated at the press conference today and how she tore apart Eden’s nice-person facade.

Eden had instantly turned from a good man to a sc*mbag. He had fallen from grace!

He clenched his fists tightly, and his body was trembling non-stop. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Suddenly, the phone that he had thrown on the ground rang.

Eden took a look at the screen that he had smashed to pieces.

Seeing that it was Michael calling, he picked it up, and because the touch screen was broken, it took him a long time to answer.

“Why aren’t you picking up the phone?” Michael sounded a little unhappy.

“Will picking up the phone change anything?”

“Eden, do you know what you’re facing right now?” Michael asked.

Eden sneered, “What am I facing?! I just sentenced myself to death, didn’t I? Michael, if you hadn’t incited me to order Joshua around, I wouldn’t have ended up like this!”

“No, you would sooner or later.” Michael gave him a definite answer.

Eden’s expression darkened.

“Because you can’t bear to see Jeanne live a good life, and you can’t win against her.”

“Are you still going to make sarcastic remarks now?!” Eden gritted his teeth.

“I was trying to save you,” Michael said bluntly.

“Will you still save me? I’ve lost my reputation and everything. Besides, I’m no use to you anymore, so why would you still help me?” Eden mocked.

“I’m not as cold-blooded as you think.”

Eden clutched his phone tightly, his entire body trembling.

He thought that at that point, there was no way Michael would care about him anymore.

However, he had to admit that he hoped Michael could save him. Otherwise, his life would be ruined.

It was all destroyed.

“I’ll get Jake to pick you up and send you out of Harken first to lie low for a while,” Michael said bluntly.

“What? You want me to leave?” Eden was furious.

“If you don’t leave, are you planning to stay here and wait to go to prison?” Michael asked him.

“If I leave, I’ll have nothing!” Eden roared.

Everything he had as a Swan would be gone, and he refused to accept that.

He was also unwilling to accept that Jeanne could live such a good life!

“Even if you don’t leave, you’ll have nothing.” Michael was calmer than Eden, so he analyzed the situation for him. “You will go to jail. Let’s not talk about whether there’s evidence to prove that you did instruct Joshua to rape Quinn, but the fact that you abused Jasmine is true. Not only did you abuse her, but you even ordered someone to rape her. Think about it. According to the laws of Harken, what kind of sentence will you be sentenced to? I’m guessing it’ll be at least ten years that you’ll be in jail. Then, what do you think is waiting for you after you’re released?”

Eden’s entire body was trembling.

He still wanted to torture Jasmine for cheating on him and for making him give up on Jeanne back then.

He had never thought that Jasmine would one day become the culprit behind his fall!

He had never taken this woman seriously, so it caught him off guard when Jeanne used Jasmine.

He really wanted to strangle Jasmine right now!

“Think about it. The police will come to you in less than half an hour. If you want to leave, now is your best chance. I’ll get Jake to send you out of Harken safely. If you don’t leave, you have to be mentally prepared for the legal punishments that will follow.” Michael looked a little helpless. “As your friend, this is the best I can do for you, but it’s your choice.”
