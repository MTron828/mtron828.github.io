Chapter 1696: How ‘Sweet’ Nox and Shelly Are

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I didn’t force her to do it. Shelly volunteered. I asked twice and she said yes.”

Nox could also sense Jeanne’s disdain for him, so he quickly explained himself. “I think in Shelly’s mind, you’re with her to satisfy your lusty desires.”

“How is this possible?” Nox flew off the handle.

“Whose fault is it that you’re so impatient?”

“Isn’t that what it’s like when two people are together? I refuse to believe that you and Edward don’t do it anymore. If not, where did your children come from?” Nox was getting a little agitated.

“Alright, it’s useless knocking some sense into you. What’s done is done. I can’t stop someone like you from sleeping with her anyway. But if you do sleep with her, you should consider Shelly’s feelings too, not only yours.”

“I have a lot of experience in this, so I know how women feel very well. You don’t have to worry about this.” Nox was pretty satisfied with his skills. Jeanne was speechless. Sleeping with so many women was nothing to be proud

She said, “In any case, put more effort into caring about Shelly. If you lose her again this time, no one can help you.” “I know, I know. I will treat her well.”

“I’ll leave it at that.”

“Alright.”

As soon as she hung up the phone, Edward pulled Jeanne into his embrace.

“You’ve been more concerned about Nox than me recentlv! ”

“He’s so worrisome!” Jeanne was a little disappointed.

In the past, she had always mocked Nox and Edward’s relationship. Yet now, Nox worried her so much that it felt like she was taking care of her son.

“Do you worry about me too?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

“You’re not that childish.’

“For you, I can be childish too.” As he said that, his hug became more intimate.

“Edward.” Jeanne could not take it anymore.

“Call me hubby.” Edward’s charming voice rang in Jeanne’s ears.

“I don’t want to.” Jeanne refused.

“Are you sure?” Edward gently bit Jeanne’s ear.

Jeanne’s body trembled.

“Don’t… Hubby.” Jeanne really could not take it anymore.

When Edward wanted to do it… anytime was the right time. She felt that if she did not obey Edward now, he would swallow her alive.

“Be good.” Edward smiled in satisfaction and licked Jeanne’s earlobe with his tongue.

Jeanne tensed up.

“I did it. Now, let go of me.” Jeanne pushed Edward away.

There were people at home, and they both were on the sofa in the living room. Even though no one was looking at them, they were in a public space. At that moment, Paige was playing with a Barbie doll, while George was playing the piano at the side.

Although it had been a long time since he had touched the piano and George was talented, it did not mean that he could become a great pianist without practice. More importantly, Jeanne thought that what George was learning was too boring, and she wanted to let George build his character more. She was afraid that Edward would train George into an emotionless machine in the end.

As for Teddy, he was busy preparing dinner and did not have the time to look at them. Even so, Jeanne felt uncomfortable.

“Ah!” Jeanne suddenly called out in a low voice.

It was not only because Edward did not let go of her, but he even carried her up from the sofa.

Jeanne was so frightened that she quickly hugged Edward’s neck tightly, and the corners of Edward’s lips curled up into a smile. He was clearly very happy that Jeanne was being intimate with him.

“What are you doing?

“What do you think?” Edward raised his eyebrows. “Edward, dinner is about to start!” Jeanne was exasperated.

“And I’m just about to get started.”

Jeanne was speechless. “Didn’t I call you hubby?” “I didn’t say I wouldn’t eat you up if you called me hubby.” ‘Fine, you win,’ Jeanne thought.

In any case, no one could compare to how horny that man was.

As Edward carried Jeanne upstairs, Paige turned around and seemed unhappy when she saw her mother being taken away by her father.

She got up from the ground and shouted, “Mommy, where are you going? Mommy?

As she shouted, she was about to go upstairs to chase after Edward and Jeanne.

The moment he was about to put Jeanne down helplessly, George walked over from the piano and picked Paige up.

Paige looked at his brother and said aggrievedly, “Daddy carried Mommy away..”
