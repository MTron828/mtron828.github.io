Chapter 147: Jeanne Might Not Be an Ordinary Person

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In fact.

That person had indeed broken down.

Eden gritted his teeth and was so angry that he wanted to kill someone.

Where did Jeanne get the ability to invite the so-called world-class transportation master, Klaus?

Once he really comes to South Hampton City, the traffic problem would just be insignificant. Jeanne borrowed the power of the internet and the compromise she made with the administrative office previously. It would be impossible for the administrative office to reject such a solution that would have the best of both worlds. If they reject it, then they would really be deliberately targeting the Lawrence Enterprise, and the Sanders would not be able to back down.

Eden clenched his fists tightly, and his anger reached its peak.

He admitted that he really wanted to make Jeanne submit to him. Thinking back to the time when he made a mistake that every man would make, Jeanne made such a big fuss that his reputation was almost ruined. In the end, he managed to preserve his reputation and Jeanne was the one in ruins, to the extent that she was even kicked out of the Lawrences. From then till now, Jeanne had not yielded to him even once, which made him feel displeased.

Now that he saw her return with her still beautiful and moving appearance, his desire to make her submit to him became even stronger.

It could not be denied that Jeanne had the innate ability to make all men lose control. Although he had tried his best to forget the existence of this woman all these years, when this woman appeared in front of him again, he would still be tempted. He still wanted this woman to become... his own.

He could not deny that all men had innate bad natures. If they could not obtain something, they would always resort to all means to obtain it.

However, when they finally obtain it, they would have no feelings left for this woman.

Therefore, the things that he had done to Jeanne before this was always to make her submit to him, and even make her his woman.

However,

After this incident, he changed his mind.

He had to.

This woman...

He would definitely make her suffer a fate worse than death!

He was having crazy thoughts, and his suppressed anger made him look very ominous.

The phone rang at this moment.

Eden lowered his head to take a look and picked it up. “Micheal.”

“Have you thought of a solution?”

“No,” Eden said frankly. “If Jeanne really invited Klaus, and if the Sanders rejects this construction, then it will confirm that the Sanders is targeting the Lawrence Enterprise. The Sanders will not be able to answer the people.”

“So, we can only take the risk.” Micheal’s tone was cruel.

Eden held the phone tightly, and his expression changed.

“Get Klaus involved in an accident in South Hampton City.” Micheal made a prompt decision.

Eden’s heart pounded.

“I’ll leave it to you. Can you do it?” Micheal asked.

Eden gritted his teeth. “Yes.”

“It’s mainly because Melody and I have a special identity. There are too many eyes on us. It’ll be difficult to avoid everyone and do something secretly.”

“I understand,” Eden agreed immediately. “Leave it to me. I can do it.”

“It’ll all be up to you tomorrow. If Klaus successfully arrived at South Hampton?City, the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse project would continue. Everything that we had done previously will all be in vain. However, if something happened to Klaus in South Hampton city, not only would this project be shelved, but have you thought about what kind of attack Jeanne would suffer? It would be global.” Micheal reminded him word by word.

Eden was touched. He did not think so much.

He only thought that if something happened to Klaus, this project would not be continued.

He did not think that as an international celebrity, if something happened to Klaus because of Jeanne, then Jeanne... would not be able to get forgiveness from the public even if she apologized.

He looked a little excited. “Jeanne is asking for it. It will be very ugly.”

“Be careful,” Micheal reminded.

“Okay.”

Micheal and Eden exchanged a few more words before hanging up.

Micheal was still in the office at the moment.

Ever since he returned to the country and started working, he had been extremely busy. His goal was to be able to reach a higher position faster.

His father was suddenly diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Although it was not announced to the public, the doctor said that the deterioration was very rapid and it was hard to say how much time was left.

If he wanted to stabilize the position of the Ross, he could only depend on himself. He would resort to any means to support the glory of his entire family. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Something flashed across his eyes as he looked at the caller ID on the screen. He picked it up. “Melody.”

“Did you tell Eden what to do?” Melody was somewhat anxious.
