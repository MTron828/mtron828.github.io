1210 Accompanying Jeanne For A Pregnancy Checkup, Nox’s Condition Improves

“You don’t have to be sorry,” Edward replied bluntly, “because this is what I want to do.”

Zachary was stunned.

“To you, you have to be loyal, but to me, that’s not the case.” Edward said, “Have a good rest.”

“Edward, what are you doing?” Zachary stared at Edward’s departing figure and called out to him in frustration.

“You’ll know soon enough.”

With that, Edward left.

When Zachary wanted to speak again, he suddenly coughed violently.

Edward stopped in his tracks but eventually left.

Wade quickly patted Zachary’s back. “Old Master, calm down. The doctor said you shouldn’t get angry.”

Zachary coughed for a long time and did not stop. He felt like he was about to cough his lungs out until finally, he managed to control it.

The serviettes covering Zachary’s mouth were covered with blood.

“Old Master.” Wade looked at the blood stain and panicked a little.

Zachary waved his hand. Then, he lay back on the bed and said, “It’s almost time, Wade.”

“You can still recover.”

“I know my situation. What I’m worried about now is that Edward is no longer under my control.”

“Old Master.” Wade said in a deep voice, “The winner takes all, and that rule has always been part of history. You can leave it to Edward to decide.”

Zachary seemed to be smiling.

Otherwise, what else could he do?

Edward had never been something that he could control just because he said he could!

…

Early the next morning, dawn had just broken when Edward got up from his bed.

The moment he got up, he woke up the person next to him. Perhaps she did not sleep the entire night.

However, Edward still got out of bed carefully to wash up and get changed.

The moment he left, he turned around to look at Jeanne, whose eyes were closed but a tear was flowing out of the corner of her eye.

Her throat moved slightly.

He leaned over and kissed the corner of her eye, but she reached out and pushed him away. Then, she chose to turn her back to him.

Edward’s throat moved slightly, but in the end, he left with George, who was a little confused because it was too early.

He looked at the Swan family’s residence that was getting further and further away and said, “Dad, will you really come and pick me up?”

“I will.”

He definitely would.

When Edward returned to Bamboo Garden, Finn came over. He was here to do a pregnancy checkup for Jeanne.

“Fourth Master, you’re back.” The moment Finn saw Edward, he was still a little surprised.

He saw that Alex was very busy during that period of time, so he thought that Edward would be busy too.

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

“Perfect timing. I’m going to do a pregnancy checkup for Jeanne now. Let’s go together.” Finn said, “You haven’t seen what your daughter looks like, have you?”

Edward smiled. It was true that had not seen her before.

With that, the two of them walked into the ultrasound room together.

Jeanne was ready, but the moment she saw Edward enter, she shifted her gaze.

Finn frowned. ‘Are these two people… quarreling?’

Fortunately, he did not usually meddle in other people’s business. He pretended not to know anything and began to give Jeanne an ultrasound.

“This is the baby’s head,” Finn said.

As soon as he spoke, the two of them looked over and saw a round head inside.

“Here’s the eye.”

“The nose.”

“The mouth.”

“The ear is here.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“This is her arm. This is her calf, and this is her foot.”

The room was filled with Finn’s voice.

Edward continued to look at the screen, at the tiny figure swimming inside.

“Here.” Finn suddenly emphasized, “This is where you see whether the baby’s a girl or a boy.”

Edward’s expression changed.

“I’m a doctor.” Finn could not help but smile.

Just because he was a doctor he could see it as he pleased?

Edward said, “Let’s see someplace else.”

...

Finn moved the transducer elsewhere.

Then, they heard a sound. “Ba-dump, ba-dump…”

“Is this the sound of a heartbeat?” Edward asked.

“Yes. Her heartbeat is very strong.”

Edward’s lips curled into a smile. He felt so inexplicably moved that he could not help but smile.

When Finn was done with the checkup, he said, “The baby is developing normally.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne thanked him.

Then, as she tried to get up, Edward reached out to help her up.

Jeanne glanced at him but did not reject him.

Edward used a tissue to wipe off the gel on Jeanne’s body, helping her to clean herself.

By then, Finn had already left.

...

As Edward wiped her belly, he looked at her round belly and said, “I suddenly think that life is very magical.”
