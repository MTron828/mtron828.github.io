Chapter 373: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

After eating, Jeanne started to feel sleepy.

Hence, she lay on the ground in the open, looking at the twinkling stars above her head.

Who would have thought that just a second ago, they were still enjoying their time together on the luxurious speedboat? However, they were now homeless for the night.

Her eyes moved.

Edward also lay beside her, hugging her tightly and naturally, making Jeanne feel a little uncomfortable.

Could he not keep his hands to himself in a situation like that?

“I’m cold.” Edward whispered in her ear, “And your body is very warm.”

Her? Warm? She was as cold as ice.

At that moment, Edward had already put out the fire as he was afraid that someone would discover them.

“But only I know how warm your body is.”

In Jeanne’s head, she prayed. ‘Please don’t do it.’

Just like that, the two of them hugged each other tightly.

In fact, if Edward had not put himself so close to her, she, too, would get close to him.

......

After all, nobody would want to freeze to death here, so the two of them hugged each other and fell asleep.

Their bodies needed sleep to recover after a long day, and they fell asleep very quickly.

The night was quiet.

Occasionally, they could hear the sounds of birds chirping in the night, and their breathing was very regular.

At that very moment, the two of them suddenly opened their eyes.

The next second, they immediately got up from the ground, stood up quickly, and ran forward in a panic.

Even before their bodies seemed to have fully woken up, they had started to run for their lives.

Edward held Jeanne’s hand and quickly shuttled through the forest. Other than moving forward, they had no aim.

In a slightly hurried voice, he whispered, “It’s not Nox.”

It turned out it was the men who were after them.

With that, Jeanne nodded, and they both ran through the forest at lightning speed.

They could feel there were a lot of people behind them, chasing after them relentlessly. It seemed like those men had discovered their tracks.

They ran for a long time until suddenly, a huge pit was in front of them.

In the dark jungle, danger was everywhere. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Hence, they fell down abruptly, with Edward hugging Jeanne tightly in his arms.

As soon as Jeanne fell, she directly landed on Edward’s body.

“Edward...”

“Shh. I’m fine,” Edward replied.

Jeanne nodded.

The two of them sat up from the ground quietly as if paying attention to the movements of the men behind them.

If they fell, those men behind them might fall too, and if they all fell…

They did not know how many people the other party had with them. More importantly, they did not know what kind of weapons the other party had.

Edward said, “I’ll go up first and draw them away.”

“Edward.”

“Once I draw them away, you will run in the opposite direction, “Edward warned. “Try not to fight head-on with the other party. If you can avoid it, avoid it.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth, not knowing how to answer. Without a doubt, that was the best way to protect her.

Then, Edward put the watch on Jeanne’s wrist.

Jeanne was surprised.

“As long as this watch isn’t lost, Nox will definitely come and get you,” Edward said.

Without saying anything else, he quickly climbed up from the pit. Only after that did Jeanne hear some footsteps, which were followed by more footsteps.

Jeanne seized the opportunity to climb out of the pit and leave in the opposite direction of Edward.

At that moment, she was left alone.

She admitted that her survival ability in the wild was not the greatest.

She had a change in career after all, so many of her exquisite skills could not be compared to professional killers.

However, Kingsley’s position for her was also very clear. All she needed was the basic ability to protect herself and survive, but the key to her was her brain.

Therefore, under the circumstances where her skills were not good, she could be smarter than many professional killers.

She turned around and headed back to where they had just passed by because the so-called most dangerous place was the safest place.

At a time like that, no one would go back to search for them.

With that thought, she sped up again.

It took her a long time in the dark night before she finally returned to the place where she and Edward camped out just now.

By then, there was only a pile of hay leaves and a pile of scorch marks that were buried in the soil.

Jeanne sat on the dried grass.

The world was very quiet.

It was 3 a.m. in the morning, and the sky was still dark.

Jeanne hugged her body and waited for dawn.

She did not know how Edward was doing or if he could really escape from those men by himself.
