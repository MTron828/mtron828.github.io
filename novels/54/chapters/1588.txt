“Yes,” Grandpa Winter replied. Instead of sounding happy, he calmly accepted his grandson’s marriage.

“With Zoe,” Nox said deliberately.

“I’m not senile yet.” Grandpa Winter glanced at Nox. “Haven’t you always been against it?”

“Will you not marry her if I object?” Grandpa Winter asked.

Nox pursed his lips.

“It’s getting late. Hurry back.”

“You just don’t like me.” Nox was unhappy. “In that case, why did you come?”

Upon hearing that, Nox left angrily.

As expected, he was not his grandfather’s biological grandson. Every time, he would come to see his grandfather with hope, only for his grandfather to piss him off.

If Edward came to see his grandfather, he would be so excited that tears would well up in his eyes. Maybe Edward was his biological son!

Wade watched as Nox left and closed the door. Then, he put down the pen and ink in his hand and picked up the phone beside him. “Have you found anything?”

The other party was extremely respectful.” Old Master Qin, I’ve found out everything. Do we need to negotiate with them?”

“No need.” Wade said bluntly,” We’ll expose it on Nox’s wedding day.” “…Is that appropriate?” the other side could not help but ask.

Did Old Master Winter want the whole world to know that Young Master Winter had been cuckolded? After all, getting married was the most proud time of one’s life.

“Who’s fault is it that he refuses to listen to my advice? He deserves it!” Wade was very determined.

“Alright.” The other side agreed.

In the end, Wade could not help but sigh in his heart.

As expected, Nox was his biological grandson. If Nox was not his biological grandson, he would not be able to do such a cruel thing! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nox left the Winters’ residence and returned to his high-class apartment. When he opened the door, he saw Zoe sitting on the sofa in the living room, waiting for him.

“Why are you here?” Nox was a little surprised.

“Don’t you miss me?” Zoe pretended to be angry.

“No, I thought you were going to accompany your parents tonight to discuss our marriage.”

“My parents are very satisfied with you and our marriage. They can’t wait to marry me to you as soon as possible. They have nothing to discuss. They’re just looking forward to you coming to pick me up,” Zoe said sweetly.

Nox smiled. “There are still ten days left. Tell your parents they don’t have to be so anxious.”

“Hmph! Aren’t you anxious to get married to me?” Zoe was acting like a spoiled child.

“I’m very anxious. I can’t wait to marry you immediately.”

“How annoying.”

The two of them were flirting, and just like that, they brought the conversation to bed.

“Nox…”

“My mom said to have children early.”

“Are you really willing to have a child with me? I always thought that you would reject the idea. After all, you don’t seem like someone who wants to be a father-”

“People change at a certain age. Seeing that my grandfather’s hair has turned white, I wish for him to be around to see my child being born.” Although Nox had been disrespectful to his grandfather, the person he admired the most was still his grandfather.

“Alright, as long as you like it, I’ll have as many of your children as you want immediately.” Zoe knew how to please Nox.

Nox sincerely felt that marrying Zoe was the wisest decision he had made.

Fortunately, he did not give in to his grandfather’s pressure back then. He even believed that if his grandfather continued to force him and Shelly persisted for a while longer, he might really choose to be with Shelly.

If he had not held on for a while longer, it would be too late for regrets now!

In The People’s Hospital of South Hampton City, Shelly carried Bella to the hospital to see the doctor.

It was only a low fever, but it suddenly turned into a high fever in the middle of the night. Shelly did not dare risk it and quickly carried Bella to the hospital. Seeing that Bella had a serious fever, the doctor immediately put her on an IV driD.

Shelly held Bella in the outpatient clinic to receive her liquids, while Bella lay listlessly in Shelly’s arms. Shelly, who actually exhausted after a day of work, fell asleep in a daze as she held Bella.

Then, she heard someone beside her shout, “It’s drawing blood! It’s drawing blood!”

Shelly was startled by the sound and quickly woke up. That was when saw that the drip tube in Bella’s hand had recovered a lot of blood.

Shocked, she quickly called for the nurse.” Nurse, nurse, my daughter’s drip is done. It’s drawing her blood now.”

The nurse quickly came over. When she saw that, her expression changed. She quickly squatted down to do emergency measures. As she did so, she complained, “What kind of mother are you? You didn’t even know that it has drawn so much of her blood. Seriously!”

Shelly kept apologizing. As she looked at Bella’s expression, she felt extremely guilty.

The nurse took a long time to finish and pulled out the needle for the IV drip.

“Press on it longer!”

“Okay. Thank you, Nurse.” Shelly quickly thanked her.

The nurse said angrily, “Be more careful in the future. This kind of thing can be dangerous. ”

“Alright.”

“It’s best to come with the child’s father next time.”

“Yes,” Shelly replied and did not explain further.

She pressed on Bella for a long time. After making sure there was no more bleeding, she picked Bella up and left the hospital.

She had just walked out of the outpatient department area when someone suddenly called her from behind. “Shelly.”

Stunned, Shelly turned around and saw a man in a mask. The man quickly took off his mask, and Shelly’s eyes flickered. She did not expect to meet Benjamin Bacon in a place like that..
