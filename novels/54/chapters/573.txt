After that, Alexander’s expression became even more unsightly.

What did she mean by telling him not to worry?

It was clear that she was trying to override his authority.

Lawrence Enterprise had fired or relocated many of their staff, yet he still could not interfere in that matter!

Jeanne could completely see through Alexander’s thoughts. As such, she smiled and said, “Dad, it’s getting late, so I’ll head off now. Also, did grandpa tell you how we convinced the senior managers to leave?”

“Don’t be so smug!” Alexander could not suppress his anger anymore and instantly flew into a rage.

“Dad, you’ve misunderstood. I’m not smug. I just wanted to remind you that if grandpa didn’t tell you, you shouldn’t ask. After all, this is related to some private matters that cannot see the light of day. Grandpa probably doesn’t want too many people to know about it because it will cause some unnecessary trouble. I’m also worried that you’ll ask too many questions and make grandpa unhappy. Moreover, I have a feeling that grandpa probably won’t tell you since he has warned me not to tell anybody.”

“Jeanne, stop that act of yours in front of me. I know very well what tricks you’re playing.” Alexander’s attitude toward Jeanne was clear as day.

After all, Jeanne had been giving him a hard time lately, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

How could he, a man, tolerate it?

Jeanne smiled. She may look very friendly, but in reality, she did not care. She said, “Since you want to think that of me, there’s no point explaining myself. In that case, goodbye.”

Then, Jeanne left.

Alexander looked at Jeanne’s back, with anger seething in his chest.

He could not believe Jeanne left without explaining herself.

She really did not take him seriously, did she?

With a grim expression, he turned around and walked straight to Jonathan’s study. As he knocked on the door, he tried hard to calm himself down and said, “Dad.”

“Come in.” Jonathan seemed to have expected that Alexander would come back to look for him alone, so he was not surprised.

When Alexander went in, Jonathan was drinking tea.

He looked at Alexander. “What do you want?”

“Are you going to indulge Jeanne like that?” Alexander did not beat around the bush.

“I’m not indulging her but using her. Jeanne is useful now, so you just have to do as she pleases and make her feel good at home. Tell Jenifer and Joshua to bear with it.”

“Dad, the more you indulge Jeanne, the more arrogant she will be. Didn’t you see her attitude today? She doesn’t even take me seriously anymore.”

“If you can’t bear it, you’ll mess up the big plan. Let her do as she pleases first.” Jonathan appeared to be very calm.

On the other hand, Alexander was not calm at all. After all, it was related to his interests.

He even felt that at that moment, Jonathan was on Jeanne’s side.

Hence, he gritted his teeth. “Dad, about mobilizing the senior management today, what made all the senior management go with the arrangements?”

Jonathan raised his head and looked at Alexander. “It’s fine as long as the matter is resolved. Why are you asking so many questions?”

“You have to tell me what I did wrong, don’t you? After all, I was in charge of this project previously. Yet now, you want Jeanne to do it? I admit that she is capable and can resolve everything, but you have to let me know how she did it. How should I improve?”

“Since Jeanne can settle it, you can just sit back and enjoy. Alexander, right now, I advise you to treat Jeanne better. The only way to make Lawrence Enterprise better is to use Jeanne. As for you... Don’t you know whether you are capable enough to manage Lawrence Enterprise?”

“I…” Alexander was embarrassed by Jonathan’s words.

“I’ve also thought it through.” Jonathan voiced his opinion, “Instead of going against Jeanne and causing both sides to suffer, why don’t we let Jeanne help us even though she might be scheming against us? It won’t cause us any losses, and we can make Lawrence Enterprise better. There’s nothing bad about it.”

“Father, have you accepted Jeanne?”

“Jeanne is your daughter in the first place. At the very least, she’s also part of Lawrence Enterprise. The prejudice we have towards her is because her mother was too powerful back then. Otherwise, we would’ve groomed Jeanne long ago. If we had done that and nothing happened seven years ago, Lawrence Enterprise might be better than we are now.”
