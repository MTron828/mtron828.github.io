1214 The Love Rivals Meet

Ever since George was sent away by Edward, the relationship between Jeanne and Edward had become… a little delicate.

Jeanne basically ignored Edward. Hence, Edward followed her everywhere she went.

When she took a step forward, he followed.

When she sat down, he also sat down.

When she went to bed, he would sleep next to her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

When she got up to go to the toilet, he… was locked out at the door.

Edward’s lips curled into a smile, and he stood at the door, waiting for Jeanne to come out.

When Jeanne came out, he said to her, “George can come back tonight.”

Jeanne turned to look at Edward.

Edward laughed. “It’s been a week. You’re finally willing to look at me.”

Jeanne shifted her gaze and walked away, with Edward following behind her.

In May, the weather in South Hampton City was good, especially the morning breeze, which was the perfect temperature.

Jeanne was walking in the back garden.

That was because Finn had said that if she were to give birth naturally, she should walk more on top of controlling her diet. Hence, she would do her best to walk around.

As she walked around, Edward accompanied her to walk slowly in the back garden.

“I’ll pick up George in the afternoon,” Edward said.

Jeanne did not reply, so Edward reached out to hold Jeanne’s hand. However, Jeanne shook it off, and Edward held her hand again, so Jeanne shook it off again.

Towards the end, she could not shake him off no matter how hard she tried.

He said, “Don’t be angry. I’ll give you a present.”

He was coaxing her, just like he would coax a child.

Still, Jeanne ignored Edward.

That was when Edward took out a small item from under his clothes and shook it with his hand. “Rattle!”

Jeanne’s expression darkened. “Is this for me?”

“I thought you would never talk to me again.”

Jeanne was furious.

That guy was doing it on purpose.

She was indeed giving him the silent treatment because he sent George away. Even if she knew that she could not blame him, she did not want to accept it.

“This is for you,” Edward said.

Jeanne was stunned as a necklace with red gemstones suddenly appeared in Edward’s hand. Before Jeanne could reject him, Edward had already put it around her neck.

Jeanne was speechless.

“Isn’t your birthday tomorrow?” Edward suddenly said, “Happy Birthday in advance.”

“Why are you gifting it to me in advance?” Jeanne looked at him.

Edward smiled.

Sometimes, Jeanne was so smart that he could not lie to her.

He said, “There’s a state banquet tomorrow, so I have to leave early in the morning and will only be back very late.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“I’m sorry.” Edward apologized.

Jeanne said indifferently, “It’s good that George will be back.”

“George will be with me.”

Jeanne kept quiet.

“From now on, George is no longer just our son.”

“He’ll be a tool for the Duncans, right?” Jeanne mocked.

Edward pursed his lips.

Jeanne turned around and left without expecting an answer from Edward. However, Edward did not chase after her. He just stared at her back silently, lost in thought.

In the afternoon, Edward brought George back.

George almost thought that he would not be able to make it back because the strange place he was sent to was not a good place at all.

Every morning, he would wake up and run for a long distance. After running, he would do a lot of exercises, and they would only let him go to sleep when it was very late at night.

His stamina had always been poor, so he fainted a few times in the middle. Not only that, but the people there even ordered him to kill small animals with a knife.

He did not want to kill small animals. Every time he killed one, he would have nightmares at night. Hence, he did not want to go back there anymore.

This time, he wanted to have a good talk with his father.

However, his father refused. His father said that he had no choice and that had to persevere. His father even told him not to tell his mother because if he told her, it would only make his mother sadder.

Secrets between men should be kept between men to prevent women from worrying.

George was convinced by his father, but he really did not want to go anymore.

When he returned home with his father, his mother was already waiting for him in the living room.

...

The moment she saw him, her eyes turned red.

George’s eyes reddened as well. It was just that when he was at that place, he really, really wanted his parents to appear and take him away.

George could not help but throw himself into Jeanne’s arms.

He did not want to be a man anymore.

He did not want to leave his mother.

Jeanne hugged George too. She knew very well that George would not reveal his emotions unless he really could not control them.

She had no idea what George had gone through, and she did not even dare to think about it.
