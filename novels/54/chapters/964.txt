965 Jeanne and Monica Reunited and Joined Hands to Destroy the Sc*mbag

“Where are you going?” Kingsley asked.

“I think it’s getting late, so I’m going to get up.”

“Are you the one who decides whether to get up or not?” Kingsley frowned.

Lucy stopped talking. Kingsley had been in a bad mood since he woke up, so she did not want to go against him.

Did Millie not take the shot for her just now?

Kingsley put out the remaining half of the cigarette and suddenly pulled Lucy into his arms.

Lucy’s entire face slammed into Kingsley’s chest, and she felt like her nose was smashed. However, in front of Kingsley, she did not dare to show it.

Kingsley then pressed her under him.

Just as Lucy was about to cooperate with him, Kingsley suddenly hugged her again.

Lucy was speechless. Was he throwing a tantrum?

Was it because Kingsley was unhappy that Jeanne had secretly left, so he had to do something that did not conform to his usual routine to vent his frustrations?

One had to know that the insufferably arrogant Kingsley had always dominated the world and would never allow anyone to be above him!

…

After Jeanne left the hotel, she went straight to the hospital, where she heard that Gary was hospitalized.

She walked toward the ward.

In the ward, other than Gary, who was lying weakly on the bed, Ruby was the only one accompanying him.

When she arrived, Ruby was chatting softly with Gary.

Gary would also respond, but they were all simple words, such as “yes”.

If Jeanne had not seen it with her own eyes, she would not have known that Gary’s condition was so serious.

She felt a little upset. On the one hand, she treated Gary and Ruby as her family, and on the other hand, she felt very sorry for Monica.

Monica may seem carefree, but when it came to relationships, be it family, friendship, or love, she was terrifyingly weak. Once she was emotionally hurt, she would be hurt deeply.

“Jeannie?” Ruby seemed a little excited.

She still could not believe that the person standing at the door was Jeanne, so she looked straight at Jeanne and called out to her.

Jeanne returned to her senses.

Her eyes were a little red as she was touched by Ruby’s warmth and her undisguised feelings. She said, “Auntie.”

“Come in.” Ruby quickly took Jeanne’s hand.

Ruby’s palm was very warm. It was the kind of warmth that only an elder could give.

Jeanne asked, “How’s uncle? ”

“He’s in good spirits.” Ruby quickly said.

“I’ll go see him.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes.” Ruby held Jeanne’s hand.

When Gary saw Jeanne, he smiled. “Jeannie is here.”

His voice was very soft, but just as Ruby said, he was still in good spirits. However, Jeanne did not know if Gary was putting on an act so that she would not worry about him.

“Uncle, how are you feeling?”

“I’m fine.” Gary said kindly, “I’m waiting for the heart transplant surgery.”

Jeanne was stunned.

Ruby quickly explained, “Finn suggested that the best thing now is to do a heart transplant for Gary. We understand the risks of the operation and have talked to international experts. Once Gary’s physical condition gets to a point where he has to undergo the operation, we will proceed with it.”

“Alright.” Jeanne did not ask how high the risk would be.

As long as they had made a decision, she would support them unconditionally.

“Is Monica in the company?” Jeanne changed the topic.

“Yup.” Ruby was still a little helpless. “Gary isn’t in good health now, and something has happened at the company, so Monica is there now. She hasn’t worked much, so I don’t know how she’s doing in the company!”

“Don’t worry. Monica is stronger than you think. Besides, I came back this time to help her.” Jeanne quickly comforted them.

Actually, it was not comforting.

She felt that as long as Monica put her heart into it and made up her mind, she would be able to surprise her.

“Jeannie, I really don’t know how to thank you.” Ruby’s eyes were red.

“Aunty, don’t say that. Haven’t you always treated me like your daughter since I was young? So shouldn’t I do something for my parents now?” Jeanne said indignantly because she did not want them to feel bad.

Ruby’s eyes turned even redder. “Yes, yes. You and Monica are both good daughters of mine.”
