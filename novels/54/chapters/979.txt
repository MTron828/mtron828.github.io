980 Finn Is Not Good Enough For Monica

After Monica ended the call with Jeanne, she left the Cardellini Enterprise building.

She had wanted to go straight to the hospital, but she had to attend the press conference at the quality inspection department the next morning. She felt that it was necessary to make a mess for herself, so she went home first.

When she returned, the house was pitch black as the servants were probably asleep.

Monica walked up the stairs of her home, suddenly feeling a little sad. In her heart, a home should not be so cold and empty.

As she was walking to her room, she stopped in front of Sarah’s room.

Sarah had started going to school now, but she still lived with the Cardellinis. Since her mother was not around, the servants took care of her.

However, Sarah did not spend much time in the villa either. When she did not have classes, she would spend most of her time at the hospital.

In fact, Monica was glad that Sarah was around. At the very least, it would make up for the fact that she could not be by her parents’ side.

She knocked on the door, but no one responded. Hence, she immediately opened the door.

There was no one inside.

Was Sarah not back yet?

She made a call as she returned to her room, and the call went through quickly. “Monica?”

“You’re not home yet?”

“No, class ended early today, so I came straight to the hospital to accompany your parents,” Sarah quickly replied.

Monica was really touched.

In the past, she really hated Sarah for fighting for her parents’ favor, but now, she was really grateful that Sarah could accompany her parents in her place.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It’s nothing big. I just wanted to ask how your relationship with Finn has been.” Monica’s tone was very calm.

It was true. She had let go of him completely, and that was why she could be so calm about it.

“Why are you suddenly asking me this?” Sarah did not seem to want to say it.

“As your cousin, can’t I care about your personal matters?” Monica was a little angry.

“You can. It’s just…” Sarah paused. “What do you want to ask?”

“How far have you and Finn progressed?” Monica asked bluntly.

Sarah was stunned, and her face turned red.

Her cousin was too direct, and most importantly, Sarah looked up at Finn, who was sitting opposite her.

After class today, she had come to accompany her aunt and uncle. She was just chatting with them in the room and had completely forgotten that she had homework to do. However, the moment she remembered, she came to Finn with her homework.

Finn was really amazing. He even knew the senior-year mathematics.

Under the pretense of having Finn tutor her with her homework, she shamelessly refused to leave his office.

Finn, on the other hand, did not chase her away. She reckoned that since she was now his fake girlfriend, he would not put on a long face when she asked for help.

However, she had put the phone on speaker when she answered the call just now.

It was mainly because it was too difficult to hold the phone while doing her homework, but she did not expect her cousin to ask her that question.

Her cousin clearly did not care about her private affairs.

Just as she was about to turn off the speaker, Finn grabbed her hand and stopped her.

His eyes were telling her to continue.

Sarah was a little puzzled, but she nodded obediently and said, “It hasn’t developed to that stage yet.”

“Hold hands, kiss, or get in bed together?” Monica was very direct. “Which step exactly?”

“Why are you asking in such detail? Do you still have feelings for Finn?” Sarah was still a little displeased.

Did they not break up? Why did she come and ask her how her relationship was with Finn?

“What are you thinking?” Monica was speechless.

“If not, why do you want to know?”

“I’ll be frank. This morning, Finn talked to me about my dad’s surgery, and I saw him having a wet dream. You know that it’s very abnormal for that to happen to a man. You’ve taken biology class, so you should know that it’s caused by a dissatisfied desire,” Monica explained.

Sarah’s face was red.

She sneaked a glance at Finn and saw his dazed expression.

“Finn has physical needs. As his girlfriend, shouldn’t you satisfy them?”

“Monica, I’m only 18.” Sarah blushed. “My parents won’t allow me to do such a thing.”

“You’re already an adult at the age of 18. There’s nothing you can’t do. Besides, just take it as helping your uncle. Your parents will understand.” Monica tried to persuade her. “You should know how good your aunt and uncle are to you, right? If you satisfy Finn’s physical needs, he’ll be able to perform the surgery on your uncle in his best condition. This is the best way to repay your uncle and aunt!”
