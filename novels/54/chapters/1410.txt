The rest of the people sat at the dining table. Finn took a few more glances upstairs, but in the end, he sat down at the dining table with the others.

Upstairs, Monica knocked on George’s door and entered to see that George was sitting at his desk, already doing his homework.

Monica sat down beside him. “Aren’t you going to have dinner?”

“I don’t feel like eating.”

“Are you angry?”

“I’m not here to persuade you,” Monica said bluntly.

“I know.” George turned to look at Monica.

He knew that his godmother never played by the rules.

“In this world, no one can replace your mother,” Monica said with certainty.

That was the reason George liked Monica so much. In this world, only he and she would remember his mother for the rest of their lives. “But,” Monica continued, “Candice isn’t a bad person.”

“I didn’t say she was.”

“Your father can’t be alone for the rest of his life.” Monica would never treat George as a child when she talked to him.

That brat had an IQmuch higher than hers, and she did not dare to treat him like a child.

“I’m not against his marriage.” George looked at Monica, “Who he likes and who he will be with is his business. It has nothing to do with me. However, I don’t want them to be in my life.”

“Do you know what we care about the most at our age?” Monica asked George. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

George did not answer.

“What I care about the most is my family.” Monica smiled and said, “Because we’re a family, we will be in each other’s lives. It’s not about your father having his own life and you, your own. Once you’re part of a family, you’ll live together as a family, regardless of who you are.”

At that moment, George chose to remain silent.

“I’m not trying to persuade you to get along with Candice. After all, in my opinion, no one can compare to your mother. But George, accepting Candice doesn’t mean that she has replaced your mother. Accepting her is only to complete your family.”

George looked at Monica, who was also looking at him.

Eventually, she smiled, stood up, and patted George’s head. “Of course, you can pretend I didn’t say anything. After all, I don’t know why I’m here to put in a good word for Candice because I feel the same as you. I hate it when she appears in my world, but for some reason, my heart will soften when she’s sad.”

George chose to remain silent.

“I’ll head down now.” Monica did not say anything more.

The moment she left, she suddenly thought of something.

“Oh right, this is your birthday present.” Monica took out a lollipop.

George was surprised because he disliked sweets.

“It’s your mother’s favorite flavor.” Monica smiled.

After George took it, Monica went straight downstairs without saying anything else.

Downstairs, everyone was already sitting around the dining table.

Of course, what Paige ate was different from what they ate, and the nanny had taken her to the side to eat her own nutritious dinner. However, everyone else seemed to be waiting for her to eat.

As Monica walked over, Nox asked, “Where’s George?”

“He said he had to do his homework,” Monica replied. Everyone knew that he would not be coming down for dinner.

“Come and sit down.” Nox did not say much.

Sometimes, when George was really stubborn, no one could persuade him.

Monica walked over hesitantly. She was wondering why Nox was so kind as to invite her over to sit, but it turned out that he had left her a seat next to Finn.

That guy was really despicable at times.

“Why? Don’t you want to sit next to Finn?” Nox even brought it up. Monica smiled, “How could that be? We broke up peacefully.”

Nox glanced at Finn, but Finn ignored him.

When Monica sat beside Finn, she could clearly feel Finn’s body tense up. However, in the next second, it seemed like it was just an illusion.

Nox said, “Even though our main character isn’t joining us tonight, we still have to celebrate, right, Edward?”

Edward glanced at Nox and saw through his little trick. “What do you want to

“Since it’s so rare for us to get together, let’s get drunk!” Nox said excitedly.
