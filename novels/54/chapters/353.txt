Chapter 354: George’s Parent-Child Sports Day

“However, that little brat, George doesn’t seem to have any talent in sports.” Nox sighed.

What a pity. He had such good genetics.

“That might not be the case.” Finn’s gaze was also on George.

Nox frowned, and his expression suddenly changed.

The little brat who seemed to have fallen behind started to exert his strength. On the last lap, he started to speed up and, one by one, surpass all his competitors.

At that moment, Nox got a little nervous. He, who had already prepared himself for George to be ranked last, started to look forward to George’s comeback.

When Monica saw that George was suddenly speeding up, she became even more excited. Her voice was hoarse as she shouted, “George, go! Go! Go!”

George went all out.

In the last few seconds, he quickly overtook the first place and broke through the ribbon!

A champion was born!

While the crowd roared and whistled, Monica immediately ran over and hugged George, who was gasping for air.

At that moment, with Monica hugging him, George found it hard to breathe.

“Monica, let go of George!” Finn and Nox naturally walked over as well.

......

Finn’s voice was a little stern.

Monica was surprised at why the b*stard Finn was there!

“George needs to adjust his breathing now. Let him go.” Finn’s expression was serious.

Monica was unhappy, but she still let go of George.

George was really gasping for air.

With that, Monica squatted in front of George and watched him as he regulated his breathing.

After a while, when George was feeling much better, Monica could not help but say, “How are you so good? Tell me. How are you so outstanding?”

George was a little embarrassed by Monica’s words.

He had actually only used a small technique.

His mother once told him that the secret to long-distance running was to conserve strength in the first half, adjust one’s breathing, follow the rhythm, increase the speed slightly in the second half, and then sprint at the end.

As expected, he won.

“Muah!” Monica suddenly held George’s little face and planted a kiss on it as a reward.

George’s face instantly turned red. It was redder than when he had just finished running.

However, Monica found George even cuter. “Son, I really love you to death.”

George turned his little face to the side. He was clearly embarrassed.

Just then, the teacher walked over. “Next is the relay segment for the parents. Everyone can gather over there and discuss your positions .”

“Okay.” Monica immediately agreed.

She held George’s hand and walked toward the other parents.

There were four families and eight batons.

Everyone was in a heated discussion, and Monica was very active.

“George’s godmother, are you planning to run in high heels?” One of the parents suddenly noticed.

Monica was stunned.

Holy sh*t! She was wondering why she was a little out of place today.

She looked at the pair of super high heels on her feet and felt like she was about to break down.

“How long until it starts? Can I go buy a set of clothes?” Monica asked.

“The teacher said 15 minutes.”

It was definitely too late to buy a set of clothes now.

She gritted her teeth and looked at Nox with an unpleasant expression. “Why didn’t you remind me?”

F*ck. He did not think of that either.

“In that case, what do we do now?” Nox asked. “Do we forfeit?”

“We can’t forfeit! The team has long been divided. If we forfeit, we’ll have less baton compared to the others. We’ll definitely lose,” another parent’s mother hurriedly said.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll take off my high heels and run.” Monica suddenly made up her mind. It was better to run barefoot than in high heels.

At that moment, someone pulled her arm over.

Startled, Monica said, “Finn, what are you doing–”

Finn dragged Monica with him and said, “Nox, wait a few minutes.”

Nox simply stared at their silhouettes.

Monica struggled as she watched Finn pull her away, but she still followed Finn.

Finn came all the way here to deliver clothes!

..

Finn dragged Monica to the parking lot outside the school’s main entrance.

“Finn, what are you doing? I have to participate in George’s parent-child sports day. I–”

“Change!” Finn said loud and clear.

Monica stopped struggling for a moment.

Finn dragged her to his car, opened the door, and pushed Monica inside.

Then, the car door closed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Monica was surprised to see a bag of clothes on the back seat of the car.
