“What’s the matter?” Nox asked. “If we could’ve talked earlier, I would have left earlier so that I wouldn’t have to see her.”

“Nox, did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?” Monica roared angrily.

“Luckily, I did, or the usual me would’ve beaten you to death.”

“F*ck. I will fight it out with you!” Monica was really simmering with rage today.

Jeanne grabbed Monica, who was threatening Nox.

“Enough. You, go to the small courtyard next door and have some tea while waiting for me. I’ll come to you once I’ve spoken to Nox.”

Monica’s eyes were red. “To think I’ve always treated Nox as a friend. What’s up with him today? He’s been mocking me non-stop.”

“I’ve never treated you as a friend. Finn is my friend.” Nox was still trying to provoke Monica.

“Nox, I’m ending my friendship with you right now!” Monica shouted.

“So be it. I’m not afraid of you.”

“That’s enough.” Jeanne dragged Monica away.

Nox looked at Monica and Jeanne’s backs and turned to Edward. “Edward, if your wife is as sensible as you say she is, why would she have such an unreasonable friend like Monica?”

Edward ignored Nox.

Nox said, “I called Finn over just now because I wanted to take revenge on Monica in front of him, but he left. Why do you think he left? I have a hundred ways to piss Monica off.”

“He probably just wants to let it go peacefully. You should mind your own business. Finn is very rational and knows what to do when faced with anything. Just don’t disturb him for the time being,” Edward said bluntly.

Nox pursed his lips and said, “I want to send Finn a few women.”

Edward looked at Nox, speechless.

“Tell me. How could he not have touched Monica after being married to Monica for so many years? I get so angry when I think of it!”

Just as Edward was about to speak, Jeanne returned to the hall. “Nox, come with me for a moment.”

Nox followed Jeanne to the side.

Jeanne took the documents she had placed in the living room when she returned and handed them to Nox.

Nox was baffled. “What are these?”

“Can you help me to investigate these people and see if there is anything that cannot see the light of day?”

Nox frowned. “They are all... part of Lawrence Enterprise’s senior management.”

“Because we’re going to fire them, we want to try and use an abnormal method that would not cause strife.”

“I suddenly think that you, Eldest Young Lady Lawrence, are more scheming than I thought.”

“I’ve never said I’m a good person.”

“That’s true.” Nox nodded and then said, “When do you want it?”

“Can you get it done in a week?” Jeanne asked. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Aren’t you asking a little too much of me?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne affirmed him. “No, this is what you’re good at.”

Nox did not know what to say.

“I’ll wait for your good news.” Jeanne smiled.

Just like that, the matter was settled.

Still, Nox was very confused.

He watched Jeanne returning to Edward’s side calmly and Edward hugging Jeanne quite naturally.

Why did he feel that those two people were showing off their relationship wherever they went?

He shouted at them, “I’m leaving.”

However, the two of them ignored him.

“I said I’m leaving,” he shouted a little louder.

This time, Edward waved his hand, telling Nox to leave and don’t disturb them.

That man was the epitome of forgetting his friends when he had a partner.

Nox drove back.

At that hour, he had yet to have dinner.

Considering it had been a long time since he returned home, he reckoned his parents must have missed him a lot.

Hence, he would go back and give them a surprise.

With that thought in mind, he drove straight back to the Winter family’s home.

…

In the hall in Bamboo Garden, Jeanne pushed her way out of Edward’s embrace and said, “I’m going to look for Monica.”

“You’d better have a good chat with your friend.”

Jeanne was a little speechless.

Nox’s dislike for Chi Mu was expressed in his words, and although Edward was not as childish, she could tell that he was displeased with Monica.

After all, Monica’s actions were really... incomprehensible.

She nodded. “Okay.”

With that, Jeanne walked to the small courtyard at the side.

Meanwhile, Monica was still fuming with anger as Teddy poured a cup of tea for her.

“Teddy, you can head in first.”

“Yes.”

Once Teddy left, Jeanne sat opposite Monica.

Monica asked angrily, “Where’s Nox?”

“He’s left.”

“Damn it. I really wanted to beat him to death.”
