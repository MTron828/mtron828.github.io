Chapter 389: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At that split second, Monica pushed him away. It was as if it was an instinctual reaction to reject Michael from approaching.

Michael looked at Monica. Deep down, the cruelty he felt grew bit by bit.

Monica used every single ounce of her strength to get up again.

This time, Miles walked over and reached out to support Monica. However, Monica did not reject him.

At that, Michael’s eyes turned cold.

Monica had only rejected him, and that rejection could not have been more obvious.

He watched coldly as Miles helped Monica into the wheelchair before Miles pushed Monica in the direction Finn had left.

She did not even look at Michael from the moment he came.

In his head, he could still hear what Monica said earlier. “I’m sorry. I think the person I love is still Fi–”

She did not finish her sentence, but she did not need to because he knew.

“I’m sorry. I still think that the person I love is Finn.”

Michael clenched his fists tightly as he tried his best to suppress his anger.

He watched Monica leave and walk toward Finn right before his hands. His expression was so cold that he looked very cruel.

......

Monica was of great use to him, but even if she were not, he would never let Monica and Finn be together!

It was impossible!

…

In the intensive care unit, Monica had been keeping watch outside while Finn lay inside with his eyes closed.

Both of their faces were very pale.

On the other hand, Miles had also been by Monica’s side the entire time. However, he did not show any emotions and was only carrying out his orders.

In the intensive care unit, a doctor was there to observe Finn’s condition.

Any of the doctor’s movements would make Monica’s heart beat faster. It gave her the hope that Finn would wake up.

However, nothing happened. Not even once did a miracle happen.

She looked through the huge glass window and watched everything happening inside — at Finn, who lay motionless on the bed.

A night had passed, and the sky was already bright, but Finn was still not awake.

Monica saw Finn’s attending physician leading some people into the intensive care unit and performing a series of tests on Finn. Still, he did not wake up.

As the attending physician walked out, Monica looked at him.

She did not dare to ask.

She was really afraid of knowing all the results.

The attending physician said, “The situation isn’t looking good.”

What did he mean by not looking good?

“Dr. Jones hasn’t shown any signs of waking up for the entire night. It’s possible that–”

“Can I go in and take a look at him?” Monica asked.

The attending physician seemed to hesitate for a moment before he nodded.

With that, Monica changed into a sterile hospital gown. With the help of the doctor inside, she limped and sat in front of Finn.

By then, his face had been cleaned, and only then did she realize how pale he looked. Moreover, he had many tubes and bandages on him now.

Monica wanted to get close to him but did not know where to place her hands.

Her throat bobbed. She endured the pain until she felt a pain in her throat, but she did not cry.

Even as her vision went blurry, she did not make a sound.

She reached out and carefully put her hand on his.

Finn’s hands were exceptionally beautiful. When she first saw him, those hands were what attracted her to him.

They were slender, clean, and had distinct joints.

How could such a beautiful pair of hands be so unrecognizable at that moment? How could they look so terrible?

Her tears finally fell on his fingers.

“Finn.” Monica choked. At last, she could not hold it in anymore.

She called him by his name.

She once said, “Finn, your name was given to you to make me fall in love with you at first sight, right?”

Such a nice name.

Whenever she thought of it, it made her heart beat faster, and it made her write those three words in her book countless times.

She endured the great sadness as she faced Finn and said, “I want you to wake up. Can you wake up?”

Finn did not react.

“Wake up and let’s be together again, okay? I don’t mind your relationship with Patsy. I don’t mind that you treat me badly. I don’t mind your bad temper. I don’t mind anything. When you wake up, let’s start over, okay? I’ll break up with Michael right away. From now on, I’ll only love you. In fact...”

In fact…

Monica’s eyes were filled with tears. “In fact, I’ve only ever loved you. I’ve never loved Michael. Never. I just didn’t want to feel so wronged in front of you. I just didn’t want you to hurt me so deeply. That was why I said I liked Michael. That was why I worked so hard to make myself like Michael. That was why I wanted to forget you and be with Michael.”
