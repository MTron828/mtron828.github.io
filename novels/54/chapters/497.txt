Chapter 498: Father and Son “Reunited”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Without hesitating, Jeanne leaned over meekly, and the two of them were very close together.

Jeanne said, “You knew this long ago, didn’t you?”

She could tell today that he was not surprised at all.

In fact, from the many times she had interacted with him, she already knew that Edward had discovered it long ago.

She was the only one still trying to deceive herself.

“Yes.” He nodded.

“Have you done a paternity test?” Jeanne asked.

“There’s no need for that,” Edward said. “I know at first glance whether it’s my son or not.”

‘So you have a special ability, huh?’ Jeanne thought.

He was way too confident about himself.

“Do you believe I would’ve kept this child back then?”

Back then, if she did not have the money, she would have chosen to get an abortion.

“I believe you.” Edward enunciated each word clearly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

......

If he knew the truth behind her keeping George, he would be furious!

“Why didn’t you wait for me back then?” Edward suddenly asked.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Was it not because he did not want to take responsibility for the child? However, even if it was not for that reason, it was not important anymore.

She said, “I didn’t think I could rely on you back then.”

Edward was shocked.

“At that time, I thought you and Eden were in cahoots.”

“In that case, why did you look for me? Didn’t you lose both your wife and your soldiers?”

“I had no choice.” Jeanne smiled. Actually, she did not care about many things in the past anymore. “Because I had no one to rely on, I thought I’d risk everything and take the risk. But after I calmed down, I realized how stupid I was. After all, you and Eden are family. How could you help me and not help him?”

“That was why you left?”

“If I didn’t, was I supposed to wait for you to come back and humiliate me?” Jeanne smiled.

However, she never mentioned that the real reason she left back then was that Old Master Swan looked for her. She originally had a glimmer of hope, even though uncertain, for Edward, but that hope was killed just like that.

Therefore, she did not put up any resistance and accepted Alexander chasing her out of Harken.

“I thought I made it very clear when I asked Nox to stay behind and accompany you,” Edward muttered.

Jeanne smiled and said, “I thought this matter would be over once it was over, but now that you insist on bringing it up, there’s no harm in me saying a few more words.”

“Jeannie, please speak.” A certain someone even looked like he was waiting for her respectfully.

“Back then, when we slept together, you should know it was my first time, right?”

“I know.” Edward nodded.

The moment he nodded, a smug smile hung on the corner of his mouth.

He reckoned it would be hard for him to forget it in this lifetime. The second he had her body, he had never felt so satisfied before.

Hence, he thought…

For many years, day and night, he would occasionally think about it and lose control.

“The first time is actually important to a woman,” Jeanne said.

Edward replied, “I know.”

He knew because it was also important to a man.

“For a woman to give her first time away, it means that she has given up everything for that something. However, when that woman opened her eyes and found that the man beside her had disappeared, do you know what it meant to her?” Jeanne asked.

Edward’s heart clenched.

“It meant that the man didn’t want to be responsible,” Jeanne replied.

Edward was rendered speechless and tried to explain himself, “I told Nox to stay.”

“Isn’t the best way to send someone away to make someone else do the job for you?” Jeanne said bluntly.

It was hard for him to clear his name now, so he remained silent.

On the contrary, Jeanne smiled brightly. “It’s alright. It’s all in the past anyway, and things are pretty good now.”

“I had to leave back then because of some things. Even if I didn’t spend that night with you, I would still leave. I had to,” Edward explained.

In fact, Jeanne... did not think it was important anymore, but at that moment, she did not stop him.

She looked at him as he said, “There are many things I can’t tell you now, but I really had to leave. In the past, I would bring Nox along with me, but I kept Nox behind to let you understand that you were important to me. I thought everyone knew my relationship with Nox and that he represented me.”

“When we’re in bed, can he represent you?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Edward choked.

“I thought that with your character, you wouldn’t make any decisions without waiting for me to come back, no matter what. Even if you questioned me face to face, you would ask everything you need to.”
