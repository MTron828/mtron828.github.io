Chapter 350: George’s Parent-Child Sports Day

The next day, Jeanne was a little sleepy because she only fell asleep very, very late last night.

She was still struggling to get up, debating whether she should get up to go to work, when she heard a voice in her ear, telling her, “It’s still early. You can sleep a little longer.”

As if she was possessed, she really did lay in that certain someone’s arms and fell asleep again.

Getting used to something was a very scary thing.

She was clearly uncomfortable sleeping on the same bed as him last night, but today, it seemed as if it was a matter of course.

Then, she turned over and had a feeling that something was wrong. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The next second, she opened her eyes and was instantly startled awake.

“Not sleepy anymore?” A voice whispered in her ear.

Jeanne’s entire body stiffened.

Rather than feeling she was in danger, she was shocked by the scene before her eyes.

Why was she in mid-air at that moment? How did she wake up in a place filled with enchanting clouds?

What in the world…

“We’re on the way to our honeymoon destination,” Edward told her straight.

......

Jeanne scanned her surroundings and looked at the man in the cockpit who was controlling the helicopter.

“Why am I here?” Jeanne asked.

Logically speaking, she could not have been in such deep sleep that she did not even know she had been kidnapped.

Even if they left home halfway through, she was, after all, a professional killer.

It was impossible for her not to have that level of sensitivity.

“I carried you here,” Edward, who was in the cockpit, said bluntly.

“Didn’t I wake up?” Jeanne gritted her teeth.

If Kingsley knew that that happened, she would probably be beaten to death.

“You did wake up. However, you fell asleep peacefully again because you were in my arms.” Edward said smugly, “Jeannie, you seem to like my embrace very much.”

‘Like, my *ss!’

However, on second thought, perhaps she was indeed too tired because she slept pretty late last night. In that case, it should still be early now.

She lowered her head and took a look at her phone. As expected, it was only past 6 a.m. in the morning.

That guy... What was wrong with him? What did he say just now?

Yes, honeymoon.

When did he say that they were going on a honeymoon?

She looked at Edward. “Where are we going?”

“Balti Island,” Edward said.

“Going abroad?”

“Yes,” a certain person replied.

“How long will we be gone?”

“A week.”

“Didn’t I say I have a lot of work to attend to?” Jeanne was furious.

“The honeymoon is more important.”

“Is work not important?” Jeanne burst out in rage.

The next time he did anything, could he let her know in advance?

“The honeymoon is the most important.”

In that case, why did he ask her about her arrangements yesterday?

She realized that sometimes, she could never say good things about Edward.

She gritted her teeth and said, “Where’s George?”

“He’s at home,” Edward said as if it was a matter of course.

Great. Now Jeanne was so angry that she was about to explode.

She had just promised George that she would not abandon him yesterday, and what was she doing now? She had gone back on her words first thing in the morning.

At that moment, she really felt like strangling Edward to death!

“Don’t worry. Teddy will take good care of him.” Edward did not turn her head to look at her, but he explained as if he could feel her emotions.

Jeanne was very angry.

It was true. She was infuriated by Edward’s series of actions.

She said fiercely, “Can we turn around?”

“No.”

“Fourth Master Swan.”

“Call Me Edward.”

“Fourth Master Swan!” Jeanne said stubbornly.

“You can call me whatever you like.” A certain person suddenly compromised.

Suddenly, she did not know what to say. In fact, she was so angry that she could not say anything.

Hence, she turned her head angrily and looked out the window, ignoring the man.

Edward could also feel her emotions, and the corner of his mouth curled into a smile.

In the end, he drove the helicopter directly to the International Airport and landed it at the airport’s designated parking.

By then, there were already people waiting for them and quite a number of them at that.

Edward got off the helicopter first, walked over, and stretched his hand out to help Jeanne to get down.

However, Jeanne got off the helicopter and avoided his hand.

Edward smiled.

Even in the face of her temper, his face was full of affection.

His long legs caught up with her, and he wrapped his arms around her shoulders domineeringly.

Jeanne was stunned for a moment before she resisted him.

“Show me some respect,” Edward suddenly whispered.

Jeanne frowned.

“Many people are watching, and in any case, I am the legendary Fourth Master Swan of Harken,” Edward explained.

Jeanne sneered.

How dare he have the nerve to say he was the legendary Fourth Master Swan?

“Isn’t Fourth Master Swan cold and aloof?”

How shameless was he?

“...Well, I’m not anymore because of you, no?”
