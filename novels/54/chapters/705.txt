Then, he saw Jeanne’s news.

What had Jeanne been doing in South Hampton City for her to be in a small piece of news for two days and one big piece for five days?

Was Jeanne trying to turn the world upside down?

He clicked open the contents of the news and said to the man smoking beside him, “Edward, your wife is on the headlines again.”

Edward’s eyes paused.

“This time, it’s because she confessed to you in front of the reporters, saying that you’re the best,” Nox said.

It sounded a little sour when he said it out loud.

The two of them were so far apart, yet they could still show off their affection.

Edward’s hand that was holding the cigarette paused, and the smile on the corner of his mouth could not be more obvious.

Nox glanced at Edward and dampened the latter’s enthusiasm. “Don’t forget Jeanne’s identity.”

“It won’t stop us from loving each other.”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk.” Nox snorted.

When the day came when Edward and Jeanne had to point their guns at each other’s heads, he would like to see if Edward could still say such cheesy words.

Then, his eyes moved as the phone suddenly rang.

He took a glance at the incoming call and answered it with a serious expression. “Are you ready?”

“We’ll cross the border at midnight tonight and make the deal face-to-face at 1 a.m.”

“Okay. See you at 1 a.m.”

Nox hung up the phone. “The other party said 1 p.m. tonight.”

“Okay,” Edward replied.

“Are you sure you don’t want to deal with those people who are following us?”

“All they want is a result, so we’ll let them see the result of our deal.” Edward’s eyes were cold.

“No one can be more cunning than you.”

Edward put out his cigarette and instructed, “Get everyone ready for tonight.”

“Okay.”

Nox responded and left the room while Edward stood on the balcony and looked into the distance.

He had been away for more than half a month now, and it was time to go back.

…

On the Delta Islands, in a room in a luxurious and modern manor, sounds of panting filled the room.

Lucy pushed the door open, but the people behind Lucy dodged. That was because on the big bed in the room, two people were... having sex.

Kingsley seemed to be doing it a little too frequently recently.

Was it because Millie’s new body gave him a different experience?

Anyway, Millie often came and went in this room, regardless of day or night.

As Lucy walked to the side of their big bed, Millie was a little scared, so she hid behind Kingsley’s body.

However, Kingsley seemed used to it. He said, “What’s the matter?”

“I received news that Fourth Master Swan will make a deal with the other party tonight at local time 1 a.m. tomorrow,” Lucy reported.

“Send a few assassins over,” Kingsley instructed. “And keep an eye on Fourth Master Swan.”

“Yes,” Lucy said respectfully. Then, she glanced at the shy Millie under Kingsley’s body and said bluntly, “Millie should go on a mission.”

Millie looked unwilling and hugged Kingsley’s body as if she was reluctant to part with him.

Of course, Millie would not dare to resist.

She was very clear about her identity, and being able to lie under Kingsley now was because Kingsley was infatuated with her body. It did not mean that Kingsley would develop feelings for her.

She was just using her actions to make Kingsley attached to her.

After all, she would rather lie under Kingsley than go out on a mission. At the very least, there would be no danger.

Kingsley seemed a little impatient under Millie’s seduction.

He said, “Send someone else.”

“Okay.” Lucy did not say anything else.

She had always obeyed Kingsley’s orders, so she turned around and left.

Millie had a victorious smile on her face.

She stood out from the Hills’s rookie training, and when she first entered the manor, she heard that the head of the Hills had a confidante named Lucy. Only she had been by Kingsley’s side the longest, and only she could get close to Kingsley. Therefore, her status was above everyone else!

The assassins really oversold Lucy, so Millie was also curious about how outstanding a woman could be to obtain such great power when she was just an ordinary assassin. Now that she had interacted with Lucy, she realized that was all there was to Lucy.

Kingsley did not treat Lucy particularly well or badly. It was clear that the rumors before were all falsely deifying Lucy.

It made her feel that after some time, she might be able to replace Lucy’s position.

Hence, she worked even harder to please Kingsley. Fortunately, during her training, she focused on seducing Kingsley. That was how she made it hard for Kingsley to forget her.
