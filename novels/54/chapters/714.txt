“Don’t lie to me!”

Jeanne took out the document in her hand. It was something that she had taken out when she left the meeting room, and she knew very well it would be useful.

She said, “This is our plan. Although it’s still the first draft, there aren’t many changes to it. You can take a look!”

Greg seemed skeptical.

Jeanne said, “I’ll come over to give it to you.”

“Don’t come over!” Greg stopped her.

Jeanne stopped in her steps.

“You must be lying to me!” Greg said, “The business of the physical stores can no longer bring much profit to Lawrence Enterprise. You’re a businesswoman and a capitalist. Why would you support our physical stores?”

“The profit you bring to us is indeed not enough for Lawrence Enterprise to support you, but you can bring more commercial value to us. For example, word of mouth. Right now, we want the physical stores to be service-orientated. As for the specific plan, you can take a look at this document in my hand.” Jeanne tried to persuade him.

Greg still did not seem to believe her.

“I’ll come over.” Jeanne said, “I’ll come over alone. Even if you want to jump down, I, a woman, won’t be able to hold onto you.”

Greg seemed a little convinced.

He glared fiercely at Jeanne, but after a long while, he gave in. “You’ll come over alone.”

Jeanne nodded and walked slowly toward Greg, who looked at her warily.

Then, she handed the document in her hand to Greg. Just as Greg was about to take it, he suddenly became very agitated and said, “You lied to me!”

The moment Jeanne was surprised, she saw Eden approaching from the corner of her eyes.

She gritted her teeth.

Greg must have thought that she was deliberately distracting him so that others would come over.

Eden also had his reasons for doing that. He just wanted to pull Greg down when Greg was distracted.

If Greg jumped down in the end, no one could blame him.

Then, once Greg jumped down from the 38th floor, Greg would definitely be dead. If Greg died, Lawrence Enterprise and its person in charge would bear the blame. Eden would use that opportunity to get Joshua to encourage the shareholders to put the blame on Jeanne and have her resign to set things right. That way, Lawrence Enterprise would suffer the least harm.

Eden’s plan was well thought out.

However, she could not care less at that moment. With that, she stepped forward and grabbed onto Greg, who might jump off the ledge the next second. Her actions infuriated Greg so much that the moment Jeanne grabbed onto him, Greg immediately jumped.

“Ah!” Everyone at the scene cried out in fear.

Some of the cowardly employees immediately covered their faces.

They were so frightened that they did not dare to look.

On the rooftop, Jeanne held onto Greg tightly. When Greg jumped down, she reacted quickly by grabbing her other hand onto the guardrail, leaving Greg hanging from the rooftop.

The originally agitated Greg became so scared that his face turned blue.

He looked down and said in shock, “Pull me up. I don’t want to die.”

If he did not want to die, why did he jump?

Jeanne gritted her teeth and used all her strength to pull Greg up. Just then, Eden suddenly leaned over. It looked like he was helping Jeanne pull Greg up, but in fact, he was not. He was using that chance to push Jeanne away.

Jeanne’s expression darkened.

“Eden!”

Eden sneered.

How could he allow Jeanne to pull Greg up?

As such, he forcefully pried open Jeanne’s finger. Once he pried it open, Greg would fall straight down.

Jeanne did not dare to let go at that moment, so she tightened her grip on Greg and shouted, “Quick! Come over and help!”

The other people who were still in a daze immediately rushed over.

Eden’s expression turned cold.

He knew that once the people around him leaned over, he would not be able to make Jeanne let go of Greg.

He bit down hard and used all his strength. He did not expect Jeanne to be so strong.

At that moment, Jeanne could feel her knuckles dislocated by Eden, hence losing the strength in her fingers. With that, her grip on Greg loosened, and the moment Greg was about to fall, Jeanne grabbed onto Greg with her hand that was holding onto the guardrail. At that moment, Greg’s weight and gravity pulled her body down from the rooftop.
