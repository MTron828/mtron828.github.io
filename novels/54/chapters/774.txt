Chapter 775: Jenifer Exposed, Utterly Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jasmine!” Jenifer screamed.

Jasmine refused to listen to her anymore.

It turned out it was so satisfying to tell everyone everything.

She thought that she would have to live under her mother’s oppression for the rest of her life. However, little did she expect that one day, she would be able to resist and expose her mother.

She continued, “When my grandfather and father passed away, my mother began to worry that Jeanne would take over Lawrence Enterprise, so she teamed up with Eden to try and take it away from Jeanne, so she teamed up with Eden to take the company away from Jeanne. Eden actually hated Jeanne as well. Back then, Jeanne almost destroyed the image of a good man that Eden had built for him over the years because she wanted to seek justice for herself, so he cruelly abandoned Jeanne, thinking that it would serve as a lesson for her. However, he didn’t expect Jeanne to return seven years later and make him suffer all over again. Not only that, but she even became his Fourth Uncle’s wife. He had always been indignant and wanted Jeanne to submit to him. Unfortunately, Jeanne is out of his league now. Hence, Eden could only use all kinds of methods to frame her, and one of his methods was to work with my mother to get rid of her. Unfortunately, he wasn’t as good as her and was kicked out of Lawrence Enterprise not long after he joined.”

Eden clenched his fists as he watched the live stream video.

He really wanted to kill that b*tch. He regretted letting b*tch live! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Jasmine, are you saying that Eden and Jenifer have been plotting against Jeanne, trying to take away the Lawrence Enterprise’s management rights from her? ”

“That’s right. My mother is just that crazy. No matter what her own daughter is going through or how Eden treats her, as long as it benefits her, she’ll pretend she doesn’t know anything and work with Eden wholeheartedly.” Jasmine sneered, “Today, by coming here to condemn Jeanne, my mother must be trying to frame Jeanne again. Don’t ask me how I know, but my mother raised me since I was young. I know everything she did.”

“Jenifer is accusing Jeanne of instigating Joshua to rape Ms. Sanders.” A reporter quickly spoke up and told Jasmine what Jenifer wanted to do today.

Jasmine’s cold smile became even more obvious.

She said, “I knew it. My mother must be trying to frame Jeanne again.”

“So you think Jeanne didn’t do it?”

“My mother, Joshua, and Jeanne do not get along well. Do you think Jeanne would be able to convince Joshua to do such a thing? At most, Joshua would be found out, and my mother would want to find a scapegoat. It could even be said that Eden was the instigator of this matter. Although Joshua is ambitious, he doesn’t have the guts to harass Ms. Sanders unless Eden ordered him to do so. Joshua is very obedient to Eden.”

“So you’re saying that Eden, Jenifer, and Joshua were the ones behind this?”

“Yes.” Jasmine nodded with certainty.

“But you have no proof,” the reporter said bluntly.

“I didn’t participate in this matter, so I don’t have any evidence. I just concluded this after having gone through so many things with them. Whether you believe it or not, that’s up to you to decide.”

“Did you say Eden abused you?” a reporter suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jasmine nodded.

At that point, there was no turning back.

In fact, she did not expect Jeanne to help her in the end.

Perhaps Eden would kill her when she returned, but at least, before she died, she told the whole truth.

After being tortured by Eden for so many days and nights, she had long given up on him.

It was good to be able to take revenge on him now. Then, she could rest in peace when she was dead.

“Do you have any proof?” the reporter asked.

Jasmine looked at all the reporters before slowly lifting her shirt up.

Under her shirt, there were horrible scars, whip marks, bruises, and all kinds of other things. It was a tragic sight.

Everyone present was stunned.

They did not expect to see all that under Jasmine’s shirt.

The reporter quickly said, “Jasmine, you can sue him for domestic violence.”

“I’ve been locked up at home. How can I sue him?” Jasmine mocked.

She had thought about it too. However, she knew very well that she could not succeed.

Even if she called the police, with Eden’s current ability, it would be a waste of time for her to report it. Instead, she would suffer an even more severe beating.
