1066 Finn, I Killed Someone

“Leader!” Michael was obviously shocked.

All his power was given to him by the Sanders. If he lost it, he would have nothing.

No.

He, Michael, was destined to be better than others since he was born, so he could not accept his defeat. In fact, he had never been able to accept that he was worse than anyone since he was young.

He had to stand above the crowd and look down on everyone.

He could not let his glorious life end here.

“I’ll hand the matters of Sunny Pharmaceutical over to my son to manage personally. Tomorrow morning, Chester will come, and you’ll hand over everything you have on hand to him. After that, scram as far away from me as you can!”

“Leader!” Michael tried to say something.

However, Warren had already hung up, not giving Michael any face.

Michael’s emotions, which had finally calmed down, exploded again in the next second! Fuming, he kicked over the desk in front of him.

There was a loud noise in the office, but the people outside did not dare to go in for fear of getting caught in the crossfire.

Michael dialed a string of numbers fiercely.

The person on the other end answered respectfully, “Mr. Ross.”

“Kill Monica.” Michael enunciated each word.

“Does she need to die?” the other party asked.

Mr. Ross had given the order last time as well, but he had reminded him that it would depend on Monica’s luck.

What that sentence meant was to not go overboard and just teach her a little lesson.

Therefore, he needed to confirm it again.

“Kill her!” Michael gave the other party an extremely certain answer.

“Received.” The other party hurriedly agreed.

Michael put down his phone.

He still had some feelings for Monica, but as he had said, in the face of interests and future prospects, feelings were worthless to him.

Therefore, Monica had brought this upon herself.

…

Monica did a stretch.

Every time she felt exhausted, it would be past 10 p.m. at night.

She sat on the office chair and rested for a while. After making sure that she had finished all her work for the day, she took her bag and left work.

Steve would basically work overtime with her, and it was the same tonight.

Seeing that Monica was getting off work, he hurriedly went up to her. “Are you leaving now, Chairman?”

“Yes,” Monica responded. “Mr. Warren, you should get off work earlier too.”

“Alright.” Steve nodded.

Monica walked into the elevator.

It still warmed her heart that the people around her were so sincere with her.

She walked down to the Cardellini Enterprise’s underground parking lot.

At that moment, the underground parking lot was quiet. If it were the old Monica, she would have been scared to death in such a dark and eerie place, but now, she seemed used to it.

She walked toward her car and had only taken a few steps when her eyes paused.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a man standing behind a pillar not far behind her. Even though he had hidden himself for a moment, she still saw him.

However, she pretended to be calm.

She still walked over to her car calmly and made a phone call. As the phone rang in her ear, her heart could not help but race.

She kept praying for Nox to pick up the phone because she could feel someone approaching her.

The moment she opened the car door, she sensed danger!

Just then, the call finally connected. “Monica–”

“Save me... Ah!”

Monica was knocked unconscious by the man in front of her.

Nox looked at his phone nervously. “Monica, Monica!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, there was no response from the other end of the phone.

At that moment, Nox was still partying at the nightclub.

A group of women was dancing around him, and he was in high spirits. However, because of Monica’s phone call, he lost all interest in sex. He suddenly pushed away all the women in front of him and rushed out madly.

“Young Master Winter...”

The women were having fun, and they did not know what had happened to make Young Master Winter react that way and leave immediately.

Nox quickly got into his car.

He could not care less about the fact he was drunk and stepped on the accelerator.

While driving, he called Finn. “Finn, something happened to Monica.”

Finn had just returned home.

...

“What?” Finn’s face sank immediately.

“When Monica called me just now, she only said ‘save me’. After that, there was no response. I suspect that Michael has made a move on Monica,” Nox said quickly and anxiously.

Finn had also thought of the same thing at that moment.
