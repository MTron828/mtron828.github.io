She thought Finn loved her very much.

That time when they were in an accident, and he protected her, Finn loved her as if his life depended on it.

However, how could he suddenly become so cold? He was so cold to her that it frightened her.

She just watched as Finn twisted the handrail and opened the door. Just as he was about to leave, Monica suddenly hugged him tightly from behind.

He may not want to make any sacrifices for their relationship, but she could.

From the moment she pursued Finn, she had always been the humble one in their relationship.

That was why she could humble herself and make him stay.

“Don’t go.” Monica hugged him tightly.

Finn was taken aback, and as he felt Monica’s body trembling behind him, his throat bobbed.

Even if his heart died, he was not so indifferent to her. After all, he had loved her deeply; he had loved her very much, so much that he was willing to give up his life for her.

His body stiffened when he felt the person behind him hugging his back and crying.

Perhaps he should give Monica a chance.

Everything Monica did was out of instinctive kindness, and maybe he should not take that kindness for granted.

His heart began to waver as he wondered if he should really trust Monica for once and even help her.

In the meantime, his silence gave Monica a glimmer of hope.

She was even prepared for Finn to push her away, but she did not expect him to remain motionless.

Did that mean Finn still had feelings for her?

Hence, she slowly let go of her hand that was holding his waist.

Even then, Finn did not leave.

Monica’s heart was racing. She had a feeling that Finn was different tonight.

She gently tugged at the corner of his shirt, wanting him to turn around, and at that moment, Finn really did turn around.

He turned around and looked at her, who was afraid and nervous.

Had his heart softened?

After making up his mind to break up with Monica, did seeing her pitiful appearance make his heart soften?

“Hubby,” Monica called out to him carefully.

Similarly, Finn’s heart was racing, but he tried to hide it by making himself look calm.

However, his Adam’s apple bobbed uncontrollably, betraying his nervousness.

“Hubby,” Monica called out to him again.

Since he did not respond, she did not dare to look at him.

Just like that, the two of them stood face to face.

They were very close, so close that Finn could smell the faint scent of perfume on Monica’s body.

“I want...” Monica said.

She did not say what she wanted to say.

In fact, in such an atmosphere, every adult would know what was on her mind.

He knew but did not reject her.

Monica’s hands trembled as she slowly undid her trench coat. It was very easy to unbutton as it only consisted of a few buttons and a belt.

Under the trench coat was a red silk dress. Under the light, it accentuated her fair skin and even seemed to give her a beautiful halo.

After taking off her trench coat, Monica finally mustered her courage and looked up at Finn.

There was a trace of emotion in Finn’s eyes when she looked at him, but it seemed to be an illusion.

Still, she reached out and hugged Finn’s neck.

He did not push her away, and with that, Monica became bolder.

She stood on her tiptoes and kissed his lips with her rosy lips.

When they were 0.01 meters away from each other, Finn said, “Leave Michael.”

Monica was stunned.

“If you want to sleep with me now, leave him! From now on, you’re not allowed to interfere in his affairs,” Finn said slowly.

“I can’t now–”

“So, what identity are you using to sleep with me now?” Finn asked.

“I...” Monica began to feel nervous again because she suddenly felt Finn’s coldness.

The lust just now seemed like an illusion, and his body was full of thorns.

“A prostitute?” Finn looked at her.

That word stabbed right into Monica’s heart, and her eyes reddened. “Finn, do you have to make me sound so bad?”

Finn pushed Monica away.

As a result, Monica lost her balance and fell to the ground.

Fortunately, the floor was carpeted, so it did not hurt too much. However, her entire body was still in excruciating pain.

Even her heart was in excruciating pain.

The moment Finn turned around and left, Monica called out to him, “Finn, can’t you feel my sincerity? I used my body in exchange for your trust. Why do you have to treat me like this?”

Finn stopped in his place for a moment.

Then, he turned around and looked at Monica, who was squatting on the ground. “So, you would rather betray your looks than leave Michael?”

“I don’t think helping Michael is wrong! I can’t just stand by and watch Michael lose everything because of me!”

“What if I tell you that Michael doesn’t need your help?” Finn said coldly.

“Michael won’t lie to me!” Monica was certain.

Finn sneered, laughing at himself.

That second of weakness he had just now, did he make a fool of himself?

He even thought that as long as Monica left Michael now, he would forget everything that happened.

Forget it.

He sneered and said, “Monica, what right do you have to say that you love me?”

What right did she have to say that she loved him when she trusted another man so much?
