1272 Edward’s Rise and Alex’s Defeat

Alex’s throat moved slightly.

He clenched his fist and continued to be silent.

“When I first met you, you said that I am your brother.” Edward seemed to have paused for a moment.

Alex also seemed to recall that image from once upon a time.

That time, Edward was four years old while he was seven.

It was so long ago and Edward still remembered.

“You said, in this world, I am your only family. You will only trust me alone.” Edward said silently.

Sometimes it felt like he was telling someone else’s story.

“So for a long time, I remember only that one sentence—that one sentence, you said you only trust me alone.” Edward’s voice was calm when he said, “In order to live up to your trust in me, I worked hard to do everything for you, to help you clear all the obstacles that stand in the way of your great work, to help you do all the cruel and bloody things, to help you step by step, to create history.”

Alex’s fist seemed to clench more and more tightly.

“Later, I found out that I was in love.” Edward said, “I found out that in this world, apart from revenge and more revenge, there can be happier things, such as watching a little girl, growing up innocently and romantically in front of me. The first time I saw Jeanne was when I was twelve years old. The first time I saw her, I found my heart fluttering. Perhaps the heartbeat you have never felt in your life—uncontrollably, disordered. But at that time I knew very well that I could not afford the time to like a girl, in addition to the great business of the chief’s family, so I gave this opportunity to Eden, I hope Eden can replace me to take good care of her, and I was still fight life and death for you.”

Inside the quiet courtyard, only Edward’s faint voice was heard.

“But Eden let me down. I used to try to give him all I had, including all of the Swan family. I tried to let him take over all my achievements. When one day you’re at the top, I will still be by your side. Then I will leave all of the Swans’ to Eden. Even in the midst of being so busy growing up, I still took the time to help Eden get even better. I thought Jeanne needed a good boy to be with her. Unfortunately, the time I was able to spend on Eden was ultimately limited, and I didn’t know at what point Eden went off course and strayed further and further away from what I expected of him.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Eden betrayed Jeanne, and Jeanne came to me for help.” Edward’s throat moved slightly.

He recalled again, probably when he was eighteen years old, a girl was squatting in front of his house, shivering.

That was probably it.

If back then he and Jeanne did not miss each other, then they would not have continued missing each other later on.

“I had the idea to start over with Jeanne, but after she finally left South Hampton, I was finally caught between you and her. I chose you and gave up finding Jeanne. I gave up on being someone Jeanne could rely on.” Edward’s eyes seemed to redden.

If he had been more resolute, if he had been able to go abroad and get her back, Jeanne would not have suffered so much.

Jeanne would not have so much.

In this relationship, he gave up right from the start.

Time and again, he had given up.

Alex’s tightly clenched fist was slowly relaxing.

“Later on, Jeanne came back. With a purpose, she returned. Took me and her son and came back to South Hampton. I thought it must be fate after so many times and going in circles for many years and she still wanted to be by my side. I even thought that you would allow me to have a normal family.” Edward said, “If, indeed, we value each other as much as I do.”

“I said I would allow it if Jeanne was not a member of the Sanders family.” Alex was silent for a long time before he finally spoke.

Edward smiled a little.

He said, “If you really understood me, if you really had seriously understood me, not to mention that Jeanne was Joseph’s daughter, even if Jeanne was the daughter of Warren Sanders, you would have let her go. You don’t even know, or even understand, how much I would love Jeanne! Or maybe, in your opinion, I am supposed to be used by you from childhood. I am supposed to accept all your arrangements, I am supposed to do whatever you say, my resistance would be the worst crime!”

“Edward, the whole world is ours! The whole of Harken is ours, so why do you have to stick to that woman? Why don’t you stay with me and stand next to me in the world! You’ve lost your will to fight because of a woman, you’ve lost all your ambitions for a woman, don’t you feel sorry? I killed Jeanne just to help you, let you return to your original self, let you understand what a man is and should have everything!” Alex was a little excited.
