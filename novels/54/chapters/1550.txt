Monica looked at their clasped hands and watched as Finn reluctantly let go of her hand. Then, as she turned around and walked into the neighborhood, she could feel Finn’s gaze on her from behind. He did not leave at all.

Monica thought, perhaps Jeanne was right. Finn had changed a lot for her, and what she wanted was for Finn to change!

She stepped into the elevator, went home, and lay on the bed. She could not help but touch her lower abdomen and think, ‘Do the two little guys inside want a daddy?’

Just then, the phone rang. Monica glanced at the caller ID and picked it up.

“Brandon.”

“You haven’t forgotten about going to Casterbridge tomorrow to discuss the export of medicine, right?”

She had indeed forgotten.

“Can you go in your current condition?” Brandon was a little worried.

“My condition is stable now, so I should be fine.”

“Last time, you had really bad morning sickness.”

“It was an exception.”

“Do you want to get a doctor to accompany you?” Brandon suggested.

“No need.” Monica refused.

“Alright. The flight tomorrow is at night, and considering the time difference, we’ll be arriving at night too. We’ll rest for one night and meet with the other party’s general manager on the third day to discuss the cooperation.”

“Sure, pick me up at my neighborhood tomorrow night.”

“Alright.”

After hanging up the phone, Monica thought about it for a while and gave

Jeanne a call. “Are you home?” “It’s been a while.” Jeanne replied, “Why? Can’t bear to part with me?”

“You’re too narcissistic.”

The other party smiled nonchalantly. “In that case, why are you looking for

“I’m going to Casterbridge tomorrow, so I’m informing you that I’ll be gone for a week. Don’t miss me too much.”

“It seems like you’re the one who’ll be missing me!” Jeanne exposed her mercilessly.

“Although you know that, you don’t have to expose me. You’re still my friend,” Monica retorted.

“Okay, be careful there, especially since you’re pregnant,” Jeanne reminded.

“I know how to take care of myself.”

“Good night.’

“Good night.”

Jeanne hung up the phone and could not help but smile.

Edward had just come out of the bathroom after taking a shower. Seeing her smile, he asked, “What made you so happy?

“I just suddenly think that there’s a chance for Monica and Finn to get back together.”

“Huh?” Edward frowned.

“Let me make a call,” Jeanne said.

Then, she got up from the bed and walked to the balcony.

Edward stared at her back. He had thought that Jeanne would leave him after everything was exposed and had never dared to imagine that he could still have such happiness now.

On the balcony, Jeanne gave Finn a call. “You sent Monica back together. Have you guys made any progress?”

“Yes, Monica said to give her some time to think about whether she wants to accept me.” Finn said bluntly, “Jeannie, thank you so much.”

Jeanne smiled. “There’s no need for that. You’ve changed a lot too, and Monica can see that. I’m calling to tell you that Monica is going to Casterbridge tomorrow night.”

“She’s pregnant, yet she’s still going?”

“That’s why she needs a doctor to go with her.”

Finn immediately understood what she meant and quickly thanked her. “Thank you.”

“Actually, you don’t have to thank me. It was Monica’s idea,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Finn did not quite believe it.

“Monica clearly knows that I’m trying to matchmake you two, yet she took the initiative to call me and tell me she’s to go to Casterbridge. Isn’t her motive obvious?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Monica, who had worked hard in the business world for so many years, was no longer as pure and innocent as she used to be.

“Thank you for telling me.” Finn tried to control the excitement in his heart.

Jeanne could feel Finn’s excitement even through the phone. She said, “Seize the opportunity. I’m hanging up.”

“Good night.”

“Good night.”

Jeanne put down the phone, and as soon as she put it down, her body was suddenly hugged from behind. She was stunned. A particular someone’s head was already leaning against her neck and was being intimate with her.

“Edward, we can’t do this so often.” Jeanne was getting nervous. She Imew what Edward wanted to do the moment he got close.

“I’m still young.”

“You’re almost 40 years old!” Jeanne said mercilessly.

A certain someone immediately became furious. “I’m only 33 years old.”

He was still far from being 40. Besides…

“Even if I’m 40, I can still…” Edward bit Jeanne’s ear.

It was all kinds of…

“Edward.” Jeanne could not take it anymore.. “If you do that again, we’ll sleep in separate rooms!”
