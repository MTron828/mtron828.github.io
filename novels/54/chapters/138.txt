Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After the Sanders administrative office made an official statement.

The impact of the news was obviously much weaker. The amount of attention started to decrease, and the popularity of the news slowly declined.

Jeanne watched coldly as the news gradually became less popular.

About an hour later.

Jeanne had Forrest record a video for her.

Then, she sent it out.

In the video, Jeanne was smiling, “To the Administrative Office, thank you for your attention and support to the Lawrence Enterprise. We fully trust the Sanders and the administrative office to help the Lawrence Enterprise tide over this crisis. We will also actively work hard to find a better solution to minimize the losses of both the administrative office and the Lawrence Enterprise. Finally, I fully support the Sanders’ plan for the amusement park project from the perspective of the national economy.”

A few short sentences.

It ignited the news that had been cooling down.

There were many comments below.

“The Lawrence Enterprise is so understanding.”

“They quit while they can. The Lawrence Enterprise is quite smart.”

“I hope to see the administrative office help the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Am I the only one who likes Jeanne? What’s surprising is that I’m a woman myself.”

There were a lot of comments below this comment. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“No, you’re not the only one.”

“I’ve been looking at her face the entire time. What’s surprising is that my gender is the same as yours.”

…

Just like that, the tension in the news eased up.

From the initial political and business conflicts, it seemed to have turned into entertainment gossip at this moment.

#Jeanne’s looks are too shocking# had even become a hot comment on this news.

Monica sat in the waiting room of the hospital, flipping through today’s trending news.

When she saw the video that Jeanne had just posted, she was a little angry.

She could not help but swear.

Jeanne compromised just like that?

Those lackeys of the Sanders had casually said a few nice words, and Jeanne believed them?

When she saw Jeanne’s first video of her retaliating head-on today, her blood was boiling. She was certain that Jeanne would definitely make a difference in this matter, and she would definitely amaze the world. It would be best if that b*stard Eden was regretful that he had lost a treasure and married a b*tch.

However, she never expected Jeanne to suddenly express her goodwill.

This was too big of a reversal!

Although the Sanders were in power, and it was common sense to not fight with officials, this was too f**king fast. It was too obvious!

Jeanne, what’s wrong with you?

She had this uneasiness in her chest as if she had just taken a dump and suddenly retracted it. It was simply too unpleasant!

No matter how she thought about it, with Jeanne’s personality, she would definitely choose to fight head-on, and it was impossible for her to give in so easily.

Was it...

Was she being threatened?

At the thought of this, Monica became agitated.

She quickly picked up the phone and dialed.

The call went through. “Monica?”

“Are you under house arrest by your father? Forced? Threatened?” Monica was extremely distressed.

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “I’m fine. I’m at work.”

“Don’t be afraid. If your father really uses violence on you, tell me. I’ll find someone to save you!”

“No.” Jeanne slightly raised her voice.

“Then why did you suddenly compromise?” Monica’s face was full of displeasure.

Jeanne already knew why Monica called.

She knew Monica too well.

Monica could not bear to see her suffer. She even wished that Jeanne could stand at the top and slap everyone in the face.

Sometimes, Jeanne would really be moved by this woman.

After all, in this world, there were not many people who would treat her so unconditionally.

She said, “Monica, do you know what a diversion is?”

“Huh?”

“It means that I have other plans,” Jeanne said with a smile.

“So you didn’t compromise just like that?”

“Of course.”

“I knew it. My Jeannie has a domineering temperament! She won’t just swallow whatever you throw at her.”

Jeanne was amused. “I can’t talk anymore. I’m getting busy.”

“Okay.” Monica took it as reassurance and stopped nagging, “I’m going for a check-up.”

“Check-up? What check-up?” Jeanne was stunned.

“Oh, I’m going for a breast check-up. My chest is always tingling nowadays.”

“Is it serious?”

“It shouldn’t be serious. We’ll know after the check-up.”

“Is Dr. Jones accompanying you?” Jeanne asked.

“How is that possible?” Monica raised her voice. “He’s not that kind. I came alone. I was afraid that my parents would be worried, so I didn’t call them.”

“After the check-up, no matter what happens, just send me a message.”

“Okay,” Monica said nonchalantly. “Go do your thing. I’m hanging up.”
