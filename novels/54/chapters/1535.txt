Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Before he could finish his sentence, he saw Monica walking over from the room.

Finn was stunned for a second. However, he quickly went over and asked, “Are you hungry?”

“I’m leaving,” Monica said, without answering Finn’s question.

“I left you some food. Eat before you leave,” Finn said.

“No, I’ll go back and eat.”

“Monica-I’

“Don’t touch me.” Monica avoided Finn.

Finn’s hand was in mid-air, and he felt a little awkward.

Seeing how determined Monica was, he said, “I’ll send you back.”

‘You don’t have to send me back. I can take a taxi home.” “It’s getting late. It’s not safe to be alone. I’ll drive you.”

“I said there’s no need…” Monica was getting a little impatient.

However, at that moment, Paige climbed down from the sofa and ran to

Monica with her short legs. “Godmother, don’t go.”

Monica felt that she should not have wasted so much time with Finn. If she left before Paige could react, the situation would not have gotten so complicated. “Paige, it’s getting late. Your godmother wants to home.”

“I don’t want Godmother to leave. Boohoo…” Paige burst into tears without warning again.

Looking pitiful and aggrieved, she kept muttering, “My parents don’t want me anymore, and now Godmother doesn’t want me anymore either…”

Monica was on the verge of breaking down. Deep down, she did not like Paige, but for some reason, she could not refuse. Whenever she saw Paige’s pitiful look, her heart would melt.

However, she did not understand something. Was Paige not fine when she was with Finn just now? Why did Paige cry when she saw her?

“Godmother, don’t go. I don’t want you to go. I don’t want to be abandoned…’

Paige said as she cried, looking heartbreakingly sad.

It made Monica think that if she were to leave now, she would really be heartless. The thought of it put Monica in a dilemma. Finn said, “Paige sleeps early at night.”

It meant… she could leave when Paige fell asleep.

Monica did not want to give in, but in the end, she did. She bent down and looked at Paige. “If you cry again, I’ll leave.”

Paige’s pure and innocent eyes, which were filled with tears, looked straight at Monica, stunned.

“Don’t cry. I won’t leave. I’ll accompany you, okay?”

“Alright.” Paige instantly smiled.

Even if the tears were still on her face, she could immediately put on a smile on her face. A child could really get happy over the simplest things.

Monica wiped away Paige’s tears and held her hand as they walked toward the sofa. At that moment, cartoons were playing on the television in the living room.

“Godmother, are you hungry?” Paige suddenly asked.

In reality, it was Finn who was giving her hints. Finn did a simple action, and Paige immediately understood. Having a high IQwas really a great thing.

Monica could not help but touch her stomach. She was indeed hungry.

“Godmother, Godfather’s cooking is delicious.” Paige started to brag. “It’s the best food I’ve ever eaten. It’s even better than Teddy’s cooking. Godmother, can you eat some?”

No, she could not. However, she was really hungry.

“I’ll warm the food up in the pot. Wait for me at the dining table. It’ll be ready soon,” Finn said.

By then, he was already walking to the kitchen.

Monica looked at Finn’s back and felt like she was being led by the nose by those two people.

“Godmother, let’s go to the dining table and wait for Godfather.” As she spoke, she held Monica’s hand and wanted to go with her.

Monica did not refuse and walked to the dining table with Paige.

Monica sat on the dining chair, which was a little high, and Paige obviously wanted to accompany her for dinner. Hence, she just watched as Paige tried to climb onto the chair with her chubby legs.

Seeing that Paige was struggling, Monica wanted to pick Paige up.

However, when Paige felt her godmother holding her, she quickly refused.

“Godmother, you have my little sisters in your stomach. You can’t pick me up.”

Monica was stunned.

“Godfather said so,” Paige explained.

“It’s fine. I can carry you up.”

“Godfather is a doctor. Everything he says is right.”

How afraid was a child of a doctor?

Paige climbed onto the dining chair on her own and sat obediently beside Monica. At that moment, Finn had placed the dishes on the dining table. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Do you like it?”

“I’m not a picky eater now,” Monica said bluntly..
