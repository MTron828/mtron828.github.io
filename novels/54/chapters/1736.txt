Chapter 1737: Nox’s Love For Babies

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

That was how the twins got their names, and Monica really liked them. As soon as she called out the names of the two babies, others would know that they were her and Finn’s children, and it was a wonderful feeling!

Her eyes were a little red as she was touched by how well Finn treated her. She wondered why she thought Finn did not love her anymore or why she wanted to break up with him at one point. If they did break up, she would regret it now, and just thinking about it scared her a little.

“Don’t cry.” Finn looked into Monica’s eyes and said gently.

Monica felt a lump in her throat. She was not a sentimental person, but Finn made her want to cry not because he made her sad. Rather, it was because she was glad she was favored by God. She thought that God had given her everything but not a beautiful love life, but little did she know that God had arranged the best marriage for her.

She stretched out her hand at Finn, obviously asking for a hug. Finn, however, had always been shy and would only say all those corny things to Monica when they were alone. Although the sweet nothings he said earlier were in front of many people, he only whispered in her ear.

Now, Monica’s proactiveness made Finn a little embarrassed. Nevertheless, he still leaned over and hugged Monica tightly in his arms. When one truly loved a person, one would throw away many of their principles.

Jeanne looked at them, and the corners of her mouth curled into a faint smile.

There was a time when she thought Finn was not suitable for Monica because Finn’s reserved personality did not match Monica’s lively personality. Only now did she realize that love could break many barriers, just like her and Edward.

When she first got close to Edward, she had never thought they would end up together. They had different standpoints, and their relationship was destined to end in tragedy. However, after experiencing so much and using all kinds of methods, they eventually got back together.

Jeanne did not know why she felt a little sentimental and whether it was because she was happy that Monica was finally in a good relationship. After all, the last few years had not been easy for Monica and Finn.

Monica lay in Finn’s arms for a long time. After the two little babies woke up and clamored for milk, Monica reluctantly left Finn’s embrace.

Before she left, she did not forget to confess her love to him. “Finn, I will never let go of your hand again. Even if you don’t love me anymore, you can never leave me.”

“Silly girl.” Finn patted Monica’s head. “There won’t be a day when I don’t love you.”

“Oh.” Monica looked at Finn and felt touched again.

How could there be such a good man in this world? How did she meet him? Even now, she found it unbelievable.

Finn smiled gently at Monica before turning around and walking toward the two crying babies. At that moment, Ruby and Gary, who were carrying the two babies, were flustered when they saw the babies cry.

“They must’ve pooped,” Finn explained.

Gary and Ruby quickly placed the baby on the changing table. As expected, when they opened the diapers, they saw that the babies had pooped.

Finn assisted the nanny with cleaning the babies’ butts, changing the diapers, and feeding the babies milk powder. He was so skilled that he did not look like a newbie father at all. Monica just kept staring at Finn in admiration. “Jeannie,” Monica called out to Jeanne, who was accompanying her.

“Hmm?” Jeanne responded.

At that moment, she was looking at her phone. Edward was texting her, asking her about the two babies.

“Tell me, how can Finn be so amazing? He seems to know how to do everything. I think I’ve picked up a treasure.” Monica could not help but sigh.

Jeanne laughed lightly. “So, don’t you think you were stupid back then for not wanting to get back together with Finn even though you were pregnant?”

Monica was speechless. Jeanne had really touched a sore spot. All she wanted to do was show off her man.

“What are you looking at?” Monica looked at Jeanne’s gaze and frowned.

She could not believe that Jeanne was on her phone instead of spending time with her!

“Edward is asking about the two babies.”

“Is he really just asking about the two babies?” Monica did not believe her.

Jeanne’s face was slightly red as she said, “I can’t just allow you and Finn to be lovey-dovey with each other, right?”Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
