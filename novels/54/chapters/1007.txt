1008 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

His tone sounded a little sarcastic, but it also sounded like his usual tone.

Jeanne said bluntly, “She once risked her life for me.”

“I know.” Edward nodded.

The moment he nodded, he looked up at Jeanne and said, “I’m just wondering if there will ever be a day when you’ll do your best for me too.”

“You don’t need to think that way.” Jeanne smiled.

Edward’s throat moved.

“You’re so powerful. You don’t need me to use my full strength to escape unscathed.”

“What if?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne fell silent.

What if… they had to fight? What would she choose?

Edward had already made his intentions clear. In fact, they knew their identities, but they just had not exposed each other yet.

If he did not expose her, they could still be husband and wife. Otherwise, once exposed, they could only be enemies.

She said, “If that happens, I will choose to die for love.”

Edward laughed, and the smile on his face was obvious.

He said, “I’ll remember that.”

It could be considered the first promise they made as individuals who stood on opposing sides.

He promised that if he died, she would die with him.

The two of them ate dinner in silence.

The glass of red wine swirled under the light.

Jeanne drank quite a bit. Her alcohol tolerance was not good, to begin with, but her alcohol tolerance seemed even worse tonight.

After downing one or two glasses, she felt a little dizzy, and her flushed face was very attractive.

“Are you drunk?” Edward asked.

Jeanne’s intoxicated eyes were hazy, and her laid-back appearance exuded a kind of charm that could easily seduce men.

She nodded her head and admitted that she was drunk.

“I’ll send you back to your room.” Edward put down his knife and fork.

“I want a hug,” Jeanne requested.

Edward laughed.

In this world, the only woman who could receive such warmth from Edward was Jeanne.

With that, he bent down and pulled her into his arms.

She lay obediently in his arms.

Edward placed Jeanne on the bed, and because she had her arms around his neck, his body was pressed against hers.

As the tips of their noses touched, it felt like the room had become steaming hot.

“Do you want to stay?” Jeanne was clearly inviting him to stay.

“Are you going to the hospital tomorrow?” Edward suddenly changed the topic.

What did that have to do with him staying tonight?

However, at that moment, she still nodded. “I’m going to the hospital tomorrow to accompany Monica.”

“So, the day after tomorrow.” Edward asked, “Can you spare that day for me?”

Jeanne was surprised.

“I want to have you for a whole day, from morning to night. Is that okay?” He enunciated each word with deep affection.

In this world, which married couple would need to make an appointment to hang out?

Feeling touched, Jeanne said, “Alright.”

Moreover, she had promised George that she would meet him before she left.

“In that case, I’ll wait for you to come home the day after tomorrow,” Edward said.

He then lowered his head and planted a deep kiss on her lips before he stood up and left.

Jeanne lay on the bed, staring at Edward’s back.

Was he afraid that she would run away after they had sex? She was not a sc*mbag!

She rolled over and buried herself in the blanket.

At that moment, the word ‘home’ appeared in his mind. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

She did not know how long it had been since she had a home.

The Delta Islands were not her home, and the Lawrence family’s villa was not her home either. Could it be Bamboo Garden?

Jeanne’s lips curled into a faint smile when she recalled Edward telling her to be home the day after tomorrow.

However, that was good because she could still make some preparations for the day after tomorrow.

After all, he had always been the one taking the initiative, and she wanted to take the initiative for once.

…

Under another night sky, Michael received the news of Brie’s death.

He did not hide the cruelty in his eyes.

He was not cruel. He just had his life and his ambitions to think about, and those who affected his future should die.

He picked up his phone and dialed a number. “Prepare the evidence of Brie’s crime and hand it over to the police tomorrow morning.”

“Yes.”

“Have you worked with Daniel Cook on his testimony?”

“I’ve already talked to him this afternoon. He only has one request.”

“Go on.”

“Reduce his sentence.”

“Tell him not to worry. I’ll definitely get him out within five years!”

“Alright.”

After that, Michael made another call, and the other party was extremely respectful. “Mr. Ross.”

“Announce to the public that all the technical staff of Cardellini Pharmaceutical have left the company and joined Sunny Pharmaceutical. Let everyone know that Cardellini Enterprise no longer has a research and development team.”
