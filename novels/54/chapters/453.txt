Chapter 454: Sweet Shopping

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s been too long. I forgot,” Edward said casually.

What difference was there between saying it and not saying it?

She looked at Edward unhappily. However, Edward deliberately ignored her.

He changed the topic. “Are you going back to Lawrence Enterprise?”

“No, I’m going to buy your father a birthday present.” Jeanne was a little indignant. Even though she had been schemed against by Old Man Swan, she still had to show him respect.

“Didn’t you already give it to him just now?” Edward raised his eyebrows.

“No. I have to let your old man know he owes me a favor.”

“...Smart.” Edward praised her.

Jeanne smiled.

At least, in the future, when they encountered some troubles, perhaps they could give each other a way out.

Jeanne struggled to get out of Edward’s embrace. She had always been swift and decisive. She would do whatever she wanted.

“I’ll be heading off now.”

“I’ll go with you,” Edward said straightforwardly.

......

Jeanne looked at him.

“I’ll go with you.” Edward held her hand. “To go shopping.”

“Don’t you have work to do?”

“I don’t have to.”

“What an incompetent ruler.”

“For you, I’m willing to be one.”

She thought, ‘Don’t tease, or I’d be moved.’

Edward did not seem to notice Jeanne’s emotions as he held Jeanne’s hand and walked out of the office.

As the office door opened, Nox walked in.

Nox looked at the two of them and the way they held hands. He said in a high voice, “I heard I missed a good show today!”

The two of them ignored him at the same time, walking past him.

Nox stared at their backs, thinking, ‘F*ck! How dare you ignore me now that you have a wife?’

He had gone to deal with some other things today. Before he returned to the company, he heard rumors that Eden had been demoted and directly removed from his position as the president of Swanhaven Group. He could imagine how miserable Eden was today, but he could not believe that he had missed out on such an exciting scene!

As for Eden…

To be honest, if it were not for the Swans or Fourth Master Swan grooming him to be his successor, Eden would have been beyond redemption and dead for treating Jeanne like that!

Eden was so stupid to not know what kind of situation he was in!

It would still be alright if he really learned his lesson this time and kept to himself. Otherwise...

Nox could imagine what would happen to Eden in the end!

He walked into Edward’s office and sat on the sofa with his legs crossed.

In the past, he was the one who accompanied Fourth Master Swan.

F*ck.

Nox suddenly felt a little annoyed.

Why did he feel like Fourth Master Swan had abandoned him?

He even felt f*cking lonely!

…

In the Swan family residence’s Purple Pavilion Garden, Eden had come back from leaving the Swan Enterprise’s headquarters in a sorry state.

He had received a notice of punishment from the company.

It had been announced company-wide that they had removed him from his position as the president of Swanhaven Group.

They had removed him but had not given him any other position.

Just like that, they had put him on hold in Swan Enterprise.

His expression was grim.

It was not easy for him to climb his way to that position.

He could not be denied that he had an innate advantage because he was a member of the Swans. However, he had also worked very hard to obtain the approval of the entire family and had taken over Swanhaven Bank with his own hands. Yet now...

However, because of Jeanne, he had nothing left!

Jeanne, that b*tch! He would definitely strangle her to death and make her lose her reputation in front of everyone.

He would make her feel as embarrassed as he was today.

He might even expose the thoughts toward her that he had kept in his heart the entire time. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After all, he had always shown disdain toward Jeanne, but Jeanne’s recording had really humiliated him.

His expression was extremely ugly, and his entire face looked ferocious.

Eden walked into the living room with a cold expression.

“Eldest Young Master,” the servant quickly called out to him respectfully.

However, Edward’s cold expression made the servant dare not speak again. She could only wait by the side in fear and trepidation as Eden asked fiercely, “Where’s Jasmine?”

“The Eldest Young Mistress wasn’t feeling well, so she went to the hospital.”

Eden’s expression worsened.

When he thought of Jasmine’s submissiveness and how Jasmine had been pampered at home, he felt disgusted with Jasmine, so much so that he did not care about Jasmine’s body.

He returned to his room coldly and leaned against the bed with a grim expression.

He could not allow himself to be suppressed by Jeanne like that.

He could not let Jeanne beat him to it just because of this one time!

He had to kill Jeanne!

However, Jeanne was protected by his fourth uncle. Anyone with eyes could see how much his fourth uncle liked Jeanne and how much he indulged the woman!
