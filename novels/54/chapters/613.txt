Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jeannie is right. The most important thing now is not to let this family fall apart! From the day I married into the family, I’ve become a Lawrence. No matter what happens, I will definitely advance or retreat with the Lawrences!” Jenifer was very determined. With that look of hers, it would be a pity for her not to win the best actress award.

Jeanne smiled, finding it a little ironic. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She said, “You’re injured, mother. Go back to your room to rest. I will handle the matters here.”

“That won’t do–”

“Joshua, take your mother back to her room to rest. She’s exhausted.” Jeanne’s tone was a little stern.

Joshua looked at Jeanne and then at Jenifer with uncertainty.

At that moment, the others also came forward to advise Jenifer, “Go back to your room to rest and get your wound treated. Jeannie is very capable. She can take care of Old Master Lawrence’s funeral. You don’t have to worry too much.”

The surrounding people were all talking at once, so Jenifer could only agree and go upstairs with Joshua.

Jeanne looked at Jenifer’s back and turned around to say politely, “A lot of unimaginable things have happened at home. I’m sorry everyone had to see that, and I apologize to everyone on behalf of all the Lawrences.”

“No one saw this coming. The fact that you can handle this matter so calmly is already something else. If it were anyone else, they probably wouldn’t know what to do!” someone in the hall said with admiration.

Many people also echoed that sentiment.

From the various criticism toward Jeanne just now to the absolute approval toward Jeanne now, Jeanne’s image had been subverted, and her reputation had improved.

Jeanne bowed to everyone and then started methodically arranging Jonathan’s funeral matters. She also delegated work to the servants who had come back.

The funeral resumed as usual.

However, there was still a lot of discussion at the scene, probably because everyone was shocked by Alexander’s actions.

Jeanne did not need to care about what everyone was saying. She took the initiative to walk toward Old Master Swan and said respectfully, “Dad, thank you.”

It was sincere gratitude.

She really did not expect him to take the initiative to drive over to the Lawrence family’s manor to support her.

Old Master Swan nodded and accepted her thanks. He said, “If you’re going to take over your grandfather’s funeral matters, there’ll be a lot for you to deal with. It won’t be convenient for you to have George around, so I’ll take him back with me.”

Jeanne glanced at George, asking for George’s opinion.

George thought about it and felt that Old Master Swan had helped him today.

Even though he did not like Fourth Master Swan very much, he did not particularly dislike or like Old Master Swan very much. Moreover, Old Master Swan had helped him today.

Hence, George nodded obediently. “Okay.”

Seeing that George had agreed, Jeanne said politely, “In that case, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of George.”

“George is my biological grandson, so, of course, I’ll take care of him. I actually hope George can spend more time with me.” Old Master Swan suddenly sighed.

His usually cold tone seemed mixed with some emotions.

Jeanne did not know how to answer because she could not make George spend more time with Old Master Swan. She did not even know how long she could stay in the Swans.

Old Master Swan did not say much. He just said, “George is so alike to Edward when he was young.”

It turned out Old Master Swan wanted to make up for his lack of love for Edward to George.

In fact, Jeanne knew that Edward would have had to go through cruel training to possess his current abilities. With that, Edward must not have had a pleasant childhood. Old Master Swan probably did not show any fatherly love to Edward, so he wanted to make up for that guilt on Edward’s son.

That was probably what people called grandparental love.

Jeanne watched Old Master Swan leave with George.

At that moment, Monica had already walked toward Jeanne from Michael’s side. Following Jeanne’s line of sight, Monica became more and more pretentious. “Jeanne, how could you have hidden it from me?”

Jeanne felt a headache coming.

“Tell me honestly, when did you sleep with Fourth Master Swan? How did you manage to sleep with him? Tell me honestly!” Monica was about to explode.

How could she not know about such a big thing?

Moreover, from the looks of it, everyone in the Swans knew about it. In that case, Fourth Master Swan already knew about it long ago.

Was that why Fourth Master Swan pursued Jeanne so relentlessly?

F*ck. To think she was so worried about her and Fourth Master Swan.

However, now that she thought about it, they were just having a lovers’ quarrel!
