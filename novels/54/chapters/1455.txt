She turned to Candice and said, “Goodnight, Sis.”

Candice nodded, and Chloe left unwillingly. After that, Candice closed the door.

“Lock it.” In the room, Edward instructed her in a low voice.

It turned out the man was just pretending to be asleep because he did not want to talk to Chloe.

Candice locked the door as she was told and then returned to her bed. The moment she crawled into bed, Edward pressed her body down.

“What are you doing?”

“What else is there besides you?” The corners of Edward’s lips curled up into a smile.

In front of outsiders, a man who was upright, serious, calm, and reserved was really horny in private.

Candice decided to play hard to get. She said, “Don’t tell me you were teased by Chloe?”

“You knew her purpose for coming, but you still don’t stop her. Do you think your husband, I, has strong willpower, or do you think Chloe doesn’t have the assets

“I want to drive her out and leave nothing behind.” Candice enunciated each word. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I accept your reason.” Edward smiled.

The next second, the two of them made crazy and passionate love in bed.

Candice always felt that it was not bad to spend a lifetime with Edward. Other than the fact that he could not forget Jeanne, everything else was fine. She even liked his children. Hence, she had never thought she would give Edward up.

Under the same night sky, Nox was bored out of his mind. He thought that he would be in a better mood now that his marriage was on the agenda.

After all, he felt that it was a rare thing for him to be able to settle down with a woman. He should be proud of himself and celebrate. However, for some reason, he still felt frustrated.

He called Finn, wanting the latter to accompany him out for a drink to relieve his boredom, only for Finn to reject his invitation. Finn said he was now the father of two and had a greater responsibility of taking care of his child.

Finn’s news triggered Nox even more. In the beginning, Nox thought that Finn would die alone. However, a woman started pursuing him later on, and he became the fastest one to get married among the three of them. Although his marriage did not go well, they got back together and separated many times.

Just when he thought that Finn was going to die alone again, Finn suddenly told him that he was going to be a father. At that time, he was talking to Zoe about marriage and was still hesitant about it. However, Finn’s news triggered him so badly that he was not hesitant about it anymore.

He, too, could be a father — a father of twins! Or even if he could not be the father of twins, he could at least have two kids in three years. In any case, he could not fall behind Monica and Finn.

Yet, now that everything was settled and confirmed, he felt empty and lonely again.

Nox put out his cigarette and dialed Zoe’s number.

“Where are you?” Nox asked.

“What’s wrong? I have something on tonight and might not be able to come over,” Zoe quickly said.

At that moment, she was at the nightclub. The thought of her getting married

to Nox in a month made her want to indulge herself.

She had never thought that Nox would want to marry her. Although she knew that Nox was serious about her and that they were dating on the premise of marriage, she had always thought that Nox would not marry her so soon.

Nox did not look like someone who wanted to be a father but someone who was more suitable for dating. Therefore, she had always thought that their relationship could last for a while and that she could have fun for a year and a half.

Unexpectedly, Nox suddenly made up his mind to get married. Since he had brought it up, she definitely could not reject him. She could only show his enthusiasm and excitement as she agreed.

After agreeing, her first thought was to have as much fun as she could before getting married.

“I know you have something to do, but I just wanted to ask you where you are. I’m a little bored, so I’ll come over to look for you.”

Zoe’s body stiffened.

Nox wanted to come and look for her? She was just looking for an excuse. How was she going to cover up her lie now?

“Why? Is it inconvenient?” Nox sounded a little angry.

“No, I’m just afraid that you’ll know that I’m at the nightclub,” Zoe said carefully.

To her, the most perfect lie was to make everything that was fake become real..
