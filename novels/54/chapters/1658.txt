“Mom, how can you make decisions for me without me knowing? I won’t go!”

As Benjamin was agitated, his voice was much louder, and everyone on the bus looked at him.

“I don’t care what you think. Anyway, this matter has been decided.” Mrs. Bacon said firmly, “It’s okay if you don’t come back. Your father and I will go to your school to look for you immediately and send you abroad in a week.”

Benjamin was really on the verge of breaking down from his mother’s sudden unreasonable behavior.

He gritted his teeth. “I’ll be right back!”

With that, he hung up. Then, he got off at the nearest bus stop and went straight to the intercity bus station.

His family did not live in the main area of South Hampton City but in a relatively remote town in South Hampton City. Due to his excellent grades when he was young, he was directly accepted into the best school in South Hampton City. After that, he continued his studies in South City and became the role model of that town.

Once Benjamin was on the intercity bus, he gave Shelly a call. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The other party asked happily, “Are you here?”

“Shelly, I have something to do back in my hometown, but I’ll be back tomorrow,” Benjamin said apologetically.

“Oh, okay.” The disappointment was obvious in her tone, but she did not make things difficult for him.

“Um, I’m sorry.” Benjamin apologized.

“It’s okay. You can finally go home now that your exams are over, so you have to go back first. It doesn’t matter if you go back for a few more days. I’ll be home anyway.” It meant that she would wait for him at home.

Benjamin was really touched, and at that moment, he did not have any regrets about not going abroad.

After he hung up the phone, Shelly sighed heavily. She suddenly felt that it was not easy to be in a relationship. She had never felt that way about anyone before, but now, she was really disappointed because Benjamin did not come.

Moreover, for some reason, she had a feeling that something was going to happen, and it made her feel uneasy! However, she had to admit that a woman’s sixth sense was really strong sometimes because she received a call from an unknown number one afternoon.

The person on the other end said, “I’m Benjamin’s mother.”

It was three days after Benjamin returned to his hometown. On the first day, they often sent messages and called each other, but on the second day, the number of messages decreased. On the third day, she did not hear from him at all.

She assumed Benjamin was busy because he was back at home. However, now that she had received a call from Benjamin’s mother, she knew that things were not as simple as they seemed.

She said, “Hello, Auntie.”

“You don’t have to call me that. I’m in South Hampton City now. Where do you live? I want to talk to you about you and my son face to face.” The other party was straightforward and had a rather domineering attitude.

“Where’s Benjamin?”

“Don’t worry about where he is. I want to talk to you in private.”

Shelly hesitated for a moment before saying,” Okay, I’ll give you the address.”

The other party hung up the phone abruptly, and Shelly knew that Benjamin’s mother had come with ill intentions.

In fact, she had not thought much about it since she and Benjamin were just dating. As long as they had a good relationship, everything else was not important, so she had never thought about what his family would think. To any family, a woman with a child would not be the best candidate for a daughter-in-law. Hence, Shelly waited nervously, and an hour later, there was a knock on the door.

A little frightened, Shelly took a deep breath to calm herself down before opening the door to see a woman and a man in their fifties standing at the door. They looked very imposing, and she could tell at a glance that they were up to no good.

At that moment, Shelly still kept her manners. “Hello, Uncle and Auntie.”

Mr. and Mrs. Bacon just looked at Shelly coldly and did not respond to her enthusiasm. They said, “We just want to talk to you about you and Benjamin.” “Please, come in.” Shelly invited them in.

The two people at the door did not refuse and swaggered in. The moment they entered, they saw Bella.

Upon seeing them, Bella looked curious.

“Is this your daughter?” Mrs. Bacon asked with obvious disdain.

“Bella, say hello,” Shelly hurriedly called out to Bella.

Bella was just about to speak when Mrs. Bacon mocked, “Don’t say it. I’m not lucky enough to have such a big granddaughter!”

Although Bella was young, she could feel the unfriendliness of the person in front of her, so she hid behind Shelly in fear.

Shelly patted Bella’s head. “I have something to discuss with these people. Bella, be good and go to your room to play..”
