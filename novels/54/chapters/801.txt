Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Heh! Are you threatening me?” The ringleader snickered.

“If you dare to touch her, I’ll raze your territory to the ground tonight to pay tribute to her!” Kingsley enunciated every word.

The ringleader of M Underground Organization was obviously threatened by Kingsley’s words because he did not speak for a long time.

However, it made the atmosphere tense and suffocating.

The people on both sides were armed with heavy weapons. A battle started because of one person, but it also ended because of one person.

Even so, it was not over yet.

The confrontation lasted for a long time until Kingsley said, “I’ve brought the killer who killed your sister.”

The ringleader’s face turned cold.

“I’ll give him to you, and you can take revenge however you want. ”

“Do you think I’ll accept it just because you gave me a puppet from your family? Hill, dream on!”

“I’ll give you a car full of the latest ammunition for free and 20 professional assassins with professional training. One of them is equivalent to three of your organization!” Kingsley stated his conditions.

Despite that, the ringleader did not seem to be moved.

“I’ll protect you for three years for free! If anyone dares to invade this area and take your territory, my Hills will help you to settle it at once. In three years, we will clear all the obstacles and help you become the king of this area!” Kingsley continued.

“Alright!” The ringleader suddenly agreed.

For Kingsley to be able to do that was already his limit. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Send me the thing you gave me and your people!” the ringleader said fiercely.

“Open the door.”

“Sure!” The ringleader said, “But you have to come in yourself.”

Kingsley did not agree.

“Why? Don’t you dare to?” The ringleader mocked.

“Open the door, and I’ll come in!” Kingsley said firmly.

The ringleader smiled coldly and ordered, “Open the door!”

The door opened slowly, and the car drove in from outside.

Jeanne stood high in the open air and watched as Kingsley’s black car drive toward the base.

Her eyes flickered when she realized that there were a few snipers on the same high platforms around them. Once Kingsley got off the car…

It was a trap.

M Underground Organization did not want just anything from the Hills. They wanted everything from the Hills, and the negotiation just now was just to lure Kingsley into the trap.

She stared closely at the snipers. She knew very well that if she reminded Kingsley now, she would die. However, if she did not warn him, Kingsley would surely die.

Her throat moved slightly, and countless results flashed through his mind.

She could even imagine that if she made any move at that moment, Edward would die with her.

Her body, which she had been enduring the pain, was trembling slightly.

She watched as Kingsley’s car drove into the base and then stopped.

After the car stopped, an assassin got out of the front passenger seat and respectfully walked to the back door to open it for Kingsley.

‘No,’ Jeanne thought.

Her eyes were fixed on the sniper not far away, and she could tell that he was prepared.

“Kingsley, don’t get out of the car!” Jeanne shouted.

The moment she shouted, she jumped down.

She was so fast that the man, who had his gun pointed at her head, could not react in time. Moreover, no one had expected Jeanne to do such a thing.

After all, it was 50 meters, not five meters.

If she jumped down 50 meters, she would definitely die!

That was why he did not expect Jeanne to do such a thing. She was simply courting death.

However, at that moment, no one noticed that Edward had also jumped.

The moment Jeanne jumped down, he jumped down with her without even thinking twice. He held her tightly in his arms with one arm and grabbed the tall pillar supporting the balcony with the other hand. However, the pillar was very thick, and it was impossible to hold it with one hand. Coupled with the gravity of their free fall, Edward’s hand slid down the pillar, and the two of them continued falling.

During the fall, Edward protected Jeanne with his body. That way, even if she fell, she would fall on him.

The jump from a height of 50 meters was so short that Jeanne did not have time to resist, nor did she think of resisting.

She admitted that she did not want to die. However, if she did not die, Edward might die instead.

Hence, she tensed up and held on tightly to Edward.

Just as she thought both of them would fall to the ground with a “bang”...
