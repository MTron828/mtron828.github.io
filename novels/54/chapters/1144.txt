1145 Monica Risked Her Life To Save Finn

At South Hampton City Central Hospital, Finn sorted out everything he had and handed over all the work.

Just as he prepared to leave, his phone suddenly rang.

Finn glanced at the caller ID on his phone. After looking at it for a while, he put his phone in his pocket and left the office.

He walked past Gary’s intensive care unit.

From a distance, he saw that Monica was also there. She was expressionless as she looked at the person lying inside.

Having heard his footsteps, Monica turned her head and took a look.

She looked at Finn, who had already taken off his white doctor’s coat and was now wearing casual clothes.

She still did not show much emotion. She even walked away from Finn the moment he walked over.

Finn pursed his lips.

Just like that, they brushed past each other.

Finn looked at Gary.

According to Gary’s current condition, with the treatment of an international expert doctor, the chances of him regaining consciousness should be very high.

That was all he could do, and it was the last thing he would do for Cardellinis.

He stayed with Gary for a while before leaving the hospital. After leaving this hospital, his life and death were up to fate to decide.

He got into his car. As soon as he started the car and drove out of the garage, he saw a familiar car following behind him.

Logically speaking, Monica would usually stay in the hospital during the weekends, and she rarely left halfway.

Finn looked away and did not think too much about it.

In reality, Monica followed behind him not because she wanted to follow him, but because she had just realized that her antidepressants had run out. She had made an appointment with a psychiatrist to get the medicine and receive treatment.

Sometimes, she was so busy that she did not even have time for herself.

She drove at a steady pace to the counseling center.

It was past 3 p.m. in the afternoon. Although it was not the peak hour for traffic and not many cars were on the road, there were still quite a few.

Anyway, the traffic was heavy, but it was not congested.

The car drove for a long distance.

Monica did not want to follow behind Finn, but because the counseling center was not far from Finn’s house, that was her route.

However, she purposely stopped at a traffic light even when there were still a few seconds to go, which caused the car behind her to honk non-stop.

Monica watched indifferently as Finn’s car drove further and further away from her.

As she was thinking about Finn getting further and further away from her, the light turned green again.

Monica drove forward unhurriedly.

On the quiet road, a sudden screeching of brakes could be heard. The next second, the entire street was in chaos.

Monica frowned.

In the distance, she saw a car retreating quickly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

An instinctive fear suddenly arose in her heart as she recalled the scene of her and Finn getting into a car accident.

Right at that moment, Finn’s car suddenly lost control and drove crazily on the road. It was the same scene as the last time!

Did Finn offend someone again?

Was Michael not dead?

She really could not think of anyone else Finn could have provoked!

As a doctor, he should not have any enmity with anyone. Why was Finn being pursued so frequently?

Being pursued…

Monica’s grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Finn, who was driving the car like a madman, naturally looked a little tense at the moment.

He tried his best to calm himself down and skillfully maneuvered the steering wheel to avoid the cars one after another in an attempt to escape.

He knew that the Sanders was going to make a move on him, but he did not expect it to happen so quickly.

He had originally planned to go back and help George settle down, but Alex’s words had made him wary. Since Edward had handed George over to him, he had the obligation to protect George.

However, the current situation was much worse than he had thought. Perhaps he would not have the chance to make the arrangements himself!

His eyes narrowed.

After shaking off a car that was speeding toward him, he quickly made a call. “Teddy.”

“Dr. Jones,” the other party said respectfully.

“Take George and leave now. Don’t go back to the Swans, and don’t stay in my apartment anymore. Don’t appear in public for a while and don’t contact us. We’ll contact you when everything is stable.”

“Alright.” Teddy quickly agreed.
