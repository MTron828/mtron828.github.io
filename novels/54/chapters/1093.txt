1094 Neither of Them Needed The Other Anymore

Richie went forward and grabbed Monica’s body. He strangled her neck and brought her to the railing on the rooftop.

Although the railing was very high, she could be pushed down by force.

Monica kept resisting, but in the end, there was a huge difference in strength between her and the man.

She gritted her teeth and looked coldly at Richie, who had lost control of himself.

“If you want to kill me, we can die together. Anyway, I’ve lived for a long time, and I’m old enough. It’s just a pity that you’re in your prime!” Richie said viciously.

At that moment, he used all his strength to push Monica out of the railing.

Monica kept resisting, with both her hands grabbing the railing. However, Richie’s grip on her neck was so painful that she almost fainted.

The moment she thought that she might really die here, the pain in her neck suddenly disappeared, and Richie left her in an instant.

He was thrown to the ground.

Monica gasped for air.

At that moment, she saw a man in a white coat beating Richie to the ground as if he might beat him to death.

“Finn.” Monica suddenly went forward and pulled him back.

Finn paused for a moment. Then, he clenched his fists tightly and punched Richie’s face again.

The latter had no strength to resist. His face was already bruised and swollen, and his nose was bleeding.

“Stop fighting,” Monica shouted at him.

Finn held himself back and let go of Richie, who was lying on the ground and could not move.

Monica glanced at Richie, whom she did not feel any sympathy for his miserable state. She said, “Let’s go.”

She was speaking to Finn.

Finn’s throat moved slightly, and he left the rooftop with Monica.

If he had not come out for a smoke just now, Monica might really have been pushed off the roof by that man.

Monica’s expression after she was rescued was too cold.

She did not seem excited at all about being revived from the dead. She just calmly accepted that fact.

Suddenly, Finn remembered what Nox had said about Monica’s depression.

At that moment, his eyes suddenly narrowed.

He stretched out his hand to pull Monica, who seemed to be walking a little fast.

The moment he touched Monica, she shook him off without any hesitation, just like she did to Richie.

Finn’s fingers moved slightly before he put it down and said, “Let me take a look at your neck.”

There were some strangulation marks on her neck, which was obviously the result of being strangled by one’s hand.

“No need.” Monica said, “It’s nothing serious.”

“Monica–”

“Thank you for just now.” Monica interrupted him and said very politely.

Finn’s expression changed slightly, and Monica did not say anything else.

In fact, she was not very touched.

She felt that if it were anyone else he met who was going to be killed, Finn would definitely lend a helping hand if he encountered that situation.

“Nox said you have depression.” The moment Monica left, Finn suddenly spoke.

Nox really had a big mouth.

Monica replied, “Yes.”

“Do you know how dangerous depression can be?” Finn asked her.

Monica did not answer, and she did not want to answer either. Right now, all she wanted was to keep her distance from Finn.

“I can help you contact the best doctor to treat you–”

“Dr. Jones,” Monica interrupted him.

Finn subconsciously clenched his fists.

Monica’s indifference toward him and distance from him was really obvious.

“You’re a cardiologist, and your duty is to treat patients in the cardiology department, including my father. I hope you can spend more time and energy on my father. As for me, I’m not your responsibility. In fact, I’m a burden to you. I hope you can understand that,” Monica said firmly and politely to Finn.

She really did not want to have too much interaction with Finn; she did not even want to feel his warmth.

She knew that he was a doctor with a kind heart, but she did not care.

She bowed to Finn. “Please take care of my father.”

After that, she turned around and left determinedly.

Finn stared at Monica’s back and thought that was probably the best for them.

Neither of them needed the other anymore.

…

In the Delta Islands, Jeanne was grounded for a long time, without any television or cell phone. For the first time, she was suffering.

She was standing on Lucy’s balcony.

To be honest, Lucy had become her only pastime here.

...

However, Lucy did not belong to her alone. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At that moment, Lucy had changed into a khaki-colored windbreaker. If not for the cocoon-like scar on her face, she could really charm everyone.

“Are you going to fool around with Kerby again?” Jeanne could not help but tease her.

Lucy chuckled and said, “Are you jealous?”

“I’m not.” Jeanne smiled.

She wondered if a certain person would be jealous.

“I have good news for you.” Lucy deliberately acted mysterious.

“You slept with Kerby?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Sometimes, Lucy was really speechless with Jeanne. She said, “Monica, whom you’re most worried about, has won.”

“What?” Jeanne’s interest was piqued.

She was also a little excited.

...

“I’ve read the latest news report from Harken. Michael was executed this morning, and the biggest competitor of the Cardellini Enterprise, Sunny Pharmaceutical, has declared bankruptcy. At the same time, all the drugs produced by Sunny Pharmaceutical have been banned from being sold. It’s only a matter of time before Cardellini Enterprise re-develops.” Lucy explained, “I told you, you need to give Monica a stage to perform, and she’ll surprise you.”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

She was indeed a little surprised.

Most importantly, it took much less time than she had expected.

“I believe Kingsley will return your phone to you very soon.” Lucy looked in the mirror to make sure she was dressed properly. Then, she opened the door and said, “I’m going out– Mr. Thorn.”

In an instant, she was extremely respectful.

Jeanne also turned to look in that direction and saw Kingsley, whose expression was dark.

He seemed to think that Lucy was a little too excessive and gorgeously dressed.

After all, she was wearing some perfume.

“I’m looking for Jeanne,” Kingsley said bluntly.

He did not react to Lucy.
