976 How Should She Repay Jeannie?

All these years, he had never touched a woman, except for that one time when he slept with Monica out of his own will.

However, that did not affect his body much. He still did not have the desire to take the initiative, but from that day onward… that day when he saw the pink bra in Monica’s hand, he had the same dream for several days in a row.

It was the same wet dream.

Finally, that morning, that happened.

Was Monica reminding him just now that he should find a woman to satisfy his physical needs?

Finn subconsciously clenched his fists.

However, when he heard the knock on the door again, he instantly returned to normal, and no one could read his emotions.

…

By the time Monica left Finn’s office and returned to the ward, her parents were awake.

Ruby was helping Gary wash his face gently.

“Where did you go so early in the morning?” Ruby asked her daughter.

Monica said, “I was talking to Finn about dad’s surgery. The time has been set for the day after tomorrow at 10 a.m. Finn said he has contacted the doctor, and everything is ready. There shouldn’t be any problems.”

Ruby could not hide how nervous she was about it

Monica pretended to be relaxed as she said to Gary, “Dad, you have to do your part too!”

“Alright.” Gary seemed more at ease about the surgery than Ruby.

He probably did not want them to worry.

“I’m going to work, but I’ll come to the hospital after work tonight.”

“Take care of yourself. Don’t tire yourself out.” Ruby did not forget to remind her.

“Don’t worry. I know.”

With that, Monica left the hospital.

As soon as she got into the car, she received a call from Jeanne, who asked, “Have you left the hospital?”

“I just left, and I’m going to the office now.”

“Come to the hotel and pick me up. We’ll go together.”

“Okay.”

Monica drove to Jeanne’s hotel. Besides Jeanne, there was another person at the entrance.

Jeanne opened the car door and sat in the front passenger seat, while the other person sat in the back.

Monica could not help but take a few more glances. No matter what, her curiosity would get the better of her.

“Mason.” Jeanne said, “He’s a friend.”

“Your boyfriend?” Monica frowned.

Mason glanced at Monica, and Monica could tell that the person was not to be trifled with.

Jeanne rolled her eyes at Monica.

“You can’t blame me for making wild guesses. You have a home to go back to, yet you’re staying in a hotel with a man. What do you want me to think?” Monica complained, but at that moment, she suddenly gloated. “Do you think Fourth Master Swan will explode from anger if he finds out?”

“He’s not that petty.”

“Hehe.” Monica deliberately sneered. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Men had never been magnanimous when it came to their desire to control women.

While they were conversing, the car arrived at Cardellini Pharmaceutical.

After that, Monica led Jeanne and Mason into her office.

Her secretary made them three cups of coffee.

Steve was right about her gradually falling in love with the taste of black coffee to refresh himself.

“Mason and I went to the quality inspection department last night,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Monica almost choked on her coffee.

“What did you just say?” Monica swallowed and asked excitedly.

“I said, Mason and I sneaked into the quality inspection department yesterday.”

“To do what?”

“To familiarize myself with one of the structures inside.”

Last night, after Jeanne’s phone call with Monica, she and Mason went to explore the quality inspection department.

She had to admit that Lucy had helped her a lot by asking her to bring Mason along. It would not be easy for her to sneak into the quality inspection department alone, but with Mason’s help, it was a piece of cake. Last night, they managed to explore the internal structure of the quality inspection department to make it easier for them to carry out the next step!

“Why did you have to familiarize yourself with the structure?” Monica’s eyes widened in confusion.

“Most of Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine has been detained by the quality inspection department, so I wanted to find where they store the vaccine so that we can use it directly.”

“How do I use it?” Monica asked.

“Think again.” Jeanne gave her some time to think.

Monica frowned, but the next second, she said, “Don’t tell me you want to inject it into someone on the spot?!”

“Why not?”

“What if there’s a problem with the vaccine?” Monica was surprised.

“Didn’t you say that there’s no problem with it?”

“But… didn’t something happen?” Monica was not confident.

“Monica, since you believe in your father and Cardellini Enterprise, you shouldn’t back down.”

“I just–”

“And I believe that there’s no problem with the vaccine.” Jeanne said, “That’s why I’ll test it on George.

“What?” Monica started to feel nervous again.

“It’s a vaccine for six-year-olds. I’ve checked, and George hasn’t had it yet.”

“Jeannie.” This time, Monica was touched.

It was true. She felt like she was the luckiest person in her life to have met Jeanne.

She really did not know how she could repay Jeanne in the future.

“Just don’t make me come all the way here to solve your problems next time,” Jeanne said as if she could read Monica’s mind.

Monica pouted as the feelings that had been brewing in her were shattered.

Her eyes flickered as she looked at Jeanne’s phone, which suddenly rang.

It looked like an important call because Jeanne’s expression had changed, and she looked nervous.

Jeanne answered the call. “What’s the result?”

“It was indeed drugs that caused the child’s death. I’ve written down the name of the drug and the method of death in the test report and sent it to your phone. You can take a look and ask me anything if you don’t understand.”

“Alright. Thank you.”

“As I should.”

Jeanne put down her phone and said to Monica, “I’ve got the autopsy results.”

Monica’s heart raced.

At that moment, she could not help but sigh at Jeanne’s efficiency.

When would she be able to learn Jeanne’s decisiveness and dominance?
