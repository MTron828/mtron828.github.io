Chapter 109: Another Identity of Jeanne, Exposed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne returned to her office.

There were not many people who worked overtime during the weekend, but all of Jeanne’s team members were present.

After the meeting, everyone received news and knew that Jeanne had been appointed. In the workplace, it was still a place that required performance. Everyone immediately congratulated Jeanne enthusiastically.

In the face of everyone’s fawning, Jeanne only said, “Meeting!”

“...”

As expected, Director Lawrence was completely different from the other leaders.

Everyone did not dare to be negligent and hurriedly followed Jeanne to the meeting room.

Joshua Lawrence stood at the door of his office and watched Jeanne being supported by others.

In the past, it was clear that he was the one who had such glory.

He fiercely closed the door of his office and returned to his seat.

He never worked overtime on weekends. Even when his father had a meeting on weekends, he would not come. If it was not for Jeanne, if it was not to boost his performance, he would not have to get up early in the morning on weekends. He sat in his seat in a huff and called Eden.

“Brother-in-law, I didn’t know that you would help Jeanne even if you were helping me. The 200 million interest-free loan you gave to Lawrence Enterprise completely erased Jeanne’s mistake where she modified the contract without authorization. You were practically assisting in her attack!” Joshua Lawrence said in a huff. “She’s been appointed and has climbed over my head within a week of entering the company!”

At this moment, Eden’s mood was even more sullen than Joshua’s.

When he took out the three-year interest-free policy today, his entire being was suppressing his anger.

He was being played around by Jeanne.

Not only did he not teach Jeanne a lesson, he even lost a sum of money.

200 million was not much, but he was not willing to waste a single cent on Jeanne.

He never thought that Jeanne would climb onto his head!

This woman did not care about his reputation back then and almost ruined his image. She should have received the retribution she deserved.

He gritted his teeth and said to Joshua, “Don’t push all the blame on me here. Your family wanted me to take out an interest-free loan, why didn’t you inform me in advance?”

If he knew about this earlier, he could take precautions and think of many ways to reject her.

The matter came unexpectedly, so he did not dare to act rashly. If he did not think things through and left a loose end, he had to consider his image and position in the company.

“I, I didn’t know either,” Joshua Lawrence.

Eden sneered, “Joshua Lawrence, you’d better learn to be smarter. When the time comes, don’t blame me for not helping you!”

Eden left these words and directly hung up the phone. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He did not want to waste his breath on trash like Joshua Lawrence. He only wanted to kill Jeanne.

At this moment, the phone rang again.

Eden looked at it impatiently and paused.

He took a deep breath and adjusted his emotions. “Miss Sanders.”

“What’s going on?” Melody Sanders was furious. “Why did MUK Group negotiate the contract with the Lawrence Enterprise? Weren’t you confident? Didn’t you make all the arrangements? Eden, is that all you’ve got?”

Eden was insulted by Melody Sanders and felt very upset.

However, with Melody Sanders’s identity, he could only swallow his anger. “I underestimated Jeanne.”

“I don’t want to hear excuses! Tell me now, what do you plan to do next?”

“I haven’t thought of it yet.”

“You haven’t thought of it yet?” Melody Sanders gritted her teeth. “Do you mean that I don’t need to look for you in the future? If so, I’ll look for someone else.”

“Miss Sanders, that’s not what I meant.” Eden hurriedly explained, “You and Micheal are friends, and Micheal is my best friend. Your matters are naturally my matters. It’s just that this time, I was suddenly schemed by Jeanne. I also need time to digest it. Don’t worry, I will do what you told me to do well. Just give me a little time.”

“I don’t want to waste too much time.” Melody Sanders’s demeanor was very strong. “I will give you at most one month. I want to see Jeanne’s reputation destroyed.”

“I will try my best.”

“Eden, Micheal said that you are a very capable person. He asked me to trust you 100%. I hope that you will not let down Micheal’s affirmation of you!”

Eden clenched his fists. He was also suppressing his anger.

“I am not asking you to help me for nothing. As long as you settle Jeanne, Sanders will be the pillar behind you. Whatever you want to do, as long as it is within the scope of our family’s ability, I will satisfy you. And you should know clearly how supreme the power of Sanders is in Harken.” Melody Sanders told him clearly, “In other words, you can do whatever you want in Harken in the future! You might even surpass your uncle’s position.”
