Chapter 722: Edward, I’ve Missed You So Much

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Joshua was getting tempted.

“Once you become the son-in-law of the Sanders, have you thought about... your position in the future? Not to mention Jeanne, even my Fourth Uncle has to bow down to you when he sees you.” Eden egged him on.

It seemed Joshua was convinced by Eden.

“If you’ve thought it through, come to me. I will help you think of a way to sleep with Quinn. Now, I will go to the human resources department to submit my resignation letter.” Eden did not try to persuade Joshua further.

If he did, Joshua would become suspicious instead.

When he left, Joshua could not help but ask, “Why are you helping me?”

“I can’t bear to see Jeanne live a good life,” Eden said bluntly.

After all, the enemy of an enemy was a friend.

Joshua would believe him, and he did because that plan was too tempting. What he once dared not think about suddenly made him excited.

If he could really get Quinn to be with him… Jeanne would be trampled under his feet in the future.

The Lawrences could even become part of the royal family.

Then, his late grandfather and father would also “rest in peace”!

…

Eden’s sudden resignation really did surprise Jeanne.

She had received a report from the human resources department asking if she wanted to approve Eden’s resignation application. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jeanne approved it without thinking twice.

No matter what tricks Eden was playing, it was better for him to be out of her sight.

Jeanne did not take the matter of Eden’s resignation to heart and continued to work until Eden came to look for her.

Jeanne did not look too happy about it.

On the other hand, Eden appeared calm as he said, “My Fourth Uncle threatened me and told me not to target you anymore.”

It turned out it was all thanks to Edward.

However, she did not believe Eden could be so obedient. Perhaps it was just for show.

Nevertheless, she did not need to put up false pretenses with Eden. Even if it was some high-sounding words, it was rare for her to waste time on him.

Eden just looked at Jeanne’s indifference toward him and said, “No matter how unwilling I am to submit, and no matter how much I don’t want you to live a good life, I have to say, I admire your ability.”

Jeanne sneered.

Was Eden planning to repent?

Was using such an approach make it less obvious that he was fake?

He continued, “I have to admit that I regret what I did to you back then. If I hadn’t been seduced by Jasmine and put aside my pride back then, I think I wouldn’t have ended up in such a sorry state.”

“Are you done?” Jeanne asked impatiently.

“Everything I’ve done isn’t so much because I can’t stand to see you live a good life, but because I’m jealous of the love I can’t get.”

Jeanne snickered. ‘So is Eden confessing to me now?’

“However, I give up.” Eden said, “In order to live, I give up. And besides leaving Lawrence Enterprise, I will also divorce Jasmine and sever all ties with the Lawrences. Jeanne, our enmity ends here.”

Jeanne still remained indifferent to him as she said, “Eden, I don’t believe in anything anymore.”

Eden’s eyes narrowed. He was still very unhappy about Jeanne’s attitude toward him.

“Please leave,” Jeanne said those words and shifted her gaze onto her computer screen.

She simply had no interest in his every move, word, and action.

Eden held himself back and turned around to leave.

One day, he would make that woman die a horrible death!

…

After a whole day of work and another half a day of overtime, Jeanne left Lawrence Enterprise at 11 p.m.

After dealing with all the things related to the experiential marketing of the physical store, Jeanne drove back to Bamboo Garden.

When she returned home, the house was quiet.

Jeanne kept her footsteps light as she did not want to disturb the others.

The moment she pushed open the door and saw the man lying on the bed in the room, she was stunned for a few seconds.

She had forgotten that Edward was back.

Ever since their short encounter on Lawrence Enterprise’s rooftop today, Jeanne had been busy with her own matters.

Moreover, Edward did not give her a call or send her a message.

Their meeting today was scary, but they both seemed to have chosen the calmest method to deal with it.

“You’re back?” The corners of Edward’s mouth curled up into a faint smile.

“Yeah,” Jeanne responded.

They had only been apart for half a month, yet she did not know how to get along with him anymore.

“I’ll help you fill the bath.” Edward lifted the mattress and got up to go to the bathroom.

Jeanne pursed her lips. Then, she walked into the room, put down her bag, and walked into the bathroom.

In the bathroom, Edward had already filled the bath for her. He had even prepared her innerwear for her.

“Edward,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

Edward’s footsteps halted. “What’s wrong?”

“Did the trip go smoothly?”

“It didn’t go well,” Edward said bluntly. “The deal failed. I’m waiting to be punished by my dad tomorrow.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne muttered.

Edward said, “Take a bath first. We’ll talk after that.”

Jeanne pursed her lips and nodded.

With that, Edward left the bathroom, and Jeanne took a bath.

After the bath, Jeanne returned to the room, where Edward was still sitting at the head of the bed, waiting for her.

Seeing that her hair was still wet, he went straight to the bathroom and took out a clean towel to help her dry it before drying it again with the hair dryer.

Jeanne enjoyed Edward’s service.

Sometimes, she felt that Edward really did treat her well. He doted on her as if she was his daughter.

She pursed her lips lightly. The moment Edward put down the hairdryer and was about to leave, she suddenly hugged his waist.

Edward’s body froze.

Jeanne said, “I’ve missed you so much.”

The smile on the corner of Edward’s mouth was evident.

He said, “Me, too.”

“This is the first time I realized that being away from you was so difficult,” Jeanne said deeply.

Edward casually placed the hair dryer on the head of the bed and then sat back down on the bed to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne looked at him.

The two of them were very close, so close that Jeanne could see the deep love in Edward’s eyes. It was not... lust.

At that moment, she chose to close her eyes and then took the initiative to kiss him.

Edward did not reject her kiss.

That night, they did not sleep. It was the most intimate night they had since their marriage.

Jeanne thought that was probably how their relationship worked — in bed.
