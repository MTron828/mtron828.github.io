Chapter 213: Uncover the Truth While a Sudden Accident Happens

In the court, the judge knocked with the gavel. “Court is in session!”

Everyone in the court stood up once again.

It was dignified and solemn.

Afterward, the people sat.

The court resumed its session.

“Jeanne Lawrence, as the plaintiff, please explain the facts of this case,” the judge said.

Jeanne went from being the defendant to the plaintiff in an instant.

This was something that had never happened in the history of Harken.

The reversal was unbelievable.

The audience present had only come to watch the lawsuit out of curiosity, but they felt lucky at the moment.

Many years later, they might even be able to show off because of this.

Jeanne said respectfully, “In the contract signed between the Lawrence Enterprise and Tenda Planning and Construction Company, Tenda specified on the tender documents that the logistics warehouse’s construction materials will be sourced from Sunshine Company. However, in fact, we know from this case that they were using the lower-priced construction materials from Sunrise Company, thus obtaining a high profit. The profit suddenly appeared in my account, and they used that to frame me. I now need to sue the parties, Adrian Zimmer, Tenda Wadler, and Lunetta Walker for profiteering from the logistics warehouse project and intentionally framing me.”

“The accusation is valid,” the judge said.

“Your Honor, I would like to ask Adrian Zimmer a few questions.”

“Permission granted.”

Jeanne turned to Adrian.

Adrian looked at Jeanne.

At that moment, he was obviously a little too nervous.

His head was full of sweat, and his body was trembling.

“Chief Engineer Zimmer, you’ve been in the Lawrence Enterprise for so many years. How has the Lawrence Enterprise been treating you?”

“Not bad,” Adrian replied.

“If that’s the case, why did you still want to collude with Tenda for personal gains? Don’t you know that it’s against the law?”

“I didn’t gain anything!” Adrian denied. At that moment, he suddenly thought of something and quickly said, “It must be Tenda himself. He must’ve been discovered by me, so he deliberately framed you to reduce the evidence of his crime. That must be it!”

When Tenda heard that, he was also agitated. “You were clearly the one who asked me to frame Jeanne. Now, you’re accusing me instead!”

“What nonsense are you spouting, Tenda?!”

“I’m not spouting nonsense!”

The two of them suddenly started arguing at the scene.

The judge said sternly, “Calm down!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Adrian and Tenda finally calmed down slightly.

Jeanne asked the judge for permission to speak to Tenda.

Obviously, Tenda was the most important person in this case.

Jeanne asked bluntly, “Tenda, did you say that Adrian was the one who wanted you to frame me?”

Tenda was still a little hesitant.

Adrian was very nervous. He shouted at Tenda, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

“Please don’t say anything, Mr. Zimmer!” The judge was strict.

Adrian looked at Tenda fiercely, his body trembling non-stop.

Tenda was indeed not well-educated and was somewhat like a bandit. Faced with the situation at the moment, it seemed that he did not want to hide anything anymore. He said straightforwardly, “Yes, it was Adrian who asked me to frame you! Even in the logistics warehouse construction project, it was Adrian who asked me to work in secret with him. He said that he’s in charge of the entire construction project. As long as he doesn’t say anything, no one would know that the materials had been replaced. When the time comes, we will split the profit 50-50.”

Everyone at the scene looked at Tenda.

“I previously mentioned that I’m in debt. When I thought that I could repay the money through this method, I agreed to it. It was going well, and I had a sum of money with me. However, Adrian suddenly came to me and said that our secret profit-making plan had been discovered. If we were to go to court, both of us would have to go to jail for many years. Of course, I was also shocked. Adrian said that finding a scapegoat was the best choice, so I agreed to lie with him.

“Adrian gave me a dual contract with your signature on it. He also asked me to give him quotations from Sunshine Company and Sunrise Company. You were right about that account. I didn’t do it. I can’t do it. The date, sales, inventory, profit, and so on… Besides, I don’t look into the accounting expenses of my company. It’s money laundering, after all. I didn’t care so much. It’s not my money anyway.”

Tenda admitted everything at once.

Adrian’s face turned pale.

“Then do you know why Adrian insisted on framing me?” Jeanne asked.

“I asked. He said that it was because you had just returned to Harken. It’s easier to frame you since you’re not familiar with the place.”
