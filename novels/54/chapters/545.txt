Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn was just wondering if he should change the password when he turned around and saw Monica at the door.

He looked at her indifferently and really did keep his distance from her.

He said, “Are you here to pack your things?”

Monica was stunned for a moment before she shook her head. “I want you to come home to see my parents with me.”

“No,” Finn refused flatly.

Monica looked at him.

“That’s your business, and it has nothing to do with me.”

“Finn, even if it’s my business, it’s about our marriage. You have to explain it to my parents.”

“As I said, that’s your business.”

“Please! Can you stop with that?” Monica’s eyes were red.

Finn’s attitude made her feel like he was indifferent to her no matter what she said to him.

“I’ll change the locks first thing in the morning, at the latest.” Finn could not be bothered with Monica, but instead of being angry, he told Monica calmly, “You can come and pack your things before that, and after tomorrow morning, I’ll throw all your things out. Take note of that.”

“Finn!” Monica raised her voice.

However, Finn went straight to his room after saying that and closed the door.

Monica saw Finn’s aloof silhouette disappear behind the door that she seemingly could never open again.

At that sight, her tears fell, and she clenched her teeth.

Finn may not trust her now, but one day, he would believe why she did it!

All she really wanted was to help Michael so that she could be with Finn without feeling guilty.

Then, she turned around and left. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Michael, who was waiting for her in the garage, asked, “Where’s Finn? Isn’t he going to go home with you?”

“I’ll go back myself,” Monica said through gritted teeth.

Without saying anything else, Michael opened the car door for her.

While they were on the way to the Cardellini family’s villa, the news came out. Her father was so furious that he rang her up to tell her to go back immediately and wanted her to bring Finn along.

However, Finn’s phone could not be reached, and toward the end, his phone was switched off.

Monica took a deep breath.

She knew Finn was still angry. Since he was not an open-minded man, to begin with, his reaction was within her expectation, and she did not bother about it.

That was why she had been trying to calm herself down, thinking about how to explain it to her parents.

“Monica.” Michael suddenly opened his mouth.

Monica looked at Michael, who said, “If you tell your parents now that you faked a divorce with Finn to help me. I think they will really beat you to death.”

Monica pursed her lips.

She, too, could imagine how furious her parents would be.

“Besides, if Finn isn’t there with you, your parents might think you’re lying.”

Monica nodded at that possibility.

“Why don’t...” Michael said, “you tell your parents that we’re together for real?”

Monica stared at Michael with her eyes wide.

Michael said, “Your parents wouldn’t stop you from pursuing your true love, and I will also do my best to make sure your parents temporarily accept me.”

“No.” Monica refused immediately. “Once we separate in the future, it’ll be even more troublesome to clarify things. Then, I’m afraid my dad will still beat me to death.”

“I’m just worried your parents won’t understand what you are doing for me now.” Michael said affectionately, “In fact, many people don’t understand your decision, and even I think you’re sacrificing a lot for me. Monica, I really don’t know how to thank you for doing so much for me.”

“All you need to do is build your career as fast as you can. Once you’ve secured your position in the political scene, we can separate peacefully. While you continue to grow, I can go back to my original life.”

“Okay.” Michael nodded.

At any time, Michael would agree to whatever she said, so she trusted Michael with all her heart.

In the meantime, the car arrived at the Cardellini family’s villa.

In the living room, Gary was sitting on the sofa in the hall with a long face. Beside him was Ruby, and beside Ruby was Sarah.

Monica glanced at Sarah.

Feeling Monica’s eyes on her, Sarah quickly explained, “I took half a day off today. I’m not feeling well.”

“If you’re not feeling well, why don’t you go back to your home? Why do you keep coming to mine–”

“Monica!” Gary roared angrily. “How do you still have the cheek to talk about others at a time like that? Don’t you see what you’ve done? What on earth are you doing?”
