Chapter 1720: De-escalating Their Relationship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“In that case, promise me you won’t disturb Shelly and me during this time.” Nox negotiated his conditions.

“Okay,” Mrs. Winter agreed immediately. “As long as you keep your word, I’ll keep mine.”

“I’ll hang up now.”

“Yeah.”

Nox put down his phone and leaned back on the sofa, not having much of an appetite. Who could have an appetite when eating alone anyway?

He might as well lie on the sofa like a corpse.

Shelly ordered Bella’s favorite hamburger and fried chicken and was looking for a place to eat them with Bella when the phone suddenly rang.

The moment Shelly saw the caller ID, her expression darkened. She really did not want to answer Mrs. Winter’s call right now.

However, she eventually picked up the phone and said, “Aunty.”

“Shelly, are you with Nox?”

“That’s good.” The other side let out a sigh of relief. “I just wanted to ask if you do want to leave Nox.”

“Aunty, please just say what you want to say,” Shelly said frankly.

“Nox promised he’d be with you for a year, after one year, he’d leave you. If you don’t want to be with him, try to be as cold to him as possible, and don’t satisfy his needs. Just persevere for a year, and both of you will be free.”

“Okay.” Shelly nodded.

“Shelly, I’ll be really happy if you and Nox could be together, but unfortunately, you have no feelings for him. So, it’s useless for me to force you to be with him. Now that Nox is willing to let go, it’s up to you.” “I know what to do,” Shelly replied.

“In that case, I won’t say much more. Thank you.”

“No need,” Shelly said indifferently.

After all, it was a foregone conclusion, and there was no need for Mrs. Winter to thank her.

“I won’t disturb you anymore. Bye.”

“Bye. ”

When Shelly hung up the phone, Bella looked at her expression and asked innocently, “Mom, who was that?”

“An ordinary person. Eat up.” Shelly came back to her senses and picked up the hamburger for Bella.

“Mom, what’s going on between you and Uncle Nox? You two don’t seem to talk anymore,” Bella asked worriedly.

“It’s nothing.” Shelly patted Bella’s head. “In a year, we can leave him and live on our own.”

“Is that true?” Bella asked, not looking particularly happy.

Shelly was a bit surprised. After all, Bella not disliked Nox, did she not?

The next second, she heard Bella ask again, “Will Uncle Nox be lonely on his own?”

“He won’t be lonely,” Shelly said bluntly.

Nox had so many friends and women around him. Even though he might be upset after the breakup, he certainly would not be lonely.

“Is that so?” Bella looked at Shelly “The last time Uncle Nox lost his temper with you and made me cry, he apologized to me later.”

Shelly was stunned.

“Uncle Nox told me not to tell you.”

“He apologized to you?”

“Yeah. He said he was just a little upset about work that day, so he got angry. It was not at me or you, Mom, and he asked if I could forgive him,” Bella said earnestly. “So, I forgave him.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Oh? You forgave him so easily, huh?”

“It was because Uncle Nox was sincere. He even bought me the ice cream that you wouldn’t let me eat.” Bella blushed as she spoke.

Shelly furrowed her brows.

“I’m sorry, Mom. I shouldn’t have lied to you,” Bella quickly apologized.

Then, Shelly patted Bella’s head. “It’s okay, but you have to tell me the next time. We agreed not to keep secrets between us, remember?”

“Okay.” Bella nodded.

“Let’s eat.” Shelly handed Bella the hamburger.

Bella took a bite and said, “Mom, I think Uncle will definitely be lonely without us.”

“He won’t be,” Shelly said.

“He will. I often see him staring off into space, watching you,” Bella said. “He’s been doing that after the fight.”

Shelly looked at Bella. She did not expect a three-year-old to be so observant. That was why adults should not think that children knew nothing because they could see it all.

“That’s because…” Shelly did not know how to explain it to Bella, so she used the reason that adults often like to use. “You’ll know in the future..”
