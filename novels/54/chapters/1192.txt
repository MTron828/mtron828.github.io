1193 Monica Wakes Up

“Shelly will accompany me.” Nox said, “Anyway, I’ll have to cultivate a relationship with her, right?”

Mrs. Winter wanted to say something, but Wade immediately instructed, “Let them cultivate their relationship. We’ll be leaving.”

“Take care.” Nox looked at their backs.

He could not wait for them to leave so that he could make things clear with Shelly. He did not want Shelly to have any expectations.

Hence, he turned around and looked at Shelly, who was the only one staying behind.

He said, “Don’t think that I really want to develop feelings for you. I’m just looking for a way to not marry you.”

“I know,” Shelly responded.

“It’s good that you know. Although you’ll be living with me this year, just like how you were staying at my place a while ago, we’ll mind our own business. Don’t think about doing anything to me while I’m not fully abled…” Nox said.

Shelly looked at Nox and said slowly, “I want to marry you.”

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

Did he just say a bunch of nonsense?

“So, I will try my best to gain your favor,” Shelly said.

“Are you crazy? I already said I don’t like you–”

“You can choose not to accept my kindness, but you can’t stop me from fighting for my own happiness,” Shelly said bluntly.

Was that woman crazy?

“Do you want to eat?” Shelly suddenly changed the topic.

He almost blurted out the word ‘no’, but he stopped himself.

He was very hungry now, and he could not starve himself to death just because he hated that woman.

He said fiercely, “Do you want me to starve to death?!”

Shelly pursed her lips.

In fact, she was already used to Nox’s bad temper. Hence, she sat beside Nox and started to feed him.

She did not know if she could make Nox fall for her in a year. However, since there was a chance for her to continue staying in that family, she would definitely fight for it.

…

Meanwhile, after Finn left Nox’s ward, he did not leave the hospital. Instead, he went to Monica’s intensive care unit in another part of the hospital.

He sat there and kept Monica company.

In fact, Monica was not in a vegetative state. She had just undergone brain surgery and needed time to recover. However, she was in a coma because of a serious injury to her head.

According to medical experience, she should be able to wake up soon after recuperating for so many days.

Moreover, he heard that Monica’s reaction to the outside world had become more and more obvious over the past few days.

Finn just sat beside her and stayed with her, hoping that she would open her eyes and wake up in the next second.

In fact, ever since Monica’s accident, that was the first time he had taken time out to accompany her.

He could not accompany her before this because he had been shackled by Alex and could not get out. Later, when the Duncans and Sanders went to war, he was released to support them.

In the end, he ran into Nox, whose fate was unknown.

He took a day’s time to perform Nox’s surgery before returning to the Swans to check on Edward’s physical condition. He had originally wanted to bring Jeanne to the hospital for a checkup, but because Jeanne could not go out, he could only think of ways to transport all the examination equipment into Bamboo Garden and become an obstetrician.

It was only after making sure that Jeanne’s baby was fine that he returned to the hospital, where he was met with Nox’s fury.

In fact, he had been holding it in for a long time before he got angry at Nox and said those righteous words. Fortunately, it worked, and he was sure Nox’s mental health was fine.

Then, he returned to Monica’s side and listened to the other doctors explain Monica’s situation to him.

He stretched out his hand and held Monica’s hand. Her originally injured body had also recovered a lot after more than half a month of recuperation. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The only thing was the damage to her brain that kept her from waking up.

He took her hand and placed it on his face gently before he lay down beside Monica’s bed.

He was actually very tired. Ever since Nox’s accident, he had barely rested.

At that moment, as soon as he lay down and closed his eyes, he fell asleep immediately.

Hence, he missed the moment when the person beside him woke up.

The first thing that came to Monica’s mind when she woke up was that her entire body was weak, so weak that she did not seem to have any strength.

The second thing that hit her was that her head hurt. It was as if there was a bomb in her head that was about to explode.
