1264 Jeanne Goes Into Labor

After Edward sent George off, Jeanne was a little bored being alone in the villa.

She walked around the back garden and watched TV in the living room for a while, but in the end, she went to George’s room.

By then, Teddy had cleaned up George’s room.

Jeanne walked toward George’s small study area, where he usually did his homework.

Now, because he had to go for secret training, George was taking a temporary absence from school. Naturally, had not done his homework for a long time.

Jeanne casually flipped through George’s textbooks, which were clean and without any notes. It was even brand new.

That was when she suddenly remembered that the teacher had complained about George not listening in class, sleeping, writing with his head lowered, or never paying attention to the class. Jeanne dealt with the teacher several times and told George to be respectful, but George pretended not to hear her.

Jeanne also pretended that she did not know about the teachers’ complaints.

Later on, she saw the school’s exam results. George was always the top student in the school, so the teachers… left it.

Jeanne put down George’s textbook and suddenly saw George’s diary.

It was a small diary, but Jeanne had never known that George had the habit of keeping a diary. When did it start? Or was it because he was too bored, so he decided to write for fun?

Even though she knew that she should not invade George’s privacy, she could not help but open it.

[XX/XX/XX: I’m back in South Hampton City, and we went to an unfamiliar home. I don’t like everyone in my family, and my mother doesn’t like them either. I want to go back to the Delta Islands.]

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

It turned out he started to keep a diary when they returned to South Hampton City. However, Jeanne continued to read.

[XX/XX/XX: I met someone called Fourth Master Swan today, and I don’t like him.]

Jeanne’s lips curled into a smile.

[XX/XX/XX: My mom sent me to school today, and I don’t like it.]

Jeanne had a smile on her face.

It turned out that her genius baby would vent his emotions through the diary.

[XX/XX/XX: Fourth Master Swan brought me to his house today to wash my hair and give me a shower. I really don’t like it.]

[XX/XX/XX: My mom is getting married to Fourth Master Swan. I won’t give them my blessings.]

[XX/XX/XX: My mom and Fourth Master Swan left me for their honeymoon. I knew that Fourth Master Swan would snatch my mom away one day.]

[XX/XX/XX: I don’t like my godmother. I don’t think she’s very smart, but when she came to participate in the parent-child sports day today, she didn’t seem that stupid.]

Jeanne could not help but laugh. If Monica knew that George looked down on her intelligence, she would probably be infuriated.

[XX/XX/XX: I think my mom is starting to like Fourth Master Swan. I think I’m going to be abandoned by my mom.]

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Therefore, George knew about her feelings for Edward.

[XX/XX/XX: I can’t accept the fact that I’m Fourth Master Swan’s son.]

[XX/XX/XX: My mom left, and Fourth Master Swan came back covered in wounds. I thought he was going to die, but he told me that he would definitely bring my mother back. I didn’t believe him, but… Alright, I’ll believe him this once.]

[XX/XX/XX: I saw my mom again, but she still left at my godmother’s wedding ceremony. I didn’t cry. It was just that Nox was too annoying.]

[XX/XX/XX: My mom is finally back. This time, she came back with my dad and said that she was pregnant with my younger sister.]

Jeanne saw that George’s form of address to Edward had finally changed from Fourth Master Swan to ‘my dad’.

[XX/XX/XX: Ever since my dad came back with my mom, I feel like an orphan with no one to care about me. However, I suddenly like this feeling. I really do have masochistic tendencies.]

[XX/XX/XX: My dad said he has to send me away because he isn’t capable enough. I don’t know why he would say that because, in my heart, he’s omnipotent.] UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jeanne looked at what George thought of Edward. It turned out that in George’s heart, Edward was already… so powerful.

[XX/XX/XX: It wasn’t easy for me to come back, but I realized that the atmosphere at home has changed. My mom is deliberately avoiding my dad, and my dad doesn’t dare to be too proactive with my mom. Sometimes, he’ll just watch my mom silently. I don’t know why things have become like this between them. All I know is that there’s a woman named Susan by my dad’s side. I have a feeling that I need to tell my mom to get my dad back because my dad doesn’t like that woman at all. He only likes my mom.]
