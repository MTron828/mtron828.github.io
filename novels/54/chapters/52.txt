Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Lawrences family’s main hall, after Jeanne left.

Jenifer fanned the flames. “Jeanne is becoming more and more unruly. She was still young seven years ago, but she’s 25 years old now, and yet she’s still doing some ridiculous things. If she provokes the Sanders one day, I’m afraid that even the Lawrences wouldn’t be able to protect her.”

At this moment, Alexander was also holding in his anger.

This time, when Jeanne returned, she did not hold back her anger at him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“When Old Master asked Jeanne to come back, I didn’t agree to it at first. I knew that she wasn’t someone to be trifled with...”

“Enough!” Alexander said sternly.

“Alex, don’t blame me for being too talkative.” Jenifer looked as if she meant good. “I’m also doing this for the Lawrences. I feel that Jeanne came back this time to take revenge on us.”

Alexander’s expression turned cold.

Jenifer deliberately said again, “It would’ve been better if she hadn’t come back.”

“If I can make her come back, I can make her get lost!” Alexander said fiercely, “She can’t behave atrociously in my territory!”

Jenifer smiled coldly and did not say anything more.

She just needed to light the beacon fire and enjoy the fruits of her labor.

…

The next day, Jeanne slowly got up.

George had gotten up early and was playing with his computer in the room.

Jeanne lazily went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet bowl, ready to read the news.

The name “Monica” suddenly flashed on her screen.

Jeanne picked it up. “Monica.”

“Are you up?”

“Yes.”

“Have you seen the news?”

“Not yet.”

“Don’t you have the habit of reading the news?!” The other party seemed to be displeased with her.

‘Miss, I was about to read the news!’

Jeanne was helpless. “What’s the breaking news?”

“The wedding yesterday!”

Jeanne could also imagine how the media would blow up the Swans’ wedding.

“The news of Fourth Master Swan kissing you at the wedding,” Monica added.

Jeanne’s hand paused for a moment.

“It’s all about you and Fourth Master Swan having an ambiguous relationship. You’ve taken the top spot on all the major news rankings, and your popularity has skyrocketed!” Monica said exaggeratedly. In the end, she did not forget to conclude, “Sister, you’re famous.”

“...”

“Tell me honestly. Are you really having an affair with Fourth Master Swan?”

“No.” Jeanne denied it.

“No? Why does Fourth Master Swan treat you so differently then?”

“He’s probably crazy.”

“You’re the one who’s crazy!” Monica was agitated, “Something must be wrong with your brain for you to not want such a good man! Fourth Master Swan has everything! His face, chest, waist, butt, and long legs! If he’s with me, I’ll slap myself in the face even if we argue!”

“If you have nothing else to say, I’ll hang up.” Jeanne did not seem to want to say anything more.

“You always act like this when we talk about Fourth Master Swan.” Monica was displeased.

“I just don’t want to be misunderstood.”

“I don’t understand. What’s wrong with Fourth Master Swan?” Monica muttered, “Wouldn’t it feel good to have Eden call you Fourth Aunt in the future? Wouldn’t it feel good to have Jasmine unable to raise her head in front of you anymore?”

“It would, but he’s out of my league.” Jeanne gave her affirmation.

“There’s no such thing as being poor or lowly in love. It’s whether you love that person or not.”

Jeanne used to be so innocent too. She said, “I’m really going to hang up now.”

Monica called out to her, “Wait, my dad said that he hasn’t seen you for a long time. He wants you to come over for lunch today.”

Speaking of which, Monica’s father, Gary, had a heart attack a few years ago and rarely attended various events. It was Monica who represented her father everywhere. Thinking of this, Jeanne should have taken the initiative to visit Monica’s parents a long time ago.

When her mother passed away back then, they treated her like their daughter.

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed right away.

“Do you need me to pick you up?”

“No, I’ll take a taxi.”

“Hey, let me help you buy a car. You won’t be used to taking a taxi all the time,” Monica said generously.

“That’s not necessary. I don’t want to drive.”

“Are you being polite to me?” Monica was displeased.

“...” Jeanne really did not want to drive.

“You’re penniless now. Why can’t I, your best sister, help you out a little?!” Monica was indignant.

Jeanne was not penniless.

In fact, she had quite a lot of money.

“Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’ll go buy you a car now and drive it over. Wait for me.”

As soon as Monica finished, she hung up.

Jeanne sometimes admired Monica’s ferocity. She felt like Monica could never run out of energy no matter how hard she tried.

Soon, Jeanne got up from the toilet, washed up, and walked out of the bathroom.

She said to George, “Clean up. We’ll go to your godmother’s house for lunch in a while.”

“Okay.”George nodded obediently.

About two hours later, Jeanne received a call from Monica.

She brought George out.

“Where are you going?” In the hall, Alexander opened his mouth and asked in a very bad tone.

Jeanne did not even turn her head. “To Monica’s house.”

She held George’s hand and walked out of the Lawrences family’s manor.

At the door, a flashy red sports car was parked.

Monica leaned against the sports car with a smug look on her face. “How is it?”

“Beautiful,” Jeanne complimented.

“I knew you’d like it. Come, let’s try it out.” Monica handed the keys to Jeanne and opened the car door herself. She sat in the front passenger seat.

George sat obediently in the back seat.

Jeanne sat in the driver’s seat.

“Don’t be afraid, I’ll watch you from the side,” Monica said kindly.

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

She thought that Monica should look into what a super driver’s license was.

With that, Jeanne gently stepped on the accelerator and drove out.

Along the way, Monica was very enthusiastic with her guidance. Jeanne also listened quietly.

They arrived at the Cardellini family’s villa.

Jeanne brought George and followed Monica into the main hall.

As soon as they entered, the smile on Jeanne’s face froze.

This was because she saw... Fourth Master Swan.

She saw him sitting on the sofa in the main hall with a dignified appearance.

Beside him was Finn.

Jeanne turned her head to look at Monica.

Monica’s eyes flickered.

She admitted that she was the one who called Fourth Master Swan.

Yes, she wanted to set them up.

“Jeannie, you’re here.” At this moment, a gentle female voice sounded in the hall.

Jeanne looked at the person in front of her and quickly smiled. “Auntie.”

“Why didn’t you come to visit me when you’re back? Have you forgotten about me?” Monica’s mother, Ruby, said somewhat angrily.

“No, I was just a little busy.”

“That’s just your excuse.”

“Auntie, it was my fault,” Jeanne admitted her mistake.

Ruby was not really angry. She hugged Jeanne, and at that moment, she noticed George.

She squatted down.

“Call Grandma,” Jeanne hurriedly said.

“Hello, Grandma,” George called out obediently and even bowed politely.

“Are you George? Come and let me take a look at you.” Ruby pulled George to her with a face full of affection.

George did not reject Ruby’s approach.

Ruby sized him up for a long time and asked, “Why are you short-sighted already? Can it be corrected?”

“I think so,” Jeanne answered half-heartedly and immediately changed the topic. “I heard from Monica that you made my favorite pork ribs.”

“I haven’t cooked them yet, but I’m about to do so.”

“I’ll do it with you...”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they went to the kitchen.

Monica expressed that she was very hurt.

Every time Jeanne came to her house, she had the feeling that Jeanne was her parents’ biological daughter instead.

‘Was I adopted?!’
