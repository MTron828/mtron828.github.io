Chapter 570: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“In that case, I’ll see you in the afternoon. Also, bring Edward with you. Now that you both are married, it’s only natural for you both to come back together.”

“I’ll ask him.”

Jonathan acknowledged her, and Jeanne said goodbye.

After Jonathan hung up the call, Jeanne put down her phone.

Jonathan was treating her so differently now. Of course, he did not do it to make up for her, nor was he even trying to put her in an important position. All he wanted was to use her even from the very beginning. He probably did not expect her to be so outstanding, so he naturally did not have to put too much effort into pleasing her. However, now that he suddenly realized that her capabilities were beyond their imagination, he began his attack.

Jonathan had planned everything well.

It even made her wonder if her mother had been deceived by Jonathan the same way in the past.

Otherwise, with how capable her mother was… At least from what Kingsley told her, her mother would not have been easily schemed against.

Moreover, her mother’s car accident that year was unexpected.

An evil smile appeared on her lips.

The day Jonathan died in the hands of his son, he would know how karma would bite him back in the *ss!

She finished her cappuccino, and the sweet taste in her mouth suddenly turned bitter.

After all, if she never took revenge, she could never get a taste of sweetness!

She quietly regulated her emotions and eventually made a call.

“Jeannie, do you miss me?” Edward’s charming voice made every word he said sound lustful.

She said, “Oh, I wouldn’t dare.”

“Hm?” The voice from the other end of the phone gave her goosebumps all over.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and had a feeling that she had to face the flirtatious Fourth Master Swan head-on.

She said, “I’m afraid if I miss you too much, I won’t be able to get out of bed.”

The other side seemed stunned for two seconds before he laughed out loud.

It sounded like a laugh that he could not control, and it made Jeanne a little awkward.

“Stop laughing.” There was a coquettish tone in Jeanne’s voice.

Jeanne rarely acted coquettishly.

Except at certain times, when she could not control herself, she would hum a few times. In fact, she was not acting coquettishly. She probably just seemed and sounded like she was acting coquettishly when she was emotional. Once that happened, Edward would not be able to hold it in any longer.

At that moment, his heart melted, and he said, “I have a feeling that you’re hinting at something.”

“I’m not,” Jeanne retorted.

Her entire face was red from Edward’s words even though they were not talking about much.

“By the way, why are you suddenly taking the initiative to think of your husband? Is there something you want to tell me?” Edward changed the topic and became a little more serious.

Jeanne calmed her heartbeat and said, “Jonathan wants us to go to the Lawrences for dinner tonight.”

“Do pigs fly now?”

“After all, Jonathan wants to curry favor with me now.”

“You’re amazing, Jeannie. I can’t believe you’ve gotten Old Master Lawrence to take the bait so quickly,” Edward said calmly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She did not tell Edward much about her messing with the Lawrences, but he knew all her methods.

She felt some indescribable emotions in her heart.

In fact, she was quite worried that one day, Edward would discover everything.

That sentence, “Only you kill me, but I will never kill you,” was not so much an oath but a piece of advice to tell her that he would not kill her because... even if she did want to kill me, she could not kill him.

Jeanne had been thinking a lot about Edward’s words.

That was because Kingsley always reminded her that Edward was not a good person.

In fact, Kingsley was not either, so she also did not understand why Kingsley was so confident in saying other people were bad.

Jeanne remained silent.

However, Edward did not care. He said, “I can’t go back to the Lawrences tonight with you.”

Jeanne was instantly pulled back from her somewhat distracted thoughts.

“I have something to do. I’m on my way to the airport, and I’ll be away for about a week. I was going to tell you before boarding the plane,” Edward said nonchalantly.

Jeanne frowned. “Is it a business trip?”

“Not exactly,” Edward replied.

Jeanne pursed her lips and swallowed what she wanted to say. Instead, she asked, “A week?”

“At the earliest, five days.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

“If you want, we can video call. My phone will be on 24 hours a day.”

Jeanne was at a loss for words.

“I’m at the airport.” Edward did not think it was awkward that Jeanne did not reply.
