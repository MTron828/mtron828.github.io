Chapter 378: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

In the empty and dilapidated warehouse, a heart-wrenching cry suddenly sounded in the quiet and peaceful night.

Monica’s eyes were red as she looked at the bearded man in front of her. She looked at his ferocious appearance and watched his thick, dirty hands pull at her clothes.

Two people were holding her in place, so she could not struggle to break free from them.

Her entire body was trembling non-stop as she screamed, “Don’t touch me. Don’t touch me!”

The bearded man did not seem to have experienced such a thing before. People like him were usually paid to do things, and he would never do a sloppy job. He had never received such a mission before. Although it was strange… At that moment, he was inexplicably excited.

That was the first time he had enjoyed a man-woman relationship during a mission.

Looking at the weak little girl before him who looked like she could be crushed with a pinch, he became more excited.

He said, “Little girl, it’s not that I want to touch you, but this is my employer’s orders. If I don’t do it, I won’t be able to get my money. Not only will I not be able to get my money, but it will also affect my reputation in the business. It will be so bad that I might not even be able to get a job anymore!”

Monica could not hear anything other than her own heartbeat pounding in fear.

She thought the person in front of her looked terrifying. All she wanted was to leave, to go home, and return to her parent’s side.

She had never felt that way before since she was young. She had always thought that, except for the fact that her relationship journey was a little bumpy, her life was perfect.

Having been born into a well-off family, she never had to worry about food and clothing. Moreover, her parents were loving and doted on her.

She had never felt wronged before, except with Finn.

Yet now, she was going to suffer the embarrassment of her life.

She was still a virgin and had always fantasized about giving her first time to the person she loved the most, but now…

Her tears fell like crazy.

At that moment, she was so sad that she did not know how else to rid herself of those feelings.

She did not even know what would happen to her after tonight. What would become of her after tonight?

“Is it that miserable?” The bearded man looked at Monica, who looked like she was going to cry herself to death in front of him, and his face turned a little ugly, “Do you have to cry like this because you’re going to have sex with me? I may look uncouth, but I’m very gentle in bed...”

After that, the bearded man’s hand was all over Monica’s body.

“Ah!” the man suddenly cried out in a low voice.

Monica had bit the man’s hand down hard with all her strength.

Since she was held by two men and could not move at all, she only had her mouth to fight back.

However, her resistance attracted the bearded man’s anger. He pinched Monica’s mouth hard, forcing her to let go of him.

Then, the bearded man looked at the bloody marks on the back of his hand. His ferocious appearance made him look hideous.

Clap!” A slap landed on Monica’s face.

Her stained face instantly became red and swollen.

As she was caught off guard, she accidentally bit the corner of her lip, and it was stained with blood.

The bearded man cursed, “B*tch, follow my orders or face the consequences. I tried to persuade you nicely, but I can’t believe you bit me on the hand. In that case, don’t blame me for being rude to you!”

Monica looked at the man in front of her with a terrified expression.

Even though the slap just now had left her blank for half a second, the pain on her face was nothing.

Right now, all she wanted was to escape from that place, for she refused to give her virginity to such a man.

No… She refused.

“Put her on the ground for me,” the bearded man ordered.

With that, the two men carrying Monica threw her down roughly.

Monica could feel the pain traveling all over her body, but at that moment, it could not compare to the terror was feeling inside.

The moment she fell to the ground and regained her freedom, she pushed herself up from the ground and wanted to run without a second thought. However, just as she got up, someone grabbed her leg.

The next second, the person pulled her leg, and Monica fell down to the ground, screaming, “Ah!”

Her ankle, which was already fractured and felt alright even after the car accident, was made worse by the fall.

She could not help but scream.

The unbearable pain made her want to die right there and then.

However, someone then pulled her ankle violently and dragged her across the floor.
