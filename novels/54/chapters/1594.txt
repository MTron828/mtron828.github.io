Chapter 1595: Bachelor Night, Nox Loses Control

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly wanted nothing to do with the Winters or Nox. Even if the whole world was spreading the news of Nox’s wedding tomorrow, it had nothing to do with her. Her main focus now was to prepare for Bella’s surgery, which was scheduled for tomorrow. Coincidentally, it was on the day of Nox’s wedding.

In other words, Nox was getting married tomorrow, and it was known as the wedding of the century. After all, wedding ceremonies in Harken of equal scale and status were rare. Everyone was looking forward to what kind of grand wedding the Winters and Nicholsons would hold.

It was bachelor’s night, and Nox was very drunk. After all, he was getting married tomorrow, so he had to indulge himself tonight. Only Edward, Jeanne, Finn, and Monica had come.

Since Monica was pregnant, she could not drink but was very tempted. However, all she could do was watch Nox jump up and down in the room like a monkey, looking extremely excited.

Monica could not help but pull Jeanne aside and say, “Why does it seem to me that Nox is asking for a beating?”

“You can be even more dramatic when you get married,” Jeanne suggested seriously. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Do you think I’m jealous of Nox’s marriage? I’m not jealous. I just can’t bear to see him so excited. When I think of Shelly, whom he once abandoned… To be honest, I think Nox can really be heartless sometimes.” Monica suddenly stood up for Shelly.

Jeanne, on the other hand, remained calm about it. “You can take a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink. Nox doesn’t like Shelly, and forcing them toqether won’t make them happy. Moreover… Shelly doesn’t like Nox

either.”

“Why do you think Shelly doesn’t like Nox? After so many years, how could she not like him?” Monica believed that Shelly still had feelings for Nox. Although she remembered Shelly voicing her dislike for Nox, if she really did not like him, she would not have stayed by Nox’s side for so many years without any regrets!

“If he likes her, Shelly’s daughter might be Nox’s.” Jeanne made it clear. “Of course, this is only one of the reasons. Also, Shelly gives me the feeling that she really doesn’t like Nox, and it’s understandable because Nox was such a playboy at that time. Shelly must have witnessed all his bad deeds and probably hasn’t had a good impression of him since the start. Later, Nox desperately wanted to break up with Shelly so that he could be with Zoe, and after being with Zoe, he became a good man. Any other woman would feel hurt, let alone have feelings for Nox. In short, I think Shelly is someone with a

discerning eye. She won’t let herself fall in love with someone like Nox.”

Monica felt that Jeanne was very convincing, so she agreed with Jeanne’s point of view. Fortunately, Shelly did not like Nox. If she did, her heart would probably be broken.

“By the way, who do you think Shelly’s child is? I’ve always wondered if it was Nox’s. I refuse to believe that Nox didn’t do anything to Shelly when he lived alone with her. I don’t trust Nox,” Monica asked nosily.

“It doesn’t seem like Nox’s,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Does that mean Shelly cheated on Nox? With Shelly’s daughter’s age, Nox should still be with Shelly at that time?”

“That’s hard to say.” Jeanne was not a god, so she could not predict everything accurately.

Moreover, she had been separated from society for a long time. From the moment she gave birth to Paige to the moment she returned to South Hampton City, she knew nothing of what happened.

Jeanne then thought for a moment and said, “Based on Shelly’s personality, she probably wouldn’t do anything to let Nox down while she was in a relationship with him. She’s not as bad as Nox.”

“That’s why I think Shelly’s daughter is Nox’s.” Monica was certain. At that moment, she cursed, “Nox, that damned b*stard. If that daughter, whom Shelly is raising alone, is really Nox’s, and he’s so heartless as to marry another woman, I will curse him!”

Jeanne smiled.

Monica was still that woman who abhorred evil. However, feelings were not absolute. If both parties did not like each other, they would never be together..
