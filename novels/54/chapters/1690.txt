Chapter 1691: Shelly and Nox Back Together

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Nox opened his eyes, he did not know what day it was, but it felt like he had slept for a century. He was so tired that he had no strength at all, as if he was paralyzed on that bed.

“Are you awake?” A familiar female voice suddenly sounded beside him.

Shocked, Nox turned around and saw Shelly sitting beside him. She probably called him because she saw that he was awake and did not mean to startle him.

Nox stared at Shelly blankly for a few seconds. Then, he remembered what he had done before he fell asleep — he had gone to help Shelly to find her daughter.

It took him seven days to search through the entire Harken, and finally, he found Bella at the hands of a criminal gang. That criminal gang sent all the children to poor African regions and gave them to some local tribal leaders. Once the children grew up, they would become the women of those tribe leaders. As the tribe leaders liked Asian blood, the children would eventually carry on the family line.

Fortunately, Nox managed to find the gang in time and exterminate them. They also rescued all the children who had been abducted. At the same time, he got Edward to send officials to the tribe to rescue the children who had been abducted.

Once everything else was handed over to Edward, he brought Bella back. However, when he came back, he was so exhausted that he passed out in before Shelly. Then, he fell asleep.

“You’ve slept for a day and a night. If you’re awake, get up.” Shelly said, “Get up and eat something.”

Nox was so hungry that his face was pale.

He said in a hoarse voice, “Alright.”

Shelly nodded and said, “You can take your time to get up. I’ll go make you something to eat.”

“Alright.” Then, Nox said, “Can I take a shower?

“Sure, but I’m afraid you’ll faint if you haven’t had anything to eat.” Shelly reminded him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t worry. I’m strong.”

Shelly knew that Nox did not want to be belittled, so she did not stop him. “I’ll run the bath for you.”

Then, she went to the bathroom to fill up the bathtub and left after she was done.

As Nox watched Shelly leave, he wondered whether she was an illusion because Shelly did not seem to reject him anymore. Although she was not too friendly, it was obvious that she accepted his existence.

He suddenly remembered Shelly saying that as long as he found Bella, she would be with him again. The thought of that made him inexplicably excited.

With that, he got out of bed groggy and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. Having not showered for a week, he was so disgusted that he kept cleaning himself, over and over again, until… he was getting a little dizzy.

He quickly leaned against the wall and tried to open the bathroom door to get some fresh air. However, he then cursed at how lousy the bathroom was as it did not have any form of ventilation.

He was trying so hard not to faint because, if he did, Shelly would laugh at him. Hence, he flung open the bathroom door, but as soon as he opened it, he lost his balance.

Coincidentally, Shelly was going in to remind Nox not to take too long and happened to see Nox’s naked body. Worst of all, that man was about to fall.

Afraid that he would fall flat on his face, Shelly quickly went forward to support him. If he fell, she would not be able to escape responsibility.

Once she held him, Nox was so dizzy that he had to put all his weight on Shelly, pressing her directly onto the floor.

“Ah!” Shelly called out.

She fell to the ground with Nox’s weight on her, and it hurt a lot. For a second, Shelly thought she was going to fall to her death. However, the naked body on top of her was motionless.

It took Shelly a long time to calm herself down and push Nox away. “Are you okay?”

Nox, who was pressed on top of Shelly, was very much conscious. In fact, he really enjoyed being on top of Shelly. When he buried his head in Shelly’s soft hair, his nose was filled with her scent.

“Nox,” Shelly called his name again.

Technically, he did not fall, so Shelly twisted her body, trying to get away from Nox. However, the more she twisted, the tenser a certain someone’s body became.

“Shelly, if you move again, I wont be able to control myself!” Nox suddenly said fiercely..
