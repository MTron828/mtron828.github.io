907 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

After Chester finished bowing, he stood up straight and said to everyone, “We received news that a spy was among the guests of the wedding banquet and had been sent to assassinate my father. My father had originally planned to attend Michael’s wedding banquet but turned back halfway. He did not want to disturb the guests and decided to secretly investigate this person. However, he was too cunning and brushed past us several times. Thus, we had no choice but to treat everyone this way.”

Though it was impossible for everyone to calm down just by Chester’s few words. Naturally, Chester was well aware of this as well. He added, “Of course, I know many of you here are not the spy. However, for the sake of fairness, we investigated everyone. The purpose was to avoid wrongfully suspecting anyone and causing greater harm to that person. Hence, we chose to do it in a fair and just manner. I didn’t think such a move would cause such a large amount of disgust on the scene. I apologize to everyone.”

It was another sincere apology, and it made everyone at the scene more at ease. After all, Chester was a member of the Sanders, and Harken was still under their rule. Chester’s status could also be said to be the most respected among these people. However, he apologized to everyone time and time again. No matter how impressive one’s status was, under Chester’s humble attitude, they would not dare to be rash again.

The result of their impetuousness confirmed that they had not taken the Sanders seriously, and no one present could afford to bear such a crime.

When Chester saw that everyone in the hall had calmed down, he did not immediately order his men to continue searching. Instead, he waved his hand and gestured for a guard to approach him. He said, “It was the Sanders’ fault for not handling the matter properly. It was supposed to be a fair and just method, but the Sanders were excluded from the search. Now, the Sanders will undergo the same inspection as everyone else. Guards, please do a corresponding check on the Sanders first!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The guards saluted Chester respectfully before stepping forward. In front of all the guests, they conducted a full body search on Chester. At the same time, they also conducted a full body search on the rest of the Sanders.

Since the Sanders had taken the lead in allowing themselves to be inspected, if the others continued to cause trouble, they would really be thinking too highly of themselves.

It had to be said that the Sanders’ actions had effectively resolved the stalemate in the wedding banquet hall and had saved their reputation.

Nox and Edward looked at each other, the two of them waiting silently.

After the Sanders were searched and their hair was cut off to confirm their identity through DNA, the guards began to carry out the investigation work that had not been successful just now. Because of the Sanders’ leading role, all the guests no longer rejected the examination.

The guard that was facing Finn was still in a deadlock with him. It was not until another guard walked over and said something in his ear that the guard left Finn’s side and began the next search.

Finn secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

The Sanders knew that everyone was in a bad mood. If they insisted on taking him away, it would definitely cause even greater chaos. The Sanders would not be able to hold their ground, and all they had done just now would be for naught. So, they could only let Finn go temporarily.

Finn could not help but glance at Edward and Nox, who were not far away. If this continued, Alex would be discovered very soon.

Edward and Nox also seemed to have received Finn’s gaze, but the they hid their emotions so well that even Jeanne could not tell either. Her attention had been on the three of them since the beginning.

In fact, most of the attention of the Hills and the Sanders had been on the three of them. They hoped to get information from them, but the three of them had revealed nothing. They did not look anywhere else. Therefore, it was impossible to tell who the descendant of the Duncans was.

In the quiet wedding venue, everything was proceeding in an orderly manner.
