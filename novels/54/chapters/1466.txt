Chapter 1467: Nox and Shelly’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She treated him the way she usually would, and he actually could not stand it.

Did Shelly not want to marry him?! Now that she could not get married, was she not going to react? Did she feel ashamed?

Shelly was not that thin-skinned. However, Nox was not the kind of person who would care about someone he did not care about. Since Shelly felt ashamed, he did not need to waste time on her.

Later, Nox’s legs were recovering well as the days went by. Soon, he could stand up and walk on his own.

Anyway, Nox was having his own fun for a long time, and he drifted further and further away from Shelly. After all, his leg had recovered, so he did not need Shelly to help him with anything.

During that time, Shelly was also busy preparing for the college entrance examination. Although the two of them lived under the same roof, it was rare for them to meet.

When he had cut Shelly off, he fell in love with Zoe at first sight and decided to be with her. At that time, Shelly was still preparing for her college entrance examination.

Two days before the college entrance examination, the school was on holiday, so all the students were allowed to go home and relax for two days before preparing for the exam.

That day, Nox waited for Shelly at home.

He said, “Shelly, my one-year agreement with my family is almost over. After your college entrance examination, move out of my place.”

Shelly looked at him but did not agree.

Nox, who had never been patient with Shelly, said, “Why? Do you still think we can be together? Yes, we slept together, and I admit that, but I’ve slept with too many women. Do I have to be responsible for every one of them?!”

“Am I the same as all the women you’ve slept with?” “Do you think you’re superior?!”

“I didn’t sell my body to you,” Shelly said bluntly.

She knew that all of Nox’s women were bought with money.

“Why? Do you want money?” Nox asked her.

In fact, he knew that Shelly wanted to marry him for money. Otherwise, any woman with such little self-esteem would have given up long ago after he rejected her.

“That’s not what I meant.” Shelly shook her head.

Nox sneered. He could not help but be surprised by Shelly’s coldness.

“I’m just telling you that I’m a little different from your other women,” Shelly murmured. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It was as if she was saying it to herself, and Nox naturally did not take it to heart.

Shelly continued, “Do you like Zoe?”

Nox frowned.

How did she know? He had not announced it to the public yet. Did she follow him? Or did she peek at his phone?!

“Your mother told me.” Shelly did not need to think to know how Nox was maliciously speculating about how she knew.

That morning, Nox’s mother called her and told her about it. However, it was not to make her sad. It was to tell her that Nox really had someone he liked and that she should be prepared so that she would not be sad.

Actually, what else could she be sad about? Ever since Nox brought back the photo of her kissing another boy and showed it to his family, she had nothing to be sad about.

With Nox, she finally understood what it meant to have a cold, dead heart. Of course, she did not love Nox that much, but she was still hurt by his actions.

“You said you like her and want to marry her?” Shelly asked.

“Yes,” Nox admitted. “When I saw her, I thought she was the best candidate to be my wife. When I saw her, I even thought of a name for our child.” “I’ve already thought of the child’s name.” Shelly smiled faintly.

It was just a facial expression and did not mean anything.

“So, after the college entrance examination, you can move out of here. I’ve told my parents and grandfather that you can go back to the Winters’ residence. Other than you not marrying me, your life in the Winters will be the same as before.”

“Don’t I disgust you?” Shelly asked her.

Was he not unhappy that she would be living with the Winters?!

“Of course, but I can’t chase you away! If I do this, my grandfather will beat me to death!” Nox spoke bluntly.

“I’ll leave by myself,” Shelly suddenly said.

Nox looked straight at Shelly and thought she was joking with him.

Did she say she would leave by herself? Leave the Winters? Did she know that a woman from the countryside like her would never be able to enjoy the glory and wealth of the Winters once she left the family?
