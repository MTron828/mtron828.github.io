Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Katie nodded silently, and Shelly brought Bella into the bathroom.

The moment they walked in, Bella cried out, “It stinks…”

She was so disgusted that she covered her nose.

Shelly quickly flushed the toilet. It was Katie who did not flush the toilet, and the entire bathroom was also covered in water. Hence, Shelly gave the bathroom a little cleaning before giving Bella a bath. Bella said to Shelly, “Mommy, I don’t like that person outside.” Shelly’s hand, which was washing Bella’s hair, paused.

Then, she smiled and said gently, “I know. She will leave tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Bella smiled brilliantly.

She was happy because she thought that she would not have to see anyone out there tomorrow.

Shelly patted Bella’s head. The way she saw it, she had raised Bella for so long that she had never thought of giving Bella to anyone.

She quickly gave Bella and herself a bath before bringing Bella straight to her room to sleep. She deliberately kept Bella away from Katie so that they would not have any contact. Since Katie was cruel enough to leave Bella behind back then, she had no right to take Bella away now.

After coaxing Bella to sleep, Shelly walked out of the room. Naturally, Katie was still in the living room.

Shelly glanced at the dining room and then at the kitchen. When she walked in, she saw that the bowls were washed but had water stains. On top of that, the kitchen counter was covered in water. Therefore, she washed the bowls again and dried them before wiping the counter clean.

Katie looked at Shelly and said after a while, “Shelly, you’re so particular.” In her hometown, they did not care about the water stains. She just had to Shelly, on the other hand, did not respond to Katie’s comment.

After she was done with the kitchen, she walked to the sofa in the living room and sat down with Katie. She said, “Katie, you should leave tomorrow morning. ”

Katie was a little hurt, but Shelly would not be soft-hearted.

“Shelly, I know that you’re prejudiced against me and that it was my fault for leaving Bella for you. But at the end of the day, Bella is my child, and I want to take her back.” Katie said uncomfortably, “All these years, the thought of Bella has been keeping me up every night, and I haven’t been able to sleep well.”

“Since you think about her every night and can’t get a good night’s sleep, why didn’t you come and visit Bella earlier?” Shelly mocked.

“I know you look down on me and think that I have no dignity, but the truth is that I couldn’t afford to raise Bella back then. Because of Bella’s disability, I didn’t dare to take her back and be laughed at.” As Katie spoke, tears flowed out of her eyes, and she looked like she felt bad for what she did.

“So now that Bella’s ears have finally been healed, you want to take her away?

Katie, you can’t be so selfish!”

“I didn’t come to take her away because her ears had been healed. In fact, I

didn’t know her ears had been healed. It’s just that our hometown is being renovated into a new village, with our land and houses have been expropriated, our family has moved from the countryside to the town. We’ve also received some money from expropriating the house, so our conditions are much better now, and I’d like to take Bella back. We can finally support and raise her ourselves,” Katie quickly explained.

“Forget it. You have three children at home. If you take Bella back with you, you won’t be able to take care of her.” Shelly said bluntly, “I won’t let you take Bella away.”

“Shelly…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“There’s nothing much for you to say.” Shelly was very determined. “Leave tomorrow morning and don’t come looking for me again. I will take good care of Bella. When she grows up, I will tell her about her biological parents. If she’s willing to go back and acknowledge you, I will not object to that. But before that, you can’t take her away!”

Katie still had something to say, but Shelly had already stood up and returned to her room. Her attitude was firm. There was no room for discussion regarding Bella.

Shelly got up the next morning. When she opened the bedroom door, she saw Katie already making breakfast in the kitchen.

Shelly hurried over to see that Katie had made a mess in the kitchen. Despite that, she held it in and did not say anything.

Katie said enthusiastically, “Shelly, I’ll cook for you and leave after breakfast.”

Shelly looked at Katie and nodded.

“I’ve made scrambled eggs. Wait for me on the sofa.”

Shelly turned around and walked straight into the bedroom, where Bella was still sleeping.

Although she did not want Katie to take Bella away, she was not as cruel as to make keep them away from each other..
