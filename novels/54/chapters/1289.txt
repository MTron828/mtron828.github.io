1290 Edward and Candice’s First Date

Monica sat in the office. It was difficult for her to get to work today.

She suddenly remembered what Finn said earlier.

He said that he wanted a child.

She had never heard him mention anything about a child. She thought he felt the same as she did and had never thought about it.

After all, during the three years they were married, even if they were on good terms, Finn did not bring up having children. She had always been the one taking the initiative on this, so she thought that he might not be too enthusiastic about this matter.

Monica scratched her head. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She seemed to be a little uneasy recently with a little frustration in doing many things and could not muster any energy.

There was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

Tim walked in respectfully. “The marketing director’s interview will begin soon.”

“Mm.” Monica nodded.

She then remembered that the company had a vacancy to fill for a senior position in the company.

She stood up from her seat and followed her secretary into the interview session.

Only a few from the top management could attend.

Monica sat in the middle and looked at the resume in hand and chose one out of three.

She was very calm.

The first applicant to walk in was forty-six years old. He was experienced in his work and spoke steadily.

The second applicant who walked in was thirty-seven years old. He had a certain amount of work experience and an astonishing degree.

The third applicant who walked in was twenty-eight years old.

No doubt, he was only twenty-eight.

Monica even checked to see if she had seen it wrongly.

The marketing director could be considered as one of the middle and upper management of Cardellini Pharmaceutical. Monica was really surprised by the fact that the applicant was younger than her. How did they choose him from the previous rounds of screening?

She looked up and saw the young man sitting in front of them.

He looked a little familiar as if she had seen him somewhere before. However, after thinking about it carefully, nothing came to mind.

Monica quietly listened to his self-introduction.

He was eloquent and had a good educational background. He had graduated from an overseas pharmaceutical company and had once been a sales manager in a first-class pharmaceutical company overseas. When he was promoted to sales director, he chose to return to his home country to develop. His ability was outstanding. No wonder he could reach such a high at such a young age.

For a second, Monica was also attracted by his speech and forgot what the two applicants before him had said.

“Mr. Hayes, why did you choose to return home to develop your career? According to the current foreign economic market, foreign development opportunities and potential are greater. Why did you choose to return at the peak of your career?” Steve asked.

Brandon Hayes replied with ease, “Previously, I was overseas because my entire family had emigrated there. Now that I’m back, I’ve also returned to South Hampton with my family. As the saying goes, there’s no place like home. Back then, my family had no choice but to leave the country because of some necessities in their career. Now that everything is stable, they naturally want to come back.”

“So Mr. Hayes returned because of his family.”

“On another hand, it’s because of the promise I made with a young lady when I was young,” Brandon said as he glanced at Monica.

Monica looked at him.

She felt that the person in front of her was a little strange.

“Someone you have a crush on?” Steve suddenly asked.

They actually started gossiping right then and there

Brandon at this moment seemed to reveal a hint of shyness that matched his age.

Throughout the entire interview process till now, he was so calm and mature that it was impossible to tell that he was only twenty-eight years old.

Of course, he was still young and handsome. However, he was very experienced in speaking and handling matters. He did not seem unfamiliar at all.

“Not really. She already has a boyfriend.” Brandon smiled. “I’m just keeping a promise.”

Frankly, no one took it for real. Only sometimes, there would be some small talk during the interview made to impress the interviewers.

Perhaps Brandon’s words were just to make them think that he was a man of his word.

When applying for a job in the workplace, apart from ability, one would also choose a suitable personality for it.

“Is there anything else the other interviewers want to ask?” Steve asked the others.

Nobody said anything.

“Chairman,” Steve called out to Monica.

It could be seen that Steve admired Brandon very much. It was obvious that he was paying a lot of attention to him.

In fact, Monica’s impression of Brandon was not bad either. The candidates had the same ability but a twenty-eight-year-old naturally had more potential.
