924 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

Lucy’s expression was clearly a little ugly.

“Are you willing to be played to death by Melinda?” Jeanne asked.

“So you think I should resist?”

“What you did on the plane just now was not resist Melinda but provoke Kingsley on purpose. You were being emotional. While I don’t want you to fall in love with Kingsley, because there won’t be any results, I don’t want you to give up on yourself, either. If you remove the emotional component, you can make your life in the Hills better,” Jeanne said bluntly. “Why won’t you let yourself live a better life? Is it because you like him?”

Lucy did not refute.

“Is it because you realized that you’ve fallen in love, so you started to distance yourself from Kingsley?”

Lucy still chose to remain silent.

“There’s no need for that,” Jeanne said. “Other than Kingsley, you can’t love like an ordinary person. Why are you making your life so difficult for yourself?”

Lucy looked at Jeanne. She seemed to have been convinced by her.

“Think about it,” Jeanne said.

In any case, she was only suggesting, and whether or not Lucy would listen was her choice. She would not force Lucy. Even though she hoped Lucy would return to Kingsley’s side, she would respect her decision, regardless.

Lucy did not answer Jeanne immediately. Perhaps she was hesitant. After all, Kingsley was indeed not a good person. If she wanted to stay by his side and be magnanimous, she needed to be mentally prepared.

Jeanne did not make things difficult for Lucy and immediately changed the topic. “Do you want me to help you deal with the burn wounds on your body?”

Lucy had accompanied her into the banquet hall during the fire. As she was clearing the way for Jeanne, the burns on her body were more serious.

Lucy came back to her senses. She said, “It’s not serious.”

For an assassin, a wound like that was nothing. If it was serious, she could only bear it. Even though everyone saw that Lucy had many burns on her body, none of the assassins really cared. Death was just a word.

“Lie down,” Jeanne said. It might be nothing to Lucy, but to her, it was a part of their friendship, and she wanted to return the favor.

Lucy looked at Jeanne and asked, “Aren’t you going to blame me?”

“For what?”

“I shot Fourth Master Swan behind your back,” Lucy exposed. “Melinda wasn’t lying.”

“I was unhappy for a second,” Jeanne admitted. Lucy was well aware of her relationship with Edward, and she thought she could trust Lucy completely. However, once she thought it through, she realized.

“Was it an order from Kingsley?” She asked.

Lucy nodded. “He knew very well that you wouldn’t be able to go through with it.”

“That’s why I didn’t blame you. Even Kingsley has no reason to blame me. Everything Kingsley did was for my sake. He was afraid that if I didn’t kill Edward, Edward would kill me!” Jeanne said calmly. She had known about this for a while and was not too emotional.

Lucy nodded and did not say anything else.

“Furthermore, if you really wanted to kill Edward, you would not have hurt his thigh,” Jeanne laughed. “It was just to report to Kingsley, right?”

“Yeah.”

“So what can I complain about?”

Lucy did not say anything else. Assassins rarely stirred up emotions. It was not just unspoken. Some feelings were indeed much weaker than the average person.

“I’ll help you treat your wound,” Jeanne said.

“No need. Let the doctor handle it.”

“You don’t trust me?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“It’s not that. The wound will leave a mark, and I want to get rid of it.” Lucy kept talking.

“I thought you didn’t care about the scars on your body anymore. Last time I saw, you had a lot of scars on your body,” Jeanne teased.

“I’ll follow your suggestion,” Lucy suddenly said.

Jeanne was surprised for a second.

“I can’t let that little b*tch Melinda play with me until I’m dead.” The corners of Lucy’s mouth lifted slightly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Every time Lucy laughed, it was full of charm. As a thirty-two-year-old woman, she knew what a man wanted better than a woman in her twenties, especially in bed!

“I can’t wait to see what you do.” Jeanne’s face was full of anticipation. “I’ll call the doctor for you, then.”

“Thank you,” she said.

Jeanne left the room, asking the servant to get the doctor before returning to her room.
