Chapter 1550: Monica Gives In to Finn (They Make Up)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After all, since the Leader had spoken, she did not dare to talk back.

The bad impression she had of Fourth Master Swan was because he was a half-hearted sc*mbag. However, now that she knew everything, not only did she not have a bad impression of him, but she was also impressed.

On second thought, perhaps Fourth Master Swan had done so much and even became the Leader all for Jeanne. How could other people’s love be so great?

Monica watched as Edward carried Jeanne into the car. Jeanne’s blissful smile in Edward’s embrace was not faked.

She watched emotionally as their car left in a convoy.

“Monica, I’ll send you home,” Finn said.

Monica turned to look at him.

“Your chauffeur has gone back. I’ll send you home,” Finn said again.

Monica pursed her lips. This time, she did not refuse. Instead, she took the initiative and walked toward the backseat of Finn’s car.

Finn heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Monica would reject him, but he was even more afraid that Monica would ask Brandon to pick her up.

Then, he returned to the driver’s seat and still drove at the speed of a turtle. However, Monica was used to his speed, so she just stared out the window at the flashing neon lights.

Sometimes, it felt like time passed really quickly. When she met Finn, she was 19 years old. Now, she was 29 years old. It had been a whole ten years, and she had experienced so much in the past ten years. Now that she thought about it, she found it pretty unbelievable.

In the quiet car, Monica changed the topic. “You knew Candice was Jeanne, didn’t you?”

Finn’s grip on the steering wheel tightened as he nodded. “Yes.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Monica asked. She was still a little angry about it

“Fourth Master forbade anyone to know.”

“To you guys, I’m not trustworthy enough, am I?”

“No, it was just that the more people knew about it, the more dangerous it was. Back when Fourth Master seized power from Alex, many people were involved. So, the less you knew, the safer you were, ” Finn explained.

Monica remained silent, not knowing whether to accept his explanation or not.

Finn said, “Actually, I’ve hinted at you before.”

Monica turned to look at him.

“I told you to spend more time with Candice. You’ll like her.”

“Finn, you think too highly of me! Didn’t you think I would think you were brainwashing me just so that I could please Fourth Master Swan?”

Finn was speechless.

“Forget it.” Monica did not seem to want to argue about it anymore. “It’s good that Jeanne is still alive.”

Since Jeanne was still alive, she no longer bore any hatred toward him. Finn did not say anything else. After all, he was not in the right in the matter, and it was all his fault.

As the car drove steadily on the street, silence filled the car again. It was very quiet.

“Monica.” Finn took the initiative to speak, just when Monica thought that he would not speak again.

“Can we start over?” Finn asked carefully and even a little fearfully.

Monica pursed her lips. She could not deny that Jeanne had always had a big influence on her. A few words from Jeanne could change her opinion on something and her so-called persistence. She said, “Give me some time to think about it.”

Finn’s entire body tensed up.

He had thought of the worst possible answer, which was no, and the best-case scenario, which was also no. However, he had never expected Monica to say she would think about it.

Did it mean that she would consider starting over with him? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He was beyond excited, but he was trying hard to suppress it.

“Drive seriously.” Monica seemed to have noticed Finn’s reaction and quickly reminded him.

At that moment, the cars were all taking the S route. Although it was late, there was quite a lot of traffic on the streets, so Finn’s behavior was very dangerous.

Only then did Finn realize that he was indeed a little unsettled. He quickly took a deep breath to calm himself down before saying, “I’ll wait for you for as long as you want.”

Monica did not answer because she was really conflicted. She had never been carefree toward Finn before.

When the car arrived at the entrance of Monica’s residential area, Finn quickly got out of the car, opened the door for Monica, and held her hand as she got out.

The two of them held hands, and Monica did not shake him off this time.

“You can go back now,” Monica said.

Finn nodded..
