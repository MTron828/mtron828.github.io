1074 Going To Court: Brie Appears and Exposes Michael

“??Who said Monica has no evidence?” Nox’s voice shocked everyone.

At that moment, Monica could not help but turn to look at Nox. As Nox did not tell her anything, she had no idea what he was talking about.

Nox stood up from the audience.

He shouted at the judge in the courtroom, “If Brie appears in court to testify against Michael, does that mean we have evidence?!”

The judge’s face was serious. “At present, the police told us that Brie would not appear in court.”

“I’m asking you that if Brie appears in court, will Your Honor continue to judge Monica’s case against Michael? I didn’t ask if Brie will appear in court. I hope that you can answer the question, Your Honor.” Nox was clearly a little aggressive.

The judge’s expression was grim. He said, “The courtroom is a solemn place. Unrelated people are not allowed to affect the order of the trial. At present, all the evidence that the court has received is only a trial for Brie, Daniel, and the other defendant present. If there is no concrete evidence to prove that this matter is related to other people, the court will not accept this case.”

“Your Honor, are you sure that we don’t have any concrete evidence?”

“Based on all the information that the court has received so far, there isn’t any evidence,” the judge answered with certainty.

“Your Honor, don’t you think you’ve been avoiding my question? I’ve been asking you if Brie’s appearance in court can be used as evidence for your case, but you’ve been saying you didn’t receive any evidence. Is it because you don’t understand what I’m saying, or are you trying to cover up for someone?” Nox questioned.

The judge’s face darkened. “As a judge, I represent the laws of Harken, so I will naturally accept all cases fairly. If you slander me, I will follow Harken’s criminal law, Chapter 23, Article 83–”

“I know you’re very familiar with the law, so you don’t have to recite any clauses to me. What I’m telling you now is that Monica has enough evidence to prove that this matter is related to Michael. Please accept her request!”

“There’s no evidence–”

“I have evidence!” At the entrance of the courtroom, a female voice suddenly sounded.

All the audience looked at the entrance of the courtroom.

That was when they saw Brie. It was rumored that she had fled the country, and there was no news of her.

Michael could no longer remain calm. He glared at Brie as he had never thought that she was still alive.

Brie was still alive and well, and she was even at the scene of the court.

No. That was impossible.

He had always done things flawlessly.

The last time he killed Eden, he had done it without anyone knowing. Now, no one even knew that Eden was dead, not even Eden’s family.

He had done it so seamlessly. How could there be any loopholes? How was it possible that Brie was still alive?

He did not believe that his men would lie to him.

It was absolutely impossible. Brie did not have the ability to make his men listen to her.

Yet now, Brie was here, alive and well. How could he explain it?

Michael’s smugness and disdain for Monica a second ago instantly turned into panic. For the first time, he was flustered.

He knew very well that Brie’s appearance would only bring him more harm than good. In fact, it could even make him die a tragic death.

His body was trembling, and he tried very hard to suppress it.

At that moment, Brie said loudly to the judge, “I’m Brie. May I appear in the defendant’s stand?”

The judge seemed to be silent for a few seconds before he turned back to look at the jury. When he saw the jury nod in unison, the judge had no choice but to allow it.

Brie was brought to the defendant’s stand by the staff.

Daniel was also shocked when he saw Brie. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He had just sworn to everyone at the scene that everything had nothing to do with Michael. If Brie were to expose him now, his charges might increase!

Brie’s gaze was not on anyone at the moment.

She said to the judge, “I object to the defendant accusing me of being the mastermind behind Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine incident. I want to defend myself.”

According to legal procedures, the judge could not refuse the defendant’s legal defense.
