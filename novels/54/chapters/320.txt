Chapter 321: Set a Date for the Wedding

He saw her lipstick stain on the rim of the cup where she had just drunk it, but he still drank the rest of it.

She thought he did not want coffee!

“Do you like such bitter coffee, Ms. Lawrence?” After drinking it, a certain someone asked.

“It keeps me awake.”

“It’s too bitter.”

It was just to keep her awake.

She was about to speak when a certain someone’s face suddenly drew closer.

The next second, Jeanne could feel her heart beating rapidly as Fourth Master Swan landed an unexpected kiss on her lips.

The taste of coffee filled her lips and teeth. However, at that moment, she felt that it was unusually delicious…

He remained there for a long time before parting with her soft lips.

Then, he said, “This way, it won’t be bitter.”

She was speechless, but in her head, she thought, ‘Get lost, pervert!’

Fourth Master Swan put down the coffee cup and stood up straight. “You can continue working.”

......

After that, he left casually and sat back on the sofa, where he picked up his phone to look at it as if nothing had happened just now.

He looked as if he would not disturb her from working.

However, Jeanne pursed her lips, on which she could still feel that strong sensation.

Next time, she definitely would not allow Fourth Master Swan to accompany her to work overtime.

She tried her best to get her head in her work. What she thought would take at most two hours took her more time to complete because of Fourth Master Swan.

It took more than four hours, and when she looked at the time, it was already past 12 a.m. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She saved her documents and shut down her computer.

The moment she looked to the side, she saw the man leaning against the sofa, asleep with his eyes closed.

Although it was pretty late at night, it was not so late that he was too tired to support himself.

However, she still made her movements lighter as she walked over to him.

She had always known that he was too perfect, but every time she looked at him carefully, she would be attracted to him again.

Hence, it really was not Amy’s fault. Anyone would make a mistake with a man like that in front of them.

Her eyes then fell on Fourth Master Swan’s lips.

Apparently, people with thin lips were fickle, but was that true?

When she kissed him just now, she felt the deepest love in the world, and it even made her a little infatuated.

She took a deep breath and turned around when someone grabbed hold of her arm.

Jeanne was shocked.

Was the guy not asleep?!

“Where are you going, Ms. Lawrence?”

She thought, ‘To calm down.’

However, she turned around with a smile and said, “I saw you sleeping soundly, so I didn’t want to disturb you. I thought I’d let you sleep a little longer.”

“Are you done with your work?” Edward asked.

“I just did. I’m sorry for making you wait, Fourth Master.”

“Let’s go.” Edward stood up from the sofa, held her hand, and did not let go.

Just like that, Edward pulled Jeanne out of the office and into the elevator.

Amy’s office was right outside Jeanne’s, so she watched with her mouth agape as Director Lawrence was taken away. She had always thought Director Lawrence was the strong independent type of woman. Standing at 180 cm, Director Lawrence was more dominant than anyone else in the room. However, Amy was absolutely sure that at that moment, in front of Fourth Master Swan, Director Lawrence looked petite, protected, and... could be bullied.

She was talking about... in bed.

..

Jeanne sat in Fourth Master Swan’s car again.

The car drove on the streets of South Hampton City.

As it was very late at night, very few cars were around, and the entire road was so weirdly quiet.

Jeanne felt that there was something off about the streets tonight.

It was not that she had never gotten off work so late in the past. However, she had a feeling that some places were different from usual, but she could not pinpoint what it was at the moment.

She just looked at the streets, staring out the window.

Then, she looked at the night sky of South Hampton City…

That was right! Why was it so dark?

The night sky of South Hampton City was always bright with stars and lights.

At that moment, not only was the city quiet but very few lights were lit too. If one were to look carefully, one would realize that the street lights on both sides of the street had been switched off.

Was there a power outage in the entire city?

How was that possible?

Now that technology was so advanced, a normal electrical accident would not cause a power outage in the entire city.

Suddenly, her eyes stopped on a huge electronic screen flashing with a blinding light.

There were pink words on the white screen.

“Jeanne, marry me!” At the same time, a magnetic voice sounded, and along with it, a large heart bloomed on the screen.

Jeanne was stunned for a long time, and her heart was racing.

She turned her head to look at Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan was not on the screen, but she was very familiar with Fourth Master Swan’s voice.

Moreover, it was obviously a proposal. Other than him, there was no one else.

She just kept looking at him without saying a word.

Her heart was beating so fast that she could not say a single word.

“Monica did it for Finn before.” Fourth Master Swan’s voice was very low.

However, Jeanne just listened to him.

“At that time, even Finn, who was so pure and innocent, was moved. So, I thought you’d like it.”

It was not that she did not like it, but… she was just afraid she would let him down.

“You don’t like It?” Having not gotten an answer from Jeanne, Edward asked.

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne’s expression suddenly turned serious.

Edward raised his eyebrows.

“Aren’t you afraid that this would all be a waste?”Jeanne asked.

What he had done for her had all gone to waste.

Edward seemed to smile.

He understood what she meant.

Did she not mean that she might not appreciate what he had done?

“But...” Jeanne suddenly got up from her seat and moved closer to Fourth Master Swan.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

“I will try my best to make it… not a waste, Fourth Master.”

After that, she hugged Fourth Master Swan’s neck and kissed him deeply.

The kiss was a response to his deep love for her.
