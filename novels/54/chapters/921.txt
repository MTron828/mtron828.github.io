922 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

“So, Mr. Hill, are you saying Melinda is your bottom line?”

“Lucy!”

“Otherwise, what’s wrong with me protecting my legitimate rights and interests? I don’t accept Melinda’s personal attacks on me. Why can’t I fight back?” Lucy’s uncontrollable emotions were also starting to explode.

“It’s because you’re just an assassin of the Hills. Assassins only need to carry out orders unconditionally! What right do you have to talk to me about human rights?! Do you think you have rights?” Kingsley interrogated her.

Lucy’s eyes narrowed, staring straight at Kingsley. Just like that, she had been completely ridiculed by Kingsley.

That’s right. She had almost forgotten. She had been living so comfortably all these years that she almost forgot that assassins had no rights. So, there was no personal attack.

In the Hills, Kingsley had the final say. Whatever Kingsley said was true, and they would carry out whatever order Kingsley gave. From the moment they became assassins, they were to obey unconditionally.

Lucy smiled coldly. It had been a long time since she lost control of herself.

No matter how cruel Kingsley was to her, she endured it. Yet, because of one of Kingsley’s women, she ended up in this state, being taught a lesson by Kingsley in front of so many assassins.

In fact, she should not have any emotional fluctuations. After all, an assassin should not have emotions.

“Alright. I understand.” Lucy suddenly calmed down. Until today, She had never been impulsive and would treat today as a one-off.

She said, “From now on, whatever Melinda says is right.”

She would not refute, object, or lose her temper at her again since she had no right. Assassins were not qualified to do what they wanted, nor did they have their own thoughts.

Kingsley’s expression seemed to have become even uglier.

He glared fiercely at Lucy and watched as her arrogance disappeared to look extremely calm in an instant. Lucy’s irrational behavior had indeed angered him. However, now, Lucy’s obedience made him feel an indescribable sense of depression.

Lucy met Kingsley’s gaze. It was obvious he was still in a great rage.

She said, “Do I still have to apologize to Melinda?”

Should she apologize so he would not be so angry? She did not want him to kill her in a fit of anger.

However, she did not get a response from Kingsley. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“I’m sorry,” Lucy said to Melinda.

All the assassins were a little surprised. No matter how incompetent Lucy was, she had followed Kingsley for many years and was trusted by him. Apart from Kingsley, Lucy was the one in charge of the Hills. Lucy had always helped Kingsley arrange many things for the Hills, so many assassins had already determined Lucy as the Hills’ female head. Of course, Lucy could not be compared to Jeanne, but Jeanne was a member of the Hills. Lucy was the only assassin who had managed to get to her current position, which made many envious and admiring of her.

However, had the sky changed? Had the killer, Melinda, who was at the start of her career, replaced Lucy’s existence? The assassins thought to themselves. While this group of people was fighting with their lives, it was only natural that they would still have their own little thoughts in order to live a better life.

Lucy’s apology made Melinda happy. Lucy’s low stance in front of so many assassins meant that her status was beneath Melinda’s. Now, all of them would have to be respectful to her.

This had been her goal. The first step was to remove Lucy’s identity completely, and the second was to find a way to get rid of her during a mission.

She had long understood the operations of the Hills. Many of the tasks were not arranged by Kingsley himself. Previously, Lucy had helped Kingsley. Now that she had replaced Lucy, soon, she would have great power. Once she could arrange for assassins to go on missions, it would be easy for her to kill Lucy.

Melinda’s expression was hard to hide. At that moment, it seemed as if she was magnanimously forgiving Lucy. She said, “I might have been too direct with my words. I’ll be more careful in the future.”
