1152 The War Has Started: Edward’s True Identity Is Exposed

It was very likely that he would have become a sacrifice.

“Fourth Master sent George to my house. Teddy is with him,” Finn replied.

“Don’t beat around the bush. If George was still in your house, do you think I would come here to ask you?” Alex raised his eyebrows.

Finn said bluntly, “When I went out today, George and Teddy were still there.”

“I know that you’re smart and that you can think of many things. You even thought of hiding George before I did. However, Finn, no matter how smart you are, you’re just a subordinate who needs to listen to other people’s orders. You don’t have the ability to go against me.” He was telling him not to go against him.

His tone was even a little too cold.

“I don’t know where George is!” Finn did not react to Alex’s questioning.

Alex looked at Finn coldly for a full half a minute before he slowly took out a phone from his pocket.

Finn’s eyes narrowed. Only then did he realize that his phone was no longer with him.

Alex said, “You called Teddy before you called me in the afternoon.”

Finn knew very well that the man in front of him was not simple at all. After so many years of training, it was impossible for it to be simple.

“I just told him that I might be in trouble and told him to take good care of George.”

“I don’t want to use any cruel methods on you to force you to answer some questions.” Alex’s expression was cold. “No matter what, you’re my brother, Edward’s most important buddy. I don’t want to cause any conflict between me and Edward because of you.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

That was right. He and Nox both knew that Edward was Alex’s younger brother — his younger brother from a different father.

Alex’s father, the heir of the Duncans, had died a tragic death because of the coup.

Alex’s mother, Winnie Schnider, was the wife of the Duncans’ heir. During the time of crisis, she was saved by Old Master Swan, Zachary, and was lucky enough to escape. After she escaped, the Duncans knew that they had lost their advantage, and to protect the last descendant of the Duncans, they faked Winnie’s death. Then, they let Zachary take the head of the Duncans’ leader to join the Sanders. In order to not make the Sanders feel threatened, Zachary voluntarily withdrew from the government and chose to go into business. From then on, he hid from the Sanders and began to secretly nurture the descendants of the Duncans.

Due to a careless mistake, the news of Winnie’s fake death was discovered. However, at that time, the Duncans’ last remaining loyal members were severely injured and could not retaliate against the Sanders. They could only choose to let die for real so that the Sanders could confirm that there were no descendants in the Duncans. Only then could they truly ensure the safety of their descendants.

Hence, the Duncans’ loyal men started to discuss how to create a death so that the Sanders would not find out anything.

In order to protect her son, Winnie was not afraid of sacrificing herself. However, she knew that once she died, Alex would be left alone in this world with no family! She did not doubt the loyalty of the people around her to the Duncans, but she hoped that there would be someone blood-related who could accompany Alex and help him to take back the family’s power.

As such, she took the initiative to ask Zachary, the most loyal man of the Duncans, to give birth to Alex’s brother.

Zachary could not refuse Winnie’s request.

It was not only because he could not refuse the monarch, but also because Zachary had developed some feelings for Winnie after spending some time with her.

Hence, he and Winnie Schnider had Edward.

After giving birth, Winnie did not feed Edward any milk or carry him. Just like what they had planned, she died at the hands of the Sanders with a child who was similar to Alex.

From then on, Edward was like a puppet and became a tool to help Alex take back the power of the Duncans.

From a young age, Edward had heard a lot about how he was conceived for the Duncans’ great cause and that the only thing he should do in his life was to help Alex take back the power of the Duncans.

No one had ever asked him whether he wanted to or whether he was happy.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly as he said, “Since you don’t want to have a conflict with your brother, you shouldn’t use George as a threat.”

Alex narrowed his eyes.

He said, “When necessary, sacrifices will have to be made. Edward knows very well why he was born and what his purpose is. So, no matter what happens, he’ll have no choice but to accept it.”
