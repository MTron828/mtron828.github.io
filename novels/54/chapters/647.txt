Chapter 648: News Flash: Next Time, I Will Kill You!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a high-end western restaurant, Finn left, leaving Monica and Michael behind.

Monica stared at Finn’s silhouette and watched him walk away so coldly and resolutely.

Finn had abandoned her time and time again.

She bit her lips tightly as tears welled up in her eyes.

“Monica,” Michael called out to her carefully.

Monica came back to her senses and said, “I want to go back.”

“Okay,” Michael agreed without saying anything else.

He picked up the crutches that Monica had thrown away and helped her into his car.

The two of them remained silent throughout the journey. Monica just looked out of the car window quietly while Michael took a few glances at Monica.

His expression was a little grim.

Only now, after Monica and Finn were truly separated, did he truly understand how much Monica loved Finn. It had exceeded his expectations.

He drove Monica back to her house quietly.

Monica said, “Michael, you should go back and rest early.”

“Monica, I...” Michael’s face was filled with guilt. He was probably apologizing for today’s matter.

Monica shook her head. It seemed like she did not want to talk.

Michael said, “I’ll accompany you for a while longer.”

“No need.” Monica refused.

“I’m really worried about you being at home alone.” Michael’s face was full of sincerity and worry.

“Michael, let’s keep our distance,” Monica suddenly said.

Her words seemed to have surprised Michael.

Monica actually did not know how to say those things to Michael. She always felt that Michael liked her and was very good to her, so she did not want to hurt him with words. Yet now, she still rejected him so bluntly.

They both suddenly fell silent, and awkwardness filled the air between them.

Michael smiled dejectedly. “I’m sorry, Monica. I didn’t consider your feelings and asked Finn out today without discussing it with you beforehand. I just wanted to–”

“You don’t have to say it. I know how you feel,” Monica interrupted him. “But I hope you won’t interfere in the matter between Finn and me.”

Michael looked at Monica.

Monica said, “Finn is right. Regardless of whether I did it willingly or not, it’s true that Finn and I broke up and got a divorce because of you. No matter what, he will hold a grudge against you. If you go to him, it will only agitate him more, even though you have good intentions.”

Michael pursed his lips.

He did not expect that after being treated like that by Finn, Monica would see things more clearly than before.

With Monica’s personality, she should have broken down and been in a bad temper right now. She would not care so much and throw herself into his arms to complain about Finn. However, she was unexpectedly calm.

She knew what she should do in the relationship.

Monica did not look at Michael, probably because she was afraid of hurting him. Even if she was afraid of hurting him, she said, “Michael, just focus on developing your career. You developing your career will be the greatest help to me. As for other things... I can solve them myself.”

She could not be any clearer with what she wanted. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Monica wanted him to stay away from her and not interrupt her matters.

However, it was too late.

From the moment Monica agreed to help Michael and chose to divorce Finn, it was all too late.

Michael forced himself to smile even though his face was bruised from Finn’s beating. He said, “Monica, I crossed the line.”

Monica bit her lips lightly and did not say anything about Michael blaming himself for it.

“I’m going back now. Remember to take good care of yourself. You didn’t eat anything tonight, so remember to have dinner,” Michael reminded her.

“Okay.”

With that, Michael turned around and left.

After entering the elevator, Michael’s face turned grim.

Monica really loved Finn more than he thought, and he could not just sit around and wait for his doom.

He picked up the phone and asked coldly, “Did you get everything?”

“I did.”

“Expose it to the public tomorrow morning.”

“Yes.”

Michael’s eyes narrowed.

It was not his fault for being ruthless. If they had to blame someone, the people blocking his way were to blame!

…

The next day, Monica woke up from hunger.

She cried the whole of last night.

Ever since she chose to help Michael, she seemed so fragile that she would cry at first touch.
