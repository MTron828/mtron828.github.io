951 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

“Put on your clothes.” Michael glanced at Monica. “Although Finn is not interested in your body, it doesn’t mean that I’m willing to let other men see you naked. After all, in my opinion, you will become my woman sooner or later.”

“You must be dreaming!” Monica gritted her teeth.

She would never be with Michael again. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Just you wait and see,” Michael said.

With that, he left.

It was as if everything was already under his control, and Monica would fall into his trap. He was just waiting to reap the benefits.

Monica’s body was trembling in anger. She had never hated someone so badly. She hated him so much that even if she had to die with him, she would.

All the anger in her body was focused on Michael until she noticed Finn’s gaze.

In the beginning, Finn’s back was facing her, but at that moment, he suddenly turned around to face her.

He looked at her and said, “Put your clothes on.”

His voice was a little cold, which was different from Michael’s tone just now.

Michael was provoking her, whereas Finn was…

She was not sure if Finn was disgusted with her exposed body.

Monica lowered her head.

She was so angry just now that she only realized now that her clothes had been torn out of shape by Michael. The hospital gown was big on her already, and after it was torn, the hole made it even looser. In that hospital gown, one could see her chest without paying attention, and she was not wearing a bra.

Monica bit her lip. Under Finn’s gaze, she tried her best to straighten her clothes.

In fact, it would be fine if he did not look.

With that, she turned around and went back to the ward, hiding all her emotions from Finn.

She did not want to involve anyone in the grudge between her and Michael, let alone Finn.

As Monica walked into the room, she habitually glanced at her father.

No matter how light her movements were, and even if they all left the ward in the end, she was still afraid of waking her father up.

The moment she went over to look at her father, her expression changed.

Her father’s face was blue, and his eyes were wide open but out of focus. His mouth was open and trembling, but he could not say a word. At that moment, his whole body seemed to be tensing up. He looked like…

Monica hurriedly rushed out of the ward and shouted at Finn, who was walking down the corridor. “Finn, something has happened to my dad. Quickly come and take a look at him!”

Monica’s excitement made Finn turn around abruptly and rush into the ward.

As soon as Finn saw Gary in the ward, he grabbed Monica and said, “Press the red button and have the nurse on duty inform the doctor on duty immediately to prepare the operating theatre. I want to do an emergency rescue.”

Monica quickly followed Finn’s instructions.

She was scared out of her wits, but she forced herself to remain calm and do as Finn said.

She refused to accept her father’s death.

Her eyes were red, and she was at a loss. She could only watch helplessly as Finn gave her father emergency treatment.

Then, very soon, the door of the ward was pushed open again.

Several doctors and nurses on duty pushed a mobile bed in and quickly transferred her father to the mobile bed before running straight to the operating theatre.

Monica followed them and watched as her father was sent into the operating theatre.

She stood outside alone, standing guard.

If something really happened to her father… how was she going to answer to her mother? What would her mother do?

Monica broke down and wanted to cry.

To her, nothing was more important than her parents’ lives right now.

For now, she only wanted her parents to live well. As long as they were alive, she would be content.

Then, the door of the operating theatre suddenly opened.

Monica watched as a nurse walked out.

At that moment, she was really scared out of her wits. She was really afraid that the nurse would tell her that the resuscitation failed…

She looked at the nurse with red eyes and thought, ‘Don’t be so cruel. I beg you, don’t be so cruel.’

“Ms. Cardellini.” The nurse said, “This is Dr. Jones’s white coat. Put it on first. It’s easier for you to catch a cold at night.”

Stunned, Monica watched as the nurse handed her a piece of clothing.

At that moment, she seemed to remember that she was still wearing that “shameless” outfit.

She took it and just held it in his hand.

In fact, she did not care about her image anymore.

The nurse continued, “Ms. Cardellini, don’t be too sad. Believe in Dr. Jones’s skills. He has never made a mistake in surgery, and he will definitely make sure that your father is fine. Also, Dr. Jones told you not to inform your mother for the time being. If something really happens, he will let you know in advance.”

“Thank you,” Monica said.

She could not find other words to say.

She did not know if that was Finn’s ethics as a doctor or… his concern for her.

However, at that moment, she was really comforted because telling her not to inform his mother for the time being meant that there was still hope for her father.

For her, that was enough.
