Chapter 1502: Chloe’s End: The Death Struggle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“This crime is punishable by death.”

Chloe could not believe her ears. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

What did he mean by ‘punishable by death’? What she did was just a very normal thing between a man and a woman. There was no law stating that doing that could lead to jail time or death!

She could not accept what was happening before her.

She looked at Edward and saw that he was already walking toward the door. She called out to him in a panic, “Edward, don’t go. Tell them the truth. I didn’t harass you, and I didn’t hurt you. What happened between us is-I‘

Edward suddenly stopped in his tracks. It was not because Chloe called him, but because he saw Candice at the door, looking at everything that was happening in front of her indifferently.

“Edward, help me.” Chloe thought Edward was listening to her, so she quickly put on a pitiful expression. ‘Wasn’t I just drinking with you? We were drunk and that was why we… I didn’t harass you, did I? Can you tell them to leave? I’m so scared.”

No man would be able to withstand seeing her weak, and she refused to believe that Edward would remain indifferent when she had been wronged to that extent.

She looked at Edward’s bare back with anticipation and suppressed her impulse to jump at him. If it were not for that group of people suddenly rushing in, she and Edward would already be having sex.

Looking at Edward’s bare upper body, she felt her mouth go dry. She had never looked forward to sleeping with a man so much. Her throat moved slightly as she looked at Edward helplessly.

She thought that he would turn around and help her. However, all she heard was his cold voice say, “The law will give you a fair answer.”

Chloe’s eyes widened. She did not believe that Edward would say something like that.

Just now, she even thought that it had nothing to do with Edward. Since those people were Edward’s bodyguards, who would rush out to protect Edward whenever something happened, they must have thought that she was hurting Edward in bed. That was why they appeared so abruptly.

However, at that moment, she could not even lie to herself. Edward’s cold attitude made her feel that Edward planned everything.

That was right. She remembered Edward telling those people earlier to send her to the detention center — it was Edward’s instructions, but why did he do that?

Was it just because she seduced him? Did all men not want to be seduced or charmed with such methods? Even if he did not like it, he would not reiect it, but why did he have to treat her like that?

At that moment, she was dumbfounded as she watched Edward leave. She still refused to believe that trying to get someone in bed would convict her. She did not commit murder or arson. What right did they have to say she was guilty?

The moment the man in the black suit approached Chloe and tried to take her away by force, Chloe let out a shriek of despair. Her deafening cries echoed inside the villa, and it sounded so tragic.

Candice, on the other hand, just listened indifferently. She thought she would at least have some compassion for Chloe. Although she would not say that she sympathized with Chloe, Chloe was her biological sister after all, and she thought that their blood relation would at least be able to make her feel something.

However, it did not. It was as if the woman who was being treated rudely was just a stranger to her. She could look at Chloe coldly and watch her struggle in those men’s arms.

Just then, her eyes flickered because the man in front of her was blocking her line of sight. She looked up at him.

“Let’s go back to the room,” he said in a low voice.

Candice pursed her lips and nodded slowly. She did not say anything about Choe at all. Since Edward had decided on it, she could not go against it.

After she followed Edward back to the room, Edward went to take a shower first. This time, he took a long time to shower, and when he came out, his body was already red from all the scrubbing, like he was disgusted by Chloe’s touch.

The two of them lay on the same bed. After what happened to Chloe, Candice could not fall asleep. She already knew that it would not end well for Chloe if she provoked Edward, but she did not expect it to come so quickly. Chloe had planned it for a long time and had been looking forward to it..
