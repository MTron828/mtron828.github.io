Chapter 578: Don’t Show Up in Front of Me, I Think You’re Disgusting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the other hand, Michael seemed to care too much about her, which was understandable.

After all, he must think she had sacrificed a lot for him, so he probably wanted to make up for it.

Monica, however, decided not to think too much about it. Everything would be fine once Michael’s career was stable.

With that, she got up with her crutches and took a bath.

Although there was nothing to unpack, she was still a little tired after making sure everything was in place.

All she wanted was to take a bath and have a good sleep.

Hence, Monica walked into the bathroom and took a look at the shower gel prepared in the bathroom.

It was not her usual brand, and she had always been very resistant to the smell of that brand.

Previously, when she was staying in a hotel, she could make requests from the staff. However, the mall was now closed!

Just then, she suddenly remembered that she still had a lot of things at Finn’s place.

She had not been in the mood to pack up and was also a little afraid of seeing Finn because he was so cold to her.

Yet now, she suddenly had a strong impulse to do that.

On top of wanting to take her shower gel, her impulse was fueled by her desire of wanting to see Finn.

Moreover, she was a person who would do whatever she wanted.

Without taking a shower, she walked out of the door with her crutches and then took a taxi to Finn’s apartment.

Actually, her heart was still beating a little fast.

Since the last time she saw Finn at Fourth Master Swan’s place, they had not seen each other for a week or kept in contact. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Sometimes, she wanted to send a message to Finn, but she always felt that no matter what she did, she would probably not get a response from Finn. Moreover, Jeanne had told her that it was best not to disturb Finn during this time because it would make Finn even more disgusted with her... Well, he should not be disgusted by her packing her things, would he?

With that, she calmed her heartbeat and arrived at Finn’s apartment. Her heart was still beating very fast as she pressed her finger on the fingerprint lock.

At the thought that she might meet Finn, she could not help but jump in excitement.

However, in the next second, her mood soured when the voice prompt from the fingerprint lock said, “Your fingerprint cannot be identified. Please try again!”

She gritted her teeth and tried again but still failed.

That meant Finn had deleted her fingerprint information.

She told herself that she was not angry and that it was something a man like Finn would do.

Without fingerprint verification, she would enter the password.

There was once when she was locked out of the house. Her fingerprints could not be identified no matter how hard she tried, so Finn set up a password for her to enter. The password was simple — it consisted of six ones. When she set it up, Finn said he had to give her the simplest password because her IQ was low. She was pissed off at that time, but now, she found that Finn was indeed prescient. If it were more complicated, she would not be able to remember it.

She quickly entered the password, only for the voice prompt to say, “The password is incorrect.”

Monica frowned.

There was no way! The password was correct! She could still remember everything when Finn set the password.

Unwilling to give up, she entered it many times but was still locked out.

Monica was so angry that she hit the password on the door.

Finn was a ruthless b*stard.

She gritted her teeth and pressed the doorbell. Just as she pressed it, the door suddenly swung open.

Monica was stunned.

At that moment, she saw Finn, and seeing him in front of her caught her off guard. Suddenly, her anger subsided, and her heart beat faster.

Even though Finn’s expression looked unsightly, and he was frowning in annoyance to see her at the door, she pretended not to see it.

The moment she was about to speak, her eyes suddenly narrowed when she saw a woman with unkempt clothes behind Finn.

Monica did not believe what she saw. There was a woman in the house, and she could not even bring herself to react.

Before coming back to her senses, she heard Finn turn around and say to the woman behind her, “Go wait for me in my room!”

The woman was stunned.

Did he not tell her to leave? Why did he want her to wait for him now? Do all men like that?

It was also her first time, so she did not know much about men.

She almost took off her clothes just now, but the man in front of her did not react to her.

Nevertheless, she quickly agreed since she had received so much money from him.
