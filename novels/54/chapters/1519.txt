Chapter 1520: Side Story: Lucy, I Want You To Like Me Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The next second, she heard him say, “This is Jeanne, my sister’s daughter. My sister died early, so I’m her guardian from now on.”

Guardian? However, from the looks of it, the girl called Jeanne was really very young, about 17 or 18 years old.

“I’m 19,” Jeanne introduced herself.

She really did not know what was wrong with Kingsley to suddenly bring back a woman for her to meet. From the look in the woman’s eyes, she knew that the woman must have misunderstood something.

“Oh, hello. I’m Lucy. I’m 25 years old.”

“Is she supposed to be my sister?” Jeanne was asking Kingsley.

“You can call her your aunt,” Kingsley said bluntly.

Jeanne’s eyes widened. Lucy was six years older than her, yet she had to call her aunt?

“She’s the same seniority as me,” Kingsley explained.

At that time, Jeanne and Kingsley were not close enough for her to talk back to him. Hence, she called out, “Aunt Lucy.”

Lucy, on the other hand, felt a little awkward.

She was just an assassin Kingsley brought back. Since Jeanne was Kingsley’s biological niece, Jeanne would be her master. Why the hell did Jeanne have to call her aunt?

As such, Lucy said, “You can just call me by my name.”

“Just call her your aunt,” Kingsley said firmly.

Lucy did not dare to retort.

“Jeanne’s child doesn’t have a father, so if you have time in the future, you can help Jeanne take care of her child. His name is George,” Kingsley continued his introduction.

Lucy was speechless. She was an assassin, not a nanny.

“Let’s go.”

After Kingsley gave a simple introduction, he left with Lucy, and the two of them returned to the room.

Lucy was at a loss as to what to do when she saw Kingsley sitting on the sofa, seemingly tired. He called out to her, “Come and sit here.”

He patted the seat beside him, so Lucy walked over meekly and sat beside him.

Just as she sat down, she felt Kingsley pull her into his embrace. She did not dare to move, and her body stiffened a little. “Get used to living here,” Kingsley said.

“Alright.”

She could get used to being anywhere, but she was not used to being hugged like that, and she felt goosebumps all over her body.

In her heart, she shouted, “I’m here to be an assassin!”

“I’m a little sleepy. I’m going to sleep for a while. Do you want to join me?”

“I’m not sleepy. Can I walk around?” Lucy was really a little afraid of Kingsley. She found men, who were very different from what the rumors say, terrifying.

“Alright.” Kingsley nodded.

With that, he let go of Lucy and went to bed.

Lucy, on the other hand, took a deep breath and left the room. She randomly picked a direction and shuttled through the manor.

When she ran into many servants and assassins in the manor, no one took the initiative to greet each other. Besides, Lucy was just familiarizing herself with the environment in case she could still escape.

She turned around, and just as she was about to go back, a woman stood in front of her.

Lucy did not have the skills of a top-notch assassin, but she was more skilled than most other assassins. For example, she could tell at a glance whether the person in front of her was up to no good.

“Are you the woman Mr. Thorn brought back today?” The woman went straight to the point.

“Yes, I am. My name is Lucy.”

“The woman who’s rumored to be the number one assassin in the industry?”

“It’s just a rumor,” Lucy said humbly.

“No matter what, I’ve come to tell you the rules of the Hills.”

“Alright.” Lucy really hoped that someone would tell her what she should do here, even though that person was very hostile.

“The assassins of the Hills are only Mr. Thorn’s subordinates. Don’t think that you can have Mr. Thorn. He can’t belong to anyone. You should have some self-awareness.”

Lucy quickly nodded. She had never thought of having anything, let alone Kingsley.

“Mr. Thorn has many women. We female assassins often serve Mr. Thorn. At present, I’m the one who serves him the most. You should know what I mean.”

The woman looked a little smug.

“I know, I know.” Lucy appeared very humble.

When in other people’s territory, she naturally could not offend anyone before she could establish a position for herself.

“But I heard that Mr. Thorn has told you to sleep in the same room as him?” The woman raised her eyebrows.

To be able to learn the news so quickly, the woman should have a high status in the Hills.

She explained, “Maybe you’re still new.”

“Even so, you should know your place.” The woman sneered. “I’m not going to waste my breath on you. Make arrangements for me tonight. I want to sleep with Mr. Thorn..”
