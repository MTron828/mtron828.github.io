“Jeannie–”

“Listen to me.” Jeanne interrupted her, “No matter if he’s a good or bad person, you must keep your guard up. Even if he’s a good person, there’s nothing wrong with you being on guard against him as it won’t cause any conflict between you both. But if he’s a bad person, you’re protecting yourself by putting your guard up.”

Monica believed that Michael was a good person and wanted to refute Jeanne. However, when she saw how stern Jeanne looked, she was suddenly convinced.

“Monica.” Jeanne’s tone was a little heavy. “Your choice this time is not a good one. Since you can’t change it, the only thing you can do is to stop it from bringing more harm.”

Monica nodded. “Although I don’t feel that my choice is wrong, I believe in you.”

Jeanne smiled.

She was just afraid that one day, when the truth came out, Monica would not be able to accept it.

In fact, she was also anticipating it as she knew Michael was not the kind of person they thought he was.

…

Monica did not stay for dinner at the Bamboo Garden because she said Nox’s mouth was poisonous and that Edward’s eyes were murderous.

She was afraid that if she stayed too long in Bamboo Garden, she would feel depressed.

After Monica left, Edward and Jeanne, as well as George, who was sitting quietly in the corner and placing his dominoes, were left in Bamboo Garden.

Edward hugged Jeanne in his arms and said, “Are you planning to make a move against the Lawrences?”

“Yes.” Jeanne did not hide it.

“Okay,” Edward replied calmly and did not ask further.

“Edward,” Jeanne called out to him.

“Huh?”

“If one day, we stand on different sides, what would you do?”

Edward seemed to be stunned for a second.

When he did not answer, Jeanne smiled and said, “Just protect George.”

She looked at George in the corner with a smile.

Nothing else mattered except protecting George, and that was also why she exposed George’s identity.

Something could happen to her but not George.

Edward held her in her arms as he said, “Only you can kill me.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

“There’s no such thing as I kill you,” Edward said.

It seemed like an oath.

At that, Jeanne felt a little inexplicably uneasy.

Sometimes, she did not know if their seemingly real relationship would be indestructible when they had to make that choice, or would it shatter at the touch?

She raised her head and looked at Edward, who was also looking at her. Then, she took the initiative and kissed his lips.

Edward’s heartbeat began to race.

In fact, Jeanne rarely took the initiative, so every time she did, it would make his knees weak.

He held the back of Jeanne’s head as they kissed.

Teddy quickly walked over to George. “Young master, let’s go upstairs and play.”

George, of course, caught sight of his so-called biological father and his biological mother doing things inappropriate for children.

His mother said that after having a biological father, he would not become an orphan. However, she was wrong.

After having a biological father, he did not even have a mother.

While he followed Teddy angrily to the second floor, he started to think how he could snatch his biological mother back from his biological father!

…

In the Winter’s family home, Nox went back for the first time in forever, and the servants stared at him in a daze.

“What’s with your expression? Did you see a ghost?” Nox was speechless.

The servant quickly said respectfully, “I just didn’t expect you to come back today. Young Master, welcome home.”

Nox glanced at the servant before walking into the hall.

At that moment, other than his father, Eugene Winter, and his mother, Eugene Sullivan, Shelly was also there.

Shelly was everywhere he went. Not only was she staying in his apartment, but she was also there when he returned home.

He walked over casually and sat down on the sofa.

Eugene looked at his son with a look of disdain. “Did the sun rise from the west today? I can’t believe you’re willing to come home.”

“I’ve been busy with work.”

“I don’t think you’ve been busy with work.”

“How can you think of me like that?” Nox was a little angry. “I work my *ss out there, and you guys are at home enjoying yourselves–”

“He brings a woman home to spend the night every day,” Shelly suddenly said.

Nox’s eyes were bulging as he yelled at Shelly, “What nonsense are you talking about?”

“I have evidence.” Shelly took out her phone and clicked on the photo. “They’re not the same every night–”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
