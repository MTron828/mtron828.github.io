1344 Parting On Good Terms and Breaking Up In The End

“I’m sorry.” Finn suddenly apologized.

Monica pursed her lips.

“I spoke too harshly last night.”

“It’s nothing.” Monica stuffed everything into the box. “What you said is also the truth.”

“I get jealous too,” Finn said bluntly.

However, Monica continued packing her things.

“We’ve been together for so long, but I’ve never seen you treat me like that before. That was why I was jealous,” Finn said in a low voice.

At that moment, Monica seemed to look up at Finn.

“Nox said there was a problem with our relationship, but I didn’t realize it. I thought that since the two of us were together, we were really together. Moreover, we’ve been so busy, and we both need time to do our own things, so I tried not to disturb you and affect your work. I thought I was being considerate of you.” Finn looked at Monica and told her seriously, “I’ll try my best to change it in the future. ”

“Change what?” Monica put down the things she was packing and stood up from the ground.

Finn looked at Monica.

“I’ll care about you more and treat you better–”

“So you don’t think you treated me well before?” Monica asked him.

Finn was stunned.

Monica looked at his expression and smiled faintly. She knew he did not think that he treated her badly!

The conflict between her and Finn had never been about whether they treated each other well or not. It was about what value they brought into each other’s life.

To Finn, she was just his responsibility.

She said, “Finn, I’m really tired. I feel like, ever since the start, we’re from two separate worlds. I was the one who insisted on liking you. Our personalities, living environments, hobbies, and everything is different. We even think differently. When we’re together, other than making each other sad, I really can’t find much happiness. So, what’s the point of us getting back together the past three years? To be friends with benefits?”

Finn looked at Monica as if he did not expect her to have thought of their relationship like that all along.

He thought that by sleeping with her, they had given each other their hearts.

Yes, he admitted that because they had slept together, the sense that he would lose Monica again was almost gone. He just took it for granted that they would be together for the rest of their lives and thought what they needed to do was support each other so that this relationship could go smoothly. He had never thought that he would need to get Monica’s love again.

He really thought they were in love.

“Finn.” Monica looked at him, “What you want is a peaceful life, and what I want is a man who loves me. I’ve had enough of your coldness and indifference, of you treating everyone the same as you treat me. I’m sorry that I’m a selfish person. What I want is a man who loves me completely, not because it’s his responsibility to love me.”

“Monica–” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Forget it. Can you stop talking?” Monica interrupted Finn.

Finn looked at her.

At that moment, he was still so calm, and it made Monica wonder when Finn would lose his temper.

He seemed to have lost his temper last night, but in the end, he still rationally endured it.

Why would she like such a man? Could it be because she found him attractive?

That was right. Finn was not particularly handsome, but he met all of her beauty standards in a man, and she was attracted to his body.

Now that she realized that he was good-looking but useless, there was no need for her to be reluctant to leave.

“Let’s part on good terms. We can still be friends in the future.” Monica really did not want to talk to Finn anymore.

In fact, she was also suppressing her emotions now. However, she felt that if she lost her temper, she would think that she was crazy. Since Finn did not lose his temper, she would become especially embarrassed when the two of them quarreled.

She would rather things remain like that between them. Their breakup would be as calm as when they decided to be together.

“You may leave.” Monica said to Finn, “I want to pack my things alone. I’ll feel very uncomfortable if you’re beside me. ”

Finn swallowed the words he wanted to say. He could see that Monica was pushing him away by not wanting to talk to him anymore.

Actually… he was not great at expressing himself.

Especially over the past few years, he had developed a habitual mindset with Monica. As the two of them were respectful to each other and there had never been any conflicts, he thought that there was no conflict between them. It was only at that moment that he realized they were separated by a gap that could not be crossed.
