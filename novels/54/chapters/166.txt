Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

After saying so much just now, it turned out that Edward was not listening at all.

She said coldly, “Fourth Master, I don’t like you. What do I need to say to make you believe it?”

Edward looked straight at her.

“If I liked you, do you think I would’ve left seven years ago?”Jeanne asked him in return.

Edward’s expression changed.

Teddy was waiting by the side. At this moment, he could feel his master’s anger.

Ms. Lawrence was not afraid of death at all.

“Fourth Master, please don’t make things difficult for me.” Jeanne did not want to say more.

That was all she was going to say.

This was the end of their relationship.

Jeanne stood up and left.

“Ms. Lawrence,” Edward called out to her, “Who’s George’s father?”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

“Fourth Master, you shouldn’t be too confident,” she responded slowly.

Fourth Master Swan seemed to have smiled.

His smile was so cold that it was chilling.

Edward stood up and walked to Jeanne’s front.

He looked down at her.

Next, he said coldly, “On this day seven years ago, you climbed into my bed.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Her chest seemed to have been hit by something.

She vaguely remembered that year and that day.

At that time, Eden had an affair.

Jeanne was not resigned to the outcome, so she made a huge fuss about it in South Hampton City.

In actuality, why would she be so agitated if she was not bothered? Why would she be so agitated that she lost her mind and did something that only an idiot would do?

At the end of the day...

She was only 18 years old that year.

At 18 years old, Jeanne was enjoying a pure and beautiful love when she suddenly found out that the teen she loved had slept with her stepsister.

It would have been better if it were someone else.

However...

Both Eden and Jasmine were the people closest to her.

Jeanne had never been bad to Jasmine.

Jasmine also pretended to be very obedient in front of her.

When the news of Eden and Jasmine sleeping together broke out, Jeanne really felt as if she had been struck by lightning!

Jeanne admitted that she was vengeful back then.

She wanted to take revenge on the cheating couple. That was why she had asked Eden to give her an explanation in front of the media, asking him to apologize to her in front of the entire country.

Jeanne had once naively thought that Eden would repent.

She had always thought that Eden loved her very much.

She had always thought that Eden would be afraid of losing her.

Who knew, Eden announced to the public that he had broken up with her.

He had announced to the public that he had fallen in love with Jasmine.

As such, Jeanne went to the Swans’ residence alone.

She wanted an explanation from Eden and to confront him in person.

However, she was rejected.

Eden and his parents avoided her.

They even invited the media to expose her unruly and willful ways, causing her to lose her reputation in South Hampton City.

Jeanne was 18 at that time.

In the Lawrences’ residence, she had learned nothing.

She did not know how to fight back, nor did she know how to prove her innocence to the world.

Jeanne only knew how to hate.

She hated them to the bone.

Therefore, when Jeanne was forced out of the Swans’ Purple Pavilion Garden, she turned around and went to Fourth Master Swan’s Bamboo Garden.

Jeanne remembered very clearly.

She sat at the gate of the Bamboo Garden, waiting for Fourth Master Swan.

She waited for a long time.

That night, it was also drizzling.

Jeanne was drenched. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She was drenched, but she finally waited until Fourth Master Swan returned.

If...

If it had been a little later, perhaps Jeanne would have calmed down.

Edward had returned just in time.

Jeanne looked at him standing in front of her.

At that time, Teddy was not serving him yet.

The man holding the umbrella for Fourth Master Swan was Nox.

“Ms. Lawrence?” Fourth Master Swan called out to her in a deep voice.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“Are you lost?” He asked her.

There was never any emotion in his voice.

This was the case whether it was seven years ago or seven years later.

No one knew what he was thinking.

Jeanne said, “Fourth Master.”

“Yes?”

“I want to be Eden’s fourth aunt. Do you think it’s okay?”

Jeanne saw the look of surprise on the face of the usually expressionless Fourth Master Swan.

She stood up from the ground.

Her body was drenched.

Jeanne approached Fourth Master Swan.

She was not pushed away.

She did not know if Fourth Master Swan was drunk at that time. She only knew very clearly that he reeked of alcohol when she approached him. She, who had not drunk alcohol at the age of 18, even felt that the smell of it made her a little drunk.

Jeanne hugged Edward’s body tightly.
