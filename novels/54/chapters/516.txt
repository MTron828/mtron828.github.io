Chapter 517: Monica Swayed By Her Emotions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The two held each other tightly in the ward, kissing for a long time.

Still kneeling in front of Finn, Monica looked at him pitifully.

Her mouth was swollen from the kiss.

How could that man be such a bully?

In fact, she was a little surprised to learn that Finn was jealous. If he were not, he would not have kissed her like that.

She looked at Finn with a hint of happiness in her eyes, looking all smug like she had achieved something great.

Finn, who was lying on the bed, did not look too happy as he seemed to be losing control over Monica.

He was so angry just now that he lost his mind.

When he came to his senses and noticed that Monica’s mouth was swollen from his kiss, he took a deep breath and said, “Come here.”

After all, he did not have a tendency to be violent.

Monica smiled.

It turned out Finn was not that difficult to deal with.

With that, she carefully got up from the bed and carefully leaned into Finn’s embrace.

She reckoned since Finn was so strong now, he should be able to be discharged from the hospital in a few days.

In that case, they should be able to... make a baby in a few days.

At the thought of what would happen next, Monica could not help but feel excited.

“You’re not allowed to be seen with Michael in the future,” Finn suddenly said in a serious tone, which was different from Monica’s current appearance.

Monica hurriedly nodded. “I won’t. I’ll never see him again.”

“Michael...” However, Finn swallowed the words that he wanted to say.

He thought, ‘Forget it. Monica doesn’t need to know what kind of person Michael is.’

Besides, with Monica’s current understanding of Michael, she would not believe everything Finn said. She might even think he was deliberately trying to sow discord between them.

Monica had never thought too highly of Finn, but with regard to Michael, she really thought that he treated her very well.

When that thought crossed Finn’s mind, a mix of emotions suddenly overtook him.

Monica, who had never been able to notice the changes in people’s emotions, leaned close to Finn and said sweetly, “Finn, I really want to have a child with you.”

Finn’s body tensed up.

“I really, really want to,” Monica muttered.

She had been fantasizing about that day, and it had become a fantasy of hers.

After that day, Monica no longer stayed in contact with Michael. She believed that Michael needed time to forget about their relationship, and her frequent appearance would only make it harder for him to forget her. Therefore, when Michael said he would handle the news involving their scandal but did not do it, Monica did not question him either.

Moreover, Michael was the one who suffered the most damage to his reputation.

After all, Michael’s identity was different from theirs. When she and Finn were on the news, it was just gossip. However, when Michael was on the news, it would involve politics, which was a whole different ball game.

Monica also could not understand why Michael did not deal with it. Could it be that he could not deal with it, or was it something else?

Nevertheless, Michael did not give her an answer, and she did not ask him about it either.

The news would slowly die down anyway.

Hence, she ignored the news. If it were not for Reese, Michael’s mother, coming to look for her, she might have forgotten about the news.

With Finn in her life, life was good, so she was a little surprised when she saw Reese.

It was the nurse who told her that someone wanted to see her.

At that time, Finn was in the room, discussing some matters regarding the surgery with the doctors in his department. She was rather bored listening to it, so she followed the nurse out of the ward, where she saw Reese.

Monica was stunned.

Reese’s complexion still did not look good, but perhaps it was because she had put on makeup that she looked somewhat different from the day she was in Liam’s ward. However, she still looked a little dull and not as sharp as she used to look.

She said, “I’d like to have a chat with you.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Here?” Monica asked.

“If possible, let’s find a quiet place.” Reese was no longer as arrogant as she was, but she still carried a strong presence.

Monica thought for a moment before saying, “Follow me.”

Then, she limped with her crutches and brought Reese to a reception room in the VIP Ward area of the hospital.
