Chapter 1488: Monica Suspects Candice’s Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice shook her head. “No.”

“He already has two children,” Monica reminded.

It was not that she thought Candice should not have a child with Edward, but she just… could not describe her feelings. She just wondered if the family would be even more distant from George after Candice had a child with Edward.

“Edward did not use a condom, so he probably wants a child.” Candice said,

“Based on my understanding of him, if he doesn’t want children, he’ll tell me.”

Monica nodded. With Edward’s character, that was indeed the case. However, she sighed in her heart. What was Jeanne to Edward? Was Jeanne considered dead to him?

Monica looked straight at Candice at that moment, staring at her facial features.

Candice frowned, wondering why Monica was looking at her like that. Amidst her confusion, she saw Monica suddenly reach out to grab her face.

Candice was startled. “What are you doing?

All she wanted was to get pregnant and have a child. Was Monica angry because of that? Was everything not fine just now?

Monica snapped back to her senses when Candice called out to her.

She wanted to see if Candice was wearing a human skin mask. Apparently, it could change a person’s face completely. Since Jeanne had worn that thing previously, could… Candice be doing the same too?

Did she miss Jeanne so much that she was going crazy?!

Monica put down her hand and said faintly, “Nothing, I’m just unhappy that you took Jeanne’s place.”

Candice did not think so because Monica’s action just now was clearly to confirm something on her face.

Despite that, she went with Monica and said, “I’m just replacing her to help take care of her child and the man she loves the most.”

“Why does that sound so b*tchy?” Monica didn’t give him any face. “It does sound b*tchy if Jeanne can still take care of them herself. However, she’s now dead,” Candice refuted.

Monica agreed with Candice.

“Don’t worry. Even if I’m pregnant, I’ll treat George and Paige the same.” Candice promised.

Monica did not reply.

It was not that she did not believe Candice, but she was a little disappointed that there was no human skin mask on Candice’s face.

The car returned to Bamboo Garden.

“Do you want to go in and see Paige?” Candice asked Monica.

“No.” Monica refused immediately, “But I don’t mind seeing George.”

Candice really liked Monica’s honesty. Monica never hid who she liked or disliked. With such a straightforward personality, interacting with Monica was not exhausting at all.

The two of them walked into the hall together. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the hall, Chloe was watching television on the sofa. When she saw Candice, she quickly went up to her and said warmly, “Sis, you’re back.”

Candice nodded.

“Is this Monica? I often read news about you, saying that you’re a successful businesswoman. I really admire you.” Chloe flattered Monica.

Monica, however, was utterly disgusted. Usually, women who took the initiative to curry favor were not good people.

Suddenly, she thought she found the woman a little similar to Jasmine, and just thinking about it made her feel terrified.

“I’m going to see George.” Monica walked away without glancing at Chloe.

Chloe was naturally a little embarrassed, so she turned to look at Candice. However, Candice did not try to smooth things over for her and left with Monica instead.

As the two of them walked up the stairs, Candice found it hard to believe that Monica was pregnant. Although Monica was pregnant with twins, her walk was brisk. Even so, Candice made sure to protect her carefully.

“Didn’t you notice you have an extra b*tch in your house?” Monica reminded Candice as she walked.

“There’s nothing to be afraid of.” Candice smiled faintly.

Monica did not say much. As long as Candice knew, all was good.

The two of them walked to George’s room together, and Monica pushed the door without knocking before. As soon as she pushed it open, she saw George with red eyes and an old diary in his hand.

Candice took a look and found the diary a little strange but familiar. It was as if she had seen it before. She even had the urge to take it and take a look. Why did she always have that feeling?

Moreover, some inexplicable images had been flashing in her mind recently.

When she thought about it deeper, there was nothing, but when she was not thinking about anything, her mind was filled with images!
