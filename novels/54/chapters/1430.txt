Chapter 1431: Monica Is Pregnant With Twins

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thank you readers!

He did not know when Finn was at the door of the ward, nor did he know how much of the conversation between him and Monica he had overheard.

He just wanted to make things clear with Finn.

“I know,” Finn said bluntly.

“However, Monica will not get back together with you because of the children.” Brandon was also direct. “I don’t want to be the third party between you two. In fact, if Monica still has a chance to be with you, I won’t interfere in your relationship. However, you heard how determined Monica was just now. ” “I won’t let go,” Finn warned Brandon.

“It’s not a matter of whether you want to let go or not. It’s Monica who doesn’t accept you at all.”

“She will accept me.”

“If she will accept you, she won’t be so hesitant about keeping the child in her belly.”

“Since she is hesitating, it means she still has hope for us.”

“No, it’s just because she can’t bear to part with two lives. Children have never been the reason for whether you could be together or not.”

Finn’s expression was very cold.

He clenched his fists tightly and was rendered speechless by Brandon’s words.

“Monica has really given up on you. Although you can’t accept it and I don’t know why she is so determined to give up on you, since you both have taken things to this extent, I hope you can be a little magnanimous and respect Monica’s choice. Don’t make things difficult for each other.”

Finn stared at Brandon coldly for a long time.

Brandon could tell that Finn was in pain. However, feelings were not everything. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He continued, “Finn, let go. I will definitely take good care of her.”

“I won’t let go.” Finn was very certain.

“If you don’t let go, you’ll force your children to their deaths.” Brandon was not threatening Finn.

Based on his understanding of Monica, if Finn was really desperate and crossed Monica’s boundaries, she could really give up on those two children.

“She won’t do that!” Finn gritted his teeth.

“When people are desperate, they can do anything. I’m just reminding you from my perspective.” Brandon said, “I hope you and Monica can part on good terms.”

“There’s just a conflict between us…” Finn was finding excuses for himself.

They had loved each other for ten years, and a relationship of ten years could not be worthless.

“But that conflict haunts Monica ’til this day. You can’t resolve it.”

“I can.” Finn’s expression was extremely grim from being provoked.

“In that case, give it a try.” Brandon did not want to say anything more. Finn’s expression was cold. “Brandon, can you not kick me when I’m down?

Brandon looked at Finn.

“The child is mine, so Monica and I should form a family. At a time like this, you really shouldn’t come between us.” Finn condemned Brandon from a moral standpoint.

At that moment, Brandon fell silent.

“If you’re doing this for Monica’s sake — if you really like Monica, you should do her this favor when she’s pregnant with my child.”

“But Monica doesn’t accept you,” Brandon retorted.

“How do you know that she won’t accept me when she’s pregnant?” Finn asked him.

Brandon was convinced, and the arrogance he had before was gone. It was because he was a good person that he could not do anything to hurt others. Finn was very smart. In just a few sentences, he had found Brandon’s Achilles’ heel.

“Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish.” Brandon suddenly compromised.

It happened so fast that even Finn was a little surprised.

He knew very well that Brandon liked Monica, especially because he was his love rival. However, he did not expect Brandon to agree so quickly.

Was it because Brandon did not want to be a father and that was why he forced himself to let go? Or… did he really love Monica so much that he had lost himself?

“One month.” Brandon said, “If Monica still refuses to be with you after a month, I will pursue her again. Then, I won’t hold back!” Finn remained silent for a moment before saying, “Alright.” At the very least, he had bought himself a month’s time..
