985 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

Jeanne nodded.

They had to go now to give Brie some time to make preparations and leave behind evidence.

Otherwise, if Brie trusted Michael completely and did not leave anything for herself, it would be useless even if Brie saw through Michael’s true colors. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Alright.” Mason nodded.

“I’m going to get changed. Wait for me at the entrance of the hotel.”

“Okay.” Mason nodded.

With that, Jeanne quickly got changed and went downstairs.

For convenience’s sake, when Jeanne left Cardellini Enterprise in the morning, she took one of the Cardellinis’ family cars with her. Mason was now driving that car toward their destination.

Amid the silence, Mason suddenly said, “Millie has attacked Lucy.”

Jeanne frowned.

“I just received news that Millie deliberately sent away Lucy away to carry out an assassination. The assassination target was a small fry, and the cost wasn’t high. According to the quote, the middle and low-level assassins in the Hills could do it, but Millie wanted Lucy to go.” Mason repeated.

“What happened after?” Jeanne was actually rather calm.

She felt that Millie’s actions should have been within Lucy’s plan.

Lucy had taught her all of her reasoning and stratagems, so if Lucy wanted to deal with someone innocent, it would be as easy as ABC.

“Lucy went. And for this mission, we analyzed that the best method was to kill the target through seduction. In other words, Lucy had to dress up as a call girl to seduce the target and then kill the target in bed.”

Jeanne sneered.

Millie could really think of something.

“As an assassin, it’s not difficult to seduce a man with your body to achieve your goal. Lucy also listened to the suggestion and went to the scene. She deliberately made it seem like she didn’t realize that Millie had bribed another assassin to kill her while she was on a mission. She wanted to create the illusion that Lucy failed the mission and died so that she could get rid of Lucy completely.”

“Millie is too full of herself. She probably doesn’t even know who she’s facing! She probably doesn’t even know how Lucy managed to become Kingsley’s woman for so long!” Jeanne mocked.

“Indeed. So, Lucy easily got rid of the man that the Hills wanted to kill and the other assassin who wasn’t from the Hills but had been bribed by Millie. As expected, Millie’s evidence was left behind. Everything was within her calculations, but…” Mason hesitated.

“But what?”

“Lucy didn’t expect Mr. Thorn to be so ruthless.” The expression on Mason’s cold face was unreadable.

Perhaps it was because she did not understand Kingsley, but at the end of the day, an assassin did not feel much.

He said, “When Lucy was carrying out her mission, she drank the aphrodisiac that Millie had the assassin put in her mouth to avoid suspicion. Millie probably knew that Lucy was not easy to deal with, so she played a dirty trick. She thought that it would be easier to deal with Lucy when the drug took effect and Lucy was out of her mind. However, she didn’t expect Lucy to have completed the mission cleanly and beautifully before the drug had even taken effect. The drug only took effect when she was done with everything.”

“So…” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“The Hills would always arrange at least two people on a mission. This time, Lucy’s partner was a mid-level killer, Kerby. He just joined the Hills not long ago, so you probably don’t know him. However, when I was training assassins, I realized that his aptitude was not bad and that he had room for improvement. So, I’ve been contacting him privately and giving him some advice from time to time.” Mason’s tone was still flat and cold. “Logically speaking, Kerby should’ve helped Lucy in the face of that situation.”

“I bet he didn’t dare to, right?” Jeanne could figure it out immediately.

“It’s not that he didn’t dare to. It’s a matter of propriety.” Mason chose to put it in a nicer way. Perhaps he really admired Kerby, so he was biased toward him. He said, “Everyone in the Hills knows that Lucy is Mr. Thorn’s woman. If it were me, I would also report to Mr. Thorn.”

“Did Kingsley leave Lucy to fend for herself after Kerby reported it to him?”
