Chapter 121: Ms. Lawrence Should Treat Me With “Courtesy”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Outside of the Lawrence Enterprise’s main building.

Edward’s car was parked there in a flamboyant manner.

Jeanne smiled. “Fourth master, it’s so late. Is there something you need me for?”

“There’s something I need you for,” Edward replied.

“What is it?”

“Get in the car and we’ll talk.”

Jeanne really did not want to get in the car.

However, at that moment, she bit her lip and got in the car.

She already rejected Fourth Master Swan the last time.

After all, the two of them had an agreement.

She sat beside Fourth Master Swan as the car drove steadily on the road.

“Fourth Master, what’s the matter?” Jeanne took the initiative to ask.

Edward turned her head and looked at Jeanne.

He said in a low and magnetic voice, “I miss you.”

“...”

Could she pretend that she did not hear him?

“Have you eaten dinner?” Fourth Master Swan was not at all embarrassed by what he said.

“I have.”

“Just eat a little with me since you’ve eaten.”

“...”

‘Why did you even bother asking me? I will have to eat with you whether I have or have not eaten.’

The car soon stopped at the high-class restaurant that Fourth Master Swan had brought her to previously.

When Jeanne paid the bill last time, she finally noticed the name of this restaurant.

The name was very special, it was called “Chez Jeanne”.

The name was somewhat similar to her name, so it was very easy to remember.

The private room that Fourth Master Swan brought her into was still the same as the previous one.

It was probably the best location in this restaurant.

The beautiful night view of the river surrounding South Hampton City was clear to the eye.

Fourth Master Swan ordered his own food, and the two of them remained silent.

Jeanne’s phone rang.

She took a look at the incoming call and was about to answer it when her phone screen suddenly went blank.

She had been busy the whole day and did not charge her phone at all. When she got off work, she realized that her phone had run out of battery. However, she thought that she would be going back soon, so she did not bother charging it. At this moment, her phone had turned off by itself.

She pursed her lips and waved her hand. Just as she was about to ask the waiter to give her a charger, a white phone was placed in front of her.

Jeanne frowned.

“Spare phone. You can use it first,” Fourth Master Swan said.

Jeanne was slightly startled.

Teddy, who was standing at the side, was a little unhappy.

That was clearly his phone.

His master actually gave his phone out just like that.

Jeanne hesitated for a moment, but still took it.

She used the toothpick on the dining table to take out her SIM card and put it into Fourth Master Swan’s spare phone. She input the number from memory and dialed it back to the caller just now. As she dialed, she left the dining table and walked to the side, “Forrest, my phone ran out of battery just now.”

“Yes,” Forrest replied. “Director Lawrence, are you off work?”

“I just left. Are you still working overtime?”

“I have some things to settle,” Forrest replied and said, “I’m just reporting to you that I’m going to the logistics warehouse to check on the construction progress tomorrow. I won’t be arriving at the company first.”

“Okay,” Jeanne agreed.

Usually, she would not interfere too much with her subordinates’ work arrangements.

“Then I won’t bother you anymore.”

“Bye.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She returned to her seat.

At this moment, the food was being served one after another.

Fourth Master Swan waited until she sat on the chair before picking up his chopsticks and eating slowly. “Are you very busy?”

“I’ve been a little busy recently.”

“Eat Something,” Fourth Master Swan urged.

“Okay.” Jeanne also picked up her chopsticks.

Truth be told, she did not have time to eat dinner. It was just an excuse to go back.

However, now that she was already here, there was no need for her to pretend anymore.

She ate quietly one bite at a time.

Edward glanced at her, and an imperceptible smile appeared on his face.

Dinner was not long. After all, it was already late.

When Fourth Master Swan asked Teddy to sign the bill, Jeanne took the initiative to say, “Last time, Fourth Master treated me to a meal. This time, let me do the honors instead. I can’t always make you spend money on me.”

“Ms. Lawrence, why do you seem like you want to cut off all ties with me?”

“It’s just a return of the favor.” Jeanne naturally could not admit it like that.

Fourth Master Swan did not say anything more.

Jeanne let the waiter swipe her card to settle the bill.

Fourth Master Swan still sent Jeanne back home in the end.

In the car, it was quiet most of the time.

Jeanne was a little bored.

To avoid awkwardness, she picked up her phone and played with it.

She did not actually want to see anything. She just did not want to sit around with Fourth Master Swan like this.

She did not even remember that the phone in her hand was not hers.

She casually swiped the screen and opened some apps.

In the quiet car…

Suddenly, there was a strange sound.

Jeanne was stunned.

What did she just open?

What was on the screen now? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When Fourth Master Swan heard the sound, he unconsciously glanced at her screen.
