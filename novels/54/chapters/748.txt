Chapter 749: She Couldn’t Please Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m being followed.” Finn changed the subject.

Nox’s voice turned serious. “What?”

“I noticed it yesterday, but I couldn’t be sure. I went out today just to confirm my suspicions and realized that someone was indeed following me.” Finn’s eyes narrowed. “It’s not just one or two people on my tail.”

“Was it obvious that you went to see him yesterday?” Nox’s face darkened.

“I don’t think so,” Finn speculated. “If it was, they wouldn’t have sent so many people to follow me. It’s precisely because they want more information from me. But I’m guessing they know that I went to see him yesterday.”

“Be careful. I’ll tell Edward about this.”

“Alright.”

Nox hung up and quickly called Edward Swan.

Edward said, “Hold your horses for now.”

“What if...” Nox was worried.

“As long as Finn doesn’t go there, no one will find him. Once the wound on his face heals, we’ll let him show his face around South Hampton City. We just need to lay low for now.”

“Understood.”

Nox was unconditionally obedient to Edward.

He called and spoke to Finn before returning to his bed, intending to get more.

At that moment, Nox heard some noise in the house. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He frowned.

Nox put on a white bathrobe and walked to the living room.

In the living room, a person was busy cooking.

“Shelly?” Nox said.

He just woke up not long ago and this girl is already in his line of sight, such… annoyance.

Shelly was shocked by Nox’s sudden appearance. She was cooking noodles for herself and was about to put the noodles into the pot when Nox’s voice made her hand tremble. The hot water splashed on the back of her hand and her skin turned red.

She gritted her teeth and looked up at Nox. “You’re awake?”

“When did you get here?” Nox asked.

Shelly doesn’t actually live here full time.

Nox hadn’t seen Shelly visit in the few days he’d been back so he thought she’d had the sense to move while he was gone.

It turns out that she was still haunting him.

“Last night,” Shelly replied.

Nox Winter’s face darkened.

As there was no one else at home, he did not close the door when he brought the girl back last night.

Shelly seemed to read Nox’s mind. She said, “I’m used to it.”

‘I’m used to it?’

Nox Winter felt nauseous.

Shelly Carter was definitely different from all the women he knew.

Even prostitutes would not be as calm as her when it came to this topic.

She’s not shy when she stumbles upon such a scene, nor did she feel awkward when someone else stumbled upon her watching porn.

Was there something wrong with this woman’s brain?

“Isn’t it Monday today? Aren’t you going to school?” Nox’s temper was short-fused.

He really didn’t have the patience to deal with Shelly Carter.

“I came back for lunch.”

“Is there no cafeteria at school?”

“You haven’t eaten, have you?” Shelly asked.

Nox was stunned.

Shelly placed a bowl of noodles on the dining table and returned to the kitchen with another bowl.

Then, she took out two sets of cutleries.

One was placed next to him, and the other pair was for herself. Without a moment’s hesitation, she started eating.

Shelly Carter ate quietly.

Eating noodles usually comes with slurping sounds, but Shelly made none. In fact, she made it look refined.

Nox felt that the scene did not match Shelly’s personality.

He never knew that the reason why she paid so much attention to dining etiquette was because of him. When Shelly first came to the Winters, she always smacked her lips when she ate. Nox despised her very much for it. At that time, Shelly didn’t know that there were dining etiquettes during mealtimes. She always thought that eating would be a noisy affair.

But due to that, she tried very hard to learn to eat quietly.

In order not to make a sound, she would take her time with her meal. Shelly would not finish eating even after everyone had left the table.

After that, for a long time, she starved herself.

At this moment, she did not eat much.

She didn’t make much noodles because she was trying to lose weight.

It was easy to gain weight with just carbs, but that was all that’s available in the house.

She was almost done eating when Nox sat down and ate.

He was baffled. It’s been nothing but noodles for the past two days!

It was the same at Edward’s, and now Shelly also made noodles for him.

Nox was actually quite hungry after sleeping for so long.

It was probably because he was hungry that he felt that the noodles tasted really good.

He even drank the soup after finishing the noodles.

Shelly watched him finish his meal before she cleared the dishes and brought it to the kitchen to wash them.

Nox sat on the sofa like the entitled man he was. Patriarchy was full and satisfied.

He looked at Shelly, who was busy in the open kitchen, and said, “Don’t think I’ll like you just because you made me a bowl of noodles. You can’t please me.”

‘You can’t please me.’

Shelly thought about it and agreed.

The first time she entered the Winters, she knew why she was allowed to live with such a luxurious family. Therefore, she needed to please the boy named Nox Winter, because only when that boy liked her could she stay.

That was why when they first met, she took the initiative to hug that boy.

However, before she could approach him, that boy pushed her away and she fell to the ground.

She heard him say, “It’s filthy!”

The first thing he said to her was, ‘It’s filthy.’

The second sentence was, “Don’t come near me in the future! Disgusting!”

She was only eight years old.
