1376 Do I Have To Dig My Heart Out For You To See It?

“Stop talking!” Monica really did not want to anger Finn at that moment.

No matter what their relationship was, saying such words at a time like that would only provoke Finn, and she did not want to kill anyone just yet!

She said, “Let go of me, both of you! Let go!”

Neither of the two men compromised.

In fact, Monica could see that Finn’s grip was getting tighter and tiger. He was using so much strength that Brandon’s face had turned from red to pale.

She was really afraid that Brandon’s hand would be crippled if the situation went on.

Hence, she tried her best to control her emotions and said to Finn, “Finn, what do you want?! What do you want from me?”

“Does your heart ache for him that much?” Finn asked.

His voice was very cold.

“It’s been so many years. Isn’t it enough? Can’t you see how unsuitable we are for each other? How badly do you want us to hurt each other? How should I tell you so that you’ll know that I risked my life for you and got into a car accident because I was depressed? I don’t need you to take responsibility at all. Even if it’s your responsibility, three years are enough to call it even. We’re done!” Monica’s emotions that she could not suppress anymore erupted.

Finn’s throat moved up and down.

“Back then, I pursued you because I was young and insensible. I didn’t know we would bring so much harm to each other because of the difference in our upbringing. I didn’t know that falling in love with you at sight for you back then and my impulsiveness would cause so many sad things to happen between us. If I knew, I would never have taken the initiative to get close to you. I would never pursue you like a madman. If there was a next life, I would definitely stay far away from you. I would definitely avoid you!”

“Were your feelings for me just on a whim?” Finn asked her coldly.

“From the looks of it now, it seems like it!” Monica gave an affirmative answer.

The maliciousness in Finn’s eyes was obvious.

“We’re not from the same world. We were wrong for each other from the beginning! My living environment, my pursuits, your living environment, your pursuits… We have nothing in common. I used to think that love could change everything and break all odds, but only now do I realize that love would only make me more stupid! Finn, I’ve really had enough of this relationship!”

“I haven’t had enough!” Finn suddenly lost control of his voice. He even sounded like he was going mad. “If you’ve had enough fun, that’s your problem, but I haven’t had enough!”

“Finn, can you not be so mean!” Monica looked at him with reddened eyes, “When I chose to leave you to help Michael, how did I treat you?! I didn’t think we would break up at first, but in the end, I let you go. I accepted that you didn’t love me and endured everything. Why can’t you let go of me when you clearly don’t love me?”

“I love you!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t believe it!” Monica insisted.

She did not believe that Finn loved her. Perhaps Finn had no idea what love was. He did not love Patsy or Sarah, and it was the same for her.

Now, he was just too selfish to accept that the woman who had been by his side for so many years wanted to leave.

“Finn, you will always love yourself the most. You don’t know how to love others at all.” Monica accused Finn, “And I don’t have the ability to make you fall in love with me.”

Finn’s eyes were red. What Monica said made him… uncomfortable.

He thought that his relationship with Monica had stabilized.

After being together for so many years, they were finally back together. They were living together and could see each other every day, and he thought that was eternity.

Monica, on the other hand, felt that he did not love her. In fact, she did not think he knew what love was.

As he hesitated, his Adam’s apple bobbed. He was constantly trying to suppress his emotions.

Monica was also trying her best to calm herself down. She said, “Finn, I’ve lost hope over the past three years.”

There were many things that she did not want to say. However, she suddenly felt that if she did not make things clear, Finn might not be willing to break up with her.

She said, “I started over with you not because I loved you very much, but because I thought I still loved you and that our relationship could be revived. But, I didn’t. In the past three years, everything I’ve experienced with you has made me lose all hope not only in relationships but in love. I’ve wasted my love on you for so many years that I’m afraid of falling in love again. I’m really afraid that one day, I’ll suffer from depression again, but I can’t die! Finn, can you let us and our relationship go so that we can both live the life we deserve?”
