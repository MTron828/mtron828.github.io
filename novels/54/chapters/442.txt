Chapter 443: Humiliating Eden In Public

The more Henry spoke, the more he felt that Jeanne was spouting nonsense, and the more he looked down on her.

“I agree with your point of view.” Jeanne nodded.

“In that case, why are you here today? To attract everyone’s attention? To let all of us know that you’re the second largest shareholder of Swan Enterprise? For you to show off to us that Edward gave all of his shares to you?” Henry’s sarcasm could not be any more obvious.

“Brother, I don’t think I’m as stupid as you think to use this method to highlight my status.” Jeanne smiled.

She smirked at Henry’s point of view.

Henry’s expression was a little ugly.

“Let’s not talk about anything else!” Henry did not seem to want to get into an argument with Jeanne. “If you don’t have concrete evidence to prove that Eden did such a thing...”

Henry smiled again.

This time, it was a sarcastic smile as if he thought it was impossible for Eden to do such a thing!

He said again, “I think our meeting today can end here. I really don’t want to waste my time on this nonsense. Everyone part of the senior management has their own work to do, and we don’t have time to fool around with you.”

After that, he said to Edward, “Edward, when there’s a senior management meeting in the future, please let us know the subject of the meeting in advance. I personally think that we don’t have to be here for some unimportant meeting. The time we wasted today can be considered as me showing you respect. But in the future, I hope you won’t use your authority to do things that don’t conform to your status...”

“Brother.” Jeanne interrupted him.

Henry’s expression darkened. “On a formal occasion, please address me by my position.”

“Director Henry.” Jeanne addressed him differently and was not embarrassed.

However, Henry did not appreciate her kindness. “Since you can’t give me a reason, let’s end today’s meeting here.”

After that, he stood up and prepared to leave.

“May I ask if you’ve ever given me a chance to speak in this meeting? From the beginning to the end, it was you and Eden who kept denying that this matter was funny and ridiculous. Did you give me a chance to prove that this funny and ridiculous matter is real?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“Because I’m certain this matter doesn’t exist, so I don’t want to waste my time with you!” Henry insisted.

“What makes you think that it doesn’t exist?”

“I believe in Eden.” Henry was very certain. “He was groomed by me since he was young and received the highest level of education. He is more than capable. How could he make such a low-level mistake?”

“Of course, he won’t make a mistake...”

“Since he won’t, what else is there to say?” Henry just did not want Jeanne to speak.

Every single thing she said was directly hit back at her halfway through.

Jeanne’s expression was clearly a little ugly.

It was obvious.

Henry was deliberately targeting her so that she could not speak in front of the senior management and tell them the whole story. He just did not give her the chance to verify everything.

He just wanted to make her leave in a sorry state, right?

Edward’s expression changed.

Just as he was about to speak, Jeanne’s slender fingers directly pressed onto Edward’s lips.

The touch of her palm made Edward pause for a moment, and he even kissed her.

‘That pervert!’ Jeanne thought as she retracted her palm without reacting to him.

She did not need Edward to help her.

To be more precise, she did not want all the senior management here to think that she was easy to bully and that she needed Edward’s protection.

Jeanne looked at Henry with a serious expression. “Director Henry, you keep interrupting me. Since you don’t want me to speak, does this mean you have a guilty conscience?”

“What nonsense are you spouting?” Henry flew into a rage.

“Otherwise, is interrupting someone like this your usual style?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

It was obvious that she was questioning Henry’s upbringing.

Henry’s expression turned grim. He said fiercely, “I just don’t want to waste everyone’s time!”

“What do you mean by waste?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, her presence seemed stronger as she asked word by word, “As a director of the company and the second largest shareholder, don’t I have the right to have everyone sit down for a meeting? !”

Henry was speechless.

He was silent for a few seconds before he retorted, “It’s not that you don’t have the right, but even if you have a high status, you still need a reasonable reason for everyone to sit down and have a meeting. Even the chairman has his reason for having a meeting. As for you, I really don’t know what your purpose is! Is it to deliberately suppress Eden? Is it to show that you’re dissatisfied with Eden’s work? Jeanne, are you using your current status to benefit yourself?”
