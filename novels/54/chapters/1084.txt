1085 Great Satisfaction, Michael’s Tragic End

“During your time in Cardellini Pharmaceutical, did you help Michael to steal Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development information?” Judah pressed.

Rob did not dare to answer.

“Rob, please answer me truthfully!” Judah’s tone was heavy.

Startled, Rob quickly said, “Yes. Back then, Michael told me to enter Cardellini Pharmaceutical to steal their research and development information so that he can use them to sell in one of his markets. While I was working at Cardellini Enterprise’s Research and Development Institute, I stole the research and development technology of six kinds of drugs for Michael, including the gastric medicine and the hepatitis B vaccine produced by Sunny Pharmaceutical on the market...”

All the medicines were listed.

Then, he added, “Including the micro hydroxyl technology that Cardellini Pharmaceutical has patented.”

“How do you prove that it was Michael who ordered you to do this?” Judah went straight to the point.

“I have chat records with Michael, as well as the records of the money Michael transferred to me,” Rob answered.

“Please show me your record.”

“Yes.” Rob quickly took out his bank statement. “This is all the transactions between me and Michael. Once I get the copy of the technology for a drug, he will transfer two million dollars to my account, usually in four separate payments.”

Judah took the bank statement and handed it to the judge and the jury.

This time, there was no need for the bank to verify because the transaction was directly from Michael’s account.

It was probably because they were relatives, so having transfer records with each other would not arouse too much suspicion. More importantly, Michael did not expect Monica to go so far as to prove his crimes.

From the defendant’s seat, Michael looked at Monica coldly. At that moment, he even wanted to tear her into pieces.

“This is my chat history with Michael,” Rob said. Then, he took out his phone, clicked on his WhatsApp chat with Michael, and explained, “Although he kept asking me to delete the records, I was still very careful. After all, his payments were divided into four separate payments, and I was worried that he would owe me money.”

Judah took Rob’s phone from his hand again and looked at the chat history.

The chat records recorded in detail the entire process of Rob stealing the research and development technology from Cardellini Pharmaceutical for Michael.

Again, there were witnesses and material evidence, so Michael did not need to refute to be sentenced directly.

The judge and the jury seemed to have a clear understanding of Michael’s crime. The judge asked Michael, “Regarding the plaintiff, Monica’s accusation that you stole Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development technology, do you have anything to say to defend yourself?”

Michael was furious, but he did not say a word.

“If you remain silent, the court will take it that you admit to the plaintiff’s accusations of you.”

Still, Michael did not speak.

With that, the court tacitly accepted Michael’s guilty plea.

“Your Honor,” Monica suddenly said as she wanted to make it clear. “According to Harken’s laws, the person who stole Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development technology for commercial use for other pharmaceutical companies will be punished by the law. However, will Sunny Pharmaceutical, who violated the rules and used Cardellini Enterprise’s technology, also receive the corresponding punishment?”

“If the main shareholder of Sunny Pharmaceutical is the one who stole the research and development technology, he will be punished according to his crimes. If it was not done by the main shareholder, we will investigate according to the law whether Sunny Pharmaceutical knew and acquiesced to the fact that the person had stolen another company’s technology and used it for commercial production. If they did, they will be punished by law. If they didn’t, they will only be punished for the stolen research and development technology.”

“Thank you, Your Honor,” Monica said respectfully. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The General Manager of Sunny Pharmaceutical had already made it clear that the person with most of the shares was Michael.

It meant that Sunny Pharmaceutical would receive the highest punishment.

“The plaintiff, Monica, do you have any objections or additional remarks to the case?” the judge asked her.

“No, I don’t. Thank you, Your Honor.”

The judge stood up and announced, “May the members of the jury adjourn from the court for the trial while the others wait!”

As the judge and the jury left the court, the court was still silent, maintaining a solemn atmosphere.

Only then did Monica turn to look at Michael, who was trying his best to hold it all in.

His eyes were also fixed on Monica as if he wanted to kill her.

However, to Monica, it could no longer hurt her.
