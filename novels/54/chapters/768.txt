Chapter 769: Jenifer Playing Tricks, An Exciting Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The originally silent scene went into an uproar again.

Who could watch that scene without doing anything?

Jenifer had always been good at acting, but this time, her acting skills were at their peak.

Jeanne also really admired the person who had instructed Jenifer to do that. It only took them one night to come up with the idea of framing her and having her bear all the responsibility.

As expected, she was surprised.

She squatted down and said, “Mother, if you put on such a big show, you will humiliate yourself even more. Are you sure you want to do this to me?”

Her tone was neither cold nor warm, but it was threatening.

Of course, Jenifer was still shocked, but she could only bite the bullet and continue on.

She was almost scared to death when Joshua was captured yesterday. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She had no idea that Eden and Joshua had plotted such a scheme. If she had known, she would have never allowed Joshua to do so. She knew that they could provoke anyone but the Sanders. However, since things had come to this, she had no time to blame her son. She could only follow Eden’s arrangements and accuse Jeanne early in the morning.

That was the only way to reduce Joshua’s crime and defeat Jeanne in one fell swoop.

In any case, Jenifer had thought it through. If they were going to die, we would die together!

There was no way she would allow Jeanne to lead a good life.

Moreover, once Joshua and Jeanne were in prison, Lawrence Enterprise would be all hers. Although she did not know much about business, she could get someone to take care of the company until her son was released from prison. Then, everything would belong to her son.

It was only a matter of time.

“Jeanne, it’s useless for you to say anything now. I won’t continue to be such a coward. I won’t continue to swallow my anger.” Jenifer still pretended to be pitiful. “As the saying goes, a mother is strong. For my son, I really won’t be kind anymore.”

Jeanne felt that it was not worth it to waste even another second on Jenifer, so she kicked Jenifer away.

In fact, she did not even use much strength. However, Jenifer fell to the ground, and it looked like she had fallen badly.

The reporters at the scene got so agitated that they almost went up to hit Jeanne.

If it were not for the security guards keeping those people under control, a fight might have started.

In the history of Harken, there had never been a live interview that involved a riot.

Of course, it was not entirely because of what happened to Jenifer. Most importantly, someone was secretly controlling it.

After kicking Jenifer away, Jeanne sat down and faced all the reporters in front of her.

She said, “I’m not the one who has been wanting to get Lawrence Enterprise for myself. It’s Jenifer and Joshua. However, the Lawrence Enterprise is the Lawrences’ family business, and I can’t hand over the company to the incapable Joshua. If I hand it over to him, the company will be doomed. Think about it. When my mother developed Lawrence Enterprise to its peak, my father killed my mother in order to take back the company. Once he got the company’s management rights, I’m sure everyone saw how the company developed. And I have to say, if I didn’t come back to discuss the e-commerce project and change up the company, Lawrence Enterprise would have declared bankruptcy!”

“However, this can’t be the reason for you to use any means to get Lawrence Enterprise’s shares!” the reporter berated her.

“Don’t you guys think that the plot is shockingly similar?” Jeanne said, “Because I’ve developed the Lawrence Enterprise to its peak and taken control of the Lawrence Enterprise, some people can’t hold back anymore.”

“Jeanne, you’re spouting nonsense! I know you’re capable, and that is why I’ve always wanted Joshua to learn from you. I have never thought of framing you! Besides, I’ve seen what happened to your dad. I’m not so stupid as to repeat the same mistake.” Jenifer got up from the ground and said righteously.

“Well, I wouldn’t be so stupid to get Lawrence Enterprise’s shares in this way! Mother, I already have control of Lawrence Enterprise. Are the shares still important to me?” Jeanne retorted.

“Why is it not important? The shares are money. Don’t you want money?”

“Even if I wanted it, I wouldn’t risk my life for that measly amount of money.” Jeanne said disdainfully, “On the other hand, you really are something else for accusing me like this after your son’s plan failed. Once you succeed in accusing me, Joshua and I will go to jail, and you’ll be the only one managing Lawrence Enterprise. Then, you’ll be enjoying the fruits of others’ labor.”
