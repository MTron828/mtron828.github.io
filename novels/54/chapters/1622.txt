Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I beg you, don’t treat my family like this. My matters have nothing to do with them…

“A child’s poor behavior is the parents’ fault. Your parents are to blame for not educating you well, and they deserve to be taught a lesson!” Nox said coldly.

Zoe was frightened by Nox’s appearance. In the past, when they were dating,

Nox would listen to whatever she said. Now, everything she said was useless.

Nox did not want to waste his breath on Zoe, so he forcefully pushed Zoe away, wanting to chase her out.

“Nox, I’ll take my things with me,” Zoe said anxiously as Nox pushed her away.

Nox seemed to pause for a moment before saying, “Just looking at you annoys me, and I’ll be throwing your things away. If you want them, go pick them up from the trash.”

“Nox… ”

“Get lost!” Nox pushed Zoe away. Then, he slammed the door shut.

Zoe stared at the tightly shut door, not expecting Nox to be so heartless.

However, she then gritted her teeth and turned around to leave. After all, she Imew that she could not persuade Nox about anything.

On the car ride home, she still cried because of how heartless Nox was toward her.

At that moment, she looked at her phone, which suddenly rang, and answered the call. “Dad.”

“What did Nox say?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Nox said that he would withdraw his investment immediately. He also said that he would destroy The Sullivan Group.”

“Was he really that heartless?” Mr. Sullivan was clearly agitated.

“Yeah.”

“That won’t do!”

“There’s nothing I can do. I almost knelt down to beg Nox just now, but he ignored me.”

“This cannot be the end for our family.” “I don’t want to either, but…” “I’m going to look for Nox’s parents.”

“Alright.” Zoe nodded.

She did not know things would end up like that. If she knew… She just could not control herself from the temptation, but she regretted it so much now that she wished she was dead.

At the thought that she might lose everything and make their family bankrupt… No, she could not accept it!

Just then, her phone rang again. Zoe looked at the incoming call and did not want to answer it, so she immediately hung up the call. Despite that, her phone kept ringing.

Infuriated, Zoe yelled, “Cody, I’m not in the mood to talk to you right now. Don’t look for me!” “I’m here to help you.”

“I don’t need your help! Get lost!

“Zoe, do you think you are still the young lady of the Sullivans? Why so arrogant? You’re just a piece of trash!”

“Cody, you b*stard!” Zoe cursed and screamed.

She did not expect to be bashed by Cody like that.

“I’m here to save you from suffering more humiliation, but seeing how ungrateful you are, you deserve to be destroyed by Nox.”

“What can you help me with? You don’t know anything, you freeloader!”

“Zoe!” Cody’s face turned extremely ugly from Zoe’s scolding.

Zoe did not want to waste any more time with Cody and was about to hang up.

However, she heard him say, “I just wanted to tell you that the entire Internet is saying that you cheated on Nox, but you can say that Nox cheated on you too! This way, you won’t be the only one to take the blame!”

“How can I say that Nox also cheated on me…”

“Have you f*cking forgotten? We recorded a video of Nox sleeping with a waitress.”

Zoe was stunned.

At that time, she had only negotiated terms with Nox in case her affair was discovered, and that way, they would both be forgiven. Unexpectedly, Nox admitted to his affair, and she forgave him. Now, that matter did not even cross her mind.

“You can also be the victim!” Cody said fiercely.

Zoe fell silent, probably because saw a glimmer of hope.

“So, don’t think I’m useless. If I didn’t ask you to come up with that plan, you would be done for right now. I’ll give you two suggestions. If you really want to go all out with Nox, tell the media that you did what you did because Nox cheated on you too. That way, in your broken marriage, you are at most an accomplice, not the murderer. Otherwise, you can use this to threaten Nox so that he won’t destroy The Sullivan Group and it’ll save the company.”

“I’ll think about it. Don’t do anything rash..”
