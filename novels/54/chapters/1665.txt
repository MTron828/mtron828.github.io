Chapter 1666: Monica Takes A Jab At Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox’s shamelessness had pushed Shelly to her limit, and his sudden actions even made her suspect that he was up to something!

She did not think that Nox liked her. On the contrary, she thought that Nox was trying to make her suffer! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Shelly’s hand that was holding the phone was trembling with anger. She gritted her teeth and said, “Nox, I’ll say it again. No matter what your motive is, I don’t like you and will never like you no matter what you do! I don’t want your things. Take them back, or I’ll throw them away!”

“Throw it.” Nox replied nonchalantly, “I have a lot of money anyway, what I gave you is nothing to me!”

“You’re sick!” Shelly could not help but curse!

She found Nox crazy.

Nox, however, was not angry when Shelly scolded him. Instead, he smiled. “You finally realized that I’m lovesick!”

Shelly hung up. Then, without a second thought, she threw all the goods in the living room out the door, while Benjamin looked at her going crazy.

After she was done, she slammed the door shut and then looked up at Benjamin, who was still standing there with flowers in his hands.

When their eyes met, Shelly said, “Nox is crazy. Don’t worry about him.”

Benjamin smiled and nodded. Although he did not make any comments, he felt a little upset. He did not think that Shelly would like Nox, but if Nox kept harassing Shelly like that… He was going to be away for a year, so he would not be able to be there for Shelly.

“I like it very much” Shelly took the flowers from Benjamin.

He could tell that she hated Nox’s gifts but was very happy with his, even though his gift was so cheap compared to Nox’s. “Shelly,” Benjamin called her name seriously.

“Hm?” Shelly smiled.

No woman could ever say no to flowers. Moreover, it was a gift from someone she liked.

“I’ll work hard to make your life better in the future,” Benjamin promised.

Shelly nodded. “I know.”

In fact, she did not need Benjamin to give her a better life. Now, she realized there was nothing wrong with living an ordinary life, and what she wanted the most was a stable relationship.

Nox had left the police station. In the car, he was a little angry because Shelly scolded him and even hung up the call on him.

He had no idea when Shelly had started acting so arrogantly before him. Had she not wanted to marry him since she was young? Now that he had given her a chance to marry him, why was she hiding?

While Nox was fuming, his phone suddenly rang, and he answered the call angrily.

“Mr. Nox, the things you gave Ms. Carter were all left at the door.”

“F*ck! Does she know how expensive those things are?” Nox was about to fly off the handle again.

“Maybe not,” the other party replied nervously, “because she probably didn’t even look at it. She took out whatever was given to her.”

Then, the other party asked again, “How should we deal with those things?”

“Take them back. Don’t you know they’re expensive?” Nox was so furious that he lashed out at the man.

“Yes, I’ll send it back to you immediately, Mr. Winter,” the other party said respectfully.

Nox abruptly hung up the phone. ‘Shelly! What’s so great about you?

When Monica went for a prenatal checkup, she saw Nox on the news, stating that he was pursuing Shelly.

The first time she saw it, she thought she was mistaken because she felt that the name “Shelly” was probably printed wrongly. However, only when she clicked on the news and saw Nox confessing his love to Shelly at her apartment that she finally believed the news.

Was that guy crazy to say that he liked Shelly? Had Zoe pissed him off so badly that he had gone crazy?

“Mrs. Jones, it’s your turn for the ultrasound,” the nurse said respectfully and gently to Monica.

Monica put down her phone and pondered for a while before deciding she would ask about the situation later. No matter what, she felt that Nox’s change in personality was a little scary..
