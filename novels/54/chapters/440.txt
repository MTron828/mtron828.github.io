Chapter 441: Humiliating Eden In Public

In Swan Enterprise’s senior management meeting room, the finger was directly pointed at Eden!

The entire place was silent for a moment, and everyone was stunned.

They all looked at Jeanne in unison and then at Eden.

Looking at Eden sitting on the other side, their expressions were extremely ugly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was already hard for him to accept that Jeanne had 8 percent of the Swan Enterprise’s original shares. Yet now, Jeanne was accusing him in front of so many of the senior management. After all, during that time, especially after he got married… he had been working hard to perform at work and obtain everyone’s approval.

He had to admit that he had a huge ambition.

His eyes were on his Fourth Uncle’s position, and he always thought he could one day ban his Fourth Uncle. However, he could not believe that during the rapid development of his career, Jeanne was publicly accusing him!

That woman!

Was that woman not looking for local suppliers to negotiate with and trying to convince them to stop the in-store bulk-buying campaign?

Then, almost in an instant, Eden realized Jeanne’s trick.

He found out that she was deliberately trying to confuse his attention and create a diversion to make him think that her focus was on the supplier. It never crossed his mind that she had changed her direction long ago, making it impossible for him to guard against her.

Eden gritted his teeth.

At that moment, even though Jeanne was accusing him, he was not particularly flustered.

......

Jeanne was smart — smart enough to think he might have done something behind the scenes. However, it was impossible for Jeanne to find any evidence against him. He even suspected that the woman was making such a big fuss because she wanted to use this to threaten him and make him admit that he had done something like that.

How ridiculous.

He, Eden, had been taught by the Swans since young, so he could remain calm at all times. Did Jeanne really think she could scare him with just a few words?

He looked at Jeanne and said unhurriedly, “Jeanne, what right do you have to say that an in-store bulk-buying activity in Minze District is related to Swanhaven Bank? I didn’t even know there was such a thing going on.”

When he said it, he even laughed sarcastically.

Jeanne looked at Eden.

She had expected that he would not admit it.

Before she could speak, Edward suddenly spoke. He said coldly to Eden, “In a formal setting, call her Director Lawrence.”

Since she was a shareholder, she was a director in Swan Enterprise.

Eden’s expression changed.

In front of his Fourth Uncle, he still had to be respectful. After all, his Fourth Uncle still had the final say in the Swans.

However, he would replace her one day.

“Usually, you can call her Fourth Aunt,” Edward added, her tone still stern. “But you can’t call her Jeanne.”

Eden suppressed his anger, but he looked furious.

He was supposed to call Jeanne his Fourth Aunt?

How could he call Jeanne his Fourth Aunt, which would make him lower in seniority than that woman!

He unconsciously clenched his fists and endured it.

“Madam, please continue.” Edward looked over at Jeanne with an amiable gaze. It was totally different compared to the way he looked at Eden earlier.

All the senior management present were a little surprised.

The impression Edward usually gave people was that he was cold, hard to approach, and did things cleanly and swiftly. He did not show any mercy.

Not to mention the employed senior manager here, even the members of the Swans, including Henry, the eldest son of the Swans, did not dare to go against Edward and would follow his word at work. Hence, him treating Jeanne like that at the moment… was a little hard for them to accept.

It was rumored that Fourth Master Swan married the eldest daughter of the Lawrences with rows of cars filled with flowers. Now, it seemed that was indeed an intentional act and not just a formality.

He really did not know how a second-hand good like the Lawrences’ eldest daughter had fallen in love with Fourth Master Swan and so deeply in love at that.

At that moment, Jeanne smiled faintly at Edward.

To everyone, they were showing off their affection with that interaction.

With that, Eden’s fists clenched even tighter!

He could not understand why his Fourth Uncle liked Jeanne so much!

What did he like about that woman?

He admitted that he was also attracted to Jeanne back then and really liked the woman. However, no matter how much he liked her, he could still be seduced by other women. When that woman ruined his reputation, he could also use all means to deal with her. Even now, he had no choice but to admit that he still felt like conquering that woman. Even if Jeanne could indeed make many men fall in love with her, his Fourth Uncle, who was rumored to have never liked women and did not smile, should not have been so easily attracted to Jeanne to such an extent!
