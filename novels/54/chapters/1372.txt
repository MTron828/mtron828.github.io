1373 I Love You More Than You Think

“Why should I?” Monica asked, “Why should I eat it just because you want me to?”

“I told you, we didn’t break up.”

“Only you think that.” Monica said sarcastically, “To me, we’re already strangers. At most, you’re just my family’s doctor.”

“Monica, let’s talk.”

“There’s nothing to talk about.” Monica was very cold toward him. “I’ve said everything that needs to be said, and I don’t want to hear what you have to say, so let’s not waste anyone’s time.”

“I know I wasn’t good enough in the past. I didn’t care about what you felt, and I ignored your feelings. However, I will try my best to change in the future. I will try my best to spend more time with you in the future–”

Just then, Monica’s phone rang, and she picked up the call immediately.

Finn’s words did not affect her at all. Since he wanted her to listen to him, she would. Then, she would probably leave after he finished speaking.

Without wasting a second, she answered the call. “Brandon.”

“Are you ready?”

“I was just about to leave.”

“I’ll be downstairs in about five minutes.”

“Alright. I’ll wait for you–”

Finn suddenly snatched the phone away, and Monica’s face sank.

Finn said into the phone, “You don’t have to come.”

Without waiting for Brandon to react, he hung up the phone.

Monica looked at Finn coldly and watched as he held her phone very tightly.

She did not know if all men could not accept a breakup because even someone like Finn could not accept it!

She really thought that her breakup with Finn would be just like how they had done countless times before, where Finn could let go of her when he wanted to. Hence, she did not expect him to take it that far this time. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She could not deny that it disgusted her.

Since the night before, when he had forced himself on her, she felt a strong sense of rejection toward Finn’s series of reactions no matter how hard she tried to convince herself otherwise.

It was the same at that moment. However, she controlled her emotions and said in the calmest voice, “Give me back my phone.”

“Let’s eat first.” Finn was able to compose himself in an instant.

At that moment, there was no anger in his voice.

“Give me back my phone!” Monica was losing her patience.

“I’ll return it to you after lunch.”

“Finn.” Monica’s throat moved slightly as she said, “Do you want me to hate you?”

“Go on,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica sneered. “So this is what you meant when said you’ll change? Change it to someone disgusting?”

Actually, she did not expect things to be so tense between her and Finn. However, when a person was angry, they would really say hurtful words. That was an instinctive form of self-protection.

“Between you leaving me or hating me, I will choose the second option,” Finn said coldly.

“Why are you so insistent that I stay?” Monica asked him.

She really did not understand why he was so insistent that she stayed.

If he did not have any feelings for her, he would just accept it calmly. Why would he make things difficult for each other?

“I love you,” Finn suddenly said.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She looked at him and saw how serious he had become.

“I love you more than you think,” Finn repeated and enunciated each word.

Monica was shocked and she probably thought she had misheard.

How could Finn say something like that so easily? How was she supposed to answer him now?

“That is why I won’t let you leave me,” Finn said with certainty.

Then, he took the initiative to hold her hand, but Monica suddenly dodged, rejecting his approach.

She could not believe it. How much did Finn love her?

Maybe his love was different from what love meant to ordinary people, and it meant he only liked her a little.

How much could he love her?

She did not dare to easily have her feelings for him again. After so many years, a heart that could be broken had long turned cold. Why could he not learn his lesson?

She said, “Finn, I don’t love you anymore.”

Finn’s eyes were red.

“I don’t want to love you anymore,” Monica said sincerely.

She had actually tried when she had just reconciled with Finn. She, too, wanted to try and see if they should start over.

However, it failed. Finn’s heart was not that easy to warm up. Just like hers now, it could not be warmed up anymore!
