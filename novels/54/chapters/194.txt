Chapter 195: Kiss Me, but Not Like the Last Time

In the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.

Jeanne appeared in the Hall.

Nox and Teddy were there.

Finn probably had to go to work, so he would not be accompanying Edward.

When Nox and Teddy saw Jeanne suddenly appear, their expressions were the same. They were both so shocked that their jaws dropped.

Jeanne’s expression was calm. At that moment, she even smiled at them. “I’m looking for Fourth Master.”

“...”

Jeanne did not ask for their permission and went straight upstairs.

Nox turned to look at Teddy. “Are my eyes playing tricks on me?”

“It’s Ms. Lawrence,” Teddy affirmed.

“F*ck,” Nox swore and asked, “Why didn’t you stop her?”

‘Why didn’t you stop her?’ Teddy thought.

Jeanne did not know what they were thinking, but she was very clear that many of her actions were rather cold-blooded and heartless, at least to the people close to Fourth Master Swan. As such, she did not expect them to have any good impression of her.

She pursed her lips.

In front of her was Fourth Master Swan’s room.

There were some emotions in her heart.

Actually, she could have just given up her phone. She could buy a new one and change her number.

Jeanne took a deep breath.

She was already here.

She pushed open the door and forgot to knock on the door.

Inside the room.

Just like that, she was caught off guard and saw... The naked man.

Indeed…

The upper half of Edward’s body was wrapped in bandages, and the lower half of his body was completely naked.

There seemed to be water stains on his body.

Without even thinking, it was obvious that Fourth Master Swan had just taken a bath.

He avoided the injured areas and washed the other areas.

At that moment, Jeanne had forgotten to “not look at indecent things”. She just stared blankly at Edward.

“Do you like it that much, Ms. Lawrence?” The man who was being stared at did not feel embarrassed at all. Instead, he asked her in a very composed manner.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

‘What do I like?

‘Can’t he tell I’m merely shocked?!’

Jeanne quickly averted her gaze and looked to the side.

Her face turned red.

Edward looked at Jeanne’s appearance, and the corners of his mouth lifted slightly.

He casually took the towel by the side and tied it around his waist. Then, he lay on the bed.

Jeanne only turned back after a long while.

After all, she was here to ask for her phone. She could not just continue to be so awkward with Fourth Master Swan.

Besides, he was not feeling embarrassed.

What the hell was she embarrassed about?!

Jeanne kept herself calm and walked to Fourth Master Swan’s bedside.

“Are you feeling better?” Jeanne asked. She had to think of her opening line.

“Yes,” Fourth Master Swan replied.

Jeanne said, “I’m here to take my phone.”

Fourth Master Swan seemed to have known all along.

He took her phone out from under the pillow.

Jeanne was a little speechless.

‘Does he have the habit of putting his phone under the pillow?

‘Don’t people say that the signal radiation from phones can easily affect the development of brain cells?’

Of course, it was a fallacy.

Scientists had confirmed that the radiation that one was exposed to in daily life had no effect on the body.

It was just that people would always be led astray by the common prejudice.

Jeanne reached out to take her phone from Fourth Master Swan’s hand.

She had just reached out when Fourth Master Swan grabbed the phone tightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jeanne bit her lip.

She knew that it would not be easy to take something from him.

“Give me a kiss,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly said.

“...”

“Not like the one before you left yesterday,” he added.

Jeanne frowned.

“Alright...”

‘He’s so flirty.’

Jeanne looked straight at the man in front of her. When he said those words, his expression did not change at all.

‘Is this the rumored cold and abstinent Fourth Master Swan?!’

Jeanne was quietly adjusting her emotions.

She had also thought that if she came to take her phone, she might be in trouble with Fourth Master Swan. After all, she had just left yesterday. Even though he did not chase after her, she could feel his anger! She had thought that Fourth Master Swan would ask her who Kingsley was and what was her relationship with him.

Jeanne did not know if Fourth Master Swan was too confident that he could find out everything about Kingsley on his own. Perhaps as compared to who Kingsley was, he wanted to do something else with her instead.

In short, to her, kissing Fourth Master Swan was better than her having to explain who Kingsley was.

After all, it was not suitable for Kingsley to appear in Harken.

Jeanne silently took a deep breath.

Next, she directly approached Fourth Master Swan’s lips.

Their lips pressed together.

Fourth Master Swan lowered his eyes and looked at Jeanne’s face at such a close distance.

Then, he felt her soft lips on his…

He did not react.

At this moment, Jeanne only moved closer to Fourth Master Swan’s lips and did not do anything else.

The room was very quiet.
