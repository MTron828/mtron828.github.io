Chapter 137: Counterattack. The Eruption of the Public Opinions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Give them more time?

The news might explode through the entire Internet if he gives them more time.

He gritted his teeth. “Hurry Up!”

After he said that, he abruptly hung up the phone.

What a bunch of trash.

The Sanders were also trash.

He had just scolded the person in charge of the public platform, but in fact, he had called the Sanders’ Internet Regulatory Department before he called the public platform. That group of people was also helpless against the sudden “paralysis” of the internet. Since the other party was the Sanders, he could only vent all his anger on another person.

His expression was extremely ugly.

At this moment, the phone suddenly rang again.

Eden fiercely picked it up. “What’s the matter?”

“Mr. Swan, the Lawrences have spoken,” the other party reported.

“What?”

“I’m sending you the video URL. It’s a video of the Director of the Marketing Department, Jeanne Lawrence.”

“Send it to me!”

Eden threw his phone aside and opened the URL on his computer.

The page opened.

Jeanne’s seductive face appeared on the big screen.

She was dressed in a professional suit and had a ponytail. It was obvious that she did not have many beauty filters on, but this woman was so beautiful that people would mistake her for a celebrity.

She did not smile and looked very formal.

She said in a clear voice, “I am Jeanne Lawrence, the director of the Marketing Department of the Lawrence Enterprise. I am responsible for the operation of Lawrence Enterprise’s marketing. First of all, I am very sorry that because of some internal affairs within the Lawrence Enterprise, we have taken up such a large amount of public resources today.?Please forgive me for causing so much inconvenience to many individuals or enterprises. Of course, I would also like to thank all the people who have paid attention to the Lawrence Enterprise. Due to your support, I have the courage to appear in front of the screen.”

Jeanne paused for a moment.

She slowly continued, “The Lawrence Enterprise is one of the twelve great family businesses in Harken. We have always relied on the traditional industries for our development. I have to admit that the situation is getting worse by the day, and it’s not just the Lawrence Enterprise. Many of the once glorious family businesses are also heading towards decline. The sudden bankruptcy of The Locke Enterprise a while ago was a wake-up call for all of these family businesses.”

Jeanne first summarized the situation of Lawrence Enterprise and other businesses like them. On one hand, she wanted to create a basis for what she was about to say. On the other hand, she wanted to find resonance with those businesses.

“In order to turn the situation around, the Lawrence Enterprise is working hard. We gathered all our strengths and discussed e-commerce cooperation with MUK Group. Here, I will be transparent. For this cooperation, the Lawrence Enterprise is putting everything we have on the line. We have spent all our manpower, finances, and investments on this project, hoping that this project will bring change to the company, all so that we won’t be eliminated by modern times.”

Jeanne began to play the emotional card.

In public opinion, support will also side with the weak.

“However. The moment we invested everything, we received a fatal piece of news. The location of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse conflicted with the amusement park planned by South Hampton City Administrative Office. Our logistics warehouse is completely surrounded by the amusement park. If the amusement park is to be built and open for business, it would be impossible for the logistics warehouse to operate normally. When I received this news, I didn’t believe it. I didn’t believe that without any foreshadowing, the Sanders would do something that would seriously damage our company. However, when I saw the blueprint of the amusement park with my own eyes, I had no choice but to believe that this was the truth.”

“The truth is that the Sander’s plan for the amusement park has completely restricted the Lawrence Enterprise’s development. We might even go down the same path as the Locke Enterprise did.”Jeanne said tactfully.

She did not directly point out that the Sanders are targeting them. Instead, she only let everyone know the impact that the Sanders’ plan had on them.

Jeanne said, “I admit that I don’t understand the Sander’s plan. When the Lawrences tried to communicate with the person in charge of the Sanders, the other party rejected us on the grounds that they are too busy with official business. Today, I’ve chosen to communicate with the Sanders through this video because we are truly helpless. We have no way to complain about our situation through normal pathways, so we can only use the public’s resources and hope that we can get ourselves another chance.”

Jeanne said it in a very humble manner.

Her goal was to arouse the sympathy of the masses.

“The Lawrence Enterprise was established almost a hundred years ago. Today, we have over 10,000 employees. If the Lawrences go bankrupt, how should we ensure the survival of over 10,000 employees and their families? The Sanders promised to protect the whole of Harken. How will you protect the 10,000 employees of the Lawrences, so that they can survive the imminent crisis of unemployment?”Jeanne said with great emotion, “On behalf of all the employees of the Lawrence Enterprise, I hope that the Sanders can give us an explanation.”

After she finished speaking, the video ended.

The content of the video was spreading like wildfire.

There were a lot of comments.

“Oh my God, I think the Sanders are too despicable. They completely disregarded the interests of the company. They’re too arbitrary!”

“I have a friend who works at the Lawrence Enterprise. Now, the Lawrences are really panicking internally. It’s said that everyone may face unemployment!”

“I saw the posts of the Lawrence Enterprise’s employees on Facebook. They went to the City Hall to demand an explanation but were violently suppressed by force!”

“This is too much. This lousy operation by Sanders is too disgusting!”

“The Sanders can not abuse their power...”

…

The news continued to blow up. It was completely out of control.

Now, the Internet was unanimously requesting a positive response from the Sanders and it was causing a commotion.

At Swanhaven Bank.

Eden received a call from Melody Sanders.

Melody flew into a rage. “Eden, I asked you to stir up some trouble. You caused such an incident and put me on the spot. Is this what your ability can bring to the table?”

“I don’t want this to happen either. I’ve prepared everything well, but the incompetence of your?Internet Regulatory Department has forced the news to explode. What can I do?”

“So it’s my fault, then?” Melody sneered.

Eden held back his temper.

For a moment, the two of them were silent.

In the end, Eden gave in. “Give me some time. I’ll think of a way to deal with it.”

Melody also endured it. At this juncture, internal strife would only make things worse.

She said, “Don’t embarrass me.”

After saying that, she hung up the phone.

Eden’s expression was extremely ferocious at this moment.

He took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up. “Micheal.”

“Melody Sanders called you?”

“She gave me a bunch of curses,” Eden said bluntly.

“You have to understand her position.”

“I know. It’s just that her attitude makes me feel that what I did for her is worthless.”

“Don’t think of it that way. She’s just angry right now.”

Eden did not say anything.

He was really unhappy.

“Now think about how to solve the problem,” Micheal reminded him.

In the end, Micheal was calmer than everyone else.

“For the time being, my mind is blank.” Eden suppressed his emotions. “Melody Sanders just argued with me, so all my ideas went out the window.”

“I’ve thought of a way,” Micheal said straightforwardly.

Eden was surprised. “What?”

“Since Jeanne asked the Sanders to respond, we will respond to her.”

“What do you mean?”

“The Sanders have indeed overlooked the entire plan of the amusement park. It’s wrong, but a mistake like this is not worth mentioning.”

Eden blinked.

He instantly understood Micheal’s reminder.

“Don’t interfere with the following matters for the time being. I will ask Melody to arrange for the person in charge to respond,” Micheal said, “Adjust yourself. When you encounter difficulties in any matter, the biggest taboo is to have yourself falling apart.”

“Okay.” Eden nodded and said sincerely at that moment, “Micheal, thank you.”

“There’s no need for nonsense like this between friends.”

Eden was touched. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He did not expect Micheal to be so loyal.
