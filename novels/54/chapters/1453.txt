When she walked in, George was lying in bed reading a book.

George’s behavior was different from children of the same age. Children of the same age would never be as self-disciplined as George. Even if no one had disciplined him, he would arrange his own study time reasonably.

George was expressionless when he saw Candice return. His little face looked cold.

Candice stared at George for a long time until it made George feel uncomfortable. He frowned and touched his face, thinking that there was something on his face, which made him a little embarrassed.

“There’s nothing on your face, and you’re especially handsome,” Candice said bluntly.

George turned to look at Candice. How would she know what he was thinking?

“Then, why are you staring at me?” George was annoyed. When it came to Candice, he could not stay calm for even a minute.

“I’m thinking that with such a handsome face, even if you have a bad personality, there should still be girls who like you,” Candice said seriously.

George blushed at her words. However, he said angrily, “Candice, I’m only 10 years old. Is it appropriate for you to tell me this?”

“But you understand it, don’t you? Since you do, what’s inappropriate about it?” Candice asked.

George’s little face twisted in anger.

“Don’t worry. I won’t mind even if you get into a relationship at a young age. I can even help you by getting your father to accept it.”

“I won’t fall in love at a young age, nor will I fall in love. Get out!” George believed that Candice would anger him to death one day. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Candice, however, did not react to George’s temper. She smiled and said, “I came to see you today because I have something to tell you.”

“Tell me quickly!” He did not want to see her for even a minute.

However, unknowingly, he had begun to accept her matters. In the past, his instinctive reaction would be “I don’t want to know”.

“My sister, Chloe, will be staying with us for a week. Anyvvay, she doesn’t have good intentions, so you should be mentally prepared,” Candice said bluntly.

“Is she worse than you?” George asked.

Candice was stunned for a moment before she smiled. “A different kind of worse.”

George frowned.

“You’re exceptionally smart. You’ll know when you see her.” “I’m more than smart!” George was a little angry.

“You’re smart and wise.” Candice found another word.

“Hurry up and leave. I want to rest.” George did not know why he was being led by the nose by Candice.

He was just fine alone, yet the woman insisted on disturbing his life. He even had to chase her away several times tonight, but she had yet to leave.

“Good night.” Candice smiled brightly.

She also knew that if she stayed any longer, George would probably have a mental breakdown. Seeing that George’s long face was back again, Candice left.

Then, the moment she pushed open the door to her and Edward’s room, she froze because she saw Chloe in a spaghetti-strap dress in the room while Edward was on the bed. That scene made her a little unhappy.

“Sis, where did you go?” Before Candice could get angry, Chloe asked.

Candice held it in and said, “Why are you looking for me?

“I can’t use the bathroom in the room. Plus, my right hand is injured, so it’s very inconvenient for me to take a shower. I wanted to take a shower with you, but I didn’t expect you to not be in when I pushed open your door,” Chloe said happily.

What gave her the right to act so self-righteous when she was the one who barged into someone else’s room?

“Let’s go. I’ll go back to your room with you to take a shower.”

“I’ll shower here, so you don’t have to go back and forth. I’ll go back to my room after the shower. I’ve brought my undergarments.” Chloe said, “Edward, you don’t mind, right?”

As she spoke, she deliberately waved her bright red bra and pants. Edward’s eyes shifted, and he looked at Candice. However, before Candice could answer, Chloe had already walked into the bathroom.

In the bathroom, she called out, “Sis, come in, and let’s take a shower together. We haven’t taken a shower together in a long time.”

Candice pursed her lips. In the end, she walked into the bathroom, where Chloe had started to take off her clothes even though the bathroom door was not closed.

After locking the door, Candice also began to take off her clothes.

“Sister, don’t you think I have a good figure?” Chloe stood in front of the mirror and looked at herself.

“It’s pretty good,” Candice responded..
