Chapter 401: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship

However, she could not have too much hope for Kingsley.

After all, she was just a chess piece to him. In the face of benefits, he would definitely abandon her, but before he did that, he had to satisfy some of her personal feelings.

“What will the Sanders do next?” Jeanne immediately changed the topic. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Those overly emotional words were not suitable for their current identities.

“Continue to search for whether the Swans have hidden any orphans.”

“How can I do that?”

“Eliminate them one by one.” Kingsley said, “If the orphan exists, and if the Swans are really supporting this person, they will definitely have a connection with this person. If they have a connection, you will definitely be able to find some clues. Jeanne, do you now know why you married Fourth Master Swan?”

Jeanne sneered. “That’s why you want me to find this person.”

“Yes.” Kingsley nodded.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“If you had chosen to leave with me back then and didn’t turn back, this mission would not have fallen on you. It would have fallen on the countless Sanders princesses.”

“Is there any use in saying that now?”

“There isn’t,” Kingsley said straightforwardly. “So now, I have to give you an order.”

......

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“Verify Fourth Master Swan’s identity.”

Jeanne was stunned.

She could not deny that her heart was beating very fast, and it even skipped a few beats.

It was the kind of reaction that was filled with fear.

She tried her best to keep calm and ask, “The Sanders suspect that Edward is an orphan of the Duncans? Would Old Master Swan be so bold?”

“Nothing is impossible. The so-called most dangerous place is the safest place. Moreover, Fourth Master Swan’s birth is very suspicious. Old Master Swan was already so old when Edward was born, and even after that, he held Edward in such high regard. The fact that he treats his youngest son like that in such a large family is inconceivable in itself, so there are reasons to suspect Fourth Master Swan’s identity.”

Jeanne listened to Kingsley’s words, but she did not agree with him.

She did not think that Edward had anything to do with the Duncans.

If Edward was related to the Duncans, he should be protected instead of being so hard-edged.

The consequences of being hard-edged would most likely make him the target of public criticism and the target of attack.

That was why Old Master Swan could not possibly do that. However, everyone had the opposite way of thinking.

As the saying went, ‘intelligence leads to mistakes.’ If everyone could understand it, Old Master Swan might do the opposite.

.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly before she turned her head and looked into the room, where she saw Edward lying on the bed, still in deep sleep.

“How can I verify it?” Jeanne asked.

“Verifying Fourth Master Swan is very simple. There’s no need for violence or bloodshed. All you need to do is get a strand of hair from Fourth Master Swan and Old Master Swan and do a DNA test,” Kingsley instructed.

“Okay,” Jeanne agreed immediately.

If Edward and Old Master Swan were not related by blood, the answer would be certain.

“I’ll wait for your news.”

“Kingsley,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

“Yes,” Kingsley replied.

“Will you really kill me?” Jeanne asked.

Kingsley answered without any hesitation, “No.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“I know your strength, so I knew the people whom you came across in the Balti Islands couldn’t kill you,” Kingsley said very softly.

However, Jeanne believed him because Kingsley had never lied to her.

“But.” Kingsley changed the topic, causing Jeanne to frown.

“I might not be able to protect you right now.”

“I know.”

“Although Fourth Master Swan loves you very much, if his status is special, his love for you can also come with many labels in front of the country. Jeanne, I’m not by your side now, so you can only rely on yourself.”

.

“I never thought of relying on you forever.”

“You can never run away from our family’s mission.” Kingsley enunciated each word clearly.

Jeanne bit her lip.

“I will send a few more people by your side to secretly protect you,” Kingsley added before he hung up.

With that, Jeanne also silently put down the phone.

Their family’s mission… Who said there must be a mission?

If her mother could choose not to, she could too!

Jeanne sat on the balcony for a long time. It was already very late at night, and the entire bamboo garden was quiet.

She really did not know how long she could stay in that place.

In fact, Kingsley was wrong.

Even if he chose to treat her equally when he assassinated Edward in the Balti Islands, it did not mean that no one would suspect her identity if she stayed by Edward’s side.
