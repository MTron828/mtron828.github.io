Chapter 1584: The Conflict Between Shelly and the Winters

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Yet, she had turned around and left without even a word of concern. No matter what, his mother had been good to Shelly back then.

Since Shelly was young, his mother had taken care of her and cared for her, only to raise such an ungrateful lady! Shelly was not at all grateful to the Winters.

Nox handed his mother over to the others and made sure that she did not fall too badly before letting her go and rushing toward Shelly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

At that moment, Shelly was walking to the street and hailing a taxi. Just as the taxi stopped at her feet, Nox grabbed Shelly forcefully.

As Shelly was almost pulled over by Nox, she got a little angry and tried to break free. However, there was no way to break free. Nox was so strong that it hurt her arm so much.

“Let go of me!” Shelly resisted.

Nox pretended not to hear her and dragged her back. Naturally, the taxi did not dare to stir up trouble, so it quickly drove away.

Shelly watched as the taxi left, and it fueled her anger. Suddenly, she lowered her head and bit Nox’s arm with all her strength.

Nox was in so much pain that he pushed Shelly away. Then, under Nox’s brute force, Shelly lost her balance and fell to the ground. She fell so hard that she saw stars.

At that moment, she believed Nox was the man she hated the most in this world, and there was no other. If she could, she really wished she had never met Nox in her life and had never done anything for him.

Nox’s face was filled with anger. When he saw Shelly fall to the ground, he froze for a second. However, in the next second, he looked calm. “So you know how painful it is to fall to the ground, huh?”

Shelly did not answer. All she wanted now was to go home. She did not even want to look at Nox.

“My mother fell to the ground just now, and you didn’t even look at her. Shelly, how can you be so heartless?” Nox asked her fiercely.

Upon recalling Shelly turning around and leaving, he became furious again.

“Yes, I have no conscience!” Shelly got up from the ground.

Her body was bruised and her skin was scraped from the fall, but she still endured the pain and got up.

Nox frowned.

“Now that the Winters can’t give me any benefits, why should I treat you so kindly? Don’t you know that I came to your house to live a life of luxury? Now that it’s gone, why should I pretend like I care?”

“Shelly?” Mrs. Winter stood behind Nox.

She had limped out with someone’s help. However, she did not believe what

Shelly said, so she asked Shelly, “Do you really think so?”

“Yes, that’s what I think, ever since you and your son chased me out of the Winters. I don’t feel anything for anyone in your family. All I wanted was your family’s wealth, so now that it’s gone, I don’t need to please you and be an obedient girl anymore. This is my true colors,” Shelly said loudly to Mrs. Winter.

Mrs. Winter’s eyes turned red. She probably could not accept that Shelly had said something like that.

“I know you’ve suffered because of Nox, but no matter what, we’re family. I’ve always treated you like a daughter-I‘

“If you treated me like your daughter, you wouldn’t have done that to me back then! At the end of the day, you’re still biased towards Nox. Since you’re biased toward Nox, stop pretending to be nice to me. I feel disgusted.. ”

“Slap!” Nox suddenly slapped Shelly hard on the face.

Shelly was silent for a second. Her face was burning with pain, but she did not cry, nor did she show any expression.

She said, “This slap will be to repay the Winters for raising me. In the future, you should stay away from me, and I will stay away from you too.”

“Shelly, do you really care about what I did three years ago? You left Nox of your own free will, but now you’re saying that it was because I was biased towards Nox.” Mrs. Winter could not accept Shelly’s reasoning.

Shelly did not speak for a while.

She said, “But I regretted it later on. When I said I wanted to bring Bella back to the Winters, you rejected me. You said that you were afraid of tarnishing the Winters’ reputation, and you even made me understand your situation.” Mrs. Winter’s expression changed immediately. She was a little embarrassed by Shelly’s words..
