1194 Monica Wakes Up

She frowned.

After a long time, she opened her eyes and looked at the unfamiliar scene in front of her.

She seemed to have slept for a long time. It felt as if she had slept for a century and that she was still traveling through time and space.

For a long time, she could not remember why she was in such a place. She just stared at the ceiling until suddenly, she felt a warm breath on her face.

Then, she turned around and saw a face very close to hers. She could only feel his even breathing because he was very close to her.

At that moment, he was frowning slightly. The black-rimmed glasses were still hanging on his high nose bridge. It seemed that he had forgotten to take them off and had fallen asleep.

The fatigue on his face was visible to the naked eye.

What had he experienced that make him so tired that he fell asleep immediately?

Monica just looked at him for a long time. However, after a while, she wanted to move her body, or she felt like she was going to be crippled.

It was also at that moment did she realize that her hand was being held tightly by his large hand. It felt as if he had held it for a long time and did not dare to let go.

The moment her fingers moved, the man who had fallen asleep suddenly opened his eyes. Under the glasses, his eyes were bloodshot.

How many nights had he stayed up? How tired was he that his eyes were bloodshot?

Moreover, those eyes had been looking at her ever since they opened.

He was afraid that if he blinked, what he saw in front of him would no longer be real, so he did not move his eyes.

That was until Monica asked, “Finn, was I asleep for a long time?”

Was it because she had slept for a long time and he had been accompanying her the entire time that he was so tired and afraid?

Finn’s eyes were red at that moment, and the redness in his eyes made his bloodshot eyes look even more ferocious.

He was in a daze for a few seconds before he quickly stood up, pressed the call button, and checked her body’s condition.

There were all kinds of instruments inserted into her body, each showing certain index characteristics.

He naturally let go of her hand, and it was a lot less warm.

Monica pursed her lips.

She silently watched Finn go from being helpless, flustered, and excited at the beginning to his current calmness.

At that moment, many doctors came in calmly and were discussing her condition.

From their conversation, Monica found out that she had been sleeping for more than 20 days, ever since the car accident.

Due to the blood clot in her brain, she had undergone a craniotomy, which explained why her head would hurt so much.

She listened to their discussion in silence. Then, she saw a doctor come over and smile at her kindly. He said, “Ms. Cardellini, first of all, congratulations. You’ve successfully come back from the gates of hell. Based on the current situation, your life is not in danger anymore.”

Monica forced herself to smile in response.

“Because you’ve been sleeping for too long and had brain surgery, we need you to cooperate with us to do a basic examination to determine if there are any sequelae. You just need to answer or move according to my instructions. If you understand, say yes.”

Monica opened her mouth to speak. “Yes.”

Her voice was so hoarse that she did not even think that it was her own voice.

“Very good.” The doctor smiled kindly.

The moment she said “yes”, he had already marked something in the book.

Then, he asked, “Ms. Cardellini, do you know him?”

He was pointing at Finn.

“I do.”

“He’s...?”

“Dr. Jones, my dad’s attending doctor.”

“Alright.” The doctor was gentle as he ticked off something in his notebook.

“How many fingers do I have up?” he asked.

“One.”

“What’s one plus one?” the doctor asked.

Monica frowned. What kind of stupid question was that?

“You don’t know?” The doctor sounded worried.

Monica was speechless as she replied, “Two.”

“Alright.”

The doctor jotted it down again and said, “Can you raise your arm?”

Monica did as she was instructed. However, it was so weak, and it took a lot of effort to lift it up just a little.

“Lift your leg,” the doctor ordered.

Monica tried very hard to move her feet, which felt so weak that she started to doubt her life. She spent a lot of effort moving her feet just a little.

After she was done, and she heaved a sigh of relief, she saw Finn, who was standing next to her, heave a sigh of relief as well.

“Alright.” The doctor ticked something else off.

He said, “We’ll try to get you to sit up now. If you feel dizzy and can’t take it, just let us know.”

“Alright.”

In fact, Monica wanted to sit up too. She felt that she had really slept so much that her bones had gone soft.

...

The doctor got the nurse to lift up the head of her bed slowly and bit by bit.

As he asked her, the nurse controlled the speed at which the head of the bed was lifting until she finally sat up.

The doctor asked, “How do you feel?”

“I’m fine, but my head is a little heavy. I don’t dare to shake it because I’ll feel dizzy if I do,” Monica said.

“It’s normal. It’s because you’ve slept for too long, Ms. Cardellini. A normal person would feel uncomfortable after sleeping for a day, not to mention you, who slept for 20 days.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“When I first woke up, I felt a splitting headache. Although it’s much better now, it still hurts a little.”

“That’s normal because Ms. Cardellini underwent an intracranial operation.” The doctor explained, “During this period of time, the brain is still recovering, so it’s normal to feel pain. It’s also because your brain is recovering that your brain is still very fragile. You must not touch it, and try not to sway as much as possible. Even if you want to get out of bed and walk, you must walk steadily. After a few steps, you must go back to bed and lie down.”

“Alright.”

“Also, don’t get too agitated.” The doctor then instructed, Stay calm. Once you’re agitated, there’s a high chance that you’ll have a cerebral hemorrhage, which will be very dangerous.”
