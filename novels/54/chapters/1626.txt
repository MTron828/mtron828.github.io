If he wanted to vent his anger, he should go look for Zoe. Why should he vent all his anger on her? Should she, since she was young, allow him to treat her like that?

Zoe was the one who had done such a disgusting thing to him, so why was he not taking revenge on Zoe? Why must he make her suffer?

“You don’t want to see me for even a second, huh?” Nox looked at Shelly coldly. His expression was terrifyingly dark. “But you’re moving in with Benjamin so soon! Are you so desperate to sleep with a man? Why are you so shameless? Why are you so—”

“Yes, I’m cheap and living with Benjamin. I’m just that desperate to sleep with a man.” Shelly did not want to waste her breath on Nox. “But am I in your way? What does me being with 10,000 men have to do with you? Nox, don’t forget that you were the one who paid me to get lost. Yet now, here you are, pestering me. Why? Do you regret it? Do you want to start over with me? If you really want to start over with me, you can. Just give me the money, and I’ll come back to you immediately…”

“Shelly, you’re f*cking crazy about money, aren’t you?”

“You don’t want to pay but want me to return to your side? Nox, why are you getting all the benefits? Who do you think you are? Why should I stoop myself so low to satisfy your ego?” Shelly roared.

Nox had really pushed her to her limits.

“Who the f*ck said that I wanted you to return to my side? You think too highly of yourself! ”

“So why are you looking for me? Are you sick?”

“You’re the one who’s sick! Damn it, Shelly, what’s so great about you? What right do you have to show off in front of me? What right do you have to be so arrogant in front of me?” Nox was fuming with anger

He was here out of goodwill, but now that Shelly was insulting him, he could not take it lying down.

“Shelly.” Inside the house, Benjamin walked out of the room.

He had left Bella alone in the bedroom because Shelly and Nox’s argument was too intense. He was afraid that Nox would beat Shelly up, so he could not help but come out to take a look.

The moment he came out, he saw Nox clenching his fists so tightly that his veins were bulging. Nox looked like he had the urge to punch Shelly.

Shelly pursed her lips tightly. Due to Benjamin’s appearance, she deliberately suppressed her emotions. She did not want a third person to see her break down. In this world, apart from Nox, she could be calm with anyone else.

She said, “Nox, I don’t know why you’re pestering me, or maybe you just don’t want me to have a good life. But ever since I met you, I’ve never done anything to let you down. Perhaps you think I’ve caused you a lot of trouble, like causing your friends to laugh at you and your family to force you to be with me. But from my perspective, I was chosen by your family to be your companion, and I was forced by societal standards to treat you well.”

Nox’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he looked at Shelly, who had suddenly calmed down after Benjamin came out.

“Up until now, even when we have no relationship with each other, I haven’t done anything to let you down. After we no longer have a relationship, I haven’t badmouthed you to anyone or pestered you in any way. I think I’ve been a very good ex. Of course, you might not even think that I’m an ex, but in my heart, I think I’ve done everything that an ex does. My conscience is clear, and I hope that you can be a true gentleman.” Shelly enunciated each word clearly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Nox looked at Shelly coldly and suppressed his anger. It turned out that in Shelly’s heart, he was not even a man!

Shelly was indifferent to Nox’s emotions. To her, the current Nox was nothing but annoying. However, she believed she had said her peace, so if Nox still did not understand where she was coming from, there was nothing she could do.

With that, she turned around and was about to close the door but hesitated for a moment. She looked at Nox, whose expression was still grim, and suddenly reached out to grab Benjamin’s hand..
