1309 A Family’s Warmth

Candice quickly retracted her gaze. The way she looked at Edward just now seemed a little too blatant.

“I’ve already called your father. I’ll send you back tonight.” Edward naturally changed the topic.

Candice seemed to have just realized that she did not return home last night and her father did not call her today. She had also forgotten to explain.

She was really too cold to her family, which she sometimes felt a little guilty about, but she could not understand why toward a little girl like Paige, she felt an inexplicable surge or emotion.

Could this be fate?!

How else could she explain her feelings for Paige?

Paige sat on the ground and seemed to have completed assembling a block model.

She quickly said to Candice, “Mommy, do you think my castle is beautiful?”

Candice turned around and looked at Paige on the ground. She chimed in, “Wow, Paige is amazing.”

“Really?” Paige’s entire little face lit up at the compliment.

“Really.”

“There are plenty of other rooms in my castle, Mommy,” Paige began to show off.

Children never knew how to hide their emotions.

“Really? Then introduce your rooms to Mommy.” Candice squatted down and sat next to Paige, without even realizing that she had changed the way she addressed herself as Paige’s “Mommy”.

It was as if… a natural course of order.

Paige’s tiny finger pointed to a room. “George owns this room.”

Candice was stunned. She seemed to have remembered that other than Paige, there was a little boy in the house. She was about to ask where George was.

Then, she heard Edward say from the couch, “George is busy doing his homework in his room.”

Candice felt that Edward seemed to be able to read people’s minds.

This person… was terrifying.

“This room is Paige’s,” Paige’s young voice introduced them.

“Paige’s room is next to George’s. Does Paige like George a lot?” Candice started chatting with Paige.

“I like George the most.” Paige nodded quickly. “And George likes me the most.”

“Yes.” Candice was all smiles. She could not help smiling when it came to Paige.

“This room belongs to Mommy and Daddy,” Paige said, pointing her small finger at another room. “This room is the biggest.”

Candice’s smile turned a little stiff. Paige was still young, yet she already knew that her parents wanted to stay in the same room?! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Do you like it, Mommy?” Paige asked, her lively eyes adorable.

“Um…” She really had no idea how to answer.

“Mommy doesn’t like it?” Paige was visibly disappointed. She looked extremely aggrieved, so much so that Candice wanted to give her the entire world.

She quickly said, “No, no. I like it so much that I’m so excited that I don’t know how to answer.”

“Really? Does Mommy really like it? Really like sharing a room with Daddy?” Paige asked.

Candice felt like she had been tricked by a little kid.

However, the child in front of her still had an innocent expression on her face, and her round eyes were filled with anticipation.

Candice could not refuse at all. She could only bite the bullet and answer, “Yes.”

“Daddy.” Paige suddenly jolted herself up from the floor in agitation. Her small body was clearly still a little clumsy. Her small arms and legs pounced on Edward. “Daddy, Mommy promised to sleep in the same room as you.”

Candice was speechless. When did she agree?

She just stared at Paige. The little girl was only three years old and was clearly a smart kid.

Edward hugged Paige and could not hide the doting smile on his face.

He tapped Paige’s little nose. “Okay, Daddy got it.”

“Does that mean I’ll have a little sister soon?” Paige asked excitedly.

Candice felt terrible.

She heard Edward say, “Daddy will work hard.”

Who cares about your hard work! Candice just stared at the father and daughter.

No matter what, she felt like he had been tricked.

As soon as Paige heard her father’s answer, her little face lit up again. She cheered excitedly. “Yay, I’m going to have a sister. I’m going to have a sister!”

Candice did not know how to talk to Paige anymore.

Edward hugged Paige and coaxed her for a while before placing her on the playing mat on the ground and letting her continue building blocks.
