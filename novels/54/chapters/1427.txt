Thank you readers!

However, if she did not abort it… she would be repulsed by the idea that the children were Finn’s.

She had made all the preparations to break up with Finn and wanted nothing to do with Finn because of the children. She was even afraid of him being involved in her life again.

On the night she left South Hampton City, she argued with Finn because she was venting her anger on him after knowing she got pregnant. She no longer wanted to be with Finn because of some reason that the outside world could not accept. However, she had had enough of all these years and wanted to keep her distance from him.

However, if she really gave birth to the children, she was not sure if she would still accept Finn because of the children.

In fact, she could take care of them alone, but would Finn let her take care of the children by herself? Would her parents allow it? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica had a lot on her mind, and she was about to break down just from thinking about it.

The doctor did not force her to make a decision right there and then. He said, “Ms. Cardellini, you can think it through. I’ll give you an anti-emetic treatment to help with the vomiting for the time being. After you make a decision, we’ll change the treatment according to your decision.”

Monica nodded silently, and the doctor walked out. The moment he walked out, he could not help but turn back to look at Monica and the man beside her. When he returned to his office, he picked up the phone and dialed a number.

The call went through. “Dr. West.”

“Dr. Jones, I heard that you resigned?”

“That’s why you don’t have to call me Dr. Jones. You can just call me Finn.” The voice on the other end was neither cold nor warm.

In fact, Finn was always serious when it came to work, so his relationship his colleagues was neither good nor bad. However, because of his high med standards, he still received the respect of all the doctors and nurses in the hospital.

“I was really shocked when I heard the news of your resignation.” Dr. West could not help but sigh.

Finn, on the other hand, was very calm about it.

Actually, as for work… from the very beginning, his job as a doctor was arranged by Old Master Swan.

However, because he had received a lot of responsibilities from his duties as a doctor and had seen too many people die, saving a person and a family gave him a sense of accomplishment in his work. Therefore, for a long time, he spent all his energy on work, which was not necessarily a good thing for him and the hospital.

He knew very well that as long as he was in that position, he would put his work first. It was not that he was kind-hearted, but that after so many years, he could not change his habitual attitude toward work; and if he did not change, he would drive Monica further away from him.

As for the hospital, because of his ability, the other doctors in the Cardiology Department had almost no chance of making a name for themselves. All the people who came to the hospital, as long as it was for cardiac surgery, would appoint him as the chief surgeon, which caused the other cardiologists to lack clinical experience. Gradually, the entire Cardiology Department relied on him. If anything happened to him, the entire Cardiology Department would be wiped out. Hence, he chose to resign.

At that time, the hospital director did not agree and wanted to persuade Finn to stay. However, upon hearing the reason, the dean had no choice but to compromise and accept it.

After all, his departure might weaken the Cardiology Department for a while, but it was good for the future development of the entire Cardiology Department. Moreover, he had agreed that if there was a major cardiac surgery, he would provide the necessary support.

Just like that, he resigned.

When he left, he must have shocked the entire medical world. Everyone was speculating if he had better prospects elsewhere, such as joining an international medical team.

Anyway, it caused a huge sensation.

“Why are you looking for me today?” Finn did not explain further.

He and Dr. West were just ordinary colleagues.

To be precise, because he did not like to socialize, he was like that with everyone in the hospital. Therefore, he knew that the other party was not looking for him to reminisce about the past.

“Um… Didn’t I send you home once? It was when you had several long surgeries back to back. You were worried that you would be too tired to drive and happened to bump into me, so you asked me to send you home.”

“Yes, I remember,” Finn replied.

However, he did not know what Dr. West meant by that.

“That’s right. I saw you and Monica together at the entrance of your neighborhood that day,” Dr. West asked uncertainly..
