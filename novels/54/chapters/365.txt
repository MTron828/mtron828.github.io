Chapter 366: The Accident Is Just the Start

‘Oh my God.’ Monica was dumbfounded. ‘What does it mean by boiling?’

She looked it up on the Internet again, where it said that something was boiling when it was bubbling.

As such, she waited for a long time until the water finally bubbled.

Then, she put the pasta in, with the instruction to cook it until it was soft.

After that, she was to heat up the pasta sauce. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Was she supposed to heat up the sauce together in the pot of pasta that was cooking?

Monica studied it for a long time and decided to do it in a separate saucepan.

“Sizzle!”

The sauce was close to burning, so she quickly put it aside and went to check the pasta in the pot.

She thought, ‘Is it soft yet? It should be.’

With that, she turned off the fire, scooped the pasta out, and put it together with the sauce.

It was such a big bowl of noodles, but something was wrong — there was not enough sauce.

Right. She was supposed to put some pasta water into the sauce.

......

Hence, she scooped some water out with a big spoon.

It was a success!

Monica thought she was pretty amazing for succeeding in making pasta for the first time.

Although it was a little bland, she held the plate of pasta and was about to hop her way to the dining room to eat.

Unexpectedly, as she hopped, the hot pasta sauce in the bowl spilled and hit the back of her hand.

“Ow!” Monica yelped in pain.

At that moment, both of her hands let go of the plate of pasta, causing it to fall to the ground and hit Monica’s foot.

“Ow!” Monica cried out again.

Then, she lost her balance and fell to the floor.

In the kitchen, a loud commotion went down, and even the most indifferent person quickly ran over because of the sudden noise.

That was when Finn saw Monica had fallen to the ground in a sorry state. The plate was broken, and pasta was everywhere.

Finn bent down and wanted to help Monica up when Monica suddenly screamed, “Don’t touch me!”

She was so loud that Finn’s hand froze in mid-air.

Monica endured the pain in her body and got up from the ground.

However, the pasta sauce made the floor too slippery, so as soon as she got up, she fell again.

“Ah!” Monica’s butt hit the ground, and it hurt so badly.

Finn pursed his lips and reached out, wanting to pick Monica up.

Yet, she pushed his hand away.

Finn frowned.

“I told you not to touch me!” Monica looked at Finn. Her eyes were red, and the disgust on her face was visible.

“What’s wrong with you?” Finn’s patience was limited.

Now, his expression was ugly as he stared at the spiteful woman.

“Even if I fall to my death, I don’t want your help. Get away from me!” Monica shouted, and her throat felt like it was about to tear.

In response, Finn looked at her coldly.

While struggling to get up, Monica said, “I regret it! I regret agreeing to move out with you and even agreeing not to have any servants at home!”

Finn’s eyes flickered.

“From tomorrow onward, I will have all the servants in my villa come over and serve me. If you don’t like it and can’t live a life of servitude, it’s your own problem that you’ve gotten used to living such a poor life. I won’t compromise anymore!” Monica finally stood up.

She must have gone crazy that year to agree to live with Finn alone without her parents. From then on, no one had served her.

All these years, she had eaten more junk food than she had ever eaten in her entire life!

Finn simply looked at Monica, who picked up her phone angrily to make a call. “Dad.”

“It’s so late. Why aren’t you at work yet? Do you know there’s an important board of directors meeting today? Hurry over. There’s still half an hour left.”

Monica suppressed the anger in her heart and said, “I can come over, but you have to agree to one condition of mine.”

“It’s an order for you to attend the meeting. I’m not begging you. Don’t negotiate with me.”

“I want Auntie Linda, Macy, and Uncle Greg to be with me.”

“What’s wrong with you again?”

“Nothing is wrong with me! I’ve had enough of the days where I have no one to serve me at home! You don’t know how many takeaways and junk food I’ve eaten over the years when I’ve been with Finn. I almost fell to my death in the bathroom today, but no one came to my help. Dad, either you bring the maids here, or I’ll go back and live with you guys. It’s up to you!”

On the other side, there was a few seconds of silence.

He agreed to Finn’s request back then because he wanted the two of them to develop a relationship.

He really did not expect that Monica would bottle everything up to such an extent.
