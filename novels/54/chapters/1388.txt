1389 Birthday Surprise

Candice was obviously trying to be nice to George, but George did not appreciate it. In fact, he was even starting to dislike Candice.

Candice had a feeling that it was harder to please George than to please Edward.

George was the kind of person who would not react to anything someone else did for him. He would not refuse or accept it just to protect himself.

It made Candice curious. With George’s personality, what would happen when he fell in love in the future? He would really break his mother’s heart.

Today, Candice woke up early as usual. Since George would get up at 7 a.m. for breakfast, she woke up at 6 a.m. to make breakfast for George.

However, George was against it. When he saw that she was the one who made the breakfast, he did not touch his food and went straight to school instead.

Seeing that, Candice could only get Teddy to bring breakfast to the dining table every day after she made breakfast. Then, she would return to her room without George noticing.

That was why George mistakenly thought Teddy had made it and ate the breakfast. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With George, Candice was extremely careful.

By the time she returned to her bed, Edward was already getting ready to get up. Before he woke up, he would hug her and be intimate with her for a while.

“Who does George’s character resemble?” Candice could not help but ask.

She thought George looked like Edward, but they were very different people.

Edward was so… flirty.

“Ah!” Edward bit Candice’s ear.

The two of them were… indescribable in bed.

“He’s like me,” Edward whispered into her ear with his deep voice.

“How is he like you?” Candice retorted, “George is much harder to please than you.”

“That’s because he hasn’t realized how good you are.”

“I’ve tried everything with him,” Candice complained.

In the past month, after being married and spending time together for a month, she was even more attentive to George than she was to Paige.

After all, Paige was a healthy, growing child, and she just had to play with Paige and satisfy her needs. On the other hand, she had tried her best with George, but it was still to no avail.

“Take your time.” Edward consoled her.

Rather than he was comforting her, he was dodging the issue.

“Aren’t you going to get up?” Candice asked him.

That guy was getting up later and later. However, Edward hugged her body, seemingly reluctant to part with her.

“Hurry up and get up,” Candice urged.

She did not want to become a femme fatale.

Edward smiled helplessly. “I just want to stay in bed with you forever.”

Candice blushed.

In the past month since they got married, Edward had shocked Candice with a lot of the things he said, which he would never say to her when they first met.

Sometimes, she even felt that the leader of a country was just an ordinary man and the flirtatious kind at that.

“Alright, stop fooling around.” At that moment, Edward was hugging Candice, with his lips on her neck, and it was really ticklish.

Edward opened his mouth and bit her.

“Ow!” Candice called out again.

Was that guy a dog?

After he was done, he got up from the bed in satisfaction. Candice also wanted to get up, but Edward stopped her.

“Sleep in a little longer,” Edward said.

Candice, who was lying under the blanket, looked at Edward.

“It’s been tough. You should give yourself more rest.” Edward’s eyes were filled with love.

Candice was speechless. What was so hard about staying at home every day?

All she did was wake up early in the morning to make George breakfast which was not appreciated. How hard would it be?

“I meant at night,” Edward added.

Candice was speechless.

She could never avoid him at night.

With a red face, she snuggled under the blanket and watched Edward wash up and get changed. Then, as he did every day, he would give a kiss before he left reluctantly.

Every time Candice saw the door close, she would still feel a little reluctant to part with him. It was just that… her relationship with Edward was like a storm. It came quickly and fiercely.

She covered herself with the blanket and could still feel Edward’s touch on her lips.

She had to admit that Edward was really… strong. Other than when she was on her period, they could have sex every day.

It was as if he had gone crazy from holding it in, so he was now trying to get back at her double.

Candice’s slender legs crossed, and she thought she could still feel some warmth there.

Her face was a little red as she wondered whether she was pregnant.
