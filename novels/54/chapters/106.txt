Dr. Finn’s Adam’s apple moved slightly. “Is that so?”

“Yes,” Monica replied affirmatively. “My father is right. Even if we’re not husband and wife, we still have to be friends in the future. So as friends, I will give you some advice.”

Dr. Finn blinked.

Monica’s face was full of sincerity, “In the future, if you fall in love and get married again, you have to stop being so cold. Girls need to be coaxed. They need to find a sense of presence in your life, and you should not make her feel that she’s dispensable in your heart. If you keep being like this, no matter how much that girl loves you in the past, she will fall out of love with you due to your indifference.”

Dr. Finn was silent.

Monica continued, “In short, I don’t know if you’re a good person on the outside. I guess you’re also a good person. After all, you’re a doctor who saves people’s lives. But internally, at least to me, you really can’t be considered a good man. It’s not just our three-year marriage. When we were in love that year, you didn’t make me feel safe or loved at all.”

After saying that, Monica paused for a moment as she thought of something. She then continued, “Also, if there’s really nothing going on between you and your sister, don’t do anything that will cause people to misunderstand. Don’t be so intimate with her, be it physically or mentally. You must avoid suspicion. No matter how magnanimous a woman is, she wouldn’t be able to accept it. In a relationship, having to be suspicious of your partner is like a death sentence.”

Dr. Finn listened without saying a word.

At this moment, the traffic was smooth. He started the car and continued driving.

Monica felt that it was meaningless to talk alone.

Anyway, that was Dr. Finn’s matter. She was just reminding him out of kindness.

She was afraid that with his personality, he might end up alone.

The car drove some distance away.

Monica’s phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the incoming call and picked it up. “Micheal.”

“Are you busy?”

“No. I just came from my dad’s place.”

“I’m not going to work today. I want to go on a date with you.” Micheal’s voice carried a hint of a smile.

The difference between Dr. Finn and Micheal was that every time Micheal spoke, she could feel his warmth.

She looked at the sky outside. “It’s raining so heavily today...”

“I’ll pick you up. There are many indoor dating places in South Hampton city.”

Monica hesitated.

“I only take half a day off every week.” Micheal sounded a little pouty. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alright, I have something to tell you.” Monica compromised.

“Then I’ll pick you up.”

“No need. Tell me the address. I’ll go over. I’m on my way.”

“I’ll send the location to your phone.”

“Okay.” Monica hung up.

After hanging up, she said to Dr. Finn, “I won’t go back first.”

“I heard you.” Dr. Finn was indifferent.

“Then...” before Monica could finish her sentence, Dr. Finn had already parked the car by the side of the road. “Get out.”

Monica looked at the heavy rain outside and asked, “Do you want me to get off here?”

“I still have to go to the hospital.”

“It’s raining so heavily outside. If you want me to get off here, can’t you be a little more gentlemanly?”

“I’m not.”

“Finn Jones!”

“I’m very busy.” His tone was especially cold.

Monica was really angry. She felt that all the words that she had said earlier, which were sincerely for his sake, were all futile and useless.

She angrily opened the car door.

The rain outside was really heavy. The moment she got out of the car, her entire body was drenched.

However, in the next second, the black car left immediately.

It even splashed water on the road and covered her whole body.

“Finn Jones!” Monica watched the car leave and was about to explode in anger.

F**k you, man!

I curse you to be alone forever!

…

In the same city, under the same heavy rain.

Jeanne was sitting in her office. Even on weekends, she was working overtime to sort out some of the work on hand.

The phone rang at that moment.

She looked at the incoming call and picked it up. “Miles.”

“I’m in South Hampton City.”

“Do you need me to pick you up?”

“No need.”

“Do you have a place to stay?”

“Mr. Thorn has already arranged it in advance.”

“Okay. You go ahead to your residence first. Send me the location when you’re there. We can have dinner together tonight.”

“Okay.”

She hung up the phone.

Jeanne stretched her body, lit a cigarette, and stood up from her office chair.

In the midsummer of South Hampton City, it still rained heavily.
