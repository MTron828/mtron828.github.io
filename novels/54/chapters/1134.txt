1135 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

He was visibly angry.

To them, Jeanne was still reluctant to part with Edward, which meant that she was going against the Sanders.

If that was the case, Jeanne would not be of much use.

“Can I do it?” Jeanne suddenly said.

Her voice was cold and devoid of any warmth.

Surprised, Chester turned to look at Warren, waiting for his instructions.

“I want to do it personally.” Jeanne said, “He killed Kingsley, and I want to avenge Kingsley!”

Chester could not make up his mind.

However, Warren agreed immediately. “Let Jeanne do it.”

Chester immediately handed the things in his hands to Jeanne.

After a small high-grade taser was placed in Jeanne’s hands, she walked toward Edward and said, “Edward, we were once husband and wife, and I never thought this would become of us one day.”

Edward looked at Jeanne.

There was no trace of emotion on her calm face.

“I thought that no matter what, we would still have feelings for each other. Even if we have to fight each other one day because of our different standpoints, I didn’t think that we’d die at each other’s hands. However, you killed Kingsley, someone who was very important to me. From the moment you killed him, all my feelings for you disappeared.”

“I know,” Edward replied.

He knew everything.

Since Jeanne had chosen to return to the Sanders, she had already chosen their relationship — a relationship that was the most impossible for them to be together.

Jeanne stopped a step away from Edward.

She did not say much. With just a few words, she told Edward that their relationship as husband and wife was over.

As for the rest… All that was left was hatred!

At that moment, Edward looked at Jeanne who, without hesitation, placed the high-grade taser on his abdomen and pressed it against his skin.

The excruciating pain caused Edward’s face to contort. He instinctively wanted to break free, but he was restrained by the Sanders’ bodyguards and could not move.

He endured it, and with his bloodshot eyes, he looked at the numb Jeanne.

Jeanne let go of Edward and looked at him enduring the pain. She asked, “Who is Alex?”

Edward did not reply.

The result of no answer was…

Jeanne’s hand moved closer to his abdomen again. She hit his body with the teaser again and again with all her might.

The feeling of being in so much pain that one would rather die could really torture a person and make them want to die immediately.

Edward clenched his fists tightly, and his entire body tensed up as he endured the pain.

Jeanne actually knew that torturing Edward would not help at all because Kingsley had used it on Edward the last time. Edward almost died, but he did not say a word about Alex.

This time, she would not succeed either.

She removed the taser from his body again and watched him sweat profusely and go deathly pale.

She asked, “Who on earth is Alex?!”

Edward continued to look at Jeanne indifferently.

He looked at her calm face, which was starting to show some irritation, and said, “Jeanne, you know I can’t tell you.”

His voice was not very weak, but he was clearly putting up a strong front because he did not want Jeanne to see his current state.

Jeanne sneered.

Yes. Edward would not tell her.

No matter how much Edward loved her, they stood on different sides. In the face of national interest, love was worthless.

She placed the taser back on Edward’s abdomen. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This time, she kept it there, using high-voltage electricity to hit his body. It was cruel and cold-blooded, causing Edward’s entire body to suffer.

Edward’s face turned paler.

He did not make a single sound, but his body was trembling violently from the pain. The pain on his face could not be concealed, and it made him look extremely ferocious.

If that continued…

“Jeanne!” Chester reminded her.

Even if the modified taser would not kill the person immediately, it could cause death if it was used inappropriately. It would not be the first time such cases had happened in the Sanders, and Jeanne’s actions right now were problematic.

She could not keep electrocuting him.

There was a limit to a person’s ability to tolerate pain. Once it exceeded the limit, one could die from the pain.

However, Jeanne did not seem to have heard Chester.

She looked coldly at Edward, the man in her hands who was in pain.
