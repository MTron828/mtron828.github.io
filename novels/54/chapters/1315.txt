1316 The First Negotiation With George

“Alright,” Monica replied.

By now, she had finished browsing the news and was dealing with some company matters.

Weekends were non-existent to heads of companies. Even if it was an off day, they would need to pay attention to the company’s development at all times.

Brandon got out of the car and left.

In just a moment, her phone rang.

She answered the call, “Brandon.”

“Monica, what fillings do you fancy? There’s braised pork, cabbage, mushrooms…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mushrooms, I guess.”

“Okay.”

Monica hung up.

It rang again a moment later.

“Monica, would two portions be enough?”

“Sure.”

After hanging up, it rang again.

“Monica, soy milk or porridge?”

“Soy milk.

She hung up.

It suddenly rang again.

Monica was speechless.

Did Brandon need to waste so much time buying breakfast?!

She shouted into the phone, “Brandon, are you done?! Did I ask you to buy a full-course eight-dishes Chinese banquet for breakfast?”

There was no sound from the other end of the line.

Monica frowned. At that moment, she saw Brandon walking back with breakfast in his hands.

She quickly looked at the caller ID on her phone. When she saw Finn’s name, she was a little surprised. Most importantly, it was rare for Finn to call her.

She took a deep breath and said, “Finn.”

“Who is Brandon?” the other side asked.

There was not much emotion in his voice.

“A colleague from the company. He just joined the company. He used to live next door to me. We’re neighbors,” Monica explained.

“Mm,” Finn replied.

“Why are you calling me?” Monica asked.

“The itinerary has changed. I might come back early,” Finn said.

“Alright,” Monica replied.

She did not ask when he would be back earlier.

“Monica…” The car door opened.

Brandon carried the Chinese takeouts and got into the car with a smile on his face.

Monica looked at his bags-filled hands and said to Finn, “Finn, if there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first.”

“Yeah.”

Monica hung up. Then, she quickly took the breakfast from Brandon.

“Why did you buy so much?” Monica frowned.

Did she not tell him she only wanted two dumplings and a cup of soy milk?!

“I was afraid that you wouldn’t like the mushroom filling, so I bought two of the other varieties,” Brandon added, “Besides, they’re not expensive.”

He was a typical rich second-generation heir. It was shameful to waste money.

Monica ate slowly. She had never tried the soup dumplings from this restaurant before and she felt it was rather tasty.

“Is it good?” Brandon asked.

“Mm.” Monica nodded.

She felt that two were not enough. Fortunately, Brandon bought a lot.

“Have you eaten it before?” Brandon asked.

“No.”

“This restaurant is very famous. I’ve even heard about it overseas. You actually haven’t eaten it before?” Brandon was shocked.

“Why do I have to eat in such a small stall?” Monica rolled her eyes.

She was also someone with a high profile, alright?!

Never mind that. These dumplings tasted awesome.

“Then why are you still eating so happily?” Brandon exposed him.

Monica was speechless. “I’m hungry.”

...

“Speaking of which, were you on the phone with Dr. Jones just now?” Brandon asked calmly. He was just looking for a topic to chat about.

“Yeah.”

“It seems like you’ve been together for years.”

“It’s been on and off for many years,” Monica explained.

“Are you two close?” Brandon asked.

When he asked, Monica’s hand holding the soybean milk gripped a little tighter.

“We’re alright. We make do with it.”

“Monica, you’re not the type to make do,” Brandon said with a smile.

“You little brat, what do you know?”

“I’m only half a year younger than you,” Brandon said helplessly.

Due to his late growth, he was half a head shorter than Monica when she was half a year old, so she naturally felt that Monica was much older than him. Monica also naturally felt that Brandon was much younger than her.

...

Until now, it seemed that he could not change it.

“A man’s mental age is three years younger than a woman’s. This way, I’ll be three and a half years older than you.”

“That’s bullsh*t,” Brandon retorted.

Monica could not help but laugh. She really felt very relaxed when interacting with Brandon, not much to be concerned about.

“Monica, if you and Dr. Jones were to make do, would you choose not to make do if there were other outstanding men pursuing you?” Brandon asked nonchalantly.

It was as if they were friends who had not seen each other for a long time and were just casually catching up.
