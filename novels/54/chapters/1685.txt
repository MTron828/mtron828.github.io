Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Katie screamed as Shelly grabbed Katie’s hair and shouted angrily, “Where’s Bella?”

“Let go of me! Ow! Let go of me!” Katie cried out in pain. She probably did not expect Shelly to be so crazy!

“I’m asking you, where is Bella? Tell me… Ah!”

Shelly was suddenly pushed to the ground by a strong force. When she hit the ground, she looked up fiercely at the burly man who had suddenly appeared in front of her. The man’s face looked ferocious and scary!

“Hubby, hubby!” Katie quickly pulled the man back.

The man looked like he wanted to beat Shelly up, but Katie stopped him.

“She’s Shelly. Don’t hit her.” Katie tugged at the man.

The man glared at Shelly and said sarcastically, “So this is the woman who helped raise my daughter!”

“Let’s go.” Katie glanced at Shelly on the ground and quickly dragged the man away.

“You’re not allowed to leave!” Shelly got up from the ground.

Ignoring the pain in her body, she ran up to them and said, “Katie, if you don’t tell me where Bella is, I won’t let you go.”

“Shelly, Bella is my daughter. Her whereabouts don’t concern you, so don’t worry about it. Go back! Without Bella, your life will be a little better!” “Katie!” Shelly really wanted to kill Katie.

Now, she regretted it buying her breakfast and giving Katie a chance to be alone with Bella! After all, she did not expect Katie to be so evil as to… She did even dare to imagine the scene of Katie taking Bella away by force!

“Enough!” Katie’s husband stood in front of Shelly, his expression terrifying.” Bella is my daughter. What right do you have to interfere in her affairs? I’m telling you, get lost immediately, or don’t blame me for being rude to you!”

“If you don’t hand Bella over, I’ll call the police! I’ll call the police immediately!” Shelly roared.

“Go on! Bella is my daughter. What’s the use of calling the police? If you call the police, I’ll accuse you of kidnapping my daughter and get the police to arrest you!” the man said fiercely.

Shelly broke down. Ever since Katie had taken Bella away, she had been holding her emotions in. She kept telling herself that as long as she came to the train station earlier, she would be able to see Bella.

However, when she saw that Katie was alone, she could not even bring herself to imagine where Katie had left Bella, and her emotions finally erupted.

She rushed over and grabbed Katie’s hair. She said fiercely, “Tell me, where did you take Bella? Tell me!”

Her voice sounded so heart-wrenching that it was as if she wanted to perish together with Katie. On the other hand, Katie felt like her scalp was going to fall off from Shelly’s tugging, so she cried out in pain.

Seeing that, Katie’s husband quickly tried to push Shelly away, but no matter how hard he tried, Shelly would not let go. Hence, Katie’s husband also beat Shelly up non-stop.

The situation was out of control, and it instantly attracted the attention of the police, who hurriedly went over to separate them.

However, Shelly’s eyes were red from the fight. As she could not hear anything from the outside world or feel any pain, she grabbed Katie’s hair and refused to let go. Katie was in so much pain that she wanted to die.

Finally, Katie could not hold it in anymore. “I gave Bella away. I sent her away when I was in South Hampton City. It’s useless for you to look for me now!”

Suddenly, Shelly seemed to come back to her senses. As soon as she loosened her grip, the police quickly separated them.

“What is this?” The police officer’s expression was extremely stern. “Come with us to the police station.”

“Officer, you’ve misunderstood. We’re sisters, and we fought because we had some disagreements.” Katie endured the pain in her scalp. “We’ll go back immediately.”

The police officer stared at them. He could vaguely see that Shelly and Katie had some similarities, even though Shelly looked much better.

“Is that so?” the police officer asked Shelly.

Shelly did not say anything as her mind was filled with Bella and what Katie said about her giving Bella away.

She snapped back to her senses. ‘Who did you give Bella to?”

“Explain to the police first. After that, I’ll tell you,” Katie quickly said.

Shelly gritted her teeth and said to the police, “She’s my sister. We just had a conflict. ”

“Show me your identity card.”

The two of them took out their identification cards. After the police confirmed it, they educated them again before letting them go. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The moment the police left, Shelly quickly asked Katie, “Who did you give Bella to? Who?”

“Shelly, calm down.” Katie looked at how agitated Shelly was and still felt a

lingering fear. She said, “Bella has been sent to a good family. You don’t have to worry!”

“Katie, do you see Bella as your daughter or not? How can you give her away just like that? Are you crazy?”

“I did it for your and Bella’s sake. You can’t raise Bella as a single woman for the rest of your life. You have to get married too!” Katie said righteously.

“Who did you give Bella to? Where did you send her? What’s their contact number? Tell me!” Shelly screamed.

Katie gritted her teeth and kept quiet, which provoked Shelly again.

“Enough! Why are you telling her so much? Bella is our daughter. There is no need to explain anything to her.” With that, Katie’s husband left with her..
