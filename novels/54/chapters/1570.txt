Chapter 1571: Finn’s Surprise Proposal Was A Success

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There was not a hint of anger in his tone. He just looked like a good man.

‘When did Finn become so kind?’ Monica gritted her teeth.

She felt that it was Finn’s trick— a strategy of taking a step back to take ten forward. Hence, without saying anything, she directly closed the door.

Finn looked at the tightly shut door and was not as indifferent about it as he thought he would be. However… he was not too sad either. After all, Monica was just throwing a tantrum. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

On the contrary, he was glad that she could throw a tantrum at him. He was really afraid that she would be cold to him.

With that, Finn waited at the door for a long time. About an hour passed, and Monica opened the door again. This time, she opened the door a little carefully, like she was a thief.

Finn found it funny. It had been a long time since he had seen Monica act so childishly, and it suddenly reminded him of Monica’s innocent and silly self when he first met her.

Monica stuck her head out and was shocked when she saw Finn staring straight at her. This time, she opened the door thinking that Finn was not around. Yet, in the end, she was caught off guard and saw Finn again.

She put her hand on her chest. “Why didn’t you say anything? Are you trying to scare me?

He had frightened her just now by talking, but it was also his fault now for not saying anything.

“Why haven’t you left yet?” Monica frowned, her face filled with displeasure.

“I won’t leave,” Finn said with certainty.

“Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?” Monica asked.

“No, I just don’t want to leave you.”

Monica’s heart seemed to waver for a second.

Then, she calmed herself down and said coldly, “Didn’t you go out to the night market with Ms. Hansen?”

Yet, he said he would not leave her side. Men were full of lies.

“Are you jealous?” Finn asked.

‘Me? Jealous? I’m not jealous! It’s your choice who you like to be with. It has nothing to do with me. Besides, we’ve already broken up.” Monica said firmly.

“I’ve explained to you that there’s nothing going on between me and Ms.

Hansen.” Finn said, “The reason why I went out to the night market with her-”

“I don’t want to know,” Monica interrupted him.

In response to that, Finn frowned.

“You don’t have to explain your personal matters to me,” Monica refused.

She was clearly jealous, but she was also trying to make herself appear magnanimous. Deep down, Monica was still the same as always.

Suddenly, Finn stretched out his hand. Before Monica could react, he pulled her into his embrace.

He hugged Monica tightly and said, “I don’t have any personal matters in the future. Everything I do has to do with you.”

Monica struggled in Finn’s arms. “Let go of me, Finn…”

“I was out with Ms. Hansen tonight because I wanted her to take me to buy baby clothes. Didn’t the tour guide mention that people here like to buy handmade clothes for newborns? I wanted to buy some for our daughters,” Finn explained patiently and was not angry at all.

Monica gritted her teeth. In fact, she knew that nothing would happen between Finn and Wendy, but…

Fine. She admitted that she had repeatedly rejected Finn’s explanation because she did not want to be too petty. She did not want Finn to know that she cared about such a small matter.

“It’s getting late. Go back to your room and get some sleep,” Finn whispered into her ear.

The next second, he bent down and picked her up horizontally, causing Monica to hug his neck in shock.

Finn smiled gently. Although she was hugging him so tightly because she did not feel safe, it still made his heart skip a beat. It had been a long time since he felt Monica approach him so proactively.

By the time Finn carefully placed Monica on the bed, it was already 1 a.m. at night. No pregnant woman could stay up late, yet Monica had tormented herself to this point.

Finn planted a kiss on Monica’s forehead. “Sleep early.”

However, Monica turned her body around as if she did not like him kissing her.

Finn pursed his lips. Slowly, he lay down beside Monica. As he was afraid he would affect Monica’s sleep, he stayed a little further away from her.

Monica could feel the distance between them, but she told herself that she did not care at all. With that, she closed her eyes and forced herself to sleep..
