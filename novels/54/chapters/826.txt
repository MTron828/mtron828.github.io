Chapter 827: Jeanne’s Soft Spot for Edward

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Still, no one gave him a response. After all, the people in front of him were all cold-blooded assassins, who had no human nature.

There was no talking assassins out of killing, and no one would satisfy the other party’s request before killing them.

They had always pursued speed, accuracy, and ruthlessness! They would never do things sloppily.

However, at that moment, there was a few seconds of stalemate.

It took a few seconds before Kingsley suddenly raised his hand and gave an order.

“Mason,” Jeanne suddenly called out to the assassin beside her.

“Yes,” Mason replied respectfully.

“Bring Fourth Master Swan here,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Kingsley’s face darkened. He turned around and shot Jeanne a cold look.

Jeanne said, “I’ll fulfill his wish.”

Kingsley’s expression was still unsightly.

Even though they could not see him clearly in the dark, they could feel his malicious gaze, and Mason did not dare to move.

Since Kingsley did not say anything, no one dared to do anything.

“Finn saved my life once in South Hampton City, so I’ll fulfill his last request,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Back when she was schemed against by Melody, she later heard that Finn’s hand was almost crippled because he was looking for Edward to save her.

Although it he did not do it for her, in the end, she survived.

If she could, she had to repay his kindness.

“Uncle.” Jeanne turned to face Kingsley’s dark gaze. “Please fulfil his wish.”

Kingsley’s expression was extremely unsightly, but even so, he still indulged her.

Mason received the signal and turned to the side. From a slightly hidden corner, he brought Edward out.

The entire time, Edward was shackled to the side, watching the fight. As soon as it started, he already knew what the outcome would be.

He looked at Finn in front of him, and Finn also saw Edward at that moment.

Even though he could not see Edward clearly, he could tell that Edward was severely injured.

Finn called out to him, “Fourth Master.”

Edward replied, “Yes.”

There was no weakness in his tone.

“I couldn’t protect you.” Finn said somberly, “I’m sorry.”

Edward looked at Finn, with his lips tightly pursed.

Men were not overly melodramatic with their words, but the brotherhood between them was very strong.

After a few exchanges, silence filled the air.

Kingsley said coldly, “Goodbye.”

That sentence was directed at Finn, who nodded his head.

Finn then faced an assassin next to him, who had already raised his gun and was pointing it at his head.

The distance was not far, and the assassin’s shots were very accurate. Once shot, he would die without a doubt.

At that moment, Finn prepared himself for his death. His only wish was that Nox would be able to make it in time.

If Nox arrived, they might have a chance of saving the Fourth Master.

After all, Kingsley only had five people left, and one of them was Jeanne. Jeanne probably would be involved, so there were only four of them. Excluding the person who needed to restrain the Fourth Master, only three were left, including Kingsley. On top of that, those people had suffered some injuries in the fight with him just now, so their combat power and physical strength would be reduced.

If Nox appeared at that moment…

“Bang!” The sound of a gunshot was deafening in the quiet night.

Finn suddenly fell down.

However, the moment he fell, the man who was pointing a gun at Finn also fell and died. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Finn, on the other hand, did not die. Hence, he quickly rolled to the side and was lucky enough to escape from the gunfire.

He hid behind the helicopter with lingering fear as the sound of gunfire rang in his ears.

Nox had arrived.

That was the tacit understanding between the three of them. At the most dangerous moment, someone would always show up.

Finn took a deep breath and felt that the sound of the gunshot seemed to be getting farther and farther away.

With that, he turned around and picked up the gun not far away before following the figure and chasing after it.

Kingsley had left with a group of people.

He probably made the prompt decision to leave because he did not know how many men Nox had with him, and his own men were getting fewer and fewer.

Nox chased them all the way to the edge of the forest, and it did not take him long to force Kingsley and company into a dead end.

Behind Kingsley and company was a cliff, and the chances of survival were slim if they jumped down.

“Don’t come over!” Kingsley suddenly shouted, “If you do, I’ll kill Fourth Master Swan!”

By then, Nox was already closing in on them.
