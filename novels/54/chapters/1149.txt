1150 Monica Risked Her Life To Save Finn

He looked at her unconscious appearance.

“Dr. Jones, do you want to get your wound treated?” A nurse came forward and asked with concern, “Ms. Cardellini is out of critical danger for the time being. If she is to wake up, it will take at least eight hours. Dr. Jones, you can treat your wound first.”

However, Finn did not respond. His eyes were fixed on Monica as if he could not hear anything from the outside world.

Monica seemed to be the only person in his world

The nurse was helpless and could only leave again.

This time, if Ms. Cardellini were to wake up, she would definitely help Dr. Jones woo Ms. Cardellini.

She felt that Dr. Jones was the most devoted man in the world!

Outside the intensive care unit, other than Finn, there were only a few of the Duncans’ men who were protecting Finn.

Ruby still did not know that Monica had gotten into such a big car accident, and Finn did not want to inform her either. Except for Monica, he could not think of anything else at that moment.

He just stood there like a stone.

However, one of the Duncans’ men behind him suddenly approached him. When he was caught off guard, the man used force and knocked him out unconscious on the back of his head.

The moment he fainted, the Duncans’ men quickly left the hospital with Finn.

That was… an order from above. Their superior had ordered them to take Finn away directly, no matter what method they used.

Therefore, they chose a simple yet crude method!

…

When Finn woke up, it was already nighttime. The room was very bright, but it was already dark outside.

He opened his eyes and saw someone in front of him treating his wound. At that moment, his wound seemed to have been treated, and the final dressing was done.

Finn took a few seconds to react. Then, he pushed the doctor in front of him away and got up to leave.

“Finn, you know that you can’t escape, so why do you have to do this?” The doctor who was bandaging him stopped him.

Finn’s eyes were cold as he looked at the man before him.

“You haven’t been by my side for so long, and you didn’t even address me when you saw me?” The man’s face darkened.

Finn was silent for a while.

In the end, he said respectfully, “Master.”

The master who had imparted his medical skills to him was the world’s top genius doctor, Kennedy Baker, who had once been world-famous but had suddenly disappeared from the world. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

No one knew that his sudden disappearance was not because he got into an accident and died, which had spread like wildfire. Rather, it was because he returned to the Duncans’ side and became their full-time doctor. He had perfectly turned the Duncans’ descendant, Alex, into William Gates.

The most important reason why Alex could replace William Gates, other than the fact that he was constantly learning his expressions, movements, habits, and so on, was that the two of them had the exact same face.

Alex’s facial reconstruction surgery was done by Kennedy.

In this world, only Kennedy could turn two completely different faces into one without any flaws.

Then, there was also Finn.

After all, Kennedy was old, so he passed on all of his medical knowledge to Finn.

Moreover, Finn was extremely talented. It was only a matter of time before he learned everything Kennedy had.

“Sir told me to look after you.” Kennedy nodded at the way Finn addressed him before telling Finn his purpose there.

Finn clenched his fists tightly.

Of course, he knew who Kennedy was referring to.

It was Alex, and Alex wanted to restrain him.

“You’re the only witness to expose the Sanders. Nothing can happen to you for now. Stay here.” Kennedy told him clearly, “As for Monica’s situation, I will tell you when she makes progress. All I can tell you now is that she’s still unconscious.”
