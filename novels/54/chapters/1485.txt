Chapter 1486: Monica Suspects Candice’s Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice, however, did not reply as she did not have a good impression of Chloe. They may be biological sisters, but for some reason, she did not feel the same toward Chloe as she did with Monica. She said, “I’m going to the washroom.”

Then, she left.

Chloe knew that Candice was not willing to talk to her. In the past, Candice would deliberately fawn over her, but now, just because Candice married Edward, she did not put her seriously anymore!

Chloe bit her lip, still unwilling to let Candice get everything. She had thought about it. Since George did not like her so much and was even threatening her, even if she could not marry Edward, she could not let Candice get what she wanted.

In any case, it was not good for all of them to be together! She would never tolerate Candice being better than her.

Candice returned to her room as she did not want to talk to Chloe.

Since her parents would be back in three days, she would definitely send Chloe away when the time came. However, she was a little surprised by how well-behaved Chloe had been the past few days. Other than deliberately pleasing Page, Chloe did not seem to have done much.

Of course, another reason was that Edward was very busy, so it would be difficult for Chloe to do anything. It also made her wonder if Chloe would be angered to death when she left.

Candice sat on the balcony, feeling bored. She thought about smoking again, but she suppressed her urge and gave Monica a call instead.

She heard Monica was pregnant with twins and wondered how it was going.

“Candice.” The voice on the other end sounded neither warm nor cold.

Candice knew that Monica was still partial against her, but she did not seem to mind. She said, “How are you now that you’re pregnant?”

“Much better.” Monica was currently sitting in her office.

She stood up from her office chair and walked toward the floor-to-ceiling windows to see a familiar car parked below. A man was standing outside the car and reading a book with his head lowered.

Monica shifted her gaze. She did not know when Finn he found that spot. Whenever she wanted to stand in front of the floor-to-ceiling window to get some fresh air, she would see him.

“Do you still get nausea?” Candice asked.

“It’s usually fine in the morning,” Monica said indifferently.

“That’s good,” Candice replied.

“You didn’t just look for me to ask about my physical condition, did you?” “That’s right…” Candice hesitated.

When she was chatting with Chloe about having a child, she realized she had not gotten pregnant yet in a few months. The key was that they had not used any contraceptives, so how could she not be pregnant?

She did not know who to talk to about that.

‘What’s wrong? Is your sex life incompatible with our Leader’s?” Monica asked bluntly.

Candice’s face turned red. She thought Monica was really bold to say that.

However, even Monica was shocked when she said it out loud. How could she be so casual with Candice? It was just like how she was with Jeanne.

At the thought of Jeanne, Monica was stunned. She suddenly remembered that Jeanne had also appeared in front of her once in a disguise. Could it be….

No, Jeanne was dead and could not be revived, so Candice must have been possessed.

“I don’t know why I’m still not pregnant after so long.” Candice mustered her courage and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She was afraid that if she did not say it, Monica would not know what to think.

“Did you guys use birth control?”

“No, and we do it frequently,” Candice said.

“How often?” Monica was curious.

Candice blushed. “If I’m not my period, we’ll do it almost every day.

Occasionally, we’ll-I‘

“Our Leader is really capable,” Monica said bluntly.

It was just a casual remark, but the moment she said it out loud, it sounded wrong. Candice was so embarrassed that she could not say a word.

“What I mean is that Leader has a great physique, and even though he works so hard, he makes sure to take care of you. Don’t think about it the wrong way.” It might be better if Monica kept her mouth shut.

“So, you’re not pregnant yet, right?” Monica quickly changed the topic.

‘Yes.”

“The Leader should be fine with it because he already has two children. Is there something wrong with your body?” Monica asked.

“I don’t know.” Actually, she also suspected that.

“Could it be that your accident back then hurt your body? Do you want to go to the hospital for a check-up?” Monica suggested.

“I want to, but… I feel a little embarrassed and don’t want Edward to know. I’m afraid that he would feel burdened..”
