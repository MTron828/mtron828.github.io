891 Humiliated At the Wedding, Michael’s Utter Embarrassment!

However, from the start to the end, Finn only wore one outfit, the most inconspicuous suit, throughout the entire wedding.

Her eyes flickered

Michael had already taken the initiative to hold her hand and walk toward the banquet hall.

Back then, Finn did not even touch her.

Suddenly, she felt that she did not lose out on this wedding.

With that, she walked ahead with the train on her gown dragging behind her, not noticing that a waitress was standing behind her and looking at her back with a faint smile on her face.

After that, she turned around and walked to the other corner of the banquet hall — to the dessert area.

She took a few desserts for the child who was trying hard to get desserts for himself.

George turned his head to look at her, his eyes twinkling at the person who disappeared in the blink of an eye.

Although the waitress in front of him did not look like his mother, he could still recognize her.

Of course, it was not that he could recognize his mother in her disguise. It was just that she gave him a hand gesture that only they knew.

His mother had told him a long time ago that if a stranger made that gesture to him one day, it would be her in disguise.

Even though he had not come across that situation before in his life, he could still recognize her in an instant.

He had used the excuse of going to the changing room to find his godmother to meet her. However, his mother was gone again when he came out of the dressing room. Now, he finally saw her again.

Jeanne handed the pastry to George. “Take good care of yourself.”

George nodded obediently.

Then, Jeanne smiled and walked past George.

After all, she still had many things to do that day. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was already a luxury to be able to spend so much time with her son.

“George.” A familiar male voice suddenly sounded beside her.

Jeanne pursed her lips and walked past the familiar figure.

George had also retracted his gaze so that no one would notice anyone amiss.

Edward held George’s hand. “The banquet is about to start. Don’t eat too many desserts.”

George did not agree to Edward’s request, but he could only take the cream cake and leave with Edward.

After taking a few steps away, Jeanne turned back to look at the two people in black suits, one tall and one short, before turning around and walking to the other side.

There were many people from the Hills at the banquet today. They were all disguised as waiters in the banquet hall, waiting for an opportunity to take action.

With a tray and a glass of champagne in her hand, she walked to the most distinguished table in the banquet hall.

That table was filled with the Sanders.

Of course, they were not given a private room, but they were in a corner of the banquet hall, which was not too eye-catching. However, there were several bodyguards in black suits standing around them to protect them.

When Jeanne got closer...

Someone immediately stopped her.

“Let her in,” Quinn said.

The man in the black suit stepped back respectfully.

Jeanne placed a glass of champagne in front of Quinn and secretly passed her a USB drive.

Quinn took it naturally.

Jeanne had called her last night to ask for her help, saying that a waitress would come over with a glass of champagne and hand it to her at 12:38 p.m.

Hence, the moment she saw the waitress, she knew that Jeanne had called her over.

Right.

She owed Jeanne a favor, so even if she did not have any feelings for Jeanne and did not feel that there was a need to be apprehensive when there were conflicts of interest, she would still return the favor as long as it did not go against her principles.

Moreover, Jeanne had also shown her a video last night.

The video was a video of her being taken to the hotel that night. In the video, a person was following behind them, and when she saw the person’s face clearly, she was really angry.

Was that what Jeanne meant by reminding her to pay attention to the people around her?

The person in the video was Jake Crawford.

He was a retired soldier of the Sanders. After he retired, he followed Michael’s father. Since Michael’s father passed away, he was naturally loyal to Michael.

Did that mean Michael was also involved in that night’s incident?

However, a video was not enough to explain anything. Michael had ten thousand reasons to explain that the person had nothing to do with him, and the Sanders could not find just any groundless accusation and suppress Michael. They needed to convince the public and balance it out.
