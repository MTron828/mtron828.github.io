1307 A Family’s Warmth

Candice did not know why her heart was beating so fast!

It was as if an inexplicable emotion had suddenly touched her heart, causing her to feel unfathomable joy and pain.

She stood in front of Edward and the little girl and stared at them.

She looked at the little girl. She was wearing a pink dress with a cute red bow on her soft bob haircut. Her skin was especially fair, with the tenderness of a baby. Her big eyes were shimmering, and her black eyes almost occupied the entire eye sockets. She looked very lively. Her small lips were red and moist, as if they had their own lip gloss.

A little girl, such a cute and beautiful little girl, could really make people unable to resist her closeness from the bottom of their hearts.

Candice suddenly… had a tear rolled down her face.

Tears that even she did not notice started to fall from her eyes as she looked at the little girl in front of her.

“Mommy, are you crying?” The anticipation on the little girl’s face turned to nervousness. She looked lost.

Candice seemed to have just realized what was going on.

When she came back to her senses, she hurriedly wiped her tears.

Why was she crying?

Why did she cry when she saw this little girl who looked almost identical to Edward?

She had not cried in a long, long time.

In her memory, she did not remember crying.

In fact, it was quite a suffering period of time during her recovery, but no matter how painful it was, she would not cry.

She had always thought that during her years in the army, she should have been trained by her father to be invincible.

“Mommy,” the little girl called out to her crisply.

Candice’s throat moved slightly.

Slowly, she began to calm herself down but she did not know how to respond to the girl.

After all, she was not her mother. She had no idea what role Edward wanted her to play.

“Mommy just woke up. Don’t scare her,” Edward said to the little girl in a doting voice.

Previously, she had only seen Edward looking too serious and strict out in the public.

This was the first time she had seen him so warm to his daughter.

If she had not seen it with her own eyes, she would not have even imagined it.

She even felt that Edward had given all his gentleness to his daughter.

Anyway, her greatest concern now was…

Edward had just tacitly agreed that the little girl called her “Mommy”.

Was this what Edward had requested?

Requiring the little girl to call her Mommy?!

She did not know how to feel. She had never thought of asking Edward’s child to call her that. She respected all his exes and their children.

“Come and sit,” Edward called out to her.

Candice snapped back to her senses and slowly took her seat.

She had just sat down when, “Daddy, I want Mommy to carry me.” The little girl broke free from Edward’s embrace and was about to pounce on her.

Edward did not ask for Candice’s opinion and placed the little girl in her arms.

Candice’s heart skipped a beat.

She was not ready yet. She was not prepared to be so intimate with Edward’s child.

She, however, did not appear to want to refuse.

As soon as the little girl hopped into her arms, she hugged her tightly. The milky fragrance on her body actually smelled very good.

The moment she hugged her little body, she could even feel her own heartbeat speeding up.

She was a little amused.

It was as if she had never been moved before, but now, because of a child, she felt moved.

She could not help but hug her tighter.

She suddenly understood why Edward felt like he had the entire world when he hugged this little girl.

This girl was not her biological daughter, yet she felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

“Paige, Mommy is hungry too,” Edward reminded.

The little girl called Paige quickly reacted. She looked up at her with big watery eyes and said in a childish voice, “Mommy, have breakfast.”

“Okay.” Candice smiled.

She had no resistance against Paige at all. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

To Edward, even if Paige wanted the stars in the sky, Edward could think of a way to pluck them for her. It was as if she was magical.

Candice carried Paige and shifted in her seat so that they could both eat.
