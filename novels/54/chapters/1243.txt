1244 Zachary’s Death

Susan frowned as she looked at Jeanne with a confused smile on her face. “So, are you helping me to woo Edward now?”

“No, it’s just some advice. In fact, I don’t know how to woo him.”

“So you’re showing off.” Susan concluded, “Edward was the one who pursued you, wasn’t he?”

It could be considered so.

Between them, Edward seemed to be always the one taking the initiative other than their first time in bed. The first time they slept together, she was the one who took the initiative, but throughout the entire process, it was Edward.

“In any case, you can’t rush Edward.” That was the only advice Jeanne could give her.

As for how to make Edward develop feelings for her, she really did not know.

Susan did not ask further. In fact, she had already understood the relationship between Edward and Jeanne.

It was not just her. Everyone in Harken knew that Fourth Master Swan was deeply in love with Jeanne.

Unfortunately, Jeanne had ‘died young’, so all the citizens had no choice but to accept that Edward had fallen in love with someone else.

“Did you look for me just to say this?” Susan asked.

“Not only that.” Jeanne looked at her.

“There’s more?”

“In the last two months of my life, I hope that you can hold back your feelings for Edward,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Susan laughed sarcastically. “Are you warning me not to get close to Edward during this period of time?”

“I have to admit that your existence has affected my mood. Because I often see you two being intimate, my diet has been irregular, and it has caused me to have acute gastritis. However, that’s not the main point. The main point is that the more aggressive you are now and in the final days of my life, the less Edward will like you.” Jeanne made things clear to her. “It’s up to you to believe it or not.

“Jeanne,” Susan called out to her, sizing her up seriously.

She sized up that woman who knew she was going to die but could remain so calm that no one could see her emotions.

If it were anyone else, they would have been driven crazy by everything that was happening. Yet, Jeanne was able to remain so calm and consider so much.

Susan said, “I admit that the words I said to you in the morning, that you have never loved Edward, were meant for Edward to hear. But at this moment, I suddenly don’t think that you really love him. I don’t think it’s worth it for Edward to love you. He’s actually done a lot for you.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, Jeanne chose to remain silent. She did not want to hear about what Edward had done for her from anyone else.

Susan also knew that Jeanne would not respond to her. Hence, at that moment, she agreed to Jeanne’s suggestion. “Alright, I’ll try not to disturb you in the next two months.”

Jeanne looked at Susan.

In fact, that woman had never been stupid. She was just too conceited, and that was why she was a little unwilling. Only when she was unwilling would she do such radical things.

Once she figured it out, she would know what was the most beneficial way for her.

Susan stood up from the sofa.

Due to Jeanne’s cumbersome body, she did not get up to send Susan off.

Susan said, “Please tell Edward that I’m leaving.”

“Alright.”

“Before I leave, I’ll give you a piece of advice. Don’t treat Edward too badly, or you’ll regret it.”

Jeanne looked at Susan.

“You can realize it yourself.” Susan left after saying that.

Jeanne frowned as she could not understand what Susan meant.

She just watched as Susan left elegantly.

In fact, sending Susan away was for the sake of the three of them.

For Susan, if she kept pestering Edward so eagerly, she would not be able to leave a good impression on him. Instead, it would only make Edward fed up with her, which would be of no help to their relationship.

As for Edward, he did not like Susan at the moment. Susan’s constant pestering would make him feel annoyed, and he might even feel guilty because of her existence. If she could help him get rid of her, he would feel much more relaxed.

As for her, she was trying to matchmake Edward and Susan, and there was no way that a smart person like Susan could not sense it. Once Susan accepted her kindness, it meant that after her death, Susan would treat George and the baby better even if she was grateful.

Sometimes, she was also afraid of her own rationality. She really wanted to indulge her feelings, but she could not do it.
