Chapter 516: The Plot Begins, Monica Admits to Her Mistake

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The more she explained herself, the darker Finn’s expression became.

How tightly were they hugging each other if his tears were on her skin?

He believed that if he continued listening to Monica, he would strangle that woman to death.

It was Nox who called him and told him about the news because he rarely read that kind of news.

The moment he learned of it and saw the image of the two, he was furious. It turned out Monica left so early in the morning because she was going to see Michael behind his back.

Finn did not know how he held it in and stayed calm when he saw that scene.

Even though he knew Monica would not do anything to let him down — even if he knew Monica must have met Michael for a reason — he was still furious.

Nox comforted him on the other end of the phone. He said that although Monica liked to fool around, she still had her principles. Hence, it could be a misunderstanding. Even so, he reminded Finn to be careful of Michael, who was not such a careless person. Based on their understanding of Michael, there was no way Michael could be caught on camera so easily. Therefore, something fishy must be going on.

Besides, it would not benefit Michael for doing that anyway. In fact, it would damage his reputation, which was not worth it.

However, Michael’s mind was wired differently from normal people’s.

If Michael was willing to lose his reputation to do such a thing, he must be scheming something.

Finn must be careful.

It might be all a scheme to get Monica.

Michael was not the kind of person who would let go just like that, and people in politics were very ambitious.

Of course, everything was Nox’s speculation, but Finn had to be careful and pay more attention to him.

Looking at Monica now, Finn agreed with Nox’s point of view.

Monica was more simple-minded and innocent, so she would not consider so much. She probably felt guilty toward Michael, for she had been feeling like she had let Michael down. However, she had never thought that if Michael really had her best interests at heart, he would not have interfered with her marriage.

Despite that, Finn would not say it out loud.

Some things were best kept to himself.

He still hoped that Monica would think that the world was beautiful and that everyone was nice. He did not want Monica to discover the darkness of the world just because of Michael.

Monica was still seriously admitting her mistake. “Hubby, this is what happened. It was Michael who hugged me, but I didn’t hug him back. If you don’t believe me, take another look at the photos. Don’t I look like I was standing there like a wooden dummy?”

She even had the nerve to ask him to look at the photos carefully.

At that, Finn’s face darkened again.

“Honey, don’t be angry, okay?” Monica tried to please him.

However, Finn did not say a thing.

“Michael said he would come forward to clarify things. I won’t see Michael anymore, okay?” Monica continued to say.

Finn still looked indifferent.

“Actually, Michael and I are pretty innocent.” Monica quickly explained herself again when she saw that Finn was ignoring her.

This time, Finn’s eyes moved.

Monica said, “Michael and I dated for a year or two, but during that time, we only held hands and kissed. We definitely didn’t do anything more. I’m still a virgin.”

Finn pursed his lips.

“It’s true. You’ll know after you try. I’m still a virgin,” Monica said seriously.

“How many times have you both kissed?” Finn asked.

“What?” Monica was suddenly dumbfounded and surprised that Finn suddenly spoke.

He had been wearing a cold expression the entire time. He did not even react when she was blabbering.

Angry, Finn raised his voice and said, “How many times have you kissed Michael?”

Monica was startled by how loud Finn was.

About that…

She began to think carefully. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The first time was that morning when she agreed to Michael kissing her so that she could get revenge on Finn.

The second time was when she agreed to become Michael’s girlfriend. That time, the kiss was a little more intimate because she wanted to give up on Finn completely, so she allowed herself to go deeper.

The third time should be on her birthday when she invited some friends to dinner, and Michael kissed her in front of them.

After that…

Monica made a hand gesture every time she thought about it.

She kept calculating and comparing while Finn watched as her fingers lifted one after another. Eventually, it was more than even her fingers could count.

Was Monica trying to piss him off?

One day, she would really piss him off to death.

Suddenly, he reached out and held the back of her head with his big hand. With a strong pull, he pulled the kneeling Monica toward him.

Just as Monica was feeling a little frightened, Finn kissed her lips fiercely and deeply.
