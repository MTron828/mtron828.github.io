988 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

She kept telling herself that she would definitely regret it if she did it.

That was why she persevered and hold on!

She probably fainted because when she opened her eyes again, she did not know what time it was.

Her body was so weak that she had no strength at all. It was as if she was really dead and her soul had left her body.

Her eyes flickered as she watched Kerby open the hotel door.

Kerby looked at Lucy’s expression and said, “Normally, the drug would last for eight hours. It’s now 6 a.m. in the morning, which means it’s been nine hours. I assumed the effect was over, or your life was over, or perhaps your desire was over, so I came in. Fortunately, you’re still alive.”

Kerby smiled.

As he was a newbie, he still had a trace of humanity left in him.

Lucy opened her mouth but did not even have the strength to speak.

She closed her eyes as if she was adjusting to her body’s condition. Slowly, she said, “Can you help me run the bath?”

In the end, she still managed to say a complete sentence.

Kerby nodded. “Okay.”

The sound of running water came from the bathroom, and after a while, Kerby walked out.

“Do you need me to carry you to the bathroom?” Kerby asked.

He could tell that Lucy’s body was extremely weak. However, he had to admit that after one night of blood, bodily liquid, and sweat, she should be feeling very uncomfortable.

“Thank you.” Lucy nodded.

Kerby went over and picked Lucy up from the bed.

At that time, Lucy was not wearing anything.

In order to satisfy her desire last night, Kerby had to take off her clothes for her. However, Lucy chased him away before she could do it.

Now that Kerby was looking at her, he did not have any other thoughts.

Assassins were used to seeing naked bodies, so even if Kerby was only in his 20s, he would not have the impulsiveness of a young man.

After all, they had received a lot of training, and being able to withstand the temptation of a woman’s body was one of the compulsory subjects.

With that, Kerby carried Lucy to the bathroom.

Just as he walked to the bathroom door, the door to the hotel room was suddenly kicked open.

Kerby’s instinctive reaction as an assassin made him roll on the ground immediately with Lucy in his arms. At the same time, he took out her gun and pointed it at the door.

“Kerby!” The cold and familiar voice stunned Kerby.

The man who called his name was one of the top assassins of the Hills, and the person standing in front of that high-level assassin was Kingsley.

In fact, Kerby had only seen Kingsley a few times.

At that moment, when he saw Kingsley appear in front of him, he instantly felt the intimidation from Kingsley.

He hurriedly greeted him with great respect, “Mr. Thorn!”

Kingsley’s gaze fell on Lucy, who was under Kerby.

Naturally, Lucy also saw Kingsley. The moment she met Kingsley’s gaze, she also said respectfully, “Mr. Thorn.”

Without reacting, Kingsley simply walked toward Kerby and Lucy.

Kerby quickly got up from the ground and stood in front of Kingsley respectfully, exposing Lucy’s body.

Lucy’s eyes flickered, but she did not dare to say a word. Under Kingsley’s gaze, she struggled to get up.

After all, lying on the ground was a little disrespectful.

She forced her limp body to get up from the ground. However, because her body was really weak, her legs went weak the moment she got up. Just as she was about to fall, Kerby quickly caught her. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

As Kingsley was watching their interaction, Lucy pushed Kerby away. At that moment, she did not even dare to thank him, for fear that she would implicate him.

Lucy had always been smart. She knew very well that she must have provoked Kingsley again, and that was why he was here.

Since she had provoked him, she naturally did not want others to suffer with her.

“Are your legs weak?” Kingsley asked coldly.

“It’s very weak,” Lucy answered.

Her entire body was weak, and she could barely stand.

Kingsley’s hostility seemed even more obvious.

The three assassins in the room — two of whom had come with Kingsley and the other one was Kerby — did not even dare to breathe.

As for Lucy, she did not dare to breathe either.

She was just mentally preparing herself for what Kingsley would do to her, so she appeared much calmer.
