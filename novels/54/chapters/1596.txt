Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hey, tonight is my night. How can you guys be so weak? I’m perfectly fine. No matter how drunk I am, I’ll be able to get up tomorrow.” Nox looked indifferent about the situation.

“You’ll see tomorrow.”

Edward and Finn were also speechless. However, they did not want to ruin Nox’s mood. After all, marriage was a major event in life. Since he was happy, it was only right for them to celebrate with him. As for whether he would live or die tomorrow, that was his own doing.

The few people in the room drank happily. At one point, Nox had drunk so much that he had to go to the bathroom to pee. After peeing, he was about to go out for more drinks when he pondered for a while and then gave Zoe a call.

Zoe quickly picked up. “Nox.”

“Where are you?” Nox asked.

“I’m at home, waiting for you to marry me tomorrow. I can’t sleep now.”

“I’m still drinking with Edward and the others at the nightclub.”

“Don’t get drunk. I don’t want the groom to be bedridden tomorrow, or I’ll get angry.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Don’t worry, I’ll get up even if I have to. I know what I’m doing.”

“Anyway, make sure you go back early.”

“Alright, alright. Rest early then. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“See you tomorrow.”

Zoe’s expression changed after hanging up the phone because she was not at home. On the contrary, she was celebrating at another nightclub. When she received Nox’s call, she got everyone to turn off the speakers to make it quiet.

In fact, she was starting to regret the idea that she was going to marry Nox tomorrow. She just felt that she had not had enough fun yet and was not ready to walk down the aisle.

Of course, she had never thought of coming out tonight. After all, she was getting married tomorrow and was afraid of being exposed. However, she could not resist the temptation of those friends of hers, so she came out in the end and made sure to choose a nightclub different from Nox’s. She even told the people at the nightclub to keep an eye on Nox’s movements. Once Nox left the nightclub, she would immediately return.

“Are you done?” An old lover beside her whispered intimately in her ear, “I can’t wait anymore.”

Having been teased, Zoe could not hold it in any longer, and the two of them hugged each other again. Then, they let themselves go.

Nox was forced to leave the nightclub at midnight because he actually puked blood! The moment he bent over the toilet bowl and threw up blood, he was shocked.

There was no way he was about to die. He was getting married tomorrow, and if word got out that he died tonight… would he be laughed at?

He squatted in the toilet for a long time. It was not until Finn knocked on his door to check on him that he opened it and said that there was blood in his puke. It obviously frightened the other four people in the room.

Finn glanced at the toilet bowl and then at Nox. “Let’s go to the hospital first.” He did not say anything else, but that one sentence was enough to scare Nox to death.

At that moment, Nox seemed to have sobered up. He asked, “Finn, do I have a terminal illness?”

Finn looked a little serious.

“F*ck, don’t scare me. I’m getting married tomorrow. I don’t want to die yet. I don’t even have a child yet. I can’t die just like that…” Nox broke down.

Finn glanced at Nox. “A scourge will live for a thousand years. Don’t worry, you won’t die.”

Nox was speechless. Was that supposed to comfort him?

After that, the group sent Nox to the hospital, and Nox did a full-body checkup. They confirmed that it was gastrointestinal bleeding caused by drinking too much and that he was not seriously ill.

Nox was lying on the hospital bed, receiving an IV transfusion, looking like he had nothing to live for.

“You’re not going to die. What’s with your expression?” Monica could not stand it anymore and could not help but scold Nox.

“I was just thinking. I have lived for 30 years, but this is the first time I’ve thrown up blood from being drunk. Am I that old now? I didn’t drink much, but why did I puke blood? If word gets out, how will people see me?”

Monica rolled her eyes. ‘F*ck, you’re an idiot!’

At that moment, Finn was also at a loss for words. He said, “It’s getting late. I’ll take Monica back first. She’s pregnant and can’t stay up too late.”

Nox wanted to stop him, but on second thought, he realized they had been through enough tonight. Moreover, Finn was old, and it was not easy for him to have a child…

As such, he waved his hand. “Go.”

Finn turned to Edward. “Fourth Master, Nox is fine. Why don’t we leave together?”

“If they leave, who will accompany me?”

“You can get Zoe to take care of you.”

“I won’t! No one else can learn about such an embarrassing matter.” “You’ll die trying to protect your pride.” Monica was speechless..
