Chapter 453: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide

Elaine turned to look at Eden.

At that moment, Eden was furious. His clenched fists were trembling non-stop.

He had never been so humiliated in his life.

He looked at Elaine with a ferocious expression. “I will never let that woman off. Never!”

“Let’s think about how to deal with your own mess first!” Henry said coldly, “I was hoping you would take back the family from Edward’s hands, but now it seems like I have really overestimated you!”

With that, Henry left in anger.

At that moment, Elaine comforted Eden. “Don’t worry. You’re still young, and I think highly of you.”

Eden’s body tensed as he tried his best to suppress his emotions.

He definitely had to get up again and let everyone look at him in a new light!

…

In the president of Swan Enterprise’s office, Edward walked in holding Jeanne’s hand.

Then, he naturally picked her up and sat her down on him on the huge sofa. The two of them looked very intimate.

Edward asked, “Why did you let Eden go?”

......

Jeanne glanced at Edward.

She did not think of letting him off. In fact, she planned to use this time to get something on Eden. She would first demean his self-esteem and then send him to prison.

On one hand, she really wanted to take revenge for Eden treating her like that, but seeing that Eden was now going against her everywhere, she had to get rid of the man.

However, Old Master Swan had sent her a message.

She handed her phone to Edward and said glumly, “Take a look for yourself.”

Edward took it and saw a message on the screen. “Don’t send Eden to prison. As for the rest, it’s up to you. Take it as your birthday present to me today.”

At the end of the day, Old Master Swan was still cunning.

He rejected Henry during the meeting because he did not want Henry to stir up trouble. When Old Master Swan handed the Swan Enterprise over to Edward, he handed everything over to him. By doing that, he was letting everyone know that Edward had absolute control over the company and they should listen to Edward in the future.

However, Eden was, after all, a descendant of the Swans and was quite capable. If she really sent Eden to prison, Old Master Swan would definitely not be able to take it, so he sent her a message.

She could identify from Henry’s words that she was the key to Eden’s actions this time.

Moreover, it was not appropriate for Edward to let Eden go.

Edward had to be fair and just. What was more, since it was obvious that Eden had offended her, it was a good idea for Old Master Swan to let her settle the issue.

The more Jeanne thought about it, the more she found Old Master Swan an old and cunning fox.

“Actually, you don’t have to please him.” After reading the text message, Edward said calmly.

“Hehe.” Jeanne laughed evilly.

In that case, she could say goodbye to living with the Swans!

Old Master Swan had the final say in the family. If she did not show him respect, would she not be courting death?

Moreover, after removing Eden from his position and dealing him such a heavy blow, Eden would not be able to stir trouble for quite some time. Even if he wanted to, he did not have the ability.

After weighing the pros and cons, she decided to show Old Master Swan some respect.

“Speaking of which, Edward, do you want me to send Eden to prison?” Jeanne suddenly asked him.

Even though Edward was on her side during the meeting, she still wanted to know what was on his mind.

Edward remained silent for two seconds.

Jeanne furrowed her brows. “You don’t want to?”

After all, Eden was also part of the Swans, and a Swan would always stand with a Swan.

It was just like seven years ago when she asked Edward for help, but he did not in the end.

Actually, when it came to matters involving family…

She understood.

“If Eden doesn’t take the wrong path, he’s not bad,” said Edward.

Jeanne smiled.

She knew that, deep down, Edward did not want to send Eden to prison. In that case, why did he tell her that she did not have to please Old Master Swan?

What a hypocritical man.

He was just as cunning as his father.

“The Swans’ business is huge, and I alone can’t manage it. Besides, I may not have time to manage it in the future, so someone has to inherit it. Although my eldest brother, sister, and even my third brother want to, they’re not young anymore. Even if I give it to them, how long can they manage it? In the end, it has to be given to the next generation.”

“So, you think Eden can do it?”

“Eden isn’t the best, but he can manage the company reluctantly. Moreover, it’s not too difficult to manage a company well,” Edward said casually.

She thought he was a little arrogant!

To say that managing a company with a market value of 100 billion was not difficult? Who was he kidding?

“Do you think Eden can do it now?” Jeanne asked.

She was worried that the fellow would reuse Eden soon.

After all, Eden was a Swan, and Edward had made it clear that he would be the next successor by having groomed him.

In fact, she was also a little puzzled.

No matter what, Edward was only four years older than Eden. Why did he want to groom Eden as the successor?

With their age gap, who knows if Eden might also be dead when Edward died?

“No,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne’s eyes moved.

“Eden has already gone astray, so it’s very difficult to pull himself back on the right path.” Edward said, “I didn’t stop you from sending Eden to prison today because I’m very clear Eden can’t turn back now. So, it’s not a shame to teach him a lesson and destroy him completely. But, of course, you didn’t send him to prison. From an emotional standpoint, I think I can accept it.”

“Don’t you have any other personal feelings for Eden?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

There was a hidden meaning behind her words.

Edward furrowed his brows.

“I’ve dated Eden before. Aren’t you jealous?” Jeanne looked at him.

She felt that Edward treated Eden very normally. It was the same as how the elders treated the younger generation.

He was even so sensible to nurture Eden.

Did he not have any selfish motives? Did he not hate Eden?

“I’ve gotten my share,” Edward said.

“Huh?” Jeanne looked at him.

Edward smiled.

The man seemed to have become fond of smiling.

“I’ve gotten my share, so I don’t need it anymore,” Edward said. “Now, my mind is at peace.”

“When did you get your share?” Jeanne was suddenly very curious.

Edward looked at her. “Do you want to know?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

She really felt that Edward did not seem to care that she had dated Eden before.

If Eden’s matter had not been exposed, Edward would have treated Eden the same way.

What should be given to Eden would still be given to him.

She looked straight at the man in front of her.

After a long while, she heard him say, “It has been too long. I forgot.”

D*mn!

She really wanted to swear!Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
