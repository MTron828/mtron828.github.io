Chapter 327: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

Jeanne pursed her lips, thinking that was also possible.

“You’d better have some self-awareness of what you’re getting yourself into with the marriage!” Alexander said fiercely.

At that moment, Jeanne said obediently, “Thanks for your advice.”

After that, she did not linger around and immediately went upstairs.

Seeing that Jeanne did not respect him at all, his expression remained grim.

Jenifer quickly comforted him, “Alexander, you’ve made your point across that the Fourth Master didn’t put so much effort into marrying Jeanne. First of all, with regards to the wedding, it would definitely be simple since they only have three days to prepare. Think about how grand Jasmine’s wedding was. Now that was a legitimate marriage. For the type of wedding Jeanne is having, this wedding is just for them to go through the motions, and the Swans definitely didn’t put too much effort into it. Then, the matter of the shares is hilarious. How could the Swans give the shares to Jeanne? Think about it. If they were really sincere, they would give it to you. Yet, they’re giving it to Jeanne, which means they’re trying to cover up the authenticity of the transfer of the shares. For the Swans to get to where they are now, there must be a reason behind it. You don’t have to be unhappy just because of Jeanne’s petty achievements.”

Rather than consoling Alexander, she was, in fact, consoling herself that that was all to Jeanne’s marriage to Fourth Master Swan.

Alexander snorted, seemingly persuaded by Jenifer.

Jenifer held Alexander’s hand. “At most, we’ll just go along with his acting. However, don’t flatter them too much, in case Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne break up one day and embarrass us.”

Alexander nodded and said fiercely, “I’d like to see how smug Jeanne will be at the wedding in three days!”

Jenifer quickly said, “She won’t be. It’s a simple wedding. No matter how nice it sounds, she will become a laughing stock in the end. Let’s wait and see!”

Jenifer smiled coldly.

When the time came, she could find a few reporters in private and deliberately mock Jeanne in the media.

......

That was her plan — her sinister plan.

The wedding three days later arrived as scheduled.

On the day of the wedding, the news broke out again.

After all, Fourth Master Swan’s prestige was too high, so his wedding naturally attracted the attention of everyone in the city.

For a moment, the topics were endless, and they were all on the trending lists.

Jeanne was woken up by the staff at 5 a.m.

She had worked overtime until 10 p.m. last night. When she returned home, removed her makeup, and washed up, it was already close to 12 a.m. Then, the thought of her getting married the next day gave her insomnia, and it was probably past 1 a.m. when she really fell asleep until she was woken up again.

She usually did not sleep much, but it was definitely not on the lesser end. She still needed seven or eight hours a day.

Moreover, she never thought she would be woken up at 5 a.m.

Was it not just putting on a wedding dress and makeup, and then waiting for Fourth Master Swan to pick her up?

Her thoughts were very simple.

She assumed that she would get up at 7 or 8 a.m.

Still, she still endured it at that moment and washed her face with cold water to force herself to wake up. As soon as she was fully awake, she was a little dumbfounded.

Were her eyes playing tricks on her?!

Why was she seeing a grand white wedding gown in her bedroom? It was exquisitely embroidered with a corset, and the sleeves at her waist were sewn with thin diamonds that dazzled under the light!

The gown was from a well-known designer in Harken who made wedding dresses, and only people with enough status could have it! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The wedding gown was hand-embroidered and hand-stitched, so it was expensive and took a long time to complete. How did Fourth Master Swan get them to do it in four days?

Could it be a replica?

“Ms. Lawrence, this wedding gown was hand-stitched by Harken’s top designer, Old Master Adams. It is hand-stitched with needle and thread, and it is priceless,” the staff introduced.

Jeanne frowned. “Isn’t Old Master Adams over 80 years old?”

“He personally guided his proudest disciple to complete it. However, the most classic part is the embroidery on the collar, which Old Master Adams personally sewed.” The staff member said, “A dress of his with that embroidery has been sold at a sky-high price of over a hundred million at the world auction house, but from then on, Old Master Adams never produced it again. It can be said that the piece you’re seeing now, Ms. Lawrence, is his final work. It’s not only worth a fortune, but it’s also priceless.”

In short, it was so expensive that no one could buy one.
