Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As for him, there were too many things that he needed to take into account. The power he had now was only the tip of the iceberg of the power he could control.

He was just a puppet arranged by someone and had no say in whether he lived or die.

“I don’t want you to die, ” Jeanne said.

Edward’s eyes seemed to move, and it looked like he was smiling. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t want you to die, ” Jeanne repeated.

Edward looked at her deeply.

“I never thought we would end up like this one day. Even if it has, I don’t want you to die because of me. I don’t want to be the one to kill you.” Jeanne said calmly, “I think that if we need to fight, I hope our lives will not end in each other’s hands.”

That was the best ending she could come up with for them.

No one was to blame.

It could only be said that it was the fault in their stars.

Seven years ago, they slipped through each other’s fingers, and seven years later, they had missed each other completely.

Everything they had together now was picked… borrowed, and anything borrowed would always be returned to its rightful owner.

Suddenly, she approached Edward and wanted to get close to his body, but she stopped.

He had too many wounds on his body, and she was afraid that he would be the one in pain if she got closer to him.

As such, she could only kiss his lips, the only place where he might not feel any pain.

As soon as she deepened the kiss on his cold lips, she felt his response.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

In fact, she thought Edward must hate her to the core. In order to save her, he risked his life, only to fall into her hands again.

If he did not come to save her, Kingsley would not have caught him.

If he had thought through it a little more, he would have known that Kingsley would make a move on him.

Kingsley did not have enough power in South Hampton City, but once he left South Hampton City and Edward was alone, it would be easy for Kingsley to take Edward down. Edward should know about that.

However, it was because of that that he turned around and left after his body’s reaction kicked in.

He thought that he might be able to escape amidst the chaos, but because of the drug, he lost his rationality and could not control his body and mind. Hence, he could only wander around that place ruthlessly, and it was easy for Kingsley’s men to find her. She even helped Kingsley capture him.

Their kiss went on for a long time in the cold basement.

After a long time, Jeanne moved away from his lips, and the first thing she said was, “Edward, who is he?”

Edward smiled again. It was a faint one, but the corners of his mouth were slightly raised.

He said, “It’s all a honey trap.”

Jeanne did not reply to him.

“Has it always been a honey trap?” he asked her.

He was asking her whether it had been a honey trap the entire time, ever since they got married.

Did she have no feelings for him?

Jeanne, however, did not answer as there were some things that she could not say. Instead, she said, “I promise you won’t die after you tell me.”

She would protect Edward even at the cost of her life.

Although Kingsley was wicked beyond redemption, he would tolerate her. Even if he might beat her to death, he would definitely stop a second before she died.

She was relying on the fact that Kingsley would not kill her to do many things as she pleased.

However, if she did too much, she might hurt Kingsley.

Edward could tell that she was very sincere.

He said, “Jeannie.”

He was still calling her Jeannie with that deep and attractive voice of his.

Every time he called her that, she would feel as if he was saying sweet nothings. He was doting on her and very, very warm.

Every time he called her that, she felt that he was saying sweet nothings, and it warmed her heart.

She bit her lip, trying her best and forcing herself to calm down.

Kingsley was always reminding her that she and Edward were on different sides and that two people with different standpoints would not have a happy ending.

She looked into Edward’s deep-set eyes and caught all of his emotions

“I was born because of him,” he said.

Jeanne was stunned.

That was the first time he acknowledged the existence of that person, the Duncans’ descendant.

“My life is his,” Edward told her.

His life was his, so how could he betray the man?

“I won’t hate you if I die,” Edward said.

He meant that even if Kingsley killed him, he would not hate her.

Jeanne’s eyes were a little red.
