Chapter 777: Jenifer Exposed, Utterly Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shocked, Jenifer glared at Jeanne.

She really did not to be counterattacked by that woman.

If not for Jasmine, she would destroy Jeanne for being ungrateful to her and insist that Jeanne was the one who deliberately framed her. Then, that matter would definitely be related to Jeanne.

Yet, because her biological daughter, Jasmine, had accused her of mistreating Jeanne in front of everyone and accused Eden of being cruel and cold-blooded, everyone was now on Jeanne’s side.

The prosecutors would also take that into account, and Jeanne would not have the motive to commit the crime. At the very least, even if Jeanne had the motive, she would not be able to convince Joshua to listen to her. They both did not get along, so Joshua would never follow Jeanne’s orders.

Despite that, Jenifer was smart as she immediately came up with a lot of ideas.

However, Jeanne was also smart.

She knew Jenifer had the brains, so she would definitely not allow her to leave. In order to protect herself, Jenifer would definitely have to tell the public everything.

The stalemate lasted for a few minutes until Jenifer said, “It was Eden who instructed me to do this.”

As soon as she said that, the crowd was in an uproar again.

After all that had happened, it turned out Jenifer was lying all along.

Jenifer said, “Eden told me this was the only way to prevent Joshua from receiving a heavy punishment. As a mother, I couldn’t just watch my son court his own death. So, I could only listen to Eden’s arrangements. I didn’t have a choice…”

As she said that, she started crying pitifully again.

However, no one at the scene sympathized with her. In fact, they even felt disgusted.

On the live stream, people kept saying, “This is too disgusting. I’ve never seen anyone more disgusting than Jenifer.”

“She even accused Jeanne of framing them. To think I was defending her just now.”

“Jeanne was wrongly accused. How can there be such a vicious stepmother in this world?”

“She’s a horrible human being!”

“Eden is a sc*m too. He chose to abandon Jeanne back then, and now that Jeanne is leading a good life, he’s unhappy about it? He’s simply a sc*mbag!”

“Fourth Master Swan, aren’t you going to come and comfort your wife? She’s been bullied by your nephew.”

On the screen, all of them had switched sides.

The reporters were also furious.

“Jenifer, don’t you think you’re evil for framing Jeanne for your son?”

“Are you trying to kill two birds with one stone? On one hand, you want to reduce your son’s crime, and on the other, you want to use the opportunity to take Lawrence Enterprise for yourself. You really did plan it out well.”

“Jenifer, you almost tricked me. You should be an actress. You’re so good at acting!”

No matter how much Jenifer pretended to be guilty and pitiful, she could not get any pity from anyone.

Finally, Jenifer had dug her own grave.

However, Jasmine remained indifferent.

The scene was a little chaotic until the police appeared.

The moment the police appeared, Jenifer suddenly panicked.

She watched as the police officers walked toward her and cuffed her hands. She asked, “Why are you arresting me?”

She was terrified.

“You’re suspected of framing others and violating the laws and regulations of Harken. You have to come to the police station with us for investigation.” The police officer made sure to enunciate his every word.

“I’ve told you everything. I said that it wasn’t Jeanne but Eden. I’ve said it, but why are you still arresting me?!” Jenifer was beyond blustered.

“It’s not just this one. For inciting Jasmine to drug Eden, inciting Sam Zimmer to rape Jeanne, and so on, we need you for investigation.”

“No, I won’t…” Jenifer kept refusing.

Nevertheless, the police dragged her away with brute force.

By then, Jenifer had gone mad. The moment she was dragged out of the door, she turned around and shouted at Jeanne, “You set me up! You set me up!”

Although Jenifer had admitted it, she was still taken away by the police, for admitting it would not help at all.

After all, she still had a lot of incriminating evidence, and the police would surely sentence her.

Jeanne was scheming against Jenifer just now to make the latter confess everything and clear her name.

In the end, Jenifer was taken away by the police, and it was all part of Jeanne’s scheme.

“Ah!” Jenifer screamed frantically.

She probably did not expect to face such an outcome.

Even a long time after Jenifer left, her heart-wrenching cries from earlier were still echoing in the air.

Jeanne looked back.

With the matter over, she bowed respectfully to all the reporters in front of her. “Thank you, everyone.”

“Ms. Lawrence, can you share your thoughts on this matter?”

“Ms. Lawrence, all these years, Jenifer has been targeting you and framing you. How did you get through it?”

“Ms. Lawrence, Jenifer’s true colors have been exposed, and she is now suffering the consequences. Do you have anything to say?”

The reporters asked excitedly.

However, Jeanne chose to ignore their questions.

After all, there was nothing much to say. The reporters had a rich imagination anyway and would come up with news that satisfied everyone.

As she turned around to leave, she dragged Jasmine along.

Jasmine was stunned, but she immediately followed Jeanne.

The two of them walked out of the living room.

Meanwhile, Nox was watching the show from the entrance of the conference room. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and fortunately, he did not miss it.

When he saw Jeanne walking over, he said, “Eden ran away.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

For domestic abuse and instigating others to commit crimes, Eden, of course, had to be punished by the law.
