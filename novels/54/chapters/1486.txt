Chapter 1487: Monica Suspects Candice’s Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I understand. How about this? I’ll arrange for a private doctor to do a check-up for you and take you there,” Monica quickly said.

It was obvious that she was not on good terms with Candice. However, whenever Candice was in trouble, she could not help but help her.

“Alright.”

“Wait for my call.”

“Are we going today?” Candice was still not mentally prepared for that.

“The sooner you die, the sooner you’ll be reborn.”

Was that appropriate to use that sentence here?

After Candice hung up the phone, she began to wait. However, she did not wait for long before Monica called. “I’ll pick you up in half an hour.”

“Alright.”

After hanging up the phone, she became very nervous. What if something really was wrong with her?

She took a deep breath, changed into a simple set of clothes, put on some light makeup, and walked out of the room. In the hall, Teddy was still busy with his work.

“Teddy.”

“Madam,” Teddy said respectfully.

“I have something to attend to now, and Paige is in class. If she doesn’t see me when she comes out, let her know that I’ll be back in a while. Tell her to be good at home.”

“Okay.”

“Don’t allow Chloe to give Paige ice cream anymore. Eating too much of that is not good for her.”

‘Yes.”

“Call me if you need anything.”

“Alright.” Teddy nodded.

Candice left the hall to wait after she gave her instructions.

Monica acted fast and arrived in a short while. She rolled down the window and said, “Get in the car.”

When Candice sat beside Monica, she noticed that Monica seemed to have gotten a little rounder recently, and her complexion looked pretty good.

“I just made an appointment with a private doctor. When we arrive at the hospital, we’ll also go through a VIP passageway. I’ve specially gotten someone to guard the entrance so that no one knows.”

“Thank you.” Candice thanked her.

“It’s nothing. I just can’t seem to say no to you,” Monica muttered, somewhat helpless.

Candice smiled and understood why she liked Monica so much. It was because she had a great personality.

The car soon arrived at the hospital, and there were indeed security guards around. Not even a fly could fly in.

Seeing how cautious Monica was with her, she felt touched. It had always seemed to her that Monica cared more about her than herself. Moreover, she was sure that Monica did not have all that special treatment when she did her own prenatal check-up.

The two of them walked into the doctor’s office together. After asking about the general situation, they began to do a series of tests. As it was exclusive to VIPs, the check-up was very fast.

Candice was still very nervous when she received the results.

She and Monica sat in front of the doctor as the doctor looked at the medical report and said, “There’s no problem. Everything is normal.”

“Normal? In that case, why haven’t I gotten pregnant? I don’t use any contraceptives.” Candice heaved a sigh of relief but could not help but ask.

“Actually, pregnancy varies from person to person. Some can get pregnant very quickly, but some would take a longer time. This is a little odd to say, but timing is very important.” The doctor explained, “But there’s one thing I need to remind you. You don’t have to have sex so frequently.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The moment he said it, Monica could not help but laugh. Candice blushed in embarrassment, and she glared at Monica.

Monica immediately pulled herself together. “Sorry, doctor. Please continue.”

The doctor was also made a little embarrassed by Monica. After a long while, he recovered and said, “Because if it’s too frequent, it may lead to a lack of quality in the sperm, which would also affect conception. So, I suggest that you have sex once every three days before you ovulate, once a day during the ovulating period, and once every three days after the ovulating period. Other than that, when you’re ovulating, it’s best you use…”

The doctor gave some professional advice and guidance, and Candice listened attentively.

Monica, who was also listening from the side, thought, ‘Are there so many things to take note of during pregnancy?’

How could it have been so easy for her to get pregnant with the two little things in her belly?

The more she thought about it, the more she found it unacceptable.

“Lastly, I’ll prescribe some medicine to help you nourish your body and relieve your psychological stress. You should also prioritize relaxation and don’t think too much. Just do as I say. Sometimes, one’s mood would affect one’s pregnancy,” the doctor reminded. “Okay. thank you, doctor.”

“You’re welcome.” The doctor smiled.

With that, Candice and Monica left the hospital.

In the car, Monica suddenly asked, “Did you discuss this matter with the Leader?”
