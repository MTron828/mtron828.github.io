1364 The Wedding Night: From Now On, I Will Sleep In

It was the wedding of the Leader of Harken, and with the blessings of the people of the country, the ceremony was completed.

Candice followed Edward back to Bamboo Garden.

She had expected today’s wedding to be like that, following the rules. However, when she really experienced it, she felt a little disappointed.

From the beginning to the end of the wedding, there was no anticipation at all.

She was actually… holding onto a little bit of hope.

Last night, she received a call from Edward in the middle of the night. He said that he had just returned from drinking with his friends.

She had always thought of Edward as the kind of person who was aloof and out of touch with the world. After all, he was the Leader of the Harken, and his status was high! However, when he called her last night, she vaguely felt that he was like most men. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In private, he lived like everyone else and also had a bachelor party. His expectations for marriage and love were not as indifferent as she had imagined. Moreover, he was unlike what the rumors said about him using women for the sake of his political career.

It seemed like the more she interacted with Edward, the more she found him to be different from the rumors.

The two of them did not talk for long. It was as if they were also holding in what they really felt.

After all, they had only known each other for a month. During that month, Edward was very busy, and they could count the number of times they saw each other. Hence, the two of them were not very familiar with each other, and as such, they kept a lot of their feelings to themselves.

Before he hung up the phone, she heard Edward say, “Candice, I’ll bring you home with me tomorrow.”

The word ‘home’ made Candice’s heart pound. She even felt a little uneasy.

It was as if there was something stuck in her heart, like a bad memory. She could not recall it in her mind, but her body would instinctively remember, so the uneasiness would translate to her body.

However, she had to admit that she was touched by Edward’s words.

That sentence made her feel that Edward really liked her and that Edward’s marriage with her was not just a formality. After all, their relationship was a typical political marriage.

Early that morning, Edward’s wedding convoy arrived at the Nicholsons’ residence. Everyone was respectful when Edward appeared to pick her up before he left with her.

The festive atmosphere was everywhere, but the people who were getting married and those attending the wedding did not dare to do anything inappropriate.

Needless to say, the wedding venue was even more impressive.

The form was more important than anything else.

Candice even felt that under so many cameras, she and Edward barely exchanged glances.

The two of them had been working hard to maintain their best state from the beginning to the end. They could not let themselves make any mistakes in front of the entire country.

Fortunately, it was finally over. When she got into Edward’s car, the camera finally disappeared in front of them, and she could relax.

Candice watched as the car stopped at Bamboo Garden.

She had stayed here for a night before, but did she really have to stay here forever from now on?

Her heartbeat was racing because he suddenly thought of something — tonight was the wedding night.

The overly solemn wedding ceremony today had made her forget that there was a more important part of the wedding besides the ceremony…

She bit her lip lightly.

The moment the car door opened, she was about to get out of the car when a certain someone suddenly picked her up.

Candice’s heart skipped a beat, and she looked at Edward, watching as he suddenly lifted her up. It made her blush and her heart race.

However, she hugged his neck shyly and allowed him to carry her quietly into the living room of Bamboo Garden, which was filled with wedding decorations.

It was also not too late in the night now.

After all, as the Leader of Harken, it was impossible for him to greet the guests personally, and they could leave only after the banquet ended. Then, there would be someone to pick up the guests who came to attend the wedding.

Therefore, it was only past 8 p.m. at most.

At that time, neither the two children nor Teddy would be asleep. However, there was no one in the house.

Even Edward’s personal guards were left outside the living room of Bamboo Garden. It felt as if tonight really belonged to the two of them.

Candice tried to calm her heartbeat.
