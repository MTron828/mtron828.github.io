1356 I Actually Don’t Love You That Much

He felt a little angry.

Why did she feel so out of place in the corridor of the nightclub, which was a familiar environment to him?

He was only 30 years old. Why did he feel like he was in his 70s or 80s?

His footsteps were a little fast as he just wanted to get out of this place. However, he accidentally bumped into the person coming toward him.

“Are you blind–” A man’s angry voice sounded.

However, before he could finish his sentence, the man was stunned because he saw that it was Nox.

Of course, the man was not the only one who was stunned. The woman beside the man, Zoe, was also stunned.

Zoe was surprised to see Nox, who was also stunned to see Zoe.

After a while, Zoe asked, “Nox, why are you here?”

“Why are you here?” Nox’s eyes narrowed.

Did Zoe frequent nightclubs too?

He had never heard her mention it before.

Zoe quickly explained, “Oh, I had a class reunion dinner. I was planning to go back after dinner, but when I thought that since you weren’t home and I hadn’t seen my classmates for many years, I agreed to stay here for a while. I was planning to leave too.”

Nox frowned as they were in the wrong direction.

Zoe seemed to have reacted as well. “I just wanted to say bye to my classmates before I leave.”

Nox did not think too much of it. He simply nodded and said, “In that case, go and tell them. I’ll wait for you here, and we’ll leave together.”

“Okay, I’ll be right back,” Zoe said.

With that, she left quickly with a man.

Once they left Nox’s sight, Zoe took a deep breath.

She was still afraid, but fortunately, she did not do anything out of line when they bumped into each other just now. Otherwise…

It seemed she had to be more careful in the future.

In fact, she was already very careful.

She was only here tonight because she thought that Nox was relaxing with the Leader and definitely would not come to such a place. She felt that it did not fit with the Leader’s identity.

“Ah!” Zoe cried out in surprise.

The man beside her suddenly pulled her into his arms.

“Are you crazy?!” Zoe could not help but curse. “Didn’t you see Nox over there?!”

“I can’t bear to part with you.” The man started touching Zoe.

He kept kissing her face.

“Enough. This is just for fun. Cut it out.” Zoe pushed the man away.

The man smiled. “Tell me, why are you giving up such a good thing for a man?”

“When did I give it up? We can still have fun together if we have the chance.”

“You’re really brave to cheat on Nox.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Are you afraid?” Zoe said provocatively.

“If I am, would I dare to do this to you now?”

“Hey, you– Oh…”

The man kissed Zoe crazily again.

The two of them were having an affair in a place out of Nox’s sight, and they were so aroused by that.

Shelly walked past them with a tray in her hand. As soon as she turned the corner, she saw Nox standing there.

She wondered if she should tell him that his fiancée was having an intimate moment with another man ten meters away from him.

However, she thought about it and found it unnecessary.

Perhaps that was the type of woman that Nox liked. After all, when he was fooling around with women back then, he was no less than Zoe cheating on him now.

She walked past Nox indifferently.

Nox frowned and turned his head to look at the woman who walked past him, but all he saw was her back.

Somehow, he found it somewhat familiar, but he could not remember where she had seen it before.

He looked at the figure in a daze.

“Nox.” Zoe’s voice sounded from behind.

Nox came back to his senses. “Are you done?”

“Yes.” Zoe smiled, still maintaining her ladylike appearance.

“Let’s go.” Nox pulled Zoe away calmly.

He was still thinking about it when he left. Where had he seen the woman who had just walked past him?

…

Finn did not think he would make his way to the entrance of Monica’s neighborhood.

He was not drunk when he left the nightclub, but he did drink quite a bit. Then, when he regained his senses, he was already there.

The driver said it was the address he had given, so Finn smiled faintly and got out of the car.

...

Just like that, he stood outside the neighborhood and looked at Monica’s apartment building.
