Chapter 22: Eldest Young Lady Lawrence Has Quite a Personality!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Lawrence family’s manor.

Alexander personally went over to welcome Fourth Master Swan. The rest of the people also rushed over.

In an instant, Fourth Master Swan became the center of attention.

Jeanne held on to her son’s hand and directly walked to the side.

Fourth Master Swan seemed to have taken a glance in that direction, but it also seemed to be an illusion.

In another corner of the hall.

A few women were muttering softly.

“Octavia, Jeanne was deliberately making you and your grandson look bad,” a woman gossipped, “I’ve never seen someone who embarrasses her future mother-in-law. I’m afraid she’ll step on your head after she gets married to your son in the future.”

“That’s right. Jeanne is too much. She didn’t give you any face at all...”

Octavia was already displeased, to begin with. She looked grimmer after hearing what those women said.

She had deliberately let her grandson perform on such an occasion to compare him with George. She wanted to make George appear useless and to vent her anger at the party last time! It never occurred to her that George, that unremarkable illegitimate child, was a piano genius. The thought of her grandson being outclassed by an illegitimate child made her even angrier!

“That said, I really didn’t expect that son of Jeanne to be so capable. I thought he was just a good-for-nothing,” a woman added.

“Yeah, I was also stunned. Oh right, did you see? Even Fourth Master Swan gave him a round of applause just now.”

“I saw. Fourth Master Swan is such a cold and aloof person, yet he applauded for a child... I’m afraid that Eldest Young Lady Lawrence will become more arrogant...”

When Octavia heard their conversation, she almost flew into a rage.

She looked fierce.

‘No matter what, I’ll teach Jeanne a lesson!;

…

In a corner of the hall.

Monica quickly rushed to Jeanne from the entrance, “Jeannie.”

Jeannie could not stand Monica’s enthusiasm.

So did George.

Monica tried her best to pick up George and said excitedly, “Godson, you made me so excited just now. How can you be so amazing? How can your fingers be so flexible?”

Jeanne looked at Monica speechlessly. She looked at her lifeless son.

“Godmother, put me down.” George was very cold.

Monica also found it hard to carry George. She put him down and turned her head to look at Jeanne seriously. “I think I misunderstood you before.”

Jeanne frowned.

‘Was Monica always incoherent when she spoke?!’

“You didn’t come back to be trampled on. You came back to shine,” Monica said confidently.

Jeanne smiled faintly. “Whatever you say...”

Her voice became softer.

Monica followed Jeanne’s gaze and turned around. She saw Fourth Master Swan.

He was walking over with Teddy.

Apart from Teddy, there was also Finn and…

“Nox,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly said.

Jeanne frowned.

‘I didn’t say anything. Can he read minds?!’

“You called for me?” Nox, who was next to Fourth Master Swan, was confused.

He came here with Finn and the others. When he arrived, he saw a child playing the piano. He was shocked and felt that the child looked familiar.

Fourth Master Swan ignored Nox and said to Jeanne, “Eldest Young Lady Lawrence, please take us to Old Master Lawrence so that we can give him our wishes.”

Jeanne glanced at Fourth Master Swan and turned around. “Julie.”

A servant quickly came over.

“Take Fourth Master Swan and his friends to Old Master’s room.”

“Yes, Eldest Young Lady Lawrence.”

After giving her instruction, Jeanne smiled politely at the others. Then, she turned around and left.

Everyone just looked at her.

Even Monica was a little stunned at that moment and could not react in time.

Nox could not help but say, “Eldest Young Lady Lawrence has quite a personality! Every woman would be attracted to you, Fourth Master, yet she did not even lift her eyelids.”

Monica came back to her senses. “Jeannie is just unordinary. How can she be compared to those women you’re talking about?”

“Hey, Monica, no one will take you for a mute if you don’t speak.”

“You too.”

“Back then, I must’ve been out of my mind to help you go after Finn.”

“Back then, I must’ve also been out of my mind to ask you to help me go after Finn...”

Finn pursed her lips and turned to look at Edward. “Fourth Master Swan, the luncheon is about to start.”

What he meant was it was their time to go pay their respects.

Fourth Master Swan looked away from Jeanne and nodded slightly.

With that, the group went upstairs and went to Old Master Lawrence’s room.

Downstairs.

Jasmine looked at their backs and turned to face Eden. “Your fourth uncle.”

“Yeah.” Eden nodded.

He naturally saw his fourth uncle when he came.

In the past, his fourth uncle would not attend such banquets…

“Was your fourth uncle talking to my sister just now?” Jasmine asked, looking very innocent.

Eden’s expression darkened slightly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The last time, he also took the initiative to give my sister the sapphire. Could it be that your fourth uncle...”

“Impossible!” Eden denied it immediately. “My fourth uncle couldn’t have been seduced by Jeanne. She’s not so capable!”

Jasmine did not speak.

She could not let Jeanne seduce Fourth Master Swan as well. If that were to happen, would she be able to live well in the future?!

“Jeanne’s best friend, Monica. Her husband is my fourth uncle’s personal doctor. They just happened to meet,” Eden said with certainty.

Jasmine smiled. “I guessed as much. How could someone like your fourth uncle fall for a woman who gave birth to a child? Speaking of which, I didn’t expect George to play the piano so well when he looks dumb and stupid. It surprised me. That said, Jeanne doesn’t know how to restrain herself. She’s deliberately trying to compare her son with that child from the Lockes. Isn’t she afraid that the Lockes will deliberately make things difficult for her once she becomes a part of their family? It has been so many years, but she still doesn’t know how to conduct herself. She’s still so arrogant.”

“She’ll have a hard time in the future!” Eden said coldly.

Jasmine laughed internally.

She was just testing Eden’s feelings for Jeanne. Back then, they broke up because she interfered. She was afraid that Eden would be seduced by Jeanne again. Now, it seemed that Eden was still disgusted with Jeanne.

To Jasmine, the most important thing for her at the moment was to successfully become a Swan. Once that happened, she would no longer have to bear the title of an illegitimate daughter. In the future, everyone would have to suck up to her!

When she thought of the days to come, her mood instantly improved.

As for Eden, who was beside her, he did not look any better.

Jeanne’s return this time did not seem to be as simple as they thought!
