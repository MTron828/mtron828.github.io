Chapter 116: Who Wouldn’t Know How to Play the Emotional Card?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Of course, Jeanne took the initiative to express her achievements just to gain Jonathan’s trust.

Everyone in the Lawrence family was playing the emotional card, so she should return the favor.

Whether she could take the majority of the Lawrence?Enterprise’s shares from Jonathan, in the end, was still unknown. For a crafty old man like Jonathan, Jeanne still had a long way to go.

She went downstairs to the dining room for breakfast.

Alexander and Jenifer sat on the sofa in the living room. They had gone for a morning jog and even had breakfast.

“Jeanne, you’re awake?” Jenifer saw Jeanne coming downstairs and took the initiative to greet her.

Jenifer believed that no matter how bad their relationship was in private, on the surface, she would always be amiable and considerate.

“Yes.”

“Where’s George?”

“He’s still sleeping.”

“What time is it?” Alexander suddenly said. “Don’t you have any rules for your child?”

“He doesn’t have to go to school on weekends. There’s no point in waking up so early.”

“You can read books and memorize texts. Your memory is the best in the morning.”

“George has a photographic memory, regardless of the time,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Alexander’s expression changed slightly.

At that moment, he could not say a single word because of Jeanne’s rebuke.

“Oh right, mother.” Jeanne did not bother to say another word to Alexander. She turned her head and faced Jenifer directly, “I’ll have to trouble you with George during this period of time. I have a friend who just lost his job. I asked him to come specially to be George’s chauffeur. From tomorrow onwards, my friend will be able to pick him up and send him off. As for the salary, mother can pay him the same price as the chauffeur who was fired last time. I remember that it was 8,000 yuan a month. I’ve asked.”

Jenifer paused.

The chauffeur who was fired last time was a relative of hers, so his salary was naturally twice that of an average person. Now, of course, she wasn’t willing to pay a chauffeur such a high salary. However, she could not say it out loud. If she said it out loud, it would be favoritism, and it would ruin her image. Moreover, she had originally found another person for the job, who was also her distant relative. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

All the servants in the house were carefully selected by her. The purpose was that they had to be her people. Otherwise, how could she control this family well?

She said, “Jeannie, I have already found a driver for George. Because of some personal matters at the last minute, it will take a few days...”

“Mother, my friend will be here tomorrow. You can reject that chauffeur of yours.” Jeanne said bluntly.

Jenifer still wanted to say something.

Jeanne yawned. “I’m going to have breakfast.”

She did not give Jenifer the chance to speak at all.

Jenifer held back her anger. She turned her head to look at Alexander. Seeing that he did not speak to her at all, she felt a little uncomfortable in her heart. She said aggrievedly, “Jeanne still doesn’t treat me as her mother.”

As she said that, she sighed heavily.

Alexander was reading the newspaper. When he heard Jenifer’s words, he turned to look at her. “Bear with it. I can’t afford to offend the current Jeanne.”

Jenifer was stunned for a moment before she felt even more aggrieved. “Hubby, what do you mean by that? Don’t tell me that I’ll have to bear with her bossing me around from now on?”

“Or else? Right now, my dad wants me to treat Jeanne well. After all, her abilities in the business world are indeed outstanding. Don’t feel bad about it. You can only blame the pair of children you gave birth to. None of them are promising.”

Jenifer held her breath.

It was clear that she wanted to increase the distance between them, yet she was insulted instead.

What was so bad about Jasmine and Joshua?

Jenifer was furious.

She did not believe that she could not defeat Jeanne.
