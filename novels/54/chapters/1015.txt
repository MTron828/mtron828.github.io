1016 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

Monica fell backward.

Sarah quickly supported her and said in a choked voice, “Cousin.”

Monica looked at the doctor in disbelief, thinking, ‘You must be joking.’

Why was he saying that her father would not wake up?

They said her father would not wake up the last time he was sent to the hospital, but he did. Yet, this time, they said he could not wake up again.

No. There was no way he would not wake up. How could her father not wake up?

“This is even more serious than the patient’s first emergency heart surgery.” The doctor said, “So, you have to be mentally prepared.”

Monica shook her head.

She could not prepare herself mentally because she refused to accept that her father would never wake up again.

“We really tried our best.” The doctor bowed.

Perhaps he felt guilty because of that sudden incident, but he had really tried his best.

Monica’s eyes reddened.

Why should she accept their best efforts?

If not for the doctor’s own issues, his father would not have had to suffer so much. If not for the doctor…

Monica’s vision was blurred. In a daze, all she could see was her father being pushed out.

Ron and Yvonne quickly walked over and called out emotionally, “Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!”

However, Gary did not respond.

At that moment, Ruby had also stood up from her chair. Her body looked so thin, and her face looked so pale.

In fact, all the people waiting outside had not eaten or drunk anything today.

Some nurses had sent food over, but none of them touched it, and no one forced anyone to eat it.

Monica looked at her mother walking over with difficulty and looking at Gary, who was lying on the mobile bed with a frighteningly pale face.

As she looked at him, she collapsed.

“Sister! Sister!” Ron pulled her into his arms and called out to her.

Ruby fainted on the spot.

Ron was so frightened that he called for the doctor.

For a moment, the corridor was a little chaotic.

Ruby and Gary were both sent away.

Gary was sent to the intensive care unit as he could no longer stay in the high-end VIP ward, while Ruby, once it was confirmed that she fainted because she was too sad, was sent to a ward to rest.

Monica stayed by her mother’s side the whole time as she was afraid that her mother would take things.

In the operating theatre, a nurse took the caretakers to clean up and disinfect the place.

At that moment, she saw Dr. Jones sitting in the operating theatre for a long time.

“Dr. Jones?” The nurse was shocked.

The surgery was over, but why was he still here?

Finn’s eyes moved. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What’s wrong? Did the surgery take too long? Are you low on blood sugar? Do you want me to get you a bag of glucose?” the nurse quickly asked.

Finn waved his hand, and as he stood up from the ground, he did feel a little dizzy.

The surgery was indeed very long, and he was physically exhausted. However, he did not leave was because he did not know how to face Monica and her family.

That surgery would have gone very smoothly if it had not been for that accident midway through, but because of that accident, a mistake happened.

He knew very well that there was a 90 percent chance that the area of Gary’s brain damage would turn him into a vegetable, and that 10 percent chance was almost negligible for ordinary people.

“Dr. Jones,” The nurse quickly held him up, a little nervous about his physical condition.

Once Finn calmed himself down, he pushed the nurse away and left the operating room.

After he left, he returned to his office, where he took off his surgical gown, changed into his usual white coat, and told his assistant to bring him a bag of glucose water.

In fact, he had drunk a lot during the surgery, but he drank some more before leaving the office.

“Do you want to eat something?” his assistant asked him.

Finn waved his hand.

Then, he walked towards Gary’s intensive care unit.

From afar, he could see a figure standing there and looking at the person lying inside as if she had shut herself from the world.

As he walked over, she did not even move her eyes.

The two of them just stood there in silence for a long time, so long that her legs seemed to be numb.

Monica turned around and left.

Her mother was still asleep, but she was afraid that her mother would be scared when she woke up.

“I’m sorry.”

Monica suddenly stopped in her tracks.

Her throat moved slightly.

In fact, she did not blame Finn. She knew that he had tried his best. After all, he must not have expected such an accident to happen during the surgery.

If she really wanted to blame him… what reason did she have to blame him?

Besides, what was the point of blaming him?

Could they redo her father’s surgery again? Then, would her father wake up?

She asked, “Was the doctor fainting an accident?”

Monica was calm, and it surprised Finn a little.

During the operation, he could not allow himself to be distracted at all. He had to use every second to give the people outside a little confidence, even though he knew very well that it would be difficult for Gary to wake up again after that surgery.

After the surgery, he thought about many things.

He wondered whether Monica would find it hard to accept and, if so, what would make Monica accept that reality.
