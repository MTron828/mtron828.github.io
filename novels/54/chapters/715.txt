“Ah!” Another scream sounded behind her.

Jeanne thought she might die together with Greg when a pair of big hands suddenly grabbed her ankles.

Just as she was about to fall, someone held onto her tightly.

Jeanne did not know who it was, but she did not think it was Eden, who wished she would die together with Greg!

Nevertheless, she forced herself to calm down and hold onto Greg tightly.

Greg was scared out of his wits, so much that his entire face was pale.

He did not dare to move, and neither did Jeanne, as someone pulled them up slowly.

The people around did not even dare to go up to help. They were afraid that once they went over, someone would fall.

Jeanne used all her strength to grab onto Greg while the person who grabbed her ankle used all their strength to pull her up.

Finally, Jeanne was safe, and so was Greg.

Once Greg was on the rooftop, his entire body suddenly collapsed onto the floor as if his body was drained of energy. He was so scared that his face was blue.

Although Jeanne’s reaction was not as obvious as Greg, the taste of death still made her body tremble uncontrollably. When she thought of that moment just now, she would still be afraid and a little scared.

If Edward came a little later…

That was right.

After she came up, she saw Edward, who had disappeared for more than half a month, in front of her.

She looked at him and saw that his hands were also trembling. She did not know if he had overexerted himself while pulling them up or if he was just as afraid as she was.

She simply stared at him without saying anything, as if that gaze held countless emotions.

Jeanne thought, ‘If Lucy isn’t dead… No. There are no ifs.’

She suppressed her emotions and looked at Edward.

The silence between the two of them lasted only a few seconds before the senior management’s directors and employees surrounded them. “President Lawrence, are you alright?”

“Are you alright, President Lawrence?”

“President Lawrence, you scared me just now...”

Jeanne tried to keep herself calm and said, “I’m fine. Someone call 911 and send Greg to the hospital. We will continue with the meeting.”

She said those words in a domineering manner and left Edward’s side.

She could not express her gratitude to him, but... she had no reason to blame him.

After all, he had just saved her. Moreover, assassins existed to kill or be killed. There was no such thing as revenge.

With that, she left the scene with Lawrence Enterprise’s senior management.

Greg also left the scene with some of the people.

Eden failed once again, but he did not dare to show it on his face. He gritted his teeth and left as well.

“Eden,” Edward called out to him.

Eden was shocked. However, he had no choice but to stop.

With everyone else gone, only Eden and Edward were on the rooftop.

Eden forced himself to look indifferent and appear respectful. “Fourth Uncle, you’re back.”

However, Edward just looked at him, and it made Eden’s hair stand on end.

He said, “Fourth Uncle, you came back at the right time. Otherwise, Jeanne would have fallen off the ledge. I didn’t even manage to pull them up– Ah!”

The words at the tip of Eden’s tongue suddenly disappeared.

He widened his eyes and looked at his Fourth Uncle’s hand that had grabbed him by the neck.

Edward’s grip on his neck was so strong that other than feeling suffocated, he could not fight back.

His eyes were about to pop out of their sockets, and his face was getting paler and paler. He felt that his Fourth Uncle might strangle him to death in the next second.

However, he was not. Instead, he was suddenly hung off the rooftop by his Fourth Uncle.

“Ah!” Eden was so scared that he instinctively grabbed his Fourth Uncle’s arm!

Edward did not push him away, but he did not pull him in either.

“Fourth Uncle! Fourth Uncle, help me up! Help me up, Fourth Uncle...” Eden was so scared that his face was pale.

For the first time, he felt that he was going to die.

He said, “Fourth Uncle, I’m your biological nephew. You can’t treat me like this. Fourth Uncle, help me up. I beg you to help me up...” Eden could not care less anymore and kept begging for mercy.

“Eden, have you forgotten what I said to you?”

“I haven’t forgotten. I really haven’t–”

“My kindness to you has its limits.” Edward’s face turned cold.

“Fourth Uncle, I was wrong. I won’t target Jeanne anymore. I swear. Please pull me up. I beg you...” Eden was so scared that he lost all his principles and his care for his image.

All he knew was that if his Fourth Uncle let go, he would definitely die.

No. He did not want to die.

He was only 25 years old. He could not die yet.

“Fourth Uncle, I’ve learned my mistake. I will not provoke Jeanne anymore. I will definitely not–” Eden cried and begged for mercy.

Edward’s throat moved before he pulled Eden up abruptly and threw him on the ground.

Eden was so scared that he fell to the ground and could not move.

He almost died just now, and at the thought of it, he got so scared that his body went limp.

Edward stood in front of Eden condescendingly. “Next time, I will let go.”

Eden looked at his Fourth Uncle who turned around and left after saying those words, leaving Eden laying on the ground. His heart was beating faster and faster.

He was reluctant to give in, but he had never been his Fourth Uncle’s opponent since he was young!

He gritted his teeth.

No. He absolutely couldn’t tolerate living his life under the control of his Fourth Uncle!

One day, he would let his Fourth Uncle know just how powerful he was!
