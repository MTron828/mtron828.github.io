Chapter 446: Humiliating Eden In Public
Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation
Eden gritted his teeth.

It was better to be caught for a work mistake than to be caught for deliberately ruining the company’s interests. As such, he said, “That is indeed my fault. I was too busy, so I didn’t have time to report it to the president. I am willing to accept the punishment.”

“So, you still won’t admit that you deliberately gave money to the Chamber of Commerce, huh?”

“It’s not that I don’t want to admit it, but I didn’t do it at all.” Eden was very certain.

“I originally thought you had your reasons for doing so, Director Eden. After all, my purpose here today is just to find out the truth. Perhaps I don’t understand how allocating money to the Chamber of Commerce is useful to our Swans?” Jeanne said calmly.

“It’s not.” Henry interrupted, “This kind of thing doesn’t benefit Swan Enterprise, and we won’t take out such a huge sum of money.”

Jeanne raised her eyebrows. “Is that so? Since that’s the case, I won’t beat around the bush anymore.”

Eden frowned. Could it be that the woman was hiding something?

She had just told him so much and forced him to deny that he was related to the issue with the Chamber of Commerce.

However, once he was exposed, he would not be able to explain himself.

He gritted his teeth.

He had to admit that he was very nervous. His entire body was drenched in cold sweat as he looked at Jeanne, watching her open a video on the USB drive.

In the video was the person in charge of One Organization.

......

Eden’s expression was very ugly.

Jeanne opened the video and played it.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The person in charge of One Organization said to the big screen, “Director Eden kept looking for me and asking me to help him allocate a sum of money to the Chamber of Commerce in Minze District to support an in-store bulk-buying campaign of theirs. Because the amount of money for this activity was too large, he needed me to split the amount of money for them. Since it doesn’t violate the rules, and I have a close relationship with Swan Enterprise, I agreed to it without hesitation. Of course, my organization was not the only one that got the money. Five other public welfare organizations were also involved. I received 48 million yuan, but I’m not sure how much the other organizations got.”

With that, the video ended.

Jeanne turned to look at Eden, whose face was red with anxiety.

Back then, he had clearly explained to those people and told them not to say anything to anyone. If they did, they knew the consequences.

Moreover, he trusted those people more, but he did not expect that they would still betray him!

In fact, he had never thought that Jeanne would go so deep into investigating it, so he only explained it to those people without threatening them.

However, the people in the business world were all shrewd people, and a word from him was enough to warn them.

Unless there were other conflicts of interest, which he had no choice but to admit!

Eden glared fiercely at Jeanne.

Jeanne looked into his eyes and even smiled. She said, “I discovered some things he did that could not see the light of day, and in exchange, he admitted it.”

“This is slandering! You’re deliberately getting people to slander me!” Eden said, refusing to admit it.

“Of course, you can doubt me.” Jeanne nodded. “But I’m only here today to confirm the facts with you. There’s nothing I can do if you don’t admit it. After all, I can’t legally do anything to you! However, I am one who will always see things through to the end. I now suspect that you have deliberately and illegally split the Swans’ donation amount, causing a huge loss to Swan Enterprise’s business. I will take my evidence to the court, and then, I can let the court give you the justice you deserve.”

“Jeanne!” Eden burst out in rage. “The law is based on facts. What benefits do I get from doing this and from financially subsidizing the Chamber of Commerce? Would I profit from it myself? I didn’t take a single cent more from Swan Enterprise or gain any benefits from it. By doing this, you’re only creating more conflicts within the family and damaging our reputation! You’re simply unreasonable!”

“It’s true. You didn’t profit from it,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

That was why Eden was still confident at that moment.

“But that doesn’t mean you can’t gain benefits from doing so!” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Your benefits aren’t money but to suppress me.”

“What are you talking about?” Eden refused to admit it.

“It’s a simple answer. As everyone knows, you and I parted on bad terms. Don’t deny you can’t bear to see me doing well, as I can’t with me. Right now, Lawrence Enterprise is piloting an online e-commerce project. But coincidentally, just at the time and the area of our pilot, a sale started, so our online project naturally suffered heavy losses!”
