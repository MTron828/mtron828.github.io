“Is he very handsome?” A certain someone did not seem to want to give up on that topic.

“Aren’t you very confident in your own looks?”

“That means I don’t mind my wife looking at other men.”

“You’re so petty,” Jeanne grumbled. Then, she finished a pastry and frowned. “I want something chocolate flavored.”

They were all pure cream, which he found too greasy.

“I’m allergic,” Edward said.

“But I’m not allergic,” Jeanne told him seriously.

“No, if you eat it, I’ll have an allergic reaction,” Edward retorted.

That man was too much of a bully. Why could she not eat what he could not?

“If you don’t believe me, try it.” Edward raised his eyebrows.

Of course, Jeanne did not believe him.

Could it be that he was possessed? He was allergic to the things she had eaten.

She called the waiter who was walking around her. “Please get me a chocolate cake. The kind with a lot of chocolate.”

“Alright,” the waiter said respectfully.

After a while, Jeanne was served a chocolate cake.

She took a spoonful and liked the taste. Happiness was written all over her face.

Hence, she scooped another spoonful and put it in her mouth.

“Oh!” Jeanne’s eyes widened.

On top of the rich chocolate, there was also the strong scent of Edward between her lips. He had even licked everything in her mouth.

She finally understood why he would be allergic to her eating chocolate.

Oh, that slutty man…

That happened under everyone’s gazes.

Although they were standing in a relatively hidden place, there were still many people around them.

“What is this?” Suddenly, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in her ears.

Jeanne was stunned.

She hurriedly pushed Edward away, with her face red, especially since they had been discovered.

She really wanted to dig a hole in the ground and hide.

They turned around to see Nox, who had just arrived at the banquet hall and was very unhappy. “What is this public display for affection as soon as I walk in?”

Jeanne was speechless.

Edward, however, ignored him. He was still unhappy that Nox interrupted their moment.

Nox pretended not to see Edward’s expression. In fact, he looked carefree and at ease.

“You received an invitation too.” Edward casually picked up a glass of champagne and asked Nox.

Nox nodded. “I heard the so-called Mr. Gates invited almost all the upper class of South Hampton City. However, the important thing is that it seems like everyone is here and no one rejected his invitation. Look! Even the Sanders are here.”

Jeanne’s gaze turned in that direction again.

She watched William and Chester talking and Stacey standing beside them like a small lily with a faint and elegant smile on her face.

“It seems the Sanders and William Gates have a good relationship.” Nox could not help but sigh. Her tone was a little pensive.

Edward did not agree, and neither did Jeanne.

In the banquet hall, more and more people came in.

More and more people started to gather.

By then, Jeanne also saw many familiar faces in the hall. For example, Quinn from the Sanders had also come along with her fiancé.

It was also Jeanne’s first time meeting Quinn’s fiancé, who was considered a very popular diplomat in Harken.

Other than Quinn, Eden also came. However, he did not bring Jasmine. In fact, he was with his father, socializing with people.

Joshua also came with Jenifer.

It was obvious that Joshua was very nervous as it was his first time attending a banquet alone, and Jenifer seemed to be giving him pointers throughout. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Halfway through the banquet, Monica arrived.

Her father must have called her over.

Ruby did not come, so Monica held Gary’s arm and forced a smile as she accompanied her father.

Before Monica arrived, Michael arrived at the scene with his mother, Reese.

He talked to everyone, and many people tried to curry favor with him. He was neither arrogant nor impatient. He was humble and polite while socializing. Most of the time, he was by the side of the Sanders, as if he was deliberately hiding his brilliance.

The banquet hall was really packed with people.

It had been a long time since South Hampton City had been so lively. It was likely that William had invited the entire upper-class circle, including those politicians who were not very influential.

When the banquet came to an end, Monica could not stand it anymore.

She was so drunk last night that her head was about to explode.

She had planned to rest at home today, but in the afternoon, she had received a crazy bombardment of phone calls from her father, who asked her to attend a business dinner with him tonight.
