1118 The Identity of the Duncans’ Descendent Exposed

Seeing Kingsley cry was rare. Hence, Edward suddenly stopped talking.

At that moment, Kingsley knew what Edward was talking about.

Edward nodded.

Some men had feelings that they were unwilling to express, and some had feelings that they did not want others to know about so they would understand it and pretend not to know.

That was probably a tacit understanding between men.

Edward took Nox and turned to leave. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He did not have much time to waste. With Lucy dead, the male assassin would not be able to hold on for much longer. Once his identity was discovered, he would immediately turn back to chase after Kingsley. If he returned now, he could still buy some time for Kingsley.

However, at that very moment, a lot of people suddenly appeared in the direction Kingsley was leaving.

At the same time, the sound of a helicopter came from the sky. It was obvious that it was the support troops from the Duncans.

It all happened so fast that it was somewhat unexpected.

Edward looked at Nox.

Nox said, “I swear that this has nothing to do with me!”

Last night, he had chosen to cooperate with the Duncans and plot against his own brother because he was really afraid that Edward would be killed by Jeanne. However, now that he had chosen to stand on his brother’s side and Edward was not in danger, he had no need to do so.

Edward knew very well that Nox would not do that.

It was just instinctual for him to look at Nox to calm himself down and think about what to do next.

The current situation was that if he let Kingsley go and the Duncans discovered he did that, he would never be able to gain the Duncans’ trust again. It was very likely that he would harm his entire family, including the Winters.

However, if he did not let Kingsley go…

Edward’s mind was spinning.

He made a prompt decision. “You’re holding Nox and me hostage.”

Kingsley’s eyes flickered.

Sometimes, he really admired the man in front of him to be able to think of the best way to solve the situation when everyone was panicking.

Edward did not give Kingsley any time to think. He turned around to let Kingsley restrain him and point the gun at his head.

At the same time, Kerby had also shackled Nox.

In the barren fields, Kingsley had Edward and Nox restrained while waiting for the arrival of the Duncans.

Now, the sky was already bright, and everything could be seen clearly.

The people who were rushing over from the distance surrounded them in an instant. All of them had their pistols raised and aimed at their enemy. If they were not careful, they would be shot to death.

Of course, no one dared to act rashly because Edward and Nox were being held hostage.

As such, they could only wait for orders.

It was a stalemate for a while until the helicopter in the distance slowly approached and landed on the open field.

However, no one came down from the helicopter.

Just then, the group of people who had gone after Lucy and the male assassin came back in a hurry. They had probably realized that they had been tricked.

Seeing the scene in front of him, Jack was shocked. He shouted to Edward, “Fourth Master!”

Edward was very calm as he said, “We have been tricked.”

“Yes,” Jack hurriedly nodded and said, “We saw Kingsley and Lucy escape, so we chased after them with all our might. We didn’t expect it to be a diversion. In fact, I did suspect that something was up because I couldn’t see Kingsley’s appearance clearly. All I saw was that he was wearing the same clothes as Kingsley. But because I saw Lucy, I was certain that the person was Kingsley. Besides, if it weren’t for Kingsley, Lucy wouldn’t have risked her life to protect him. She wouldn’t have risked her life to protect him until we shot her dead. That was why we were deceived, causing us to do useless work and even dragging you into this!”

He seemed to be trying his best to explain what he had just done because he was afraid of being punished by the Duncans.

Besides Alex, the person with the highest status in the Duncans was Fourth Master Swan.

Therefore, he needed to explain the entire situation to Fourth Master Swan in hopes of receiving the minimum punishment.

“Yes.” Edward replied, “I also saw the Kingsley and Lucy in disguise leave, so I chased after them. I forgot that Kingsley was still hiding in the surroundings. So, when Nox and I wanted to catch up with our men, we were ambushed by Kingsley’s men. The others were dealt with by Kingsley, while Nox and I were held hostage. We couldn’t send you a signal.”
