He returned to his car and sat in it but did not start the car and leave.

As he tried to suppress his emotions, he clenched his fists tightly.

It was not that he could not feel Monica’s feelings, but he knew very well that as long as Monica did not leave Michael — as long as Monica could not put her foot down with Michael — Michael could do whatever he wanted in their relationship. He could do it once or even a hundred times!

Therefore, Monica could abandon him a hundred times for Michael! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile. From the moment he was born, he seemed destined to be abandoned…

However, he had had enough of it!

Suddenly, his phone rang.

Finn looked at the call and answered, “Hello.”

“Finn, it’s Sarah.” The voice on the other end of the phone sounded anxious.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

Before he could speak, he heard Sarah say in distress, “Hurry up and save me. I’m trapped in a bar called Lunar Bar. Boo-hoo. They won’t let us go. I’m so scared. Boo-hoo...”

“You can call your parents,” Finn said coldly.

“If they know I go to places like nightclubs, they will beat me to death... Ah...” Sarah shouted, “I can’t hide in the bathroom anymore. Come and pick me up. Please, I beg you.”

With that, the call ended.

Finn pursed his lips tightly and looked up at the lights in the villa shining through a window.

However, he drove away in the end.

To him, abandonment was his bottom line. Monica had always said she loved him, but she never knew what he really wanted.

At the same time, a person walked out from a dark part of the villa. He looked in the direction Finn’s car left and quickly took out his phone to make a call. “Mr. Ross.”

“Yes,” the person on the other end of the call replied.

“Finn has left the Cardellini family’s villa.”

“Follow him to see if he’s going to Lunar Bar.”

“Yes.”

Michael hung up the phone and snickered.

He knew Finn would never sleep with Monica.

Even though he was suppressing his emotions today, he still allowed Monica to seduce Finn. He knew very well that if Monica was unwilling to leave him, it was impossible for her to be with Finn.

Moreover, the more he showed his support for Monica today, the more Monica trusted him. As such, there was no way Monica could bear to ignore him.

Of course, he had to take that opportunity while Finn and Monica had their biggest conflict to deal them his fatal move and end them completely!

…

Finn drove and soon arrived at Lunar Bar.

To him, he was only helping Sarah because Gary and Ruby had been kind to him.

With that, he parked the car and walked into the bar. After asking the staff, he pushed open the door to a private room.

Many people were in the private room. All of them were girls and boys about 18 or 19 years old.

They probably had just become adults and could not wait to come here to have some fun.

The moment he entered, there was a moment of silence.

Then, a young boy shouted in annoyance, “Uncle, are you in the wrong room?”

Finn ignored the boy and looked around.

That was when he saw a few girls surrounded by a few boys, who were forcing the girls to drink, and among them was Sarah.

The moment he saw her, he walked over.

Sarah also saw Finn, so she quickly pushed away the boy, who was pouring wine for her, and quickly ran behind Finn. Then, she grabbed his clothes as if she was frightened.

Finn glanced at Sarah.

To him, Sarah was just a child. Even though Sarah said she liked him, he did not take it to heart.

With that, he took Sarah and was about to leave.

“Stop!” The three boys in the private room hurriedly stopped Finn from leaving.

Sarah was so scared that she hid behind Finn.

Finn’s face darkened.

“Who are you? Why are you taking our people away?” a fierce-looking boy asked.

“It’s so late. I have to go back,” Sarah said loudly to them.

“We’re not done with drinking yet. Why are you leaving? Come over here and drink with us.” At the same time, a boy went over to pull Sarah over.

Frightened, Sarah quickly hid behind Finn.

Finn’s eyes narrowed before he grabbed the boy’s hand with force.
