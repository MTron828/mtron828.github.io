Chapter 1655: Nox’s Despicable Behavior

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Who was Benjamin? When did such a person appear in Harken?

Nox returned to the car and told the driver to send him back. His expression was so ugly that the driver did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Suddenly, Nox’s phone rang.

He took a look and answered the call. “What’s the matter?!” Frightened, the other party quickly reported, “Zoe is missing.”

“What?!” Nox’s expression turned even uglier.

“I told Zoe that the surgery would be performed yesterday, but when it was time for the surgery, she disappeared. I wanted to look for her myself, but I didn’t see her for the entire day. But don’t worry, I’ve blocked all the exits of South Hampton City, so Zoe can’t leave. I’m just reporting the current situation to you.” The other party was extremely respectful.

“There’s no need to report. Just tell me once the abortion is done.”

‘Yes.”

Just as Nox was about to hang up the phone, the person on the other end of the phone sounded troubled. “Mr. Winter.”

“Is there anything else?”

“Who is this Benjamin you mentioned?” The other party mustered up his courage and asked.

“Can’t you investigate if you don’t know who it is? F*ck!” Nox cursed.

“But you have to give me some context, right? I just checked. There are more than 20 thousand people called Benjamin in Harken—”

“Benjamin is a third-year student at South Hampton University!” With that, he hung up.

The other party was dumbfounded again. Since when did Mr. Winter refuse to even let a student off? What could he do to make a student lose his reputation and everything?

Shelly and Benjamin had been officially dating for a month.

However, Benjamin had his final exams, so he rarely came to Shelly’s place in the past few days. Although they did not see each other as much, the two of them spent a lot of time calling each other and texting. They would call at least three times a day and send countless messages.

Sometimes, Shelly would stare blankly at their messages. That was the first time she was in a relationship, so it was a little confusing.

Recently, Shelly encountered a lot less online abuse. After all, once a piece of news became less popular, not many people would be paying attention to it.

As such, Shelly had started bringing Bella to the neighborhood to play. She even took Bella to the supermarket to buy groceries. Shelly also thought that maybe she could send Bella back to school again next year.

She felt that her life had been great recently, mainly because Nox did not show up in front of her since then! Without Nox, she felt that everything was perfect.

When Shelly was at the supermarket with Bella, she received a call from Benjamin. “I’ll come and look for you after my last exam.” “Alright.” Shelly said, “Don’t fail.”

“Don’t worry, dear wife. I’ll definitely do well in the exam.” “Who’s your wife?” Shelly’s face was flushed red.

“Whoever talks to me.”

“Benjamin.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Okay, honey, I’m going to enter the exam hall. I’ll rush over to see you after

the exam.”

As Shelly hung up the phone shyly, Bella looked at her mother and was a little curious. “Mommy, is Uncle Ben coming over?”

“Yes,” Shelly patted Bella’s little head. “He’ll come over in a while.” “I knew it. Every time Uncle Ben comes over, you will be very happy.”

Shelly was speechless.

“I also like Uncle Ben very much.” Bella hurriedly said, “He’ll be my dad in the future, right?”

Shelly had no idea how to answer Bella, so she quickly changed the topic. “I’ll allow you to pick a snack you like today.”

“Really?” Bella’s eyes lit up like diamonds.

“Yes, go.” Shelly let go of Bella’s hand.

Bella hurriedly ran over to the candy section and happily began to choose her snacks. Shelly looked at Bella and smiled, feeling content with her life now.

After buying some daily necessities and snacks with Bella, Shelly went to pay the bill with Bella. While she was paying, she saw the condoms next to the counter.

In the past month that she had been with Benjamin, neither of them took the initiative to do anything more, even though they both had thought of it.

She gritted her teeth and secretly took a box, thinking that no one had noticed. From afar, a man picked up his phone and made a call. “Mr. Winter.”

“Yes.”

“Ms. Carter just bought a box of condoms..”
