Chapter 489: Jasmine’s Tragic Downfall

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Should I allow you to bully me?” Jeanne asked Henry aggressively.

She really did not think of letting the matter go so easily!

Since they never intended to make her look good, she naturally did not want to spare them from humiliation.

Having been forced into a difficult position by Jeanne, Henry looked fiercely at Jeanne and said, “Jasmine’s miscarriage had nothing to do with you!”

“Thank You for your trust, big brother.” Jeanne smiled sweetly.

Henry’s expression was ferocious.

Then, Jeanne immediately turned her head to look at Elaine.

Elaine had suffered enough today, having to suppress a whole lot of anger, and she was still doing so. However, because she was unreasonable, she could not say anything at that moment. She could feel Jeanne’s gaze on her, and her expression was ugly. “I said it just now. That matter had nothing to do with you.”

Jeanne did not dwell on it and turned to look at Richard.

She was going to them one by one to make all of them admit she was innocent.

Before Richard could speak, Grace hurriedly said, “I knew there was something fishy about this matter from the beginning. Jeanne, we trust you.”

“Thank you, Grace.” Jeanne smiled.

With a smile, she turned her head and looked at Alexander, whose expression was dark, and Jenifer, who was clearly panicking at that moment.

When Jenifer saw the video, she had a mental breakdown because neither did she expect that Jeanne would have that video.

At that time, Jeanne had just returned and had yet to display how capable she was, so Jenifer did not think Jeanne would use such a method. Still assuming that Jeanne was as stupid as seven years ago, Jenifer even looked down on Jeanne. More importantly, she was certain that if Jeanne had any evidence against them, she would have taken it out on the wedding day instead of waiting until now.

Back then, she still had a deep-rooted feeling that Jeanne liked Eden. If she could stop the wedding, she would not have allowed it to happen.

Obviously, they were wrong about Jeanne from the start.

Jeanne had no feelings for Eden anymore, so she did not care who Eden was with.

As for why Jeanne had a video that could destroy Jasmine or why she only brought it out now, no matter how smart Jenifer was, she could not think about all of it under such circumstances.

She even found that her mind was blank, and she did not know how to deal with it.

She did not expect that the daughter, whom she had put in all that effort to raise and had finally married into the Swans, the leading family out of the twelve families in Harken, now had nothing.

Not to mention, Jasmine had been utterly humiliated.

Jenifer could not vent the anger she was suppressing right now. She looked into Jeanne’s eyes and the latter’s smug smile, wishing she could really kill Jeanne.

At that moment, the image of Jeanne’s mother appeared in her mind. That year, Jeanne’s mother was also just as proud and looked down on her.

She gritted her teeth hard.

“Dad, Elaine kept saying you know me the best, so I must’ve deliberately caused Jasmine’s miscarriage.” Jeanne looked at Alexander coldly and refused to give him a way out.

Alexander was also furious.

When he saw Jasmine’s video, he really wanted to kill Jasmine for a second.

He had never thought Jasmine would embarrass him so much one day. Since young, she had always been gentle and amiable, so how could she do such an immoral thing? How was it possible?

However, it was precisely because he had never thought of it that when faced with such a scene, he could not accept it.

He looked at Jeanne fiercely before turning around and walking toward Jasmine, who was shocked by her father’s murderous expression.

Besides him, Jenifer was also so scared that her body was trembling.

“Bam!” Alexander slapped Jasmine’s face hard in front of everyone.

Half of Jasmine’s face instantly swelled up.

“Dad, no! No...”Jasmine did not seem to feel any pain, as if she was drowned in her sorrows.

Her tears blurred her vision, and she was miserable.

“I have never been so angry in my entire life! Jasmine, I always thought you were an obedient and sensible daughter who had never caused me any trouble or had a fight about something at home. However, never have I thought you would do such an immoral thing! You’ve insulted the Lawrences and me!” Alexander’s furious voice reverberated in the central room.
