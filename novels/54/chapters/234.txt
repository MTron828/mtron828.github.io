Chapter 235: Fourth Master Swan Was Teased by Jeanne

Edward glanced at Nox and left.

Nox asked the driver to send him back.

He leaned against the back seat leisurely.

‘Aren’t all women the same?!’ Nox could not understand.

‘It doesn’t matter who you sleep with.

‘Why is he torturing himself?

‘He should be like me. Tonight, I’ll find any girl available to play with me.’

Nox took out his phone and looked through his contact list.

He randomly clicked on one. “Are you free?”

“Eldest Young Master Winter, how can I not be free since you called?”

“Come to my house.”

“I’ll leave immediately.”

“Wash yourself clean first.”

“Yes, sir!” The person on the other end was extremely excited.

Nox hung up the phone casually, and a smile appeared on his face.

He felt that he was more carefree than Fourth Master Swan and Finn!

Those two were just too stubborn.

Nox arrived at his apartment.

He went back to his room and took a shower. He put on a bathrobe and waited in the living room.

As soon as he sat on the sofa, he saw Shelly appear at the door with her backpack on her back.

Nox’s expression changed.

He had not seen Shelly for the past few days. He had forgotten that the girl was still staying at his place.

When he thought about how he was almost scared out of his wits by Shelly the last time, his face turned even uglier.

He suddenly felt that everyone was annoying him today!

One was Kingsley, and the other was Shelly.

‘F*ck.’

Shelly looked at Nox and saw the look on his face. She knew he must have invited a chick back to accompany him to bed tonight.

Without even thinking, she turned around and left again.

The door was slammed shut.

Nox’s eyes were bulging.

Was Shelly throwing a tantrum at him?!

He was not even angry. Why was she so mad?!

Shelly walked out of the house, got into the elevator, and went to the neighborhood.

She guessed that it would take at most two hours.

As such, she would only go back after they were done.

Anyway, Nox would not let a woman stay at home for the night.

As Shelly thought so, the elevator opened. The moment she walked out, she saw a woman with heavy makeup rush into the elevator.

Shelly grabbed the woman.

The woman was stunned.

“Did Nox ask you to come?”

The woman was even more surprised. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’m Nox’s sister.” Shelly grabbed her and refused to let go.

She even dragged the woman out.

The woman was a little unhappy, but when she heard that Shelly was Nox’s sister, she did not dare to refuse.

“Answer a few questions, and I’ll let you go,” Shelly said straightforwardly.

The woman looked at the school uniform of South Hampton City High School on Shelly and was a little unhappy.

Shelly was only a high school student, yet she was so arrogant.

Given how Nox was so arrogant, his sister probably would not be any better.

The woman quickly smiled apologetically. “Go ahead.”

“Is it fun to have sex?”

“What?” The woman’s eyes were wide open.

‘Are all high school students nowadays so... unrestrained?!’

The woman was not that old. She was only in her twenties and had never gone to high school. However, were high school students not supposed to be obsessed with studying?! How would they have the time to think about such nonsense?!

“I’m asking you—is it fun to have sex?” Shelly asked again impatiently.

“Well... it is. Actually, it’s not for women, but it is for men.” The woman saw that Shelly was getting a little angry. She replied, “Men think with their penis, so of course, it’s fun for them!”

Shelly pursed her lips.

So, it was to satisfy a man’s desire.

“What kind of woman does Nox like?” Shelly asked again.

The woman was stunned and answered, “Nox doesn’t like anyone. He’ll be happy with anyone who can have sex with him. That said, I can tell you what kind of woman he likes to sleep with.”

“Hm?” Shelly frowned.

“Women with big boobs, a thin waist, and a big butt.” As the woman spoke, she even stuck out her chest.

Shelly could not help but look at herself.

It seemed that the difference between them was very big.

“Also, he likes women who are a little more flirtatious.”

“Flirtatious?”

“Like this.”The woman pulled down her clothes, revealing deep cleavage. Then, she smiled coquettishly and said, “Like this... Anyway, Nox likes women who are more straightforward. He doesn’t like innocent, cute, and delicate women. He likes women who can have sex with him right away, so one mustn’t be reserved in front of him.”

Shelly fell silent.

“Is there anything else you want to ask? I’m afraid that Nox will think that I’m pretending to be reserved if I’m late.” The woman seemed to be a little anxious.

Shelly let go of the woman.

The woman hurriedly pressed the elevator button and left.

Shelly walked toward a bench in the neighborhood and sat down.

It was early autumn in South Hampton City. It was not too cold or too hot.

At night, it was just a little cold.

Shelly was wearing a summer school uniform. She was a little cold from sitting there.

She remembered what the woman said just now about women with big boobs, a thin waist, and a big butt.”

Shelly thought about it carefully and realized that the women Nox had slept with seemed to have very good figures.

As for her, she had a big waist.

She had a slightly chubby figure. Her breasts were not big, her waist was not thin, and her butt... Her butt was still considered perky and fleshy.

No wonder Nox was so disdainful of her.

She was thinking…

Since she had to take the initiative, of course, she had to adapt to his preferences.

With this thought in mind, Shelly put down her school bag and went for a run in the neighborhood.

The first step was to lose weight.

At the very least, she cut down weight on targeted areas.

Shelly ran a few laps around the neighborhood before her phone rang.

She took a look at the incoming call and picked it up. “Sarah.”

“Shelly, are you asleep?”

“No. I’m running.”

“Why are you running so late at night?”

“To lose weight.”

“You finally know that you’ve gained weight.”

“...”

“Alright, alright, I won’t tease you anymore. The day after tomorrow is my uncle-in-law’s birthday. Will the Winters attend his birthday dinner?”

“I don’t know.” Shelly did not know about the arrangements of the Winters.

“I’m going. I’m going to dress up beautifully. The day after tomorrow is Saturday. Can you go shopping with me in the afternoon?”

“I still have to do some exam questions.”

“Your grades are already so good, yet you’re still working so hard. How can dregs like me survive?!” Sarah complained, “Can’t you just accompany me? I want to meet my prince charming the night after tomorrow. I can’t just go casually. I’m begging you.”

Shelly could not resist her best friend and agreed. “Okay.”

“It’s set then. We’ll go shopping together the day after tomorrow. I’ll go see how much pocket money I have first.”

“Okay.”

Shelly hung up the phone.

She also stopped running.

She was so tired.

It seemed that losing weight was not an easy thing.

Shelly looked at the time.

She walked a few laps in the neighborhood.

Two hours later, she went back.

The moment she went back, she saw the woman dressed and coming out.

When the woman saw Shelly, she took the initiative to greet her.

Shelly walked straight into the house.

The woman was not mad.

After all, the children of rich families were willful.

Shelly walked to her room.

When she passed by Nox’s room, she saw Nox suddenly open the door and come out.

Most importantly, he was naked.

Shelly’s eyes moved.

She looked down.

Nox was about to explode.

He hurriedly used his hand to cover his penis. “Shelly, didn’t you leave?”

“It’s not like I can’t come back.”

“You came back, you came back... F*ck!” Nox blurted out.

“There’s nothing to see. It doesn’t look as good as what I see in videos.” Shelly was indifferent.

“Shelly, is this what an 18-year-old high school girl like you should say?!” Nox was about to fly into a rage.

‘Wasn’t Shelly raised well by my parents?!

‘When did she become crooked?!

‘Do my parents know?!’

“Should an 18-year-old high school girl only take action instead of talking?!”

“...”
