Chapter 380: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

She was afraid that he would really die.

“F*ck!” The bearded man cursed, not expecting that Finn would be a fighter.

He had underestimated him.

Moreover, even if he was not dead, his body was already severely injured. Many of his joints were broken, but how did he manage to support himself to stand up? On top of that, how could he fight so well?

The bearded man watched as Finn beat up his two subordinates. By then, he was boiling with rage.

He moved his fingers and instantly rushed over, where he kicked Finn to the ground with all his strength.

As Finn did not expect it, he took the kick and was sent sliding across the floor after the fall.

Finn endured various injuries on his body.

Ever since he was young, he had never thought he was lucky because he could not feel pain. However, at that moment, he had to admit that he felt lucky for being special.

Only because of his special condition could he get up despite being severely injured.

He stood up slowly from the ground, which seemed to have stunned the bearded man.

The bearded man knew how much strength he had put in just now.

An ordinary person, albeit having trained before, would have found it difficult to withstand that kick.

......

As for the man in front of him, other than being covered in blood, he did not even frown. It was as if he did not feel pain at all.

At that, the bearded man’s expression turned grimmer. He said fiercely, “Kid, you’re really not afraid of death, huh?”

Step by step, Finn walked toward the bearded man in front of him.

The bearded man’s two subordinates were already riddled with injuries, gasping for breath as they stood at the side. However, when they saw Finn walking toward their boss, they were about to stop Finn.

“I’ll handle this myself!” The bearded man stopped them.

The two men took two steps back.

“I’d like to see how much you can handle!” The bearded man’s expression hardened, and he kicked his thick thighs out at Finn.

Finn reacted quickly by grabbing it.

The bearded man’s face darkened. He could even feel that Finn’s strength was shockingly strong.

An ordinary person would definitely not be able to withstand the power of his kick, let alone a person with such a serious injury.

That was when he saw Finn’s face contort badly.

Hence, the bearded man used all his strength and kicked out fiercely, sending Finn flying backward again.

That was right. He kicked Finn to the ground again.

Finn landed on the ground and slid far away. Where he slid, the floor was stained with blood. He looked ghastly.

The bearded man looked at Finn, who was covered in blood and whose face was pale. He said fiercely, “You’d better not think about resisting. My mission this time isn’t to kill you. So if you behave yourself and wait for me to finish with this woman, I might let you go. If you don’t know your place...”

The bearded man’s expression became extremely terrifying because, at that moment, he saw Finn stand up from the ground again.

Logically speaking, it was impossible for him to stand up. Even if he was an internationally-known first-rate killer, the man should have given up by now. Yet, an ordinary man like him stood up from the ground again.

The bearded man could even see that all the bones in his body were dislocated and that he could no longer stand straight. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

However, Finn still walked toward him. With each step he took, blood dripped to the floor.

“Even though I didn’t receive an order to kill, it doesn’t mean I won’t.” The bearded man’s intention to kill was very obvious.

If Finn got any closer…

The bearded man clenched his fists with a ferocious expression on his face.

However, as if Finn did not sense any danger, he continued to walk over until he was face to face with the bearded man.

The killing intent in the bearded man’s eyes was very obvious.

The moment he was about to punch Finn, a female figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

Monica hugged Finn tightly to shield him from the bearded man, who instantly retracted his fist.

He was afraid that if he killed the woman, he would not be able to complete the mission. The other party had clearly instructed that the woman must be kept alive!

He looked coldly at the two people in front of him and at the woman who was clearly scared silly. However, she was now protecting the man.

She hugged him tightly and said, “Finn, stop. I beg you to stop.”

Finn did not answer.
