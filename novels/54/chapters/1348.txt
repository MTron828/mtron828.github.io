1349 The Wedding: Last Night As A Bachelor

“Ahem.” Nox coughed.

Clearly, he was reminding Monica that Edward was here.

Monica’s back was facing Edward, so she could not see him. She did not think that Nox would be so kind either, so she did not know what Nox’s cough meant. She thought he had choked on his saliva.

She continued, “I was really envious of Jeanne back then. I even tried my best to matchmake Jeanne and Edward, thinking that Edward was miles better than Eden. Only now do I realize that none of them are good people. The only thing they prioritize is power and benefits. I really regret matchmaking Edward and Jeanne back then.”

Nox’s eyes were twitching. However, Monica did not notice it.

As Candice’s attention was also on Monica, she did not notice Edward, who was not far away.

She did not know why, but she was not surprised by Monica’s actions. Logically speaking, she was about to marry Edward, and it was inappropriate for Monica to suddenly speak ill of Edward.

However, she actually thought it was natural for Monica to say that. It was as if she knew Monica’s personality.

In fact, Monica gave outsiders the impression that she was steady and mature, with the air of an overbearing female CEO, which was completely different from the woman who had let herself go in front of her.

“Candice.” Ignoring Nox, Monica said to Candice seriously, “You’d better be prepared to marry Edward. Although I don’t really see you as a friend, I feel obligated to remind you what kind of person Edward is! Of course, I think my reminder will be useless. As long as he takes the initiative and wants it, no woman can reject a high-quality sc*mbag like him.”

Candice pursed her lips. She actually agreed with Monica on that point.

It was clear that she did not have any hope or feelings for Edward, but after getting along with him for a while, she started feeling… something.

That man really had some magic. She knew that she could not fall in love with him, but she just could not control herself.

“Take care of yourself.” Monica felt that she should stop there.

As for what would happen in the end, it was obvious that a newbie like Candice would be devoured by Edward, and everything she said today was useless.

In fact, she was just venting. She had been holding it in for too long and wanted to say it out loud.

It would be best if she told someone important to Edward. Regardless of whether Edward liked Candice or not, he was about to marry Candice. If she said anything wrong about Edward in front of Candice, it would affect their relationship.

She felt great. She could not wait for Candice to suddenly run away from the marriage. Then, Edward would embarrass himself in front of the entire nation. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Monica was still fantasizing about her own world when a male voice suddenly sounded from behind her. “Are you done?”

That was right. It was Edward’s voice.

Monica’s body tensed. At that moment, she was so startled that she jumped.

By then, Nox had regained his composure. He looked at Monica’s expression, which looked as if she had just eaten sh*t, and gloated.

He wanted to see how Monica would react when she was caught red-handed.

Monica was petrified as she watched Edward walk past her.

He did not look at her, as if he did not hear what she had just said behind his back. Instead, he walked straight to Candice.

Needless to say, the two of them looked like a match made in heaven when they stood together.

At that moment, Monica really wanted to burrow herself in a hole.

It would be fine if it was when she was still together with Finn because Edward might not do anything to her on account of Finn.

However, now that her only backer was gone, if Edward really did something to her…

The emotions on her face were visible.

“Now you’re scared?” Nox smiled evilly.

Was she not talking in such an imposing manner just now? Why be afraid now if she had the guts to say it?

Monica glared at Nox. She finally understood what Nox’s twisted expression meant.

Damn it. Did he not have a mouth? Could he not just say it out loud?

He could have had a sudden stroke and his face was cramping.

“It’s okay. Edward is not a petty person. For the sake of Finn, he won’t do anything to you even if you say such bad things about him, right, Edward?” Nox was obviously still fanning the flames.
