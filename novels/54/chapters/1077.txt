1078 Going To Court: All The Crimes Have Been Proven

“In that case, let me ask you this. You said you love me, right?” Michael looked at her.

“Yes, I love you very much. It’s because I love you very much that I followed all your instructions and helped you with doing the illegal things.”

“Since you love me so much, why did you leave behind evidence to frame me?!” Michael retorted, “If I really did ask you to do it, then as that recording said just now, I helped you to leave Harken. You trusted me and loved me so much, so why would you leave evidence behind to accuse me?! Could it be that you knew I was going to harm you in advance? If you had known in advance, would you have done things according to my arrangements? Don’t you think your lies are a little too much? Brie, in order to reduce your sentence, I can’t believe you’re so despicable as to slander me. Do you have no conscience?”

“Am I the one with no conscience or you are? I love you so much that I’m willing to do anything for you. I watched you fall in love and marry another woman, yet I still stayed by your side without any regrets to assist you. I’ve done so much for you. I thought you shared some of the same feelings for me, but now I know that all you wanted was to use me. Even after I became worthless, you were so ruthless as to want to kill me!” Brie was also pushed to the limit by Michael.

All the bad things that Michael had done to her before were all her own doings.

However, at that moment, she really saw how cold-blooded and cruel Michael was. What she saw was a hundred times worse than she had imagined, and it was enough to crush her!

Why was she so stupid to love such a man to the point of losing herself back then?! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She could not hold back her tears anymore.

It was not sadness but hatred. She wished she could kill Michael and die with him.

At that moment, Monica, who was in the plaintiff’s seat, saw the scene of Michael and Brie arguing.

It was true. Michael, the man whom she had treated with all her heart and she was even willing to give up everything to help him, had tested her limits again and again.

For his own benefit, he could really use everyone. He was brutal and ruthless.

She even felt sorry for Brie.

After all, she did not love Michael. In fact, she had never really loved him.

The only time she was a little moved was when Finn abandoned her and she was forced to fall for another man.

If she, who did not love Michael, could still be hurt by him to that extent, she could not imagine how much pain Brie, who truly loved Michael, was in.

However, Michael remained unmoved!

The scene became a little tense because of Michael’s defense.

It was true. Just a recording alone could not fully prove that the matter was related to Michael.

Michael was really not a simple person. To think he could still deny his crimes at that moment!

Suddenly, Monica asked Brie, “Just now, Michael questioned your recording. He said that since you love him so much, why would you keep the recording? In fact, it doesn’t make sense. Why would you be wary of him when you love and trust him so much?”

“It’s because of Jeanne.” Brie tried her best to calm herself down.

At that moment, she looked at Monica.

They were enemies because of a man, but it was also because of a man that they stood on the same side.

Monica was stunned.

It was Jeanne again, silently helping her with everything.

“When you exposed the quality inspection department, Jeanne came to me and told me all of Michael’s schemes. She said that Michael would let me take the blame and that Michael would be kind enough to send me away. I didn’t believe it at first, but in order to leave a way out for myself, I left evidence of my relationship with Michael when Michael really did everything that Jeanne told me. I love him very much, but I’m not stupid. I won’t send myself into a death trap when a man wants to kill me!”

“How did Jeanne know all of my plans?” Michael asked again as soon as Brie finished.

Brie did not know either.

She had no idea how Jeanne knew about it.

“Jeanne and I have nothing to do with each other. How could she know my plan? Brie, don’t you know how to lie?” Michael sneered, “And as far as I know, Jeanne has not been in Harken or South Hampton City for a long time, and now you’re telling me that it was Jeanne who told you everything! Why don’t you say that Monica told you? Then, perhaps everyone will be more convinced.”
