966 Jeanne and Monica Reunited and Joined Hands to Destroy the Sc*mbag

“That’s why you should focus all your energy on your dad now, and the same for you, uncle.” Jeanne shifted her gaze to Gary and said, “You’re in charge of recuperating. Monica and I will help you settle the Cardellini Pharmaceutical, understand? ”

Gary stretched out his hand, which Jeanne quickly held.

He had lost so much weight that Jeanne could not help but tighten her grip.

“Jeannie, I will take good care of myself. I’ll leave Cardellini Pharmaceutical to you and Monica,” Gary said solemnly.

To him, he still could not let go of the Cardellinis’ family business.

Although he had been trying to convince himself not to take it too seriously, he would still look forward to it once there was some hope.

“Alright,” Jeanne agreed.

Gary smiled and was visibly much more at ease.

After all, Jeanne had proved her capability before. With Jeanne’s help, it would be much easier for the Cardellini Enterprise to rise from the dead.

Jeanne said a few more words to comfort the two elders before leaving the hospital.

As she was leaving the ward, she brushed past someone.

“Jeanne?” That person called out to her.

Jeanne paused for a moment, but she did not stop or turn back. Instead, she walked away.

Finn stared at Jeanne’s back and knew that he should be right. Then, without any hesitation, he made a call. “Fourth Master.”

“Finn.”

“I think I just saw your wife.”

“…”

“In the hospital. She just left.”

“Alright.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

After that, Finn hung up the phone.

If he did not guess wrong, Jeanne was back to help Monica. As for whether she would visit her husband and son, he could not make a guess.

…

Jeanne hailed a cab and headed straight to the Cardellini Enterprise.

She had just bumped into Finn.

Of course, she did not intend to hide from anyone that she was back, and neither could she hide it from anyone.

Moreover, she only had a week’s time. If it took too long, Kingsley would explode.

One week was just right.

However, one week might not give her enough time to do many other things. The purpose of her return this time was to help Monica get through Cardellini Enterprise’s crisis and also to clean up the mess that she left behind at Lawrence Enterprise.

The car arrived at the Cardellini Enterprise, and Jeanne went straight to the chairman’s office.

Everyone looked at Jeanne as if she was familiar, but they could not recall who she was. When they saw her walking past with such an imposing aura, no one dared to stop her. She simply pushed open the door to the chairman’s office.

The moment she pushed open the door, Monica was still yawning. She was having a headache from the messy data in front of her, but she was forcing herself to continue reading it.

When she felt the door being pushed open, she raised her head and was completely dumbfounded.

She thought she had seen wrong, so she even rubbed his eyes.

Was she seeing a ghost?

However, it was really Jeanne, the woman who left without a second thought! How did that woman still have the cheek to come back?

Monica’s eyes suddenly turned red. “Didn’t you leave?!”

Jeanne walked into the room and sat down in front of Monica.

She said, “I was planning to leave, but a certain woman made me worried.”

“Y-You… How can I lose my temper at you if you say that?” Tears welled up in Monica’s eyes.

She was ready to argue with Jeanne for leaving her wedding just like that. In fact, she was still brooding over it.

However, she did not ask Jeanne for help on the Cardellini Enterprise incident not because she held a grudge. She just felt that Jeanne must have a lot of things to do after she left and that she could not keep disturbing her. Moreover, Jeanne was not in South Hampton City. If she asked for help, Jeanne would only worry if she could not return.

Thinking that she had not reached the point of complete despair, she chose to endure it herself.

However, when she saw that Jeanne had returned, she still felt a little betrayed that Jeanne left her.

“I’ll only be back for a week,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Monica looked straight at Jeanne, speechless. “I really wish I could beat you to death!”

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “Alright, wipe your tears. I’ll help you to take a look at the Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation.”

Monica suppressed the displeasure in her heart.

She also knew that Jeanne was pressed for time, so she did not waste any more time.

She handed the pile of documents on her desk to Jeanne. “This is Cardellini Enterprise’s current internal situation. The finance department is in a state of emergency because all our drugs have been returned and we have almost no cash flow in our account. The raw materials for the new product have been purchased, and if we don’t produce the products now, we will suffer a huge loss. But if we do, the production costs will be quite pricey. More importantly, no hospital or pharmaceutical company is willing to buy our products now. Jeannie, I think my family is going bankrupt.”

It was a little uncomfortable to say it out loud.

A few days ago, she could still comfort her father and tell him that if they had no money, so be it. However, now that they were going to go bankrupt, she could not help but feel sad at the thought that the days of squandering were coming to an end.

“Let’s not worry about the hidden problems within the company for now. How’s the situation at the quality inspection department?” Jeanne went straight to the point.

“We’ve already forced them to issue a report within a week. It’s been five days now, and I’ve been sending people to inquire about it every day. However, we haven’t gotten any results so far. I’m guessing that they’ll announce it directly and won’t reveal any information to the public.” Monica said indignantly, “Jeannie, do you know? All of this is Michael’s doing! It was all his fault. If not for him, the Cardellini Enterprise would not end up in this predicament! How could I have been so blind back then?”

“It’s not your fault.” Jeanne said, “Michael is very skilled. It’s normal that you can’t deal with him.”

“But all of you reminded me that Michael is not a good person, and I was the only one who still believed him.” Monica still felt terrible when she thought about it.

“It proves that you’re kinder than us.”

“...Are you complimenting me?” Monica was skeptical.

“Sort of, but…” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Monica looked at her and found her best friend really overbearing!

Then, she heard Jeanne say, “From this moment on, you must exterminate Michael!”
