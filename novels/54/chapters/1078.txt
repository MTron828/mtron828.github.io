1079 Going To Court: All The Crimes Have Been Proven

Brie looked at Michael coldly.

It took up a great deal of forbearance to not drive herself crazy.

“Jeanne has been back.” A deep male voice suddenly sounded in the courtroom.

Everyone looked at Edward, the Fourth Master Swan, who was sitting in the audience with a low profile.

Even though everyone in South Hampton City was a little afraid of Fourth Master Swan, his status and authority, at least among the people, was so deeply rooted that it surpassed the Sanders.

To the public, the Sanders was too far out of their reach, whereas the Swans were everywhere in the eyes of the public.

The houses they lived in, the shopping malls they shopped in, and so on were all under the Swans.

Edward stood up from the audience and said, “I can testify in court.”

A staff of the court hurriedly invited Edward to the court.

Edward appeared at the witness stand and said to the judge, “I have evidence to prove that Jeanne was in South Hampton City on the night of November 28th.”

“Please show me your evidence.” The judge’s tone was much friendlier.

Edward said, “On the night of November 28th– No, to be precise, early in the morning of November 29th, Jeanne and I had dinner at Venus Hotel. I believe that the staff of Venus Hotel can testify to that. Jeanne even stayed at Venus Hotel for many nights. The hotel should still have a record of her stay.”

“Your Honor, please arrange for a legal officer to go to Venus Hotel for verification,” Judah quickly said.

The judge and the jury exchanged opinions and agreed.

The legal officer, who was recording everything that happened in the courtroom, went straight to Hotel Venus and obtained the room records and surveillance video of Venus Hotel that day. They confirmed that Jeanne had returned to South Hampton City during the period of Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s incident.

With the confirmation done, Judah said to the judge, “Your Honor, this is enough to prove the credibility of Brie’s testimony.”

The judge nodded.

He seemed to agree with Judah’s conclusion.

“Just because Jeanne came back once is enough to prove Brie’s story? Aren’t you taking the law too lightly?” Michael began to refute again, “Why can’t I suspect that Brie happened to see Jeanne in South Hampton City and used Jeanne to achieve her goal?! Since Brie said that it’s related to Jeanne, can we get Jeanne to testify in court?”

He knew that Jeanne was being controlled by the Sanders, so Jeanne would not appear in court. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Can you contact Jeanne to come to court?” the judge asked Edward.

“She’s not in Harken for the time being,” Edward said bluntly.

“We can contact her by phone!” Michael forced him.

“There’s no way to contact her.” Edward’s expression turned cold.

The judge could also see from Fourth Master Swan’s expression that the latter was not happy, so he quickly said, “Thank you for the witness’s testimony. The witness can now withdraw from the court for the time being.”

Edward glanced at Michael coldly and left the court.

Michael still shuddered at the look in Edward’s eyes.

However, he gritted his teeth and instantly regained his confidence. He said, “Your Honor, Brie’s testimony against me is only her side of the story. It can’t be used as valid evidence to accuse me. I don’t accept her accusation!”

“Your Honor–” Judah said.

However, before he could finish his sentence, Monica interrupted, “I’d like to confront Michael.”

The judge glanced at Monica and said, “Permission granted.”

Monica looked at Michael, face to face, and Michael also looked at Monica coldly.

The two of them just looked at each other. All that was left between them was hatred.

Monica said, “Tell me, why did Brie come here to frame you?”

“Because she wants to reduce her sentence! Once she’s not the mastermind, she won’t have to suffer such a heavy legal punishment.”

“Have you forgotten that there’s no valid evidence to prove that Brie is the mastermind behind this incident? It’s all Daniel Cook’s side of the story!” Monica enunciated each word.

At that moment, everyone seemed to recall that there was an extremely important segment at the scene and an extremely crucial person, Daniel Cook.

When Daniel felt everyone’s gaze on him, he panicked and became nervous again.

Without Brie and Michael, he could have just admitted to his crimes. Yet now, they were both there, and he had never prepared himself to deal with it.

He tried his best to stay calm.

“That’s Daniel and Brie’s problem. I’m just trying to prove my innocence.”

“No, it’s your business.” Monica enunciated each word clearly. At this moment, she looked at Daniel and said, “In your testimony, you said that had an unspeakable relationship with Brie, and Brie used this relationship to threaten you to frame me. Now that Brie has proven that she has nothing to do with you, may I ask why you’re trying to frame her?”
