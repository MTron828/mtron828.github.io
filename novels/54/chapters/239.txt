Chapter 240: The “Married Couple” Sweetly Feeds Each Other

In broad daylight, Edward teased Jeanne in front of everyone.

After touching her lips, he moved his fingers down again and touched her slender neck. Then, he moved them down again and brushed them past her collarbone…

“Fourth Master!” Jeanne took a few steps back.

Edward’s hand was no longer touching anything.

The moment the feeling disappeared, he felt a little upset.

At this moment, in the banquet hall, some people were looking over.

Nonetheless, due to Fourth Master Swan’s identity, many people did not dare to look at them brazenly.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you remember now?” Fourth Master Swan asked Jeanne shamelessly.

“Fourth Master, is there a point to bother a drunk person?” Jeanne was a little angry.

“So, you don’t want to take responsibility.”

“I just touched you for a while. What’s there to take responsibility for?!” Jeanne did not care anymore.

In any case, Fourth Master Swan was shameless. She could do the same!

Edward just looked at her.

He looked at how aggressive Jeanne was.

Edward smiled again.

His smile was very obvious.

It was rumored that Fourth Master Swan did not like to smile.

‘He’s f*cking good-looking when he smiles!’

At least half of the people in the hall were stunned by Fourth Master Swan’s smile.

“I didn’t have dinner. I’m going to have some pastries,” Jeanne said domineeringly and left immediately.

She looked as if she could not be bothered with Edward.

Edward watched her leave with a deep gaze.

His feelings for Jeanne were not hidden at all.

It was rumored that Fourth Master Swan had fallen in love with Jeanne.

It seemed that the rumors were true.

At this moment, in the banquet hall.

Eden had left the elders and brought Jasmine to the side to socialize.

At that moment, of course, he had also noticed the interaction between his fourth uncle and Jeanne. His expression was ugly.

“Is your fourth uncle really together with my sister?!” Jasmine asked unhappily.

Eden did not answer.

“How did your fourth uncle fall for Jeanne—”

“Stop talking!” Eden interrupted Jasmine’s words.

Jasmine looked at Eden.

Eden seemed to be getting more and more impatient with her during this period.

“I just feel indignant for your fourth uncle. After all, Jeanne has a child...” Jasmine felt a little wronged.

Eden said coldly, “Jeanne is now rich and capable. Her figure and looks are top-notch. Isn’t it natural for my fourth uncle to be seduced by her?!”

Jasmine looked at Eden in disbelief.

She did not believe that Eden would think so highly of Jeanne now.

‘Didn’t he always look down on Jeanne?!’

“You’d better know your limits. Don’t compare yourself to her,” Eden said then let go of Jasmine before he left.

Jasmine was suddenly abandoned in the banquet hall.

She stood rooted to the ground, unable to accept it. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

‘No.’

Her eyes were bloodshot.

She could not tolerate how Eden was treating her!

She could not tolerate it!

…

Eden walked out of the back garden.

He could not stand it anymore.

He could not stand watching his fourth uncle and Jeanne being entangled with each other.

‘Jeanne…

‘She deserves to die!’

Not only did she make him lose his face, but she also hindered his development.

Eden took out his phone and made a call.

“Ms. Sanders.”

“How’s it going on your side?”

“Everything has been arranged. We’re just waiting for Jeanne to go home tonight.”

“Alright. This time, we can’t let Jeanne get away again no matter what!”

“Okay.”

Eden fiercely hung up the phone.

‘Jeanne, don’t blame me for being ruthless. You can only blame yourself for being too sharp!’

…

In the banquet hall, Jeanne was in the pastry section, choosing what she wanted.

She was feeling very irritable.

‘Can Fourth Master Swan just stay away from me?’

Jeanne turned around.

She turned around and saw that Fourth Master Swan was just a step away from her. He did not speak and just followed behind her.

Edward saw how angry Jeanne was.

Instead of being mad as well, he was in a good mood. He said, “Ms. Lawrence, I haven’t had dinner either.”

Jeanne looked at the pastries in her hands.

She gritted her teeth. “Do you want some?”

“You can eat first.” Edward was still gentlemanly.

At this moment, Jeanne wanted to scratch Fourth Master Swan’s face.

She picked up a small fork and did not want to waste any more time with Fourth Master Swan. She continued to eat by herself.

However, the more she ate, the more she felt that something was not right.

Fourth Master Swan’s gaze was fixed on her lips. He just kept looking at her.

“Is there chocolate on my lips?” Jeanne asked.

“No, you’re eating very elegantly,” Fourth Master Swan replied, “I’m even hungrier now that I’m watching you eat.”

‘This coquettish man….!’

Jeanne forked a small piece of chocolate cake and moved it toward Fourth Master Swan’s mouth. “Do you want this?”
