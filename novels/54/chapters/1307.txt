1308 A Family’s Warmth

She thought that she might be very foreign to the act of carrying a child.

Unexpectedly, it was as if he had carried her before. She felt very at ease with it.

Just like that, she carried Paige in one arm and ate breakfast with the other.

Edward was at the side, feeding Paige breakfast.

The dining table was inexplicably harmonious.

“Daddy, can you feed Mommy?” Paige’s soft voice asked suddenly again.

Edward frowned slightly, her voice clearly reproachful. “You don’t want to eat anymore after eating so little?”

Even if he was scolding her, she could tell that he doted on her.

“No,” Paige explained. “Didn’t Daddy say we’d all have to take good care of Mommy when she got back? Teddy said Daddy fed me, so that means Daddy took care of me. So Daddy feeds Mommy, so he takes care of Mommy.”

Candice and Edward were obviously stunned.

She did not expect a three-year-old child to be so logical.

“Isn’t it like that, Daddy?” Paige asked Edward, blinking her big eyes.

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

It was one of those things that said he would accept all of Paige’s requests unconditionally.

“Then Daddy must blow for Mommy. Don’t burn her,” Paige reminded him.

Candice thought that no woman would be able to reject such a cute and considerate girl.

She could help but hug Paige tighter.

She wanted to get close to her.

“Candice, open your mouth.” Edward’s voice suddenly sounded in her ear.

A deep and magnetic voice.

Candice looked up and saw Edward putting a spoonful of nutritious porridge to her lips.

She had no idea whether she should thank Paige for letting the dignified Chief feed her.

She opened her mouth and ate it.

There was no way she could refuse with Paige looking expectantly at her.

It was the kind of pure anticipation that only children had.

After eating it, she could clearly see Paige’s happy smile. Then, she obediently opened her mouth wide. “Daddy, ah…”

She looked like she wanted to be fed too.

Edward fed Candice one spoonful and Paige another.

No matter how anyone looked at it, this scene was very heartwarming.

It really felt like home.

“Daddy, I’m full.” Paige hugged her small belly and patted it. “It’s really bulging.”

“Really? Let Daddy touch it.” Edward put down the bowl and spoon.

He placed his large hand on Paige’s small belly.

Paige was ticklish. When Edward touched her belly, she could not stop laughing. Her small body was still in Candice’s arms and she could not stop squirming. Candice laughed too.

“Daddy, ticklish!” Paige’s childish voice was adorable.

The place was quiet but now it was roaring with laughter.

Even Teddy, who was doing housework, could not help but look up at them.

Ever since Jeanne left, this was probably the most brilliant smile he had ever worn in all these years.

Initially, he did not really accept that Fourth Master was getting married so frequently, but… if he could really make Fourth Master fall in love with someone again, it might not be a bad thing.

“Paige just ate. Don’t keep tickling her. It’s not good for your stomach.” Candice could not stand it anymore and reminded Edward.

Edward was stunned. Slowly, he let go of Paige.

It was also a long time before Paige stopped smiling.

However, it was obvious that she enjoyed playing with her father like this.

“Alright, Daddy will bring you to watch television over there. Don’t disturb Mommy’s breakfast.” Edward suddenly picked Paige up from the dining table and walked to the sofa in the living room to watch television.

Candice looked at their backs.

So was Edward like this at home?!

There was no loftiness, no sense of distance. He was just a man filled with fatherly love.

She quickly finished the rest of her breakfast.

After eating, she walked toward the sofa.

Paige was squatting on the ground playing with building blocks. When she saw her coming, she called out to her enthusiastically, “Mommy.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Candice smiled. She patted Paige’s head naturally and sat on the sofa rather awkwardly.

Edward was watching a variety show. Since Paige was not watching, he tuned in to his favorite program.

She might indeed have been prejudiced against Edward.

She had always thought that people like him would only watch serious news broadcasts or current political and social news. She could not imagine that he would watch such lively things.

...

“I’m actually an ordinary person.” Edward seemed to have noticed her doubts about him and explained.
