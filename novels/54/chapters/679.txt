Monica sat in the living room for a while, feeling restless.

Then, she took out the white pill from her pocket.

Wendy said she could consume it directly or mix it in cold water. Most people chose the second method because it could be done without anyone knowing.

Did she want to… do that to Finn?

She was conflicted.

She knew very well that if she did not drug Finn, there was an 80 to 90 percent chance that she would not succeed tonight. However, if she drugged Finn, she would win with an unfair advantage. Moreover, Finn would probably hate her to death.

After struggling for a long time, Monica decided to give Jeanne a call.

At that moment, she could only ask Jeanne for her opinion.

“No, you can’t!” Jeanne said firmly.

It put Monica in a bad mood because she felt wronged. “Why not? This way, Finn will know there’s nothing between Michael and me!”

“Whether there’s nothing between you and Michael cannot be proven with your innocence or by having sex with Finn. Do you think Finn doesn’t know there’s nothing between you and Michael? He’s probably most disappointed that you don’t trust him and that you will always choose to abandon him. Let me tell you, Monica, even if you sleep with Finn a hundred times, Finn will not get back together with you because of this. He will only resent you!”

Monica’s eyes were a little red.

“Trust me, and don’t do this. Everything you’re doing tonight is just to test Michael. All you need to do now is tell Michael your plan. As for Finn, you’d better stay far away from him,” Jeanne said with such certainty that made Monica a little uncomfortable.

“Monica, you can’t rush things. At this moment, you really can’t force Dr. Jones. There’s enough conflict between you and him, and if you continue to plot against him, it will only make the distance between the two of you grow further. Trust me.” This time, Jeanne’s tone was a little gentler.

Monica bit her lips and nodded. “Okay.”

“Now, let’s focus on testing Michael and put Dr. Jones’s matter aside for now. “Jeanne reminded her again.

“Okay.”

At that, Monica listened to Jeanne’s suggestion and threw the pill away.

Actually, Jeannie was right. Using such a method to sleep with Finn would make him resent her.

However, she felt frustrated because she knew it would be difficult for her to seduce Finn tonight.

While she was standing in the hall, Ruby called out to Monica from the second floor. “Monica, your father just called Finn. He will be here soon.”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

The next second, she instinctively went upstairs and returned to her room.

As expected, in less than 20 minutes, Finn rushed to the villa and went straight to Gary’s room.

He checked Gary’s heart rate several times.

However, Gary’s heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and so on... Everything was normal.

A little weirded out, Finn asked, “Uncle, is there a pain in your heart?”

“Not really, but my chest feels a little tight, and it’s making me a little breathless.”

“Everything looks normal. What did you eat for dinner today?” Finn asked.

“I ate some fattier piece of meat.” Gary seemed to have thought of an excuse. “I haven’t eaten your aunt’s pork stew for a long time, so I ate a few more pieces.”

“It may be the diet that led to the chest tightness. I think there are some digestive pills at home, so take a few of them and see if you feel better.”

“Okay.” Gary nodded. “It’s probably because the cut is too fat.”

“Uncle, you have to be careful next time. Considering your age, you should try to eat as light as possible, especially at night.”

“I was a little greedy tonight, but I’ll be careful next time,” Gary promised.

“I’ll go get some digestive pills for you.” Finn got up and went downstairs to find some digestive pills. While he was at it, he poured Gary a cup of warm water.

After Gary ate the pills, Finn stayed with him for a while. After making sure that Gary did not have an adverse reaction to them, he left.

Finn was just at the top of the stairs when someone called him from behind, “Finn.”

Finn paused for a while but did not stop.

Monica seemed to know that Finn would ignore her, so she ran over and stood in front of Finn.

Finn frowned.

In fact, she had been secretly observing their movements since Finn came to her father’s room half an hour ago. She also kept sending messages to her mother, and when she learned that Finn was about to leave, she ran out.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
