995 Glib-Tongued, Monica’s Imposing Presence

At that time, the boy who had died was declared dead ten minutes after the vaccination, and he did not even have the chance to be resuscitated before his life ended. However, 30 minutes had passed, and George was still standing on the podium with a ruddy face. There was only a small bump on his wrist where he had been vaccinated, and it was not red at all.

“According to your experience, what’s the maximum time for a problem to occur with the vaccination?” Monica observed George and asked the nurse.

“Generally, ten minutes is the observation period. If nothing goes wrong within ten minutes, there won’t be any major reaction to the vaccine. Of course, we can’t rule out some immune reactions in the body, such as fever, fever, swelling at the injection site, and more, but it’s not a big problem. These are all normal vaccine symptoms, and they will automatically disappear after three to five days,” the nurse replied.

“It means that since George has been vaccinated for 30 minutes and is not having any issues, we can conclude that there are no adverse effects from the vaccine?”

“You can basically say that.” The nurse nodded.

“Thank you. I’m sorry to have troubled you.”

“You’re welcome.”

The nurse took her tools and left the podium.

Monica also told George to leave the podium. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Then, she said to the reporters and all the cameras below, “The result was already very obvious, and I wouldn’t have needed to use my godson as an experiment. But Jeanne, my best friend, said that in order to convince everyone, injecting her son in person would be the best way, so she personally handed her son to me. I think if it weren’t for her absolute trust in me and Cardellini Pharmaceutical, no one would joke about their son’s life! I’m really, really grateful to Jeanne!”

As she said that, her eyes turned red.

The reporters at the scene were also a little dumbfounded by Monica’s sudden emotional outburst.

Monica took a deep breath and suppressed her uncontrollable emotions!

She continued, “I believe everyone knows whether there’s a problem with the vaccine or not, so I don’t need to say anything more. I hope everyone understands that Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and testing of drugs are definitely above national standards. As long as it has our logo printed on it, it means that it is absolutely safe and effective!”

Monica’s sonorous words made all the reporters present applaud.

It was a sense of guilt for previously misunderstanding Cardellini Enterprise and also a recognition of Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs.

Not just at the scene, but all sorts of support and overwhelming apologies filled the screen.

“I believe there’s nothing wrong with Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs. Our family has always used their drugs, and there have never been any problems!” One of the reporters affirmed.

“In that case, why would the report from the quality inspection department come up with the conclusion that the bacteria were not completely eradicated from the vaccine?” The reporters immediately brought up the contradiction.

Daniel faced everyone and the countless cameras while trying to control the panic in his heart.

He forced himself to remain calm. “The quality inspection department will verify the problem with the Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine again. If there’s really a mistake–”

“Director Cook.” Monica interrupted him, “Do you think you can cover up a mistake?”

“The quality inspection department needed a month to do tests on the vaccine, but because of the doubts from the public, we had no choice but to change it to a week. It’s understandable that there will be test errors when you try to complete the tests in a week.” Daniel was trying to find an excuse for himself.

“It’s understandable?” Monica’s face turned cold. “So, Director Cook, do you think it’s justifiable for the quality inspection department to issue an inaccurate report?”

“I mean, if time is tight, there might be mistakes!” Daniel argued.

“Can I understand that in order to please the public, the quality inspection department could be so irresponsible as to simply issue a report? In your opinion, you just need to give the public an explanation. Regardless of whether there is a problem or not with the vaccine, you just want to suppress the public’s opinion first!”

“Monica, stop talking nonsense!” Daniel was enraged by Monica.

“Is that not what you meant?” Monica was not afraid as she coldly looked at Daniel.

“There’s nothing more I can say. The quality inspection department will issue a follow-up quality inspection report for this matter, and today’s press conference will end here!”

“It won’t end here!” Monica said firmly.

“Monica!” Daniel gritted his teeth.

“Just now, Director Cook said there’s a possibility of errors in the testing because of the short amount of time they had. If I remember correctly, the quality inspection department usually produces the report within a week. So, if you say that, doesn’t that mean that the previous results issued by the quality inspection department could be inaccurate? Those food merchants and pharmaceutical companies who were found to have problems by the quality inspection department, as well as those who went bankrupt or went to jail because of this, might have been misunderstood. If that’s the case, this mistake is really serious!”

“Monica–”

“Oh, that’s right.” Monica did not give Daniel a chance to speak. “I seem to understand what Director Cook meant just now. This is the first time you’ve issued a quality inspection report since you took over. Before this, it was all handled by the other directors of the quality inspection department. So, Director Cook, are you trying to say that all the previous directors have been neglecting their duties?”

“I didn’t mean that! You’re slandering me and insulting my integrity. I can sue you in court for saying that!” Daniel was so angry that his words were a little rushed, and his body could not stop trembling.

“Since that’s not what you meant, Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine testing error was not an accident. It was a deliberate setup. You deliberately set up that result with the purpose of making Cardellini Pharmaceutical face bankruptcy!”

“No! I definitely didn’t!” Daniel was a little agitated and denied it immediately!

“In that case, how do you explain your mistake? Don’t say there wasn’t enough time. The moment you admit that there wasn’t enough time, it would mean that there was a problem with all your previous quality inspection reports! If you’re willing to bear this responsibility, tell everyone it’s because you couldn’t make a correct judgment within a week that caused the test this time to be faulty!” Monica was overbearing.

Daniel’s face turned red, and he did not dare to say anything.

If he said that, it would not only affect the incident, but it would also destroy the authority that the quality inspection department had over the years!

He did not have that much power to represent the quality inspection department, the Sanders, or even the entire Harken!

At that moment, the dignified director of Harken’s quality inspection department was rendered speechless by the 25-year-old girl. His face was pale, and he was dumbfounded!
