1054 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

“Monica!” Sarah looked at Monica in shock, completely stunned by the scene in front of her!

What was her cousin doing?

There was such a sharp dagger on Monica’s wrist, but she did not seem to feel any pain, and her face was expressionless.

What surprised Sarah more was her cousin’s entire body… What was going on?

Her hair was in a mess, her face was covered in blood, and she was only wearing a men’s suit jacket. Sarah did not even know if she was wearing anything underneath. At least, her legs that were exposed were bare.

Sarah looked at the scene. No matter how innocent she was, she could not help but think of the worst.

She hurriedly over. “Monica.”

Sarah took the dagger from Monica’s hand.

At that moment, the skin on Monica’s wrist was cut, and blood was oozing out. It looked very frightening.

If she had not been there tonight, would her cousin have done something stupid?

At that thought, Sarah became really frightened.

However, Monica remained unmoved. She just silently took a piece of tissue and wiped the blood on her wrist.

Monica asked, “What are you doing here?”

Her tone was unusually calm as if nothing had happened to her.

Sarah did not know what was real — what she was seeing now or the state her cousin was in.

She quickly replied, “I’ve been here for the past few days. My dad is with your mother now. He doesn’t want me to sleep in the hospital, so I can only sleep here. If I hadn’t heard the commotion and gone downstairs, would you have–”

“No.” Monica immediately denied Sarah’s idea.

However, the scene just now…

“Forget what you just saw and don’t tell anyone,” Monica instructed coldly and did not waste her breath on saying anything else.

What she meant was that all Sarah had to do was listen and that there was no need for her to explain all her unusual actions.

She said, “I’m going back to my room to take a shower. You should rest early too.”

Then, she stood up from the sofa and went straight upstairs.

Sarah really could not understand her cousin, who suddenly seemed to have become someone she could not recognize.

What had happened to make her cousin change so much?

Just as Sarah was feeling puzzled, the phone rang in the living room. It was the phone that her cousin had left on the sofa.

Sarah looked down and saw that it was a call from her aunt. Hence, she quickly answered the call for Monica, who had already gone upstairs. “Aunt.”

“Sarah, is Monica with you?” Upon hearing Sarah’s voice, the person on the other end asked anxiously.

“Yes, she just came back...” Sarah was a little hesitant but did not tell her aunt about the state Monica was in today.

Her aunt was already sad enough, and she did not want to upset her further

“Hurry up and get Monica to the hospital. Your uncle… Your uncle dying!” The other party sobbed while speaking.

Sarah was shocked, but she quickly replied, “Okay.”

Sarah put down her phone and rushed up to her cousin’s room on the second floor as fast as she could. She knocked on her bathroom door and said, “Monica, come out quickly! Your mother just called to say that your dad might not make it. Come out quickly!”

The person inside was currently taking a hot shower, in which the water that poured down was mixed with a thick blood-red color.

Her cold expression changed a little at Sarah’s words. However, it was just a slight change, not a drastic one.

“Monica. Monica!” Sarah was so anxious that she banged on the door.

It was as if she was about to barge in if Monica did not open the door in the next second.

“Alright, I got it,” Monica responded.

Sarah was shocked.

Did her cousin hear what she said? Why was she still so calm?

Her cousin was clearly afraid that something would happen to her uncle, but how could she be so calm now?

“Aren’t you going to the hospital?” Sarah asked.

“I’ll go in a while.”

“But from your mother’s tone–”

“It’s fine,” Monica said.

Everyone was bound to die. If her father really could not make it, there would be no point in her going either.

Outside, Sarah was worried to death.

How could her cousin be so calm? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Her cousin was clearly more uneasy than her when something happened, so why did Monica suddenly become like that?

Even Sarah found it terrifying!

Sarah was anxious in Monica’s room, and her aunt had called several times in a row.
