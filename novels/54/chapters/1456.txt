Chapter 1457: Zoe’s Trick

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Do you think I’m such a petty person? What’s wrong with having a meal with friends and then having some fun with them?”

“Yeah.” Zoe replied, “Come over then. I’m in room 999. I can introduce my friends to you. We’ve all been busy, so you haven’t gotten to know many of them. They will be at our wedding as well.”

“Alright.” Nox hung up.

He was actually looking down on himself. He used to be the king of having fun, but now he was so embarrassed by the fact that he wanted to join someone else’s fun.

Nox soon arrived at room 999. In the private room, the lighting was alright and not particularly dark. Moreover, it was not particularly noisy. It was just some young people drinking peacefully.

When Nox entered, everyone looked at him. Shelly immediately saw him too, and at that moment, she could not help but grin.

To think Nox had walked into the den where he was cuckolded! There were six men inside, and all of them had an affair with Zoe. It made Shelly rather curious as to how Nox would get along with them.

Shelly stood at the side as if she did not exist and looked at Nox while everyone was surrounding and welcoming Nox warmly. “Hello, Young Master Winter.” “Young Master Winter, your reputation precedes you.”

“Young Master Winter…”

Nox was used to being complimented by others, so he reacted to them naturally. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Shelly looked at Nox and realized that the guy was not here to catch them in the act.

No wonder the men and women in there were behaving differently. Just a 1110111e11L ago, Luey were dll Killus UI… CLdZY dilu Illuece11L L11H1gs. She thought that people in the city people knew how to have fun, but on the contrary, it was because Nox was coming. In fact, everyone was helping Zoe put on an act.

Zoe held Nox’s arm intimately and introduced him to a man. “Nox, this is Cody.

His family has some business with mine, and his father is very close to mine.

The last time I was drunk, he was the one who sent me back.”

“Hello, Young Master Winter.” Cody took the initiative to greet him and raised his wine glass to toast him.

“Hello.” Nox also drank with him.

“Because of work, I often meet Zoe, and she often talks about you.” Cody started the conversation.

They were chatting as friends, and Nox did not put on airs.

In front of Zoe’s friends, he made sure to show them the respect they deserved. He would not refuse anyone who came to toast him and would occasionally take the initiative to drink with them.

Shelly thought Nox deserved to be cuckolded for trusting Zoe so much.

“Waiter, two more beers please,” Cody instructed Shelly.

Shelly quickly responded by speaking into the microphone and asking the staff at the nightclub to send over two bottles of beer.

After that, she squatted on the ground and opened them one by one, placing them on the coffee table in front of her. Then, she placed the empty beer bottles they had drunk earlier into the beer boxes. She did it very seriously and naturally.

When Nox lowered his head to grab a beer, he glanced at it and saw the waitress, Shelly, kneeling on the ground. For some reason, he was a little angry, just like every time he saw Shelly.

“What’s wrong?” Zoe, who sat beside him, immediately notice his emotions.

That was probably why Zoe had not failed for so long. It was because she had always been meticulous and cautious, so she could feel the slightest change in

Nox.

“It’s nothing.” Even then, Nox’s tone seemed to have changed.

Zoe could not help but glance at the waitress kneeling on the ground and thought she was quite good-looking.

Could it be that Nox had a type? However, she did not care. To her, no woman was a threat to her as she was confident that Nox was hers.

As the night deepened, the men and women in the private room drank more and more. It was neverending.

Zoe, who was a little drunk, walked into the bathroom in the private room. Just as she entered, a figure nimbly followed her in and closed the toilet door behind him.

“Are you crazy?” Zoe lowered her voice and asked Cody.

“Isn’t it exciting?”

“Are you crazy? No matter how exciting it is, I will not do anything in front of

Nox. Get out.”

“Why are you so agitated? Did I say I was going to f*ck you?” Cody smiled evilly..
