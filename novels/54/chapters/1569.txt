Chapter 1570: Finn’s Surprise Proposal Was A Success

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica watched as Finn and Wendy chatted and laughed as they returned. She did not know how she should react, so she brushed it off with a smile.

In that awkward moment, Monica turned around and left, pretending that she did not see them. Anyway, she had come out for a walk because she could not sleep and not because she was waiting for someone.

At that moment, she even saw Finn wearing the scarf that Wendy had given him. The difference in temperature between morning and night was indeed so great that Finn, who did not have enough layers on, wore the scarf just to keep warm.

“Director Cardellini, please don’t misunderstand.” Wendy looked at Monica’s expression and hurriedly stepped forward to say.

Monica said, “I’m just out for a walk. I didn’t misunderstand anything.”

“Mr. Jones and I were also out…”

“You don’t need to explain it to me.” Monica smiled, “I’m not bossy enough to care about what you do in your private time.”

“But-”

Before Wendy could finish her sentence, Monica had left, and Wendy did not dare to stop her. She just watched as Monica left as if there was nothing unusual about the matter or she did not care about the matter. However, a woman’s sixth told that Monica must be angry.

She turned to look at Finn and said, “What should we do? It seems like Director Cardellini has misunderstood the situation.”

Finn stared at Monica’s back and chose to remain silent.

“I think you should explain it to her clearly. There shouldn’t be any estrangement or misunderstanding between couples,” Wendy said bluntly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn’s eyes flickered. ‘What did you say?”

“I said there shouldn’t be any estrangement or misunderstanding between couples-”

“How did you know?” Finn asked.

“I…” Wendy was somewhat embarrassed.

She did not mean to say it out loud, nor did she mean to expose them.

She quickly explained, “I was just guessing because you rejected me last night and I saw how you interacted with Director Cardellini. You also said that your girlfriend was pregnant.”

After saying that, Wendy added, “And you’re really good to Director Cardellini. It’s easy to guess.”

Finn pursed his lips. He did treat Monica well, but it seemed that everyone except Monica could tell.

“Well, I suggest you explain it to Director Cardellini now. You don’t want her to misunderstand anything,” Wendy urged.

Finn nodded. “Yes, I know.”

As the saying said, one had to learn from one’s mistake, and he definitely would not repeat the same mistake now. However, before that, he had something to do.

“I’ll head back to my room first.”

“Good luck, Mr. Jones.” Wendy said sincerely, “I also wish you and Director

Cardellini a long and happy marriage.”

Finn chuckled and said, “Thank you. I’ll need that.”

Wendy smiled, and the two of them returned to their respective rooms.

After returning to his room, Finn packed all the baby’s clothes into his luggage and made a phone call to talk about many things. By the time everything was settled, it was past 11 p.m.

He took a shower before leaving his room because he was afraid that he would disturb Monica’s rest if he showered in her room.

Then, he walked to Monica’s room and knocked on her door. Seeing that there was no response, Finn knocked on the door again. However, he had a feeling that Monica would not open the door for him, and it made him feel helpless.

Since he could not force Monica either, he stood at the door and waited for about half an hour, until the door opened.

All Monica wanted was to confirm if Finn had left. She figured that he should have left, but for some reason, she could not fall asleep, so she wanted to take a look.

In fact, she usually slept well, but she had been suffering from insomnia for the past two nights. The moment she closed her eyes, she saw Finn… like a ghost who would not leave her side.

As soon as she opened the door, Finn called out to her, “Monica.”

Monica jumped in shock. She opened the door assuming that Finn would not be there. Therefore, when she suddenly heard a voice, she was almost scared to death.

Upon noticing how frightened she looked, Finn seemed to smile and said, “Did I scare you?”

“Haven’t you left yet?” Monica was a little angry because he really scared her.

“I don’t plan to leave,” Finn said bluntly.

“I won’t be able to sleep well if I sleep with you.” Monica found an excuse.

“Well, I’ll sleep at the door,” Finn said seriously.

Monica frowned. ‘Is Finn threatening me now?’

“Go and rest early,” Finn even urged her in a friendly manner. ‘We still have to prepare to go back tomorrow. You’ll be very tired..”
