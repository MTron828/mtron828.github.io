Chapter 207: Non-stop Reversals and Climaxes

“Besides, what could his motive be?!” Josiah coldly said to Judah.

Judah looked straight at Josiah and did not answer.

“Lawyer Smith, since you’ve been denying my logic, what’s your logic then? If Mr. Zimmer is the instigator of this case and the person who sought personal benefits through the dual contract, is he crazy? He’s already being paid well at his job. Besides, from what you and the witness said just now, it can be clearly seen that Mr. Zimmer doesn’t have any grudge against Ms. Lawrence. What benefits would he have by framing her?!”

Judah was a little dumbfounded by Josiah’s questions.

At least to the others, he looked as if he was speechless.

Although Judah’s capability was obvious today, Josiah’s fame was much greater in South Hampton City. Judah was still a newbie lawyer to them.

“Lawyer Smith, please answer my questions.” Josiah did not give Judah a way out. He was even a little aggressive.

Judah raised his head and looked at Josiah…

Josiah looked provocative.

Judah said, “Judge, may I ask Tenda a few more questions?!”

“Permission granted.”

Judah walked toward Tenda.

Tenda was still very nervous. He looked at Judah nervously.

“Mr. Wadler, I would like to ask if you made this project profit list.” Judah asked while showing a list in his hand.

Tenda replied, “I did.”

“Has my client seen it?”

“No,” Tenda said, “I kept this for myself at that time. I was afraid that Ms. Lawrence would look for me to check the accounts, so I secretly made a financial statement.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It means that other than you, no one else knows about the existence of this statement.”

“Yes.”

“Then why did you give it to Mr. Zimmer? Logically speaking, this kind of evidence is extremely disadvantageous to you, so why did you give it to Mr. Zimmer to testify against yourself?!”

“I...” Tenda was somewhat dumbfounded by the question.

Tenda was just an ordinary person, to begin with, and his cultural level was not high.

When there were too many people, he would not be able to speak very clearly and think fast.

“I forced him to give it to me!” Adrian hurriedly said, “I’ve been dealing with Tenda for many years, and I know that he has a habit of doing his own accounts, so I forced him to bring out the accounts. I admit that I lied to Tenda at that time. I told him that as long as he had a good attitude and admitted his mistake in court, the court could give him a lighter sentence. He saw that there was no turning back, so he could only listen to me.”

“That’s it,” Tenda quickly said, “That’s it.”

Judah’s eyes moved slightly.

He said, “Alright. Even so, Mr. Wadler, why did you use a loss-making profit to share with my client?!”

Tenda looked straight at Judah, not understanding what he was saying.

Judah enunciated each word carefully, “My client and I have carefully studied this financial statement. It looks like a flawless statement, but it’s also full of loopholes.”

Everyone looked at Judah.

Judah said, “In the statement, it clearly states the purchase prices of two brands. Among them, there’s no problem with the prices of the original high-end brand, Sunshine Company. All of them are clearly marked according to the shipping prices of Sunshine Company. Now, there’s a huge problem with the prices of Sunrise Company, the brand that was actually used. For example, the price of reinforced concrete drainage pipe is 150 dollars for Sunrise Company but shown as 130 dollars on your accounts, Mr. Wadler. There’s a profit margin of more than 800,000 dollars here. In other words, Mr. Wadler gave my client more than 800,000 dollars for free. Of course, this isn’t the only one. I’ve circled all the questionable parts.”

As he spoke, Judah asked the staff to hand over the marked account book to the trial bench and the judges.

At the same time, he gave a copy to Josiah...

Josiah quickly looked through it and asked, “Where did you find out that there’s a problem with the shipping prices?”

“From the shipping company, Sunrise Company, of course.”

“Do you have evidence?”

“Coincidentally, I do.” Judah enunciated each word.

Josiah’s face was dark.

Judah turned to face the judge. “Your Honor, please allow my witness to appear in court.”

“Permission granted.”

A man walked into the court.

Judah asked, “May I know your name and what you do?”

“My Name Is Deric Wright, and I’m the shipping manager of Sunrise Company.”
