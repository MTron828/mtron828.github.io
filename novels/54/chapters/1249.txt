1250 Nox’s Accusation Against Jeanne

Nox suddenly took a deep breath, as if he could not continue.

He said, “Jeanne, even if Edward didn’t save you back then, even if you died in the war between the Sanders and the Duncans, you have no right to hate Edward. The responsibilities he has to bear and everything he has done for you is already beyond the limits of his ability!”

Jeanne did not respond and chose to remain silent as she listened to Nox’s complaints about Edward.

“Push me back!” Nox suddenly ordered.

He did not want to talk any more nonsense! If Jeanne wanted to take his advice, she could. If not, forget it!

Jeanne was also used to Nox’s sudden outbursts, so she pushed Nox back to the living room.

In the living room. Finn just happened to come down from upstairs. Seeing that they had returned, he stepped forward and said to Jeanne, “Fourth Master is asleep.”

“Finally asleep?” Nox asked.

“He took two sleeping pills.” Finn explained, “With his current condition, he needs to be forced to rest.”

That sentence was directed at Jeanne.

Jeanne felt that it was Edward’s body and Finn was a doctor, so Finn did not need to explain anything to her. However, it was because of Finn’s instructions that Jeanne felt that she was still Edward’s… wife.

She had the right to know about his matters.

“Alright, I’ll try my best not to disturb him,” Jeanne replied.

Finn did not say anything else. In fact, Finn was very smart. With many things, he would be able to stop where he should.

Then, he turned to look at Nox. “Fourth Master is resting. Let’s go.”

Nox nodded. The moment Finn pushed him away, he could not help but turn back and say to Jeanne, “You must take my advice!”

Jeanne smiled.

She could take his advice, but she only had two months left.

Finn pushed Nox out of the living room and helped him into the car. After that, he placed the wheelchair in the trunk, returned to the driver’s seat, and drove away.

“Are you too tired to drive?” Nox could not help but wonder.

“I did get some sleep.” Finn said as he drove, “From the beginning to the end, Fourth Master was the only one who didn’t sleep. When I had time, I took George to catch up on some sleep.”

“I don’t want to die in your car.”

Finn ignored Nox.

“By the way, how’s your relationship with Monica?” Nox, who was sitting in the passenger seat, asked.

He also suddenly felt like he was a mother whose heart ached for her children.

He had just shown his concern for Edward, so he had no choice but to show some concern for Finn. However, the two of them were clearly older than him, yet why was he so worried about their relationship?

“It’s pretty good.” The corners of Finn’s mouth lifted into a smile.

Ever since they had slept together, Monica had moved in with him. Although they were often apart from each other because of their busy work schedule, he still felt the warmth of a home. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It meant that when he returned home, it would no longer be cold and empty. Even if Monica was not around when he returned home sometimes, he would still feel a trace of warmth when he saw her things.

“Why do I think it’s not good?” Nox hit the nail on the head.

Finn drove seriously, not taking Nox’s words to heart.

“I saw Monica at the funeral today, but why do I feel like Monica has changed a lot?” Nox recalled how Monica looked today.

She was wearing a black dress and looked very serious. She was completely different from the noisy woman he remembered.

Of course, Monica’s transformation was definitely not on the outside.

Although she would take the initiative to greet him and even deliberately attack him with a few words if she saw him, the feeling that Monica gave him was different, especially when she was facing Finn. When facing Finn, she maintained a very distant attitude. Even when Finn turned around and went to do his work, Monica would not give him a second look. There were just no sparks in Monica’s eyes when she looked at Finn.

Even in those three years of marriage when Finn and Monica often asked for a divorce, Monica’s line of sight would be on Finn in the crowd even though Monica was scolding him. However, she would not do that now.

Now, after Finn turned around, she would also turn around.

He did not think that Monica was treating Finn like that because she had become mature and knew how to restrain her feelings.

Of course, Finn was a person who would hide all of his feelings so that outsiders would only see his cold and aloof appearance. In reality, deep down, he was very passionate. Therefore, even if Finn did not usually take the initiative to tell Monica his feelings for her, Nox was sure that Finn loved Monica very much.
