Chapter 808: Monica Committed Suicide (Not Dead)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

No. How could she be threatened by Michael?

She refused to believe that Michael had reached the point where he could hide the truth from the world.

What did he say? Businessmen could never win against politicians.

However, Jeanne could do anything.

Without even thinking, she called Jeanne, but the latter had turned off her phone.

Jeanne would never turn off her phone.

Even so, she did not let herself think too much about it. She got out of bed, washed up briefly, and rushed out without putting on makeup.

She first went to Bamboo Garden in the Swan family’s manor, but Teddy was the only one at home.

Teddy said that Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne had not returned for two days. Neither of them had answered his calls, and he had no idea where they had gone!

Monica was a little dumbfounded.

Why did Jeanne disappear after Jenifer and Eden were beaten down?

She did not give up and went to Lawrence Enterprise. After confirming that Jeanne was not in the company, Monica was stunned.

Why would Jeanne disappear for no reason?

She forced herself to calm down and called Nox.

Nox was rude to her. “What’s the matter?”

“Did you know that Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan are missing?”

“What does that have to do with you?” Nox’s tone was cold.

“I’m looking for Jeanne. It’s something big,” Monica purposely said it in a serious tone, and her voice sounded anxious. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Something big? Are you telling Jeanne that you’re getting married soon? There’s no need to inform her. It’s all over the news now. I saw it.” Nox was a little sarcastic. After he finished speaking, he was still a little unhappy. “By the way, Monica, are you that impatient? Can’t you wait a few more days before you announce your marriage? It wasn’t easy for Jenifer and Eden’s news to be on the hot topic, and they could’ve been bashed by all the netizens for a few more days. Yet now, it’s obvious that you made your news trending on purpose because it has immediately covered up their news! I’m even starting to suspect whether you are Jeanne’s best friend! You must be fake friends, right?”

Monica was embarrassed by Nox’s words.

No matter what she did now, she would always be a b*tch.

However, she tried her best to calm herself down, to keep herself from breaking down, and to not make herself seem pathetic. She said, “Nox, I’m begging you. Can you tell me where Jeanne is? I really do have something to tell her.”

She was pleading with him.

Nox frowned.

Monica had always been rash and had never shown weakness to him before. In fact, she had never been so submissive to him before.

“I don’t know,” Nox replied coldly.

It was because he really did not know.

“I really am looking for Jeanne, and it’s not about the marriage.” Monica put aside her emotions and said to Nox sincerely.

“That has nothing to do with me!” Nox rejected her without mercy.

Monica’s eyes were very red.

Tears welled up in her eyes, but she tried her best not to cry.

“From the moment you divorced Finn, you and I are no longer friends. So, whatever happens to you is yours to deal with. Don’t bother me. I won’t help you or feel sympathy for you,” Nox said coldly.

The indifference in his voice hurt Monica a little.

In fact, Monica had always regarded Nox as a friend. Even though the two of them were always bickering, she still felt that Nox was her friend.

Her throat moved slightly as she said, “Nox, I want to break up with Michael.”

it really took her a lot of effort to say those words because she did not want anyone to know how much of an idiot she was back then.

She had planned to keep the matter to herself, and even after she broke up with Michael, she would not tell anyone that she had been deceived.

She thought she could keep her dignity, but she suppressed her emotions and told Nox the truth. “I want to break up with Michael, but he’s forcing me to get married. I want Jeanne to help me.”

Nox seemed stunned for a few seconds, wondering if he had heard wrong.

He said,” Aren’t you glued to Michael? Why are you breaking up? Are you crazy?”

Monica bit her lip tightly, frantically trying to control her emotions.

“Monica, do you have nothing better to do all day? Why do you keep looking for drama?” Nox said unhappily, “I’m really busy.”

“I’m telling the truth. I really want to break up with Michael. He has been lying to me all along, but now that I’m proposing a breakup, I’m met with tons of obstacles. I’ve announced it on Facebook, but Michael has restricted my Facebook account. So, I created an alternate account, but every time I post something about me and Michael, it would be deleted. I called the media and had them report on my breakup with Michael, but the media rejected me. They didn’t even believe that I had a conflict with Michael. Now, Michael has unilaterally announced our engagement, and the whole country thinks that I’m getting married to Michael. However, I don’t want to marry him. I want to let everyone know that I won’t marry Michael, but I can’t win against Michael. In front of him, I have no power to resist him,” Monica said.
