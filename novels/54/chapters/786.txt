Chapter 787: Monica and Michael’s Conflict Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

“Good for you.” Nox was clearly mocking her.

Monica knew what he was referring to, but she did not reply. She had realized that nothing good ever came out of Nox’s mouth.

Hence, she decided to leave.

“I forgot that Finn almost died for you–”

“Nox,” Finn called out to him.

Nox rolled his eyes.

“Let’s go.” Finn’s tone was a little cold.

Nox glanced at Monica. “I really feel sorry for Finn.”

After he finished speaking, he left with Finn.

Monica stared at their backs, bit her lip, and forced back the tears in her eyes.

Everyone felt that she had let Finn down. However, no one knew how deeply hurt she was or how much pain she was in after she left Finn.

She walked out of the hospital and went to the entrance to hail a cab, only to see Finn driving away from her, like every other time.

She waited for a while and got into the taxi.

After telling the driver the address, she picked up the phone and dialed a number. “Michael.”

“Monica, it’s rare for you to take the initiative to call me.” His tone was still gentle.

“You haven’t come back to me about what you promised me the day before yesterday,” Monica said bluntly.

Monica got so happy watching Jenifer’s news the entire day yesterday that she temporarily put aside her relationship with Michael.

After all, she was in a really good mood yesterday because Jenifer’s true colors were finally exposed.

At the thought about how Jenifer had tortured Jeannie for so many years, and now that the truth was finally made public, she felt extremely satisfied.

What was even more satisfying was that Eden, that hypocrite and sinister man, had also been exposed. She would like to see how he could continue to pretend to be a good person from now on! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yesterday was one of the best days she had ever had.

After reading the comments condemning Jenifer and Eden yesterday, the resentment that she had accumulated for years was finally released. It was simply satisfying, and she was a hundred times more excited than the person involved, Jeanne.

She did not understand how Jeanne could be so calm. If it were her, she would have invited her friends out to celebrate by now.

However, Jeanne was not happy about it at all.

When she called Jeanne yesterday, the latter only said a few words calmly, and today, she did not even answer her phone!

F*ck. Did Jeanne think she was too noisy?

Monica reckoned that Jeanne probably still had a lot of things to do.

After all, with Jenifer and Joshua’s downfall, everything in the Lawrences would fall on Jeanne’s shoulders, and Jeanne probably had a lot of follow-ups to deal with. Hence, she chose not to disturb Jeanne. Furthermore, she was also in a mess right now, so she decided to celebrate with Jeanne after she resolved her own problems.

With that thought in mind, she thought she would call Michael and lay all her cards on the table after she went to the hospital and got the nails in her ankle removed.

She had thought it through. This time, no matter what Michael said to her, she would definitely break up with him.

To her, she had done her best to help Michael.

Michael’s future development was his to deal with, and she would no longer feel like she owed him anything.

She held the phone, but Michael did not answer for a long time.

“Michael?” Monica called out to him with a frown.

“Monica, let’s talk tonight.”

Before Monica could open her mouth, Michael promised, “I have something to deal with now, so let’s talk after work tonight. Don’t worry. I’ll respect your decision in the end.”

Monica wanted to say something, but in the end, she agreed, “Alright.”

She, too, knew Michael was very busy.

Moreover, some things might come across as clearer if they talked in person.

“I’ll call you tonight.”

“Sure.”

Monica thought that after tonight, she was going to start over.

Even if she could not be with Finn anymore, she would at least show him that she was really just helping Michael, and now that she was done helping him, she managed to retreat unscathed.

However, as soon as Michael put down his phone, his face darkened.

Was Monica so impatient to leave him? They had agreed on three months, and it had only been more than a month!

His expression was cold.

Things did not seem to be going well for him recently.?Every time he planned something, it would end in failure.

He gritted his teeth and looked at the ringing phone.
