Thank you readers!

In the tea room, Candice and Finn sat together.

The more Finn spoke, the less confident he became. He said, “I might not be good enough for Monica.”

“It’s not that you’re not good enough for her. It’s just that you’re expressing it incorrectly.” Candice said, “When you guys broke up, you were so determined on rejecting Monica. Later on, Monica almost died because she saved your life, so you chose to get back together with her. After you got together but didn’t show your love for her, it made her think that you only got back together because you felt sorry for her. If I were Monica, I would think so too.”

Finn nodded.

In fact, when Monica was really determined to break up with him, he already knew that was the reason. That was why he wanted to make up for it, but no matter what he did, Monica did not seem to believe him. “What did Monica do to woo you back then?” Candice asked.

Finn was stunned. “She kept pestering me.”

“You can try that.” Candice said, “Use the same trick Monica used to woo you.” Finn looked at Candice.

“The way she treated you when she was pursuing you was her best effort. If you treat her in the same way, she might acknowledge your efforts.”

“Thank you.” Finn thanked her sincerely.

Candice smiled faintly. “I’m just a bystander giving you some advice. As for whether you can get back together with Monica in the end, it’s up to you.” “I know.” Finn nodded. “By the way, why were you looking for me?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing that Candice took advantage of the time when Nox was pestering Edward to drink and called Finn to the side, he figured she probably had some private matters to discuss with him.

“I heard your medical skills are very good.” Candice did not beat around the bush.

“What’s wrong?” Finn asked.

“You should know very well that I had a very serious accident a few years ago. After that, I was in a coma for many years. And although my body recovered very quickly after I woke up, I still can’t remember many things.” Candice pointed at her head. “Is there a way to treat it?”

Finn was silent for a few seconds.

He said, “There’s no cure for amnesia. Sometimes, it’ll come back to you in just a split second, but sometimes… you won’t be able to remember it for the rest of your life.”

“Is that so?” Candice lowered her eyes, clearly disappointed.

“Actually, I personally think that the reason people lose their memories is not because of physical reasons, but because of psychological reasons. Many miracles in the medical field are achieved by human will. To put it bluntly, your amnesia may be a form of self-protection. Perhaps you weren’t happy in the past, so your subconscious made you forget everything.”

“Why would I be unhappy? I did so well in the first half of my life.” Candice did not understand.

“Geniuses also commit suicide.” Finn said bluntly, “Everyone has a different definition of happiness.”

Candice bit her lip lightly.

Finn tried to persuade her, “Just accept the present. The past isn’t really important. ”

“I didn’t think the past was important as well. When I opened my eyes to this strange world full of strangers, I lived like a numb person. I had no expectations for the past or even the future. But for some reason, after marrying Edward, my thoughts have changed a lot. I have this weird feeling that there are many memories that I don’t know about, and it makes me want to know what I’ve experienced in the past.” Candice said bluntly.

“Knowing it doesn’t mean your life will be better.”

“Do you know something?” Candice asked sensitively.

“I don’t. I’m just giving you an analysis from a professional perspective.” Finn denied it.

Candice scrutinized Finn, who appeared very calm, and there was nothing unusual about him.

He stood up from the sofa. “It’s getting late. I’ll head back first.”

Candice looked at him.

“To look for Monica,” Finn added.

Candice smiled. “Alright.”

After Finn left Bamboo Garden, Candice walked out of the tea room. At the dining table, Nox kept pestering Edward and drinking while his fiancée, Zoe, sat beside him obediently.

“Where were you?” Nox asked unhappily when he saw Candice walking over from afar..
