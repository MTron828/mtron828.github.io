958 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

“No, it’s not cruel,” Lucy’s words were firm and decisive.

Jeanne frowned.

She felt that Lucy’s tone was suspicious.

“Do you have a plan?” Lucy immediately changed the topic.

Jeanne said, “Every year on Kingsley’s birthday, he would accept toasts from the assassins and staff. He has to deal with so many people, so it shouldn’t be too difficult for me to slip away from under his nose.”

“Not necessarily,” Lucy reminded her.

It was because she had been by Kingsley’s side for too long and knew him too well.

Kingsley’s way of doing things was actually more thorough than the average person’s.

It had not been easy for him to bring Jeanne back to the Delta Islands, so he would not let her leave so easily.

Since Kingsley could not keep an eye on Jeanne every minute and every second, there would be another person, or perhaps many people, watching her every move.

“I suggest that you bribe K01, Mason,” Lucy said.

Jeanne raised her brows. “You mean, you want him to be my accomplice?”

“Kingsley trusts K01 very much. He’s the number one assassin on the assassin list, and all the assassins of the Hills are afraid of him. If you let him send you away, it would be the best choice.”

“I’m afraid Mason isn’t that kind.” Jeanne smiled.

If Kingsley found out about it, Kingsley would shoot Mason dead.

She did not want to drag others down.

“If Mason doesn’t accompany you back to South Hampton City, I won’t feel at ease letting you leave just like that,” Lucy continued to say.

“Are you worried that Edward will kill me?”

“For us, South Hampton City is no longer a safe place.” Lucy did not answer Jeanne’s question directly because it was difficult to answer.

She did not know if Edward would do anything to Jeanne.

However, other than Jeanne, there might be others…

Jeanne’s identity was too special as she had a presence in all the forces.

Lucy was actually very worried about what Jeanne would choose in the end!

“I think K01 will help you.” Lucy stood by her idea.

She could not allow Jeanne to go back alone.

“But I don’t want to implicate Mason,” Jeanne said.

Perhaps she could convince him.

“Kingsley won’t do anything to K01. K01 can support half of the Hills, so he can’t bear to kill him.” Lucy made it clear.

Jeanne fell silent.

“You have two choices. One, stay in the Hills and help Monica remotely, or two, take K01 and leave. Think about it. ” Lucy had given her two choices.

She did not say it explicitly, Jeanne knew very well that if she did not bring Mason with her, Lucy would not let her leave the Delta Islands.

The room was a little quiet.

Jeanne said, “I’ll go and ask Mason.”

Lucy nodded.

With that, Jeanne left Lucy’s room and went straight to Mason’s room.

Since they were all in the higher-level assassin rooms, she did not have to walk far. After all, the Hills treated the assassins according to their levels.

Just as she raised her hand and was about to knock on Mason’s door, the door suddenly opened.

A female assassin walked out of Mason’s room with her clothes in a mess.

She looked at Jeanne and greeted her respectfully, “Eldest Young Lady.”

Jeanne nodded. “Is Mason in?”

“What?” The assassin was stunned.

“K01,” Jeanne said.

She had almost forgotten that very few people knew him as Mason.

“In the room,” the female assassin quickly replied.

“I’m looking for him.”

“Alright.” The female assassin quickly stepped aside before leaving Mason’s room.

In fact, in the Hills, it was common for assassins to sleep with each other.

Sometimes, in order to satisfy the assassins’ physical needs, Kingsley would even air transport some prostitutes and gentlemen to the Delta Islands for the assassins to enjoy.

Therefore, it was really a common thing to see people having sex with each other in the Hills.

When Jeanne walked into Mason’s room, Mason had just taken a shower and was wrapped in a bath towel.

He paused for a moment when he saw Jeanne.

His identity was different from the other assassins, so he did not treat Jeanne with as much respect as the others.

Then, he casually picked up a pack of cigarettes from the coffee table and asked her, “Do you want some?”

Jeanne shook her head. “No.”

Mason lit one up for himself. “Is there anything I can help you with?”

“I want you to accompany me to South Hampton City,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Mason took a puff of his cigarette and asked, “Has Mr. Thorn approved it?”

“No.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
