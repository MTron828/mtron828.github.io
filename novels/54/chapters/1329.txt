1330 Chloe Slapped in the Face

Edward nodded.

That meant Wyatt did not read it wrong as Edward had just affirmed it.

He was still shocked. This was really not a small sum.

This was at least half of the Harken’s finances!

Could half of the empire really be handed over to Candice?!

Candice was also surprised. She also looked at Edward and said bluntly, “Actually, there’s no need. I don’t value these.”

“But I do,” Edward affirmed.

Candice bit her lip. She was speechless, overcome with a wave of emotions.

“I can’t give you the wedding you want, so I can only use such an extreme way to express how important this wedding is to me,” Edward said.

He added, “You can’t refuse.”

Candice was silent. She could clearly feel her heartbeat was a little chaotic.

“If there’s nothing else, the betrothal gifts are set then.” Edward looked at Wyatt.

He was afraid that they would reject his gifts. That could not be possible, Edward was such a domineering person! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Alright.” Wyatt naturally agreed.

“It’s getting late. I have other things to do tomorrow, so I won’t take up any longer of your evening.” As he spoke, Edward stood up.

Everyone stood up with him.

“Candice can send me off,” Edward said bluntly.

Candice looked up at Edward. This man had not a cell of shyness in him.

“Alright, then Candice will send Edward off,” Wyatt instructed.

“Mm.” Candice nodded. Then, she followed Edward out of the house.

The two of them walked to the entrance of the residence. Besides Edward’s personal bodyguards, there were two rows of people at the door.

Even Edward could not keep a low profile no matter wherever he went now. The car door was respectfully opened by a man in a black suit for Edward.

He walked over but did not get into the car right away.

Candice was behind him and had not left. She could not turn around and go back, so she just watched Edward’s actions.

Slowly, she watched as Edward suddenly turned around and said, “Candice, come closer.”

Candice’s eyes flickered. She had no idea why, perhaps she had not seen Edward for a long time, but with just one movement, one look, one sentence, she seemed to know what to do next.

She moved her feet and walked to Edward.

Edward looked into her eyes. He watched closely.

Edward seemed to like her eyes very much. He was always looking into her eyes in a daze.

That seemed to be the case at this moment; it was as if there was magic in her eyes that could attract him.

“Ed,” Candice called out to him.

She had a feeling that if she did not call him, he would look at her eyes like this for the entire night.

Edward came back to his senses.

He said, “You have nice pupils.”

Candice chuckled. This was the first time she had heard someone praise another’s pupils and not eyes.

Were everyone’s pupils not the same?!

What was there to look at?

Of course, she could not embarrass Edward. She smiled and praised, “You look good everywhere.”

It was just a very ordinary sentence but coming from her lips, there was an inexplicable sense of flattery. For some reason, he felt that she was taking the initiative to get close to him.

To her thought, she was just stating a fact; Edward was really good-looking.

Was he so handsome that all women would still be stunned by him at first glance? He was flawless.

“There are better-looking ones.” The corners of Edward’s lips curled up. “You’ll know.”

This man was such a teaser.

Edward bent down.

A kiss landed on Candice’s lips.

She knew it.

Edward had asked her to go over just now because he wanted to do such a thing. Though sometimes, it was really easy to get used to the intimacy.

He was used to being intimate in front of everyone.

After a long time, Edward let go of her.

He looked at her unusually red lips.

He was clearly reluctant.

His fingers gently wiped her lips. It was a very erotic action.

He said, “Get ready for your wedding night.”

Candice’s heart raced. No matter how cold she was, she would still be nervous and helpless in the face of such things.

She did not know if she was looking forward to it, but it seemed like she indeed was.

...

She blushed, unable to respond.

Of course, Edward was not so domineering that she had to answer him. He reluctantly let go of her and got into the car.
