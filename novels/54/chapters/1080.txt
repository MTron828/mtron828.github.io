1081 Going To Court: All The Crimes Have Been Proven

“What nonsense are you spouting?”

“Plaintiff, please control your emotions and keep quiet!” the judge said sternly.

Michael’s face contorted in anger.

Monica said to the judge, “The case has been made clear. Michael was the mastermind behind the entire incident. He used his authority as the former director of the quality inspection department and his help and influence on Daniel to force Daniel to produce a fake quality inspection report for him. Now that the matter had been exposed, in order to clear his name, he wanted to use Brie as a scapegoat and get Daniel to fabricate the truth. I also have evidence that can prove why Michael did this. It’s not just to take revenge on me for exposing his true colors at the wedding. The real reason is that he now controls Sunny Pharmaceutical, which has a huge competitive edge over Cardellini Enterprise. Once Cardellini Enterprise collapses, Sunny Pharmaceutical will monopolize the pharmaceutical market in Harken.”

“Do you have any evidence to prove that Michael is related to Sunny Pharmaceutical?” Judah asked Monica.

“I think the senior management of Sunny Pharmaceutical should be able to prove it.”

“Your Honor, we need to have a witness from Sunny Pharmaceutical.”

“Permission granted,”

Half an hour later, the senior manager of Sunny Pharmaceutical was brought to the courtroom.

“Is Michael the shareholder of Sunny Pharmaceutical?” Judah asked Wilson Sonny, the general manager of Sunny Pharmaceutical.

“Yes, Sunny Pharmaceutical was originally a small pharmaceutical company. It was indeed Michael who injected a large amount of capital into it and gained control of Sunny Pharmaceutical. To the public, I’m the General Manager of Sunny Pharmaceutical, but in fact, I only have less than 10 percent of Sunny Pharmaceutical’s shares. The remaining 90 percent belongs to Michael.”

Michael’s eyes were red.

At that moment, he could even guess that Wilson’s disregard for his feelings was the Sanders’ orders!

“Do you have proof?”

“This is the cooperation agreement I signed with Michael.” Wilson took out the document, seemingly having prepared for this.

Judah quickly took it and looked at it a few times before presenting it to the jury.

After the jury confirmed it, he gave the judge a definitive reply.

“In order to get Sunny Pharmaceutical to shut down Cardellini Pharmaceutical, Michael created this murderous frame-up incident.” Monica was emotional when she said that.

Michael could really disregard human lives to achieve his goal!

The crowd was also in an uproar because of what Monica said.

“Your Honor, based on the statements my client has made to the defendants, Daniel and Brie, as well as other relevant evidence, we can fully testify that the vaccine accident at Cardellini Pharmaceutical was caused by Michael. Your Honor, please make a legal judgment.”

“I admit.” Michael suddenly said loudly, “I admit that I instructed Daniel to make a fake quality inspection report, and I did want to use Brie as a scapegoat.”

Michael’s admission surprised the crowd. He had been defending himself, yet now he suddenly admitted it.

Of course, it was no longer important whether he admitted to it or not. The facts of the crime were clear, and he would be sentenced even if he did not admit it.

“But the boy’s death from the vaccine had nothing to do with me!” Michael said loud and clear.

Monica’s eyes narrowed.

The maximum sentence for creating a fake quality test report was three to five years, and only when human life was involved could the death penalty be imposed.

“Everything Monica said is true. Indeed, in order to take revenge on her and develop Sunny Pharmaceutical, I did use this vaccine accident to achieve my desired goal. However, I didn’t do anything like secretly swapping the vaccines, so that matter has nothing to do with me. ”

“There’s no such coincidence in this world!” Monica said fiercely.

“Just because it’s a coincidence doesn’t mean that I did it. What evidence do you have to prove that I did it? Daniel, Brie, or someone else? Can they testify that I did it?”

Monica looked at Daniel and Brie.

The two of them were not in the incident where Michael had secretly swapped the vaccine and instructed others to inject potassium cyanide, so they could not provide any valid evidence or testimony.

Monica was silent for a moment before saying, “The staff member who injected the vaccine into the little boy, Wally Fisk, can testify.”

Wally Fisk was also in the defendant’s seat.

He confessed that he had secretly swapped the vaccines, causing the little boy to be poisoned with potassium cyanide. Moreover, his confession stated that it was Brie who ordered him to do so.

Now, everyone’s attention was on Wally again. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Monica said, “Your Honor, with Michael’s confession and Brie’s crime, can we conclude that Brie wasn’t the mastermind behind this?”
