1238 Susan’s Arrival

However, Teddy would not think too deeply about it. After all, he had never understood Fourth Master’s matters.

He watched the two of them hold hands before he quickly turned around to bring them breakfast. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Teddy had to admit that he was happy to see them like that. In his heart, at least for now, Jeanne was the only female mistress he acknowledged.

However, Teddy’s happy expression suddenly stiffened the moment he turned around.

Was he seeing things?

He saw Susan walking in from the living room. It was the woman who had been constantly pestering Fourth Master on the news, and at that moment, she had appeared there all dressed up.

Of course, Teddy was not the only one who saw it. Edward and Jeanne saw her too.

Susan naturally saw Edward and Jeanne in the hall and looked at their interlocked fingers. However, she did not react to it, and the smile on her face did not look awkward.

Instead, Jeanne was the one who silently pushed Edward’s hand away. This time, Edward did not force it and let go of her hand.

Jeanne smiled, feeling like she had become… a mistress.

She walked past Susan and went straight to the dining room not far away. She did not want to disturb them, but she still had to eat for the baby in her belly.

“Teddy,” Jeanne called out to him.

Teddy quickly came back to his senses. He then quickly followed Jeanne to the dining room to prepare breakfast for her.

In the living room, Edward and Susan were the only two left.

Susan looked at Edward’s expression and smiled brightly. “You don’t seem to welcome me?”

“What are you doing here?” Edward’s coldness toward her was undisguisable.

The moment she walked in and saw Edward holding Jeanne’s hand, he definitely did not have that expression. Although he was not smiling then, his eyes were filled with gentleness.

In the past, she had thought that being cold to people was Edward’s personality. After all, before she saw him with Jeanne, Edward treated everyone like that.

However, the devastatingly handsome and deeply-in-love Edward that she saw during his grand wedding with Jeanne back when she was in the entertainment industry was not an illusion.

Susan did not reveal too much of her emotions. She said, “Didn’t we agree to meet your father today?”

“My father doesn’t live here.”

“With our relationship, can’t I come here to look for you?”

“You can’t.”

“That’s really cruel,” Susan complained, but she did not look angry at all. She even said it coquettishly.

Jeanne, who was sitting in the distance, could see everything clearly. She could hear what they were saying, but she could see their interaction.

Her eyes suddenly moved, and she looked up to see Teddy suddenly standing in front of her.

Jeanne smiled.

She was looking at them because she was wondering if she could have a chance to talk to Susan. She really did not have any other intentions.

To a person who was about to die, love was not that important. After all, even if she died, Edward would not be able to protect her forever.

Since she could accept the fact that Edward would marry another woman and have children after her death, she could also accept the fact that Edward would fall in love with another woman when she was about to die.

Of course, she did not want to make things difficult for Teddy.

Teddy was still on her side, and he probably did not want to see her too sad. Therefore, she decided not to look at them and ate her breakfast quietly.

She did not know why, but the baby in her stomach was so excited today and kept moving in her stomach.

At that moment, she felt a little nauseated eating breakfast, but she endured it and forced herself to eat.

She just ate slower than before.

“Jeanne.” A female voice suddenly sounded beside them.

Jeanne looked up, and Teddy was obviously on guard.

“Teddy, you can leave first,” Jeanne instructed.

Teddy left unwillingly. Even though he was some distance away, he still stared at them closely, as if he was really afraid that she would be bullied.

Not only did Jeanne notice it, but Susan also noticed it.

She could not help but say, “He’s quite loyal to you.”

“He’s only loyal to Edward.” Jeanne said bluntly, “So when you move in in in the future, he will treat you the same.”

“Is that so?” Susan did not care.

There was no need for Jeanne to explain too much about that matter.
