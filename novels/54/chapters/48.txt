Chapter 49: Kissing in Public at the Wedding

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the huge wedding lawn.

Jeanne asked, “Have you heard Finn’s explanation?”

“Have you heard Eden’s explanation?” Monica asked.

Jeanne smiled.

She had once... wanted to hear it.

Nonetheless, Eden chose to put his interests first.

Jeanne said, “Go on.”

“Finn was sponsored by my father. In order to repay my father’s kindness, Finn married me, not to mention that it was only an agreement,” Monica said casually as if she did not like to talk about her feelings.

It was not that she did not like it, but she felt that she did not have a sense of accomplishment, so she was not happy to say it out loud.

“Do you still like Michale now?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

Monica was stunned.

It seemed that she was strongly moved.

Monica sighed slightly. “So what if I like him? I can’t shamelessly get married to him. If I do that, my father will probably die on the spot.”

“Do you really not like Finn at all?” Jeanne asked again.

Just as she asked, Finn walked over.

When he walked over, he heard Monica say resolutely, “I told you, I’ll never like Finn again in this life!”

Perhaps Finn heard it very clearly.

Jeanne gave Monica a look.

Monica turned around.

When she turned around, her eyes met Finn’s.

At that moment, her heart skipped a beat.

Suddenly, it seemed very calm.

In any case, Finn did not like her, so she did not need to be emotionally burdened.

Furthermore, he even said last night that he was afraid that she would tarnish his innocence!

‘Tsk, tsk, tsk.

‘He has the nerve to say that he’s innocent?!’

“The wedding is about to start.” Finn’s expression was calm as if he did not hear what Monica said.

Jeanne nodded slightly. She held George’s hand and walked toward the main venue of the wedding.

Monica followed Finn.

The seats were all arranged.

According to the rules of South Hampton City, the bride’s side was the guest of honor at the wedding, so the Lawrences’ seats were naturally in the most conspicuous place.

Jeanne and George sat at the side of the seats for the Lawrences.

The wedding was about to begin. The other guests also sat and waited for the ceremony to begin.

While Jeanne was waiting for the wedding to begin, she took out her phone and played with it.

A message popped up: [If I play Jasmine’s video now, her life will be ruined. Are you sure you don’t want me to play it?]

The message was sent to her by Kingsley.

After taking down the mini camera, Jeanne copied the content and sent it to Kingsley before deleting it.

Many things were not safe with her, after all.

Jeanne replied: [Am I someone who wants temporary relief? Jasmine is still useful, so why should I enjoy temporary relief?]

Kingsley replied to her with two smiley emojis.

Jeanne continued to type: [Also, don’t be so hypocritical. If you really wanted to make me happy, you would’ve released it long ago. Why are you still asking me?!]

Kingslet seemed to be a little embarrassed, so he responded with two words: [Talk later.] Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jeanne also put down her phone.

At this moment, a person sat next to her.

Jeanne turned her head.

She was stunned.

Fourth Master Swan nodded as if he was greeting her.

“Fourth Master, did you take the wrong seat?” Jeanne asked, the corners of her mouth maintaining a strange smile.

“Is there anyone beside you?”

“This is the seat for the main guest,” Jeanne said.

“The Swans don’t have so many rules.”

“...”

At this moment, the wedding music began to play.

Jeanne turned around and focused her attention on the wedding.

Eden had changed into a black suit. His tall and straight body made him look handsome.

As the wedding music played, Jasmine held onto Alexander’s arm and walked toward Eden step by step.

Jeanne just watched silently. There was no expression on her face, and her mood did not fluctuate much.

She had almost forgotten that when she was passionately in love with Eden back then, she had imagined her wedding with him…

“What kind of wedding do you like, Ms. Lawrence?” The person beside her suddenly asked.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

Sometimes, she was afraid of this Fourth Master Swan.

She even felt that he knew exactly what she was thinking.

Jeanne smiled. “It’s just a formality. I don’t have a particular one I like.”

“Is that so?”

“What kind of wedding do you like, Fourth Master?” Jeanne asked back. She did not know how to answer him and did not want the conversation to become too awkward.

Edward smiled.

‘I didn’t make a mistake.’

He just smiled.

When he smiled, he looked exceptionally good.

Edward said with his magnetic voice, “The wedding isn’t important. What’s important is the bride.”

Jeanne felt that there was nothing wrong with Fourth Master Swan’s words.

She was about to speak.

Suddenly, she heard a gentle female’s voice. Even a woman’s heart would move when one heard it. “Edward.”

Jeanne raised her head.

She saw a woman wearing a white dress. The dress was elegant, and her long black hair looked elegant in the breeze.

“Can I sit next to you?” The woman asked with a smile.

Jeanne looked left and right.

Fourth Master Swan was on the left side of the aisle while she was on his right.

This meant that the woman was asking her to make way.

Jeanne was not interested in this wedding, so she pulled George up to leave.

Her arm was suddenly grabbed by a big hand.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

“Ms. Lawrence, we haven’t finished talking just now,” Fourth Master Swan said in a low voice.

Jeanne looked at the woman in front of her and then at Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan did not even look at the woman and said bluntly, “What I mean is, the wedding isn’t important. As long as you’re the bride, it’s fine.”

Jeanne’s heart moved slightly.

No matter how hard the woman in front of her tried to hide, a hint of anger appeared on her gentle and beautiful face. She bit her rosy lip and turned around to leave.

Jeanne looked at the woman’s back view.

Thanks to Fourth Master Swan, Jeanne had another enemy.

Jeanne moved her arm.

Fourth Master Swan let go.

“Fourth Master, I’m afraid it’s against your status as an elder for you to use me as a shield,” Jeanne said with some sarcasm.

“Who said I’m using you as a shield?” The corners of Fourth Master Swan’s mouth curled up.

Jeanne had yet to react.

Thin and cold lips pressed against hers.

Jeanne was stunned.

At that moment, she was truly stunned.

It had really been a long time since she was at a loss.

She felt the man’s lips on her lips, and he stuck his tongue into her mouth…

Just as it was about to touch the tip of her tongue, she suddenly pushed the man away.

Jeanne’s heart was beating fast.

Her eyes moved slightly.

Not only did the woman who had just left suddenly turn around and see it, many people around them saw it as well.

It was even to the extent that Eden and Jasmine, who were supposed to be the main characters today, instantly became extras. All eyes were on Jeanne and Edward.

Jeanne blushed.

She blushed…

Disregarding the reactions of others, Edward asked bluntly, “Ms. Lawrence, do you still think that I’m joking?”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she finally understood why Monica called Finn a “scum”!

When one hated a person but could not beat a person, one could only vent it out like that!
