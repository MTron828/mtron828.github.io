Chapter 263: Melody’s Tragic End

In the barn.

Melody was beaten to the point of her dying breath by Jeanne’s violence.

Jeanne did not go through so many stages. She was not as perverted as Melody.

She just needed to take revenge.

An eye for an eye.

Melody’s body was covered in blood. She lay on the ground, not moving at all.

Throughout the whole process, Edward just watched silently. He watched silently as Jeanne was still able to knock Melody down to the point that Melody could not move anymore.

Edward watched as Jeanne walked barefoot toward Melody.

Jeanne squatted down.

She grabbed Melody’s hair and forced her to look up at her.

Melody’s expression was ferocious. She did not have any strength to resist. She was not as powerful as Jeanne. Even if Jeanne was exhausted, she would still resist. On the other hand, Melody did not want to resist at all. She would rather die like this.

She said fiercely to Jeanne, “Kill me! Kill me!”

“I won’t kill you,” Jeanne said cruelly.

‘Kill you?

‘In Harken, one’s life had to be paid with one’s life!’

Jeanne said, “I’ll return everything you did to me just now!”

“What are you going to do?!” Melody looked at Jeanne in fear.

Jeanne’s words at this moment were more terrifying than if she were to kill her.

“I heard that you’ve always kept your innocence for Fourth Master Swan?” Jeanne’s lips curled up.

Melody’s body trembled.

She could not stop trembling.

“You’ve liked him since young, so you’ve never slept with other men before, have you?!” Jeanne asked in a sinister manner.

“What are you going to do?!” Melody screamed.

She screamed crazily.

“Fourth Master,” Jeanne called out to Edward softly.

Edward walked over.

“Do you want her?” Jeanne asked without turning her head.

Melody’s face was filled with malevolence.

Jeanne said, “She kept her innocence for you. Do you want her?”

She was asking Edward if he wanted to sleep with the woman who had kept her innocence for him.

After all, Melody had kept her innocence for him.

Jeanne needed to seek his opinion.

Edward did not answer.

He did not answer and just looked straight at Jeanne.

“If you don’t answer, I’ll take it that you don’t want her,” Jeanne said.

She said it so casually.

Edward still stood by her side and did not say a word.

“Apart from you and Dr. Jones, is there anyone else?” Jeanne turned to look at Edward.

Edward nodded slightly.

He turned around and walked toward Finn, who had his back facing them.

Edward whispered into Finn’s ear.

Finn nodded.

He picked up the phone and made a call.

After a while, the barn was filled with people.

It was filled with men in black suits.

Melody looked at the scene in front of her and was shocked.

‘Who are these people?!

‘Why were there so many people?

‘Are they all here to save Jeanne?!

‘It’s only Jeanne.

‘Did Edward need to use so many people?!’

Melody looked at them fiercely.

She saw Jeanne suddenly let go of her hair and stood up from the ground.

Jeanne turned around and walked toward the room full of men.

She turned her head toward Edward. “Fourth Master, can they listen to me?”

Edward nodded.

At this moment, he also gave a look to the person in front of him.

The person who took the lead understood what he meant and immediately waited respectfully for Jeanne’s order.

“Strip her of her clothes and f*ck her. After that, throw her onto the most luxurious street in the city and let everyone in Harken see the body of the Sanders’ third princess! As for her face, there’s no need to disfigure it. She’s ugly enough...”

“Jeanne!” Melody screamed.

When she heard Jeanne’s words, she became incomparably crazy.

Jeanne was unmoved.

What was karma?!

This was karma.

Melody’s cruel method was applied to her in the end.

“Jeanne, I’m a Sander. If you dare to treat me like this, my dad will kill you. He’ll kill you!” Melody’s tragic cry was heart-wrenching.

Jeanne sneered.

She originally did not plan to bother with Melody anymore.

At this moment, she turned around and walked toward her.

She walked in front of Melody and squatted down in front of her.

Jeanne said a few words to Melody in an extremely soft voice.

After hearing what she said, Melody was completely stunned.

At that moment, her pupils seemed to have lost their light.

Melody looked at Jeanne dumbfoundedly, but it also seemed as if her mind was wandering in her own thoughts.

Jeanne said slowly, “Go back and ask your dad if it’s true!”

After saying that, she did not waste any more time.

She stood up and walked toward Edward.

Edward looked at Jeanne.

He saw that she had clearly reached her limit, but she could still persevere and stand tall.

“Is it over?” Edward asked her.

Jeanne smiled and nodded.

Edward bent down.

He approached Jeanne and carried her in his arms.

Jeanne lay quietly in his arms.

She was such a petite person. She was so petite in his arms that it was as though she would break at the touch. Why did she have such explosive strength?

Edward did not even dare to imagine what Jeanne had experienced.

What did she experience even though she did not fall in the end?

Until this moment.

Jeanne, who was leaning against Edward’s embrace, suddenly let her guard down. She slept peacefully in his embrace.

Edward carried her out of the barn.

Behind him, Melody’s heart-wrenching scream was heard.

That scream... It was as if she had given up on this world.

For a woman who had kept her innocence for 25 years, her life was probably worse than death at this moment!

However, she was not worth sympathizing with.

Edward carried Jeanne out of the barn.

Finn naturally followed behind them.

Outside the barn, Finn thought that Monica had left with Micheal.

Who knew, Finn saw her looking anxiously with red eyes at the barn’s entrance as if she had been waiting for Jeanne.

Seeing that Jeanne was carried out by Fourth Master Swan, Monica ran over. “Jeanne.”

She called out to Jeanne.

Monica was afraid that if Jeanne closed her eyes, she would not be able to wake up.

Jeanne responded, “Mm.”

She was so weak that she could not speak anymore.

She was tired.

She was really tired to the point that she wanted to rest.

She had used up too much energy today. She could not even open her eyes at this time.

Edward also noticed that Jeanne was exhausted.

He carried her and walked into his car.

Finn followed him. He opened the door to the driver’s seat and was ready to get in.

“Finn,” Monica called out to him.

Finn paused.

He turned around.

“Can I follow you?” Monica asked him.

She was asking him and was waiting for his answer.

If Finn said that she could not follow him…

She might not follow him.

It seemed that she just did not belong in their world.

She was too weak.

Finn pursed his lips.

He had yet to speak when he saw Micheal, who had always been by Monica’s side, suddenly hugged her and said, “You’re still injured. I’ll send you to the hospital first.”

Monica’s eyes were red.

She wanted to stay with Jeanne.

“Fourth Master will take care of Jeanne. Nothing will happen to her.”

Monica was still unmoved.

Her eyes were red as she looked straight at Finn.

She was filled with anticipation, but she did not dare to hope too much.

Finn turned around and sat in the driver’s seat.

He said, “Get in the car.”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She had thought that Finn would reject her outright.

She just thought that he would despise her.

Micheal’s eyes narrowed.

His expression obviously changed.

Monica left Micheal’s embrace.

“Monica,” Micheal called out to her, “You should go to the hospital first.”

“I’m only suffering from superficial injuries. I’m really fine.”

“But I feel sorry for you.”

“I want to be by Jeanne’s side now.” Monica looked at Micheal.

Micheal was obviously a little emotional.

“Thank you for tonight.” Monica was unable to care about Micheal’s emotions.

To her, the most important person in this world was either her parents or Jeanne, who she had grown up with.

Monica suddenly tiptoed.

She tiptoed and planted a kiss on Micheal’s lips.

It was gratitude.

Gratitude for what he had done to her tonight.

The next moment...

Monica quickly turned around and sat in the passenger seat of Finn’s car.

She knew very well that Finn would not have the patience to wait for her.

As long as she was a little slower, Finn would drive away.

Micheal watched Monica get into Finn’s car and leave.

His expression was cold. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He looked in the direction of the car coldly.

He admitted that he would choose his own interests in the face of benefits.

However, in terms of feelings, he could not bear for Monica to leave with another man.

Although Monica was married to Finn, Micheal was not jealous because he knew very well the situation of their marriage. Moreover, it was the result of him choosing his interests back then, so he could rationally accept it.

However, at this moment, he could only watch helplessly as Monica left with Finn.

It made him go crazy!
