Chapter 55: Jeanne and Edward Reached an Agreement

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I agree to it, so what right do you have to go back on your word?!” Edward questioned.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Seven years ago.

Seven years ago…

Jeanne looked at Edward. “I told you that I did it on a whim. Now that I’ve calmed down, I don’t want to think about it anymore.”

“Is sex such a child’s play?” Edward asked her.

“If not?” Jeanne smiled, seemingly unconcerned. “Otherwise, in such a modern era, did you think that adults have sex to make a pledge to be married?”

Edward’s face was dark.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She did not want to provoke him.

Jeanne had pretended not to know him and that the night seven years ago did not happen. What else did Edward want?!

She felt that what she wanted to express at this moment had been clearly expressed.

Jeanne slowly squatted down and left under Fourth Master Swan’s arm.

She had just taken a few steps when…

“So, I was supposed to sleep with you for free seven years ago?” Suddenly, Fourth Master Swan’s voice came from behind her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

In any case, they had slept with each other. Why was it that he was not letting the matter go?

She turned around and asked, “Are you asking me to pay you then?”

Edward looked at her.

“If you’re too expensive, can I do it in installments?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

She looked at the man in front of her with a provocative look. The man suddenly smiled.

Edward asked, “Since you’re so sincere, Ms. Lawrence, how about we discuss a deal?”

Jeanne frowned.

She had a feeling that Fourth Master Swan was up to no good.

“Since you know very well why I kissed you at Eden’s wedding yesterday, you also know that I was indeed rejecting the Sanders’ third princess. I’ve never liked to get involved with women. If you can make the third princess of the Sanders stop thinking about me, then everything that happened between us will be written off.”

‘Damn it, this insidious man!’

Jeanne was a nobody, and yet Edward was asking her to go against the Sanders’ princess.

Was he not pushing her to the brink of death?

“What do you think?” Edward asked.

“I only slept with you once. Is there a need for you to do this?” Jeanne suppressed her anger.

“You can still choose to date me.” Edward was straightforward.

‘Damn it. If I date him, it’ll mean that he’s giving up on Melody! In the end, I’ll be an eyesore to Melody,’ Jeanne thought.

The man was cunning.

“You can think about it. Give me an answer tomorrow. It’s not too late.” Edward appeared to be very generous.

“Is there no other choice?”

“No.” Edward’s words were concise.

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately. “I’ll help you make Melody stop thinking about you. After that, there’ll be nothing between us anymore!”

“Deal.”

Jeanne did not say anything more and turned around to leave.

She returned to the living room and at that moment, the others had left the table.

Nox saw that Jeanne had returned and said jokingly, “You’re back already? Fourth Master Swan is too fast.”

Jeanne glanced at Nox and walked directly to Ruby, who was preparing some fruits after dinner in the kitchen. “Auntie, I’ll go back first.”

“You’re leaving so soon? Didn’t you just come?” Ruby was reluctant for her to leave.

“I have something to do.”

“Did Fourth Master Swan embarrass you just now?” Ruby asked in a low voice, “He gave me a shock too. Fourth Master Swan came to our house a few times when you were abroad, and it was also because of Monica and Finn. As rumored, he has always been cold and silent. Today, he suddenly confessed to you at the dinner table. I was surprised.”

“Auntie, don’t think too much. He has a motive.”

“What motive?” Ruby asked, “He seems quite sincere.”

“In short, it’s impossible between him and me. You should also tell uncle not to let the news about me and Fourth Master Swan today spread.”

“Don’t worry. Am I a gossipy person? I know some things shouldn’t be said!” Ruby nodded.

“I know you’re the best,” Jeanne said sincerely.

Monica’s parents were not old. They were not even 50 years old, and they were very open-minded. When Jeanne was in high school and got together with Eden, the first elder she informed was Ruby. At that time, Ruby had taught her a lot. She basically said that it was okay to fall in love, but Jeanne must protect herself.

When it came to Eden, Jeanne had indeed protected herself very well, but she had lost her virginity to another man.

Jeanne did not want to think about it anymore. “Auntie, I’ll be leaving first.”

“Come over more often when you’re free.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne left the kitchen and walked toward the sofa in the hall. She held George’s hand and said, “I still have some things to do, so I’ll take George and leave first.”

“Fourth Master Swan hasn’t left yet, so how can you leave?!” Monica called out to her.

Jeanne ignored Monica.

The person who always betrayed her best friend was none other than Monica!

Monica watched helplessly as Jeanne left.

She turned her head and saw Fourth Master Swan enter from the back garden as well.

He said to Nox, “Let’s go.”

“Alright.” In front of Fourth Master Swan, Nox was as docile as a little sheep.

If Fourth Master Swan did not show that he liked Jeannie, Monica would suspect that the two of them were gay.

“Fourth Master Swan,” Gary suddenly called out to Edward.

Edward stopped in his tracks.

Gary walked toward him. “Let’s talk in private.”

Edward gave Nox a look, indicating that he should wait.

He and Gary walked to the side.

Gary did not beat around the bush. “Will your father agree to you liking Jeannie?”

“This is my own matter.”

“I suggest you tell your father about it,” Gary said bluntly.

Edward did not say anything.

“It’ll only be fair to Jeannie.”

“Based on your understanding of my father, do you think he’ll agree to the marriage?” Edward asked.

“No.” Gary was resolute.

Therefore, he was merely reminding Edward not to mess with Jeanne.

Edward asked, “Then why should I seek his opinion?”

“Fourth Master Swan.” Gary was serious. “You don’t have to go against your father.”

“Should I be used by him like a machine?”

Gary was stunned.

He had watched Edward grow up since young and had never seen him go against Old Master Swan.

“My life is his, but my feelings aren’t,” Edward said coldly and turned around to leave.

Gary watched him leave.

He was afraid that... there was going to be a bloody storm.

…

After leaving the Cardellini family’s villa, Edward sat in the back seat with a gloomy face.

Nox sat in the passenger’s seat and turned to look at him. He asked, “Feeling frustrated? Or did Uncle Gary say something to you?”

Edward did not say a word. His expression was as cold as ice.

Nox was helpless. He knew that when this fellow did not speak, he would not open his mouth no matter what.

He turned around and looked at the streets of South Hampton City. He looked at the sunny sky.

The Edward he knew had never been truly happy ever since they were young.

It was seven years ago when Nox first saw Edward smile from the bottom of his heart. Edward got up from the bed with Jeanne and said to Nox, “Once she’s awake, help me boil a bowl of brown sugar water for her.”

That day, Nox was supposed to accompany Edward to go out, but Edward asked him to stay to take care of Jeanne.

The price Nox had to pay for staying was that Edward came back covered in blood!

By the time Edward returned, Jeanne had left. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She left South Hampton City.
