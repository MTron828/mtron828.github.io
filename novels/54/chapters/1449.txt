Chapter 1450: Stirring Up Trouble

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At that moment, they all sat down according to the host’s arrangement.

Wyatt’s birthday party was not grand. It was just a few good friends having a meal together, and there was no exaggerated ceremony.

Everyone was eating quietly.

“Paige, what do you like to eat? I’ll take them for you.” Chloe deliberately sat beside Paige, as if to please Paige.

“No need, Aunt. Mommy knows what I like to eat.” Paige politely declined Chloe’s offer.

Chloe’s expression was a little ugly. To think Candice had bought over Paige!

Candice, on the other hand, could not help but smile. She did not say anything to Paige, but she did not expect that little girl to be so sensible.

After all, she had thought that Paige was friendly and close to everyone. With that comparison, Paige was indeed much closer to her, and as she ate, she took care of Paige.

Seeing how loving the interaction between the two of them was, Chloe’s expression turned even uglier. She wanted to strangle Candice to death the moment she thought all of Candice’s should be hers. That woman always seemed to give her a hard time.

After lunch, Wyatt invited Edward to the tea room for tea.

Those who came to attend Wyatt’s birthday were also officials, and most of them naturally hoped that Edward would go. Hence, Candice tactfully left Edward’s side and brought Paige to her room.

Paige had the habit of taking afternoon naps, so she soon fell asleep in bed. Candice, on the other hand, could not fall asleep. In fact, she was baffled at why this place felt even more unfamiliar to her than Bamboo Garden.

After she tucked Paige in, she walked out to the balcony, and outside the balcony was the Nicholsons’ back garden. At that moment, there were a few people coming and going, so it was relatively quiet.

Candice sat on the balcony and suddenly felt… like smoking, but that was not the first time she felt that urge.

Whenever she was alone and had nothing to do, she would feel an inexplicable desire to smoke. However, she refused to give in to it every time, as if she believed smoking was wrong.

Moreover, she had to be careful as she was still hoping to get pregnant lately. She had never taken any precautions with Edward, and for some reason, she was still not pregnant after two months.

She had just finished her period, so it should be possible this month. She hoped that she could get pregnant with a girl to keep Paige company.

Candice sat on the balcony and thought about some things quietly.

Just then, she suddenly saw Edward in the backyard. Just as she was about to call out to him, she saw Chloe following behind Edward.

“Edward,” Chloe called out to him.

Edward turned around and looked at her.

“Edward, I have something to ask you.” Chloe looked shy.

“Tell me,” Edward said indifferently.

“I’d like to the diplomat exam, but do you think it’s better to choose Mr. Scott or Mr. Zane? I haven’t been able to make up my mind, and my dad hasn’t given me any good suggestions, so I thought I’ll ask you.”

Edward thought for a moment before saying, “Go with Mr. Zane. He’s more outstanding in teaching and has nurtured many outstanding diplomatic officers.”

“I knew you would give me good advice. Thank you, Edward.” Candice carried

herself as a well-mannered person.

Edward, however, just turned around coldly and was about to leave.

“Edward… Ah!” Chloe suddenly screamed.

It looked like she had sprained her ankle, and her entire body fell into Edward’s embrace, forcing Edward to support her.

She looked shocked as she grabbed onto Edward’s clothes tightly and did not react for a long time. Her body even deliberately rubbed against his seductively.

“Be careful,” Edward said coldly.

Chloe blushed and said, “I’m sorry, Edward.”

However, Edward ignored Chloe, let go of her, and turned to leave.

Chloe looked at Edward’s cold back view. Her expression was a little ugly as she gritted her teeth. If Candice could seduce a man, there was no way she could not. With that, She turned around and walked into the living room of the villa. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Candice watched their interaction, thinking that Chloe would die in Edward’s hands one day. After all, offending the leader of a country was a crime punishable by death.

She then returned to her room, lay back on the bed, and slept with Paige.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the door..
