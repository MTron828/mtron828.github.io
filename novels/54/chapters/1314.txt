1315 The First Negotiation With George

“Okay.” Monica accepted the clothes.

“Monica, do you have any plans later? It’s Saturday today.”

“Why? What’s the matter?”

“No. Remember I mentioned my parents are back here too. They heard that I’m working at your place now, so they want you to come over for dinner.”

“Are you bribing me?” Monica looked serious.

“I can’t say that I’m bribing you, but I want to suck up to you,” Brandon said seriously.

“Alright, if you work for me in the future and don’t make any mistakes, I won’t treat you badly.”

“So is that a no?”

“I want to go back to my mother’s house today. I haven’t been back for a long time. Let’s meet again next time.”

“Oh, it just so happens that my parents have an appointment with your parents.” Brandon smiled.

She had a feeling that she had fallen into a trap.

Brandon added, “Moreover, my family just happened to move back to our old house. It’s your neighbor.”

Monica just stared at Brandon. It was obvious that there was no way to refuse.

She said, “Then give me a minute. I’ll wash up and change.”

“Mm.” Brandon nodded.

Monica carried the clothes bought by Brandon into the bathroom.

Brandon stood and stared outside from the floor-to-ceiling hotel windows, looking at the streets of South Hampton, waiting for her.

It had been so many years since they parted. She had probably forgotten the joke she had said when she was young.

Brandon turned around and saw Monica walking out of the bathroom.

He bought her a set of casual and simple clothes. It was a white T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and a pair of white shoes. She looked really youthful.

Monica realized that Brandon’s attire was really similar to hers. It was also a white T-shirt, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of white shoes.

“I bought it from the same shop, so the styles of both men and women are similar,” Brandon quickly explained, seemingly noticing Monica’s gaze.

“Don’t tell me you have a crush on me?” Monica did not mind.

Moreover, she was wearing a white t-shirt and jeans. It was not a couple outfit.

“I…” Brandon’s face turned red.

However, Monica did not take these words to heart at all. She walked to the side and looked at herself in the mirror.

Looking at her outfit, although it was simple, it was really quite good-looking. She liked it.

“Do you have a girlfriend?” Monica asked.

“Huh?” Brandon was still feeling a little awkward when he suddenly heard Monica’s straightforward question.

“You must have a girlfriend. You’re so handsome and rich, you must have many women out there.” Monica did not even need an answer to know. The reason she asked was, “To be able to grasp a woman’s measurements so well, you must have seen countless women.”

Monica was actually talking about the size of the underwear.

What Brandon bought for her was just right.

“Are you talking about the size of the clothes?” Brandon took a while to react.

“Yes, it’s quite fitting,” Monica affirmed.

“I couldn’t tell.” Brandon blushed. “I went to the lingerie shop to ask. You should be the VIP of this lingerie shop. They knew your size when I asked, so they recommended the one you’re wearing.”

This guy was quite smart.

“And I don’t have a girlfriend,” Brandon explained.

“Did you break up?” Monica asked.

It was not like that but Brandon did not know how to answer.

“That’s true. Even long-distance relationships don’t end well.” Monica tidied up her clothes and patted Brandon’s shoulder.

She suddenly felt that this guy was quite tall, and seemed to be similar to Finn.

Finn was six feet one, but this guy was at least six feet.

She said, “There are many beautiful girls in Nancheng. I’ll introduce a few to you.”

Brandon smiled. “Then keep your word.”

“Of course.” Monica’s face was full of certainty. The smile on Brandon’s face was obvious. It was the feeling of a sunny boy, and his heart was warm.

He did not seem to be so liked when he was young.

After Monica was done packing, she left the hotel with Brandon. Brandon drove while Monica sat in the passenger seat and looked at her phone. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When she opened her eyes this morning, she was looking for news of what happened yesterday. Fortunately, she did not find any. Still, she was worried and wanted to confirm it again.

“Monica, I’m going to that place in front to buy breakfast.” Brandon parked the car by the roadside. “I heard from a friend that the Chinese soup dumplings are tasty. I’ll buy some for you.”
