1265 Jeanne Goes Into Labor

Jeanne looked at George’s writing.

It was the first time she saw him write so much.

[XX/XX/XX: I want my dad and my mom to get back together. I think the problem with my dad and my mom is my mom’s rejection of my dad. I don’t know why my mom would suddenly reject my dad, my dad clearly loves her so much, I can feel it, I’m jealous.]

So, George, you started to love your dad more didn’t you?

Jeanne continued to turn down the page.

[XX/XX/XX: My dad said that Grandpa passed away. I saw Grandpa’s body, lying in a coffin. I actually didn’t have a lot of affection for my grandpa because I didn’t have much contact with him, but it still made me sad that he passed away suddenly. In my mind, I always thought that my grandpa was a very powerful old man and he wouldn’t fall. My dad said that everyone falls, and one day he will too, so be sure that I work hard and strong to be able to protect all the important people around me.

[I thought about it, the most important people left around me are my dad and my mom, and if one insists, my sister inside my mom’s belly. I suddenly had the urge to become stronger. So this time my dad wanted to send me away, I didn’t resist anymore. I would just be a little sad to part with them.

[I told myself that I would come back anyway. Return so I can see them again. My dad said that the next time I come back, I might see my sister. I’m looking forward to that meeting with Paige.]

...

That was all George wrote in his diary.

Jeanne’s eyes ended up a little teary.

All the psychological changes George experienced in South Hampton was recorded in this notebook.

She looked at George’s poor writing.

A tear just fell on the diary.

She wiped it clean with a tissue.

Slowly, Jeanne found a new notebook.

She looked into the notebook and began to write down a lot of words.

Perhaps one day, she thought, one day, George would flip through it.

Even if he could not remember her, perhaps he would remember that she would always love him.

She wrote a lot.

She lost track of time while writing.

She wrote to the point she did not even notice the presence of someone around. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Until.

She was a little tired of writing.

She moved her arms, and the moment she turned her eyes, she saw Edward beside her.

The moment she saw him, she could not help but silently had the notebook closed.

Then pretending as if nothing had happened, she smiled at him, “Back so soon?”

“Mm.” Edward nodded slightly.

At that moment his eyes clearly glanced at her closed laptop.

“I didn’t expect it to be so late.” Jeanne deliberately shifted her eyes, “Suddenly I feel a little hungry.”

“Let’s go, Teddy has already made dinner.”

“Okay.” Jeanne got up.

Her body was so clumsy that she could only stand up with the help of Edward.

She didn’t refuse either.

Even at the moment when Edward supported him, she took advantage of the opportunity to hold his hand.

They interlocked fingers.

There were obvious slight fluctuations on Edward’s face.

The two held hands and walked to the hall.

Teddy has indeed served dinner on the table.

Two of them quietly eat dinner.

It seems that Edward’s cell phone rang several times.

Each time, he hung up.

After hanging up, it will persist ringing.

Just at the moment when Edward wanted to turn off the phone.

“Go ahead and pick it up. I think Susan should have something important for you.” Jeanne ate her dinner and said carelessly.

Edward raised her eyes to look at her.

“Susan promised me that she won’t come here to provoke you casually. I guess something really happened. Although I’m jealous, I won’t cause trouble for no reason.” Jeanne smiled.

Edward picked up the phone and walked aside.

Jeanne just ate dinner on her own.

After a little while, Edward returned to the dining room.

He said, “I’m going out for a while.”

“Okay.”

“Susan’s father just had a car accident, and now everyone has gone to the hospital.” Edward explained.

He probably did not want to hide anything from her anymore.

...

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

It was actually really understandable.

At this time, as Susan’s fiancé, he should be by Susan’s side.

If there was no mistake, Alex would also go. After all, his identity was still William.

And if Alex has gone, it is even more impossible for Edward to not go.

After eating dinner, Edward left.

Jeanne went back to George’s room.

She flipped the notebook that she had yet to finish writing in and continued writing.
