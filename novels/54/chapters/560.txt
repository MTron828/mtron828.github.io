At that moment, Jeanne did not intend to side with Monica.

Seeing that Jeanne kept silent, Monica’s eyes turned red. “Was I wrong in doing that? In regards to Michael’s matter, was I wrong?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

Monica felt a wave of discomfort in her heart.

She thought Jeanne would understand her since she had already justified her decision.

“I can put myself in your position and agree with what you did, but as a bystander, or even from Dr. Jones’s point of view, what you did is too immature,” Jeanne told her straight to her face.

Monica bit her lips, and her eyes turned red again.

Now that everyone was against her decision, she started reflecting on herself — whether her impulse decision was right or not.

Should she have used another way to help Michael instead of what she thought was the most effective?

“But now that you’ve done it, there’s no point in saying anything,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Monica could only nod silently and say, “I really didn’t think my decision would be so unpopular. My parents, my most important friend, and Finn...”

Tears began to well up in Monica’s eyes.

She recalled how cold Finn was to her just now. It was as if he was looking at her like she was a stranger.

“You just think you’re helping others, but in fact, you don’t know how much harm you’ve caused others. By saying to the press today that you kept your innocence for Michael, you’re pushing Dr. Jones further and further away.” Jeanne could not help but sigh.

That silly girl barely considered things before doing them.

“At that time, I just wanted to make the press believe in my relationship with Michael so that he could recover his image sooner,” Monica explained.

“I understand, but does anyone else understand? Does Dr. Jones understand? He has been reluctant to hurt you for so many years, yet you just trampled on his kindness to you.” Feeling a little annoyed, Jeanne said, ” Forget it. Let’s not talk about it anymore.”

If she continued talking, she was afraid that Monica would cry again.

In the end, she still gave in to Monica.

They both grew up together, so she understood Monica’s character very well. If she said too much now, Monica might really be depressed.

She said, “Since you’ve chosen to divorce Finn and help Michael, don’t care about whether your decision is right or wrong. Regardless of right or wrong, the decision has been made, and you can’t change anything. I called you here today to give you some advice on this matter.”

Monica nodded.

Even though Jeanne did not agree with her doing so, she would still consider it from her standpoint, and for that, Monica was touched.

With her red eyes and red nose, she looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “When it comes to helping Michael, you must keep your principles! First of all, if you have never thought of being together with Michael, you shouldn’t be too intimate with him, such as holding hands, hugging, kissing, and even sleeping together–”

“There’s no way!” Monica retorted.

How could she and Michael do such a thing?

“Just because you don’t think it’s possible, doesn’t mean he doesn’t!”

Monica was about to speak when Jeanne said, “I know you trust Michael, but you have to listen to me now.”

Monica bit her lip and nodded.

“Whether it’s in public, in private, or for the sake of dignity, you have to reject Michael from being too friendly. Once you compromise, you’ll do it again and again. As to helping Michael, you have to take a clear stand. Don’t let Michael think that he can rekindle your old relationship.”

“Okay,” Monica agreed.

“While you and Michael are ‘together’, you have to pay attention to Michael’s career development. Once it seems like his position has stabilized, you have to pull yourself back in time. The longer you’re together, the stronger your relationship will be.”

“Okay.”

“During this period of time, I suggest you don’t disturb Dr. Jones,” Jeanne said, “While you’re still involved with Michael, the more you disturb him, the more Dr. Jones would get fed up with you. You’d better treat it like you and Dr. Jones are divorced.”

Monica nodded with her eyes still red.

Was Finn’s attitude toward her obvious?

“Last but not least.” Jeanne looked stern, which scared Monica a little.

Jeanne said, “Don’t treat Michael as a good person.”
