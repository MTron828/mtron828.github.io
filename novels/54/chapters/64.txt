Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the phone, Jeanne’s gentle voice was heard. “Didn’t you just come back from a business trip? Why aren’t you resting earlier?”

“I just got off the plane and am on my way home.” Monica was easily led astray.

“You came back so late?”

“It’s all because my dad isn’t in good health. If there’s a business trip, I have to go. A flower like me will be crippled by my father sooner or later,” Monica complained.

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

She felt that it was a happy thing to have Monica by her side.

The two of them chatted for a long time.

Monica said, “I’m at the garage. Let’s talk tomorrow.”

“Rest early.”

“Okay.” Monica hung up the phone.

The car was parked properly.

After the driver opened the car door for Monica, he took out her luggage and sent it into the elevator.

“Thank you for your hard work,” Monica said gently to the chauffeur.

The chauffeur said respectfully, “Take care, Ms. Cardellini.”

Monica nodded.

When the elevator closed, Monica looked at the number on the elevator.

‘It’s midnight. Finn, that b*sstard, should be asleep by now!’

The elevator arrived at her floor.

Monica pushed the huge suitcase out.

After pressing on the fingerprint lock, she found that the house was indeed quiet.

She knew that Finn must be asleep.

Well, Finn had always been a disciplined person. He would go to bed before 11:00 pm, and there was no reason for him not to sleep. Moreover, he did not know that Monica would be back today.

Every time Monica went on a business trip, whether it was before she left, returned, or the few days she was gone, the two of them would never have any contact.

‘How could such a marriage... be considered a marriage?’

‘We should just end it as soon as possible!’

Monica thought fiercely while she pushed her luggage back to her room quietly, trying her best not to disturb anyone.

She went back to her bedroom and opened her luggage to take out some necessities.

The moment she opened her luggage, her eyes paused.

When Monica saw a leather belt overseas, she felt that it was very suitable for Finn. It was simple and low-key. In short, at first glance, she felt that it was very compatible with that b*stard. Monica guessed that Finn’s birthday would be in a few days, so she bought it as a birthday present. It was not very expensive anyway.

Monica hesitated for a moment before picking it up and walking out of the room. Then, she walked to Finn’s bedroom and knocked on the door.

For some reason, she felt a little excited.

Monica took a deep breath to make herself look normal.

She had even thought of how to give it to Finn so that they would not be embarrassed..

The door suddenly opened.

Monica was about to hand over the gift box when her hand stiffened, and her eyes froze.

It was not Finn who opened the door, but Finn’s old lover... Patsy Larson.

Patsy looked at Monica in her pajamas and asked, “Looking for Finn?”

Monica came back to her senses.

Then, she smiled naturally. “It’s nothing much.”

Patsy looked straight at her.

Monica said, “I just wanted to let him know that I’m back. Of course, you can pretend that I don’t exist.”

Then, Monica turned around and left.

At that moment, Finn walked out of the room and looked at Monica, who had left.

Patsy said, “She just wanted to let you know that she’s back.”

Finn nodded slightly.

“Finn,” Patsy called out to him, “I’m sleepy. Can I sleep now?”

“The bed is made. Go to sleep.”

“Okay.” Patsy turned around and went to sleep on the big bed.

Finn looked in the direction of the door and slowly walked out.

Monica had returned to her room. The next second, she heard a knock on the door.

She opened the door and saw Finn standing at the door.

Monica’s lips curled up. “Did I disturb you?”

Finn frowned.

“If you knew your old lover was coming, you should’ve told me beforehand. I would’ve come back a few days later or stayed in a hotel. It would’ve been awkward for me to disturb you like this,” Monica said calmly.

“Why were you looking for me?” Finn did not seem to hear what she said and cut to the chase.

“Didn’t I tell your old lover? I just wanted to tell you that I’m back.”

Finn looked at the gift box on Monica’s bed.

Monica was holding the box when she left.

She followed Finn’s line of sight.

Finn opened his mouth, but he did not say anything.

Monica’s phone rang.

She picked up the phone, and the name “Michael” flashed on the screen.

It was obvious, so Finn saw it too.

Monica picked up the call. “Michael.”

“Are you home?” Michael’s gentle voice was heard coming from the other end. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As it was a quiet night, Finn heard it even though the speaker was not on.

“I just got home.”

“It’s good that you’re home safely. Rest early.”

“Okay,” Monica replied and asked, “By the way, are you free tomorrow?”

“Yes,” Michale responded without asking anything.

Monica chuckled. That sincere smile came from the depths of her heart. “When I was on a business trip, I saw a gift that suited you. I’ll bring it to you tomorrow...”

“Bam.” The door was slammed.

Monica was shocked.

‘Finn, are you f*cking crazy?!’

“What was that sound?” Michael asked from the other side.

“I-it’s nothing. I closed the door too hard just now,” Monica said quickly.

“As long as you’re fine.”

“I’ve been on the plane for more than ten hours. I’m a little sleepy.”

“Then sleep early. See you tomorrow.”

“See you tomorrow.” Monica hung up the phone.

She put down the phone and felt a strange feeling in her heart.

She took a deep breath. She was big-hearted anyway!

Otherwise, she would not have gotten into a marriage of convenience with her ex-boyfriend and become friends with him again.

She always felt that she would never be able to find a good man in this life!

If that was the case, so be it!

…

In the Swan family’s manor, in Bamboo Garden.

At 2:00 am, Nox was summoned over.

Nox broke down and looked at the culprit leaning against his bed, leisurely looking at his phone.

He asked, “Edward, can you not be crazy all the time? You don’t have a woman to spend the night with, but I do. Do you know how terrible it is to leave right after doing the deed with someone?!”

“Are you not terrible to sleep with a different woman every day then?!” Edward raised his eyebrow.

“...” Nox had no strength to retort. He said in a flustered and exasperated manner, “I know what you want. Luckily, I made preparations before I went to bed.”

Edward glanced at Nox expressionlessly.

Nox took out his phone and looked at the information that was sent over. “West is the CEO and the largest shareholder of MUK. He’s responsible for the operation of the entire MUK market. West is a very talented person. He started from scratch and has made it to where he is now. He has a great influence in the international e-commerce industry and is now known as the godfather of e-commerce...”

Edward glanced at Nox again.

Nox pursed his lips, “Alright, I’ll pick the key points. Ms. Lawrence worked at MUK two years ago. From being an ordinary employee, she climbed to the position of marketing director. West was very appreciative of her, so he took her as his goddaughter. Not long ago, a week before her return, which was also when the Lawrences asked her to come back, she suddenly and unilaterally quit her job at MUK and returned to South Hampton City without West’s consent. According to the investigation, Ms. Lawrence and West were just subordinates who admired each other. Don’t worry, you weren’t cuckolded.”
