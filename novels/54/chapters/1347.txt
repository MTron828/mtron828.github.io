1348 Parting On Good Terms and Breaking Up In The End

It was probably because they had not seen each other for so many years, so it was a little surprising for them to see each other out of the blue.

“She’s changed a lot. I almost didn’t recognize her.” Monica recalled the scene of her meeting Shelly yesterday… No, to be precise, it was this morning.

“And?” Nox was calm.

“And…” Monica said, “You can find out for yourself.”

“Why should I?” Nox was speechless. “I don’t want her to come back and ruin my relationship!”

“You think too highly of yourself.”

If she wanted to destroy it, she would have done so long ago.

In fact, she felt that Shelly was avoiding Nox now. Otherwise, the single mother would not have to live such a hard life. Even if the child was not Nox’s child, the Winters would take her of her and the child if she asked. However, she chose to be alone, which could only mean that she really wanted to cut ties with the Winters.

Nox was about to refute Monica when the curtains of the changing room opened and Candice appeared in front of them in her gorgeous wedding dress.

The two of them instantly looked at Candice.

When she first saw the wedding dress, she felt that it was noble but had nothing special about it. However, Candice’s temperament added a lot of character to the wedding dress.

With the white wedding dress with silver embellishments and a long tail on, she looked like a queen who ruled the world.

“Does it look good?” Candice asked them.

Monica nodded unconsciously.

She had to admit that even after all these years, that sc*mbag Edward still had some taste. Just his taste in choosing a wife was top-notch.

Jeanne was definitely the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. Even though Susan’s facial features were not as stunning, she carried herself elegantly.

Candice, on the other hand, was considered above average, but it was maybe because they did not have high expectations for her that she always surprised them.

Monica even felt that the wedding dress was tailor-made for Candice.

In reality, the wedding dresses of the wives of the previous Leaders of Harken were all traditional-looking, with only minor modifications.

Yet, at that moment, Candice was wearing it as if it was specially designed for her, and it looked stunning on her.

“It looks good,” Nox also commented.

“Thank you.” Candice smiled.

“It’s just it doesn’t wow me as much as the dress Jeanne wore back then,” Nox added.

Monica turned to look at Nox.

She really admired that guy for touching a sore spot.

Nox only realized what he said after he said it. When he looked at Candice earlier, he somehow thought of Jeanne and made a simple comparison in his heart.

Then… he said it out loud

“I-I-I…” Nox stuttered.

Even if he wanted to, he could not clear his name at that moment.

“It’s alright.” Candice did not seem to mind. On the contrary, she seemed very magnanimous. “I heard that Jeanne was Edward’s most beloved woman.”

“That’s all in the past. Don’t take it to heart.” Nox tried to smooth things over.

He thought that if Edward knew what he said, he would probably be beaten to death.

“I don’t.” Candice smiled. “Since I’m going to marry Edward, I have to accept his past.”

“There’s no need to take it to heart,” Monica also said.

Candice looked at Monica.

Monica said bluntly, “If he loved her the most, he wouldn’t have let her go so quickly. At the end of the day, he didn’t really love her, so there’s no need to be jealous.”

Her words were clearly not meant to ease the atmosphere. It was an attack on Edward.

Candice understood. Moreover, she already knew that Monica and Jeanne were best friends. If not for the fact that she had an inexplicable affinity with Monica, she did not think that she would become friends with Monica.

“Who says he didn’t love her very much?” Nox retorted. He was unhappy that Monica was denying Edward’s feelings. “You don’t even know how Jeanne died, yet you’re jumping to conclusions.”

“Does it matter how she died? What’s important is that she’s dead and Edward is living a better life than anyone else.” Monica sneered, “It really proves the saying.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Nox frowned.

“That men can do anything to get rich and gain power, including using his dead wife.”

Edward was not far from them and heard them talking about him.
