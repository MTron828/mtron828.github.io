Chapter 677: What Right Do You Have to Say You Love Me?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

If Monica could convince her that Michael was a good person, she would try her best to help her get Finn back. However, if Michael had ulterior motives, what reason did she have to convince Finn to wait for Monica unconditionally?

Humans could not be selfish.

“Well, wait for my good news today,” Monica cheered herself up.

Jeanne reminded her, “Don’t sleep with Dr. Jones for real. He won’t accept you now.”

“Uh... Okay,” Monica reluctantly agreed.

Then, she hung up the phone and took a deep breath.

She actually had not thought about what to do! However, she had to give it her all, no matter what.

Even if Finn hated her to the core, she had to make him understand why she was doing all that!

…

Similarly, Michael also had insomnia for the entire night, thinking about how to make Monica give up on Finn completely.

He thought of many ways until one cruel way popped up in his mind.

He wanted to make Monica wake up and understand that she and Finn had become a thing of the past — that it was no longer possible for them.

With that, he ate his breakfast slowly and made a call unhurriedly. He was making some arrangements. “Have you bribed any of Sarah’s friends?”

“Yes, Mr. Ross.” The person on the other end of the phone replied respectfully, “Sarah has a few good friends, and we’ve successfully bribed two of them in the past two days. Other than Shelly Carter, all of Sarah’s friends are very supportive of her pursuit of Finn. Moreover, everyone knows that Sarah likes Finn very much and for many years at that, but because he was her brother-in-law, her feelings for him were unrequired. Now that Finn has finally divorced her cousin, she is very determined to pursue Finn.”

“Proceed according to the plan.”

“Roger that!” the other party replied.

Michael’s lips curled into a cold smile. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After today, Monica would belong to him and him only! Whether it was in his career or his relationship, he would never accept failure.

…

Monica put on her makeup and changed into her clothes. After making sure that she looked her best, she left the house.

In the taxi, her heart was beating very fast.

In fact, she was not going to see Finn now because it was still too early!

Hence, Jeannie had instructed her to do some things to test Michael.

She went to the mall to look for some lingerie and spent quite some time picking them out seriously, thinking perhaps it would be useful tonight.

She fell in love with a sexy bra with leopard patterns, which she thought looked sexy.

She remembered that one time Jeanne was feeling unwell, so she came to their home. That night, she had to sleep on the same bed as Finn, and he seemed to like that style very much.

At that thought, she took a deep breath to calm herself down. It was uncertain whether she could seduce them or not, so why was she so excited about it?

In the end, she picked out several sets of lingerie and bought two sexy halter-neck silk dresses.

She had never tried them out before, but having watched those certain films, she had a million postures and poses under her sleeves.

When she left the lingerie store, she called Michael, who was in the quality inspection department.

He looked at the incoming call and adjusted his tone quickly. “Monica.”

Monica found that Michael sounded very gentle every time he called her name.

She felt she was judging a good person unfairly by doing everything she was doing now.

However, Jeannie was right. Everything she was doing was to prove Michael’s innocence, and she was helping Michael.

At that thought, she did not worry anymore. She said, “What kind of lingerie do you men like?”

“Hm?”

“It’s just that...” Monica’s face was still a little red. “I’m planning to go and see Finn tonight, am I not? So, I’ve bought quite a few sets of lingerie, but I don’t know what kind you guys like. Should I take a photo of it for you to see? Can you help me choose one?”

“Sure,” the person on the other end of the call agreed immediately.

“I’ll take a photo of it when I get home.”

“Okay.”

Monica hung up the phone.

It seemed Michael had no intention of stopping her at all. However, unbeknownst to her, Michael’s expression was terrifying at that moment.

When she got home, she sent the picture of the lingerie she bought to Michael.

Then, she rang him up. “Which one do you think he likes better?”

“From a man’s point of view.” Michael was seriously giving her advice. “I think the leopard print one will be irresistible to every man.”
