1151 The War Has Started: Edward’s True Identity Is Exposed

“Monica is still unconscious,” Kennedy said bluntly.

Finn’s suppressed emotions seemed to surface again.

Kennedy said, “Finn, do you still remember what I told you?”

Finn looked at him.

“As a doctor, as an outstanding doctor, it’s best to have no feelings. Once you have feelings for people or things, it’s easy for you to make mistakes during the surgery. I’ve always thought that you’re the same as me, that you’re not an emotional person. I didn’t expect that you’d change so much because of Monica.” He seemed to be a little regretful.

To Kennedy, Finn was his only disciple, and he was very satisfied with Finn.

He turned 60 years old this year, so in terms of surgery, he had naturally passed his Golden Age.

Now, he just wanted Finn to inherit his legacies. However, he did not expect Finn to stray further and further away from his teaching after all these years.

At the end of the day, he was not Finn’s parents. As Finn’s teacher, all he could do was guide and not force Finn.

At most, it would just be a pity.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you.” Finn did not refute.

He admitted his feelings for Monica.

He had forced himself to let it go, but whenever something happened to Monica, it would instantly reignite his feelings for her.

In this life, no matter what happened between them, no matter how unworthy he felt Monica was of him, he could not control his feelings.

“That’s your business.” Kennedy sighed.

He thought it was a pity but was also very calm about it. He had always known that everyone had their own path to choose.

He said, “Rest.”

Kennedy was about to leave Finn’s room when Finn called out to him, “Master.”

Kennedy turned around and looked at him.

“Can I leave?” Finn asked.

He wanted to leave and see Monica so that he would be the only person Monica would see when she opened her eyes.

Even if she did not open his eyes, he wanted to be by her side forever.

“What do you think?” Kennedy raised his eyebrows. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Finn’s throat moved slightly. “What if I insist on leaving?”

“You can choose to let me transport your body out.” Kennedy gave him the only answer.

Finn’s eyes were cold.

“Don’t resist.” Kennedy reminded him, “It won’t end well for you.”

With that, he stopped wasting his breath. After all, Finn knew everything, but in the end, it was his choice.

Kennedy opened the door, and at that moment, his body froze. However, he then said respectfully, “Sir.”

Finn turned around and saw Alex at the door. He did not expect Alex to come here personally.

That place was probably… the Duncans’ secret base.

He had heard that the Duncans had a secret residence in South Hampton City that no ordinary people could find and that it was heavily guarded. Of course, it was not the same as the one that was discovered by the Sanders last time. Alex should be staying someplace else, which even Edward might not know the exact location of.

“Thank you, Uncle Kennedy.” Alex appeared to be very respectful.

It was an instinctive reaction when it came to social interaction that he had been trained on for many years — to be like a machine without any emotions.

Kennedy nodded before he walked out of the room. He knew that Alex and Finn had something to talk about.

The door was closed again, leaving only Alex and Finn in the room.

To be honest, only very few people could be alone in the same room as Alex.

Alex said, “I didn’t want to use such a method to bring you back either.”

Finn did not reply.

“As for me, the greatest mercy I could give you was to leave you enough time to save Monica.” Alex enunciated his words clearly. “That was my limit.”

In other words, if he continued to resist, Alex would not show him mercy.

Finn clenched his fists and tried hard to hold his emotions in as he knew very well that he could not resist Alex.

“Where’s George?” Alex changed the topic.

As expected, Alex would not be so kind as to comfort him and tell him why he had been brought to this place. He was doing so only because he had not found George.

At that moment, Finn could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, he had thought of it earlier than Alex. Otherwise, George would have been brought back by Alex by now.
