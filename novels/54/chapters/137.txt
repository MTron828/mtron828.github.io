Chapter 138: Reversal. The Struggle to Death

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Micheal hung up the phone.

His expression was cold.

Eden, as expected, was still lacking.

He picked up the phone and dialed again. “Melody.”

“Eden is going to kill me someday.”

“At the moment, he’s the best person we can use in the business world. Don’t touch him for the time being.”

“I know, I just...” Melody Sanders was so angry that she could not speak.

“Don’t worry, I have an idea,” Micheal said.

“What idea?”

Micheal told Melody his idea.

Melody Sanders calmed down a little. “Okay, I will make the arrangements.”

“Okay.”

“Micheal, let me tell you the truth. Eden is really incomparable to you. No wonder my father placed you in such an important position.”

“It’s my honor to work for him.”

“It’s a pity that we don’t have any feelings for each other. Otherwise, compared to Edward, you might be more suitable for our family.”

“No, don’t look down on Fourth Master Swan. His ability is beyond our imagination.”

“How do you know?” Melody Sanders was surprised.

Micheal was clearly around the same age as her, but for someone in his twenties, she always felt that he was able to see through everything.

“I guessed.” Micheal chuckled. “After all, the Swan Enterprise is so big. How easy can it be for Fourth Master Swan to control everything in such a short time?”

“That’s true.” Melody Sanders nodded.

“If Fourth Master Swan can really become a part of the Sanders, not only will you be able to stabilize your position, but you will also have one less threat.”

“This is the reason why my father insisted that I marry Edward.”

“Alright, let’s not talk anymore. You go ahead and arrange things first. We can’t let the news continue to spread like this. The longer it takes, the more disadvantageous it will be for the Sanders.”

“Okay.”

Melody Sanders quickly hung up the phone.

Micheal also put down his phone.

His eyes narrowed.

Jeanne Lawrence... was indeed a threat.

…

The video of Jeanne’s speech went viral on the internet.

The popularity did not decrease.

4 pm in the afternoon.

The Sanders’ South Hampton City Administrative Hall held a live reception.

While all the news media platforms avoided the Lawrence Enterprise, the administrative hall was crowded with them.

The scene was packed with the media and it appeared to be very lively.

At this moment, Jeanne was also sitting in her office, watching the situation at the scene.

Currently, the spokesperson of the government had yet to arrive, but they had already started the live broadcast on the Internet.

Jeanne was still very calm.

Forrest sat opposite her. He was initially extremely nervous. After all, no one knew what the Sanders would say. Furthermore, the live broadcast was all over the internet. It was obvious that the Sanders had a plan in mind. Everyone would be afraid of something happening, but when he saw Director Lawrence’s expression, he became calm.

He had a feeling that everything was within her expectations.

She expected the Sanders to respond. She was only waiting for their moves. Then, she would counter their moves and finally give them a fatal blow.

Ten minutes.

The spokesperson of the Executive Office, Tiffany Larson, personally responded. She was also the main person in charge of the project.

After a lengthy greeting, she stated the main point, “Regarding the Lawrence Enterprise’s allegations about the planning of the amusement park, I admit our mistake. We have indeed brought losses to the Lawrence Enterprise due to our lack of consideration. This is my responsibility. I will not push the blame. In front of the entire country’s people, I will express my apologies to the Lawrence Enterprise.”

The sudden words caused an uproar at the scene.

However, since it was not a question-and-answer session, the reporters below did not dare to stir up trouble.

“Before I come up with a compensation plan for the Lawrence Enterprise, I will first explain to everyone why we have developed the amusement park project. As we all know, Harken is a rapidly developing country. From agriculture to entertainment and internet industries, all of them are bearing fruit. Taking advantage of the current development environment, we are also planning more projects that can boost the national economy, and the construction of a global amusement park is one of them. I hereby declare that this project is not a spur-of-the-moment initiative. It has already been planned for three years. This is one of our planning documents, and it was signed three years ago today.”

As she spoke, she handed a copy of the document to the reporter’s representative at the scene.

Tiffany Larson continued to speak, “It’s just that the plan in the plan has not been made public for the time being. When we confirmed the implementation of the plan, in fact, it was also before the construction of Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse. I admit that our negligence lies in that we only focused on the planning and construction of the amusement park, and neglected to pay attention to the development of other industries. This resulted in the Lawrence Enterprise mistakenly choosing the location of the logistics warehouse in our planned area.”

Obviously, in the Sanders’ official statement, they wanted to erase the fact that they are targeting the Lawrences.

It was only carelessness that led to this misunderstanding.

At the very least, the general public would not feel that the Sanders were abusing their power.

“We are also very sorry for the losses caused to the Lawrence Enterprise, but looking at the bigger picture, the economic benefits that the construction of the amusement project will bring to South Hampton City are far greater than the construction of the logistics warehouse of the Lawrence Enterprise. If we stop the development of the project now, the preliminary estimate of the financial loss will be five billion. We will also lose the potential economic benefits it can bring, which are tens of billions. This logistics warehouse of the Lawrence Enterprise can not be compared to the economic benefit the amusement park will bring. After weighing it, we decided to continue the construction of the amusement park project, and at the same time, help the Lawrence Enterprise to tide over its current corporate difficulties.”

So.

This was the Sanders’ way of saying things.

They admitted their mistakes, but they would not undo their mistakes. However, they could try their best to make up for their mistakes.

In the eyes of the outside world, it was very sincere, and there was no contradiction.

This statement instantly turned the Sanders’ passive situation around.

Jeanne looked at the news coldly.

She felt that she had watched enough.

Jeanne could already figure out what kind of compensation plans they would provide.

They would most likely cooperate with the Lawrence Enterprise to find new land and make a new plan. They would also reduce the tax revenue from the Lawrence Enterprise by one percentage point, at the same time providing more business loans to them, and so on.

This was the usual method used by the authorities. They would let you think that you had gotten a great deal.

In reality.

When it comes to choosing a new location, there would then be many unexpected incidents.

For example, there would be no suitable location. Even if there was a reasonable location, there would be many households or buildings there which would be difficult to demolish.

Jeanne could already foresee a large number of problems in their compensation plans.

And at that time, even if the Lawrences try to make another statement, the Sanders will have ten thousand excuses. They will say that the Sanders have actively cooperated and tried their best. They did not expect such a sudden accident. Harken is a humane and civilized country. When it comes to demolition, they can only use reason to convince people and not be forceful…

In the worst-case scenario, they can just apologize to the Lawrences a few more times in the media. They will not suffer even one bit by doing that.

The most important thing was that a piece of news would be popular for at most a week, or at most a month. The more people watched, the more numb they would become. It would gradually become a piece of history and no one would care about it.

“Director Lawrence.” Forrest looked at Jeanne’s sudden silence and called out to her.

Others might be convinced by the Sander’s official statement, but those who truly knew the urgency of this project would not.

Right now, the government was deliberately stabilizing the situation. In reality, time is sometimes the biggest weapon of destruction for an enterprise.

Once they missed the best time, opportunities would slip through their fingers.

“What do we do now?” Forrest asked.

Although they knew that the Sanders was doing this on purpose, they did not know how to deal with it either.

After all, the Sanders had already said so much. If the Lawrences were to be more aggressive, it would seem that they did not understand the bigger picture. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne said, “When the Executive Office’s press conference is over, we will issue a statement.”

“What do we say?”

“Thank you for the Sander’s support. We completely trust that the Sanders can help the Lawrence Enterprise through the difficult times. At the same time, we will fully cooperate with the construction of the amusement park project by the South Hampton City Administration Office.”

Forrest really did not think that Director Lawrence was someone who would compromise so easily.

He also did not believe his own ears.

Jeanne smiled. “Since they are standing on the side of benevolence and righteousness, so we will go along with them.”

Forrest still... could not understand.

“This way, we’ll be able to tear down their platform and make them... have no way out.”

“...” Forrest was shocked. After a long while, he asked, “Director Lawrence?has a new strategy already?”

Jeanne did not answer.

Her smile was very obvious.

Forrest simply could not describe his emotions and admiration.

He just could not understand.

How much energy could Director Lawrence contain in her slender body?

Everyone was just struggling to their deaths in front of her.
