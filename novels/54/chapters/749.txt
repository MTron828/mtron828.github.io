Chapter 750: Monica and Michael’s Conflict

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne expected her life to be quite turbulent, but it was surprisingly peaceful.

A month passed and nothing earth-shattering happened.

Edward, Jeanne, and George lived under the same roof as a family of three, even though George was only agreeable to the word “three” and not “family”. But this did not affect the warm, harmonious lives between the trio. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everything in the Lawrence Enterprise was currently under Jeanne’s control.

Eden Swan took the initiative to resign from Lawrence Enterprise. When he left, he did not cause too much of a stir. He only announced the reason for his departure in his personal social media account where he said that Jeanne had the ability to manage Lawrence Enterprise herself, and that he hoped that she could have more room to perform which was why he chose to leave Lawrence Enterprise to her, and that if Lawrence Enterprise encountered any trouble in the future, he would be duty-bound to help immediately.

Eden Swan played the role of a perfect gentleman to the public eye.

It will be all the more painful when it was time for his downfall.

Eitherway, Jeanne had no time to bother with the likes of Eden. She needed to find a way to deal with Joshua Lawrence and Jennifer Fabian.

It was impossible for this mother and son duo to behave themselves.

They’ve been quiet for the past month. Either they hadn’t thought of a scheme to harm Jeanne, or they’re trying to hatch a bigger one. In that case, why not strike first?

Jeanne sat in the president’s office and listened to Amy’s report.

After a long while, Jeanne put down her coffee and asked, “Has Chairman Lawrence made any moves lately?”

“Nothing,” Amy replied. “Occasionally, he interferes with some of our decisions and gives his personal opinions, but most senior management doesn’t answer to him, so it’s as good as he’s talking to himself.”

Jeanne nodded slightly.

Now that she had complete control over Lawrence Enterprise, any company decision would only take effect if she signed it. Joshua Lawrence’s power had long gone.

Jeanne continued sipping her coffee.

Now that Lawrence Enterprise was on the right track, there was no need to work overtime anymore.

It was purely out of habit.

Jeanne didn’t want to be home too early as she didn’t want to spend too much time under the same roof as Edward Swan.

She was afraid that she would sink deeper and deeper into his world.

“But during this period of time, I saw that Chairman Lawrence had the intention to get close to Director Sanders,” Amy suddenly said.

Jeanne paused.

“I’ve seen him take the initiative to talk to Director Sanders a few times, but Director Sanders always shook him off.”

So… Was Joshua Lawrence trying to build an alliance with Quinn Sanders?

Was he that stupid?!

Wait.

Jeanne’s eyes tightened.

Although Joshua had always wanted to kick her out of the Lawrences, he couldn’t be so ambitious. It wasn’t just Joshua Lawrence, even Jenifer Fabian’s ambition wasn’t that big that they would dare provoke the Sanders. Could it be...

She said, “Is Director Sanders off duty yet?”

“I don’t think so.” Amy looked at the door. “I originally thought that Director Sanders was just here to gain some work experience, but I didn’t expect her to be so responsible for her work. She often works overtime until eight or nine o’clock before leaving. The PR department she’s in charge of is also very orderly. She often led the negotiations with many companies and she doesn’t put on airs. When she’s out for work discussions, she takes the initiative to drink and socialize.”

“I know.” Jeanne nodded.

Jeanne knew of Quinn’s performance at the Lawrence Enterprise.

“Many companies rejected Director Sanders previously. It was their loss.” Amy proudly said.

Jeanne smiled.

Whether it was a blessing or a curse, no one would know till the end.

Jeanne put down her coffee and rose from her seat.

“Are you leaving work now, Director?”

“Yeap, you can leave now.”

“Understood.” Amy said excitedly.

It was rare for her to be able to leave at seven o’clock.

Jeanne left and headed to Quinn Sanders’s office.

She knocked.

“Come in.”

Sure enough, Quinn was still here.

Jeanne pushed open the door.

Quinn saw Jeanne and she stood up. “Director Lawrence.”

“It’s late. You’re still working?”

“There’s a training plan tomorrow for the public relations department. I think there’s some content that needs to be modified, so I’ve not gone off work yet.”

“Good work.”

“It’s my job.” Quinn was neither servile nor overbearing.

It wouldn’t make one feel that she was unapproachable, but it wouldn’t make one feel that she was easy to get along with either.

She was a talented woman with her own principles.
