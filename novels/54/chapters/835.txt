Chapter 836 Successful Escape: Letting Go To Stay Alive

Since it was up to Michael, Monica would make him dump her first.

After dying once…

After really dying once, Monica felt that she understood a lot more.

She understood things better now. When one could not fight the other head-on, one should find other ways to do it.

Monica would never joke around with her life again.

…

At night, in Harken.

Finn and Nox brought Edward back to South Hampton City, back to Bamboo Garden.

Edward was severely injured.

He was almost always passed out throughout the flight back.

At this moment, he was still unconscious on the bed.

Finn treated his wounds again.

Previously, Finn could only perform a simple operation on the helicopter. Now, he had to do it all over again.

Finn put an oxygen mask on Edward and gave him nutritional fluid. This time, he gave him an anesthetic shot and re-operated on his wounds.

The whole process took a long time.

Fortunately...

Edward’s injuries were severe, but his life was not in danger.

After resting for about half a month, he should be able to barely recover.

Finn tidied up the medical kit. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Nox accompanied him from the beginning to the end. He looked at the numerous wounds on Fourth Master Swan’s body.

“Are you done?” Nox asked after seeing Finn’s actions.

Finn nodded. “It’ll be up to his recovery now.”

Nox responded.

“It’s getting late. You should go and rest for a while,” Nox spoke.

Finn glanced at Edward.

“I’ll keep an eye on him.” Nox knew what he was worried about. “You’re the doctor. If you don’t take care of yourself, how are you going to treat him?”

Finn did not refuse anymore. “Then I’ll go to the next room to sleep for a while. If there’s anything unusual about him, call me.

“Alright,” Nox said.

“How’s your body?” Finn could not help but ask in concern when he left.

“It’s alright,” Nox answered.

Finn opened the door and left.

Just as he walked out, he saw a small person standing in front of him.

As the person was really short, he had to look up to see Finn.

“How is Fourth Master Swan?” George asked.

It was probably past 1:00 am at the moment.

From the time they returned until now, Finn had spent almost four hours treating Edward’s wounds, yet George was still awake?

Finn squatted down to look at George at eye level. He said, “He’s alive.”

“Oh.” George nodded like an adult. “That’s good.”

“You can’t bear to see him die?” The corners of Finn’s mouth lifted slightly as he tried to give George some warmth.

Even a cold person like Finn felt that George was a little pitiful.

Given that he had such parents, he would suffer the most as their child.

Finn did not even dare to mention Jeanne in front of George.

He was afraid that George would ask more questions.

He was afraid that George would overthink.

He was also afraid that he would not lie.

“He’s my dad, after all,” George said, “It was hard for me to have a dad.”

“…”

It was hard…

It was indeed hard for George.

When he was six years old, he had always thought that his father was dead.

Now, he finally had one.

Even though it was not what he had expected.

However, it was better than nothing.

Finn touched George’s head. “Go and rest. Your dad’s body is very weak now, so he needs to rest well. You can see him when he wakes up tomorrow.’

“Alright.” George nodded obediently.

He obediently left Finn’s side and did not ask anything else.

He did not ask about his mother, Jeanne.

Finn did not know if George forgot…

Or that he knew a lot for being too mature for his age.

Finn got up and walked into another room.

After two days of running around, anyone would be tired.

Finn took a shower and lay on the bed, but he felt a little sleepless. Perhaps he was not used to sleeping in another place.

He took out his phone and opened WhatsApp.

Then, he looked at all the messages he had missed in a group chat.

He saw: [Monica seems to have been discharged from the hospital.]

[I wonder why she committed suicide.]

[I heard that it was for love?]

[Isn’t she going to get married to Director Ross? What’s the matter?]

[They say that she quarreled with the director and couldn’t think straight.]

[Director Ross is so nice to her. What was she thinking? Why was she born with such a good life? Not to mention Director Ross, even Dr. Jones treated her so well. She shouldn’t be so pretentious.]

[...I think Dr. Jones is in the group.]

Perhaps they were rushing off to work after that.

Many messages were unsent after that.
