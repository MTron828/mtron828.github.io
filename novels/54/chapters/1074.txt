1075 Going To Court: Brie Appears and Exposes Michael

He nodded. “Permission granted.”

Brie said to everyone in the court, “Daniel Cook said that I had an affair with him. However, I can tell everyone confidently that Michael was the only person I’ve ever loved in my life, and he is the only man I’ve slept with.”

“How can you prove yourself?” Judah stood up.

Based on the situation just now, he was keenly aware that there was more to be dug out in this case.

Brie turned to look at Daniel. “You said that I slept with you, right?”

“Yes. You seduced me!” Daniel could only continue to cover up his lie, hoping that there would still be a chance to turn things around.

“In that case, where is my birthmark?” Brie asked him.

Daniel was stunned.

“Since you’ve slept with me, you should have seen my body. So, where is the birthmark on my body?” Brie questioned loudly.

Daniel raised his head and glanced at Michael while everyone looked at Daniel.

Monica also noticed his actions at that moment and exposed him. “Why? Do you need Michael to give you a hint?”

As soon as he said that, everyone’s attention was fixed on Daniel’s gaze.

Daniel did not dare to look over again. Hence, he could only bite the bullet and say, “There’s one on your butt!”

Brie smiled and said coldly, “I don’t have any on me.”

Daniel began to panic.

Then, Brie said to the judge, “You can verify it, Your Honor.”

The judge nodded and asked the staff to take Brie out of the court.

Soon, the staff handed the results to the judge and the jury.

The judge said, “Brie doesn’t have a birthmark!”

Daniel’s face turned pale with fear.

Brie returned to her seat and said, “That’s enough to prove that Daniel and I aren’t having an affair. He’s just making everything up!”

“This also shows means that there’s a huge problem with Daniel Cook’s confession, and it cannot be used as the evidence of this court,” Judah said his piece.

The judge had no choice but to nod.

“Your Honor, I have a question for Brie.” Judah requested.

However, the judge did not agree immediately.

“Since there’s a problem with the case now, I have to reopen the case on my client’s behalf.” Judah was firm with his decision.

The judge hesitated for a few seconds before nodding.

The moment he nodded, he said a few words to the assistant beside him, and the assistant left.

Edward and Nox, who were in the audience, saw the judge’s actions clearly. After all, everyone’s attention was on Brie, so the rest did not notice.

Nox said, “The judge is reporting to his superiors.”

Edward nodded.

“However, it’s useless. I’ve just confirmed that your son has posted the video of this court session on the internet, and there are many people watching it. The Sanders are afraid of causing a public outcry, so they won’t dare to let the judge end the trial.”

“Michael has been around for too long,” Edward said coldly.

To the Swans, Michael should have been dead long ago.

If Jeanne had not made the first move, Edward would have done the same.

In fact, if Monica could not turn things around after Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s crisis, Edward would also lend a helping hand.

After all, the fall of the Cardellini Pharmaceutical company and the Sanders’ control of Harken’s pharmaceutical market would not benefit the Swans at all; it might even be a threat, and the Swans would not let the Sanders succeed.

The reason why Edward had not made his move was that he did not want to go against the Sanders too early. Alex Duncan needed time, so he could not act rashly. Therefore, he would not take the initiative to go against the Sanders until the last moment.

Fortunately, Monica was not as weak as he thought. He was really surprised that she could hold on until now.

His eyes moved slightly as he continued to look at everything in the scene coldly.

At that moment, Judah faced Brie and began to ask, “Ms. Larson, you said that you object to Daniel’s accusation of you being the mastermind. May I ask, aren’t you the mastermind behind this incident?”

“No.” Brie was direct. “It’s Michael.”

The crowd sighed again.

Michael suppressed his anger and uncontrollable panic as he glared at Brie. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Is there any evidence that Michael ordered it?”

“There is.” Brie was very certain.

Everyone was looking at Brie in anticipation of a huge twist in the situation.

After all, any normal person would hope for the truth to come to light, and it would be very satisfying!

“Before you answer my question, please be aware that you’re in court. You will bear legal responsibility for every word you say in court,” the judge suddenly interjected. It seemed like a reminder, but in fact, it was a threat.
