1341 Monica, I Don’t Want to Break Up

“It really isn’t,” Shelly explained again when she saw Monica’s disbelieving eyes.

Monica still did not seem to believe her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Helpless, Shelly had no choice but to wake up the little girl who was about to fall asleep again and turn her little face to Monica. “Do you think she looks like Nox?”

Monica looked at the little girl.

It was true that they did not look alike. Although the little girl had big bright eyes, she looked average overall. She did not look outstanding, and if she were to look more like Nox, she would be cuter.

“So, she really isn’t Nox’s child. Don’t overthink it.” Shelly seemed to be afraid that Monica would misunderstand, so she had been trying to make it clear that the child was not Nox’s.

“I heard that children might only inherit one parent’s genes and not the other. For example, I look like my father but not my mother.” Monica continued to say.

After all, the timing was perfect.

Shelly felt a little helpless and did not seem to know how to explain the situation.

Monica looked at Shelly’s expression and could not help but laugh. “It seems like I’m overthinking it. It’s just that when I see a single mother, I always think of… a melodramatic scene.”

Shelly nodded as she, too, understood where Monica was coming from.

At that moment, Monica suddenly thought of something, “Could it be that a man is sleeping in that room?”

Even Monica got excited when she said it.

That was right. If Shelly married another man and had a child with him, Monica could imagine how dark Nox’s face would be.

After all, no man could accept such a thing happening even if they did not like a woman, because that was a matter of a man’s price.

Shelly shook her head. “Nope.”

It was hard not to be suspicious.

“But it really isn’t Nox’s.” Shelly did not reveal who the girl’s father was, but from her tone, Monica believed that the child was not Nox’s.

Even if it was true and the child was Nox’s, Shelly would not have left, considering how badly she wanted to marry Nox back then.

No matter what, she would have fought for herself. However, Monica heard that she left very calmly back then.

After Nox announced that he had fallen in love with Zoe, Shelly left the Winters. From then on, there was no news of Shelly, and Monica had almost forgotten about Shelly’s existence.

“Monica, I’m bringing Bella back to her room to sleep.” Shelly had already said what she needed to say, and there was no need for further explanation.

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

Then, she watched as Shelly carried the quiet little girl into the room. Ultimately, she was still a little surprised, so she turned to look at Sarah.

When Sarah saw her cousin’s expression, she knew what the latter wanted to ask.

She smiled evilly. “If you don’t tell me what happened between you and Finn, I won’t tell you about Shelly.”

Monica rolled her eyes. If Sarah did not want to say it, it was whatever. She was not that nosy either. With that, Monica walked straight into the bathroom to take a shower.

Sarah looked at the tightly shut door and was very unhappy. She thought, ‘What’s there to hide anyway?”

She sat on the sofa in the living room angrily.

She was woken up by her cousin before she even woke up, and now, she could not fall asleep. Hence, she sat there playing with her phone while waiting for her cousin to take a shower.

By then, Shelly had also coaxed Bei Bei to sleep, changed her clothes, and walked out.

“Sarah, aren’t you going to sleep a little longer?” Shelly asked as she walked out.

“Monica woke me up, and I can’t go back to sleep. I think she must have quarreled with Finn, so I want to know what happened between them.”

“You still can’t let go of Dr. Jones?” Shelly teased.

“I have let go of him, but I was the one who brought them back together again. So, of course, I want to see them happy. Why are they breaking up? To let down my good intentions?” Sarah said unhappily.

Shelly did not say anything else. Instead, she changed into her shoes and prepared to go out.

“Shelly, do you have to work so hard? Won’t you tire yourself out working three shifts a day?” Sarah’s heart ached when she saw it was only 5:30 a.m. and Shelly was already heading out.

“It’s fine. I’ve gotten used to it,” Shelly said nonchalantly. “Look after Bella for me for a while. I’ll be back before 8 a.m. When I’m back, I’ll send her to kindergarten. ”

“Don’t worry. I’ll keep an eye on her for you.”

“Thank you.” Shelly expressed her gratitude.

Then, she opened the door and left.

Sarah looked at Shelly’s back and sighed.
