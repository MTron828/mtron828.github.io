Chapter 1796: The Failed Proposal

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’m sorry, Nox.” Shelly looked at him, feeling guilty.

She thought that she would not feel burdened by anything Nox did. However, when she saw Nox so calm at that moment, she was a little sad. For some reason, she felt that she had hurt him badly.

“It’s alright.” Nox stood up from the ground.

He even had a smile on his face as he said, “In regards to feelings, there’s nothing to be sorry about. It’S either you love the person or not.”

Shelly felt a lump in her throat. She thought Nox looked lonely at this moment, and it made her heart ache. However, she did not go back on her word. She figured she only felt touched and upset at that moment because Nox had created a sad scene for her. Once she walked out of there, those feelings would fade.

She stood up from her chair and said, “Please send me back to the shore.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

With that, he stood up and walked to Shelly’s side. His back was straight, and there was not much emotion on his face, but Shelly felt that Nox was very lonely at that moment.

He walked past the beautifully decorated deck, where Jeanne, Monica, and Bella were standing there, watching. They could not hear what Nox and Shelly were saying from afar, but it was obvious that Nox’s proposal had failed.

Monica could not help but want to ask about the situation, but Jeanne held her back. What was there to ask when Nox was already crying? The more they cared about him, the more his heart would crumble, and he probably did not want Shelly to see him in such a sorry state at that moment.

Nox walked straight to the pilot’s seat. He replaced the staff and drove the cruise ship back to the shore. In the meantime, Jeanne and Monica brought Bella back to Shelly, who was also feeling a little down. As she looked at how romantic everything was set up, she tried hard to suppress the discomfort she was feeling in her heart.

“It’S alright.” Jeanne comforted Monica. “Nothing can be forced. Just stay true to your own feelings.”

Monica glanced at Jeanne and did not think it was not appropriate to say something like that at a time like that. Right now, they should be persuading Shelly instead. After all, Nox really loved her. Although he had made many mistakes in the past, everyone could see his sincerity now.

She said, “Nox actually prepared a lot for tonight. He—”

“Monica.” Jeanne stopped her. “Don’t add to Shelly’s burden. Feelings can’t be forced, and if it’s forced, she will never be happy. Shelly needs to recognize her own feelings. She shouldn’t ruin her happiness because of guilt.”

“But I think Nox—”

“I think Brandon is not bad either. Why did you choose Finn in the end?” Jeanne asked.

At the end of the day, it all boiled down to whether Shelly loved Nox or not. If she did not, no one could force her to love him. As such, Monica did not say anything else. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne gently patted Shelly’s shoulder. “Monica will send you back when we reach the shore later.” “Thank you.” Shelly thanked her sincerely.

At that moment, she was really afraid that they would come and persuade her. She even wanted to escape from the current situation. When the cruise ship returned to shore, Shelly did not see Nox again. Since she had nothing else to say to him, she got off the cruise ship with Monica.

Monica also looked back and did not see Nox. She had wanted to comfort him, but after thinking about it, she knew everything would be fine with Jeanne around. Hence, she sat in the car with Shelly and Bella.

The moment the car drove off, countless fireworks suddenly lit up above the sea. It filled the sky and was as beautiful as a dream.

Shelly was stunned for a moment, and Bella leaned excitedly against the car window. “Wow, it’S so beautiful!.”

Shelly looked at the sky filled with colorful fireworks as well.

“Nox prepared it.” Monica also looked at the sky full of fireworks and said calmly, “He didn’t succeed in proposing, but he still wants to show you the romantic gestures he has prepared for you.”

Shelly pursed her lips and remained silent.

“Jeannie don’t want me to say it, but I think there are some things you should know. At the very least, you should have the right to know.” Monica looked at Shelly and said calmly, “During the nine days that Nox disappeared, he wasn’t dealing with some state secrets but was preparing to propose to you. He knew you wouldn’t agree, but he still wanted to return what he owed you. Back then, you came to the Winters to marry him, but he didn’t give you anything in return. You even miscarried his child. He is well aware of what he has done and that it’s useless to you. He even knows that he isn’t the one you love..”
