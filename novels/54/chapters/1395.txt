1396 Nox and Shelly Meet Again

Finn was not surprised.

Nox mumbled, “I didn’t realize how capable Candice was. Not only is she not as pretty as Jeanne, but she’s only married to Edward for political reasons, so how did Edward fall in love with her? Back then, Susan was really in love with Edward, but he didn’t even glance at her before sending her back to Alex’s side. From then, I thought Edward would be alone for the rest of his life.”

As usual, Finn just listened without giving any explanation.

“Don’t you find it strange?” Nox was bored of being the only one talking.

He knew that a man like Finn needed to be taught a lesson. If Finn was not interested in anything, what was the point of living?

It was time Monica woke him up.

“You’ll know why Fourth Master likes Candice so much in the future.”

“Did Edward say something to you?” Nox got excited.

He could not believe that Edward told Finn but not him.

“You don’t need to know.”

“Finn!” Nox gritted his teeth.

That guy was just so annoying sometimes.

“Is there anything else?” Finn was very calm about Nox’s displeasure with him.

“Is your relationship with Monica better?” Nox asked.

Finn did not answer, and not answering meant that it was not good.

Nox gloated, “Finn, you have to pay for what you’ve done. Beware of Monica cheating on you!”

Finn’s expression turned ugly, and he abruptly hung up the call.

The small victory put Nox in a good mood.

At that moment, someone knocked on the office door.

“Come in.”

Nox’s secretary, Ms. Mary walked in and reported respectfully, “General Manager, I’ve made an appointment with the Wenda Group to visit their resort development project. We have to go to the site for inspection now, and your car is ready.”

Nox nodded. With that, he got up and left the company with his secretary.

He did not know when it started, but all of the Swans’ businesses had fallen on him to manage.

Initially, when Edward took office, he was focusing solely on developing his political career and could not spare any energy for business at all. Hence, Nox had to take over the business side of things. It was really tough back then, but now, everything was finally back on track.

There was not much pressure anymore, and he did not need to spend a lot of time on the business. However, he still felt physically and mentally exhausted.

He had always thought that once the country’s politics had smoothened out, he, Edward, and Finn would no longer have to shoulder any responsibilities and could live their own lives.

However, it was all wishful thinking. When the country was at peace, they had greater responsibilities!

Nox turned around and saw the car had parked in the largest sea area in South Hampton City. Then, he took a yacht to an island that had yet to be fully developed as he needed to see the results of the second stage of development today. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

When the yacht arrived on the island, there were people welcoming them warmly. As Nox was used to being welcomed, he exchanged a few pleasantries with Danny Cruzi, the general manager of Wenda Group, who then showed him around respectfully.

In the past, Danny had heard that Nox was sloppy and unreliable. However, after interacting with Nox twice, he realized that the rumors were false. In terms of work, Nox was even more demanding than ordinary people, and after he was humiliated last time, he did not dare to be negligent this time.

Nox’s expression was very serious as he listened to Danny’s report and looked around. He could see that the development progress this time was much better than the last time.

The last time, they cut corners, and he almost directly banned Wenda Group’s construction rights.

By the time Nox did a tour of the place and pointed out the parts that were not perfect, it was time to eat.

Nox did not refuse to eat at the only high-class restaurant on the island as it was also considered part of the project.

Only Nox and Danny were at the table while everyone else who did not have the right to sit at the table stood at the side.

From afar, Nox looked very noble. That was probably the Nox that Shelly had never seen before. In her memories, Nox was simply unbearable, so she almost could not recognize the serious-looking man in a suit and leather shoes at that moment.

She stood quietly in the crowd and watched Nox and Danny eat elegantly.

In fact, from the moment Nox arrived, she had been standing behind him. However, Nox did not recognize her and probably would not.

“Tell me about the restaurant.” Nox put down her knife and fork seriously.
