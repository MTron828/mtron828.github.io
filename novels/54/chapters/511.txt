Chapter 512: The Plot Begins, Monica Admits to Her Mistake!

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She always felt that Michael was very careful with her. However, it was a fact that it was inappropriate for them to hold hands in their current relationship.

Monica thought about it and nodded.

Michael was always very good to her too. He did everything because he had no choice. He had no other intentions.

Moreover, all of Michael’s actions made it easy for her to let go of that awkwardness with him.

With that, Michael approached Monica and held Monica’s hand to support her as they walked into the ward. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The ward was large and quiet, and the environment was nice.

Other than the private nurse, Michael’s mother, Reese Witherspoon was there.

She looked haggard and pale. It was like she had not had a good rest for a long time and that both physically and mentally tired.

The moment Reese saw them, she did not react much. It was as if she was just a bag of skin, doing something mechanically.

She only glanced at them before turning back to look at the man lying on the hospital bed, breathing heavily. He looked like he was about to die.

Monica could not believe that Michael’s parents would be in such a predicament the next time she saw them again.

......

In her memory, they were arrogant and domineering. They looked down on her like they were above her.

Yet now… What a desolate scene that was.

She could not describe what she was feeling, but she naturally felt sad. After all, people always sympathized with the weak, and Monica was an emotional person.

She bit her lips.

At that moment, she could feel Michael pulling her to his father’s bedside.

Monica even looked at him, who was so thin that it seemed like his body was left with only a layer of skin. At that moment, his breathing was heavy, and it sounded like he would not be able to breathe in the next second, which was scary.

Michael leaned close to Liam’s ear. “Dad, Monica is here to see you.”

The man who seemed to have lost his consciousness suddenly reacted. He opened his eyes and looked at Michael.

Slowly, he turned his head to look at Monica.

Monica felt a little uncomfortable under Liam’s gaze. She did not expect the dignified Minister Ross would end up like that one day.

Then, she saw Liam move his fingers, and Michael nodded.

Michael told the nurse to adjust the bed for Liam so that the latter could sit up a little.

Once Liam was in a half-lying position, Michael took off the mask for Liam.

After he took it off, Monica was even more frightened at Liam’s appearance. Due to his illness, his entire face had been disfigured.

At that moment, Liam said with great effort, “I thought you would never forgive me.”

Monica hurriedly nodded. “That’s not true, uncle.”

“If it weren’t for me, you and Michael wouldn’t have ended up like this...”

“It’s all in the past, uncle. There’s no need to say anything else. I understand your worries back then. I’m not worthy of Michael.”

“No,” Liam said with difficulty. “We were too much for separating you two.”

Monica kept shaking her head.

It was really difficult for her to reject such feelings now, and she did not even know how to deal with them.

“I want to apologize to you here,” Liam said, revealing his amiable side.

Monica really could not accept it.

What she was afraid of the most was feeling emotionally burdened.

She would rather be scolded by Liam than for him to treat her like that, which would make her feel very guilty.

After all, she and Michael had really broken up.

“Uncle, take good care of yourself. I really don’t care about the past anymore,” Monica hurriedly said.

Liam smiled, but it did not look like an ordinary person’s smile.

Clearly, it was forced.

“That’s good since you guys are together again...” Liam’s voice became softer and softer.

Michael hurriedly went up to support his father. “Dad, you should rest more.”

Liam nodded.

Suddenly, he stretched out his hand and looked at Monica.

Monica was stunned, but she reacted in the next second by stretching her hand too.

Then, Liam took Monica’s hand and placed it on Michael’s hand.

Monica pursed her lips.

“Monica, I don’t have much time left. From now on, I’ll hand Michael over to you,” Liam said weakly.
