In Universe Garden, Alexander accused Jeanne and said with certainty that Jasmine’s miscarriage had something to do with Jeanne.

Jeanne looked at Alexander with a cold smile.

Sometimes, she wondered why the person whom she had lived with for so many years and raised her could be so disgusting that right now, she really wanted to kill them.

The smile on her lips became colder and colder as she looked at Alexander, who showed no mercy to her.

“Dad, did you hear that? Jeanne’s father said the same thing about Jeanne. This proves that this is not the first time Jeanne has done something like that! She has been bossy and domineering since she was young. She just can’t stand seeing others being better than her, so she uses such unscrupulous ways to deal with things. What evidence do you need?” Elaine said righteously.

Old Master Swan was still unmoved. He looked at the person in front of him coldly and said, “As to what kind of person Jeanne is and whether she would do all these things, I have my reservations. However, you have no concrete evidence to prove that Jeanne did all these. I can be sure to tell everyone that I will not pursue this matter!”

“Dad! How can you protect Jeanne like that?” Belle broke down.

She looked at Old Master Swan and did not care if she made a big fuss.

She said, “You have always protected Edward, and now you’re also protecting Edward’s wife? What do you want us to think? Let’s not talk about before, when you like Edward and think he has the ability to bring the family to greater heights. We can all tolerate that! But with this matter, I absolutely cannot tolerate it! I refuse to let it go, no matter what. Dad, even if you want to kick me out of the family, I won’t let it go so easily!”

Old Master Swan’s expression was visibly grimmer!

At that moment, Henry also burst out in rage. He said, “Dad, Eden made a mistake because of some objective and subjective reasons that have caused the company to lose 200 to 300 million dollars. In fact, I don’t think that amount caused too much of an impact on Swan Enterprise! However, Edward and Jeanne fired Eden as the president of Swanhaven Bank in front of the senior management by threatening him with a small piece of evidence, which humiliated and crushed him! Yet, now that Jeanne has made such a huge mistake, you want to settle this matter peacefully? Dad, do you think only Edward matters in the family? What about Elaine, Richard, and I?”

“Henry!” Old Master Swan’s face darkened and was filled with rage.

Today, Henry had thrown all caution to the wind.

......

After all his years in the Swans, he had had enough.

He had always thought that the family would eventually fall into his hands. Ever since he was born, he had been well educated by the Swans. However, unexpectedly, when he was in his twenties, his father had another son. What he could not understand even more was that ever since Edward was born, his status plummeted. All his father’s attention shifted to Edward, and in the end, he really did hand the family over to Edward to manage!

He had been suppressing his emotions, thinking that one day, his father would come to his senses and hand the Swans back to him. Even if his father did not, he could give it to Eden. Yet now, it seemed like he was dreaming. No matter what, his father would always think of Edward, and in the future, the entire family would be Edward’s to manage!

He shouted at Old Master Swan, “Father, I have always respected you. I really thought of you as the most admirable person in my life. I have seen you guide the political world and the business world. I’ve also seen the brilliant and righteous side of you. I even regarded you as my role model since I was young, hoping I could become someone like you! But now, your actions have really disappointed me. As the head of the family, you only show favoritism to your youngest son. What do you take the rest of us for? We’ve become dispensable to you, huh?”

Old Master Swan’s expression was extremely ugly.

He probably did not expect his son to go against him like that one day.

“If only mom were here. At least mom has never sided with Edward, and you have really taken it too far!”
