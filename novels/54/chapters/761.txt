Chapter 762: The Upper-Class Banquet, the Conspiracy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The anger he was suppressing started showing on his face.

He forced himself to look away and said to Joshua, “Tonight’s the night.”

“What?” Joshua was so nervous that his hands trembled.

“What are you afraid of? I’ve already arranged everything for you.” Eden looked at Joshua disappointedly.

“But…Would it succeed?” Joshua glanced at Quinn.

That woman had been by her fiancé’s side the entire night. How could he let her into his bed?

“Don’t worry. Since I said it’s possible, it definitely will be. Just do as I say.”

“Alright.” Joshua nodded.

Rather than worrying and being afraid, he was obviously more excited.

Eden glanced at Michael, who was not far away and who also gave Eden a look. Then, Eden told Joshua to stay far away before he walked toward Michael.

Michael and Eden were classmates, and most people knew that they had a good relationship. Therefore, it was normal for the two of them to talk at the banquet.

Jeanne turned around and saw the two of them standing together.

She quietly shifted her gaze away because she did not want to arouse anyone’s suspicion and glanced at Quinn, who was holding onto her fiancé’s arm.

There was no emotion on her face.

After Eden and Michael parted ways, Michael walked directly to Quinn.

Michael and Quinn’s fiancé were both in politics, so they naturally had more topics to talk about.

As the two of them chatted happily, a waiter walked past Michael with a wine glass.

Michael stopped the waiter and very naturally changed a glass of champagne for Quinn and her fiancé. He also took a glass for himself, and the three of them drank the champagne together.

Eden watched from a distance with a cold smile on his face.

The night was getting darker, but the banquet was still ongoing, and only a few people had left.

Suddenly, Quinn felt very sleepy. However, no matter how much she tried to get herself to stay awake, she still felt very sleepy. As such, she rubbed her temples.

“What’s wrong?” Michael seemed to have noticed something wrong with her.

“It’s nothing. I’m just a little dizzy. It’s probably because I’ve been working overtime for too long recently, so I haven’t had a good rest.”

“You always used to take your homework seriously, but I can’t believe you’re still so hardworking now that you’re a working adult.”

“I have no choice. I can’t embarrass the Sanders.”

“In that case, I’ll send you back,” her fiancé said considerately.

“No need. My big brother hasn’t left yet, and it’s inappropriate for you to leave.” Quinn said, “I’ll find my way back by myself. You can talk to Michael more. After all, my dad has always admired Michael.”

“Don’t say that. The leader must like Jim more. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have chosen him as your fiancé.”

“My dad said what he likes about you the most is that not only do you speak nicely and handle things accordingly, but you also know your limits.”

Michael appeared a little humble. “The leader flatters me.”

“Let’s leave it at that. I’ll head back first.” Quinn really did feel sleepy.

“Give me a call when you’re home,” Jim said with concern.

Quinn nodded.

In reality, they were just in a political marriage. They did not have feelings for each other, and it was just a show to outsiders.

Moreover, Quinn was a very independent person and would not let anyone see her weaknesses.

She fought back the sleepiness and walked out of the banquet hall.

As Eden and Joshua saw her leave, Eden gave Joshua a look.

Joshua immediately followed.

Jeanne watched Joshua walk past her and excused herself to the washroom, leaving Edward alone.

She walked into the washroom to send Miles a message. “Joshua is out. Keep an eye on him for me, and remember to take a video.”

“Alright,” he said.

Just as Jeanne came out of the bathroom, she bumped into Eden.

Jeanne reacted as if nothing had happened, and Eden reacted the same way. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I didn’t think I would regret it so much one day,” Eden said bluntly.

Jeanne sneered.

“I really regret losing you.”

Jeanne left without even looking at Eden.

Eden gritted his teeth.

One day, he would make that woman regret it as much as he did now!

…

Finally, the banquet finally came to an end, and William, as thoughtful as he was, sent off his guests one by one.

Jeanne held Edward’s arm and got into his luxurious car.

It had been a long night, and she was very tired.

Edward hugged her, allowing her to get closer to him.

The two of them were very intimate. When they were together, they were always intimate with each other. It seemed to have become a habit.

Just then, the phone in Jeanne’s hand lit up. It was a message from Miles. “Joshua has brought Quinn to the hotel. I’ve sent the address to you.”
