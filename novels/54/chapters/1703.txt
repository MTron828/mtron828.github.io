Chapter 1704: Nox Knows That Shelly Had a Miscarriage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What else do I have? I’ve sold everything I could.”

“In that case, get in the car.” Mrs. Winter did not want to waste any time.

Zoe followed Mrs. Winter into the car, and Mrs. Winter then brought Zoe to the best hotel in South Hampton City. When they checked in, Zoe was a little hesitant. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“What’s wrong?” Mrs. Winter asked her.

“I was afraid Nox would find me and drag me to get an abortion again. So, to avoid Nox’s eyes, I had to live in those places. Nox would never have thought that I would live in that kind of hostel,” Zoe explained.

Mrs. Winter thought about it and realized Zoe’s worries made sense. Someone as stupid as Nox could really do anything. She said, “Let’s go. I’ll buy you a house.”

“Aunty…” Zoe was surprised.

“If the child is Nox’s, you deserve it.” Mrs. Winter said calmly, “The Winters will not mistreat you.”

“Thank you, Aunty.”

Without being too friendly, Mrs. Winter drove Zoe to the newest building and bought Zoe a luxury apartment that was ready to move in.

Not only that, but Mrs. Winter also bought Zoe clothes and skincare products. She even hired a nanny for Zoe. Before she left, she gave Zoe 2000 dollars for expenses and told Zoe she could ask for more when she ran out.

Zoe was so grateful that she cried as she sent Mrs. Winter off. After that, she looked at the spacious house and brand-new furniture, feeling excited. If she had known that Mrs. Winter was so easy to talk to, she would have come to look for her earlier. Then, she would not have had to suffer so much.

She quickly picked up her phone and called her parents. “Dad, Mom, I’ll give you an address. You can move in.”

“Did you succeed?” the other party asked excitedly.

“It worked. When Mrs. Winter found out that I was pregnant with Nox’s child, she immediately bought me a house, clothes, and a nanny.”

“Alright, we’ll be right there. However, Zoe, if we lie to Mrs. Winter like this, we’ll lose everything once we’re exposed.” The other parties expressed their worries.

“I didn’t lie to her. I may not know if the child is Nox’s, but what if it is?” Zoe retorted.

Indeed, she did not know if the child was Nox’s because after sleeping with Nox, she had also slept with many other people. However, it should be Nox’s, but she could not care less. If she did not get the Winters to give her some money, she would not be able to survive!

Today, she had gotten Mrs. Winter to go to the hospital with her for a checkup because she knew that Mrs. Winter would definitely not be willing to risk a miscarriage for an amniocentesis. Fortunately, she did manage to get away with it.

“But what if it isn’t? Don’t you know how cruel Nox is to us? If you lie to him again, he will kill us!”

“Don’t worry, I won’t let this child be born. I’m just trying to swindle a sum of money!” Zoe said bluntly, “Now that I’m sure that Mrs. Winter wants the child in my belly, I’ll use Mrs. Winter to negotiate with Nox. As long as Nox gives me a sum of money, I’ll abort the child. Then, with money, our family will be able to live for the rest of our lives.”

“That’s the only way,” the other party quickly echoed. “I’ve had enough of this hard life.” “Quick! Come over.”

“Alright.”

When Zoe hung up, her eyes narrowed. She did not want to lie to Nox, but Nox was just too cruel. If not for the fact that she could not survive anymore, she would not have dared to threaten Nox!

This time, she had thought it through. All she wanted was money, and as long as Nox gave her money, she would stop pestering him.

Nox had not been in a good mood recently. Ever since he found out that Shelly did not like him, he had been feeling upset.

How else could he make Shelly like him? It was really hard for him to think of ways he could do that. He had always found Shelly to be stubborn, and she could turn a blind eye to whatever he did.

While he sat there in the office, feeling frustrated, the phone rang.

Nox picked up. “What’s the matter?”

The person opposite him took a deep breath and could tell that Nox was in a bad mood.

“Speak!” Nox raised his voice.

“Mr. Winter, we found Zoe,” the other party said in fear. Nox had almost forgotten about that person..
