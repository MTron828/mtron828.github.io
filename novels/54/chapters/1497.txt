Chapter 1498: Chloe’s End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Things like that make me feel that I’m embarrassing myself.” Candice’s voice was clear and emotionless.

It was as if she was just stating a fact or she was telling someone else’s story that did not affect her much. Edward, however, did not reply.

The quiet night was especially peaceful, and Candice did not say anything else.

All she needed was to state her thoughts clearly. As for whether Edward wanted to listen or do as she said… To be honest, she had no confidence he would and could not control it, so she would not force it.

She closed her eyes and slowly fell asleep.

In her dreams, she felt someone hugging her tightly, as if he was afraid of losing her. She also seemed to hear a voice whispering in her ear, saying, “One day, you will hate me…”

She denied it or wanted to deny it, but she was too sleepy to open her eyes.

Deep down, she believed she would never hate Edward. She was respectful of his position and understood their identities. Since she understood that, she would not allow herself to fall too deep into it and hate him

At that time, she really thought so, if she did not… start to recall many things later on.

The next day, Candice did a stretch. As George did not have to get up early to go to school at home, he basically had breakfast with them, so she did not have to get up alone.

She moved her body and looked at Edward, who was still sleeping beside her. She was actually a little surprised. Was it still early? Why was Edward not up yet? Why had he not left? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She could not help but take out her phone to look at the time. It was past 8 a.m. in the morning. Logically speaking, Edward should have already gone out by now, yet he was still lying on the bed.

Did he oversleep? Did their conversation last night made him so unhappy that it affected his sleep?

She hurriedly called out to him, “Edward, wake up. It’s late.” Edward seemed to move his eyebrows and nothing else.

“Edward… Ah!” Candice suddenly screamed.

She had only reached out to call him.

However, she did not expect that just as she reached out her hand, Edward would grab her. At the same time, he pressed Candice under his body at an astonishing speed and kissed her passionately without hesitation.

“Oh.” Candice twisted her body and tried to resist, but he was so strong that she could not do so.

How could she resist Edward? Therefore, in the next second, she took the initiative to respond to him.

Early in the morning, the air felt different, and after a long time, the two of them came out of the bathroom together.

They had to admit that that was the best way to wake up immediately.

“You’re late for work,” Candice said as she helped Edward with his tie. “Is it okay?”

“It’s fine if I’m late occasionally.”

“Alright.” Candice nodded and helped him with his tie. “It’s done.”

Edward took a look and the corners of his lips curled up into a smile. He seemed very satisfied with the tie she had tied for him.

After that, the two of them walked out of the room and went downstairs intimately. Downstairs, Chloe was already playing in the living room with Paige in her arms.

Paige, that heartless little girl, had completely forgotten that she had to wake her mother up with a kiss every morning. However, the moment she saw them, she was still very excited. Her small body pushed Chloe away, and she ran towards them.

“Daddy, Mommy, you’re finally up.”

Edward picked Paige up from the ground. It was obvious that he doted on Paige.

“Did you guys wake up so late because… you’re going to give me a little sister?” Paige asked innocently.

Edward’s expression changed slightly, and he turned to look at Candice. He saw her calm expression. It seemed like she had overcome the issue of not having kids anymore.

However, Candice’s calmness really made him feel a little uncomfortable. It was as if she had let go of all worldly desires and did not have much pursuit for anything. A person like that could turn around and leave whenever she wanted to.

Chloe was not far away from them. She did not know how they would get along after she deliberately exposed the conflict in their relationship yesterday. She even hoped that they would have a big fight and Candice would run away from home.

Once Candice left, she would have a chance to get close to Edward..
