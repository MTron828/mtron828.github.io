934 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

“It’s best if you don’t,” Finn affirmed.

“But… I don’t have the ability to share my father’s burden. I don’t know anything about work…”

“Isn’t that your problem?” Finn asked in return.

Monica looked at him.

“Isn’t that the reason you should be looking for? Why can Jeanne do so many things? She can manage a company well and drive away all those who are against her, but why can’t you? Do you plan to stay under your parents’ wings for the rest of your life and be protected by them forever? Now that they can’t protect you anymore, you don’t know what to do and can’t live on your own?” Finn’s voice was really cold.

Her disdain for her was obvious.

However, what Finn said was true too.

Jeanne was her best friend grew up with, and Jeanne knew everything. Yet, she knew nothing. She would only cry when he encountered problems.

Without the protection of her parents, she would be useless.

“Do you think I’m useless?” Monica asked him.

However, she regretted it the moment she asked that question, for she felt that she had asked a very stupid question.

Did Finn not make himself clear?

He was silent at the moment, as if he was tacitly agreeing with her.

Monica smiled. “Bad grades, bad character, and can’t even see through people. I don’t even realize that I’m being used. I don’t listen to anyone’s kind advice and think that I’m always right, but I don’t know how to do anything when I’m in trouble.”

Finn’s fingers on the keyboard stopped typing for a moment.

“In fact, you’re right to completely give up on me. People like me are really…” Monica laughed again. “I’m really not worthy of being liked by anyone.”

Finn’s throat moved.

“I’ll leave you to your work. Thank you for your reminder.” Monica then left Finn’s office.

She never thought she would get any comfort from Finn, and she was not giving up on herself when she said those words just now. She was just telling the truth. After saying it, she also understood what kind of person she was and knew better than to like anyone else.

She was not worthy.

With that, she returned to the hospital ward, and by then, she had calmed down considerably.

Her only advantage was that she could quickly adjust her mood, or perhaps, only she thought that it was an advantage.

Perhaps in the eyes of others, she was heartless.

When she pushed the door open, her mother was taking care of her father and was being very gentle with him.

“Monica, you didn’t sleep at all last night. Why don’t you lie on the bed and get some sleep?” Ruby said when she saw her daughter.

“That’s right. It was you who kept uncle company last night. Even I went to sleep for a while, but you didn’t sleep for even a minute. You should go get some sleep, Monica. Aunty and I will take good care of uncle,” Sarah quickly said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Monica said, “I’ll go back and get some sleep.”

“That’s good.” Ruby agreed, “It’s not comfortable to sleep here, so go back and have a good sleep. You can come back when you’re up.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded, and at that moment, she glanced at her father.

Her father was obviously giving her a look to say that he wanted her to take her mother away.

It was probably because he thought that she had contacted his assistant.

Monica said to her father, “Dad, I just went to ask Finn. He said that you’re still recovering and that you can’t exert yourself or be stimulated in any way, so stop thinking about work. I won’t help you to contact your assistant to come over.”

Gary glared at her to stop talking.

When Ruby heard that, her expression changed. “Do you want to die? Do you hate me so much that you want to die and leave me alone? Gary, did I marry you for money? For your family’s money? You’re willing to throw away your life for money, aren’t you?”

“No, I just have something to tell him. Once I’m done, I’ll be good and rest in the hospital–”

“Stop talking about the company. You better lie in bed for me. At most, we’ll go bankrupt. If you dare to interfere with work again, I’ll kill myself,” Ruby threatened.

Her father had always doted on her mother.

Since Gary could not dissuade Ruby, he said helplessly, “Okay, okay. I won’t care about work anymore. I’ll listen to you and take care of my body, okay? ”

“Hubby, after you recover, our family will have everything. What’s the point of having so much money if you’re sick or dead?” Seeing Gary compromise, Ruby became much gentler. “To me, all I want is for our family to be in good health. If something happens to you, our family will collapse.”
