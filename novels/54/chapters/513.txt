Chapter 514: The Plot Begins, Monica Admits to Her Mistake

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She did not know how long they stayed hugging before Michael let go of her as he wiped his eyes.

He said, “Monica, I’m sorry.”

Monica’s heart hurt even more.

“I shouldn’t have hugged you just now...” Michael apologized.

Monica looked at Michael’s expression and felt extremely guilty.

If she had known earlier that he was going through so much in his life, she would have…

Even so, she could not give up on Finn.

All in all, she just felt bad and sorry for Michael.

“Monica, thank you for accompanying me to meet my parents today and for comforting me just now.” Michael suddenly forced a smile on his face. Then, he said, “I’m going back now.”

He did not pester her or beg her to stay with him because he was down.

He was sensible and educated enough to leave. He would never do anything that would make things difficult for her.

Monica looked at Michael sitting in the car with his eyes still red.

If Finn did not exist, she would definitely be together with Michael. However, because of Finn… she could not be with him just because she felt touched and guilty.

She watched as Michael drove away before she turned around and returned to her car, feeling a little sad.

She took a deep breath and hoped it would all be over soon.

Little did she know that a few people were hiding behind a small car in the garage and taking pictures of her and Michael.

As Monica rode the car to the hospital, she took out her phone and scrolled through the news in the backseat to relax.

She had to distract herself because every time she thought of Michael, she would feel guilty. Hence, her phone would stop her from thinking about it.

While she was scrolling through the news, however, her eyes suddenly widened.

At that moment, she could not believe it until she saw a picture of herself in the headlines.

She blinked and swiped it twice.

“F*ck!” Monica suddenly shouted.

The driver was startled.

“Isn’t that Michael and I earlier? How did it get caught on camera? How did it get on the news so quickly?” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

The title of the article was highly infuriating.

It read: Liam’s son, Michael, is suspected of having an affair with a married woman.

Then, the article introduced her, saying that she was the daughter of Cardellini Medical Technology and had married the famous cardiologist of South Hampton City Central Hospital, Finn, a few years ago. As of late, the two of them were suspected to have rekindled their relationship.

When the news came out, it attracted countless views. There were even a lot of comments on it.

Monica was so angry that she was about to explode.

When she and Michael were together, they had never been exposed. Yet, now that they were no longer together, the media was making up all sorts of stories about them.

At the moment, while she was on the verge of having a mental breakdown, the phone suddenly rang.

She looked at the incoming call and picked it up.

Michael said, “Monica, I think the paparazzi caught us.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Monica gritted her teeth and said, “I saw the news.”

“It’s my fault.” Michael quickly said, “These paparazzi are following me. Because my father has been in critical condition recently, and there has been no news of him, they wanted to find out about my father’s condition through me. I didn’t expect–”

“I don’t blame you,” Monica said.

He could hear the self-reproach in his tone.

Moreover, Michael was the one who was criticized the most and suffered the most damage to his reputation. Yet, all he thought about now was her feelings.

“I will handle this news and clarify to the public that there’s nothing between us.” Michael seemed very afraid of hurting her.

“Anyway, it’s all gossip, and not many people will believe it. Let it pass. Now that your father is seriously ill, don’t tire yourself out.”

“No. I have to clear my conscience.” After Michael said that, he hung up the call.

Monica wanted to say something else, but she sighed.

Actually, she did not care what outsiders thought or wrote about her. Now, she was worried about whether Finn would be furious if he found out.

She told him she would go back to pack them some clothes today when, in fact, she was on a rendezvous with her old lover.

With Finn’s personality, he would definitely be... difficult to deal with.
