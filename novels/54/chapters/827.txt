However, that sentence made him stop in his tracks.

Then, standing not far from Kingsley, he pointed a gun at the latter.

Now, the only people left beside Kingsley’s side were Mason and Jeanne, who were the assassins restraining Edward.

He would definitely not be able to take them head-on.

At that moment, the assassin who was holding Edward was pointing a gun at Edward’s head. If Nox made any move, Edward’s brain would explode.

Nox’s expression was dark.

Finn had also caught up as fast as he could.

Looking at the current situation, he could not help but take a step back as he was afraid of forcing Kingsley into a corner.

With the sky starting to brighten up, Nox and Finn eventually saw the pale-faced Edward covered in blood.

Nox believed that if that continued, Edward would not be able to survive even if Kingsley did not kill him.

Feeling worried, Nox pulled the trigger.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed. “Are you sure you want to see Fourth Master Swan die right now?!

“Release him!” Nox shouted. His voice was so loud that her entire body was trembling with anger.

It had been a long time since he had seen Edward so weak, and it was because of Jeanne that the latter had tortured himself into that damned state.

The gun he was pointing at Kingsley was instantly aimed at Jeanne.

He wanted to beat this woman to death.

“Nox!” Finn grabbed his hand.

At that moment, a bullet was fired into the sky.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. If not for Finn’s intervention, she would have been shot dead by Nox.

However, because of Nox’s sudden shot, Kingsley’s shot landed on Edward’s thigh.

“Mm!” Edward endured the intense pain.

Jeanne turned to look at Edward.

Having seen it too, Nox’s eyes were bloodshot.

“If you dare to shoot again, I won’t just be shooting him in the leg!” Kingsley threatened.

Nox flew into a rage and shouted, “Kingsley, if you dare to touch Edward, I’ll chop you up and feed your corpse to the dogs!”

Kingsley, however, was not threatened. Instead, he turned to Nox and said, “In my entire life, I’ve never had a gun pointed at my head before. You’re the first!”

“I don’t f*cking care if I’m the first. You better let Edward go. Otherwise, I’ll shoot you dead!” Nox cursed. His emotions were completely out of control.

However, Kingsley was furious.

The gun in Kingsley’s hand was frantically aimed at Finn and Nox’s subordinates, and he kept shooting.

In an instant, Finn and Nox’s men all fell to the ground, and they bled profusely.

Nox and Finn, who had been holding their guns the entire time, were trying to hold themselves back from reacting that their hands were trembling. However, they did not dare to shoot Kingsley, that cruel man in front of them, because Edward’s life was in his hands.

Kingsley looked at the people on the ground and then at Nox and Finn, who were the only ones left. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He said, “Do you dare to shoot?”

He was deliberately provoking Nox and Finn.

Nox’s hand that was holding the gun kept shaking, and his eyes were bloodshot. His vision was even a little blurry.

Similarly, Finn’s entire body had tensed up because of Kingsley’s sudden ruthlessness.

“Do you have the guts to kill me?” Kingsley toyed with the gun in his hand as he asked Nox, who was already pushed to his limit.

“If you don’t kill me, I’ll kill you,” Kingsley said.

As soon as he said that, he tightened his grip on the gun he was toying with and aimed it at Nox’s head.

“As I said before, no one in this world has dared to point a gun at my head. You’re the first and the last.” Kingsley’s expression turned cold.

Just as he was about to pull the trigger, Jeanne suddenly stood in front of Kingsley.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

At that moment, he did not pull the trigger.

Jeanne looked at Kingsley and said, “Let them go!”

Kingsley’s face sank. “Do you know what you’re saying?”

“I said, let them go! Let Edward, Nox, and Finn go.”

“Slap!” A tight slap landed on Jeanne’s face.

Jeanne bit her lip, and her face instantly turned red and swollen.

Even so, she did not leave Kingsley. She just stood there.

“You’ve forgotten everything I’ve told you, haven’t you?” Kingsley questioned her with a frightening expression on his face.
