Chapter 662: The Shareholder Meeting, A Huge Catfight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica was really surprised to see Finn.

Especially when their eyes met, she could see the coldness in Finn’s eyes.

Finn’s words from that morning echoed in her ears. He said if she went near him again, he would kill her.

She bit her lips, and her body tensed up.

Then, she lowered her head and forced herself to avert her gaze, pretending she did not see him.

On the contrary, Sarah, who was beside her, seemed very excited.

She quickly ran to Finn’s side with a warm expression. “Finn, you’re here.”

Gary frowned and demanded in an elder’s tone, “How can you call him by his first name? You should call him–”

He almost said the word, brother-in-law.

However, after a pause, he changed his words. “Call him Mr. Finn.”

“Mr. Finn.” Sarah immediately changed her words.

‘Let’s see how you can like him now!’ Monica wanted to strangle Sarah to death.

Finn reacted a little coldly. “Just call me by my name.”

Sarah pouted and was a little unhappy.

Monica laughed to herself. She knew very well how difficult it was to deal with a man like Finn, and Sarah was still too inexperienced.

“You’re back.” Ruby walked to the door and greeted Gary affectionately. When she saw Finn’s arrival, she was a little surprised, but she quickly said warmly, “Oh, Finn is here too. Come in. Let’s have lunch together.”

“I’m here to help uncle check his heart.” Finn was explaining why he was there.

“I almost forgot that Finn hasn’t started work yet. Fortunately, I gave Finn a call before I went straight to the hospital. Otherwise, I would have wasted another trip,” Gary added.

“Are you not feeling well again?” Ruby was worried.

“No, it’s a routine check-up,” Gary quickly explained. “Finn said the routine check-up can be done at home. All he needs is the equipment in the medical box.”

“Oh, that’s good.” Ruby heaved a sigh of relief. “In that case, let’s eat first. You can do the check-up after we’ve eaten.”

“The routine check doesn’t take long–”

“Finn.” Ruby sounded a little angry. “Today is my birthday. Is it so difficult to get you to have a meal with me?”

Finn stayed quiet.

Gary patted Finn’s shoulder. “It’s your auntie’s birthday. We were already your family before you were with Monica, so are we not family now that you’re divorced from Monica?”

Finn forced a smile. “Uncle, you’ve misunderstood me. I just wanted to have lunch after the check-up.”

“There’s no rush,” Gary said. “Let’s eat first.”

Finn agreed.

Throughout the whole process, Monica’s heart was beating very fast.

She thought that with Finn’s personality, he would turn around and leave. Fortunately, he still showed her parents some respect.

Ruby invited Finn to sit at the dining table, and Monica followed along and sat next to Finn.

Just as she sat down, Finn stood up from her seat and sat on the other side with Sarah in between.

Monica pursed her lips.

Finn’s rejection of her was obvious.

Gary and Ruby also saw it and chose to ignore it too.

On the other hand, Sarah was very excited. She even moved her seat closer to Finn.

However, Finn did not like people to get close to him, so he chose to remain silent at that moment.

“Let’s eat,” Ruby said warmly to make the atmosphere less awkward.

Only then did everyone start eating.

Ruby picked up a piece of fish and put it on Finn’s plate. “You like to eat fish, so eat more.”

“Thank you, auntie.” Finn was very polite. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Does Finn like fish?” Sarah asked.

Finn responded but not enthusiastically.

“In that case, I’ll learn how to cook all kinds of dishes with fish for you.” Sarah looked happy, seemingly because she had discovered Finn’s preferences.

Monica saw it all.

Sarah was acting very similar to herself back in the day. When she first met Finn, she was only 19 years old, but she was also very excited when she discovered Finn’s little hobbies.

She lowered her head and ate silently.

“Do my dishes taste bad?” Ruby looked at her daughter.

Monica raised her head.

“Stop picking at that pasta. Don’t you like beef? I specially asked the kitchen to prepare it for you. Help yourself to some,” Ruby called out.

Monica picked up a piece of beef but did not have an appetite to eat.
