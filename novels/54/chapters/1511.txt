Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a quiet room, there was only the sound of Paige muttering to himself as she drew.

“This is Daddy, and this is Mommy. I’m going to draw my brother and me now.” Paige’s voice echoed in the room.

Candice held the diary and looked at everything inside.

“I love Daddy and Mommy the most, and Brother…” Paige’s voice rang out.

She was just carefree and happy.

I want to live with Daddy, Mommy, and Brother forever…”

“Mommy.” Paige suddenly looked up and called out to Candice, “Mom, can you write something for me? I want Dad, Brother, and your names on this picture.”

Candice’s eyes flickered, and she stared straight at Paige, seriously and carefully.

“Mom?” Paige was confused by Candice’s stare. “Are you crying?”

Candice’s throat moved slightly, and a tear rolled down from the corner of her eye. As she wiped it with her finger, the corners of her mouth curled into a faint, self-deprecating smile.

“Mom, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Paige asked nervously when she saw Candice crying.

Candice opened her mouth but could not make a sound. Some truths were just so unexpected that she started choking up.

“Mommy…”

“How could you take my diary?” George suddenly walked into the room.

He no longer needed to be in a wheelchair, but he still need a cane to walk. At that moment, he rushed in and took the diary from Candice’s hands.

Candice looked at George’s furious exDression indifferently. He was so angrv that his face had turned red.

“Get out!” George lost his temper, and his expression was scary. Paige was frightened by his expression that she burst out crying.

“Boohoo…” Paige burst into tears.

Candice looked at Paige’s pitiful expression. Even when Paige cried, she looked just like Edward. As expected, she had Edward’s genes.

“Get out!” George did not calm down even though Paige was crying. He even carried Paige off the chair rudely and stuffed her into Candice’s arms. “All of you, get out!”

“Boohoo… Brother is so fierce…” Paige cried even harder.

Only children would cry loudly.

Candice looked at Paige and then turned to George. She watched as George put the diary directly into his desk drawer and shut the drawer fiercely as if to vent his anger.

“George,” Candice called out.

“Don’t call me!” George was fuming. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He looked frighteningly angry, probably because she had crossed his boundaries.

“Would you believe me if I said this diary is mine?” Candice said, emphasizing each word.

George suddenly froze and turned to look at Candice, who had tears in her eyes but a smile on her face. Her appearance made him suddenly think of… No, his mother was already dead. There was no way she could have come back to life.

Candice reached out and stroked his hair, just like his mother always did a few years ago. Then, he heard her say, “I still think curly hair suits you better.” That one sentence made George burst into tears.

Paige, who had been crying hysterically at the side, cried even harder when she saw her brother crying.

As she cried, she said, “Brother, don’t cry. I won’t come to your room to play anymore. Don’t cry, okay?”

Tears streamed down George’s face. He had never cried since he found out about his mother’s passing, and today, he could not control his tears anymore.

In the evening, Edward got off work as usual.

“Daddy.” Paige got up from the ground and ran over with her short legs to hug Edward’s leg excitedly.

Edward picked Paige up.” Where’s your mommy?”

“I don’t know,” Paige answered honestly. “I haven’t seen Mommy and Brother since I woke up from my afternoon nap. I don’t know where they went, so I’ve been playing alone at home. Daddy, where did Mommy go?” Edward frowned, and at that moment, he had a bad feeling.

“Teddy,” Edward shouted.

Teddy quickly came out of the room. “Fourth Master..”
