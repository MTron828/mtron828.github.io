Chapter 390: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

“Finn, I love you.” Monica told him over and over again, “I love you. From the beginning to the end, I’ll only love you.”

“I really love you.”

“I really, really love you.”

“Finn, I love you.”

“I love you. I love you...”

Tears streamed down Monica’s face.

She spoke until her voice was hoarse.

She did not know how to wake Finn up. All she wanted was to tell him all the feelings that she had kept to herself.

All she wanted was for him to know that she loved him and only him.

She did not know how much time had passed when the attending physician came in and said, “Mrs. Jones, you should get some rest. We’re going to give Dr. Jones remedial treatment now.”

Monica’s eyes were red. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Remedial treatment? It was just remedial treatment.

If they could not treat him, would Finn lie on that bed forever?

......

She stood up silently and leaned into Finn’s face.

An oxygen mask was covering his mouth, so she could only kiss his pale cheeks.

She said, “Finn.

“Please.

“Don’t leave me behind.”

After that, Monica’s vision went dark, and she collapsed.

The doctor quickly caught her, and it sent the intensive care unit into chaos.

However, no one noticed that the man lying on the bed, who was declared to be in a vegetative state, moved his fingers.

..

In the jungle on one of the Balti Islands, Nox and Jeanne were searching for Edward’s whereabouts.

One night and one morning had passed, but where was Edward?

Even by following the direction of the gunshots, they could not find him.

“Damn it!” Nox cursed.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly. At that moment, she, too, felt like she was about to have a nervous breakdown.

Fortunately, everyone just endured it and did not give up as they continued to move forward.

Nox picked up the walkie-talkie again. “Has anyone found Fourth Master Swan?”

“No, but...” The person at the other end paused for a moment.

Jeanne and Nox instantly became a little nervous.

“But what? Tell me now!” Nox roared angrily.

The person at the other end hurriedly reported, “We found some bodies.”

“What bodies?”

“It’s not our men, so it should be the other party’s. And...”

“F*ck! Can you spit it all out!”

“Boss, why don’t you come over and see for yourself?” The person at the other end did not seem to know how to describe it.

“Give me the location!” Nox snapped.

The person at the other end quickly sent out the location information.

Nox brought Jeanne quickly to the destination.

Both their footsteps were a little fast, so it did not take long before they met up with Nox’s other group of men.

When Nox and Jeanne saw the bodies on the ground, they were really stunned.

Nox’s expression changed, and so did Jeanne’s.

It was because... it was a tragic scene.

On the ground were not bodies but parts of bodies scattered everywhere. For example, limbs, body, head…

Even though she had seen many people die, such a bloody scene still shocked Jeanne.

The ground was covered with blood and organs... It was as if some huge beast was taking revenge!

Jeanne endured the churning in her stomach and looked at Nox, whose reaction was very different from hers.

The change in his expression did not seem to be because he was frightened by the bodies in front of him but…

She could point it out, but he looked worried.

Jeanne held back her emotions and asked the man leading the team beside her, “Is Edward among them?”

She was actually afraid to confirm it herself.

“Madam, he isn’t!” The man who was leading the team was extremely respectful.

Jeanne was slightly relieved.

Suddenly, Nox came back to his senses and said to everyone, “Search everywhere for Fourth Master Swan. The moment you find him, tell me immediately. Everyone split up. Once you find him, tell me first. No one is to act rashly!”

“Yes,” everyone said respectfully.

Before Nox left, he said to Jeanne, “Let’s split up and search.”

Jeanne frowned.

“There’s no more danger here.” Nox was certain.

That made Jeanne a little puzzled.

“But when you find Fourth Master Swan, you must tell me immediately. Don’t… get close to him!”

Jeanne was stunned, and before she could react, Nox had left.

He was even more anxious than before.

What on earth happened?

However, Jeanne gritted her teeth. She decided on a direction and left quickly.
