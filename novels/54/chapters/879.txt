880 They Gave Up on Each Other

Why was Finn at her house?

Though, all she was thinking about at that moment was whether or not Finn had seen her and Michael kissing.

She bit her lip lightly, looking blankly at Finn. Michael’s kiss lingered on her lips, making her feel indescribably disgusted. She watched as Finn took in all her movements and appearances and walked past her coldly without saying a word.

He did not react to her at all. Would he not have at least some emotions about her? After all, she used to be his woman. Even if he was possessive, he should have some reaction.

It seems there was no salvaging her relationship with Finn. Last time, she bumped into Finn while she pretended to sleep with a young hunk. Other than avoiding her in disgust, he did not have any reaction either. Perhaps there was a second when he wanted to scold her, but in the end, he still remained indifferent. She had really lost Finn, and there was no getting him back again.

She smiled faintly, and a tear fell from her eyes.

The pugilistic world was a long journey. From then on, they had no more connections.

As she walked into the villa, she found her parents in the living room. Monica composed herself before raising her voice and said, “Dad, mom, I’m back.”

“Reese didn’t make things difficult for you, did she?” Ruby hurried over and asked. She knew Reese too well and could not help but worry.

“How could she? I didn’t grow up a vegetarian.” Monica did not seem to care. “Don’t you know how irritable I can be? When I’m ruthless, I won’t even care about my own family. So how would she dare bully me?”

“Even so, you still have to be careful. That woman isn’t easy to deal with.” Ruby knew her daughter would not be wronged, but she still reminded her worriedly.

“Okay.” Monica nodded and said, “Reese mentioned the dowry again. I rarely argue with her, mainly because I don’t want to mess up my plan. You guys should prepare to give it to Reese a week in advance.”

“Alright.” Ruby nodded. Mumu had told them this before.

Even though she knew the wedding was fake, after hearing the other party’s conditions and that they were not contributing a single cent, she was annoyed.

As long as they were good to Monica, the entire Cardellini business would be theirs. So why would they care about such a small amount of money?

“It’s getting late. I’ll head upstairs to wash up and sleep,” Monica said.

The moment she left, she suddenly thought of something. She asked nonchalantly, “Oh, yeah. I just saw Finn coming out of the house? ”

“Your Father’s heart hasn’t been in good condition the past two days, so we asked Finn to come over and take a look,” Ruby said. “No matter what state you and Finn are in, he’s still your father’s attending doctor and knows his condition best. We can’t just cut off all contact. Besides, even with your history with him, he’s still quite good to us. So there’s no need for us to strain our relationship with him.”

“Your relationship with him has nothing to do with me.” Monica was a little unhappy after listening to her mother’s explanation.

Did she think that she would be petty? It was just a divorce. Could they really not meet for the rest of their lives?

“By the way, is your health alright?” Monica asked Gary with concern. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Gary took a deep breath. “Finn said I’ve been under too much pressure recently, which is why I have an irregular heartbeat. He told me to relax and take my medicine on time.”

“Dad, could you stop worrying about me?” Upon hearing her father’s words, Monica felt very guilty. “I’m handling it.”

“Alright, alright. I’m not worried. I believe in you, okay?” Gary could not stand to hear Monica’s complaints.

“If anything happens to you, there’s no point in me living anymore.”

“What do you mean by that?!” Gary berated.

Monica pouted. “Anyway, you guys better take good care of your bodies. Then, watch as your daughter tears that scumbag Michael apart!”

“Alright. we’ll wait and see,” Ruby quickly chimed in. They had always held Monica in their hands, afraid she would be sad and suffer.

Monica’s eyes teared, a little moved. After so many things had happened, she did not feel that her parents’ love would be so natural.
