937 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

“Three months?” Monica was shocked.

She did not expect the situation to be so serious.

She had expected that there might be a problem with the company but not to this extent.

It was no wonder her father had to be concerned about work even when he was unwell. The problem was really pressing.

“Just three months.” Special Mr. Warren said, “Cardellini Enterprise only sells drugs for the common people. Our profit value has always been very low, and we have always been selling at a low profit. So, once our goods are returned and no pharmaceutical companies are willing to purchase our goods, we won’t have the capital to produce more products. We won’t even have the capital to feed so many employees of the Cardellini Enterprise. You should know that medical research fees take up a huge sum of money for Cardellini Enterprise. Every year, it takes up 50 percent of what Cardellini Enterprise makes.”

“I know.” Monica nodded.

His father hoped to spend more money on medical research so that they could produce more useful drugs. As for the research expenses, it would take a long time to fully cover the cost of the sales of the drugs. That was why Cardellini Enterprise’s assets had never been high even though they monopolized the pharmaceutical market in Harken!

Yet now, because they were being boycotted by the entire company, Cardellini Enterprise would declare bankruptcy in three months due to insufficient funds.

She looked at Steve. “The key point now is the vaccine. We must let the quality inspection department test whether there is a problem as soon as possible and clear Cardellini Enterprise’s name. Otherwise, our products, whether new or old, will not sell. The patients will not trust us.

“Yes,” Steve nodded.

Previously, he had never thought highly of Monica because she was too well protected by the chairman.

However, after talking to her today, he had hope for her. At least she could find the key to the problem immediately.

“What’s the quality inspection department’s progress now?” Monica asked.

“They’ve taken all of our vaccines, and we’re waiting for their final report!”

“When did they take them?”

“Yesterday. As soon as the accident happened, the vaccines we were producing and had been produced were locked up and taken away. At the same time, all the circulating vaccines on the market have also been put away.”

“How long does it usually take for the results to be out?” Monica asked.

“That’s hard to say. In fact, it isn’t difficult to inspect this batch of vaccines because they only need to test within the same batch. There’s no need to do a test on all of them. Of course, this will depend on the regulations of the quality inspection department. If they use the method of big data sampling and draw out samples for testing, the results can be out within a week. However, if they choose to test all the vaccines, I think it will take at least half a year to complete such a huge task.”

“Are you saying that we need to go to the public relations of the quality inspection department?”

“Yes.” Steve said, “If your father were here, he would have gone to ask about the test their standards. If it was a full-scale test, he would have found some connections and tried to convince them to do a sample test. After all, we can’t wait that long.”

Monica nodded.

However, as for the people from the quality inspection department…

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

She suddenly remembered that Michael was originally the head of the quality inspection department.

Even though he had fallen and someone else had taken his place, it was inevitable that he still had some connections.

If he wanted to take revenge on her, this matter would be a bottomless pit.

“Actually, I’ve always wanted to ask. What’s the current relationship between you and the former Director Ross?” Steve asked.

Even if he had stepped down, he would still have some power. Therefore, if Michael and Monica still had a good relationship, this matter could be solved very easily.

However, if…

Steve could only wait for Monica’s answer.

“He probably can’t wait to take revenge on me,” Monica said bluntly.

The little bit of hope that Steve had was extinguished.

“Can we think of a way to force the quality inspection department to issue the report in a short time?”

“I haven’t thought of it yet,” Steve said.

There were too many things to do, and without the chairman testifying, there was not much Steve could do.

Monica, of course, had nothing in mind yet.

“Currently, apart from external threats, the employees are also panicking. It’s fine for the lower-ranking employees, because to them, it’s just losing a job. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, they won’t cause too much trouble. However, the shareholders on the board of directors are also forcing us to come up with a solution to solve the current crisis…”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
