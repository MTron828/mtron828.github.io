Chapter 432: Monica’s Confesses Her Love

One night, after she got drunk, she asked to have sex with him, but he refused.

He did not want to be a tool for Monica to vent her feelings.

In fact, he was very obsessed with cleanliness, both physically and mentally, so he could not accept that Monica liked Michael and that they both had sex with each other before.

Otherwise, if he wanted to go to sleep, he would have gone to bed long ago.

He did not have to wait until that hour, but after rejecting it, he regretted it.

He still regretted it.

Lying on the bed, he tossed and turned, thinking, ‘If I had sex with Monica, would our feelings change?’

Could Monica have let go of Michael completely?

However, he was different from Monica.

He regretted it, but he could not say it out loud. He was just thinking about how to prepare for the next opportunity to improve their relationship. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He had to admit that even if he pretended to be cold, he still loved her.

In the end, he did not want… Michael to snatch her away again.

Whether it was his man’s pride or his reluctance to part, he did not want any of it.

......

In fact, on his 30th birthday, it was because Nox wanted to find a way to drink but because he wanted Nox to help him set up a meeting. Only then could he have a reasonable reason to let Monica participate. Then, he reasonably allowed Monica to accompany him on his birthday.

That night, Michael confessed to Monica, and he caught them kissing again.

He admitted that he was jealous. He was sure he could not accept Monica choosing Michael again.

Hence, he decided to confess and take the initiative for once.

He dragged Monica home, and for the first time, he forced a kiss on her.

He was even very angry.

How could Monica accept being kissed so easily? How could she be so casual about it?

As to him, no one else except for her could kiss him. No one else!

That night, he took the initiative, but she still rejected him.

She said that being with Michael was happier than being with him.

It turned out that it was too easy to miss out on a relationship, and they probably would not be able to go back to what they once were.

After that day, he gave up again and started anew with Monica.

He thought Monica’s sudden initiative toward him was probably to stop herself from being with Michael again. When Michael broke up with Monica, both families were in an awkward position, and Monica did not want to repeat the same mistake.

However, she could not stop herself from liking Michael, so she still agreed.

Then, Monica started to make a fuss about getting a divorce with her family, insisting on getting one.

It was actually good for them to get a divorce.

In that case, he did not have to feel so bad in this relationship anymore.

In fact, he was doing fine in the two years that he broke up with Monica.

Even if it hurt to think of her, he could at least be alone and use many things to numb himself. He did not have to face her every day or pretend to ignore her every day. He could have no feelings for her.

In fact, he also had a three-month deadline to live the remaining so-called married life with Monica.

If it were not for the accident… that intentional accident, he and Monica would probably have missed each other for the rest of their lives.

He looked at Monica as he listened to her confess her love.

Suddenly, he believed her.

He had always insisted that Monica liked Michael and not him. Yet, just because of a few words from her, he believed her. He believed that Monica had always liked him.

Just like him, she had not changed.

He said, “Monica.”

Monica looked at him.

It was rare to hear him call her by her name.

“In the past, I felt inferior,” Finn told her.

“Huh?” Monica was a little surprised.

Her reaction was obvious from her expression.

In fact, she was not one to hide her emotions, so how did she hide it so well that he thought she had no feelings for him?

That woman was not as heartless as he thought.

“I always feel that I’m not good enough for you,” Finn said.

“Are you stupid?” Monica seemed a little excited. “You’re so good-looking. Although you’re not the first handsome man I’ve seen, you’re definitely a man with great charm. Moreover, you’re so tall that I can’t even touch your head if I’m on my toes, and you have such good looks. Do you know that? Besides, you’re amazing in your field. Even though I don’t know how awesome you are, when I go to your hospital, I always feel proud of being Mrs. Jones.”

There was a smile on the corner of Finn’s mouth.
