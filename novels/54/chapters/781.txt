Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Eden tightened his grip on his phone.

“You won’t!” Jeanne said clearly, “And if you wouldn’t do it for him, why would Michael do it? He’s just afraid you’ll rat him out. That’s why he’s sending you away. However, sending you away isn’t the best way to protect him, but killing you is.”

Eden’s expression changed.

Then, he turned to look at Jake, who was beside him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They were already on the ship to smuggle them out of the country.

Their goal had always been clear. From the moment Michael told him to leave, their route had been perfectly planned out.

Jake drove him directly to a port in South Hampton City. At that time, the armed forces in South Hampton City had not been mobilized yet, so their journey would be smooth.

When they arrived at the sea, they took a speedboat that had been prepared beforehand and headed all the way to South Hampton City’s port. Only at that time were the armed forces mobilized, and the first thing they paid attention to was the traffic on the road instead of the sea. Hence, they could still make their move to escape.

In the afternoon, when the Sanders’s armed forces began to pay attention to the sea, they had already boarded the ship to leave Harken. Now, that ship was about to leave Harken.

Once they left the borders, none of Harkens’ armed forces could do anything to him, and he would be safe.

However, Eden’s eyes narrowed.

He had to admit that everything was going so smoothly that he found it unbelievable.

It was as if the route had been planned out a long time ago, and it was not something that had been decided in the spur of the moment.

A last-minute plan would not be so perfect.

They even planned the ship that arrived in Harken to the minute.

One had to know that ships were different from cars, trucks, and planes. There was no schedule for ships, and it would only come once in a while.

There was no way it was such a coincidence.

At that thought, Eden started to feel apprehensive.

He could not help but look at Jake.

Michael said that Jake would go overseas with him to ensure his safety, but at that moment, he suddenly felt that this person…

His wariness naturally made Jake suspicious, so Jake approached him.

Eden’s heart skipped a beat, but he forced himself to calm down. “Stay away from me.”

Jake looked at Eden coldly with a stiff face.

Then, Eden took his phone and was about to walk to the side.

He had just lifted his foot when Jake suddenly grabbed his arm and shackled him.

As Eden was about to speak, Jake raised his hand and smacked the phone away from Eden’s hand. The phone fell straight into the sea.

Eden was clearly a little frightened at that moment.

He looked at Jake, and the fear he had been suppressing began to overcome him.

If not for Jeanne’s reminder, he would not have even thought about why Michael had sent him away.

Hence, he pretended to be calm and said, “What are you doing? Now that you’ve dropped your phone in the sea, how are we going to contact Michael and my family in the future? We’re penniless now. Do you want us to starve to death overseas?”

“You don’t have to contact Mr. Ross or your family. You won’t starve to death.” Jake’s cold voice sounded exceptionally terrifying under the dark sky.

The two of them were on the deck of the ship.

Jake had just taken out his phone to report to Michael that they were about to leave Harken.

Eden had left his phone in his office when he left.

There was a GPS tracker on his cell phone, and he knew that his location would be exposed if his cell phone was monitored. That was why he did not bring it with him.

Moreover, he really did trust Michael too much. He believed that Michael was sincerely helping him.

He thought that since Jake was accompanying him overseas, Jake would definitely have a way to contact others until just a moment ago.

After Jake called Michael, Eden could not help but use Jake’s phone to call Jeanne to show off.

He had heard Michael telling Jake on the other end of the phone that the Sanders had mobilized all their forces to arrest him today. He wanted to provoke Jeanne and let her know that he was now at large and that she could not arrest him. Even if he was in a sorry state now, he had escaped that calamity!

Jake did not refuse and passed him the phone.

Eden thought that he could call Jeanne to show off that she had failed to catch him despite all her efforts.

However, unexpectedly, he made a fool of himself again.

The first thing that came to Jeanne’s mind was that Michael wanted to silence him, and he would not know it until he died.
