“But I wonder if you’d still want to marry me?” Nox asked Zoe.

Zoe looked at Nox, speechless for a long time. Just like that… it was all ruined!

Nox looked at Zoe’s hesitant expression and did not rush her to a decision. If it were him, he would not be able to accept it either.

In fact, he did not know whether he was expecting her forgiveness or something else, but suddenly, he did not feel like getting married anymore. At the same time, he thought it was a pity that they did not get married because they had been dating for so long. In short, it was all very confusing to him.

The two of them were silent for a long time.

Zoe, however, knew she had to marry Nox. Nox was the best of all the people she had dated and the person she really wanted to marry. If not for the fact that she was used to fooling around with other men and could not control herself, she would have married Nox long ago. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She thought about it and said, “Nox, I plan to forgive you.”

Nox looked at Zoe in a daze. There was no joy in his eyes. It was as if… it was not something to be happy about, but he did not reject her decision because it seemed logical.

He probably thought that since they had been together for so long, there was no way Zoe would break up with him because of that matter. Since he had expected it, his lack of reaction was normal.

“Because I love you very much, I can’t break up with you even if I want to,” Zoe said uncomfortably.

Nox was still a little touched by Zoe’s kindness and tolerance for him. “Since you just said that you were forced to do so, I’ll pretend that this never happened. However, Nox…” Zoe looked at him with tears in her eyes.

“Yes.” Nox wiped Zoe’s tears.

It seemed like Zoe was the only person in his life that he could be gentle to.

“Can you promise me one thing?” Zoe asked him.

“Tell me.”

“In the future, if I do something wrong or offend you, will you forgive me like me?” Zoe asked him.

Nox nodded. “Of course.”

He believed Zoe would not do anything to offend him.

“You can’t go back on your word.” Zoe was very serious.

She thought that no matter what, she should first get herself a ‘get out of jail free card’. Hence, if Nox found out, she could still protect herself.

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

He indulged Zoe endlessly.

At that moment, he suddenly thought of Shelly, whom he was always impatient with. He figured it must be true love when he could tolerate the people he loved endlessly.

To a woman he could never fall in love with, he would only be irritated and angry. No matter what, it was impossible for them to get along peacefully.

Having received Nox’s answer, Zoe threw herself into his arms. She then secretly make up her mind that she could never cheat on him again in the future.

Nox was so serious about her. If he really found out that she was cheating on him, Nox would definitely kill her. Even if he could not bear to kill her, seeing that he was so good to her, she should also stop all her shenanigans for him.

When Zoe left Nox’s embrace, she said seriously, “Nox, let’s have a child after we get married.”

Nox was a little stunned.

His reaction surprised Zoe. “Don’t you like children?”

Actually, she did not like children either. However, she felt that once she had a child, she might be able to stop being a playgirl. Moreover, if her previous acts were exposed, she could still rely on the child to survive.

“I do.” Nox nodded his head.

He suddenly thought about how old Shelly’s daughter was! He could not believe that Shelly was so shameless to give birth to another man’s child, and just thinking about it made him furious.

“In that case, let’s have a child soon, okay? I want to have a child with you.” Zoe hugged Nox’s arm intimately and wheedled.

“Alright.” Nox smiled.

He believed Shelly had had a great impact on his life during this period of time, so he had to do the same for her.

As for Shelly, he had nothing to do with her anymore!

In Bamboo Garden, Chloe had been here for three days, and in the past three days, she had not seen Edward at all.

He always left early and returned late. Basically, when she woke up, Edward had already left and would only return after she had gone to bed..
