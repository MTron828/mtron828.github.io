Chapter 301: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

The night was dark and calmingly quiet.

In the hall of the Bamboo Garden, Jeanne’s pleasant female voice rang out and echoed.

Edward’s hand, which was holding the wine glass, froze mid-air.

Jeanne was holding his hand, asking him very seriously if he wanted to accompany her to bed.

Well, should he?

He just kept looking at Jeanne.

Jeanne had also waited for a long time, waiting for Fourth Master Swan’s answer.

It seemed she would accept any answer.

Silence filled the space.

Jeanne did not know how long it had been, but she felt like a century had passed.

At that moment, she heard Fourth Master Swan say, “No.”

That one word “no” rang out loud and clear, rejecting her.

She felt a knot in her heart.

That was right — a knot in her heart.

Then, the corners of her mouth curled up into a smile, and she let go of Fourth Master Swan very naturally.

Edward also drank his wine very naturally.

His gaze was no longer on her.

“Fourth Master, are you really not going to reconsider?”Jeanne asked.

She was not in a hurry to leave but to confirm his decision.

Seeing Edward nodding his head, she nodded her head gently too.

“In that case, rest early, Fourth Master.” With that, Jeanne walked away from the bar counter as if it did not matter to him.

Without showing any emotions, she left.

Edward’s eyes shifted a little as he watched her leave.

She did not have any lingering feelings, nor was she reluctant to leave.

He downed the wine in his glass.

Who would have known that when he said the word “no”, his heart was torn?

...

When Jeanne opened her eyes the next day, George was not there again.

However, she was now used to it.

George was also used to it. In the morning, he had tiptoed out of bed and did not disturb her.

Sometimes, developing a habit was really a scary thing.

She clearly never had the habit of sleeping late, but she developed it here.

She stretched her body.

It was past 11 o’clock in the morning again, so she got out of bed, washed up, and went downstairs.

She had just opened the door when the melodious sound of a piano resounded in the villa.

Jeanne frowned.

Fourth Master Swan was interested in listening to George play today?

Well, it had been a long time since she had heard him play as well. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

With that, she took her time going downstairs.

In a corner of the hall, there was a black grand piano.

As Jeanne walked over, she was slightly startled.

The one playing the piano was not George, or to be precise, it was not just George alone. Fourth Master Swan was playing too.

They played together with four hands.

At that moment, Jeanne instantly noticed that pair of slender fingers moving agilely.

The melody of the piano, beautiful and moving, rang out in the villa.

It was her first time knowing that Fourth Master Swan could play the piano.

Of course, many young masters in the upper class could play the piano.

Eden could also play the piano.

It was just that...

It was just that she did not know him too well, and because the public had such a fixed view of Fourth Master Swan, they thought he would not have any interests, hobbies, or so-called specialties.

She stood not far away and watched him.

In fact, she knew nothing about playing the piano.

When she was young, she did not learn any musical instruments because her mother doted on her. However, because of George and his talents, she eventually learned a thing or two about it when he was learning the piano. Hence, she could roughly tell that Fourth Master Swan’s piano standard should not be low.

After all, with George’s current standard, it would be hard for someone who was not a professional to keep up with the speed of George’s fingers.

She just stood there, looking at the two of them — one big and one small, but there was no conflict between them.

Her eyes moved slightly.

Although she was just a few steps away from the piano, she turned around and left.

Edward looked up at Jeanne’s back and watched as she turned around coldly.

One wrong note.

George frowned.

Two wrong notes.

George’s small eyebrows furrowed even more.

More wrong notes, again and again... and it kept on going.

George turned to look at Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan looked back.

His fingers stopped, and the sound of the piano faded.

George also stopped and was, in fact, a little unhappy.

Playing the piano was the only thing he could accept doing with Fourth Master Swan. He was a little unwilling at first because he admitted that he, a genius child, occasionally has his pride. He just felt that if they were to play with two pairs of hands, normal people would not be able to keep up with his rhythm. However, because he was living under someone else’s roof, he had to compromise. He did not have any hope for Fourth Master Swan at all.

In the end, he was shocked.

He even thought that the speed of Fourth Master Swan’s fingers was faster than his.

After all, the latter’s hands were big, and his fingers were very long. The scale that Fourth Master Swan could cross was much bigger than his.

For the first time, he played very happily.
