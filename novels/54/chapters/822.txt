At the very least, he had to look more decent at the time of his death.

She returned to the warm hall on the first floor, and the sudden warmth almost made her forget how cold the basement was.

Kingsley was still waiting for her in the living room even though it was already very late in the night.

Kingsley looked at her and saw that she was only wearing a thin tank top.

“Where are your clothes?” Kingsley asked.

“I gave it to Edward,” Jeanne replied.

“Have you fallen for him?” Kingsley asked.

“Didn’t you already know?” Jeanne did not retort as she sat down opposite Kingsley.

“I warned you. You both are on different sides.”

“That’s why I didn’t say I was going to save him,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Kingsley glanced at Jeanne and lowered his head to take a puff of his cigarette.

Jeanne was sitting opposite Kingsley, and there was a long silence.

“He still didn’t say anything?” Kingsley suddenly spoke again.

He already knew the answer, yet he still asked.

“Yes.”

“I won’t show mercy. Be prepared tomorrow.”

“Bring George back to the Delta Islands,” Jeanne said.

Kingsley nodded.

He put out his cigarette and said, “It’s late. Rest early. We’ll deal with Fourth Master Swan first thing tomorrow morning, and we’ll return to the Delta Islands after that.”

“Alright.”

With that, Kingsley stood up and left the hall.

Jeanne, on the other hand, sat on the sofa quietly and looked up at the ceiling, thinking, ‘Has Edward ever thought about it? That he would die like that one day?’

Did he think it was worth it?

She, on the contrary, did not think it was worth it for Edward to die for the sake of the Duncans.

…

Under the night sky, Finn and Nox were still searching for Edward in South Hampshire.

Half of the night had passed, yet no one had sent any useful piece of news.

In such a large area, it could get overwhelming with finding their bearings.

Nox was a little irascible.

“Damn it. Don’t ever let me see Jeanne. I’ll kill her if I see her!”

Finn glanced at Nox. Not to mention Nox, even he was getting a little impatient.

It was not a solution for them to continue searching like that.

No one knew if Kingsley and his group stayed or left. If they had left, everything they were doing now would be a waste of time. They might even miss the best opportunity to rescue Edward.

Finn was also worried that his judgment was wrong.

Just as Finn and Nox were at their wits ‘end, Nox’s phone suddenly rang, “Boss, we found tire marks.”

Fired up, Nox quickly asked, “Where?”

“I’ll send you my location.”

With that, Nox hung up the phone abruptly. “They’ve found tire marks.”

Finn nodded, appearing much calmer than Nox.

Nox then told the driver to drive them to their destination.

When they arrived, the two of them got out of the car and observed the tire marks on the ground.

It should be new.

That road was full of sand. Once the wind blew, the tire marks would be blown away. That was why they could not find anything after searching for so long. Fortunately, they managed to find something. Moreover, there were many trees on that road, so there was no wind in the area.

Finn quickly instructed, “Follow the tire marks.”

“Yes.”

Finn and Nox returned to the car and drove forward according to the tire marks.

Fortunately, there was only one road here, and they could roughly determine the direction.

They drove for about two hours until suddenly, there was no road ahead. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With that, Nox and Finn got out of the car again, only to be met with a forest in front of them.

There was clearly no way out of it, and most importantly, the tire marks had also disappeared. Even the car had disappeared.

Could it be that they had left the way they came?!

Nox kicked the car angrily.

The violent sound made all of Nox’s subordinates afraid to breathe.

Finn also glanced at Nox. He could understand what Nox was feeling because he, too, was on the verge of breaking down at that moment.

Nevertheless, he tried his best to calm himself down and observe the surrounding terrain.

There was a forest ahead.

If they wanted to hide, the forest would be an excellent place. Would it be possible for Cheng Kaizhi and his company to hide in the forest?

However, if no one was chasing them, why did they have to hide?

He looked around and settled on a bush on the right.

The place was filled with tall trees. Why were there bushes here? Moreover, the bushes were about the height of a person.

Finn immediately walked over.

Nox looked at Finn and hurriedly caught up.
