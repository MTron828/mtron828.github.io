990 Live Press Conference, Intense Confrontation!

In South Hampton City, Monica woke up in the ward.

She did not wake up early because she only needed to attend the press conference in the quality inspection department at 9:30 a.m.

Hence, as soon as she woke up, she saw the doctors and nurses walking into her father’s ward for a routine checkup.

However, Finn did not come, which surprised Monica a little.

A doctor walked to Monica’s side. “Dr. Jones took a leave of absence this morning and will only be here in the afternoon.”

Monica was stunned as she looked at the assistant doctor, who usually followed Finn around.

“He needs to conserve his energy for tomorrow’s surgery,” the assistant doctor explained.

Monica smiled and said politely, “Thank you for your hard work.”

“It’s our job.” The assistant doctor said, “Because your father’s surgery is scheduled for tomorrow morning, there will be many things to take note of today before the surgery, and you must pay attention to them. Also, try your best to build your father’s confidence. Many miracles that can’t be explained by medicine are caused by willpower. To a certain extent, a man’s determination will always win.”

“Alright. We’ll have a good talk with my dad today.”

The assistant doctor smiled gently.

At that moment, the patrol doctor had finished giving instructions.

As the assistant doctor left with the rest of the group, he said to Monica, “Those were all instructions from Dr. Jones.”

“Dr. Jones is very concerned about your father’s surgery.”

“Thank you.”

“You can thank him in person after the surgery is a success.” The assistant doctor smiled and then left the ward.

While Monica stared at their backs, Ruby asked, “What did the doctor say to you just now?”

“Oh.” Monica came back to her senses. “He told us to take note of some things before dad’s surgery tomorrow. Also, he told us that there won’t be a big problem with tomorrow’s surgery and that dad should be in his best condition.”

“That’s good.” Ruby nodded silently.

Monica could fully understand her mother’s anxiety and fear because she felt the same too.

However, she believed that good people would be rewarded. Her father had done so many good things in his life, and there was no way he would leave just like that.

She said, “Mom, I have to attend a live press conference later. I’ll get my uncle to accompany you.”

“No need.” Ruby shook her head. “The surgery isn’t today anyway, so I can accompany your father. Besides, there are so many doctors, nurses, and care workers here. You can go and do your work.”

“In that case, I’ll be back after the press conference.” Monica even deliberately smiled. “I’ll bring you good news!”

“Alright.” Ruby smiled gently.

However, many emotions were hidden in her smile.

Monica left the hospital at 9 a.m. in the morning.

She was wearing a black business suit with a well-tailored blazer on top, a tight-fitting skirt on the bottom, and a white shirt on the inside. She looked like a professional woman, but she also had a slightly more imposing aura than the average. Her hair was tied into a neat and clean ponytail. and she wore a pair of black high heels on her feet. As the weather was already a little cold, Monica wore a khaki windbreaker on the outside. With a black briefcase in hand, she walked with style.

Monica and Steve had agreed to meet at the entrance of the quality inspection department.

When Steve saw Monica’s outfit, he was stunned for a few seconds.

It made Monica wonder if she was overdressed.

She could not help but ask, “Is this too much?”

“No.” Steve quickly came back to his senses. “I just felt a little emotional.”

“What’s wrong?”

“The first time I saw you, you were only this tall and wearing a pink princess dress. You went to the chairman’s office and tore up all the important documents. The chairman was pissed off, but he didn’t dare to scold you. From then on, all the employees in the company knew that you were the chairman’s precious little princess and that you couldn’t be scolded or beaten.” Steve could not help but say, “I never thought that you would be able to take charge one day.”

As he was much older, he sounded like an elder.

Monica’s mind was also filled with images of her father doting on her.

She said, “My father will grow old eventually, so I have to learn to grow up.”

“I’m sure the chairman will be very pleased with your change,” Steve said sincerely.

“Of course.” Monica looked confident.
