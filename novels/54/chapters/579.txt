Chapter 580: Monica and Finn’s Relationship Ended A Long Time Ago!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The door was shut tight.

Monica watched in a daze as tears streamed down her face like crazy.

She knew Finn was angry about the matter, and he had every right and reason to be angry. However, she did not expect that Finn would... do that.

She always thought he knew she liked him, so he should know that she would come back to him after she helped Michael.

Even though everyone was trying to persuade her otherwise, she always believed that she could get back together with Finn.

She bit her lip, trying to calm herself down by telling herself that Finn was just still angry.

Moreover, he was always so petty and vengeful, so he would not let go so quickly. Otherwise, Finn would not have stayed in the marriage for three years.

If she gave him more time, it would be fine.

It was just… At the thought that a woman, who was not Patsy but someone else, was in Finn’s room, she felt terrible.

It was a heart-wrenching pain.

How could Finn do that?

Her tears streamed down her face.

It was the first time she felt so powerless.

In the house, Finn returned to the living room and sat on the sofa with a long face.

He had really thrown away all of Monica’s things because he thought she would not want them anymore.

Never did he expect that she would suddenly come by today and run into the woman Nox found for him.

He never thought of letting that woman in, but that woman begged him bitterly, telling him about her situation at home and what would happen if he did not want to sleep with her. She said if he did not let her in, she would wait for him at the door... He was not soft-hearted. He just called her in just to explain things calmly and told her to stop pestering him.

Little did he know that when he finally managed to convince the woman to give up the idea of sleeping with him after some time, Monica showed up.

To him, their divorce was a real separation.

Moreover, he was not childish enough to want to deliberately hurt her.

As to the matters of the heart, they would disappear into thin air one day, and it was just a matter of time.

In fact, he was more accepting than the average person.

Since young, he had learned to accept it. Therefore, no matter how uncomfortable he felt, he could still get through it.

His eyes moved as he watched the woman who waited for him in his room walk out of the bedroom. She was probably a little unsure about waiting, so she came out again.

She looked at him carefully and said, “Sir, can we do it now?”

For a moment, the thought of having sex with a random woman did cross Finn’s mind.

Besides, he did not need to keep his innocence for anyone.

Perhaps it was because of his natural obsession with cleanliness, but it made him give up that split-second urge.

After all, one-night stands could never exist in his books.

He looked at the time.

From the moment he closed the door until now… He did not know if Monica had left.

Whether she left or not, he just wanted Monica to understand that when she chose to return to Michael’s side, her relationship with him was over!

It was not that he was petty or lowly, but his feelings just could not take her indecisiveness anymore.

He said, “How much did Nox give you?”

“Huh?” The woman was startled.

Who was Nox?

Finn thought for a moment and guessed that Nox must have found someone else. He asked again, “How much did he pay you to sleep with me?”

“200 thousand dollars,” the woman said.

200 thousand dollars? How generous of Nox.

He said, “He paid quite a lot.”

The woman quickly nodded. “I know, so I will definitely serve you well. I will.”

It was obvious that she was afraid of him chasing her out.

“I won’t take my money back, but I won’t sleep with you either.”

The woman looked at him in a daze.

“However, since it’s 200 thousand dollars, you should be able to help me with a small favor.”

“Sir, are you sure you don’t want it?” the woman asked him carefully. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Finn nodded.

“It’s my first time, and I’ve done a test. This is the result.” The woman took out a piece of paper from her clothes.

“I don’t mind if it’s your first time, but I have my principles.” Finn did not even glance at the report in the woman’s hand. He was indifferent to it.
