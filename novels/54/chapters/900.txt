901 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

He maintained his calm and could not make any noise, or he would be discovered immediately.

He gently placed the ceiling he had removed on the roof of the toilet, grabbed both sides of the hole in the ceiling with both hands, and jumped. Using the strength of his arms, he propped his body up. With as little noise as possible, he climbed to the ceiling and exposed his entire body above the toilet. Then, with little to no noise at all, he covered the ceiling he had taken down.

The moment he covered that ceiling, the door of the toilet was kicked open.

There was no one inside.

Lucy’s eyes flickered.

Could it be that they had lost them?

She clearly saw the waiter leave, and the only place he could hide was this public toilet. She had been careless just now and went to the men’s room first. Only after patrolling around did she realize that the person might have hidden in the women’s room because the first reaction of a person was that a man would definitely go into the men’s room. However, that person had gone in the opposite direction, which proved that his anti-detection ability was astonishing.

Due to the time difference, it was possible for the person to escape safely.

Lucy’s expression was a little ugly because she had lost that person.

However, where did this person leave from?

No matter if it was the men’s washroom or the women’s washroom, there were no windows and no escape routes.

She looked up and down for a long time, trying to find a way for that person to escape. Only then would she have a higher chance of finding that person!

With the thought that the person might still be in the toilet, she carefully searched the toilet again until she heard Kingsley’s voice in her ear, asking her, “Did you manage to get him?”

Lucy looked around. After confirming that the person had escaped from her, she said, “I lost him.”

Kingsley’s face darkened.

“It’s my mistake,” Lucy admitted.

“We’ll talk about it when we get back. Return to the banquet hall now and cooperate with the Sanders’ search.” Kingsley did not seem to want to say much, but his tone sounded quite unpleasant.

“Yes.” Lucy accepted the order.

While Lucy was searching for Finn in the toilet, Finn put on the clothes he had placed on in the ceiling at the fastest speed and then quickly climbed to the ground. After that, he left the toilet without making a sound and went to the designated place to meet the woman waiting for him.

Sarah was a little excited when she saw Finn.

Just as she was about to call out to him, Finn went over and pushed her against the big tree behind her. Then, he took her into his arms and lowered his head. His lips were close to her lips. They did not kiss, but to outsiders, it looked like a kiss.

Sarah’s heart raced as she did not expect Finn to suddenly do that, and neither could she figure out what was going on.

From the beginning, she was a little confused.

Last night, at about 1 a.m. in the morning, Finn called her.

When she saw the caller ID, she thought that her eyes were playing tricks on her, and when she answered, she felt like she was dreaming.

Why would Finn take the initiative to call her? She was so excited that she could not control herself.

It took her great effort to suppress her excitement and answer the call. Then, she heard Finn say, “I’ll go with you to Monica’s wedding banquet tomorrow.”

At that, Sarah felt a little disappointed and upset.

“You still can’t let it go?” Sarah asked, “Or are you going to snatch the bride?”

“I just want myself to give up on her completely.” Finn said, “If it’s not okay, forget it–”

“No, it’s fine,” Sarah quickly said.

As long as it was Finn’s request, she would agree.

“I don’t want anyone else to know that I’m going to the wedding banquet tomorrow.”

“I won’t tell anyone,” Sarah promised. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Early in the morning the next day, Finn was waiting for her outside Monica’s villa.

Therefore, when she left for the wedding venue, she did not leave with the wedding car. Instead, she went in Finn’s car, which arrived even earlier than the wedding car.

One had to verify their identity before one could enter the wedding venue. Since Sarah was Monica’s cousin, there were relatives arranged by the Cardellinis in charge of receiving them. When they saw it was Sarah, she was immediately let in without needing to show any wedding invitation.

After entering, Finn parked the car and left directly after saying that he did not want anyone to see him.

Then, throughout the entire wedding banquet, she could not find Finn no matter how hard she tried. She did not even know which corner he was hiding in.
