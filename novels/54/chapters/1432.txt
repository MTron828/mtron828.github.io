Thank you readers!

Monica shuddered.

“You won’t.”

“I will.” Monica enunciated each word.

“If that’s really the case, I can’t stop it,” Finn said calmly.

His voice was very soft. It was as if he had made all the preparations and was unafraid of the outcome.

Monica gritted her teeth. Finn was such a scheming man, and there was no way she could lie to him.

Hence, she said, “Finn, I really hate the current you.”

“Me, too.” Finn looked at Monica. “I hate myself too. I hate myself for being so stupid. I hate myself for making you so disappointed.”

Monica pursed her lips. It was not that she could not continue the conversation, but her stomach was churning again.

When she was asleep, the world was peaceful, and she felt perfectly fine. However, as soon as she woke up, her body started to reject her like crazy, as if it was not hers.

She had held it in for as long as she could but could not hold it in any longer. As such, she lifted the blanket and got up.

Finn watched as Monica tried to reach out to take out the needle for the IV drip, but he then helped her take it off.

He said, “Do you need to go to the toilet?”

Seeing that Monica did not answer and went straight to the bathroom, Finn followed her.

Monica had just walked into the bathroom when Finn heard her heart-wrenching vomiting, and it sounded painful. Finn did not expect the side effects of Monica’s pregnancy to be so serious.

At that moment, she was leaning on the sink and puking so much that her body was curled up. However, she did not vomit much. She just felt uncomfortably sick.

Suddenly, a pair of warm hands approached Monica’s back. Although Monica was against it, her body did not allow her to push him away.

She felt his large hand on her back, caressing her back as if he was trying to make her feel better.

“Ugh…” Monica vomited again.

Finn’s large hand pressed on her back even more.

After vomiting for some time, Monica seemed to feel a little better. She then rinsed her mouth and cleaned her face with clear water.

Just as she was about to wipe it with a tissue, a tissue appeared in front of her. She hesitated for a moment but ended up picking it up and wiping the corner of her mouth with it.

Once she was done with the tissue, she threw it into the trash can and was about to leave. However, Finn bent down and picked her up horizontally.

Stunned, Monica instinctively hugged Finn’s neck. That instinctive reaction made Finn excited for a while. He finally felt like he was needed.

Finn placed Monica on the bed and covered her with a blanket.

“Have your morning sickness and nausea always been so serious?” Finn asked her.

Monica did not answer his question.

“When did it start?”

Still, Monica did not answer his question

However, Finn did not seem to care. “Usually, nausea and morning sickness will last for three months. Most people’s symptoms will lessen after three months, and they might even feel normal again.”

It would take three months?

Monica was on the verge of breaking down. She felt that if her nausea continued for another day, she would not be able to take it anymore. However, she did not expect that it would take three months!

“Actually, nausea and morning sickness can be alleviated. When medical intervention is unnecessary — for example, if you’re throwing up badly and it affects your metabolism, most cases will suggest for you to improve your condition through mood and diet.” Finn used very professional terms to explain to Monica some pregnancy knowledge, which she knew nothing of.

Even though Monica did not say a word, she listened seriously. She really admired Finn when it came to anything medical.

“Since you have nausea and morning sickness, you have to eat something. But at this stage, you must have something easier on the stomach. If it’s too greasy, it will make you feel worse.” Finn suddenly asked, “Are you hungry?

Monica still did not answer him.

“When the nausea is bad, you mustn’t go on an empty stomach. Once your stomach is empty, you will feel worse.”

At that moment, Monica’s eyes flickered. She reached out and pressed the call button.

As Finn watched Monica’s actions, the corners of his mouth curled into a smile. Even though Monica did not talk to him, at least, she listened to everything he said.

“I would like some soup and bread,” Monica said bluntly.

“Alright, Ms. Cardellini.. What kind of soup would you like? We have tomato, pumpkin, mushroom…”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
