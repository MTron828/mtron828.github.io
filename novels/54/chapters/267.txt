Chapter 268: Finn’s Apology

At that moment, Monica saw Finn open the car door, get out of the car, walk toward her, and carry her again.

Monica was shocked again.

She was shocked but acquiesced to Finn’s actions.

When they reached home, Finn placed her on the sofa.

After putting her down, he took out the medicine box in the house.

It was different from the usual first aid kits at home. Monica did not know where it was usually placed, but it was a special medical box. She had never seen it before.

Monica looked at Finn’s tall medical box and saw that it was the same as the one at Fourth Master Swan’s place. It had everything, which was surprising for Monica.

Finn took out tweezers and cotton and smeared it with iodine. He said to Monica, “Bear with the pain.”

Monica did not reply.

She felt an unbearable pain coming from her knees.

“Ah!” Monica could not endure it.

She screamed.

This was much more painful than when she went downstairs.

She was in so much pain that tears were streaming down her face.

Nonetheless, Finn did not stop cleaning her wounds. He was very indifferent as if he was used to treating her wounds.

“Ouch, ouch, ouch. Finn, stop it. It hurts, it hurts...” Monica could not stand the pain anymore.

She called out to Finn loudly.

It really hurt.

“Hold on.” Finn’s cold voice was emotionless.

“I don’t want to. Give me an anesthetic. I can’t stand it anymore!” Monica shouted.

She did not know how those people could endure the pain.

Monica had only hurt her knees a little, but it was a serious fall. The medicine was killing her. Those people were hurt so severely. How could they endure it?

Anyway...

Monica could not take it anymore.

She suddenly pushed Finn away.

She was very strong.

Finn was squatting in front of her. He was pushed away.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

Monica was in so much pain that her face was twisted. She noticed Finn’s expression at that moment.

She said, “I’m not that brave. I can’t take it anymore. Anyway, it’s not like this is the first time you’ve looked down on me!”

Finn pursed his lips.

“You should leave quickly. I know how to deal with my wounds.”

“Do you know how to treat them?” Finn’s eyes narrowed.

Monica admitted that she did not know how to treat them for the time being.

It was too painful.

It was so painful that she wanted to die.

“I only need five minutes,” Finn said again.

“Five minutes won’t do,” Monica was very sure.

She did not want to endure the process anymore.

That feeling was killing her.

“You know that if you don’t treat your wounds, it might cause infection. The consequences could even be so serious that you’ll need to amputate your leg!”

‘You’re lying to me!

‘I only scraped my knees!

‘Finn, you must have a f*cking grudge on me from our previous lives.

‘Why are you cursing me like this?!’

“I’ll try my best to treat them as quickly as possible...” As Finn spoke, he stretched out his hands again.

“I’ll go to the hospital!” Monica insisted.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

“I’ll go to the hospital to deal with them. I don’t need you to do it,” Monica said fiercely, “Return my phone to me.”

Finn had snatched her phone away.

He still had not returned it to her.

Finn’s expression darkened.

“I’ll call Micheal and ask him to send me to the hospital. Hurry up and leave.” Monica could not wait to chase Finn away.

She was = afraid that he would treat her wound again.

She was in so much pain.

Finn looked at Monica coldly. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Monica did not care.

She could not care less at this moment. She reached out to touch Finn’s pocket, wanting to take out her phone.

However, just as she reached out, her hand was suddenly restrained by Finn.

Monica felt pain.

How much strength did Finn use?

Monica’s eyes reddened from the pain.

“Finn, what do you want to do?!” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

What kind of sin had she committed to meet Finn?

Was she so evil in her past life that she had to be punished like this in this life?!

“I’ll help you,” Finn enunciated each word clearly.

He sounded as though Monica was not allowed to resist him.

“I said I don’t need your help!” Monica roared angrily, “I can find a doctor to help me. I don’t want you to do it! Let me go—f*ck, let me go!”

Monica was furious.

She kept trying to break free from Finn’s grip, but she could not break free no matter how hard she tried.

“Finn, what did I do wrong? Why do you have to do this to me?!” Monica could not resist. She stopped resisting and questioned Finn harshly, “How do you want to torture me so that you’ll be satisfied?! It’s the same every time. When I ask for your help, you can’t help me at all. When I don’t want you, you force me instead! How much do you want me to suffer in front of you for the rest of my life so that you’ll be happy?!”

Finn looked at Monica coldly.

He watched as her emotions exploded.

Monica could not bear it anymore. After all, she was not someone who could hide her feelings. At this moment, she told Finn everything, “Tonight, when Jeanne and I were being chased, you weren’t there when I needed you so much. You didn’t even pick up your phone. Do you know how desperate I was? Now, everything is in the past. It’s in the past. Can you just stay away from me? Can we just stay as far away from each other as possible?!”

Finn’s throat was trembling as his Adam’s apple bobbed up and down.

He seemed to be suppressing his emotions as well. He seemed to feel a little uncomfortable after hearing Monica’s words.

He admitted that he felt guilty after not picking up Monica’s call.

At that time, after the banquet, he received an emergency call from the hospital saying that he was going to save a patient who had a sudden heart attack.

He rushed over and handed his cell phone to his assistant. Then, he quickly entered the resuscitation room.

Fortunately, the heart attack was discovered in time. It did not take long for him to save the patient.

The moment Finn walked out of the resuscitation room, his assistant said that Monica had called him. He quickly took his cell phone.

Looking at the countless missed calls on his cell phone, he knew that something must have happened.

Finn quickly called back.

The other party did not pick up.

At that time, Monica did not see it. She was completely focused on trying to meet Fourth Master Swan. She did not notice that her phone was ringing.

Finn called Jeanne again, but Jeanne did not pick up either.

He knew that something big must have happened.

Instead of going home, he rushed straight to the Swans’ manor.

He had a feeling that something had happened to Jeanne because she had been targeted by someone recently.

That was why Finn went to Bamboo Garden first. He heard Teddy say that Monica had gone to look for Fourth Master Swan, but Fourth Master Swan was with Old Master Swan, so he went over without caring about anything else. Once he arrived, he saw that Monica was thrown out by Grandpa Wade.

Finn pursed his lips tightly.

He could completely imagine how desperate Monica was when she asked him for help.

In fact, he knew everything.

He just did not want to show it.

The atmosphere was a little tense at this time.

After Monica shouted, she seemed to have calmed down.

In fact, how could she blame Finn?

Finn was a doctor. It was his responsibility to save the lives of the injured. Of course, he had to save the patient at the first moment. What right did she have to blame him?

Moreover, taking a step back…

Why did Finn have to answer her calls? Why did he have to answer her calls 24 hours a day?

Who was she?!

“I’m sorry,” Finn suddenly said.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

At this moment, she thought that she had heard wrongly.
