Thank you readers!

That day, Monica had just gotten off work and they bumped into each other, so they went back together.

“Just say what you want to say.” Finn really did not know where the other party was heading with that.

“Did you guys break up again?” Dr. West asked.

“Temporarily , ” Finn replied.

That was right. He had not given up.

That night, he was so angry that she almost died, but in the end, he refused to give up. He was planning to woo Monica back. “That’s great!” Dr. West suddenly said loudly.

Finn frowned.

Seemingly having realized that he had expressed himself wrongly, Dr. West quickly said, “I didn’t mean it that way. What I mean is that Monica is pregnant with your children now, but because you two broke up, she plans to abort it. I just wanted to inform you, in case there was some misunderstanding between the two of you. However, women are usually more impulsive. Not to mention, she’s carrying twins. It would be a pity if she aborted it…”

“What did you say?” It took Finn a long time before he realized what the doctor had said.

Did he say that Monica was pregnant? How could Monica be pregnant? They had not been together for a long time.

Oh, right. That night, he lost control and forced himself on Monica. However, he thought that Monica would take the necessary precautions herself. After all, that was always the case, and there was no way she had forgotten to do it after they broke up.

Monica did not even want to have children. Now that they had broken up, it was even more impossible for her to want to give birth to his children.

Finn’s fingers seemed to be trembling.

“Monica is pregnant with twins,” Dr. West repeated.

Finn finally reacted by asking, “Where is Monica?”

“In the inpatient ward of the gynecology and obstetrics department.”

Finn abruptly hung up the phone, picked up his car keys, and drove frantically to the hospital. He seemed to be venting all his emotions on his driving, and it was hard for him to calm down.

After he got out of the car, he quickly went to the gynecology and obstetrics department and walked to Monica’s ward. However, he did not open the door to enter when he arrived. He just stood stiffly at the door and saw Brandon accompanying Monica.

Monica’s face was somewhat pale. It was obvious that she was in low spirits. Meanwhile, Brandon was peeling fruits for her, and the two of them were talking.

Brandon said, “Just think about it. After all, having twins is rare. I have so many friends around me, and none of them are twins.”

Monica did not answer him.

Brandon peeled the apple, cut it into pieces, put it on the fork, and handed it to Monica.

However, Monica did not have any appetite now. It was a reaction from the pregnancy that made her not want to eat anything. She just wanted to throw up.

“Eat some. The doctor said that you should at least eat something,” Brandon said gently. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica hesitated for a moment but still took a small piece and slowly put it into her mouth. She endured the discomfort in her stomach and ate it in small bites.

“Do you want me to inform your parents?” Brandon asked when he saw how weak Monica looked.

“No!” Monica directly refused.

Once her parents were notified, there was no way she could abort the children in her belly.

They had been looking forward to it for many years, so she could imagine how extreme her parents would be if she said no. Just thinking about it scared her.

“Should I inform Finn?” Brandon asked.

Monica shot him a look.

“I just don’t think this is your problem alone. If you really want to make any decision, you can discuss it with Finn.”

“Do you think there’s anything to discuss between him and me? Once he finds out that I’m pregnant, do you think he’ll let me go? It wasn’t easy for me to get rid of him.” In Monica’s heart, the intense argument that day was the end of her relationship with Finn.

Finn could not keep trying to please her with no end. Eventually, he would get tired of it and give up. However, if he knew that she was pregnant, she believed that Finn would soon ask to be with her again.

It was not that Finn was afraid of losing her. He just had a strong sense of responsibility and would never let her take care of the children alone.

“Are you really not going to reconcile with Finn?” Brandon asked.

“I won’t.” Monica gave an affirmative answer.

“I’ve always thought as long as there’s no third party interfering, two people can stay together.. What did Finn do to make you give up on him to this extent?”
