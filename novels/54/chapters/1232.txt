1233 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise

They chatted around the baby in her stomach, and as they chatted, Jeanne felt sleepy.

At that moment, she was half-lying on the sofa. She had planned to go to sleep when she passed by the room, but she was suddenly attracted by everything in the room. Then, because it was past her sleeping time and she was a little excited, she did not feel sleepy.

Now that it was quiet, she fell asleep in a daze.

Edward was still talking, and when he did not hear a response, he turned around, only to see that Jeanne had fallen asleep with her eyes closed.

Her breathing was very light, and she slept very quietly.

Edward’s throat moved, and he reached his hand out. It was probably only after she had fallen asleep that he would dare to reach out and touch her cheek.

Although she had gained a lot of weight and her complexion was good, why was it so heartbreaking?

Edward bent down and gently picked Jeanne up from the sofa. Now that she was pregnant, it was very uncomfortable to sleep on the sofa with such a round body.

He carried her back to her room and gently placed Jeanne on the bed, which sunk quite a bit. However, Jeanne was still sound asleep, whereas, in the past, she was very easily awakened.

Was it because she had let go of her conflicted thoughts and let down her guard against her surroundings that she felt much more at ease now?

He put her down but did not leave. His eyes continued to stare at Jeanne’s sleeping face.

As he watched, he lowered his head and planted a deep kiss on her soft, warm lips. He had never expected that one day, he would have to be intimate with her in secret…

In the room, the phone suddenly rang.

The noise woke Jeanne up, and her eyebrows furrowed. As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw a magnified face in front of her, and her lips were filled with his touch.

Jeanne pushed Edward away.

However, the moment she pushed him away, she felt his kiss deepen. The more she resisted, the closer he got.

“Mm…” Jeanne obviously did not want to be close to him.

The second she opened her mouth to protest, his tongue slipped between her lips and teeth.

“Ed– Mm…” Jeanne pushed him away.

The more she pushed him away, the tighter he seemed to hug her.

If Edward’s kiss was purely intimate, just to get closer to her, just to hug her tightly in his arms, just to feel her existence, the current Edward was really barbaric and also… lustful.

“No...” Jeanne pushed him away with all her might.

Her resistance was obvious. However, Edward did not seem to hear her, and he was filled with hostility.

He kissed her so hard on the lips that she could not say a word…

“Mm!” Edward suddenly stopped.

It was because Jeanne’s teeth were biting his lips hard. Not only did the pain make him stop, but it also seemed to have pulled him back to reality.

His throat moved slightly, and he looked at the woman who was lying under him with a face full of anger.

Having returned to his senses, his lips left her lips. That was when he saw the blood on her lips. It was probably the blood from her bite that flowed to her lips.

He wanted to reach out to wipe it for her, but at that moment, Jeanne had wiped her lips with her hand with… disgust.

Edward shifted his gaze away, probably not wanting to see her actions, and got up from Jeanne.

He said, “Sorry.”

Jeanne did not answer. Instead, she turned around clumsily with her back facing him.

Then, the phone that was not picked up just now rang again. Edward’s eyes flickered. He took out his phone, looked at the caller ID, and walked out.

As he walked out, he closed the door behind him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As soon as the door closed, someone burst into tears.

…

Edward left the Swan family’s compound and went to the Gates’ family villa to pick up Susan.

Susan was wearing a bright yellow dress and exquisite light makeup. Her long hair was straight and draped over her shoulders, making her look like the girl next door. Due to her tall figure and beautiful facial features, her simple outfit made her look a little high-class.

When Susan sat in Edward’s car, she said frankly, “I thought you forgot that we had a candlelight dinner tonight.”

Edward did not reply to her and instructed the chauffeur to drive them to their destination.

As if she was used to Edward’s coldness, Susan smiled nonchalantly and turned to look at the street outside the car window.
