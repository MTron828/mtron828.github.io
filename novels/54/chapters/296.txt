Chapter 297: Jeanne Stays, and Fourth Master Swan Confesses

Jeanne was stunned.

Nox also thought that he had heard wrongly.

He always felt that with Fourth Master Swan’s temper, he could either tell Jeanne to scram or make her die.

Edward would definitely not try to persuade Jeanne to stay.

“If you haven’t tried, how do you know that feelings can’t be developed?” Edward said calmly.

No other emotions could be seen on his calm face.

“Fourth Master, don’t you have any pride?” Jeanne tore through his disguise.

“I don’t need to have any pride in front of you, Ms. Lawrence.”

“Didn’t I make myself clear just now? Feelings need to be built on the basis of mutual affection...”

“I only need you for a week.”

Jeanne was stunned.

“If you still insist on leaving after a week, Ms. Lawrence, I’ll let you go.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne frowned.

She did not agree immediately.

The condition was very tempting.

However...

How could Jeanne guarantee that he would not go back on his word?

“Nox,” Edward called out to the onlooker at the side.

Nox was a little overwhelmed by the sudden summon. He quickly walked over.

“I’ll use Nox as collateral.” Edward was straightforward.

‘What?!’

Nox’s eyes were about to pop out!

Jeanne was also... dumbfounded.

“Miles is one of yours?” Edward asked.

“Yes.”

“He’s now in my custody. I’ll let him out and let him detain Nox. If I go back on my word a week later, you can exchange Nox with me,” Edward said clearly.

Nox was about to explode. “Fourth Master Swan, am I not your bro?”

‘Am I not your bro who risks his life for you?!’

“He’s the most important and most suitable person I can think of.” Edward ignored Nox and spoke directly to Jeanne.

Nox’s heart moved, and he could not help but smile.

‘The most important person?!

‘What did Fourth Master Swan say? He said that I’m the most important person around him.

‘He suddenly became so corny

‘Well!

‘I’ve always been a loyal person. As a bro, I would do anything!’

Jeanne was a little quiet.

She knew very well that this was Fourth Master Swan’s bottom line. She could not negotiate any more terms with him.

Jeanne said, “Okay.”

She agreed to it.

Not to mention a week.

Even if it was a month, a year, ten years…

What could not be changed could not be changed.

“Teddy.” Fourth Master Swan’s voice was a little loud.

Actually, he had noticed that Teddy had been secretly watching them from the guardrail on the second floor.

Teddy was summoned.

He was shocked, but he hurriedly ran downstairs.

“Let Miles out,” Fourth Master Swan ordered.

Teddy quickly ran to the other side.

Then, he brought Miles out.

Miles looked at Jeanne in surprise.

They looked at each other.

They did not say anything.

Edward said, “I’ll leave Nox to you.”

Miles was confused.

‘Is he in a daze?!

‘Is he sleepwalking?’

Nox took the initiative and walked toward Miles. “You should feel extremely honored to be able to take me as your hostage.”

“...” Miles was even more confused.

Jeanne walked toward Miles.

If it was anyone else, they would feel that this was a little unbelievable.

Jeanne briefly told Miles what happened.

Miles looked at Jeanne in disbelief.

Jeanne also felt that it was unbelievable.

That said, it was the truth.

Jeanne said, “Thank you for the trouble.”

Miles calmed himself down and nodded.

The moment he nodded, he restrained Nox with his hands.

“F*ck, be gentle,” Nox shouted.

He was restrained by Miles and left Bamboo Garden.

When Nox left, he did not forget to shout at the people inside, “Fourth Master Swan, I have sacrificed so much for you. You have to work harder!”

“...”

Nox and Miles left.

Only Edward, Jeanne, and George were left in the hall.

Teddy could be ignored.

At this moment, he had tactfully returned to his room.

Suddenly, only Edward, Jeanne, and George were left.

Jeanne did not know how to face Fourth Master Swan for a second.

She heard him say, “It’s getting late. Bring George back to his room to rest.”

Jeanne looked at him.

After saying that, Edward turned around and went upstairs.

Jeanne frowned.

‘Isn’t he afraid that I would leave with George?!’

On second thought, since Fourth Master Swan was able to leave like this, he could definitely guarantee that Jeanne would not be able to leave.

Moreover, it was only a week.

Jeanne did not have the habit of going back on her word.

She lowered her head to look at George.

George looked up at her too.

Jeanne smiled. “Just for a week.”
