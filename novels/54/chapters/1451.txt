Chapter 1452: Stirring Up Trouble

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice turned to look at Edward, who also turned to look at her. The two of them seemed to have a telepathic connection, but they did not say anything to each other.

Soon, the private doctor rushed to the Nicholsons’ courtyard.

Chloe’s hand was scalded. There were red and swollen blisters on it, and some of the skin had come off, making it look extremely hideous.

“It hurts.” Candice was in so much pain that her tears kept falling when the medicine was applied. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Mom, what happened to Aunt?” Paige was horrified when she saw the scene.

“Aunt was scalded by the hot soup just now, and it hurts a lot. Paige, you have to be careful in the future. Don’t hurt yourself, okay?” Candice coaxed Paige gently.

Candice was educating the child, but Chloe heard it differently. She thought what Candice meant was that it was her own fault for being careless and it had nothing to do with Candice.

‘That woman is smart enough to absolve herself of responsibility, huh?’ Chloe gritted her teeth in pain and frustration.

“Look at you. You’re so old, yet you can’t even hold the bowl of soup properly,” Claire criticized Chloe despite feeling a little sorry for Chloe.

“I’ve never done it before. I just wanted to treat my sister better, but I didn’t expect myself to be so clumsy…”

“I know you have a good relationship with your sister, but you have to act within your capabilities,” Claire said dotingly.

Candice found it funny that they were making a big deal out of a bowl of soup.

“I’ll be more careful next time.” Chloe nodded, feeling wronged.

By then, the doctor had bandaged Chloe’s hand.

He reminded her, “Second Young Lady, the burns on your hand are very serious, but I’ve already bandaged your wounds. Be careful not to get it wet and try not to irritate the wound, or it could get easily infected. Once the wound is infected, it will be much more serious than the original injury.” “Alright.” Claire quickly said, “I’ll take good care of her. Thank you.” “As I should,” the private doctor said respectfully.

“Mom, aren’t you and Dad going on a trip tomorrow?” Chloe suddenly said.

“How can we go with your condition? I’ll stay at home with you.”

“How can that do? You guys are usually so busy, and you can only go on a trip once a year. This has always been the rule since you got married. How can you change it just like that?”

“So what if I don’t go once? We can go next year or postpone it.” “Dad has applied for his annual leave. How can he change it just like that?” “You child-”

“I’ll go to Candice’s house.” Chloe suddenly said, “Since you’re worried about me being alone at home, I’ll go to her house for a week. After all, I have a good relationship with her, and I’m sure she won’t mind it if I stay with her for a bit.

Isn’t that right, Sister?”

Chloe’s eyes were filled with anticipation, and her face looked innocent.

Candice smiled. “Alright.”

It turned out Chloe was putting on an act tonight just to go to Edward’s house. Since she knew Chloe’s motive, she did not reject her.

She just wanted Chloe to know her place. Otherwise, Chloe might think she was omnipotent.

“I knew you were the best.” Chloe was very excited. She then said to her parents, “Dad, Mom, this way, you can go on a vacation without worrying about me.”

Claire thought it was a good idea, but Wyatt, on the other hand, was worried. He said to Edward, “Look, will it affect you—”

“Candice’s sister is my sister. Besides, Candice has the final say in everything at home.”

It meant that Candice could do whatever she wanted.

At that, Chloe’s expression darkened again. Candice was not usually good at seducing men, so how could she have Edward under her thumb?

Could it be that Candice had fawned over Edward’s daughter? For men with children, their children were their soft spot.

She sneered to herself. Ever since she was young, her greatest ability had been her affinity with people. She refused to believe that she could not bribe a child. Not only would she bribe them, but she even wanted to use them.

“In that case, can I go with you tonight? Mom and Dad will be leaving South Hampton City by plane early tomorrow morning,” Chloe said.

“As long as it’s convenient for you.” Candice nodded.

She did not sound too keen but did not reject the idea.

“Helen,” Chloe called out to the maid at home. “Pack some clothes for me, but nothing too much. Just something that can be used in daily life will do.”

“Yes, Second Young Lady.”

In fact, Chloe had already prepared her luggage.

She had never failed in getting anything she wanted to do, including Edward.. She had to get him!
