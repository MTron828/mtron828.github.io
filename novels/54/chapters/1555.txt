Chapter 1556: Monica Gets Jealous

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica and the person in charge of the other company sat together, whereas Brandon was sitting on the other side, with Finn next to Brandon.

Next to Finn was the secretary of the other company, a female secretary. Then, it was followed by some of the senior executives of the other company.

They were all chatting at the dining table, and the atmosphere was lively. Most of the time, it was Monica and the other party’s person in charge chatting, and the others would occasionally chime in and agree.

‘Mr. Jones, how do you find the food here?” Wendy Hanse, the other company’s secretary, asked in a low voice.

Finn’s gaze was fixed on Monica. However, when he heard a voice beside his ear, he turned back to look at Wendy. “It’s pretty good, thank you.”

He kept his manners. After all, as Monica’s secretary today, he could not embarrass her.

“I saw you ate very little, so I thought it didn’t suit your tastebuds.” Wendy chuckled. “Try our local wild porcini pasta with bacon. It’s considered a specialty of our capital.”

As she spoke, she took the initiative to put some food on Finn’s plate.

“Thank you.” Finn thanked her with a smile.

Wendy also smiled back at him.

Monica saw their interaction, but she only took a glance at them before chatting with the person in charge again. She did not seem to react to that.

Since there was no drinking at that lunch, Wendy did not have to serve the guests wine or take care of the guests as it would seem too pretentious if she did. However, as a secretary, she had to take the initiative to interact with the guests, and the person closest to her was Finn. Hence, she was very attentive to him throughout the entire meal.

Finn naturally accepted everything she did for him. After all, he could not make things difficult for Monica.

After lunch, the other company first took them to the company’s private lounge to rest for an hour before taking them to visit their pharmaceutical factory.

As they knew that Monica was pregnant, they made sure to arrange for a tour of some of their harmless drug research and development.

Monica also made sure to pay great attention to the tour because her pharmaceutical formula would be produced here. If there were any problems with the production, it would directly affect their brand.

“Mr. Jones.” Wendy had been following Finn.

At that moment, Monica and the person in charge of the other company were walking and talking in front while the others walked behind. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Finn nodded in response.

“Is your chairman pregnant?” Wendy started gossiping because it was really boring.

Every time she had to accompany her boss to receive guests, other than serving them, she was mostly there just for formalities.

“Yes.”

“The chairman’s husband should be an outstanding man, right?” the other party asked.

Finn unconsciously pursed his lips into a beautiful smile.

“Otherwise, how could he be worthy of such an outstanding woman like the chairman?” Wendy lamented sincerely.

Finn chose to remain silent.

“Your chairman is only 29 years old. She’s young, beautiful, capable, and worth more than 100 billion…” The more Wendy spoke, the more impressed she was.

“Your chairman must have many suitors. The man who has wooed the chairman should be extremely happy.”

“Yes, he’s very happy.” Finn’s smile was very obvious.

After Monica and the other company’s person-in-charge did a tour around the factory, she turned around and saw Finn chatting with the other company’s secretary. They seemed to be chatting happily.

However, when had Finn ever talked to a stranger so naturally? He was even smiling.

“Director Cardellini,” the person in charge called out to her.

Monica came back to her senses.

She smiled and covered up her absent-mindedness. “It’s more modern than I thought. I was quite worried about your company’s production, but now it seems that I was worried for nothing.”

“I’m honored that you’re satisfied, Director Cardellini.” The other party said politely, “We’ve been walking for more than an hour, do you want to take a break? Let’s go to the company’s pantry to have some snacks and get some rest. After all, you’re pregnant, and your health is more important.”

“Thank you.” Monica did not refuse his suggestion either.

With that, the group walked out of the factory and went to the company’s executive pantry, where the staff brought them drinks and afternoon tea.

Then, they continued to talk as they ate the snacks. On an occasion like that, as secretaries, Finn and Wendy could only stand at the side and wait.

“From this angle, your chairman looks very beautiful,” Wendy muttered to Finn again..
