Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Dad, that is only for welfare companies. To put it bluntly, it’s for public welfare. There are rules and regulations within Swanhaven Bank. Ordinary companies…”

“I know. That’s why I just told you to do me a favor. That’s so I don’t have to waste time.”

Eden Swan pursed his lips.

Alexander Lawrence’s rebuttal meant that he won’t take no for an answer.

“Or is Fourth Master Swan still the one calling the shots at Swanhaven Bank? Should I go look for him instead?” Alexander saw that Eden didn’t agree so he said that deliberately.

“That’s not it. My fourth uncle has already handed over all aspects of the management of Swanhaven Bank to me. He basically doesn’t oversee the management anymore.”

“Of course, that would be best if you could make the decision.” Alexander appeared to be a little intimidating. “I need the funds urgently as I have to sign the final contract with MUK in the next two days. Within two days, I hope you can approve and transfer the funds to us.”

Eden gritted his teeth.

He was holding it in as he could neither agree nor disagree. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I know of your capability, so I’ll leave this matter to you.” Alexander stood up and patted Eden, appearing sincere and earnest.

Eden braced himself. “I’ll do my best.”

Alexander nodded slightly. “It’s getting late. You guys should head back early. Everyone has work tomorrow.”

“Alright.”

Alexander left after saying that.

Eden suppressed his anger.

He turned to look at Joshua Lawrence.

Joshua’s eyes flickered.

However, as he was threatened by Jeanne Lawrence, he did not dare to leak any information. He quickly found an excuse and left too.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was leisurely sipping tea in the tea room with a calm appearance.

She said casually, “The thought never occurred to you that the extra 200 million yuan would be on you?”

“It was your idea, wasn’t it?” Eden was certain it was her doing.

Jeanne glanced at Eden. “If I say it was Joshua’s idea, would you die of anger?”

“Jeanne Lawrence!” Eden was furious.

Jeanne stood up from the tea chair and stretched herself. She yawned and said, “Eldest Young Master Swan, I’ve said before that evil doing brings about karma! How does it feel to shoot yourself in the foot? I imagine it must not be pleasant.”

“Don’t you get cocky in front of me.”

“It’s getting late. I’ll head back to my room to rest now. I won’t disturb the two of you any longer.” Jeanne ignored them and left.

Eden gritted his teeth and suppressed his anger.

He had been tricked by Jeanne!

He hadn’t even thought that Jeanne would stage such a powerful counterattack that he was caught off guard.

It was a heavy blow without any warning.

“Eden, what did Jeanne do…”

“Shut up!” Eden was in a rage. The moment Jasmine spoke, he was furious.

Jasmine felt aggrieved and her eyes turned red. She looked pitiful.

In the past, Eden would coax her whenever she cried.

Now, Eden looked at her as she cried. He became even more impatient. Eden said, “What else can you do besides cry?”

Jasmine looked at him with wide eyes.

“You can’t help me at all. You’re only a burden to me! You allowed your family to put this on me. How useless!” Eden said fiercely, and he ignored her and strode away.

Jasmine looked at Eden in disbelief.

She had never been scolded like this by Eden.

He had always said that she was gentle, considerate, and a hundred times better than Jeanne Lawrence.

Now, he suddenly said that she was useless?!

‘No.’

It wasn’t Eden’s fault. It was Jeanne.

She was the one who had schemed against Eden. It was that b”tch who had hurt their relationship.

Jeanne Lawrence must experience a horrible death!

…

Jeanne returned to her room and the light was on.

As George had to go to school, he had developed the habit of sleeping and waking up early. Around nine in the evening, George had already fallen asleep on the bed.

Sometimes, Jeanne felt really grateful to God for giving her such a son that made her heart warm.

She tried not to make any noise as she took a shower in the bathroom.

After washing up, she picked up her phone and casually glanced at it. She saw countless missed calls from “Monica Cardellini” on the screen.

Jeanne pursed her lips. She wrapped herself in a towel and went straight to the balcony and dialed.

“Hey Monica.”

“Jeanne, I’m going crazy!” Monica Cardellini broke down.

Jeanne heaved a sigh of relief.

Seeing that Monica had called her so many times, Jeanne was worried that something had happened to her. Now that she’s heard Monica’s agitated voice, she concluded that it was nothing serious.
