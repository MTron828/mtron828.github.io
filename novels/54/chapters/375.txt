Chapter 376: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

At that point, the people behind her quickly rushed after her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth as she turned around and pointed her pistol at the people approaching her.

Before she could fire, the four people after her fell to the ground.

Jeanne’s heart was beating very fast. Not only was it from her running for her life but also because of her fear of death.

She turned her head and looked at Nox.

If Nox had not discovered the pattern of her escape route, she would have been dead by now.

She panted heavily, gasping for air.

Nox went over to help Jeanne up. “Are you alright?”

Jeanne nodded. “Have you found Edward yet?”

“No.” Nox’s expression darkened slightly.

Jeanne looked at Nox.

“Let’s continue to look.” Nox made a prompt decision to continue with the search.

......

With that, Jeanne followed Nox, and the group of them quickly shuttled through the forest.

It was already 9 a.m.

Where did Edward go that night?

..

On the noisy street of South Hampton City, a car was deformed from the impact.

At that moment, there was no one in the car, but there were a lot of blood stains and traces of blood everywhere. From the look of the situation, the people in the car, or at least the people in the passenger seat, should not be alive.

The police were on duty, and they had been checking the situation at the scene.

The preliminary verdict was that it was an intentional car accident with a possibility of murder, so a serious case was established.

In a dilapidated warehouse in South Hampton City, blood stained the ground.

The two people lying on the ground had already passed out.

If they were not sure those two were still breathing, it would look like they were just two corpses.

At nightfall, a basin of cold water poured over them, and both of them opened their eyes.

Monica felt pain all over her body. It was so painful that her body felt numb.

She looked around and saw the unfamiliar place. ‘Where is this?’ she thought.

Why was she here?

Was she not... dead? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She was still alive?

She remembered that she and Finn were being chased.

Many cars around were trying to kill them. In the end, Finn was caught off guard, and she could only watch as a car sped toward her.

However, at that moment, someone suddenly hugged her tightly before she lost consciousness, and her vision went dark.

She thought she was dead, but in fact, she was alive?

In that case…

A pang of terror washed over her.

“Finn!” Monica blurted out in a loud voice.

She clearly remembered it was Finn who hugged her tightly in his arms and that he was protecting her.

At that moment, Finn was also awake.

He could not feel pain, so he did not know how serious his injury was. All he knew was that he had used up all his strength and that his world was spinning.

He had probably lost too much blood and had low blood pressure.

His eyes moved a little as he looked at Monica in front of him, watching her panic as she looked for him.

There was a distance of a few meters between them.

Monica looked left and right before she finally saw him.

She then crawled toward him from the ground, probably because she did not have any strength left in her body.

At least she could still crawl.

That proved that her body was not in a serious condition.

Monica’s eyes were red as she looked at the frighteningly pale Finn in front of her. “Finn, are you okay? Are you okay?!”

“I’m fine.”

“How are you fine? You’re covered in blood,” Monica said nervously.

The moment she said that, her tears started falling.

“I...” Finn wanted to say something else.

However, a loud voice suddenly came from inside the warehouse. “Are you still going to put on a show of sad love tragedy at a time like that?”

The sudden sound made both of them turn their heads at the same time.

Finn’s eyes narrowed. He was sure he did not know the man in front of them, who had a full beard and looked extremely strong.

“Who are you?” Finn asked him coldly.

“Who am I?” The man laughed coldly and terrifyingly. “It doesn’t matter who I am. What matters is that you have offended someone you can’t afford to offend!”

“What do you want?” Finn cut straight to the point.

He knew he would not be able to get anything out of the man anyway.

Although he could not figure out the purpose of those people kidnapping them, those people must not want to kill them.

If they wanted to kill him and Monica, they would have done so long ago instead of keeping them here.

“I don’t know what they want either.” The man squatted down in front of them. “But let me wake you up first. It seems like you’re both awake now.”
