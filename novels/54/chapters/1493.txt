Chapter 1494: Edward and Candice Clarify Their Relationship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice remained silent for a long time because of what Chloe said.

She had always thought that she and Edward could have no feelings for each other. It was very clear that they were together because of a political marriage, so they just had to treat each other with respect and accompany each other peacefully for the rest of their lives.

That was all she asked for, but was she asking too much of that marriage?

“Sis, I really didn’t want to tell you, but I can’t stand seeing you so stubborn. I’m afraid you’ll get hurt in the end.” Chloe calmed herself down a little and started to make herself seem like a good person again.

Chloe actually did not want to tell Candice so soon. She wanted to say it when Edward was around, so she could cause a conflict between them and then take advantage of the situation.

She admitted she was a little impulsive now, but she also felt that she had to say it. After all, it was too difficult for her to get close to Edward.

She had never seen a man ignore her to this extent. In the past, she could easily make any man who liked Candice like her. Only Edward, whom she wanted the most, could not be hers. Since she could not get him, she had to create opportunities for herself to get him.

Now, she had figured it out. Although she could not seduce Edward, she could create a conflict between Edward and Candice.

Once they had a conflict, it was very likely that they would get a divorce. Once they got a divorce, she would have a chance. After all, the reason why Edward and Candice were together was because of her family background. Without Candice, she could replace her.

As intended, it was a well-played game.

“How did you know?” Candice asked her.

Just a second ago, she looked as if her world was crumbling down. However, at that moment, she looked as calm as water, like nothing had happened.

Chloe was certain that Candice was putting up an act. That woman had indeed changed too much after being in a coma. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She said, “I couldn’t sleep this morning and woke up a little early, so I walked around Bamboo Garden and accidentally saw Teddy making breakfast in the kitchen in the back garden. I wanted to greet him, but I saw him put some white powder in your breakfast. I instinctively thought it was a little strange, so I didn’t disturb him. It wasn’t until Teddy left that I quietly walked in and picked up the torn wrapping paper. I then went back to the room to put it together and saw the words ‘Emergency Contraception Pill’ written on it.”

Candice still did not seem to believe it, or rather than saying she did not believe it, she just wanted to confirm it because she did not want to wrongly accuse anyone.

“Do you still have the wrapping paper?”

“Yes.”

“Show it to me.”

“Alright,” Chloe quickly said.

The two of them went upstairs one after the other and entered Chloe’s room. Chloe took the wrapping paper out of the drawer and started to put it together again.

Candice, however, immediately began to piece it together at a shockingly fast speed, which surprised Chloe. It took her at least two hours to piece it together, but Candice only took 20 minutes at most.

Did that woman not only have a higher EQbut also a higher IQ?

Candice quietly pieced the wrapping paper together. Then, she saw a string of words on the packaging paper.

Chloe looked at Candice’s silence and deliberately fanned the flames. “Sis, whv

do you think Edward won’t let you get pregnant?”

Candice, too, wanted to ask why. If he did not want to have more kids, he could just tell her directly. There was no need to hide it from her in such a way. As long as there was a reasonable reason, she could accept it.

Fine, a woman might not find it easy to accept. After all, a woman would definitely want a family and children of her own after she got married.

“Sis, I really don’t want to sow discord between you both. I’m just worried that you’ll be fooled by Edward! I see you treating Edward’s two children as your own, but look at how he’s treating you. To stop you from having children, he even gave you birth control pills. Everyone knows that birth control pills have side effects. If you take them for too long of a period, you would become infertile!” Chloe was all riled up.

She was deliberately exaggerating, to incite Candice’s hatred for Edward. She believed that no woman could accept such a thing..
