Chapter 1770: Class Reunion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now, Bella and Nox had woken up before her.

At that moment, Nox raised his head to look at her and said, “It’s eleven o’clock.”

“What?” Shelly was in disbelief.

How was it already eleven? She thought it was only seven.

It had been a long time since she slept so late.

He had completely broken her record.

“You worked hard last night. It’s only right that you get to rest more,” Nox joked.

Shelly’s face turned red.

It was rare to see Shelly blush, and the pink flush on her face was very beautiful.

Nox gulped.

He really wanted to continue on from last night.

His gaze made Shelly feel awkward, and she quickly changed the topic. “Have you had breakfast?”

“I took Bella to the bakery downstairs for some pastries.” “Oh, good.” Shelly nodded. “I’ll make lunch, then.”

“Sure.” Nox nodded. Then, he saw Shelly busy herself in the kitchen.

Shelly was really a very hardworking person.

Originally, the property management provided a cleaning service. However, every time she came, Shelly had already cleaned the house. It was as if she did not know what to do, if not some housework.

“Daddy,” Bella suddenly called out to him in a small, childish voice.

“What’s wrong?” Nox lowered his voice.

Bella continued, “Mommy said you hurt her before, and she won’t forgive you. Daddy, can you explain yourself to Mommy?! I don’t want to leave you.”

Nox smiled helplessly.

How could he explain what had happened in the past?

There was no explanation, only his viciousness.

He would never be able to erase it in this lifetime.

“Daddy.” Not getting an answer, Bella was rather angry.

She looked fierce.

“In the future, if Daddy and Mommy leave, and you miss Daddy, call. Daddy will come to see you. “Nox changed the topic.

“Must we separate?” Bella asked pitifully. “I’m sorry, Bella.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Boo-hoo…” Bella’s eyes were red again.

Nox quickly comforted her. “Daddy hasn’t separated from Bella yet, has he? Bella, be strong. Don’t cry, okay?”

“Right.” Bella nodded. “But Daddy must fight for Mommy’s forgiveness too.”

“Alright.”

The two chatted for a while longer, with Shelly watching their interaction from afar.

Suddenly, she felt like she was home.

Nox made her feel the warmth of a father.

She looked back and decided not to let her imagination run wild.

At 5:20 pm, Shelly received a call from Sarah, who asked her to hurry downstairs.

Fortunately, Shelly had a good sense of time and was not used to being late, so she had prepared early.

When she left the house, she gave Nox instructions before leaving worriedly. At the neighborhood entrance, Shelly had already spotted a flashy red sports Shelly opened the car door and sat down.

Sarah looked at Shelly and could not help but complain, “Don’t you put on makeup? It’s only right for you to dress up in class reunions. Otherwise, you’ll be outshone by those minxes in minutes.”

Shelly said indifferently, “I don’t want to compete with them anyway.”

“It’s true, though. Ever since you were disfigured in a car accident and had plastic surgery, you’ve become really beautiful. It makes me want to go under the knife.” Sarah looked envious.

Shelly smiled helplessly.

If they could avoid it, how many people would be willing to do so? Most people did not mean it.

Soon, the car arrived at its destination.

They were early. Therefore, there were only a few people when they walked into the private room. The few seemed to have a good relationship with Sarah and quickly took the initiative to chat.

From her memories, Sarah did not seem to have so many friends.

However, Sarah was very easy to get along with and soon laughed with them.

“Oh, is this Shelly?” A girl seemed to have noticed Shelly’s presence.

Shelly was still a little embarrassed. “That’s right, Reyna.”

“Wow… You’ve become so gorgeous. Gosh, women really do change as they grow older. The more they grow up, the prettier they become. Though, why didn’t I back then? I’m still the same as I was when I was studying!”

“Of course, there are changes. After all, four years have passed, and you’re still the same. It proves that you’re not aging. Isn’t that great?” Sarah quickly changed the topic to protect Shelly.

She was afraid Reyna would ask Shelly too many personal questions, and she had promised Shelly she would not embarrass her.

“When you say it like that, I feel comforted.” Reyna McAvoy laughed.

The few of them also laughed.

Ex-students came in one after another.

They would first greet Sarah. Then, they would notice Shelly and get excited.

Shelly was lost as she could not integrate. So, she stood beside Sarah and quietly played with her phone.

As Shelly did not use her phone much, she did not know how to play games, nor did she like to watch videos. She only watched the news occasionally, and it did not take much time.

“Ding, ding, ding.” The most active person in the class walked into the private room mysteriously and said to everyone, “Guess who’s here?”

“Who is it? Don’t keep me in suspense,” A girl said, displeased. “Is he handsome?”

“Handsome or not depends on the person. I’m just an emotionless messenger.” The next second, a familiar figure walked in.

Shelly, also attracted by the lively student in the class, looked at the door curiously.

Just as she wondered if the teacher had arrived, she was caught off guard by the sight of Benjamin.

Had it really been a year?

Time had flown by!
