Chapter 1701: It Turns Out That Shelly Really Doesn’t Like Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly knew that Mrs. Winter was angry and that Mrs. Winter thought she did not appreciate others’ good intentions. In everyone’s eyes, she was eager to get close to Nox because she would be able to live comfortably for the rest of her life.

She used to think that marrying Nox, becoming the young mistress of the Winters, and having a huge fortune was her biggest goal in life. However, after going through so much, she did not care about such a life at all. She would rather take Bella with her and live their little lives.

She was just too disappointed in Nox. She even felt that she would never, in her life, change her opinion of him.

“Just think about it!” Mrs. Winter left after saying that.

Shelly stared at Mrs. Winter’s back and did not say anything in the end.

When Nox saw his mother walking out of the door angrily, he quickly went forward to stop her. “Mom, why are you leaving?”

“Because I don’t want to stay here anymore.”

“What’s wrong? Did you and Shelly argue with each other?”

“We didn’t, but my feelings were hurt.” Mrs. Winter did not want to hide it. “I don’t know what I did wrong by getting you and Shelly to get married and have children. Why did she have to reject me? Didn’t Shelly always want to marry you? Now that she can marry you, she’s trying to take advantage of us-”

“Mom!” Nox interrupted his mother as he could not stand her criticizing Shelly.

“Are you really trying to go against me?” Mrs. Winter was furious. “You never used to want to listen to anything nice I said about Shelly, but now that I’m criticizing her, you can’t stand it? Are you trying to piss me off?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Don’t worry about us. Just go.” Nox also urged her to leave.

Mrs. Winter was really disappointed in her son. “I’d like to see what you do about this!”

She waved her hand and left. After seeing his mother leave angrily, Nox quickly closed the door and ran to Shelly.

Looking at her calm face, he said, “You don’t have to take what my mother said to heart.”

“Alright,” Shelly replied indifferently as she was concentrating on what she was doing.

“If you want to get married at 25 or 26, I can wait. I’m not in a hurry anyway.”

“Okay.”

“Um, are you angry?” Nox could not help but ask.

“No.” Shelly looked up at Nox. “Are you afraid of making your mother angry?”

“It’s okay. She’ll be fine in a while. Besides, getting married and having children is between the two of us. It has nothing to do with her. Don’t think too much about it.” Nox comforted her.

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

“Do you want me to help you with anything?” Nox asked.

He was trying to please Shelly.

“There’s no need. We can eat soon. Just carry Bella to the dining table and wait for me ”

“Alright.” Nox quickly went to the living room and carried Bella to the dining table.

Bella had become very dependent on Nox. Sometimes, she would even act like a spoilt child and sit in Nox’s arms to get him to feed her. However, Shelly would tell Bella off for doing that every time because Nox would not be able to eat properly.

“Bella, return to your seat,” Shelly said sternly as she served breakfast.

Upon hearing that, Bella unhappily left Nox’s embrace and sat on her chair. Then, Shelly served Bella her breakfast before placing her and Nox’s breakfast on the dining table.

It was very quiet at the dining table. Sometimes, Bella would speak to either Shelly or Nox, and some other times, Nox would be talking to Shelly. However, never once did Shelly start a conversation with Nox.

As Nox ate his breakfast, he could feel Shelly’s coldness toward him. She looked very obedient, but in fact, she was not friendly to him at all.

He looked up at Shelly and watched as she lowered her head and ate her breakfast seriously, pretending not to see him staring at her. Unless he called her, she would pretend that she did not see it.

“Shelly.” In the end, Nox called out to her.

Shelly looked up and asked, “Does it taste bad?”

“Do you like me?” Nox suddenly asked.

Shelly was stunned for a second as she did not expect Nox to ask that question. The two of them had been living together for a month, but Nox had never asked about that. It was as if he did not care whether she liked him or not.

Shelly’s eyes flickered.. Then, she lowered her head to eat her breakfast again and said, “Why are you asking this all of a sudden?”
