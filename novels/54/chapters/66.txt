Chapter 67: Embarrass Alexander and Jenifer

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne looked at the pile of clothes in her room and felt like breaking down.

‘Isn’t Fourth Master Swan very busy?

‘Isn’t he very mysterious?

‘Didn’t they say that he’s cold and abstinent, and that strangers aren’t allowed to get close to him?!

‘They’re f*cking lies!

‘Fourth Master Swan is a lunatic!’

Jeanne took a deep breath to calm herself down.

After all, it was not a bad thing for someone to give her clothes. She did not need to... panic.

Just as she was adjusting her emotions, there was a knock on the door.

Jeanne frowned.

It was early in the morning. Could she take a break?

The servant at the door said, “Eldest Young Lady, Old Master wants you to go to his room.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed, and the corner of her mouth curled into a cold smile.

She said, “Help me tidy up the clothes in my room.”

The servant was a little unwilling.

Moreover, she heard that the eldest young lady was going to be kicked out again.

Since Jeanne was going to get out of this house, why did she still have to help her tidy up her room?!

Jeanne ignored the servant’s thoughts and walked straight to Jonathan’s room.

The door opened.

Just as she had expected, Alexander, Jenifer, and Joshua were all in Jonathan’s study.

Everyone watched as she walked in calmly and smiled. “Grandpa, you called for me.”

Jonathan glanced at Jeanne and said bluntly, “You are a sensible person. We don’t need to beat around the bush.”

“Please speak, Grandpa.” Jeanne did not change her expression.

“What’s the relationship between West and you?”

“Would you believe me if I said it?” Jeanne chuckled.

“Tell me!” Jonathan said coldly.

Jeanne replied, “A normal relationship. Two years ago, I applied for a job at MUK. Due to George’s superb mastery of software since young, he helped me develop very quickly in MUK and rose all the way to the position of marketing director. West appreciated me quite a bit. Seeing that I was alone overseas and had no one to rely on, he accepted me as his goddaughter.”

“That’s all?” Jonathan was extremely serious.

“That’s all.” Jeanne was certain.

“Do you think we’ll believe it?!” Alexander suddenly interrupted. “How can a person like you without a diploma or a degree apply for a position at MUK? You became MUK’s marketing director? Don’t you even know how to lie?!” Alexander was sarcastic.

“Since you’ve decided, then it’s useless for me to say anything more.” Jeanne was very calm.

She had calmly accepted her biological father’s belittlement of her.

“Don’t act like I’ve wronged you. Facts speak louder than words.” Alexander was certain.

“So, how do you plan to deal with me?”

“The reason I let you come back this time was to let you marry Thedus Locke. I hope you can behave yourself and learn to be grateful. Now that the marriage with the Lockes is gone, you’re still acting on your own. You even did some shady things that hurt the Lawrences’s reputation. While the situation hasn’t reached the worst stage yet, take your son, George, and leave the Lawrences!”

“You want to kick me out again, right?” Jeanne’s eyes turned cold.

“It’s not that I’m cruel; it’s that you did something immoral and insulted the Lawrences’s reputation.”

Jeanne looked at Alexander.

Jenifer said on purpose at this moment as if she was speaking with sincerity, “It’s not that it’s not good for Jeannie to find her own love. If it was an ordinary boy, it wouldn’t be a big deal even if his conditions are slightly worse. However, West is not only old, but he also has a family. His child is almost the same age as Jeannie... If this were to spread out, I don’t know how ugly things would be. Actually, we’re doing this for Jeannie’s good. Harken is a place with many people. If she leaves earlier, she won’t have to suffer verbal violence.”

It was meant for Jonathan to hear.

Jonathan was the head of the family. Everything required his permission.

Nevertheless, at this moment, Jonathan did not say a word.

Jenifer said again, “Jasmine also called me last night. He said that the Swans still have some opinions about Jeannie. If anything happens to Jeannie, it’ll implicate Eden. Although Eden and Jeanne are no longer related, it’ll still affect the Swans. If this continues, it’ll also affect Jasmine’s marriage.”

Jonathan glanced at Jenifer and turned to Jeanne. “What do you say?”

Jeanne said coldly, “Do I still have the right to choose? Back then, when I was chased away by you, it was only a matter of one flight ticket. Now, it’s only going to be two tickets.”

Jonathan frowned.

“Well...” Jeanne turned to Alexander, “Dad, you don’t need to make so many excuses if you want me to leave. Just say it, and I’ll turn around and leave. Why do you have to say that I’m immoral? If you want to say that I’m immoral, I guess it runs in the family!”

“Jeanne, what do you mean!” Alexander was furious.

“Isn’t the meaning obvious?” Jeanne mocked coldly, “When Little Mom seduced you, my mom was pregnant. Why did n’t you think it was immoral?!”

Alexander was exposed, and he was furious! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Also, Little Mom, how could you say those words so righteously?! When you seduced my dad, did he not have a family?! When Jasmine seduced Eden, did Eden not have a girlfriend?!” Jeanne laughed as she spoke as she really thought it was funny. “Now, what right do you have to act like great people and educate me?!”

At this moment, Jenifer’s face was also red from Jeanne’s words.

All these years, she had been playing the role of the Lawrences’ madam and had always been respected by people. No one had ever mentioned anything about her past!

Now that Jeanne had suddenly said it so bluntly, she was embarrassed.

After Jeanne finished, she did not care about anyone’s emotions. She smiled and said, “Dad, Little Mom, people aren’t stupid. The reason others didn’t mention your past is that they didn’t want to embarrass you. It doesn’t mean that they didn’t exist! Let me give you a piece of advice. One should know shame.”

“Jeanne!” Alexander was furious. At that moment, he was flushed red from Jeanne’s words.

Jeanne was fearless. She appeared extremely calm. “I’ll buy the plane tickets myself. I won’t waste the Lawrences’ money.”

After saying that, she turned around and was about to leave.

“Jeanne!” Jonathan suddenly called out to her.

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled up.

She turned around and asked, “Is there anything else, Grandpa?”

“Did I ask you to leave?” Jonathan said coldly.

Jeanne raised her eyebrow slightly.

Alexander, Jenifer, and Joshua were all surprised.

This morning, Alexander went to look for Jonathan to discuss the matter of making Jeanne leave. Jonathan did not refute him, so he thought that he had agreed.

“Dad.” Alexander could not hold it in any longer.

“Let’s not talk about the relationship between Jeanne and West for now. As an elder, once something happens, you want to chase away your daughter?! Alexander, I thought that the matter from seven years ago made you repent!” Jonathan criticized righteously.

Jeanne sneered.

‘So, has Jonathan started playing the emotional card?’

“Dad, I’m doing this from the Lawrences’ standpoint—”

“Don’t talk so righteously. When you were with Jenifer, why didn’t you say that you were doing it from the Lawrences’ standpoint?!” Jonathan retorted.

Alexander’s face turned red.

He was embarrassed.

“That said, Jeanne is at fault too. As a junior, no matter what your elders are like, you can’t be so disrespectful.”

“Grandpa, you’re right.” Jeanne pretended to be obedient.

‘In any case, as a junior, what if she was told off by her elders?!’

Alexander was the old and shameless one.

“There’s no need to say anything else. Jeanne doesn’t have to leave. In fact, I want her to get involved in the Lawrences’ business and take on a part of our responsibility!” Jonathan enunciated each word clearly!
