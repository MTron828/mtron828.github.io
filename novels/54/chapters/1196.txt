1197 The Game Between Edward And Alex

A week later, in Bamboo Garden, Edward’s body had recovered.

In the first two days when he was awake, he could only lie in his room, and even taking a few steps felt exhausted. However, over the last two days, he was glowing.

At that moment, Edward was sitting on the sofa, watching television with Jeanne.

Although George was also sitting on the sofa, he suddenly felt like an orphan.

He had missed his mother a lot when she left him, so he had wanted her to come back to accompany him and his father.

Now, he suddenly felt that ever since his mother came back, not only did he lose his mother, but he also lost his father.

Her father’s attention was all on her mother, and her mother had probably forgotten that other than the child in her stomach, she had an older son.

“George,” Edward suddenly called out to him.

However, George ignored him.

The two of them had been lovey-dovey with each other the entire night and had ignored him, so it was useless to try to please him now.

He acted high and mighty.

“Get a blanket for your mother. She’s asleep.”

Little George was about to explode with anger.

He thought that his father had found his conscience!

Back when his mother was not around, his father was the one who accompanied him. At that time, he even found his father pitiful because his wife did not want him anymore.

Yet now, he suddenly felt that men were all… *ssholes.

He angrily found a blanket on the sofa and handed it to Edward.

Edward took it from George’s hands and gently placed it on Jeanne’s body, not waking her up.

Jeanne seemed to be particularly sleepy lately, and she always fell asleep when she was not expecting to.

She asked Finn, and he said it was normal that pregnant women slept a lot.

“Why aren’t you going back to your room to sleep? Don’t you need to grow?” Edward whispered to George.

“Hmph!” George stormed off in a huff.

When his father wanted him, he would insist on having them. However, when he did not want him, he would kick him out.

In this world, there was no one more detestable than Fourth Master Swan!

After George left, Edward carried Jeanne upstairs carefully and placed her on the big bed.

Jeanne snuggled into his arms and lay in there docilely and peacefully.

He lowered his head and gently planted a kiss on her forehead.

Slowly, he let go of her, removed the blanket on her, and covered her with the blanket.

Then, he turned around and walked out of the room. He closed the door behind him and went downstairs.

Downstairs, a man in a black suit walked in and said respectfully, “Fourth Master, the Old Master is looking for you.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded.

Then, he left Bamboo Garden and went to Universal Garden.

At that moment, Zachary was not in the main hall. Instead, Wade was there, making tea. When he saw Edward, he said, “Edward, you’re here.”

“Where’s my father?”

“He’ll be out in a while.”

“Alright.” Edward was very respectful.

“Take a seat first,” Wade said to him.

With that, Edward sat on the single sofa at the side.

“Have a cup of tea.” Wade passed a cup of tea to Edward.

“Thank you, Uncle Wade.” Edward received it with both hands before taking a sip.

Wade made another cup and placed it on the coffee table next to Zachary’s seat.

Edward looked at Wade’s figure and asked, “Uncle Wade, have you visited Nox?”

“I have.” Wade replied, “He’s recovering quite well.”

“I want to apologize to you for Nox’s injuries.” Edward stood up and planned to kneel on the floor. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, Wade extended his leg and kicked Edward’s knee to stop him.

Edward looked at him.

“Nox was born to protect you, just like how you protected Alex. You don’t have to take it to heart, and you don’t have to apologize.”

“It’s different.” Edward said directly, “I’ve never thought of having Nox sacrifice his life because of me. I only see him as a brother, and since he’s injured because of me, I should apologize to his family. Whether you accept it or not, I’ll apologize to you for getting your grandson injured.”

As he spoke, Edward knelt on the ground.

Somewhat helpless, Wade squatted down and said, “Alright, I accept it. Hurry up and get up.”

Edward stood up from the ground.

“Have a seat. Your father will be angry if he comes and sees you like this,” Wade said worriedly.

The last thing the Old Master wanted to see was Edward being too emotional.

When Edward returned to his seat, Zachary came out of his room.

...

He said, “Now that you’re with Jeanne, I had to get someone to call you over several times to get you here. You even came at this time.”
