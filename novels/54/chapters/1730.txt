Chapter 1731: Twins

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Then, she thought about it carefully and realized that two men she seemed to like — one was Finn and the other was Brandon — were both related to her cousin.

Hence, she braced herself and said, “Yeah, it’s your fault that you have good taste in men but not anything else.”

“What did you say?” Monica was about to get up from the bed.

Frightened, Sarah wanted to hide behind Shelly. However, Brandon hugged Sarah in his arms, giving her a sense of security.

Sarah was flattered. To be honest, she did not think Brandon liked her that much. She always felt that it was because he could not get her cousin, so he had to settle for the next best thing. Yet, at that moment, she found her boyfriend very attractive.

Monica watched the interaction between the two of them and smiled faintly. In fact, she had always thought that she owed Brandon one. Although she did not show it, she was afraid that he would not be able to get over her for a long time. However, now that he was with Sarah, she felt relieved.

When the two babies were brought back into the ward, everyone’s attention instantly shifted to the babies. It made Monica feel that she had fallen out of favor, except for Finn, who was always by her side.

He said, “If you’re tired, you can sleep for a while.”

“I’m not sleepy.”

“Even if you’re not sleepy, you should take a nap. Now that you’re in the recovery phase, you have to recuperate.” Finn’s voice was extremely gentle.

Monica felt that Finn had changed a lot since he became a father.

“I just don’t want to sleep. I feel so excited now that I can go out and run a marathon.”

Finn was helpless against her, so he decided not to force her anymore.

“By the way, Finn, do you think it’s magical?” Monica asked as she looked at the two babies who were surrounded.

“What is?” Finn asked in a low voice.

“That I’ve given birth to two babies — two real babies,” Monica said seriously.

“Are we going to be parents?”

“Yes.” Finn nodded. “And you’ll be great.”

Monica smiled proudly and said, “Finn, I still feel like a child. How can I be a

mother? I’m finding it hard to accept my new identity.”

“There’s no need to accept it.” Finn smiled and planted a kiss on Monica’s forehead. “In my heart, you’ll always be a child. You always have been.”

Monica looked at him with her eyes red. Sometimes, Finn’s sweet nothings would make her nose sting. The two of them had been on and off for so many years, and just when she thought they would never be together again, they got back together. They even had two babies together.

“Finn, I love you,” Monica said affectionately.

She had never been more sure of her love for him. She loved him.

“Me, too.” Finn caressed Monica’s cheek.

He, too, loved her very much.

The ward was filled with happiness, and only when it was late at night did everyone start leaving. At that time, Monica had fallen asleep.

After Finn sent everyone off, he said to Gary and Ruby, “Dad, Mom, you should go back and get some rest. I’ll stay here with Monica.”

“Can you do it alone?”

“The nurse and the nanny are here, so it’s okay.” Finn said, “Come back tomorrow. Dad shouldn’t stay up late.”

Ruby glanced at Gary. Even though the two of them bickered occasionally, it was obvious that they still cared for each other deeply.

She said, “If anything comes up, call me.”

“Don’t worry.”

“Alright.” Ruby nodded. “By the way, are we going back to your place in three days?”

“That’s the plan for now.”

“Are there enough rooms for us?”

“Yes.” Finn quickly said, “I’ve made sure to prepare a room for you both.” “That’s good,” Ruby said. “Thank you for taking care of Monica.” “As I should.” Finn smiled.

Ruby gave a few more reminders before leaving reluctantly with Gary.

After sending them away, Finn returned to the ward. Seeing that Monica was asleep, he turned his head and finally looked at his two babies.

They had been born for so long, and everyone had looked at them and held them, but he only had the time to see his two children now. As he looked at the two cute little fellows, his heart melted..Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
