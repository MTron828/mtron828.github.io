Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Accompanied by a few thunderclaps, it made the night seem a little scary.

There was a traffic light in front of him, and Nox looked out of the car window, at the bean-sized raindrops falling on the street.

Then, his eyes paused when he saw a woman suddenly running to a bus stop. Her entire body was drenched, and she looked miserable.

Considering it was still early, buses were still operating in the city, so Shelly did not want to take a taxi to leave. Although Nox had given her a sum of money and she did not have to be so thrifty, she had not gotten it yet. Who knew if Nox would suddenly go back on his word?

With a man like Nox, she did not dare to have any expectations for him. Otherwise, she was afraid she would be angered to death.

She wrung the water off the clothes on her body. Since it was summer, she did not wear much to begin with, and after changing out of her work clothes, she wore a white dress. It was simple, elegant, and cheap.

At that moment, because of the rain, her clothes were all stuck to her body. They were white and extremely transparent, making her pink bra under her visible.

However, she was not alone at the bus stop. After all, in this world, the poor still made up the majority.

She did not notice that she was being watched by the other two men at the bus stop, who did not expect to enjoy such a view at night. Her clothes were so transparent that they could almost make out the contours of her body.

As the two men stared at her intently, the car that was leaving suddenly made a sharp turn and stopped in front of the bus stop. Rainwater splashed all over the ground.

Shelly frowned, wondering who it was. It was raining so heavily, yet he had to drive so fast before he braked so abruptly. Did he have a death wish?

The moment the back door opened and she saw Nox, she was calm. It was not easy for a person like Nox to survive until now. His family said he was prone to bloodshed, but why was he still alive after so many years?

She Imew that her thoughts were vicious, but she felt inexplicably good about it.

At that moment, she suddenly felt a pain in her arm as Nox dragged her into his car. Nox’s brute force frightened Shelly.

She Imew she could not have any expectations for Nox. It had only been a short while, and he was already going back on his word. Most importantly, she had already resigned.

Whatever. She was planning to resign anyway, so it had nothing to do with Nox.

While she comforted herself, Nox suddenly roared, “Do you think you’re good-looking, Shelly?”

Shelly turned her head to look out of the car window and ignored him.

“Shelly! ”

“No!” Shelly answered, her voice a little loud.

“If you don’t think so, why are you trying to seduce those men? Don’t you have any self-awareness?”

Who did she seduce? Was Nox delusional? Or was he deliberately finding fault with her because he did not want to give her the 50,000 dollars?

“Look at what you’re wearing!” Nox looked at her clothes.

Even in the dark, he could see through what she was wearing.

When they were at the traffic lights, he glanced at Shelly. As the bus stop had lights, he could see at a glance how transparent her clothes were and how the man beside her was staring at her. However, she was completely unaware of it, or… she did it on purpose Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In any case, he was pissed off. How shameless was Shelly? What the hell had she become over the years?

Shelly lowered her head, baffled as to why Nox was scolding her. However, she could not see it because it was dark.

Suddenly, Nox turned on the lights in the car. With the lights switched on, Shelly saw the condition of her clothes and immediately noticed the pink from her undergarments.

At that moment, she was a little embarrassed. She had forgotten that the quality of the clothes she bought was not great. When it was wet, it looked no different from her not wearing any clothes.

Shelly reached out and turned off the lights in the car.

Nox laughed sarcastically. “Why are you still pretending to be innocent?

Weren’t you quite confident when you were standing on the street just now?”

Nox’s words were sometimes unpleasant to the ear, but Shelly endured it. After all, she did not have the courage to get out of Nox’s car and hail a cab herself. Next time, she had to remember to bring an umbrella out with her..
