Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It has nothing to do with you,” Edward answered in a different way.

Therefore, was their relationship affected? Did Candice take the initiative to kiss Edward because of Paige? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Did they wake up so late this morning and was Edward going to work so late because… they had a long argument last night?

She could not helD but admire Edward and Candice. It was obvious that the two of them had a conflict, but they could pretend that nothing had happened. “If anything happens between you and my sister, I’ll really blame myself-”

“Don’t think too much.” Edward interrupted her. She really couldn’t see much emotion on his face.

“I’m leaving.”

As he spoke, he pushed Chloe away and got into the car. Chloe did not dare to say anything about that. Due to her identity, she was still a little wary of Edward.

She hurriedly waved and said, “Take care, Edward.”

The chauffeur respectfully closed the car door for Edward before returning to the car and driving away.

In the car, as Edward took off his suit, he instructed the person on the other end of his phone, “Prepare another suit jacket for me.” “Okay, Leader. May I know when you need it?” “I’ll be in the office in 20 minutes.”

“Yes.” The other party was extremely respectful.

The chauffeur glanced at the Leader who was sitting in the back seat through the rearview mirror. All these years, the Leader had kept an absolute distance from women and would never let any woman touch him. It was as if he was keeping his chastity for someone.

He had been standing beside the Leader just now, staring at him as he got into the car, so he saw that woman touching the Leader’s sleeve. However, the Leader took his suit off just because of that.

Before this, he did not know who the Leader was doing this for, but ever since he met his wife, he had a rough idea of who the woman he was doing it for was.

At night, after Candice coaxed Paige to sleep, she went back to her room to sleep.

Edward would probably return even later tonight. After all, he woke up so late that morning. Therefore, she left a dim light on for him and did not plan to wait for him to fall asleep together.

Yet, when she closed his eyes, she could not seem to fall asleep. It was not that she missed Edward. Instead, she kept thinking about the diary. She just had the urge to open it and see what was written inside.

What exactly was in it that made her think of it so much?

Candice turned over and sat up on the bed, frustrated. She wanted to go downstairs to get a glass of water so that she could get some fresh air and not think too much.

She was walking down the stairs when she suddenly stopped in her tracks. It was because she saw Edward, who had already returned. She watched as he sat at the bar counter in the living room, seemingly drinking alone.

Her heart skipped a beat. That scene should be an unfamiliar scene, but she suddenly found it extremely familiar. It was as if she had seen Edward like that before.

However, they had never interacted with each other before this, and they clearly did not know each other at all. Why did she find that scene so familiar?

Then, her head began to hurt. The more she tried to recall that familiar scene, the more her head felt like it was about to explode. It felt as if the truth was about to break free.

She bit her lip lightly, and just as she was about to go downstairs, she saw a woman walking over from the other side of the hall. The woman was always there, but she had just left for a while and now she was back.

She watched uneasily as Chloe sat opposite Edward, took Edward’s wine bottle, and poured a glass for Edward and another for herself. Chloe was even drinking with him.

Candice watched for a few seconds before she turned around and went back upstairs. She just felt that it would be a little abrupt for her to appear at that time, and she was not that thirsty.

When Edward noticed her departing figure, he picked up the wine glass and downed it.

“Edward, drink less. It’s not good for your body to drink too much,” Chloe quickly called out to him worriedly.

Edward ignored her and took the bottle to pour himself another glass.

“Edward, aren’t you happy? Why are you suddenly drinking so much? If you’re unhappy, tell me. I want to share your burden.” Chloe seemed very considerate..
