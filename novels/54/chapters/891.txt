892 Humiliated At the Wedding, Michael Is Utterly Embarrassed!

Otherwise, no one would work for the Sanders in the future.

Last night, Jeanne had told her a way to deal with Michael.

Jeanne said that as long as she revealed what she had given her to the public today, Michael’s reputation would be ruined. There was no need for the Shen family to spend any more of their resources on Michael, and he would immediately withdraw from power.

Although she did not know what kind of unspeakable secret of Michael’s was hidden in the USB drive, she was convinced by Jeanne.

She put the USB drive in her palm and chatted casually with the other members of the Sanders. She did not show any signs of abnormality.

Jeanne left right after delivering the items as she knew very well that the matter had been settled.

After all, as long as she found someone with more power than Michael at his wedding, his video would be successfully broadcasted.

From the beginning, she had thought of Quinn.

Quinn owed her a favor and could not tolerate her being plotted against and betrayed. Therefore, she would definitely do it.

Jeanne then walked to a corner of the banquet hall.

The person in the uniform was Lucy in disguise, who reminded her, “During the banquet, we have to start collecting each of the guest’s hair. Be careful not to make any mistakes.”

Jeanne nodded.

Before they came, they had already received the list of all the guests and numbered each of them. All the killers of the Hills had memorized it by heart. Everyone had a number, and the hair they received would be marked with the number.

After a short while, a spotlight suddenly lit up at the banquet hall.

The banquet hall was a typical wedding hall, and it was in a huge castle-like building. The middle of the hall was separated by a T-shaped stage, and the hall was filled with fresh bouquets, mainly light blue, looking like a sea of blue flowers. To enhance the light effect, the banquet hall was very dark as only a few lights were on, shrouding the hall with a hazy romance.

Suddenly, a white light shone on the couple at the end of the runway.

The newlyweds walked on the T-shaped stage under the illumination of the lights.

All the guests sitting on both sides of the stage had their attention on the stage.

That was the time for the Hills to act.

All the waiters would begin to serve the dishes during this segment, so many waiters would approach the guests. Coupled with the effect of the dark banquet hall and the attention of the guests, it was the best time to make a move.

The Hills’ assassins mixed among the waiters were all well-trained.

When they bent over to serve the dishes, they held the plate in one hand and used the other hand to cut off a strand of the guest’s hair with a pair of small, undiscoverable scissors.

Everything was going smoothly.

After every assassin got a strand of the guest’s hair, they would put them into their own pockets and leave. As they left, they would pass by another assassin who was responsible for collecting hair and handing the hair over. With such perfect cooperation, no one noticed the secret operation in the hall.

Right now, everyone’s attention was still on the couple walking to the runway.

According to tradition, the newlyweds would give a thank-you speech before the banquet started, and it was the parents who usually gave the speech.

Therefore, Michael and Monica stood at the side. The speaker was Reese, who had been waiting there for a long time.

She was not holding a script and was standing there elegantly.

Her eyes were red as if she was touched by the wedding today.

When she spoke, everyone’s attention was on her.

“Thank you very much for coming to the wedding of my son, Michael, and my daughter-in-law, Monica. Thank you.”

The audience burst into applause.

“Everyone might be wondering why I’m the only one here and not with Michael’s father…” As soon as she said that, she began to choke. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In fact, most people knew that Michael’s father had passed away.

However, it had not been announced to the public.

“Michael’s father passed away three months ago.”

The crowd was in an uproar.

There was a difference between what they expected and hearing it with their own ears.

“The reason why it hasn’t been announced to the world is because of Michael’s father’s last words. He hoped to tell everyone on Michael’s wedding day and let everyone know that his son, Michael, has grown up and become an independent man who can replace him and serve the country.”
