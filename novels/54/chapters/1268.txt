1269 The Birth of Paige

However, she did not expect it to be so difficult.

So was George’s birth the last time.

His was because of breech birth, which meant no matter how hard she pushed, it was impossible for her to deliver naturally.

This time though, Dr. Jones said that the fetus was normal.

Sometimes, she felt that she was too stubborn.

She said, “Let’s have a C-section.”

When Edward was quiet, she spoke weakly.

In fact, she was not selfless.

She thought that when she died, at least her body would be intact and the tear below was only a small cut, yet with a dissection, her belly would be left with a big wound, which should be scary, right?

Despite this, compared with the dignity she left for herself in the end, the baby’s life is more important.

It is more important that the baby is alive.

“Try again, I’ll accompany you,” Edward said suddenly.

He faced her, his voice very soft.

Jeanne looked at him in disbelief.

“I believe our baby will be very brave,” Edward emphasized on each word.

Jeanne clenched her teeth.

She did not know if Edward gave her comfort, or she firmly believed that the baby would work hard with her, so she nodded and began to exert herself.

Following the doctor’s direction, she pushed hard again.

“Ms. Lawrence, yes, that’s it. Don’t be discouraged, don’t open your mouth to scream, hold back, push down hard. Yes!” The doctor who had helped Jeanne deliver was encouraging her.

It was obvious that if Jeanne insisted on a natural birth, it would not be smooth and the fetus would be in danger.

They could not afford such risk.

“Ms. Lawrence, the cervix has dilated to the width of seven fingers!” The doctor was pleasantly surprised.

At the beginning, it dilated to the width of three to four fingers and then remained at that. Now, with Fourth Master in the room, it only took an hour to dilate to the width of seven fingers.

A smooth delivery was finally in sight.

The doctor was very excited.

He kept cheering Jeanne on, “Yes, that’s how strong you are. Just got to grit your teeth and exert all your strength. Don’t be discouraged.”

All the medical staff’s excited voices were exuberant in the waiting room.

Edward was sitting next to Jeanne, watching her quietly as she was giving birth to their baby.

It turned out that delivering a baby was so painful.

Jeanne wondered if it was this painful when she gave birth to George?

Edward’s Adam’s apple could be seen moving up and down.

His eyes were on Jeanne, unmoving not even for a second.

“8 fingers,” the doctor said excitedly.

The current progress is obviously going smoothly.

Jeanne kept exerting force.

Keep trying not to give up.

“Nine fingers!”

Edward looked at Jeanne as she sweated profusely.

Looking at her being in so much pain and difficulty.

He reached out and held her hand.

He could feel her clammy hand and felt her amazing strength.

Is this a mother’s love?

Let yourself explode with unlimited potential.

“I can see the head!” the doctor said excitedly.

Edward swallowed his saliva.

Jeanne again pushed.

“Ah!” She could not help but yell.

Accompanied by the sound of a crying child, it resounded throughout the villa.

Right outside the door, Teddy could not help but say happily, “The baby’s here! The baby’s finally here! Madam has delivered!”

At that moment, Dr. Jones just chose to remain silent.

In the delivery room, the medical team retrieved the baby.

“Fourth Master, it’s a girl.”

He had always known it was a daughter.

When it was really confirmed that it was a girl, he could feel his heart throbbing.

...

He responded, “Okay.”

“Will Fourth Master come and cut the umbilical cord himself?”

“No need,” Edward refused.

All his attention at the moment was on Jeanne.

After she exhausted her last shred of strength, she lay there, as if she suddenly lost any breath...

She just stared at the ceiling in front of her quietly.

All she could hear was the sounds of her daughter crying.

One sound, small and crisp.

“Fourth Master, 8.7 pounds, 51 centimeters. The baby is normal.”

“Fourth Master, do you want to hold the baby?”

Edward turned his eyes.

...

He took a look.

Looking at the little baby who was held in the doctor’s arms, crying with an aggrieved face, and seeing her wrinkled appearance, his heart felt warm.

He said, “Want to see it?”

He was asking Jeanne.

Jeanne’s eyes seemed to flicker.

She shook her head slightly.

No.

She did not want to leave with too many regrets.

“Hold on to the baby first,” Edward ordered.

“Yes.” The doctor said respectfully, and could help but add, “Chief said... at most half an hour.”

“Okay.”

The medical staff and doctor left with the baby in his arms.

In the delivery room, there were only the two of them left.

With the last half hour, the two chose to remain silent.

Utter silence.

Jeanne seemed to feel a tear falling on her cheek.

She pursed her lips lightly and her eyes turned to Edward.

Looking at the tears in his eyes filled right before her eyes.

She did not even have the strength to cry.

She said, so weak that it sounded almost inaudible, “Live well.”

Edward pursed his lips tightly.

Neither did he not nor utter a word.

If anything, he turned pale.

There was a knock on the door.

“Fourth Maste,” said urgingly.

“Fourth Master.” There was no response, and the person outside the door called again.

“Yes,” Edward responded.

The moment of promise.

He stood up from Jeanne’s side and said, “I’m sorry.”

Jeanne shook her head.

It did not matter.

Next life, it was best they just did not meet again.

Next life...

Actually, how would there be a next life?

To die was to die.

She watched Edward turn and leave.

With a heavy back, such a tall body, such a broad back, suddenly there was an illusion that it would fall if touched. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ed,” Jeanne called him suddenly.

She remembered what he said during the wedding night in the bridal room.

“My name is Swan, Edward Swan. You can call me Ed.”

Ed.

Jeannie and Ed.

Edward’s footsteps paused.

His eyes were blurred, and he could not look back at that moment.

At that moment, he dared not turn around.

He could not look at Jeanne’s expression now when she called his name.

Not daring to look at her, Jeanne’s eyes were full of despair at her last moments.

He said, “Goodbye, Jeannie.”

Farewell.
