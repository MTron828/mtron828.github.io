Chapter 1636: Zoe Is Pregnant

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Through the peephole, Shelly saw Zoe standing alone at her door and hesitated for a long time before opening the door.

Zoe had lost her former glory. At that moment, she was bare-faced and dressed casually. She looked haggard. It turned out that, without money, she was no different from an ordinary person.

“Why are you looking for me?” Shelly was on guard.

She had suffered so much malice from the outside world recently that she could not be calm about it.

“Give me back my money.” Zoe was straightforward and did not beat around the bush.

Shelly looked at her.

“Give me back the 200 thousand dollars I gave you back then!” Zoe was even a little agitated.

“Why should I return it to you?”

‘Why? Because this agreement letter says so!” Zoe took it out of her bag. “We agreed that you wouldn’t speak ill of me before Nox. Now that you’ve refuted my accusations against Nox in front of the entire country and caused me to end up in this state, shouldn’t you return the money to me?”

To be honest, Shelly never thought that Zoe would ask her for money. She had not been watching the news recently because of the cyberbullying she had been through, so she did not know what kind of downfall had befallen the Sullivans.

However, looking at Zoe’s current situation, she assumed that the Sullivans should have gone bankrupt. Otherwise, 200 thousand dollars would be nothing to Zoe, and Zoe would not have asked her to return it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It’s gone.” Shelly refused.

It was because the money was indeed gone. If she still had it, she probably would not return it either.

With her current situation, she also needed money. She could not go to work but still had to pay for Bella’s post-treatment fees. She also had to pay for her and Bella’s living expenses. To her, money was the only thing that could keep her alive.

“It’s gone? How could it be gone? Give it back to me!” Zoe instantly flew off the handle.

She probably did not expect that she would be in such a sorry state for a mere 200 thousand dollars one day.

“If it’s gone, it’s gone. Why don’t you go to court and sue me? Let’s see what the court decides.”

“Shelly, you can’t be so shameless! You didn’t live up to your promise. Why don’t you return the money to me? Give it back to me!” Zoe was on the verge of breaking down.

She was so poor that she really needed money now. After all, she did not expect Nox to be so cruel. Not only did he bankrupt their family, but he also made them bear a huge debt, forcing their family of three to move from a luxurious villa to a slum.

In just a week, they were so poor that they could not even fork out a single cent. They also looked for their former business partners, relatives, and friends to ask for help, but they were all cruelly rejected. The reason for the rejection was that they, too, did not want to offend Nox. No one dared to offend Nox.

Zoe’s family was at their wits’ end, and that was when she remembered that she had given Shelly 200 thousand dollars. Now, she wanted to get that 200 thousand dollars back!

“I said it’s gone. I’ve used it up.” Shelly forced herself to calm down in response to Zoe’s agitation.

“What did you use it on? What did you use it on?” Zoe asked her in devastation.

That was the money that would save her life. Without that money, she did not know how her family would survive.

“In short, nothing’s left,” Shelly said coldly.

“Shelly, you bitch!” Zoe was so angry that her body was trembling.

She was really at her wit’s end. Without Shelly’s 200 thousand dollars, she did not know how she could survive.

“Slap!” Zoe raised her hand and suddenly slapped Shelly hard across the face.

For a second, Shelly felt as if her ears had gone deaf, but she did not retaliate. Since she had not fulfilled her promise to Zoe, logically speaking, she should return the 200 thousand dollars. However, because she needed money and was unwilling to sell the house, she went against her conscience and did not relent.

“Shelly, you bitch, you will die a horrible death one day!” Zoe cursed. By then, she had lost it.

On the other hand, Shelly did not refute it. She just looked at Zoe coldly, watching her lose control.

Who would have thought that the once glamorous young miss would end up like that one day?
