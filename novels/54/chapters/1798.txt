Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Then, Nox left his residence. Shelly, however, had no idea that he had transferred the ownership of that property to her, so there was no need for her to move. He was the one who should move out.

Benjamin helped Shelly move everything back to her old home. After that, Shelly was busy cleaning up, and Benjamin cleaned up the house with her as well.

When they were almost done, the doorbell suddenly rang.

Shelly opened the door and was surprised to see a strange man in a suit. “Who are you looking for?”

“Are you Ms. Shelly Carter?”

“I am.”

“Hello, I’m Nox’s private lawyer. My name is Matt Logan. You can call me Mr. Logan.”

“Is there anything you need from me, Mr. Logan?” Shelly’s eyes narrowed.

For a moment, she thought Nox was up to something again! After all, Nox had never been a man of his word. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“If it’s possible, can we talk inside, Ms. Carter? There’s a lot to talk about.”

Shelly nodded. She wanted to see what Nox was up to!

With that, Matt walked into Shelly’s house, and Benjamin accompanied Shelly warily.

Matt took out some documents and placed them in front of Shelly one by one. “These are some documents regarding the transfer of nronerties and assets that Mr. Winter has asked me to get vou to

sign, Ms. Carter. This includes a villa and three high-end apartments under Mr. Winter’s name, two luxury cars, and marketable securities worth hundreds of millions. At the same time, five million in cash will also be transferred to your account within three days. Ms. Carter, please take a look at them.”

Shelly was shocked. She thought that Nox was up to something again, but she never expected him to give her so many things out of the blue.

Benjamin was also surprised, but at the same time, he seemed to have expected it. If Nox could do so much for Shelly, giving her some assets was nothing.

“Can I not want them?” Shelly refused.

She did not want to have anything to do with Nox or accept anything from him.

“According to Mr. Winter, if you don’t want it, he will keep pestering you to accept it. He wants me to remind you that it’s best not to reject it.”

It turned out that he was threatening her. With her teeth gnashed, she got up and left the living room, walking straight to the balcony. She dialed Nox’s number, wanting to him what he meant by that.

Nox was currently on a blind date. The woman sitting opposite him was quiet and gentle, making her a good candidate to be his wife. Seeing the caller ID on his phone, he hung up. However, Shelly refused to give up.

“It’s okay. You can answer the phone,” the other party said considerately. Nox glanced at the woman and said, “Do you mind if I take a picture of you?”

“Of course not, ” the woman said.

As she was very satisfied with Nox, she would not reject his request.

Nox took a photo of the woman with his phone and sent a message to Shelly. “I’m on a blind date. I’ll contact you later.”

When Shelly read Nox’s message, she froze for a few seconds. She stared at the photo of the woman he had sent her and suddenly chuckled. She seemed to be overthinking it. After all, Nox had never lacked women or love.

With that thought in mind, she put down her phone and returned to the living room.

She said, “Mr. Logan, can you leave these documents here first? I’ll contact Nox and get back to you.”

“Sure,” Matt quickly said. “Mr. Winter has signed the documents, so please take a look at the contracts and sign them, Ms. Carter.”

“Okay, thank you.”

“You’re welcome.” Matt was very polite. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave now. This is my business card. Ms. Carter, if you need anything, you can call me.”

“Thank you.”

After sending Matt off, Shelly turned to look at Benjamin.

Benjamin smiled. “This money should be nothing to Nox.”

It was indeed nothing to Nox. However, to ordinary people like them, it was a huge sum of money that they would never be able to earn in their entire lives.

“I don’t think Nox needs to make it up to me with money. I don’t deserve it”

The grudge between her and Nox had long been written off the moment he saved Bella. After that, the occasional unhappiness in their relationship was just a conflict caused by their lack of love for each other. There was no need to make up for them.

“Nox didn’t answer the phone just now, huh?” Benjamin changed the topic.

“He’s on a blind date.” Shelly was very calm.

Benjamin frowned.

“I’m used to it. Nox is such a man. We’ll talk about it after his blind date.”

Shelly did not want to continue on that topic, so Benjamin did not say anything else.

“Thank you for helping me today. I’ll do the rest myself. You can go back first,” Shelly said tactfully.

Benjamin stared intently at Shelly, who felt her scalp go numb from his stare.

“What’s wrong?’

“Can we get back together again?” Benjamin enunciated each word and asked her sincerely.

Shelly’s heart fluttered. Although she had broken up with Nox, she had never thought of getting back together with Benjamin.

‘Your parents won’t agree, and I don’t want to make things difficult for you.” “What if I say my parents have agreed?” Benjamin asked her again.

Shelly could not believe what she just heard.

“Yes, my parents agreed to our relationship,” Benjamin said straightforwardly..
