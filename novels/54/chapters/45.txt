Chapter 46: Tried to Gain an Advantage Only to End up Worse Off

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At night... It was so quiet.

On the huge bed, Monica and Finn looked at each other.

Monica did not have many clothes on her.

Finn was not dressed very thick either.

When the two of them touched each other, it was obvious... that it was even warmer.

Monica looked straight at the man beneath her. He was expressionless.

Was she the only one whose heart was about to explode?!

No.

Her heartbeat was merely the result of her anxiety.

She gritted her teeth and said to Finn, “Finn, look at my body carefully! Men would line up from the east to the west of South Hampton City to sleep with me!”

Finn looked at her and her flushed face.

“So...” Finn’s thin lips moved slightly, and his voice seemed to be a lot more hoarse. “Did you sleep with someone?”

“It’s none of your business!” Monica shouted.

“Did you sleep with Michael?”Finn pressed.

Monica was obviously stunned.

That day at the hospital, they all saw Michael. Nevertheless, after that day, they did not mention that person. At this time, Finn suddenly brought him up.

He suddenly brought Michael up...

Monica pursed her lips.

Finn watched the changes in her expression.

Monica never hid her emotions. What she was feeling was written all over her face.

Sometimes, this kind of person was truly cruel.

Finn pushed Monica away.

Monica screamed and rolled on the bed.

Finn got up from the bed.

“B*stard, what are you doing!” Monica roared at Finn.

“I’m afraid you’ll taint me!” Finn said and left.

The moment he left, the door was slammed shut.

Monica was going to explode!

‘F*cking scum!

‘Who’s f*cking tainting who?!’

Monica was so angry that her eyes turned red. She just felt so wronged that she wanted to die!

…

The next day.

Before the sky turned bright, Jeanne pushed open the door and was about to leave.

Outside the door, on the sofa, a man was sleeping. When he heard the sound, he opened his eyes and sat up.

“I’m sorry to have woken you up.” Jeanne was apologetic.

Finn ruffled his hair. “It’s okay. I don’t sleep much.”

Besides, he could not sleep well as he was curled up on the sofa. He had not slept for almost the whole night.

“I’ll go back first.”

“Do you need me to send you back?”

“No.” Jeanne declined politely. “I still need to thank you for last night.”

“It was nothing.”

“When Monica wakes up, help me tell her that I’ll see her at Eden and Jasmine’s wedding.”

“Do they still have a wedding?” Finn asked.

Jeanne was stunned for a moment, then she said, “Do you think I did all this last night to stop Eden and Jasmine from getting married?”

“I heard from Monica that you and Eden used to be very in love.” Furthermore, it was strange that Jeanne never found another man after that.

Jeanne said, “That was in the past. The wedding will go on. After all, it’s rare to find such a compatible cheating couple in this world. It’d be a pity to separate them.”

“...” Finn was lost for words at that moment.

“I’m leaving.”

Jeanne waved her hand and left the luxurious apartment.

She used her phone to call for an Uber and quickly returned to the Lawrence family’s manor.

The servants in the villa woke up early and were working. When they saw Jeanne return early in the morning, they were shocked.

Jeanne ignored the servants’ gazes and went upstairs calmly. Since it was Jasmine’s wedding today, everyone else also woke up early.

At this moment, many people were gathered at the door of Jeanne’s room.

To be honest, Jenifer’s intentions were too strong.

Jeanne was curious about how her mother was defeated by this woman back then. Did her mom underestimate her enemy or... trust her dad too much?!

She sneered.

Jeanne walked over slowly.

She walked past the crowd and looked coldly at the panicking man and woman in the room.

Sam and Jasmine were on the same bed, both hugging the blanket to cover their bodies.

The two of them seemed to have just realized who the other person was. The room was filled with screams.

When Jenifer saw the two of them clearly, she was shocked as well.

She had called many of her relatives in the house to wake Jeanne up on purpose. She did not even ask for permission to open the door. Who knew, she saw such a scene that made her break down.

‘How could it be Jasmine and Sam on the same bed? It should’ve been Jeanne.

‘How could it be?! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

‘Something must’ve gone wrong. Now that such a huge mistake has been made, how are we going to make up for it?!’

Thinking that today was Jasmine’s wedding, if the wedding was ruined…

Jenifer did not dare to imagine the consequences.

Her expression changed abruptly, and she said to all her relatives around her, “All of you, disperse immediately! If anyone dares to say a word, the Lawrences teach him a lesson!”

There was a sudden burst of her aura.

Everyone around Jenifer quickly withdrew their gazes and left in an instant.

Once everyone left, only Jeanne was left.

Only Jeanne was left. She appeared very suddenly.

Jenifer saw her at a glance. At that moment, she almost wanted to strangle Jeanne to death. “Jeanne, what did you do!”

“Aren’t we clear who’s the one who did something?” Jeanne mocked.

“Are you trying to ruin Jasmine’s wedding and marry Eden yourself?!” Jenifer’s tone was firm and filled with anger. “In your dreams!”

Jeanne sneered.

A man like Eden was too dirty for her.

She walked to Jenifer and said, “Why aren’t you taking Jasmine away? Are you planning to alarm my father or grandfather?”

Jenifer looked at her fiercely.

Jeanne did not want to be outdone.

Jenifer gritted her teeth. She knew this was not the time to waste time with Jeanne. She quickly walked into the room, picked up Jasmine’s clothes on the floor, and quickly put them on her. Then, she yelled at Sam, who was also shocked, “Put on your clothes and get lost. Don’t let me see you again!”

“Auntie...”

“Get lost!” Jenifer was hysterical.

Sam did not dare to speak. He quickly picked up the clothes on the floor and put them on.

Jenifer took Jasmine and left first. Sam was also very fast.

The moment he left, he glanced at Jeanne.

Until now, he still did not seem to understand how the person on the bed became Jasmine.

“Why aren’t you leaving? Are you planning to be beaten to death by my dad?” Jeanne asked.

Sam also knew that the Lawrences were a noble family in South Hampton City. He could not afford to offend them, so he could only leave dejectedly.

Everyone left.

Jeanne walked into her room and took down the mini camera.

She slowly walked out of the room and said to the servants downstairs, “Help me change my bedsheets. They’re dirty.”

Then, she went into Phoebe’s room.

Phoebe had naturally seen the scene in the room just now. At this moment, she was also a little embarrassed when she saw Jeanne.

Jeanne said indifferently, “I’ll bring George back to his room.”

Phoebe did not say anything and hurriedly let Jeanne carry George away.

George opened his eyes in a daze. “Mom.”

“Go to sleep. It’s still early.”

“Have you achieved your goal?” George muttered.

“Of course,” Jeanne said.

“That’s good.” George leaned on Jeanne’s shoulder. “Otherwise, my sacrifice last night would’ve been in vain.”

Jeanne wondered, ‘Did I make you sell your body or kidney?!’
