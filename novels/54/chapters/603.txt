“That old fox!” Reese cursed.

“As they say, being with a ruler is like living with a tiger. If we want to develop under the Sanders’ regime, we have to follow what they say.”

“I’m just a woman, and I don’t know that much. Anyway, I’ll listen to you.”

“Don’t worry. The Rosses will regain our glorious days.”

“Okay.”

Michael and his mother chatted for a while before hanging up. After that, Michael was no longer in the mood to get back to work.

He had seen the news late last night and this morning about Jonathan’s sudden death. However, he did not think that it was a coincidence.

After some thought, he called Monica.

Monica limped as she struggled to change her clothes and was about to head out when she saw Michael’s call. She picked it up. “Michael.”

“Are you at home?”

“I’m going out now.”

“Where are you going?”

“I’m going to the Lawrences with Jeanne. The Lawrences are despicable, and I’m afraid Jeanne will be bullied. I have to go and protect her!” Monica was filled with righteous indignation.

Michael could not help but laugh.

Monica frowned. “Why are you laughing? My best friend has been bullied, and you’re laughing!”

“No, I’m just curious. Where did you get the courage to think you can protect Jeanne?”

“Are you laughing at me?”

“No,” Michael said gently. “I just think you’re cute.”

“Hmph.”

“How about this? I’ll go with you.”

“There’s no need. I’ll hold you back from your work.”

“Logically speaking, since Old Master Lawrence has passed away, I should go and pay my respects. Since you’re going, I’ll go with you. Besides, no matter what, Jeanne’s father will be a little wary of me. If I go, at least they won’t bully you and Jeanne in public.”

Monica was a little hesitant, but she found what Michael said made sense.

After all, Michael was in politics, and businessmen were most afraid of provoking politicians.

“There’s no need to overthink. I’ll come and pick you up right away.”

Monica had yet to refuse, but Michael had already hung up the phone.

She was going instinctively this time to challenge the Lawrences for Jeanne anyway, so the more, the merrier.

She waited at home for a while before Michael came to pick her up.

Monica told him every time that he could give her a call when he arrived and that she would then go downstairs. However, he would always come up without telling her to support her and bring her to the car for fear she would fall.

In the car, Monica was complaining about the cold-bloodedness and ruthlessness of the Lawrences, and Michael would occasionally agree.

The car soon arrived at its destination.

Monica gave Jeanne a call and waited in the car for a while until she saw Jeanne’s car drive into the Lawrence family’s manor.

Then, the two of them got out of the car together.

The moment Jeanne saw Michael, she was stunned for a second.

Michael, on the other hand, was very calm. He went up to greet her, appearing very friendly. “Jeannie.”

He called her the same as how Monica called her, and Monica did not think there was anything wrong with it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It was not appropriate for Jeanne to refute Michael, but she purposely made herself seem a little distant. “I didn’t expect Director Ross to send Monica over.”

“Your grandfather passed away, so I should also come and pay my respects.” Michael appeared very composed.

Every word and action was too proper, so much that no one could find any flaws in them.

That man was either considerate or too good at pretending. Otherwise, Monica would not have trusted him so much.

While Jeanne was panicking for a second, Michael said promptly, “Oh, right. Call me Michael. Between friends, calling me the director is too formal.”

Jeanne nodded politely, to which Michael returned a smile.

“Jeannie, are you ready to go in?” Monica asked.

She could not think of anything at the moment. All she cared about was what was going to happen next.

“Of course.” Jeanne smiled.

She smiled and walked in front of the couple in the next second.

Monica took a deep breath, thinking, ‘This is good. She has come prepared.’

At that thought, she decided to follow Jeanne while Michael quickly supported her.

Monica was also used to Michael taking care of her, so she was used to that kind of physical contact between them.

Behind her, Finn caught that scene, but he remained indifferent about it.

He was here only because of Fourth Master Swan’s orders.

Fourth Master Swan was afraid that Jeanne would suffer a loss, so he asked Finn to come over and take care of her.

Finn had also considered that he would see Monica and Michael together… Although he did not want to see Monica, he was here with one aim.

With that, he followed her into the Lawrences’ hall.
