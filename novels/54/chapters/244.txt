Chapter 245: Jeanne Escapes From Non-stop Danger

The streets of South Hampton City in the middle of the night.

The quiet night was disturbed by the sound of engines.

Some people who slept late could not help but sigh with emotion as they looked from their balconies at the few speeding cars on the street.

‘Are they shooting a movie?! Otherwise, how could it be so thrilling?’

Jeanne gripped the steering wheel tightly, beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

The cars behind her were following closely.

Her enemies had not expected her to be prepared the last time, but this time, it seemed like they were well-prepared.

Monica was so scared that she did not even dare to breathe.

‘Who the f*ck said that Jeanne did not know how to drive.

‘When she speeds up, I can’t even recognize her!’

“Jeannie, can we slow down a little? I know that your skills are amazing now, but you’re going too fast—ah!” Monica screamed.

It was because Jeanne suddenly made a sharp turn.

It was a 90-degree drift, and they directly entered a black alley.

The alley was a little dark.

They could not see the road ahead clearly, but Jeanne did not slow down.

Monica was scared to death.

If this continued, she was afraid that they would not be able to live to see the sun tomorrow.

The moment Monica broke down, she heard Jeanne say, “Monica, I’m trying to slow down now.”

This was because the cars behind her were now a little further away from them.

Jeanne could only rely on the friction on the ground to slow down. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Huh?” Monica was shocked.

‘What does she mean by trying to slow down?’

“Unfasten your seatbelt.”

“Jeannie.”

“Hurry up!” Jeanne said loudly.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She had never disobeyed Jeanne since she was young.

As such, she unfastened her seatbelt.

Jeanne gripped the steering wheel tightly, and with another drift, she entered another dark alley.

She continued to use the intense friction on the ground to slow down the car. Her eyes narrowed. “Monica, jump out of the car.”

Monica was shocked.

‘What is Jeanne talking about?!’

“After you jump out of the car, call Finn and ask him to come and pick you up!”

“What about you? What about you?” Monica asked Jeanne,

Although Monica was scared out of her wits, she still noticed that someone was chasing after them.

It was obviously very dangerous at this moment.

“I’ll distract them.”

“No, no!” Monica refused immediately, looking extremely agitated. “I can’t let you distract them. We have to go together. If we have to die, we have to die together!”

“I won’t die, but you’ll definitely be a burden to me!” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

Monica looked at Jeanne.

“I don’t have time to explain so much to you. You just have to trust me.” Jeanne did not have time to explain to Monica. She saw an alley ahead and gritted her teeth. “Monica, once I enter the alley ahead, open the car door and jump out of the car. After you jump out of the car, hide in a dark place and call Finn. Don’t go anywhere and wait for Finn to come to pick you up.”

“Jeannie...”

“Listen to me!” Jeanne’s tone was very cold.

Monica could not resist.

Jeanne drifted elegantly and quickly drove into the alley. She used the friction from the drift to continuously reduce the car’s speed to the lowest.

She shouted, “Jump out of the car now!”

Monica glanced at Jeanne.

“Monica!” Jeanne was very determined.

Monica’s eyes were red.

At this moment, she still followed Jeanne’s instructions and opened the car door. She gritted her teeth and jumped out.

Even though the car was very slow, after she jumped out, she still rolled on the ground.

Her entire body was in pain.

It was so painful that Monica felt like she was going to die. She lay on the ground and watched Jeanne’s car leave.

It was very fast and seemed to disappear in front of her eyes in an instant. All that was left was the sound of the engine.

Monica endured the pain and got up from the ground. Following Jeanne’s instructions, she dragged her body, which was covered in scratches, and hid beside a rubbish bin at the end of the alley.

As the lights were very dim, she could not be seen.

Just as she hid there, she saw a few black cars following the direction that Jeanne had just left in. They were pursuing her crazily.

Monica’s vision was a blur.

She had never experienced anything like this before. This was the first time she felt that death was so close to her.

As for Jeanne…

Jeanne... was still fighting for her life!

Monica quickly took out her phone.

She trembled for a long time before she took out her phone from her bag. She called Finn.

With her trembling fingers, she dialed Finn’s number.

However, the moment the call was connected, Finn hung up.

Monica called again.

The other party still hung up.

She kept calling and calling.

She was desperate.

The call was finally connected.
