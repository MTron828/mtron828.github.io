1361 The Wedding: I Never Agreed to the Breakup

Monica stopped caring about Finn. She figured he would leave on his own after he readjusted his emotions in a while anyway.

In fact, she did not have to worry about him getting hurt. Even if he did, he could protect himself.

With that, she lifted the blanket and went to the bathroom without any clothes on her.

At first, she was drunk and groggy, so she could still sleep. However, now that she was awake, she would feel very uncomfortable with the smell of alcohol.

Hence, she went to take a shower, and by the time she came out of the shower, Finn might have left.

As the sound of the shower came from the bathroom, Finn’s eyes were fixed on the bathroom. However, he wanted to leave, so he turned around and left.

Just like all the times he had had a conflict with Monica, he would instinctively choose to protect himself, and leaving now would be the best way to protect himself. After all, Monica had explained everything clearly, and she did not love him that much.

However, he suddenly stopped walking. Even though he knew that he was hurt, he did not want to protect himself. Instead, he wanted to get Monica.

He even realized that he could not accept what Monica said about her not loving him. He could not accept that she saved him because she did not want to live anymore and wanted to return what she owed him.

He was really panicking. For the first time in their relationship, he felt nervous and afraid.

No matter how many times they quarreled and broke up, deep down, he knew how Monica felt about him. However, this was the only time he felt that Monica was not lying.

He did not think that Monica was doing this to attract his attention. The current Monica was different from the Monica of the past, so she would not be childish enough to test him with such a thing.

She knew very well that once she said that, their relationship would be over. Yet, she said it; she had abandoned their relationship.

Finn suppressed his emotions, but deep down, he was starting to break down.

He had never thought that the fact that Monica did not love him would be a huge blow to him. No matter how hard he forced himself to accept it, he could not accept it.

He was still standing at the door of Monica’s room, motionless, when Monica came out of the shower with a towel casually wrapped around her body.

As she did not expect Finn to still be here, she furrowed her brows. Not only was she surprised, but there was also a hint of annoyance in her eyes. She looked as if she did not want to see him again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Finn could read her emotions clearly.

“Aren’t you going to leave?” Monica asked him.

Even though she had sobered up, she felt much better now.

The difference between her and others was that no matter how much she drank, as long as she rested, she would be full of energy. That was why she usually did not resist getting drunk.

“It’s late,” Monica urged again when she did not get Finn’s reply.

“We’re all going to Edward and Candice’s wedding tomorrow. I don’t think it’s good to be late to a wedding of that level.” Monica reminded him.

She wanted to wake Finn up from his trance.

In fact, Finn did not look like he had lost his mind. However, the fact that he did not leave exposed how oddly he was behaving.

The usual Finn would have slammed the door and left. He definitely would not stand there and do nothing after all that she had said.

Thinking that Finn did not hear her, Monica bit her lip. She then glanced at the alarm clock on the bedside table and saw that it was already 2 a.m.

Would they be able to get some sleep tonight?

At least, she wanted to get some sleep. She had reached the age where she needed to take good care of herself and did not want to stay up late.

Hence, at that moment, she walked up to Finn and pulled him with her hand. Since talking was useless, she chose to act it out.

The moment Finn saw what she was doing, he had a slight reaction.

She said, “Let’s go.”

She was really chasing him away.

“I’m going to rest. You can leave…Mm.” Monica was stunned.

At that moment, Finn suddenly held her body and kissed her fervently.
