1231 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jeanne stood at the door, quietly watching Edward decorate the nursery. As she watched him, her eyes turned red.

Just as she turned around to leave…

“Do you think it’s okay to put this wall lamp here?” Edward squatted down and turned on the warm light on the wall, but he did not turn around. He probably wanted to make a warm night light for the baby so that she would not be sleeping in complete darkness at night.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered, and she held the tears in her eyes back.

She said, “Sure.”

Edward followed Jeanne’s instructions and placed the warm-colored bunny-shaped wall lamp in a corner.

After putting it there, Edward got up from the ground and turned to Jeanne. “Do you want to do it together?”

Jeanne hesitated for two seconds, but immediately after, she said, “Alright.”

Since she could not do too much for the baby, she could only do her best.

Jeanne walked into the baby’s room, which was still a little messy at that moment. There were boxes and bags everywhere.

“Help me open the package,” Edward ordered.

“Okay.”

Jeanne sat on the pink sofa in the room and unwrapped the piled-up packages one by one.

From room decorations to baby toiletries, to baby clothes, and even a princess dress…

Jeanne was holding a pink dress in her hand. She then looked at the small dress, hair clip, and leather shoes. In the end, she was overwhelmed with emotions.

She quietly placed the clothes into a separate closet in the room and hung them up one by one. Soon, the pink walk-in closet was filled with baby clothes.

“There’s another set here.” Edward handed it to Jeanne.

Jeanne took it.

She looked very calm and could even chat with Edward calmly. “You bought a lot. I don’t think she’d be able to wear all these clothes.”

She remembered when she gave birth to George, she had just returned to the Delta Islands.

At that time, there were no children in the entire Delta Islands, and Kingsley seemed helpless when it came to children. Furthermore, she was not familiar with the people in the Delta Islands, including Kingsley, so she had to bring George up by herself. Occasionally, Lucy would come to help, but Lucy was also very unfamiliar with the children, so everyone was flustered.

As she did not know how to take care of children back then, George did not have many baby products or that many clothes either. Now that she thought about it, George seemed to have grown up with her clueless.

It made her wonder whether George would be jealous when he saw what they had prepared for his sister.

As Jeanne thought about it calmly, a faint smile remained on her face.

She was used to facing everything with the calmest attitude.

“They looked good, so I bought them all.” Edward replied, “I didn’t expect to buy so many.”

Jeanne nodded.

Although she felt like it was a waste, she also did not think there was anything wrong with it. Young girls would probably like all the beautiful clothes they could get their hands on.

“Do you like anything in particular?” Edward asked her.

“What?”

“Is there anything you like in particular? I’ll have her wear it in the future,” Edward said.

Jeanne’s smile was a little stiff.

It turned out Edward had bought so many of them just for her to pick what she liked and he would dress their daughter up in those clothes.

Jeanne shook her head. “No, they all look good.”

She did not want to interfere with her daughter’s life since she could not be with her daughter, and Edward did not force her to make a choice either.

Just like that, the two of them then quietly tidied up their daughter’s clothes.

As she walked out of the cloakroom, Edward was choosing milk powder.

There were more than ten cans of milk powder of different brands placed on a special shelf. Edward was looking at the instructions and formulas of the milk powder. “Take a look and see which brand our daughter should use in the future?”

Jeanne did not want to choose, but she felt that she could give some advice.

Hence, she walked over and, together with Edward, started to read the instructions for the milk powder.

Edward asked, “When George was a baby, what brand of milk powder did he have?”

“George didn’t have milk powder,” Jeanne said.

Edward raised his eyes and glanced at Jeanne.

Jeanne lowered her eyes to read the manual and said calmly, “My milk production was quite good back then.”

Even though she was in poor health, her milk production was alright. Perhaps it was because of that that George managed to grow up despite her being clueless.

However, now it seemed that she was really careless with George.
