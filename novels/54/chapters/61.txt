Chapter 62: Jeanne’s Identity Was Exposed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A red sports car was driving on the street.

Jeanne glanced at her ringing cell phone and casually put on her bluetooth earpiece.

“Are you going to the dinner party?” The person who called asked.

“Yes.”

“Alone?”

“Or else?”

“Wear something with more fabric,” Kingsley suggested.

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled up slightly. “Are you being hypocritical to only remind me when I’m out?”

“I didn’t ask you to seduce anyone.”

“You’re thinking too much,” Jeanne said coldly, “It’s up to me how I dress.”

“Protect yourself.”

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

She took off her earpiece and drove casually.

To be honest, she did not want to stay in South Hampton City for too long.

There was nothing worth remembering here.

Jeanne parked the car at the entrance of the banquet hall.

She got out of the car.

Outside the car, there were a lot of people going in and out.

The scene looked very lively.

MUK was a first-class foreign e-commerce enterprise, and Harken did not have a strong e-commerce platform up until now. Once MUK brought in their professional team, they were bound to make a big difference in Harken’s market, so there were a lot of local enterprises that flocked to them.

Of course, the Lockes were a cautionary tale. Most of the people were still in a wait-and-see state, and most of them were probably here tonight to find out the specific situation.

Jeanne scanned the electronic invitation card and walked into the hall.

Just as she walked in, a female voice suddenly sounded beside her. “Jeanne.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She saw Jasmine wearing a light blue dress and appeared with Eden.

At this moment, Jasmine was clearly surprised to see her.

“Why are you here?” Jasmine questioned.

She did not hear her mom say that Jeanne would come.

“I’m here to join in the fun.” Jeanne smiled.

“What are you thinking?” Jasmine’s face was full of disdain, “This is an official business banquet. Not everyone can come! Don’t you feel shameless to come without being invited? Wouldn’t Dad be mad again if he sees you?! Jeanne, no matter what, you’re still a Lawrence. Before you do anything, don’t you think about the honor of our family first?”

Jeanne glanced at Jasmine, her eyes moving slightly as she looked at Eden.

At that moment, Eden happened to look at Jeanne as well.

Their eyes met. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

His heart palpitated.

He gritted his teeth secretly and remained calm.

The way Jeanne was dressed tonight was enough to make people fantasize. At this moment, such a gaze caused his heart to tremble.

Jeanne did not fix her gaze on Eden, nor did she have the mood to figure out his thoughts. She said to Jasmine, “Don’t be too full of yourself. You’ll easily get slapped in the face.”

“Jeanne!” Jasmine suppressed her anger.

Jeanne walked past her and left immediately.

Jasmine was so angry that she gritted her teeth. She turned her head to look at Eden with some grievance. She seemed to see Eden’s fiery gaze fixed on Jeanne’s enchanting back. In the next second, it seemed to be an illusion.

Eden looked back at Jasmine with a cold gaze and said, “Don’t bother about her. If she doesn’t know what’s good for her, she’ll seek your death sooner or later.”

Jasmine nodded, but she did not feel good.

‘Did that flirtatious b*tch dress like this to seduce Eden?!

‘No!

‘I would never let such a thing happen!”

…

Jeanne walked calmly in the banquet hall.

Very soon, she attracted the attention of many people. Naturally, Alexander also saw her.

When he saw her, his expression changed immediately.

He brought Jenifer and quickly walked towards Jeanne. He lowered his voice and scolded her angrily, “What are you doing here? I didn’t ask you to come!”

“I came alone.”

“Don’t you have any self-awareness? How can someone like you come to a business dinner like this? This place is filled with important and influential people. This isn’t a so-called entertainment banquet. Go back immediately!”

Jeanne just looked at Alexander.

When George went to Angerburg for an interview, he had asked her to go home.

Now, he was also asking her to go home.

Jeanne asked, “Am I so shameful to you?”

“Enough.” Alexander did not seem to want to waste time with Jeanne. “If you’re capable, you should be invited to this banquet on your own. Don’t leech off me! Jasmine also came with her identity as the young madam of the Swans.”

Jeanne was speechless.

‘Did I leech off him?

‘What does he have for me to leech?!

‘What’s there for a “prestigious family” that’s heading towards destruction to show off about?!’

“Take advantage of the fact that the host of the banquet has yet to officially appear. Leave immediately. Otherwise, people will think that the Lawrences are unruly and will bring anyone here,” Alexander ordered coldly.

Just as he finished speaking, the venue suddenly fell silent.

Everyone turned to look at a man who appeared on the second floor. It was West, the host of this banquet and the CEO of MUK Group.

He walked down the stairs one step at a time with an imposing figure.

Alexander glared at Jeanne. Due to West’s appearance, if Jeanne left at this time, it would appear abrupt and rude. Hence, Alexander used his gaze to signal Jeanne to behave herself.

Jeanne pretended not to see.

West walked to the hall.

In the hall, many people took the initiative to approach him.

The workers around West blocked the others and watched him walk in one direction.

Alexander looked at West walking toward him and felt a little excited.

When West stopped in front of him, he quickly reached out his hand. “Mr. West...”

“Girl, I was wondering where you could hide!” West directly pulled Jeanne into his arms.

Jeanne smiled.

West was about 45 years old. He was very tall and burly, so Jeanne looked extremely petite in his arms.

Everyone was shocked.

‘What’s the situation now?’

West, the legendary godfather of e-commerce, had an... unspeakable relationship with Jeanne, the so-called Eldest Young Lady Lawrence?!

This was breaking news!

Everyone in the banquet hall had their eyes on them.

This included the awkward Alexander, as well as Eden and Jasmine, who were not too far away.

Jasmine’s eyes were filled with jealousy. She clenched her fists tightly and glared fiercely at Jeanne, who was the center of attention.

At that moment, Eden’s gaze also changed slightly.

‘What kind of shady business had Jeanne done all these years abroad?!

‘Seducing men everywhere?!’

West finally let go of Jeanne after a long time. He completely ignored the gazes of the people around him. He deliberately said to Jeanne in a reproachful tone, “You’re really bold to have gone missing without informing your godfather!”

‘Godfather?!’

Everyone was shocked again.

“Didn’t I come to surprise you?” Jeanne had a fawning look on her face.

“Don’t give me that.” West was deliberately angry, “If you want to give me a surprise, go back to work at MUK. In the future, I’ll leave Harken’s e-commerce market to you to handle. I can then spend more time with your godmother.”

‘What?!’

Everyone was shocked.

‘Harken’s e-commerce market would be left to Ms. Lawrence?!’

“Godfather, don’t joke. You’re in the prime of your life, and yet you want to retire? Godmother won’t allow it.” Jeanne refused.

She actually refused West.

There were so many reputable companies in South Hampton City that wanted to cooperate with MUK, and yet Ms. Lawrence said she did not want to take it over?!

Everyone suddenly felt that Ms. Lawrence, who had returned this time, was not simple at all!
