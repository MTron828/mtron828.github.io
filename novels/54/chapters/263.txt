Chapter 264: Fourth Master Swan Treats Jeanne

At night.

It was very late at night.

Monica was sitting in the passenger seat.

Finn drove expressionlessly toward the Swans’ manor at a fast speed.

He looked at the man standing behind through the rearview mirror.

At that moment, he seemed to have turned around and looked at Monica. He looked at her lips, but it also seemed to be an illusion.

He was just driving seriously.

Monica sat in the car. Her mind was completely focused on Jeanne, who was lying in the arms of Fourth Master Swan.

She did not know how serious Jeanne’s injuries were.

She only knew that Jeanne was extremely weak at that moment.

Monica looked where the car was heading and knew that they were going straight to the Swans’ manor. She could not help but ask Finn, “Shouldn’t we go to the hospital? Send Jeanne to the hospital. Jeanne looks so badly injured.”

Finn did not reply.

It seemed like he could not bother responding to her.

Monica sometimes felt that she was making a fool of herself in front of Finn.

She was asking for an insult.

Finn’s disdain for her was obvious.

Monica bit her lip.

She was a little angry, but what could she do?!

What she said to Finn was useless!

She was useless.

The car quickly drove into the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.

It was a peaceful garden.

Finn got out of the car and opened the car door for Edward.

Edward carried Jeanne, who was already in light sleep, and walked into the main hall.

Finn followed behind.

Monica also followed anxiously.

Edward directly carried Jeanne into his room.

At this moment, Teddy was also awakened by the commotion. When he got up from his bed, he saw that everyone was covered in blood. He was so scared that he could not react for a long time.

Edward gently placed Jeanne on the bed.

He then said to Teddy, “Go to the old master’s place to see how Nox is doing.”

Teddy was stunned. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘What happened to Young Master Winter?!’

Nonetheless, at this moment, he did not dare to ask too much when he saw the situation. He quickly responded, “Okay.”

Teddy quickly left.

“Finn.” After Edward placed Jeanne on the bed, he called out to Finn.

Finn had gone to Edward’s room to take out a huge medical bag.

He walked to Jeanne’s side and started to help her check on her injuries.

Edward went to the bathroom and fetched a basin of water. He cooperated with Finn to clean up Jeanne’s wounds bit by bit.

Jeanne, who was already a little sleepy, frowned at this moment.

She bit her lip and slowly opened her eyes.

It was because she felt pain.

A kind of pain that was difficult to endure.

The person beside her seemed to have sensed that she was awake, so he said, “We must disinfect and clean up your wounds, otherwise they’ll easily get infected.”

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan.

She saw him sitting next to her, and his voice seemed to be very gentle.

He gently leaned close to her cheek and planted a kiss on her face which was covered in blood.

Jeanne bit her lip even harder.

Edward said, “It’ll be a little painful. Bear with it.”

Jeanne nodded.

She nodded silently.

Finn treated her wounds very quickly.

He knew very well that when wounds were being disinfected, they might be more painful to bear with, so he would try to reduce Jeanne’s pain as much as possible.

As he treated the wounds, he said to Edward, “The wound on her back is a little deep, I think we need to stitch it up.”

“Do you still have the anesthetic?” Edward asked.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“I’ll go and prepare it.”

“There’s no need for that,” Jeanne said. “Just stitch it up.”

Finn and Edward looked at her like that.

“I can endure it.”

Finn looked at Edward as if he was asking for his opinion.

Edward kept looking at Jeanne. Seeing the determination in her eyes, he nodded slightly.

“Get something for Jeanne to bite on,” Finn said, “I’m afraid that she’ll bite her tongue.”

It would be excruciating when Jeanne was stitched up.

Finn was afraid that Jeanne would not be able to hold on and accidentally bite her tongue.

Edward directly placed her hand in Jeanne’s mouth.

Jeanne was stunned.

Edward said, “I just washed it.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Edward said, “Bite it and make me feel better.”

It was the first time that Jeanne heard Fourth Master Swan say such words. He said such apologetic words.

In the end.

Jeanne did not have any right to blame Fourth Master Swan.

She had indeed become entangled with Melody because of him, but it did not mean that he had to come and save her. He did not have that responsibility.

She was lucky to be able to wait for him to show up.
