Chapter 254: Jeanne Resists: Do You Know Who I Am?!

Micheal looked concerned.

It was obvious that he felt sorry for Monica.

Monica did not speak, but her eyes were teary.

She did not know why she felt so uncomfortable at this moment!

It was so uncomfortable that she felt like the sky was about to collapse.

Why was it so difficult to meet Fourth Master Swan?!

Why was it so difficult to meet Fourth Master Swan at such a crucial moment?!

…

Under the same sky in a different place.

Jeanne opened her eyes in piercing pain.

When she fainted, she thought that she might never be able to open her eyes again.

Fortunately, Melody’s hatred toward her had really reached the point of insanity. Melody must have wanted to torture her ruthlessly before she died. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As long as she was still alive…

As long as there was still time to live, Jeanne felt that there was still a glimmer of hope.

Jeanne stared straight at the person in front of her.

At this moment, she was also sizing up her surroundings.

They were no longer in the rural area. This was clearly a somewhat shabby and gloomy house. There was nothing inside. It looked like an abandoned house, and inside this abandoned house, there were at least ten bodyguards in black suits. All of them were tall and had terrifying looks.

Among these tall and sturdy people stood a petite and exquisite woman. She wore black tight-fitting suspenders, a pair of black tight-fitting shorts, and a pair of high-heeled shoes with low boots. The heels of her shoes seemed to have dried blood stains.

The woman looked at Jeanne coldly. When she saw that Jeanne had woken up, the smile on her face became even colder.

“You’re awake?” Melody asked Jeanne.

She asked her condescendingly.

At this moment, Melody was high and mighty.

She looked down at Jeanne and sneered, “Aren’t you very powerful? Why do you look like you’re dead now?”

At this moment, Jeanne was really unable to speak.

It was because of the intense pain in her body. She was enduring it and could not speak as a result.

Now that Jeanne had regained consciousness, she was very clear that she was woken up by cold water just now. She was woken up by cold salt water.

Now that the salt water had invaded her tattered skin, it was so painful that her body was convulsing uncontrollably.

“Why? Is it very painful?” Melody looked at Jeanne.

Looking at Jeanne lying on the ground with her face twisted in pain while her body convulsed, Melody was extremely happy.

Melody had a bad personality since she was young.

She would use all means to make those who provoked her suffer!

Nonetheless, she was never as pleased as she was torturing Jeanne at this moment!

Looking at Jeanne’s pained expression, she felt incredibly good!

Melody suddenly lifted her foot.

Her high heels stepped directly on Jeanne’s tightly clenched fist.

She exerted force.

“Ah!” Jeanne could not help but cry out.

The pain caused her to be beyond recognition.

Melody enjoyed it very much. She enjoyed looking at Jeanne’s pained expression at this moment.

She used all her strength to step on the back of Jeanne’s hand. At the same time, she picked up the phone and dialed Eden’s number.

It was time for him to come and torture Jeanne as well.

Melody had always felt that Eden was as cruel as her.

She needed someone to be with her so that Jeanne would be in unbearable pain before she died.

Melody called Eden.

The call was picked up.

“I’ll give you an address. You can come over now. You can come over and see how Jeanne is living a life worse than death,” Melody said with cruelty.

At this moment, Eden had walked to one side without anyone noticing.

In fact, no one would notice him during the fight in front of him.

He walked a little further and picked up the call. “You can torture her. I’ll pass.”

“This isn’t your style!” Melody’s eyes narrowed.

“After all, we were once in love. I’m afraid that I’ll go soft if I see her in such a miserable state.”

“Ha.” Melody sneered.

“That said, I advise you not to spend too much time. The longer you take, the more things will happen. It’s best to end it quickly,” Eden reminded Melody.

It seemed that it would not be that easy to get his fourth uncle to save Jeanne.

Despite that, he was afraid that things would suddenly change.

Moreover, Monica did not seem to have given up on meeting his fourth uncle.

If his fourth uncle really wanted to save Jeanne, it was highly possible.

His fourth uncle could definitely save her.

“I don’t need you to remind me,” the person on the other end said coldly. Then, she abruptly hung up the phone.

The moment Melody hung up the phone, she fiercely scolded, “Men are indeed useless!”
