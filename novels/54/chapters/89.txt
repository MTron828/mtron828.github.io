Chapter 90: By All Means

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the phone, Melody said seriously, “Explain it clearly.”

“I have a document in my hands right now. It’s a proposal that Jeanne has prepared to discuss a collaboration with MUK. The proposal is very well written. It’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s very difficult for ordinary people to surpass it.”

“Get to the main point.” Melody was impatient as if she could not bear hearing any praise for Jeanne.

“The point is, I’ll directly use this document of Jeanne’s to discuss a collaboration with MUK, but I can’t go as the Swan Enterprise. The Swan Enterprise currently has no plans to invest outside, so I found another company that I can control to discuss the collaboration. That said, this company has a weakness, which is its funds are limited. If I rashly use the loan of the Swanhaven, it’ll easily arouse suspicion,” Eden said, “Now, I choose to use Jeanne’s plan, which means there’ll be two identical plans. In this way, the way we can have the most direct and effective advantage is the price. So, I still need an additional investment.”

“How much?”

“This is a three billion dollars collaboration case. It’ll be safer to increase the investment by 5%. Currently, the amount of investment I can take out is only two billion dollars.”

“So, you’re 1.1 billion dollars short?” Melody said straightforwardly. She did not like how Eden was beating around the bush.

“Yes.”

“When do you need it?”

“Right away.”

There was a moment of silence on the other side.

“The sooner, the better. Currently, it’s a time match. Now, Jeanne is going to report to the Lawrence Enterprise’s leaders. If they’re fast, it can be settled in the morning, and the contract can be discussed in the afternoon. We have to hurry before that,” Eden reminded.

“I’ll call you in a while.”

Melody hung up the phone and dialed Michael’s number.

Michael picked up. “Melody.”

“Do you trust Eden?” Melody asked immediately.

“In what way?”

Melody told Michael what Eden had said just now.

Michael answered seriously, “The Swans have always been under Fourth Master Swan’s control. Eden doesn’t say it out loud, but he’s always brooding over it. He always wants to prove himself. In addition, under the Swans’ education, he still has his own abilities. If you want someone to help you do things in the business world, he’s the best candidate. This is just one of the reasons. Secondly, Eden has very strong self-esteem. Back then, Jeanne was abandoned by him. Now that Jeanne has returned to shine and even went against him everywhere, he won’t tolerate it. Therefore, you’re not the only person who wants to destroy Jeanne’s reputation. Eden’s desire in this aspect is also very strong.”

“You mean that Eden is trustworthy,” Melody said.

“In dealing with Jeanne, it’s worth it,” Michael gave a positive answer.

“Okay.” Melody was about to hang up the phone.

“Melody, are you sure you want to deal with Jeanne like this?”

“Why not?” Melody’s tone was not good. “Are you worried about your old lover, Monica?”

“That’s not it.” Michael directly cleared his name. “I’m just worried that if this matter is not done well and if Jeanne gets hold of something, you are, after all, a princess of a country. I’m afraid that at that time, given your identity, it won’t be easy for you to step down.”

“Jeanne doesn’t have the ability to do that. Taking a step back, even if such a day comes, my dad will still protect me. I won’t hide it from you. The matter of me marrying Edward was arranged by my father. Previously, my dad asked Master Swan to discuss the marriage between me and Edward, but Master Swan rejected him. Since the Swans have a special status, my dad couldn’t force it. He asked me to have a relationship with Edward on a personal level and not on a national level. So, my dad supports me in everything I do now!”

“Since it’s the leader’s arrangement, I won’t say anything more.”

“Michael, we grew up together. I trust you nobody but you. If it weren’t for the fact that your family has enough power in the government and the public, my father might’ve even arranged for me to marry you. Although we don’t have that kind of affection for each other, no matter what, I still hope that you can develop better in the future. As for whether Monica will drag you down, you’d better think it through.”

“Getting back together with Monica is not only my decision. It’s also your dad’s decision,” Michael said straightforwardly.

“What?” Melody was a little surprised.

“Don’t worry about politics for the time being. Your current task is to marry Fourth Master Swan. Don’t think too much about anything else.”

“Okay.” Melody did not ask anymore.

It was useless to ask too much about politics.

After hanging up the phone, Melody quickly transferred the money to the account designated by Eden.

Eden made a simple modification to the collaboration case and personally handed it to his partner, Cameron Hall. He also emphasized some negotiation skills and contingency plans for unexpected accidents.

Cameron had been in the business world for many years. He started from scratch and relied on luck to develop. At the moment, he had some small business dealings with the Swans. He had taken the initiative to fawn over Eden when he stepped into the business world. Eden was new to the business world and needed help. After a few encounters, he felt that Cameron had little tricks and was obedient, so he had been secretly interacting with him!

Extensive preparation would eventually pay off. Now was finally the time for him, Eden, to show off his skills!

The corners of his mouth curled up into a cold smile.

‘What’s the use of Jeanne’s strong abilities?

‘In the business world, one has to resort to all sorts of tricks!’

…

Jeanne spent an entire morning trying to convince all the board members. Without any changes, she had completely finalized the collaboration proposal.

She returned to her office.

Jeanne had not caught her breath when her phone suddenly rang.

She glanced at the incoming call and picked it up. “I’m very busy. Make it short.”

“I’ve found a helper for you.” Kingsley was really concise. “He’ll go to South Hampton City today and report to you tomorrow.”

“Who is it?” Jeanne put the phone to her ear and sorted out her proposal.

“It’s Miles.”

“Oh.” Jeanne responded and asked, “He’s free?”

“If you need me, I’m free too.”

Jeanne smiled. The moment she wanted to hang up the phone, she suddenly thought of something. “By the way, the last time I asked you about Fourth Master Swan and the third princess of the Sanders, you still haven’t answered me.”

“I thought you had given up on being tangled with Fourth Master Swan.” Kingsley was very serious.

“I’ve disappointed you. I’ve gotten more involved in him.”

Kingsley was speechless. “Melody is very active about her marriage with Fourth Master Swan, and the royal family also supports it. To put it bluntly, your enemy is Melody or Warren Sanders.”

Warren was the head of Harken and was also the highest ruler of Harken.

Harken had a hereditary system.

Warren was the second leader of the Sanders, succeeding his father’s position.

His father seized power from the previous emperor of the Duncans. Zachary of the Swans was originally the defense minister of the Duncans who held military power. At that time, during the internal war, he defected to Warren and helped the Sanders take over. Then, Zachary returned the military power and resigned from his position to live in seclusion.

It was rumored that Zachary was guilty toward his former leader, so he chose to abandon politics and enter the business world. Regardless of whether the rumors were true or not, in the end, Zachary was still the founding hero of the Sanders. Therefore, the Sanders always treated the Swans with respect.

Due to that, even if the Sanders took the initiative to have a marriage agreement, if the Swans did not agree, the Sanders could only give up.

If the Sanders still wanted to form a marriage alliance with the Swans, the only way left was to let Melody and Fourth Master Swan fall in love themselves.

After one big round, Jeanne roughly understood everything.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
