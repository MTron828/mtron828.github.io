Chapter 577: Don’t Show Up in Front of Me, I Think You’re Disgusting

“Alright.” Kingsley agreed.

“If it’s a death by accident, that means the accident will happen in the house. If that’s the case...” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Find a way to install mini surveillance cameras in all corners of the manor. Once Alexander makes any move, we’ll know.”

“I’ll arrange for that.” Kingsley nodded his head.

“I have a feeling it will be a matter of a few days.” Jeanne speculated. “Once he makes up his mind, Alexander will do whatever he can.”

Kingsley agreed.

“Back then.” Jeanne clutched the phone, her expression somewhat grim. “My mother’s death… Have we not found any evidence?”

“The crime scene was so perfect that we couldn’t find a single loophole, and even the evidence has been cleaned up.”

Jeanne pursed his lips.

“However, it’s definitely not an accident,” Kingsley affirmed.

“But I don’t think Jonathan and Alexander are smart enough to do that,” Jeanne said.

She might not have known this before, but after interacting with them, she did not think Alexander and Jonathan were capable enough to carry out everything so perfectly. They did not even leave any evidence behind.

“I don’t think so either.” Kingsley said, “That’s why I’m still investigating it.”

“Alright.” Jeanne also did not say more.

Anyway, she believed Kingsley.

“I’m hanging up now.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fourth Master Swan has left South Hampton City?” Kingsley asked.

“You seem to know everything.”

“After all, I’ve been keeping an eye on him.”

“Yes, he has left. Is there a problem with that?”

“No, I’m just asking.”

Jeanne also did not like to speculate on Kingsley.

It’s not that she did not want to, but rather, it had nothing to do with her even if she did. No matter what, she had to listen to his orders to make life easier for herself.

After that, she hung up the phone.

All of the Lawrences should pay back in blood and double the amount!

Her eyes moved as she looked at the caller ID on her phone.

She adjusted her emotions and picked up the call. “Monica.”

“Where are you?”

“What’s up?”

“I’ve moved to a new house.” There was a little excitement in Monica’s tone.

Jeanne admired Monica’s ability to recover.

“Moved where?” Jeanne asked.

“I’ll give you the address. Do you want to come over and sit down?”

“No.” Jeanne refused flatly because she was a little tired.

Moreover, she did not want to be tormented by Monica now that the latter’s mood had stabilized.

“In that case, forget it.” Monica was a little angry.

“It’s a little late, and I have to work early tomorrow morning. There are so many things I need to do.” Jeanne found some excuses.

“Okay, okay. I know you’re a busy person.”

“If I have time, I’ll be sure to come over. However, that said,” Turnip said nervously, “How many people live in this house?”

“How many people?” The next second, Monica understood. “Jeanne, what do you take me for? Of course, I live by myself.”

“I was just asking.” Jeanne sighed in relief.

“How can you even ask that? It’s like you’re questioning my character.” Now, Monica was angry.

Speechless, Jeanne changed the subject. “I see Michael’s popularity has picked up very quickly this week, and voting closes at 10 a.m. tomorrow. According to this trend, he should be able to catch up.”

“Yes, so my sacrifice wasn’t completely worthless. At least Michael turned his image around and got his due because of me.”

“Yes, yes, yes. You’re the greatest.” Jeanne rolled her eyes.

Monica said, “Well, that’s all. I’m still finishing up some things for my new home. Make sure you come over sometime!”

“Okay.”

With that, Monica hung up the phone, and just after that, her phone rang.

She picked up the call. “Michael.”

“Have you unpacked everything?” The person on the other end of the call was concerned.

“It’s alright. The furniture came with the house anyway, so there’s nothing to unpack.” In fact, the house came well equipped.

“Do you want me to come over and take a look?”

“No. You just got off work, right?” Monica asked.

She did not hear an answer, so it meant he tacitly agreed to that statement.

“I’m sure you haven’t eaten dinner. Hurry up and fill your stomach first. I can handle it myself.”

“Alright.” Michael nodded.

“I’m hanging up now.”

“Okay.”

Monica hung up the phone and took a deep breath. In fact, she still wished to keep her distance from Michael.
