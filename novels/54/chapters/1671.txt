“Could you see their genders?” Jeanne asked curiously.

Monica’s mood instantly worsened, and Jeanne could read Monica’s emotions immediately.

“Are they boys?”

“One is,” Monica replied.

“That’s good. A daughter and a boy, what a good match.”

“No.” Monica said, “One is a boy, and the other hasn’t been confirmed yet.” Jeanne remained silent.

“Actually, it’s not bad to have two boys. I like George.” Monica started to comfort herself.

Jeanne could not help but laugh. “That’s true.”

“No, it’s not! I must have a daughter!” Monica suddenly lost her temper.

It seemed she could not accept that she was having two sons. She loved Finn so much that she really wanted to give him a mini version of her.

“Calm down. Pregnant women should try not to get angry. It’s not good for the babies.”

“Are you sure that’s true?”

“Yes. Otherwise, why would the doctors advise you to stay calm?” Jeanne said seriously.

Monica was convinced.

“By the way, are you heading back now?” Jeanne asked.

“Yeah.” Monica nodded. “I really can’t stand how slow Finn is driving. Anyone with a heart attack will have a relapse!”

“You have to understand that he’s a new father.”

If not, what else could he do?

“Take good care of yourself. I’ll hang up now.” Jeanne just wanted to ask about how Monica was doing and nothing else.

However, Monica quickly stopped her. “Wait, I have something to tell you.”

“That sc*m, Nox.” Monica planned to tell Jeanne about Nox.

“Did he offend you?”

“Have you seen the news about him?” Monica asked.

“I have.” Jeanne, on the other hand, was calm. “I had a feeling this day would come.”

“…How did you know?”

“Isn’t it karma?”

“That’s true.” Monica was instantly calm.

“What do you want to say about him?”

“He’s now pursuing Shelly, and it also seems to us that’s what he’s doing, right? And we think there’s nothing wrong with it, even though it might be a little difficult for him to woo her over. But do you know the truth? Shelly has a boyfriend now, and Nox is deliberately ruining her relationship. He doesn’t like Shellv at all.” Monica said through gritted her teeth.

Jeanne frowned and immediately denied it. “That’s not possible. Shelly and Nox have no grudges against each other, so Nox would never take revenge on Shelly like this.”

“That’s why I said he’s a sc*mbag!”

“I think there might be a misunderstanding. No matter how bad Nox is as a person, he can’t be that bad.”

“I think you’re biased toward Nox,” Monica said angrily

“I’m just stating the facts. How about this?” Jeanne did not want to anger the pregnant woman, so she said, “I’ll ask Nox what’s going on.”

“Make sure you get him to tell you what’s going on, or don’t blame me for being rude to him.”

“Why do you care so much?” Jeanne was a little amused.

“Shelly helped me once, and I can’t just stand by and watch her get bullied by

Nox.”

“I see.” She knew Monica would not be so nosy to meddle in other people’s business, so she nodded. “Alright, I’ll clarify the situation first.” “Okay, remember to reply to me once you’ve clarified it with him.”

“Alright.”

As soon as Jeanne hung up, she did not hesitate to call Nox. Nox had once saved her life, so her impression of Nox had also changed, and he was not just Edward’s friend anymore.

When Nox saw Jeanne’s phone call, he knew that Jeanne wanted to ask about his relationship, just like Monica.

He picked up the call and said in despair, “Yes, I’m pursuing Shelly. I’ve fallen in love with her. If you want to take a jab at me, go ahead! After that, I have something important to do.”

Jeanne was speechless. She could not believe that Nox was still so stupid after so many years.

“I’m not taking a jab at you. I just want to ask you, do you really like Shelly?”

“Nonsense, if I don’t like her, why would I do all that to woo her over? I still have an image to keep! I’m a big shot in Harken!”

“I heard Shelly has a boyfriend?”

…Yes.” Nox paused before he admitted, “She does have a boyfriend, but I can’t accept it. I can’t stand seeing her with any other man, so I want to snatch her back for myself, and I will do anything to get her back to my side! If you want to look down on me, go ahead. Anyway, that’s who I am.. I’m just that bad of a person!”
