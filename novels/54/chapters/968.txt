969 Since You Refuse to Help Monica, I’ll Have To Do It, No?

“It’s not that you have a grudge against someone. It’s that your son has become a scapegoat!”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Get lost! I don’t want to see you guys for even a second. If you don’t leave, I’ll beat you to death!” The man’s anger at the moment made him look extremely ferocious.

“I know it’s useless for me to say anything now, but if you’re willing to perform an autopsy on the body, everything will come to light–”

“Get lost!” The man refused to listen to Jeanne’s explanation and brutally pushed her back a few steps.

Monica quickly supported Jeanne, who shook her head, indicating that she was fine. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Just as she was about to go forward and persuade the other party, Monica walked in front of her.

Before Jeanne could react, Monica suddenly knelt in front of the couple.

The man, who was so angry that he wanted to kill Jeanne and Monica, was momentarily stunned by Monica’s sudden action.

“No matter what the reason is, I know that we can’t make up for the loss of your child. I won’t deny that everything we’ve done is to clear Cardellini Enterprise’s name, and I know we’re selfish, but we have no choice. My father is lying in the hospital now, and you have no idea how serious his condition is because of this.

“My father has always had a heart condition. He had a heart bypass surgery a few years ago, and the doctor suggested that he should rest more, but my father didn’t listen and spent most of his energy on work. Now, he has finally collapsed and is preparing for a heart transplant. However, the success rate of heart transplant surgery is only 50 percent, which means that there is a 50 percent chance that my father will die on the operating table.

“And even at a time like this, my dad is still concerned about the accident. If it weren’t for my mom, my dad would probably be at work with an IV drip. I can swear on my life here that my father is serious and responsible in his work. The supervision of drugs has been so strict that it’s crazy. There’s absolutely no chance that something is wrong with the drugs.

“I know you might not believe me even if I tell you this now. Of course, it doesn’t matter to you. My only hope is that you can give my family a chance to prove our innocence so that my father can go for his surgery in peace and bring justice to the person who really caused the death of your child.”

After that, Monica fell to her knees in front of the couple.

Jeanne, who was watching from the side, clenched her fists. At that moment, she wanted to pull Monica away, but she held back.

She had to admit that Monica’s way of playing the emotional card made it easier for the other party to relate to them. However, she did not expect Monica would be able to do what she just did.

In her memory, Monica was still the girl who needed protection, the little girl who would habitually hide behind her whenever something happened. Since when Monica did become responsible and mature?

However, it still pained her to see Monica like that as she had never thought that Monica would grow up in such a way.

On second thought, Monica had experienced a lot during this period of time. Yet, she endured it and was growing stronger instead.

Jeanne looked at Monica, who was on her knees and begging the other party for help.

Naturally, Monica could not convince the couple.

Jeanne said, “As a parent myself, I know how painful it is to see my child die. However, rather than letting my child die just like that, I would want to find out the truth so that my child can rest in peace. I hope you can agree for us to do an autopsy on the child. We will definitely give you a satisfactory answer!”

The couple looked at Monica on her knees crying and at Jeanne, who was so sincere and firm that they could not refuse her. The couple’s tears kept falling, and no one agreed.

They were just unwilling to accept the truth.

That was until the staff member came to remind them, “It’s your turn.”

“No!” The woman suddenly broke down. “Hubby, I don’t want to send our son in. I don’t want to send him in!”

At the thought that all that would be left of her son would be ashes after she sent him in, she broke down.

The woman’s crying made the man feel bad, so he said, “Please don’t do this. If you don’t send him, how could our child rest in peace?”

“Hubby, I can’t lose my son. I really can’t…”

The couple cried their hearts out, and the woman was so sad that she passed out from crying.

Shocked, the man quickly called out to her, “Honey! Honey, please don’t do this. What should I do…”

“Take your wife to the hospital immediately.” Jeanne quickly said.

“Okay. Okay.” The man kept nodding.

At that moment, he was already beside himself with panic.

“Do you still want to cremate this body?” the staff member asked.

He appeared very calm and a little too cold-blooded, probably because he had witnessed too many such scenes.

The man hesitated. Looking at his wife who had fainted in his arms, he said, “Not for now.”

“Can you leave it to us?” Jeanne asked, “Can you leave your child with us for the time being?”

At that moment, the man could not take it anymore. “I hope you can give me the truth!”

“I promise.”

With that, the man strode away with his wife in his arms.

“Monica, take them to the hospital. I’ll come over after I take the child away.”

“Alright.” Monica hurriedly got up from the ground, wipe her tears, and follow the couple out.

Monica let them get into her car. Then, she gritted her teeth and sped off.

When a person was pushed to the extreme, the body would react instinctively.

In the meantime, Jeanne had moved the ice coffin containing the child’s body to the crematorium and called Finn. “Dr. Jones.”

“It’s you, isn’t it, Jeanne?”

“It’s me. I need you to do me a favor.”

“Go ahead,” the other party spoke bluntly.

“Help me find a forensic doctor, one with the most authority in Harken.”

Finn’s eyes narrowed. “What are you planning to do? ”

“Since you refuse to help Monica, I’ll have to do it, no?” Jeanne’s tone was sarcastic.

Just because Monica could not think of many things did not mean that Finn could not.

However, she had no reason to blame Finn for anything.

After all, the two of them were separated and had nothing to do with each other, so they had no obligation to do anything for each other.

In fact, Finn did not give Monica any hope of reconciling the relationship, so he did the right thing.

She just wanted to vent her emotions at that moment.

Why could Finn be so carefree? Meanwhile, that silly Monica had been paying for her past mistakes alone?
