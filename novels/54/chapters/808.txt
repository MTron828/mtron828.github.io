She told him everything. She even revealed all her stupidity and incompetence.

Nox was silent for a few seconds.

Monica held her phone and did not speak. She was sobbing now, but she tried holding it in, enduring the twitching of her body.

The two of them were silent.

Then, Nox replied, “If that’s the case, i won’t give you Jeanne’s contact information. ”

Monica bit her lip, with her tears flowing down her face.

“Have you thought about it? Michael is currently the most valued talent in the Sanders. At the age of 25, he became the youngest director in the history of Harken. He is currently running for a seat in the parliament and has even confirmed his participation in the annual National Reserve Talent Conference. He will stop at nothing for his career in Harken, and he will soon follow his father’s footsteps to become powerful and influential. You want Jeanne to kill such a powerful person?” Nox asked her coldly and directly.

Monica just kept biting her lip as she could not refute.

“Monica, if you’re really Jeanne’s friend, you shouldn’t drag your friend down with you into this. Instead, you should think of how to solve the problem yourself!” Nox said bluntly, “I’ll remind you one last time. Finn, Edward, and I have a great relationship, and Edward hates you as much as I hate you! So, you’d better not disturb Jeanne. Not only will she be risking her life for you, but you might even cause a conflict between Edward and Jeanne. You should know your place.”

After that, Nox hung up the phone abruptly.?It was as if he did not want to waste any more time on her.

Monica also quietly put down her phone and just stood there.

Nox was not wrong.

Michael had threatened her just now, and she was the one who took it for granted. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In the past, she had always thought that Jeanne would be willing to do anything for her even if she had to go bankrupt. Hence, she did not hesitate to ask Jeanne for help. She felt that their relationship back then could not be compared to those worldly possessions.

Yet now, she suddenly felt like that was not the case.

Jeanne had gone through a lot to achieve her own happiness, and it was also very difficult for Jeanne to get to where she was now. What right did Monica have to destroy everything she had? What right did Monica have to make others bear the consequences of her mistakes?

Nox’s words had woken her up.

She should solve her own matters herself. However, how should she solve this? How could she fight with Michael?

Michael had the entire media under his control, and no one would believe that they had no feelings for each other.

Moreover, everyone firmly believed that they would get married on the 15th of next month.

If she did not marry Michael, what would Michael do? Would he force her to get married? What would he use to force her to get married?

No. She would not be forced by Michael.

In that case, she had to leave South Hampton City and Harken immediately.

Once he could not find her, she refused to believe that he could lie to the media for long.

With that thought, Monica quickly returned home, found her identity card and passport, packed her luggage, took all her cards with her, and went to the airport.

She did not have the ability to resist Michael.

After all, she could not even think of any way to break up with Michael, so she could only escape.

Since she could not afford to offend him, she would hide forever.

She went to the airport, showed her identification, and bought a plane ticket to a random destination.

Just as the staff member had taken her identity card, he said apologetically, “I’m sorry, Ms. Cardellini, but you can’t buy a ticket for the time being. ”

“Why?” Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

“This is the notice we received, but we don’t know the specific reason.”

“If you don’t know the reason, then why can’t I buy a ticket? Give me an explanation. I want an explanation immediately!” Monica’s voice was loud.

It instantly attracted the attention of a lot of people at the airport.

In fact, she hoped that everyone would come to see her.

It would be best if they posted her on a popular mobile app and make her a trending topic by reporting how rude she was.

“Ms. Cardellini, calm down. I’ve just contacted our head of department. He’ll come over in a while to explain to you in private.”

Monica glared at the staff member, but in the end, she held it in.
