Chapter 559: Uproar About the Layoffs, Jeanne Against Lawrence Enterprise’s Senior Management

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In Bamboo Garden, Monica had just told Michael that she would buy the house herself when she saw Finn show up.

She was a little stunned as she held onto her phone.

Michael called her name out a few times, “Monica.”

Only then did Monica come back to her senses, and she walked to the side with her phone in hand.

Nox looked at Monica walking away and turned around to face Finn, who was obviously not in a good mood.

“I didn’t know she was here,” Nox lied.

Of course, Finn did not believe him.

He said, “I’m going back.”

“Finn.” Nox pulled him back. “Why are you afraid of her? She’s the one who should be hiding.”

“I just don’t want to see her.”

“If you don’t want to see her, she’s the one who should get lost. Straighten your back for me!” Nox had a stern look on his face.

However, Finn was not that childish.

He just felt that since he did not want the matter to be a burden to him anymore, he did not want to bring any unnecessary trouble upon himself.

Monica came back after the call ended.

Nox looked at her and could not help but say sarcastically, “Already talking about buying a new house, huh? Are you moving in together so soon?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Monica could not be bothered with Nox, who deliberately added, “You haven’t even slept with Finn after so many years, yet now you’re sleeping with Michael just after you broke up with him? Monica, are you that impatient?”

“Nox, you’re deliberately picking on me today, aren’t you?” Monica was furious.

“I’m just telling the truth. Why? You can do it, but no one else can say it?”

“F*ck!” Monica swore out of frustration. Then, she picked up her crutches and was about to fight Nox.

Luckily, Nox was quick to react by grabbing Monica’s crutches.

“You’re quite fierce.” Nox held himself back from reacting.

As Monica could not get her crutches out of Nox’s hand, no matter how hard she tried, she looked at Nox fiercely with her eyes red.

Having been ridiculed by Nox, she felt terrible.

On the other hand, Nox was over the moon to see Monica flustered and exasperated. He let go of the crutches and gave them a slight push.

Monica was still holding on to her crutches tightly when Nox suddenly let go. On top of the fact that she was standing on one leg, she lost her balance and fell backward.

As Finn watched her fall, his hand seemed to move instinctively. However, the movement was so small that it was not obvious.

Monica fell to the ground with a bang, and her eyes watered from the fall.

‘Damn it. Nox, that son of a b*tch!’ Monica cursed in her heart. At that moment, she was in so much pain that tears streamed down her face.

Yet, the culprit, Nox, as well as Finn, who was standing still beside her, looked at her pathetic state with indifference.

Monica’s gaze landed on Finn, whom she hoped would come over and help her up.

However, Finn turned around indifferently and left. He said, “Nox, I’m leaving.”

“Hey, why are you leaving? The one who should be leaving is Monica,” Nox said from behind him.

“As long as we don’t see each other, it’s the same no matter who leaves,” Finn said coldly. After that, he left without turning back.

Nox chased after him before coming back in a huff, while Monica gritted her teeth and got up from the ground.

The fall hurt so bad that she felt she had suffered a concussion, and there should also be a big bump on the back of her head.

She bared her teeth and glared at Nox furiously.

After the heated argument, the atmosphere in the living room was tense.

After a long time, the sound of footsteps finally came from the stairs in the hall, signaling that Edward and Jeanne were coming down.

To be honest, Jeanne could feel herself trembling as she walked.

She did not know that men could have sex anywhere at any time... and for a long time too.

When she saw Nox’s resentful gaze, she felt bad for him.

As Edward and Jeanne walked over hand in hand, they saw Monica in a bad mood.

“I told Monica to come over.” Jeanne could immediately sense the emotions of the people around her and hurriedly explained herself.

Edward did not say anything.

On the contrary, Nox looked unhappy. “Next time when you invite her, don’t invite me. She disgusts me.”

Jeanne was speechless at how childish Nox could be.

“By the way, why did you ask me to come?” Nox asked. At that moment, he could not help but flash them an evil smile. “I hope it’s not for me to witness how long you guys take!”

Jeanne’s face immediately turned red.

Edward glanced at Nox, who pretended not to see him.

Jeanne said seriously, “I’m looking for you for work matters.”
