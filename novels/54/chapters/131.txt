Chapter 132: I Can Do Anything Ms. Lawrence Asks For

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne had actually expected this.

Forrest said, “I’m still getting the person-in-charge of the external liaison department to communicate with a few big news media directors to see if they can be persuaded.”

“There’s no need. Don’t disturb others at this time.”

Forrest looked at Jeanne in surprise.

Jeanne moved on to the next question. “Mandy, how are the arrangements on your side?”

“It’s already 80% settled. I’m still talking to a team of internet trolls. I’m afraid that they won’t be reliable. If the government suppresses it, I still have a backup plan,” Mandy reported. “It can be settled tonight.”

“Okay.”Jeanne nodded. “What about Hans?”

“It’s done,” Hans said. “I’ll send you the list in a while.”

“There’s no need. Keep the list yourself. You’ll be in charge of the arrangements for these people tomorrow.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne understood all the processes before she concluded, “The arrangement I just made for everyone is to make the city council’s matter against us a big issue. Now, I’ll arrange a specific task for everyone tomorrow.”

Everyone was very serious. They did not become dispirited just because it was past 2 am.

“Hans, tomorrow, you will bring the 100 people from the Lawrence Enterprise to protest outside the government with some banners. The content of the protest is basically to make the government give the Lawrence Enterprise an explanation. If the Lawrence Enterprise goes bankrupt, how will the government settle the nearly 10,000 employees of the company?”

“Yes.” Hans immediately understood.

Director Lawrence was protesting the government’s actions from the standpoint of the employees, which was also the position of the people. She was not planning to make it a direct confrontation from the Lawrence Enterprise.

Such a method was undoubtedly the best.

“Mandy, continue to talk to the internet trolls. I don’t need to know the details of the process. I only need to know that once the news is published, someone will comment on it, retweet it, and in the end, it will be able to make it onto the hot searches.”

“Yes.” Mandy nodded.

“Team Leader Jackson, you don’t need to follow the media anymore. This is an era where the internet is very developed. The news media is only a place where you can publish news, but it is not the only place. After the meeting, you can come to my office alone. I will tell you how to do it.”

“Okay.” Forrest nodded.

“After you finish the work that I have arranged, you can rest first. I am afraid that there will be a sudden incident, so I suggest that everyone use the bed to sleep. Don’t go back for the time being.”

“Yes.”

“Meeting adjourned.”

Jeanne stood up.

Forrest hurriedly followed Jeanne into her office.

“Director Lawrence.” Forrest followed Jeanne and sat down.

“I have already written out the draft for most of tomorrow’s press release. Now that we can not find any news media to release it, we can only choose a public platform like Reddit. However, there is one fatal point of such a platform. Our posts can easily be removed.”Jeanne was straightforward.

“That’s right. Currently, the government is very strict in monitoring the internet. Once words that violate the rules are involved, they will be immediately deleted. It’s possible that our words will disappear in the next second before anyone views it.”

“That’s why we need professional technical personnel.”

“Director Lawrence, do you mean that you want me to look for... hackers?” Forrest asked.

“There’s no need for you to look for one. I already have someone.” Jeanne smiled.

Forrest was surprised.

Jeanne did not say who it was.

After all, the fact that her son was a genius was well known in South Hampton City. However, it was only a legend. No one knew how much of a genius George was.

She said, “Now I just need you to tell me which are the most popular public platforms in South Hampton City, and which one has the largest number of viewers.”

“I think I know. To be more accurate, I’ll look at the data report online and report back to you.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded. She looked at the time and said, “I’m going to get off work now.”

“I’ll handle the rest.”

“Thank you for your hard work.”

“I’m ready to die,” Forrest said.

Jeanne smiled.

“Rest after you’re done. It won’t be easy tomorrow.”

“Yes.”

After Jeanne finished explaining everything, she left her office.

Actually, she did not have to go back.

There was a very comfortable bed in the office for her to sleep on. However, because she needed George to do something tomorrow, she had to go back.

She walked out of the Lawrence Enterprise’s building.

At that time, it was already past three in the morning.

She really did not expect that Fourth Master Swan would be waiting for her downstairs.

She thought that the message at midnight was the last time that Fourth Master Swan would be concerned about her today.

To be honest, it was a lie to say that she was not touched at that moment.

She looked at the back seat with a dull expression. The car window rolled down and revealed a beautiful statue of a man. When she saw that he had discovered her existence, her beautiful eyes moved slightly.

He said, “Ms. Lawrence, are you off work?”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

His casual tone caused ripples in her heart.

She looked straight at him and did not react.

At that moment, she saw him open the car door, got out of the car, and walked toward her.

When he reached her, he held her hand naturally.

His palm was very warm.

At this moment, it made her feel an indescribable emotion.

Her heart would beat along with it.

Edward held Jeanne’s hand and sat in the car.

The car slowly drove on the quiet streets of South Hampton city in the early morning.

In the quiet car, Jeanne spoke after a long while, “If the Fourth Master is looking for me, you can give me a call. I might not be able to see it in time through the Whatsapp messages.”

She was explaining why she did not reply to his message.

“It’s fine.” Edward was indifferent.

‘Fine, wait for me until three in the morning then.’ Jeanne thought

‘Are you really sick in the head?’

“I just miss you.” Fourth Master Swan’s deep voice was so direct.

Jeanne blinked.

One sentence from Fourth Master Swan could instantly kill the conversation.

“Have you eaten?” Fourth Master Swan changed the topic.

“I really have.” Jeanne knew that she had to work overtime tonight, so she asked Amy to order dinner on time.

“I’ll send you back.”

“Fourth Master, there’s no need to wait for me until so late.” Jeanne could not help but say, “I don’t want to waste your precious time.”

“With Ms. Lawrence, time is never wasted.”

“...” Stop teasing.

She would never be tempted.

“Besides, Ms. Lawrence’s incident this time is partly also because of me. Since I can’t help Ms. Lawrence too much, I’ll do what I can. I’ll feel more at ease this way.”

Jeanne looked at the Fourth Master Swan.

So this guy knew very well that she was being targeted because of Melody Sanders.

His words meant that he would not interfere with this matter.

Jeanne was doubtful.

Edward saw her doubt and said, “It’s not convenient for the Swans to have a direct conflict with the Sanders since It might cause an internal turmoil. I believe that Ms. Lawrence will be able to understand.”

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “I understand.”

Just that she could not understand.

The feeling she had for him just now had completely disappeared.

She felt that Fourth Master Swan came tonight to tell her that he would not help her. He would let her solve it on her own and take care of herself.

“But if Ms. Lawrence asks...” Edward suddenly moved closer to her.

His body pressed against hers.

His face was very close to hers.

“I can do anything for Ms. Lawrence.”
