Chapter 212: Jeanne Accused Them on the Spot

The judge hesitated.

Most of the people present in the courtroom supported it.

Monica could not help but say loudly, “Please agree to Jeanne’s application and catch the culprit behind this!”

Originally, it was very bad behavior to make such a ruckus in the court.

At that moment, many people at the scene started to echo, “Please agree to it, judge!”

“Please agree to it!”

That was more or less what happened.

Many people at the scene were also shocked by the lawsuit today! They kept feeling that while Jeanne was cleared of her crime, something seemed to be missing as the real culprit had not been caught. They felt that there was still unfinished business.

Moreover, why did Adrian and Tenda want to frame Jeanne? This was the answer that everyone wanted to know.

At this moment, there was a sudden uproar.

Joshua was extremely nervous.

He could not help but look at Eden.

Joshua thought that this case was over. Of course, he could not deny that Adrian’s intentional accusation would definitely be retried. Nonetheless, at least it was going to be the next step. Joshua believed that Eden would not let him be implicated. Who knew, the trial was retried without any warning at this time.

He was almost scared to death. He asked, “Eden, what should we do? What should we do?!”

“Calm down!” Eden’s expression was extremely ugly at this moment.

He was afraid that Joshua would be exposed when the time came. Based on his understanding of Joshua, he knew Joshua would definitely expose him without hesitation. Although whatever Joshua might say might not be correct, Eden’s reputation would be affected for sure. It would also bring him a lot of trouble.

Eden gritted his teeth.

At this moment, he heard Jeanne say again, “Your Honor, why would Adrian Zimmer frame me? Shouldn’t it be an important fact that the court needs to determine for the accusation against me?!”

The judge hesitated for a moment before he said, “I’ll discuss it with the trial bench. The court will adjourn for ten minutes.”

Next, he left with the trial bench seriously.

There were some movements at the scene again.

Melody looked at Jeanne. She wanted to find someone to kill Jeanne directly.

Once Jeanne was killed, Melody would never see her show off like this again.

Melody got up and left the audience seats.

How could she let this case be retried immediately?

She was also afraid that she would be implicated.

Melody walked to an empty corner outside the court and prepared to make a call.

“Ms. Sanders.” A familiar male voice suddenly came from behind.

Melody was even shocked at that moment.

She turned around abruptly and looked fiercely at the man behind her. Nox was smiling casually at her.

“I thought I was mistaken just now. I didn’t expect that it was really you who came to watch Jeanne’s case, Ms. Sanders. You’re really down to earth to be spectating a civil lawsuit. If the media found out, they would probably praise you again!”

“Nox, don’t act all strange here!” Melody’s face darkened. “Don’t think that you can be so disrespectful in front of me just because you’re on Edward’s side. You’d better know your place. You’re just a dog he’s raising!”

Nox’s face darkened.

He sneered. “I’m very honored to be Fourth Master Swan’s dog. At least, I’m better than a noble person who’s not even as good as a dog!”

“Nox, believe it or not, I can ruin your reputation if you insult me like this.”

“Am I insulting you, Ms. Sanders? I just said it casually. If you feel that you’ve been insulted...” Nox smiled mischievously, so at that moment, he looked particularly frivolous and disrespectful. He enunciated each word carefully, “Consider it an insult then!”

“Nox!”

“Ms. Sanders, don’t be angry. As the third princess of the Sanders in Harken, your words and actions are being watched by the public. Perhaps someone is watching around you now. Ms. Sanders, don’t embarrass the Sanders.” As Nox said this, he deliberately looked sideways as if to remind her that someone was watching

Melody was so scared at that moment that her face turned pale.

It was worth noting that given the status of the Sanders, they were not allowed to lose their composure in front of outsiders. This was a big taboo for the Sanders. The consequences were very serious.

Melody suddenly looked in Nox’s direction.

However, there was no one there.

Melody knew she had been played. “Nox! Don’t challenge my limits.”

“I’m just kindly reminding you, Ms. Sanders.” Nox smiled. “Oh right, you’re leaving, right?!”

Melody’s eyes narrowed.

Of course not.

“Fourth Master Swan said that although you have nothing to do with him, you’re the princess of the Sanders, after all. Naturally, you’re also the princess of all the citizens of Harken. Since you’re leaving now, as a subject, it is his duty to send you away. That said, it is inconvenient for him now. You saw that his wife is currently in court, so he asked me to send you back instead. Ms. Sanders, this way please.” Nox suddenly appeared very polite.

‘Wife?!’

Melody’s expression was obviously ugly.

Nox seemed to have thought of something and said, “Oh, Fourth Master Swan also said that as a princess of the country, you mustn’t do things that a princess shouldn’t do, such as interfering with justice or something. There are many people around watching you, Ms. Sanders. Please think before you act!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Melody gritted her teeth!

It turned out that Nox followed her out to monitor whether she would do something!

Melody originally wanted to send Nox away, but it was impossible for her to succeed.

She suppressed her emotions.

Did Edward know all her words, actions, and thoughts clearly?!

“Ms. Sanders, it’s best if you don’t doubt Fourth Master Swan’s ability.” Nox smiled as if he could see through Melody’s thoughts.

Melody glared at Nox.

She knew very well that Nox would definitely pester her. She did not have the chance to use her personal power to do something in secret.

On this day, in order to not attract too much attention, her bodyguards were waiting outside the court.

Even if they were there, it would be impossible for them to have a conflict with Nox.

A person like Nox would do anything.

If they had a conflict, they would catch the attention of everyone else.

Nox waited quietly for a while before saying, “If you’ve thought it through, please come this way. I’ll definitely escort you out safely, Ms. Sanders!”

Why did she have to leave

Why did she have to leave like this?

She wanted to see just how powerful Jeanne could be!

Melody suddenly turned around and walked straight to the court, returning to the audience seats.

Nox smiled.

Fourth Master Swan was indeed able to predict everything. He knew what Melody was going to do in an instant! Nox did not even know what Fourth Master Swan was paying attention to. Fourth Master had clearly been looking at Jeanne, but he noticed the moment Melody stood up and left. What was more, they were sitting in front of Melody. Nox suspected that Fourth Master Swan had a third eye that was covered by the hair on the back of his head.

Nox also returned to the audience seats.

Monica saw that Nox had returned and could not help but complain, “Why did you run out at such an exciting time?”

“Can’t I go to the toilet?”

“Lazy people sh*t and pee a lot.”

“...”

Edward’s eyes shifted slightly. “How was it?”

“It has been settled,” Nox said in a low voice.

Edward nodded slightly.

At this moment, the judges and the trial bench appeared once again. “In view of the importance of these two cases and their deep implications, the court will accept Jeanne’s application to conduct a trial on Adrian Zimmer, Tenda Wadler, and Lunetta Walker for the crime of false accusation. We will also conduct a retrial of using a dual contract for personal gain from the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse.”
