Shelly held it in and did not say anything else while James gave Lizzy a look.

Those two people had been bribed by someone. They did not know who bribed them, but the other party said that as long as they could help Sarah and Finn get together, they would get 100 thousand dollars, with 50 thousand dollars each. The other party even paid each of them 10 thousand dollars in advance.

The two of them came from neither wealthy nor poor families, but they were both vain people.

Sarah came from a rich family and did not lack money, so her clothes were all branded.

On the other hand, Shelly’s family did not have money, so her clothes were very plain. However, everyone knew that Shelly was the child bride of the Winters. Sooner or later, she would marry into the Winter family, and Shelly’s academic results were especially good.

Just the two of them were neither too rich nor too poor, so under the temptation of money, they fell for it.

Moreover, Sarah liked Finn, to begin with. If they managed to bring Sarah and Finn together, they would still be doing a good deed.

Lizzy felt James’s gaze and stopped arguing. She said angrily, “I’m going to the bathroom.”

“I’m going too.” James quickly followed.

The two of them walked into the washroom in the private room, leaving Shelly alone in the room.

She thought about it before picking up the phone and dialing a number.

However, Nox did not pick up, which Shelly had expected. Hence, she was not disappointed.

Instead, she thought about it again and dialed another number.

The call went through. “Hello.”

“Hello, aunty. I’m Shelly, Sarah’s classmate.”

“Shelly, I’ve heard about you from Sarah. Why are you calling me so late at night? Did something happen to Sarah?” Ruby was instantly flustered. Sarah said she wanted to go back to her house tonight, but she had not asked if Sarah had gone home yet.

“No, aunty. Don’t worry. I just wanted to ask if you have Monica’s number. I have something I need to ask her.”

“You’re looking for Monica?” Ruby was even more surprised.

“Yes, I have something to ask her. Can you give me her number?” Shelly asked.

She had Ruby’s number because she had called Sarah once, but Sarah did not pick up. After that, Sarah said that if Shelly could not find her, she could call her aunt. Sarah even said that her aunt was the kindest person to her in the world.

Shelly was actually very envious of Sarah, who was loved by so many people.

“Write it down.” Ruby did not think too much about it.

She had always been very open-minded and felt that the elders should not interfere too much in the affairs of young people. With that, she gave Shelly Monica’s number.

Shelly quickly wrote it down and quickly called Monica, who was still in the Cardellini family’s villa.

She had moved from the floor to the bed and continued to look at the ceiling, with tears streaming down her face. She thought that she might cry herself to death one day.

She looked at the caller ID, saw the unfamiliar number, and picked it up. “Hello?”

“Hello, Monica. I’m Sarah’s classmate. My name is Shelly.” Shelly quickly introduced herself.

“Oh.” Monica was not interested.

“I’m calling you to tell you something. Sarah was drunk today, and a few boys at the bar stopped her, not allowing her to leave...”

Monica frowned. “Where is she?”

At that moment, she had already gotten out of bed and was planning to come over to save Sarah.

“Monica, calm down. We’re fine now. Finn came over to take Sarah away.”

Monica’s expression sank, and her heart ached.

It was not the fact that Finn and Sarah being together made her feel upset, but just hearing that name made her heart ache.

“However, when Finn took Sarah away, a boy insisted that Finn drink, and we just found out that the alcohol was drugged. Perhaps it was to take revenge on Finn for taking Sarah away. Sarah called us just now and told us that Finn was unconscious in the hotel. I was worried something might happen to Finn, and that’s why I called you.” Shelly put the matter in a roundabout way.

She tried her best to preserve her friend’s dignity and hid the fact that Finn was drugged because of Sarah.

Monica got agitated. “Which hotel are they in?”

“Imperial Luxury.”

After that, the other party hung up abruptly.

Shelly took a deep breath and put down the phone, wondering if that was the right thing to do!

However, she knew Sarah’s method was wrong. Hence, Sarah should be stopped before she made a big mistake!

At that moment, Lizzy and James, who went to the washroom, came out.

They had just informed the other party that Sarah had failed and that they did not know what to do now!

The other party quickly thought of a solution for them, and after a few more instructions, they walked out of the private room. Lizzy’s tone was much better now as she said to Shelly, “I’m sorry. I was too impulsive just now.”

Shelly was not a fussy person. She was just a little surprised at Lizzy’s attitude toward the matter, but on second thought, Lizzy was probably worried for Sarah. On top of that, Lizzy was the one who helped Sarah to plan the matter, so it was inevitable that she would be a little unhappy that it failed.

“Let’s hurry over to see Sarah now,” Lizzy said worriedly.

“Okay.” Shelly nodded.

The three of them took a taxi to the five-star Imperial Luxury Hotel. Lizzy had been calling Sarah, telling her to wait for them in the lobby. Then, they would think of a way together.

When they were in the lobby, they saw Sarah with her makeup ruined from the crying, waiting for them anxiously.

“Sarah, get the front desk clerk to get you a room keycard,” Lizzy said immediately.

Sarah was stunned. How could she have forgotten to seek the front desk clerk for assistance?!

Shelly turned to look at Lizzy.

Who could have thought that she would be able to think of that in such a short time? Moreover, why did she have to come and tell Sarah that in person? She could have said it over the phone.

In the midst of their astonishment, they suddenly saw a hurried figure running past them and then back again. “Sarah, where’s Finn?”
