“He’s going to talk to your attending physician about your treatment. He’ll be here soon.”

“Alright.” Sarah smiled brightly.

Monica did not want to peel the apple anymore.

She threw the pitted apple into the trash can and stood up from the sofa. “Sarah, I don’t have anything else to do, so I’ll head off now.”

“Where are you going? You don’t even go to work, and all you know is how to play. Now that your younger cousin is injured, can’t you spend more time with her?” Gary was a little angry.

“There are so many of you. Can’t any of you take care of Sarah? Besides, Sarah might not even want me to accompany her. We’ve been at each other’s throats since we were young. Don’t you know that?” Monica said matter-of-factly.

“You child–”

“Uncle, Monica has something to do. Let her go. Having you guys are enough” Sarah quickly said, “Let’s not disturb her plans.”

Monica hated Sarah the most. Ever since she was young, that chick had always acted like an innocent bunny in front of her parents.

Every time, it made her gnash her teeth in anger.

“Look, your sister is more sensible than you.”

“Yes, yes, yes. She’s the most sensible.” It was rare for Monica to retort. “In that case, I’ll be leaving now.”

“When are you coming back to work?” Gary asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Tomorrow. Is that okay?” Monica was a little speechless.

“Mm,” Gary answered, which meant that he agreed.

Monica opened the door of the ward and left after getting her father’s consent.

She actually knew that Finn was not such a kind-hearted person. If Sarah got into a car accident, he would at most help her father inquire about Sarah’s surgery. How could he be so kind-hearted to care about her follow-up treatment?

That was unless Sarah’s car accident was related to him.

She thought it out calmly, and her footsteps suddenly halted because she saw Finn coming toward her.

He was probably going to Sarah’s ward.

Of course, Finn saw her too.

The two of them looked at each other for a second before Finn walked past her.

“Did Sarah get into a car accident because of you?” Monica asked him from behind.

Finn did not answer.

However, Monica also felt that she was asking for trouble. She knew better than anyone how annoyed Finn was at her right now.

It was better for her to disappear.

…

In the ward.

Finn politely knocked on the door and went in.

Sarah’s eyes lit up when she saw Finn.

Finn said, “I’ve asked the doctor, and Sarah’s condition isn’t serious. She has to stay in the hospital for observation and treatment for about ten days. Then, she can be discharged.”

“That’s good,” Ron Harrison, Sarah’s father, quickly said. “Thank you, Finn. Thank you for your trouble.”

Finn was about to say something when he paused and turned to look at Sarah.

Sarah looked at him the same way, and shen she saw that he was looking at her, her heart raced.

She quickly explained as if she had done something wrong. “I didn’t see the red light, and that was why I ran it. I really didn’t notice it. I didn’t mean to get into an accident.”

Finn pursed his lips.

The other four elders in the room were also surprised by Sarah’s sudden explanation.

They were all experienced people and had been in society for many years. Hence, they could instantly sense that something was... unusual between the two of them.

“I really didn’t do this to make you worry about me. I swear, I really didn’t!” Sarah tried her best to explain herself.

Yvonne could not hold it in any longer. “Sarah, did something happen between you and Finn?”

Sarah bit her lip and kept her eyes on Finn without saying a word.

It made everything even more unbelievable.

“Finn?” Gary called out to Finn as he could not hold it in anymore.

Finn said, “Sarah confessed to me today, but I refused.”

“...”

The room was completely silent.

Sarah had said she liked Finn before, but everyone thought she was just saying it.

However, who would have thought that it would be true?

Yvonne could not accept it. “Sarah, what were you thinking? Finn is your brother-in-law. How can you like him? You’re just a kid. What do you know about liking him?”

“He’s my ex-brother-in-law,” Sarah said righteously. “And I’m not young anymore. I’m already a grown-up. I’m 18 years old. I know what it means to like someone, and I only like Finn now.”

“You say that you–”

“Anyway, I like him.” Sarah suddenly started bawling her eyes out.
