964 Jeanne and Monica Reunited and Joined Hands to Destroy the Sc*mbag

In South Hampton City, it was already morning when Jeanne returned to the city.

First, she and Mason checked into a hotel and slept. When they woke up, it was already in the afternoon.

As such, Jeanne sent Mason a message and left the hotel.

Mason, on the other hand, looked at Jeanne’s message and took his time to call Kingsley.

“Mr. Thorn,” he said in a respectful tone.

“Yes.” Kingsley seemed to have just woken up as his voice was still a little groggy.

Lucy was also still in Kingsley’s bed.

When Kingsley had nothing to do, he was actually a very lazy and laid-back person. Sometimes, he could even lie in bed for an entire day.

If it were not for Mason’s call, he did not know how long he would have slept.

“I’ve returned to South Hampton City with Jeanne,” Mason said bluntly.

Kingsley’s expression changed. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lucy, who was beside him, could see how angry Kingsley was.

“I will do my best to keep her safe.”

“When are you coming back?!”

“Jeanne said a week.”

“If anything happens to her, you know the consequences,” Kingsley said coldly.

“Yes,” Mason said respectfully.

Immediately after that, Kingsley hung up.

His expression was extremely ugly.

Lucy did not dare to speak, so she just lay beside him and pretended to be asleep. She even felt that if she made a sound at this moment, she would anger Kingsley.

The consequences of angering that man were hard to imagine.

However, at that moment, someone suddenly opened the door.

Without knocking, the person pushed the door open and entered. “Mr. Thorn–”

It was Millie who came in. She was all smiles and wanted to please him.

“Get lost!” Kingsley roared.

Frightened, Mille quickly said, “Yes!”

She immediately closed the door.

Lucy even smiled at that moment.

It did not take a genius to know that Millie must be fuming right now. Moreover, she must think that Kingsley was angry because he did not want her to disturb him. She would never know that he was angry because Jeanne had left the Delta Islands.

Now that Millie’s anger was triggered, it would make her do something that was out of line.

The smile on Lucy’s face was very obvious, but it froze in the next moment because Kingsley had caught that hint of pleasure on her face.

She looked into Kingsley’s eyes and could feel his hostility.

Just like that, her smile slowly faded away.

At that moment, he was also thinking about how to explain her smile just now.

She could not possibly let him misunderstand that she was gloating over Jeanne’s departure.

“You knew that Jeanne was leaving?” Kingsley asked her.

“I didn’t know,” Lucy lied.

Some white lies were told to keep oneself alive, and to Lucy, it was well-intentioned.

Kingsley furrowed his brows, clearly not believing her.

Lucy asked, “Did Mason leave with Jeanne?”

She was reminding him that Mason was the accomplice, and Kingsley would never do anything to Mason.

Among the assassins, there would always be someone Kingsley especially liked.

Just like a company or a country, there would always be a talent that the leader liked, so even if they did something wrong, they would not be punished too badly.

At that moment, she did not need to suffer with them out of loyalty.

That was the survival rule of an assassin.

Kingsley glanced at Lucy and ordered coldly, “Help me light a cigarette.”

“Alright.” Lucy quickly sat up on the bed.

In her heart, she heaved a sigh of relief that she had managed to get away with it.

She picked up a pack of cigarettes by the bedside, took one out, and put it to her mouth. Then, she lit it with a lighter before putting it in Kingsley’s mouth.

Kingsley took a puff and looked at Lucy’s clothes indifferently.

She seemed to like the color bright red because she was wearing a red silk bathrobe. As she had just woken up, the bathrobe was loose on her body. It looked even more indecent with her snow-white shoulders exposed and the bathroom looking like it was about to slide off.

His gaze was now on her collarbone, which had been burned by the cigarette butt. At that moment, there was a thin layer of calluses on it, and it seemed a little out of place on her fair body.

Lucy seemed to have noticed Kingsley’s gaze.

To be honest, she was really afraid that Kingsley would do something to her small wound.

She did not have any masochistic tendencies, so she fixed up her sleeping robe quietly, lifted the quilt, and got up.
