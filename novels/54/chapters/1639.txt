Chapter 1640: Nox’s Indifference, Shelly Was Attacked Again

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly wavered because she did not want Zoe to pester her again. She wanted to stay as far away from Zoe and Nox as she could.

If that was the case… ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She thought for a moment before saying, “I’ll call Nox, but the outcome has nothing to do with me. And after the call, don’t come looking for me or get me to pay you back!”

“Alright.” Zoe agreed immediately.

Shelly gritted her teeth and did not hesitate to call Nox. The call went through, but the other party did not pick up.

Just when Shelly thought that Nox would not answer her call, the call suddenly went through, and she heard Nox’s sarcastic voice. “What’s wrong? Didn’t you tell me never to come looking for you again? Why are you looking for me now? Can’t survive alone anymore? Do you need my help?”

Shelly hated Nox so much that the moment she heard Nox’s voice, she had the urge to smash her phone into pieces.

At that moment, Nox was sitting in his office. He had all the evidence of Zoe’s crimes prepared, which could send Zoe to prison at any time. Once the case that Zoe had drugged him was established in court, Shelly would be able to clear her name.

In fact, he had been waiting for Shelly’s call. As long as she showed her weakness, he would immediately make her life better.

As expected, Shelly could not hold on for long anymore. He even thought that Shelly would not come to him so soon, so he did not expect her call.

He had to admit that the moment he saw Shelly’s phone call, his heart was beating faster and he was a little nervous. It was that strange emotion that made him take a long time to answer Shelly’s call. On one hand, it was to adjust his emotions, and on the other hand, it was to show that he did not care about Shelly.

“Zoe is pregnant.” Shelly enunciated each word.

She ignored everything that Nox just said and was only calling Nox to tell him that Zoe was pregnant.

“What?” Nox’s tone changed.

He probably thought that he had heard wrongly.

“I said, Zoe is pregnant with your child!” Shelly repeated, “She’s in the hospital now. Come over and take a look.”

“If Zoe is pregnant, why are you calling me? Shelly, would you be so kind as to inform me?” Nox mocked, “If you want to see me, just say it. There’s no need for you to come up with so many excuses.”

“It’s up to you whether you believe it or not. I’m just informing you. It doesn’t matter if you want to come or not.” Shelly did not want to waste her breath on Nox.

With that, she hung up the phone. Then, she sent a message to Nox, giving him Zoe’s location and ward number.

After that, Shelly looked at Zoe and said, “This is the most I can do for you. As for whether Nox will come or not, or whether he’ll accept the child, that’s your problem. No matter what you say, I won’t be threatened by you again.”

Zoe still had something to say. However, Shelly turned around and said to Benjamin, “Let’s go.”

Benjamin nodded and left with Shelly, leaving Zoe alone in the ward.

Zoe, too, knew that she could not threaten Shelly, who was much tougher than she thought. She had always thought that a woman without status or money would be easy to bully!

She gritted her teeth. At that moment, she could only hope that Nox would come to see her. No matter what, she had to grab onto that last straw of hope.

While Zoe was thinking about it, she suddenly saw Nox. He had gotten here so fast that it caught her by surprise.

As a matter of fact, she was prepared for Nox not to come today. Considering how cold Nox had been to her recently, she did not dare to have too much hope of him coming to see her.

The moment Zoe saw Nox, her eyes reddened and tears kept falling. She looked extremely aggrieved and pitiful.

However, the first thing Nox said was, “Where’s Shelly?” Zoe was stunned for a second, and she looked straight at Nox.

“Where’s Shelly?” Nox asked coldly.

“She has left.” Zoe replied, “She left after calling you. I was left alone.”

Nox gritted his teeth. He could not believe that Shelly had called him but did not even wait for him!

“Nox, I thought you weren’t going to come. I didn’t expect…” Zoe looked at Nox carefully and said, “I thought I would never see you again..”
