Chapter 229: Embarrass Jenifer

Joshua did not dare to answer his grandpa.

“Joshua, you’d better know your place! Do you know that what you’re doing right now is very likely to bankrupt the Lawrences?! When that happens, even if I want to pass the Lawrence Enterprise down to you, it would’ve already become someone else’s property!” Jonathan was very strict.

Joshua was also frightened by Jonathan’s words. He quickly replied, “It was indeed Eden who helped me.”

Alexander and Jenifer’s faces turned red.

Jonathan was not any better.

“That said, I feel that he’s still on my side. It’s also because I have a grudge with Jeanne that he helped me. It’s not like what Jeanne said. He didn’t do it to please the Sanders—”

“Enough!” Jonathan did not want to listen anymore.

Everyone in the business world was smart.

In fact, just a few clues would be enough for one to tell that something was amiss. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Jonathan said, “Alexander, stay here. The rest of you, get lost!”

Joshua got up from the ground and had no choice but to leave the study with his mother.

Jonathan looked at Alexander and said fiercely, “Is that the good son-in-law you’ve chosen?!”

“I didn’t know that Eden was such a person. Eden even gave us 300 million dollars in the MUK contract. I didn’t expect him to be like this!” Alexander was also a little mad. “What should we do now? Jasmine has become a Swan!”

“At the end of the day, it’s because Jasmine is incompetent! If she’s capable, Eden wouldn’t deal with the Lawrences like this!”

Alexander was rendered speechless.

“Observe the Swans’ every move first. Jeanne’s reminder today was right. Once we know that the Swans have the intention to do something to us, we’ll be on our guard,” Jonathan instructed.

“Okay.”

“Leave first. I need to think about this again.”

The moment Alexander turned around and left, he could not help but say, “Dad, I feel that you’re pampering Jeanne too much.”

Jonathan’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“If you pamper her like this, it’ll only make her even more arrogant in the family!” Alexander was very agitated. “She has only returned for more than a month, and yet you’ve given her 10% of the shares. If this goes on, in less than half a year, she’ll be able to take over the Lawrence Enterprise as her own!”

“Do you think I want that? ! If I hadn’t done that, do you think Jeanne would let Joshua go?!”

“Even so, she can’t just do whatever she says! Do you know what Jeanne looks like to me?!” Alexander said fiercely, “She’s extremely similar to her mother. Back then, just because she was given a little power, everything in the Lawrence Enterprise was in her hands! If it weren’t for us...”

Alexander endured and did not say it out loud.

Jonathan also gave Alexander a look to make him shut up.

“Anyway, I feel that Jeanne will be very out of control in the future!”

“Not in the future; she’s already out of control now,” Jonathan gave an affirmative answer.

Alexander’s expression became even uglier.

Jonathan said, “If you chase Jeanne away now, Jeanne will immediately stop the e-commerce contract with MUK. Not only will we lose a collaboration, but it’ll also cause the Lawrence Enterprise stock market to immediately fluctuate. Do you know the consequences?!”

Alexander gritted his teeth.

“Let Jeanne do this first. Once the Lawrence Enterprise is on the right track, if Jeanne still doesn’t know what’s good for her, she’ll end up like her mother!” Jonathan said cruelly.

“Alright.” Alexander agreed right away.

This time, he did not feel the slightest bit of guilt.

“Let me remind you again—if Joshua continues like this, no matter how hard I try to help you, the Lawrence Enterprise will be finished in the end!”

“I’ll teach Joshua well.”

Jonathan nodded slightly.

Alexander left the study.

The moment he left the study, his expression was still very ugly.

He returned to his room.

Jenifer and Joshua were in the room. Jenifer was lecturing Joshua.

Alexander was annoyed when he saw Joshua, so he chased him out.

Jenifer quickly went forward to fawn over Alexander.

Alexander did not show any mercy. “As expected, children take after their mother! Joshua and Jasmine have inherited your uselessness!”

Jenifer was stunned at once.

Alexander had never insulted her so directly.

He had always said that she was considerate and sensible.

“If Joshua and Jasmine were half as good as Jeanne, I wouldn’t have been embarrassed to this extent!” Alexander said fiercely, “They all have the same father, yet the gap between them is so big! If it weren’t for the fact that Joshua is my only son, I would’ve kicked you out of the house long ago.”
