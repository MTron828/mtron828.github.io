Chapter 1590: Forever

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly really did not expect to see Benjamin after so many years.

At that time, she had fought with Benjamin, and their parents were called to the school. Benjamin was even taught a lesson by Nox… In the end, he became Nox’s tool to make her leave. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In fact, there was a time when she really wanted to fulfill Nox’s wish and be with another man. After all, being with Nox was too tiring.

Nox did not love her, and he even used all sorts of methods to torture her. Therefore, for a few days, she really developed feelings for Benjamin, even though it was not deep.

As she knew that Nox was the one who instigated her, she had her own sense of proportion regarding when it came to Benjamin’s affection toward her.

Still, she had a good impression of Benjamin. It was because Benjamin treated her really well, especially when compared to Nox. In fact, Shelly felt that Benjamin was perfect.

He would bring her breakfast every day. Even if she did not eat it, he would stuff it under her desk. He would also pay attention to her physical condition. Sometimes, even if she coughed, he would take off his jacket for her.

Moreover, he would send her back. Even if she did not allow him to send her home, he would follow behind her and make sure she got home safely. He would only leave when she was home.

Just like that, Shelly started to feel something in her heart. Every time she went back, she would face Nox’s criticism and, in school, Benjamin’s endless flattery. In front of a woman who had never been doted on by a man, it was easy for her to be moved.

Hence, one day, when Benjamin sent her downstairs and was about to leave… Shelly stopped him.

She asked, “Do you like me?”

In fact, she knew he did not like her and that he was forced by Nox. He was even receiving a sum of money from Nox. If she were in his shoes, she would have done the same.

“I do,” Benjamin blurted out.

Shelly smiled. In that case, she would just take it as he liked her, which was a bad thing. It was better than being hated.

Her smile made Benjamin a lot bolder. He walked up to Shelly and looked at her nervously.

He said, “I know about your relationship with Nox, but Nox really doesn’t like you, so…”

‘So what?’

“I can’t promise you anything now because I don’t have anything that Nox has and my family background is average. But I swear, when I grow up, I will definitely work hard and let you live a carefree life,” Benjamin said affectionately.

Shelly looked straight at Benjamin, infected by his deep affection. She was actually wondering if she could change her life.

Life with Nox was too tiring. Besides, she had never liked Nox. Otherwise, she would not have fallen in love with another man so quickly.

As the two of them looked at each other affectionately, Benjamin gathered his courage and held Shelly’s hand. Shelly was still a little nervous, and her heart was beating very fast.

Then, Benjamin suddenly approached Shelly and kissed her on the lips. It was just a kiss, but he was so frightened that he ran away after the kiss.

Shelly looked at Benjamin’s back and thought, ‘Can I really leave Nox and live my own life?’

Of course, she did not really want to be with Benjamin. When Benjamin was deliberately pursuing her, she was also using him to tell herself that leaving Nox was not that difficult. However, in the next second, she had been given a great deal of trouble by Nox.

When she returned home, the house was filled with the smell of alcohol, and Nox was sitting on the sofa in the living room, looking at her coldly.

Shelly was used to Nox’s bad temper, so she did not think much of it. She did what he had to do and ignored Nox.

“Why? Are you starting to feel that the outside world is very fun?” Nox mocked.

Shelly thought to herself, ‘That’s right. Thanks to you, I finally know that other than you, all other men are good.’

“Come and help me back to my room!” Nox said coldly.

With that, Shelly put down her bag and went to help Nox.

At that time, Nox had almost recovered. In fact, he would be fine even if she did not help him. However, Nox was used to ordering her around.

She took him to his room, helped him prepare a bath, and wiped his body down. Anyway, she had done everything that the servants did for him and things that were beyond what the servants had done..
