944 Monica Stirring Up Trouble

On one hand, it was to take revenge on Monica, and on the other, it was to help the Sanders suppress the Cardellinis.

Previously, because he still had some concerns about Monica, he did not make a move for a long time. There were a few times when he was interrogated by the Sanders, but he tried his best to find an excuse. However, there was no need for that now.

Now, not only did he not need an excuse not to make a move on them, but he would make it many times worse for them.

If all went well, he would destroy Cardellini Enterprise in three months.

Then, the Sunny Pharmaceutical that he was currently in charge of would instantly replace the Cardellini Enterprise. Once Cardellini Enterprise collapsed, all the scientific research and technical personnel that the Cardellini Enterprise had trained would all become his. Once all the talents were under him, he would immediately monopolize the pharmaceutical market in Harken. Once he monopolized medical treatment, the Sanders would control at least half of the economy.

Moreover, if he completed that project, the Sanders would value him more.

Even if he did not have a good identity, he could still have a prominent position, and no one would dare to provoke him!

…

Monica tried her best to calm herself down.

She told herself that she could not let Michael pull her down. She could not!

She had to think of a way to get Cardellini Enterprise out of this crisis.

She gritted her teeth and let Steve into her office.

She said, “I’m confirmed. Michael is the one behind this.”

“Is there anything you can do about it?”

“There is nothing I can do.” Monica said, “Michael hates me to death now. It’s useless no matter what I do.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s really tricky.”

“But I refuse to believe that he can do anything he wants.”

“It’s not that he can do whatever he wants. He just knows the standard operation of the quality inspection department too well and how to mess with Cardellini Enterprise in a seemingly fair and just manner!”

“What is fairness and justice?” Monica asked Steve.

Steve was stunned. He was somewhat dumbfounded by Monica’s question.

“Why does Cardellini Enterprise’s accident requires special treatment when other medical malpractices can be dealt with according to the usual procedures?!” Monica admitted that she was being stubborn, but she could not understand. “Why can’t we get the same treatment?”

“I’m sure the quality inspection Hall will definitely have a standardized version of their story.”

“Since there is, let’s find their loopholes,” Monica said bluntly.

Steve frowned. “What do you have in mind?”

We haven’t given an official response to the public after the incident, have we?”

“There’s been too much to take into account during these critical times.”

“Alright, let’s do it today. The sooner, the better.”

“What do you want to do?”

“I want to force the quality inspection department to produce the results in the shortest time possible.”

“How?”

“Create public opinion so that they are forced to give a result report under pressure.”

Steve looked at Monica.

“Since Cardellini Enterprise is going down anyway, I’ll just allow things to worsen.”

Steve was speechless, but that was in line with Monica’s character.

“By the way, how are the family members of the deceased son?” Monica asked.

“How much better can they be? They even thought of killing your father.”

“Arrange for them to be at our press conference. I want to make it big.”

“Are you sure?” Steve asked.

Was she sure she wanted to follow through with such a risky operation?

If they were not careful, Cardellini Enterprise’s reputation would plummet.

“What’s there to be afraid of? I’m the one doing it anyway, and the public’s opinion of me isn’t good, to begin with.”

Steve was once again rendered speechless.

However, Monica was a woman of her word. With her rash personality, she really did hold a press conference that afternoon.

There were many reporters at the press conference.

It was the first time such a large-scale press conference was held because of medical malpractice, and it was unprecedented in the industry. All the media felt that there would be some sensational news, so they all came.

When Monica appeared at the press conference, she was shocked by the presence of more than a hundred media personnel.

Damn it. Were they trying to kill her?

She made her way to the middle, with Steve accompanying her while Tim stood behind them respectfully.

Monica’s appearance caused an uproar among the reporters.

Everyone thought it would be Gary, but they did not expect her to appear.

Without wasting any more time, Monica said into the microphone, “Regarding Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine incident, Cardellini Enterprise will give everyone a positive reply in a few days. Our drugs have always been known for their safety and affordability. Moreover, we’ve never had any medical malpractice in the past hundred years. However, because of this vaccine, the entire country has boycotted Cardellini Enterprise, and it has put us in a precarious situation. I’m here to tell everyone through the media that there are no problems with our drugs and that it’s a normal rejection reaction to the vaccine. In medicine, a certain percentage of accidents is guaranteed, and this is within the normal range. Of course, I believe that with the development of technology, that percentage will decrease in the future. However, with the current medical standards, this is something Cardellini Enterprise and even Harken can’t control. I hope everyone can look at it rationally and not destroy the Cardellini Enterprise’s hard work for the past hundred years just because of a few words taken out of context!”
