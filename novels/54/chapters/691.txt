Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She turned to look at Lizzy and James, trying to get them to help persuade Sarah.

However, the two of them did not seem to notice Sarah’s sadness. In fact, they looked a little flustered.

Shelly frowned. She had a feeling that Lizzy and James were acting strange today.

In fact, she barely interacted with them on a daily basis. It was because Sarah had a lively and cheerful personality and had a lot of friends, so Sarah made more friends. On the other hand, she had known Sarah since junior high. They had been in the same class and had been great friends, but she did not like to make friends. Hence, other than Sarah, all her other friends were Sarah’s friends. Since they were friends of friends, she did not have a good relationship with anyone other than Sarah.

James seemed to have noticed Shelly’s gaze, so he quickly nudged Lizzy.

Only then did Lizzy come back to her senses. She looked at Shelly and ignored her gaze. Instead, she pretended to be very worried as she looked at Sarah. “Sarah, Don’t cry. It makes us feel bad.”

However, Sarah did not want to listen to her.

She really wanted to push open the bathroom door because she did not want her cousin to sleep with Finn. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Not this time. Maybe the next. Let’s go,” James quickly interjected.

“Let’s go.” Everyone tried to persuade Sarah.

Under their persuasion, Sarah walked out of the hotel room.

She knew she did not have the courage to push open the bathroom door. Even if she did, she would not have slept with Finn.

Tonight, Finn was her cousin’s, not hers.

However, just as she reached the hotel door, Sarah suddenly pushed Shelly away. “No.”

Shelly was stunned.

“I don’t want to leave.”

“Sarah–”

“I’m not going in. I’ll wait for them at the door. I’ll wait for them to come out.”

“Sarah, why?” Shelly felt a little uncomfortable about that. “It’s not worth torturing yourself for a man who doesn’t like you.”

“No, Finn is worth it. Finn is the best man in the world. He’s worth me waiting for him.”

Shelly was rendered speechless, and Lizzy and James did not know what to say either.

It was already very late in the night, yet Sarah had no intention of leaving. She just stood at the door of the room and looked at the tightly shut door, unmoving.

Lizzy and James were getting a little anxious. The point was that they did not know what to tell the other party who bribed them.

Not to mention the remaining 40 thousand dollars each, but do they also return the 10 thousand dollars that they had received?

The more they thought about it, the more upset they felt.

Lizzy said, “Sarah, it’s late. If I don’t go back now, my parents will beat me to death.”

“Me, too.” James quickly agreed. “They’ve already called several times, and I said I’d be back after my friend’s birthday.”

“You guys can go first.” Sarah said, “Don’t worry about me.”

“But–”

“I’m fine,” Sarah said. “You guys have been running around for me all night. You guys can leave first.”

Lizzy and James exchanged glances before Lizzy said, “In that case, we’re heading off now. If something comes up, you must call us.”

“Okay.” Sarah nodded.

Then, the two of them left reluctantly.

After that, Sarah looked at Shelly beside her. “Shelly, you should go back first too. I’m fine.”

“I’ll stay with you.”

“Won’t your family look for you?”

“They always think that I’m with Nox. Plus, it’s been a long time since Nox came back, but no one has ever asked where I was.” Shelly smiled.

Sarah was a little touched. “Everyone says you’re aloof, but only I know how good you are.”

No. She was not good. If she were, she would not want to be the Winters’ eldest young mistress when Nox disliked her so much.

She was actually a very utilitarian and selfish person.

She was afraid of poverty.

Hence, for the sake of money and wealth, she could persist in many things.

..

After Lizzy and James left the hotel, they immediately called the other person.

Lizzy seemed a little flustered. “We went to the hotel as you instructed and told Sarah to get a spare room keycard from the front desk so that we could personally confirm they slept together. Unexpectedly, as soon as we entered the hotel, we saw Sarah’s cousin, Monica, rushing over in a hurry, and everything after that went awry. Now, Monica and Finn are sleeping together–”

“What did you just say?” The other party was instantly worked up.
