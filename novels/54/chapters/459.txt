Chapter 460: Sweet Shopping

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Don’t fall in love with Fourth Master Swan,” Kingsley reminded her again.

She did not want to either.

Then, she put down the phone with a cold expression.

In the restaurant, Edward was eating the food in front of him. After that, he waited for a long time.

Suddenly, he recalled the last time it happened was also in that shopping mall — when Jeanne abandoned him and left.

Would the same happen again this time?

His eyes moved when he saw that Jeanne was back. It took quite a while, but she came back. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I’m sorry for making you wait for a long time.” Jeanne smiled.

After all, Edward had already finished his lunch.

However, Edward smiled. “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter how long I wait.” All was fine as long as she did not disappear all of a sudden.

Feeling her heart racing, Jeanne said, “Yes.”

It meant that she had agreed she would never leave suddenly again.

After the two of them finished their lunch, Jeanne and Edward walked around the shopping mall again.

......

Jeanne said, “I want to buy some necessities for George.”

“Hm?”

“It’s time for George to size up on his underwear.”

“Has he grown bigger?” Edward asked very seriously.

Jeanne was speechless.

George was only six years old. What was he thinking?

“Oh, he has grown taller, hasn’t he?” Edward seemed to realize that he was overthinking things.

Jeanne nodded.

George was originally shorter among his peers, but since they returned to South Hampton City for three months, he had grown taller, probably because of his diet and sorts.

She noticed George’s clothes and pants had looked a little too short, so naturally, his inner wear had to be changed as well.

She brought Edward to the children’s underwear section.

Since George liked boxers and not briefs, she picked them out seriously with the staff’s help.

Edward was accompanying her at the side when he saw some pink panties in the children’s section.

He was actually a little bored.

He did not quite understand why it was so troublesome for women to go shopping.

As for underwear… Was it not just a simple purchase? Why did it take them so long to pick one?

He finally understood why women could spend so much time shopping.

At that moment, his attention had long been attracted by other children’s clothing.

He walked over naturally and looked at the very small pink panties in front of him. There were even little angel wings on them.

“These are the panties of a two- to four-year-old girl. It’s a new and limited edition style. It’ll look very cute on a baby girl,” the staff recommended.

Edward also thought it was very cute, but it would be even cuter on his daughter.

He said, “Wrap it up.”

“Who are you buying this for?” Jeanne suddenly walked over.

Edward turned his head to her. “My daughter.”

“Where is she?” Jeanne glared at him.

Edward said, “She hasn’t found her way home yet.”

‘Get lost!’ Jeanne thought. Then, she dragged Edward away and left immediately. ‘Don’t you dare trick me into giving birth to your child!’

Edward did not resist as Jeanne dragged him away.

With that, the two of them walked into the children’s clothing area again.

Jeanne bought clothes for George, while Edward chose clothes for his daughter, who had not found her way home yet.

However, of course, Edward ended up not buying anything

Then, the two of them left the children’s area.

Edward asked, “Do you need to buy anything?”

“Haven’t you already prepared everything for me?” From inner- to outerwear.

“In that case, let’s buy something for me,” Edward said.

Jeanne frowned.

She felt that Edward had quite a lot of clothes in the cloakroom.

“Underwear,” Edward said as he dragged Jeanne into the men’s underwear store.

The staff was very enthusiastic.

Jeanne accompanied Edward to walk around under the guidance of the staff.

After one round, Edward asked, “Did you see anything you like?”

He was asking Jeanne, who was stunned.

She did not even look at it.

She thought that he should be the one choosing his own clothes, and Edward seemed to have seen through Jeanne’s thoughts.

He said very seriously, “I’ll wear it for you to see.”

That meant he still wanted her to choose.

The staff at the side could not help but laugh softly.

Jeanne’s face was a little red. Where did the rumored cold and abstinent Fourth Master Swan go?

Speechless, she started to pick out underwear for Edward.

“Do you like boxers or triangle underwear?” Jeanne asked.

“Anything you like.”

“Do you like it tight or loose?”

“Anything you like.”

“Do you like it black or white? Red or gray?”

“Anything you like.”

Jeanne stared at Edward,

Edward said, “I’ll wear whatever you like.”

At that, Jeanne’s face turned red again. She suspected that the guy was thinking about something lewd!

The staff member chuckled again.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Then, she pointed at an exaggerated male leopard-print thong in front of her and said, “I like this.”

Edward took a look at it and was stunned.

He said, “Are you sure?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

She had a feeling that Edward would never want that.

“Wrap it up,” Edward said to the staff member.

The staff member, who was busy watching the show, quickly came back to his senses. “Sure.”

“Give me one in every color,” Edward added.

Jeanne felt that she had dug a hole for herself.

“Okay!” The staff member was quite responsive.

“Are you satisfied, my wife?” Edward asked Jeanne.

‘Satisfied, my *ss.’

Suddenly, Edward bent down.

Even though Jeanne was wearing high heels, he still had to bend down to whisper to her.

As he leaned close to her ear and whispered a few words into Jeanne’s ear, her entire face was bright red, and the color spread down to her neck.

The two’s intimate actions were captured by the paparazzi who had been waiting at the mall.

Who would have thought that the rumored Fourth Master Swan could be so... affectionate when facing his little wife?
