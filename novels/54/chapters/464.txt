Chapter 465: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

Edward picked up a piece of meat for Jeanne, who smiled at him.

Then, Edward whispered in her ear, “If you want it, we can have one too.”

Jeanne was stunned.

Did Edward think that she was jealous of Jasmine?

Jasmine’s pregnancy had indeed caught her by surprise, but they had been married for so long, so they should be pregnant by now. She could not care less about them.

However, since he thought she was jealous, she might as well take it as such. At least, he would not know that she was thinking about other things.

While the two of them chatted quietly, Elaine’s voice suddenly became louder. “I heard you have to be extra careful in the first three months.”

She was talking to Jasmine.

Jasmine quickly replied, “I will be careful, Auntie. Thank you for your concern.”

“I wonder if it’s a boy or a girl?” Elaine asked.

“I hope it’s a girl.” Eden said, “Girls are more considerate. My two cousins, who are like my sisters, are especially nice.”

“You are so sweet.” Elaine was amused by Eden. “But a daughter is really considerate. Look, she just sent me a message saying that I must wish her grandpa a happy birthday for her.”

“My two younger cousins are indeed very likable.”

......

“It’s good if you get a daughter, but the chances for Swans to have a daughter is small,” Belle chimed in.

“That’s true.” Grace also interrupted. “I thought it would be great if our second child were a girl, but unexpectedly, it was another boy. Now, when I see the little girls from other families, I really want to take them home and raise them myself.”

“That’s not necessarily true. Don’t I have two daughters?” Elaine retorted.

In fact, people in Harken still preferred sons over daughters.

Elaine had always been brooding over the fact that she had not been able to have a son, but her pride did not allow her to admit it.

Hence, after hearing her two sisters-in-law say that, she became a little unhappy.

“You’re different. The children you gave birth to don’t bear the family name, so you’re not considered a Swan,” Belle said without thinking too much.

Elaine’s expression changed immediately.

Henry hurriedly stopped his wife. “What nonsense are you spouting? Elaine will always be a Swan.”

Belle also realized that she had said something wrong and quickly corrected herself, “I didn’t mean that. I just wish Jasmine could give birth to a daughter. Elaine, don’t take it to heart. Sometimes, what I say may not be pleasant to the ear.”

Elaine was, after all, the second miss of the Swans. She had always been very arrogant and looked down on her sister-in-laws, who had married into the family. Her tone was a little sarcastic when she said, “It’s okay. You were from a small family. It’s understandable that you can’t speak without offending people.”

Belle’s face was a little ugly.

Her family was indeed inferior to the Swans, but not to the extent of being ridiculed by Elaine.

Belle wanted to retort, but Henry stopped her.

Henry said, “Us, Swans, have never prioritized boys over girls. Their health is all that matters!”

“That’s right. Health is the most important,” Belle quickly agreed.

She was afraid that those people would start fighting and that she would get herself into trouble.

She and Richard were more well-behaved. They knew very well that they would never have control of the family, so they did not fight over it and just wanted to get their share.

The dinner table was a little livelier because of Jasmine’s pregnancy.

Old Master Swan did not stop them from discussing the child either. He figured that since he was getting older, family was important.

After dinner, no one was in a hurry to go back. They all accompanied Old Master Swan and sat in the main hall for a while.

During that time, Jeanne went to the washroom and had just come out when she saw Jasmine, who was probably waiting for her on purpose.

Jeanne glanced at Jasmine and turned to leave.

However, Jasmine grabbed Jeanne at that moment. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jeanne frowned.

Jasmine said, “Sister, I’m pregnant.”

“Congratulations,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“You and Fourth Master still don’t have good news?” Jasmine asked her.

Jeanne moved her arm, indicating for Jasmine to let go of her.

With that, Jasmine let go.

Jeanne said, “That’s my business. Mind your own business.”

“Sister, are you jealous? Because I married into the Swans for only two months and got pregnant with Eden’s child.” Jasmine seemed to be deliberately provoking Jeanne.

Jeanne really thought that Jasmine was stupid enough sometimes.

She said, “Jasmine, the Swans have many children and grandchildren. Don’t be too proud.”

Jasmine’s face darkened.

“I’m assuming Eden has been treating you worse and worse lately.” Jeanne smiled sarcastically.

“What nonsense are you spouting?”
