“Monica!” Reese screamed at her.

Monica pretended not to hear.

Even after chasing Reese away, Monica did not feel much better.

Her head was hurting from being hungover. Now, her brain felt like it was about to explode.

She picked up the phone and called Michael.

“Hi Monica, it’s rare for you to call me-”

“Let’s break up.” Monica ignored Michael’s gentleness and spoke bluntly.

Michael was silent for a few seconds.

“Now that your career’s going well, I don’t think there’s a need for us to continue this charade.”

“Didn’t you say three months? There’s still a month left.” Michael said softly.

“That’s because I didn’t expect you to be so capable. It only took such a short time for you to stabilize your career. I underestimated your abilities.” Monica said, trying her best to appear calm.

“For the first time ever, I want to be in denial about my capabilities.” Michael smiled bitterly.

Monica pursed her lips.

She had no regrets about Michael.

Monica felt that he was a good person, thus she sincerely helped him to this extent.

“Let’s find a time to announce it to the public,” Monica said coldly.

“Now’s not the time yet,” Michael advised.

Monica was obviously torn.

“We haven’t been together for long. At that time, everyone knew that our relationship was a serious one. If we break up now, it would stir up a lot of public opinion. They would think that we treated our relationship lightly.”

“So be it. That’s how relationships are anyway.” Monica said nonchalantly.

“Monica, can you please give me more time?” Michael did not agree to breaking up now. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Why?” Monica was annoyed. She felt a little disgusted.

“The congress is about to be held, and it’s now time for candidates to be shortlisted. I’m currently a candidate. If there’s any negative news about me now, it’ll affect my chances at being chosen,” Michael said. “And the congress meeting will be where the most worthy talent would be at. Only by attending such a meeting can my career truly take off.”

Monica bit her lip and said nothing.

Michael felt extremely guilty. He said, “I’m sorry for putting this on you, Monica.”

“But Michael, a peaceful breakup shouldn’t have a negative impact on you, no? It’s just public opinion. With your current abilities, it shouldn’t be difficult to suppress the news! Besides, is it a requirement that political candidates can’t go through a break up or a divorce?”

“I’m just worried about doing this at a crucial moment...”

“We’ll have to face it sooner rather than later. Our break up is inevitable. Your career will always be growing. Does that mean I have to keep playing along with this?!”

“That’s not what I meant,” Michael quickly explained. “I’m only saying that we have too little time. If we suddenly announce our breakup, it will garner negative public sentiments. But if we dated a little longer and our relationship became old news, no one would take much interest in our break up. That’s all I meant.”

“If I say that I don’t like you anymore and that I like someone else, will that not affect you?” Monica suddenly asked.

Michael winced.

His expression darkened and his eyes turned cold.

“If I’m the cause of the break up—if I abandon you for another—will that be better for you?”

“Monica, don’t overthink this-”

“Let’s do this,” Monica said. “If everyone knew that I was unfaithful to you and I was the one to dump you, there won’t be any negative news for you. In fact, there will be a lot of support and understanding from the public.”

“Monica, I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself for me. If you want to break up, we’ll break up. I’ll discuss this with my public relations team immediately on how we can minimize the damage to us.” Michael said agitatedly.

He only thought about her.

“I’ll give you one day, Michael. I hope you’ll get back to me tomorrow.”

“Alright,” Michael agreed.

Monica hung up immediately.

She really didn’t want to be entangled with Michael anymore.

In fact, she had been wanting to tell Michael this idea ever since he was on the right track, but every time she picked up her phone, she stopped herself.

They agreed for the relationship to last three months. Fine, just three months.
