Chapter 657: The Relationship Between Edward and Jeanne Started When She Was in the Womb!

Edward looked at her.

“That’s why I have to trouble you to do it for me.” Penelope looked expectant.

Edward did not know why, but he agreed and bought a huge ice cream and gave it to Penelope.

Penelope ate happily like a child.

However, she was only halfway through her ice cream when a group of doctors and nurses in white coats rushed into her ward and took the ice cream away from her hands. Then, they lectured Penelope angrily.

Edward had forgotten what they lectured her about. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

All he remembered was the doctors checking Penelope’s body carefully and only leaving after a long time.

After they left, Penelope was the only one in the room.

There was also Edward, who had been waiting by her side.

Edward asked her, “Why do you still want to eat ice cream if you can’t eat it?”

“I was craving it,” Penelope answered matter-of-factly.

“But you have to think about the baby in your stomach. What if something happens to her?” When his sister-in-law was pregnant, she was extremely cautious.

However, the pregnant woman before him was the total opposite.

“You’re right.” Penelope suddenly became serious.

Edward frowned.

“Since you gave me ice cream, you have to be responsible for my daughter if anything happens to her.”

Edward’s face turned green.

She was the one who wanted to eat it. How could she blame him now?

“Fourth Master.” Penelope beckoned for him to come over.

Edward looked guarded and unhappy.

“Do you want a wife?” Penelope suddenly asked.

Edward’s entire face turned red.

“How about I give birth to a wife for you?” Penelope continued to tease him.

Edward’s face turned even redder.

“I don’t ask for much. Just treat her well in the future,” Penelope said.

“I don’t want to,” Edward refused loudly.

“Don’t refuse too soon. What if you regret it?”

At that, Edward immediately ran out of Penelope’s ward. He knew he would not regret it. However, he did not take that matter to heart as well.

After that, he went to the base to receive training. He would come back occasionally, and there was once he bumped into Penelope again.

That time, it was at a business dinner that he accompanied his father to attend.

He was eight years old that year, but since he was taller than his peers, he gave people the impression of a noble young man.

When he left his father for the backyard to get some fresh air, he saw Penelope swinging on the swing barefoot.

He had never seen a woman take off her gorgeous high heels at an event like that.

“Fourth Master.” Penelope looked at him and greeted him.

Edward thought she would not recognize the woman, but he could not believe he remembered her so vividly.

“Don’t you remember me?” Penelope smiled and said, “You bought me ice cream, and I said I would give you a wife.

“Your wife is four years old now,” Penelope said naturally.

“I didn’t agree to it.”

“Come here. Let me show you a photo of your wife.” Penelope called out to Edward as if she could not feel Edward’s repulsion.

Edward did not want to go over. However, at that moment, he made his way over as if some kind of force was pulling him to her.

Back then, the pixels on mobile phones were not high. However, he could see from the screen how beautiful and doll-like the little girl was.

“Isn’t she pretty?” Penelope asked.

Edward nodded instinctively.

“You must treat her very well in the future,” Penelope reminded him.

Edward quickly ran away. “I don’t want to.”

Then, the next time he saw Penelope was at her funeral. That year, he was 12 years old.

He did not expect the woman, who would always have a conversation with him and had a smile on her face, would suddenly die.

Apparently, it was a car accident, and when she died... she was beyond recognition.

On that day, he also met his “wife”, a girl called Jeanne.

She was kneeling on the ground as if the whole world had abandoned her.

In fact, the image of Penelope stayed in Edward’s mind for a long time. He always thought that the person who became Penelope’s daughter should be very happy. After all, even though he was not Penelope’s child and had only interacted with Penelope twice in a hurry, he could still feel the warmth Penelope gave off. Oh, how happy would Penelope’s daughter be?

However, the happier she was, the more miserable she would be!

The unexpected loss of someone like that must be very painful.

Yet, he could do nothing about it.

Ever since he was young, he did not have the ability to love others, nor did he have the ability to treat others well.
