Chapter 105: Divorce Without Success, Conditions Negotiated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Dad.”

“Hear me out.” Gary was serious. “The Ross Family has a high position and power. Their target was for Micheal to get married to the girl from the Sanders Family. Families like us who run businesses will not be considered by the Ross Family. It’s not that I don’t trust Micheal Ross, but I put my daughter’s happiness at stake.”

Monica looked at her father.

“If the Ross Family really accepts you and you have feelings for Micheal Ross, I’m not the kind of person who would break up a couple. If you two want to be together, I definitely won’t object. But if the Ross Family doesn’t accept you, even if you hang yourself, I won’t let you marry him. This is my bottom line.”

Monica was somewhat unwilling.

However, her father had already said this much, so she knew that it was useless for her to resist.

She said, “Alright, once the Ross Family accepts me, Promise me that you’ll agree to the divorce immediately.”

Gary ignored Monica and turned to Dr. Finn. “Dr. Finn, sorry to have let you down. Please bear with this during this period of time.”

Dr. Finn shook his head, “I grew up because of your support. That’s why I was able to receive this much education and have the life I have now. To me, you guys are my parents as well. I can’t be more grateful to you guys, so I won’t let you down.”

So...

When Dr. Finn was with Monica back then, it must have been to repay her family’s kindness.

She knew it.

How could someone as meticulous as Dr. Finn fall in love with her unbridled personality?

Gary nodded and told Monica fiercely, “You better behave yourself during this period of time. You and Dr. Finn are in a contract marriage right now, but that doesn’t mean that you can do whatever you want. You can not do anything with Micheal Ross!”

“I know.” Monica was speechless.

She still had this moral bottom line.

“Also, don’t ignore Dr. Finn every day. To be fair, whether you’re married or not, you both can still be friends.”

“When did I ignore him? I treat him as a friend too.” Monica retorted.

“Alright. It’s the weekend, so stay at home and have dinner before going back.” Gary stood up from the sofa. “I’m so angry with you today that I’m about to have a heart attack. Dr. Finn, accompany me upstairs and help me with a check-up.”

“Okay.”

Dr. Finn accompanied Gary back to his room.

Monica looked at their figures and turned around to meet her mother’s gaze.

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I’m really afraid that you’ll regret it.” Ruby was helpless.

“I won’t regret it! I’ve lived with Dr. Finn for three years. I know very well how vile he is. I won’t regret it.” Monica was very determined.

Ruby could not do anything about Monica.

At this moment, Sarah was suddenly very excited. “Cousin, are you really going to divorce cousin-in-law?”

“It’s not going to. I’m definitely divorcing him.”

“Does that mean that I can admit my feelings for him now?”

Monica frowned and patted Sarah’s head. “You’re still young, do you know what it means to like someone? Just focus on your studies.”

“I’m eighteen years old. I’ve already developed everything.” As she said that, she puffed out her chest. “Better than yours.”

“Sarah, you shameless...”

Seeing that Monica was angry, Sarah ran away.

Monica did not take Sarah’s words to heart. In her heart, Sarah was still a child.

What would a child know?

Sarah went upstairs alone.

She saw Dr. Finn leave her uncle’s room.

She had actually come to look for him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Cousin-in-law!” Sarah took the initiative to call him.

Dr. Finn nodded slightly, not too enthusiastic.

“If my cousin doesn’t want you anymore, I want you!” Sarah said with a smile. “I like you.”

Dr. Finn looked at Sarah and said indifferently, “Study hard.”

“If I study well, can I chase after you?”

“No.” Dr. Finn rejected directly. “Studying will make you have less time to think about these things.”

“...”

Dr. Finn left coldly.

Sarah looked at Dr. Finn’s back view.

She was serious about liking Dr. Finn.

Even though he was 12 years older than her, she had fallen in love with him and had liked him for many years.

She always hoped that she could grow up quickly.

When she grew up, she would be able to pursue Dr. Finn.

She picked up her phone and took a photo of his back view.

Then she sent it to her friend. “My Prince Charming. Is he handsome?”

Shelly Carter was doing revision questions at the moment.

She received a photo of Sarah and looked at it. “It’s just his back view.”

“Don’t you think his back is very handsome?”

Shelly was speechless.

“How can I woo him?” Sarah was a little melancholic. “He doesn’t care about me.”

“I don’t know,” Shelly replied. “After all, I’ve chased after a man for ten years and I haven’t succeeded.”

“That’s true.” Sarah smiled. “Let’s not talk about it anymore. I’m going to get to know my Prince Charming.”

“Okay.”

Shelly put down her phone.

She looked at the college entrance exam mock exam paper in front of her and suddenly felt a little unable to continue.

She moved her body and turned her head to look at the laptop in the room.

She hesitated for a moment, walked to the computer, and turned on the computer.

She entered a web address.

The screen popped up with the words “PG 18”.

She directly clicked X. After all, she was already eighteen years old.

She registered an account, topped up the credits, and clicked on the first movie video on the list.

She just sat there, calmly watching.

…

Nox Winter slept until the sun was up.

He rubbed his messy hair and was about to go to the living room to order takeout when he suddenly heard a strange sound coming from a room.

This sound was too familiar.

He had just experienced it last night.

He followed the sound and directly pushed open Shelly’s door.

At that time, he thought that the girl who had accompanied him home last night had not left and was practicing her voice early in the morning.

However.

The moment he pushed the door open, he was completely stunned.

He saw Shelly, a child who had not even matured in his heart, sitting in front of the computer and watching... movies.

What made him even more speechless was that when she found him looking at her, she actually did not feel embarrassed at all. She turned her head and looked straight at him. After a glance, she turned back to look at the screen.

Nox Winter was a little impatient.

He took two steps forward and directly closed Shelly’s computer.

Shelly’s eyes blinked at the interruption.

“How old are you? Why are you looking at these things?” Nox lectured her with a righteous face.

“I just want to know, what makes these things so likable?”

“You’ll know when you grow up. Now just study hard and don’t think too much.” Nox left these words and was planning to leave.

The moment he left, he did not forget to take the computer away.

“Brother.” Shelly suddenly called him.

“What?”

“Do you have to do it every night?” Shelly was straightforward.

Nox Winter, who had been through so much in life, was a little embarrassed by the young girl’s question.

He said impatiently, “Don’t ask about adult matters. You’re still a child.”

“Do you have to do it with a different woman every night?”

“Shelly Carter, I told you to study hard! Asking these questions will not help you with your studies!” Nox Winter frowned. “I’ve already said that you’ll know when you grow up.”

“I’m actually not young anymore.” Shelly said, “In my hometown, girls get married at 18 years old.”

“That’s because your hometown is backward...”

“I asked the young lady who slept with you yesterday. She’s only 18.”

“Really?” Nox Winter was stunned.

She looked so mature, how could she be only 18?

No.

That was not the point.

He said, “This isn’t something you should worry about...”

It was something he should worry about.

After all, she had entered this house to marry him.

She said casually, “Let’s try it tonight.”

At that moment, Nox’s eyes widened.
