1380 Getting Along and George’s Rejection

He saw the bouquet of flowers in the room that had been withering for two days.

Brandon was stunned. Since when did he send her flowers?

“I’m not thinking about dating right now, so whatever you do won’t affect me too much.” At that moment, Monica had placed her attention on her computer screen and said lightly, “When I really want to start a new relationship and you happen to be single, I will let you know.”

What she meant was, ‘Do not bother me now.”

Brandon looked at Monica’s expression, and in the end, he said, “I didn’t send you the flowers.”

Monica’s hand that was on the keyboard paused.

“This unoriginal way of picking up girls is not my style.”

Monica pursed her lips.

“It might be Finn,” Brandon said bluntly.

He wanted to win her over openly, so he did not have to be afraid of anyone.

“You may leave.” Monica did not say anything else other than that.

With that, Brandon nodded and left.

After the office door closed, Monica finally looked away from the computer screen and looked at the bouquet of flowers placed beside her.

Never in her dreams would she have thought that Finn would send her flowers. In fact, she had never thought about that possibility before.

She reached out, pulled open a drawer at the side, and looked at the cards inside. Then, she casually took out one and looked at the handwritten words.

She really could not recognize that it was Finn’s writing. Therefore, it was not Finn’s fault alone because she did not know much about Finn. That was why their relationship was a failure.

Monica found all the cards and threw them away. She also threw away the bouquet of flowers that had yet to completely wither.

It was not difficult to end a relationship.

…

In Bamboo Garden, Candice really did lie in bed for the whole day and only got up when it was time for dinner.

When she woke up, her back was still sore. She did not know if she had slept too much or… ‘slept’ too much the night before.

She changed into a set of light pink lounge clothes and went downstairs. As she went downstairs, her legs were trembling.

Edward, the man who had spent the entire day in bed with her, was currently walking down the stairs with her. He was smiling brightly as he watched her walk down the stairs.

Candice glared at him. “What are you laughing at?! It’s all because of you!”

Edward endured it. “I’ll be more careful next time.”

‘There will be no next time!’ Candice thought.

Edward took the initiative to hold Candice’s hand as they walked toward the living room, where George and Paige were watching TV on the sofa.

It was obvious that they were watching a cartoon that Paige liked, and George was watching it with his sister.

The moment Paige saw them coming downstairs, she quickly got off the sofa with her short legs and ran to them. She hugged Candice’s calf and said, “Mommy, you’re finally awake.”

Candice felt a little embarrassed. Then, when she recalled the scene of Paige coming to look for them at noon… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She squatted down and patted Paige’s head. “Yeah.”

“Mommy, hold me.” Paige stretched out her hand, and her big eyes were filled with anticipation.

Just as Candice was about to pick up Paige…

Edward suddenly picked Paige up. “Daddy will hold you.”

“No, I want Mommy to hold me,” Paige resisted.

Children were born rebellious.

“You’re as fat as a piglet. Mommy can’t hold you.”

“Well.” Paige looked aggrieved. “I’m not very fat.”

“I’ll do it.” Candice really could not bear to see Paige’s pitiful look.

She felt as if her heart was being tugged by something and she wanted to give Paige the world.

“Your legs were shaking when you went downstairs. Are you sure you can hold her?” Edward asked.

Candice blushed again.

What was he saying in front of the child?

Edward held Paige and explained, “Mommy can’t carry anything too heavy now. Paige, you’re no longer a baby, so Mommy can’t hold you.”

“Is Mommy pregnant?” Paige asked innocently.

Did a three-year-old girl really know everything?

“I just watched a cartoon that said that pregnant mothers can’t carry heavy objects. Just now, Lily wanted her mother to carry him, but her mommy rejected her.” The so-called Lily was a character in the cartoon.

“No.” Edward said, “Mommy worked too hard last night.”
