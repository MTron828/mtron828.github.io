Chapter 305: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

He must have been scared even though he did not scream out loud.

Luckily, it was just a dummy. Otherwise, that punch would have turned a man into a ghost.

After that, Fourth Master Swan’s footsteps began to slow down, and he became increasingly tenser.

At that moment, a warm little hand suddenly held his fist-clenched hand.

Edward turned his head over, but in the darkness, he could not make out much of Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “You’ll feel better this way.”

In fact, she also could not control her fear anymore.

As soon as she said that, a figure floated past them.

“Ah!” Jeanne screamed, clearly frightened.

Suddenly, Edward hugged her in his arms, and their bodies pressed together tightly.

“Keep going,” Jeanne reminded.

She was considered very brave. Although she was still a little frightened by the horror happening here, she was doing much better than a few years ago.

She held Edward’s hand tightly, and Edward also held hers tightly.

......

Both of their attentions were focused on their surroundings, and they were very careful.

“Ah!” Jeanne screamed again because someone had touched her.

Edward began to tremble as he, too, was frightened.

Just like that, the two of them finally walked out of the frightening environment.

When they walked out, both their hands were still clinging tightly to each other.

Jeanne’s little face was pale with fear, but Fourth Master Swan was not much better either.

The two of them followed the crowd and walked out.

“Do you come here often with Eden?”

Jeanne was still in shock and had yet to come to her senses.

“Did you also walk out with Eden like this?” Edward’s tone was neither cold nor warm.

Jeanne was speechless, to say the least, and she thought, ‘So what?!’

She lowered her head and looked down at Fourth Master Swan and her tightly held hands.

Eventually, she replied, “Yes.”

A certain someone’s expression changed.

She did not lie to Fourth Master Swan. She and Eden were most intimate in the haunted house.

It was probably the reason why Eden would still drag her into the haunted house even though he would be scared to death every time.

Back then, Eden... was sincere to her.

Otherwise, she would not have liked him that much back then.

She would not have been so unwilling to go to that extent.

Now that she thought about it, the thing that she could not accept the most when she found out that Eden and Jasmine had cheated on her seven years ago was why Eden was seduced by Qiao Wu. She had always thought that besides her, Eden was not interested in anyone else.

As expected, she thought too highly of herself.

The two of them suddenly fell silent until a staff member dressed in festive clothes walked over with an enthusiastic expression. “Sir, buy a cup of hot chocolate for miss. It’ll warm her heart and calm her down. Then, she won’t be afraid anymore.”

They both looked at the staff member in front of them.

Slowly, Fourth Master Swan let go of her hand.

There were actually sweat stains on each other’s palms because they were scared out of their wits.

“Did Eden buy one for you too?” Fourth Master Swan asked.

Jeanne could not help but laugh. “Are you jealous?”

Edward said, “No.”

No? What a joke.

However, she saw through him and said with a smile, “I’ll go buy it.”

“I’ll go.” Edward immediately followed the staff member to join the queue while Jeanne waited for him at the side.

She noticed that he stood out among the crowd and could point him out at a glance.

At that moment, she could hear a few young ladies beside her discussing. “He’s so handsome.”

“He’s too handsome.” Another one echoed.

“Is he a celebrity?”

“A celebrity will definitely wear a mask. Besides, I would’ve recognized such a handsome celebrity,” the young lady said confidently.

“That’s true. However, what a pity for him not to become a celebrity with such a handsome face! If he becomes a celebrity, I will definitely be his loyal fan.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Me too...” The little girl’s heart was moved, and so was Jeanne’s.

No.

She was moved but not in that way.

Therefore, when she saw that Fourth Master Swan was already in line, she turned around and left.

It was not that she did not want to trust his promise, but people like them would not let go of an opportunity when there was one. With that, she quickly left and disappeared into the crowd.

After Edward bought the hot chocolate and turned around, he could not see Jeanne anymore.

He just stood there, in the same spot Jeanne had just stood for a long time.

Seeing him standing there, the few little girls beside him were a little puzzled but excited.
