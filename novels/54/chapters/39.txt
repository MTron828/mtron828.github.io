Chapter 40: Jeanne Sent Fourth Master Swan Home, and They Kissed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Jeanne saw everyone in the private room clearly, she knew she had been tricked by Monica.

She turned around and was about to leave.

Monica grabbed her. “Sister Jeanne.”

Usually, when Monica had something to ask of Jeanne, she would call her that.

Jeanne looked grim.

“You finally came back, and we haven’t gathered like this for a long time. Please do me the honor of spending some time with me.” Monica acted coquettishly.

Jeanne looked at her coldly.

“Yes, yes, yes. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have lied to you, but would you have come out if I didn’t say that?” Monica said with a fawning look.

At this moment, Finn also walked over. “Have a seat. We’ll be leaving soon too.”

Jeanne looked at Finn and nodded slowly.

Monica’s heart was breaking.

‘Does Jeanne really fancy Finn?!’ VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Monica had just said a lot, but it was nothing compared to what Finn had said.

She watched in displeasure as Jeanne walked into the private room.

Jeanne chose a corner and sat down.

Monica sat next to her with a fawning look. “Jeannie, what song do you want to sing? I’ll queue it for you.”

“I’m not singing.”

“Let’s have a drink then?”

“I’m not drinking.”

“Do you want to eat snacks?”

“No.”

“Jeannie...”

“You can play on your own. I know how to kill time.” Jeanne was indifferent.

Monica saw that Jeanne really did not like this environment, so she rubbed her nose and went to have fun by herself.

Jeanne took out her phone and sat on the side to play a little game to kill time.

She was clearing a round in the game.

“Ms. Lawrence.” A man walked over, holding a glass of wine.

Jeanne looked up.

“Nox. Do you still remember me, Ms. Lawrence?” Nox introduced himself.

Jeanne smiled. “Of course, we played mahjong together.”

Nox also smiled. “Actually, we met more than once. Seven years ago...”

“Mr. Winter.” Jeanne interrupted him. “If you’d like to drink with me, I’m sorry, it’s not convenient for me these few days.”

Nox was naturally not stupid. He knew that Jeanne did not want to say much, so he smiled and said, “Please help yourself then.”

Jeanne smiled.

Nox returned to his seat and chatted with Fourth Master Swan and Finn while drinking.

Jeanne continued to lower her head and play with her phone.

“Miss, here’s your plain water.” The waiter suddenly approached.

Jeanne was stunned. “Thank you.”

The waiter left respectfully.

At 10:30 pm, Finn said to Monica, who was still singing affectionately, “Monica, it’s getting late. It’s time to go back.”

“It’s only past 10:00 pm.” Monica was obviously not satisfied.

“Everyone has something to do tomorrow.”

Monica was helpless. She put down the microphone. “Let’s go then.”

She turned around and walked toward Jeanne. “Jeannie, let’s go.”

“Okay.” Jeanne stood up.

Everyone also stood up from their seats.

Monica looked at Fourth Master Swan and had an idea. She suddenly asked, “Fourth master, did you drink?”

Fourth Master Swan looked at Monica. “What do you think?”

“Jeannie hasn’t drunk. Why don’t you let her send you back?” Monica arranged the matter and added, “Finn, Nox, and I drank. We can’t send you back.”

Fourth Master Swan turned to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne knew what Monica was thinking.

Monica was trying to set her up with Fourth Master Swan…

It was just that Fourth Master Swan was out of Jeanne’s league.

Jeanne casually picked up the wine glass beside her and suddenly emptied it.

Monica was dumbfounded.

The others also seemed to be... surprised.

Jeanne said calmly, “I drank too. I can’t drive, so I can’t send Fourth Master back.”

It was such an obvious rejection.

Monica was so embarrassed that she wanted to die. She quickly picked up some water and pretended to be dumb.

As she drank, she thought, ‘Why is Jeanne so clueless?!’

It was a little awkward.

Fourth Master Swan opened his mouth and said, “It’s alright. I have a chauffeur. I’ll send Ms. Lawrence home.”

“Pfft!” Monica spat out a mouthful of water.

Finn looked at Monica with disdain and handed her a tissue.

Monica wiped the corner of her mouth and said hurriedly, “Thanks for the trouble, Fourth Master Swan. You must send Jeannie home safely.”

“Of course.” Fourth Master Swan nodded and said to Jeanne, “Let’s go, Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At that moment, she wanted to vomit blood.

She braced herself and left with Fourth Master Swan.

Monica watched them leave. No matter how she looked at it, she felt that they were a match made in heaven! She muttered, “There’s a chance!”

Nox stood by the side and smiled without saying a word.

…

Jeanne sat in Fourth Master Swan’s car.

The two of them had settled down, but the car did not start.

After a long while, Jeanne could not hold it in any longer. She asked, “Are you still waiting for someone, Fourth Master?”

“I’m waiting for you to fasten your seatbelt,” Fourth Master Swan said bluntly.

“...” At that moment, Jeanne wanted to curse.

She somewhat rudely fastened her seatbelt.

‘Who the f*ck wears a seatbelt in the backseat?!’

After Jeanne fastened her seatbelt, the car drove on the wide streets of South Hampton City.

No one spoke on the way.

Jeanne was only looking out of the window at all the darkness in South Hampton City.

Fourth Master Swan sat next to her and closed his eyes to rest.

The car arrived at the Swans’ private residence.

Following that, the driver parked the car at Bamboo Garden.

Jeanne turned her head and looked at the motionless Fourth Master Swan.

Experience told her that she could not expect Fourth Master Swan to take the initiative. She opened her mouth and said, “Fourth Master, we’re here.”

Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly. He opened his eyes and looked straight at Jeanne.

Jeanne repeated, “We’re here.”

“Yes,” Fourth Master Swan replied and said slowly, “Ms. Lawrence, I’ll ask the driver to send you back. Shouldn’t you return the favor by sending me back to my room?”

“Are you drunk, Fourth Master Swan?”

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re wise indeed.”

“...” Jeanne wanted to slap herself.

Seeing how Fourth Master Swan was sitting so steadily, she knew she could not outlast him.

She unfastened her seatbelt and got out of the car. Then, she walked over to Fourth Master Swan’s side and opened the car door for him.

Fourth Master Swan still did not move.

Jeanne gritted her teeth. It was as if... she was being filial to an elder or serving a disabled person!

She bent down and was about to unfasten Fourth Master Swan’s seatbelt when he suddenly raised his head.

As she was caught off guard... his lips touched hers.

Jeanne was stunned.

She looked straight at Fourth Master Swan, whose face was right in front of her, and saw him staring at her.

Their eyes met.

Jeanne jerked away.

Her heart was beating fast.

As for the man in front of her, he still had the same expression... His expression did not change, and he seemed calm.

Jeanne secretly adjusted her emotions and pretended that nothing had happened.

She lowered her head and continued to unfasten Fourth Master Swan’s seatbelt. “Fourth Master, get out of the car.”

Fourth Master Swan held onto Jeanne’s arm and got out of the car with her.

Jeanne unsteadily helped Fourth Master Swan into his room and rested him on his big bed.

She panted.

Fourth Master Swan did not look like he had much flesh, but he was as heavy as a lump of iron.

Jeanne turned around and was about to leave.

“Ms. Lawrence,” Fourth Master Swan suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne was a little impatient. She turned around. “Yes, Fourth Master?”

“Next time you kiss me, remember to stick out your tongue.”
