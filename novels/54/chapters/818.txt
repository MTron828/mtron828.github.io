His face was covered in blood, but it was obvious that his face was pale. Even his lips were frighteningly pale.

She did not look at his face for long. She lowered her head and lit a cigarette before placing it beside Edward’s mouth. “Let me help you clean your right palm.”

Edward took a puff of his cigarette and could still feel the warmth from the area Jeanne put her lips on. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He simply looked at Jeanne.

His eyes were deathly still, and they were not as sharp as when he met Kingsley’s gaze earlier, probably because he did not want to pretend in front of Jeanne.

Moreover, he was really weak now.

At that moment, Jeanne’s attention was on his right hand. She said, “The abrasions are very serious, and there are metal fragments in the palm. It’s already inflamed and starting to fester. I have to clean up the rotten part first and then do a deep disinfection before applying medicine and bandaging it. It might be very painful.”

It was not a ‘might’; it would definitely be very painful.

Edward did not reply, but the burning cigarette was still propped against his mouth. It was as if he was trying to warm up his cold body.

Jeanne took out the half-smoked cigarette from his mouth and put it out.

She said, “I’ll let you smoke again after I’m done. ”

Edward did not refuse.

As Jeanne spoke, she had already taken out a clean towel and placed it by Edward’s mouth. “Bite it.”

If he did not bite it, he would most likely bite his own tongue.

Edward opened his mouth, seemingly obedient to Jeanne’s arrangements.

Jeanne looked at him deep in the eyes before turning around, lifting his arm that was chained, and placing his palm on her thigh.

A bloody hand appeared in front of her.

In fact, it was not as if she had never seen such a gory scene before.

No matter how special Kingsley treated her in the Hills, she had seen many cruel and brutal scenes.

That was why she could look indifferent to it.

She took out a pair of medical pliers and a pair of scissors. After a simple disinfection, she began to clean his rotten flesh bit by bit.

Just as she touched his palm, Edward’s entire body tensed up.

It was obvious that he could not suppress his body’s reaction. However, his palm in front of her did not move at all. Even his fingers did not bend.

Jeanne did not look up to see his reaction. She forced herself to focus all her attention on his palm. After making sure that all the festering parts had been cleaned, she disinfected them with iodophor. During the disinfection, she really put the iodophor into his flesh. She was afraid that if she did not disinfect it thoroughly, the wounds on his palm would fester again from the inside, and the remaining flesh left on his palm would not be able to withstand repeated cleaning.

Once the disinfection was completed, Jeanne applied the highly irritating ointment again.

“Ah!” Even though he tried his best to endure it, he still made a sound in the end.

It was a suppressed, dull, controlled, and painful sound.

Upon hearing that, Jeanne’s hands trembled. She, too, found it hard to bear to hear him in pain.

She knew all too well how painful the process would be.

She even wondered if ordinary people would also find it unbearable and if they would have died from the pain.

However, she gritted her teeth and did not stop. After applying the ointment, she wrapped the gauze gently around his hand.

After tidying up, Jeanne raised her head and looked at Edward, who was drenched in sweat.

She watched as he leaned weakly against the wall. His eyes were on her, but they seemed to be out of focus. He was just staring at one place blankly, so weak that he could not react at all.

Jeanne removed the towel from his mouth and said, “The wound has been treated.”

There was still no reaction from Edward.

Jeanne stood up and gave some instructions to the door. Then, she returned to Edward’s side and took out a few pills from the first aid kit.

After a while, the assassin at the door brought Jeanne a cup of warm water.

“Take two anti-inflammatory pills,” Jeanne said.

Edward seemed to look up, but he did not respond.

Jeanne placed the cup of warm water by his dry lips. However, his lips did not move.

It meant that he had no intention of drinking water.

Hence, Jeanne waited for a while before saying, “You don’t even have the strength to drink water?”

Edward did not reply. All he did was look at her indifferently.

“I’ll help you,” Jeanne said.

As she said that, she stuffed the pill into Edward’s mouth.
