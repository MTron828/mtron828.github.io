Chapter 1485: Monica Suspects Candice’s Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He was just a chivalrous man. He was definitely not worried about Candice.

“You know very well that I’m not talking nonsense. I’m just warning you that there will be evidence of what you have done, so don’t… push your luck.

Otherwise, you’ll be digging your own grave!” George enunciated each word.

Chloe was really threatened by that little brat, George, who was to succeed his father as the Leader of the country in the future. He was only ten years old, but she was really frightened.

She smiled nervously. “George, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m sincerely good to my sister and you guys.”

George did not say anything else. At that point, it was fine as long as Chloe

Imew that he knew because he did not have that much time to waste on that

He said, “Please push me back.”

As such, Chloe could only push George away.

She had thought that George wanted to push her into the pool, which was all she thought that little wimp could do. However, she did not expect that George could threaten her without doing anything.

She gritted her teeth, feeling very annoyed, but she could only endure it. After pushing George into the hall, George told Teddy to send him back to his room.

Chloe looked at George’s back and turned around to see Candice sitting on the sofa watching television, looking very relaxed. She could not understand how Candice managed to please that brat, George. She really felt it was difficult to get close to George.

In fact, she felt that Candice was completely different from a few years ago. Candice was not like that in the past. Although she was outstanding in all aspects, she was not so capable when it came to dealing with people.

Could it be that his brain cells had evolved after lying in bed for a few years?

“Are you looking for me?” Candice looked at Chloe’s scrutinizing gaze and asked.

Chloe came back to her senses and said, “No, I just thought you seem to have changed a lot from before.”

“Oh,” Candice responded softly but did not seem to be too keen on that topic.

Chloe sat beside Candice and said affectionately, “Sister, do you not remember what happened in the past?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Candice shook her head. “I don’t.”

Chloe believed Candice was not lying. However, if Candice did not remember anything, how did George know about the past?

How could he have known that in order to get Candice into an accident back then, she had deliberately given her a cup of juice with sleeping pills before her sister performed?

Moreover, even if Candice did remember, she would not know that Chloe had put sleeping pills in it! Hence, how did George know? Or was that child too smart and deliberately trying to get information out of her?

In any case, she would rather die than admit it, and no one would have any evidence. She was sure that she did not leave any evidence behind.

“Sis, have you ever thought about why Edward suddenly married you?” Chloe spoke as if she was chatting casually with Candice without any ulterior motives.

“We’re already married. Even if there’s a reason, it doesn’t matter. What’s important is the life we’ll live together in the future.” Candice did not care about why they were together.

After all, she was not bothered about being in a political marriage. All she wanted was to have a peaceful life in the future.

Actually, she did not need Edward to love her, nor did she need him to love her that much. As long as the two of them or rather, the family spent the rest of their lives together peacefully, she was content.

“Have you thought about having children?” Chloe asked.

Candice was silent for a few seconds. She had thought about it. However, she had not been able to get pregnant for the last few months.

“Edward already has two children. Do you still want to give him another one?” Chloe asked again when she saw that Candice did not answer.

“Let nature take its course.” Candice did not want to say too much about that matter.

To be precise, she did not want to say too much to Chloe.

“I think you do, right?” Chloe asked.

Candice did not deny it.

“Actually, I support it too. After all, even if Edward has two children, you don’t have one of your own. You’ll definitely want to have one of your own.” Chloe made it seem like she understood Candice very well.

“I want to have another child not because I want to have one of my own, but because I want to make the family happier. To me, George and Paige are also my children, and I will treat them equally.”

“You’re so magnanimous. If it were me, I might not be able to do it. I would definitely want a child of my own,” Chloe said seriously..
