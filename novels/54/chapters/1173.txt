1174 A Turn of Events

In the next life, they should not meet again.

She raised her gun and pointed it at Edward’s head.

“Jeanne,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered. At that moment, her finger that was on the trigger was trembling.

“Let me touch the baby in your stomach,” Edward said.

He wanted her to fulfill his last wish.

Jeanne’s throat moved.

While she was hesitating, she saw Edward throw the black gun that he had snatched from the guards on the ground.

In other words, he had thrown away all the weapons he had for self-defense.

Even if it was useless in the current situation, the people on the battlefield would never they would never throw away their weapons for self-defense even though it was useless.

The moment he threw them away, it would mean he surrendered.

“Alright.” Jeanne agreed.

She promised him that before he died, she would let him touch the unborn child in her stomach, so she walked in front of him.

When the two of them were only one step away from each other, Edward extended his hand.

The moment he reached out, Jeanne aimed her gun at his forehead, which meant she could end his life at any moment.

The next second, Jeanne felt a large, gentle hand on her lower abdomen.

During the time they were in the Sanders’s house, they had been sleeping on the same bed every night with his hand on her abdomen.

She even knew that when he thought she had fallen asleep, he would kiss her lower abdomen and tell the baby in her lower abdomen that was looking forward to her arrival.

However, he could no longer wait for her arrival.

Tears welled up in Jeanne’s eyes. In the end, it would still hurt because she had loved him deeply before.

She bit her lip and narrowed her eyes. Her finger moved slightly as she pulled the trigger.

Just as everything was about to happen, a panicked cry suddenly sounded in that quiet space. “Leader, be careful!”

The bodyguard closest to Warren used his body to stand in front of Warren, stopping the bullet from hitting Warren.

The sudden riot made the situation out of control.

At that moment, because Jeanne was distracted, Edward managed to grab hold of her gun with a backhand move, causing it to fall to the ground. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne, on the other hand, moved her body and broke free from Edward. Then, she squatted down and tried to pick up the gun.

However, Edward reacted quickly and kicked the gun away. At the same time, he quickly and accurately reached out to pull Jeanne to his side.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. The moment she saw that she was about to be subdued by him, she directly used her stomach to face his strong attack.

Edward immediately retracted his hand. In fact, his fingers even brushed past her lower abdomen.

If he did not manage to pull his hand back in time, that punch would have hit her directly in the lower abdomen. He could have easily hurt the baby in her stomach.

Edward’s expression turned ugly.

While he was stunned, Jeanne had already left his side and chased after Warren in the chaos.

After they left, gunshots rang out continuously at the scene.

In reality, they had secretly replaced half of the guards at the Sanders’ residence. If they had more time, they could have replaced the men inside!

After all, they had bribed more than half of the officials in the Sanders, and the gunshot just now came from the people they had bribed!

However, Warren managed to escape with the help of his bodyguard!

Seeing that the situation was not to his advantage, Warren immediately chose to leave the scene and leave the battlefield to the remaining people.

Jeanne caught up with Warren as fast as she could.

Warren’s expression was extremely ugly.

The people with him now were his personal bodyguards, who could not have been bribed, and besides Jeanne, Chester was also there. He was very smart to have left immediately.

Countless gunshots could be heard everywhere in the Sanders’ residence.

Warren quickly led the group to an inconspicuous house in the backyard. When the door opened, it revealed a secret passage.

As expected, Warren was prepared to escape. There was no way he would die in the Sanders’ residence.

He quickly entered, and Chester and Jeanne followed immediately.

“Jeanne, you stay here,” Warren ordered.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

Chester was smug.

“The assassins of the Hills are under your control. Use them to capture Edward and William! We can’t let them go. Once they leave, it’ll be difficult for us to catch them again!” Warren said quickly and anxiously, “After I leave, I will send troops to support you. Hold on for half an hour and stall them. As long as they don’t leave the Sanders’ residence, killing them will be a piece of cake!”

“Alright.” Jeanne did not hesitate or forget to remind him. “Father, be careful. If the Duncans can bribe the guards in the Sanders’ residence, they must have bribed a lot of people and officials. You have to be careful not to be schemed against by the Duncans.”

With that, Jeanne was about to head back.

“Jeanne,” Warren suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne turned around.

“Forget it, it’s too dangerous here. It’s better if you come with me. You can just order the assassins to kill Edward and William. It’s too risky for you to go yourself! I’ll be more at ease if you leave with me.” Warren suddenly went back on his word.

“Yes.” Jeanne did not refuse.

...

Of course, she would not be touched by Warren.

She knew very well that Warren was just not sure who was still his people in the Sanders and who was still useful to him. He allowed her to stay by his side because firstly, she was smart enough and he felt that she could give him advice. Secondly, even if he was plotted against by the Duncans, he could still use her as a hostage.

At least, Edward still could not bear to be so cruel to her!

Therefore, she still had value.
