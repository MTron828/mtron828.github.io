1365 The Wedding Night: From Now On, I Will Sleep In

Then, Edward carried her into their wedding room.

Even the huge room was filled with flowers for the occasion, which made it feel like a wedding, especially at that moment.

Edward carried her and placed her on the big bed. The luxurious wedding dress on her body seemed to blend in with the color of the bedsheets.

She could tell that Edward had put a lot of effort into certain details.

Even if he did not say anything, maybe he still felt bad. After all, today’s wedding ceremony was so boring that no woman would have any expectations for it.

After Edward placed her on the bed, she did not leave, nor did he let go of her body. Instead, he leaned over and kept very close to her.

As the ceremony was held in front of the entire country and so many ministers, there was no so-called intimacy. Throughout the entire wedding, they had limited opportunities to even hold hands. Not to mention, the groom would kiss the bride at a traditional wedding.

At that moment, Edward’s face was getting closer and closer…

Candice gripped the bedsheets tightly.

Finally, she started to get nervous. She was so nervous that the moment Edward approached her lips, she used her hand to cover her lips, and Edward’s kiss landed on the back of her hand.

It was a gentle tap, and their eyes met. For some reason, it was a little awkward.

Anyway, Candice was embarrassed. Tonight was supposed to be…

She did not know what she was being reserved about. At that moment, she even instinctively rejected his approach.

She said, “Can I take a shower first?”

The moment she said that, her face turned red again. However, she thought she saw a smile in Edward’s eyes.

He said, “Alright.”

His voice was a little hoarse.

When he got up from her body, Candice sat up from the bed. They had clearly agreed to take a shower, but the two of them seemed to be in a deadlock.

Candice thought about many things. She wondered if she should shower first or if he should shower first. After all, there was only one bathroom, and they could not shower together!

Candice’s face turned red.

Then, she heard Edward say, “You can shower first.”

“Alright.” Candice did not refuse.

She got off the bed and went straight to the bathroom.

“Wait a minute.” Edward suddenly pulled her back.

Candice turned around and looked at Edward. Her heart was beating wildly. After all, it was the bridal chamber, and any woman would be shy.

“I’ll help you take off your wedding dress,” Edward said.

Candice’s face was as red as a tomato.

“Taking your wedding dress off yourself is not easy,” Edward explained.

Candice braced herself and nodded silently.

As Edward started to unbutton her, Candice’s heart was beating really fast.

She stood in the middle of the room, surrounded by Edward’s aura. The powerful aura made her afraid to move for even a second, and her body seemed to be trembling a little.

“Are you afraid?” Edward asked her.

In the quiet room, Edward’s words scared Candice so badly that she jumped.

Edward’s smile widened at her reaction. His magnetic voice seemed to carry a hint of affection as he said, “Don’t be afraid.”

She was not afraid; she was just nervous. However, she bit her lip and did not answer.

By then, Edward had unbuttoned her wedding gown.

The white wedding gown slid off her shoulders, and when it was on her chest, Candice held onto it.

She said, “I can take it off myself.”

Edward smiled and looked at Candice who was holding onto her clothes and running away.

Then, when the bathroom door closed, the smile on his face gradually stiffened.

He actually was not as calm as he appeared to be. He had been suppressing his emotions, waiting for her… for more than three years to finally return to his side.

His throat moved slightly, and he walked out of their room. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Candice came out of the shower, she saw that Edward had already changed into a sapphire blue bathrobe and was sitting on the sofa in the room. He was looking at his phone, waiting for her.

In fact, she had showered as fast as she could.

She thought that since Edward still needed to take a shower, she did not want to take up too much time in the bathroom. Unexpectedly, he had already taken a shower in another room.

At that moment, Edward, who had taken a shower and taken off his luxurious suit, seemed much more approachable.

The bathrobe was casually tied around his body, revealing a large part of his chest…
