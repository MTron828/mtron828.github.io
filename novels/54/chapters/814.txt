She was really impressed.

Her parents did not like Michael at first and were so against her being with Michael, but now, they had changed sides.

“Uncle, auntie, don’t force Monica. She needs time to think it through.” Michael pretended to be a good person.

Monica suddenly thought that if she could one day expose what kind of person Michael was in front of the whole world like how Jeannie tore Eden apart, how great would that be!

With that, she said, “Dad, mom, I don’t want to be with Finn anymore.”

She would not disgust him anymore.

“And I won’t kill myself again.”

It was not worth it to commit suicide for someone like Michael.

“But I hope you won’t interfere in my marriage and relationship with Michael.” Monica made it clear.

“You child–” Gary wanted to scold Monica, but Ruby stopped him.

At that moment, Michael said, “I respect Monica’s choice. ”

Gary waved his hand. He looked a little disappointed but had no choice but to give up.

“You can go first,” Monica said coldly.

Michael nodded.

In front of outsiders, he was polite.

Now, she finally understood what people meant by birds of a feather flocked together.

She had always thought that Eden was a sc*mbag and that it was a pity that Michael and Eden were friends. Hence, she thought that Michael valued relationships, but now she knew that the two of them were the same type of people.

What a joke. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Back then, she had mocked Jeannie for meeting a bad person, but what right did she have to mock others?

She watched Michael leave after he politely bid her parents farewell.

Gary looked at Michael’s back before turning to his daughter and saying sincerely, “Michael treats you very well.”

No. One day, she would let everyone know what kind of person Michael was!

…

When Finn and Nox landed in South Hampshire in the evening, they went straight to M Underground Organization.

The GPS signal on Edward’s watch had appeared in that place, so they went to check out the situation there. From their deduction, they suspected that Jeanne’s disappearance was related to that person, and Edward had come here to save her.

However, when they arrived at M Underground Organization’s base, they were shocked by the tragic scene.

Corpses and blood were everywhere.

Finn and Nox led a group of people to investigate the place and look for Edward.

“Nox.” Among a pile of corpses, Finn suddenly called out to Nox.

Nox’s body froze.

They were moving separately, so when he heard Finn calling out to him from afar, he felt a chill run down his spine.

It was not because he was frightened by the scene filled with dead people. Rather, he was afraid that Finn had found Edward’s corpse.

Nevertheless, he hurried over.

Finn was squatting on the ground and looking at the corpse in front of him.

Nox calmed his heart while looking over.

Fortunately, it was not Edward.

“Fourth Master killed them,” Finn confirmed.

Only then did Nox notice how the person in front of him had died.

The gruesome sight was what Edward did when his body was at its limit.

It was not just one, but there were many casualties in front of them, and he had killed them all by himself.

“So he took the pill again.” Nox looked at the corpse in front of him and concluded.

Finn nodded. Then, he got up and asked, “Did you find anything on your side?”

“They’re all corpses, and none of them are alive.” Nox said, “It’s really pretty brutal.”

“It was the Hills,” Finn said bluntly.

“But I don’t see a single of the Hills’ corpses.”

“The Hills have their own rules. After an assassin dies, they will take the body away. On one hand, it’s to give them a final resting place after they die, and on the other, they don’t want anyone to find out the identity of their killer. Therefore, they will make sure to handle it carefully.”

“Yes, I know. I just didn’t expect Kingsley to raze such a large organization to the ground overnight. Not a single person was left alive.” Nox sighed.

That was his first time seeing the true power of the Hills, and as expected, it could not be underestimated.

“It seems that Jeanne has a special place in Kingsley’s heart. ”

“Yes.” Nox agreed.

“Judging from the current situation, M Underground Organization suffered a crushing defeat, and Kingsley must have rescued Jeanne. Since we haven’t found Fourth Master’s body, he should still be alive.” Finn analyzed, “After Fourth Master has taken the pill, it would usually take his body two days to recover, so he should still be in a coma right now. There are only two possibilities for his whereabouts. Either he left after the pill took effect and is now lying somewhere, or he was taken away by the Hills.”
