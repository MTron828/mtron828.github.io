Chapter 420: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

Nox sat in Edward’s office, listening to Fourth Master Swan flirting.

He really did not understand how a man could change so much before marriage and after.

Most importantly, it was all for a woman. It seemed like both the men beside him — Fourth Master Swan and Finn were like that.

Was he or those two the ones different?

In the office, Edward finally put down the phone.

The first thing he did after putting down the phone was to give Nox an order. “Tomorrow at 10 a.m., all the senior management are to come to the headquarters for a meeting. Everyone must be present and on time.”

“Got it,” Nox answered lazily.

“Why are you looking for me?” Edward asked.

“It’s nothing serious. I just wanted to tell you about the company’s firewall again.”

Edward glanced at Nox. “It’s not settled yet?”

“I should be asking you this.” Nox could not stay calm when he thought of that wretched child, George. “Haven’t you settled your son yet?!”

Edward did not answer.

There were times when his pride could not allow him to do it.

......

Nox told him straight, “I’m sure our own people can’t fix it! Moreover, I’ve also learned from Teddy George did this because you kidnapped his mother and left him at home without a care. Every injustice has its head, and every debt has its owner. You caused this matter, so you should go and resolve it. In any case, there’s nothing I can do!”

“Okay,” Edward replied. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Take it to heart,” Nox reminded.

Edward ignored him, and Nox did not say much either.

In any case, if the Swans were “stolen from”, it was also the Swans’ loss.

At most, he would just be beaten up by his grandfather.

He stood up and left Edward’s office. As he left, he said, “I’ll go and check on Finn.”

“How is he?” Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“His injuries are very serious, but fortunately, his organs are all intact. He can be discharged after recuperating for some time.”

“Okay.” Edward nodded.

However, her expression became very cold.

“The Sanders finally couldn’t hold it in anymore, huh?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

Edward looked at Nox. “We knew this day would come.”

“That’s true.” Nox nodded and instantly felt relieved.

That day would come sooner or later.

After that, he left the Swan Group and drove to the hospital.

Two days ago, he had also come to see Finn. Although Finn was seriously injured in the intensive care unit, he was able to recover.

Considering all his legs and arms were intact, he was really lucky.

Nox parked his car and walked to the intensive care unit.

Finn would be out of the intensive care unit today, so in the intensive care unit, doctors and nurses were helping him transfer wards.

Nox waited for a while as Finn was pushed out in a wheelchair by the doctors and nurses. After that, Nox followed them and walked into Finn’s high-class VIP ward.

Finn was lying on the hospital bed.

The injuries on his body still needed to heal, and he had to be observed in the hospital since he still could not take care of herself.

After the doctors and nurses settled Finn down, they left.

Nox sat next to him. “Do you feel better?”

“Much better,” Finn replied.

“When I went to save Fourth Master Swan, were you in danger?” Nox asked.

Finn nodded.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Nox frowned.

If Finn died, he would be racked with guilt!

“I didn’t expect it to be so serious.”

“Finn, Fourth Master Swan and I treat you as a brother,” Nox said to him with certainty.

He always felt that Finn treated them as strangers!

.

“I know.” Finn smiled.

“Even though you and I exist to protect Fourth Master Swan, and we must die before Fourth Master Swan, it doesn’t mean we can’t have feelings for each other.” Nox said seriously, “The three of us grew up together. I don’t want anyone of us to die.”

Finn looked at Nox.

Nox was the youngest among the three of them. He may look fearless, collected, and like he was having a good time, but he was actually very dependent on his relationships.

Ever since he was young, he had been very dependent on Finn and Fourth Master Swan.

Nox was actually a person who valued relationships very much, but he also lacked a sense of security.

It was probably because he had been trained too cruelly since he was young that he tend to worry about losing or getting something. That was why he purposely made himself seem cynical to hide the feelings in his heart.

Finn did not say anything more.

Men would never go deep about their feelings!

Therefore, he skipped the topic. “I suspect that mine and Fourth Master Swan’s accidents were all planned.”
