Chapter 1692: Shelly and Nox Back Together

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly stopped pushing Nox and did not dare to move. She just lay there, frozen on the floor. It took a long time for Nox to get up from Shelly’s body. Then, Shelly also stood up, but her eyes flickered to the side.

Nox looked down at his body and ran into the bathroom. He was stunned again.

“Shelly, I didn’t put on any clothes.”

Only then did he remember that he did not put on any clothes. Shelly, too, came back to her senses at that moment and hurriedly rummaged through her wardrobe.

After searching for a long time, she still could not find anything suitable for Nox. Hence, she walked to the bathroom door and said, “Why don’t you wait for me in the room? There’s a clothing store outside our neighborhood. It seems to be open. I’ll buy you a set of pajamas…”

Then, she saw Nox walking out in her bathrobe. It was very small, and it looked a little comical wrapped around him.

“Can’t I wear this?” Nox asked when he heard Shelly saying that she was going to buy him new clothes.

If he remembered correctly, the last time he came here, Benjamin was wearing that. Why could Benjamin wear it but not him?

Shelly could also sense that Nox was annoyed. However, since she was used to him losing his temper at any time, she said, “I’m afraid you won’t be comfortable wearing it. If you don’t think it’s a big deal, go ahead.”

Nox glanced at Shelly. Although he was not satisfied with her explanation, he did not want to argue with her.

He changed the topic and said, “I’m starving.”

“I’ve made chicken soup for you. Come out and eat,” Shelly said to him.

With that, Nox followed behind her and saw a bowl of chicken soup with pasta on the dining table. He was so hungry that there was a hole in his stomach. Hence, he picked up his spoon and ate in big mouthfuls.

Just as he started eating, he saw Shelly, who had been by his side, turn to leave. “Where are you going?” Nox grabbed her arm.

“What’s wrong? Doesn’t it taste good?” Shelly asked.

She saw Nox’s expression turn bad when he took a bite of the food.

“Where are you going? Can’t you accompany me for a while? It’s boring to eat alone!” Nox was unhappy.

Was Shelly unwilling to stay with him for a second longer? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Oh.” Shelly replied and explained, “I just thought I’d wash the clothes you changed out of. Then, I’ll sit with you.”

Nox, who was a little surprised by her reply, asked with uncertainty, “Are you going to wash my clothes for me?”

“Can your clothes be washed by hand? If not, I’ll take it to a specialized dry cleaner.”

“No.” Nox shook his head. “I didn’t expect you to treat me so nicely.”

Shelly lowered her head. Previously, her relationship with Nox was really too intense, and she did not have a good impression of Nox. Instead, she hated him to the core. However, she would definitely do what she said. Since he had brought Bella back, she would fulfill her promise.

“Eat.” Shelly did not answer Nox.

Nox did not ask any more questions either. He just ate quietly, with Shelly quietly accompanying him.

After he finished eating, he burped. It felt like he had been reborn after a disaster.

“Are you full?” Shelly asked him.

“I’m full.” Nox patted his stomach.

Shelly had made a lot of food for Nox because she knew he was hungry, but she did not expect him to finish it so quickly.

The moment she got up to wash the dishes, Nox quickly said, “Let me do it.” Shelly looked at him.

“Washing the dishes isn’t difficult. Let me do it.” Nox snatched the bowl and spoon from Shelly.

Seeing how enthusiastic Nox was, Shelly did not refuse. She watched as Nox bring the dishes into the kitchen and wash them in a hurry. He was so rough that the entire counter was covered in water.

After he was done, he did not clean the kitchen. He did not care about the other pots and pans in the kitchen. He did not wipe down the stove either. However, Shelly did not remind Nox.

After watching him put the dishes away, she said to Nox, “You can watch some

TV while I wash your clothes for you.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded as he walked to the sofa and asked casually, “Where’s Bella?”

“She’s asleep. It’s already past 9 p.m. Bella usually goes to bed at around 8 p.m.” “Is she okay?” Nox asked.

“She’s fine..” Shelly turned on the TV for Nox and asked, “What would you like to watch?”
