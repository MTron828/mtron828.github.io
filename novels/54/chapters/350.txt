Chapter 351: George’s Parent-Child Sports Day

Jeanne looked at him.

“Be good.”

“No.” Jeanne felt that Edward coaxed her like a child sometimes.

She admitted that she was younger than him but only by a few months.

Moreover, after their wedding night, she did not find Fourth Master Swan mysterious anymore. He was just someone who could be controlled by sexual desire…

Jeanne’s face turned a little red.

She did not want to think about it anymore.

In the end, she compromised. In Edward’s embrace, they got into the airport car and then boarded Edward’s private plane.

Then…

She still went to Fourth Master Swan’s so-called honeymoon destination, Balti Island.

At the same time, at the Swans’ Bamboo Garden, George opened his eyes at the sound of the alarm clock.

He had school that day.

Although he often absented himself from school and did not like going to school, his mother told him that in order to avoid trouble, he had to go to school.

......

He would do everything his mother told him to.

With that, he pulled back the quilt and was about to wash up when the door pushed open.

“Young Master.” Teddy stood at the door.

George frowned and looked at Teddy, watching as Teddy walked toward him.

After that, Teddy picked him up, and George’s face turned a little red.

“Let go of me.”

“Don’t be afraid, Young Master. I’ll help you with getting ready and washing up.”

George was speechless. He could get ready and wash up all by himself.

However, because he did not know how to refuse, he let Teddy carry him into the bathroom.

“Young Master, would you like to go to the toilet or brush your teeth first?”

“Toilet.”

Teddy then helped George to take off his pants.

George held tightly onto his pants. “I’ll do it myself.”

Teddy smiled. “Young Master, don’t be shy.”

“I’ll do it myself.” George insisted.

“Yes,” Teddy said respectfully.

Just like that, George took off his pants and went to the toilet while Teddy waited by the side.

After going to the toilet, Teddy gave George a toothbrush and wrung a hot towel for him.

Then, Teddy helped him change into his school uniform before bringing him out of the bathroom and downstairs for breakfast.

Teddy was right beside him, waiting on him.

George was not used to it. While drinking a cup of milk, he asked, “Is my mother up yet?”

“Madam has left with the Fourth Master.”

George’s hand that was holding the milk stiffened, and he looked straight at Teddy.

“They’ve gone on their honeymoon trip. Fourth Master said that they’ll be back in a week. During this time, only you and I will be in Bamboo Garden,” Teddy said.

He had been left behind again.

The unhappiness on George’s small face was obvious.

“Young Master, don’t worry. I’ll take good care of you and fulfill all of your requests–”

“Bring me a computer.”

Did Teddy hear wrongly?

“Computer,” George repeated. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Teddy hurriedly ran upstairs and came down with a computer in his arms.

George took the computer with a serious expression on his face.

Teddy watched in surprise as George skillfully navigated the computer.

After a long time, or perhaps a short while, George turned off the computer. As if nothing had happened, he continued to eat his breakfast.

Meanwhile, at Swan Enterprise’s headquarters, the IT maintenance department instantly exploded!

..

After breakfast, George went to school, with Teddy sending him off. However, Teddy was not driving but just accompanying him.

When the Fourth Master left, he told Teddy that he had to be attentive to the young master.

In that case, he had to be with him at all times.

George was never one to talk much, but because he was in a bad mood today, he had even less to say.

Soon, the car arrived at Angerburg Private Elementary School. Today, the school looked different than usual, with all the lights and festivities at the main entrance.

Teddy was a little surprised. He opened the car door for George and asked, “What’s happening in school today?”

George had not come to school for two days, so he did not know either. However, he observed and said, “Sports day.”

Teddy looked around and seemed to notice that many of the parents and children who came and went were wearing sportswear.

“Do parents need to participate?” Teddy raised his eyebrows.

“No need!”

If they were not going to participate, there was no need!

Teddy frowned. To him, it looked like their participation was necessary!

Then, he saw George turning around to return to the car with unhappiness written all over his face.

Startled, Teddy quickly followed.

“Young Master, aren’t you going to participate in the school’s sports day?”

“No.” Without parents, who would he participate with?

“How can that be? Young Master, you have to participate in the school sports meet, or you’ll be left out.” Teddy advised earnestly.

However, George was indifferent to his advice.

Teddy tried to persuade him for a long time, but George refused to listen to him at all. For a moment, he felt that George’s character was exactly the same as Fourth Master’s.
