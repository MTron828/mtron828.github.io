Chapter 542: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I don’t want you to see you sad.” Michael looked distressed.

Monica’s heart wavered. “As long as I can help you get back everything, then...”

Finn walked past and in front of them.

Suddenly, the words she was about to say were stuck in her throat.

She looked at Finn’s indifferent silhouette and could sense that the Finn from last night was completely different from Finn today. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She could feel Finn’s sadness last night, but today, she could not feel anything from him.

Hence, it only took one night for him to let go of everything, huh?

“Monica,” Michael called out to her because she was suddenly distracted.

Monica looked away. “Let’s go. There’s nothing to think about.”

With that, they walked to the office, where they went through the divorce procedures.

Michael, on the other hand, was waiting for them outside.

At that moment, a special staff member was helping them with the divorce procedures, so they did have to go through the standard divorce procedure. The staff member asked them respectfully, “Have you brought your divorce certificate, divorce documents, and your identification cards?”

“Here’s the divorce certificate.” Monica took out the divorce certificate. “Here’s my identification card too.”

Finn also silently took out his identification card and handed it to the staff member.

“Are the divorce documents here?” the staff member asked nicely.

“It hasn’t been signed yet. Can I trouble you to bring me a pen?” Monica took out the divorce documents.

Finn looked at it coldly.

Based on his understanding of Monica, she probably would not have thought of the divorce documents, so he prepared one last night.

However, it seemed like he was overthinking it.

There would always be people who would think of things she did not for her.

Monica placed the divorce documents in front of Finn and said, “We don’t have any children, so the custody rights won’t take place. As for assets, we don’t have too many asset disputes either. The house was a gift to you from my father, so I won’t take it, and I don’t want the savings you’ve accumulated over the last three years of our marriage. I can barely make ends meet with my salary, so I don’t have much to give you.”

Finn looked at the words written in black and white.

Monica said, “In short, I’m leaving the marriage with nothing.”

Without saying anything, Finn took the pen and skillfully signed his name.

Monica looked at him, and at that moment, she felt a little emotional. Even so, she eventually signed her name.

Once their names were signed, they handed the documents to the staff.

The staff took all the divorce documents and started to sort everything out. Since that was all they had to do, the divorce procedure was fast.

The staff said, “Mr. Ross told us specifically that the date on your divorce certificate should be one year ago, including your divorce documents. So, may I please have you date your signature on the divorce documents with the date today but last year? Same with the divorce certificates. Please double-check to see if it’s right.”

The staff handed the divorce documents to them and the divorce certificates for them to date their signature.

Soon, each of them was handed a divorce certificate.

Monica took a look at it, but Finn had already left with the divorce certificate.

She pursed her lips and struggled to follow behind Finn with her crutches.

Meanwhile, Michael was waiting for them outside. When he saw the divorce certificate in Monica’s hand, a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.

He quickly went over to support her. “Monica.”

“It’s all done,” Monica said. “Let’s go.”

“Okay.”

With that, the three of them walked out of the civil affairs bureau, one after another.

Michael supported Monica as they walked toward the car that had just arrived, whereas Finn had already hailed a taxi and sat in it.

Monica stared at Finn’s silhouette. He did not say anything the entire way through and silently completed all the divorce procedures with her instead.

Then, just like that, he left.

Michael’s gaze followed Finn’s direction. The coldness in his eyes was very obvious.

He knew very well that in Monica’s heart, Monica was still in love with Finn.

However, in Finn’s heart, Finn and Monica were already over.

Michael said kindly, “Monica, once I’ve settled everything, I will send you back to Finn’s side.”

Only then did Monica come back to her senses.
