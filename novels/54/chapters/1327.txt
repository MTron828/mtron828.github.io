1328 Chloe Slapped in the Face

At the dining table, they seemed to be eating harmoniously. Especially since Chloe was at the dining table, she could clearly feel that the originally tense atmosphere had become much more relaxed.

This was one of Chloe’s strengths. She was indeed more lively and cheerful than Candice since she was young. She was indeed very good at livening up the atmosphere.

However, it seemed that she had never thought of using her strengths to become more outstanding. Her so-called merits made her arrogant and condescending.

After dinner, Edward and the Nicholsons sat and chatted on the sofa in the living hall.

Chloe continued behaving eagerly even though Edward was giving her a lukewarm treatment. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Edward, have some dragon fruit.” Candice watched as the servant brought the fruit over. She quickly used a fruit fork to take a piece for Edward and placed it directly in his mouth.

Edward glanced at it. He said, “I don’t eat dragon fruit.”

“Then what do you like?”

“I don’t really like fruits.”

“You don’t eat fruits?” Chloe looked surprised. She pretended to lecture him, but in reality, she was acting cute. “Edward, you can’t not eat fruits. Fruits are rich in vitamins and are good for your body. Especially when you have so much work to do every day. It’s tiring. You have to eat fruits to nourish your body.”

Edward looked Chloe in the eye. She thought that her performance had finally attracted him. As expected, no man could be so indifferent to her proactive seduction. Edward was already different from other men to be able to last until now!

Other men would have curled their fingers and wheedled but Edward had made her spend so much time before she started to look at her.

To her, the more challenging a man was, the more interested she was. She could not help but be filled with fighting spirit. It was obvious that she was extremely confident that victory was in her grasp.

She hurriedly used a fruit fork to pick another piece of dragon fruit and placed it in front of Edward. She deliberately used an extremely seductive appearance, her red lips slightly opening as she said to Edward, “Ah…”

Edward glanced at her. His expression was cold.

“I just don’t like to eat the fruits you feed me.”

Chloe’s face stiffened. She was full of smiles just a second ago, but now she was so embarrassed that she felt a little ashamed. She probably did not expect Edward to say such a thing so bluntly. He was not giving her any face at all.

No man had ever trampled on her dignity without giving her face.

She clearly did not believe him. Her face was flushed red in extreme embarrassment. Not to mention Chloe herself, but Candice could feel Chloe’s embarrassment too.

Of course, it was not just Candice. The originally harmonious atmosphere was a little stiff because of Edward’s unfiltered words.

For a moment, no one seemed to know how to respond. The good atmosphere was obviously completely ruined.

Edward continued calmly, “Just leave the matter of feeding me fruits to Candice.”

Not only did he not give Chloe a way out, but he was also clearly telling her not to push her luck.

Claire had been around for so many years; whether it was in politics or business, she could speak well and could also read people’s expressions. After being stunned for a few seconds, she quickly reacted and called out to Candice, “Candice, look at you. You’re not proactive at all. Instead, you let your sister do these things. How inappropriate. In the future, as Edward’s virtuous wife, you have to think more about Edward and take care of him, understand? Don’t act like how you are at home. We parents have prepared everything for you but you have to learn to take good care of Edward in the future, alright?”

Her words were phrased skillfully in diffusing Chloe’s awkwardness and catering to Edward.

Claire was quite smart. Chloe did not seem to have learned this.

Ever since she was young, she probably relied on the fact that her mother liked her and knew how to wheedle around and make her elders happy. She disdained to work hard and became more and more self-righteous, thinking that she could handle everything.

Today was probably the first time he had been slapped in the face like this. Even if Claire spoke up for her, she was still extremely embarrassed.

Candice, meanwhile, could care less about Chloe’s feelings.
