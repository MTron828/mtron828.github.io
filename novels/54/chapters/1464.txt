Chapter 1465: Nox and Shelly’s Past

When Zoe took the initiative to stick her tongue in, the scene of him going crazy with Shelly last night popped up in Nox’s mind.

After waking up, he started to piece it together bit by bit and finally figured out the whole thing. However, he could not remember how Shelly felt at that time.

All he knew was that last night… he went really crazy, and it had never happened before. What drug did Shelly drug him with?

“Nox?” Zoe called out to him.

At that moment, her lips had left his, and Nox came back to his senses.

“What are you thinking about?” Zoe was a little unhappy.

In the past, when she took the initiative to kiss Nox, Nox would respond enthusiastically. Yet today, he was not reacting to her at all. Where was his mind wandering to?

Were her kissing skills that bad?! The men who had slept with her said she was very skilled and that her kiss made them feel good.

Under normal circumstances, she would not take the initiative to cater to others, but when she kissed Nox just now, she had used all her skills.

Her goal was to let Nox know that kissing her was the best and that he did not have to be hung up on other women.

When she thought about how Nox kissed the waitress so hard last night that the girl almost suffocated or how he rubbed the waiter into his body… She was the one who had planned it, but she was so jealous that she could go crazy.

“I drank too much last night, so my thoughts are scattered,” Nox explained reluctantly.

It was also because his mind was filled with Shelly that he felt a little annoyed.

“In that case, don’t go to work. Rest at home, and I’ll accompany you.”

“I’ll be fine after I go out and get some fresh air.” Nox refused.

Zoe still had something to say, but Nox immediately walked out, not wanting to waste any more time.

Zoe stared at Nox’s back and stomped her feet angrily. She would never let Nox escape from her grasp!

At night, at the nightclub, Shelly changed into her work clothes and went to work.

She was actually considering whether she should resign from that job. Not to mention what she experienced yesterday, but the job did take up a lot of her time and she felt sorry for Bella.

Today, she accompanied Bella to the hospital for a checkup. Bella’s dependence on her made her feel bad. She really was spending too little time with Bella.

While she was deep in her thoughts, the supervisor walked over. “Shelly, room 999.”

“Aren’t I serving rooms 666 to 888 today?” Shelly remembered that was the schedule.

“Room 999 needs someone. Just go over, and I’ll sort out the rest.”

Shelly did not say anything else. In any case, the leader had the final say. With that, she went to room 999.

Thinking that there would be a lot of people in the room, she pushed open the door of the private room but only saw Nox sitting alone inside with his legs crossed. The lights were bright, and he was sitting like a boss.

Shelly turned around and left. In an instant, she could tell that Nox had specially come to look for her, and he was definitely up to no good. He definitely would not pity her for what happened last night either, so there was no need for her to stay and make herself suffer.

“Shelly, if you dare to leave, don’t even think about working here.” Nox threatened her. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Shelly gritted her teeth.

She knew Nox would not let her off easily. However, since she could not make up her mind, Nox could help her with making the decision.

“Shelly!” Seeing that Shelly was not threatened by him, Nox was so angry that he was about to explode.

He had wanted to embarrass Shelly today, but he did not expect to be humiliated by her again. He suddenly stood up from the sofa, grabbed Shelly’s arm at an astonishing speed, and rudely brought her into the private room.

Shelly did not resist. After what happened last night, she knew very well that she could not resist Nox’s brute force, so why should she get herself hurt?

At this moment, Nox’s grip on her arm was really strong, and she was in pain. However, Nox was so angry that he did not notice his strength at all.

At the thought of Shelly giving him a hard time, he really wanted to strangle her. However, when he grabbed Shelly’s arm, he felt a little disgusted.

When had Shelly become so thin?

In his memory, Shelly was still that chubby woman. Yet now, in order to look good, she was willing to do anything..
