Chapter 654: News Flash: Next Time, I Will Kill You!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In fact, he had expected that after Monica chose to be with Michael, Michael would do a lot of things to keep Monica by his side. Discrediting him and ruining his reputation was one of them. Michael was very smart, and by doing so, he could make Finn hate Monica even more and widen Finn’s distance from Monica. It was true that Michael had destroyed their relationship.

He could even guess what Michael would do next.

Michael would be a good person.

In Michael’s relationship with Monica, he would be a good person who would comfort Monica and move her.

Slowly, Monica’s heart would waver, and she would choose to be with Michael.

That was the outcome of the three of them.

Even if the person Monica loved was him, even if Monica was just helping Michael, Monica would be with Michael in the end. From the moment she chose Michael, that was the destined outcome.

It was destined that no matter who Monica loved, the person she trusted would always be Michael!

He… was not worthy of her trust, and she was also not worth him having feelings for her!

At least, that was the case from now on!

...

When Jeanne returned to the Lawrence family’s manor, Jenifer and Joshua, as well as Jasmine and Eden, were waiting for her in the hall.

A man in a suit was standing beside them. He was probably a lawyer who had come to divide the assets for them.

Jonathan had just been buried, and Alexander was dead.

There was no funeral for Alexander. Even when the police notified the family, they only informed them to confirm the body before they cremated and buried him in the ground.

After all, Alexander committed suicide because he was afraid of his crimes. That kind of person was not worthy of anyone mourning for him.

If one were to compare, the father and son had the same evil heart, but Jonathan’s fate was slightly better.

Jeanne felt that she had thought too far ahead.

It was not surprising that the Lawrences could not wait to split up the assets as soon as Jonathan and Alexander’s bodies were buried.

She walked over.

Jenifer looked at Jeanne coldly, as if she did not want to have much to do with her. Then, Jenifer said to the lawyer, “Mr. Walter, please divide up my father-in-law’s inheritance.”

“Yes.” Mr. Walter appeared to be very respectful.

He walked forward and took out a document.

He said, “According to Harken’s inheritance law, the assets will be inherited by the first successor. If the first successor is not around, the second successor will inherit it. Mr. Jonathan’s inheritance meets the second condition, which is that as Jonathan’s daughter-in-law who has fulfilled her obligation to provide for him and Jonathan’s grandchildren, Jenifer, Jeanne, Jasmine, and Joshua are to inherit the inheritance equally. Currently, the assets under Mr. Jonathan’s name include 52 percent of Lawrence Enterprise’s shares, and he holds marketable securities...”

Everyone was listening attentively to all of Jonathan’s assets.

The hall was very quiet.

“The above is Mr. Jonathan’s inheritance distribution plan. If there are any objections, you can file a lawsuit with the court. The court will conduct a new trial based on the contents of the lawsuit. If there are no objections, this is the letter of inheritance. Everyone has one. Once it’s signed and confirmed, the inheritance distribution will take effect,” Mr. Walter said seriously.

Jeanne looked at her copy.

Everyone was also looking at their copy.

Actually, Jenifer had already read the letter of inheritance. She was not making any comments now because she was waiting for Jeanne to see if that woman would play any tricks.

However, Jeanne picked up her pen, directly signed her name, and said, “I have no objections.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

To be honest, Jonathan’s inheritance distribution was extremely fair.

Jeanne also knew very well that Jenifer was afraid she would cause a ruckus. If it were not fair, and she made a fuss and had the media expose it, they would not have a good reputation, especially at this critical moment. Since she was now the only elder in the Lawrences, people would talk about it if it were not fair. Therefore, Jenifer had to distribute it fairly, and the decision was final.

“I don’t either,” Joshua said.

Jenifer also said gratefully to Mr. Walter, “The distribution is very fair.”

Mr. Walter, the lawyer, nodded.

Once everyone had signed the papers, Jeanne took her portion of the inheritance and left.

After all, there was no need to put on an act with that family anymore. When she left, Jenifer did not stop her either.

With that, she walked out of the Lawrence family’s manor courtyard.

“Jeanne,” Eden called out to her from behind.

Jeanne stopped in her tracks and turned around to see Eden walking over with big strides. Jasmine was not by his side.

Jeanne looked at him. “What’s the matter?”

“Is my Fourth Uncle not back yet?”

“What do you want to say?” Jeanne was obviously against Eden.

Eden’s tone was a little cold. “I’m just concerned about you.”

“You think I believe you?”

“That’s true.” Eden stopped pretending. “I’m just curious. So many things have happened in your life, yet my fourth uncle can be so indifferent to you. It turns out your relationship with him is nothing more than that.”

“Even if our relationship is nothing more than that, it has nothing to do with you.” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly. “After all, never in my life will I be together with you again.”

Eden’s expression changed abruptly, and he glared fiercely at Jeanne. “Do you think I still want to be with you?”

Jeanne sneered as she looked at Eden with disdain and was too lazy to deal with him.

Eden’s expression was ugly.

One day, he would make that woman regret what she had done to him!
