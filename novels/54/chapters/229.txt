Chapter 230: Embarrass Jenifer

Jenifer’s eyes were red, and she cried instantly. “Alex, haven’t I done enough for this family? What do you want me to do? I’ve only been provoked by Jeanne a few times today, and you’re scolding me like this—”

“Enough!” Alexander looked coldly at Jenifer, “Don’t cry in front of me in the future. It’s annoying to look at you! Think carefully about how to let Joshua and Jasmine develop! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being merciless toward you! Get out, I don’t want to see you!”

Just like that, Jenifer was chased out of the room by Alexander.

At that time, Jeanne happened to come out of her room.

Jeanne just looked at Jenifer’s red eyes and aggrieved look.

“What’s the matter? Were you chased out by my dad?” Jeanne sneered.

Jenifer instantly gathered her emotions and said fiercely to Jeanne, “Don’t be complacent!”

“I’m not. I want you to get a good taste of the feeling of being despised by others.” The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled up. “Just like my mother did back then.”

Jenifer’s expression turned cold.

“Do you think that you’ll end up like my mother one day?!” Jeanne suddenly asked her in a sinister and terrifying manner.

Jenifer’s hair stood on end. At that moment, when she looked at Jeanne, she felt a wave of fear.

Jeanne smiled coldly.

That smile was bloody.

Jeanne turned around and walked away from Jenifer.

Jenifer was unable to regain her senses for a long time.

After Jeanne left, she felt that she was drenched in a cold sweat.

No.

Jeanne’s return this time was definitely not simple.

She definitely had not come back to prove her existence in the Lawrences. She had come back to take revenge!

Jenifer even felt that Jeanne seemed to know about her mother’s accident back then…

A chill ran down her spine.

She could not let Jeanne continue to develop like this.

Otherwise, she would surely be avenged by Jeanne... miserably!

After taking the shares of the Lawrences, she still had to keep her promise this time.

Otherwise, it would not be easy to negotiate with the Lawrences next time.

She went through the formal procedures and met with Adrian.

The moment Adrian saw Jeanne, he was immediately agitated.

He seemed to have thought it through, so he looked at her and quickly said, “I admit it—I admit that there’s no enmity between us, so there’s no reason for me to frame you. It was Joshua who threatened me and made me frame you. “The next time I go to court, I’ll accuse Joshua. I have evidence that he instructed me—I have a recording. As long as you help me put in a good word in court, I’ll let Joshua be brought to justice. After that, the Lawrence Enterprise will be yours.”

If Joshua was not a Lawrence, he would probably have died 10,000 times.

Jeanne said, “Mr. Zimmer, I came here to tell you not to frame others anymore. When you go to court, you should properly admit your guilt. If your attitude is a little better, perhaps the judge will give you a lighter sentence.”

“What do you mean?” Adrian looked at Jeanne in disbelief. “Don’t you want to pursue the matter? Don’t you want Joshua to go to jail so that the Lawrence Enterprise will be yours in the future?!”

Joshua had never been a threat to Jeanne to take down the Lawrence Enterprise.

Of course, she did not have to explain it to Adrian. She took out a document and handed it to Adrian.

Adrian took a look, and his expression changed.

Jeanne said, “If it happened once, it’ll happen many times. I don’t believe that this is your first time doing a dual contract in the Lawrence Enterprise, so I did some in-depth investigation and found a lot of strange things. Mr. Zimmer, speak properly during the court session. Don’t make the incriminating evidence worse!”

Adrian’s expression was dark and cold.

“That’s all I have to say. Mr. Zimmer. Take care of yourself.”

Jeanne left immediately.

This matter ended here.

She still had many things to do…

The sooner she was done here, the sooner she could leave!
