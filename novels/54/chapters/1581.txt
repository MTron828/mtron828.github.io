Shelly looked at Zoe, and for a second, she failed to react. Was that woman mentally ill? Her attitude and expression had changed so fast that it was scary.

The next second, she felt someone pushing her from behind, and she almost fell to the ground.

She steadied herself and saw Nox holding Zoe in his arms. His expression was extremely ugly as he said to her, “Shelly, what did you say to Zoe?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

What could she say? It was all Zoe’s fault! However, she did not think she should expose Zoe. After all, she was a soft-hearted person.

Moreover, deep in her heart, she really hoped they could be together and that Zoe would cheat on Nox for the rest of her life. It felt good just thinking about it.

“Nox, don’t be angry. Shelly didn’t say anything to me, so don’t lose your temper.” Zoe’s face was delicate and delicate.

Shelly looked at them and chuckled. That was right. Nox should be with that kind of b*tch, who was a perfect match for him.

At that thought, she turned to leave. She did not think she had to explain or embarrass herself in front of them.

That was when she heard Zoe say, “Shelly said you guys slept together at the nightclub and told me… not to be too smug.”

Before she could finish her sentence, tears streamed down her face.

Shelly pursed her lips. Now, she knew why Nox was not Zoe’s match. It was because Zoe’s acting skills were amazing.

She saw Nox’s expression darken. “Shelly, can you be any more despicable? Do you want to test my limits again? Do you really think that you can affect my relationship with Zoe just because you said something like that? Let me tell you, there’s no way! I’ve told Zoe about what happened that night!”

“Oh, really?” Shelly was unmoved, not denying what Zoe said about her. In any case, in Nox’s heart, she was not a good person either.

Besides, she wanted them to be together, and if she could achieve her goal, it did not matter whether she was wrongly accused. After all, she did not care what impression Nox had of her.

“Shelly, do you know what that night of us sleeping together was to me?” Nox was furious.

He probably did not expect Shelly to have become such a despicable woman and tell Zoe that.

“It was as if I slept with a prostitute.” Nox enunciated each word.

Shelly pursed her lips. It seemed to her that her feelings for the Winters would eventually disappear because of Nox.

She said, “I didn’t know you even paid for prostitutes.”

Nox looked at Shelly coldly. He did not expect Shelly to be so calm! Did she have any sense of shame at all?

“Since I can’t drive a wedge between the two of you, and I don’t seem to fit in with you, I’ll take my leave first,” Shelly said politely, just like how she treated the guests in the restaurant.

Nox looked at Shelly and realized he could not see through that woman. She said she liked him and wanted to marry him, but her actions seemed like she was deliberately avoiding him.

He did not believe a word she said about not liking him or having any expectations for him. When he thought of what Shelly had done in order to marry him, he decided that it was impossible for her to let go of him.

“Nox,” Zoe called out to him.

It was because Nox was watching Shelly leave, and she was upset about it.

Nox came back to his senses and quickly said, “Don’t take Shelly’s words to heart. She doesn’t want us to have a good life because she can’t have me. Don’t worry, I’ll never like Shelly.”

“Yes, I believe you.” Zoe smiled sweetly, showing her great love and tolerance for Nox.

Nox was also touched by Zoe. He felt that, compared to Zoe, Shelly was worthless.

With that, the two of them returned to the private room.

In the private room, parents from both sides were still discussing the wedding when Mrs. Winter suddenly asked, “Where’s Shelly? Why isn’t she serving us anymore?”

Nox looked up at the waitress who was serving them and said, “1 told her not to.”

“Nox, it’s been so many years. Why are you still brooding over it? No matter what, Shelly grew up with our family. Even if you don’t have feelings for her, you should treat her like a sister,” Mrs. Winter scolded..
