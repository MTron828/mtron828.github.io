Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s your Mother’s birthday! I thought you had a conscience to realize and called me to talk about your mother!” Gary was about to explode from anger.

What?

Monica was dumbstruck.

She had forgotten that today was her mother’s birthday. To be exact, she had never taken serious note of it.

Gary was so infuriated, to say the least. “Come home for dinner tonight and spend time with your mother. She has been so worried about you lately!”

“Okay,” Monica agreed.

Then, Gary abruptly hung up the phone.

Monica looked at the phone, wondering why the old man was so angry. He did not even know how to control himself, considering his heart was weak.

She adjusted her emotions and dialed Michael’s number. “Michael, I just told my father about your cousin, and… there’s nothing I can do.”

“Okay, I got it. I’ll inform my mom and tell her to reject them.”

“I’m sorry.”

“Silly, you’re helping me. Why are you apologizing?”

Monica acknowledged him.

“Oh, right. My mom is making dinner today, and she said she would get the maid to send you a serving. Don’t think too much about it. It’s just a token of my mom’s appreciation for your help. When the maid sends it over, you can go down to pick it up. You don’t have to feel sorry.”

“I’m going back to my parents’ house soon. It’s my mom’s birthday today, so...” Monica was a little embarrassed.

“Is it your mom’s birthday?”

“Yeah, I forgot, and my dad scolded me so badly.”

Michael chuckled. “Well, you should be.”

“That’s why I need to go home and apologize. I appreciate your mom’s thoughts. Besides, I rarely eat in. I always order takeout, so tell your mom not to prepare anything for me in the future.”

“Okay, I’ll let her know. You should hurry back.”

“Bye-bye.”

“Bye-bye.”

Monica hung up the phone and was lost in her thoughts as she looked at it.

Michael was always considerate of her and would never make things difficult for her. However, why was everyone doubtful of him?

Meanwhile, Michael’s expression changed the moment he hung up the phone.

It seemed it was not an easy task to get his people into Cardellini Enterprise. However, without having access to Cardellini Enterprise, it would be difficult for him to obtain their research and development. Then, he would not be able to replicate another Cardellini Enterprise in the pharmaceutical industry.

With that, he made another call. “Mom.”

“Don’t rush me. The maid is already making dinner. Once it’s done, I’ll have her send it to Monica. I don’t even know why you’re fawning over Monica so much. She really doesn’t carry herself like a high-class lady. How is she worthy of you? If it was not for the president, I think you’re losing out a lot by being with Monica–”

“Mom,” Michael interrupted her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes, yes, yes. I won’t say anymore.”

“I’m just letting you know that you don’t have to go through with dinner because Monica is going back to her parents’ house today. By the way, I’ll think of a way to bring Monica over tonight. Cooperate with me and put on a show.”

“What show?”

Michael told her about his plan and exhorted, “Don’t mess up. The president is waiting for my results.”

“All the president does is give you the job and waits to reap the benefits from you. He didn’t even give you any benefits. He has so many daughters, yet he doesn’t even want to marry one of them to you,” Reese said unhappily. She was really dissatisfied with Monica as a “daughter-in-law”.

“There’s no way I can marry the Sanders’ daughter.”

“I don’t know what you see in Monica.”

“It’s not because of her. The Sanders won’t allow us, the Rosses, to have too much power. If I marry his daughter, he won’t promote me so brazenly because he’ll be afraid I’ll stir up trouble and threaten the Sanders’ political power. However, if I don’t marry his daughter and show that I like Monica, he will think I don’t have a great ambition for power and put down his guard against me. Only then will he let me develop my career.”

“This president is a sinister and cunning person,” Reese cursed. “He wants to use you, but he’s afraid you’ll have too much power. He’s taking all the good things from you!”

“That’s the food chain, and it’s the top of the food chain that enjoys such power.”

“I just don’t want you to be together with Monica. What kind of woman is Monica? Any of the Sanders’ daughters is a hundred times better than Monica.”

“Monica is good too. Mom, that’s enough.” Michael was clearly unhappy with Reese’s evaluation of Monica.
