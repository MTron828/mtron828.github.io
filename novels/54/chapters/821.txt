Chapter 822: Edward, My Abilities Are Limited. I Can’t Save You.

At that point, Edward probably would not, for real, reveal that person.

She just looked at Edward.

Even though he was so weak that he might faint, he still spoke to her in a very calm and clear voice. “You have your own stand. If you kill me, that’s what you had to do, and if you stand in my way one day, I will kill you too.”

‘Are you really going to kill me?’ Jeanne thought to herself as she looked at Edward.

If that day ever came, would he really kill her?

If he would, he would not have married her knowing that she had ulterior motives for getting close to him.

That meant he was lying to her. He just did not want her to feel guilty about his death.

She pursed her lips tightly and stared at him. She said, “Can you give up on the Duncans?”

She wanted him to give up because if he did, Kingsley would gladly cooperate with him.

Edward was probably the most capable person Kingsley had seen in all his years, and no one would say no to capable people.

“Can you ask Kingsley to give up on the Sanders?” Edward retorted.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

That was right. Kingsley had always been loyal, so how could he give up just like that?

She felt that what she just said was ridiculous.

Edward had made it very clear that he was born for that person and to help that person regain power.

Yet now, she selfishly wished he would give up on the Duncaks for the sake of love and family.

She said, “The leader of the Duncans was killed by the Hills.”

Edward looked at her.

“If the Duncans return, the Hills will definitely be destroyed.”

Edward did not refute her.

“Including me and Kingsley, we will all die at the hands of the Duncans.”

Edward seemed to know that point very well.

“We have no other choice.” Jeanne enunciated her words clearly as she explained the reason why they could not betray the Sanders.

They had no other choice.

If they did not form an alliance with the Sanders, once the Duncans returned to politics, the first family that the Duncans would destroy would be the Hills.

No one would allow the person who killed their family to remain in this world. No one would allow such a threat to stay in this world, especially when it came to politics.

Between her and Edward, one of them had to compromise. If not, one of them would die, or both of them would die. However, it was absolutely impossible for both of them to live.

Despite that, Jeanne could not compromise. Once she compromised, she would not even have the right to choose to live.

That was because no matter whether the Duncans or the Sanders won in the end, they would die.

From the Duncans’ perspective, it was imperative to take revenge, whereas to the Sanders, changing sides midway would not be tolerated.

The Hills were in a political struggle, and they had no choice.

However, Edward had. He could choose to give up on helping the Duncans rise to power again.

The Duncans were now dependent on the Swans anyway. If he gave up, the Duncans would have no power to resist. Then, the Sanders would still keep their political power, and the Swans would still have their economic status; they could both return to their original state.

However, some missions could not be refused.

Since young, Edward had been instilled with too many thoughts that he needed to help the Duncans and that life belonged to the Duncans.

As such, he would not give up on the Duncans because of Jeanne.

That was politics.

In the face of the so-called political power and national affairs, love was really worthless.

Jeanne looked at the quiet Edward.

It turned out he would rather die than reveal who that person was

She said, “Edward, my abilities are limited. I can’t save you.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She did not want him to die, but she could not save him.

Only he could save himself.

“You don’t need to,” he answered.

He was the only one who could save himself, but he gave up.

With that, Jeanne got up from the ground and left his side. Since he did not need her to save him, that was it.

Their relationship would come to an end sooner or later.

She said, “After you die, I’ll get someone to bring George back.”

“Alright.” Edward nodded.

After that, Jeanne walked out of the basement.

The assassin was very respectful to her.

Jeanne said, “Change his clothes for him.”

“Yes.”

This was the only thing she could do for him.
