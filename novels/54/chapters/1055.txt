1056 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

Ruby’s eyes were red. “Finn, thank you.”

“It’s my job, aunty,” Finn spoke to Ruby in a gentle tone.

Ruby could not say anything else or hold back her tears.

Finn seemed to look up at Monica, even though it was just a quick glance.

Soon, Gary was pushed out. His face was pale and he had lost a lot of weight because he had been sleeping.

He was pushed into the intensive care unit again.

Perhaps it was because she was too afraid, but Ruby stayed outside the intensive care unit and refused to leave.

It gave Ron and Sarah no choice but to stay with her.

Meanwhile, Monica was called into Finn’s office.

He probably wanted to give her an explanation about her father’s situation or perhaps tell her that her father’s condition had worsened.

Anyhow, Monica had mentally prepared herself.

She sat in front of Finn and faced him.

Finn said, “About your father’s heart suddenly going into shock, it was just an accident that could not be explained by medicine. His body hasn’t shown any signs of rejection, and that heart is a good match for him. When he was resuscitated, and his heart rate went back to normal, there were no other complications. If he can wake up, he’ll be able to live a normal life.”

“Will he wake up?” Monica asked.

Would he wake up after so long?

She was about to give up.

Could he really wake up?

Considering that his heart had recovered from the sudden cardiogenic shock, did it mean that a miracle might happen?

“I’m contacting an international medical team to come to the hospital for a consultation. We’ll do our best to treat your father.”

Finn was still not giving her a definite answer.

Of course, she knew that her father would not wake up so easily, so she should not hold on to too much hope.

She said, “Alright, I got it. Thank you, Dr. Jones.”

‘Thank you, Dr. Jones.’

Finn just stared at Monica, who was unusually calm. She was so calm that it seemed abnormal.

As for addressing him as Dr. Jones, he could feel that Monica had given up completely.

It definitely was not on purpose. Instead, she had just blurted it out instinctively.

Without looking at Monica’s back, he lowered his head and was about to record Gary’s case when he suddenly thought of something. “Monica.”

Seeing that Monica did not answer him, Finn frowned. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica was walking out of the door as if she did not hear him.

“Monica,” Finn called out to her again.

However, she still acted as if she did not hear him.

As such, Finn stood up from his office chair and quickly grabbed Monica’s arm.

The sudden tug made Monica fall into his arms unsteadily, but at the same time, it seemed like she was trying her best to balance herself.

In the end, she stabilized herself and did not have any physical contact with Finn at all.

However, because of Finn’s tug, she tried her best to cover the wound on her forehead with her hair. In the end, her hair moved, and it was exposed.

Finn’s eyes were filled with anger, and he clearly paused for a moment.

He had not noticed the wound on Monica’s forehead. In fact, no one seemed to have noticed it.

The wound was not superficial, and he could even see some hideous-looking hypodermis layer.

“What’s wrong?” Finn asked her.

It did not look like she had fallen on her own.

“It’s nothing.” Monica pushed Finn away.

Finn tightened his grip on her.

Only at that moment did he realize that the arm he was holding was frighteningly thin. He had a feeling that if he had used a little more strength, he would have broken her arm.

“Monica, what exactly happened to you tonight?” Finn asked her.

It was obvious that something was wrong with Monica tonight.

She had changed a lot, but tonight’s change was even more abnormal than usual.

“I told you, it’s nothing. Dr. Jones, please let go of me. I’m tired, and I want to sleep.” Monica looked at him calmly.

Finn was a little angry, but he held it in. He, too, would make it so that no one could see his emotions.

He said, “I’ll treat it for you.”

If she did not want to tell him what was wrong, so be it. He had no obligation to know what Monica had experienced.

However, as a doctor, it was his responsibility to save the dying and heal the injured.

“No, thanks.”

“The wound is very deep. It can get very serious if it’s infected.”

“No need.” Monica still refused.

...

At that moment, she even forcefully pushed Finn’s hand away.
