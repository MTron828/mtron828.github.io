1318 Finn Is Jealous

Monica turned around and saw a figure standing at the entrance of the neighborhood under the dim yellow night light.

When she saw Finn, she was caught off guard.

Was he not on a business trip for a week?!

Oh right, he mentioned a change in itinerary.

She thought the change in schedule meant that he would be back a day or two earlier, but she did not expect it to be a week earlier.

In other words, he had left yesterday and returned today. This change was really unexpected.

What surprised her even more was that Finn was waiting for her at the entrance of the residential area.

Was he waiting for her?!

She was not sure either. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She walked over to Finn and asked, “When did you come back?”

Finn seemed to be looking behind her.

Monica turned around and looked at Brandon’s departing figure.

She said, “Brandon, the person I told you about this morning.”

Finn turned around and looked at Monica. “Didn’t you come home last night?”

So was this a spot check?!

It was quite rare.

Monica smiled. “That’s right. I took Candice to the nightclub last night and Edward carried Candice away. The moment I was about to leave, I met Brandon and a few friends drinking at the nightclub. After drinking with them for a while, Brandon got drunk, so I sent him to the hotel. Then, he vomited all over me. I could only make do at the hotel for the night.”

“That’s all?”

“What else could I do?” Monica chuckled.

“Are you together with him again today?” Finn asked.

“His parents invited my parents for dinner, so we had a meal together at their house,” Monica answered patiently.

She did not want there to be any conflict between them. She knew very well that no matter what, a man would be very possessive.

What she could not accept the most was being cuckolded.

“Here, this is a small box of cookies his mother gave me,” Monica explained to Finn as she waved the cookie box in her hand.

“Did you grow up together?” Finn continued to ask.

“Not really. When Brandon was seven or eight years old, he went overseas with his parents and only came back now. So, he can only be considered a childhood playmate.” Monica looked at Finn, “Are you jealous?”

“No,” Finn denied.

Monica guessed so too.

“I was just asking.”

Monica smiled faintly.

It might be true that he was not jealous, but it might not be true for him to be asking casually; Finn would not be so free.

It was usually difficult to talk to him, let alone him suddenly asking about other people’s matters.

It could only be because he did not trust her.

Of course, she did not mind. Anyone would react this way in this situation. She would too.

If this was Finn and any other woman, Monica might have let her imagination run wild.

That was why she explained her situation to him.

She even told him, “Finn, I won’t do anything to betray you while we are still dating. Don’t worry.”

Finn’s eyes widened. He looked at Monica with a hint of sarcasm.

He said, “I didn’t mean that.”

“I’m just telling you what kind of person I am,” Monica said bluntly.

He seemed to feel that it was a little… difficult to communicate between them.

Since when did they start to talk less and less? The things they talked about became more and more superficial. They had never interacted deeply once. Even at this time, it was as if the meaning that they wanted to express to each other would be misunderstood by the other party.

Finn wanted to say something else.

Monica said, “It’s getting late. You must be tired too. Let’s go home.”

Without waiting for Finn’s reply, Monica walked straight into the residential area.

Finn looked at her back. He was suddenly in a daze.

Nox said that no couple was like them.

He had never thought much of it before. He felt that every couple had a different way of interacting with each other. He and Monica also had their own way of communication and did not need to follow the others’ footsteps.

It was only now that he truly felt that Monica had distanced herself from him. Originally, he thought that it was how Monica carried herself in a mature way.

She was beginning to feel less dependent on others. She was beginning to know how to control her feelings. That was why she was showing her independence. It had nothing to do with their relationship.

It was just that a person’s personality and expression had changed, and their feelings were still the same.
