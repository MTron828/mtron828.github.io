Chapter 71: Are You So Fond of Stealing One’s Partner?!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne was taken away by Fourth Master Swan.

Monica felt as if she was sitting on pins and needles.

Would Jeanne take a knife and slash her the next day when she woke up?!

No.

Monica could not hold it in anymore.

She said, “This matter has to be consensual. I can’t let my sister lose her innocence just like that.”

Nox grabbed Monica again.

He wanted to tell this silly girl that her sister had lost her innocence to Fourth Master Swan long ago. ‘Why is she so agitated now?’

Nox told Monica clearly, “Don’t worry. Fourth Master Swan will definitely not take advantage of the situation.”

Monica seemed to believe him but not really.

“Instead of worrying about your sister so much, why don’t you tell me what happened between you and Finn? When you asked me to help you pursue him back then, you did everything you could. After only being in love for a year, you broke up with him? You’re too fickle!” Nox deliberately changed the topic.

Monica was very unhappy. “Why do you always think that it’s my fault? Didn’t Finn tell you why we broke up back then?”

“It’d be weird if he did!” Nox rolled his eyes.

The three of them—him, Fourth Master Swan, and Finn were very close.

It was not an exaggeration to say that they were “life-and-death friends”.

Nonetheless, among the three of them, Fourth Master Swan and Finn never talked about their personal matters.

Fourth Master Swan was alright because Nox had always been by his side and more or less knew something.

However, Nox did not know anything about Finn.

“It’s useless to talk about this now. Anyway, I’ll divorce Finn sooner or later.” Monica did not want to talk about the past.

In her opinion, many things were over.

She did not like to hold grudges.

Monica also did not like to make things difficult for herself.

She had always thought that she was luckier than the average person when she was born, so when she was unhappy, she would always laugh it off.

“Listen to my advice. Finn is a good person. It’ll be a pity to lose him.”

“Ha.” Monica chuckled with disdain.

Nox still wanted to say something, but Monica took the wine glass. “You said you wouldn’t go home until you’re drunk!”

Well, Nox could not be bothered anymore. He took the wine glass and started drinking with Monica again.

They drank until they were both drunk.

Nox and Monica walked out of the private room. Both of them were trying to walk in a straight line, but they obviously could not.

“I’m actually not drunk.” Monica burped and said drunkenly, “I’m just sleepy.”

“Do you think I’m drunk? I wouldn’t have let you go if you were not sleepy... Well, I need to go to the bathroom to use the toilet. I definitely don’t want to throw up. I just want to pee...” Nox said very seriously.

Monica waved her hand and walked out by herself.

Just as she reached the door, a familiar voice was suddenly heard coming from behind her.

“Monica.”

Monica slowly turned her body and swayed as she looked at the person behind her.

She looked at him for a long time. “Michael?”

“Are you drunk?” Michael asked her.

“I’m not drunk. I’m very sober. How can I be drunk?” Monica said very loudly. “I won’t get drunk no matter how much I drink.”

Michael went over directly and held Monica.

His body was really soft. At that moment, Monica leaned into his embrace.

“Are you going to send her back?” Eden asked Michael.

The two of them had dinner together that night. The moment they came out, they saw Monica walking in front of them.

“Yeah.” Michael had helped Monica into his private car. “I’ll leave first. We’ll meet again next time.”

“She’s married,” Eden reminded.

Michael’s body stiffened. “I know.”

“Don’t let a woman affect your bright future.”

Michael did not reply.

He helped Monica into the car.

Monica was a little drunk. She seemed to have heard the conversation between Michael and Eden, but it also seemed to be an illusion.

After all, she did not hear a single word at the most crucial point.

She leaned against the back seat of the car, her world spinning.

Michael did not say anything. He quietly sent her back to the entrance of the residential area where she and Finn lived.

Monica opened the car door.

Michael had gotten out of the car one step ahead of her. He walked to her car door and helped her out.

Monica straightened her body and said, “Thank you. I’ll go back on my own.”

“I’ll send you back.”

“No need. I can walk on my own.”

“Don’t try to be brave.”

“Michael...” Monica called out to him.

Michael looked at her quietly.

“I’m married now.”

“So, other than Finn, other men aren’t allowed to touch you, right?” Michael asked her.

His tone was calm, and there was no emotion in it.

Monica was silent for a few seconds.

It was not that Finn was the only one who could touch her. That man would not touch her either.

Monica just did not want to cause any trouble.

She said, “You should go back and rest early. Good night.”

As she spoke, she pushed Michael away, intending to go back on her own.

“Monica,” Michael called out to her.

Monica staggered and stopped.

“If I say that I want to get you back, what will you do?” Michael enunciated each word.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

Michael walked toward her step by step.

He was so close that she could almost feel his breath above her head.

The next second, he suddenly hugged her from behind.

Monica was shocked.

“I still love you. I’ve always loved you,” he said as he leaned over to her ear with deep affection.

Monica pursed her lips tightly.

Her heart was beating very fast.

It was very fast.

She thought that all relationships missed were missed.

Whether it was her and Finn, or her and Michael.

Monica could calmly get along with them, she could forget about the past, but she did not think that she would have to start all over again.

She did not answer.

Her silence made Michael take the initiative.

He took the initiative to make her turn around and stand face to face with him...

His lips were close to hers.

Monica looked at Michael and watched him get closer.

“Michael...”

“Do you have to let me see this every time?” A male voice was suddenly heard coming from behind her, suppressing her voice.

Michael’s lips were close to Monica’s lips. He could touch her lips if he pouted a little.

In the end, he let go of Monica and stood up straight to look at the man standing in the dark.

Monica turned around at that moment and saw Finn in a daze.

She saw him walk out of the dark and walk to her side. Finn said to Michael, “Are you so fond of stealing one’s partner?”

Michael’s face darkened. “If you treat her well enough, why are you worried?”

“I’m not worried.” Finn sneered as he pulled Monica over.

Monica was caught off guard. Due to her drunkenness, she lost her balance and fell into Finn’s arms.

Finn said, “I simply don’t like it when others touch what belongs to me.”

After saying that, he dragged Monica away.

Michael watched them leave with a ferocious look.

‘What belongs to you?!

‘Monica was never yours!’
