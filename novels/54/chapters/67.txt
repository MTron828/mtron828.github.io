Chapter 68: The Lawrences’ Scheme

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jonathan’s words echoed in the room.

For a moment, Alexander thought he had heard wrong.

He looked at Jonathan, unable to react in time.

At this moment, Joshua was even more agitated. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He shouted at Jonathan, “Why should she be allowed to work in the company?! What qualifications does she have?!”

To Joshua, the only person who was qualified to work at the Lawrence Enterprise was him.

“What qualifications do you have?!” Jonathan’s face darkened.

“I’m the first grandchild of the first child, and only a man is qualified!” Joshua said matter-of-factly.

Jeanne suddenly smiled.

The Lawrences’ preference for sons over daughters was deeply rooted in their hearts from generation to generation.

“I’m afraid you have some misunderstanding about being the first grandchild of the first child,” Jeanne said with some sarcasm.

“Women belong to other families! As a woman, you don’t have the right to work at the company!” Joshua said righteously. He was especially proud of being the only son of this family.

Jonathan was furious. “Joshua, have your parents raised you this way all these years?!”

Joshua was stunned. He looked at Jonathan.

Jonathan’s expression was extremely ugly. “So you think that just because you’re the only son in the family, you can do whatever you want without striving for advancement? You think that the Lawrences will belong to you sooner or later, right?!”

“Grandpa.” At this moment, Joshua seemed to have realized something was wrong.

Ever since he was young, he had always been pampered the most.

“That’s why you don’t strive for advancement. You just muddle along and wait for death!” Jonathan was merciless.

At this moment, Joshua was being scolded in a very embarrassing manner.

He had never been scolded like this before.

Jonathan did not care about Joshua’s emotions at all. “There are no rules in this family where only men can enter the company to work. Also, there’s no such thing as only a son can inherit the traditions of our family’s enterprise. To me, I’ll hand over the enterprise to whoever is more capable!”

“Grandpa...” Joshua was a little flustered.

“Enough!” Jonathan did not seem to want to waste any more time with Joshua. He turned his head toward Jeanne and said, “Since you said that you relied on your capability to enter MUK and rose all the way to the position of marketing director, then go to the company to work and prove yourself with facts!”

“Sure.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

This was the purpose of her return, to begin with.

She wanted to come back and reclaim the Lawrence Enterprise.

Of course, she was not grateful to Jonathan.

She knew he had supported her today just to squeeze her beneficial value from her. Once she was useless, she would end up the same as her mother.

Jeanne could see it, but Joshua could not understand it. He was still agitated.

Jenifer pulled him back.

At this moment, it was obvious that the old man was biased toward Jeanne. No matter how much they said, they would only be scolded more.

Jenifer had always been good at reading people’s expressions.

Jonathan saw that Jeanne agreed immediately and instructed, “Everyone else can leave now. Alex, stay to discuss the specific matters regarding Jeanne going to work tomorrow.”

Jeanne smiled slightly. “Okay.”

Jenifer also agreed.

Joshua’s face was filled with anger as he was forcefully dragged away by Jenifer.

In the room, Alexander’s expression was not too good either.

Jonathan could tell, so his tone was a little gentler. “Are you not satisfied with my arrangement?”

“Dad, you know very well that I don’t like Jeanne,” Alexander said very unhappily, “Not to mention I didn’t have any feelings for her in the past because of her mother, she has been treating me lightly ever since she returned! Now, you’re still letting her strut around in this house!”

“I have my considerations too,” Jonathan said bluntly, “Think about it carefully. Back then, we let Jeanne return to form a marriage agreement with the Lockes, but in the end, the Lockes were forced to go bankrupt. Don’t you think that it has something to do with her?”

Alexander was shocked.

He did not think so much.

“The Lockes went bankrupt because of MUK, and Jeanne has a close relationship with MUK!” Jonathan added.

“So we’re being played by Jeanne!” Alexander gritted his teeth.

“That’s not important. What’s important is that we know what we want,” Jonathan said to his son, “The marriage with the Lockes was just a deal with them. Now that there’s a better opportunity, why don’t we use it?”

“You mean, let Jeanne help us cooperate with MUK?” Alexander immediately understood.

Jonathan nodded.

Alexander still had some misgivings, “But I’m afraid that Jeanne will be like her mother one day, and we won’t be able to control her at all...”

“If you can’t control her, can’t you just do what you did to her mom to her?” Jonathan smiled coldly.

Alexander was stunned, then he slowly said, “After all, she’s my biological daughter...”

“Don’t worry, I won’t let you kill her unless it’s absolutely necessary. You don’t have to think too much about the rest of the matter. What you need to do now is to make use of Jeanne to discuss the collaboration with MUK. By the way, let me remind you that Joshua definitely won’t be able to continue developing like this.” Jonathan’s expression was serious. “You have to put pressure on him.”

Alexander nodded. “Alright, I know what to do.”

“A loving mother is a waste of a child. Don’t tell Jenifer about the matter of pressuring Joshua. She has little tricks, but she can’t think of the big picture.”

“Okay.”

“Think about how to use Jeanne. I’m already old. One day, you’ll have to make your own decisions,” Alexander said earnestly.

“Okay, I won’t let you down.”

Jonathan nodded and beckoned for him to leave.

Alexander walked out of the room.

Jenifer was waiting for him at the door.

The thing that Alexander liked the most about Jenifer was that she was gentle and considerate. She always put him first.

Unlike a certain woman... who never regarded him as anything. In fact, in front of that woman, she always made him feel that he was worthless.

“Dear, how are you? Did Dad scold you?” Jenifer was very concerned.

Alexander shook his head. As he walked, he said, “Dad has?the intention to let Jeanne develop in the company.”

“What?!”

“Tell Joshua to not spend all his time thinking about having fun. If he really wants to have fun, he can’t blame anyone for not getting anything in the end!” Alexander strode away after that.

Jenifer did not believe this at all!

‘Didn’t the Lawrences always value sons over daughters? If I hadn’t given birth to Joshua back then, how could I have become a Lawrence?!’

Jenifer’s expression turned vicious.

‘I won’t let it slip through my fingers just like that!’

…

Jeanne returned to her room.

George woke up in a daze.

“We’ll go out and have dinner with your god-grandfather later,” Jeanne said.

“Did he come here?” George asked.

Jeanne nodded as she went to the cloakroom to look for clothes.

She saw a dazzling array of clothes…

Jeanne had to admit that the Fourth Master Swan had a good eye.

She chose a traditional dark green dress. The slit was very low, and it looked very conservative. Despite that, due to her good figure, her curves were clear, and she was still enchanting.

After George washed up and changed his clothes, Jeanne brought him out of the door and went straight to the hotel where West stayed.

Jeanne knocked on the door, and the door opened.

She was suddenly hugged tightly from the front.

Jeanne was speechless.

The man who was hugging her was very excited. “Surprise!”

‘Damn.

‘Why is Mubier here too?!’
