1072 Going To Court: Intense Debate

With the help of her bodyguards and Steve, she broke free from the reporters and strode away.

Then, a reporter shouted, “Michael is here!”

Monica stopped in her tracks and turned around to see Michael in a suit.

The reporters’ questions flooded in again.

“Mr. Ross, why did you come here personally today? Is it because you can’t let go of Monica or the quality inspection department?”

“I heard that the vaccine incident at Cardellini Pharmaceutical was related to Brie. Brie was resentful that Monica exposed your scandal with her in public, which was why she treated Monica like this. Do you have anything to say about this?”

“Did you know that Brie was using this method to take revenge on Monica? After all, Monica publicly exposed you back then, and you were also humiliated.”

Michael was not as indifferent as Monica.

He maintained his composure and said to all the reporters, “Firstly, I’m here today because of Monica. I feel that she has suffered a lot during this period of time, so I hope that she can prove her innocence for Cardellini Pharmaceutical. The second reason is that this matter is related to the quality inspection department. After all, I used to work there. I feel guilty and sad about this situation, so I want to know about the case.

“And as for my relationship with Brie, and that time we slept together, it happened when I was drunk. I’ve loved Monica for many years. There was no way I would do anything to let Monica down when we were finally getting married. However, it happened, and I don’t want to find any excuse to absolve myself of my responsibility. After all, to Monica, I did betray her. That was why I accepted it when she exposed me in front of everyone and even broke off the engagement in public. It can be considered as making up for my affair.

“Of course, I didn’t know that Brie and the current director of the quality inspection department colluded to take revenge on Monica. After my wedding with Monica, we had already parted ways and had nothing to do with each other. If I had known earlier, perhaps I would have thought of a way to stop this from happening. After all, deep down in my heart, I still have deep feelings for Monica, and I don’t want to see her go through any pain.”

Michael spoke with great affection.

What he meant was that no matter how much Monica had hurt him in the past, he still loved her and hoped that she could live a better life. He would never do anything to make Monica sad. On the one hand, he wanted to clear his name from this lawsuit, and on the other hand, he also wanted to establish his image as a good person.

Monica sneered and turned around to walk directly into the courtroom.

She did not know how long Michael could continue to act so hypocritically, but even if she had to die with Michael, she would definitely make sure that he would lose all his reputation and never be able to have a comeback again!

When Monica left, Michael was still dealing with the reporters.

At that time, Nox and Edward also appeared in the court, but they avoided the reporters and walked in.

“Michael is really not afraid of death.” Nox looked at Michael and the reporter’s performance and sneered.

Edward also glanced over expressionlessly.

The two of them walked into the courtroom.

After sitting down, Nox could not help but say, “I wonder whether Finn will come.”

“Just ask.” Edward glanced at Nox.

“No.” Nox was very determined. “I don’t want to interfere with Finn and Monica’s matters anymore.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Edward was speechless.

When Nox saw that Michael had finished dealing with the reporters and appeared in the audience, he gloated, “Someone is going to have a tragic end.”

At that moment, he was looking forward to Monica’s performance.

In the courtroom, people came in one after another, and many people came to watch the trial.

At 10 a.m., the organizers began to announce the order of the court. The plaintiff, the plaintiff’s lawyer, and the defendant’s lawyer had already arrived.

At 10:10 a.m., when the judge entered the court and announced the start of the trial, everyone stood up and then sat down.

The plaintiff’s lawyer, Judah Smith, stood up and made a statement of facts.

Speaking of which, Judah Smith became famous for helping Jeanne win a lawsuit back then.

Now that he heard that Jeanne’s best friend was filing a lawsuit, he even volunteered himself without taking any legal fees.

Monica did not refuse.

She could fully trust anyone who was related to Jeanne, even if they were barely related.
