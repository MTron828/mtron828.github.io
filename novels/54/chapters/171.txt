Chapter 172: Everything Happened Because of Fourth Master Swan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne sat on the cold and stiff edge of the bed in the detention center.

From the beginning to the end, from the moment she received the news until now, she had not stopped thinking!

She had no way of stopping herself. After all, she only had one week.

Only one week.

If she could not find any evidence within one week, she would be sentenced.

Once she was sentenced, it would be even more difficult to appeal.

Jeanne tried to calm herself down.

It was undeniable that the other party’s frame-up made her feel a little threatened.

After all, Harken was different from other countries. It was a traditional hereditary country, and the military regime was all in the hands of the Sanders. Once the Sanders wanted to do something, they would have 10,000 people to support them. Especially in court politics, everyone would respond to a single call from the Sanders. That was to say, if the Sanders wanted to kill Jeanne, it would be easy.

Moreover, now that the Sanders had locked Jeanne up here, they were not giving her any chance to find evidence.

As such, Jeanne could only wait for Kingsley’s arrival.

In the end, she still caused a lot of trouble for Kingsley.

Initially, Jeanne just wanted to come back and take revenge, help Kingsley do something he wanted to accomplish, and then leave with George…

When did she go off track?

After she thought about it carefully, she realized it started when she was targeted by Fourth Master Swan.

In the end, all of this was because of Fourth Master Swan. If he had not provoked her on purpose, she would not have been treated like this by Melody!

Jeanne took a deep breath.

Now was not the time to complain.

She would just sit and wait for Kingsley!

…

The news of Jeanne’s economic crime suddenly trended again!

Everyone thought that they had read the wrong headline. How did the dark horse of the business world a few days ago suddenly fall into the net again?!

She was slapped in the face too quickly.

Nevertheless, facts spoke louder than words.

The photo of Jeanne being taken away by the prosecutors was everywhere online. Her being arrested became a trending topic as well.

Even though this was not good news, it was worth noting that Jeanne became popular in South Hampton City and even Harken. She was even more popular than A-list celebrities.

There were plenty of searches for Jeanne’s name on the Internet. It was simply a synonym for “traffic”.

Monica also saw the news and only then did she know that Jeanne had been arrested. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She did not believe her own eyes. She rubbed her eyes and looked at it again and again. The moment she confirmed that the person who was arrested was Jeanne, she exploded.

Was it not a few days ago, no, yesterday, when she saw Jeanne being on the news and admired by everyone?!

The financial news said that Jeanne was a rare dark horse in the business world. In the future, her development in the business world would be limitless. Due to Jeanne’s existence, the Lawrence Enterprise’s stock market was booming. Their family business that was on the decline had risen to a whole new level, causing those businesses that were originally on the same level as them to be envious. Now, why did something so big suddenly happen?!

After a moment of shock, Monica was certain that Jeanne had been framed.

Her best friend would definitely not do such a thing.

Monica was so anxious that she rushed out of her office at the next second and rushed toward her dad’s office.

Gary frowned when he saw Monica’s reckless behavior.

This child never seemed to grow up.

How could he trust her with such a large fortune of the Cardellinis in the future?

Monica was not interested in doing business. She also understood that she was not suited to do business with her dad. Although she was not against following his dad in the business world, she spent most of her time loafing on the job. Other than occasionally going on a business trip for her father, she spent most of her time at the company with the mindset of benefiting by proximity to her dad. Gary also knew that Monica’s mind was not on doing business, so he did not have too much hope for her. He just hoped that he could find a son-in-law that he trusted to take over the Cardellini Enterprise.

Finn was very good.

Gary had watched Finn grow up. Finn knew the roots and also knew how to be grateful. Whether it was the company or Monica, Gary felt at ease handing them over to Finn. However... The heavens did not follow his wishes. Micheal suddenly appeared out of nowhere and almost angered Gary to his death.

With a serious expression, Gary asked, “What happened? Why are you so impatient?”

“Dad, Jeannie has been arrested. They said that she committed some economic crime.” Monica was very agitated. “Help me ask the people at the prosecutor’s office if it’s true. Is it serious? What crime did she commit?”
