Chapter 236: Ms. Lawrence, I Haven’t Had a Woman for a Long Time Either

“Should an 18-year-old high school girl only take action instead of talking?!” Shelly asked Nox with a serious expression.

Nox could not say anything at this moment.

He just stared at Shelly with his eyes wide open. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Shelly looked very indifferent. She turned around and said, “When my figure is better, I’ll do it with you.”

“...”

‘When did I f*cking say that I want to do it with you?’

Nox slammed the door shut. He was so angry that he forgot that he had gone out to get water.

He went back to his room and picked up his phone, making a phone call in a huff.

When the call was picked up, the person on the other side immediately scolded him, “Are you crazy? It’s so late now. Don’t you know that your mom wants her beauty sleep?!”

His dad’s angry voice could be heard.

Nox felt very wronged.

He said, “Dad, can you ask Shelly to go back? She has seriously affected my normal life...”

“What normal life do you have? Your life isn’t normal! Take good care of Shelly, or I’ll skin you alive!”

“Dad!”

“There’s no room for discussion!” Nox’s dad was very serious. “Oh right, Gary Cardellini’s birthday party is on the day after tomorrow. We’re going to attend it. Are you going with us or with Fourth Master Swan?”

“I’m going with Fourth Master Swan.” Nox was straightforward.

“Did you just call him Fourth Master Swan? You should call him Fourth Uncle!”

Nox rolled his eyes.

“Take care of Shelly for me!” After saying dad, his dad hung up the phone.

Nox was irritable.

Instead of being comforted, he was scolded!

‘F*ck!

‘Does Shelly need someone to take care of her?!

‘She’s a troublemaker—an annoying one!’

…

The next day, Jeanne had difficulty propping herself up on the bed.

Alcohol was bad!

Every time she got drunk, she would tell herself that she could not drink alcohol in the future, but every time she saw alcohol, it was as if that thing had magic powers. She could not control herself.

In fact, her alcohol tolerance was bad.

Once she drank, she would get drunk.

That said, last night was rather satisfying.

It was enough to satisfy her cravings.

Jeanne got out of bed, went to the bathroom, and squatted on the toilet.

Then, she used her phone.

There were a lot of messages.

She read Kingsley’s message: [I know you’re still sleeping, so I won’t disturb you. I got on the plane.]

Kingsley just left like that.

Jeanne looked at the message with mixed feelings.

Kingsley sent another message: [Remember, you’re NOT allowed to drink except in my presence! I have to emphasize this!]

Jeanne was a little speechless.

At this moment, she could totally imagine the expression on Kingsley’s face when he sent the message.

Despite that, her heart suddenly felt a little warm.

In fact, Jeanne felt happy to be able to have someone who cared about her so much.

Afterward, Jeanne opened WhatsApp.

There was an unread message from Edward.

Fourth Master Swan rarely messaged Jeanne.

She pursed her lips and opened the chat.

[Edward: I haven’t had a woman for a long time either.]

Jeanne frowned.

‘What’s Fourth Master Swan talking about?! He sent this at 3:00 am.

‘He’s crazy.

‘Why did he send me such a flirtatious message instead of sleeping?!’

Jeanne could not be bothered to reply to him and pretended not to have seen it.

She put down her phone and was about to wash up.

A WhatsApp message popped up again.

[Edward: Looks like you slept very well last night, Ms. Lawrence.]

Jeanne knew that Edward could see if she had read his message or not. She had not turned off that setting.

That said, Jeanne still pretended that she did not see his message.

She also deliberately ignored Fourth Master Swan’s tease.

Jeanne put down her phone and washed up.

After washing up, she walked out of the bathroom.

George also got up from the bed in a daze.

“Are you awake?” Jeanne asked.

“Mm.” George nodded.

“Kingsley has left.”

“Oh.” George was still a little upset.

“It’s alright. It won’t be long before we can leave too,” Jeanne comforted him.

“Okay.” George was obedient.

“Take your time and eat breakfast before going to school. I’m ready to go to work.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne changed her clothes and put on makeup. She did not bother with George anymore.

After George washed up and put on his school uniform, he walked in front of Jeanne. “Mom.”

“Huh?” Jeanne was applying her mascara.

“Do you still remember what happened last night?” George asked.

“What happened?” Jeanne was very serious.

“The matter of you touching Fourth Master Swan.”

Jeanne’s hand trembled, and the mascara was smeared on her eyelid.

She looked at George. “What did you say?”

“It seems that you don’t remember,” George muttered.

“Didn’t we have dinner with Kingsley last night?” Jeanne was a little agitated.
