Chapter 1771: Class Reunion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The entire space seemed to have frozen as Shelly looked at Benjamin, not knowing what to do.

She really thought the two of them would become a thing of the past and never have to think about it again.

However, a year later, he returned to her life.

They had even met so unexpectedly.

Sarah probably did not expect Benjamin to appear.

After all, did they not say he had gone abroad? So, why was he back so soon?

At that moment, Sarah felt a little awkward.

She had worked so hard to get Shelly to attend the class reunion. Unexpectedly, they had run into Benjamin. She wondered how awkward it would be for them.

Luckily, the other students did not know that Benjamin and Shelly shared a past, so no one teased them.

Only one guy was teased, “Well if it isn’t Benjamin… Back so soon after studying abroad? I heard you studied at a world-class university under a scholarship. I knew you were quite intelligent when I was studying back then, but I didn’t expect you to be so smart. Now that you’ve returned, you should be making strides, right?!”

Benjamin smiled. “I’m just an ordinary student studying abroad. I’m not as good as you think.”

Without batting an eyelid, he shifted his gaze away from Shelly.

He probably did not expect Shelly to attend such a class reunion.

Shelly also looked away. However, she could clearly feel the subtle changes in her body language.

“Oh, stop being modest.” The boy teased, “Everyone Imows you have a prestigious degree certificate. You can practically enter any company in South

Hampton City.”

“That’s simply not true.” Benjamin smiled.

Someone began to urge them to take their seats.

It was a large round table that could accommodate 30 people. With everyone squeezed together, it looked abnormally lively.

Shelly and Sarah sat together.

While Sarah was fine, Shelly did not attend this class reunion often and was a little reserved.

So, she did say much either.

She heard the boys making a fuss.

“Come, come. It’s the annual class reunion. As usual, let’s drink three glasses first.”

Everyone also raised their glasses. They were really drinking three.

Sarah whispered into Shelly’s ear, “If you can’t drink, then have less. With so many people, no one will notice.”

“It’s nothing.” Shelly smiled.

Since she was here, she naturally had to do as the Romans did.

“It’s really quite festive today. In the past, Shelly never attended our class reunion. Now, look at her, showering us with her beauty. I thought Benjamin wouldn’t be attending either, but he came just in time. There are also Cory and Kevin, who had not come twice. This year is one with the most people!”

“Shouldn’t everyone drink more than they did a few years ago, then?” The classmates jeered.

“That’s right! Come, come.”

Everyone started drinking again.

After, they started drinking in groups.

Shelly did not take the initiative. After all, she was unfamiliar with them and felt a little embarrassed. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, when the others came to propose a toast, she also started drinking

Sarah, on the other hand, was more active.

In the beginning, she was always beside Shelly. Later, once she drank too much, she began to let herself go and went to compete with others.

The seat next to Shelly remained empty until…

Benjamin sat down.

He said, “I thought you didn’t drink.”

He probably realized she had actually drunk quite a bit.

“Since I’m here, I thought I’d join in. I wouldn’t want to spoil everyone’s mood.” “You never participated in the past,” Benjamin observed lightly.

“I couldn’t resist Sarah’s coercion this time. If I don’t satisfy her this time, I’ll be annoyed to death by her in the future.”

“That sounds exactly like something Sarah would do,” Benjamin agreed.

Then, the two seemed to have lost the topic of conversation, and the atmosphere became a little awkward.

Amid the awkwardness… “Are you alright?”

“Are you alright?”

The two of them said in unison.

Then, they laughed.

Benjamin said, “I’ll go first. I’m fine. I’ve learned a lot during my time abroad, as well as a lot of scientific research with his teachers and classmates. I returned to Harken the day before yesterday and have now entered the research department of KSC after signing a contract with the company yesterday. The treatment was very good. I officially start work next Monday.”

“That’s good. I’ve heard of them before. KSC is a technology development company. They are considered as the most authoritative scientific research institution in the country and a pillar of her cultivation..”
