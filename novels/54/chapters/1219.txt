1220 Two Become One

For example, when she was serious about something, she would not consider many other things.

It was to the extent that after the shower, she put on Finn’s bathrobe but did not open the bathroom door for a long time.

It never crossed her mind that she and Finn would still have to go to work tomorrow — that she had a project to negotiate and that Finn, as a doctor, needed to maintain his best at all times and needed sufficient rest.

She just kept thinking about how she was going to face Finn after she went out and slept with him.

Should she let go of everything in the past, start over with him, and return to the kind of relationship where she was always the one giving and taking the initiative?

She even began to wonder whether Finn had really agreed to sleep with her just to satisfy her request. Would he always indulge her because of his guilt toward her?

“Monica.” There was a knock on the bathroom door.

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

She had never thought that she would become such an indecisive person one day.

If it had been in the past and she had not experienced so many horrible things, she definitely would not have hesitated for even a second when Finn wanted to sleep with her; she would have immediately crawled into his bed.

In the end, she opened the bathroom door. By then, the steam from the shower had dissipated.

Finn looked at her. She had removed her makeup, taken a shower, and wrapped herself in his bathrobe that was obviously much bigger than hers but inexplicably made his imagination run wild. He suppressed his emotions and said, “I thought you fainted in the bathroom.

Monica pursed her lips and was about to speak, but Finn suddenly picked her up by the waist.

Stunned, Monica instinctively wrapped her arms around Finn’s neck.

Just now, the moment Finn finished speaking, she actually wanted to tell him to forget about tonight. However, she suddenly swallowed her words.

Finn placed her placed on his large, soft bed that sank in a little with her weight, causing her entire body to be buried in between his beddings and under his body.

The room was brightly lit, so bright that they could clearly see each other’s expressions.

The two of them looked at each other, and their breathing gradually became heavier. However, they stayed like that for a long time.

After a long time, Monica suddenly closed her eyes and exerted more strength on the hand that was hugging Finn’s neck. She forcefully pulled his head down and kissed him deeply.

She thought that since things had come to this, and he could not make up his mind, she would do it.

Her lips were on his, entangled.

Finn’s body tensed up because of her sudden initiative. In fact, he had been very tense because he never knew if he was good at it, and that was why he had been adjusting his emotions.

He was afraid that he would be too impatient or… stiff. Coupled with the softness under his body, his heart was beating so fast that his mind went blank.

In the end, Monica took the initiative, and since she took the initiative, he became even more helpless.

He had never thought that one day, under her seduction, he would lose control of himself to that extent. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was just that… he wanted it so badly, but he also wanted to suppress it, and suppressing it made him want it even more.

Finally, Finn loosened his tightly clenched fists and hugged Monica’s body with both hands. He went from being passive to proactive.

Then, he became one with her.

His memory from the previous time was blurry, and everything he did was just to release that instinctive desire.

This time, he could feel his intense desire. From beginning to end, he was unimaginably wild.

…

Under the same night sky, in the palace-like banquet hall, people came and went.

It was impossible for Alex to stay until the end. With his current status, all he needed to do was some simple socializing, and the rest Edward would handle.

Now, Alex was ready to leave, and Edward was naturally the one to send him off.

The group of them walked to Alex’s exclusive passageway, where the surroundings were heavily guarded and there were many bodyguards.

Before Alex got into the car, he turned back to Edward. “I went to see Jeanne today.”

Edward looked up.

“She’s very smart. She knows what she should do,” Alex said bluntly.

Edward remained silent.

“Edward, since you have chosen to give up, don’t struggle anymore. Susan is not inferior to Jeanne. Over time, you’ll know that liking someone is just a thing of the past. Power, wealth, and status are the only things that a man should possess and cherish.”
