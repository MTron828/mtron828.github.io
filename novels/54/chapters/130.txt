Monica tossed and turned then sat up from the bed.

She rubbed the spot twice, but it still felt a little uncomfortable.

She lifted the blanket and got off the bed, preparing to pour herself a cup of warm water.

The moment she opened the door, she suddenly bumped into Finn, who was still wearing his work clothes. It looked like he had just returned.

She looked at the clock on the wall and it was 2 am.

This guy was coming back home later and later as days went by.

Of course, she did not mind.

Ever since he left her on the street in the heavy rain, her hatred for him only grew stronger. During this period of time, they barely said a word to each other. On second thought, they had only met a few times ever since.

Usually, when she returned home, Finn was not there.

When she woke up, Finn had already left.

Monica walked past Finn with a cold expression.

Finn did not greet her either.

Monica went to the open kitchen and poured herself a cup of warm water. After drinking a few mouthfuls, she still felt a tingling pain. She thought about it and went to the medical kit at home to see if there was any medicine that could be taken. She remembered that she had asked the doctor to prescribe some medicine for mammary gland hyperplasia. When she thought about it, she was really angry. She was so young, and she was still a f*cking virgin. Yet she had been diagnosed with mammary gland hyperplasia two years ago. It was really strange.

She rummaged through the medicine.

Then, she felt a presence behind her.

She turned her head and saw Finn, who was standing there looking down at her.

She was so frightened that she gasped. At that moment, she was a little flustered. “Why are you standing here in the middle of the night? Who are you trying to scare?”

Finn’s eyes were cold.

Monica took a deep breath and turned around to continue searching.

She finally found a box. She looked at the expiry date and realized that it was not due yet.

She picked it up and planned to take it according to the instructions.

“You can’t take the medicine carelessly,” Finn suddenly reminded her.

“This is what the doctor prescribed for me previously.”

“Different conditions require different medicines. These medicines were given to you last time. I suggest that you go to the doctor and follow the doctor’s instructions before you decide whether to take them or not. Otherwise, you’ll easily be poisoned by the medicine.”

Monica looked at Finn.

After all, this man was a doctor. Although she was a little annoyed by his words, she was somehow convinced.

She put down the medicine box and left angrily.

“Monica,” Finn suddenly called out to her.

Monica was a little impatient. “What?”

“Hyperplasia of the mammary glands is very common in women, but don’t neglect it. Ninety percent of breast cancers are caused by hyperplasia of the mammary glands,” Finn said coldly, “And now, the cancer population is gradually getting younger. It’s not like there aren’t people who have breast cancer in their twenties.”

Monica looked straight at Finn.

After Finn finished speaking, he lowered his head to look for the medicine.

However, he found it very quickly. He picked up the medicine box and walked to the kitchen. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Monica gritted her teeth.

Finn could never say any nice words.

However, she swore to never get affected by his words.

She went back to her room in a huff and slammed the door shut.

Breast cancer...

F*ck!

Was Finn cursing her?

…

Lawrence Enterprise.

Jeanne put down the phone and pressed the landline. “Amy, help me make another cup of coffee and come in. Also, inform the project team that the meeting will start in ten minutes.”

“Yes.”

Amy was respectful.

Jeanne leaned back in her chair. After removing the missed calls, she opened her social media app.

There were a lot of unread messages.

She flipped through them and saw a message from [ Ed ].

She pursed her lips and opened it.

[ Ed: Busy tonight? ]

It was sent at 9 pm.

[ Ed: Still working? ]

It was sent at 11:00 pm.

[ Ed: Don’t tire yourself out. ]

It was sent at 0:00 am.

And then...

There was nothing.

Jeanne thought about it, but in the end, she chose not to reply.

Amy served her coffee.

Jeanne put down her phone and asked, “How are the others?”

“They’re all doing well.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded slightly.

She finished her coffee and walked into the meeting room.

The other members of the project team were already waiting for her. She sat in the middle of the room and said, “Thank you for your hard work. It’s 2:20 am now. Let’s do a progress check.”

“Yes.”

“How’s the situation on Team Leader Jackson’s side?”

“It’s very troublesome,” Forrest said bluntly, “Ever since you arranged the work in the afternoon, I’ve been working with my colleagues in the General Administration Department to help me negotiate with the news media that we’ve worked with before. Everyone is fighting for our cause, but no media has agreed to speak up for us. Most of the excuses are that when it comes to news related to political parties, they all have strict control imposed over themselves. They all need to go through a very complicated review process, and the process will be very long. The implication is that they can promise to publish the news, but they don’t know when. To put it bluntly, they’re saying no.”
