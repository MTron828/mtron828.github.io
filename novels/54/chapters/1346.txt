1347 Parting On Good Terms and Breaking Up In The End

It just felt like the importance of the wedding ceremony was far greater than the essence of marriage.

“I think they look the same.” Monica could not give any constructive suggestions because there was no difference.

Most importantly, none of them were what she liked, and now, she suddenly remembered Jeanne’s wedding dress.

That was the best wedding in the world. At that time, she was touched by Edward picking Jeanne up with rows of cars filled with flowers.

Now, she did not know whether she felt sorry for Jeanne or sad for the woman in front of her.

Would a woman of the royal family be happy?

It was such an important moment in her life, yet Candice had to choose her wedding dress alone. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I think so too.” Candice did not seem to be as emotional as Monica.

When she was suddenly informed to try on the wedding dress today, she was a little stunned.

She almost thought that she did not need to try it on and that she could put it on on the day of the ceremony. Yet, he said that she had to choose one, and she had to choose one of the two options.

In fact, she also thought that both dresses were about the same, but the main point was that she was not stunned by the wedding dresses. She even had a feeling that she had seen a wedding dress more gorgeous and better than those.

However, after thinking about it carefully, her mind was blank.

“In that case, I’ll choose the one on the right.” Candice did not want to dwell on it.

“Alright.” The staff member quickly nodded and said respectfully, “Although Ms. Nicholson’s wedding dress is tailor-made according to your size, you still need to try it on to see if it’s alright. We still have a few more days to alter it. Please try it on here.”

With that, Candice left with the staff.

As Monica waited on the sofa, she picked up a magazine and read it.

“Yo, you’re here too.” A male voice suddenly sounded in her ear.

Monica raised her head to see Nox, who arrived but did not see Edward. She was about to lower her head when she suddenly thought of something and stared at Nox blankly.

She wanted to see if… there were any similarities between them.

“Hey.” Nox was baffled by Monica’s stare. “You don’t like me, do you?! Let me tell you, I’m already taken. Don’t you have any ideas about me.”

Monica came back to her senses and rolled her eyes. She said speechlessly, “I’m just wondering if someone has already been cuckolded.”

“You mean Finn?” Nox’s tone was firm.

Monica sneered.

“Tell me, Monica. Did you do something shameful behind Finn’s back?” Nox questioned.

“You should mind your own business.” Monica could not be bothered with Nox. “Maybe one day, a child will appear and call you daddy.”

“Ridiculous.” Nox did not take it to heart. “I, Nox, have roamed the world for so many years, but I’ve never failed! I won’t have a kid!”

“Heh.” Monica laughed sarcastically.

She could not believe that the guy was still showing off.

“You, on the other hand, really broke up with Finn.” Nox changed the topic.

“He told you?” Monica seemed calm.

Of course, she was a little surprised. After all, Finn rarely talked about himself, so it was a little surprising that he told Nox so quickly.

“You guys have been together for so many years. Isn’t it a pity to break up?” Nox started to question.

He was helping Finn find out Monica’s attitude toward Finn now.

“It would be a pity if we don’t break up.” Monica said bluntly, “If we don’t break up, we’ll waste everyone’s time.”

“Haven’t you thought about being together with Finn forever?”

“I haven’t thought about it.”

“You’ve never thought that you would be with him for so many years–”

“Nox,” Monica directly interrupted him. “Can you stop being such a busybody?”

Nox’s eyes widened.

Monica was really good for nothing.

“How long has it been since you last saw Shelly?” Monica immediately changed the topic.

She really did not want to talk about Finn anymore. From now, she did not want to hear a single thing about him.

It was not that he could not let go, but she just did not want to be tied up with Finn.

“Why are you suddenly talking about her?” Nox’s face was filled with disgust.

His dislike for Shelly was bone-deep.

“I met her,” Monica said bluntly.

“You met her? Why did you meet her?” Nox was a little agitated.
