“What am I doing? You came back just at the right time! I want to talk to you guys about my grandson’s employment.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Your grandson’s employment? Just apply through the proper channels. Why are you causing a ruckus at our house?”

“Why am I causing a ruckus? Tsk, tsk, tsk. This is amazing. Now that you’re Director Ross, can’t I, an old man, ask for your help?”

“What are you talking about?” Michael was angry. “If you continue like this, I’ll get someone to kick you out.”

“Don’t even think about kicking me out! Back when your father was still alive, he would treat me with respect. Who do you think you are now?”

“If it’s within my capabilities, I’ll be happy to help my cousin. But if it isn’t, helping him isn’t my duty. It’s useless for you to mess around here.” Michael’s presence was still very imposing.

However, that second great-uncle did not care at all. He shouted at Michael, “Within your capabilities? Don’t think I don’t know that you have a lot of power now. Moreover, you’re together with the Cardellinis’ daughter. Letting your cousin enter Cardellini Enterprise is a piece of cake! You’re not helping me because you don’t want to.”

“I don’t want to waste my time with you.” Seemingly having lost his patience, Michael went forward and tugged on that second great-uncle, wanting to kick him out of the house.

Reese seemed persuaded for a moment.

However, the second great-uncle’s son saw how his father was being treated, so he went forward to push Michael away.

To protect himself, Michael quickly let go of his second great-uncle, who lost his balance and fell to the ground, hitting his head.

Everyone was shocked.

Uncle and aunt rushed over excitedly. “Dad, are you okay?”

“Second great-uncle?” Michael looked at him in shock.

The second great-uncle screamed in pain, “Michael, I’m 70 years old this year, and how dare you hit me. You actually hit me like this. I’m going to sue you and tell everyone you’re heartless, that you don’t care about your relatives. I’m going to destroy your reputation. What are the two of you still standing there for? Take pictures for me. Hurry up!”

The uncle and aunt quickly took out their phones and took a lot of photos.

“Don’t take any photos!” Michael reprimanded.

However, the two of them still took a lot of photos. After they were done, they even held onto their phones tightly.

“Hurry up and delete them.” Reese was also a little agitated.

“Don’t delete them!” The second great-uncle lay on the ground and refused to get up. “Unless you agree to let your cousin enter Cardellini Enterprise’s research team, I’ll get your uncle and aunt to send the photos out. I refuse to believe that the world won’t side with us.”

“Second great-uncle, you...” Furious, Michael gritted his teeth and said, “Whatever!”

“Michael.” Reese stopped him. “No, you can’t have any more negative news. We’ve only managed to stabilize the situation after much difficulty. If any scandal of yours gets exposed, our family will be done for.”

However, Michael remained unmoved.

At that moment, Reese seemed to have noticed Monica, who was also shocked by the strange actions of the second great-uncle’s family.

She had always thought that only television would have such... melodramatic and despicable scenes.

She did not expect it to happen right before her eyes.

“Monica.” Reese grabbed Monica. “Can you take it as helping me? Can you tell your father to let Michael’s cousin join Cardellini Enterprise? I’ve seen his resume. Your company won’t lose out on anything by hiring him.”

“Mom, don’t make things difficult for Monica.” Michael seemed unhappy about what his mother told Monica.

“I–”

“Let’s go.” Michael grabbed Monica’s hand and wanted to leave.

“Michael, can you think about me? After your father passed away, you’re all I have left. You’re all we have left in the Rosses.” Reese cried very sadly.

Michael was visibly trying to hold back his emotions, but he still left, dragging Monica along with him.

“Michael, if you dare to leave, I’ll expose you immediately!” The second great-uncle threatened him from behind!

Michael did not stop in his steps, but Monica did.

She said, “Aren’t you afraid your second uncle will expose you?”

“I won’t make things difficult for you.”

“Actually...” Monica wanted to say something but hesitated.

She had seen his cousin’s resume. He could be considered a talent in the Cardellini Enterprise.

However, her father was more cautious in choosing people. Usually, he would not hire those who did not know the ins and outs.

“I’ll try to persuade my father again,” Monica said.

“I really don’t want to make things difficult for you.”

“Although my father is stubborn, he can’t stand me pestering him.”
