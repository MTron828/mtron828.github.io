Chapter 385: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn

The sounds of beatings echoed in the warehouse.

Monica looked at Finn in front of her and at his bloody face.

No matter how hard the three men in front of him tried to tear her apart from him, he hugged her tightly in his arms,

Monica’s tears kept falling.

“Finn, can you let go of me? I’m begging you. Let me go...” She really did not need him to sacrifice his life to protect her. She really was not worth it.

She was already on the verge of breaking down.

However, no matter what she said or begged in Finn’s ear, he acted as if he could not hear her. It was as if he had lost consciousness, but he kept her body under his the entire time.

The bearded man lost his patience.

No matter how they hit the man in front of him or how they treated him, he did not seem to feel any pain. No matter what they did, they could not make the man leave the woman’s body.

Damn it. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The bearded man’s expression was extremely ugly. “Remove his hands for me!”

He shall see how the man could continue to hug the woman.

Monica was stunned for a moment when she heard the bearded man. Then, her tears kept falling as she thought, ‘No. They can’t do that.’

......

Hence, she twisted her body and resisted. “Finn, I beg you to let go of me. Can you let go of me? We don’t have any feelings for each other, and we’re about to get a divorce. You don’t have to protect me like this. Why do you have to protect me like this? I-I don’t love you. I don’t love you...”

The man, who had been hugging her, seemed to react slightly to that. It was like a mechanical reaction.

However, he was still unconscious.

Finn seemed to have lost consciousness.

“Remove it for me!” the bearded man ordered coldly.

With that, Monica saw the two men crouch down.

As they crouched down, a sharp dagger appeared in front of her eyes, and it was aimed at Finn’s arm.

“No! Don’t!” Monica screamed, “I beg you. Don’t do this. Finn’s a doctor. He’s a doctor. He can’t lose his hands. I beg you. I beg you to let him go...”

For the first time, Monica felt incredibly helpless. She really did not know what to do.

How could she save Finn?

How should she treat this man?

“Ah!” Monica screamed.

The heart-wrenching scream reverberated in the warehouse. Only complete despair and extreme pain could make such a scream.

She was breaking down, and she felt that her world might collapse at any second.

If Finn really died, she wanted to be buried with him!

Her ferocious expression made the man who was attacking her pause for a moment.

However, the mercenary group had no feelings. They had seen all the forms of a human in the face of death. No matter how tragic it was, to them, it was just... a passing cloud.

Therefore, the man who paused for a moment suddenly stabbed down hard with his dagger.

As he was about to stab the arm, the sound of a gunshot suddenly rang out in the warehouse with a bang.

Everyone was startled.

No one had expected that other people would come at that moment.

By the time the three men came to their senses, they all fell down before they could even raise their guns and defend themselves.

With her eyes wide open, Monica watched the three men in front of her die with their eyes wide open.

Did that mean they were saved?

At that moment, she did not even feel afraid anymore or thought how horrifying a dead person looked.

She just stared at the man who had just walked into the warehouse.

The man had his face covered as if he did not want anyone to recognize him.

The moment he walked in, he looked left and right before suddenly raising his pistol.

“Bang!”

There was another gunshot, which shot down a camera hidden in the corner of the warehouse.

Just like that, Michael, who had been watching the scene, saw the image on the screen disappear in an instant.

Michael’s expression turned grim.

Who was that person who seemed to know something?

He gritted his teeth.

At first, his plan was to kill Finn, regardless of whether Finn was that person or not.

Even though the President did not give the order to kill Finn, he could use mistakes as an excuse. After all, regardless of whether Finn was that person or not, he would be able to answer to the President even if Finn died.
