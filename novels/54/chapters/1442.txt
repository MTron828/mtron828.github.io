Chapter 1443: George Was Moved

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She could not sleep because she was worried about George. Even though Teddy was spending the night with George, she entered George’s room quietly.

In the room, Teddy sat on the sofa beside George and was not asleep. He was probably planning to keep watch over George.

When he saw Candice, he was about to speak, but Candice gestured for him to keep quiet as she was afraid of waking George. She had a feeling that George was just like Edward, who was alert all the time.

Teddy nodded in response, and Candice walked to George’s side and gently touched his forehead. It was a little hot, so she took George’s temperature with an ear thermometer.

George moved his body uncomfortably and went back to sleep again. Candice looked at the temperature on the thermometer — 38 degrees. Fortunately, it did not go up.

At that moment, Teddy had already walked to Candice’s side and said respectfully in a low voice, “Madam, don’t worry. I will stay with George tonight. If there are any signs of a high fever, I will call Dr. Jones. It’s getting late. You should get some rest.”

“You can go and rest. I’ll keep watch,” Candice said bluntly.

Teddy was surprised.

“You have so many things to do every day. How can you not sleep? I don’t have anything to do all day anyvvay. I can stay up all night and catch up on sleep during the day.”

Still, Teddy was hesitant.

“Don’t worry. If I really can’t stay up all night, I’ll wake you up.” Candice urged, “Hurry up and go to sleep.”

“Yes.” Teddy could not reject Candice’s request.

Then, he left respectfully, leaving only Candice and George in the room.

George seemed to be in a deep sleep, so Candice found a chair and sat beside George. She was on her phone while she keep watch over George.

The first half of the night was basically peaceful. However, at 2 a.m. in the middle of the night, George’s face turned redder by the minute, and he was tossing and turning in his sleep.

Candice quickly went over to touch George’s forehead, which was burning, and it gave her a fright. She quickly picked up the thermometer and took George’s temperature. It instantly rose to 39-3 degrees.

Anxious, Candice quickly dialed Finn’s number. “Dr. Jones, George’s temperature has risen to 39-3 degrees.”

“Alright, I’ll be right there. Now, help him lower his temperature physically.”

“Alright.”

Candice did not ask Finn how to lower the temperature physically. It seemed to be common sense, and she knew what to do.

She quickly went to the bathroom to get a cold towel and placed it on George’s forehead. Then, she unbuttoned his pajamas, revealing George’s burning body that was covered with wounds of all sizes and bruises.

Candice’s heart ached when she saw that. What was George going through at such a young age?

However, she did not dare to waste any more time. She used another towel to wipe George’s body again and again, trying to lower his temperature.

“It hurts…” George frowned and cried out.

“Where does it hurt?” Candice quickly asked. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She was wiping his body as gently as she could. She even carefully avoided George’s wounds, so she did not know where she had touched him.

“My leg hurts.” George opened his eyes groggily and instinctively wanted to grab his injured leg.

“You can’t touch it.” Candice quickly grabbed George’s hand.

George was in a daze, and if he was not careful, he would scratch his wound.. She could not imagine the consequences. Therefore, she held George’s hand tightly to keep him from moving.

“It hurts…” George kept screaming.

At that moment, Candice felt as if she had been clawed by a cat.

She comforted him, “When Finn comes later, I’ll get him to give you the painkillers. Can you bear with it first… Ow.”

Candice bit her lip.

She figured George was probably in so much pain that he could not control himself from biting the biting of her hand. Moreover, his bite was strong, and he refused to let go.

Despite that, Candice did not push George away. If it made George feel better, she was willing to help him ease his pain.

After some time, George could taste blood in his mouth, and he let go of his teeth.

He said, “I want water.”

He was thirsty.

“Okay, but you have to promise me that you won’t move your hands, okay?” Candice coaxed George gently.

George was still in a daze..
