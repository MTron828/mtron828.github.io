Chapter 353: George’s Parent-Child Sports Day

The teacher introduced today’s competition segments to the parents and children. The parents also had a copy of the list of events.

Monica looked at the segments and said, “Do the parents also have to participate?”

“This is a parent-child sports day.”

“Family relay competition.” Monica read the name of the event. “I’m an idiot in sports.”

Ever since she was young, she had skipped PE classes for all sorts of reasons.

The most classic one was when the PE teacher held her leave of absence slip and asked with a twitch of her lips, “You get your period four times a month?”

Everyone burst into laughter.

At that time, Monica was the laughing stock of the school.

“Don’t worry. As long as you don’t crawl, I’ll be able to turn things around.” Nox had a confident look on his face.

“Alright.” She could only give it her all.

After the teacher explained all the events, the children went to their designated locations to participate in their respective events.

George was doing a long-distance run.

At that moment, he had put on his number plate and was warming up.

......

Monica squatted beside George and could not help but tease him. “I didn’t know my son was so good at racing. To think you’re in the long-distance running competition.”

Could George say that it was arranged by his teacher?

“Me, your godmother, will cheer for you the whole time!”

“No, thanks.” He just wanted to run quietly by himself.

He felt that the people around him were all silly.

Monica was not aware of what George was thinking, but she was beyond excited.

She had not participated in activities like that for a long time. Sometimes, the company would organize team-building activities, but because she was the boss’s daughter, the boss wanted her to look mature… Hence, she could only pretend to be a judge and had never really experienced the fun.

“Boss.” While Monica was excited, she suddenly heard a few children’s voices.

Monica turned her head, only to see a few children much taller and stronger than George treating him with respect.

As if he had gotten used to it, George nodded coldly.

“Boss, you can do it. I’ll run with you the entire way,” Adam said.

George simply nodded again.

Monica stood up and looked meaningfully at that brat, George.

She did not expect him to be so amazing!

To think he had even taken his seniors as his minions. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With that, George warmed up for a while until the competition started.

Monica was a little nervous. She felt even more nervous than when she had to take the PE exam.

She watched as George calmly stood at the starting line.

When a gunshot sounded, George and the other six children started running on the track.

Seeing George running, Monica shouted excitedly, “Go, George! Go, son, go!”

She could not care less about her image at all.

Nox, who was also quite excited, looked at Monica’s expression and thought he should stay away from her.

Something must be wrong with him for him to ask Monica to form a group with him.

“Go, George, go...” Monica’s voice was the loudest.

Most of the students who came here were people with status, so they could not act as they wanted.

However, because of Monica’s excitement, the others could not hold it in anymore. Finally, the other mothers also went crazy.

“Go, Kenny, go!”

“My boy, go...”

Hearing that the voices of the people next to her had become louder, Monica shouted even louder, “Go, George! Go...”

She even dragged the last note.

For a moment, the entire venue was filled with noise from the long-distance running event. It also attracted many parents, children, and teachers whose events had not started to come over.

In an instant, the long-distance running event became the focus of the sports day. To be more precise, the cheerleading team was what attracted the people more.

Nox really had to give it to Monica.

Then, he looked at George and saw the kid’s athletic abilities... It was difficult to explain in a word, but George had almost fallen to the last place.

“How is it going?” A familiar voice suddenly sounded in his ear.

Nox turned his head around to see Finn by his side.

“Why are you here?” Nox was surprised.

“I’m on a break today.”

“Are you worried about Monica?” Nox exposed him.

“No. I’m worried she’ll mess up George’s sports day.”

“That is indeed something to worry about.” Nox nodded and gestured to where Monica was standing.

Finn immediately spotted her.

It was difficult to find someone in such a huge stadium, but at that moment, he suddenly saw her.

No matter where Monica went, she… could never stop.

He watched her as she shouted until her face was red. She was really a hundred times more excited than the young players on the field.
