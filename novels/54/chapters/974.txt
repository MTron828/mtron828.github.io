975 How Should She Repay Jeannie?

However, even under such careful circumstances, something unexpected could happen.

Moreover, she had never thought that as an adult, things like that would still happen.

She did not know what to do, so she smiled and acted as if nothing had happened. In fact, she had better apologize to him quickly.

She just stood there at the door, and Finn looked back at her in the same way.

He said, “Wait for me outside for a while.”

“Alright.” Monica made herself look very calm.

She calmly closed the door behind her. Then, he sat on the sofa and waited.

Her mind was filled with the scene in the lounge.

She had always thought that Finn had no desire. He was as cold as an ice cube, and he did not have any sexual needs.

Although he was too aggressive when he was drugged, she usually felt that Finn had no sexual desires.

Could he have been seduced by someone during this period of time?

Perhaps it was Sarah, that little brat.

Although Sarah was forced to go to school now, she still went to the hospital often. Under the guise of accompanying her uncle, she would openly come to the hospital to spend time with Finn.

Monica would occasionally hear her mother say something about them, like how Finn was quite good to Sarah, and her mother would also give Sarah some advice.

In fact, she was quite impressed by Finn. He had been out of school for so many years, yet he still knew the junior college curriculum?

Of course, she could not rule out the possibility that it was just a way for the couple to date.

Monica was thinking about all sorts of things as she waited for Finn to come out of the lounge.

He seemed to have taken a shower and washed his hair. At that moment, he had changed into a clean white coat.

He glanced at Monica.

Having received the signal, Monica quickly walked to his desk and sat down.

Finn did not show any hint of awkwardness and went straight to the point. “Your father’s surgery will be at 10 a.m. the day after tomorrow. These are the things to take note of during the surgery and the risks that may arise during and after the surgery. You don’t have to worry about the rest. The occurrence rate of these few items is as high as 50 percent, so you have to read carefully and be mentally prepared.”

Monica listened to his instructions and read the surgical consent form.

Heart rejection, infection, kidney failure, respiratory failure, cerebrovascular lesions...

She read on silently before asking, “Do I need to sign this?”

There was no other option. Since Finn had suggested a heart transplant, she would trust him.

Finn nodded. “If there’s no problem, you can sign it.”

“Alright.” Monica signed it and then handed the surgical consent form back to Finn.

Once Finn made sure everything was right, Monica was prepared to leave.

Just as she walked away, she asked, “Will you be in the operating theatre with the specialist?”

“Yes,” Finn said.

Monica did not know why, but with Finn around, she would have more confidence in the surgery.

“In that case, can I ask that you rest well for the next two days?” Monica said.

Finn’s hand, which was arranging the documents, paused. Then, he looked up at Monica.

“Please don’t sleep in the hospital. You can send other doctors to check on my dad at night. After all, sleeping in the hospital can be uncomfortable. Not only will you not sleep well, but you can’t…” Monica did not say it explicitly, but she believed Finn could understand. “I hope that you can be in your best condition, physically and mentally, when you’re performing surgery on my father.”

Monica did not know if Finn’s physiological reaction would affect his body.

All she knew was that it was not normal for a mature man to have such a physiological reaction. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Anything abnormal naturally meant that it was not good for the body.

If he could avoid it, he should try his best to avoid it.

She was really afraid that something would go wrong during her father’s surgery.

“I know my body very well,” Finn replied, and his expression was ugly. “I don’t need you to remind me.”

Monica bit her lip.

“As a doctor, I will take responsibility for every one of my patients,” Finn said coldly.

“I was overthinking.” Monica smiled.

Perhaps she was overthinking it.

Hence, she said, “I’ll head out then.”

Seeing that Finn did not answer, Monica left tactfully.

When the door closed, Finn’s tensed face became even uglier.

He put down the documents in his hand.

It was true. When she woke up that morning, she had a physiological reaction that… had not happened since he went through puberty.
