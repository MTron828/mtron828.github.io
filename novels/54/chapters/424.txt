Chapter 425: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

“All I want is to wipe your body for you.” Monica looked very determined.

Finn did not answer for a long time, and the nurse did not know whether she should leave or not.

Suddenly, it felt as if the air had frozen.

Monica’s eyes reddened again. “In that case, can I watch from the side?”

Yes, she had compromised, and she seemed to be very afraid of him.

Finn’s heart skipped a beat.

He said, “You can go out.”

Monica held back her tears as she took her walking stick and prepared to leave.

“I’m talking about the nurse,” Finn said.

Monica’s body stiffened for a moment. The change in her expression was also very obvious. From looking like she was about to die of grief, she was now smiling brilliantly with her eyes.

At that moment, the nurse seemed to be amused by Monica.

Rumor had it that Dr. Jones loved Mrs. Jones very much. However, they forgot to mention that Mrs. Jones also loved Dr. Jones very much.

The two of them clearly loved each other very much.

......

Hence, she hurriedly left. “Mrs. Jones, if there’s anything you need, you can call me. I’ll wait outside.”

“Okay.” Monica’s mood instantly lifted. She was in a great mood!

She watched as the nurse left and then turned to look at Finn.

There were still tears in her eyes, but she could smile so warmly.

She said, “Finn, don’t worry. I definitely won’t do any worse than the nurse.”

He felt that he was digging a hole for himself.

Monica untied Finn’s clothes excitedly. Under her clothes, Finn’s body was covered in bandages, and those areas without bandages were covered in bruises.

Monica was shocked.

Seeing that she suddenly paused, he said, “It’s much better now.”

“If it’s much better, why is it still so serious?” Monica’s eyes reddened again.

That day, Finn was almost beaten to death because of her.

“I don’t feel any pain,” Finn said.

Monica was surprised.

“I don’t feel any pain,” Finn said again.

He did not want her to be sad, so he told her his secret.

“No matter how serious the injury is, I won’t feel any pain,” Finn explained. “So these injuries are nothing to me.”

“Really?” Monica did not seem to believe it.

“Try it,” Finn said.

“How?”

“Touch my wound with your hand and see if I react.”

No. She could not bring herself to do it.

“Try,” Finn said sternly.

Monica pouted.

However, under Finn’s order, she touched a bruise with her finger.

“Harder.”

Monica pressed it harder.

“Harder.”

Monica gritted her teeth and pressed even harder.

After she poked him, she looked at Finn’s reaction with some lingering fear, but he was right. He did not react at all.

Did that mean he could not feel any pain?

“It’s true.” Finn gave her an affirmative answer as if having read her mind.

“I can’t believe you have such a special ability!” Monica moved her finger away from his wound with an exaggerated expression.

Finn laughed.

“God is too kind to you!” Monica could not help but exclaim.

In fact, not feeling pain was not a good thing.

Those who had special abilities were against common sense, and they would often pay the price for going against common sense.

For example, he never knew how serious his injuries were! He also did not know when he might die!

Of course, he did not explain further at that moment.

He looked at Monica, who was studying his body in surprise. She touched everywhere on his body as she asked, “If you can’t feel pain, can you feel me touching you?”

“I can feel the pressure.”

“It’s really amazing.” Monica was suddenly fascinated by that ability of his and had completely forgotten what she was supposed to do.

As such, Finn had no choice but to remind her, “Monica, I can’t catch a cold.”

That was why he could not allow her to take off her clothes and become a human guinea pig.

Only then did Monica come to her senses.

She hurriedly said, “I’ll help you to wipe your body.”

Finn pursed his lips tightly.

Monica twisted the hot towel and carefully wiped his body, bit by bit, until he was clean.

Finn had been lying in the hospital for a week and could not move. However, his body was not dirty at all. There was not even a hint of sweat on him.

Sure enough, the nurse had touched him many times a day.
