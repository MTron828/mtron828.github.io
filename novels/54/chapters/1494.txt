Chapter 1495: Edward and Candice Clarify Their Relationship

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a marriage, it was equivalent to having an affair, or even worse.

Candice could not possibly have no self-esteem at all. After being bullied by Edward to that extent, she would definitely make a fuss for the sake of that so-called position as the Leader’s wife, right?

Chloe was just waiting for the drama to unfold.

At that moment, Candice picked up all the wrapping papers in front of her. Chloe looked at Candice’s actions and assumed that Candice would definitely bring it to Edward to question him.

She was laughing sinisterly in her heart when she saw Candice suddenly walk into the toilet with the wrapping paper. She quickly followed her and watched in disbelief as Candice threw the wrapping paper into the toilet bowl and flushed it down.

“Candice!” Chloe was so angry that she even called her by her name! “Let’s just let this matter pass. Other than you and me, don’t tell anyone else.”

“How can you do that for the sake of your position? Don’t you care about your dignity?” Chloe looked at Candice in disbelief.

She did not expect such an outcome — for Candice to choose such a method for the sake of power and reputation. She had always thought that Candice had strong self-esteem and could not tolerate being deceived or even hurt like that.

“Accompanying the king is like accompanying a tiger.” Candice looked at Chloe.

“Do you really think Edward and I are equals in this marriage?”

“Even if that is the case, you should clarify things. There’s no need for you to swallow your anger—”

“This is my business.” Candice immediately interrupted Chloe. “Chloe, no matter what your motive is for today’s incident, I should remind you not to provoke Edward. You can’t afford to offend him, and neither can the Nicholsons.”

“You make it sound so righteous and honorable, but aren’t you just loving your current identity? Of course, it’s normal. No woman in the world wouldn’t want to be the wife of the Leader and be admired by thousands of people. It’s not that I don’t understand, but I just look down on you for being willing to stoop so slow for the sake of benefits. I look down on women like you!” Chloe said indignantly.

“Whether you look down on me or are deliberately trying to break me and Edward up, you know that very well. I don’t want to waste my breath with you here, but I will say one last thing. When you leave here in three days, you best not do anything for the next three years. Otherwise, no one can protect you.”

“Protect me? When have you protected me?” Chloe sneered. “You can’t wait for me to leave because you’re afraid I’ll snatch your position. Ever since we were young, you’ve known that men like me more, so you’re also afraid that Edward would fall for me! Candice, I know exactly what you’re thinking.”

“I know exactly what you’re thinking.” Candice said coldly, “But before you do it, Chloe, you’d better think about how much you’re worth.”

“If you can do it, why can’t I? How am I worse than you?” Chloe did not want to hide her true feelings anymore.

She did not want to play any games with Candice. If everyone wanted to shed all pretense of cordiality, so be it.

“If it weren’t for you, I would’ve married Edward! If not for you, all the glory would be mine! It was you who stole everything from me. Even if I want to snatch it back now, it’s not wrong.”

“Your mistake is that you don’t know your limits,” Candice said nonchalantly to Chloe.

At that moment, she stopped talking to Chloe, turned around, and left Chloe’s room.

That was all she needed to say. If Chloe wanted to court her own death, so be it. She had no compassion for Chloe as a family at all. Deep in her heart, she felt like they were just strangers.

When Candice returned to her room, she lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling in a daze.

In the end, she could not be as indifferent about it as she wanted to be.

Although she was not overly sad about it — after all, she already knew that Edward had no feelings for her, and she was actually holding back her feelings for him — she was just a little disappointed.

If he had made it clear from the beginning, even if she could not accept it, at least she would not have felt cheated or been so silly as to go to the hospital for a checkup to see if there was something wrong with her body. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Now that she thought about it, she felt that she was being too conceited.

Chloe looked at Candice’s cold back and felt like she was going to go crazy from anger..
