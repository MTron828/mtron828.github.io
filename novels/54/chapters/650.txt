“Yeah.” Monica nodded.

Jeanne said, “I didn’t think you would believe me now, but I told you all that so that you’ll pay more attention to Michael. You must do that. Monica, I warned you before. Whether Michael is good to you or not, you must be wary of him. I wasn’t joking with you.”

“I know you weren’t, but Michael–”

“Let’s test Michael,” Jeanne suddenly suggested.

Monica was shocked. “What do you mean?”

“Let’s test whether Michael is a good person or not,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

She admitted that she had not cared enough about the matter between Monica and Michael.

Firstly, she had not expected Monica to divorce Dr. Jones for Michael and had underestimated Michael’s status in Monica’s heart. Therefore, when she realized the severity of the situation, there was nothing she could do. She could only let Monica go on.

Secondly, she did not know what kind of person Michael was. She asked Kingsley to help her investigate that person. She did not know if Kinglsey did not take it to heart or if he did not find anything, but she could not find anything that she could use on Michael. As such, she could not determine whether Michael was good or bad and decide for Monica.

However, now that Michael, Finn, and Monica were trending on the internet, she could conclude that Michael did not have good intentions.

If Michael were a good person, he would not have allowed Dr. Jones’s reputation to be trampled by the public.

In the end, Dr. Jones could be considered Michael’s benefactor.

Dr. Jones was the one who suffered the most in the relationship, so Michael should be grateful instead of taking revenge on him.

That was why Jeanne could confirm that Michael was not a good person!

Since he was not a good person, Monica should not be with him, no matter how much he loved him!

After all, it was easy for a bad person to do anything for their own goals. They could do anything to anyone!

“Monica,” Jeanne called out to her.

Monica, who had been quiet for a long time, bit her lip. “How do we test him?”

Even though she did not believe Michael was the kind of person Jeannie was talking about, she would still listen to Jeannie.

The two of them grew up together, and Jeannie would not harm her.

Moreover, testing Michael would not cause any harm to him.

“First of all, let Michael settle this trending news immediately. Let’s see whether he’ll immediately get someone to remove it from the trending list, or he’ll only take it down from the trending list a long time after he agreed to you.” Jeanne added, “And I have to remind you that, with Michael’s current ability, it’s very easy for him to make trending news disappear. You don’t have to think you’ll be putting him in a difficult position.”

“Okay,” Monica agreed immediately.

“Secondly, tell Michael that you love Dr. Jones very much, but now that you and Dr. Jones are drifting further apart from each other, you’re afraid that he’ll leave you. So, you plan to use your body to gain Dr. Jones’s trust.”

Monica was a little surprised.

She had never thought she would have to go so far this time to persuade Finn to stay.

When she first chose to get a divorce, the doctor said that Finn was in poor health and that they could not sleep together.

However, she later bumped into Finn and a prostitute…

That time, Finn also rejected her initiative, so she did not think about it.

Now that Jeanne said it…

“I’m only asking you to test Michael and not for you to really do it.” Jeanne could immediately see through Monica’s thoughts. “Even if you’re naked on Dr. Jones’s bed now, he won’t even look at you. Don’t go and humiliate yourself.”

Monica pouted.

When she thought of Finn’s rejection of her that night, she thought Jeanne was right.

“After you tell Michael your thoughts, see if Michael will do anything. If he tries to persuade you or even stop you from doing it, perhaps he will secretly do something that won’t allow you to devote yourself to Dr. Jones. What do you think that means?”

“It means Michael doesn’t want me to get back together with Finn,” Monica blurted out.

“You’re not that stupid, after all.”

However, Monica did not think Michael would do that.

“So Monica, whether Michael is just asking you to help him or using this method to separate you and Dr. Jones, you can see his true intention through those two tests!” Jeanne said with certainty.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
