1369 I Love You More Than You Think

Candice lay in Edward’s arms, and her entire body was soft as he hugged her. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Neither of them spoke as the wind blew the curtains, allowing sunlight to shine through the gaps, illuminating the peace in the room.

Was that what people meant by time passing by peacefully?

Candice suddenly had a feeling that she would be here forever. She really wanted to lie quietly on the bed and stay by that man’s side until the end of time.

She realized that, at the end of the day, she liked him. It did not take much time, and they had only met a few times, yet she had fallen in love with Edward so easily.

Was it because he was too charming, or was it because she fell in love too easily?

She did not think that those were important anymore because even in a political marriage, love could exist. However, she did not know if she should feel lucky it happened.

Outside the room, a young girl’s voice suddenly rang out, and it was accompanied by the knocking on the door. “Daddy, are you sleeping in?”

It was Paige.

Candice moved instinctively and wanted to get up.

Even though she wanted time to freeze and forever stay at that most perfect moment of her life, because of Paige’s appearance, her peace was disrupted.

She did not know if Edward had that magical power or if it was in all of Edward’s genes, but anyone related to Edward could have a huge impact on her life.

Candice was about to get up when someone hugged her even tighter, obviously stopping her from getting up.

It was as if… he missed the fact that they could hug each other so quietly without anyone disturbing them.

“It’s Paige.” Candice reminded him.

She knew he loved his daughter very much and that he would grant all her requests. However, at that moment, he was indifferent to Paige’s shout and even deliberately ignored her.

The man on the bed was really an *sshole.

When she thought of Paige’s pitiful little face guarding the door, she could not bear it, yet he could ignore it.

Just as Candice was feeling all sorts of guilt, she heard Teddy’s voice from outside the door. “Paige, why are you here?”

“I’m here to wake Daddy up,” Paige answered.

“Your dad and mom are still sleeping. Can you not disturb them?” Teddy coaxed her gently.

“But Daddy and Mommy have been asleep for so long. I want them to accompany me.” Paige was obviously unhappy.

“They’re very tired from last night. That’s why they’ve been sleeping for so long. Let them rest for a while more, okay?”

“Why are they so tired?” Paige asked curiously.

“Uh...” Teddy, who was outside the door, was put in a difficult position.

He probably did not know how to answer.

“Teddy, why are Daddy and Mommy so tired? What did they do last night?” It was a child’s nature to be more curious the more he did not answer.

“Doing… adult things.”

“What is it?”

“Many things. You’ll know when you grow up.” Teddy played dumb.

He really did not know how to explain it to a three-year-old child. However, now that he said it out loud, he felt extremely awkward.

His face was flushed red.

“Is it about making babies?” Paige seemed to have suddenly thought of something, and the moment she said it, her soft and sweet voice was filled with excitement.

Teddy was stunned.

What he could not say, Paige blurted out. It was originally a simple explanation, but he made it sound so complicated.

Teddy nodded. “Yes, it’s about making babies.”

“Am I going to be an elder sister?” Paige was very excited.

Teddy was speechless. How was he supposed to answer that?

“Isn’t that right, Teddy?” When Paige did not get an answer, she asked him again seriously.

“That’ll depend on whether your father works hard enough,” Teddy explained.

“Can I be a sister only if Daddy works hard?” Paige asked innocently.

“I guess so,” Teddy said awkwardly.

He was at a loss as to how to explain that to a three-year-old child.

“In that case, I must make Daddy work harder. I want to have a younger sister tomorrow.” Paige said firmly.

Not even a rocket ship could take her to the moon by tomorrow!

“Teddy, let’s not disturb Mommy and Daddy from giving me a sister.” Paige suddenly understood the situation.
