Chapter 1629: Shelly and Nox Come To An Agreement

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She did not cause the matter. She was just a victim. Moreover, she would not do such a thing for Nox because Nox was not worth her throwing away her reputation.

“Shelly!” Nox gritted his teeth.

Shelly was determined. “This is between you and Zoe. It has nothing to do with me. I don’t agree with what you just said.” “Do you think I can’t get you to agree?”

Shelly’s expression darkened.

‘You bought this place you’re living in now with Zoe’s money, didn’t you? And you paid for your daughter’s surgery with the money I gave you, right? Everything you have now was given to you by me. Since I can give it to you, I can take it all back. Don’t underestimate me!” Nox threatened.

Shelly really wanted to laugh.

She said, “Nox, why don’t you treat Zoe as ruthlessly as you are with me? If you had been more careful with Zoe, you wouldn’t have been cuckolded by her and forced into a difficult spot now.”

“I don’t need you to point fingers at me.” Nox said fiercely, “Your only choice now is to help me clear my name!”

Shelly looked at Nox coldly and saw the determination on his face.

“What about the benefits?” Shelly compromised because Nox was right— he could make her lose everything.

In fact, it did not matter if she had nothing. However, with her current situation, the cost of Bella’s follow-up treatment was still very high, and she could not afford to piss Nox off. As the so-called living class of the poor, she did not even have the right to choose.

“Shelly, you’re so realistic,” Nox mocked. “I have to give myself something.”

“How much?” Nox said bluntly.

He was certain that Shelly wanted money. Therefore, he did not need to feel guilty. It was a fair trade. Perhaps Shelly was eager to use this method to get more money.

“I don’t want money anymore.” Shelly suddenly refused.

Nox frowned.

“After I help you this time, just don’t come looking for me again.” Shelly enunciated each word.

Upon hearing that, Nox’s expression changed again. He probably did not expect Shelly to want him to get lost instead of wanting his money.

He clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth, “Shelly, you’d better think carefully before negotiating with me.”

“I’ve thought it through very carefully. As long as you promise not to look for me in the future and deliberately make things difficult for me, I’ll help you.” Shelly was determined.

Nox was so angry that his body was trembling. “Shelly, I’ll ask you again. Are you sure—”

“I’m very sure!” Shelly’s determination was frightening.

“You said it yourself! Don’t even think about getting a single cent from me in the future!”

“Alright.” Shelly agreed. “But please keep your word.”

“Do you really think I’d look for you?

“Words are useless. Let’s record it,” Shelly suddenly suggested.

Nox’s expression was extremely cold.

“Since it’s a deal, we have to have proof of it.” Shelly took out her phone and turned on the camera. “I’ll record it in case you, Young Master Winter, forget about it. Then, I can send this recording to remind you.”

Nox glared at Shelly. At that moment, he really wanted to strangle her to death! Shelly, on the other hand, waited for him calmly and did not rush him.

The two of them were in a stalemate for a long time until Shelly said, “If you don’t want to, forget it. At worst, I’ll just have nothing. And if I can’t survive, I’ll bring Bella back to my hometown.”

The so-called hometown was the ravine where she used to live. No matter what, it was impossible for her to starve to death. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Shelly, you better not regret it!” Nox grabbed Shelly’s phone.

Shelly watched as Nox pressed the record button angrily. “From now on, I, Nox, will never look for Shelly again. If I f*cking come looking for her again, I’m no better than a dog!”

After recording, he saved it and threw the phone into Shelly’s hands. He threw it so hard that it hurt when it hit Shelly’s hand.

Benjamin frowned. However, Shelly was used to it. Anyway, Nox had always treated her like that.

She said, “Alright, I’ll do whatever you want me to do to clear your name. I’ll cooperate with you.”

Nox looked at Shelly coldly and said, “Wait for my arrangements!”

After that, he left. His footsteps were firm, and he looked furious.

Shelly watched Nox leave before closing the door and turning around to look at Benjamin, who was silent.

Shelly said, “You know I’m not as good as you think.”

Benjamin remained silent.

“You can leave. I’ll wash the dishes,” Shelly said. She could remain calm even if she encountered a huge problem. “Don’t expect anything from me in the future.

I’m really not a good woman.”

As she spoke, she walked past Benjamin. Then, she went to the dining table and cleaned up the dishes.

She could accept many things calmly. It was the same for Nox and Benjamin. Besides, she was already used to living alone with Bella.

“Shelly.” Benjamin, who was standing not far away from her, looked at her.

However, Shelly did not respond and was busy cleaning up the table.

“My silence isn’t because you’re bad, but because I don’t have the power to help you..”
