Chapter 1406: Are You Saying Zoe Is Lying To Me?

Thank you readers!

Who could imagine that when they were having an affair, they could be so… unsightly?

Monica did not say anything more to Zoe. After all, the two of them were not really friends. They were just connected through Nox.

“I’ll be leaving now,” Monica said.

“Alright, I’ll ask Nox. I’m leaving too.”

Monica nodded and went back to her car with Brandon.

“From your perspective as a bystander, do you think those two were just friends or colleagues?” Monica suddenly asked.

“No, they’re not,” Brandon said bluntly.

Therefore, her senses were right.

“I know that man,” Brandon added. “He’s the young master of the Kelda Corporation, and he doesn’t do his job properly. He likes to fool around with women the most. Usually, women who are seen with him have no ordinary relationship with him.”

Monica nodded her head as she finally understood the situation.

Brandon did not say anything else either. Some things, especially between an adult man and woman, did not have to be said out loud.

“Monica.” In private, Brandon would still call her by her name.

“Hmm?” Monica looked at him in surprise.

“If you’re not feeling well, don’t come to work tomorrow.” Brandon said, “I’ll look for you if there’s anything.”

Monica frowned.

“You didn’t even drink much today, yet your face is so pale.” Brandon realized that she wasn’t in a good state tonight.

She also found it a little strange. Logically speaking, she should not have such a huge reaction to alcohol no matter what. Perhaps she was really a little too tired.

She said, “Okay. Call me tomorrow if you need anything.”

She figured she had reached the age where she should cherish her body. She had been feeling unwell for the past few days, and her stomach felt sour, which made her wonder if she had caught a cold.

She then got out of the car and walked straight into the elevator. After thinking about it, she gave Nox a call.

The phone rang for a long time before the call connected. When the call connected, the other party sounded out of breath. “What’s up? Do you want to return to Finn’s side?”

Monica rolled her eyes. Sometimes, she really felt that Nox did not need anyone’s sympathy and that he deserved to be played.

“Where are you now?”

“I’m at Finn’s house. I just put him to bed. If you want to come over, hurry up. I’ll leave the door open for you.”

“I’m calling to say that I saw Zoe just now,” Monica said bluntly.

However, she did not see, or rather recognize Shelly as Shelly had her back to her and was in uniform.

Nox frowned. “Where did you see her?” “In the restaurant we had dinner.”

“Oh,” Nox responded with a simple answer.

“She was with a man,” Monica said.

“A man? Who was it?” Nox asked casually.

“I think he’s the young master of Kelda Corporation.”

“Such a small company is not worth my attention.”

“Is that all you’re thinking about?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

She really admired Nox for being so simple-minded.

“What are you trying to say?” Of course, Nox also noticed something strange about Monica’s comment. “Do you think Zoe is cheating on me?”

Monica did not know what to say, but she was glad he knew.

“You’re overthinking it.” Nox denied it. “I know what kind of person she is.”

Monica was speechless.

At that moment, the elevator arrived. As she walked into the house, she reminded Nox, “Nox, Zoe told you she was having dinner with her colleagues tonight.”

For a moment, Nox was stunned.

“The restaurant we were eating at tonight is so expensive that no matter how rich the Sullivan

Group is, they won’t be willing to let their employees eat there.”

“Are you saying Zoe is lying to me?”

“I’m just a messenger.”

“F*ck”‘

Nox hung up the phone abruptly, and Monica also put down her phone.

She figured she had told him everything she needed to. As for the truth, Nox should be the one to find out.

After that, Monica walked straight into the bathroom, leaned close to the toilet bowl, and threw up. She felt awful.

She had only drunk a little tonight, but her stomach was reacting so badly to it that she was a little frightened. Even after a while, she did not feel any better. She even retched a little.

In the bathroom, she squatted and held her stomach tightly. Suddenly, an ominous premonition made her face, which was originally red from throwing up, instantly turn pale!.
