Chapter 369: The Accident Is Just the Start

Instead of answering, Finn asked casually, “Do I need to be vaccinated against rabies?”

“Am I a f*cking dog to you?” Monica suddenly shouted.

Everyone in the emergency and trauma department looked at Monica. Now they all knew she was the one who bit him.

At that moment, Monica was on the verge of breaking down.

All she knew was that she had never had a good day when she was with Finn.

“Ahem.” Finn coughed lightly, and everyone quickly averted their gazes.

Monica wanted to dig a hole in the ground and bury her head in it.

“Has Mrs. Jones been bitten by dogs or other animals in the past? Has she been vaccinated against rabies?” the doctor asked.

Monica’s face was stern. “No, I’ve never been bitten by a dog.”

“In that case, there’s no need,” the doctor said. “I’ll help you clean up the wound and stitch it up here.”

“Okay.” Finn nodded.

The doctor was then going to give Finn an anesthetic.

“No need. I can take the pain,” Finn refused.

......

The doctor frowned at his reply.

Finn simply said, “Just stitch it up.”

The doctor was a little surprised. Finn did not even blink when he told the doctor to stitch it up.

Monica, too, was a little shocked as she watched from the side. She thought, ‘Damn. Who are all these people around me?’

Jeannie seemed different from ordinary people, but Finn, that *sshole, did not seem simple either.

While she was lost in her thoughts, Finn’s bite mark had been treated, so he said to Monica, “Let’s go.”

Monica glanced at Finn and then supported herself on her crutches, not letting Finn touch her.

With that, the two of them returned to Finn’s car. Even then, Monica turned her head to the car window as if she did not want to talk to Finn.

Neither did Finn say much as they quietly drove home in the car.

When the car stopped in front of a traffic light, Finn looked at the red light and waited while Monica looked out the window and at the cars coming and going on the streets of South Hampton City.

Then, her expression changed drastically.

That was because she saw a black off-road vehicle suddenly driving crazily toward them. It was heading in their direction, but it did not stop.

“Ah!” Monica screamed.

She watched helplessly as the car showed no signs of slowing down at all and was directly speeding at them.

She really did feel… that she was going to die in the next second. She was going to be crushed to death.

At that moment, she could only react by screaming.

As soon as the black car crashed into them, Monica felt her seatbelt suddenly tighten fiercely. In an instant, she felt the sky darken as the car spun around.

The black car crashed into the rear of their car.

Even though it only hit a small part of the car, the impact sent them skidding quite a distance away.

Monica was frightened to her core at how she almost lost her life!

She gritted her teeth and was about to pull out her seatbelt to teach the reckless driver a lesson when she suddenly heard Finn’s urgent and cold voice shouting, “Monica, sit tight!”

Finn’s shouting startled Monica. Before she could react, Finn stepped on the accelerator and rushed out.

At the same time, the car that hit them also followed their car and quickly chased after them.

Monica looked at the car behind them and then at Finn, who seemed like he had suddenly changed into a different person. Only then could she figure out what was happening!

Hence, she did not dare to make any more noise at that moment. She just sat quietly in the passenger seat, feeling the crazy speed Finn was driving at.

It was like that the last time she sat in Jeanne’s car, and this time, it was no different.

Now that something bad was happening to her again, was she the unlucky one, or were they the unlucky ones?

She gritted her teeth, and her heart was at her throat.

She did not know whether Finn’s driving skills were good, but she saw that the cars behind them were in hot pursuit.

At that moment, the traffic on the street was thrown into chaos because of the sudden racing.

Monica was so scared just by looking at the cars around her. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At that moment, Finn was going in the opposite direction.

There were so many cars coming and going. If he was not careful… Monica did not have a good feeling about it.

When she saw Finn’s serious and cold expression, she knew they were in a dangerous situation.

“Call Nox,” Finn suddenly said.

He ordered Monica only after he slowed down a little.

With that, Monica quickly took out her phone.
