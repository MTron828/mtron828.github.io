She said, “If there are no other questions, I’ll take my leave.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In other words, even if he died of anger right now, it would have nothing to do with her because she did not care about him at all.

“Shelly!” Nox suddenly grabbed her arm.

Shelly felt that if she had learned a bit of self-defense, she could have kicked Nox away.

“You wanted to marry me so much back then, and no matter how I chased you away, you refused to leave. Who would believe you now that you say you have no feelings for me? Are you deliberately taking revenge on me?” Nox argued, “You are taking revenge on me on purpose. You’re taking revenge on me for all the harm I’ve done to you. That’s why you didn’t tell me that Zoe was cheating on me. You just don’t want me to live a good life.”

Yes, she could not deny that she had such intentions. However, that was only when Nox came to annoy her, and she hated him.

She said, “I wanted to marry you before because I felt that the Winters could give me wealth and glory. I wanted to strive for a more luxurious life in the future, so I worked harder. However, when I realized that it was not possible, I let go of the idea, and it really wasn’t because of feelings. As for you saying that I’m taking revenge on you on purpose, I’m not taking revenge on you. I just hope that you can get married soon and stop pestering me.”

“Shelly!” Nox was about to explode from anger.

If she could compromise a little and give him a way out, he could allow her to return to his side! Could she not see what he was thinking?

“Personally, I don’t think many women will like you. After all, your personality is very unlikeable, and most of the women who are willing to be with you are greedy for your money. I am, Zoe is, and all the women who get close to you in the future should be.” Shelly looked serious. “I advise you not to be too serious about your relationship in the future. Otherwise, you’ll be hurt again, and I don’t know how bad it will be.”

Nox really wanted to bring Shelly down with him.

At that point, Shelly felt that although Nox was angry, he should believe what she said about having no feelings for him and would not come looking for trouble for no reason in the future.

Then, she left without even bothering to inform Nox as she felt that there was no need. In any case, it was better for two people who did not have a good relationship to forget about each other and pretend that they had never known each other.

With that, she turned around and left.

Nox did not stop her this time. Instead, he shouted at her back, “Shelly, if you leave now, it’ll be impossible for us to be together in the future. Don’t even think about coming back to me. Even if you come back to me for money, I won’t give you a chance. I mean what I say…”

Before he could finish his sentence, the door to the emergency stairway closed.

Shelly had left without hesitating or feeling threatened by him.

Nox kicked the wall hard until his feet were swollen. At that moment, he was so angry that he could kill someone.

He swore he would never look for Shelly again. In the future, even if Shelly kneeled in front of him and begged him, he would not spare a glance at that woman!

He opened the security door and walked out angrily. Just as he walked out, he suddenly collided head-on with someone.

“Don’t you have eyes?” Nox roared at the passersby.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t do it on purpose.” Benjamin quickly apologized.

The moment Benjamin lifted his head and Nox saw him, Nox paused for a moment. He wondered why the guy look so familiar and where he had seen him before.

Benjamin could not help but ask, “Are you here to see Shelly’s daughter too?”

“Who are you?” Nox asked directly.

Benjamin was stunned again. Did Nox not recognize him?

“I’m asking you. Who are you?” Nox was furious.

Shocked, Benjamin quickly answered, “Benjamin. I fought with Shelly in high school, and you came to avenge her. In the end, you told me to pursue Shelly.”

That was why he was wondering why that man was so unpleasant to the eye. It turned out he was that damn brat who kissed Shelly back then!

“Are you here to see Shelly’s daughter?” Benjamin asked.

Nox finally remembered.

“Am I crazy to come to see her?” Nox’s face turned dark..
