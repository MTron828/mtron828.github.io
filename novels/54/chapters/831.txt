Chapter 832: Successful Escape: Letting Go To Stay Alive

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In fact, the moment she took the initiative to reach out, she thought she would die. Hence, she would not blame Kingsley for not saving her.

Since Kingsley had brought her back from the gates of hell six years ago, all she felt for him was gratitude and no resentment.

She accepted all the decisions he made.

On the edge of the cliff, where the wind was blowing gently, Edward was silent for a few seconds because of what Kingsley said.

“I’m sorry, Jeanne,” he said slowly.

At that moment, Jeanne could even feel Edward pulling her back.

However, they were already standing at the edge of the cliff. No matter how small their steps were, they would fall off the cliff in less than five steps.

Under Edward’s control, she took a step back with him.

One step, two steps, three steps, four steps…

“If there’s a next life, I would’ve never left that night seven years ago,” Edward mumbled in her ear.

He was talking about the night she climbed into his bed seven years ago.

If he did not leave early, he would not have allowed her to leave South Hampton City, and she would not have suffered so much overseas. Furthermore, she would not have returned to the Hills, and they would not be enemies now.

If only…

There were no ‘ifs’ in this world.

Edward was the one who chose to abandon her that night, and she was destined to pay a painful price for leaving that night.

By the fifth step, one of Edward’s legs was already in the air.

Despite that, he did not show any signs of letting go of Jeanne. He was about to fall and would take her with him.

The two of them would die here.

Just then, Kingsley said, “I’ll let you go!”

At that critical moment, he still compromised.

Jeanne looked at Kingsley, who suppressed his rage and said word by word, “I’ll let you go!”

It was not a compromise with Edward. It was his reluctance to part with Jeanne.

Jeanne’s eyes were a little red.

Kingsley had probably never been threatened like that in his life, so she could totally imagine how much he was fighting the urge to kill Edward by agreeing to Edward’s request.

Edward put his leg, which was in mid-air, on the ground.

He had won his bet again by making use of Kingsley’s feelings for Jeanne. It was not a glorious victory, but that was reality.

In the face of life and death, one could do many despicable things.

Then, he looked at Nox and said, “Give me a gun.”

Only then did Nox come to his senses.

He was really shocked by the scene in front of him because he did not expect Edward to save himself in such a way.

He had always thought that Edward loved Jeanne so much that he could not bear to hurt her.

Yet, Edward threatened Kingsley with the idea of jumping to his death with Jeanne, which must have had a certain impact on her.

Saving Edward and being used by Edward were two different things.

However, Nox did not care what Jeanne was thinking now or how much she hated Edward. Why the hell would he care about Jeanne, the person whom Edward was doing all that for?

Nox stepped forward and passed Edward a gun.

Edward quickly grabbed the gun with his hand that was around Jeanne’s neck and pointed it at her head.

Jeanne was trying to suppress her emotions.

Edward did not care about Jeanne’s feelings. He forced Jeanne to leave the cliff step by step with him. Under the Nox and Finn’s cover, they slowly walked passed Kingsley.

Jeanne wondered how Edward could walk. After all, his body was weak, and there was a bullet in his leg. How much willpower did he have to be able to walk so steadily?

However, she was also thinking about how to kill Edward the next time she faced him.

With that, a group of them returned to the forest.

Both sides were on high alert, and no one dared to relax for a second. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Edward led the way with Jeanne in his arms while Finn and Nox raised their guns and pointed them at Kingsley, Mason, and the other assassin, who were closing in on them.

The two opposing parties walked for quite a distance before they arrived back at the helicopter.

“Nox, fly it,” Edward ordered.

Nox glared at Kingsley before he quickly jumped into the helicopter, sat in the cockpit, and started it.

The helicopter’s propeller began to spin.
