1119 The Identity of the Duncans’ Descendent Exposed

Edward also explained his current situation.

Of course, he was not explaining it to Jack but to the person in the helicopter.

Who was in the helicopter? Edward was not sure, but he knew that he needed to put on a show with Kingsley.

The situation remained in a stalemate.

Before they received the order, no one dared to act rashly.

With that, a long time passed. Every minute and second seemed to pass like a year.

In fact, Edward was not confident that the Duncans would let Kingsley go for his sake. After all, it was not easy for them to catch Kingsley. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Kingsley was the Sanders’ biggest helper, and the Hills was one of the main culprits behind the downfall of the Duncans’ political power. No matter what, at that point, they could not let Kingsley go so easily.

Now that the Duncans had already reached the point of a direct conflict with the Sanders, they were prepared for war to break out at any moment.

Once the war broke out, the key to victory was to get rid of all the opponents as quickly as possible.

As such, the Duncans could not bear to let Kingsley go just like that, and that was why the stalemate lasted for so long.

After all, killing Kingsley was important, but the death of Edward would also be a huge loss to the Duncans.

Therefore, they had to weigh whether it was worth it to use Edward to exchange for Kingsley.

At the scene, everyone was in a deadlock until two people suddenly alighted from the helicopter.

Everyone turned to look.

Even Kingsley looked over.

He was wondering whether he would be able to find out who the descendant of the Duncans was before he died.

Just who was it that would make the Swans hide him so well that the Sanders could not find him even if they dug deeper?

However, Kingsley was disappointed.

That was because the person who got off the helicopter was not the descendant of the Duncans.

It was Zachary, who rarely appeared in public in South Hampton City, and Wade, who was always by Zachary’s side.

The two of them walked to Edward and Nox. They were protected by men as they faced Kingsley.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

At that moment, Nox also reacted. He, too, did not expect that it would be Old Master Swan and his grandfather.

Their appearance... might not be a good thing.

Edward and Nox tried their best to remain calm.

“Mr. Thorn,” Zachary said. He did not even look at his son before he started talking to Kingsley.

Kingsley was also calm and composed. He said, “Old Master Swan, I’ve heard so much about you.”

Zachary seemed to be smiling.

He said, “I’ve heard of your existence all these years, but I’ve never met you once. I’ve met your father a few times, though. But I heard that he passed away many years ago.”

“Yes.” Kingsley was still respectful toward Zachary.

No matter what position they were in, some people’s status would make others subconsciously admire them.

“Your father was a hero in battle and had contributed a lot to the Sanders,” Zachary said bluntly and emotionally as if he was stating a fact.

“Back then, you also made a great contribution to the Sanders’ political power, Old Master Swan.” Kingsley also reminded him.

“That is true. I was the one who personally brought the head of the Duncans to the Sanders.” Zachary did not refute.

“I wonder why you have changed his side all these years, Old Master Swan?” Kingsley’s words were a little sarcastic. “To have betrayed your own leader so frequently, I wonder if Old Master Swan feels guilty about it.”

“Mr. Thorn, you should know who I’ve been loyal to from the start.” Zachary’s face darkened.

Kingsley continued to look at him fearlessly.

“The reason why I took down the head of the Duncans was to gain the trust of the Sanders. It was because the situation could no longer be reversed, and there was no way to stop the Sanders from taking power. In order to advance, I could only retreat and personally end the life of the head of the Duncans. Then, I secretly supported the growth of the Duncans’ descendant until the day he could confront the Sanders again.”

Kingsley’s eyes were cold.

Now that Zachary had confessed everything, it did not seem to be a good thing.

After all, once something that was kept a secret was revealed, it would either be because it had reached a point where it could be made public or it was so that one could die in peace.

Kingsley remained calm.

At that moment, he watched as Zachary’s gaze landed on his son.
