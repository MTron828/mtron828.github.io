Chapter 1600: Grand Wedding, Zoe Gets Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox was having a splitting headache.

If he had known earlier, he would have listened to others’ advice instead of allowing himself to do as he pleased and getting himself drunk until he got gastrointestinal bleeding. Otherwise, he would be in his current state, where he would rather die than live.

He stood in front of the sink in the bathroom at 7 a.m. in the morning and looked in the mirror. Seeing how swollen and bloodshot his eyes were, he felt helpless.

As expected, after reaching a certain age, he could not be as spontaneous as before. If not for the fact that he was getting married today, he did not think he would be able to get up.

He recalled that he had only slept for two hours last night. After returning from the hospital, he still could not fall asleep for some reason, even though he was clearly very sleepy. When he finally fell asleep, he felt like he had only slept for a second, and now, he felt awful.

“Young Master!” Outside the door, the servant knocked on the door and urged,

“Hurry up and wash up. The makeup artist has been waiting for a long time.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I know, I know. Why are you rushing me?” Nox asked unhappily. “You can’t be late for your wedding day. Young Master, hurry up.” He already said he knew, yet why was she still rushing him?

Nox immediately dunked his head in the sink filled with cold water. After making sure that he was awake, he raised his head, wiped himself with a towel, and rinsed his mouth. Only then did he walk out of the bathroom, feeling a little more energized.

The staff was already waiting for him in the room. They were standing there with his wedding suit in their hands and were very respectful. With the help of the staff, Nox changed into his suit, styled his hair, trimmed his eyebrows, and cleaned up his face.

By the time Nox was ready to set off, it was close to 9 a.m., and the estimated time he would arrive at the Sullivans’ residence was 10:10 a.m. As there was still time, before Nox left the Winters’ villa, Mrs. Winter even got him to eat something to fill his stomach, which was not feeling great.

Considering he threw up last night, and there was even blood, his stomach had been feeling horrible. Fortunately, he felt a little better after eating something.

“Nox.” Nox’s mother held Nox’s hand. Seeing that he was all grown up, she looked pleased. “Today is your big day. Don’t make any mistakes and do good by Zoe.”

Nox nodded. Looking at his mother’s expectant expression, he felt a little satisfied with himself. At least, many people were happy about his marriage.

“Go ahead,” Mrs. Winter said.

Nox then led a group of escorts to the Sullivans’ residence.

The wedding was very grand. In fact, Nox did not spend too much effort on it. Most of it was handed over to the wedding event company, and he just had to approve the final plan. The wedding was not particularly unique. It was just grand, and everyone knew about it.

The convoy was very long. Of course, unlike Edward’s wedding, there were no rows of cars filled with flowers. Until this day, no one’s wedding had been able to compare to Edward’s wedding back then, let alone top it. Nox, too, sometimes complained that wherever Edward was, he would be always overshadowed by Edward.

In the wedding car, he was holding a bouquet of flowers in his hand as he went to pick up Zoe, and there were at least ten cameras around to broadcast it live to the public.

Nox’s marriage was really high-profile. He thought that since he was getting married, he should announce it to the world. Moreover, he had told the media that if he got married, he would broadcast it live, and now, he had kept his word.

Therefore, from the moment Nox left the house that morning, everything had been broadcast live on the Internet. There were many people watching and many people giving their blessings. It became the hottest news of the day, and the traffic was off the charts.

Even today, the stock prices of the Sullivans and Winters rose to ceiling price as soon as they opened. It was no wonder why so many wealthy families and upper-class families wanted to matchmake their children. It was really a win-win situation.

Shelly was also nervous, so she was sitting outside the operating room, watching the news on Nox’s marriage. Nox was indeed the type of person who would get married in such a high-profile manner.

In the past, although Fourth Master Swan’s wedding and a few other weddings were all eye-catching and even creative, they were not like Nox’s wedding, in which the entire process was directly broadcasted live to make the masses happy.

That was the first time they had seen such famous people getting married, and they all wanted to see how extravagant the so-called wedding could be!

It was also the first time ordinary people could witness what it was like for rich people to get married..
