870 Step by Step, the Proposal

“Dr. Jones,” his assistant suddenly called out to him.

Finn came back to his senses. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He put away his stethoscope and said, “You’re recovering well. Continue to maintain a calm mind. After a heart bypass surgery, the most important thing is to let yourself relax.”

“How much longer do I have to stay in the hospital?”

“According to your current recovery progress, you should be able to be discharged in a week.”

“Okay. Thank you, Dr. Jones.”

“My pleasure.” Finn smiled professionally.

He gave some more medical advice to the patient before leaving the ward. When he left, he raised his head to take a look. On the screen, the two of them were hugging and kissing.

The assistant beside him also glanced at the television screen before quickly following Dr. Jones’s footsteps out.

Speaking of which, back then, Dr. Jones liked Monica, right? If not, why would Dr. Jones, who had always been focused on his work, be in a daze for so long just now?

Finn returned to the office with his assistant. He went on to explain the patient’s related mattersclearly and seriouslyr with no mistakes at all.

The assistant took a look at his notes.

Had he misunderstood? Dr. Jones did not seem to care as much as he thought. Otherwise, how could he have done his work so perfectly? If he really cared, there would be some small mistakes.

The moment the office door closed once his assistant left, Finn’s expression finally turned cold. He pulled out a cabinet beside his desk, took out a document, and threw it directly into the trash can.

The document clearly spelled “Sunny Pharmaceutical”.

Sunny Pharmaceutical, a civilian pharmaceutical company, appeared out of thin air and completely replicated the development of Cardellini Medical Technology. Even their products were the same. In that document was all the research reports on Sunny Pharmaceutical.

There was obviously no need for that now. As long as Michael did not act against Cardellini Enterprise, the company would not be in any danger.

Cardellini Enterprise was an established company in the medical industry. Since it was not targeted by the government, it would not be easily banned.

Since it was so easy for her to compromise, he did not need to waste his energy.

…

Once the press conference was over, Monica left in Michael’s car.

The car was silent as ever. After all, there was no need for Michael to disguise himself in a place where no one was around, and she did not have to play along with him either.

Monica frowned when the car was parked in the Rosses’ courtyard.

“To discuss the wedding,” Michael said bluntly.

Monica gritted her teeth and followed Michael out of the car. The two of them walked into the Rosses’ living room and were greeted there by Reese.

When she saw Michael and Monica, she sneered. She stood up from the sofa and walked towards them.

Just as she arrived in front of Monica, a slap suddenly landed on Monica’s face.

“Smack!”

The speed was so fast that It would have been impossible to guard against.

Monica glared at Reese.

Michael stopped his mother before it could escalate any further. “Mom.”

“Monica, you b*tch. How dare you make my son a cuckold! You even had him clean up your mess too! You b*tch! Who do you think you are?!” Reese cursed.

Monica touched her own cheek. If it were any time in the past, she would have gone crazy and returned the slap.

However, she endured it today.

She said, “I admit that I was in the wrong previously. I accept your slap.”

“B*tch!”

Reese did not seem to have finished venting her anger yet and continued cursing at Monica. Just the thought of what Monica had done during this period made Ruby want to murder her. She could not tolerate Monica treating her son like this!

“Mom, that’s enough!” Michael stopped her. “I brought Monica here today to discuss the wedding. I’m already busy enough. Could you not add to my troubles?”

Monica’s matter had not only had it affected his work, but he also had to deal with the leader’s doubts about him.

No matter what, his personal affairs had taken up too much of his time. Even if he could make the chief believe he was not ambitious, it would still affect his work and the Sanders’ contribution. The other party would not have any objections.

So Reese endured it.

When Michael saw that his mother was calm, he said to Monica, “Come. Let’s sit here.”

Monica pursed her lips and sat down beside Michael.

Michael did not waste any time to get to the matter at hand. “I won’t make the wedding too grand. My status doesn’t allow it,” he said bluntly. “However, I will do all the necessary rituals. As for the wedding photos, I’ve already had some photoshopped. If you think it’s necessary, I can accompany you to take them. However, if you think it’s dispensable, we’ll get it done once I’m done with my work.”
