961 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

“Even if I lie, we’re still friends.” Lucy smiled.

Even though it was just an ordinary gown, it made her look extremely charming with her smile.

Some people were just a natural, and it really had nothing to do with what she wore or how she looked.

Jeanne and Lucy chatted casually.

In fact, both of them were waiting.

Jeanne was waiting for Mason to give her a hint, while Lucy was waiting for an opportunity to approach Kingsley.

The hall was very lively, and everyone was relatively comfortable.

At the end of the day, Kingsley’s birthday party was a disguised opportunity for everyone to relax.

Otherwise, Kingsley would not have had to throw such a grand birthday celebration every year to announce to the world that he had aged another year!

Kingsley was dealing with the many people coming and going. If not for Kingsley’s high alcohol tolerance, he probably would have collapsed by now.

The one who came to propose a toast next was Mac, the aesthetician. He was the one who had helped Lucy with the treatment today.

Kingsley glanced at Mac and then at the other man Mac was holding.

Kingsley did not have much of an impression of him.

Mac quickly said, “This is Weiss. He has only been in the Hills for a year and is now a trauma surgeon.”

Kingsley’s judgment of Weiss was not because he was a stranger. Rather, it was the intimacy between Mac and Weiss.

It was obvious that they were not just friends.

In the Hills, other than the fact that the assassins were not allowed to fall in love, there were no requirements for the staff. Of course, there was a major premise that they were not allowed to get pregnant.

In a place where one could be shot to death at any moment, everyone naturally had to obey that rule.

“We’re a couple.” Mac seemed to have noticed Kingsley’s gaze and explained, “We’ve been together for half a year.

“You’re gay?” Kingsley asked.

Mac admitted, “Since I was young. It is by nature.”

Kingsley nodded, indicating that he understood.

As for Mac, with his status, he did not dare to say too much. Hence, he nudged Weiss, and the two of them raised their glasses together. “Happy Birthday, Mr. Thorn.”

Kingsley nodded, as usual, and then finished the wine in his glass.

Naturally, Mac and Weiss did not leave a single drop behind.

One after another, many people took the initiative to approach Kingsley to toast him. In the end, Kingsley’s face was flushed with the red of alcohol.

That was probably the only day in a year that Kingsley would allow himself to get a little tipsy.

At 10:10 p.m., Jeanne received Mason’s signal.

She turned to look at Lucy, who understood tacitly.

At that, Lucy nodded, picked up her wine glass, and walked toward Kingsley.

Perhaps it was because Lucy had been by Kingsley’s side for too long, but no matter what their relationship was now or how Kingsley had treated Lucy in the past, the others naturally made way for Lucy as soon as she went over.

Millie noticed the scene as well, and she could not hide the unhappiness on her face.

Lucy was already a thing of the past, so why did those people have to be so respectful to her?

“Mr. Thorn.” Lucy raised her glass.

Kingsley looked at her.

Lucy smiled.

When she smiled, she looked really pretty, and there was a feminine charm to her.

“Happy Birthday,” she said in a soft voice.

However, Kingsley did not respond. He just looked at her indifferently.

Then, he looked at her clothes.

Millie looked into Kingsley’s eyes, and her expression turned uglier.

Lucy was dressed so shabbily today, yet he was still looking at her for so long! Most importantly, there was not the slightest look of disdain on his face.

Even though she was dressed like that tonight and had been by his side, he had not looked at her like that, nor did he look at her for too long.

At that moment, almost everyone present was looking at them.

After all, Kingsley was the main character, and he would naturally attract a lot of attention. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, everyone in the hall could see Kingsley’s eyes lingering on Lucy.

‘No,’ Millie thought. Her status could not be threatened in any way.

Suddenly, she twisted her ankle, and her body “accidentally” leaned against Kingsley’s.

One move and Kingsley withdrew his gaze. Then, he reached out and helped Millie up.

Millie quickly whispered, “The heels are too high, and I accidentally–”

She looked embarrassed.

Kingsley did not answer.

Millie, of course, did not dare to push her luck and to hope that Kingsley would say anything to comfort her.
