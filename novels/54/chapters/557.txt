He reached his hand out and touched it lightly.

George saw the dominoes he had arranged for the whole afternoon fall down, one by one, in the shape of a flower.

George turned his head and looked at Nox.

However, Nox did not apologize at all. “Oops. My hand slipped.”

“Childish.” George put down the dominoes in his hand, stood up from the ground, and left.

Nox watched as George’s short legs scuttled upstairs.

After a long time, it only came to him that George called him childish.

He yelled at the stairs, “Who are you calling childish? You fart, you’re the childish one!”

Teddy, who was not far from him, was speechless when he heard Nox.

Whether or not George was childish had nothing to do with Nox!

“What’s the matter? Did George bully you?” A female’s gloating voice suddenly sounded beside his ear.

Nox turned his head to see Monica in front of him and thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.

He could not believe the woman still had the nerve to show up.

Having been pissed off by George, Nox almost could not control himself and wanted to strangle her to death.

“What are you doing here?” Nox shouted at her.

Annoyed by Nox shouting at her, Monica said, “This isn’t your house.”

“Aren’t you supposed to be with Michael? Go back to Michael and don’t come out. You’re hurting my eyes.”

“Nox! How do you have such a bad mouth?” Monica was angry.

“Yours is worse! How much better can you be bragging to the media that Finn didn’t touch you?” Nox had been brooding over that matter for a long time.

Anger was building up in Monica’s chest.

“Hurry up and go to your lover, Michael. Go. I’m afraid I’ll go blind if I see you for another second.”

“F*ck!” Monica was so angry that she wanted to strangle Nox to death.

The guy’s mouth was really poisonous.

She had known him for many years and knew the guy could be harsh with his words. However, hearing him describe her like that made her hopping mad.

“Hurry up and leave,” Nox urged.

Monica was so angry that she really wanted to turn around and leave, but she suddenly stopped and looked at Nox. “You weren’t the one who invited me here. Since you want me to leave, I’m not leaving!”

“...”

“I’m going to look for Jeannie.” As Monica said that, she was about to go upstairs.

Nox grabbed hold of her, and his grip hurt Monica. “You’ve ruined your relationship with Finn, and now you want to ruin Edward’s sex life, huh?”

Nox, in fact, was quite smart.

Seeing that Edward had been up there for a long time and had not come down, any wise person would know what they were up to.

Monica did not react for a while.

“You either sit obediently on the sofa over there and don’t wander around in front of me or leave right now.”

Monica shook Nox’s hand off and sat on the sofa in the living room in a huff.

In the meantime, Nox could not be bothered about Monica either. He was sitting on the floor, looking at the domino he had destroyed, and wondered what was so fun about the game.

Nox picked up a domino out of boredom and played with it idly until he suddenly thought of something.

He quickly took out his phone and typed a message. “We’re having a dinner party at Bamboo Garden tonight. Hurry over.”

“I’m not feeling too well, so I won’t be coming over,” Finn replied.

“It’s been a long time since we’ve gathered together. Don’t try to avoid it. At the same time, let’s celebrate you being single again.”

“There’s really no need.”

“You can’t abandon your brother just because of a woman, right?”

It seemed like Finn really could not avoid it, so he agreed. “Okay.”

In fact, he did not know how to reject Nox’s request, and just like that, Nox’s evil plan succeeded.

Nox turned to look at Monica, who he thought should be taught a lesson.

…

In the living room, Nox had been waiting for a long time and was bored out of his mind.

Did those two have to be so brazen in broad daylight?

Fine. He understood they were newlyweds who had been separated for seven years.

With that, Nox stood up from the floor and walked to the sofa, where he saw Monica sitting on the sofa and texting.

He stretched his neck out to take a look, knowing she was texting Michael, that stud. He said, “If being apart is so hard, why don’t you go back to his side?”

Monica took a look at Nox and ignored him.

She and Michael were just talking about the house.

When she returned to the hotel that afternoon, she thought Michael had gone to work.

After all, he was still in a special situation. Although today’s news had made him famous and won him a lot of votes, it was still a critical period of time that he could not overlook.

However, never did she expect that Michael was looking for a house for her.

He said he was afraid it would be inconvenient for her to stay in the hotel. That went to show how good Michael was to her!

Moreover, the information sent to her about the house was very comprehensive.

He had made sure to find out the house’s condition, the neighborhood, the surrounding buildings, the traffic safety, and even the neighbors for her.

She replied, “This one then.”

“Alright, I’ll look for an intermediary to buy it.”

“How much is it? I’ll transfer the money to you first.”

“It’s a gift from me.”

“No need.”

“It’s to thank you.”

“It’s not necessary.”

After that, there was no reply from the other end.

Hence, Monica quickly called Michael. As soon as the call connected, she said anxiously, “Michael, I’ll buy the house myself.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As soon as she said that, she saw Finn in the living room.
