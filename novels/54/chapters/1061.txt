1062 Crushing Michael (Confirmed To Be A Sc*mbag)

With the current situation in Harken, it was possible that she would come back. However, it was also possible that she would never come back!

He had never been sure about that woman, and he was not the only one. Even Edward could not do anything about it either.

Monica nodded silently. In fact, she had not expected Nox to answer her.

To Nox, if it were not for Jeanne, he would not have come to help Monica.

She asked, “Did you pay for my father’s medical expenses too?”

She suddenly remembered the few million dollars in her father’s hospital account.

“What?” Nox was surprised.

“There was an extra 5 million in my dad’s account. I thought it was you.” Monica added, “Jeanne was the one who told you to do it.”

“You’re overthinking it.” Nox said coldly, “I’m not that good of a person. I won’t do things that others don’t know about.”

“In that case, who could it be?” Monica was a little surprised.

Although Nox would not be so kind, he knew who did it almost instantly. However, he did not tell her.

Finn did not even allow him to help Monica, let alone other things.

Moreover, he really did not want to say it.

Ever since Monica abandoned Finn for a sc*mbag like Michael, his hatred toward Monica was obvious. Therefore, he absolutely could not bring himself to matchmake Monica and Finn.

“The only possibility is Finn,” Monica suddenly muttered.

At that moment, Nox found that Monica was not that stupid.

Even if she was not smart, out of everyone, Monica had only thought of Finn as a suspect.

After all, he was the one who was most likely to know that her father’s medical expenses were about to run out. Furthermore, Finn was indebted to her father, so it made sense for him to fork out some money to treat her father.

“But Finn doesn’t have that much money.” Monica denied her own thoughts.

Nox rolled his eyes. As expected, he could not have any expectations for Monica. However, he did not know why Monica would think that Finn did not have money.

Finn was an invisible billionaire, alright?

The 1 billion that he was giving Monica now all came from Finn. It was all his! Moreover, it was cash and not fixed assets!

Forget it. He felt that he did not need to clear Finn’s name. After all, according to common sense, if Monica knew that Finn was so rich, she might start to pester him again.

He could help Monica, but he would definitely not matchmake her.

Nox did not say anything else and left Cardellini Enterprise’s building.

While driving, he called Finn. “Finn, I’ve already talked to Monica.”

“Thank you.”

“Aren’t you going to ask about the negotiation process?” Nox raised his brows.

Could Finn not be so aloof?

“No, I trust you.”

“Do you trust me or Monica?” Nox said on purpose.

“I trust you both.”

“You trust us both?” Nox’s voice was high. “You actually trust Monica.”

“She has changed a lot.” Finn said bluntly, “You’ll know once you get to know her more.”

“Don’t tell me you have feelings for her again.”

“No, I don’t.” Finn immediately denied it. “I’m only helping her because I owe her father a favor. I can’t just leave her in the lurch.”

“When did you become so kind?” Nox teased.

“A doctor’s duty is to save the dying and heal the injured.”

“Tsk.” Nox clicked his tongue in disdain.

‘You didn’t say anything about saving the dying and healing the injured when you were killing people.’

He could not be bothered to expose Finn, so he told the latter his arrangements, “I’ll go and investigate Cardellini Enterprise’s traitor first. I should be able to get the results soon because we’ve already locked on to the person. He’s Michael’s distant cousin.”

Finn listened in silence.

“Don’t you think Monica is stupid? She’s the reason for everything that has happened to Cardellini Enterprise,” Nox mocked.

“Without Monica, Cardellini Enterprise would have gone through it sooner or later. Finn was straightforward.

“Are you siding with her?”

“I just know Michael’s motive very well,” Finn explained. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Nox rolled his eyes and continued, “Since we know who the traitor is, the rest will be easy to handle. In about a week, I’ll get all the evidence. After I get the evidence, I’ll use some connections to speed up the trial of the Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s vaccine and publicly announce Sunny Pharmaceutical’s theft of Cardellini Enterprise’s confidential information in court.”

“The court is also under the Sanders,” Finn reminded Nox.

“I’ll find a way to make the trial public.”
