1289 Candice’s Identity Revealed

He gulped and watched as Monica walked into the bathroom. Then, the sound of the shower was heard.

Finn put down his book.

Now that it had come to this, how could he still hold it in?!

He sat at the head of the bed and waited for her.

When she came out of the shower, her face was rosy and she was wearing a white bathrobe while wiping her wet hair. Seeing that Finn was still awake, she felt a little strange.

“Don’t doctors have to be in their best condition at work? Aren’t you going to work tomorrow?”

“I’m waiting for you to sleep with me,” Dr. Jones said bluntly.

It was just one sentence but Monica seemed to understand.

Thinking about it carefully, it seemed like they had not done it for two days.

As they were both busy, sometimes they seemed to be in a hurry to just get into bed.

She quickly put down the towel in her hand and crawled under the blanket.

Finn’s heart was still beating wildly because of Monica’s proactive approach.

Actually, he had never thought of doing it in the beginning. He was genuinely just waiting for her.

Perhaps it was because Nox’s words today had affected him a little, so he wanted to express his feelings to Monica more clearly. However, he did not expect to be seduced by Monica so easily.

Finn was carrying Monica in her arms. As usual, the two of them quickly entwined with each other.

They quickly separated again and fell asleep quietly.

Early the next morning, Monica opened her eyes.

Usually, when he was not in the emergency ward, she would wake up at about the same time as him.

When she did not see him today, she thought that he had left the hospital for an emergency.

She was actually used to it.

She slowly got out of bed, brushed her teeth, changed her clothes, and put on her makeup.

When she walked out of the bedroom, she saw Finn wearing an apron as she prepared two portions of breakfast.

“Are you awake? It’s still early. Have breakfast before you go to work,” he greeted her first.

Monica had a feeling that Finn was having a seizure.

The two of them had been together for so many years, but they had never seen him take the initiative like this.

She lowered her head and looked at the time. After confirming that it was still early, she sat down at the dining table and ate breakfast with him.

“Is it to your liking?” Finn asked. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It’s quite delicious,” Monica replied.

There was really nothing wrong with it, but there was no surprise.

It was Finn after all.

The two of them had been together for more than three years. There was nothing wrong with picking on him. He was responsible and gentle toward her. He would never stop her from doing anything. The two of them were also very harmonious with each other. At least for the past three years, they never quarreled once. They just lived together in peace. Of course, Finn could not do anything earth-shattering.

The days between them were really as quiet as still water.

After breakfast, Monica reapplied her lipstick.

Then, he received a call. She glanced at it and said, “Lee.”

It was her driver.

“I’m sorry, Chairman. My baby has a fever and it’s still quite serious. I want to send the baby to the hospital first. See if you’re in a hurry. If you’re in a hurry, I’ll contact the other drivers in the company to drive you. I’m really sorry…”

“It’s alright.” Monica quickly comforted, “Go take care of your baby first. I’ll drive myself to work.”

“Thank you, Chairman. I’ll take my leave first.”

“Mm,” Monica replied.

She put on her lipstick and saw that Finn had also changed his clothes and was ready to go out.

She thought for a moment. “Are you busy today?”

“Not really,” Finn said. “What’s wrong?”

“The driver called just now and said there was an emergency at home and left. Is it convenient for you to give me a ride?”

“Okay,” he agreed immediately.

This was actually the first time in three years that Finn had sent Monica to work.

The two of them walked into the garage and got into his car.

His driving speed was still the same. It was neither fast nor slow. It was very steady.

Monica sat in the passenger seat and took out her phone. She was engrossed in reading the sales data from yesterday.

Finn let her be.

It was very quiet in the car.

In silence, Monica suddenly said, “Please stop at the intersection ahead.”

Finn was surprised, but still did as he was told.

Monica opened the car door and got out.

He saw Monica walking into a pharmacy in front of her.

...

Finn frowned.

Was Monica sick?!

Even if she was sick, she should not take medicine casually.

He quickly pressed the hazard light button, opened the car door, and followed her in.

The moment he walked in, he saw that Monica had already paid for a box of medicine.

The staff handed her a cup of warm water. She opened the medicine box and took out the pill inside. Then, she mixed it with warm water and swallowed it.

The moment she threw away the disposable cup and the medicine packaging, she realized that Finn was standing behind her.

She was a little shocked. “Why did you come with me?”

His eyes were fixed on the box that she had thrown into the trash can beside her. On the box were the words “Emergency Contraceptive Pills”.

Monica did not notice his gaze. She had already walked out of the pharmacy and into the car.

She always had ample amount of time to get to work but now that Finn was sending her to work, she appeared to be in a hurry.

...

She figured that there had never been a doctor as dedicated as Dr. Jones who was never tardy with his working hours.

Monica sat in the passenger seat while Finn returned to the driver’s seat.

The car drove steadily on the street.

There was still no word in the car.

Until…

“Do you take that every time?” Finn suddenly asked.

Monica was still processing the internal documents to be approved on her phone. When she heard him, she was a little surprised, “What?”

“I said, do you take the pill every time?”

“Oh.” Monica nodded. “I don’t usually take it during the safe period. Only during the ovulation period.”

No wonder.

After so many years, they actually did not have any children.

He thought that there might be something wrong with their bodies and was still wondering when he could find a reason to let them have their body checkups.

It seemed that he was overthinking.

He said, “Don’t you want a baby?”

Monica’s fingers paused as she processed the documents. She asked, “Do you want it?”

Finn pursed his lips.

If he did not then why did he not use any protection?

Should a precaution be done by the man?!

Before he could answer, Monica said straightforwardly, “I’ve never thought about it.”

He fell silent and she did not say more.

She turned her attention back to her work again.

They eventually arrived at Cardellini Pharmaceuticals.

Monica took off her seatbelt and said, “Thank you.”

She seemed very polite. Finn watched as she opened the car door and prepared to leave.

“Monica,” Finn suddenly called out.

“Yes?”

“If you don’t want a child, you could’ve told me earlier. I can use contraceptives,” Finn said.

“It doesn’t matter which one of us does it. Medicine is very advanced now. The contraceptive pills have no effect on the body. It’s the same for me,” Monica said frankly.

She did not seem to think that it was something worth talking about.

“Be careful on the road,” Monica reminded him casually and closed the car door for him.

“I want a baby,” Finn suddenly uttered as the car door shut.
