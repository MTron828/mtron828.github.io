Chapter 491: Jasmine’s Tragic Downfall

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Eden had been suppressing his emotions the entire time, so when he heard Jeanne’s words, his expression darkened.

Even though he admitted that Jeanne had fallen in love with his Fourth Uncle, he still could not accept the fact that Jeanne had no feelings for him anymore. He had always thought Jeanne was just too arrogant and self-righteous and that she was head over heels for him back then. That was why she humiliated him so much. Hence, he believed that Jeanne regretted it. If she had been able to calm down back then, he would have married her.

Yet now, he had to admit that Jeanne really did not have any feelings for him.

If she did, she would not have watched him marry another woman. Even though she had that video, which could have stopped him from getting married to Jasmine, she still allowed him to.

It was because she did not care anymore!

Eden was so angry that his veins were popping.

His anger was not only fueled by Jasmine bruising his ego as a man, but it was also because Jeanne looked down on him.

She hated him to the core.

Nevertheless, he endured it.

Jeanne did not care about what Eden was thinking at that moment. She just stared at Jasmine and said, “In that case, tell me. Why didn’t I take revenge on you guys before? Why did I have to take revenge on you guys now?”

“Y-You...”Jasmine could not say it because she made it all up, and at that moment, she could not think of anything else.

Jeanne said, “If you confess, Jasmine, we’ll put an end to this matter.”

“Put an end to it?” Jasmine sneered, and her expression looked unusually vicious. “Can I still put an end to this matter?”

......

“I’m talking about me. I don’t want to waste any more time on you. As for you and the fact that you cheated on Eden, that is your family matter. That is not something that I care about.”

Jasmine glared at Jeanne’s smug face!

She would rather die than admit what happened yesterday was her false accusation.

Jeanne did not seem to have any patience left. “In fact, there’s no need for you to admit it. Facts speak louder than words. I believe everyone already knows the truth of this matter. Since that’s the case, I won’t waste more of anyone’s time.”

Jeanne appeared to be calm.

From the start to the end, her expression was the same. She was neither too calm nor too anxious when she humiliated each one of them who was against her.

Then, she looked at Old Master Swan respectfully. “Dad, I’m sorry to have wasted your precious time.”

“You’re not the one who has wasted my time.” Old Master Swan was still looking at Jeanne.

With a smile, Jeanne turned around and walked toward Edward.

Just now, she still had that domineering look on her face, and her aura was intimidating everyone before her. However, the moment she returned to Edward’s side, she instantly kept her powerful aura and stood by his side meekly like a little woman. When she was with Edward, she looked so friendly and warm.

She said, “Let’s go.”

In return, Edward smiled dotingly. He was cold to everyone except Jeanne. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With that, the two of them left composedly, leaving behind a pile of rubbish.

Old Master Swan also did not have the patience to stay with them anymore, so he said coldly, “Don’t cause a ruckus in my home! Settle this matter by yourselves and report to me the results of your decision!”

After that, he left the hall with Wade.

Only Henry’s, Elaine’s, Richard’s, and Alexander’s families were left in the hall.

Richard had never interfered with other people’s matters, so he left with Grace.

On the other hand, Elaine had no choice but to vent a few words because of the grievance she had suffered today.

She said to Henry, “I listened to your arrangements today and came with embarrassing Edward and Jeanne in mind. I thought you were in the right and that I was risking my reputation to seek justice for you. However, I didn’t expect to be humiliated instead!”

Henry’s face was so ugly that he could not say a word. Was he not humiliated as well?

“I don’t blame you. You were probably stunned by Jasmine’s pure and adorable appearance. Who would have thought that Jasmine, who looks like a virtuous woman, would do such a disgusting thing? On the other hand, Jeanne looks like a prostitute, so who would have thought she was even purer than Jasmine? I never would have figured that Edward loved Jeanne so much and treated her so well because Jeanne gave her innocence to Edward. I really wouldn’t!” Elaine said sarcastically, and every word of hers was belittling Jasmine.
