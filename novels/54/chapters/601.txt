Chapter 602: Confronting the Lawrences, Imposing Presence!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Who knows? I miss him so much that I think I’m going crazy.” Monica could only be honest with Jeanne.

“You clearly love him so much. Why can’t you be a little more selfish?”

“I just can’t do it. Besides, I don’t regret it now. I just feel terrible whenever I think of Finn. You don’t know...” Monica swallowed the words that were on the tip of her tongue.

Forget it. She planned to endure the fact that Finn slept with another woman. It could be considered her making up to Finn for her choosing to help Michael.

She could just... forget it.

Jeanne waited a long time, but when Monica did not continue her sentence, she said, “About you and Dr. Jones, you have to be mentally prepared.”

Jeanne was reminding her that it was very likely that they would not be together again.

Nevertheless, Monica did not care, or perhaps she was in denial.

She believed that she and Finn had been together for so many years that Finn could let go of her so easily. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Jeannie, what time are you going to the Lawrences?” Monica changed the topic.

Every time she mentioned Finn, her heart and entire body would hurt.

“I’ll go after breakfast. Around 10:30 a.m. in the morning.”

“Okay, I’ll go over around that time too.”

Jeanne still wanted to persuade Monica about something, but the latter immediately hung up the phone.

Jeanne gave in. Anyway, no one could stop Monica from doing whatever she wanted to do. Take her wanting to help Michael, for example.

At that, Jeanne went downstairs.

Due to Jeanne’s approval, George had been going to school late for the past few days.

It was now 9:30 am, and he was sitting at the dining table, eating his breakfast slowly.

On the other hand, Teddy was so anxious. He wanted to rush George but had no choice but to hold it in

When he saw Jeanne show up, he quickly said respectfully, “Madam.”

“Is there any more breakfast?”

“Yes, I’ll bring it out for you right away.”

“Thank you.”

Jeanne and George sat together.

George ate very slowly, but he ate quite a lot.

In fact, George had been a picky eater since he was young. However, after coming here, his appetite had increased a lot.

Teddy placed an exquisite breakfast in front of Jeanne. “Madam, please enjoy your meal.”

“Teddy,” Jeanne spoke as she ate her breakfast.

“Yes?”

“You’ve studied the recipes you feed George with, right?” Jeanne said.

Actually, she wanted to thank him.

Although she had always kept George by her side, in reality, she did not care enough about him. At least, she had never been so attentive to him before. When he did not want to eat sometimes, she could really make him go hungry.

On second thought, it seemed George was shorter than his peers because of her.

“I’ve observed him, but it’s not difficult to know what the young master likes to eat,” Teddy explained. “He has the same taste buds as Fourth Master, so I just follow Fourth Master’s preferences.”

Jeanne wanted to express her gratitude, but she decided not to.

At that moment, George, who was relishing his food, put down his knife and fork angrily.

Teddy was a little dumbfounded.

George said, “I’m not eating anymore.”

“But you ate so little.” Teddy widened his eyes.

Jeanne took a look at George’s plate and thought he had eaten quite a lot.

“I don’t like it.”

“But you just said yesterday that you wanted a sandwich. You like it the way Fourth Master likes it.”

“I didn’t say that,” George retorted. “I don’t like blueberry jam in a sandwich. I like ketchup.”

“Fourth Master hates to eat tomatoes and ketchup the most–”

“But I do!” George enunciated each word.

“Alright. In that case, I’ll change it for you.” Teddy took George’s plate away, removed the blueberry jam from the sandwich, and spread a layer of ketchup on it before placing it in front of George.

George’s little eyebrows furrowed tightly.

Jeanne was watching the joke from the side.

“Young Master, eat it.”

George braced himself and took a bite. The taste was so sour that his little facial features twisted.

Jeanne looked at his appearance and... gloated over his misfortune.

It was over. She was no longer a good mother. To think she was so happy that her son was feeling miserable!

“Is it good?” Teddy asked.

“It’s good.” George braced himself and answered.

“I didn’t put much ketchup because I was afraid you wouldn’t be used to it. If you like it, I can add a little more.” As Teddy spoke, he picked up the ketchup and was about to spread it on the sandwich.
