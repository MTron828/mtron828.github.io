Chapter 1404: Are You Saying Zoe Is Lying To Me?

Looking at the scene of Finn and Monica pestering her, he was a little speechless. He even found it funny.

He figured that he should record it and show it to Finn when he sobered up. Perhaps he could even get some money from Finn to keep his mouth shut.

“Nox!” Monica called him urgently.

Nox returned to his senses and looked at Monica’s exasperated expression.

He said, “Why don’t you just go with Finn? It’s rare for him to take the initiative. Don’t dampen his enthusiasm!”

“Come over and push him away.” Monica was about to burst with anger, yet Nox was still making sarcastic remarks at the side.

It was indeed rare for Finn to be so proactive, but she no longer needed him to take the initiative. Hence, she writhed away from him and kept resisting.

Nox could see that Monica really did not want Finn to touch her, but then he remembered that he was the one who dragged Monica into the mess… Since he was the one who started it, he had to finish it. With that, Nox stepped forward to separate Finn and Monica.

Finn was really strong. After all, drunken people had no sense of awareness at all, and Monica’s face was red from being restrained by Finn.

It took Nox a lot of effort to separate Finn from Monica.

Monica heaved a sigh of relief. Then, without hesitation, she opened the door and left. The door was slammed shut with a loud bang.

Finn stared blankly at Monica’s departing figure.

He was clearly in a muddled state a second ago, but now, he suddenly seemed awake. At that moment, he looked lonely, as if he had been ruthlessly abandoned by someone.

Nox sighed. If he had known that would happen, he would not have brought Monica here in the first place.

Now, he was not in the mood to drink with Finn anymore. Moreover, Finn was already drunk, so what was the point of drinking?

He suddenly missed the days when he drank with Edward. With Edward’s status now, he would probably never dare to drink recklessly again.

He helped Finn out of the private room and left the restaurant.

Shelly saw them leave as she stood at the door of the private room next to theirs, waiting for orders from the person inside. Obviously, she had been kicked out.

Of course, she knew what the people inside were doing, but she did not tell Nox anything.

After Nox put Finn in the car at the entrance, he returned to get his phone that he had left in the private room. As soon as he returned, he noticed Shelly. He watched as she stood respectfully at the door, serving as a waitress. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He did not understand her. He had given her a lot of money back then. Could she not just focus on her studies? Why did she have to go for plastic surgery? Why did she have to make her life so miserable?

Shelly looked into Nox’s eyes and knew how much Nox hated her, but she pretended not to see it.

Nox could not help but ask, “Shelly, are you planning to live like this forever?!”

Shelly’s eyes flickered, but she kept her gaze on Nox because she did not quite understand what he meant.

“Are you planning to live such a lowly and degrading life?” Nox mocked.

“I don’t steal or rob. I earn my own money to support myself. How is my life lowly and degrading?” Shelly asked.

Nox was rendered speechless by Shelly’s words.

At that moment, he just wanted to express that if she could not go on living like that anymore, she could return to the Winters.

He may not like Shelly, but it did not mean that his family did not like her. The Winters could definitely support an idle person like Shelly.

“So you think it’s good being a waitress and being ordered around?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

“Every job deserves respect.” Shelly was very calm. “Of course, it’s fine if you look down on me. Anyway, you’ve never respected me.”

That last sentence made Nox choke. He found that he really was too kind to Shelly and that he was too nosy.

At that, Nox walked away with the thought that he would never care about that woman again. He felt that what he did was simply crazy.

Just as he was about to leave, Shelly called out to him, “Nox.”

Nox’s heart seemed to have been hit by something, but it also felt like an illusion.

Although he had never given a damn about her, he stopped in his tracks when she called out to him. However, he did not turn back, obviously waiting for Shelly to speak.

Shelly, on the other hand, regretted calling him..
