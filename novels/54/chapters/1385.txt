1386 Parent-Teacher Conference: You’re My Son!

“I do,” Paige replied quickly.

“Your brother needs a mother now, so aren’t you willing to share me with your brother?”

Feeling troubled, Paige did not answer.

“When your brother has something yummy or fun, does he share it with you?” Candice asked.

“Yes,” Paige answered honestly.

“So now, are you willing to share your mother with him?”

Paige thought for a moment before nodding obediently.

Candice smiled. “You’re such a good girl, Paige.”

Paige smiled again at the compliment, looking really obedient.

Then, Candice told Paige to play with the building blocks at the side while she finished her breakfast in a few bites.

After breakfast, she played with Paige for a while until Paige’s tutor arrived, and Paige went to class.

Candice watched the interaction between Paige and the tutor and suddenly had a bold idea. However, she did not think that she would be able to convince Edward.

She looked down at the time and left Paige’s room to return to the bedroom, where she got changed.

It was because of George’s parent-teacher conference that she spent a long time seriously picking out what to wear. To her, it was a very important occasion, and she did not want to disappoint George.

Once she got changed, she went downstairs from her room.

At that moment, Teddy seemed to have finished all the chores at home. When he was about to go upstairs to get changed, he was surprised to see Candice appear in a slightly formal outfit. “Are you going out, Madam?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’m going to George’s parent-teacher conference.”

Teddy was stunned.

“Can’t I?” Candice looked at his expression and felt a little awkward.

“No, no, I’m just a little surprised because, for so long, I’ve been attending them,” Teddy quickly explained.

Candice heaved a sigh of relief. She thought that George had specifically instructed that only Teddy was allowed to attend.

At that moment, Teddy was a little too excited.

He was probably touched by her wanting to go, so he said, “It would be better if you could attend the parent-teacher conference for George in person. George has actually been looking forward to Fourth Master attending for so many years, but he has been disappointed every time. Now that you can replace Fourth Master, I believe George will be very touched.”

She could not guarantee that George would be touched. All she knew was that she wanted to treat George better.

“I’ll prepare a car for you immediately.” Teddy was very enthusiastic.

He was afraid that she would suddenly go back on her word.

“Alright.” Candice nodded. “I’ll have to trouble you with Paige when I attend George’s parent-teacher conference. ”

“No problem, Madam.”

Teddy agreed.

He was in a pretty good mood as he went to sort out the car arrangements. Then, he personally sent Candice to the car and even waved at her enthusiastically.

Candice smiled faintly.

Teddy kept defending Edward, saying that he was too busy to take care of George. However, deep down, he also hoped someone would care more about George.

Her eyes flickered. The thought of attending the parent-teacher conference still made her inexplicably nervous.

It was not long before the car stopped at the Angeburg International Elementary School where George was studying.

Candice took a deep breath and walked into George’s classroom under the guidance of the school staff. Then, she sat in George’s seat.

At that moment, all the students in George’s class had gone to other classrooms to attend other classes, leaving only the parents and teachers in the classroom.

When Candice appeared, everyone was shocked.

The families that could attend Angeburg International Elementary School were either rich or noble, so naturally, they all knew Candice. However, no one took the initiative to go up and talk to her.

Due to Edward’s identity, there was still a sense of distance between them.

Of course, Candice had her own concerns. Having become the Leader’s wife, she had to pay more attention to her words and actions.

She sat quietly in George’s seat. Then, she listened to the teacher on the podium talking about the students’ learning that semester.

Still, Candice was proud, because every time the teacher read out the names of the outstanding students, the name Elias Swan would be mentioned.

Elias was George’s real name.

Even though many people still affectionately called him George, George had changed his name from George Lawrence to Elias Swan a long time ago.

Edward could not be blamed for changing George’s name. As the heir to the Leader, it would not be appropriate for George to go with his maternal name.

Sometimes, Candice wondered what kind of relationship George’s mother had with him.
