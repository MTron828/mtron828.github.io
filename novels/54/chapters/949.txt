950 Michael’s Revenge, Finn’s Warmth

She laughed sarcastically.

She laughed so hard that tears came out of her eyes.

Everyone could see that Michael was up to no good, but she could not tell.

Since she was stupid, it was only right for her to suffer retribution. She deserved all the suffering she was getting now.

She bit her lip and endured the pain.

The room was very quiet, and no one would be able to tell if something was happening in the room.

Should she be grateful that Michael was not making a sound?

Suddenly, the door of the ward was pushed open, and Monica’s eyes flickered.

Through her tears, she saw a familiar figure.

He walked straight to her father and did a standardized check. After the inspection, he turned around and left.

After all, it was normal for him to leave after a routine night patrol.

If... If only he still had feelings for her and had turned his head to look at her, perhaps he could have saved her.

At that moment, she was sure that Finn knew she was accompanying her father tonight, and the reason was simple.

Since she had come to the hospital, she definitely would not leave immediately. Moreover, Sarah would have informed Finn before she left.

There were many reasons, but he would not even look at her or know what she was going through now because he had no feelings for her anymore.

Besides, she did not ask for help.

So what if he asked for help? If Finn saw her having sex with Michael… Or perhaps, he did see them.

At the very least, she could lie to herself that Finn left because he did not know or care about her.

At the very least, she could still lie to herself that Finn did not know that she had slept with Michael.

Even if she could not be with Finn, she still cared about her reputation. She still hoped to leave a good impression in Finn’s heart!

Monica closed her eyes.

At that moment, someone said, “If you can’t resist, lie down and accept it.”

Therefore, she just had to accept it.

“Do you need me to call the police?” A deep voice suddenly sounded in the room.

It was Finn, whom Monica thought had left.

Suddenly, he was in front of their bed.

Michael, who was on top of Monica, finally let go of her and got up from the bed.

Monica’s gulped.

At that moment, she was really glad. Finn was actually not as indifferent as she thought. In fact, Finn was not as indifferent to her as she thought he was.

She really did not want… to be tainted by Michael, and actually, she was not that open-minded.

Michael got up from the bed and looked at Finn, who was also looking at him.

The two of them looked at each other.

Michael was first to leave the ward, and after that, Finn walked out of the ward without turning to look back at Monica.

Monica gritted her teeth and followed him out. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Outside the ward, in the quiet corridor, Michael looked at Finn and sneered, “What? You still can’t let go of Monica? You can’t let go of this woman who abandoned you without hesitation?”

Finn was cold.

In the face of Michael’s deliberate provocation, he said calmly, “Out of social morality and my own conscience, I’m just doing what a citizen should do.”

“Is that so?” Michael sneered, “Dr. Jones is really upright.”

“You’re too kind.”

“However, it’s true.” Michael’s eyes flickered as he looked at Monica, who was behind Finn.

Monica’s face turned pale.

“Should we call the police?” Michael asked Monica.

Monica looked back at Michael.

“Should we call the police?” Michael asked again.

He looked like he did not care at all.

“Just like at the press conference today, why don’t you let everyone know how sinister and cunning I am? Why don’t you let everyone know that I’m abusing my power to take revenge on you?” Michael asked her sarcastically.

That meant that Michael’s actions tonight were to take revenge on her for the accusation against him at the press conference.

“Monica, let me tell you, you can’t win against me!” Michael sneered arrogantly. “Do you think you can turn things around just because you forced the quality inspection department to produce a report? You’re too naive.”

“What do you mean by that?” Monica got a little agitated, even if she was trying her very hard to keep her emotions bottled in.

“You’ll eventually know what I mean by that.” Michael sneered, and his eyes narrowed. “I bet you will climb into my bed the next time.”

Monica’s face flushed red as she suppressed her anger.
