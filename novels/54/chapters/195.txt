Chapter 196: Kiss Me, but Not Like the Last Time

It was somehow quiet as if there was only the sound of Jeanne’s heart beating.

She closed her eyes tightly and took the initiative to deepen the kiss.

There was no harm anyway.

After a long time, Jeanne and Edward let go of each other.

The room was still very quiet. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Jeanne rested her hands on the headboard of the bed and maintained some distance from Fourth Master Swan even though they had stopped kissing.

She saw that Fourth Master Swan’s lips were stained with a sparkling luster.

Jeanne asked, “Fourth Master, can you return the phone to me now?”

“Yes,” Fourth Master Swan replied.

It was just a simple word, but Jeanne picked up a hint of hoarseness in his voice.

It was as if he was enduring something.

Jeanne stretched out her hand again and grabbed Fourth Master Swan’s hand. Then, she gently opened his slender fingers and took her phone back.

At that moment, she felt as if she had accomplished a great thing in her life and heaved a huge sigh of relief.

She left from the bedside.

Fourth Master Swan looked at her.

“Fourth Master, I’m leaving.” It was as if Jeanne had no lingering feelings after achieving her wish.

Fourth Master Swan did not answer her.

Jeanne left directly.

When she left, she suddenly saw Nox and Teddy standing at the door.

She instantly looked a little irritated.

“I didn’t see anything,” Nox hurriedly said.

Teddy also hurriedly said, “Me neither.”

They gave themselves away by concealing the truth.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and left immediately.

Nox and Teddy watched Jeanne leave before they walked into Edward’s room.

Edward was lying on the bed emotionlessly.

At least, Teddy could not see through him.

Of course, Nox could tell at a glance, but he did not expose Edward. He said with a serious expression, “We have news about Kingsley.”

Edward’s expression obviously changed slightly.

Nox continued, “Kingsley’s background is very powerful, but we don’t know what exactly his background is. We only know that he’s very famous in the high-class socialite circles abroad. Many people know Kingsley, but no one can tell what he does. They only know that he’s very rich, and whenever he appears, he’s very generous. The most famous thing was that at an auction, he spent a billion dollars to buy a long-lost royal painting of Harken. The most important thing was that he paid in cash!”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

At this moment, Nox could not help but exclaim, “F*ck, a billion dollars in cash. Was there a truckload of notes? It sounds so f*cking pretentious!”

“Is there anything else?” Edward did not seem to be very interested in that.

“There’s nothing else.” Nox was straightforward. “So far, that’s all I can find out. As for the relationship between Kingsley and Jeanne... I can’t find any relationship at all. Among international celebrities, many people know Kingsley, but nobody knows Jeanne. Jeanne had never been seen together with Kingsley. Didn’t she use to be the marketing director of MUK? In fact, she rarely appeared in public abroad. It’s unknown whether it was because she deliberately didn’t want to be exposed. In any case, other than the people from MUK, no one from the business world or even international celebrities know about Jeanne. This was also why no one in Harken knew that she was the marketing director of MUK.”

“Mm,” Edward replied.

“Oh right, there’s another discovery.” Nox suddenly thought of something. “Kingsley has a fixed female companion by his side. I heard that he has many women. Every time he attends a celebrity banquet, he would bring a different female companion. All of them are beautiful and are top-notch—”

Nox was a little excited.

He had never lost in picking up girls before. Now, he suddenly felt that he was inferior to Kingsley.

“Get to the point.” Edward’s face darkened.

“The point is, no matter who Kingsley brings, there’ll always be another woman by his side.”

“Who?” Edward asked.

“Lucy Harmon,” Nox answered.

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“Yes, it’s Lucy Harmon, the professional female assassin who used to be very famous internationally,” Nox said straightforwardly, “I’ve looked in her thoroughly. She was born in Harken. At the age of 20, she became a professional assassin and enjoyed an international reputation. She had carried out many missions and never failed. She suddenly disappeared when she was 28 years old. Many people in the assassin circle said that something happened to her, where she failed a mission and died. If I didn’t investigate Kingsley this time, I wouldn’t know that she’s still alive and is now 35 years old.”

“Continue to investigate,” Edward instructed.

“Okay.” Nox nodded. At this moment, he could not help but say, “Kingsley might really have a strong background. You should be mentally prepared.”

Edward raised his eyebrow.

“What I mean is that Kingsley and Jeanne are obviously very close. I even feel that he has protected her very well. I thought that it’d be very difficult for you to successfully snatch Jeanne away from Kingsley...” Nox felt Edward’s gaze and shrugged. “Forget I said anything. You should rest well. Please take care of your body. Something bad can easily happen to a man who holds it in for too long!”

Edward had closed his eyes. It was as if he did not want to be disturbed anymore.

Nox was speechless. He left after that.

‘Well, who exactly is Kingsley!

‘He can’t be someone from that side, can he?!

‘If he is…’

Nox’s heart trembled.

‘Wouldn’t Fourth Master Swan’s relationship be ruined halfway?!’

...

Jeanne returned to the Lawrences’ manor.

George was seriously helping her hack the internal networks of the two companies.

At this moment, he had successfully hacked into one of them and was looking for their accounting data.

Jeanne did not disturb George. She sat on the chair at the side and called Kingsley. “I’ve found the key person in my case.”

“Who?”

“Luna Walker, also known as Lunetta Walker. She’s the secretary-general of the Lawrence Enterprise’s secretarial office and has an affair with Adrian Zimmer, the chief engineer of the construction department. She was the one who drew up the contract for the tender of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse. From what I saw, it was almost the same style as that of the dual contract. In other words, that dual contract was drawn up by Luna. Therefore, we can now confirm that Luna is one of the participants in this case.”

“Mm,” Kingsley responded. He was more or less satisfied with Jeanne’s result today.

“Now that we’ve confirmed that Luna is involved, it’ll be easy to investigate further. First, since she was the one who made the contract, she must have a draft of the contract. Of course, from my contact with Luna, I can tell that she’s quite experienced, so it’s unlikely that she left any evidence behind. However, Luna is only a secretary, after all, so she can’t evaluate the legal effect of the contract. Logically speaking, Luna would definitely find a lawyer to help her check if there’s a problem with this kind of contract, which would obviously be used as evidence in court. Hence, I feel that the lawyer that Luna found is a valid witness that can prove that she was the one who drew up the contract! I feel that she won’t specifically ask the other party to delete anything from the draft of the contract. This will cause other people to overthink, which will only bring trouble instead.”

“I’ll arrange for people to investigate,” Kingsley said.

“Secondly, Adrian reported me while Luna drafted the contract. If it can be proven that the two of them have been secretly colluding, it’ll show that they’re the ones behind this. In other words, Adrian is the one who’s involved, while I may be the victim or the collaborator. Harken’s law is reverse authentication. In other words, if something isn’t established, one can’t be sentenced. In this way, at least in four days, I won’t be sentenced immediately. In other words, I can buy myself more time to investigate this case in depth.”

At the end of the day, nothing was flawless. Justice would ultimately prevail.

Jeanne sneered.

This time, she wanted to catch the culprit behind the scenes!
