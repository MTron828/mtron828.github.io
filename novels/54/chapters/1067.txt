1068 Do You Want To Reconcile With Finn?

Monica hugged Nox, and her body began to tremble.

Finally, he could feel her emotions. Bit by bit, she seemed to be breaking down but also seemed to be holding back.

She grabbed Nox’s clothes, and her tears fell on Nox.

It was her first time killing someone.

It was the first time she picked up a knife and went to kill someone.

When she finally came to her senses, she still trembled. Or was it because she was so terrified that she wanted to find someone to lean on?

Nox’s throat moved slightly.

He did not know what he was feeling at that moment. He just stood there in a daze. Then, he felt Monica’s tears on his chest, and even his clothes were soaked. Her hands were full of blood as she clutched his clothes. She was trying very hard to control herself and completely lose control.

Seeing Monica, who was in such great pain yet could still bear it, Nox had to admit that his heart ached a little.

He had known Monica for a long time, so he knew her personality very well.

When she encountered something, she would only shout and instinctively hide behind others. Yet now, she had suddenly become someone who could bear everything herself and carry that burden on her petite body.

His eyes flickered.

Finn had also stood up from the ground after having done the emergency rescue. Then, he looked at Monica, crying in Nox’s arms.

He had arrived earlier than Nox and was closer to her than Nox. However, she did not look to him for support.

Even the moment he arrived, she had used her calmest expression to tell him that she had killed someone and told him to call the police.

She did not look like she needed someone for support, and there was no trace of fear on her face.

At that moment, he thought that Monica had been trained to be indestructible and mature enough to face everything herself.

However, it turned out that she just did not show it in front of him. She just did not want him to see her cowardice. She would rather find comfort in Nox’s arms than take a step closer to him.

In fact, that was a good thing too.

Finn looked on indifferently.

Back when Monica chose to leave, he had already left the relationship. He never thought that there would be any possibility between him and Monica again.

It was probably because of his sympathy for Monica that he had been so affectionate to her for the past two days.

He was indebted to Gary, and the failure of the surgery was also related to him. Hence, it was reasonable for him to help Monica.

He said calmly, “Let’s go. It’ll be difficult to get away when the ambulance arrives.”

Nox stared at Finn and saw how indifferent the latter was.

He used to think that Monica and Finn should never be together again and that Monica was so stupid that he looked down on her.

Even now, his thoughts were the same.

After all, the two of them were clearly growing further and further apart, so there was no need to be together again. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Nox nodded and left the warehouse with Monica in his arms.

Monica followed behind him as Nox brought her to his car.

Meanwhile, Finn went to the other side and left in his car.

In the car, Monica had already left Nox’s embrace. In fact, she did not dare to be greedy and rely on anyone.

“Are you alright?” Nox looked at the distance that Monica maintained and saw that she seemed to have regained her composure.

However, he still found it surprising that Monica could calm herself down so quickly.

“Yeah.” Monica nodded her head.

“Are you injured?”

“No,” Monica said.

She was only slapped a few times. Although her face was swollen, it was not serious.

To her, nothing was too serious.

“Finn said that the man can still be saved, so don’t be afraid,” Nox consoled her.

That was the first time Monica felt Nox’s warmth.

She had always thought that the man was as heartless as she was. Hence, considering how headstrong and annoying she was before, Nox should be very annoyed with her.

“Even if the man dies, it’s self-defense. Don’t feel burdened. Besides, I’m sure Michael won’t dare to make a big deal out of this. If he does, he won’t be able to get away with it, so no one will accuse you. Don’t worry about the police suspecting you.” Nox continued.

Monica nodded silently.

“Where are we going now?” Nox asked her after explaining the matter.

“Back to my home.” If she went to the hospital in that state, her mother would be scared to death.

“Okay.”

With that, Nox told the driver to send Monica back to her villa.
