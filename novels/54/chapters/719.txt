He got into the car and drove like a mad person to vent his anger.

He wanted to kill his Fourth Uncle and Jeanne. He wanted to step over their heads and take everything the Swans had for himself. His desire grew so intense that at that moment, he had reached the point of madness.

If it were not for his phone ringing, he might not have realized that he was driving at 200 kilometers per hour, causing complete chaos in the city.

With that, he stepped on the break and fiercely parked his car by the roadside.

He looked at the incoming call, which was the only call he wanted to pick up.

He suppressed his emotions and said, “Michael.”

“You don’t seem to be doing well at Lawrence Enterprise.” Michael went straight to the point.

Eden’s expression was ugly, and he held the phone without speaking.

“Did you take to heart what I told you earlier?” Michael asked.

“Which one?”

“About using Quinn.”

“I’ve tried. This woman dislikes me,” Eden sneered.

When he calmed down, he had to admit that he was not as capable or outstanding as he thought.

He had even suffered a lot of blows in his life recently, and the sense of superiority he once had once gone.

“As I’ve said, conventional methods definitely won’t work, but we can play dirty,” Michael suggested.

“I think I might not be as useful as you think.” In front of Michael, Eden admitted that he was a mess.

He had to admit that compared to many people, he was useless.

“Are you in a bad mood?” Michael instantly noticed.

“I used to be proud and thought that no one was better than me. I even thought if my grandfather valued me as much as my Fourth Uncle, I would have been as good as my Fourth Uncle. But now I know that I was just overestimating and making a fool of myself.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“What happened for you to doubt yourself like this?”

“My failure recently has forced me to doubt myself.”

“The trouble caused by the Lawrence Enterprise’s retail agents, was it you who did it?” Michael no longer asked any more questions and speculate directly.

Eden did not answer, but the silence was tacit agreement.

Michael said, “Not only did it not bring any danger to the Lawrence Enterprise, but it also allowed Lawrence Enterprise to obtain get the public’s praise, further improving Jeanne’s image.”

When Eden heard Michael’s words, he subconsciously tightened his grip on his phone.

“Actually, it’s not necessarily a bad thing,” Michael said bluntly.

“It’s not necessarily a bad thing?” Eden sneered, “Do you know how embarrassed I was today? Do you know that my Fourth Uncle–”

Michael frowned.

Eden paused for a moment before saying, “My Fourth Uncle almost threw me off Lawrence Enterprise’s roof. Do you know that whenever I think about it now, I still feel a lingering fear and my whole body will tremble? This is the first time I’ve come so close to death, and I realized that I’m very afraid of dying, so much so that I want to give up. I want to give up fighting with Jeanne. If not for my reluctance to submit and the little bit of self-respect I have for myself, my Fourth Uncle would’ve successfully threatened me. I really am what Joshua says I am. I’m a f*cking dog!”

“Eden, calm down.” Michael tried to persuade him, “I really don’t think this is a bad thing for you. You used to think you were invincible, so you always took risks to do many things and failed. But now, after this blow, you know the gap between you and others. Once you know that, you won’t do things that you’re not sure of.”

Eden sneered. “Michael, you have never failed before. You don’t know what it feels like to fail.”

“Yes, I have never failed before, and that is why when it comes to working with you, I have never thought of failing.” Michael enunciated every word.

Eden said self-deprecatingly, “Even now, you still want to work with me?”

“Although you doubt yourself, I don’t think you’re as incompetent as you say. In fact, I have always thought highly of you, and your failure is only because of your eagerness for quick success and instant benefits. If you could calm down, many things would not have gone that way!”

Eden gritted his teeth.

He just could not stand Jeanne flaunting her power in front of him.

He just could not accept that he was below someone else.

“Eden, as I’ve been saying, this matter isn’t a bad thing for you. Not only will it allow you to recognize yourself and not be impulsive, but more importantly, you can use this opportunity to gain trust.” Michael changed the topic, saying, “When we know that we can’t win head-on, we have to think about whether the method we’re using is right. If it isn’t, we have to find another way out.”
