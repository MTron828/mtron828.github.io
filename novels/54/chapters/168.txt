Chapter 169: Failed Confession, but There’s Still Time

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, an accident happened and changed Jeanne’s whole life.

She had difficulty giving birth.

At 10 months pregnant, she was ready to give birth.

After she was sure that she would give birth to George, she began to improve her childbirth skills because she knew she would only give birth to the child at home.

What she did not expect was that George was a breech baby.

That meant that he was not born head first.

As such, no matter how much Jeanne relied on herself, she could not give birth on her own.

That was the first time in her life that she was truly in despair.

Back when she was beaten half to death by Alexander, no matter how serious her injuries were, she knew very well that even if Monica had not come to the villa to look for her, Alexander would not have killed her. It was just to teach her a lesson.

On the other hand, when she gave birth to George, she deeply felt death.

Jeanne could not even resist.

She silently felt the blood flowing between her legs.

She silently felt the intense pain in her stomach.

She lost all the strength to struggle.

She blankly looked at the broken ceiling above her head.

At that moment, her mind was in a trance, and her whole life flashed in front of her.

Did she regret it?!

Maybe she did.

She regretted putting herself in such a sorry state for a man.

The moment she thought she was going to die, a man appeared in her rental house.

He bent down and picked her up from the ground.

According to Kingsley, Jeanne was frighteningly light at that time.

Not to mention she was pregnant, she did not even reach the average girl’s weight.

Kingsley also said that when he found Jeanne, he thought she could not be saved.

Fortunately, the heavens were kind.

Jeanne was rescued in the hospital.

George was also born.

Afterward, Jeanne was taken away by Kingsley.

It was until now when she returned.

Jeanne came back and faced everything that she had experienced.

Now that she thought about it, if only she had been able to call Alexander back then to ask for help…

Even if it was not Alexander, she would not have been so miserable if she had just called Monica.

Instead, she bore everything by herself back then.

Perhaps it was because when Jeanne had gone abroad back then she was at her most difficult time when her phone could not be used. She did not have data roaming nor could she afford to buy a local international card. After all, seven years ago, communication had not developed to the point where it was as convenient as it was at the moment. Back then, international roaming was so expensive that she could not afford it at all.

When Jeanne could barely use international roaming, she no longer wanted to ask for help from home.

Kingsley said that her personality was very similar to her mother’s.

They abhorred evil and would never yield.

“Ms. Lawrence, have you forgotten?” Fourth Master Swan’s voice pulled Jeanne back from her distracted thoughts.

Jeanne looked at the man in front of her indifferently.

She really wanted to forget.

She said, “It’s not important, so I don’t care.”

What she said was the truth.

After experiencing so much, some things became meaningless.

Edward’s expression was cold.

“Fourth Master,” Jeanne said coldly, “Please don’t take the past to heart, and please be magnanimous in the future.”

After saying that, Jeanne turned around and left.

She did not feel like she could say anything else. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Toward Fourth Master Swan…

To be honest, Jeanne did not know what to say.

Perhaps actions were the most direct and effective.

Who knew, she had just taken two steps when her arm was suddenly pulled by someone.

At the next second, with a strong force, she was tightly bound to Fourth Master Swan’s embrace.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

The emotions in her heart were surging.

Under Kingsley’s training, she had not revealed her emotions for a long time. That said, at this moment, she admitted that she had lost control.

In less than a second in Fourth Master Swan’s embrace, Jeanne pushed him away hard.

Her strength was very shocking.

Fourth Master Swan might not have expected it and was pushed a few steps back.

Teddy saw it from the side and was stunned.

He could not believe that his master was pushed by the seemingly weak Ms. Lawrence.

Edward looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne said, “Fourth Master, I’m no longer the Jeanne I used to be. I don’t need your protection to be able to take care of things on my own.”

“So you looked for me back then just so I could help you.”

“I only wanted you to help me suppress Eden’s arrogance.” Jeanne affirmed and added, “There were no feelings involved at all.”

Edward’s face darkened slightly.

Jeanne continued, “Not just seven years ago, but also now. The reason I agreed to your agreement was so that I could maintain a distance from you. I have no feelings for you at all.”
