Chapter 1578: Complaining About Finn, Nox Meets Shelly Again

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Alright,” Nox replied.

Zoe said a few more words before hanging up.

At that moment, Nox had calmed down a little. He suddenly realized that his future wife treated him the best. Edward, Finn, and so on prioritized their relationships over friends. Ever since they had girlfriends or wives, they treated him differently!

‘F*ck.’ Nox cursed.

The thought of both of them being in relationships made him inexplicably angry. He, too, had a wife who loved him to the core. What was there for Finn and Edward to be so smug about?

Nox cursed as he drove to River Restaurant. Zoe’s parents loved the dishes in that restaurant, and that was why they decided on the place.

He parked the car in the parking lot and walked into the restaurant, where the waiter respectfully brought Nox to the most luxurious private room. After waiting for about five minutes, his parents arrived.

Then, he waited ten minutes before Zoe arrived with her parents. The two families sat at the same dining table, looking happy and harmonious.

Mr. Winter said, “They were the ones who said they were unsure about getting married, but look at them now, saying that they want to get married. I’ve been waiting for this day to come.”

Mr. Sullivan quickly chimed in. “When I heard that they were getting married, I couldn’t hold back either. I really can’t wait to have grandchildren.” “Me, too. I just hope that they can have children soon after they get married.” “Preferably two.”

“Dad.” Zoe was a little shy. In fact, she had never thought about having a child.

She had never thought of having a child so early in her marriage with Nox. She always felt that giving birth to a child was like giving birth to a burden.

“Look at how shy you are. Being married means having children. What’s there to be shy about?” Mr. Sullivan reprimanded her dotingly.

“Maybe we’re a little anxious about it as well” Mr. Winter tried to smooth things over.

It was clear that both parents were satisfied with the marriage.

At that moment, the waitresses began to serve the dishes one after another. However, Shelly did not expect to see Nox again on such an occasion. She had changed jobs, yet here was Nox again.

She was carrying a tray full of bowls of wild mushroom soup in her hand. There were two other waitresses serving the dishes behind her, so she could not turn around and leave. Instead, the two waitresses behind her gently pushed her long, as if they were telling her to hurry up.

Shelly bit the bullet and placed the bowls of wild mushroom soup on the dining table.

The moment she put it down, Mrs. Winter recognized Shelly at a glance. “Shellv?”

Shelly knew she would be discovered, and Mrs. Winter calling her name made everyone look at her.

Nox and Zoe had been sitting together and whispering to each other, but when he heard his mother’s voice, he quickly looked up. As soon as he saw Shelly serving the dishes in the waitress’ uniform, his expression changed dramatically.

Only Mrs. Winter was a little excited. “Shelly, what are you doing here? Have you always been in South Hampton City?”

Shelly put down the bowls of soup and said, “Yes, I’ve always been here.”

“Why didn’t you come back to the Winters? Isn’t it hard… surviving on your own out there?” Mrs. Winter asked.

She still cared about Shelly. After all, Shelly had been living with them for so many years. Although she was still biased toward her son, she still felt a little guilty.

“It’s alright. I’m used to it, so it’s not that hard anymore.” Shelly quickly replied, “I’m working now, so I can’t chat with the guests. I’ll be outside.” Then, she left, with Mrs. Winter watching her.

On the other hand, Mrs. Sullivan was surprised. “Is she your relative?”

“She’s…” Mrs. Winter hesitated for a moment, not knowing how to explain the situation.

In the end, she said slowly, “Wasn’t Nox in poor health back then? We did a tarot card reading for Nox, and it said he would be in danger unless he has a younger companion. We found Nox one according to his horoscope.” “Oh, I’ve heard of her.” Mrs. Sullivan was enlightened. “She’s Shelly, right?”

“Yes, but between Nox and Shelly… Zoe, since you’re here, let me clarify that Nox and Shelly have no feelings for each other. Don’t take it to heart. We were superstitious back then, but it’s all in the past now.”

Zoe did not respond to Mrs. Winter’s words. Her entire body was frozen, and she was seemingly lost in thought..RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
