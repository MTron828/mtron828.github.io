Chapter 503: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction

In the VIP ward of the trauma and emergency department in South Hampton City Central Hospital, Monica was sleeping soundly, dreaming.

In her dream, Finn was taking the initiative and kissing her gently.

After all, ever since they started dating and got married, the only time Finn took the initiative to kiss her was on the night of his 30th birthday. The kiss even felt a little vindictive as it was not gentle. Yet now.. she felt like her entire body was about to melt into a puddle of water.

She could feel Finn’s lips on her forehead, face, and body… It turned out Finn was also so unreserved!

“Hahahaha...” Monica suddenly laughed.

In her sleep, she laughed like a goose.

Finn stared at her laughing so ridiculously even when she was asleep.

The next moment, Monica opened her eyes, awoken by her own laughter.

However, she was still smiling when she woke up and felt very happy.

For a long time, she did not seem to know if this was a dream or reality.

“What are you laughing at?” She suddenly heard a familiar male voice beside her ear.

Monica was stunned.

It took her a long time to come to her senses. Then, she looked at the man beside her and said, “I just had a dream.”

......

“What did you dream about?” Finn asked.

What did she dream about? Why did she laugh like that?

“I dreamed you kissed me,” Monica said.

As soon as she said that, Finn seemed stunned for a second before he became indifferent.

“I dreamed that you took the initiative to...” Monica looked at Finn and looked at his naturally cold aura. She muttered, “It really was a dream.”

As expected, Finn would never be as impatient as he was in her dream.

Finn, on the other hand, smiled as he thought she was joking.

A little unhappy, Monica moved her body.

She had slept way too much in one day. How could she sleep all day? That showed how depressed she was.

As such, she got up, only to realize that one of her hands had reached into Finn’s clothes and was touching his chest.

Suddenly, she felt a little sad.

Finn looked at her expression and frowned. “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing.” Monica shook her head.

Finn’s eyes turned cold.

“I’m a little thirsty for you,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn was rendered speechless by Monica’s words again.

Then, Monica pulled her hand out from Finn’s clothes.

She did not know when she could have s*x with Finn. The doctor said they would not be able to sleep together for at least three months, which felt like a long time.

She could not help but ask Finn, “Do you want it?”

Finn immediately averted her gaze as if he was not interested to answer such a meaningless question.

Monica pursed her lips. She knew that the guy would not even think about it.

With that, she got up from the hospital bed.

Her ankle was much better and did not hurt anymore, but she still needed a crutch. Hence, she limped into the bathroom to use the toilet and wash up.

Finn felt Monica get off the bed and watched her walk into the bathroom before he quietly adjusted his breathing. After that, he tried to relax his body quietly.

As he was relaxing, he suddenly heard screams coming from the bathroom. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn’s body suddenly tensed.

Just when he thought something big had happened to Monica, he saw Monica rushing out with her walking stick.

“What’s wrong?”

“Finn, did you molest me?”

“...”

“Look!” Monica shamelessly pulled down her hospital gown a little.

She only had one of the buttons on her hospital gown unbuttoned, but now that she had unbuttoned three of them, she pulled the loose gown down to her shoulders, revealing her fair and smooth shoulders. On her collarbone was a red hickey, which looked very obvious.

Finn blushed.

At first, he just wanted to kiss her forehead, but then…

He averted his gaze and asked, “Are you allergic to anything?”

“Huh?” Monica was startled.

She touched the position of her collarbone.

Was it an allergy?

Finn said, “If you’re allergic, I can get the doctor to give you an allergy medicine.”

Was it really an allergy?

Monica saw how serious Finn was and believed him.

Finn would never kiss her behind her back, and it seemed like the man did not have desire in that certain aspect.

She replied, “Oh, so it’s an allergy.”

She mumbled and went into the bathroom again.
