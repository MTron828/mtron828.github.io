Chapter 675: Conspiracy Theory: She Can Only Belong To Him!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, she answered reluctantly, “That’s why I admire President Lawrence’s boldness.”

“I agree with that point.” Eden nodded.

After entering the Lawrence Enterprise, Eden had shown his admiration for Jeanne, and it made people think that he had forgotten about the past.

To them, he was a very good person.

“It’s getting late, so I’ll get off work too.” Quinn did not seem to be interested in talking to Eden.

Other than Jeanne, she did not care about anyone in Lawrence Enterprise.

As for Jeanne, Quinn just wanted to verify the extent of Jeanne’s ability. It was not to the extent that she thought Jeanne was amazing.

“Wait,” Eden called out to her.

Quinn frowned.

She was visibly getting a little impatient.

“Have you tried porcini risotto in Harken before?”

“Huh?” Quinn looked like she did not know about it.

“It’s a local delicacy. You deserve it.” Eden handed the exquisitely packed box in his hand to Quinn.

Quinn politely accepted it. “Thank you.”

Eden nodded with a smile before turning around and leaving.

Michael said that taking the initiative to express goodwill required a method.

Since she was young, Quinn had been courted by many people. Hence, if he made it too over the top, he might disgust her.

It would be fine as long as it was done just enough.

Quinn should be able to guess that the risotto was supposed to be for Jeanne and not her, so she would not think he was trying to please her on purpose.

It would even make her wonder if he still had... feelings for Jeanne.

That was also why Eden was deliberately trying to show how good he was to Jeanne. The goal was to let Quinn let down her guard.

However, Quinn also had her pride. If it was not meant for her, she naturally would not want it. Hence, she turned around and threw the porcini risotto into the trash can.

Eden also saw all of it.

He thought if that woman could lie under him one day, would her pride still be there?

Suddenly, what had never thought crossed his mind made him extremely excited!

…

It was an unusually quiet night, and Monica had insomnia again.

In fact, she had insomnia every night.

Her mind was filled with the image of Finn treating her indifferently, and she felt that Finn had already let her go.

She could not let things go on like that.

She had to test Michael and make Jeanne truly trust Michael. Then, she would let Jeanne persuade or use Fourth Master Swan to persuade Finn to wait for her to return to him after she helped Michael.

In any case, she had to resort to desperate measures in desperate times.

She thought for a moment, gritted her teeth, and made a call.

The call connected quickly.

It was midnight, but when Michael heard her call, he picked it up immediately.

“Are you still awake?” Monica was a little surprised.

“I was just lying in bed.”

“Were you on your phone?”

“No.”

“In that case, why did you pick up the call so quickly?”

“Because your ringtone is different from other people’s. The moment I heard your ringtone, I instinctively picked it up immediately.”

Monica was a little speechless.

Sometimes, Michael treated her so well that she could not take it.

“Why are you looking for me so late at night?” Michael changed the topic to avoid awkwardness.

“Oh.” Monica came back to her senses. “I have insomnia, so I wanted to talk to you.”

“Go on. I’m listening.”

“I’m wondering... whether Finn has completely given up on me,” Monica said on purpose.

Michael made himself seem guilty. “I’m sorry. It’s all because of me–”

“What I mean is, should I do something to save Finn now?”

“Do you need my help?” Michael asked calmly.

“Not really. I just want to talk to you about what I think.”

“Okay.”

“Finn has never trusted me — that I’m just helping you. He thinks I divorced him because I want to be with you. I want him to know that I’m not.”

“What do you plan to do?” Michael asked.

“I want to sleep with Finn,” she said.

Monica was nervous. She knew she was lying to Michael, but somehow, her heart started beating faster as soon as she said it.

If it were not for Michael’s accident, she might be having Finn’s son in her belly right now. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Michael was stunned for two seconds.

“Michael?” Monica called out to him.

Michael replied, “Yes, I’m here.”

“Do you think it’s okay?”

“I… don’t know what advice to give you.”

“If Finn knows I’m still a virgin, he’ll believe there’s nothing between us. This is the only way I can think of.”

Michael still stayed silent.

“Michael, do you think this is a bad idea?” Monica did not get a response from Michael, so she asked.

“No. Undoubtedly, that’s a good way to convince Finn. I was just worried Finn wouldn’t be willing to sleep with you. He seems to really dislike you. I’m afraid that not only will he not sleep with you, but he’ll hurt you physically–”

“It doesn’t matter. Even so, I want to try.” Monica said with certainty, “I plan to look for him tomorrow. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll drug him and make him sleep with me.”

“Since you’ve decided, do it.” There was no emotion in Michael’s tone.

“Okay. “Monica nodded. “I was hesitating about whether to do it or not, but with your support, I feel much more at ease. It’s getting late, so I won’t keep you up any longer. I’m hanging up now.”

“I wish you good luck tomorrow.” Michael smiled.

“Okay. Good night.”

“Good night.”

After hanging up, Michael’s expression sank.

She wanted to use her body to prove to Finn that she was still a virgin? Monica’s first time could only belong to him!
