Chapter 1682: The Breakup

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Shelly…”

“I mean what I say.” Shelly was determined.

At that moment, she even hugged Benjamin’s neck. Without a second thought, she kissed him.

In any case, Nox could not change anything in her life, and she would not be threatened by him. She did not even need to confirm that Benjamin changing his mind was Nox’s doing.

The more Nox wanted to stop her, the more she had to resist. She was going to have sex with Benjamin tonight. If possible, she could even give birth to

Benjamin’s child. Having made up her mind, Shelly pulled Benjamin’s clothes.

Shocked by Shelly’s sudden proactiveness, Benjamin quickly pushed Shelly away. “Don’t do this.”

“We have to do this. It’s to tell Nox that it’s useless no matter how he breaks us up!” Shelly said agitatedly.

Then, she forced herself on Benjamin again, but Benjamin gritted his teeth and pushed Shelly away.

He said, “It’s not you. It’s me. My family can’t accept you! They can’t accept that you have a child, and I can’t cut ties with them! Instead of making us both suffer, it’s better to end it now before it starts and minimize the pain!”

Shelly suddenly froze, confused about what he meant by ending before it even started. In Benjamin’s mind, they were not yet in a relationship, whereas she thought they were already very much in love.

“I’m going overseas, so don’t contact me ever again in the future.” Benjamin said coldly, “I’m sorry, Shelly. I’m not as brave as you think.”

Shelly was silent for a long time. She figured it was not because he was not brave, but because he did not love her that much.

Her lips curled into a faint smile. It was true that no family could accept her current situation, and the reason why Benjamin’s parents did not stop them was that they wanted to send Benjamin overseas first.

The better Benjamin’s career was in the future, the further the distance between them would be. Hence, the sooner they ended it, the better.

Shelly smiled gently and calmly accepted everything. In fact, for a long time, she did not think that she would meet her true love. She did have some suitors when she was raising Bella, but once they heard that she was taking care of a child, they all left it at that. It was Benjamin who gave her wild hopes for the future.

“Shelly. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry…” Benjamin felt even worse when he saw how calm she was.

He would rather she vent it all out because it pained him to see her like that.

“It’s fine.” Shelly accepted it and said, “You’re right to consider that. When two people are together, it involves more than just the two people; it’s a matter between two families. If your parents don’t accept me, we won’t be happy together. I didn’t think it through.”

“Shelly…”

“Don’t take what I said just now to heart.”

What she meant was that he should not take to heart what she said about never breaking up.

“I’ve been living quite well all these years, and I can continue to do so without you. Moreover, I forget relationships very quickly, like how I did with Nox back then.” Shelly said, making herself seem indifferent. “You, too. Don’t think about me after you leave.”

Tears streamed down Benjamin’s face. He really did not want to hurt Shelly, but he had to accept the reality. He did not want Shelly to regret it in the end.

“Don’t cry. I’m not as weak as you think.” Shelly reached out to wipe Benjamin’s tears.

However, the moment she reached out, she held herself back and retracted her hand. From now on, she would keep her distance.

She said, “Take good care of yourself when you’re overseas.”

Benjamin nodded.

“You should go back soon. You’re going overseas the day after tomorrow. There should be a lot of things you need to pack,” Shelly urged.

Since they had broken up, there was no reason for him to stay the night.

Benjamin clenched his teeth as he kept his emotions in check. In the end, he got up and walked to the door.

When Shelly sent him out, her eyes were red, but she did not cry. The moment Benjamin walked out with heavy footsteps…

“Shelly.”

Shelly looked at him.

“Nox is actually alright. He might not be as bad as you think,” Benjamin said.

Even though he tore Nox’s love letter into pieces, seeing how strong Shelly was at that moment, he could not help but want her to live a better life.

“Alright.” Shelly nodded, hiding the disappointment in her eyes.

She thought Benjamin might go back on his word about breaking up with her.

However, he did not, and she would not make things difficult for him either. She had never thought of taking or destroying anything from anybody.

Thanks to Nox, she truly understood that happiness could not be forced. That was why she was so unaffected by that breakup.

“Goodbye,” Benjamin said heavily.

“Goodbye,” Shelly said.

As soon as Benjamin left, Shelly closed the door, and the tears that she had been holding back streamed down her face.

When she broke all relations with Nox, she just felt a little sad that all her eyes of hard work had gone down the drain. However, because she did not love him, she was not heartbroken. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This time, she finally realized how painful it was to break up with someone she loved.

After Benjamin left South Hampton City, Shelly deleted Benjamin’s number. After all, they would probably never see each other again.

Benjamin would become a memory that she would look back on many years later, and at least, she could be grateful that she had been in love with a man, who truly loved her with all his heart. To her, that was enough. After all, she still had to live her life and raise Bella.

A month later, Bella could almost hear without a hearing aid, which was probably the happiest thing that had happened to Shelly in the past month.

Hence, one day, she brought Bella to eat Bella’s favorite fried chicken burger.

The two of them ate happily, and when they returned, it was already 8 p.m. in the evening. Just as they arrived at the entrance of the neighborhood, Shelly suddenly stopped in her tracks because she saw Bella’s biological mother, her second sister, Katie.

Ever since she abandoned Bella, she had never appeared again. She had not even called Shelly once. Now that she had suddenly appeared, Shelly found it a little strange, and it also made Shelly a little flustered.

“Mommy, who is she?” Bella looked at the woman in front of her and asked innocently.

Shelly pursed her lips, not knowing how to introduce the woman in front of her to Bella.

When Katie heard Bella’s voice, she burst into tears.

“Bella, I’m your mother. I’m your real mother,” she suddenly said excitedly. She was so excited that she immediately went up to hug Bella. However, her enthusiasm frightened Bella, and she quickly hid behind Shelly.

“Don’t come over. I’m scared. Don’t…” Bella was so frightened that she began to cry.

Hence, Shelly held Bella in her arms and said, “Katie, calm down. You’ll scare Bella.”

Katie’s tears kept flowing. She hurriedly nodded and said, “Yes, yes, yes. I was too excited. I just saw Bella, and 1-”

“Why are you looking for me?” Shelly asked straightforwardly, as if she had heard enough from Katie.

Upon hearing that, Katie kept quiet for a long time. After a while, she mustered up the courage to say, “Shelly, return Bella to me!”

Shelly’s expression darkened, and she hugged Bella tightly.. She could not believe that after abandoning Bella for so many years and not being there when Bella needed her the most, Katie wanted Bella back!
