Chapter 1699: It Turns Out That Shelly Really Doesn ‘t Like Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the first week that Shelly and Nox officially started living together, Nox stayed at home every day and was always around Shelly. Even though he went back to work a week later, he would start and end work on time and come home before sundown. It even made Shelly think that Nox had become a good man.

One day after living together for a month, Shelly woke up early to make breakfast for Nox. As soon as she walked out of the room, she saw the door open, and Mrs. Winter walked in with a bag of food. Mrs. Winter was stunned when she saw Shelly in her pajamas.

At that moment, Shelly found the situation a little awkward as the Winters probably did not know that she and Nox were living together. Nox had wanted to bring her back to the Winters once, but she refused on the basis that they should wait a while longer when she was ready.

In truth, she was waiting for Nox to lose interest in her after some time, so she did not want to involve the Winters in their matters and alarm them. Yet, she still bumped into Mrs. Winter in the end.

They looked at each other for a long time before Mrs. Winter asked, “Shelly, are you back together with Nox?”

Shelly pursed her lips. “Yeah.”

“Why didn’t you tell me that you both were back together? If you did, I wouldn’t have come over so abruptly. It wouldn’t be good if I bumped into something, would it?” Mrs. Winter said with a smile.

She did not reject the idea of them getting back together. In fact, the Winters had always hoped they would be together. However, Nox resisted Shelly so much that there was nothing they could do. Now that they both could be together again, she was naturally happy.

“I told Nox not to tell you. We’re still in the process of getting used to each other, so I don’t want you to worry.” Shelly came up with an excuse.

“What’s there to worry about? Our family will be happy that you and Nox are back together, especially Nox’s grandfather. He has always wanted you and Nox to be together,” Mrs. Winter said enthusiastically.

“Yes,” Shelly replied, not knowing what to say.

She felt that her relationship with the Winters was still a little awkward because of Nox.

“By the way, I’ve made some baked beans and eggs for Nox, so it’s good you’re here. You can have some too.” Mrs. Winter walked into the living room. “I was worried Nox wouldn’t be eating well since he’s living alone. But now that you’re here, I’m rest assured.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Shelly took the Tupperware filled with baked beans and eggs. “I’ll heat it up. After he wakes up, he can have it before he leaves for work.”

“Alright.”

When Shelly took the baked beans and eggs to the kitchen, she could not help but heave a sigh of relief. Facing the Winters was still pretty stressful for her.

While she was heating up the baked beans and eggs in the kitchen for breakfast, Mrs. Winter was in the living room watching TV, looking very relaxed.

After a while, Bella woke up. She opened the door and walked out of the room in a daze.

“Mommy.” She walked to the kitchen and called out to Shelly, who quickly put down what she was doing.

At that moment, Mrs. Winter naturally saw Bella walking out barefooted.

With Bella in her arms, Shelly looked back at Mrs. Winter and explained, “This is my daughter, Bella. You should know her.”

“I do, I do. She’s much older now.” Mrs. Winter could not help but sigh as she looked at Bella. “She’s three years old.”

“Time flies.”

“Yes.” Shelly smiled and said to Bella, “This is your grandma.”

Bella looked at Mrs. Winter, and after a long while, she said, “Hello, Grandma.” “What a good girl, you are.” Mrs. Winter smiled brightly. “Come and let me hug you. ”

Bella, who was a little scared of strangers, quickly hid in Shelly’s arms, making Mrs. Winter a little embarrassed.

Shelly explained, “Bella has been with me since she was young, so she’s shy with others. She’ll be fine after some time.”

“I know. Nox was like this when he was young too.” Mrs. Winter expressed her understanding. “I’ll get Bella washed up first.”

“Go ahead.”

With that, Shelly carried Bella to her room to help her with washing her face and brushing her teeth.

At that moment, Nox woke up as well. He opened the door and was about to look for Shelly when he saw his mother sitting in the living room.

“Mom, why are you here?” Nox asked lazily.

“If I hadn’t come, how would I know that you and Shelly got back together?” Mrs. Winter said reproachfully.

Nox smiled. “Are you happy now?”

“I’m happy, but…” Mrs. Winter looked in the direction where Shelly and Bella left and said, “You’re raising a child when you haven’t even gotten married yet.” “Mom, you can’t be so old-fashioned in your thinking!” Nox said righteously..
