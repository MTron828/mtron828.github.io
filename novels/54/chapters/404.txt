Chapter 405: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship

“In that case, your father can go home. I’ll stay here with you.”

“How can my father leave you?” Monica deliberately said.

Gary glanced at his daughter.

Ruby, on the contrary, was a little embarrassed. She said, “You child! Your father and I are an old married couple. How can we be inseparable?”

“I can see very clearly that my father can’t wait to spend his every day with you. I just don’t understand. How can you two have such a good relationship even after so many years?” Monica looked serious. “Do you have any advice to give? In the future, I want Finn and I to be like the two of you.”

“What advice is there to give? If you treat each other honestly, the relationship will only improve for the better.” Ruby put away her bowls and sat beside Monica. “Monica, a relationship cannot last if it’s half-hearted, and the most unacceptable thing is to be deceived. If you want to maintain a good relationship, you must treat each other sincerely and never hide your feelings. If you have anything, you must say it out loud. Do you understand?”

“Okay.” Monica nodded obediently.

She would definitely be honest with Finn in the future.

Her smile was very bright.

“Regarding you and Michael, you must break it off completely.” Ruby did not forget to remind Monica.

“Yes, I will.”

After all, she did not want anything to affect her relationship with Finn right now.

Once Finn came out of the intensive care unit, she had to be with him and him only.

......

“Um, Mom.” Monica said, “You and dad shouldn’t stay with me tonight. If you do, I’ll always rely on you, and I won’t grow up. Now, I want to be more mature and independent to be with Finn. In the future, I want to be a good wife like Mom.”

“...You? A good wife?” Gary shook his head.

“Dad!”

“Okay, okay, okay. I’ll go back with your dad tonight.” Ruby quickly tried to smooth things over. “If you get scared tonight, give your dad and me a call. We’ll come over right away.”

“Okay.” Monica smiled.

Her smile was always clean and pure.

Sometimes, Ruby would also lament that her daughter was not capable of much. Since she was young, she always seemed a little inferior to other children. However, every time Ruby saw her smile, she felt nothing else was important as long as Monica was happy.

At night, Gary and Ruby really did leave the ward.

Ruby repeatedly reminded Monica to call if there was anything before she finally left the hospital even though she was still worried.

After leaving the hospital, Monica wanted to call Michael.

However, just as she picked up the phone, Michael was already at the door to the ward.

Monica was a little surprised.

Michael said, “I saw your parents leave.”

“...How long have you been waiting?” Monica asked.

“I came over right after work.”

He got off work at 6 p.m., so that meant he had waited at the hospital entrance for more than two hours.

Monica simply looked at Michael, not knowing how to respond to him.

Michael did not show any emotions either. He walked into the ward and sat on the stool beside Monica’s ward.

Just like that, the two of them looked at each other.

Monica said, “Michael, I plan to be with Finn.”

Michael nodded as if he knew.

“I’m sorry. I thought that the two of us could start over, but now I realize that the opportunity for us to be together has passed,” Monica said quietly.

“I was a step too late,” Michael said bluntly.

Monica looked at him.

“I was a step too late the day before yesterday.” Michael muttered, “If I had found you earlier, and if I was in an accident with you...”

“No, Michael.” Monica quickly said, “It’s not what you think. I wasn’t moved by Finn. Well, I was, but the real reason is that I still like Finn.”

Michael’s eyes moved slightly.

At that moment, his eyes were filled with rage. However, it was hidden under his reddened eyes, so Monica could not notice it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

What did she mean by she still liked Finn?

After so many years, was it still Finn?

Monica said, “I admit I was moved by Finn during the accident the day before yesterday, but that’s really not the point. The point is, I know that Finn loves me very much.”

Michael pursed his lips, trying hard to hide his emotions.

“All the conflicts between Finn and me back then came from the fact that I thought Finn didn’t like me. However, now that the conflict has been resolved, I don’t want to hide my feelings anymore. Michael, I’m sorry. I think I might have used you.”

Michael stared fixedly at Monica.

That was Monica. Perhaps she did not know how much harm she had caused the other party by saying that, and she just wanted to clarify things.

“Whether it was you telling me to start a new relationship when I broke up with Finn back then or you saying we should start again when you came back, I think I was just using you to help me forget about Finn. In fact, all along, he has been the only one I like.”

“Don’t you feel anything when you’re with me?” Michael asked her, his eyes red.

Monica actually felt bad for Michael.

She always thought that with his family background, he should not settle with her.

“I’m very happy when I’m with you. I think you’re very good to me. Unlike Finn, you won’t make me angry or cry, but... all my friends can give me what you’ve given me. Although what Finn has given me may be pain, hurt, or many things that make me feel bad, only he can do that.”

That meant Micahel was just a friend who could make her happy, whereas Finn was her lover — the person she truly loved!

The rage in Michael’s eyes intensified.
