1070 Do You Want To Reconcile With Finn?

However, he had failed, and Monica had escaped just like that!

The back of his hand was a bloody mess, and at that moment, he did not seem to feel pain. He picked up the phone and dialed a number again. “Kill her again!”

This time, there was no need for a process. He wanted her shot dead!

In the end, he received a report from the other party half an hour later. “Mr. Ross, there are many bodyguards around Monica. For the time being, we can’t get close to her!”

“Bam!”

Michael punched the wall again, covering it in his blood.

He was furious!

Monica! He would kill her sooner or later! He definitely would!

…

The next day, Monica left the villa.

She did not go to the hospital the night before, and suddenly, she did not feel like going anymore.

She would go to work numbly and then go to fight Michael to the death.

Just as she walked out of the villa, there were at least five men in black suits standing respectfully in front of her.

Monica pursed her lips.

She did not even know if those people were there to kill her.

“Ms. Cardellini, we are Mr. Winter’s men. We’re here to protect you,” the leader in a black suit said respectfully.

Did she need so many of them? They all probably could not even fit in one car.

“Ms. Cardellini, please get in the car.” The man in the black suit opened the car door for her respectfully.

Monica gritted her teeth but still sat in.

Then, she watched as two men in black suits get into the same car as her, while the other three got into the car behind them and followed behind their car.

Even though…

Nevertheless, she was very grateful for Nox’s kindness.

After all, with Michael’s personality, if he failed the first time, he would try a second time. If he failed the second time, he would try a third time!

She would not be safe until she had completely suppressed Michael!

She sat in the car and looked at the streets of South Hampton City. It was quiet in the car until her phone rang.

She picked up the call. “Nox.”

“He’s not dead,” Nox said bluntly.

Monica pursed her lips.

In fact, she had already thought it through.

It did not matter if the man died or not. After all, Michael would not dare to testify against her, and she could go against her conscience and pretend that nothing had happened.

However, she was still an ordinary person. To an ordinary person, not killing anyone would naturally make her feel more at ease.

“Thank you,” she said sincerely.

“Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine case will be brought to court tomorrow. As the plaintiff, there are some things that I need to tell you.”

“I’m on my way to the office.”

“I’ll be there in half an hour.”

“Alright.”

Monica hung up the phone. Then, she looked at the sunlight outside the car window, watching the scattered sunlight shining on the wide road.

However, it did not warm Monica’s heart no matter what.

The car soon arrived at Cardellini Enterprise’s building.

Monica told Tim to make her a cup of black coffee, and before drinking the coffee, she took a pill.

She had just taken it when Nox pushed the door open and entered.

“Please sit,” Monica said.

Everything that happened last night seemed to have become a thing of the past, and Monica had returned to normal.

However, Nox did not find it strange anymore. After having interacted with her the last few days, he was very well that Monica had really changed.

At the very least, she could take on everything.

He sat opposite Monica, and his eyes paused for a moment.

Subtly, he looked at the box of medicine beside Monica’s hand and watched as Monica drank her coffee casually.

“Do you want coffee? Monica asked.

“No.” Nox said bluntly, “I’ll make it short.”

“Alright.”

“The police have already verified that Brie and the director of the quality inspection department were the culprits behind Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine incident. With sufficient evidence, they will be sentenced.”

“I heard that Brie has disappeared and that the police still haven’t found her,” Monica said bluntly.

“That’s not important. What’s important is that you have to testify against Michael and insist that Michael instructed Brie to do it.”

“Will it work?” Monica asked Nox, “Michael should’ve already thought of a way out and an excuse for himself.”

...

“It’ll work!” Nox was very sure.

Monica nodded. “Alright. I will sue Michael in court. Since Brie isn’t here, and even if there’s no evidence, I can still ruin Michael. The Sanders should despise Michael now. If we let him suffer a little more, he might be completely abandoned by the Sanders.”

In the end, Nox did not tell her more.

He continued, “After suing Michael, we will sue Sunny Pharmaceutical for stealing Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development technology!”

“Will the court try them together?”

“Yes. I’ve secretly gotten my men to install invisible cameras in the court. When the time comes, through George, the court session will be made public on the Internet. You just need to be firm in court and make the court have no choice but to try this case! Most importantly, the Sanders might not expect there to be any major problems during this trial, so they probably didn’t inform the relevant personnel in advance. But if we appeal through formal channels, it’s very likely that we’ll be suppressed by the Sanders halfway through. At that point, it’ll really be difficult to make it public! This is the best opportunity I can think of at the moment. It’s the best chance we have at making Michael step down and revive Cardellini Enterprise. We can’t miss this opportunity.”

Monica looked at Nox and nodded. “Okay.”

She had done her best, and anyway, she was not afraid of anything now.

Even if they pestered and threaten her with her life tomorrow, she would still let their case go to trial.

“I won’t say much about other things, but I’ve already made all the necessary arrangements.” Nox looked at Monica. “It will all depend on your performance tomorrow.”

“Thank you,” Monica said sincerely.

...

Nox looked at her closely.

During this period of time, Monica had thanked him a little too much. It was not that he did not appreciate it, but rather… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He said, “Monica, do you regret it?”

Did she regret putting herself in this position for Michael?

“Nox, what do you think?” Monica asked him back.

If she did not regret it, she would not have worked so hard and done all that she had.

“Do you want to reconcile with Finn?” Nox asked her.

Well, he had to admit that his heart ached for Monica.

Last night, all he could see was Monica’s thin and frail body, and he could not take it anymore.

If Monica really regretted it and realized her mistake, he would think of all ways to help her matchmake her with Finn.

Nox always felt that Finn was not as cold as he appeared to be.

If he was really indifferent to Monica, even if he was helping Monica to save Cardellini Enterprise out of gratitude, how could he explain the panic he felt when he went to save Monica last night even though he tried to hide it?

Since Finn still had feelings for Monica and Monica regretted it, Nox decided that he would play the good guy and let the lovers finally be together.

However, at that moment, he heard Monica say, “I don’t want to.”

She really did not want to.
