She Imew how powerful the Winters were, and finding someone for them was just a matter of minutes.

“Nothing. I just came to see Nox, and I remembered that you were in the hospital too, so I came to see you,” Wade said casually.

“Nox is in the hospital?” Shelly was surprised.

Was not he getting married? How did he end up in the hospital?

“Didn’t you see the news?” Wade asked.

“I watched a little while waiting for Bella when she was undergoing surgery. I saw Nox preparing for the ceremony, and then Bella came out, so I didn’t have time to watch,” Shelly explained. “Did something happen?”

“Oh, something big happened. You’ll know when you watch the news later,” Wade said.

“Alright.” Shelly did not ask further.

If Nox was hospitalized, nothing good must have happened.

“Mommy,” Bella suddenly called out to Shelly weakly.

Shelly quickly turned around and looked at Bella. “What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”

“No, I want Mom to hold my little hand,” Bella said like a spoiled child.

Ever since she came out of the operating theater, she had not felt safe.

“Alright.” Shelly quickly held Bella’s hand with a gentle look on her face.

Wade watched the interaction between Shelly and Bella and could not understand why Nox was so blind to have chosen Zoe over Shelly. He did not even want to admit that Nox was his biological grandson.

He said, “Shelly, I won’t disturb you from taking care of Bella. Take care and rest well. Don’t tire yourself out. I’ll head off now.” “Let me send you off, Grandpa Winter.” “There’s no need. Bella is so dependent on you. Stay with her.”

“Yes.” Shelly nodded with an apologetic smile.

Wade also smiled and left the hospital after that.

Shelly looked at Grandpa Winter’s back and sighed. Actually, other than Nox, the Winters treated her really well. Even though Nox’s mother had refused to allow her to bring Bella back, she knew that deep down, Nox’s mother was good to her.

When she turned back around, she saw that Bella’s eyes were closed, as if she was about to fall asleep. That was when Shelly realized why Bella wanted her to hold her hand. It turned out that Bella wanted to sleep but was afraid that Shelly would leave.

She lowered her head and caressed Bella’s cheek. “Go to sleep. Mommy will stay with you.”

Bella nodded obediently and soon fell asleep, with Shelly staying by her side. Since Bella was asleep and Shelly had nothing to do, she took out her phone and saw the news about Nox.

Previously, it was a long story about the wedding. Now, it was about Nox getting cuckolded! Shelly clicked on a random piece of news, and only then did she know what had happened.

It turned out that the moment she put down her phone, Nox’s wedding had taken a dramatic turn. The fact that Zoe cheated on Nox was exposed at the wedding, and most importantly, the person exposed was Nox’s grandpa, the kind Grandpa Winter who had just come to see her. Was Grandpa Winter trying to kill his grandson?

She finally understood why Nox was hospitalized. The news said that he fainted from anger and then had a concussion. However, Shelly felt nothing as she watched the news. She just… did not expect it to happen.

At that moment, she could not help but sigh at how soft-hearted Grandpa Winter was. Although the scandal on the wedding day was a little infuriating, at least Nox and Zoe did not get married.

She was still hoping that after Nox married Zoe, he would have countless children who were not his — or maybe one of them would be his. That way, the two of them would be entangled with each other for the rest of their lives, and Nox would be cuckolded for the rest of his life.

Ultimately, although Grandpa Winter’s way of handling things was not very kind, he was still on Nox’s side. Upon realizing that, Shelly only thought it was a pity and nothing else.

Out of boredom, she opened the comments section. When she saw the comments in the comments section, she was about to die of laughter.

Other people would usually be sympathetic when someone was cuckolded, but Nox being cuckolded was entertainment to the public. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

It was probably because Old Master Winter exposed Nox’s sorry state so unreasonably that the other netizens did not show mercy to Nox. She even saw some comments saying that Nox was using his life to entertain the public!

Someone said, “Does Nox think that not much on the news has been trending lately, so he’s offering himself?”

There were also people who said, “Come, come, come. Let’s raise funds from the public and give Nox an award!”

Shelly thought she would die laughing from reading the comments one day.

At that moment, she could not help but laugh out loud.

“Is it that funny?” Beside her, a cold male voice suddenly sounded..
