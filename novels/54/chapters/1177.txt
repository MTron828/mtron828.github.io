1178 The Cunning Warren, Nox Shows Up Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne gritted her teeth and rolled over a few times on the ground.

She knew that if she stayed on the ground, she would die without a doubt. Hence, she could only think of a way to leave.

She stood up as fast as she could and ran in a certain direction. The bullets continued to shoot past her. Perhaps in the next second, she would be shot dead.

At that critical moment, Jeanne quickly jumped into a black car.

Warren glanced at Jeanne, not expecting her to catch up to him so quickly.

When the explosion erupted, he was protected by his men, and the next moment, he was covered. Since he could not board the helicopter, he quickly chose to escape in a car. In an emergency, he could not think of Jeanne’s life and got into the car to leave.

Now that Jeanne had escaped on her own, she was considered lucky.

He ordered his men to drive away.

He did not need to think to know that it was the Duncans, but he did not expect them to catch up so quickly.

Warren was someone who had seen many things, so he did not show too much panic at the moment and calmly ordered everyone to evacuate.

With that, a few cars drove madly on the remote streets. The car was going faster and faster until it suddenly braked.

Warren and Jeanne were almost sent flying.

Jeanne covered her abdomen with her hand and clutched the armrest tightly, trying her best not to make a sound.

“What’s the situation?!” Warren asked.

“Leader, the road ahead is a dead end!”

“Trash!” Warren cursed.

“Everyone, get out of the car!” Warren ordered.

At that moment, besides Warren and Jeanne, only three other people were in the car. As the explosion was too sudden, only the three subordinates in the car behind managed to keep up with them. In total, there were only six people left to protect them.

Once his opponents behind caught up to him, they would definitely die.

After getting out of the car, everyone quickly made their way into the guillotine and walked into a forest.

No one dared waste any more time and kept moving forward while contacting the rescue team. Once the rescue team arrived, they would be out of danger.

Just like that, they walked for quite some distance.

Behind them, another gunshot suddenly rang out. It was obvious that the people behind had caught up.

“Leader, they’re close,” one of his subordinates reported.

Furious, Warren asked, “How long until reinforcement arrives?”

“They’re flying a helicopter over now. They’ll be here in about half an hour.”

Warren made a prompt decision. “The two of you, go over there and draw them away!”

“Yes!” Having received the order, two of them quickly went to the other side.

Then, soul-stirring gunfight sounded in the forest.

Jeanne followed Warren closely, and there were four other people beside Warren.

There was still half an hour to go before Warren’s reinforcements arrived.

“Bang!” Suddenly, another gunshot rang out from behind, and it sounded extremely close. It was as if it was just around them.

Everyone quickly hid in the bushes.

They knew that with their current speed, the other party would catch up with them soon. Once the other party caught up, they would be shot to death without any cover.

They had just taken cover when they heard many footsteps around them and saw bright military flashlights everywhere.

Jeanne held her breath, and Warren was too. He was waiting for the other party to leave.

However, the other party also seemed to stop for only a moment before they quickly ran foward.

The people hiding in the bushes heaved a sigh of relief.

After confirming that the other party had left, they quickly came out of their hiding place and wanted to leave in another direction.

Just as they stood up, they saw the people who had left appear in front of them from all directions, instantly surrounded by people.

It was as if they were waiting for them to show themselves.

Warren’s expression changed when the light from the military flashlight suddenly shone on his and a few other people’s face.

Warren was protected closely by his four men, and the people surrounding them did not fire immediately.

All they did was surround Warren and company, leaving the latter with no place to escape.

Then, a person walked out slowly from the crowd.

It was Nox, who looked frivolous but a little smug. He said, “Leader, considering you’re so old, you must be tired after all that running!”

“You traitor!” Warren shouted at Nox.
