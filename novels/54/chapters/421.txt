Chapter 422: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

“Are you going to see Finn?”

“Of course.”

“You almost let Finn die.”

Monica bit her lip unconsciously.

“If you don’t like him, I advise you to stay away from him.”

“Who says I don’t like him?” Monica suddenly became abnormally agitated.

Nox looked at her.

“I like him so much that I can’t live without him!” Monica’s voice was a little loud. “Forget it. Anyway, a person like you who has never been in a relationship and has never liked a woman will never understand.”

Nox found that Monica always liked to humiliate him.

“I have never been in a relationship, but at least I know that having two lovers at the same time is a trashy move!”

“Michael and I broke up.”

Nox was stunned.

......

That girl was quite efficient!

“We broke up, and I’m only going to live the rest of my days with Finn. Do you understand? Don’t stand in my way.” Monica seemed very anxious to see Finn. At that moment, her tone sounded impatient. “I’m even planning to have a baby with Finn!”

“...Finn can’t stand your torment right now,” Nox reminded her in a serious tone.

It was rare for Monica to respond to Nox.

Her mind was filled with thoughts of Finn, and she felt she was going crazy for not having seen him for a week.

She had to see him right away.

Nox saw Monica’s burning desire to go in, so he did not stop her and stepped aside instead.

As Monica pushed the door open and walked in, Nox turned his head to take a look.

Then, with a nonchalant smile on his face, he left.

The moment Monica pushed the door open, walked into the ward, and saw Finn in the ward in front of her, she suddenly froze on the spot.

Her heart was beating very fast, but it was also aching.

She did not know why her heart would hurt so much the moment she saw Finn. In fact, over the last few days, whenever she thought of Finn’s name, she would feel that way.

Her eyes reddened.

Looking at Finn in front of her, her vision suddenly blurred.

She really wanted to thank God for not taking Finn away, the man she really loved.

She stood at the door for a long time before limping to Finn’s side.

Finn seemed to be sound asleep as his eyes were closed.

Monica did not dare to disturb him, so she moved as quietly as possible and sat by his bed. Then, she placed her walking stick aside and continued to look at him.

He seemed to have lost a lot of weight, and his chin had some stubble.

She continued to look at him intently as if she was afraid that Finn would disappear in the next second. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Her small hand held his hand.

Then, something dripped on his hand. She did not dare to use too much strength, so she placed her entire hand in his palm and felt the warmth from it.

She realized she could watch Finn like that for the rest of his life…

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

After that, a middle-aged nurse walked in into the room. She asked respectfully, “Is Dr. Jones asleep?”

“Shh,” Monica told her to lower her voice.

The nurse hurriedly nodded. “I’m here to help Dr. Jones to wipe his body. When Dr. Jones is awake, please let me know. I’ll wait in the room outside.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

The moment she nodded, she felt that something was wrong.

She hurriedly called out to the nurse, “What did you just say?”

The nurse was stunned for a moment before she replied, “I said I’m here to help Dr. Jones wipe his body.”

“Wipe his body?” Monica’s eyes were bulging. “Wipe his entire body?”

“Yes, that’s right,” the nurse hurriedly said.

“Wipe there too?” Monica asked.

The nurse was embarrassed by Monica’s question.

As nurses, it was normal for them to take care of patients and do many things that patients could not do! Besides, she was already over 50 years old. What else could she do?

Monica knew from the nurse’s expression that it must be.

F*ck! F*ck! If she had not even touched it yet, how could that old woman?

She was really angry.

She said, “I’ll help him wipe his body when he wakes up later.”

The nurse looked at Monica.

“I’ll do a good job. Now, hurry up and leave.”

‘And don’t let me see you.’

The nurse could only listen to Monica’s instructions. At that moment, she could not help but remind Monica, “Dr. Jones has a lot of wounds on his body. When you’re helping him, be careful not to touch his wounds. Where the bandages are, try not to get them wet. The doctor said that it can get easily infected. Also, when you help Dr. Jones to wipe his body, be sure to turn the air conditioner up a few degrees. The doctor specifically emphasized that Dr. Jones shouldn’t catch a cold during such times.”
