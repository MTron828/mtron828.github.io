Chapter 619: How Could Finn Forget Me So Easily?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica looked at Finn leaving indifferently and bit her lips to control her tears from falling.

Why could Finn not believe her for once? Why did he have to make her feel so bad?

Every time, she was the one making the decision, but in the end, the person suffering the most was always her.

How much did Finn love her?

He loved her so much that he could forget her so easily and not care about her.

…

As Finn returned to the hall, Gary and Ruby had just finished paying their respects to Old Master Lawrence and were about to leave.

When they saw Finn, Gary took the initiative to go over.

Finn still treated them with respect. “Uncle, auntie.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

That was the first time they met after Finn and Monica’s divorce.

Gary felt a knot in his heart as he realized that the way they addressed each other had changed.

Ruby also felt a lump in her throat. She did not expect Finn and Monica’s marriage to end just like that.

Fortunately, the two of them did not make things too difficult for Finn. Gary even responded and asked, “Why are you here?”

“Fourth Master Swan had some matters to attend to and couldn’t come back, so he told me to accompany Jeanne. He was afraid she would be bullied if she were alone.”

“I see.” Gary nodded and could not help but say, “The Lawrences has indeed surprised me. It’s good that you’re here to accompany them. Otherwise, I’d be worried about Jeannie being here alone. However, you’ve just been discharged from the hospital. How’s your health? Can you handle it? If you can’t, I’ll arrange for you to–”

“Uncle, he’s not your son-in-law anymore,” Sarah reminded him.

Gary paused and smiled helplessly. Then, he patted Finn’s shoulder and found it hard to continue the conversation.

Finn, on the other hand, was very calm. He said, “Don’t worry. I’m fine now.”

“If you need any help, just let me know. No matter what, I watched you grow up. Our relationship will not change no matter what happens.”

“Thank you, uncle.” Finn thanked him sincerely.

“It’s getting late. Don’t you have a business meeting at night?” Ruby said at the right time.

She was also afraid that Finn would be too awkward around them. After all, their identities had changed. Hence, he might feel a little uncomfortable.

“In that case, we’ll leave first.”

“Take care.” Finn walked them to the door.

Throughout the entire time, Monica did not show up to meet her parents.

In fact, Monica had forgotten that she was hiding from her parents as she was crying her heart out.

By the time she calmed down, it was an hour later.

Her eyes were swollen from crying, and her makeup was all messed up.

She walked up to Jeanne, who almost laughed out loud.

If it were not for Jonathan’s funeral and the fact that she had to look sad, she would have laughed so hard at Monica.

She endured it. “Those who don’t know would think that between the two of us, your grandfather was the one who died.”

“Who are you cursing?” Monica was a little angry.

After all, her grandfather was still alive and well.

However, now that he was old, he did not care about the company’s matters anymore. He spent most of his time traveling around the world with her grandmother and rarely came back.

That old couple was even more carefree than the young people.

“Yes, yes, yes. I won’t jinx it.” Jeanne quickly corrected herself.

Monica was not a calculative person. Moreover, she was extremely depressed right now, so she was not in the mood to bicker with Jeanne.

“What’s wrong? You cried until your makeup has smudged?” Jeanne asked her.

“Your makeup has smudged! Mine is fine!” Monica stubbornly refused to admit it.

“Did Finn trigger something?”

Monica’s eyes reddened again.

“Since you’ve made a decision, you should let it be.”

“What decision did I make?” Monica was speechless.

“You’ve chosen Michael,” Jeanne could see it clearly.

“I’m only helping him. Don’t you believe me?”

“What’s the use of me believing you? Dr. Jones doesn’t believe you.” Jeanne hit the nail on the head. “Monica, between adults, actions speak louder than words.”

Monica felt something in her chest as if she could not catch her breath.

Jeanne also did not want to agitate Monica anymore. “Go wash your face. You look like a ghost.”

“Who’s a ghost?” Monica flew into a rage.

Jeanne smiled faintly.

It was good that Monica could get angry. At least that meant Monica was not at her lowest.

In fact, Jeanne knew true pain was when one had lost all hope in this world.

After that, she continued to greet the people who came.

She was not doing it to send the deceased Jonathan on his last journey. After all, she did not regret Jonathan’s death, but she just wanted to put on a show for others.

Then, when all of the Lawrences’ assets were given to her, people would not gossip about it behind her back.

The day passed just like that.

Late at night, Jeanne was glad she slept pretty well last night. Hence, she should be able to stay up all night tonight.

However, Monica was very sleepy. She kept yawning as she could not hold on any longer.

In fact, she did not sleep much when she went back for her so-called afternoon nap because all she thought about was Finn.

She felt that Finn helping Jeanne today was very chivalrous of him, and it caught her heart.

Compared to Michael today... Michael might have had more to worry about since he was young, so his actions were understandable.

Monica yawned again.

She wanted to stay up all night with Jeanne, but it was strange.

She had not been able to sleep all night during the past few days, yet today, she was suddenly very sleepy.

‘Am I possessed?’ she thought,

“Let’s go back.” Unbeknownst to her, Jeanne had walked up to her side.

Monica forced herself to hold on. “No, I’ll stay with you.”

“Alright. If you want to stay with me, come over tomorrow, but tonight, go back.”

“Aren’t you afraid of being alone?” The crowd would die down tonight.

With so few people around, was Jeannie not afraid?

“I’m a just person. What should I be scared of? Besides, I’m not the one who should be afraid!” Jeanne glanced at Jenifer, who was standing at the side.

For the entire day, Jenifer had been holding herself up and greeting the guests. She was very courteous, which also made many people view Jenifer in a different light.

“It’s past midnight. Go back,” Jeanne urged.

“You–”

“Dr. Jones,” Jeanne suddenly called out to Finn, who was standing at a corner of the hall.

Finn raised his head.

“Can you send Monica home for me? She doesn’t have a car, and it’s not safe for her to go back alone at night. I can’t leave either.”

Monica thought Finn would not agree.

She was even prepared to be rejected.

However, at that moment, Finn said, “Okay.”

That one word made Monica utterly dumbfounded!
