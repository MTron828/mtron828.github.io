1323 Asking For Hand in Marriage

Candice stared wide-eyed at Edward in the car, who was so close to her.

She felt their lips pressed tightly against each other for a few seconds.

Candice moved away from Edward’s lips.

When they parted, she clearly saw Edward lick his lips.

Candice’s face turned red. Such lewdness. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Before she interacted with Edward, she would have no idea that he was such a person. She did not even treat him as a real man.

Unexpectedly… he was so down-to-earth, so flirtatious.

She said, “I’m home.”

“Yes.” His voice was clearly a little hoarse.

“I’m heading in.”

“Yeah.”

However, a certain someone’s hand did not let go.

Candice blushed.

It was just that the two of them were not very familiar with each other, but they had clearly done a lot of intimate things. She felt that the progress was much faster than she had expected.

The two of them were in a deadlock. It was unknown how long the stalemate lasted.

Candice had a feeling that Edward did not want to let her go back.

She heard him say, “I have a lot of work to do this month.”

Candice was stunned. He suddenly started talking about other things, and it was so natural.

“So I might spend less time with you.” Edward’s magnetic voice was still a little husky.

“It’s okay,” Candice said quickly.

If she married him, she would marry the Chief of Harken. She would be prepared for it.

In fact, when Edward did not do that to her today and caused her to be caught off guard, she really felt that everything between them was going by the book. A date was a date, and a marriage was a marriage. There would not be anything ordinary couples would not do, such as… flirting.

Edward was clearly flirting with her today.

She was really flattered by his actions.

“The wedding ceremony will be regarded with the etiquette as the Chief’s, so it will be very grand. There’ll be a lot of formalities, and it’ll be bigger than you imagine. I hope you can understand.”

“Understandable.” Candice nodded.

She had long thought about all the things she would face in this political marriage. There was no hope to begin with, so there was no hope at all.

“There will be many things you need to cooperate with during the wedding preparations this month,” Edward said. “Try your best to make time for it.”

“Okay.” Candice nodded obediently.

Such an obedient look… Edward’s eyes seemed to emit a trace of helplessness.

Candice could not understand what he was feeling helpless about. It was as if he was looking at her as if she was another person. He did not seem to see the person he wanted. Instead, there was a hint of regret.

Candice was distracted for a second.

“Head in and rest early. Good night.” Edward let go of Candice’s hand.

The reluctance was apparent, yet he still let go of her.

Candice felt a little disappointed when he did so. She could not believe it herself. It was just a day of spending time together yet that had changed her feelings so much.

Previously, her attitude toward Edward was that she needed to adapt to a man she had no choice but to marry. After today, she felt that she could try to like him.

At the thought of this, Candice’s heart skipped a beat.

It was naturally different from his feelings for Paige and George.

This feeling… was really the kind between a man and a woman.

She bit her lip. She could not believe that she would fall in love with a man again so quickly!

But then again… Had she ever loved him?!

Why did she start to suspect that the blank memories she had lost were different from what she had been told?!

Candice tried her best to remain calm. She was so calm that she forced herself to smile.

Just then, the driver had already respectfully opened the door for her and she got out of the car.

She turned around to look at Edward. He probably did not expect her to turn around, so he was caught off guard and she saw the deep love in Edward’s eyes.

It was as if they shared a deep bond. It was as if… he had loved her for a long time.

Facing his gaze, her heart suddenly ached. It was an indescribable pain.

It was as if… she had experienced it before.

However, in the next second, when she wanted to find out more, the deep love in Edward’s eyes instantly disappeared.

It was as if what she had just experienced was just an illusion.

She said, “Good night.”
