Nox was shocked. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“S-S-She smiled at me,” Nox said excitedly.

“Are you sure?” Monica did not believe him.

“Finn, did you see that? Your daughter smiled at me. Does she like me?” Nox asked excitedly.

Finn pursed his lips. He was clearly unhappy. His daughter had never smiled at him before, yet she smiled at Nox.

“I told you I was charming, right? I can charm an 80-year-old granny to a newborn baby,” Nox said smugly.

The others were speechless at Nox. However, they had to admit that there would be joy wherever Nox was.

Nox held the baby in his arms. Although the way he held her was still a little off, he could not bear to part with her. Finn wanted to hold her several times, but Nox rejected him every time. As Finn had never liked to argue with Nox since he was young, he had to silently endure it.

From time to time, cheerful chatter sounded in the room, and they truly experienced the great joy that the birth of a child could bring!

Suddenly, the door of the ward was pushed open again. It was Sarah, and behind her was Shelly, who felt a little awkward when she saw Nox in the ward.

In the morning, Nox had asked her if she wanted to go and see Monica’s baby, but she refused. She said that she was not feeling well and wanted to rest. She thought that Nox would come in the morning, so she did not expect him to be here in the afternoon.

In the afternoon, it was Sarah who called her and asked her to accompany her to see her cousin’s baby. She figured that Bella would be back later after school today, so she agreed under Sarah’s pestering. However, now that she had bumped into Nox, she felt a little… bad.

When Nox saw Shelly, he was very calm. It was as if nothing had happened that morning, and he held the baby without any other expression on his face.

Shelly also tried her best to pretend that nothing was wrong.

“Cousin, are you feeling better?” Sarah asked.

“Pretty good.” Monica responded, “Why are you alone? Where’s Brandon?”

“Isn’t he at work?” Sarah complained, “I asked if he wanted to come, but he was afraid that you’d deduct his salary.”

Monica was somewhat speechless. However, Brandon was truly at a disadvantage. During this period of time when she was not in the company, he was basically the one who took care of everything for her.

“I’m going to see the baby.” Sarah went over excitedly to see the two babies.

One was in Nox’s arms, and the other was in Gary’s arms.

She looked at the brother first before looking at her sister in Nox’s arms. “Let me hold her.”

Nox looked reluctant to let go. “I just got her. Go and hold the baby brother.”

“No, I want to hold the sister,” Sarah said determinedly.

However, Nox refused to compromise.

“The child is not yours.” Sarah was displeased.

She found the guy so annoying. It was no wonder Shelly did not like him.

“She’s not yours either.” “I’m her aunt.”

“I’m her godfather,” Nox blurted out.

After saying that, he quickly turned to Finn. “It’s a deal.”

Finn did not care, so he glanced at Monica. When Monica nodded, Finn nodded.

“So who do you think gets the say? Godfather or aunt?”

“Nox, you’re horrible!” Sarah was angry.

In the end, she could only settle for the next best thing and hold the brother.

Feeling smug, Nox could not help but glance at the baby in his arms. She was clearly very ugly, but he did not know why he could not bear to part with it. He finally understood how Finn felt when he became a father.

After he held her for a while, Shelly suddenly walked up to him. Actually, when she saw Nox in the ward today, she was not only surprised that he was there, but she was also surprised that he was holding the child.

She had always thought that Nox would dislike babies because she felt that with Nox’s personality, he would not be patient and have much affection for children. However, she did not expect to see Nox holding the baby gently. They looked happy.

“Do you want to hold her?” Nox asked Shelly when he saw her walking over.

Shelly was stunned. He was just fighting over the child with Sarah just now, and now he was offering for her to hold the child?

She looked at the baby in Nox’s arms. Seeing how cute she looked, she could not help but nod..
