Chapter 789: Monica and Michael’s Conflict Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the end, Reese felt a little upset.

Although she knew that her family was using Monica, she also knew that Michael really liked Monica.

The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt.

That was when a noblewoman beside her said, “Isn’t that your son, Michael? Was he so busy that he’s only just having dinner now?”

Reese came back to her senses.

She smiled. “Yeah, he’s the only one supporting the family, so he’s pretty busy every day. Considering that, he got off work relatively early today. Usually, he’d only get off work at 10 or 11 p.m. Sometimes, he might even pull an all-nighter.”

“I really envy you for having such a good son,” another noblewoman complimented her.

Then, the three of them walked into a private room.

The noblewoman continued, “Reese, was that Monica beside Michael just now?”

“Yup,” Reese nodded with a dignified smile.

No one could tell what she was feeling inside.

“She’s quite pretty and has a good figure, but I heard…” The noblewoman hesitated.

Reese glanced at them calmly

The noblewoman paused for a moment and said, “Monica likes to go to nightclubs. I have a niece who is also into that. No matter how the family disciplines her, it’s useless, and she even quarrels with her family. Hence, her parents gave up and left her to her own devices. A few days ago, my family had a gathering, and my niece was there. We all wanted to persuade her not to go to places like that, but do you know what she said?”

Reese’s expression changed.

She knew that the noblewoman had nothing good to say.

“She said it’s very normal for young people to go to nightclubs these days. She even said that the wife of the quality supervision department’s director would go with them.” The noblewoman glanced at Reese. “I’m talking about Monica. She even said that Monica is bolder than her, dancing with men on the dance floor…”

The noblewoman could not continue on.

No matter how hard Reese tried to disguise herself, her expression was unsightly.

The other noblewoman was also fanning the flames. “Reese, we think Michael is a good child. He’s so capable and promising that I have no doubt he’ll be more successful than his father in the future. He can be with any young lady from a prestigious family, yet he insists on being with Monica. Monica’s family business is not bad, but because she’s the only daughter in the family, she’s too spoiled and has no family upbringing. If she marries into your family, she’ll ruin the reputation that the Rosses have built up for so many years.”

“That’s right. Try to dissuade your son before he marries Monica.”

Reese was naturally displeased to hear that.

In fact, she was also unhappy with Monica, but her son had made it very clear to her that he was with Monica because the head of the Sanders forced him to. As such, they could not refuse.

She said coldly to the two ladies, “This is between the young people. They should solve it themselves.”

“We were just afraid that Michael, such a promising person, would fall into Monica’s hands–”

“My son likes Monica, so Monica must have her own merits. You don’t need to worry about their matters.” Reese’s tone was unpleasant.

The two ladies knew how to read the room, so they quickly changed the topic. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Meanwhile, in Michael and Monica’s private room, the waiter had just served the dishes.

Michael picked up a piece of steak and gave it to Monica. “I know you like steak. Try it.”

Monica took a look at it but did not touch her utensils.

She said, “Michael, I’ve eaten. You can eat have it.”

Michael smiled and said, “Alright.”

If she took a closer look, she would realize that almost all the dishes that Michael ordered were her favorites.

However, she pretended not to know anything.

She accompanied Michael and watched him eat with perfect manners.

Monica felt that their interactions were still a little awkward. Hence, she took out her phone and played with it.

The news of Jenifer and Eden was still trending in the headlines.

Monica tapped to open the comments and was so amused by them that she could not help but laugh.

“What’s so funny?” Michael asked.

Monica replied, “I saw someone bashing Eden.”

Michael did not reply.

Monica raised her head. Only then did she realize that Michael and Eden were friends.

She said, “Sorry, it’s just–”

“It’s fine.” Michael smiled gently. I didn’t expect Eden to be this kind of person. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have become best friends with him.”
