“As for my achievements, they surpass Eden’s by miles!” Jeanne’s words sounded loud and clear.

At the shareholder meeting, everyone stared at Jeanne while Joshua, overwhelmed by Jeanne’s aura, glared fiercely at Jeanne.

“Before returning to South Hampton City, I worked at MUK Group and immediately helped them to become the world’s largest e-commerce company. The projects I’ve won include the online marketing collaboration with James Group that earned a profit of up to 1 billion, the collaboration with Esther Group that sold out within seconds and earned a profit of up to 1.2 billion, and the Vizzi Group...” Jeanne proudly listed her previous achievements one by one. “After returning to South Hampton city and entering Lawrence Enterprise, I got us the collaboration with the MUK Group worth 2 billion dollars. This caused Lawrence Enterprise’s stock market to rise for the past three months. The sales volume of our electrical products has increased by 5 percent month-on-month, and the growth trend continues to rise. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the month-on-month growth will reach 15 percent, and the annual sales volume will increase by at least 12 percent.”

As soon as she said that, everyone in the room was shocked.

Even though they had long known about Jeanne’s achievements, they did not know why, but they were still amazed to hear it from Jeanne herself. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

When they thought about it, Jeanne had only been back for four months and working with Lawrence Enterprise for three months. Never did they imagine Jeanne would bring so much profit to the company.

Jeanne’s eyes stared straight at Joshua. “All in all, does the chairman think I don’t have the qualifications to be Lawrence Enterprise’s executive general manager?”

Joshua was really rendered speechless by what Jeanne said, and an awkward silence filled the room.

Joshua had a Bluetooth earpiece on his ear that Eden was talking to him through.

Eden could not attend Lawrence Enterprise’s shareholder meeting, so he had Joshua put on the Bluetooth earpiece. He needed to instruct Joshua on how to deal with the shareholders, how to let him smoothly enter the Lawrence Enterprise, and how to target Jeanne!

Hence, he heard Jeanne belittling him throughout the entire process.

He barely managed to come up with something to tell Joshua so that the latter would not be forced to agree to Jeanne immediately.

In front of everyone, Joshua said, “I don’t deny your capability and amazing achievements. However, you have only just started working at Lawrence Enterprise, so your experience in Harken is limited. Of course, it’s not that I disapprove of you becoming the executive general manager of Lawrence Enterprise, but we’re a shareholding company. My grandfather used to own 52 percent of the shares, but according to the shareholder rights, my grandfather had absolute control over the company, and he could appoint someone to a post directly. But now, none of us have more than 50 percent of the shares, so no one has the right to say that you will be the executive general manager.”

Jeanne looked at Joshua coldly.

She was still somewhat surprised by Joshua’s reaction.

According to her understanding of Joshua, he should not have been able to reply to her at that moment. Yet, he managed to think of all that now.

The corners of her mouth curled into a cold smile as she said, “You’re right. It requires a vote from all the shareholders to decide who will take the position of Lawrence Enterprise’s executive general manager.”

“Mr. Gray.” Joshua directly called out to Lawrence Enterprise’s secretary general.

“Yes, Chairman.” Greyson Gray appeared respectful.

“We’re taking a vote for the position of the executive general manager. You can start counting the votes,” Joshua instructed.

He said it rather domineeringly.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Now that Joshua had 43 percent of the shares, she would have no say in the company if he were to casually rope in more than seven percent of the shares.

However, she did not think Joshua had done his research in such a short period of time. He did not have the time.

Furthermore, he wanted to vote immediately because he was wary of her. He was afraid she would rope in the shareholders after the meeting.

That was why Joshua chose such a risky method, and no one knew the outcome.

Even Jeanne did not know if she had any chance of winning.

Her achievements were very significant, but Eden also had quite a reputation in Harken.

Moreover, Eden was a member of the Swans. Even though she had quite a good relationship with the Swans now, Eden was born into the Swan family. With such a powerful name, he would be able to surpass people of the same level!

At the scene, Joshua drew everyone’s attention back and said, “Shareholders, I hope you can carefully consider whether Jeanne or Eden should take the position of the executive general manager!”

All the shareholders glanced at each other, but no one spoke.

After all, Lawrence Enterprise was still in turmoil, and no one wanted to be in the limelight.
