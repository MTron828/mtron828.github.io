940 Monica Stirring Up Trouble

In this world, other than Monica, no one else would be able to talk so freely and argue with the board of directors.

In terms of playing dirty, Monica was really invincible.

The group of directors was dumbfounded and could not say a word for a long time. They were afraid that Monica would interrupt them.

They did not know where that petite little girl got her confidence and courage from to be able to criticize the board of directors to that extent.

Steve, who was beside Monica, was stunned.

He was worried that Monica would be wronged and scolded in front of the board of directors, but never in his dreams did he expect that it would turn out like that. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

None of the directors dared to open their mouths and scold Monica either.

Although that courage was not something she should be proud of, it really made people look at her in a new light.

Suddenly, he felt that Cardellini Enterprise was not completely hopeless under Monica’s management.

At that moment, Monica was still panting heavily after the argument.

Seeing that everyone had quieted down, she continued, “I’ve expressed what I wanted to say. Directors, please do as I said. If there’s any good news, remember to inform me immediately. Although I’m not capable enough, I’m full of energy. I can wait for your call 24 hours a day and follow your arrangements!

All the directors at the scene looked at each other, wondering how to get the quality inspection department to release the report as soon as possible and where Monica got her skills from.

It made those directors subconsciously start thinking about how to help Cardellini Enterprise.

One had to know that most of the board members would not participate in the company’s operation, and they were only there to receive the dividends.

Now, he was forced by Monica to use his personal connections.

“Alright, today’s board meeting is over. Thank you for your hard work!” Monica suddenly bowed.

Just a moment ago, she was scolding the board of directors, yet now, she was being so humble. That damned girl, how could he be so shameless and thick-skinned?

Monica did not keep herself in the conference room for too long and left with Steve.

When she returned to the office, she took a deep breath.

F*ck. She had said too much in one breath and was dying of thirst.

She looked everywhere for water to drink.

“Mr. Burts.” Steve seemed to have noticed what Monica was going and quickly called out to him.

Tim said respectfully, “Mr. Warren.”

“Get Ms. Cardellini a glass of water.”

“Yes.”

Tim brought Monica a glass of cold water, which Monica gulped down.

“Slow down,” Steve could not help but remind her.

Monica’s every move was like a child’s. However, that childishness could intimidate so many crafty old men!

Even Monica’s father had a hard time dealing with those people, yet Monica scolded everyone into submission today.

Monica finished her drink and burped.

Then, she looked at Steve and asked, “Did I lose my image just now?”

Steve could not help but laugh.

Was it not a little too late to be concerned about her image?

Monica looked at Steve’s expression and knew that she was indeed too impulsive just now.

No leader was like her. If word got out, it would probably be extremely embarrassing.

Steve said, “No, I think you’re very outstanding.”

Monica’s eyes widened.

She was pleasantly surprised by Steve’s sudden evaluation of her.

Steve was her father’s assistant, and her father often mentioned and admired Steve. Hence, she did not expect that she would be able to get Steve’s approval on her first day in the company.

“You should treat different people differently. The business world isn’t as great as you think. When driven by profit, as long as you can achieve your goal, any method is the best. You don’t have to care about your image.”

Steve consoled Monica.

She said, “I was very angry just now when those group of people blamed my dad for every time something happened, but what made me even angrier was that they could just stand by and do nothing. The Cardellini Enterprise belongs to everyone and not my dad alone. What right do they have to be so self-righteous?”

Steve did not even remind Monica that the existence of the board of directors was only to make decisions for the company’s big projects. The individual members of the board of directors did not need to work in the company, nor did they have the responsibility to personally deal with the company’s affairs. However, it was undeniable that she was right. At this critical moment, any method was right.
