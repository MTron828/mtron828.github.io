Chapter 481: Announcing to Everyone That George Is Edward’s Son!

Jeanne’s expression was really grim.

She looked at Jasmine coldly and asked her, “You keep saying I can’t give birth to children of the Swans! Where did you get the confidence to think that only you can give them a child?”

“I-I-I… I heard Aunt saying that something was wrong with Fourth Uncle’s body.”

“Have you used his body before to say something is wrong with him?” Jeanne was infuriated.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She did not need them to tell her what her husband could and could not do!

“Don’t insult me,” Edward said.

At that, Jasmine became embarrassed.

Eden, on the other hand, was extremely angry. “Jeanne, what nonsense are you spouting?”

“Since none of you have used his body before, what right do you have to say that Edward can’t do it?”

“It is because no one has used it before that we’re certain that Edward has a problem.” After a long time, Elaine finally could not hold it in anymore. “Don’t think I don’t know that the br*t, Nox, has been fooling around with women since he was in his teens. Since you have such a good relationship with him, how can you not have fooled around with girls when he’s so good at it? If it’s not because there’s something wrong with you, what is it?”

“So, in your opinion, fooling around with women is a glorious thing?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

At that moment, Nox, who was still sleeping soundly, turned around and felt that his ears were a little hot today.

“Fooling around with women isn’t a glorious thing, but not having been in a relationship is just abnormal! Don’t talk to me about abstinence! The real reason a man is abstinent is either because he doesn’t have the looks, he doesn’t have a woman, or he simply can’t do it! With Edward’s looks and ability, women would flock to him like flies, but he was never in any relationship. In that case, there must be something wrong with his body!” Elaine was certain.

“Am I not a woman?”

“Right now, I seriously suspect that this is just a marriage of convenience and that you’re both benefiting from each other. While you help Edward cover up the problem with his body, he’ll help you get what you want! On second thought, the fact that Edward gave you all his shares… Is this a deal between the two of you? Otherwise, why can I not figure out why Edward gave all his shares to you?”

“I’m telling you now that there’s nothing wrong with Edward’s body!”

“Of course, you’d claim that there is nothing wrong with him. Would I find a woman to test Edward out? I’m not that perverted!” Elaine was extremely sarcastic.

“Edward has a son!” Jeanne was pissed off at Elaine.

She was so furious that she looked as if her people were being bullied and she wanted to beat the opposite party to death.

Edward looked at Jeanne and at Jeanne’s current state. Suddenly, he smiled.

It turned out he had a son!

At that moment, the smile on his face widened!

“Where?” Elaine paused for a moment.

Jeanne’s aggressive reaction surprised her for a second. She did not expect the woman to be so fierce when she was angry. Hence, after pausing for a few seconds, she asked Jeanne fiercely.

At that, Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Damn it!

An anxious person could really say anything.

Now, Kingsley might kill her for revealing that.

“Where’s the child?” Elaine pressed, snarking.

Jeanne stared at Elaine.

For a second, Elaine felt that Jeanne was going to hit her.

She hissed, and at that moment, she was prepared to retaliate if Jeanne made a move.

She wanted to see which side her father would stand on!

“What? You can’t say it?” Elaine was still trying to aggravate Jeanne. “You can lie about anything, but how dare you boast shamelessly that you have a son! Now, make magic happen and show us your son. If you can make that happen, I will be certain that you didn’t do anything to cause Jasmine’s miscarriage. From the bottom of my heart, I will be certain that it has nothing to do with you!”

Jeanne clenched her fists tightly.

“But if you can’t show us your son, you’ll have to accept the fact! You will be punished as you deserve, and you will get the hell out of the Swans!” Elaine was forcing Jeanne’s hand and not letting her go.

She simply did not believe that Jeanne could show them her son!

“Or are you also pregnant?” Elaine looked at Jeanne’s expression and became even more sarcastic. “If you are really pregnant, I will immediately call the family doctor over to verify it!”

“I’m not pregnant,” Jeanne said immediately.

“Ha!” Elaine scoffed and wanted to add fuel to the fire again.

“Edward’s son is already six years old!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

Elaine was stunned.

“George,” Jeanne said clearly, “is Edward’s son.”

The entire hall fell silent, and everyone could not believe what they just heard.

They all looked at Jeanne and her unusually calm demeanor. It was as if she suddenly felt relieved about being conflicted for a long time.

She looked up and said again, “Edward and I conceived George seven years ago!”
