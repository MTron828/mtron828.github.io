1138 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

She just kept looking at him. However, he did not even look at her.

What was she still hoping for?

She sat there for about ten minutes. After a full ten minutes, she said, “Finn, let’s break up.”

It did not take her half a year to initiate the breakup.

In fact, they had never dated either, but she still wanted to officially tell Finn that she had given up on him.

She did not have her cousin’s strong willpower, so she could not wait silently and selflessly for a man who would never give her a response.

She really admired her cousin.

How did Monica endure it for so many years? The two of them had been in a relationship for so many years.

“Okay.” Finn’s face was devoid of any emotion as he responded.

Actually, they should have ‘broken up’ long ago. Their relationship should have ended with Michael’s downfall.

The reason why he did not bring it up was that, in his mind, he and Sarah had never even started, so it could not be considered a breakup.

However, since Sarah was so serious at the moment, he could also give her an affirmative answer.

It was a simple ‘okay’, but it still made Sarah burst into tears.

Did that mean everything she had done was nothing to Finn?

She said, “You’ve never had feelings for me, have you? For a moment, not even a little bite?”

She continued asking as she still did not want to give up.

“Yeah,” Finn replied.

He even nodded.

Sarah laughed, and as she laughed, her tears streamed down her face.

“Finn, have you ever had feelings for anyone?” Sarah asked.

Finn did not answer.

“I used to think that you loved my cousin. I would see you do a lot of small things for her. My cousin was so boisterous and carefree that I thought you tolerated her. However, I’m now questioning my previous thoughts. I always thought that I could do what my cousin could do. But can’t do it now not because I’m not as good as my cousin, but because my cousin has not done it either.”

At that moment, Finn finally shifted his gaze from the computer screen in front of him to her.

Sarah felt terrible. “You’re finally willing to turn around and look at me.”

“Sarah, you should know very well that I have no feelings for you.” Finn was as cold-blooded as ever.

“Have you ever had feelings for my cousin?”

“That’s not your concern.”

“In everyone’s eyes, you don’t have feelings for her.” Sarah said word by word, “If you do, I can only say that you’ve failed. You’ve failed so badly that my cousin didn’t even realize it. If you don’t have feelings for her… Finn, I really admire you for being so cold-blooded and heartless! Can you teach me how you seal up your heart like this?”

Finn still remained emotionless despite seeing how agitated Sarah was.

He said, “My feelings are my own business. I don’t need to explain it to anyone.”

Sarah still wanted to say something, but Finn immediately interrupted her, “I’m very busy right now, and I have work to do. Please don’t waste my time.”

Sarah laughed coldly.

She said, “Serves us right for being hurt so badly! Finn, your feelings can’t even be compared to an animal’s. We were really blind to have fallen for you. I hope you will be alone for the rest of your life, until the moment you die!”

After that, she rushed out of Finn’s office in despair.

It was true.

She would not like Finn; she did not want to like a cold-blooded man like him anymore. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She had had enough!

Finn just stared at Sarah’s back as she left.

That was right. He would spend the rest of his life alone. In this life, he would be alone until the moment of his death!

…

When Sarah returned to the ward, her eyes were red. However, she was trying hard to control herself.

At that moment, Monica was also in the ward but was working on the laptop.

Sarah did not know when it started, but whenever Monica came to the ward, she would bring a briefcase with her and deal with a lot of work matters at any time.

Monica had been busy the entire day.

Sarah did not know why her cousin had changed so much.

However, she felt that as long as Monica did not have feelings for Finn, anything was fine.
