Chapter 382: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

??Yet now, he was shocked.

Finn had truly shocked him.

How could Finn fight like that despite his serious injuries?

He even wanted to use Finn’s inaction to make Monica give up on Finn completely.

Even though Monica and Finn’s relationship had always been bad, he had a feeling that Monica liked Finn. In fact, he already knew the first time he saw Monica appear on the city’s big screen to wish Finn a happy birthday that Monica loved Finn very much. Otherwise, she would not be smiling so happily.

He clenched his fists tightly.

At that point, he did not need to probe any further.

To Finn, Monica was clearly more important than his own life.

If he really was an orphan of the Duncans, he would not sacrifice his life just for a woman. In fact, he would not sacrifice his only chance to take back his empire for a woman.

“Mr. Ross.” The person beside him said respectfully, “Do you need me to pass them a note?”

He meant that it was impossible for Finn to be an orphan of the Duncans.

“Wait a little longer,” Michael said.

The person beside him was surprised.

......

In fact, it was already very obvious, so what was Mr. Ross waiting for?

“Let’s see if Finn still has a plot,” Michael said coldly.

With that, the person beside him had no choice but to obey.

However, at that moment, he still could not understand something.

Mr. Ross had always been mature and steady, which made him different from those his age. However, why was he suddenly like that? It was obvious that he had emotions.

He had always thought that Mr. Ross could be indifferent in the face of huge issues, that he would never waste time, and that he would complete his tasks quickly and ruthlessly.

Mr. Ross was clearly different from his usual self today.

In the warehouse, the sounds of fighting echoed continuously.

It was the first time the bearded man had encountered such an opponent.

He did not really care about it at first, but later on, he realized he had to. Surprisingly, he was starting to struggle!

He looked at Finn in disbelief, wondering if the man was a dead body controlled by someone — the kind that the person was dead but its body was being controlled.

“F*ck!” The bearded man spat out a mouthful of blood. He could not believe the man had beaten him to such a state.

The expression on his face was extremely cruel.

“All of you together!” the man suddenly ordered.

The two men, who were standing by, immediately threw themselves at Finn.

Finn moved to the side to dodge it, but as he dodged one side, the other man’s kick came flying over from the other side.

Despite that, he did not fall.

He knew very well that now, with the three people going against him together, was the best time for Monica to escape.

The longer he held on, the longer she had to escape, and the safer she would be.

Hence, at that moment, he turned around and started fighting with the three of them in a frenzy.

Monica was on the ground, shocked by Finn’s appearance.

She thought, ‘Could he die from that? Would he…’

Her body tensed up.

At that moment, she saw Finn. Even as he was dealing with the three of them, he was gesturing for her to leave.

No. How could she leave just like that?

If she left, would Finn die?

However, Finn kept gesturing for her to leave and kept urging her to leave.

Monica was really fed up with Finn. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

How could a man, who she hated to the bone, hurt her so much?

However, how could he make her feel reluctant to part with him when she really wanted to distance herself from him? How could he make her feel so much pain?

She got up from the ground.

From the beginning, she had never been able to refuse Finn.

From the beginning, when she pursued him to after they got together, she seemed to have been following his arrangements. She would do whatever he said.

When he told her not to disturb him during work hours, she would not call or text him. She would obediently wait for him in the car until dawn. She did not even dare to send him a message asking when he would be off work.

Her vision was blurry.

Why should she sacrifice her life to save Finn, who had treated her so badly?

Why should she sacrifice her life to save Finn, Finn, who clearly did not love her?

With that, she ran out of the warehouse while the sounds of fighting were still coming from behind her.

However, she zoned out those sounds. At that moment, all she could think about was Finn gesturing for her to leave.
