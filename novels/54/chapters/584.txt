Chapter 585: Monica and Finn’s Relationship Ended A Long Time Ago!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Aren’t you trying to deal with grandpa–”

“Shut up!” Alexander raised his voice.

“I’ve locked the office door, and no one else is here. I agree that Grandpa is too good to Jeanne and putting all his attention on Jeanne. If this continues, everything that belongs to the Lawrences will go to Jeanne!” Joshua was agitated.

Alexander’s expression was also grim.

At the thought of Jonathan siding with Jeanne after so many years, he could not take it standing.

“I think giving grandpa what he deserves and making him regret putting Jeanne in such an important position is going too easy on him. We should also take this opportunity to kick Jeanne out of the Lawrences,” Joshua suggested.

Alexander looked at Joshua.

“This is what I wanted to tell you.” Joshua looked very sincere as if he was doing it for the good of the family.

Alexander could not help but size up Joshua.

Joshua was a person who did not care about anything, so Alexander was a little surprised that he could think of so many things today.

In fact, it was not Joshua who thought of it but Eden.

Eden took the initiative to call him today and ask how Jeanne was doing at Lawrence Enterprise.

Actually, he did not plan to stay in touch with Eden anymore.

Firstly, it was because Eden and his sister had fallen out, so Eden was not one of them anymore.

Secondly, it was because Eden was not as powerful as he thought. Jeanne still managed to plot against Eden to kick him out of Swan Enterprise, so he did not want to waste time helping Eden.

However, Eden had called him today and said a lot of nice things to Joshua. He was even good to Joshua. On the phone, he explained that he was not actually kicked out of Swan Enterprise. He was just given a trial period. After the trial period was over, he could still return to Swan Enterprise.

He said a lot of similar things, which Joshua half-believed and half-doubted. However, Joshua accepted it in the end.

Then, when talking about Jeanne, Joshua accidentally spilled the beans and told Eden that his father wanted to target his grandfather…

Eden immediately thought of a way for him to get the best of both worlds.

After that, he quickly came to report to Alexander.

However, Eden specifically told him not to tell Alexander that it was his idea so that Joshua could take the credit. Of course, Joshua was happy to do it.

Hence, without mentioning Eden, Joshua told Alexander his plan on scheming against Jeanne.

Alexander was more than satisfied.

He said, “Joshua, as long as you work a little harder, you won’t be so mediocre.”

“Dad, I was young and insensible back then. Moreover, you and grandpa were always protecting me. But now, I finally understand what’s going on with grandpa. Only when you’re strong can you stand on your own feet. From now on, I’ll definitely work hard and learn.”

“It’s good that you know.” It was rare for Alexander to be in such a good mood.

Having received his father’s approval, Joshua was secretly delighted. “Dad, regarding grandpa’s matter, when do you plan to make a move?”

“One of these days.” Alexander’s eyes narrowed.

Otherwise, the longer it took, the more trouble there would be.

“I’ll wait and see.” Joshua was very excited.

He could not wait to see what would happen to his grandfather and how much of a sorry state Jeanne would end up in!

…

Jeanne returned to her office.

After deligating some tasks, Jeanne drank a cup of coffee and prepared to move on to her next task.

Just then, the phone rang. She took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up.

“I have gotten someone to hack into the Lawrences’ surveillance system and sent someone over to repair it. The surveillance cameras in the Lawrence family’s manor will be fixed today,” Kingsley said straightforwardly.

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

“Don’t you plan on stopping it or something?” Kinglsey asked.

“What are you trying to say?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“I’m afraid you’ll regret it.”

“If you didn’t lie to me, I won’t,” Jeanne said slowly.

“I’ve never seen you kill anyone. I’m afraid you won’t be able to take it mentally.”

“No, I’ve already killed someone. There’s nothing I can’t accept if I’ve killed your people on the island.” Jeanne was unmoved. The corner of her mouth even tugged into a sneer. “If you want to talk about regret... I’ll only regret not killing the Lawrences myself.”

“You’d better not be rash. Harken is a country ruled by law.”

“Don’t worry. I’m not that ignorant.”

“Jeannie.” Kingsley sounded a little emotional.

Jeanne’s gaze, which was staring at the computer, shifted.

“Finish off the Lawrences as soon as possible.” Kingsley’s clear and indifferent voice sounded. “There will be many more things to come.”

Jeanne bit her lips lightly.

“You know what I’m talking about,” Kingsley said.

After that, the call ended.

‘Know? Know what?’

She was still working for someone!

…

In the Sanders’ administration office, the quiet hall was filled with 500 people.

When Monica went, a special staff member came up to receive her.

“Ms. Cardellini, this way, please. Mr. Ross has specially reserved the best seat for you.”

She was just here to go through the motions.

Nevertheless, the staff member guided her to the middle seat in the second row.

The judges were in the first row, whereas the audience was seated in the second row and onward.

Monica sat in her seat. She came a little late, so the show started not long after she arrived.

There were three people who gave a speech.

Michael was the last one, and after his passionate speech ended, there was a long round of applause.

Monica also felt that Michael was born to be in the spotlight, with a natural demeanor of a king.

At that, she felt that her efforts were not in vain.

To her, to be able to help someone live a better life, she felt that it added some kind of value to her life.

Michael bowed. The moment everyone thought he would step down from the stage since the voting had ended, he suddenly opened his mouth and said, “This last sentence is not to get votes. After all, the voting process has already ended. I just want to express some of my feelings and some gratitude to someone important to me. Thank you... Monica.”

With a bam, a spotlight suddenly land on Monica, and she became a little nervous.

“Thank you for waiting for me for so many years! Thank you for supporting my work! Thank you for letting me find my true self! Thank you... for returning to my side.” Michael confessed. “Monica, without you, I wouldn’t be the man I am today!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Monica was a little dumbfounded as she did expect Michael to do such a thing. She even felt repulsed.

However, she pursed her lips and forced herself to smile sweetly.

“Marry her!” In the audience, someone suddenly shouted.

The next second, many people echoed the same thing.

Michael quickly stopped the audience. “Everyone, be quiet.”

The audience immediately fell silent.

“Don’t scare her.” It sounded full of love.

The audience even cheered for them.

Michael handed the microphone to the staff, went down the stage, and walked directly to Monica.

The entire time, the lights and cameras were tracking him.

Then, he walked in front of Monica and pulled her into his arms.

The audience applauded non-stop.

However, Monica’s body stiffened.

She did not know if it was necessary to do this.

She thought letting everyone know they were together was enough. There was no need to... show them more!
