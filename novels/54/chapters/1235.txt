1236 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise

Dates usually would not end too early. However, after walking in the living room for a few minutes, she suddenly saw Edward.

Jeanne took a look at the time in the living room. It was only 8 p.m. Although she was surprised, she did not ask further.

She watched as Edward walked past her and prepared to head upstairs.

“Edward.”

Edward stopped in his tracks.

“I want to meet Susan,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward’s eyes flickered, and he turned back to look at her.

“I don’t have any ill intentions. I just want to have a few words with her.” Jeanne said, “If it’s not okay, forget it.”

“Susan will be here to see my dad tomorrow.”

Did it mean that they were already meeting each other’s parents?

“I’ll bring her over,” Edward said.

“Thank you.”

Edward nodded before he went straight upstairs.

Jeanne, on the other hand, did not spare him another glance and continued to walk slowly around the living room.

At 9 p.m., she returned to her room, and when she pushed open the door, she saw Edward in her room. He seemed to have just taken a shower and was wearing a bathrobe.

The moment she saw Edward, Jeanne instinctively thought that she had entered the wrong room and was about to leave.

“From tonight onwards, we’ll be living together.”

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

“Finn said it’s not safe for you to wake up at night,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne really did not want to have any more conflicts with Edward in the near future. However, she had to admit that she could not take it anymore.

She said, “Edward, do you have to do this?”

“I do.” Edward was certain, and his tone was even a little cold.

“Did I offend you today?” Jeanne asked him.

She was trying hard to control her emotions.

“No.”

“You’re taking revenge on me because I didn’t let you kiss me.”

“I told you. Finn said it’s not safe for you to get up at night.”

“It’s impossible you don’t know that Finn is trying to matchmake us. He can tell at a glance that there’s a conflict between us!” Jeanne said.

“I’m just concerned about the baby.”

“Edward!”

“Wash up early.” Edward did not seem to want to say anything more to Jeanne.

However, Jeanne just stared at him. She watched as he lifted the blanket and climbed into her bed.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly.

At that moment, she turned around and left. She did not want to argue with him, so if he wanted to sleep in that room, she would sleep in another room.

“Jeanne,” Edward called out to her.

Jeanne ignored him.

“Don’t you know what’s best for us?”

Jeanne endured it.

“I won’t make any fuss or express any emotions.” Edward asked, “So, what are you still so against?”

Jeanne bit her lip.

Right. What was she still so against? It would just be three months — No, it would be less than three months, so what else could she be against?

The only thing she could do now was to give birth to her daughter. Then, Edward would raise George and their daughter.

A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. Sometimes, it really seemed like she could only face everything with a smile. After all, there was no way for her to resist.

With that, she turned around and walked into the room.

In the end, she compromised.

Edward looked at Jeanne as she walked into the room, took out a set of pajamas from the closet, and went to the bathroom.

She would no longer have a temper or resist him.

In fact, it was true. To Jeanne, there was no way she could resist. No matter what she had to endure, she could only compromise. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

However, he hoped that she would be able to have some emotions. Even a little bit of emotion would be good.

Even if she saw him and Susan together, it would be good if she could show a little emotion, unlike now, where she accepted everything, including his relationship with another woman!
