1035 The Honey Trap

After that, Monica quickly returned to the room.

She brought a cup of warm water and went to the bed to help the sleepy Harry up. “Harry, take a hangover pill.”

“Okay, okay…” Harry’s body was limp, and at that moment, he did whatever Monica said.

Monica put the pill into Harry’s mouth and made him drink some water to make sure he swallowed it.

She helped Harry off the bed. “Harry, you should go take a shower. You really stink.”

“I don’t even have the strength…”

“If you don’t take a shower, I’m leaving.”

“Alright, alright, alright. I’ll take a shower now. Wait for me!” Tonight, Harry was completely smitten by Monica.

Monica quickly nodded. “I’ll be a good girl and wait for you here.”

Harry staggered to the bathroom.

Then, Monica quickly turned around and walked out of the room to let the bargirl in. “Turn the light in the room to the lowest setting and don’t speak. Just call him Harry throughout, and when you’re done, come out. I’ll be waiting for you in the room next door.”

As she spoke, Monica told Steve to take out a stack of money. “I’ll give you the other half after you’re done.”

The moment the bargirl saw the money, her eyes lit up.

“Don’t worry, I know what to do. I’ll definitely act well for you.”

Monica nodded.

With that, the bargirl walked into the room, while Monica and Steve went to the room that Steve had booked next door.

However, it was still a little awkward for the two of them to be in the same room.

Monica said, “Why don’t you go back first?”

“I don’t feel safe leaving you here alone,” Steve said.

Monica did not insist that he leave either. Instead, she said, “In that case, I’ll go take a shower.”

She smelled too much of alcohol and smoke that it was making her sick.

“I’ll wait for you outside.”

Monica watched as Steve left the room with a faint smile on her lips.

In fact, there were still many people in the company who were sincere with her.

Of course, it was not because she was charming, but because her father was a good leader and a very good man.

That was why so many people were willing to help her and accept her.

That was why the Cardellini Enterprise could persevere under such circumstances.

The moment she entered the bathroom, the discomfort in her stomach that she had been holding in for a long time finally burst out.

How much did she drink?

She drank quite a bit, but even though her alcohol tolerance was good, she could not take such a reckless way of drinking.

She vomited for some time before she started feeling a little better. Then, she took a shower, changed into a bathrobe, and walked out of the bathroom.

When she opened the door, Steve was waiting for her outside.

Seeing that she was only wearing a bathrobe, he became awkward.

“You should go back. When you come, help me buy a set of clothes at the mall. I’m a size small,” Monica instructed.

She felt that if she did not give Steve something to do, he might guard the door the entire night.

“But–”

“Don’t worry. I can protect myself.”

Steve hesitated for a while before agreeing.

Monica watched as Steve left, and while she was closing the door, she saw Nox again.

Nox and a girl were hugging each other. It did not take much to guess that they were here to get a room.

Nox also saw Monica standing at the door.

“Are you done?” Nox asked.

Monica ignored Nox and closed the door.

The moment she closed the door, she heard Nox’s disdainful voice. “Your dad is about to wake up, and he’s going to beat you to death!”

She really hoped that her father would wake up and beat her to death.

…

It was 5 a.m. in the morning when the bargirl knocked on Monica’s door.

At that time, Monica had just fallen asleep.

In fact, she did not sleep much the entire night. Being drunk would make one’s world spin, so she sat there for the whole night and eventually fell asleep.

Now, she was being woken up again.

She quickly opened the door.

“It’s done,” the bargirl said.

Monica looked at the time. “For so long?!”

“I don’t know how long it’s been since that old pervert touched a woman. He hugged me and kept…” the bargirl explained in detail.

Monica’s face and ears turned red.

“Thank you.” Monica gave her the money that she had prepared in advance. “Don’t tell another soul about what happened tonight.”

“Don’t worry. We have our own rules in this industry, and we won’t offend our customers.”

Monica nodded.

The bargirl took the money and left happily.

Monica took a deep breath and moved from that room to the other, where Harry was sleeping like a pig on the bed.

Of course, Monica would not take the initiative to go to his bed. Instead, she sat on the sofa in the room and waited for Harry to wake up.

She waited for a long time, but she did not dare to close her eyes in that room.

Only at 10 a.m. in the morning did Harry sit up from the bed. At that moment, he even touched the space beside him and saw that Monica was already sitting on the sofa. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Why did you get up on your own?” As soon as Harry saw Monica, he smiled lewdly. “Didn’t I tire you out last night?”

Monica smiled.

She was not tired, but the wait was a little too long.

She said, “President Chance, I’m Monica.”

Harry’s wide smile instantly froze.

“It’s no wonder that you didn’t recognize me. After all, I never used to work at Cardellini Enterprise and had never interacted with you. But last night, you said that if I keep you company, you’ll promise me one thing.”

“Want me to purchase your company’s drugs? Don’t even think about it!” Harry refused outright.

He was really an old and sly fox. He could really turn against someone he knew.

“I can distribute the goods to you for free, President Chance. You’ll just have to settle payment once a month for three months, and I’ll give you a 20 percent discount on the price.” Monica offered him a discount.

“I don’t need it!” Harry said coldly.

At that moment, he had already started to look for his clothes to change into. It was as if he did not want to waste his breath on Monica.

“It’s such a huge discount. President Chance, are you really not going to consider it?”

“There’s no need to consider. We’re working very well with Sunny Pharmaceutical, and we don’t need Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs.” Harry was merciless.

“In that case…” Monica said, “I can only call the police.”

Harry’s expression changed, and he glared at Monica.

“Last night, I was looking for you to discuss the sales of Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs. However, you took me to the hotel and forced me to have sex with you. I wonder how many years the sentence for rape in Harken will be? Three years? Five years?” Monica sneered. “President Chance, you’re a highly respected person now. If this scandal is exposed, how will you establish yourself in South Hampton City in the future?”

Harry was so angry that his veins were bulging.

He probably never thought that he would be schemed against by a little girl after being in society for so many years!
