1281 Edward Attends a Charity Banquet

If she did not like him, why did she have to be with Dr. Jones for three years?

How many of these three years could she waste time and time again in her life?

“Monica, you’re hesitating!” Nox was a little excited when he did not get Monica’s answer.

Monica snapped back to her senses. “I just don’t want to discuss relationships matters with you.”

“I’m a love expert. If you don’t discuss it with me, who would you do that with?!”

Monica could not help but laugh.

She actually looked a little pretty when she smiled.

Nox had to admit that Monica was beautiful now.

It had been a really long time since he had discovered Monica’s outstanding qualities. He did not know if she had really cultivated her temperament over the years, but he felt that wherever she went, she would easily attract attention.

Of course, he did not have any lewd thoughts about Monica at all. He only had platonic feelings!

“Monica, you’re actually mocking me! F*ck, I’ve seen countless women. I know everything about men and women like the back of my hand.”

“The sex thing?”

“Can you not be so tacky…”

Nox was excited.

At that moment, Monica, who was in front of him, suddenly gave him a look.

Nox usually looked sloppy, but in fact, he was very wise and smart.

All she needed was to give him a look and Nox immediately understood.

He turned.

He turned around and saw the star of the banquet, Candice Nicholson, suddenly appear behind him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When Candice entered the venue just now, he was right next to her and saw her face clearly. However, he did not take the initiative to socialize. After all, he did not like to join in the fun when there were many people.

When the crowd saw Candice walking over on her own, they were still a little surprised.

However, he also maintained his composure.

“Young Master Winter, Ms. Cardellini.” Candice spoke first in a friendly manner. “I’m Candice Nicholson. It’s my honor to meet you.”

“Hello.” Nox quickly extended his hand.

Candice returned the handshake.

She shifted her gaze to Monica and extended her hand. “Thank you very much for attending my charity banquet.”

Monica was stunned for a moment before she stretched out her hand as well.

It was indeed her imagination.

Initially, when she did not get a clear look at Candice, she felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity. Now that they were face to face, this sense of familiarity suddenly disappeared.

She was sure that this was the first time she had seen the woman in front of her.

It was similar to the description in the media.

There was a heroic spirit in her beauty.

It was the kind of innate pride that many women lacked now. There was also a clean temperament that was untainted by the secular world.

Was it because of an accident that she had almost never come into contact with the outside world that she had such a unique feeling?!

Monica smiled without batting an eyelid and said courteously, “Seeing is believing. Ms. Nicholson is more beautiful than I’ve imagined.”

Candice smiled. “Likewise, Ms. Cardellini.”

“Hm?” Monica was still smiling.

“I’ve read many of your reports. Almost all of them were evaluating your business management ability. Very few people have mentioned your appearance and naturally assumed that your physical appearance was not good. Of course, I’ve seen your photos in the media. I personally thought that it had been refined and beautified. Now that I’ve seen you in person, I realize that I got it wrong.” Candice’s words were sincere.

It was much more comfortable than the many compliments Monica had heard.

“Thank you for the compliment.” She was not too excited about it though.

After all, only accept compliments on such occasions with a grain of salt.

She was just a little surprised.

After all, Candice had just come into contact with the outside world, but she seemed to be at a normal business meeting. She was calm, smooth, and at ease. It was impossible to tell that she was a rookie.

Therefore, sometimes, the media reports could not be completely believed.

Since she wanted to enter the business world, she should not be a simple person.

The three of them stood together and chatted for a while.

Monica was actually flattered that Candice had taken the initiative to talk to her and Nox.

In the business world, she and Nox could indeed support most of Harken, but in the end, Minister Nicholson’s status was definitely more noble. After all, he was in charge of the Harken Royal Force, so he was second only to one person.

In Harken, there had never been a rule where politicians took the initiative to curry favor with businessmen.

‘That went without saying.’

Monica suddenly thought of something.

The leader of Harken, Edward, could be considered to have a close relationship with them.
