Chapter 1650: Nox’s Heartfelt Confession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He just really wanted to… Nox could feel his body reacting more intensely, but he did not know what to do next. He was a little at a loss.

Suddenly, Shelly opened her mouth, and Nox froze. He then felt Shelly stick out her tongue…

Nox could hear a buzzing sound in his head as if it was about to explode, and his mind went blank. Just as he was about to go deeper…

“Benjamin…”

It felt as though a bucket of cold water had dampened his burning desires, leaving his body and mind cold.

He left Shelly’s lips and went back to bed to sleep. All the physical reactions just now were a f*cking humiliation!

The next day, Shelly opened her eyes and looked at the time on her phone. It was just 7 a.m., so she got up from the sofa, her back aching. As expected, sleeping on the sofa was torture.

She rubbed her body and washed up before leaving the ward. Seeing that Nox was still asleep, she walked out of the ward without disturbing him and went to buy breakfast.

When she returned, it was 7:30 a.m., and Nox had woken up. He was sitting on the hospital bed without saying a word. He did not fly into a rage because she was not in the ward, nor did he call her to urge her to come back.

His quiet demeanor made Shelly feel a little flattered, but that would not change her bad impression of him. What Nox did or did not do depended on his mood, and it had nothing to do with anything else.

She took out the breakfast. “I bought some pastries and oats for you. Do you want some?”

Nox looked at Shelly’s indifferent attitude toward him.

After a long time, he replied, “Mm.”

Shelly placed a bowl of oats and two croissants on the simple dining table on Nox’s bed. “Here you go.”

She handed him the spoon, but Nox simply looked at her and did not take it.

Seeing that, Shelly pursed her lips and picked up the croissant before placing it beside Nox’s mouth. She was planning to feed him.

Nox looked at the croissant and then at Shelly before opening his mouth and taking a bite. The croissant was not big but not small either. Hence, when Nox took a bite, his cheeks puffed up, which made him look a little comical.

“Would you like some oats?” Shelly asked.

Nox nodded, probably because he was choking.

With that, Shelly fed him a mouthful of porridge, and he swallowed it with much difficulty. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t take such a big bite,” Shelly reminded him.

“Are you concerned about me?” Nox suddenly asked.

Shelly was stunned by his question, but no, she was not concerned about him. She was just afraid that if he died from choking, she would not be able to escape responsibility. However, she did not want to say it because Nox would lose his temper if she said that.

“Do you care about me?” Nox asked again.

Shelly chose to remain silent, and Nox was visibly a little disappointed. Somehow, she felt that Nox was a little different today. Perhaps he was not yet fully awake, but she found his attacks much weaker.

“Shelly, let’s start over,” Nox suddenly said after mustering up a lot of courage.

Even though he looked calm and collected, he did not sleep for almost the entire night last night. He admitted that hearing Shelly call out another man’s name when he kissed her last night had upset him.

As for his sudden confession today, it was because he felt that he would never be able to accept Shelly being with another man. Since he cared so much about her being with another man, it was better for him to be honest with her.

Therefore, the first thing he wanted to do when he woke up was to confess to Shelly, but he did not expect Shelly to be gone when he opened his eyes. The moment he thought she had left, he saw her return, and now that she was back, he could not hold it in anymore.

However, Shelly did not seem to understand his confession as she did not react to it at all. She was even feeding him porridge.

Nox frowned angrily but tried his best to suppress his emotions. He said, “Shelly, I’m not joking with you. I said, let’s get back together and start over again!”

His voice was a little loud.

Shelly looked at Nox and said, “What do you want from me?”

“I said, let’s get back together and start over again!” Nox repeated it again.

“Why are we getting back together again?” Shelly asked.

She did not know what was wrong with Nox. She was even wondering what Nox meant by ‘getting back together”!

Nox was exasperated. “F*ck, Shelly!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he held the back of Shelly’s head and kissed her hard on the lips.

Shelly was stunned. For a second, she failed to comprehend what was happening..
