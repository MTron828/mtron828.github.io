Chapter 98: The Annoying Fourth Master Swan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the CEO’s office of Lawrence Enterprise.

“What kind of scheme is this!” Jeanne kept quiet as Alexander said, “I’ve already married my daughter to him. Why can’t he provide our family some support?”

“I’m just worried that Brother-in-law will refuse. It won’t be good if it affects our relationship.” Joshua hurriedly explained.

“That will depend on Jasmine,” Jeanne said.

She pushed the responsibility onto Jasmine.

If Jasmine played her role well, then great. Otherwise, she would be deemed useless.

“Why did you drag Jasmine into…”

“That’s enough.” Alexander interrupted Joshua and said. “I know how to resolve this matter.”

“General Manager, regarding the matter with Swanhaven Bank, I hope that our plans won’t be made known in advance. If Eden Swan learns of our plans, he would come up with excuses to reject us. It’s not that I doubt Eden’s character, but we must remain wary.”

“Of course. I’m not that stupid,” Alexander said disdainfully.

“I’m not doubting you, Dad. I’m just afraid…” Jeanne glanced at Joshua.

Joshua’s expression immediately changed. “What do you mean? Do you think I’ll report this?!”

“I didn’t say anything.” Jeanne shrugged and smiled.

Joshua was furious.

Alexander snapped at Joshua, “Joshua Lawrence, you’d better behave yourself. If you tell anyone about this, I’ll break your legs and make sure you never step foot into the Lawrence Enterprise again!”

Joshua could only grit his teeth and nod.

“That’s all. You’re dismissed,” Alexander ordered.

“Understood.”

Jeanne and Joshua walked out of Alexander’s office.

The two of them entered the elevator.

“What Dad just said was not a joke,” Jeanne reminded as she pressed the button.

Joshua glared at her. “What do you mean?”

“I’m afraid you didn’t understand, so I’ll repeat myself.” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly. “Don’t leak the plan. We’re the only people who know that we’ll get Swanhaven Bank to give us an interest-free loan. Dad and I definitely won’t tell anyone else. You’re the only one.”

“Jeanne Lawrence!” Joshua was furious.

“You’ll regret it if you were kicked out of the Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Are you mocking me on purpose?”

“Think what you will.” Jeanne smiled at Joshua.

The elevator arrived and Jeanne walked out first.

Joshua punched the elevator door angrily.

He really wanted to strangle Jeanne.

Why didn’t his father beat this woman to death back then?

What right did she have to show off in front of him?

He was the real grandson and only heir of the Lawrences. What right did Jeanne have to flaunt in front of him?

He must kill her! He must!

…

After Jeanne and Joshua left, Alexander also left the office and returned to the Lawrences’ residence.

Alexander reported everything to Jonathan. He was already used to relying on his father for such matters.

Jonathan Lawrence replied without hesitation, “Do as Jeanne says.”

“Does that mean that the Swans will fund the additional 200 million yuan?”

“Isn’t this why we married Jasmine to the Swans?” Jonathan said straightforwardly. “What’s the point if we can’t get any benefits from such a marriage?”

“I’m worried that we might offend the Swans if Eden is unhappy.”

“That’ll depend on Jasmine. If she can please the Swans, they won’t be offended.”

“But it’s a business matter…”

“Your biggest flaw is your lack of courage and decisiveness. Jeanne is so determined, yet you’re still so timid. Alex, you’ve disappointed me.” Jonathan said.

“Alright dad. I’ll do as you say.” Alexander Lawrence did not say anything more.

He was unwilling to admit that he was not capable enough.

“As we’ve seen through this contract negotiation, Jeanne is very capable. Make good use of her and the Lawrence Enterprise will prosper,” Jonathan Lawrence said in a serious tone. “You should’ve learned from the incident with Jeanne’s mother. You have to hold on to Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Don’t worry. In the past, I was negligent towards Jeanne’s mother. I’ve learned from my mistakes. I will never make the same mistake with Jeanne.”

Jonathan nodded but didn’t forget to remind him. “Let Joshua learn from Jeanne in secret.”

“I will.”

Alexander left Jonathan’s room and headed back to his room.

At that moment, Jenifer Fabian was doing yoga in her room. When she saw him, she quickly stood up. “Alex, why are you home so early today?”

“Call Jasmine and ask her and Eden to come over for dinner tonight.”

“Why did you suddenly ask for them to come over?” Jenifer was surprised.

“Don’t ask about anything else. Get the kitchen to prepare more food.”

“Okay.” Jenifer did not ask further.

She hurriedly called Jasmine.

After a while, Jasmine replied that Eden had agreed and that they would come straight after work.

At 6 p.m.

Eden and Jasmine appeared at the Lawrences’s main courtyard.

Jeanne received Alexander’s message and got off work on time.

The moment she returned, she bumped into Eden and Jasmine.

Jasmine pretended to be friendly and called out to Jeanne, “Sister, you’re back?”

“You guys are here too?”

“Mom called me and Eden to come back for dinner. She said Dad missed us,” Jasmine said deliberately.

She was deliberately showing off Alexander’s love for her.

Jeanne smiled.

‘You’ll know what Alexander is thinking soon.’

Jeanne said, “Help yourselves. I’ll head back to my room.”

Then she went upstairs.

Eden looked at Jeanne’s back coldly.

It was not an illusion. Ever since she returned from overseas, Jeanne had never looked him in the eye.

It was the same at this moment.

He gritted his teeth.

‘Don’t think that you can really show off just because you’re doing slightly better than me.’

One day, he would make her regret her actions.

“Eden.”

Eden Swan returned to his senses.

“Why do you keep looking at Jeanne…?” Jasmine Lawrence said anxiously.

“What are you saying?” Eden’s tone was slightly displeased. “If I had any thoughts of her still, would I be marrying you?”

“I just—”

“I can’t stand her disrespecting you.” Eden made up an excuse. “I’m thinking how I should teach her a lesson.”

When Jasmine heard Eden’s words, she immediately broke into a smile. “I knew you definitely wouldn’t like Jeanne. She’s slept with countless men while she was overseas. She’s just a dirty wh*re. That bastard George probably doesn’t even know who she’s been with…”

“Enough.” Eden interrupted her. “Don’t let your father hear you talking about Jeanne like that. It’ll ruin your image.”

“Okay.” Jasmine held Eden’s hand obediently and walked into the main hall.

Eden suddenly felt annoyed by Jasmine’s intimacy.

There was a period of time when he really enjoyed all sorts of admiration and flattery from Jasmine. It gave him a sense of achievement as a man. It wasn’t like back then, when he was still with Jeanne Lawrence, where he was always the one giving in to her. At this moment, he felt a little tired of it all…

He hid his emotions and walked in with Jasmine.

…

Jeanne returned to her room.

George was using the computer in the room. When he saw Jeanne, he quickly closed the screen.

Jeanne Lawrence paid no attention to it.

She said, “Wash your hands and prepare to go downstairs for dinner.”

“Okay.” George climbed off the computer chair and went to the bathroom.

Jeanne looked at George’s small figure and got up to follow him.

As she watched George wash his hands, she said, “Miles is coming to South Hampton.”

“What’s he here for?”

“To be your designated driver.”

“Why?” George looked confused.

“I need to work, so I’ll be busy most of the time. I don’t feel comfortable leaving you alone,” Jeanne said. “The kidnapping by Fourth Master Swan will never happen again.”

“He didn’t kidnap me,” George explained. “I volunteered to go with him.”

Jeanne frowned.

“A few of the older boys bullied me. He saved me. I didn’t tell you that because I didn’t want you to develop a fondness for Fourth Master Swan.” George blushed as he spoke.

“Who bullied you?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

In an instant, the atmosphere changed.

“Fourth Master Swan has already taught them a lesson. Those guys who bullied me before are now my underlings.”

“…”

“Actually, Fourth Master Swan isn’t that annoying,” George said softly.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered slightly.

Once in a while… He wasn’t annoying.

“But that’s if he doesn’t take you away.” George looked at Jeanne and suddenly said angrily, “He told me that you’re his and he’s only lent you to me.”

Jeanne was stunned.

In fact, her heart… skipped a beat.

“So he’s still annoying. Very annoying,” George concluded.

Jeanne smiled.

It was only occasionally that her heart would skip a beat. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But most times, he was still annoying.
