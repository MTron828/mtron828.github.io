Chapter 183: Willing but Unable

“Do you admit defeat?” Fourth Master Swan stared at Jeanne and asked her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she was restricted by Fourth Master Swan’s powerful strength to the point that she was unable to move at all.

She looked at the man in front of her at such a close distance. The force that he unleashed made her unable to withstand it.

Kingsley always reminded her not to provoke Fourth Master Swan.

He said that she could not afford to provoke him.

Although she had always promised Kingsley, she was not truly afraid.

Jeanne had never had close contact with Master Fourth Master Swan. She did not know about the man’s strength!

Nonetheless, at this moment, she believed it.

Jeanne even felt that even after learning martial arts for so many years, where Kingsley had personally taught her all the techniques in martial arts, she was still weak and useless against Fourth Master Swan.

“I admit defeat.” Jeanne surrendered.

As she lived relying on someone else’s charity, she had to learn how to protect herself.

Fourth Master Swan smiled.

He did not make the wrong choice.

He really smiled at Jeanne.

He said, “If you admit defeat, then don’t try to leave my side.”

Jeanne was silent.

“You can’t leave.”

The words were said in a light tone.

Nonetheless, at this moment, it made Jeanne feel that her hair stood on end.

It made her feel that she could not resist Edward no matter what.

She could not escape from him.

The man did not wait for her reply. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It was a king’s aura. As long as he said something, the other party would have to submit!

Edward let go of Jeanne.

At this moment, Jeanne was against the wall.

When Edward stood up straight, Jeanne moved away from the wall.

The two of them stood opposite each other.

At this moment, Jeanne was still panting.

She had used up too much energy to fight Fourth Master Swan and spent a whole day in the detention center, thus her body was somewhat exhausted.

As for Fourth Master Swan, he could still stand in front of her. His aura was powerful and overbearing.

Fourth Master Swan said, moved his thin lips slightly. “Nox.”

“...” Nox was stunned.

Had he been discovered?!

‘Sh*t.’

Nox hurriedly replied, “Fourth Master Swan.”

“Ask Finn where she is,” Master Fourth Master Swan said.

His voice was very flat. There was nothing strange about him at all.

Nox could not help but click his tongue in silence.

‘How much can he endure?

‘He has taken the initiative to call for the doctor, yet he can still act like he’s okay.’

Nox quickly responded, “I’ll make a call.”

“Okay.”

Nox made a call.

To be honest, watching the “married couple” fight was one thing. Most importantly, he was indeed afraid that Fourth Master Swan would collapse.

As such, he had to watch.

Just as the call went through, Finn’s voice could be heard behind Nox.

“You don’t need to call me. I’m here.”

Nox put down his phone. “Inside.”

Finn nodded.

He walked straight into the bedroom.

When he walked in, he saw Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne standing at the corner of the wall.

Nox also walked over at this moment.

When Edward saw Finn arrive, he said to Jeanne, “Go take a shower.”

His tone was very soft.

It was not an order, but at that moment, she could not refuse.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“There are clothes inside the cloakroom. Look for them yourself,” Edward continued.

“Okay,” Jeanne agreed immediately.

This time, she really agreed.

After all, she could not defeat Fourth Master Swan.

If she truly infuriated him, she was afraid that she would lose her life.

After Edward finished, he turned around and left.

The moment he left, Jeanne looked at his back, and her expression changed.

She looked at Fourth Master Swan’s back in disbelief.

His black shirt, which was not considered very thin, was wet.

Jeanne did not think that it was sweat because she saw blood stains on the ground. When Fourth Master Swan left, blood dripped on the ground.

‘Fourth Master Swan is injured?!’

Of course, Jeanne did not think that she had injured him.

Other than kicking him, she kicked him in the back.

She kicked him in his injured back.

Jeanne bit her lip.

There was an indescribable emotion in her heart.

She just watched.

She did not know why Fourth Master Swan was injured so badly!

He was injured, and yet he fought with her.

In fact, after she fought with Fourth Master Swan, she felt that she might not be a match for Nox as well.

Fourth Master Swan only needed to give an order, and Nox would be able to take her down.

Yet, he chose to fight with her himself.

“Are you frightened?” Nox appeared next to Jeanne because he saw her looking straight at Fourth Master Swan’s back.

At this moment, Fourth Master Swan was lying on the bed.

Finn cut open his black shirt.

Once he cut it open, Jeanne was even more stunned.
