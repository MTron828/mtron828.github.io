Chapter 1718: The Conflict Between Shelly and Nox Broke Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly just watched as he threw a fit, knowing what he meant.

“Do you really think that when I’m together with you, you’re the only one I’m seeing? Yes, I like you Shelly, but I don’t know when I fell in love with you. You use my liking for you as an excuse to mistreat me, and I’ve endured it all! After all, it’s no big deal if you don’t treat me well. But Shelly, you can’t break up with me even if you want to! I won’t break up with you! Even if you’re dragging me down, I won’t break up with you!” Nox said through gritted teeth.

“Why do you have to do this, Nox?” Shelly also got angry.

“That’s just who I am. I’m ruthless and evil, just like how I was to you back when you were in a car accident and I refused to visit you. That’s just how cruel I am. Yes, I admit that the child in Zoe’s belly was mine, and I aborted it. So what? I don’t feel guilty, not even a bit, that Zoe lost her uterus because of the abortion! I will eliminate everyone who hurt me. I’m that terrible of a person, but so what? I’m Nox, and I can do whatever I want! What can you do to me?” Nox said coldly. “Nobody can do anything to me! The Leader is my best friend!”

“So, are you proud of who you are? Of being evil?” Shelly gnashed her teeth and asked him.

“Yes! I’m proud of who I am!” Nox said fiercely. “So, don’t mess with me, Shelly. If you make me mad, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”

“Nox!” Shelly could not suppress her anger anymore.

“Not only can I do that to you, but I can do it to Bella too! If I can save her, I can also make her disappear the same way. You-”

“Slap!” Shelly slapped Nox hard across the face.

She struck him so hard that her palm trembled from the pain.

“Enough, Nox! Why are you so such a horrible person?” Shelly was clearly on the verge of breaking down.

Nox endured Shelly’s slap, his eyes a little red. Just as tears were about to flow from his eyes, he forcefully pushed Shelly away.

Shelly was half-squatting on the ground when Nox pushed her, and she fell to the ground. The next second, Nox stood up from the ground, turned his back to Shelly, and walked to the bathroom.

“Don’t mess with me, Shelly. While I still like you, behave yourself. Then, when we break up, I can give you some benefits. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not being kind to you.”

Shelly watched as Nox left coldly. To her, there was no one worse than Nox in this world, and she wondered why she met him. She used to think she was lucky to have entered the Winter family, but only now did she realize that it was just the beginning of a nightmare.

When Shelly got up from the ground, Nox was washing his face with cold water.

Shelly said, “Nox, I’ve never regretted meeting you as much as I do now. I used to be so naive, thinking that it was a blessing to be your companion in the

Winters because the children in my hometown had to work hard, but the

Winters fed me, clothed me, and sent me to school. However, you ruined it all. Did you know that I had a miscarriage for you back then?”

Nox’s body froze for a moment, and tears seeped out of the corner of his eyes.

“I never thought of telling you because, firstly, I didn’t think you would care. And secondly, it was because I didn’t want you to feel burdened. After all, we were no longer together. You see, even if you had pushed me away, I was considerate enough to respect you and cause as little distress to you as possible. However, you’ve never been considerate of anyone.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Nox covered his face with both hands and kept splashing it with cold water. His body was trembling and shaking uncontrollably. In Shelly’s opinion, he was just suppressing his anger.

“I’m telling you now because I don’t think you’re worth me doing anything for you.”

With that, Shelly turned around and left the bathroom. Anyway, she could not make Nox understand her, and no one could change Nox’s decision.

After Shelly left, Nox finally let go of his hands and looked in the mirror at the person with red eyes and tears in his eyes. Was he really that horrible of a person in Shelly’s eyes? Did she not know that everything he said today was out of anger?

He did not want to hurt her. His heart would even ache to see her lose a strand of hair. However, he could not let her go because he knew that Shelly would leave as soon as he let go. He was afraid that if she left, his world would crumble!

Nox was in the bathroom for a long time while Shelly lay in bed, still awake. It was a quiet night.

Eventually, Nox took a shower, and when he went to bed, Shelly’s body tensed up. After Nox lay down, he moved closer to Shelly.

Shelly sneered. It seemed like no matter how much they fought and how close they were to breaking up, Nox would always do what he wanted. In fact, why should she waste time on Nox? As Nox said, she should behave. Then, when they broke up, maybe she could still get some benefit from Nox..
