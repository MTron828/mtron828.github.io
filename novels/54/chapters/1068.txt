1069 Do You Want To Reconcile With Finn?

The moment Monica opened the car door and was about to get out, Nox grabbed her arm.

Then, his eyes suddenly paused. One reason was that her wrist was frighteningly thin. Secondly, there were many uneven scars on her wrist.

He suddenly pulled up the sleeve on Monica’s wrist. In the darkness, he could clearly see the marks on her wrist, both old and new. They even looked a little scary.

“What did you do?!” Nox asked her.

Monica pushed Nox’s hand away.

She said, “Nothing.”

“If it’s nothing, why did you cut your wrist?!” Nox was obviously a little agitated.

He did not expect Monica to hurt her body like that.

“It’s just that I get too tired sometimes, so I wake myself up like that,” Monica said.

“Monica!” Nox did not believe her.

Monica had already pulled down her clothes again to cover the marks on her wrist. She said, “Thank you for tonight, Nox.”

As she spoke, she opened the door and got out of the car.

Nox gritted his teeth and glared at Monica. Under the dim street light, she looked weak, but she could still stand up straight and walk calmly.

“Monica, I suggest you see a psychiatrist!” Nox shouted behind Monica’s back.

Monica stopped in her tracks but did not turn around.

She did not want to tell Nox that she had gone to see one.

The doctor said that she had signs of depression and was initially diagnosed as having mild depression. He prescribed her some anti-depressants, and she took them every day.

She had to take it every day.

Nox watched Monica disappear in front of his eyes. In the end, he told the driver to drive away.

When he was leaving, he could not help but call Finn. “Where did you go?”

“To the hospital.” Finn said, “To see if the man will die.”

“Okay.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, there was a sudden silence.

Finn did not hang up either. Perhaps he was also waiting for Nox to tell him about Monica’s situation.

After all, they had parted ways just now.

“Finn,” Nox suddenly said.

“Yes.”

“Do you still like Monica?” Nox was unusually serious.

“No.” Finn was very certain.

“That’s good.” Nox said, “In that case, I’ll tell you that Monica might have depression.”

Finn chose to remain silent.

“When I sent her back just now, I saw a lot of suicide marks on her wrists. However, she didn’t die, so they shouldn’t be deep. I even suspect that Monica’s dagger was not only for self-defense but also for her to kill herself at any time!” Nox said, but he did not know why he was telling Finn all that. “Anyway, if you don’t like her, just leave her alone. It’s her own business. Moreover, Monica was the one who caused Cardellini Enterprise to end up like this, so she can’t blame anyone.”

“Yes,” Finn replied indifferently.

“Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine incident will be taken to court the day after tomorrow, and once the trial starts, Michael’s life will be over. For the next two days, I’ve arranged for someone to protect Monica. Michael won’t succeed again.”

“That’s good.” Finn did not seem to be in a good mood.

“It’s getting late. I’m going home to sleep. Call me if you need anything.”

“Okay.”

With that, Finn hung up the phone.

He had just arrived at the hospital’s parking lot and had yet to get out of the car. Hence, he just leaned back in his chair and looked straight ahead, with the phone in his hand.

He had an impulse, but in the end, he managed to suppress it.

…

At night, when Michael received the news, he punched the wall. He could not believe that Monica escaped under his orders!

He had never thought that Monica could save herself.

How did she save herself?!

She had no power at all, so how did she escape from the people he had sent? Most importantly, she even stabbed him.

He admitted that he did not order his men to kill Monica immediately because he did not want to.

What was more, he did not want Monica to die so easily.

Therefore, he ordered the people who killed Monica to torture her before she died, and the best way to torture a woman was... to rape her.

He wanted Monica to know that since she had rejected him, he could find a million other people to make her life a living hell.
