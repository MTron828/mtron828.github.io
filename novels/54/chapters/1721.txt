Somehow, she believed that boiling water was better. While she waited for the water to boil, Nox finished his cup of water and brought to cup to the kitchen.

Shelly naturally took it and was prepared to wash it when Nox stopped her. “I’ll wash it myself.”

Shelly nodded. “Alright.”

Just as Nox was about to wash it, he thought of what Shelly said about him not doing anything right and felt like he was causing trouble for Shelly.

Hence, he thought about it and said, “You should wash it.”

Shelly looked at Nox, who she found a little weird sometimes. Nevertheless, she took Nox’s cup and rinsed it. Then, she wiped it down with a towel before placing it back in the cupboard.

Nox observed her silently. If he had washed it himself, he would probably have just washed it and left it at the side. As such, he noted down what Shelly did in his mind.

“It’s getting late. You should go wash up. I’ll go back to the room after the water boils. ”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

He knew that Shelly did not like him being by her side, so he decided to compromise and live peacefully with her for the next year. At the very least, he did not want Shelly to find him more annoying.

The moment he turned to leave, the kettle whistled. Shelly was about to put the water bottle into the thermos flask when the handle of the kettle suddenly came off. Shelly watched, in shock, as the boiling water was about to pour on her

Suddenly, two large hands caught the kettle. The moment they caught it, the water from the kettle spilled out and drenched the back of Nox’s hands.

Nox gritted his teeth and endured it. Then, he placed the kettle on the bar counter and turned around to ask anxiously, “Did you get scalded?”

Shelly was stunned.

“Where did you get burned?” Nox asked anxiously.

Shelly was not scalded. However, she looked at the back of Nox’s hand, which was red and blistering, looking very ferocious. Yet, he kept asking her where she was hurt as if he could not feel the pain.

“Nox, the back of your hand.” Shelly pointed at his hand. Nox instinctively shrank back as he did not want Shelly to see it.

“It’s a serious burn,” Shelly said. “It’s nothing,” Nox said indifferently.

“Nox.”

“It’s really nothing.” Nox said bluntly, “Did you get burned?”

“I didn’t, but your hand-”

“I said it’s fine!” Nox started to get angry.

Shelly bit her lip, knowing how short-tempered Nox was. However, after Nox lost his temper, he immediately regretted it. He simply wanted to get along with Shelly and did not wish for them to fight and not talk to each other for two months. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At that thought, he suddenly stretched his hands out, showing the back of them which were badly burned.

“Yes, you’re right. I can’t do anything right. All I know is to cause trouble for you!” Nox said in exasperation.

Shelly felt a little guilty, and it made her wonder whether she had been too harsh on him.

She gritted her teeth and held Nox’s hand to the tap to rinse it. “Let’s rinse it for now and head to the hospital later. You can’t be careless with burns.”

Shelly quickly left the kitchen and took Nox’s phone. “What’s your password? I’ll call your assistant and get him to pick you up. Bella is alone at home, so I can’t send you to the hospital.” Nox said nothing.

“Nox.” Shelly was worried. “Please.”

Nox hesitated before telling her the password, and his face turned a little red after he said it out loud. It was because his password was Shelly’s birthday.

He used to despise those who did it and thought it was stupid. However, after he got together with Shelly, he could not help but change all his passwords to numbers related to Shelly. Only then did he know that when one liked someone, they would do a lot of stupid things. It was so childish that he questioned whether he was himself.

Shelly was a little embarrassed when she entered Nox’s password. However, it was over soon.

She asked, “What’s your assistant’s name?”

Nox told her his name, and Shelly dialed a number. The call was quickly connected.

The other party was extremely respectful. ‘Mr. Winter.”

“I’m Shelly, Nox’s…” Shelly paused. “Girlfriend.”

Hearing the word ‘girlfriend’ warmed Nox’s heart. It was as if he had heard the most pleasant voice in the world.

‘Damn it. Calm down,’ he secretly told himself and stopped smiling.

“Nox was scalded by boiling water, and it’s very serious. Can you take him to the hospital? It’s not convenient for me now.”

“Alright, Mrs. Winter,” the other party quickly said.

Shelly held her breath. Did not she say that she was his girlfriend?

“Mrs. Winter, where’s Mr. Winter now? I’ll be right there.”

Shelly gave him the addresses.

The other party said bluntly, “Mrs. Winter, you could’ve told me he was at home. I often send Mr. Winter home, and no matter how late it is, Mr. Winter will always go back. Sometimes, even if he doesn’t go upstairs, he’ll fall asleep in the parking lot downstairs.”

Shelly was speechless at how talkative the assistant was. Besides, she did not want to know so much.

“Mrs. Winter, I’ll be there in ten minutes,” the other party said respectfully.

“Alright, sorry to trouble you.”

Shelly hung up the phone and said to Nox, “He said he’ll be here in ten minutes.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

“Where should I put your phone?” After all, Nox’s hands were injured.

“My pocket.”

Shelly put the phone into his pocket. As her fingers touched his thigh, Nox could feel his heart racing..

Sorry for the inconvenience. Thank you very much!
