The ward was very quiet. It was as if they were quietly waiting for a miracle to happen. Monica did not even dare to breathe as she stared blankly at Finn carrying the baby and placing it in front of her chest.

After a while, the sound of a baby crying suddenly rang out. “Wah…”

Monica was shocked. “Why is he crying?”

“Obviously because he didn’t get to eat anything,” Finn explained.

“That means I don’t have it yet.”

“I just checked. You do have it, but it’s stuck.”

“In that case, what should we do?” Monica was at a loss.

“Let him suck on it for a while more.” Finn, on the other hand, was calmer.

It was as if he knew everything, and he knew her body structure better than she did, which Monica feel a little guilty. Finn must have put in some effort during her pregnancy. As for her, all she did was ate and slept all day, so she did not know anything now.

“Wah…” The baby started crying again.

He was probably really hungry because he was crying a little sadly.

“He’s crying again.” Monica could not bear to see him cry.

She did not know how she could have made such a small, cute person cry so sadly.

“It’s fine.” Finn was determined.

“Do you not like the brother?” Monica frowned and scrutinized him.

“No, I do,” Finn denied.

“Then, why aren’t you doing anything when he’s crying?”

“This is a process he should go through.” Finn said frankly, “If he wants milk, he’ll have to work hard for it.”

“How old is he?”

“Once a person is born, they must learn to work hard. There are things that he has to work hard for at every stage of life. For example, when he’s born, he has to work hard to help his mother give birth naturally. Or when he’s feeding himself, he has to rely on himself to suck on his mother’s breasts to get milk. When he’s older, he has to learn to speak, walk, and learn. It’s all part of the evolutionary history of mankind, and no one can go against it.”

Monica felt that she had been brainwashed by Finn’s reasonable answer.

Just like that, the older brother cried as he sucked on his mother’s breasts. Although Monica could not stand it anymore, Finn refused to give in. Hence, she could only cheer on the brother.

After some time, the brother had quieted down for a long time. Then, when Monica heard him swallowing, she looked at Finn in surprise.

Finn’s lips curled into a smile as he patted the brother’s head. “Good job!”

Monica could feel the pride she had for her son. Suddenly, she believed that… Finn would be a very competent and great father in the future. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After the older brother had drunk some milk, Finn carried him away. However, the moment he carried the older brother away, the latter immediately started crying.

“What are you doing?” Monica was unhappy.

He was perfectly fine. Why did Finn have to carry him away?

“We still need some help here.” With that, he carried the brother to the other side of Monica’s breast.

Another sucking on it for a while, the brother started crying again.

“Mrs. Rose,” Finn called out from behind the curtain.

“Mr. Jones.”

“Can you bring the sister here?”

“Alright.” The nanny quickly agreed.

The next second, the nanny carried the sister in and placed her right in front of Monica’s breast.

“Can you teach Monica how to hold a child when she’s feeding the babies?” Finn reminded the nanny.

“Alright.” The nanny nodded.

Then, she began to carefully teach Monica how to hold the babies while feeding them milk. Monica finally held the baby firmly after learning from the nanny for a while.

As soon as the younger sister latched on, she swallowed it in big mouthfuls while her brother was still working hard on the other side.

Monica looked at her brother’s flushed face and looked at Finn. “Finn, you lied to me.”

“Hmm?” Finn held the brother earnestly and encouraged him.

“Why does the older brother have to go through the history of human evolution, but the younger sister doesn’t?”

The younger sister was clearly enjoying the fruits of her brother’s labor.

“Because she has a brother,” Finn said matter-of-factly.

However, Monica did not understand the logic.

“Isn’t the older brother born to protect his younger sister?”

Fortunately, the older brother eventually managed to suck the milk out with all his strength and began to drink in big mouthfuls.

As the two babies ate together, Monica felt like a super cow, waiting to be slaughtered. A woman who had given birth to a child had no image and privacy at all! She was simply a tool for feeding!

Finally, the two babies were done. However, it was obvious that the milk production was not enough, so the nanny carried them away and fed the two babies some milk powder..
