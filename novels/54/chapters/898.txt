899 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

He said to the miniature microphone, “I’m going to swap his hair now.”

The “he” was, of course, referring to Alex Duncan.

At that moment, a waiter had already approached Duncan, who was hiding his identity. He successfully cut off his hair and turned to leave.

“If I fail, it will be up to you guys,” Finn said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

With that, he leaned over again.

It was the same trick, but this time, he moved slightly closer to the waiter.

The waiter frowned and was about to leave him in the next second.

However, Finn did not let go of him. Instead, he deliberately rubbed against the waiter’s body for a while.

The moment the waiter noticed something strange and was about to make a move, Finn turned around and left.

That was because he had succeeded.

He walked a little faster and said as he walked, “Done.”

The waiter turned his head and glared at Finn’s back, which instantly disappeared from his sight. He touched the hair in his pocket and handed it to someone else. “I’m also being obstructed.”

The receiver nodded, turned around, and quickly walked toward Lucy to report, “A suspicious person has swapped it out.”

Lucy’s expression changed.

The number of people’s hair suspected to have been swapped out was a little too large.

That meant that everything they had done today was in vain. None of the hair here could be the person they were looking for. In this case, they still needed to find a needle in a haystack. To think they had mobilized so much manpower to do this, yet one person managed to mess it all up!

She narrowed her eyes and reported the situation in a low voice, “Someone is deliberately obstructing our operation at the scene. At present, the impact is relatively big. There is a 60 percent chance that the hair we have has been swapped. In other words, 60 percent of what we’ve done today is useless.”

Kingsley was currently outside the banquet hall, sitting in a black car, waiting for the results.

When he heard Lucy’s report, his expression turned ugly.

After all, he had spent so much effort on it only to obtain a little effect.

Had he underestimated Fourth Master Swan’s capabilities again?

Even though he thought that Fourth Master Swan might be able to predict their actions, he still found it hard to accept that Fourth Master Swan really did predict their actions.

Lucy continued her report, her eyes fixed on the stage. “If everything goes as expected, the banquet will end in ten minutes. We can’t afford to redo 60 percent of the work in such a short time.”

“Let me think,” Kingsley said coldly.

Lucy said no more.

At that moment, in the banquet hall, the assassins were still taking the guests’ hair, and Finn was still disrupting their operation.

The assassins of the Hills could not stand it anymore.

Lucy kept marking the hair that might have been swapped out.

She pursed her lips, and without Kingsley’s instructions, she directly said, “I suggest we do it openly!”

At that moment, Kingsley was still thinking about how to minimize his losses and how to get the most out of the situation. Hence, when he heard Lucy’s voice, he was stunned.

“Since the other party has been interfering with us, it means that that person must be involved. The Sanders are only worried that the person is not here. If we did it openly, we would not be able to control the situation and might even cause everyone to panic. In turn, that would cause the Sanders to lose their status and face. If that person really is here, even if we do something radical, I personally think that it’s more important for the Sanders to find that person than get criticized.”

Kingsley did not answer.

He was thinking about the possibility of Lucy’s suggestion.

He said, “It’s also possible that it’s just one of Fourth Master Swan’s tricks. This person isn’t here, but he’s deliberately making us think that this person existed to confuse us. He wants us to spend our energy on this and keep that person hidden.”

“Both are possible.” Lucy agreed, “However, in order to not let everything we’ve done today go to waste, I think it’s necessary for the Sanders to investigate this matter openly. Even if they can’t find that person, at least punish the person who tried to stop us. Otherwise, we’ll really be played by Fourth Master Swan for nothing. He won’t suffer any loss.”

“Don’t act rashly for now. Wait for my order,” Kingsley instructed, not agreeing directly.

Lucy responded before shifting her gaze to look for Jeanne.

After being taken away by Fourth Master Swan for so long…
