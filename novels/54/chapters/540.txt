Chapter 541: We Really Got A Divorce

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Save your breath,” Finn said coldly.

When Monica heard him, she felt like a knife had stabbed her heart.

“I think Monica loves you.”

“Maybe, but that’s not important anymore.”

“Actually, you can fight for it.” Jeanne was trying her best to set them up.

“I have.” Finn said nonchalantly, “And that is why I told you not to waste your time.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

From Finn’s tone, she could roughly tell that Finn had given up.

“No matter what, thank you.”

He thanked Jeanne because she understood him.

After that, he returned the phone to Monica.

Monica looked at Finn, who still did not spare her a single glance, and turned her head coldly to the window.

Then, she placed the phone back to her ear and said, “Jeannie.”

Jeanne, on the contrary, was silent.

She was exasperated just a moment ago. Although she could suppress her anger toward Monica and try to convince her with reason, she suddenly felt that there was nothing more to say.

Monica was determined to walk on the path of no return, and no one could stop her. Perhaps only when she hit a wall and got hurt would she know how stupid she was to take that path.

All of them were trying to persuade her, but it was useless.

In the end, Jeanne chose to compromise.

She believed everyone had to pay the price for their choices. Since Monica could not be convinced otherwise, she should face the consequences on her own.

Moreover, no one knew what kind of person Michael was.

If he liked Monica, being with him would still make Monica happy.

Jeanne admitted that she, herself, was also selfish. Between Finn and Monica, she would ultimately choose Monica.

As long as Michael was good enough for Monica, Monica’s life would not be too bad.

As for Finn, maybe he had thought it through.

Jeanne sighed.

Although she chose to side with Monica, she still felt helpless. She said, “Monica, I don’t support your decision to choose Michael, but I respect you. However, you must understand that if you do this, you’ll have to pay the price. If you choose Michael, your relationship with Finn will end. As the party involved, you may not understand, but as an outsider, we see it very clearly. If I can see it, Michael should also be able to see it, but he didn’t reject your help. You better understand this.”

“I trust Michael. I trust him.” Monica trusted Michael completely.

At that moment, Jeanne understood why Finn had given up so easily.

Monica continued to say firmly, “I know I’m hurting Finn by doing this, but compared to Finn and my love for him, I’m more inclined to help Michael.”

In that case, there was nothing else for Jeanne to say.

Monica already knew what she wanted, which was to help Michael even if it meant she had to break up with Finn.

Finn also heard it.

However, he kept looking out the window, thinking he had let himself down in the end by loving Monica.

Jeanne said, “Since you’ve thought it through, just do what you want.”

Anyway, no one knew what would happen in the end.

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

With that, Jeanne hung up the phone.

After the call ended, Monica’s tears kept flowing, and she felt horrible. It turned out that making a decision as an adult was difficult!

Suddenly, a napkin appeared in front of her eyes.

Monica raised her head to see Michael, whose face was full of concern.

She took the napkin and used it to dry her tears.

When the car arrived at the civil affairs bureau, the three of them got out of the car separately.

Monica was leaning on her crutches. Since walking was a struggle for her, Michael went over to support her, while Finn remained indifferent to her.

He just looked at them coldly in front of him, keeping a distance that was neither too far nor too close.

They arrived at the entrance of the civil affairs bureau. However, because the civil affairs bureau had yet opened, they entered through a small path.

Michael held Monica’s hand and suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Monica turned to look at him.

Michael said, “Why don’t you think it through again?”

That showed he was still looking out for her. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Monica shook her head.

Since she had already made a choice, and a difficult one at that, regret had never crossed her mind.
