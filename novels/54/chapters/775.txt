Chapter 776: Jenifer Exposed, Utterly Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You can Sue him now!” the reporter said with righteous indignation.

Jasmine hoped so, but she no longer had any hope for anyone or anything.

After all, what else could she expect after being abandoned by her own mother?

She just stood there at the press conference.

Everyone’s attention was on Jasmine until Jenifer started to go crazy again.

She walked toward Jasmine and slapped the latter across the face.

Jasmine did not fight back or react. It was as if she was used to it.

“Why didn’t you tell me that Eden abused you to this extent? Why didn’t you tell me?” After hitting Jasmine, Jenifer wailed.

The acting had started again. For Jenifer to be able to continue acting at a time like that, Jeanne really admired her.

“Tell me. Would I be so cruel as to not take you away from the Swans? I thought that a divorce would hurt you, a woman, the most. Moreover, Eden had shown that he was well-mannered, so I never thought that he would treat you like this. He’s worse than a beast! You should’ve told me earlier instead of saying that you want to divorce Eden. I thought that you were just having a fight with him. I really didn’t think Eden would be so cruel!”

However, Jasmine was unmoved.

She had no reaction to Jenifer’s behavior.

She said, “Mom, stop acting. Not everyone here is a fool. All you’re doing now is embarrassing yourself!”

“Jasmine, I know you’ve been wronged. I’ll take you to the police now and sue Eden for domestic violence…” While speaking, she dragged Jasmine along and was about to leave the scene.

She wanted to take that opportunity to leave.

Jeanne sneered at how Jenifer thought she could escape unscathed after causing all the trouble.

As such, Jeanne walked up to Jenifer and blocked her from taking Jasmine away.

Jenifer glared at her.

“Mother, you’ve accused me of so many things. How can you just leave like that? The matter hasn’t even been resolved yet. How can you leave just like that? How can we let down the tens of millions of citizens of Harken who are watching our live stream? By the way, you should know that the press conference is being broadcasted live on the internet,” Jeanne reminded Jenifer.

Jenifer’s face instantly turned pale.

However, she tried hard to calm herself down and looked at Jeanne calmly.

“Come over.” Jeanne motioned for Jenifer to sit down.

Jenifer gritted her teeth.

Under Jeanne’s threat, she had no choice but to sit down at the press conference.

Jeanne softened her tone to Jasmine. “You sit next to me.”

With that, Jasmine sat down, and Jeanne sat beside them.

She said, “We’ve taken so many of the country’s public resources in front of the entire country. It’s time for the Lawrences to make things clear to the public.

“What do you want to say?” Jenifer gritted her teeth.

“I won’t say much about what you just said about how you’ve been good to me since I was young and treated me like your biological daughter or how I’ve been making things difficult for you. Jasmine has made it clear just now, and I’m sure everyone understands what kind of person you really are,” Jeanne said nonchalantly.

Jenifer was seething with anger, but at that moment, she did not know how to refute it.

Being accused by her biological daughter, and with all the facts being the truth, she could not find a reason to refute it at all. She was afraid that the more she said, the more humiliated she would be.

“However, I still need to prove my innocence in front of everyone.” Jeanne said, “So, was it me, or did someone else order Joshua to do what he did to Ms. Sanders?! Is this person Eden?”

“It was you! You were the one who deliberately set a trap for Joshua to kick him out of the company!” Jenifer insisted.

“Mother, you have to think carefully. Although we’re not in court, the law still applies. After all, you’re speaking in front of the entire country. You have to be responsible for every word you say,” Jeanne threatened.

Jenifer began to panic.

“By the way, it’s also a crime to frame someone. According to Harken’s laws, depending on the severity of the case, you can be sentenced to one to ten years in prison. If you want to spend the rest of your life in prison, you can continue to lie. Anyway, the innocent will know the truth, and I believe that the procuratorial authorities of Harken won’t be so incompetent that they can’t distinguish the truth.” Jeanne said calmly, but it still made one’s hair stand on end.
