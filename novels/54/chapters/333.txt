Chapter 334: The Wedding: Jeanne, My Heart!

Moreover, the cars were filled with flowers, ranging from roses to seasonal peonies. It was the epitome of romantic gesture.

The sight blew Monica away, and she stared with her mouth agape.

“There are 50 types of flowers,” Finn said.

Monica was stunned. How much did they cost?

She knew Fourth Master Swan was wealthy, but that was a reminder of just how rich he was.

In the meantime, the two of them got into the car, which was behind the wedding car. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“What else is he giving her as a gift?” Now, Monica was very curious.

“Well, as far as I know, he has transferred her eight percent of the Swans’ original shares,” Finn said.

At that moment, she could not help but glance at the line of cars filled with flowers behind her.

She thought Fourth Master Swan was flaunting his wealth.

After all, the Swans had a lot of money that he could flaunt as he pleased, but this was on a whole other level.

She did not expect that.. the Fourth Master of the Swans family would be willing to spend so much to marry Jeanne.

In fact, not many wealthy people would be willing to go to such an extent for a wedding.

......

However, Fourth Master Swan had broken the record for it being the grandest and most unique wedding.

It was clear that he had put a lot of effort into it.

Monica suddenly smiled and said, “I didn’t expect that the Fourth Master would treat Jeannie so well.”

At that moment, she was really certain of that. Otherwise, why would he have put in so much effort just to get married?

Every single thing, down to all the details, was perfect.

Finn did not echo her sentiments.

Anyone who was not blind could tell how good Fourth Master Swan was to Jeanne.

Monica seemed to be so emotional for a second. She couldn’t help but say, “How could Fourth Master Swan do so much in just four days?”

“With money, none of this is difficult,” Finn said straightforwardly.

That was true.

“But coming up with all these ideas is not easy.”

As for ideas, who knew how long he had thought about them?

In the car, Monica kept sighing. She was really impressed by Fourth Master Swan.

On the other hand, the newly-wed couple in the car in front was silent.

Nox was sitting with them in the passenger seat.

In the long and expensive Lincoln, only Edward and Jeanne were sitting inside, looking at each other.

Suddenly, there was silence.

“You can pretend I don’t exist and kiss or hug each other. It’s fine by me,” Nox suddenly said.

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

Although she was a little shy, Nox’s words had made the atmosphere between the two of them not so awkward.

“Fourth Master,” Jeanne said.

“Yes.”

“I’m sorry to have made you spend so much money.”

At that, Edward frowned.

“I like it very much,” Jeanne suddenly said.

The corners of Edward’s lips curled up into a smile.

He said, “What do you like?”

“I like them all.”

“Be more specific.”

“The gown, accessories, and bracelets,” Jeanne said.

She had never been fortunate enough to wear such expensive things in her life before. As it was her first time wearing them, she felt she looked very beautiful, so beautiful that she found herself somewhat stunning.
