Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the contrary, he was wondering when could he have a son!

“By the way, how is Monica?” Ruby suddenly thought of her daughter and quickly asked.

“She’s fine. Dr. Jones has been accompanying her inside, so she’s in good condition. It’s just that after giving birth to two babies, she might be a little exhausted, but she would be fine after a nap.”

“Okay, thank you.”

“As we should.” The nurse smiled and said, “Now that the two babies are out, which family member of the patient would want to come with me to give the babies their inoculations?”

“Aunty and Uncle, you guys can go ahead. We’ll wait here for Monica to come out,” Jeanne said.

“Alright, we’ll leave Monica to you and head over now.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

Then, Gary and Ruby carried the two babies and left with the nurse.

Not long after, Finn pushed Monica out in a wheelchair. She looked radiant and full of energy, and when she saw them waiting for her outside, she also looked pleased. Jeanne could tell from Monica’s expression that the girl was showing off.

“Monica, how are you feeling?” Sarah asked.

“I’ve never felt better in my life,” Monica said excitedly. “Do you know what it feels like to poop after nine months of constipation?” The crowd was at a loss for words.

“The pleasure is indescribable,” Monica said with a smile.

Finn could not bear to listen to her anymore, so he said, “Let’s go back to the ward first.”

“Okay.”

With that, the group returned to the high-class ward, where the nurse and nanny were all ready. Since they had twins, they naturally hired twice the amount of people.

Finn carried Monica from the wheelchair and placed her on the bed. The biggest advantage of natural birth was that after giving birth, she was free, unlike a C-section, where the pain only began after the baby was born. That was why Monica was in a very good state of mind and was not feeling weak. “Jeannie, did you see the twins just now? It’s a boy and a girl!” Monica boasted.

“Yes, they both look like you.” Jeanne nodded.

At that moment, Monica was allowed to show off. “Is that so? I didn’t even notice their looks.”

“It’s true,” Jeanne said with certainty.

“Then, they must be very handsome and beautiful.” Monica was overjoyed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“No,” Nox suddenly interrupted. “I was wondering why the babies looked so ugly, but it turns out they look like you.”

“Nox, you b*stard!” Monica cursed angrily.

“Keep your voice down,” Finn reminded her from the side. “You’re supposed to be resting now. You can’t be as carefree as usual.”

“Finn, Nox said our children are ugly,” Monica said like a spoiled child.

Finn glanced at Nox and said, “It’s okay. He’s just jealous. After all, he’s the only one without a child.”

Nox was furious. He finally understood why Monica called Finn a sc*mbag. It was because was really Finn asking for a beating.

“I don’t have one either,” Sarah interrupted.

She did not want Shelly to feel awkward. After all, now that Shelly was dating Nox, teasing Nox would be equivalent to teasing Shelly, was it not? Besides, Shelly was not familiar with those people and would be shy.

“Aren’t you dating Brandon? The sooner you get married, the sooner you’ll have children,” Finn said bluntly.

“What?” Monica was so shocked that she almost jumped up from the bed.

“I told you to behave yourself. You need to rest.” Finn pushed Monica down, forcing her to lie down.

“Finn, how did you know?” Sarah blushed.

She and Brandon had also happened by chance. The two of them… slept together first before they started dating. However, none of them had made it public yet because they did not think their relationship was stable, but they did expect Finn to expose them.

“I bumped into them by accident,” Finn said indifferently.

He did not seem to be interested in their relationship.

On the contrary, Monica, who was lying on the bed, was very excited. “When did you guys start dating? How did you guys start dating? Brandon, when did you hook up with my cousin? Didn’t you say you liked me?”

When Monica blurted out the last sentence, Finn’s expression changed.

Brandon had yet to answer when Monica asked Sarah again, “Why are you always going after my men?”

Sarah blushed..
