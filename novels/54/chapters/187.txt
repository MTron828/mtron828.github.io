Chapter 188: You and Fourth Master Swan Have Different Standpoints

In a room full of a combative atmosphere.

Edward held Jeanne’s arm tightly, refusing to let go.

Kingsley stood not far away, his whole body emitting cold air as he watched Edward’s actions coldly.

“Fourth Master Swan,” Kingsley said coldly, “I, Kingsley Thorn, never bully the weak.”

Edward’s expression obviously changed.

Kingsley continued, “That’s why I don’t fight with people who are injured.”

The bandage on Edward’s body was very obvious, and at this moment, he was even on an IV drip.

“But if you insist on going against me, I can do whatever it takes.” Kingsley’s face revealed a cruel look.

Edward sneered. “Kingsley Thorn?”

Kingsley nodded slightly. “That’s me.”

Edward conveniently removed the drip on his left hand.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly when she saw his actions.

She saw Fourth Master Swan let go of her hand and remove the blanket to get out of bed.

‘Didn’t Dr. Jones ask you to rest in bed as much as possible?!’

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She told herself that what Fourth Master Swan wanted to do had nothing to do with her.

His entire life had nothing to do with her, so if he wanted to live or die, that was his business.

Edward walked toward Kingsley with steady footsteps as though he was not injured at all.

Between the two of them... Edward was slightly taller.

Even so, Kingsley’s aura was not inferior at all.

Edward was a step away.

It was as if the situation became more intense

At that moment, Edward’s face darkened.

He suddenly punched out fiercely. His fist carried the wind and had an astonishing strength.

Kingsley’s eyes narrowed. He stretched out his hand and was about to receive the blow.

“Fourth Master Swan!” Jeanne suddenly blocked between them and hugged Edward.

Edward was stunned.

Kingsley only moved back slightly and did not take the initiative to attack at that moment.

“Don’t Fight,” Jeanne said.

Edward narrowed his eyes.

He looked at Jeanne hugging him tightly.

She avoided his injured back and hugged his waist.

Kingsley looked at Jeanne’s actions with a cold look.

Jeanne felt Fourth Master Swan’s calmness and only then did she leave his embrace. After that, she suddenly tiptoed.

She tiptoed and took the initiative to kiss Fourth Master Swan’s lips.

As for Edward... He gulped.

“Rest well.” After Jeanne finished, Jeanne held Kingsley and turned around to leave.

Edward stared at them intently.

He watched as Jeanne moved further and further away from him.

Downstairs, Jeanne held Kingsley’s hand as they went downstairs.

At this moment, Finn was treating the bruises on Nox’s body. When Nox saw Kingsley and Jeanne coming downstairs, he flew into a rage again.

He immediately rushed over.

Finn was a little speechless.

He hurriedly followed them.

“You’re leaving just like that?!” Nox stared at Jeanne, his eyeballs almost popping out.

“Fourth Master Swan is injured, but I can’t help much either,” Jeanne answered coldly.

Nox was about to explode again.

‘Is Jeanne heartless?!

‘Fourth Master Swan has done so much for her, yet she’s still so indifferent.’

“You’re not allowed to leave!” Nox was furious.

Jeanne’s expression was a little ugly.

She looked at Nox, looking at how he looked like he was about to explode from anger at any moment. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She was about to speak when Finn blocked in front of Nox. “You really can’t help much here. I’ll take care of Fourth Master Swan. You go and settle your case properly.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She smiled at Finn.

“Oh right.” Finn picked up Jeanne’s documents from the sofa. “Fourth Master instructed me to look into your case. See if these can be of any help.”

Jeanne was a little surprised.

She looked at the documents Finn handed to her in surprise.

Finn smiled slightly.

Jeanne had a surge of emotions.

She smiled and said, “Thank you.”

Then, she took the documents and left with Kingsley.

Nox watched Jeanne leave without any hesitation.

He turned around and roared at Finn, “Finn, when did you become so cowardly?!”

Finn ignored him.

“What right do you have to let Jeanne leave with that man?!” Nox was indignant.

“I know I can’t beat him.” Finn was very calm.

“Then why are you stopping me?!”

“I’m not stopping you.” Finn looked calm. “You can still go after him now. I won’t stop you.”

“...”

“I’ll go and see Fourth Master.” Finn went upstairs.

Nox was enraged.

Finn was really cunning!

Upstairs.

Finn looked at Edward lying on the bed expressionlessly.

However, his back was red.

Finn knew that something like this would happen.
