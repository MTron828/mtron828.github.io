1181 Jeanne’s Betrayal, Her Past Exposed

“It’s probably because you’re too cunning, so cunning that my mother couldn’t kill you on her own. Of course, my mother also tried to return to the Hills, but when she returned, she was rejected by the Hills. The Hills is a cruel family. Once you leave, you will leave forever. My mother knelt in the Hills for a whole day and a night, but the door to the Hills never opened for her. Hence, she had to leave and rely on herself. But she didn’t expect that before she could kill you, she found out she was pregnant.

“When she was pregnant with me, she forced herself to swallow her hatred. Because if she failed, she would lose two lives. So, she deliberately found someone to marry and rejected your feelings for her on the grounds that she didn’t want to be with a married man. However, I didn’t expect that even though she had endured all the hatred for me, she was still killed by you!” Jeanne was very agitated. She pointed her gun at Warren’s head. “Why did you kill her? Why?!”

“Alexander Lawrence killed her, not me!”

“Could Alexander have killed the eldest young lady of the Hills?!” Jeanne glared at Warren. “Do you think that’s possible?!”

Warren gritted his teeth.

“I’ll give you one more chance. Why did you kill my mother? Why?!” Jeanne was so agitated that she aimed the gun at his head, ready to shoot him dead at any moment.

“Because I found out that your mother knew I was the one who killed your father!” Under Jeanne’s coercion, Warren confessed, “She didn’t give up on killing me at all. She was secretly collecting evidence to expose me. If I hadn’t discovered it in advance, my position as the leader of the country would be ruined! So, I had to kill her and destroy all the evidence!”

That was right. The year her mother died, Warren became the leader of the country! He could only take that position because he killed her mother!

Jeanne’s eyes were bloodshot.

Now that the truth was out, she did not need to be merciful anymore! With that, she pulled the trigger.

“Jeanne, if we’re going to die, we’ll die together!” Warren suddenly sneered.

Stunned, Jeanne looked at Warren’s crazy smile.

She lowered her head and watched as Warren suddenly tore open his clothes, revealing a bulletproof vest under his clothes.

Just like her, he had put on a bulletproof vest in advance. Therefore, even if he was shot twice, he would not die.

On top of that, a bomb was tied to the bulletproof vest, and the fuse of the bomb was in Warren’s hands at the moment. Once he pulled the fuse… the two of them would die together!

Warren laughed sinisterly. “Do you really think I’m that easy to kill?!”

Jeanne gulped.

Kingsley had said it before.

The fact that Warren could get rid of his dissidents and hold the position of leader for so many years without being qualified meant that he was definitely not a simple person. Hence, killing him would not be easy!

Back then, after her father, Joseph, died, her mother returned to the Hills to seek revenge. However, the Hills rejected her request as it involved the Sanders. The reason they rejected her was that since she had left the Hills, she would never be able to return!

Of all the people from the Hills, only Kingsley secretly ran out of the manor to see her.

At that time, Kingsley was still young and did not have any power. However, he promised her mother that he would definitely avenge her in the future.

Her mother did not nod. Instead, she apologized to Kingsley, probably because she was sorry for leaving the cruel Hill family to him.

From then on, her mother never returned to the Hills.

Kingsley, however, never forgot the matter of avenging her mother!

In fact, after Kingsley had taken over the Hills, he had tried to test the Sanders and Warren, but he failed every time. There was even one time when he almost exposed himself. As Kingsley was afraid of alerting the enemy, he did not dare to act rashly without being fully prepared. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Later, Kingsley brought her back to the Hills.

Kingsley had long known of her existence. After her mother’s death, he had also thought of bringing Jeanne back to the Hills. However, he chose to let her go several times after seeing how innocent and naive she was.

It was only when something happened to Jeanne that he had no choice but to bring her back to the Hills and tell her the truth.

He told her everything about her biological parents.

Jeanne did not have any feelings for her father, but her feelings for her mother were still fresh in her mind even after many years. When she heard the reason for her parents’ deaths, she naturally wanted to take revenge for them!

Perhaps it was because of the blood feud between her parents and the Sanders, but Jeanne grew up very quickly and accepted all the cruel reality. She accepted the assassin organization that she had never accepted and the government of a country.

Her and Kingsley’s plan was to make use of the Duncans’ power to bring down the Sanders and then secretly kill Warren. However, she had to gain the Sanders’ trust before she could do anything. Without trust, she had no way to scheme against Warren

Hence, Kingsley took the initiative to find Warren and tell him that Jeanne was her daughter.

At that time, they did not know whether Warren was once with her mother or not, but Kingsley did not need to know. He just wanted Warren to misunderstand that he thought Jeanne was Warren’s daughter so that Warren would think that he could better control the Hills.
