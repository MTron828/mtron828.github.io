It was as if they had returned to the past.

Back then, after they broke up and got married, Finn also treated her with the same indifference.

“Get out of the car!” Finn ordered again.

Monica gritted her teeth and pretended not to hear him.

She wanted to go against Finn now. She refused to believe that Finn would do anything to her!

Finn waited for Monica for a few seconds, and that was it.

Suddenly, he leaned forward toward the passenger seat, bent down, and rudely removed her seatbelt. In the next second, he dragged Monica out of her seat.

Even though he knew her leg was injured, he still pulled with quite some strength.

As a result of that, Monica almost fell to the ground.

She glared at Finn, looking at his expressionless face.

After Finn pulled Monica out of his car, he opened the back door, took out Monica’s crutches, and handed them to her.

However, Monica did not take it.

At that moment, she really wanted to strangle Finn to death.

While holding herself back from doing so, she saw Finn throw her crutches on the ground.

“Finn!” Monica screamed.

She could no longer take it anymore.

How could Finn treat her like that? How could he be so immoral?

Even if it was a breakup, he could not take it so far. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Tears welled up in her bloodshot eyes.

Despite that, Finn did not even look at her. After throwing her crutches to the ground, he sat back in the driver’s seat, stepped on the gas pedal, and left.

Monica just watched as Finn left.

She was so angry that she wanted to kill Finn.

Back then, Monica told herself that Finn would regret treating her like that.

Once Michael had his career, she would return to Finn’s side, and when Finn saw that she was only helping Michael out as a friend, he would definitely regret treating her badly!

However, now that the day had come, she realized she was too stupid.

Everyone could see that she was the stubborn one — that she was the one who had lost Finn and could never get him back again!

…

Jonathan’s funeral went on for three days, and on the fourth day, they buried him in the Lawrences’ cemetery.

As it was a cloudy day in late autumn in South Hampton City, it was a little cold.

When the autumn wind blew, it felt especially bleak.

Many people from South Hampton City came to say their last goodbyes.

The scene was very solemn and unusually melancholy.

Jeanne looked at Jonathan. Although he had been paralyzed and at home for many years, because of his clear mind, he still held controlled over the entire Lawrence family and had lived quite a glorious life. Yet, now that he was dead, he was reduced to a box of ashes. Even his only son did not come to send him off.

Come to think of it, Jonathan only had a tragic ending.

Everyone watched as Jonathan’s ashes were buried.

Meanwhile, Jenifer was crying her heart out by the side.

Jeanne glanced at her. She actually admired how Jenifer could still cry after crying for so many days.

After the funeral ended, the people left one after another. In the end, only Jenifer, Joshua, Jasmine, Eden, Jeanne, and Finn were left.

Edward had been away for a week now.

She was busy over the last two days, and Edward was probably very busy too. They were so busy that they did not even call each other.

At the cemetery, with most of the people gone, Jeanne also left as she did not want to stay any longer.

Jonathan was now gone from her life, and she would not think about him again.

With that, she turned around.

“Jeanne!” Jenifer suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

Now that everyone had left, Jenifer was starting to reveal her true colors.

Before her tears could dry, she had shed all pretenses with Jeanne.

Jeanne’s face was cold. “What?”

“I advise you not to have too many ideas about it. Some things are not yours, so it’s best not to dream about having them.”

“You’re talking about my grandfather’s inheritance, aren’t you?” Jeanne made it clear.

“It’s good that you know.”

“How the inheritance is divided is for the judge to decide. Do you think I have the power to interfere in the matter regarding the inheritance?” Jeanne sneered.

“I know what kind of person you are! Don’t think I don’t know that your return this time is to snatch the Lawrences’ assets.” Jenifer was certain.

“Since you think so, I have nothing to say.”
