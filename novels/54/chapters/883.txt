884 While the Wedding Was Going On

There was a dark french restaurant, Monica said to the waiter, “Please open a bottle of red wine.”

The waiter acknowledged respectfully.

Michael looked up at Monica.

Monica asked, “Aren’t you drinking?”

Michael did not speak, but it was obvious that he had never thought of drinking.

At that moment, Brie tried to smooth things over. “Drink some. Take it as giving you my blessings in advance.”

From her words and actions, it was impossible to tell that she did not reject Michael and Monica’s marriage.

Michael did not answer, so it was considered tacit approval even though his expression was grim.

The atmosphere at the dining table was a little awkward until their dinner was served.

They each ate their own portion, and the red wine was only served after.

The waiter poured them all a glass.

“I’m going to the washroom.” Monica wiped her lips and got up.

The others ate their dinner quietly, and no one took a sip of the wine.

She walked into the toilet of the restaurant and instantly became nervous.

Then, she quickly found the pill under her clothes. It was said that it melted as soon as it entered the water. However, how would she put it into Michael’s red wine?

Her heart raced, but she forced herself to calm down.

She had never done such a thing before, but… she had no choice but to do it.

She gritted her teeth and put the pill between his fingers like Jeannie taught her.

She had been practicing for the past few days.

She did not even know how Jeannie knew so much… tricks.

Anyway, it was of great use.

She looked at how nervous she was in the bathroom and then took a deep breath.

Jeannie was right. Everything she did was self-defense, so she should not feel guilty.

Everything she did was to protect her rights.

If Michael had not used any means to force her to get married, she would not be doing that to him.

Once Monica was calm enough, she walked out of the washroom and returned to the table. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The three people at the table were still eating dinner quietly.

After Monica sat down, she casually picked up her wine glass. “Drink some.”

“Director Ross can’t handle alcohol. I’ll drink on his behalf,” Brie said bluntly.

That was what Monica wanted to say because Monica knew that Michael could not drink.

One drink would make him drunk, and two drinks would knock him out.

Usually, Brie would be the one helping him with socializing.

That was also why Michael’s expression was so ugly when Monica suggested drinking.

It was because he could not drink.

Besides, tomorrow was their wedding, so he probably did not want her to get drunk tonight.

At that moment, Monica watched as Brie reached out to take Michael’s wine glass.

Monica said, “You usually drink for Michael during social gatherings, but I don’t think it seems appropriate for today’s occassion.”

Brie felt a little awkward at that moment as her hand froze in mid-air, and she did not pick up Michael’s wine glass.

Instead, it was Monica who reached out to take it.

The moment she took it, the pill between their fingers fell into the wine glass and instantly melted.

Monica’s heart was racing.

Jeannie had taught her how to place the drug, so no one could tell that she had done it. She had also practiced it to perfection at home. She had tested it in front of her parents, but they did not notice it. However, at that moment, she was still so nervous that her body was trembling, and she was trying their best to hold it in.

She tried her best to look nonchalant and wanted to drink Michael’s glass of red wine.

“Give it to me,” Michael suddenly said.

Monica’s heart beat faster because she had achieved his goal.

Jeanne said that in such an occasion, Michael would never let someone else drink for him. Even if he only took a sip of red wine, he would never let someone else drink for him. Michael also had his pride.

Indeed, Jeanne had guessed everything.

She was the one who had dated Michael for so many years, yet her understanding of Michael was like a blank piece of paper, while Jeannie knew him like the back of her hand.

Monica watched as Michael took the wine glass away from her hand.

He said, “I’ll have to trouble the two of you for my wedding with Monica tomorrow.”

“Director Ross, you’re too kind. It’s my honor to be your best man.” The best man quickly raised his glass.

Brie glanced at Michael and raised her glass without showing any expression.

It was the same for Monica.

The four of them clinked glasses and took a sip.

After taking a sip, they continued to drink, but Michael did not drink much.
