1237 Susan’s Arrival

In the end, Jeanne slept in the same bed as Edward. However, their backs were facing each other, so there was some distance between them.

Since she had only two months left, Jeanne did not think there was anything to fuss about. With that, she closed her eyes and forced herself to sleep.

Sometimes, if she slept too much during the day, she would not be able to fall asleep at night. Hence, she just lay there quietly.

The room was extremely quiet, and no one made a single sound until…

Much later at night, the man who had his back to her suddenly turned around and approached her.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was pretending to be asleep when she felt Edward’s arms around her waist, his body pressed against her back, and his head buried in her neck. Nevertheless, she held it in and tolerated him.

That one night, Jeanne woke up many times. The baby was so big that it pressed against her bladder, and she would always have the urge to go to the toilet not long after she fell asleep.

Every time, Edward would wake up with her. Whenever she made the slightest movement, he would help her up from the bed, send her to the bathroom, and wait for her at the door. After that, he would help her to get back to bed. That went on and on for the entire night.

Early in the morning, Jeanne opened her eyes again. Every day at this time, the baby would kick her awake and wake her up to eat because the baby was hungry.

Ever since she had gotten pregnant, the baby had never let her sleep in for a day.

She moved her body and got up clumsily, but there was no movement from the person behind her. Perhaps his sleep had been disrupted the night before, so at that moment, he was still sleeping too soundly. He was even snoring faintly.

Jeanne carefully left the room. In order not to wake Edward up, she went to George’s room to wash up, and she slowly walked downstairs after washing up.

Just as she reached the stairs, she saw Edward suddenly coming up from the living room, his face visibly nervous. However, the moment he saw Jeanne, he paused.

Jeanne noticed his expression and frowned.

Was he not asleep just now? Why was he up but still in his pajamas? What happened?

At that moment, Edward’s expression slowly turn from panic to calm. He asked, “When did you wake up?”

“A while ago.” Jeanne replied indifferently, “I didn’t wake you up because I saw you were sound asleep.”

“Yeah.” Edward nodded his head.

He did not tell her that when he opened his eyes and saw that she was not in bed, he was so startled that he went downstairs to look for her, only to hear from Teddy that she had not gone downstairs. At that moment, he panicked. He thought that his forceful actions last night had hurt her and made her do something extreme. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In reality, if he had calmed down, he would have known that Jeanne would not do that. In that moment of worry, he thought of the worst-case scenario, but as expected, he was overthinking it.

“I’m going downstairs for breakfast,” Jeanne reminded Edward. After all, Edward was blocking her from going downstairs.

Edward snapped back to his senses and stepped aside.

The moment he stepped aside, and just as Jeanne was about to head down, Edward suddenly reached out and held her hand tightly in his

Jeanne resisted instinctively, but Edward held her even tighter. After that, Jeanne gave in as she had no way to resist Edward.

Alex was right. If not for Edward, she would have been dead.

Now, because of Edward, she could at least live for a few more months and let the baby in her belly be born safely; at the very least, she could save another life.

In fact, she did not have any resentment toward him.

Hence, she accepted it and walked down the stairs with Edward holding her hand. Even when they were in the living room, Edward still did not let go of her hand.

Teddy, who was in the living room, was shocked to see them come downstairs so intimately.

He did not know when it had started, but Fourth Master and Madam had become very distant from each other, and they would deliberately avoid each other’s presence. To be more precise, it was Madam who would deliberately avoid Fourth Master. If he thought about it carefully, it seemed to have started from the day Alex brought that woman called Susan with him. From then on, that woman had been standing between Fourth Master and Madam, showing off her power.

In fact, Teddy did not quite understand why Fourth Master suddenly wanted to be with Susan. Anyone with a discerning eye would tell that he was madly in love with Jeanne.
