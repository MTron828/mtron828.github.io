1057 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

She did not want to bandage it now, and anyway, she could no longer feel the pain. With that, she pushed Finn away and left.

However, Finn immediately pulled her back.

At that moment, Monica’s suppressed emotions finally erupted. The moment Finn touched her arm again, she suddenly pushed him away again hard.

Having been caught off guard, Finn took a step back.

“That’s enough,” Monica said to Finn. “I don’t need you to pity me, nor do I need you to sympathize with me! Keep your cool, keep your cold-blooded attitude, keep your silence, and don’t come near me!”

Finn’s eyes narrowed as he looked at Monica with a repulsive look. He seemed to have seen the marks on her neck that were mostly covered by her clothes.

Monica really did not want to talk to Finn. Since she had expressed it clearly to him, she turned around and left.

The moment she left, her body was shackled by Finn again.

This time, he was holding Monica with so much strength that she could not resist at all. Following that, Finn ripped her clothes off.

Her trench coat had no buttons, so it was easy to rip it off. On the other hand, the white shirt had many buttons ripped off.

Monica looked at Finn coldly and watched as the expression in his eyes constantly changed. It was a change in Finn’s mood that she had not seen in a long time.

He stared at the countless bloody bite marks on her body. They were densely packed and all over her fair skin.

His slender fingers even pulled her clothes apart, revealing the bite marks that were not just on her shoulders but on her chest.

Finn’s fingers stiffened.

His hostility was obvious.

“What happened?” Finn asked Monica.

He could not hide his emotions as he looked at her with his red eyes.

Was it the benevolence of a doctor? Was that why his humanity took over him when he saw her tragic body?

That was probably it. However, she did not care anymore, and she did not need anyone’s sympathy.

“I met a pervert,” she said.

“Who is it?”

“A business partner,” Monica said sarcastically.

The air around Finn turned colder.

“A woman’s greatest asset is her body.” Monica said indifferently, “If you can use your body to negotiate a deal, there’s no need to work so hard.”

Finn glared at Monica.

However, Monica did not look back at him. She could imagine how much Finn hated her and looked down on her now, but she did not care anymore.

After all, she had already parted ways with Finn.

She could not make up for all her past mistakes and could only satisfy Finn’s request.

Since he wanted her to stay away from him, the only thing she could do was to stay away from him and not disturb or disgust him.

They each had their own lives. No matter how difficult it was, they had to be on their own.

Finn remained silent for a long time and did not move because of what Monica said.

He probably did not expect her to have those injuries on her body because she was accompanying a guest and not because she was forced.

However, so what if she was forced?

She had never thought of implicating anyone.

If she had to die, she would die with Michael. It was not worth it for anyone else to die in Michael’s hands.

Monica then asked him, “Can you let me go now?”

At that moment, her exposed body made her feel a little uncomfortable. Even if she was not shy, those things were really not important to her anymore.

Finn continued to look at Monica for a long time, but he still let go of her eventually.

After letting go, he saw Monica tidying her clothes calmly. There was no other trace of emotion on her face.

Once she was done, she left.

“You clearly know that even if you sleep with them, it won’t help,” Finn said.

In the end, he still believed that she was selling her body.

Monica smiled faintly and said, “But at least I tried.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With that, Monica left.

Finn also returned to his office chair, but he could not continue writing the medical case that he was halfway through.

All he could think about was Monica’s body, which was filled with bloody bite marks.

He clenched his fists and continued to suppress his emotions.

After some time, Finn loosened his fingers and took out a document from the drawer.

He then picked up the phone and made a call.
