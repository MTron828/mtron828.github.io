Chapter 407: Fourth Master Swan Bullies George

However, she felt it was better to suffer now than later because time was the best medicine.

One day, Michael would let go completely and forget about her.

“You must take care of yourself,” Michael said.

Monica nodded.

“I’m leaving now.” Michael stood up from the stool beside her.

Monica nodded her head again.

With that, Michael left, his tall figure looking very lonely.

Monica really felt sorry for Michael, and deep down, she knew she owed him one.

However, she had to admit that after she explained everything clearly, she felt relieved.

That meant she really did not like Michael. Otherwise, other than feeling guilty, she would not feel like a huge weight had been lifted off her chest.

It was as if she had been reborn.

The corner of her mouth suddenly curled up into a smile.

From then on, only Finn would have her heart.

......

It was as if she had returned to the time when she was pursuing Finn and did not hide her feelings for him. Everyone knew that she liked him, and at the thought of his name, her heart would beat faster!

…

As soon as Michael left Monica’s ward, he no longer hid the rage from his face.

At that moment, he clenched his fists tightly.

There was no way Monica could dismiss him so easily, and he could not accept the breakup Monica wanted.

He only pretended to be magnanimous in front of Monica so that she would not dislike him.

However...

He smiled coldly.

He had a purpose for everything he did. Ever since he was young, he had never allowed himself to fail in anything, including his relationships.

In the past, when he was forced to break up with Monica, it was his own choice, so it was not considered a failure.

This time, he would not tolerate being rejected by Monica like that!

Just then, he stopped in his tracks. He was at the entrance of Finn’s intensive care unit.

As he looked coldly at the man lying inside, his mind wandered back to the man in the warehouse, who was beaten beyond recognition. Now, after a few days of treatment, the man seemed to have recovered.

He was really lucky.

.

As if he had felt a gaze on him, the man in the intensive care unit opened his eyes and turned his head, only to meet Michael’s gaze.

It was obvious they were hostile to each other, but the two of them did not say anything.

Michael flashed Finn a sinister smile before leaving the intensive care unit. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Finn did not take it to heart either and closed his eyes.

When he closed his eyes, he did not recall Michael’s sinister smile.

He knew very well that Michael was not that simple.

To be able to gain the favor of the Sanders, to be valued by the Sanders, and even to be nurtured by the Sanders, he definitely was not a simple man.

At that moment, all he could think about was… Michael came to visit Monica.

He pursed his lips, forcing himself not to overthink.

…

In the Swan family’s manor, Jeanne slept with Edward for a few more hours until she was so hungry that she finally got up to eat.

By then, it was already nighttime.

George had just eaten, so he was sitting on the sofa in the living room and watching TV with Teddy.

Even though George was not interested, he was still watching TV.

Then, he saw two people coming down from upstairs. The two people who abandoned him were back again.

Hmph!

George arrogantly ignored them.

Feeling helpless, Jeanne turned her head and glared at Edward, whose face was as calm as ever.

The two of them went to eat first. They were really afraid that if they did not eat anything soon, they would faint due to low blood sugar.

However, Jeanne ate a little quicker, and after eating, she walked straight toward George.

George, on the other hand, ignored Jeanne. The small boy was sitting on the sofa, visibly angry.

Jeanne did not know how to comfort his hurt little heart or say anything touching to her son. Hence, she found a topic to talk about. “How was the sports day?”

“Not great.” George’s expression was indifferent.

“I heard from your godmother that you won first for long-distance running.”

George did not reply to her.

“I definitely won’t miss it next time,” Jeanne promised.

George was unmoved.

“Actually, it wasn’t my fault.” Jeanne decided to shift the blame.

George glanced at Jeanne and then at calm Fourth Master Swan, who was sitting not far away from them after finishing his food. His young and tender voice sounded quite mature. “I know.”
