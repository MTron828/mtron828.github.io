Chapter 658: The Relationship Between Edward and Jeanne Started When She Was in the Womb!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

All he had were those cruel and bloody methods.

Therefore, when the Swans were about to leave Penelope’s memorial service, he said to the eight-year-old Eden, “Take good care of that little girl.”

He got someone else to take care of her to fulfill Penelope’s wish.

Ever since Eden was young, Eden had always been afraid of Edward, so he listened to everything Edward said.

Hence, he followed Edward’s request and took the initiative to get to know Jeanne.

Then, they fell in love.

Edward came back to his senses and said, “Find out how Alexander and Penelope got together back then.”

“Are you suspecting something?” Nox was shocked.

“As you said, I’m also surprised that Penelope got together with Alexander. According to my understanding of Penelope, she shouldn’t be interested in Alexander.”

“What you mean is that there’s a story behind this?”

“Just check it out.”

“Okay,” Nox agreed immediately.

“By the way, you and Jeanne...” Nox had to remind him again, “What exactly do you plan to do with her?”

“She’s my wife.” Edward enunciated each word clearly. “Nothing can separate us.”

“What if she wants to kill you?”

“She won’t.”

“Are you that confident?”

“Yes.” Edward was very certain.

With that, Nox shrugged helplessly.

He suddenly felt very fortunate that he did not have a woman he liked. Having sex with a woman was fine, but he was not interested in dating or anything of that sort.

On second thought, he really could not simply like anyone.

His life was more important.

…

In South Hampton City, Monica had been holding her phone the entire time.

Her mind was filled with Finn saying he would “kill her”. The more she thought about it, the more upset she felt.

Just then, her phone rang.

Monica looked at Michael’s call and picked it up while suppressing her emotions. “Michael.”

“It’s already been taken care of.” Michael said, “I’ve pulled some strings and removed all of our news. Now, as long as there are people spreading this news on the internet, all of them will be restricted. It should be taken down very soon.”

“I’m sorry to have troubled you!” Monica was a little touched.

“Silly, this matter started because of me, so it’s only natural for me to take care of it. Don’t even think about it.” Michael was always a hundred times gentler toward Monica.

Monica bit her lip.

She did not know what else she could say to Michael.

Everyone was suspicious of Michael. Jeannie kept reminding her to be on guard against him, but Michael would prove himself to her every time, and she really could not bring herself to doubt him.

However, she had no choice but to listen to Jeanne.

Even now, she felt a little guilty toward Michael.

Michael seemed to have also felt that Monica was deliberately keeping a distance from him. Hence, he hurriedly changed the topic. “Oh, right. Monica, I have a distant cousin who came back from studying abroad. He studied medicine, mainly in the field of research and development. However, he’s a recent graduate, and it seems like Cardellini Enterprise doesn’t accept new graduates directly into your company’s research team. I wonder if I can pull some strings for him. This child has been quite smart since he was young and has always wanted to enter your company’s research and development team. His parents have told me several times, but I didn’t say yes to them. Yesterday, they got my mother to tell me, and I really can’t stand it anymore.”

“Send me your cousin’s resume, and I’ll let my dad know. The research team has been preparing for a new recruit recently, so I’ll see if they can accommodate him.”

“Thank you,” Michael thanked her.

“It’s nothing, but don’t get your hopes up too high. My dad still has the final say in the company’s matters. That old man can be quite stubborn sometimes.”

“It’s fine. Just try your best. If it really doesn’t work out, I have a reason to reject them,” Michael said.

“Okay.”

“In that case, I’ll send you my cousin’s resume right away and leave you to it.”

“Okay.”

After hanging up, Monica immediately opened the news application on her phone and searched for the news this morning. As expected, they were all taken down. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She searched for related topics on the browser again, only to find that the topic had been taken down.

Michael was quite efficient.

She gritted her teeth and called Jeanne. “Jeannie, the news is gone.”

Jeanne had just walked into Lawrence Enterprise.

After leaving the Lawrence family’s manor, she went straight to work. It was about time she returned after two days of rest.

Moreover, Alexander was gone, and the company needed a new person in charge, and Joshua was not capable enough.

She sat in her office and beckoned for Amy to go out first as she picked up Monica’s call. “So your heart has softened?”
