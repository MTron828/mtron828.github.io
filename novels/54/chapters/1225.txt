1226 George Breaks Down

He just could not accept their separation!

Jeanne did not know how to answer George. How was she going to explain to him how unfair they were to him?

If only they had not met from the beginning, or even if they did meet but did not reunite, George would never have experienced the warmth of a normal family. Perhaps then, he would not have found it so difficult to accept.

Jeanne’s eyes reddened as she said, “I said I don’t love Edward anymore.”

She took all the blame on her. After all, Edward could be the one to accompany George for the rest of his life, and she did not want George to hate him.

She said, “Because Edward did not save Kingsley for me…”

She would not tell George that Edward had killed Kingsley with his own hands because George and Kingsley had a deep relationship.

She could understand Edward’s helplessness back then, but even if she could understand, she could not get over it. She knew that her happiness would be short-lived, so she forced herself to forget that Edward had killed Kingsley. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, George was still young, and he could not understand the many meanings of the adult world. His world was either right or wrong.

Therefore, she would choose a white lie so that George would never know the cause of Kingsley’s death.

She said, “That’s why I hate Edward.”

“If dad couldn’t save Kingsley, it must be because dad couldn’t save him.” George quickly put in a good word for Edward. “Kingsley was so important to you. If dad could’ve saved him, he definitely would’ve risked his life to save Kingsley!”

Jeanne looked at George.

Even George, who was so young, knew that Edward was really good to her and that he would do anything for her.

She said, “But Kingsley is still dead, and I can never let go. Whenever I see Edward, I will think of Kingsley. I won’t be happy with Edward.”

“You’re lying!” George did not believe it at all.

He was too smart and sensitive to believe Jeanne’s words.

“I’ve seen you smile. I’ve seen you smile at dad’s back, and that smile won’t lie. You love my dad very much! You love him, but why can’t you be more proactive? Why?” George questioned her.

“I told you. I can’t accept Kingsley’s death. I won’t be happy with Edward.”

“No. You just don’t want dad to be put in a difficult position, do you?” George asked her.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“I know. William Gates, that Leader, has been forcing dad to do things that dad doesn’t want to do. He’s the one who made Susan Gates marry dad!” George could not control his emotions.

Jeanne did not expect her son to know everything.

“I know that dad can’t reject him because he has a lot of power and that dad has to do whatever he says. However, can you work hard and persevere with dad and stay by his side? Don’t give in so quickly. Don’t give up on my dad so quickly, okay? It’s not easy for him to love you. He really does shoulder everything. Do you know? The last time he sent me to that damned place, he cried when I left. He thought I didn’t see it, but I saw it very clearly. His eyes were red as he watched me being taken away by a stranger.” George cried as he spoke.

He seemed to be recalling that scene.

“That’s why I want to leave that place. It’s not just because it’s cruel, but because I know my dad doesn’t want me to go and suffer either. However, he had no choice. He told me that he had no choice, so I could only come to you to express how sad I was and the pain I felt. I wanted you to tell dad not to let me go to that place because I always felt that dad would do anything for you. As long as you said it, dad would agree to your request no matter what. However, you’re not saying anything. In fact, you always choose to leave him the moment he compromises. You’ve never given him any support, and he has to bear everything alone. Why can’t you be with him and give him the strength to overcome difficulties? Why do you turn around and leave every time you get hurt?”

Jeanne was rendered speechless by a seven-year-old child.

She had once thought that George had a language barrier, but now, she probably did not have to worry about that.
