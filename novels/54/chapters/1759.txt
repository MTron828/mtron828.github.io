“Thank you for being pregnant for nine months and giving birth to our babies. Because of these two babies, she gained 20 pounds, and her waist increased a size, giving her love handles that I could hold her tighter with.”

As soon as he said that, everyone laughed. They thought that Finn would get emotional with his speech, but when they heard such a serious person like Finn joking about Monica, they were amused, to say the least.

Beside him, Monica’s face turned red with anger. She did not ask to gain weight, yet Finn had the nerve to make fun of her in front of everyone! When they got home, she would make sure Finn got the punishment he deserved.

While Monica was thinking about how to punish Finn, Finn continued, “Before I became a father, I had no idea that giving birth to a baby would change a woman so much. I always thought that giving birth was an experience that all women had to go through, so it was normal and nothing special. However, after becoming a father and seeing how hard it was for Monica to go through the changes in her body-”

“Whose fault is it that my body changed? Who was the one who forced me to eat all day? Finn, stop making sarcastic remarks here.” Monica could not take it anymore and retorted on stage in front of all the guests.

Finn chuckled, his eyes filled with affection. “Yes, I’m the reason she gained weight. However, that’s not the main point. The main point is that, besides gaining weight, Monica also had to go through labor, which was excruciatingly painful. Moreover, Monica had to give birth to two babies at once, and it was double the pain. It made me wonder how much a woman had to love a man to endure all this for him.”

Monica pouted. ‘Is Finn implying that I love him very much? What sc*mbag!

Why isn’t he thanking me for giving birth to his children?’

“I’m sure everyone has heard of how torturing the recovery after labor can be.

Especially with breastfeeding… Women are made to feel like cows all day!”

When Finn finished his sentence, the crowd laughed again. He always found that adjective to be a good joke. However, Monica was so embarrassed that she wanted to dig a hole in the ground and hide.

“Anyway, what I want to say is…”

Finn suddenly turned to look at Monica, who also looked at Finn. Suddenly, she was made nervous by his gaze.

Her heart was racing as she heard Finn say, “Monica, I love you.”

She would get overwhelmed every time Finn said that to her, and it was no expectation this time. The hatred she had for Finn earlier instantly disappeared as her heart softened, and her eyes were a little teary.

“I feel very guilty that you had to go through so much and that I couldn’t bear some of it for you. But from now on, I will take good care of you, your family, and our baby. I will be a good husband, son-in-law, and father. If I don’t do good enough, I’m willing to learn.”

As he spoke, Finn put down the microphone. With the baby still in his arms, he kissed Monica on her forehead. He was so serious that Monica was at a loss as to what to do.

She did not expect Finn to say that to her. She thought Finn was just starting to open up a little with her and that he no longer kept things to himself, but when did he become so corny in front of so many people?

She said, “Finn, we will always be a family.”

A warm round of applause sounded in the hall Although it was not a very emotional scene, everyone seemed to be moved by their relationship with each other.

Back then, Finn and Monica had a conflict because Monica thought that Finn did not love her enough. However, Finn did not show his love for Monica because he did not know how to express it. That was why he said, “If I don’t do good enough, I’m willing to learn.”

On the other hand, the reason why Finn broke up with Monica back then was because Finn felt that Monica did not trust him enough and would never listen to his opinions. That was why Monica used the phrase, “We will always be a family”, to tell Finn that they were a family now and that there was absolute

trust between family members- Not many people present understood the meaning of these two sentences, but Jeanne did.

She came with Edward. As Edward was a little busy, they arrived at noon and happened to see Monica and Finn walking onto the stage..
