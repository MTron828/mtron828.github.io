904 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

“Shut up!” The guard was cold and indifferent. “We are under orders to investigate everyone and ensure your safety! Please cooperate!”

“So what if you say we’re suspects? Do you think you can search me just because you say so? I won’t let you do that! At most, you can arrest me. I’ll allow you to do that!” A man resisted. He seemed to have reached the limit of his tolerance for being suddenly shackled in that place. “But before you arrest me, I want to see my lawyer! If I’m not suspected of anything, I’ll definitely sue you and expose your crimes!”

The guard’s expression was cold.

The man said again, “I refuse to believe that the Sanders can hide the truth from the public. What right does the Sanders have to ignore our human rights and do whatever they want? The Sanders’ actions today have infuriated the public! I won’t accept this!”

The guard was a little lacking in confidence after hearing the words of the man in front of him as he was also afraid that it would really affect the Sanders’ image. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Harken was a democratic country governed by law. In the name of the people, what they were doing now was indeed illegal and forceful!

“If you don’t give me an explanation, I won’t let you search me!” The man was determined.

The guards’ search was obstructed here. If they skipped that person, the others would definitely refuse for the same reason, and the search on the scene could be declared over. However, if they used force on that person, all of them were people of status. They were not people that the Sanders could offend just because they ruled Harken. Once the Sanders offended them, not only would it damage the Sanders’ image, but if someone turned against the Sanders’ power, everyone here would also immediately support that someone. If the Sanders lost the trust of some of the top people in Harken, they would not be able to rule over Harken for long.

The scene was in a deadlock.

At that moment, the guard who was searching for Finn also came back and reported, “We found that he drove into the wedding venue with her at 10:12 a.m. in the morning, but we didn’t see him half an hour after he entered. We’ve also checked and found out that the place he just mentioned is the blind spot for the surveillance camera. We can’t monitor it, so we can’t guarantee that he wasn’t there the whole time!”

After listening to the report, the guard who was searching for Finn said bluntly, “We can’t monitor your tracks on the surveillance cameras, so we can’t rule you out as a suspect. Please leave!”

“No!” Sarah grabbed Finn and stopped them from taking him away.

Finn knew very well that once he was taken away…

Regardless of whether the other party had evidence or not, he would be charged with many crimes and have no choice but to be punished by the Sanders’ laws.

He was indeed very suspicious.

Furthermore, he was one of Edward’s men. The Sanders must have long wanted to go against the Swans, so it could not be better to make an example out of him.

He said, “You want to arrest me because the camera is in a blind spot and you can’t see if I was there the whole time?! Do the Sanders’ have that much power?”

Finn was deliberately agreeing with the man just now.

The guard looked at Finn coldly.

Finn raised his voice. “Isn’t that so? As long as the Sanders think that someone is suspicious, they don’t need to have a criminal motive or evidence to prove it. As long as they are in the mood, they can lock anyone in prison or even execute them.”

Finn deliberately spoke of the situation to the extreme.

“Since that’s the case, I think there’s no need for you to search us. Just bring all of us back, and the Sanders can deal with us however they want. There’s no need to make such an unnecessary move!”

“What nonsense are you spouting!” The guard rebuked, “We’re only investigating, and we won’t let go of any suspicious person! Since you’re here without any invitation, you’re very suspicious! We’re doing this to protect the country and the people, and the Sanders are doing this to create a more peaceful society. Moreover, aren’t you rejecting our inspection because you have a guilty conscience? It’ll only make you even more suspicious!”

“I’m just defending my human rights as a citizen of Harken! I’ve already explained that I’m here to attend my ex-wife’s wedding so that I can give up on her completely. I’ve already explained it clearly, but you insist that I’m suspicious. Am I the suspicious one, or are you using the Sanders’ power to do whatever you want?” Finn sneered.
