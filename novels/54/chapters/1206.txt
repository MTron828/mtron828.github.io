1207 Reuniting After A Long Time

At five months, he could already clearly feel the baby. Edward seemed so surprised that he kept rubbing her belly with his hand.

The baby was very cooperative. From time to time, she would kick his hand as if she was communicating with him.

In the quiet night…

A phone suddenly rang.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly. He reluctantly lifted his hand off Jeanne’s abdomen and picked up the phone. “I’ll come down immediately.”

Jeanne accidentally saw his phone screen.

It was not Alex’s name but a person called Susan Gates.

Edward put down the phone and said, “I have to go.”

“When will you be done with work?” Jeanne asked.

She, too, knew that she could not keep him, just like that time when Alex had come to take Edward away.

In fact, she did not have much to say about it.

“Once William Gates becomes the new Leader, I probably won’t be so busy anymore.”

“George has sports day next week.” Jeanne felt that she had to tell him the important things immediately while she still had him. “If it’s possible, go with him.”

“I’ll try my best,” Edward agreed.

“Take care of your body.”

“You, too,” Edward said.

As he spoke, he could not help but plant a light kiss on her lips. Then, he left after the kiss.

The door was closed.

They had not met for two months, yet they had to say goodbye ten minutes after they were reunited.

Now, they would be separated for supposedly a week or even another month.

However, a week later, Alex took the stage and became the new leader of Harken, which meant that they had even more things to deal with next.

On one hand, they had to quell the unrest, but on the other hand, they also had to sort out all the internal affairs and conduct interviews on state affairs.

Anyway, Jeanne watched the news daily, and news about Alex was lined up back to back.

It made her think that he might only sleep for a few hours a day, and beside him, Edward’s figure was seen in a lot of pictures.

In other words, Alex was so busy that he had no time to sleep every day, and the same applied to Edward.

After reading the news, Jeanne went to read the tabloid. Her daily life’s joy was searching for new things in the news.

She found a comfortable position and started reading the news.

Just as she opened the app, her eyes paused.

She felt like she had seen the name ‘Susan Gates’ somewhere before, and the name felt inexplicably familiar to her. However, she was sure that she had never seen the woman in the photo on the news before.

Since she was bored anyway, she clicked on it and read the gossip about that person.

Susan Gates was a 28-year-old model and had worked in the film and television industry for three years. She had won the best supporting actress award before, but at the peak of her career, she suddenly retired.

It was rumored that she came from a prominent family and was only in the entertainment industry to satisfy her own interests. Now that she had left the entertainment industry, she was going back to inherit her family’s business.

The reason why she was on the entertainment news today was that a reporter had taken a picture of her on the street.

She was completely different from the Susan Gates in the entertainment industry. Dressed in a black suit, and with her short black hair tied into a ponytail, she looked clean and neat. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

There were a total of three photos in the news, and they were all street photos. Each of them had different expressions and different actions.

One was a picture of a car, and a man was respectfully opening the car door for her to get in

Jeanne zoomed in on the photo.

In fact, it was very blurry after she zoomed in. However, from the blurry photo, she could see a man sitting in the car, and it was Edward.

Although she could not see his face clearly, she could recognize him instantly.

Jeanne seemed to suddenly recall why she found that woman’s name familiar. The last time Edward came back in a hurry, Susan Gates was the one who called him.

With that, Jeanne exited the news app and began to search for the Gates on the internet.

The introduction of the Gates in the Encyclopedia was very general. It only said that they were a mysterious family in the antique business, but there were not many details about them.

Jeanne then accidentally stumbled upon a post of a photo of the Gates on the forum.

It was a family portrait, and the title was “The Gates’ Good Looks”.

No one had paid attention to that forum. Perhaps they thought that someone on the internet had photoshopped a few photos online to garner people’s attention. However, Jeanne saw it.

It turned out that Susan Gates was William Gates’s younger sister.

Everyone inside knew that William Gates was Alex, and Alex had taken the position of Leader. However, because Alex had always used William Gates’ identity, in the eyes of the public, the person who had gotten the position of the Leader of Harken was William Gates.

That made Susan Gates a relative of the royal family, and her having a connection with Edward… seemed to be a matter of course.

As soon as Jeanne put down her phone, the baby in her stomach kicked her twice. She was now seven months pregnant, and the kick hurt a lot.

Jeanne stood up, thinking it was probably because of her lying position that upset the baby.

Then, she walked down the stairs slowly.

Teddy was still at home, happily doing some chores. Seeing her leave, he hurriedly called out to her, “Madam.”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

She was going to take a stroll in the back garden.

...

Finn said that if she wanted to use the method of natural childbirth, it was best to walk more.

In fact, she wanted to give birth naturally because if she did not, she did not know whether Bamboo Garden was well-equipped enough for her to do a cesarean section in.

She was walking in the back garden.

The sun was shining brightly, so Jeanne strolled around a few times. After that, she returned to the main hall.

When she entered the hall, her expression suddenly froze because… she saw that Edward was back.

He was on the news just a moment ago, but now he was here.

However, Edward was not the only one back as Alex was there too.

Due to Alex’s arrival, many more people in black suits were in the house. At that moment, they were all standing there respectfully.
