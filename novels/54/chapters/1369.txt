1370 I Love You More Than You Think

She even left very enthusiastically.

After they left, it was quiet outside and inside. It was so quiet that Candice felt like crawling into a hole in the ground when she heard Teddy and Paige’s childish conversation.

Giving her a younger sister…

Candice bit her lip. For the first time, she thought that the suggestion was not bad.

As she lay in Edward’s embrace, her face was completely red.

“Growl…”

Suddenly, someone’s stomach began to growl.

Candice’s face turned even reader, and she looked up awkwardly to see the smile on Edward’s gentle face, which was filled with affection.

If she had not interacted with the man, it was really hard to imagine that he, in private, would be as warm as the sun. It was completely different from the temperament and aura he gave off.

She even had a feeling that he had given all his warmth to the most important person in his life and did not hold back. That was why he was so cold and indifferent to outsiders.

“Are you hungry?” Edward asked her.

That was right. Her stomach was growling. She was still a little hungry as she had not eaten much yesterday.

It was not that she did not have time to eat, but she just did not have much of an appetite.

She did not know if it was excitement or... She could not figure it out either. After all, the wedding yesterday did not bring her much anticipation. However, what happened yesterday was something she would never forget.

After all, it meant that she had one more person in her life from now on, and perhaps it was the man who would be with her for the rest of her life.

She bit her lip lightly and did not speak.

Edward did not make her feel awkward. Instead, he let go of her body reluctantly.

He said, “I’ll find you something to eat.”

“No need.” Candice pulled him back.

Edward looked at her.

“Let’s get up together.”

She did not want others to think that she was lying in bed on the first day and letting others serve her. Thinking back to the conversation between Teddy and Paige just now, she felt that it would be very awkward.

“Are you sure?” Edward asked and looked at her strangely.

Candice frowned and nodded. As such, Edward did not refuse.

He got up and picked up the bathrobes, which they had thrown on the floor last night because they went crazy. He put it on himself first and then on Candice.

Although he was behaving sincerely, she was still shy by his actions.

Once they had put on their clothes, Edward went down first. After that, Candice lifted the blanket and got off the bed.

Just as her feet touched the floor, Candice’s body went limp, and she fell to the ground without any warning.

It was embarrassing, but what was even more embarrassing was… her legs were so weak that she had no strength left. Last night was clearly too much for her.

However, it was in that awkward situation that she heard someone’s uncontrollable laughter, mocking her.

Her face was flushed red with embarrassment, but she was exasperated.

She looked up at Edward, looking at him looking down at her from above. He seemed to be in a good mood as he watched her fall to the ground.

He said, “I told you to lie down and I’ll do it.”

Candice glared at him, looking displeased.

“Oh, don’t misunderstand. I didn’t mean last night,” Edward hurriedly explained.

It would be best if he had not explained himself, because the moment he did that…

Did he want her to live at all? She really did not dare to think about last night.

Edward looked at Candice’s expression, and the smile in his eyes became even more obvious.

Then, he bent down, picked Candice up from the floor, and placed her back on the soft bed.

Candice could not understand. They were all humans, and although he had it harder last night, why did they wake up the next day feeling different?

Why did she wish she was dead while he was full of energy?

After Edward placed Candice on the bed, he left the room for a while and brought back a bowl of eggs on toast.

The fragrant smell of the eggs gave her more of an appetite. She even felt that at that moment, her mouth was watering. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She gulped and watched as Edward sat in front of her with the plate of eggs on toast.

He asked, “Do you like toast?”

Candice nodded. She really loved South Hampton City’s eggs on toast. In the month that she had returned from overseas, she would have it from time to time.

However, Edward seemed to have known about that fact long ago.

He picked up the toast for her and placed it by her mouth.

“I can do it myself.” Candice was still a little embarrassed.
