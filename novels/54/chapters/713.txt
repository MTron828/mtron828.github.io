Chapter 714: Frighten, Edward’s Return

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Swan Enterprise has monopolized 60 percent of that industry’s market share in Harken. No matter what we do, it’ll be difficult for us to compete with them.”

“That’ll just be a side business of ours. There’s no need to compete with Swan Enterprise, and of course, there is no way we can compete with them. My idea is to invest in the shops.” Jeanne said, “As Vice President Swan said just now, the rental fees for our shops are very high. So, rather than paying the high rental fee every year, it would be better for us to invest in them all at once. We will purchase the shops ourselves and then hire other people to manage it. In fact, it’s similar to the way we operate the stores. The only thing different is that the store will be under our company instead of the retail agent.

“Firstly, the house prices in Harken are rising every year. According to the current trend, investing in the real estate market for the next 20 years will not result in a loss. Secondly, it prevents the retail agents from taking away our resources once they stop endorsing our products. After all, the stores have their own customers. Once the stores cease to exist, it’s very likely that we will lose those customers. However, if the stores are ours, we will still have customers, no matter if the agents change. Lastly, this is currently the most effective way to solve the problem of the physical stores face with rent costs. It’ll allow Lawrence Enterprise to truly develop our business in various industries.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After that, Jeanne did not hesitate to face all the senior management and said, “Everyone, if you have anything to say about the plan I just mentioned, please feel free to bring it up.”

However, all the senior management agreed with her plan.

Jeanne specially asked Eden, “Vice President Swan, you’re the executive vice president whom Lawrence Enterprise specially hired, and the chairman has high expectations for you. Do you have any suggestions on this?”

Eden knew that Jeanne was deliberately giving him a hard time.

When Jeanne first took over the position of Lawrence Enterprise’s president, Joshua wanted Eden to join Lawrence Enterprise because he did not trust Jeanne. Yet now, Jeanne was showing everyone that he, Eden, was at Lawrence Enterprise just for show and that she could manage Lawrence Enterprise all on her own.

“President Lawrence, your plan is very good and informative. Until I’m entirely familiar with your plan, I don’t have any opinions on it for the time being.” Eden said it in a dignified manner, so as to not embarrass himself.

Of course, Jeanne would not waste time bickering with Eden on that matter. She said, “Since that’s the case, I’ll start to divide the work among the various departments. The first is the sales department. They will be mainly responsible for–”

“President Lawrence!” The door to the meeting room was suddenly pushed open.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

The employee who pushed open the door was visibly nervous. He said, “Someone is on the top floor of our building and wants to jump off the ledge.”

Jeanne’s expression changed. Almost in an instant, she turned her eyes to look at Eden and caught sight of the malicious look that flashed across his face.

After realizing that Jeanne saw him, his expression immediately returned to normal.

He was also a little worried as he did not expect Jeanne would be able to know that he was secretly manipulating the situation upon learning of it.

However, he told himself to remain calm.

Jeanne did not waste any more time either. “Let’s go and take a look at the situation.”

All the senior management in the meeting room left the scene and went straight to the top floor.

On the rooftop stood a middle-aged man.

Jeanne recognized him at a glance. He was the general agent of the South Harken region, Greg Norton.

She immediately approached him.

“Don’t come over!” Greg looked very agitated.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. “Mr. Norton, if I remember correctly, you gave me a week. However, it has only been four days. Who are you doing this for?”

“Don’t think we don’t know that was a perfunctory answer. You just had someone threaten Rick two days ago, and yesterday, someone came to trash our stores. They broke everything in my store and have caused me to lose millions of dollars. The person who took the lead even threatened me to not cause any trouble, or it wouldn’t be as simple as breaking things next time!” Greg was still pretty agitated. “Jeanne, your methods are really despicable! Rick’s accusation of you sent you to the police station, yet you managed to get out of it. I know you’re now in a position of power and no one dares to touch you. However, I can only kill myself to make the police have no choice but to launch an in-depth investigation on you! Karma will get back at you!”

As he said that, Greg was about to jump down.

Everyone at the scene was shocked.

At that moment, a lot of reporters were already crowding downstairs of Lawrence Enterprise, and Lawrence Enterprise was trending again.

“Wait!” Jeanne called out to Greg.

Greg endured for a moment and turned around to look at her.

“I didn’t send someone to destroy your store, nor did I say I wouldn’t solve your problems. We were discussing internally just now about a marketing transformation for the physical stores that would be beneficial to you. If you jump off that ledge now, you will definitely regret it for the rest of your life.”
