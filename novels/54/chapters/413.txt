Chapter 414: Fourth Master Swan Is Jealous

Jeanne looked at Alexander coldly.

The others were also very displeased with Jeanne. They pointed at her and said, “Let’s not talk about who’s responsible for the failure of this project we invested in. However, at least when Lawrence Enterprise is in trouble, isn’t it natural for the Lawrences to help?”

“That’s right. She has so much money, yet she’s too stingy to help. It’s really impressive.”

“Actually, I’ve known for a long time that although Jeanne is capable, she turns her back on people. She won’t even help her own family.”

In the senior management meeting room, all of them were accusing Jeanne.

It was as if her actions were treasonous.

“So, is everyone saying that since the e-commerce project is losing money, I should fork out my own money to cover the losses?” Jeanne’s eyes shifted. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You don’t have to.” Michelle, the director of the human resources department, said, “Just as you said, the company should bear the responsibility for the losses of the project and not blame it on a single person. But from a humanistic point of view, if you have that ability to help when Lawrence Enterprise is in trouble, why not?”

“Director Williams, are you implying that if this project earns money, the profits should all be given to me?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Everyone was stunned and did not know how to answer Jeanne’s question for a moment.

Jeanne looked at Alexander. “General manager, is that what you mean?”

Alexander’s expression changed slightly.

“Do you mean I’ll take all the project’s profits and income since the losses are on me?” Jeanne was certain.

......

“Jeanne, don’t push your luck! Our company took out money to invest in the project. Aren’t you a little shameless to think you’ll receive all the profits?!” Alexander was infuriated.

“In that case, aren’t you shameless for making me cover the losses, general manager?”

“Jeanne!” Alexander was so angry that his body was trembling. “To you, that is just a small sum of money!”

“Do you think that because I have money, I should take it out and use it as I please? If so, according to your logic, those rich people who worked hard to get to where they are now should take out their money and give it to the poor when the poor ask for it. Rich people should work hard, but the poor people can get something for nothing!”

“Jeanne, stop changing the concept here!”

“I’m just telling you how childish and idiotic your ideas are!”

“Jeanne!”

“At a time like this, instead of thinking about how to turn the project into a profit, you’re thinking about how to make people compensate for that loss? I admit I do have money. Not to mention 2 billion, I can even cover 20 billion dollars if need be. However, why would I spend money on such a thing? Why don’t I think about how to make this project profitable?” Jeanne stared straight at Alexander. “Do you know why Lawrence Enterprise’s business is worsening?”

Alexander was a little dumbfounded by Jeanne’s words.

He looked at her fiercely as she said, enunciating each word, “Because there’s a group of leaders like you!”

“Jeanne, that’s enough!” Alexander was furious.

“The biggest failure of Lawrence Enterprise is the general manager!” Jeanne faced him directly.

Alexander was so angry that his body was trembling.

At a senior management meeting like that, Jeanne really was not showing him respect at all!

“It’s been so long, yet why hasn’t there been any progress in changes of the senior management roles, and everyone is still in their original positions? Don’t you think your work ability and efficiency are questionable?” Jeanne’s aura was getting more and more imposing.

At that moment, even Alexander was a little speechless.

“Regarding the e-commerce project, I will continue to follow up and find a solution for it. As for the so-called loss...” Jeanne paused for a moment.

Everyone was looking at her as if attracted by her aura.

“The losses of the company have to be borne by the company. That’s a must! Of course, I don’t deny that I do have the ability to help the company, but having the ability doesn’t mean I must help them. To put it bluntly, if I want to contribute to the company, it’ll only be because I want to. It’s not because everyone thinks I have the money or because I’m part of the Lawrence. This is just moral coercion, and I have never been threatened! Moreover, even if I don’t contribute, all of you here can’t do anything to me!” Jeanne said coldly, “So, don’t think you’re superior to me and tell me what I should do. You have no right to demand of me!”
