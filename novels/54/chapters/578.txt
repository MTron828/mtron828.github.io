Chapter 579: Don’t Show Up in Front of Me, I Think You’re Disgusting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In that case, she would try her best to serve him well.

The woman walked straight into Finn’s room.

Monica kept looking at Finn’s room, thinking that what she was seeing now was an illusion because Finn would not do that.

He would not do that with another woman so soon…

“You’re at the wrong place.” Finn’s harsh words pulled Monica back from her thoughts.

Monica snapped back to her senses and blurted out, “Who is she?”

“What does it have to do with you?”

“Finn, did you get a woman to come back and spend the night with you?”

“What does it have to do with you?”

“Are you that impatient? Are you feeling better? The doctor said you can only have sex after at least three months. How can you do this?” Monica’s eyes were a little red.

At that moment, her heart hurt.

When she saw that woman walk straight into Finn’s room, she wished she could strangle that woman to death.

“What does it have to do with you?” Finn repeated the sentence but more seriously this time.

“We... We aren’t...”

“Aren’t we divorced?” Finn reminded her. “So, Ms. Cardellini, you’d better know your identity.”

Ms. Cardellini?

Monica stared at Finn.

Not wanting to waste his breath on her anymore, he closed the door.

Monica did not know whether she was angry or anxious, but she reached out her hand and stopped the door from closing with her finger.

It hurt so much, and the sharp pain made Monica’s finger numb.

She was in so much pain that tears were streaming down her face.

However, Finn acted indifferently.

She looked coldly at Monica’s fingers, on which the door had left a dark mark.

He knew he had closed the door quite hard just now, so he looked at Monica silently.

Monica said, “Finn, can you not be so indifferent?”

“What right do you have to ask me to do that?”

“I know Michael and me–”

“That’s your business. You don’t have to explain it to me.”

“Finn, what do you want?” Monica was so angry that her heart was aching.

Finn was scarily cold to her, and his indifference made her afraid.

“Get lost.” Those two words expressed all of Finn’s feelings toward Monica.

Monica looked at him in a daze, not expecting Finn to say such things to her.

Then, she gritted her teeth. “I came back to collect my things!”

“I’ve thrown them away.”

Monica widened her eyes in disbelief.

“I threw them away a week ago. I told you I would only give you one day to collect your things. Since you didn’t, I threw them away,” Finn said straightforwardly.

“Why did you throw away my things without my permission?” Monica roared angrily.

“To me, they’re all trash.”

“Finn–”

“If there’s nothing else, Ms. Cardellini, please leave,” Finn ordered her to leave once again.

“Do you really want to chase me away?” Monica’s body was trembling from the anger brewing in her.

“Ms. Cardellini, please don’t show up at this house ever again.”

Monica’s eyes reddened, and her tears began to fall.

To be honest, Finn did not think Monica’s tears were worth anything.

He rudely pushed away Monica’s hand that was blocking the door and closed the door on her.

However, Monica suddenly resisted, trapping her body between the cracks of the door.

Finn’s eyes narrowed, and his expression darkened.

“Why are you in such a hurry to chase me away? Is it because you want to sleep with the woman inside?” Monica asked him angrily, on the verge of breaking down.

Finn replied coldly, “Yes.”

Suddenly, Monica felt as if her heart had been stabbed by a knife.

“Do you know your body’s condition? The doctor said you must wait at least three months!”

“I’m a doctor. I know my body very well.”

“You’re not allowed. Finn, you’re not allowed to have sex with other women. I don’t allow you to...”

“That’s my business. It has nothing to do with you!” Finn interrupted Monica.

His attitude towards her was frighteningly cold. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll sleep with you! If you want to have sex, I’ll do it with you!” Monica said in agitation.

At that moment, she was so agitated that she started to take off her clothes.

She said, “If you want to have sex, I can do it with you. Just don’t have sex with a random woman. Don’t– Ah!”

Monica screamed because Finn suddenly pushed her to the ground.

Her crutches were unstable in the first place, and on top of her taking off her clothes, she was struggling with balancing. Hence, as Finn shoved her away, she was thrown out of the door.

Monica looked at Finn, acting all cold and condescending.

“Monica, don’t make me sick,” Finn said with a heavy tone.

Monica felt humiliated by Finn’s gaze as she knew that Finn looked down on her.

She bit her lips and glared at Finn, her tears falling like crazy.

“Don’t show up in front of me again,” Finn said coldly. “I think you’re disgusting.”

Monica stared at the door, watching it slam shut.

How could Finn be so bad and say that about her?

She was just angry when Nox mocked her — the kind of anger that made her want to fight Nox…

However, having been criticized by Finn, she felt terrible, and her heart really hurt!
