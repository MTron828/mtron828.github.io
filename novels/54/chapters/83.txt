Chapter 84: At Least They Were in Love

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s because first come, first served.” Jeanne held onto Edward’s arm and smiled sweetly.

To Melody, she was deliberately showing off.

After all, Melody was born with a noble status and had a sense of superiority from a young age. How could she endure such grievances? Initially, she was feeling bad about being rejected by Edward. Now, she suffered a blow by Jeanne, who did not have any status. The anger that Melody had suppressed burst out in an instant. Her voice was very loud. “First come, first served? Do you know that I’ve liked Edward for many years?! When I was 10 years old, I followed my father to the Swans. When I saw him for the first time, I already liked him!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Ms. Sanders, a one-sided liking isn’t love. It is just an unrequited love.” As Jeanne said that, she raised her head and smiled at Edward. “Isn’t that right?”

Edward looked at Jeanne in the same way.

Jeanne’s intentions were very clear.

If she offended the Sanders, she would at least have to drag someone down with her.

The corners of Edward’s mouth curled up slightly. He said in an attractive voice, “Yes.”

Jeanne’s smile was very bright.

Melody watched the interaction between them just like that.

She had never seen Edward pamper anyone so much. She even felt that his gaze was as gentle as water. She had always thought that Edward was not good with words and did not speak or smile. He was a serious and cold person to anyone.

Melody bit her lip tightly and looked at them fiercely.

“Fourth Master, I’m so sleepy. I want to go back and sleep,” Jeanne said coquettishly.

“I’ll send you back.” Edward took Jeanne and left immediately.

He did not even look at Melody.

Melody looked at their intimate interaction, and her body was trembling.

She shouted, “Who exactly is Jeanne that you want to like her? Your nephew doesn’t even want her anymore, and yet you still want to pick up that abandoned shoe. Don’t you think that you’re ridiculous?”

Jeanne and Edward stopped in their tracks at the same time.

Edward turned his head, and his gaze was very cold.

Melody saw his gaze, and her heart froze.

She could not help but shiver.

Melody straightened her back and used her identity to maintain her arrogance.

“Ms. Sanders, I know clearly what kind of woman Jeanne is. But you? You’re worse than a broken shoe.”

“Edward!” Melody screamed in anger.

Edward brought Jeanne along and left without caring about her emotions.

Jeanne felt her scalp tingle when she heard the screams from the person behind her.

It was not that she sympathized with her. She was just guessing that she had gained another enemy, one that was not to be trifled with.

Jeanne and Edward walked into the nightclub.

She let go of Edward’s arm very naturally.

It was enough for her to act to this extent.

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

Jeanne did not mind.

She walked to the private room and was about to push the door open.

“Aren’t you sleepy?” Edward asked her.

Jeanne stopped pushing the door open.

“I’ll send you back first.”

“I drove. I can go back by myself.” If it was possible, she would leave first.

“I’ll send you.” Edward’s tone was firm.

“It’s Finn’s birthday today...”

“He has a birthday every year.”

“...”

“Let’s go.” Edward suddenly reached out and grabbed Jeanne’s hand.

He wrapped her hand completely in his palm. It seemed very natural.

Jeanne had always felt that Fourth Master Swan was cold. At this moment, the temperature in his palm made her heart palpitate.

Fourth Master Swan left with Jeanne.

Monica was still talking to Michael about the two of them.

She was filled with righteous indignation and told him not to randomly match a couple. Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne were a match made in heaven, and even the Sanders’ princess could not interfere!

Michael just looked at Monica like that.

Monica was not pretentious, hypocritical, or concealing. She was very simple. Although she did not look like a rich young lady, he was crazily in love with her.

He watched her speak excitedly as her rosy lips opened and closed…

“Hng.” Monica was stunned.

Michael suddenly kissed her.

He suddenly kissed her hard.

Monica stared at Michael in front of her with wide eyes.

She saw him being in deep affection.

Monica vaguely remembered when they were in love.

She vaguely remembered how her heart was moved at that time…

Dazed, she let Michael deeply kiss her.

After a long time, Michael let go of her.

Looking at her stunned look, he gently caressed her lips with his fingers.

He said in a hoarse voice, “Monica, let’s start again.”

Monica seemed to come back to her senses at this moment.

She came back to her senses and pushed Michael away.

Monica took a deep breath. “I’m married.”

“I know that you and Finn are in a marriage of convenience.” Michael looked at her affectionately. “So get a divorce. Let’s get married.”

Monica looked at Michael.

Michael said, enunciating each word, “Let’s get married.”

“Why did we break up back then?” Monica asked him sarcastically.

“I admit that I was too weak back then and was forced to leave by my parents. Now that I’m back, I’ll never compromise again.”

“So you mean that if your parents don’t agree with us being together, you’ll break up with them?”

“I can,” Michael promised.

“But I don’t want it,” Monica refused.

Michael’s expression changed slightly.

“There’s nothing to look forward to in a marriage that isn’t blessed,” Monica said, “I was born into a very warm family. I know how important the warmth of a family is. Let’s not talk about love being paramount. Once love violates family love, I don’t think love will become great. It’ll only become selfish.”

Michael looked at Monica.

Monica looked carefree and heartless.

In fact, she had her principles.

She also had things that she insisted on, things that were not to be violated.

“Michael, that’s it.” Monica turned around.

She did not want to drag things out any longer.

Monica did not want to go back and experience the feeling of being forced to break up again.

“If I can get my parents’ approval and they accept you, will you marry me?” Michael suddenly asked her loudly.

Monica stopped in her tracks.

“Monica.” Michael went forward and hugged her in his arms.

She resisted.

Michael hugged her even tighter as if he was afraid of losing her. “Give me some time. I’ll deal with my family’s matters.”

Monica’s heart was beating slightly.

“Give me some time. I’ll definitely take care of it.”

“How long?” Monica was a little sarcastic. “One year, two years, three years, five years…?”

“Three months.” Michael was firm.

Monica’s heart moved.

“If I don’t take care of my family’s matters within three months, I won’t bother you anymore. If I do, you’ll marry me.” Michael buried his head in Monica’s neck. “Okay?”

His tone was pleading.

In fact, Michael was born noble, and he was superior to everyone else. Only to her, he was always very careful and pampered her.

Monica was probably moved like that in the past.

At this moment...

It seemed that she could not refuse him.

Monica admitted that she was actually very happy during that period with Michael.

She admitted that during that period, she forgot Finn very quickly.

“Okay.” Monica agreed.

At least with Michael, they were in love.

As for Finn, it was just a one-sided love.
