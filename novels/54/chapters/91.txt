Chapter 92: A Small Victory

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At a luxurious presidential room of a high-class hotel.

In the living room, Cameron Hall handed a copy of the proposal to West and left a copy for himself.

He said, “MUK Group has always been one of the best in the e-commerce world. How can they operate MUK Group better than us? Once we reach an agreement, all the operations of e-commerce will be under your control. These are my thoughts about the cooperation. Next, I want to briefly explain my understanding of e-commerce. In my opinion, the development of e-commerce is a convenient way to satisfy people’s daily needs. How to utilize this convenience to the max and how to let users have a better experience would be the key to e-commerce’s existence. I personally think…”

Jeanne Lawrence listened quietly. Cameron made perfect sense.

Other than different wording and logical order of ideas, it was probably the same as her proposal.

Jeanne remained calm.

Cameron continued, “…Finally, this is my investment in this collaboration. According to our estimations, my investment for this project is approximately 2 billion. Here’s the list of investments. Mr. West, you can take a look. Also, to express my sincerity, I will increase my investment by 5%. I think MUK Group will need a lot of public relations in Harken. This investment amount is for Mr. West to expand the market in Harken.”

West listened to Cameron Hall’s proposal and glanced at Jeanne.

Her eyes were filled with satisfaction at the proposal.

West probably did not expect that such a small enterprise with no notable achievements would have such an amazing proposal. Other than being surprised, he also felt regretful. He regretted missing out on such a perfect proposal. After all, Jeanne Lawrence would definitely be the final partner.

Jeanne ignored West’s gaze and said to Cameron Hall, “I’m really surprised by your company’s proposal! I never thought that one day I would be so aligned with a company’s proposal.”

Cameron Hall pretended that he did not understand and said exaggeratedly, “You mean our proposal is the same? How can there be such a coincidence?”

“It’s true.” Jeanne pulled out her proposal manuscript and handed it to West. She also handed a copy to Cameron Hall.

Both of them took a quick glance.

West only needed one glance to understand that the original proposal was done by Jeanne Lawrence and that someone had “stolen” it.

He pretended not to know anything and said, “They do look similar. If it wasn’t because two of you had given it to me separately, I would have thought that the proposals came from the same person.”

“Actually, it’s my first time meeting Mr. Hall today.”

“Great minds think alike.” Cameron Hall smiled and said, “Does that mean our proposal’s well done?”

“It is indeed a solid proposal,” West affirmed. “This is the most satisfactory proposal I have received so far. I don’t think there will be a better proposal than this.”

“So, will Mr. West choose one of our proposals?” Cameron Hall asked hurriedly.

“Mr. Hall, aren’t you curious how our proposals are so similar?” Jeanne interrupted suddenly.

Cameron was stunned. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, he said calmly, “Just as Ms. Lawrence said, we had no prior interactions. I don’t have any doubts. It’s impossible that such a big company like the Lawrence Enterprise had copied the documents of a small company like mine! On the other hand, an insignificant person like me doesn’t have the ability to get my hands on Lawrence Enterprise’s proposal.”

Eden Swan had already gone through all the events that might occur prior to the meeting, so Cameron could answer with ease.

He had to admit that he really admired Eden.

For Eden to be able to think of such a thorough plan at his age, he would definitely have great achievements in business in the future. This was also the reason why he fawned over Eden so much. Other than his family background, he was also different from others in terms of ability and ambition.

Jeanne looked at Cameron calmly. She knew that Cameron had prepared an excuse.

If she were to pursue the matter now, it would seem unreasonable and aggressive. After all, Cameron had made it clear that he was only the boss of a small company. How could he possibly get his hands on Lawrence Enterprise’s proposal? It was impossible.
