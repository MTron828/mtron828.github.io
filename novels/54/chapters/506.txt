Chapter 507: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction!!

“Why did you give her breast implants?” Monica was unhappy again.

“Are Patsy’s breasts small?” Monica asked.

Boy, they did not look small.

“There are many reasons.” Finn said, “I can’t tell you all of it now, but you have to believe me when I say there’s nothing between Patsy and me.”

“I also want to get breast implants,” Monica suddenly said.

Finn was speechless.

“Since Patsy can do it, I want it too!” Monica was very determined.

Finn found Monica a little overwhelming to deal with sometimes.

“Take a look and see how I can get breast implants too. See...” While Monica was speaking, she was anxiously trying to take off her clothes.

It put Finn in a bad mood.

“Monica, calm down.”

“I won’t. I want a breast augmentation. I want you to perform a breast augmentation surgery on me!” Monica refused to listen to him no matter what.

She took off her clothes and wanted Finn to see her breasts.

......

However, Finn grabbed onto Monica’s clothes tightly so that she wouldn’t be exposed.

When Monica could not break free, her eyes were red, and she felt upset. “Finn!”

“Stop seducing me, Monica!” Finn said in a hoarse voice.

Monica looked at Finn in a daze, watching the hidden desire in his eyes erupting bit by bit.

She had heard something about Finn telling her not to seduce him.

Could she seduce him?

He looked at her with bloodshot eyes and seemed to be enduring the pain.

She said, “Do you want me?”

Finn did not answer, but his gaze betrayed him.

“Do you really want me?” Monica asked.

Finn said, “Can’t you feel it?”

Could she not feel how tense his body was every night?

Monica really did think about it seriously, but she shook her head in the end, telling him she could not feel it.

Sometimes, Monica could piss Finn off so badly.

He said exasperatedly, “Monica, are you a blockhead? You’re so slow.”

Now, Monica was angry and unhappy with what Finn said. “That’s because you’re always vague about me, so of course, I don’t have confidence in myself.”

Finn took a deep breath. “Do you know now?”

“No,” Monica insisted.

Finn choked.

“Let me verify it.” A wicked smile suddenly appeared on Monica’s face. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Finn looked straight at her and felt her little hand.

Then, Monica smiled cunningly. “Okay. I believe you.”

Finn had a feeling that one day, Monica would kill him. However, he took a deep breath, quietly regulating his emotions and allowing his body to relax.

“Get me a glass of water,” Finn suddenly said.

At that moment, Monica was lying in Finn’s arms. She kept looking at her hand and palm…

“Monica!” Finn’s voice was so loud that it frightened Monica.

Why was the man throwing a tantrum?

She turned to look at him. “What’s wrong?”

“Are your hands that good-looking?” Finn was visibly in a bad mood.

He was suffering, yet she could still take it easy.

“Don’t you think they’re good-looking?” Monica deliberately showed her hands to Finn.

Disgust was written on Finn’s face.

“Finn, you’ll fall in love with it one day.” Monica smiled cunningly.

Finn rolled his eyes at Monica.

Sometimes, Monica could be too overconfident.

He said, “Get a glass of water for me.”

“Do you want to suppress the essence?” Monica smiled.

On the other hand, Finn glared at Monica.

Monica moved closer to Finn’s ear and whispered, “When I say ‘essence’, I mean...”

Finn’s face immediately turned red. He thought, ‘Monica is full of sh*t.’

When Monica saw Finn’s expression, she felt a sense of accomplishment. Hence, she got off the bed and poured Finn a glass of water.

“I want it cold,” Finn reminded her.

Monica limped to the fridge and found an ice cube.

After that, she handed the glass to Finn. “Here’s something to suppress the fire in you.”

Finn did not want to think about the hidden meaning in Monica’s words anymore and finished a glass of water in two or three gulps.

“Do you want more?”

“No.”

“Then... Let’s go back to sleep.”

“Stay away from me.” Finn rejected Monica’s approach.

Monica pursed her lips, feeling a little upset, and she looked as if she had suffered a grievance.

Finn looked at Monica and compromised. “You can come to bed, but you can’t come near me.”

With that, Monica quickly climbed into bed.
