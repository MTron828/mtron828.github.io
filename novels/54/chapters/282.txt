Chapter 283: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

After changing into a new SIM card, Jeanne did not take a taxi to leave.

For safety reasons, she went to the bus stop not far from the communications business hall and got on a bus.

She thought that Fourth Master Swan would not have guessed that she would take a bus to leave.

When she knew that she was leaving, she had planned her route.

The bus would not go straight to the airport, but it would go to an intersection leading to the airport.

After Jeanne got off at the bus stop, she would ask Miles to pick her up.

Then she would meet up with George and go to the airport together.

Speaking of which, she still felt a little guilty about George.

After the accident, she had been in Bamboo Garden with Fourth Master Swan, while George lived alone at the Lawrences’ villa.

If it were not for the fact that George was used to Jeanne not being by his side since he was a child, most six-year-old children would not be able to accept it.

Even if they could accept it, a mom would still feel guilty.

Fortunately, Jeanne had finally fulfilled George’s wish. At least, they were about to leave South Hampton City, which he did not like.

Jeanne took a deep breath.

She felt that she was thinking too much.

She picked up the phone and dialed Miles’s number. “I’m Jeanne. Where are you now?”

“I’m leaving with George from the Lawrences’ manor. I’m preparing to go on the airport highway,” Miles answered.

In order not to attract attention, George still got up and went to school as usual. Nonetheless, he did not go to school after Miles picked him up. Instead, they went straight to the airport.

“I’ll send you my location. Come here to pick me up first, then we’ll get on the highway together.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne sent Miles the location of the station where the bus would arrive.

After Miles received the location, he sent a message: [I’ll be there in 20 minutes.]

The bus would also arrive in about 20 minutes.

Jeanne put down her phone.

She turned her head and looked at South Hampton City outside the bus.

This was her first time taking the bus. It turned out that taking the bus could allow her to slowly enjoy the scenery of the city.

The corners of her mouth curved into a faint smile.

Jeanne had thought that she would not have the slightest bit of feelings for this city.

At this moment, she felt a little reluctant to part with the city.

She just looked at the scenery outside the window indifferently.

After 20 minutes, the bus arrived at its destination.

The journey was smooth, so smooth that even Jeanne found it unbelievable.

In just 20 minutes, Fourth Master Swan could not find where she was.

Naturally, nothing shocking would happen.

Jeanne got off the bus and waited for Miles at the agreed place.

She waited for quite a while.

Jeanne frowned.

Miles should have arrived before her.

She pursed her lips and called Miles.

The phone was turned off.

Miles could not have turned it off.

For someone like him, he had to keep his phone on 24 hours a day during a mission.

Jeanne suddenly had a bad feeling about this.

She did not quite want to believe that Fourth Master Swan would target George.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and tried her best not to panic.

She called Kingsley.

It was 10:20 pm. Kingsley should have reached South Hampton City by now.

Even though it was a different number, Kingsley could confirm that it was Jeanne who called. He asked, “Have you arrived?”

“Has George arrived?” Jeanne asked immediately.

“No.”

Jeanne tightened her grip on the phone.

She should have expected that Miles would not have sent George over without waiting for her. Furthermore, Miles would have picked up his phone. She was just holding on to a small hope.

Jeanne did not think that Fourth Master Swan would be this smart.

She did not think that she had exposed herself in any way. She did not think that Fourth Master Swan would think that she would suddenly leave. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Given Miles’s ability, it would also be impossible for him to be caught by Fourth Master Swan just like that. Unless... Fourth Master Swan had ordered people to keep an eye on George such that they would immediately act once anything happened to him.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

It was useless to think about anything at the moment.

She could only calm herself down. She calmed down and told Kingsley, “George and Miles have gone missing.”

Kingsley’s expression had obviously changed.

“I asked Miles to pick me up before going to the airport, but now that I’m here, I don’t see them. Most importantly, Miles didn’t pick up his phone,” Jeanne explained the matter clearly.

“Where are you now?” Kingsley asked straightforwardly.

“I’ll send you the location.”

“Don’t go anywhere first. Wait for me!” Kingsley urged.
