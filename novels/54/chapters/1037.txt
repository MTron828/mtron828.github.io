1038 Pushed To The Limit

He thought about it and decided not to be soft-hearted.

He believed that Monica should be taught a lesson for choosing Michael. Therefore, he decided to keep the matter of him helping Jeanne to get evidence of Michael’s killings a secret.

Furthermore, before Mason left, Mason said that Jeanne had specifically instructed him not to tell anyone about that.

He was just keeping his promise!

…

Monica and Steve were sitting in the car.

Monica looked calm. It was as if she did not know how to smile or have many facial expressions.

Steve, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, hesitated before turning to Monica and saying, “Why didn’t you explain it to your friend?”

Monica looked at him.

“There’s nothing to explain,” she said.

Perhaps she would become like that one day.

Since she had chosen to achieve her goal by any means necessary, it was only a matter of time before she would take that step.

She had been to the nightclub so many times and had, in fact, come across many unwritten rules in the business world.

In this colorful world, those are the ones that would always work best.

“Take me to the hospital first,” Monica said.

“Alright.” Steve nodded.

He, too, knew that Monica had to go to the hospital every day. Since she could not go yesterday, she definitely had to visit her parents first thing today.

The car arrived at the hospital in no time.

Monica said, “Mr. Warren, come with me.”

Steve was a little surprised.

The next second, he accepted her invitation very happily.

He also wanted to visit the chairman, but he had not been able to for a long time because of the company’s affairs.

Monica walked into the hospital with Steve.

However, they were not heading for the ward, which made Steve somewhat puzzled.

He was even more confused when he saw Monica leading him to the hospital director’s office. It took him a while to react. “Chairman, are you planning to discuss our collaboration with the director?”

“Why not?” Monica asked.

Steve was stunned.

Why not indeed, but he did not expect Monica to be acting so quickly.

She had just gotten one order, yet she was already trying to get another before she gave herself some rest.

They walked toward the office of the hospital director’s secretary. “I’m looking for the director.”

“May I ask who you are?” the secretary asked respectfully.

“A patient’s family member, Monica. I need to speak to your director in person about my father, Gary’s medical incident,” Monica replied.

She cleverly used another identity to make the appointment.

The secretary quickly said, “Okay. Please wait on the sofa for a moment.”

Then, he made a phone call. “Director, a family member of a patient named Monica wants to see you.”

Monica waited at the side for a while.

After the secretary notified the director, he politely said to Monica, “Ms. Cardellini, please follow me.”

Monica, Steve, and the secretary walked into the director’s office.

The moment they walked in, Monica was stunned.

She did not expect Finn to be inside, and of course, there was no reaction from Finn.

Monica pursed her lips and saw the director walking up to her personally enthusiastically. “Ms. Cardellini, I wanted to look for you regarding your father’s matter, but I’ve been so occupied with work matters. I’m sorry I had to trouble you to come and look for me personally.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The hospital was involved in her father’s medical accident, so the director was obviously in the wrong.

Monica said, “I understand.”

“Please, have a seat.” The director quickly led her to the sofa in the office and told the secretary to make them tea.

At that moment, Finn was sitting next to the director.

The director said, “Our hospital does have a certain degree of responsibility for your father’s matter. However, if the surgeon had physical problems during the surgery, it is considered normal medical malpractice. But don’t worry, our hospital has bought insurance for this, and the insurance company will compensate you according to your father’s condition. Our hospital has done its best to follow up on this matter. Before the compensation is paid, we will let you know, Ms. Cardellini.”

“So, are you saying that money can solve the fact that my father is in a coma now?” Monica was somewhat sarcastic.

Of course, she did not accept that result.

“Of course not! Regarding your father’s current condition, Dr. Jones and I are contacting the most famous doctors in the world to come to our hospital for a consultation. I promise that we will do our best to treat your father,” the director said sincerely.
