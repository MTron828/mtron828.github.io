Chapter 1562: An Abnormally Drunk Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Just arrange the dinner for 7 p.m.,” Finn said bluntly.

It was because Monica was right beside him. If she had any objections to his arrangements, she would have voiced them out.

“Are you sure you don’t need to confirm it with Director Cardellini?”

“No need.”

“Alright, I’ll arrange it for 7 p.m. By the way, are you in room 2119, Mr. Jones?” “What?”

“Nothing. I just wanted to ask for your room number. My room is right next to yours, but you didn’t answer when I knocked on your door just now.”

“I’m out. I’m not in my room.”

“The next time you want to go out for a walk, you can ask me out. I can be your tour guide.”

“Next time, thank you.”

“You’re welcome. I’ll see you at 7 p.m.”

“See you at 7 p.m.”

Finn hung up.

After hanging up the phone, he saw that Monica had left his side and got up to go to the bathroom. Hence, he followed her into the bathroom.

In the bathroom, Monica was washing up, and Finn stayed by her side. He even wrung a towel for her and accompanied her to do her makeup. “Do you still need to wear makeup tonight?” Finn asked.

“Yes,” Monica replied.

Finn did not say much. After all, he was a doctor. Although he did not think that a little makeup would harm the baby, he thought it was a little troublesome and was afraid that she would tire herself out.

Monica put on some light makeup and went to get changed. She knew that she would be staying here for the night, so she brought most of her luggage over.

She also checked the temperature outside. It was only 10 degrees at night, so she had to wear a thin cotton-padded jacket.

She knew that there would be some other plans on the itinerary, so she brought a more comprehensive change of clothes. However, Finn was still wearing a thin suit.

“Don’t you have any extra clothes?” Monica looked at his clothes and asked.

“I’m not cold.”

“You haven’t even walked out of the door. How do you know you’re not cold?”

“I’m resistant to the cold.” Finn corrected himself.

“Don’t infect me if you catch a cold!” Monica muttered. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Finn did not say anything in response to that. Instead, he smiled. He had a feeling that Monica cared about him.

The group then gathered in the hotel lobby. After another round of polite greetings, they sat in a car and went to the most famous open-air restaurant on the top of the mountain in the scenic area.

Noticing that the temperature at the top of the mountain seemed to have dropped a little, the person in charge quickly asked, “Director Cardellini, are you cold?”

“I’m not cold.” She was dressed rather thickly.

She was basically dressed for winter. However, Finn… She turned to look at the man sitting with Wendy. He was dressed so thinly, but he could still remain calm under the cold wind.

“If it’s cold, let me know. We can go to the private room of the restaurant to eat.

However, the scenery might not as good. From here, you can see all of our city. Especially at night, the neon lights and the twinkling stars are beautiful and picturesque.”

Chi Mumu followed the introduction of the other party’s manager and indeed saw a spectacular and beautiful night scene.

She said, “I’m not cold, so let’s eat here.”

She could not let down the other party’s warm hospitality.

The dining table was filled with joy as they all talked and ate. Wendy put some food on Finn’s plate. “Mr. Jones, eat more.”

“Thank you, I can do it myself.”

“You seem to be eating very little. Do you not like the food here?” Wendy asked.

“I do,” Finn said politely.

It was just that most of his time was focused on Monica, to see how much she ate. If she did not eat much, he would consider giving her an extra meal tonight

“In that case, eat more. You’re so tall, yet you eat so little. No wonder you’re so thin.” Wendy kept putting food on Finn’s plate.

Finn also found it hard to refuse Wendy’s kindness all the time as it would be too hurtful if he did. However, it looked like both of them were interacting passionately. Monica saw it but pretended not to see it.

The other party’s person in charge also saw it. He chatted with Monica and said jokingly, “It seems like my secretary, Ms. Hansen, really likes Mr. Jones.”

Monica pursed her lips and did not say anything. All she did was reply with a faint smile. The person in charge seemed to have sensed that she was not interested in such things, so he changed the topic again.

After dinner, they sat on the mountaintop and chatted for a while before taking a bus back to the hotel.

When they returned to their rooms, Wendy suddenly called out, “Mr. Jones..”
