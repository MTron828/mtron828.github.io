After she left, Michael looked at Finn, who looked back at him. Just like that, the two of them looked at each other coldly.

However, no one said a word in the end.

Even as Michael left, Finn remained silent.

..

At that moment, in the dressing room, Jeanne and Monica were both changing out of their gowns.

Jeanne’s gown was too exquisite for her to wear for a day, so she decided to change out of it.

It took her at least half an hour to change out of it, but fortunately, she took them off. If she wore it for the rest of the night, she was not sure if she could take it off herself at the end of the day.

After taking off her gown, Jeanne changed into a simple but well-made dress. Although she did not get it tailor-made, it fit her really well.

At the same time, Monica had also changed into a pink dress.

Both of their dresses were beautiful in their own way. Jeanne’s dress was glamorous and added a charm to her presence, while Monica’s dress was elegant.

As the staff changed Jeanne’s hair and makeup, they also explained the origins of the dress to Jeanne. They said a lot, but Monica only thought of one word. “Extravagant!”

It was simply too bold, but Jeanne liked it, and she liked domineering men like Fourth Master Swan.

They were all having a good time in the dressing room until suddenly, someone knocked on the door.

......

A staff member walked toward Jeanne respectfully. “Ms. Lawrence, someone named Kingsley is looking for you.”

The smile on Jeanne’s face instantly froze.

However, Monica did not notice that. All she heard were the words “Kingsley” and appeared exceptionally excited. She quickly said, “Let him in!”

The staff member hurriedly went to the door and invited Kingsley in.

Kingsley walked into the dressing room with Lucy following beside him.

Jeanne pursed her lips at the sight of them. Then, she said, “Please can we have the room to ourselves?”

The staff members quickly put down the work in their hands and left.

Just as Monica looked at Kingsley excitedly and was about to greet him, she heard Jeanne say, “You too, Monica.”

Monica frowned.

“Please,” Jeanne said again.

Although Monica was a little unhappy, seeing that Jeanne was very serious about it, she got up and left.

In the room, only the three of them remained.

There was a moment of silence before Jeanne said, “Why are you here?”

“Fourth Master Swan sent me the invitation.”

Jeanne froze.

“I received it yesterday,” Kingsley said bluntly.

Jeanne did not say anything. It was not a big deal anyway.

“Even if he didn’t send me an invitation, I would come,” Kingsley said.

“Is that so?” Jeanne smiled.

“I want to watch you get married.”

Jeanne’s throat moved. In fact, she was not so indifferent to it. Even if the wedding was an order from him, she had no choice but to carry it out.

“Fourth Master Swan treats you quite well, I see,” Kingsley suddenly said.

At that, Jeanne looked at him.

“Today’s wedding was very grand.” Kingsley’s tone was very light, but it was clear that he approved.

However, Jeanne did not answer him because she did not know how to. She did not even know what Kingsley meant by those words.

“Other than coming to see you get married, I have something else to tell you in person.” Kingsley kept looking straight at Jeanne.

Jeanne knew that would be the reason why he came today.

“Don’t get your emotions involved.” Kingsley made sure to enunciate each word.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“I mean, don’t get your emotions involved with Fourth Master Swan,” Kingsley reminded her.

Jeanne smiled, and her smile was a little sarcastic. “Do you think feelings can be manipulated at will?”

Kingsley suddenly fell silent for a while. Then, he said, “Have you fallen in love with him?”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat, and she pursed her lips, not answering.

“You can’t fall in love with him.” Kingsley did not seem to be expecting an answer from Jeanne either. With an indifferent tone, he told her, “This is an order.”

As a professional killer, an order was everything, and it had to be carried out unconditionally.

“Yes,” Jeanne said respectfully

Since it was an order, she could only agree to it.

Kingsley looked at Jeanne silently for a while as if he had something to say. However, he chose to keep it to himself in the end.

As he turned around, he said, “Congratulations on your wedding.”

Jeanne wished she could strangle Kingsley to death.

With that, Kingsley left with Lucy, who turned around and smiled at Jeanne on her way out.

Jeanne smiled back while she watched Kingsley and Lucy leave.

At the door, Monica was waiting unhappily. When she saw Kingsley come out, she could not help but call out to him, “Kingsley, do you still remember me?”
