1153 The War Has Started: Edward’s True Identity Is Exposed

“I know I don’t have the right to choose, but I don’t think I’m that pathetic. After all, I was abandoned by my parents, so I can’t fight back and can only accept my fate However, I don’t know why Edward has to accept his fate and bear everything that you so-called Duncans have to! What is his relationship with you Duncans? What right do you have to ask him to do everything for you?” Finn sneered. “I really feel sorry for him!”

In fact, there were many things he had never said out loud because he did not dare to say them nor did he feel that there was a need to say them.

In the end, Finn still could not take it anymore and blurted everything out.

“Alex, do you think it’s unfair? From the moment you were born, you’ve been under immense pressure to rebuild the family and bring it back to its glory days. However, that’s your business. Whose fault is it that you’re a member of the Duncans? Who told you to bear the blood feud of all your family members? Whose fault is it that you’re indebted to all the loyal men who have died? Everything you’re doing now is what you should do!”

“However, the same doesn’t apply to Edward. He doesn’t need to bear the things that a Duncan should bear. He doesn’t need to be grateful to your mother for giving birth to him. He can even hate your mother for giving birth to him as a tool. She didn’t fulfill a mother’s so-called responsibility when he was born. Instead, she gave him a fate that made him suffer so much that he wish he was dead! If I were Edward, I would hate Winnie Schnider!” Finn’s emotions, which he rarely expressed, exploded at that moment.

Perhaps it was because he had experienced too much today, but he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.

That was why he dared to vent his anger on the person in front of him.

“To you, Winnie Schnider is great, but to Edward, she’s the cruelest person ever!” Finn enunciated every word. “So please, when Edward does something for you, don’t take it for granted! If Edward risks his life to help you out, it’s because of his friendship with you. But if he doesn’t, it’s not his duty to help you out. You don’t have the right to ask him! You don’t even have the right to use the most important person in his life to make a so-called exchange!”

Alex just listened to Finn accuse him.

He had indeed complained that he had no choice in his life and that everyone was living a better life than him.

No one else had to bear the burden, but he had to. Even if Edward had been tortured for his sake, he still felt that Edward was happy.

At least, Edward could still have emotions and desires.

He, on the other hand, had to destroy whatever was human about him. Since he had lost his humanity, he did not have much feelings for anyone.

Thus, even if he agreed with everything Finn said, it would not be of any use to him. What he had to do now was the only thing he knew how to do.

It was to... fight for the Duncans — to give an explanation to the ancestors of the Duncans and the loyal men who died for the Duncans.

As for other things, nothing else was important to him.

He said, “Finn, are you done?”

He listened to all of Finn’s accusations indifferently.

Finn’s throat moved slightly. He, too, felt that what he said was redundant. In fact, it was a little ridiculous.

“If you’re done, let’s get back to the main topic.” Alex’s face darkened. “Where’s George?”

Finn suppressed his anger and replied, “I don’t know.”

“So... you still want me to use cruel methods on you,” Alex said coldly.

Finn knew very well that keeping people of high position company was very risky.

“I heard that you can’t feel pain,” Alex said indifferently.

Finn did not answer.

He knew that Alex knew each and every one of them well. His understanding of the situation was deeper than they had thought.

“So, even if I beat you to death, you won’t react.” Alex looked at Finn. “The only person I can think of is Monica.”

Finn’s expression sank.

“Letting you save Monica was my mercy. But if you force me to kill Monica, I can only say that I have no choice.”

Finn was bursting with anger. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I don’t advocate killing. To me, I won’t use a knife to solve things that can be solved with strategy. However, if I can’t solve it, I won’t reject using such a bloody method to achieve my goal.” Alex explained clearly, “Between George and Monica, you can make a choice.”

“I don’t know where George is!” Finn gritted his teeth and said fiercely.
