1109 Edward’s Choice

The driver quickly got out of the car and sat in the back seat with Nox.

Once Edward got into the car, he stepped on the accelerator and sped off at a crazy speed.

Nox could not help but grip the armrest tightly, and Jeanne did the same.

The car sped up.

As it was still not too late at night, there were still countless cars on the streets of South Hampton City when Edward shuttled back and forth crazily, causing chaos after chaos.

“Edward!” Nox seemed to have realized that something was wrong with Edward.

In such crowded traffic, cars were coming in from all directions, and Edward’s madness made it seem like he did not want to live.

They had just passed the red light and were almost hit by the car coming from the side. Fortunately, Edward was quick to react, but the sharp turn and drift almost sent the person in the car flying.

Nox grabbed Edward’s arm. “Calm down.”

However, Edward did not reply nor did he slow down.

“Edward!”

Nox squeezed Edward’s arm to stop him from driving so recklessly, but Edward still did not react.

His eyes were fixed on the road ahead, and he was still speeding without any signs of slowing down.

“Edward, calm down!”

“I know what I’m doing,” Edward said coldly.

His cold voice pushed Nox away.

Nox did not dare to stop him now. At their current speed, if Edward were not careful, they would be crushed into pieces.

With that, he looked coldly at Jeanne, the woman who had provoked Edward. It seemed that she was the cause of all of Edward’s emotions for a long time!

Jeanne could also sense Nox’s hostility, but she chose to ignore it.

Moreover, with Edward’s insane speed, it was very likely that everyone in the car would be killed. Hence, she had to be prepared to jump out of the car anytime.

Silence filled the car, and by then, they were already in the suburbs.

The further they drove, the more remote the place was, and the more they did not know where they were. Every surrounding land seemed empty.

When they reached the end of the road, he slammed on the brakes, and the car came to a violent stop.

Everyone’s seat belts tightened. Their body did hurt a little, but the car finally stopped.

After the car stopped, Edward only stayed in the car for a second before he unbuckled his seat belt and got out of the car.

No one knew what Edward was up to.

No one knew why he suddenly went crazy and drove the car here. They just looked at him as he opened Jeanne’s car door, unbuckled her seat belt, and led her out of the car.

Their surroundings were pitch black, and all around them seemed to be fields. There was nothing strange about the place.

However, it was obvious that Edward was waiting for someone. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jeanne was frightened. At that moment, she could not help but wonder what Edward was going to do to her.

She tried to keep calm and said, “Are you going to kill me?”

Edward did not reply.

Instead, his grip on her hand tightened.

“Are you preparing to hand me over to the Duncans?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

To Edward, the best way was to hand her over.

By handing her over to the Duncans, she would be able to prove her loyalty on one hand, and on the other, they could use her to threaten the Sanders. Even if it did not have much effect, it was the most beneficial to Edward.

Edward still did not answer. All he did was hold her hand tightly in his palm and did not say a word.

Jeanne was also holding back.

In fact, she had already made all the necessary preparations when she came back.

She could accept all the tragedies that could happen.

After some time, a few cars quickly arrived and stopped a few meters away from them.

A group of people then got out of the car.

It was not... the so-called Duncans. It was Kingsley, who had appeared with Lucy and all the top assassins of the Hills.

It turned out that Edward was waiting for Kingsley and not for… the Duncans.

She turned around to look at Edward in disbelief.

Did he know what he was doing? Did he know what he would face if he called Kingsley over?

She knew that Edward only had Nox with him. Even if he had a driver, it would not be of any use.

Now, he was facing all the top assassins of the Hills alone.

Even a country would find it difficult to eliminate all of them, who were a group of capable fugitives.
