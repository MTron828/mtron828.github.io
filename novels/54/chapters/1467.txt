Chapter 1468: Nox and Shelly’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I came to the Winters to marry you. Now that it’s useless, I should leave,” Shelly said calmly.

It was as if she had already thought about it.

“Suit yourself.” Nox did not care at all.

He even thought that Shelly was playing the emotional card on purpose. Unfortunately, he did not have any sympathy for her.

“I’m going to revise.” Shelly turned around and left.

After the two of them talked, she was not reluctant to leave.

Nox naturally was alright with seeing her leave. In fact, he felt good about getting rid of Shelly so easily as he originally thought that Shelly would pester him.

It was rare for Shelly to think so clearly, and his impression of her had also improved a little.

After two days, that impression he had of her disappeared because Shelly got in a car accident on the day of the college entrance examination.

When Nox received the news, he was shocked. He had a feeling that a woman like Shelly could live for many years, so how could she be met with a car accident? He even heard that it was very serious.

He wanted to go straight to the hospital, but his friend reminded him otherwise.

His friend said, “Why, out of all days, did Shelly get into a car accident today?

Nox, don’t you think she’s deliberately using a ruse to stop you from being with Zoe so that the Winters would have no choice but to make you take responsibility for her?”

Nox instantly realized that that might be possible. After all, he believed Shelly was capable of anything.

She could watch him sleep with other women, watch indecent videos to learn skills, and even seduce him when she was taking care of him. He even found the conversation they had two days ago a little strange because there was no way Shelly could accept it so calmly. Now that he thought about it, it was indeed a big game of chess.

Shelly was so young. Why was her mind so complicated?! Did she think that by doing that on purpose, he would do as she wished? He would never fall for her trick.

After Shelly’s car accident, he had not visited her even once. He pretended not to hear or see the calls and messages from his grandfather and parents.

In any case, he definitely would not let Shelly scheme against him. It was not easy for him to want to get married, and he could not let Shelly ruin it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Due to Nox’s firm and stubborn attitude, his grandfather whipped him ruthlessly. He was beaten until his flesh split open, and he almost died on the bed. Naturally, it pained his mother to see him like that.

In fact, his mother was the first person to compromise and accept that he would not be with Shelly. Now that she saw that he was beaten up so badly, she gave up on matchmaking him and Shelly. She even called Shelly in front of Nox.

Nox did not want to hear Shelly’s voice at all. When he thought about how Shelly had set up that trap and made him suffer so much, he gritted his teeth and hated that woman to his core.

“Nox,” Shelly called his name over the phone.

“Are you satisfied, Shelly?” Nox sneered.

His grandfather was still forcing him to go to the hospital to see her, but he went on a hunger strike to protest. He would not submit even if he died.

“I’ll explain it to Grandpa Winter,” Shelly said on the other end of the phone.

Nox’s mother had told her to convince Nox to eat something. She said that Nox was on a hunger strike at home and was also seriously injured. Hence, she was worried that his body could not take it.

When Shelly heard the news, she found it a little funny. However, she felt more disappointed. It was just a car accident, yet he was not willing to even visit her.

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Nox asked her coldly.

“It’s not worth torturing yourself for me.”

Nox was stunned. At that moment, he thought that he was a little stupid. Why was he living like that because of Shelly?

“Shelly, what do I have to do to make you leave me?” Nox could not suppress his anger anymore.

Shelly hesitated before she said, “Why don’t you give me a breakup fee?” Nox thought he had misheard Shelly asking him for the breakup fee. “This way, we will have nothing to do with each other anymore.”

“Alright.” Nox was more afraid that Shelly would go back on her word, so he said, “Take my money and don’t appear in front of me again!” It would be best if they did not see each other ever again..
