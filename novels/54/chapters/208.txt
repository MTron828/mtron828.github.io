Chapter 209: Non-stop Reversals and Climaxes

The judge did not express his opinion.

Josiah stood up from his seat. “Lawyer Smith, you keep saying that Jeanne was wronged. Let me ask you the same questions again. Can you clearly answer me, the trial bench, and the judge? First, why would Mr. Zimmer conspire with Mr. Wadler to frame Ms. Lawrence? What was his motive, and what benefits could he get?! Second, why did the 30 million dollars end up in Ms. Lawrence’s account?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Actually, the answer to the second question is very simple,” Judah answered, “It’s because Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler wanted to frame Jeanne, so they naturally transferred the money to Ms. Lawrence’s account. Otherwise, if they transferred it to one of our accounts, would it even be an attempt to frame her?!”

The sarcasm in Judah’s tone made Josiah feel a little embarrassed.

He gritted his teeth.

“What about the first question?”

“Shouldn’t we be asking Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler the first question? All of my statements now are proving that my client had never done anything like signing a dual contract for personal gain. Once my client is innocent, logically speaking, this incident is then a joint frame-up by Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler. Let me repeat my view and evidence again. First, my client didn’t handle the dual contract; it was Ms. Walker who handled it. My client has no relationship with Ms. Walker, but she had a close relationship with Mr. Zimmer, so Ms. Walker couldn’t have done anything illegal for my client. Second, there was no handprint in the dual contract. There are a lot of talented people in Harken, so it’s easy to imitate someone’s signature. Besides, the accounts in the financial statement are full of loopholes. It’s obvious that they were done for the sake of accounting and aren’t consistent with the real thing. It shows that this is a frame-up. Finally, my client didn’t receive any notification of the transaction. My client didn’t know that there was an additional 30 million dollars in her account. If the court has any objections, you can check my client’s communication records through background data to see if there was any information about her logging into Swanhaven Bank, as well as a text message notification of the transaction.”

Judah said everything clearly in one breath.

“All in all, this is our plea for my client’s acquittal. We are defending my client’s innocence and thus suspect that she was framed by the other party. As for why the other party framed my client, it should be decided in the next lawsuit.”

Josiah was a little speechless.

According to logic, everything was right.

Josiah’s eyes moved slightly, “After you’ve said so much, I admit that you have your reasons. There’s also a certain legal basis. It can’t be denied that there are indeed problems between Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler. Even so, it can’t prove Ms. Lawrence hadn’t committed a crime. In the situation where Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler didn’t personally admit that this case has nothing to do with Ms. Lawrence, the prosecution can’t assume what you’ve said is the truth. Now, it’s very obvious that Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler are adamant that it was Ms. Lawrence’s doing. Again, I can’t find any reason, and there’s no reason in your reasoning that can explain why Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Wadler framed Ms. Lawrence out of everyone!”

“Lawyer Newton, you’re right.” Judah agreed.

Josiah frowned slightly.

He did not expect Judah to suddenly give in.

At that moment, he heard Judah say, “If 30 million dollars is just a drop in the bucket for my client, do you still think that my client would do something for personal gain?!”
