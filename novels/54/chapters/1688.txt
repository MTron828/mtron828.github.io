Nox was furious, but before he could release his anger on Shelly, he saw Shelly collapse in front of him.

‘F*ck!’ he cursed. Did Shelly dislike him so much that she had to faint as soon as she saw him?

Nox quickly went over to help Shelly up. He called her name a few times, but he was still scared out of his wits. Hence, he quickly called the ambulance, picked Shelly up, and ran out like crazy.

‘Shelly, don’t you dare to die in front of me. If you dare to die in front of me… Damn it!’ He realized that he was helpless against Shelly.

The ambulance arrived very quickly. Nox nervously carried Shelly into the ambulance that sent her to the hospital and the emergency room. Then, the doctor informed him that she had just fallen asleep from exhaustion.

Nox looked at the sleeping Shelly and was speechless. Was that woman crazy? He could not understand why that woman would want to make herself suffer like that!

Nevertheless, he stayed by Shelly’s side as she slept. He did not know if beauty was in the eye of the beholder, but he thought Shelly looked really good when she was asleep. As he stared at her delicate features, he could not help but…

Jeanne said he could not touch Shelly. At the very least, he should not do anything too intimate when Shelly had no feelings for him. Therefore, he suppressed his urge to kiss Shelly and just sat beside Shelly, bored out of his mind.

After some time, Shelly’s eyebrows twitched, which was a sign that she was about to wake up. Seeing that, Nox got very nervous. For some reason, he was that Shelly would wake up.

“Bella… No, don’t leave me, Bella…” Shelly’s words were unclear.

Nox frowned, wondering whether that woman was having a nightmare. She looked like she was in extreme pain.

“Shelly,” Nox called her, trying to wake her up from her nightmare.

“Don’t take Bella away. Don’t take Bella away…” Shelly shouted.

Her body twisted and turned as if something terrible was happening in the dream.

“Shelly, wake up. You’re having a nightmare… Oh.” Nox was suddenly stunned.

He had lowered his head to shake Shelly awake and did not expect Shelly to hug him tightly. It was as if she had grabbed onto a life-saving straw.

Nox did not dare to move. At that moment, his entire body had stiffened from Shelly’s hug, but seeing Shelly so dependent on him gave him an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.

As he could not help but reach out to hug her back, Shelly suddenly opened her eyes in the next second. When she opened her eyes, their eyes met.

Nox’s hand froze, not daring to touch Shelly. For some reason, he felt like he had been caught red-handed when, clearly, he had not done anything. Furthermore… it was Shelly who hugged him.

Nox quickly defended himself nervously, “You took the initiative. I didn’t touch you!”

Shelly stared blankly at him for a long time before her eyes regained focus.

When she saw the person in front of her, the disgust on her face was obvious.

Nox also saw it and was naturally unhappy. Just how disgusting was he to her?

Shelly pushed Nox away, and Nox also let go of her.

“You threw yourself at me. I had nothing to do with it.” Nox looked innocent.

Instead of saying something, Shelly observed her surroundings, and only then did she remember that she had fainted.

When she fainted, she vaguely saw Nox, whom she thought was an illusion. However, it was really Nox. In her dream, she even dreamt of Nox helping her to save Bella… She bit her lip.

When Nox saw Shelly ignoring him, he got angry. However, he had no choice but to listen to Jeanne. After all, Jeanne had easily broken up Shelly and Benjamin, and he had done so much for nothing.

Even though he had yet to find out what Jeanne had done, he was truly impressed. Hence, he would listen to her every word.

The first thing Jeanne told him was not to lose his temper at Shelly; even if he was about to die of anger, he had to endure it. Judging from Shelly’s fondness for Benjamin, she preferred men who were gentle..
