Chapter 238: Fourth Master Swan Teased Jeanne Back at the Banquet

Saturday.

Jeanne was planning to sleep in with George on the weekend when she was woken up by a phone ring.

She had put her phone on silent.

It was George’s phone that was ringing.

George’s hair was messy, and he was in a daze. His phone usually would not ring, except for when his mom and Kingsley called.

Could it be that something had happened to Kingsley?

Jeanne and George exchanged a look. George hurriedly got up and took his phone. The moment he did, he looked rather helpless.

Jeanne frowned.

“It’s Godmother,” George said and handed the phone directly to Jeanne.

Jeanne held the phone and looked at George. “When did you give her your phone number?”

“I didn’t give it to her. That day, she saw that I had a phone and snatched it away. She saved her number for me and used my phone to call her phone. Look at the name she saved for herself,” George responded.

Jeanne looked and could not help but laugh. Monica had saved her name as “The most beautiful godmother in the world.”

Monica was probably the only one who would do this.

“She even put her name at the top of my contact list. Including her, there are only three people on my contact list.” George was speechless toward Monica.

He did not interact with many people.

Nonetheless, Monica was the only one with such a weird personality!

He reckoned that one day, he would be driven crazy by Monica.

Jeanne pressed the answer button.

An energetic voice came from the other side. “Son, are you excited? The most beautiful godmother in the world has called you!”

“...” Jeanne was speechless. “It’s me.”

“Why is it you? Where’s my son?” Monica was speechless.

“Why are you looking for him?” Jeanne glanced at George.

George looked like he was not willing to answer the call.

“It’s nothing. I just wanted to hear his voice.”

“He’s sleeping.”

“Alright.” Monica did not mind. “I can’t affect my son’s growth. What if he doesn’t develop well in the future and no girls like him?!”

“...”

“Oh right, I’m looking for you. You didn’t pick up the phone. What are you doing?!” Monica was very unhappy.

“Can’t I put my phone on silent and sleep in for a while on the weekend?” Jeanne was on the verge of breaking down.

She did not know how Monica could be in such a good spirit.

“Why are you sleeping in? Aren’t you coming to my dad’s birthday party tonight?”

“Isn’t that at night?”

“I was afraid that you’d forget!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“...”

“Then go back to sleep, I’ll go and inform the others.” Monica hung up abruptly.

Jeanne looked at the phone. She was speechless.

George went back to sleep on the bed. It seemed that he could not fall asleep anymore.

He turned over and grabbed his messy hair.

Jeanne naturally could not fall asleep either.

She looked at George. “Tonight, Monica’s dad, the old uncle that you saw at Monica’s house the last time, is going to celebrate his birthday. Do you want to go to the birthday party?”

“No.” George covered himself with the blanket and refused. “Godmother is too enthusiastic. I can’t handle it.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

That was true.

Every time Monica saw George, she would... pinch his face.

Jeanne could not stand it anymore.

She said, “Alright, but I might come home later.”

“Why?” George revealed his little head and was a little dissatisfied.

“Monica’s parents were very good to me when I was young, so I’m going to spend more time with them tonight and help them greet their guests. Don’t wait for me tonight and go to bed early.”

“Okay.”

“If you can’t sleep, get up. I’ll take you out for a run,” Jeanne said as she patted George’s head.

“I don’t want to exercise.” George never liked to exercise.

That was to say, he did not like to walk more than he should.

He also did not like games that children his age liked to play.

Jeanne felt a little helpless.

George suddenly thought of something. “However, my teacher said that there might be a sports meet next week.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne was quite interested. “Did you sign up for any events?”

“I didn’t want to sign up for anything, but my teacher said that every student had to sign up for one event. Nobody wanted to sign up for long-distance running, so I signed up for it.”

“...”

“My teacher said that I could just run as much as I can and do my best,” George explained.

“Do you need a parent to cheer you on?” Jeanne asked.

If George needed someone, she had to free up her time.

“Yes. Besides, there’s also a relay race for grades 1 to 3,” George said, “It’s a family relay race.”
