1212 Nox Was Seduced By Shelly

When Shelly came back from school, she saw Nox sitting in a wheelchair, smiling like an idiot.

She did not know what was wrong with Nox today. Anyway, she had a lot of homework today and did not want to offend him, so she pretended not to see it.

She carried her school bag and wanted to go back to her room.

“Shelly!” Nox called her.

Shelly turned around. “What’s the matter?”

“Aren’t you going to cook now that you’re off school? Where are you going?”

“Isn’t Aunt Flora at home?” Shelly frowned.

Aunt Flora. had just come out of the bathroom. When she heard their conversation, she quickly said, “I’ll cook. I’ll cook right away.”

“Who told you to do it? Shelly will do it.”

“I’m about to take my college entrance exam.” Shelly tried her best to calm herself down.

“What does your college entrance examination have to do with me?” Nox deliberately made things difficult for her. “Either you cook tonight, or you hurry back to the Winters’ villa and tell my parents that you don’t want to marry me anymore–”

“I’ll do it.” Shelly directly interrupted Nox, “What do you want to eat?”

“I’m fine with anything.” After getting what he wanted, Nox wheeled himself back to his room in a good mood.

Shelly put down her bag, put on her apron, and prepared to cook.

Aunt Flora quickly came over. “Miss, let me do it.”

“If you do it, Nox is going to pick on me again.” Shelly refused.

“Actually, Young Master treats you…”

“I know.” Shelly said, “I know he doesn’t like me and he probably won’t marry me, but I want to persevere until the end.”

Aunt Flora sighed.

Shelly was actually a nice girl. It was just that sometimes, she was too persistent.

The Young Master, on the other hand, was not a bad person either, but he hated being forced by others. Therefore, it would be difficult for those two to be together.

Once Shelly had made dinner, she invited Nox to the table.

Of course, Nox was extremely picky. However, he still ate two big bowls of what Shelly cooked.

After eating, he ordered Shelly to wash the dishes.

After Shelly was done washing the dishes, he ordered her to help him with showering.

After helping him shower, he wanted her to massage his legs with essential oil.

After finally getting Nox to bed, Shelly was about to return to her room to do her homework when she heard Nox say, “I can’t sleep. Turn on the TV for me.”

Shelly took a deep breath. Every time Nox made her want to explode, she would swallow his anger.

She returned to the room and turned on the television for him. She asked, “What do you want to watch?”

“I don’t even know what shows there are, so how do you expect me to tell you?” Nox shouted at Shelly. His tone was as harsh as it always had been. “Go through all the TV stations from beginning to end.”

Shelly endured it and went through the channels one by one.

“Slow down. You’re going through the channels so quickly. Do you think I have eagle eyes?”

Shelly forced herself to slow down.

There were a total of 183 TV channels.

“Which channel do you want me to go to?” Shelly asked.

“32.”

Shelly pressed the button.

“No, 65.”

Shelly pressed the button again.

“No, 123.”

“No, 68.”

“I think it’s 23–”

“Bam!”

Shelly slammed the remote control down on the bedside table beside Nox.

“Why are you so aggressive?” Nox was shocked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He could not believe that Shelly would lose her temper with him.

“Your legs are crippled, but your hands aren’t!” Shelly yelled at Nox. She had suppressed her anger again and again. If you want to go to a specific channel, you can search for it yourself!”

As she said that, she turned around and left.

“Shelly, stop right there!” Nox was furious.

How dare Shelly scold him? Did she say that his legs were crippled?

Excuse him, but he would be able to run in a month!

In the room, Shelly stopped in her tracks because of Nox’s voice. Then, she came back and snatched the remote control away.

Nox sneered.

He thought Shelly would be able to walk away.

...

He said, “Change it to 66.”

However, Shelly pretended not to hear him. She took out her cell phone, aimed it at the television, and pressed a few buttons on the remote control.

Suddenly, a shocking scene appeared on the television screen!

At that moment, Nox’s eyes were wide open.

However, Shelly’s expression did not change. “You’ll like this! Enjoy!”

After that, she left the remote control and phone far away from his bed, where he could not get it no matter what, before she left!

When she left, she even slammed the door behind her, leaving Finn alone in the room with porn playing on the television.

‘F*ck.’
