1063 Crushing Michael (Confirmed To Be A Sc*mbag)

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“As for the internal management of Cardellini Enterprise, I’ll hand it over to Monica,” Nox said.

“Sure.”

“Aren’t you afraid that your 1 billion will go down the drain?” Nox asked.

He had to admit that even he was surprised when Finn said that he could fork out so much money.

Did it mean that after so many years, he was the poorest of the three?

“Money is not important to me,” Finn explained.

If it were not important, why did he earn so much?

Nox scorned.

“By the way.” Finn became more serious. “I’m investigating the expert who suddenly fainted during Gary’s surgery.”

“Any conclusions?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I found a drug in his blood that can induce high blood pressure and cause cerebral infarction. When the expert came to Harken, other than me, the only people he came into contact with were the reception staff. Among the reception staff, there were two new faces. I suspect that they were either Michael’s or the Sanders’ people. However, I personally think that the Sanders are directly involved in this.”

“What do you mean?” Nox’s expression was serious.

“Michael didn’t have the time then and shouldn’t have thought of tampering with the specialist. I’m guessing that the Sanders’ only request for Michael now is to force Cardellini Pharmaceutical out of the market and control the pharmaceutical market in Harken. So, Michael’s mind should be focused on destroying Cardellini Enterprise and developing Sunny Pharmaceutical. I’ve investigated Michael’s activities during that period. He spent most of his time negotiating with various pharmaceutical companies, so he couldn’t have had the time to do this.”

“So, it can only be the Sanders.” Nox was very certain.

“I’ll continue to investigate. If it’s really the Sanders’ doing, it will be of great help to Fourth Master in the future.”

“I know what you mean.” Nox understood.

“Will Fourth Master make any moves?” Finn asked.

“Not at the moment.” Nox said, “We need to give the other party some time to rope in some important people who are loyal to the Sanders. His opinion is to use as little force as possible and try not to cause too big a war. Otherwise, even if he really gets that position in the future, the public will not be convinced.”

“Alright.” Finn nodded.

“Be careful during this period of time.” Nox reminded, “The Sanders has already noticed the other party’s existence and is on high alert. If you investigate the Sanders now and they find out, the Sanders will definitely kill you.

“I know,”

“Alright. I’m going to help you with Monica’s matters now,” Nox said sarcastically.

Even so, Finn did not care. Instead, he said a few words to Nox before hanging up.

It was true that he was the one who told Nox to do what he did today.

However, it was not because his heart had softened for Monica, but because he was indebted to the Cardellinis.

Since there was a chance for Cardellini Enterprise to salvage the situation, he had to lend a hand.

…

A week later, Monica received Nox’s message.

She had to admit that she was a little shocked as she would never have thought that Nox was so efficient.

Within a week, he had really found evidence that could make Sunny Pharmaceutical suffer a crushing defeat.

Of course, during this week, Monica was not idle either.

Under the opposition of the shareholders and the senior management, she distributed Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs to the entire country for free. Everyone was given a limit to the amount they could take, but many people came for it.

What was more, Monica did not say it was for public service.

In front of the media, she came straight and said it was because Cardellini Enterprise was in a tight spot and could no longer make any sales — that was why they were giving them away.

The underlying meaning was that if Cardellini Enterprise could make sales, she would not have given the drugs for free.

It did not increase Cardellini Enterprise’s reputation, but Monica’s words had indeed brought about a great effect.

After all, many people were still afraid of buying medicine. Since Monica told everyone the truth about why Cardellini Enterprise was giving out drugs for free, and considering Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation, the public naturally believed the true effectiveness of Cardellini Enterprise’s medicine. Cardellini Enterprise’s medicine had a good reputation among the people in the first place anyway. As long as it was the real deal, no one would suspect that there was a problem with the medicine. Therefore, the number of people who came to get it increased.

In just a week, the stock was almost gone.

However, Monica would still release a number of drugs to the public every day.

That amount was enough to make Michael stomp his feet in anger.
