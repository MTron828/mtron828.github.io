Chapter 616: How Could Finn Forget Me So Easily?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica was clearly rejecting him, and it was not easy for him to get his hands on her. How could he let her leave?

With a cold expression, he drove to the quality inspection department.

Just then, his phone rang.

He glanced at the incoming call and said respectfully, “President.”

“I heard you went to Old Master Lawrence’s funeral,” the person on the other end of the phone said straightforwardly.

Michael’s eyes narrowed.

That meant his every move was being monitored.

“I went. I also witnessed a very interesting scene. Old Master Lawrence was killed by his own son, all for the sake of obtaining the inheritance,” Michael reported.

“Yes.” The president seemed to be just casually asking.

After all, an ordinary business magnate would not be able to attract his attention.

“President, there’s something I’d like to report to you.”

“Speak.”

“I don’t think Jeanne’s identity is simple,” Michael said bluntly. “The Swans is not submitting to you now, and the current head of the family, Fourth Master Swan, is married to Jeanne, who is astonishingly capable. I’m afraid if the two of them join forces, they will pose a threat to us in the future–”

“You don’t need to care too much about Jeanne. Just do your own thing.” The president did not seem to want Michael to care too much about Jeanne.

Michael could understand what he meant and quickly said, “Alright. Over the next few days, I will arrange for someone to enter Cardellini Enterprise’s medical research institute. Once I get hold of their internal secrets, I will take action against Cardellini Enterprise.”

“I’ll wait for your good news.”

“Yes.”

After hanging up the phone, Michael’s expression changed.

The president was so against him talking about Jeanne… In that case, who exactly was Jeanne?

He gritted his teeth.

It seemed he had to be wary of that person!

…

At the Lawrences’ solemn funeral, Finn watched as Michael and Monica left before he walked toward Jeanne and said, “Fourth Master told me to accompany you.”

“Actually, there’s no need for you to do so. You’ve just recovered from a serious injury, and I don’t think you’re fully healed yet. Go back and rest early,” Jeanne refused.

“I won’t do anything other than stay here and look after you. Don’t worry. I’m a doctor. I know my body very well.”

Jeanne still wanted to refuse as she was not used to troubling someone like that.

“Please don’t make things difficult for me.” Finn smiled.

Jeanne was helpless, thinking that Edward was really annoying at times.

She said, “If you feel unwell, you can leave any time. I’m not so delicate. I’m not so easy to bully.”

“I know, but you have to understand a certain someone’s feelings. He feels guilty that he can’t be with you here.”

Jeanne smiled faintly.

There was nothing to feel guilty about. After all, everyone was just living for themselves.

In the end, Finn stayed behind with Jeanne the entire time.

He really did not help Jeanne with anything. Most of the time, he just sat at the side and did not have much of a presence.

Jenifer only took a short rest before going back to help Jeanne with handling Jonathan’s funeral. Moreover, she was the one who made the initiative to approach Jeanne.

Many people from the business world came, and they greeted everyone. Jeanne was so busy that she almost did not have time to catch her breath.

In the afternoon, Gary came with Ruby, and beside them was Sarah.

Sarah was in her senior year of high school and had been living with her aunt during this time. It was mainly because her parents were busy at work and did not have time to take care of Sarah, so they sent her to Ruby’s. Since Ruby had always doted on Sarah, she agreed right away.

As soon as Sarah walked into the hall, she saw Finn among the many other people.

When her aunt and uncle went to pay their respects to the deceased, she took that opportunity to sneak up on Finn.

Finn did not react when he took a look at Sarah.

Sarah was already used to her Prince Charming’s indifference, so she asked, “Why are you here?”

Finn did not answer.

“I thought you wouldn’t have anything to do with my cousin after you and her divorced. Is it because my aunt and uncle are here? Were you waiting for them?”

“No,” Finn answered coldly.

“Then why are you here?”

“That’s my business.” He kept his distance from Sarah, and after saying that, he turned around and left.

“Finn,” Sarah called out to him.

He used to be his cousin-in-law, but now that he was not, she could call him by his first name.

Finn paused and turned to look at Sarah.

“I want to pursue you,” Sarah said bluntly.

In fact, she had never hidden her feelings for Finn.

Finn said, “I don’t like you.”
