Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I thought Shelly’s daughter was yours.”

“What nonsense are you talking about? Shelly, having a kid with me? In her dreams!” Nox said irritably.

He was so frustrated that all he could do was throw a fit.

“Oh,” Benjamin replied as he probably did not know how to talk to Nox anymore.

“What? Are you here to pursue Shelly again?” Nox suddenly asked coldly.

“Not really. We used to be classmates, and her daughter is hospitalized, so I’m here to take a look.”

Nox sized up the man, who was wearing a pair of refined glasses and looking like a nerd.

“I think you want to pursue Shelly again.” Nox was certain.

“If we develop feelings for each other, I won’t refuse.” Benjamin said, “Mr. Winter, you wouldn’t mind, right? After all, you don’t like Shelly, and Shelly’s daughter isn’t yours.”

“Will I mind? Am I crazy? Hurry up and pursue Shelly so that you can be with her. ”

“I’ll try my best.” Benjamin smiled.

When Nox heard Benjamin’s words, a burning rage was simmering in his heart.

“I’m going to see Shelly’s daughter.” Benjamin politely said goodbye and walked into Shelly’s daughter’s ward.

Nox looked at Benjamin’s back before turning around and slamming into the wall in front of him, simply because he was so angry!

“Mom, why did this man hit himself on the wall?” A child walked past Nox and asked curiously.

“Don’t look, don’t look.” The child’s mother quickly pulled her child away and quickened her pace. “That man is mentally ill. He’ll eat children.”

“Let’s run.”

The child pulled his mother away and ran.

Nox’s face turned red with anger when he heard the mother calling him sick, and he went back to his ward angrily.

In Shelly’s daughter’s ward, Shelly was surprised to see Benjamin as she did not expect Benjamin to come. In fact, she had never told anyone about her daughter’s illness, so how did Benjamin know?

Benjamin noticed Shelly’s confusion and quickly explained, “Didn’t I run into you in the hospital the other day? After you left, I went back to get my medicine and heard the nurse talking about your daughter. She said that your daughter was about to undergo an eardrum operation soon, so I asked a few more questions and found out that your daughter had an operation. I came over after class.”

“Oh.” Shelly nodded.

Before she went to sleep, she had indeed told the nurse about her daughter’s condition. She was afraid that her sudden illness would affect her daughter’s surgery, so she had to prepare for it first.

“How’s your daughter?” Benjamin turned to look at Bella.

“The doctor said she’s fine. She’s asleep now.”

“That’s good.” Benjamin nodded.” Oh right, this is a small gift I bought for Bella. I wonder if she’ll like it. I don’t know what to choose as a gift for a little girl, so I just bought a plushie toy.”

Then, he handed it to Shelly, a little embarrassed.

Shelly looked at the pink bunny and felt touched. She also seemed less resistant toward Benjamin.

She took it with a smile. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome. It’s nothing,” Benjamin quickly said.

As Shelly did not say anything else, it was still a little awkward in the ward, so Benjamin quickly changed the topic. “I just saw Nox outside.” Shelly did not have much of a reaction, so she responded.

“He seemed pretty angry. Did you guys fight?” Benjamin asked.

“No,” Shelly denied. “He’s just upset and angry at himself for being cheated on.” “Oh, I see. I was wondering what happened to him. He looked so irritable.” “Don’t worry about him. That’s just how he is.”

“But it’s only natural that he’s a little mentally unstable after encountering such a thing.” Benjamin was more understanding of Nox’s situation.

‘Yes.” Shelly, however, did not comment much.

Then, the room fell silent again.

Still feeling uncomfortable with Benjamin, Shelly said, “Bella is fine. Why don’t you go back?”

“Do you dislike me that much?” Benjamin smiled.

He was not angry at all.

“I’m just afraid it’ll affect your studies.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“In university, you just need to study to get enough academic credits. It’s not as hectic as studying in high school,” Benjamin explained..
