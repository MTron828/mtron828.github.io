Jeanne sat in her office chair and took a break.

She sipped her coffee and made a phone call.

“It’s rare for you to call me so frequently. Are you in trouble?” Kingsley Thorn’s voice was light and cheerful as always.

It should be midnight for Kingsley due to the time difference, but no matter when she called him, he always seemed to be available.

Sometimes, she wonders if he doesn’t sleep.

She said, “Help me investigate a person called Cameron Hall. He’s the boss of Ascension Technology. Find out if he’s related to Eden Swan. There’s no need to go in-depth. I want an answer within half an hour.”

“Did that bastard Eden Swan cause you trouble?” Kingsley gnashed his teeth.

“Nothing I can’t manage.”

“That bastard will suffer retribution sooner or later!”

“In due time.” Jeanne Lawrence said.

“Wait for my reply. I’ll find out if Cameron Hall and Eden Swan are related.”

“Thanks.”

As Jeanne Lawrence hung up, the phone rang again.

Jeanne Lawrence looked at the caller ID and answered, “Dad.”

“I told you to come to my office the moment you came back. What are you doing?!” Alexander Lawrence’s furious voice came from the other end.

Jeanne Lawrence remained unmoved. “I have some matters on hand. I’ll come once I’m done.”

“Jeanne Lawrence! Do you know that in the workplace, you have to obey the orders of your superiors?”

Jeanne sneered.

She finally knew about the so-called workplace mistreatment often talked about in Harken. It was these so-called leaders who had a strong sense of superiority. They thought themselves superior to others and were the only ones who mattered in the company. They acted like kings of olden days and that everyone had to obey their orders. To do otherwise would be treason!

She said, “I’ll come up to you when I’m done.”

And Jeanne hung up.

Alexander Lawrence held his phone, fuming.

At this moment, Joshua Lawrence was in Alexander’s office. He took the opportunity to sow discord. “Dad, I can’t believe my sister doesn’t respect you!”

Alexander suppressed his anger.

“She took the liberty to change our investment amount today. Even if it was a favorable outcome, it was still something she acted on her own. She didn’t even inform you, nor has she taken the initiative to explain to you… Dad, don’t you think that’s too much? Does she think she owns Lawrence Enterprise and that she can do whatever she wants? She must think highly of herself!”

“Enough!” Alexander snapped at Joshua. “Cut the crap. You’re one to speak!”

Joshua was embarrassed by Alexander’s sudden outburst.

He said, “Dad, I’m only 23 years old. It’s only been a year since I graduated from university. Most of my peers are still fooling around. How can you say that?”

“And? Jeanne’s only 25 years old. Why didn’t you mention that? Eden Swan’s only 25 years old, yet he’s in-charge of the Swanhaven Bank. Why don’t you think about how Edward Swan, who’s only 23 years old, is in-charge of the Swan family matters? You’re 23 years old. Aside from playing games and pretending to work in the company, what else can you do?” Alexander directed his anger at Joshua.

Joshua was not pleased to be scolded.

He could not help but say, “I take after you…”

“Joshua Lawrence!” Alexander was even angrier now.

Joshua trembled in fear.

Fortunately, someone knocked on the door.

Alexander suppressed his anger and said fiercely, “Come in.”

Jeanne pushed the door open and entered.

Joshua let out a small sigh of relief. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

With Alexander being this angry, Jeanne was in for a good scolding. Joshua looked forward to seeing her make a fool of herself.

Jeanne felt Alexander’s anger the moment she entered.

However, she acted dumb and said in an amicable manner. “Dad.”

“Call me General Manager in the office!” Alexander Lawrence put on airs.

“Understood.” Jeanne nodded.

“How did it go?” Alexander Lawrence looked serious.

“I wanted to report this to you privately.” Jeanne Lawrence picked up the contract in her hand. “I went to MUK today to discuss the proposal, but at the last minute, I changed the investment amount…”

“Jeanne Lawrence, who do you think you are? What right do you have to change the company’s investment amount? Do you think you can do whatever you want just because you’re my daughter? Do you know that the investment amount is the decision from the board of directors? If you change it without permission, the proposal is invalidated!” Alexander Lawrence was furious.
