1187 In This World, Jeanne Is “Dead”

At that moment, Edward was standing behind Alex and threatening the latter with his cold voice.

Alex turned around and looked at Edward.

The man had collapsed from taking the hormonal drugs. How could he be awake and in front of him now?

In the past, Edward’s body would need at least three days of rest. Yet now, it had not even been three hours.

What did he rely on to get up and get here?

Alex had planned to end the battle with Jeanne as soon as possible while Edward was unconscious. Otherwise, once Edward woke up, he would not be able to do anything to Jeanne unless he really broke off all ties with Edward.

However, as a member of the Sanders, Jeanne had to die. The Sanders had to be eliminated completely!

After all, Alex was still Alex. The man, who had been trained to be like a machine since young, would not be affected by Edward’s sudden appearance.

He said, “Do you think I’ll be threatened by you?”

“You will!” Edward was certain.

Alex’s face darkened.

The current situation could be considered stable, but if it was unstable, the tide could turn at any moment.

Edward had that ability to make everything he had just obtained disappear into thin air!

“I’ll use Jeanne and you as the bet.” Edward negotiated.

Alex looked at him coldly.

No objection meant that he agreed.

“As long as Jeanne is alive, I’ll be loyal to you for the rest of my life. If Jeanne is dead... Edward said, “I’ll be the next Sanders!”

Alex had never been triggered like that before. However, because of Edward, he flew into a rage.

His veins were popping, and his expression was hideous.

He glared at Edward, who had just risked his life to save him from the Sanders. Yet now, Edward was going against him because of Jeanne.

He was bursting with anger, but he was also trying to suppress that emotion.

Just like that, the situation remained a stalemate.

Edward did not compromise because of Alex’s emotional outburst. Instead, he became more determined until…

Alex made his choice. He said, “You’d better know what you’re doing!”

After that, Alex left with his men. It was obvious that he had given in to Edward and let Jeanne off.

Edward pursed his lips. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Alex leaving was not a victory. On the contrary, it meant that his brotherhood with Alex was over!

Edward stared at Alex’s back before turning around and looking at Jeanne, who was covered in blood.

When their eyes met, Jeanne did not know if she should walk to Edward’s side.

She felt that she might be a disaster because wherever she went, death followed her. She was even afraid that Edward would get hurt if he got close to her.

However, at that moment, Edward walked over toward her.

“Ed–”

Before Jeanne could say his name, Edward had pulled her into his embrace. As if he was afraid of losing her, he hugged her tightly and buried his head in her neck.

He would never let her go!

Jeanne’s tears streamed down her face like a waterfall.

She had never thought that she would be so attached to that embrace one day and that the embrace would bring her so much warmth.

Just when she felt that she had lost the whole world and was in despair, this hug brought her back to life!

The two of them hugged for a long time, and no one was willing to leave until Edward’s entire body fell heavily on Jeanne.

He seemed to have reached his limit and could no longer hold on.

He said, “I’m going to sleep for a while–”

“Edward!” Jeanne called out to him.

He was clearly still comforting her the moment he fell.

At that moment, the Swans’ subordinates who had followed Edward here quickly came to help him up and bring him into the car parked outside the private parking lot. Jeanne also got into the car.

The car sped toward the Swan family’s manor.

After the subordinates placed Edward on the bed, Jeanne stayed by his side.

The subordinates were extremely respectful. “Ms. Lawrence, Fourth Master fell asleep because of the drugs. Usually, there won’t be much of a problem, and it’ll be fine when he wakes up. We’ve already contacted Dr. Jones, but he hasn’t been picking up. Once we’ve contacted him, we’ll get him to come here. Please don’t worry too much.”

Jeanne nodded.

She had actually experienced the aftereffects of Edward’s drug, so she knew that he would be unconscious for a long time. However, his sudden collapse made her a little worried.
