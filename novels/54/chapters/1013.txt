1014 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

After reading the content of the news, Monica glanced at the comments section.

There were a lot of comments in the comments section, and most people were making rational analyses, stating that Cardellini Enterprise’s research and development team would leave Cardellini Enterprise.

Monica gritted her teeth.

She glanced in the direction of the operating theatre, turned back to her mother, and said, “Mom, I’m going make a phone call. I have something to do at work.”

Ruby nodded stiffly.

At that moment, other than her father’s surgery, her mother probably was not paying attention to anything else.

Monica walked to the side and quickly dialed Steve’s number. “Mr. Warren, I just saw the news that our research and development team has jumped ship. Is it true? Hurry up and verify it.”

“It’s true.” Steve said, “The human resource department has received resignation letters from 80 percent of the research and development team.

“What?” Monica gritted her teeth.

“I’m doing some thinking right now, but… the situation doesn’t look good.”

“Why did they suddenly resign? Didn’t we just prove our innocence?” Monica could not understand.

“I’m also very surprised. These people were our company’s core team, and we’ve done our best in signing labor contracts and paying them well. Under normal circumstances, no one would resign. But now, these people are willing to pay a large sum of liquidated damages to leave Cardellini Pharmaceutical!”

“Why do they want to leave?” Monica was on the verge of breaking down and could not think of a lot of things.

“I just asked a research and development staff I’m close to, and he gave me a brief explanation. The general idea is that the other company pays better, and they will pay the penalty for the breach of contract. That means they have no choice but to go.”

“Are they so heartless? They want to leave just because of the benefits? Isn’t it just an increase in salary? I’ll increase their salary too!”

“I don’t think it’s about the pay.” Steve said, “Don’t panic. I’m still trying to make them stay. I’ll let you know if there’s any new information.”

“You must make these people stay. Without them, the Cardellini Enterprise will die!”

“I know.” Steve nodded. “I’ll do my best.”

“I’m counting on you. My dad is in surgery now, and I can’t leave.”

“Stay with the chairman. I’ll handle it.”

“Mr. Warren, thank you so much.”

“As I should.”

When Monica hung up the phone, her eyes were red with worry.

She thought about it for a while before quickly giving Jeanne a call.

Now that her father was still in surgery, she was not in the mood to think, and nor could she think about many things.

She instinctively relied on Jeanne as she always felt that Jeanne could help her solve any problem.

However, when she made the call, the other party’s phone was turned off.

Why did Jeannie turn off her phone?

Monica was very anxious. She felt that no one could help her except Jeanne.

Just as she was panicking, she suddenly heard her mother’s voice. She could not hear what her mother said clearly, but she could tell that she was crying.

Shocked, Monica quickly put down his phone and ran over.

Then, she saw a group of doctors and nurses in surgical gowns suddenly carrying a doctor in a surgical gown away.

The situation looked serious.

The moment Monica went over, she heard Ruby say, “Yes, yes, it’s your father’s attending doctor. Apparently, for some reason, he suddenly fainted during the operation and is now being sent to the emergency room.”

Monica was stunned.

What did she mean by the attending doctor fainted during the operation? If he fainted, what would happen to her father?

Monica looked at the group of doctors and nurses leaving in disbelief.

She turned around and said to the nurse in charge outside the operating theatre, “Since the attending doctor has fainted, what will happen to my father? What’s the situation inside?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Miss, please calm down. A nurse has already gone in to check on the situation and informed the hospital leaders of the latest situation. The most urgent emergency operation will be carried out soon. We will do our best to ensure that the operation goes smoothly. Please don’t worry.”

“Wouldn’t you be worried if your dad was in the operating theatre? Can you stay calm?” Monica had lost control of her emotions.

She had never thought that such a thing would happen to her.

What had she done in the past half of her life to deserve such retribution?
