Chapter 211: Jeanne Accused Them on the Spot

The entire court stood up.

The judge declared, “According to the verdict of the collegiate court, after being investigated and debated by the court, there’s not enough evidence to prove that Jeanne Lawrence has used a dual contract to privately profit from the construction of the Lawrence Enterprise’s logistics warehouse. She will be released on the spot.”

When the words “released on the spot” were said, Jeanne let out a sigh of relief.

She knew very well that the facts of the crime were not sufficient. Nonetheless, Harken was the Sanders’ territory. She was worried if something might be done under the table.

Fortunately, Harken had been a country of human rights for these few years. Even if the Sanders were the dictator, they did not dare to do too many things that went against the wishes of the people.

In fact, it was understandable.

The Sanders had only taken over Harken for a few decades, and their foundation was not strong enough. If they wanted to rule for the long term, the most important thing was to win the people’s hearts.

Jeanne quietly adjusted her emotions.

At this moment, among the audience.

Monica was so excited that she was about to run naked.

Although she had never watched other people’s lawsuits, she felt that today’s debate was awesome. Initially, everyone thought that Jeanne was dead for sure, but in the end, the tables had turned so beautifully. Many people were slapped hard in the face!

In fact, Eden looked so cruel that it was evident that he was furious at this moment.

‘We’ve come so far!

‘We’ve come so far, yet Jeanne still managed to escape!’

At this moment, Eden was so shocked that he could not accept the outcome for a few seconds. He could not accept that Jeanne could still be “acquitted” under their careful arrangement!

He gritted his teeth.

Eden really wanted to kill Jeanne just like that.

That was because his mind was so blank at this moment that he could not find any other way to frame Jeanne. He even had a feeling that Jeanne would develop even better from now on and that she would ruthlessly step on him and develop even better.

The more Eden thought about it, the more twisted his expression became.

Of course, it was not just Eden.

There were also Joshua and Jasmine by his side. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The jealousy and hatred in Jasmine’s heart made her unable to calm down at this moment.

Her body was trembling.

Jasmine could not accept that Jeanne had suddenly changed into a different person when she returned this time. She could not accept that Jeanne was so much more outstanding than her!

She could not accept it!

Meanwhile, Melody, who was in the corner, was also suppressing her crazy emotions at this moment.

The lawsuit that had originally caused Jeanne to lose everything had now turned into a way for Jeanne to show off in front of everyone and slap everyone in the face!

At this moment, Melody was slapped in the face by Jeanne.

She had used so much of her power behind the scenes, but it was useless.

Melody forcefully suppressed her emotions and stood up, intending to leave.

At this point, she was very clear that the tables could not be turned anymore.

She could only grit her teeth and accept the outcome.

However, just as she was about to get up…

Once the judge finished his pompous words and was about to announce the “dismissal” of the court…

Jeanne suddenly opened her mouth and said, “Your Honor.”

The judge was stunned.

“Right now, I need to sue Adrian Zimmer, Tenda Wadler, and Lunetta Walker. I was deliberately framed by them. Also, the Lawrences did indeed make a profit under the dual contract, resulting in a loss of 30 million dollars!” Jeanne enunciated each word carefully, and her tone was serious. “I hope that you’ll continue the trial, Your Honor!”

After her acquittal was announced, she applied in court for the case to be continued to be heard.

Everyone at the scene, who originally thought that the case had been closed, became excited again.

Logically, the testimonies of Adrian, Tenda, and Lunetta had the element of framing. Nonetheless, that would be for the second court trial that the prosecution would initiate, and it would not be held in the same trial. According to the laws of Harken, a large amount of evidence had to be prepared before each court session. The court would only start the trial after receiving valid evidence from the inspection authorities.

The courtroom was a little too quiet at this moment.

The judge said, “Regarding your accusation, you can first apply to the prosecutor’s hall. Our court will conduct another trial based on the relevant evidence of the prosecutor’s hall at a later stage.”

“Your Honor,” Jeanne said slowly, enunciating each word clearly, “This case is of great importance to me. Besides, the evidence presented at the scene of our court is very sufficient to prove that Adrian Zimmer, Tenda Wadler, and Lunetta Walker are serious suspects. Most importantly, the fact that the three of them jointly testified against me is very suspicious. After all, I have no enmity with them, and I have reason to suspect that the three of them were instigated by someone else. Once the court is adjourned, I’m worried that the person behind the scenes will have enough time to get away with it!”
