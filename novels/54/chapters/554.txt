Chapter 555: Sowing Discord Between The Lawrences

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Jonathan was old, he still had ambition.

He said, “Okay. I understand now.”

“Grandfather, we seem to have gone off topic again.” Jeanne smiled and acted as if she was just talking about normal stuff. “Regarding the position changes in the company–”

“I’ll put you in charge of it,” Jonathan agreed immediately.

“I won’t let you down.”

“I have faith in you.”

“Then, when are you planning to hand it over to me?”

“Are you that impatient?” Jonathan asked.

“I want to resolve it as soon as possible. Only by completing one thing can I do more.”

Jonathan nodded. “I’ll go to the company tomorrow to personally change and clarify your authority.”

“Thank you, grandfather.” Jeanne smiled gratefully.

Alexander would definitely be jealous of the fact that Jonathan was going to the company again to support her.

She said, “In that case, I won’t waste any more of your time. After all, this is still work hours, and I’m technically absent at work.”

“Jeanne.” Jonathan called out to her and said earnestly, “What happened seven years ago… Since it’s over, I hope you don’t take it to heart and know that I sincerely acknowledge you.”

“I know.” Jeanne sounded sincere.

“Now, go to work. If you need my help, just say the word.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne agreed obediently and left Jonathan’s study.

After leaving the study, Jeanne snickered.

To think Jonathan wanted to benefit from her?

It seemed like the old, sly fox was no better than that.

Just as she was at the top of the stairs, prepared to head down, she saw Alexander rushing toward her.

She did not have to think to know that Jenifer tipped him off.

The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. “Dad.”

“Why are you here and not at work?” Alexander’s expression was dark.

“I needed to talk to my grandfather about something.”

“What did you have to talk about?” Alexander asked fiercely.

“Some... things.” Jeanne deliberately avoided answering.

Alexander’s expression turned ugly.

“Dad, it’s nothing much. I just figured I haven’t been back for quite a while to visit my grandfather, whereas you, I see you every day at work. He seems to be in good health.”

Naturally, Alexander did not believe Jeanne’s nonsense.

“Dad, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head back to work.” Jeanne smiled. “However, I’ll be back more often too. After all, Grandpa has told me to.”

Alexander looked at Jeanne coldly.

Jeanne said calmly, “I didn’t know at first, but now I realize my grandfather is pretty good to me.”

Alexander sneered.

How could his father be good to Jeanne?

She must be dreaming.

“He also said that I’m much more capable than Jasmine and Joshua and that he doesn’t regret giving me the shares. He told me if I work hard, he’ll give me more privileges in the future.” Jeanne looked very innocent as she said, “Father, although Harken’s tradition is for the son to take over the family, if the son can’t support the family, will grandfather go against that tradition? After all, George may be Edward’s son, but his family name is Lawrence. I’m sure my grandfather can see that too.”

“What do you mean?” Alexander’s expression changed.

“Nothing. It’s just all in my mind.” After Jeanne said that, she left.

Alexander stared coldly at Jeanne’s back.

Jeanne’s smugness made him feel uncomfortable, but he had to admit that it served as a warning for him.

Over the past few years, his father had become increasingly dissatisfied with his control over Lawrence Enterprise and displeased with Joshua’s mediocrity. However, Jeanne’s return drastically changed Jonathan’s thoughts on the matter... Perhaps his father might be swayed.

At that, Alexander’s expression turned grim.

He could allow Jeanne to snatch Lawrence Enterprise away from them! Never in a million years!

…

Jeanne walked out of the Lawrence family’s manor, where Miles had parked the car at the entrance.

When Jeanne sat in it, Miles asked, “Are we going back to Lawrence Enterprise?”

Jeanne looked at the time — it was 4:30 p.m., which was neither too late nor early. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She said, “Let’s go back to the Swans.”

“Okay.” With that, Miles started the car and drove away.

Jeanne leaned against the back seat, thinking about something.

She deliberately went behind Alexander’s back and came to look for Jonathan today to sow discord between the two of them.

Now that Jonathan knew her “ambition”, which had inspired his ambition, his opinion of her would definitely change even more, and he would protect her. In turn, Alexander and even Joshua would fall out of favor, causing a conflict between Alexander and Jonathan. Alexander would be worried that Jonathan would really give everything to her, and since he could not accept such a thing, it would create a rift between the father and son.
