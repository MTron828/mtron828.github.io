Chapter 42: Jenifer’s Scheme

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After leaving Sam’s line of sight, Jeanne’s eyes turned cold.

‘What is Jenifer up to again?!’

She pursed her lips and looked at George and Paul not far away. The two of them obviously did not have a good relationship and were playing their own games...

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

Even the children knew... to put up a pleasant front.

At night, Eden made a trip to the Lawrence family’s manor to confirm the flow of the wedding tomorrow.

He was surrounded by everyone the moment he arrived. It was as though he was a celebrity.

Jeanne stood on the guardrail on the second floor and watched Eden politely greet everyone. He told Jasmine about the matters tomorrow before he left the manor.

The moment he left, he seemed to have raised his head to take a look.

Jeanne was cold.

At that moment, in the hall, after Eden left, everyone was excited.

An elder said, “Young Master Swan is not only a good-looking person, but he’s also very considerate. His family background is also prominent. Only someone as outstanding as Jasmine is worthy of him!”

A youngster said, “Young Master Swan is really handsome. He’s even more dazzling than he is on TV. Sister Jasmine, you’re really blessed...”

For a moment, there were remarks of envy.

Jeanne looked on indifferently. She turned around and went back to her room.

“Jeannie.” Sam appeared behind her.

Jeanne frowned slightly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

She could clearly feel that this person was deliberately trying to be nice to her.

He definitely had ill intentions.

“I heard about the matter between you and Jasmine. If it wasn’t for her, you’d be able to enjoy this glory today.” Sam seemed to be defending Jeanne against injustice.

Jeanne smiled. “Jasmine and Eden are a match made in heaven. It’s only natural for them to be together.”

A match made in heaven.

Sam still wanted to say something.

However, Jeanne had turned around and left.

Sam’s expression was a little ugly.

No matter how good-looking she was, she was still a woman who had given birth to a child. In the city he was from, a woman with a child like her would not have face, let alone status.

‘Why is she being so arrogant?!’

“Sam,” Jenifer suddenly called out to him from the corridor.

Sam immediately tried to fawn over her. “Auntie.”

“Come with me, I have something to tell you.”

“Okay.”

Sam followed Jenifer and left.

Jeanne returned to her room, but George had not returned to his room yet.

Today, George had been pestered by Paul the whole day. Why was he not back at this late hour?

Jeanne hesitated for a moment and decided to take a shower first before calling George back.

With this thought in mind, she quickly took a shower and changed into a set of pajamas.

Just as she was about to leave, someone knocked on the door.

At this moment, Jenifer, Phoebe, Paul, and George appeared at the door. Before Jeanne could speak, Phoebe said, “Jeannie, Paul really likes to play with George. He said that he’ll let George sleep with him tonight. Paul has always been very introverted. It’s rare for him to find someone he can play with. Can you let George sleep with Paul tonight?”

Jeanne was about to speak.

Jenifer beat her to it. “Jeannie, I don’t know if it’s because Paul was born to an elderly mother, but his personality has been different from other children since he was born. It’s rare that he likes George so much, so let him sleep with George tonight. Don’t worry, your aunt will look after them. She’ll cover them with blankets tonight.”

“George doesn’t like to sleep with other people,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

“When children are sleepy, why would they care about who is by their side? Jeannie, today is Paul’s first day here. He’s very unfamiliar with your home and likes to play with George. Just let them sleep together tonight. After tonight, I won’t let Paul sleep with George anymore, okay?” Phoebe asked with a pleading tone.

If Jeanne refused at this time, Jenifer would do something again.

Moreover…

Jeanne wanted to see what Jenifer was up to again.

She smiled. “Since you say so, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of George tonight, Auntie.”

“You’re too polite. Oh right.” Phoebe quickly asked Paul to bring out a cup. “Paul, didn’t you bring some orange juice from our hometown for Jeanne?”

Paul quickly handed over a cup with both hands, “Sister, my grandmother personally made this. My grandmother isn’t in good health and can’t come to Sister Jasmine’s wedding, so she asked me to bring orange juice for everyone to drink. Everyone else except you has drunk it. This is for you. Why don’t you see if it suits your taste?”

He looked sincere.

This child was truly educated by the Fabians such that he did not have the innocence of a child.

Jeanne took the cup and took a look.

Phoebe said, “When you came to our house back then, you loved to drink this. Before I left, my mother-in-law specially asked me to bring some back for you. Have a taste and see if it still tastes the same as before”

Jeanne smiled.

She drank it.

In order to accomplish something, Jenifer could really come up with all sorts of ideas.

After Jeanne finished drinking it, Jenifer obviously smiled.

It was a smile of success.

Jeanne said, “It’s very delicious. Help me thank her.”

“I will, I will, It’s getting late, so I won’t disturb your rest. Paul, hold George’s hand. Let’s go to bed,”?Phoebe quickly said.

Paul obediently took George’s hand.

George looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne gave him a look.

George nodded and left with Paul.

Jeanne watched them leave.

She closed the door and walked straight into the bathroom at that moment. She used her fingers to dig at her throat a few times.

Jeanne vomited some water, but it was impossible for her to vomit it all out.

She thought for a moment and made a call.

“Are you in a bad mood? Do you need some consolation?” The person on the other end was very excited. “Do you want me to drink with you?”

Jeanne did not have time to joke with her. “It’s 9:00 pm now. Drive to the entrance of the Lawrence family’s manor at 11:00 pm and wait for me.”

“Why do I have to wait until 11:00 pm? I’m free now.” Monica was puzzled.

“Do as I say,” Jeanne said straightforwardly and added, “If I don’t come out at 11:00 pm, you have to wait until I do.”

“What happened?” Monica was baffled. “Are you possessed? Are you having a mental disorder because Eden is getting married tomorrow?!”

“Eden’s marriage doesn’t affect me at all.”

“Really?” Monica did not seem to believe it.

Jeanne did not want to explain.

“By the way, didn’t anything happen between you and Fourth Master Swan that night? It was such a good opportunity. Did anything happen?” Monica asked.

In fact, she had called the next day to ask but was fobbed off by Jeanne.

She seemed to be unwilling to give up.

“No. Not only that night, but nothing will happen to us in the future as well!” Jeanne was resolute and decisive.

Monica was speechless.

It was clear that Fourth Master Swan treated Jeanne... differently.

“Right, is Dr. Jones around tonight?” Jeanne asked.

“Yes. He’s not on duty tonight. By the way, why do you keep asking—”

“Tell him that I have something to talk to him about tonight.”

Without waiting for Monica to speak, Jeanne directly hung up the phone.
