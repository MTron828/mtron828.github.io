1188 In This World, Jeanne Is “Dead”

She kept holding Edward’s hand.

All of the subordinates had already left Edward’s room, leaving only the two of them in the room. It was as if they were the only two people left in the world.

Jeanne did not know what would happen in the future, whether the Duncans would really let her off…

As the night deepened, Jeanne fell asleep beside Edward’s bed.

When she felt some movement beside her, she opened her eyes and saw Finn in the room. His eyes seemed to be bloodshot from all the exhaustion.

“Did I wake you up?” Finn’s voice was unusually clear.

Jeanne shook her head, got up from Edward’s bed, and looked out the window. The sky was already bright.

At that moment, Finn was examining Edward’s body seriously.

Jeanne waited quietly by the side.

After a long while, Finn said, “He’s just asleep. It’s no big deal.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded silently and then asked, “How’s Nox?”

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

Jeanne watched the subtle changes in his expression and saw his eyes redden as he tried to hold back his emotions.

“He’s alive,” Finn said, his voice sounding a little hoarse.

It was a sound made from trying to hold back his emotions.

“Just alive?” Jeanne asked him.

Tears fell from her eyes.

Sometimes, she really felt that tears were the most useless thing in the world, but she just could not control them.

“He’s not in a vegetative state. He can talk and move, and his IQ is still there.” The moment he said that, his eyes turned red.

Jeanne’s vision also blurred.

Then, he said in a suppressed voice, “But both his legs are disabled.”

Jeanne stared at Finn, the cold-blooded man, who had tears in his eyes when he said those words.

It turned out Nox was crippled. Was such a lively and active man going to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life?

How should she face Nox? How should she face Edward when he wakes up? How could she face Nox’s family?

Her tears were flowing like crazy, and she was overwhelmed with sorrow.

In the quiet room, no one spoke for a long time.

Once Finn seemed to have calmed down a lot, he said, “Don’t be too sad. No one will blame you.”

She knew, but she would hate herself to death. Due to her selfish desires and her deep hatred, she had implicated so many people.

“Have a good rest.” Finn tidied up the first aid kit in the room and added, “For the baby, you should rest well.”

Stunned, Jeanne raised her head and looked at Finn.

“She’s still there,” Finn said. It was probably the only thing that they could still be happy about. “She’s a very tenacious child.”

However, she clearly felt the pain in her abdomen and the blood between her legs.

Was the baby in her stomach really still there?

“I suggest you go to the hospital for a thorough check-up. After what happened last night, all I know is that her heart is still beating. As for whether she’s been affected or not, professional doctors and professional equipment will know better than me.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne really did not know what else she could say to Finn.

She did not even know if she should be happy at that moment.

In fact, she had no reason to be happy. Everyone else was hurt so badly because of her, but she was still perfectly fine.

“At least their sacrifices were not in vain,” Finn comforted her.

He seemed to have read her mind.

Jeanne nodded.

She was trying her best to agree with Finn’s point of view. Otherwise, She did not know what else she could convince herself to live on.

“Do you want to go to the hospital with me?” Finn asked.

Jeanne was a little hesitant.

“Fourth Master should be asleep for two more days,” Finn said as he looked at Jeanne.

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

Finn was right. At least, Nox’s sacrifice was not in vain.

She hoped that she could keep the baby in her stomach.

“I’m going to get changed.”

“I’ll wait for you.”

Finn waited for Jeanne outside for a while.

Jeanne changed into a clean set of clothes and left with Finn.

The two of them had just walked out of the hall when a few men in black suits stood in front of them.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

“Mr. Duncan has ??instructed that Ms. Lawrence is not allowed to go anywhere else except here!” The man in the black suit seemed to be respectful, but his tone was unusually stern.

...

Finn did not argue with the man in the black suit. Instead, he picked up his phone and called Alex.

The call connected. “How’s Nox?”

“He didn’t die,” Finn replied.

“Let him have a good rest.”

“Yes,” Finn responded.

“How’s Edward?”

“He’ll sleep for three to five days.”

“Alright.” Alex asked about the situation briefly before saying, “Is there something you need from me?”

“Jeanne needs to go to the hospital for a physical examination. She’s pregnant.”

“I know.” Alex said, “But in this world, Jeanne is dead.”

Finn gripped his phone tightly.

...

“So, she can’t go anywhere.” Alex gave him a clear answer. “Edward knew this when he brought her back. You don’t need to resist me because of this. You won’t get any benefits.”

With that, Alex hung up the phone.

Finn stared at the phone for a long time before he put it down.
