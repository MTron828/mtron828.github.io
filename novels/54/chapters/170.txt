Chapter 171: Framing and Conspiracy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the Lawrence Enterprise’s sales department.

Jeanne frowned.

She looked straight at the man in front of her.

The moment this man said that, it instantly shocked all the employees in the sales department.

“This is the investigation order.” Ron took out a freshly stamped document.

Jeanne was not panicking.

At that moment, she was only thinking about how the Sanders had gone to this extent to kill her.

Was she the one fighting with the Sanders, or were the Sanders not letting her off?

Jeanne responded, “Okay.”

She did not hesitate and left with the people from the prosecutor’s office.

After leaving, the entire Lawrence Enterprise was in an uproar.

Most of them did not know what had happened. They only knew that Jeanne had been arrested. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

It seemed to be an economic crime.

Joshua stood in front of the French window in his office and watched Jeanne get into the inspection car. Only then did he pick up the phone to call Eden. His smile was especially sinister. “Eden, Jeanne has been taken away.”

“Okay.” Eden also sneered.

“Eden, I knew you wouldn’t let Jeanne continue to flaunt her power.” Joshua flattered Eden. “Jeanne provoked you. She was asking for trouble.”

“I’m also doing this to help you,” Eden said in a dignified manner.

“Thank you, Eden.” Joshua was delighted. He appeared to be very excited, “Right now, Jeanne is being praised so much by the media. They say that she’s a rare dark horse in Harken’s business industry. Now, she’s being investigated for an economic crime. She’ll probably be slapped hard in the face.”

Eden sneered.

This was the effect he wanted.

He wanted to make Jeanne fall from the highest point.

He wanted her to fall to her death!

“Joshua.” Eden’s expression changed, and his tone became serious.

“Yes?” Joshua quickly agreed.

“Jeanne is very smart. Keep a close watch on the accounts and the witnesses found.”

“Don’t worry, everything has been settled.” Joshua was confident, “Moreover, I found an excuse for our financial director to look at the accounts that you gave me. He couldn’t find any clues, so most people wouldn’t be able to see through it.”

“Jeanne isn’t an ordinary person.”

“Didn’t you say that this matter would be resolved quickly? That is to say, before Jeanne even has the time to find the problem, the case would be closed. At that time, she’d be in jail. Who would she look for to seek redress?!”

“In short, you just have to be more careful,” Eden reminded Joshua worriedly.

“Alright, I’ll do whatever you want me to do. As long as you get Jeanne out of the Lawrence Enterprise and disappear from my sight, I’ll do whatever you want me to do!”

“If there’s any movement on your side, you have to tell me!”

“Understood.”

Eden put down his phone.

Originally, before the amusement park project, he had wanted to use this method to end Jeanne’s life. However, Micheal wanted to use open countermeasures to deal with her. After all, it was a matter of breaking the law, so of course, it would be better if there was a proper way. Hence, Eden chose Micheal’s method.

Despite that, Eden did not expect Jeanne to not know how to appreciate favors and to go head-to-head with them.

Now, he wanted to let Jeanne know how powerful he was!

Eden hurriedly made a call. “Ms. Sanders.”

“How did everything go?”

“Jeanne has been taken away. The evidence and witnesses are all present. She has sought personal gains of 30 million dollars. According to the laws of Harken, she’ll probably get a sentence of 10 years!”

“Alright.”Melody nodded.

“However, Ms. Sanders, you must make good use of your connections. No matter how flawless this matter is, it is, after all, made up by us. If someone investigates, they’ll find a loophole. Therefore, we still need you to use your power to make this case go to court earlier so that it can be finished earlier,” Eden said solemnly, “Also, for nearly a week, my fourth uncle won’t be around.”

“Where did he go?” Melody asked.

“I don’t know. He leaves at this time every year. No one knows where he goes. He’ll also rest for a period of time when he comes back and won’t see anyone.”

Melody was surprised.

“In short, we need to end this quickly.” Eden was used to his fourth uncle’s disappearance and did not think it was a big deal.

Melody did not think too much and said coldly, “Just do your own thing.”

“Okay.”

Melody hung up the phone.

She thought for a moment and dialed Micheal’s number.

Micheal looked at the call and frowned. He picked up the call. “Mel.”

“Jeanne has been arrested.”

Micheal pursed his lips.

He felt that everything would not go so smoothly.

“I’m just telling you. I don’t want you to help me with anything.”

“I feel that you have to be extra careful in handling this matter.”

“I know.”

“Your father has given me too much work. I won’t talk to you anymore.”

“You should develop well. When the time comes, you can help me even more.”

“Okay.”

Micheal hung up the phone.

He also refused to participate in this matter because he was too busy with work and could not take care of himself.

Micheal could help them if they did not break the law. He was not that stupid. He would not bet his future without absolute confidence.

This time, it would depend on their results.

If the results were good, Jeanne would be dealt with, and Melody would have gotten rid of her eyesore. It might even be possible for Eden to acquire Lawrence Enterprise. It was a good thing.

If the results were not good, Micheal could get a better understanding of Jeanne’s strengths. He would be more careful in the future!

At the same time, he would be glad that he did not participate in this.

…

Jeanne was brought to the examination room.

The evidence of her crime was clearly listed.

She used a dual contract to sign an agreement with the builders to replace the originally expensive construction equipment with ordinary materials, thus profiting from the huge price difference.

From the evidence provided, it seemed that there was an additional 30 million dollars in her private account.

The 30 million dollars was the money given to her by the builders.

What surprised Jeanne was that she had never used that account before, but it was opened in her name. She thought about it carefully and realized that after she entered the Lawrence Enterprise, the general department had made a payroll card for her. The payroll card was from Swanhaven Bank. Of course, all the payroll cards of the Lawrence Enterprise were from Swanhaven Bank. After all, the relationship between the Swans and the Lawrences was very different. Eden was also in charge of the operation of Swanhaven Bank. There was no way that Alexander would not take care of his son-in-law, so it was not surprising.

The so-called payroll card was with Jeanne, but because she had just joined the company, she had not received her first salary. As such, she had not managed the account situation of the card at all. She was also very sure that she had not received any account information.

Of course, these were not important.

Once someone deliberately tampered with it, she would not receive the relevant reminder.

Even if Jeanne pursued the fact that she did not receive any notification for her card, Swanhaven Bank could also let a salesperson take the blame and do a small disciplinary action, and the matter would be settled. It would not be of any help to her case and would instead be a waste of time.

Jeanne silently looked at all the materials provided in front of her.

Her brain was constantly working.

Since she was framed, she would definitely be able to find a loophole. No matter how perfect a crime was, there would eventually be a loophole. It was just that time was needed to crack it.

However, what Jeanne was worried about at the moment was that the case would be closed quickly because the Sanders had enough power.

If it was completed quickly, she would not have the time to clear her name.

“The evidence is conclusive and there are witnesses, so we’ll provide everything to the court within a week and announce the verdict. Due to the lack of time, we won’t grant you the right to be released on bail pending trial. We’ll send you to the detention center instead. Please sign here, Ms. Lawrence.” The prosecutor’s attitude was cold. He coldly placed a detention slip in front of Jeanne.

“According to Harken’s law, I can’t even hire a lawyer?” Jeanne asked calmly.

“Of course, you can,” the prosecutor replied, “It’s just that you can’t leave. The lawyer can come here to see you. As the prosecutor, I have to remind you that the facts of your crime are very obvious. I suggest that you don’t make too many excuses for yourself. Ask your lawyer to help you get a lighter punishment and plead for leniency with the judge. Otherwise, given your current situation, the outcome won’t be too good.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“Ms. Lawrence, you can sign first. After signing, I’ll arrange for the staff to be in charge of the support work for this case, including the matter of you hiring a lawyer and informing you of the specific court date. You’ll need all kinds of evidence related to the case,” the prosecutor urged impatiently.

Jeanne hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she signed her name.

She was very clear that even if she did not sign it, the other party could force her to sign it.

Not to mention, the fake contract had the same handwriting as hers, so she knew the other party could forge her signature.

Jeanne signed the document.

The prosecutor took it, “I’ve informed the police to bring you to the detention center. If anything, you can apply to the relevant person in charge of the detention center. The staff of our inspection department will also do our best to support all your legitimate needs during this period before you go to court.”

Jeanne nodded.

The prosecutor coldly took the detention form that she had signed and left.

Not long after, Jeanne was sent directly to the detention center.

She was a special criminal and was about to go to court, so she was locked in a separate room.

All the procedures seemed to have been set and only needed to be carried out step by step, so everything happened very quickly and smoothly.

Moreover, Jeanne had to admit that it was really unexpected for her.

She did not expect that the other party would fabricate such complete criminal evidence in such a short period of time.

Or... Had it been planned for a long time but was not executed because the time was not right?!
