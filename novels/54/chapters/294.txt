Chapter 295: Jeanne Stays, and Fourth Master Swan Confesses

The atmosphere in the hall was obviously a little tense.

It was a stalemate.

Jeanne did not seem to have any intention of compromising.

When she did not receive an answer from Fourth Master Swan, she said very calmly, “It’s late at night. I’ve disturbed your rest, Fourth Master. George.”

George looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne stretched out her hand. “Let’s go.”

She said it so... naturally.

Most importantly...

George really walked toward Jeanne. Jeanne held George’s hand and was about to leave right under the noses of Edward and Nox.

Nox could not understand Fourth Master Swan.

He had spent so much effort to get Ms. Lawrence to come back, and yet he was just going to watch her leave right under his nose…

“Ms. Lawrence,” Edward suddenly called out to Jeanne.

Nox knew that Fourth Master Swan had never been an easy person to talk to.

Jeanne’s heart moved slightly.

She knew it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She could not convince Fourth Master Swan with just a few words.

Just like what Fourth Master Swan had said, she did not want to cause unnecessary harm, nor did she want to implicate the innocent. As such, she stopped the moment Edward spoke.

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan.

It was as if she was waiting for him to say something.

“Ms. Lawrence, to you, are we not related in the slightest bit?” Edward asked her.

He asked her coldly.

Jeanne responded, “I apologize if I’ve caused any misunderstanding during this period, Fourth Master.”

The meaning behind her words was very clear.

At least to her, there was no relationship between them.

Edward smiled.

It seemed to be a smile, but it also felt like an illusion.

Edward suddenly stood up from the sofa.

He stood up in an imposing manner.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

At this moment, she subconsciously held George’s hand tightly.

She did not notice it, but George noticed it.

George turned his head to look at his mom.

He saw her looking at Fourth Master Swan vigilantly.

Fourth Master Swan stopped in front of Jeanne.

He looked down at her from above.

“I thought that I’ve made it obvious.” Edward’s tone was unhurried. He was staring intently at Jeanne.

“Fourth Master, you made it clear.” Jeanne admitted it and continued, “But that’s you, not me. Besides, I thought that I’ve also made it clear.”

‘I was clearly rejecting your expression of interest in me.

“So do you have to leave, Ms. Lawrence?” Edward asked Jeanne.

Jeanne answered him firmly, “I have to leave.”

“What if I just don’t let you leave?” Edward suddenly became extremely cold.

Jeanne could feel his strong aura at this moment.

Perhaps if she gave a wrong answer, she might infuriate him and lose her life here!

Despite that, the moment she faced Fourth Master Swan, she said clearly, “I’ll forcefully walk away!”

Edward’s eyes turned cold.

Jeanne had thought it through very clearly.

Before she came back here, she had thought it through.

The only way she could leave this place was to show her hand to Fourth Master Swan.

She had to make things clear.

If she wanted to use force to resist, she would not be Fourth Master Swan’s match.

“Fourth Master,” Jeanne called out to Edward, “I’m very grateful for your help during this period, but I have no other feelings for you. I also know that I won’t have any feelings for you.”

Edward’s expression was cold as he listened to Jeanne’s overly blunt words.

“If you feel that you’ve suffered a loss, I can make it up to you. I can pay you back with money, or with my body, or both. As long as you want it, I’ll give it to you,” Jeanne said openly.

Nox, who was at the side, admired Jeanne’s boldness.

“I hope that you’ll let me off.” This was a sincere request from Jeanne.

She asked Edward to let her go.

To leave his side forever.

Edward’s eyes were always on Jeanne, but he chose to remain silent.

It became too quiet at one point.

Edward asked her, “Can’t they be developed?”

Jeanne frowned slightly.

For a second, she did not get what he was saying.

“Can’t you develop feelings for me?” Fourth Master Swan repeated.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

Nox, who was at the side, felt that Fourth Master Swan, who clearly had a strong aura and a home ground advantage, became very lowly.

Ever since Nox was young, he had never seen Fourth Master Swan so humble.

Even when Fourth Master Swan was beaten until he vomited blood, no matter how much damage his body suffered, he never submitted to anyone.

At this moment, Edward had lowered his head to Jeanne.

Nox felt that if Jeanne still did not know what was good for her...

The truth was…

He could not expect anything from Jeanne.
