Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn turned around.

Their rooms were indeed next door. Moreover, Finn could not go directly to Monica’s room. He still had to put on an act as Monica’s secretary, even if he did not want to be separated from Monica for even a minute.

“I saw that you didn’t wear much, and considering it’s especially cold here in the morning and night, I bought you a scarf.” Wendy quickly took out a shopping bag.

Finn was a little surprised. “Is there a shop that sells scarves here?”

“No, I bought it in the city last night. I thought that if you didn’t wear much, the scarf would keep you warm. I was going to give it to you before dinner today, but you didn’t answer when I knocked on your door, so I didn’t have time to give it to you. Why don’t you see if you like it?”

Finn pursed his lips as he glanced at the shopping bag in Wendy’s hand.

Wendy had already taken out the black and white scarf from her shopping bag. “I don’t know why, but I think this color suits you very well.”

As she spoke, she blushed.

Finn could naturally tell what Wendy was thinking. Previously, he had thought that she was just doing her part as a host.

He said, “There’s no need. I’m not cold. You can keep it for yourself.”

“This is a men’s scarf.” Wendy was a little disappointed.

She did not expect Finn to reject him. In fact, she thought he would accept her initiative because she did not feel that he was rejecting her the last few days. “I’m sorry. I think you might have misunderstood me, ” Finn said bluntly.

He made himself clear to her.

“Is this a misunderstanding?” Wendy asked.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

Feeling a little awkward, Wendy silently put down the scarf and said, “Actually, I’ve never thought of being with you. After all, it’s not realistic to be in a long-distance relationship. I just thought that… since we get along with each other, we can…

‘Have a one-night stand or something.’ However, Wendy did not say it out loud.

She was actually more open-minded in that aspect as she had had many boyfriends. However, Finn was the first man whom she wanted to have sex with without getting any benefits from him.

Now that her hint was so obvious, she thought Finn would understand. After all, no man would reject a woman throwing herself at him. Especially since he was in a foreign country, he would not feel burdened by the idea of it.

“I don’t think I get along with you,” Finn said bluntly again.

Finn’s rejection made Wendy a little embarrassed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I have a girlfriend,” Finn said, “and we’re getting married soon.”

“You never struck me as a responsible person.” Wendy was a little embarrassed, but she still spoke her mind.

Young people would occasionally give in to their impulses and indulge in their passions, so she had never thought of taking responsibility. After all, she could not possibly lose her job and follow him to Harken.

“But I have to be responsible for myself and my girlfriend.” Finn enunciated each word.

“Is that so?” Wendy tried her best to hide her embarrassment. “Mr. Jones, you must really like your girlfriend. Otherwise, why would you keep your chastity for her in such a faraway place?”

“Yes, I like her very much.”

“In that case… I’m sorry. I’ll pretend nothing happened today. I hope it won’t affect us from working together tomorrow.” Wendy quickly returned to normal.

After all, she was a secretary, so it was easy for her to lighten the atmosphere and ease the awkvvardness.

“Alright,” Finn replied.

“It’s getting late. Mr. Jones, rest early.”

“You too,” Finn said politely.

Just as Wendy turned around and was about to return to her room, she said, “Mr. Jones, you should take the scarf. It’ll come in handy if it’s cold. After all, if you had a cold and passed it to Director Cardellini, it would be difficult for you to report back. Don’t think too much about it. Just take it as a gift from a friend.

Since I’ve bought it, there’s no use for me to keep it.”

Finn hesitated for a moment before accepting it. “Thank you.” “You’re welcome.” Wendy smiled.

Then, she returned to her room, and Finn returned to his.

Unbeknownst to him, Monica was standing at the end of the corridor, watching their interaction from afar.

She actually could not hear what they were saying. However, when she saw Finn take Wendy’s scarf, Monica did not approach Finn and immediately returned to her room.

She was only looking for Finn because she could not find her undervvear. She did not know if she had put it in Finn’s suitcase, but she could not change out of it after taking a shower..
