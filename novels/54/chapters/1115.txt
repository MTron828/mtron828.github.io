1116 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

After confirming that they were ready, Edward said into the phone, “We seem to have been discovered. Be careful.”

“Roger that.”

Edward put down the phone and looked at Kingsley. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Kingsley made a hand gesture.

Lucy and the male assassin received the order and rushed out together.

From the beginning to the end, she did not look at Kingsley, like she was not reluctant to part with him, and neither did she expect anything.

When Lucy and the assassin left, Kingsley’s hand seemed to stretch out for a moment. However, he then clenched his fist to stop himself.

He could only watch helplessly as Lucy left with the assassin. The two of them hid while leaving, but they were still discovered.

The next second, the sound of gunfire rang out around them, firing wildly at the two of them.

At the same time, the Duncans’ men, who were hiding there, quickly chased after them.

The two of them kept running forward, and the people behind him were getting closer and closer.

Lucy had been covering for the assassin behind her, trying to let him leave successfully.

Ultimately, there was a great disparity in manpower. After running for a while, Lucy and the male assassin soon felt that they were powerless.

“Ms. Harmon.” The male assassin said, “You can go first. I’ll cover for you.”

“You don’t have to.”

“I’m going to die anyway,” the male assassin said bluntly.

“Even so, I still have to die later.” Lucy’s tone was firm. “That way, Kingsley will have more time to evacuate.”

“Mr. Thorn just left you behind.” The male assassin did not want to sow discord, but in the face of death, he had nothing to fear.

“Yes,” Lucy replied.

“Why are you still working for him?” The male assassin was puzzled.

“Why are you still working for him?” Lucy asked.

“I don’t have a choice. If I don’t listen to his arrangements, I will die. In fact, I will die in a more tragic way than I am going to now.”

“Aren’t I the same?” Lucy and the assassin were running frantically.

“But now, I’ve decided to give up.” The assassin suddenly stopped.

Behind them were the people who were chasing them, and he suddenly stopped. If he stopped, he would definitely die.

Lucy did not even think about it. She immediately grabbed the assassin and continued running.

“I’ve reached my limit.” The male assassin was obviously starting to slack off. “I’m going to die anyway, so why force myself like this? Ms. Harmon, I’m not leaving.”

“Just hold on a little longer!” Lucy encouraged.

“I don’t think there’s any meaning to life anymore.” The male assassin said, “I’ll end up dead anyway.”

“But it’s different for Kingsley.”

“Kingsley has given up on us!” The assassin reminded her again.

“Isn’t that why we exist?”

“I’m not that great.” Annoyed, the assassin broke free from Lucy’s shackles.

Lucy was caught off guard and pushed away by the assassin. She even took a few steps back.

“Ms. Harmon, if you want to leave, I can cover for you. If you don’t… we’ll wait for death together.”

“I told you... Ah!” Lucy suddenly let out a low cry.

Just as she was distracted, a bullet hit her thigh.

Her legs trembled unconsciously, but she endured the pain and wanted to continue running with the assassin.

However, the assassin refused her approach.

He said, “I won’t sell my life to Kingsley anymore. I won’t!”

At that moment, he even raised his pistol and aimed it at his head.

They were going to die anyway, and either way…

“Don’t!” Lucy rushed forward and covered the man’s muzzle with her hand.

The bullet fired and pierced through Lucy’s palm. At that moment, Lucy could even think of using her other hand to press down on the assassin’s head to prevent the bullet from penetrating her palm and hitting the assassin’s head.

The assassin was still shocked by Lucy’s determination.

Just as he wanted to say something, the people chasing after them caught up.

The moment the fastest person saw their figures, he aimed the gun at the assassin’s head. However, in everyone’s eyes, that person was Kingsley, and the first person they wanted to kill was Kingsley.

When the bullet fired, Lucy suddenly stood in front of the man, and the bullet pierced through Lucy’s head.

Bang!

It was so loud that sounded like it had shattered the sky.

Just like that, Lucy could taste death.

With all her strength, Lucy said word by word, “Please, leave!”
