1020 Millie’s Tragic End

Millie deliberately focused the contradiction on Kingsley.

She knew very well that Kingsley would never agree to it. In the Hills, no one could ask Kingsley to do anything except for Jeanne.

If Lucy were to make such a request now, Kingsley would definitely be furious. However, if Lucy did not make any requests, it meant that her arrangement was right.

Anyway, whatever Lucy says would be useless.

This time, Lucy was the one who was being unreasonable, and Kingsley might even punish her for it.

Right now, she could not wait for Kingsley to get angry and lock Lucy up in the Hills’ underground prison.

She had not tortured Lucy enough last time. After all, she did not hate Lucy so much last time. If she could, she would definitely make Lucy’s life a living hell.

Lucy did not reply.

At that moment, Kingsley’s expression seemed to turn even uglier as he looked at Lucy coldly.

The moment he lost his patience, Lucy finally said, “Are you done?”

Millie was stunned.

That meant Lucy’s silence was not because she was speechless. On the contrary, she was waiting for her performance to end.

“I’m just telling the truth!” Millie said righteously.

“So, are you done telling the truth?”

“If you have something to say, say it!”

“Since you’re done, please don’t interrupt when I’m talking.” Lucy’s face darkened.

Millie did not look any better, but she held it in and said nothing.

Lucy said, “Over the years, I’ve followed Mr. Thorn to visit many assassin groups and got to know a lot of people in the assassin world. So, it just so happened that when the assassins of S Underground Organization received the news that they were going to assassinate me, someone informed me. So, when I went to carry out the mission, I made preparations in advance.”

Millie gritted her teeth.

She did not expect Lucy to be so famous in the world of assassins, and it was no wonder Lucy managed to escape.

The next time she looked for an assassin, she would have to be more careful.

However, she could not help but find it a little ironic.

Lucy was really stupid.

The assassin even came to tell her why Lucy was not killed. Was that not courting death?

“It just so happens that the other party also told me who wanted to kill me.” Lucy’s eyes suddenly narrowed.

Millie could not help but feel a little frightened, but she kept telling herself that it was impossible.

The rules of the assassin world were that no matter what or who it was, they would never give up on the person who hired the assassin.

That was the reason why she was so bold as to hire an assassin! It was because she knew that she would not be exposed.

However, at that moment, Lucy was saying it so confidently.

“Lucy, don’t you know how to lie? How could the other party have told you who wanted to kill you? We’re all assassins, and we all know the rules of the assassin world. Now, you’re saying that the other party told you who wanted to kill you? Who do you think will believe you?” Millie tried to calm herself down.

At that moment, she was certain that Lucy was deliberately tricking her to make her admit it.

What a joke. Was she, Millie, such a stupid person?

How could Lucy scare her with just a few words?!

There was still a mocking look on her face. At that moment, she even deliberately asked Kingsley, “Mr. Thorn, you know the rules of the assassin world the best. Do you think an assassin would reveal the identity of the person who hired them?!”

“An assassin wouldn’t,” Lucy answered on Kingsley’s behalf.

Millie sneered again. ‘She slapped himself in the face! What an idiot!’

“However, if I hire an assassin in advance, as the first hirer, I will naturally be able to get the information I want. This shouldn’t be considered a violation in the assassin world,” Lucy said coldly.

Millie froze.

What was Lucy talking about? What did she mean by “hiring assassins in advance as the first hirer”?

Lucy looked at Millie’s expression and explained again impatiently, “Two days before the mission, I made a deal with all the underground assassin organizations and told them to help me find the person who wanted to kill me. That was why when S Underground Organization received the order to kill me, they told me immediately and even helped me leave evidence.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Millie looked at Lucy in disbelief.

How could Lucy have known that she would find someone to kill her? How did she know?

She had never told anyone and had done everything herself, so it was impossible for her to be exposed.

Ignoring Millie’s reaction, Lucy took out her phone and played a voice message.

“Kill a person for me.” It was Millie’s voice after she had changed her voice.
