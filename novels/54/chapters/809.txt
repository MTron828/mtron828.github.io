Chapter 810: Monica Committed Suicide (Not Dead)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After a short while, a director from the airport appeared and was very respectful to Monica. He invited her to his office to explain things to her.

However, Monica rejected him outright. “Let’s talk here. If not, get me a plane ticket. Otherwise, no one can get a plane ticket today, and I won’t leave here.”

“Ms. Cardellini, please don’t make things difficult for us,” the director said nicely.

“Who’s making things difficult for you? I’m a good person. Why can’t I buy a plane ticket? Why?”

“Ms. Cardellini–”

“Monica.” A familiar male voice suddenly sounded in the airport.

In fact, many people had gathered at the scene, and because of that voice, everyone looked over to see Michael striding to Monica’s side.

Monica really wanted to kill Michael at that moment.

However, Michael was not facing her at that moment. instead, he was being very polite to the airport director. “I’m sorry to have put you in a difficult position.”

“Director Ross, you’re too kind. It’s no trouble at all.”

“I’m sorry for the trouble. Monica and I are having a little conflict. She’s angry at me and wants to leave. I was afraid something would happen to her, and that was why I told the airport to help me stop her. I’m very sorry for wasting everyone’s precious time.”

No one said anything.

After all, Michael looked sincere.

Moreover, for a dignified director to bow and apologize like that, although people would think that his actions had affected their travels, his sincerity was pretty touching.

The main point was that it did not take up much of everyone’s time.

After Michael apologized, he looked at Monica gently. “Monica, it’s my fault. Don’t be angry. I definitely won’t force you to eat meat next time. If you want to lose weight, I’ll lose weight with you.”

Monica just stared at Michael, looking at his face, which was full of love and adoration.

She laughed coldly. She really wanted to slap that hypocritical face right now.

However, just as she raised her hand, a kiss suddenly landed on her lips while her hand was firmly shackled by Michael.

At that moment, everyone’s attention was on their kiss, and no one noticed Michael’s control over her.

There was even a round of warm applause. It was as if they were celebrating the reunion of a pair of lovers.

It was such an enviable scene when, in fact, Michael was just putting on a show.

After he kissed Monica, he immediately pulled her away.

Monica resisted.

Everyone thought that she was throwing a tantrum, but no one knew how devastated Monica was at that moment or how much she wanted to kill Michael.

She frantically tried to break free from Michael’s grasp. However, other than making her wrist hurt more, she could not resist at all.

She could not stand it anymore and was about to scream when she was suddenly stunned.

Michael, too, stopped in his tracks as they ran into Finn and Nox.

The moment they saw each other at the airport, Michael tightened his grip on Monica’s hand.

Monica looked at Finn and Michael and was about to speak, but Nox suddenly asked, “Monica, are the words you say every day all nonsense?”

Monica’s eyes reddened.

“This morning, you called to say that you wanted to break up with Michael, and now you’re kissing him passionately at the airport and putting on an inseparable parting act? Why? Why are you such a drama queen?!” Qin Ci mocked coldly.

Monica’s tears blurred her vision, and she swallowed the words that were on the tip of her tongue.

“Don’t send me a wedding invitation. I won’t be coming.” Nox said, “I’ll use the money for your wedding gift to feed the dogs.”

Having been mocked by Nox, Monica kept quiet.

However, she glanced at Finn.

She really wanted Finn to reach out and give her a hand or ask her a question out of courtesy.

She refused to believe that Finn and Nox could not tell that she was currently shackled by Michael.

Nox was doing that to her because Nox did not want her to ask anyone for help. However, Finn… Was that what Finn felt as well?

He probably did because the moment she looked at Finn, he left indifferently without saying anything or looking at her.

In fact, she knew that Finn would treat her like that.
