Chapter 1604: Grand Wedding, Zoe Gets Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She looked at Nox with a pale face and saw that his eyes were red from trying to suppress his anger. It looked terrifying.

Zoe seemed to have suddenly realized something, and she quickly held Nox’s hand. “It’s not what you saw. I was framed. Someone must be jealous of us getting married, so they made so many synthesized videos to frame me. That’s not me. I wouldn’t have done these things. I wouldn’t have…”

Nox sneered and suddenly felt like he had been hit in the head. It turned out that the perfect woman in his heart could actually be so promiscuous with so many men behind his back.

How was he so confident to say that Zoe was the purest woman in the world? Was it because she bled the first time they did it?

On second thought, he was even starting to suspect whether it was fake and if he was fooled by her.

“Nox, trust me.” Zoe immediately panicked when she saw Nox’s expression.

“Believe me, I’m not that kind of person. Someone framed me…”

Tears streamed down Zoe’s face. Everything that was happening at that moment really frightened her, and she was at a loss as to what to do.

“Is that so?” Nox looked at Zoe.

Looking at her pitiful face, he said, “Among the people who came to our wedding today, some were in the video, right?”

Even with just a few casual glances, his ability to recognize people was terrifyingly accurate.

“Should we get them to come out and confront them?” Nox asked coldly.

Zoe’s face turned even paler.

Indeed, many of the men in the video had come to attend her wedding. Most of the men she fooled around with were either rich or noble, so they were naturally qualified to attend her wedding.

“I’m really the most tragic man in the world. Not only did my wife cheat on me countless times behind my back, but she also invited those cuckolds to laugh at my wedding. I’m a joke,” Nox muttered without getting angry.

According to Nox’s temper, he should have lost his temper by now, but he seemed to be suppressing his emotions instead.

“No, that’s not it… I-I was with them before but not when we got together. We-I‘ “Slap!” Nox slapped Zoe hard across the face.

The noisy crowd was suddenly stunned by Nox’s actions. Everyone held their

breath as they watched Nox slap Zoe to the ground.

Nox said, “Zoe, how stupid do you think I am to be played by you? Did you say it happened before we were together? But wasn’t it clearly written on the screen just now when and where you did those things behind my back while we were together?”

“No, no…” Zoe, who was lying on the ground, refuted, “Those were made-up. It wasn’t the actual time the video was taken—”

“That means you probably didn’t notice the time stamp on the top right corner of the video.”

Zoe was shocked. She really did not notice it, and neither should ordinary people. How did Nox notice it?

Nox said, “I think if I had been a little wary and suspicious of you, I wouldn’t have been deceived so badly! I wouldn’t have been exposed in front of the entire country that you’ve cheated on me for so long!”

Nox finally burst out with anger. In the end, he still could not take it. Angry voices resounded throughout the wedding venue, and anyone could see how badly affected Nox was.

No man would be able to accept such a thing, and Nox was no exception. Never in his dreams did he expect that he would one day be deceived so badly by a woman!

As he stared coldly at Zoe, Zoe’s family quickly went to protect Zoe, probably afraid that Nox would really hurt Zoe if she lost control of his emotions. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Mr. Sullivan rushed forward to explain to Nox, “There must be a misunderstanding. Let’s calm down and investigate the matter first. We—I‘ “Shut up!” Nox was extremely violent.

His eyes were red, but he did not say anything to Mr. Sullivan. Instead, he turned around and glared at the host, who was also dumbfounded.

Then, he roared, “Who the f*ck gave you this video?!”

Who the hell embarrassed him in front of the entire country? He wanted to kill the guy!
