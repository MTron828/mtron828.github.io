979 Autopsy Result: It Was A Set-up

Someone suddenly knocked on the door.

Monica came back to her senses and said, “Come in.”

Steve walked up to Monica and said bluntly, “The quality inspection department has released news that they will hold a press conference to announce Cardellini Enterprise’s results at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning. They will also clarify their arrangements and attitude that have been criticized regarding this matter.

“Tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.?” Monica sneered.

That was her first time looking forward to a press conference so much.

Steve was a little surprised to see Monica’s expression. Should she not be nervous?

However, Monica was now… the opposite of nervous.

Did she not care anymore because their reputation had been ruined anyway?

“Mr. Warren, can you ask the quality inspection department if Cardellini Enterprise can participate?” Monica asked bluntly.

“You’re going to the scene?”

“Why not?”

“What if the result isn’t good?”

“Are you afraid that I’ll be beaten to death?” Monica smiled.

“It’s possible,” Steve said bluntly.

“Don’t worry. My dad says I’m a curse, and a curse usually lives for a thousand years.

Steve was speechless.

“Make some arrangements for tomorrow. I’m going to the press conference.”

“Alright.” Steve nodded. “If we make a request, the quality inspection department won’t disagree. After all, it’s our results. It’s not wrong to announce it in front of us.”

“Yes.” Monica nodded.

She would like to see what the quality inspection department would do tomorrow.

In the meantime, Michael looked at the official statement from the quality inspection department and sneered.

At 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, he would make Monica so devastated that she could not even cry if she wanted to.

Suddenly, he thought of something and picked up his phone to make a call. “Can I ask if the boy’s body has been cremated?”

“Sure.”

After a while, the other party replied, “He’s been cremated.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Alright.” Michael smiled a wicked smile.

The reason why he had been holding back until now was to wait for the corpse to be cremated so that there would be no evidence.

Monica would never have thought that he would make an issue out of the test report.

After all, Monica was still too inexperienced to fight with him.

…

At 9 p.m., Monica stretched her body.

She and Steve had discussed Cardellini Enterprise’s future development for the entire day.

For example, after the test report came out tomorrow, how were they going to release the new products on the market and supply them to the hospital and pharmaceutical companies that they were originally working with?

The initial idea was to distribute the goods, which meant that they would give out the drugs first and then settle the amount after the sales. That way, no company or pharmaceutical company would reject buying from the company. However, it would cause problems in Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s capital chain.

Monica was also discussing with Steve whether they could go to the bank to get a loan.

In short, there were a lot of things that needed to be done.

Since they had almost finalized the first draft today, she got up and prepared to leave work.

However, after some thought, she gave Jeanne a call. “The quality inspection department will announce the results at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow.”

“Yeah, I saw the news.”

“Have you found the staff member?” Monica asked.

“I have.” Jeanne said bluntly, “The person who did the vaccination is a newcomer who has just been transferred here. I have his resume, but I can’t see anything wrong with it. This person must have been specially arranged by Michael.”

“How can we prove that he’s Michael’s man?”

“That’s a little more difficult.” Jeanne replied, “If it were a staff member here, they would definitely have been bribed in advance. Once they were bribed, they would leave behind evidence. The most common way is to bribe with money, which means that there would be a transaction record. Be it cash or bank transfer, it would leave traces. However, Michael is smart enough not to complicate matters. He chose to send a person over directly. Since this person is Michael’s man, Michael only needed to give him an order, and he could do anything without leaving behind any evidence.”

Jake Crawford, who secretly helped Michael at one point, was an example.

“Are we going to let Michael get away with it and escape this time?” Monica was unwilling to accept that.

She really hated Michael to the bone.

At the thought that he could sacrifice a person’s life to achieve his goal, she could not wait for him to get what he deserved!

“Given the current situation, it’s really difficult to find evidence of Michael’s crime in a short time. And once we expose the results of the quality inspection department at the press conference tomorrow, Michael will immediately react. If we don’t get the evidence to accuse Michael tomorrow, he will be able to find his scapegoat in an instant.”

In other words, if they could not find any evidence against Michael by tomorrow morning, the possibility of getting rid of Michael was basically zero!

Monica gritted her teeth to suppress all the emotions in her heart!

“Don’t lose hope just yet. Even if we can’t get any evidence against Michael this time, it will still have a huge impact on him! I’m sure that if Michael doesn’t succeed this time, the Sanders will doubt Michael’s ability. Once Michael feels that the Sanders doesn’t trust him, he will do a lot of things in a hurry for quick success. As long as he panics, he will make mistakes and reveal some clues. All of need to do is put in the effort, and we will definitely be able to find evidence of his crime!”

“So we’re just going to have to suck it up this time?”

“You can’t say that. If you expose the results of the quality inspection department in public tomorrow, even if you don’t bring Michael to justice, you can still piss him off. I don’t think Michael expected you to change so much so suddenly!” Jeanne encouraged Monica.

Nothing could be achieved overnight.

Michael was not a simple person, to begin with, people who were not simple were even more difficult to deal with.

It was too difficult for Monica to deal with the big boss as soon as she stepped into the industry.

“It’s all because of your help,” Monica did not dare to take all the credit. “If it weren’t for you, I don’t know how many times Michael would’ve done me over.”

“In that case, learn more.”

“Alright, Sister Jeanne.” Monica agreed.

She did not want to burden Jeanne too much. In fact, everything Jeanne had done had exceeded her expectations.

As for Michael, she believed that God was watching him!

Those who were good would be rewarded, and those who were evil would be punished. It was only a matter of time!
