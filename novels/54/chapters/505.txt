“In that case, can we do it tomorrow? Today...” She had to chase Patsy Away first.

“Okay, I’ll come and get you tomorrow.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

“Monica,” Michael called out to her.

Monica looked at him.

“Thank you so much.”

“We’re friends. It’s nothing.” Monica smiled.

Michael also smiled and said, “I’ll see you.”

“Okay.”

With that, Michael left without pestering her.

In Monica’s heart, Michael would not pester her, and he would not do anything that would make things difficult for her too.

However, the more he did that, the more guilty she felt.

Forget it.

......

One day, Michael would find a better woman.

Then, she looked down at her phone and realized it had been ten minutes, which meant she had to go back.

At that moment, she walked a little faster with her crutches.

When she walked into the ward, her heart was still beating fast.

While she pushed the door open, she thought that if she saw what Finn and Patsy were doing, she would... beat Patsy to death!

With that thought in mind, she gritted her teeth and pushed the door open to see that Finn was the only one in the room.

Where was Patsy? Had she gone to take a shower? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She did not hide her wandering gaze as she looked in the direction of the bathroom.

“She’s left.” Finn knew what Monica was thinking when he saw her expression.

Monica was a little surprised. “She left?”

Finn nodded.

“Why did she leave?” Monica asked.

Logically speaking, Patsy would visit Finn once every two to three months, and she would stay for a day or two each time.

She guessed that Patsy was either here to accompany Finn to bed or to ask for money from Finn. Anyway, according to her past behaviors, she would not leave so soon.

“You don’t want her to leave?”

“It’s not that,” Monica flatly denied.

She wished that Patsy had never come to visit.

“Come here.” Finn waved.

Monica limped to Finn’s side and climbed onto his bed.

She could crawl very smoothly now, and Finn seemed to have gotten used to Monica’s intimacy during this time.

“Patsy and I are family,” Finn said.

Stunned, Monica raised her head to look at him. She did not expect Finn would suddenly explain the situation to her.

“Patsy is my childhood friend who grew up in the orphanage. She’s younger than me, and because she hasn’t been well since she was young, the others in the orphanage always bullied her. So, I would take care of her a little.”

Monica listened quietly.

“In a place like an orphanage, it gets pretty lonely for every child. So, once they decided on someone, they’d rely on them. Patsy relies on me a lot,” Finn said, “and I take care of her like a little sister. She doesn’t actually think of me the way you do. At most, she’ll think you’ve snatched me away from her. After all, in Patsy’s world, I’m her only family, and she’s afraid I’ll abandon her.”

“I’m also afraid you’ll abandon me.” Monica pouted.

Finn was stunned for a second.

Monica said unhappily, “You have no idea how sad I was back then. When I saw you and Patsy... Finn, even if you take good care of Patsy, you can’t take care of her in bed. That is wrong!”

She even said it righteously and indignantly.

Finn was a little speechless. “So you didn’t believe me when I said I didn’t sleep with Patsy?”

“How can I believe you?” Monica glared at him. “How can I? She was lying naked on your bed, and your hands were on her body... Sob...”

Monica’s eyes suddenly turned red, and her heart ached like hell.

She had said she would not be bothered about Finn and Patsy.

After all, those two had already hooked up before she met Finn. To put it bluntly, she might be the mistress.

However, when she thought about it, she started to become petty again.

She still could not accept Finn having an affair with another woman. She still felt terrible.

“I swear I’ve never slept with Patsy,” Finn confirmed again. “Patsy was lying on my bed because I did plastic surgery on her.”

“Huh?” Monica was stunned and utterly dumbfounded.

She looked at Finn, who said, “Do you know about breast augmentation?”

In fact, it was not just breast augmentation. There were many more secrets he could not say out loud.

“...Aren’t you a cardiologist?” Monica was surprised.

“I know a lot,” Finn replied.
