1232 Their Conflict and Jeanne’s Compromise

After all, she was only 19 years old when she gave birth to George. At 19 years old, she knew nothing, and the group of assassins also knew nothing.

Edward did not ask any further. After all, it was a sensitive topic.

Eventually, the two of them were immersed in choosing the milk powder again, and no one said another word.

After a long time, they had probably finished reading the formula and introduction of the milk powder. In fact, they might even have read it through several times. The more they read, the more difficult it was for them to make a decision.

Jeanne asked bluntly, “Which one is the most expensive?”

Edward was taken aback. Then, he pointed at two of them and said, “These two are the most expensive. They were about the same price.”

“In that case, shall we choose from these two? If you can’t tell which is better, we’ll decide by price.”

Edward nodded in agreement. “Which one should we choose?”

“This one.” Jeanne pointed at a pink one. “I’m attracted by the packaging.”

Edward smiled. “Alright.”

The milk powder was selected.

Following that, they followed Jeanne’s method of looking at the price and the appearance. Soon, everything that the baby needed was settled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After choosing, Jeanne was also a little tired. Therefore, she stood up and prepared to leave.

Sometimes, she was also afraid of dealing with things that would make her emotional. She was afraid that she would be reluctant to leave.

Just as she had gotten up, Jeanne could not help but cry out in a low voice, “Ah!”

Edward was tidying up the things that they had chosen when he heard Jeanne’s voice. He hurried over. “What’s wrong?”

His panic was obvious.

Although he could pretend that he was slowly learning to let go of his feelings for her, once something happened to her, his disguise would be removed immediately.

“The baby kicked me! Ah!” Jeanne called out again.

Moreover, the baby had kicked a little too hard.

When she was pregnant with George, she did not pay much attention to the baby, perhaps because she was working. Hence, she did not seem to have felt George kicking her like that. Sometimes, she even forgot about George’s existence. She was really too young at that time and did not know what a so-called mother meant.

Her relationship with George only started later on after George was born and when she watched him grow up day by day, watching him smile at her and call her ‘mommy’.

It was unlike the one now, whom she had developed a maternal love for when she was pregnant, even if she did not want it. That was why she had been very careful with this pregnancy.

Although she had almost sacrificed her daughter for her revenge back then, once she was out of danger, she decided that she would really make it up to her daughter.

Now, the baby’s kick made her heart skip a beat. It did not hurt, but she was afraid that if she moved too much, the baby would be uncomfortable.

Was that a sign of hypoxia that came during the third semester of pregnancy?

“Sit down.” Edward supported her and sat her down.

Jeanne did not refuse and sat down on the sofa, trying to relax.

Edward’s large hand gently caressed her stomach. With Edward’s comfort, the baby in her stomach seemed to have quietened down.

“Baby, be good. Don’t kick your mommy.” Edward’s gentle voice was directed at her round belly.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

In fact, it was not as if she had never seen Edward’s gentle side. She just had never seen such a gentle look on Edward’s face before.

She even wondered how much Edward would dote on that daughter of his in the future.

“Are you feeling better?” Seemingly having felt the silence in her stomach, Edward raised his head to ask.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“She still seems to be moving.” Edward could clearly feel the baby in her stomach moving from time to time.

However, the movements were gentle, as if she was expressing to them that she existed.

“She’s probably awake now.” Jeanne smiled.

“Do all babies move like this when they wake up?” Edward asked, his hand leaving her stomach as he sat beside her.

“More or less.” Jeanne nodded. “I’ll be scared if she doesn’t move for a long time. But if she moves too much, I’ll be scared too.”

“Is there a need to watch out for that too?”

“Yes.”

“It must be tiring,” Edward suddenly said.

“It’s alright,” Jeanne replied.

The conversation between the two of them was neither hot nor cold.

They were not intimate, but they were not distant either. However, with their distance maintained, they chatted for a long time, which was rare.

It was the first time they had talked for so long since the last time they had made everything clear to each other.
