Candice did not answer Nox.

She returned to Edward’s side and whispered, “How are you? Are you drunk?”

“I’m alright.” Edward smiled dotingly.

However, she could tell from his eyes that he was a little drunk.

“Can you two stop being so lovey-dovey?” Nox was speechless.

“We’re very lovey-dovey too.” Zoe hugged Nox’s arm intimately.

Nox smiled smugly. “That’s right, I’m not single. By the way, where are the two single people?”

“They’ve all left,” Candice answered.

“F*ck! Isn’t that too much of them?!” Nox was furious. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Just drink your wine. Why do you care?” Edward lectured.

“Alright, let’s drink!” Nox picked up the wine glass and started to pester Edward to drink.

They drank until it was past 10 p.m. By then, Nox was drunk and lying on the dining table in Bamboo Garden. Edward was also drunk, and although he was not as drunk as Nox, he had drunk more than usual.

Candice supported Edward and said to Zoe, who did not drink much, “I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Nox.”

“Okay, just take good care the Leader. You can leave Nox with me,” Zoe quickly said, making herself seem like a good fiancee.

Candice nodded before she helped Edward upstairs. As Edward was a little unsteady on his feet, it took Candice a lot of effort to help Edward onto the bed.

Once he was on the bed, he pulled Candice down with him, and the two of them rolled onto the bed together. Candice was pinned down by Edward, whose eyes looked a little hazy.

That was Candice’s first time seeing him drunk. She thought that as the Leader of a country, he would be more disciplined. However, he ended up getting drunk with Nox.

Candice’s heart raced because, at that moment, Edward suddenly approached her. She naturally knew what he wanted to do because he wanted it… almost every night. However, she could not take it anymore.

Just then, someone knocked on the door. Startled, Candice quickly pushed

Edward away, and because Edward was drunk, he immediately fell to his side.

Candice quickly got up from the bed. She took a deep breath, tidied her clothes, and opened the door.

Teddy said respectfully, “Madam, this is the hangover pill for Fourth Master.”

“Alright, thank you.” Candice remained calm.

She took the pill from Teddy.

“This is the medicine that your father just sent over. He said you have to take it every day.” Teddy handed Candice a box of pills.

“Alright.” Candice nodded.

“Well, if Fourth Master doesn’t feel well, you can call me anytime.” Teddy said worriedly, “Fourth Master hasn’t been this drunk in a long time.”

“Alright.”

“In that case, I won’t disturb you.”

With that, Teddy left, and Candice returned to the room.

In the room, Edward was not sleeping well.

She placed the pill at the head of the bed and went over to help Edward sit up.

She said, “Edward, you will feel better after having a hangover pill.”

Edward opened his eyes and stared straight at Candice as if he could see through her completely.

She found it unbelievable how Edward looked at her sometimes.

“Ah… Open your mouth.” Candice placed the pill by his lips.

Edward, however, did not open his mouth.

“Edward, open your mouth.”

Edward continued to stare at her, not moving an inch. His eyes seemed to be mixed with thousands of emotions. It was as if… he truly loved her.

In fact, she did not know why Edward had feelings for her. Considering they had not been together for long, what exactly was it about her that attracted him so much?

Candice looked at Edward’s expression helplessly. She had no choice but to drink a mouthful of the water with the pill, move closer to Edward’s mouth, and fed him the pill and water.

At that moment, Edward’s eyes seemed to flicker, and his long eyelashes trembled.

He lowered his eyes and looked at the person in front of him moving closer to him intimately and kissing him little by little.

Was it a kiss? There seemed to be a bitter taste between his lips and teeth.

Nevertheless, he held the back of Candice’s head with his big hand and deepened the kiss between them.

Candice did not react at all. She was simply feeding him the hangover pill, not…

“Oh.”
