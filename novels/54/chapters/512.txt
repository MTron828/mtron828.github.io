Chapter 513: The Plot Begins, Monica Admits to Her Mistake!!

Monica really did not want to lie to him.

However, seeing Michael’s expectant gaze at that moment, she nodded in the end. “Uncle, don’t worry. I’ll take good care of Michael. You can rest in peace.”

Liam nodded in relief.

He looked frail like he could not hold on for much longer anymore.

Michael quickly placed the oxygen mask on his father’s face and asked the nurse to help him adjust the bed down.

With the bed down, only the sound of Liam’s heavy breathing echoed throughout the entire ward.

After some time, Liam seemed to have fallen asleep.

Michael whispered to Monica, “I’ll send you back.”

Monica turned to look at Michael and nodded before they left together.

As they left, Monica felt an indescribable pain in her heart.

She had no idea what Michael had been going through, and she even proposed a breakup.

She quietly regulated her emotions, thinking that one day, everything would pass.

......

When Monica was in Michael’s car again, she said, “If it’s convenient for you, send me home. I need to go and pack some things.”

Michael nodded.

After coming out of the ward, he looked upset, and Monica felt sorry for him.

She said, “I didn’t expect your dad’s condition to be so serious.”

“Actually, it’s been a long time coming,” Michael said as he drove, “The doctor suggested euthanasia, but... my mom couldn’t accept it. She didn’t want my dad to leave, and my dad didn’t seem to want to leave us either, so he kept–”

Michael choked up a little.

While Monica listened, she also felt sad, but she bit her lips and did not say anything else.

When the car stopped at Monica and Finn’s garage, Monica got out of the car, and Michael handed her a walking stick.

Monica said, “Michael, I’ll get my chauffeur to pick me up later. You should head back first and accompany your father. I think your father...”

‘Could hold on much longer.’

However, Monica did not say it out loud.

Michael only nodded in response.

Monica wanted to say more, but she felt it was useless to say anything now. With that, she looked at Michael and then left. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As Michael stared at Monica’s cold silhouette, his expression turned ferocious.

How could Monica not be moved by him? Even if she sympathized with him, would she not give him more of her?

No. As long as he held on to what he wanted, he would never fail.

…

Monica went home and packed a few clothes and a lot of underwear for Finn.

Every time she took his underwear, she found it funny and erotic. The thought of how Finn actually... lost it aroused her.

Once she packed up, she called the chauffeur at home to pick her up.

When the chauffeur arrived, he helped her to carry her things and walked into the garage with her.

In the garage, the car that sent her there had yet left.

She pursed her lips and had the chauffeur get into the car first before she walked over.

She knocked on Michael’s glass window for quite some time until Michael finally winded down the window.

The moment Monica saw Michael’s red eyes, she swallowed the words she was about to say.

She never thought that a man like Michael would cry, and it made her a little uncomfortable.

She said, “Michael, I...”

Monica had been holding herself back from comforting Michael. Yet, as soon as she wanted to, nothing came out of her mouth.

He and Monica stared at each other for a long time.

Suddenly, Michael opened the car door.

Monica’s throat moved slightly.

She knew very well that she should not be by Michael’s side at that moment. Michael may be sad and need someone to accompany and comfort him, but it should not be her.

However, she watched as Michael get closer to her and hug her in his arms.

Monica was stunned.

As Michael buried his head in her neck, she could feel the touch of his warm skin.

She gritted her teeth but did not push Michael, who was crying, away.

At that moment, she did not know what to do other than hug him stiffly and feel his sadness.
