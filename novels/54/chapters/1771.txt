“I hope I can develop further in the company.” Benjamin asked, ‘What about you? How are you doing?”

“I’m fine too,” Shelly replied, not knowing how really to respond.

“Are you with Nox?” Benjamin asked.

Shelly pursed her lips and nodded.

Although they were breaking up in a month, they were indeed together at the moment.

“Nox really likes you. I didn’t want to admit it before, but now that I think about it, he really does treat you well,” Benjamin commented objectively.

Shelly only nodded, not too enthusiastic.

“Hey, what are you two whispering about here?”A man suddenly came over and grabbed Benjamin’s shoulder. It was obvious he did not want the two of them to play without him.

“Nothing. We haven’t seen each other for a long time and were just chatting.”

“A casual chat?” The boy said meaningfully, ” Back then, you chased Shelly very closely. Why? Do you want to continue with your chase now?”

“What nonsense are you spouting?!” Benjamin was obviously angry. “Shelly has a boyfriend.”

“So what if she has a boyfriend? They could still break up.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Alright. Drink your wine.”

“Look, you’re just feeling guilty. Benjamin, you’re outstanding. Do you have a girlfriend? Have you been with a foreign girl? What is it like? Hurry up and tell your brother.” The boy was a little drunk, so he spoke without restraint.

Benjamin glanced at Shelly.

He was afraid she would be embarrassed if she heard this.

Shelly was indeed a little uncomfortable and lowered her head, pretending to be eating.

Benjamin replied, “I don’t even have time to do scientific research in school. How would I have time to find a girlfriend? No, I’m still single.”

“You’re still single?” The boy was surprised. Then, he suddenly said loudly, “Ladies and gentlemen, our top student, Benjamin, is still single. Everyone has a chance!”

Everyone burst into laughter, leaving Benjamin a little awkward.

He picked up a glass of wine and drank a few glasses with the boy before shooing him away.

Before the boy left, he did not forget to say, “Do you know what’s most likely to happen to your classmate? Breaking up a pair was a pair. Seize the opportunity! ”

It was obvious he was reminding Benjamin to chase after Shelly.

However, Benjamin ignored him.

Soon, the boy felt bored and went to another crowd to drink.

Benjamin quickly explained, “Don’t listen to his nonsense. Sometimes, when a guy is drunk, he will be like this and not know his limits. Don’t take it to heart.”

“It’s nothing. I’m used to it after working at the nightclub.”

“Well, just ignore what he said.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded and looked at Benjamin. ‘You don’t have a girlfriend yet?”

She did not know why, but when she heard that Benjamin was single, her heart beat irregularly.

Of course, she did not think there would be any development between her and Benjamin, nor would there still be a possibility between them.

However, she could not help but care.

She thought that even if they were friends, it was not a big deal to ask.

Benjamin smiled and said, “I’ve been really busy overseas. I don’t even have time to make friends. Besides, foreign girls are too unrestrained. I really can’t accept it. Perhaps I’m traditional, but I still prefer the girls from Harken.” Shelly nodded. She did not know what to say.

“Well, you should eat more and relax. These people are crazy when they’re drunk. Just let them have fun. I’ll head over there now,” Benjamin said.

They probably did not want to be too awkward with each other, so they did not say much and planned to leave.

“Alright. Go ahead.”

With that, Benjamin walked away from Shelly.

After leaving, Benjamin turned back to look at Shelly.

Sometimes, it was not easy to let go of a person.

His throat moved slightly as he walked to the side and drank with the others.

The class reunion was to start with dinner.

After, they started singing.

Drunk, many people were howling. The sound system was so loud that even Shelly could not withstand it, even though she used to work at a nightclub in the past. Having not been to such a place for so long, she found it hard to adapt.

So, she got up and went to the bathroom in the private room to catch her breath, not knowing that the bathroom door was unlocked..
