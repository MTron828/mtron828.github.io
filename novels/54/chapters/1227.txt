1228 Learning To Forget About Each Other

As Edward listened to George, the corners of his mouth curled into a smile. He was smiling to cover up his emotions

That was the first time he had cried in front of his son, and his son found out. This time, he could not expose himself no matter what.

As expected, genetics was magical.

The two of them had the same habits and behavior. He was very afraid of others seeing his cowardice, and his son was the same.

He touched George’s head and said, “So, were you convinced by Grandpa?”

“Yes.” George nodded. “Although I’m still unwilling, I don’t want to be a burden to you.”

“What?”

“You’ll still let mom come back to us, right?” George asked carefully.

Edward chose to remain silent.

“Just like last time, you said you’d bring my mother back, and you really did. This time, you’ll get back on good terms with mom, right?” Ultimately, George was still hopeful.

He had high hopes for his father as he always thought his father could do anything.

“George,” Edward replied, “I can’t promise you that.”

The previous time, he thought that he could change everything, not expecting that Jeanne would be the daughter of the Sanders. Hence, he could tell George with certainty that he would definitely bring Jeanne back.

However, he did not dare to promise George this time.

Edward’s words made George, who had recovered from his sadness, have tears in his eyes again.

Edward said, “Although men can cry, they can’t cry all the time.”

George bit his lip.

“Become stronger in the future. Don’t fail to protect your own woman,” Edward said casually, However, nobody would have imagined that when he said these words, there was so much sadness hidden within.

He stood up and looked down at George.

“Let’s go.”

George looked at Edward.

Once his father stood up, he had to raise his head high to look at him.

He had always thought that his father was omnipotent and could carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, so he would never want to see the day when his father fell!

George gritted his teeth and took the initiative to hold his father’s hand. His father’s fingers trembled for a moment, but he eventually held his hand.

George did not what would happen in the future or how complicated the adult world was.

However, he hoped that one day, he would be strong enough to stand by his father’s side and carry the weight of the world on his shoulders with his father!

…

George was sent away again, and without George, the house seemed even quieter.

Even if Edward was around and spent time with Jeanne every day during this period of time, the two of them did not interact much but did not have any conflicts either. It was as if two unrelated guests were living under the same roof. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Time would sometimes pass by very quickly, and other times when they wished it would slow down, it would quietly slip away.

Finn came to the villa to give Jeanne a checkup again. Now that she was in the late stage of her pregnancy, the checkups would be more frequent than before.

It had only been half a month since the last time, and Jeanne was lying in the ultrasound room at home.

While Finn gave her an ultrasound, Edward sat there, accompanying her quietly.

“The baby’s growth these few days isn’t obvious.” Finn said, “Compared to the last time, the baby doesn’t seem to have gained much weight.”

“I’ve been eating the same,” Jeanne replied.

“Logically speaking, this should be the period when the baby is gaining weight the fastest.”

“I’ll take note to eat more.”

“Don’t be too indulgent. Try to eat lesser meals.”

“Alright.”

“After the check-up, we’ll draw a blood sample for the final major checkup.”

“Sure,” Jeanne agreed.

“Why do I feel like you two aren’t in a good mood today?” Finn seemed to have noticed something.

“No.” Jeanne smiled. “I just saw the baby last time, so it’s nothing new. Besides, I don’t really understand the ultrasound pictures.”

“Is that so?” Finn glanced at Edward.

He did not seem to believe Jeanne.

However, Edward did not seem to react either, and that man would not say anything if he did not want to.

After the ultrasound examination, Jeanne got out of bed.

It was rare that Edward did not help her up, so Finn just looked at them quietly.

It turned out their silent treatment had not ended.

“You seem to be in a good mood these days.” Jeanne wiped the gel off her body and asked as she looked at Finn.

Finn came back to his senses, and he did not know how to answer her statement.
