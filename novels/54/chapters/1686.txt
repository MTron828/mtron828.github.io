“I’ll have you know that even if Bella is your biological daughter, human trafficking is a crime! As long as I call the police, you’ll be arrested immediately!” Shelly shouted at their backs.

Upon hearing that, Katie and her husband stopped in their tracks.

Her husband’s expression was ugly. “Who do you think you are? What right do you have to interfere in our family’s matters? Believe it or not, I will beat you to death?”

“Go on!” Shelly said fiercely, “Even if you kill me, it’s a life for a life! I’m all alone anywvay. I’m not afraid of death!”

“You!” Katie’s husband was livid, and his veins were bulging, making him look very ferocious.

“I’ll count to three.” Shelly took out her phone.

In fact, her phone was already out of battery. However, her acting looked real.

“If you don’t tell me where Bella has been sent to, I’ll call the police immediately!”

“How dare you!”

“What do I have to be afraid of?” Shelly was determined.

Katie’s husband felt a little scared when he saw Shelly getting serious, so he turned to look at Katie, who was also threatened by Shelly.

Her eyes reddened as she said, “Shelly, we had no choice. My youngest son has been diagnosed with leukemia, and we need a large sum of money. I had no choice but to hand Bella over to someone else. Don’t worry, the other party’s family is very good. They won’t mistreat Bella!”

“Didn’t you sell the land for a lot of money? Can’t you use that money to treat your son’s illness?” Shelly roared.

Katie’s actions truly shattered her worldview!

“I need that money too. Shelly, I have three sons. Don’t I have to leave them some money? Otherwise, how can they get married in the future? I know you grew up in a big city, but that’s the tradition where we come from. Only sons can carry on the family line. Bella will get married sooner or later, so wouldn’t it be the same if we sent her away earlier? Weren’t you sent away like that too?

“Look at how good your life has been since you left our hometown. You’ve become much prettier, and you have a house in the city. Although we’re selfish, we’re doing this for Bella’s good!”

Shelly could not take it anymore. How long would it take those people to change their mindset of favoring sons over daughters? Were women so worthless to them?

She said, “I don’t want to waste my breath on you or hear any explanations from you. Your explanations disgust me! Right now, all I want to know is who you gave Bella to and where you sent her! If you don’t tell me, I’ll make the call!”

As she spoke, she was about to make a call.

“Shelly!” Katie quickly went forward to stop her.

Shelly waved her hand and dodged.

“Shelly! I actually don’t know where Bella has been taken to!” Katie was so flustered that she finally admitted it.

Shelly’s face turned cold.

“I was introduced through an intermediary. After that, I went straight to South Hampton City, and that was where Bella was sent away. The other party said he was afraid that we would look for her in the future, so he gave me the money without leaving any information. I’m not lying to you. I really don’t know where Bella is!” Katie’s eyes were red. “Even if you call the police now, there’s nothing I can say. Please, can you let me go? I’m really not doing well!”

While speaking, Katie suddenly knelt in front of Shelly. There were not many people coming and going in the wee hours of the morning, but there were still a few people who looked over. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“My life is very difficult as it is, and I don’t have any source of income. Now that our youngest son is sick, none of the in-laws are willing to give us money to treat our youngest son, and neither is our family. Don’t you know how our family treats us? They don’t see us as their daughters at all. Now that I’m married, I’m part of someone else’s family, and Mom and Dad will never care about me. Have they come to visit you all these years? For all you know, they might’ve forgotten about you! ”

Shelly suppressed her emotions and glared at Katie.

“Shelly, my hands are tied. I had no choice but to let Bella save my son’s life. No matter what, if I sold Bella, Bella would still be able to live a good life. But if I didn’t, my youngest son would die. Please understand my situation!” Katie’s eyes were filled with tears and she stared at Shelly..
