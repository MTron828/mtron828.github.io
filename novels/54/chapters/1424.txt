Thank you readers!

As soon as he finished speaking, his entire body pressed down on Candice. “I’m so evil… You can’t do anything for George…”

‘You’re not making it impossible for me to do anything for George. You’re making it impossible for me to do anything.’

Candice twisted her body and resisted.

Edward just wanted to hug Candice a little longer. He was very satisfied last night, so he did not plan to do anything to her that morning.

Therefore, rather than saying the two of them were doing something inappropriate under the covers, it was more like the two of them were flirting like a couple.

How sweet!

Candice looked up at the time. “Stop fooling around.”

She was baffled as to how the leader of a country could have such a childish side. No, he was not childish. He was really horny. In bed, Candice always felt that he was sexier than her.

“I really have to go make breakfast for George.” Candice pushed Edward away, panting.

Although Edward was reluctant, he still compromised.

“Sleep in a little longer.”

With that, Candice left the bed, and Edward stared at her silhouette, that familiar silhouette.

Candice went to the open kitchen to prepare breakfast.

Recently, she had been researching many different types of breakfast and learning from Teddy what George liked to eat, which made her more motivated to cook for him.

Since she was a little late today, she had to move a little faster. She took out the batter that she had prepared yesterday and made some pancakes.

Yesterday, George really did not come out of his room, so he did not have any cake. In that case, she would make up for it with some pancakes today.

Candice plated the pancakes seriously before placing the plate on the dining table. Just as she was about to ask Teddy to wake George up, she saw George coming down the stairs.

Candice quickly took off her apron so that George would not find out that she was the one who made it. She was even more careful with George than with Edward.

George was surprised to see Candice in the living room. For a long time, he did not see Candice in the morning, but at that moment, he saw her again.

After last night’s awkwardness, George was still unfriendly today.

Candice calmly went to get a glass of warm water and said, “I got drunk last night, so my throat is dry.”

It meant that she was down so early to drink some water.

George did not take it to heart and walked straight to the dining table. However, the moment he walked past Candice, his eyes paused. As he had always been observant since he was young, he immediately noticed the traces of white flour on Candice’s face.

He turned to look at the pancakes on the table and seemed to understand something at that moment. However, he bit his lips and said nothing.

Candice did not want George to notice anything, so she went upstairs.

By then, George was already sitting at the dining table. He looked at the noodles in front of him but did not move his utensils.

“Don’t you like pancakes?” Teddy asked George.

Logically speaking, George had never been picky about food. Besides, George liked pancakes. Why was he not eating it?

George said, “Teddy, did she make this?”

Teddy was stunned. Sometimes, George was so smart that it was too difficult for them to lie to him.

“She’s actually quite good to you.” Teddy sighed.

George hesitated.

“She’s actually the one who has been making breakfast for you recently. Every day, she will make you a variety of dishes and won’t repeat it for at least half a month,” Teddy said.

George remained unmoved.

“She celebrated your birthday yesterday too…” Teddy stopped halfway through his sentence.

After all, George was different from Paige. His obsession with Jeanne ran deep, and saying too much would only add to George’s burden.

He walked over and picked up the plate of pancakes in front of George. “I’ll make it for you again.”

“No need,” George suddenly said.

Teddy was stunned.

“There’s no need to trouble you, Teddy. I’m going to be late for school,” George explained. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Teddy quickly put down the plate. At that moment, he was even a little emotional even though George used such an excuse.

“In that case, try it. How does it taste? If you need more maple syrup, let me know. ”

“Alright.” George nodded.

Then, he ate the pancakes with very good manners while Teddy stood at the side, looking gratified.

Actually, George was not as cold as he appeared, and he could feel Candice’s sincerity..
