Once she took the initiative, she would be eaten alive!

In South Hampton City, the night sky was filled with neon lights.

Finn left Bamboo Garden and went straight to Monica’s neighborhood. He sat in the small car and looked at the building where Monica lived.

Candice said that he should use the same method that Monica had used on him in the past to get Monica back.

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at the supper in the passenger seat. Tonight, Monica had barely eaten anything. He did not know if she had eaten after she came back..

He took a deep breath, unbuckled his seatbelt, and was about to get out of the car with his supper when he saw a familiar figure at the entrance of the residential area.

At that moment, he stopped what he was doing and watched as Monica walked out from the entrance of the residential area with Brandon beside her. Brandon was pushing a huge suitcase, and the two of them looked very intimate.

They did not notice his existence at all as they walked toward another black car.

Meanwhile, Finn just stared at them. Then, he suddenly opened the car door and rushed over.

Brandon was passing his luggage to the driver when he saw Finn suddenly appear in front of him. At that moment, he instinctively protected Monica behind him.

That action had angered Finn. Just as he stepped forward and was about to pull Brandon away, he heard Monica shout, “Finn! What are you doing?”

Finn clenched his fists. “Where are you going?!”

“Do I need to tell you where I’m going?”

“Where are you going?” Finn enunciated his words as he suppressed his emotions.

“Finn, we’ve broken up, and whatever I want to do is my business! I don’t need to explain it to you.”

Finn’s expression turned even uglier. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica did not want to waste her breath on Finn, so she pulled

Brandon along. “Let’s get in the car.”

Brandon looked at Finn warily before turning around and getting into the car with Monica.

The moment the car door opened, Finn slammed the door shut. Monica’s eyes narrowed, and she looked at Finn coldly. “What do you want?!”

“Can’t you give me more time to prove to you that I really love you?

“Why should I give you time to prove it?” Monica asked.

Finn was stunned.

“Why should I waste my time on you?” Monica said, “What is it about you that is worth me wasting my time on?

“Have I become so despicable to you now?

“Yes.” Monica said, “Previously, I was just disappointed, but now, I find you shameless! To be honest, I miss how cruel you were when we divorced. At that time, no matter what I did to you, you refused to accept me. No matter how much pain I was in, you remained indifferent to me. Even though I was upset about it, deep down, I still admired you. How cold-blooded must you be to push away a woman who loved you so much?”

Finn clenched his fists, obviously suppressing his emotions.

Back then, he had indeed given up on Monica. He was determined that he would never be with Monica again in his life, so he treated Monica in the most heartless way possible.

As expected, he had to pay for what he had done. The crueler he was to Monica back then, the less hope Monica had in him now.

His eyes were bloodshot as he heard Monica ask him, “Where did that Finn go?”

“Do you think that Finn was happy back then?” Finn asked her.

Monica’s eyes flickered.

“All you know is that I heartlessly pushed away a woman who loved me so much, but have you ever thought about why I could do that?! ” Finn questioned her.

Monica’s heart suddenly ached.

“Have you ever thought about how terrible I felt treating you that way? Have you ever thought about what I went through that made me so indifferent to you? Monica, you think I don’t love you enough or give you much, but what did I get? You’ve abandoned me time and time again, but did I abandon you after our first breakup? Did I give up on you after the divorce? Is it still me this time?”
