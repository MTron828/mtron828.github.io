Chapter 1777: Shelly Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Sarah’s eyes widened as Brandon suddenly hugged her and kissed her fiercely. He felt a little unhappy because he did not like Sarah’s coldness and rejection toward him.

Sarah, too, was shocked by Brandon’s actions. Brandon was usually lukewarm toward her, but now that he was forcing himself on her like that… Her eyes narrowed, and she bit Brandon’s mouth, causing Brandon to let go of Sarah in pain. He was also a little angry for a moment.

“Slap!” Sarah slapped Brandon hard on the face.

Brandon was stunned by Sarah’s slap. Sarah did not expect herself to be so angry either, but she really hated Brandon for forcing himself on her like that.

“Can’t you learn to respect others?” Sarah scolded Brandon angrily.

Brandon could feel the burning pain on his face, and the slap had indeed made him a little angry.

Hence, he said loudly, “Isn’t it normal for couples to kiss each other and sleep together?”

“Do you think I’m your girlfriend? We’ve been dating for so long, but what have you done for me? Do you think taking responsibility for sleeping together while we were drunk is enough? Brandon, nothing in this world comes easy!”

“Sarah, what are you trying to say?”

“Let’s break up!” Sarah said firmly. “I’ve had enough of you. Every time I call you and want to see you, you’re busy. And every time I want to have a meal with you, you’re busy. You even forgot my birthday, and you think you can apologize when you realize you forgot? Brandon, who do you think you are? Why should I sit around and wait for you?

“All we did was sleep together. Nowadays, a one-night stand is nothing! I don’t need you to take responsibility for me!”

Brandon was a little embarrassed by what Sarah said. After all, Sarah was right. They had been dating for a long time, but he had been really busy. It was rare for the two of them to be alone.

Sarah said, “That’s it. I’m tired too, so let’s just be friends from now on.”

“Yes, I haven’t been doing well and fulfilling my responsibilities as a boyfriend. But in my defense, I’ve been really busy. With Monica not around, I have to help her with her work. I really can’t spare any time…”

“If you can’t find the time, don’t. You should just focus on your work and not fall in love,” Sarah said bluntly.

Brandon’s face turned red with anger. Did Sarah mean that someone like him was not worthy of being in a relationship? There were so many busy people in the world. Were they all not worthy of falling in love, getting married, or even having children?

“Can you not be so unreasonable?” Brandon could not take it anymore. “Everyone has to work, unlike you, who can go to work at random. You don’t understand the pressure of my work!”

“That’s right. I just don’t understand it. I am just not as capable as you are and can only be a nurse, but so what?” Sarah said to Brandon, “I think my life is pretty good. I have enough time to live the life I want. You may look down on me, but I look down on you too.”

Brandon was furious.

“We’re not from two different worlds, and that’s why it’s hard for us to be together.” Sarah said, “Let’s not see each other again from now on. You can focus on your work and career, while I’ll live my life peacefully. That way, we won’t disturb each other.”

“Sarah!” Brandon was furious.

He had never thought that he and Sarah would have such a huge fight. However, today, he had truly witnessed Sarah’s ability to anger people. No matter what he said, he could not get through to Sarah. She was as stubborn as a rock.

“Can’t you be more reasonable? When Monica comes back to work, I won’t be so stressed at work, and I won’t have to overtime that much. Then, I’ll try my best to accompany you!”

“Forget it.” Sarah became even more sarcastic. “When my cousin goes back to work, you can’t wait to spend more time with her. Why would you think of spending time with me?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What do you mean?”

“Don’t you know what I mean? You’ve always liked Monica, but because she and Finn got back together, you settled for the next best thing and got together with me.” Sarah sneered. “Actually, I don’t mind it. After all, my cousin is indeed more capable than I am. She’s good-looking and has a good figure, so it’s only natural that you like her.

“But now, I’m tired of you. I was a little interested in you before because you were a breath of fresh air, so even though I knew you liked my cousin, I thought I’d try being in a relationship with you. Now that I’ve tried it out, I think people like you are really boring and I don’t want to waste time on you..”
