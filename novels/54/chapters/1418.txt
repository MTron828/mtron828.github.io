Thank you readers!

In a luxurious private room in the nightclub, Zoe hesitated for a while. In the end, she decided to leave the private room.

She would only be gone for a while anyway, so it should not be a problem.

Since she was already here, she might as well do whatever she wanted once and for all, or she would be itching to do something more in the

IULU1e.

She looked at Nox a few more times to make sure that he would not wake up before walking out of the private room nervously and excitedly.

The moment she walked out, she saw the waitress at the door and quickly said, “You, go in and keep an eye on the person inside for me. If he wakes up, call me immediately, okay?”

Shelly looked at Zoe.

Ever since she was brought here to serve the other day, the supervisor had transferred her over. However, it had only been two days since the transfer, and she had bumped into Nox and Zoe again. Besides that, she realized that Nox was drunk.

“Did you hear me?” Zoe’s tone was stern.

Shelly replied respectfully, “Yes.”

Zoe gave her phone number to Shelly before leaving the private room.

Shelly looked in the direction Zoe left. It was obvious that Zoe was not leaving the nightclub but going to another room. Nevertheless, Shelly pushed open the door to the luxurious private room, which was unusually quiet.

As Shelly looked at Nox lying motionless on the sofa, seemingly in deep sleep, she felt conflicted. It was not that she still had feelings for Nox, but she simply felt bad for the guy for being cheated on like that. She wondered if she should wake him up.

Just like that, Shelly stayed in the private room for a while. It was impossible to wake Nox up, but even if Nox woke up, she did not have to inform Zoe.

At that moment, Nox was sleeping like a pig, and she could even hear him snoring. He really deserved to be cuckolded, just like last time in the restaurant. If he had walked a little slower, he could have witnessed everything.

Shelly stayed with Nox for half an hour, but even then, Zoe had not returned. Shelly had seen too many things in nightclubs, so she did not need to think to know what Zoe was doing.

Where did Zoe get the guts to cheat on Nox? Did Zoe know how much Nox would hate her if he found out?

“Water…”

In the room, Nox suddenly spoke.

Shelly looked at him with his dazed eyes and could tell that he was waking up.

Hence, she quickly went forward and poured him a glass of water. Then, she added ice to it and instantly turned it into cold water before placing it in front of him. She figured it would be easier for him to wake up after drinking cold water. Shelly placed the cup in front of him.

“Water…”

Nox did not even look at the cup and kept calling for water. He was so used to being served that he didn’t even stretch out his hand!

“The water is here.” Shelly reminded him.

Nox pretended not to hear her. “Water. Feed me water…

Shelly was so close to letting him die of thirst. However, she gritted her teeth and put the cup to his lips. After taking a few sips, Nox fell asleep again.

Shelly widened her eyes at Nox. She found it unbelievable that he could still fall asleep while Zoe was out there cheating on him!

Nox did not move.

“Nox.”

He remained motionless.

Speechless, Shelly grabbed Nox’s arm and tried to shake him awake. However, she suddenly felt a brute force on her.

Before she could react, her body was suddenly pulled into someone’s embrace. In the next second, she felt a man reeking of alcohol kissing her cheek crazily. His hands were everywhere on her body…

Shelly really wanted to kill Nox!

That was why she could not be kind to Nox. What was the difference between him and Zoe? She knew very well how many women he had messed around with, yet she thought Zoe was cheating on him.

Maybe both sides had tacitly agreed to sleep with other people. After all, Nox’s way of thinking was different from others; perhaps that was his life.

Shelly finally understood the situation, but she could not figure out why Nox was on top of her.

A woman simply could not compare to a man’s strength. Nox hugged her and kissed her without giving her the chance to resist. However, she had to resist.

It was one thing to hate Nox for kissing her, but if Zoe suddenly bumped into her with Nox, her job would be ruined..
