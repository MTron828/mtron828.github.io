1339 Let’s Break Up, Finn

Parting on good terms was the best way for them to end their relationship.

However, compared to when Finn grabbed her arm, she was in so much more pain that her tears blurred her vision.

She could neither see the road nor the people in front of her at all.

Brandon, who was clearly drunk, suddenly appeared in front of her again. He was standing not far away, seemingly waiting for her with a worried expression.

Monica forced herself to smile. She just felt that she could not embarrass herself in front of outsiders.

However, when she smiled, tears fell like water busting through dams.

She could not contain it. She tried her best to endure it and walked toward Brandon.

The moment she reached out to grab Brandon… she had to admit that she still needed someone to rely on, someone to pull her out of her pain.

She had loved Finn for so many years.

It was finally over.

However, just as her hand was about to reach Brandon…

Her body was suddenly pulled back from behind. The moment that happened, Brandon suddenly grabbed her hand tightly.

Monica’s body froze. She was feeling very uncomfortable being shackled by the two of them.

“Let go!” Finn threatened Brandon with an icy tone.

Brandon tightened his grip when he heard Finn’s voice.

He said, “You’re the one who should let go! Monica has already broken up with you, yet you’re still pestering her!”

“I told you to let go!” Finn’s expression was terrifying.

It was a hair-raising fear.

“I won’t let go! I won’t let you hurt Monica like this again. I won’t…”

Finn suddenly threw a punch at Brandon’s face and Brandon lost his balance. He felt as if his face was about to die from the pain. He took a few steps back.

He was then forced to let go of Monica. As soon as he let go of her, he saw Finn forcing Monica to leave.

Without a second thought, Brandon rushed over, wanting to push Finn away and save Monica…

Finn kicked her again. The kick landed on Brandon’s abdomen.

Brandon was in so much pain that he fell to the ground. He really thought that Finn might actually beat him to death and he could do nothing about it at all.

With just a few simple movements, it was obvious how skilled Finn was.

Brandon clutched his stomach and rolled on the ground in pain. He had never been in such a sorry state in his life. He was beaten up so badly by a man that he could not even get up.

He felt like he was about to faint from the pain.

“Finn, are you crazy?!” Monica looked at Brandon’s pale face.

She was furious when she saw him lying on the ground in extreme pain.

Finn was trained in martial arts. Was he trying to beat Brandon to death by hitting him so hard?!

Moreover, Brandon was drunk. When one was drunk, it was very easy to cause drama.

She wondered if there was really something behind that…

Monica did not want to think about it anymore. She used all her strength to push Finn away.

Finn took two steps back because he was enraged when he saw Monica.

On the other hand, she was livid because he had hit Brandon.

Finn even wondered if Monica would actually do something drastic if he forced her to leave with him.

Ultimately, he did not want Monica to be too harsh on him.

In the end, he could not be so cruel to her, and would still stand in her shoes and think for her.

Therefore, he watched as Monica pushed him away and returned to Brandon’s side with a worried expression.

“Brandon, how are you feeling?” Monica asked nervously. “I’ll take you to the hospital.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Monica, I’m fine… Ugh…” Before he could finish his sentence, he vomited again.

He was still not sober and was feeling dizzy.

However, he found out that Monica and Finn were quarreling, so he got out of the car because he was worried.

Now that he was hit a few times, his stomach started rumbling again.

“I’ll take you to the hospital.” Monica quickly helped him up.

She helped him up and got into the taxi. She slammed the car door shut and left with Brandon.

Finn watched as the car drove away. He watched on as Monica left.

He was holding back his tightly clenched fists, forcing himself to endure it all.
