Chapter 228: Embarrass Jenifer

In the end, Alexander signed the letter for the transfer of shares in front of everyone.

5% of his shares were transferred to Jeanne just like that.

Now, Jeanne had instead become a major shareholder of the Lawrence Enterprise.

Alexander was very unhappy.

He suppressed her anger and appeared very irritable.

Jeanne accepted the transfer letter and smiled. At this moment, she looked at Joshua.

Joshua was afraid of Jeanne.

Jeanne was not like this in the past.

As far as Joshua remembered, Jeanne was the kind of person who had her opinions but was not so powerful. She could not make him tremble with just a look.

Joshua gritted his teeth.

He continued to kneel on the ground and stared back at Jeanne fiercely.

In any case, he would not be frightened by this woman.

She had offended so many people. One day, she would die without a burial ground.

He would definitely see her end.

“Joshua, tell me honestly. Who helped you do this?” Jeanne raised her eyebrow.

Joshua’s eyes flickered.

It was obvious that he did not want to answer her.

“You don’t have to answer. I know the answer very well,” Jeanne enunciated each word. “It was Eden, right?”

The moment she said that, Jonathan, Alexander, and Jenifer were shocked again. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Jenifer could not hold it in any longer. She quickly said, “Jeanne, don’t sow discord. How could Eden do such a thing? He’s not as reckless as Joshua!”

“Of course, Eden isn’t as reckless as Joshua.” Jeanne smiled. “He simply colluded with the Sanders.”

“What do you mean?!” Jenifer was a little agitated.

At this moment, the Swans were the only reason she felt that she still had some status. Of course, she did not want Jeanne to slander Eden.

“I’m just reminding grandpa and dad. You’d better have a good idea of whether or not Eden sincerely wants to treat our family well. From what I know, Eden didn’t hesitate to use the Lawrences as a scapegoat in order to please the Sanders. To put it bluntly, Melody, the third princess of the Sanders, wanted to target me. Eden gave her some advice, and Joshua simply executed the plan. I know very well that once the incident is exposed, the only one who would be implicated would be Joshua. Melody and Eden would be able to escape unscathed.”

This was the reason Jeanne did not want to pursue the matter.

Even after wasting a lot of time pursuing the matter, Joshua, the most useless person, might end up being the scapegoat anyway.

“In the end, the Lawrence Enterprise is the one that’ll be harmed by this matter—economic losses and loss of personnel. Of course, it’s just my opinion. I admit that I have no evidence to prove it. I also want to clarify this matter in the position of the Lawrences. As for whether you believe it or not, it is up to you.” Jeanne’s words were very sincere.

It did not sound like she was slandering anyone; it sounded like a kind reminder.

The more it was that case, the easier it was for people to believe her.

“Impossible!” Jenifer was still trying to defend Eden. “I know very well what kind of person Eden is. He would never do such a thing. Besides, Eden and Jasmine have such a good relationship. He would never hurt Jasmine.”

“You’ve never been in business before. Don’t use your narrow-minded mind to think about business matters. I’m only informing grandpa and dad. This has nothing to do with you,” Jeanne mocked Jenifer. It was obvious that she was being sarcastic.

Jenifer instantly became a little embarrassed.

Indeed, she had never been in contact with business matters. Even so, her deep-rooted belief was that women did not need to do anything in business. They only needed to secure men. That would be a woman’s greatest achievement.

At this moment, she was being ridiculed by Jeanne, so much so that she was in a sorry state.

It was as if she was useless in front of them.

“Whether it’s true or not, you can ask Joshua in private. Perhaps Joshua isn’t willing to tell the truth in front of me, so I won’t make things difficult for him.” Jeanne acted as if she knew everything clearly. She said, “I’m a little tired after the lawsuit. Grandpa, I’m going back to my room to rest.”

Jonathan nodded slightly. “Rest well.”

“Thank you, Grandpa.” Jeanne smiled slightly.

She smiled and left.

Jeanne knew that sooner or later, Joshua would admit everything. She was just trying to sow discord.

After Jeanne left the study, Jonathan’s face darkened. He looked at Joshua. “Tell me honestly, did Eden order you to do this?!”
