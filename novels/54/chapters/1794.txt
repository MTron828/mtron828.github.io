Chapter 1795: Nox Proposes

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly could not help but laugh. She always felt that wherever Monica was, happiness would follow.

She recalled how much Monica had changed at one point in time — how she became more self-disciplined and powerful but lost all her smiles at that expense. Shelly believed that Monica was more suitable to be pampered, just like how Dr. Jones was doting on her now.

“Why isn’t the main course served yet?” Monica frowned.

Jeanne chimed in at that moment. “It might not be ready yet. Can you go check on it?” “Alright.” Monica stood up.

The moment she got up, she suddenly asked Bella, “Bella, do you want to come with me?”

Bella hurriedly got down from her chair and replied, “Yes.”

The child was probably getting impatient and wanted to walk around, so Shelly did not refuse. Just like that, she watched as Monica led Bella away, leaving only her and Jeanne at the dining table.

Jeanne wiped her mouth clean and said, “I’m going to the washroom.”

“Alright.”

Then, she was left alone at the dining table.

The sky tonight was bright and filled with stars. At that moment, the cruise ship had left the shore and was floating in the sea. The feeling of the gentle breeze blowing on her face was relaxing, and she realized that ordinary people would not be able to experience the happiness the rich had.

Shelly fell deep into her own thoughts as she sat at the table and waited for them. After waiting for a while, they were still nowhere to be seen, but a waiter was there with their main dishes. Without paying much attention to the waiter serving her, Shelly sat at the table obediently and accepted the service.

However, she suddenly frowned when she saw that there was only one plate for her. What about the food for the others? With that thought in mind, she turned around in surprise and froze when she saw Nox.

Seeing Nox standing in front of her in a waiter’s uniform, she had to admit that her heart did skip a beat at that moment. After all, she had never expected Nox to be here and personally serve her food. The two of them stared at each other for a long time before Nox said, “Are you surprised?”

Shelly looked away. She did not know either whether she was surprised or not.

She said, “Aren’t you busy with work? Why are you here?”

“I just wanted to give you a surprise.” Nox said, “Did it scare you?”

Shelly did not answer because she did not know how to. To Nox, Shelly’s silence was her answer. However, he did not react to it. Instead, he said, “Aren’t you going to eat it?”

He meant he wanted Shelly to eat the steak he served. Upon hearing that, Shelly hesitated for a second and then picked up her utensils to cut the steak.

Just as she had cut off a piece and was about to put it in her mouth, she suddenly put it down and said, “Nox, what exactly do you want?”

The disappointment in Nox’s eyes was visible. However, he would not allow himself to show his emotions.

He said, “You should be able to guess it.”

Shelly’s eyes flickered. In the next second, she suddenly heard the melodious sound of a violin coming from the deck. She turned her head to see a man in a tuxedo playing a song not far away from them. Immediately after, colorful lights on the deck lit up.

In the beginning, the environment was relatively cozy. There were not many lights, just one dim yellow light illuminating their table, which was set with red candles that made it look very romantic. However, at that moment, the dazzlingly colorful lit-up deck looked like the sea during a sunrise.

Shelly could not help but bite her lip as she watched Nox go down on one knee and take out an exquisite gift box from his pocket. As soon as he opened the box opened, he revealed a sparkling ring.

The diamond was huge and a little exaggerated. It did not match Shelly’s temperament, but it did match Nox’s flamboyant personality. In fact, he knew Shelly would not like it, but he wanted to give her what he thought was the best.

He looked at Shelly and said affectionately, “Shelly, marry me.”

‘Marry me, and I swear I will treat you very, very well. I really will. I love you very much.’

However, he did not say those words because he knew that the outcome would not be good, and saying too much would be futile.

Shelly stared at the ring and then turned to look at Nox. She did not know whether it was because of the light, but when their eyes met, she thought she saw tears in Nox’s eyes. For the first time, she thought Nox’s eyes looked pure and without his usual flamboyance.

She remained silent for a long time. She was originally going to reject him without second thoughts because there was no way she could be with Nox. However, for some reason, she was hesitating.

After a long while, she gritted her teeth and said, “Nox, I won’t marry you.”

It was straight to the point and left no room wiggle room for Nox to say otherwise.

Nox had expected it. However, when he heard the answer for himself, he reacted differently to how he thought he would react. His eyes seemed a little red, but the moment he lowered his head, it was concealed. He said, “Don’t you want to think about it?”

“No.”

“Alright.”

Nox took back the ring. When he raised his head again, there was no longer any emotion in his eyes. It was as if everything he had done just now was normal and that it did not affect him at all..
