1259 A Sudden Heartwarming Moment, Your Sister Will Be Named Phillipa

In Bamboo Garden, it was late at night.

After Edward returned in the morning, he slept for the entire day. Even at midnight, he was still asleep.

In the beginning, Jeanne could stay by his side calmly and wait for him to wake up. However, she had slept and woken up countless times by now, but the person beside her had not woken up yet.

Jeanne crawled from one side of the bed to the other. Through the dim yellow light, she saw him sleeping soundly.

Was he in deep sleep or…

With her lips pursed, Jeanne stretched out her hand and placed it near Edward’s nose. She even wondered whether he might have fallen asleep and would never wake up again.

She felt his breathing quietly with her fingers, and it seemed like he was still breathing. However, she still seemed worried, so she rested her head on Edward’s chest, listening to his heartbeat and feeling if it was still as strong as before.

She listened to his heartbeat very seriously. “Ba-damp, ba-dump, ba-dump.”

Half of Jeanne’s face was pressed against Edward’s chest.

“Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump…”

The sound of his heartbeat seemed to have changed. It was starting to race, and some were beating not at the same tempo.

Just as Jeanne was feeling a little alarmed, she suddenly heard an all too familiar male voice. “Are you afraid that I’ll die?”

Jeanne jumped in shock and looked up at Edward.

She watched him open his eyes. The fatigue on his face seemed to have lessened a lot, and his eyes no longer looked sleepy. At that moment, his dark eyes were fixed on her as he asked her in the calmest tone possible. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jeanne quietly moved away from him and said, “You slept for so long.”

She did not answer his question directly.

“What time is it now?” Edward asked her.

“It’s past 11 p.m.” Jeanne replied, “Do you want to eat something?”

Edward shook his head.

He had slept for a day, but he was not hungry at all. On the contrary, he had no appetite.

“I’m sleepy.” Jeanne said, “I’m going to sleep.”

Edward nodded.

Jeanne lay on the bed and closed her eyes in silence. Although she had slept and woken up many times, it was time for her to go to sleep.

In the quiet room, Jeanne could feel a pair of eyes staring intensely at her back. However, he just looked at her and did not get close to her.

The two of them slept on the same bed, separated by a distance that seemed impossible to cross. They could only look at each other from afar.

In the end, Jeanne could not fall asleep.

After a long time, she finally turned around clumsily and saw Edward’s eyes on her. His eyes flickered, but at that moment, he turned around and chose to have his back facing her.

Now, it was Jeanne’s turn to face his board and cold back.

It seemed like between them, she was always the one turning around and leaving. Recently, even if he had a new fiancée, she would be the first one to leave.

She did not know how he felt every time he looked at her back, but suddenly, she did not want to be faced with his deliberately disguised indifference toward her. She knew very well that he could only suppress himself and not get close to her because of her rejection of him.

With that, she slowly moved her body toward Edward. Edward could clearly feel it, and she could also clearly feel Edward’s stiff and tense body.

In the past, she had always thought that a strong man like Edward would always make people feel intimidated. Yet now, she realized that she could make Edward feel overwhelmed as well.

When her chubby arms wrapped around his strong waist, the man she was hugging trembled.

Jeanne gently buried her head on Edward’s back. As her belly was very big, she slept a little diagonally. In order to avoid accidentally squeezing the baby in her stomach, she only pressed her face and chest against his back, feeling the familiar smell and temperature of his body…

As the night got darker, Edward maintained his position and did not move in her arms at all. It was as if he had been petrified.

People who did not know better would think that he had fallen asleep.
