Chapter 1681: The Breakup

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Benjamin held her hand, filling both their palms with warmth.

Shelly was actually very nervous. When she thought about what was going to happen tonight, she found it a little… hard to control herself.

Even though it was not the first time as she had done it twice with Nox, she had automatically erased those two times from her memories. To her, the two times with Nox could only be considered mating, and she forced herself to never think about it again.

“What’s wrong?” Shelly looked at Benjamin and was a little surprised.

Was he more nervous than her? It should be Benjamin’s first time since he was still study and had never dated a girl. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Shelly, I have something to tell you.” Benjamin mustered his courage.

He was afraid that the longer he waited, the harder it would be for him to say it.

He knew what Shelly meant, and if not for that fact that so much had happened over the last few days, tonight might be their best night. He had also looked forward to this night many times, but because he was not capable enough, he chose to give Shelly a better future.

“Yes.” Shelly sat down next to Benjamin shyly.

She thought Benjamin was probably going to confess before they went to the bed, so she was filled with anticipation. However, what she heard next was…

“Shelly, let’s break up.”

Shelly’s shy smile froze at the corner of her mouth, and she stared at Benjamin, thinking she had misheard.

“I’m sorry,” Benjamin apologized.

After taking the initiative to break up, he suddenly apologized.

“Why are you suddenly breaking up with me?” Shelly suppressed the sadness in her heart and tried hard to control her emotions as she asked him, “Did something happen?”

“No.” Benjamin looked at Shelly. “I just don’t think we’re suitable for each

“Wasn’t everything fine before?” Shelly asked.

For some reason, Benjamin suddenly changed his mind, and she could not accept it.

“I suddenly see it now.” Benjamin’s throat moved as he endured the intense pain in his heart. “Nox is fine. You should go back to him.”

“Did Nox look for you again? Did he threaten you? Did he say that if you don’t break up with me, he’ll ruin your chance to go abroad?” Shelly suddenly became agitated.

At that moment, her eyes even turned red. Nox’s despicable behavior really made her want to kill him.

“No.” Benjamin denied it. “Nox can’t wait for me to study abroad. He won’t stop me.”

“Then, what is it? What did Nox do to you?” Shelly asked

To Shelly, the worst person in the world was Nox, and she could not think of anything else that would make Benjamin break up with her. She could feel how much Benjamin loved her, and he would not break up with her out of the blue.

“I’m the one who realized we won’t be happy together.”

“Benjamin, why can’t you tell me?”

Shelly refused to believe that Benjamin suddenly had an epiphany and decided to break up with her just like that. Something must have happened.

“Am I that unworthy of your trust? Don’t you trust me to share your burden with you?” Shelly asked him, with tears welled up in her eyes.

Benjamin’s eyes were also red as he said, “I just suddenly realize how big the gap is between Nox and I. What he can give you, I might not be able to give you in my life.”

“So you think I’m that greedy for wealth? If I were, I wouldn’t have hesitated to agree the moment Nox asked me to be with him again!”

“But I don’t want to hold you back.”

“Benjamin, don’t you know how much I hate Nox? I would be with anyone in the world but Nox!”

“What if Nox is sincere to you? Didn’t you like me because you were touched by me? It’s the same for Nox. Will you really not like him?” “I won’t!” Shelly said firmly.

“Shelly, no one knows what will happen in the future.”

“So you’re giving up on me just because of uncertainties?” Shelly said sarcastically.

Benjamin pursed his lips, trying to hide his sadness.

“I won’t break up with you,” Shelly said firmly. “Unless you truly don’t like me anymore, I will never break up with you..”
