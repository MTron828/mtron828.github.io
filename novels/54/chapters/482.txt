Chapter 483: Jasmine’s Video Exposed, and a Slap in the Face

Now, she claimed that George was Fourth Master Swan’s son?

That’s impossible.

It’s definitely another story those two people made up on purpose, just so that she would not frame Jeanne!

Jeanne was so smart.

Since Jeanne was so smart, if Jasmine could think of using the fact that Fourth Master Swan could not have children to explain the motive of Jeanne pushing her and causing her to have a miscarriage, Jeanne would definitely be able to think of how to make it impossible for herself to have that motive!

Those two people must have colluded with each other a long time ago.

She kept cheering herself on in her heart, telling herself that George could not be Edward’s child. He definitely was not.

As for the others, they were also on the fence about it.

Logically, no one believed it, but Jeanne’s calm demeanor gave them no choice but to believe it.

As such, no one dared to say anything more. If they did, they might humiliate themselves.

Everyone waited quietly for George to come.

On the other hand, George thought it was a little strange.

Today was Saturday, and there was no class, so he could laze in bed. However, he was suddenly woken up by Teddy and brought here for some unknown reason.

......

He could feel everyone’s gaze on him, and it made him very uncomfortable.

“George,” Jeanne called out to him.

George looked over, hiding the unhappiness in his eyes as he walked obediently to Jeanne’s side.

Everyone’s gazes were still on George. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Mom.” George frowned, clearly unhappy.

Jeanne said, “Do you want to meet your dad?”

“Huh?” George was surprised. “Isn’t my dad dead?”

Jeanne pursed her lips, and Edward also did the same.

“Oh, he’s not dead,” Jeanne said.

At that moment, George was a little dumbfounded.

It was already strange to be looked at like that by others, and now, what his mother said made him even more confused.

Jeanne touched George’s head.

She would explain it to George in the future.

She stood up straight and said, “Find an authoritative doctor you trust and do a paternity test!”

“Stop trying to fool us!” Elaine directly rejected Jeanne. “What authoritative doctor? Now that Edward has control over Harken, who should we find? In the end, the results will still be in your favor! I won’t accept any paternity test!”

“Right. This is complete nonsense!” Belle immediately agreed. “You said that you slept with Edward seven years ago? You’re lying! You and Eden were in a relationship back then, and you used to like Eden so much. Why would you have a relationship with Edward? What can you say about that?”

“Yeah, Eden and I were in a relationship back then, yet he still cheated on me! If he could cheat on me and sleep with Jasmine, can’t I take revenge on him in the same way?”

“What did you say? How dare you cheat on my son?” Belle was furious.

“Belle, so only your son can do what he likes, but I can’t?”

“You!”

“Besides, I slept with Edward after your son cheated on me! Do you think I should stay single my entire life since your son is already with another woman? How can you be so shameless?” Jeanne was extremely sarcastic about it.

Upon hearing Jeanne’s words, Belle’s face turned ashen.

“Sister, do you have to be so aggressive? When I was with Eden back then, at least we were together because we had feelings for each other. If you really did sleep with Fourth Uncle back then, don’t you think you were too frivolous? Eden still felt extremely guilty toward you back then, but I can’t believe you betrayed him long ago...”

“Jasmine. As a mistress, know your place. Don’t be a whore and act like a virgin. God is watching!”

“Sister!” Jasmine’s eyes reddened from Jeanne’s words.

“Don’t listen to her nonsense. In any case, I refuse to believe George is Edward’s son!” Elaine was extremely certain. She said to Edward, “Edward, no matter what relationship you have with Jeanne now or what kind of deal you have between the two of you, I advise you not to indulge Jeanne too much! If you treat her like this, it will only make her even more lawless in this family! As long as you think you’re still a member of the Swans, don’t do such a thing for a woman–”

“Originally, I thought doing a paternity test was the most direct and effective way, but it looks like I’ve really overestimated you.” Jeanne sneered and interrupted Elaine’s words.
