Chapter 1734: The Twins’ Names

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She was just wondering why Finn was so careful with her, but it turned out that he was… No matter what, she found it erotic.

“I’d like to go to the toilet,” Monica suddenly said.

She felt like she had to divert her attention elsewhere to distract herself.

“I’ll carry you there.”

“I can get down on my own.”

“The doctor said that you might faint easily if you’ve been in bed for too long.

It’s safer for me to carry you.”

She was going to pee, for crying out loud, not a hike!

Finn bent over and picked Monica up. The moment he picked her up, he let out a huge breath.

“Am I very heavy?” Monica asked as she hugged Finn’s neck.

“No, you’re too light.”

Monica was speechless. “The fatter, the better.” “In what way?

“You’ll be softer to hug.”

‘Get lost!’ Monica was fuming.

After Finn placed Monica on the toilet bowl, Monica asked, “Aren’t you going out?”

“I’ll stay with you.”

“I need to pee.”

“No duh?” Finn asked.

It made Monica question whether she had lost her privacy after giving birth to the children. However, she could not hold her pee in anymore in the end, and the moment she peed, she cried out.

“w nat’s wrong” Finn asKec1 worriedly.

She felt a burning pain down there. Did they not say that she could run the next day after a natural birth?

“Can you hold on? Or do you want me to check it for you?” Finn blurted out.

Monica glared at Finn and ignored him as she continued peeing. In fact, the pain was tolerable, but she cried out because she was not mentally prepared for it.

After using the toilet, Monica stood up. However, before she could put on her pants, Finn came over and put it on for her. Then, he picked her up horizontally and placed her on the bed.

Monica’s parents happened to arrive at the same time too. Seeing that she was awake and in good spirits, they went straight to the babies without even asking how she was.

Monica felt hurt. Before those two little fellows came along, she was her parents’ precious baby, but now, she had obviously fallen out of favor. When she saw the two old people holding her children excitedly, she got jealous.

“By the way, Finn, I made some chicken soup for Monica. You can take it out for Monica to have it.” Ruby was holding the baby sister in her arms and could not even take her eyes off the baby when she spoke to Finn.

“Alright.” Finn opened the thermos beside him and poured out a bowl of chicken soup.

Then, he sat in front of Monica and fed her with a spoon. As it was a little hot, he would blow on it gently every time he fed her, and his gestures warmed Monica’s heart. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Finn, why are you so good to me?” Monica could not help but ask him.

Finn smiled. “I thought you knew.” “Do you love me?” Monica confirmed.

“Do you want me to say it a hundred times?”

“I don’t think I’ll get tired of it even if you say it hundreds of times,” Monica muttered.

“I love you,” Finn suddenly said.

She used to think that getting Finn to say those three words were impossible, but after the babies were born, Finn seemed to have said it many times. It was as if something in him had opened up, and his entire personality had changed.

“Be good and drink the soup.” Finn coaxed softly, “You’ll hear it often in the future.”

Monica did not know at that time that Finn was referring to his daughter, not her. Who would have thought that Finn, who was not good with words, could say that he loved his daughter a hundred times a day?

After Monica finished her soup, she lay back down on the hospital bed again.

Suddenly, she realized that she had never held the baby before. “Mom, let me hold the baby.”

“You shouldn’t carry a baby when you’re recovering.” Ruby rejected her directly.

“She’s my child. Why can’t I hold her?” Monica was angry. “You can’t carry heavy things during the recovery phase.”

“Nonsense. It’s just an old wives tale.”

“An old wives tale can be true too, so please get some rest.” “You just don’t want me to carry the baby. ” Monica pouted.

“I can’t be bothered with you.” Ruby did not even look at Monica.

Monica was speechless. She had indeed fallen out of favor.

In the ward, Ruby and Gary played with the children. After a while, the door was pushed open again.

When Monica saw Jeanne walk in, she became excited. “Jeannie, you’re here..”
