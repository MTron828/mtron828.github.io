Chapter 529: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

Reese also noticed that Michael was holding Monica’s phone in his hand.

While the two of them were talking, Michael took Monica’s phone out of her pocket.

Since Monica’s attention was elsewhere, she did not notice it.

That meant Monica would turn back to get her phone.

Reese went to the door and opened it slightly before coming back to accompany Michael in his act.

“Michael, do you know the current situation our family is in? Do you? After your father passed away, do you know how many people have been eyeing us covetously? Have you ever thought that you and Monica getting captured by the paparazzi was an act of revenge on our family? If you fall, we’ll be left with nothing!”

Michael did not say anything.

“Why can’t you think for yourself a little more? Why can’t you let Monica help you? Once you admit your relationship, you’re free to love each other, and no one will be able to slander you anymore. You can compete for your position and support our family. Otherwise... Your father had made countless enemies when he was still in power. Once our family falls, do you think we’ll have a good life? Even protecting yourself might be difficult, let alone having a good life. Your father told you so much before he died, but did you listen to him?”

“I know!” Michael said fiercely, “I know, but I refuse to make things difficult for Monica. I won’t do anything to hurt her. Even if I get myself killed, I won’t ask Monica to help me. She has her own life now, and I don’t want her to risk her happiness for me.”

“You love her so much. Even if she’s with you, you can make her happy. Why don’t you try–”

“She doesn’t like me.” Michael enunciated each word.

“You’re so good to her. How can she not like you?”

“There’s someone else in this world who treats her better than I do, and he makes her happiest. As for me… Well, look at me. How can I give her happiness? I don’t even have the right to like her.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Michael, you know very well that as long as Monica agrees to be with you, you’ll restore your image. Once your popularity increases, our family will be able to recover. Then, how could you not have the right to like her and give her happiness? I’m begging you. Just let Monica help you once, okay? I can’t stand by and watch our family or you get destroyed. Michael–”

“I’d rather have nothing than letting Monica do this for me. I can’t hurt her.”

“So you have to hurt our family and me instead? Do you want me to die in front of you so that you’ll know what regret feels like?” Reese asked him fiercely. At that moment, she was so emotional that she suddenly turned around.

When she saw a fruit knife on the coffee table, she took it and said, “Will it make you happy if I die? Do you want me to die in front of you?”

“Mom!” Michael was shocked.

Following that, Reese was about to cut her wrist, and Michael used his hand to stop her.

Monica, who had just returned to retrieve her phone, was also startled by the scene.

She hurriedly rushed in.

When she left, she realized she did not have her phone or any money with her. Since she could not head home without her phone, she hurriedly came back to retrieve her phone.

The door was not closed, and she could not remember if she had closed the door when she left.

She knocked on the door twice, but no one answered, so she walked in.

That was when she overheard Michael and his mother’s conversation.

Michael was really considerate of her.

However, she stayed by the side and did not make a sound.

If it were not for Reese wanting to commit suicide, she might have waited until they had finished talking and pretended not to hear anything before showing her face.

She just watched as the knife cut Michael’s hand and blood flowed out profusely.

Shocked by the scene in front of her, Reese threw the knife aside abruptly and hurriedly looked at Michael’s wound.

Despite that, Michael endured the pain.

Reese cried as she said, “Michael, do you want our family to be broken up? Do you? Is our family done for now that your father has passed away? Michael, since you were young, you’ve always been the pride of our family. Now, why must you do this? I really don’t want to live anymore...”
