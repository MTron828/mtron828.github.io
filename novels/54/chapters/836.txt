Chapter 837 Successful Escape: Letting Go To Stay Alive

In the end, the person in the group chat added: [I’m done for. I can’t recall the previous messages.]

[I suggest you spam the group with messages.] Someone suggested.

After that, the group chat was spammed with crazy messages.

Finn put down his phone.

He felt that as a doctor...

The first thing he needed to do was to exercise self-discipline.

Even if he could not sleep, he had to force himself to rest.

...

The next day.

Edward opened his eyes.

He looked at the familiar room, and his eyes moved slightly.

Nox was sleeping on the sofa in his room. He looked very tired and had an unsightly sleeping posture, but he was in a deep sleep.

Edward moved his body slightly.

His entire body felt weak.

He forced himself to sit up.

The door was suddenly pushed open.

Edward thought it was Finn, but he did not expect it to be George.

It was little George.

He was holding a bowl of vegetable porridge in his hand as he walked in carefully.

Edward just looked at him.

He watched as George placed the bowl of porridge on the bed carefully before crawling over to his bed and sitting down.

George asked, “Are you hungry?”

Edward looked at the porridge and then at George.

“Uncle Teddy asked the kitchen to make this,” George said.

Edward nodded.

“Why aren’t you eating?” George asked him with a frown.

“Call Teddy in.”

“Uncle Teddy is still busy.”

“My hand is injured. It’s not convenient for me to eat.” Edward placed his hand, which was wrapped like a dumpling, in front of George.

George looked.

Nobody knew what he was thinking about.

He kicked his short legs, moved his small butt a few times, then picked up the small bowl on the bed with his short hands and said, “I’ll feed you.”

Edward looked at his son.

At this moment, he was a little overwhelmed.

George did not seem to notice the change in Edward’s expression. He scooped a spoonful of porridge and tried his best to place it near Edward’s mouth. “It’s not hot anymore. Uncle Teddy has cooled it for you.”

Edward opened his mouth.

The moderately hard rice grains had a refreshing taste in his mouth.

“Is it good?” George asked him.

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

“Uncle Teddy said that it was Finn who asked to let you have porridge first. Finn said that your body is too weak now and that you can’t be overly nourished.”

Edward responded.

George kept feeding Edward with all his might.

Edward ate the vegetable porridge that George had brought over.

In the room, it was surprisingly harmonious.

When Nox opened his eyes, he was also shocked by the scene in front of him.

‘I’m not dreaming, right?

‘That little brat is actually feeding Edward.

‘Didn’t he hate his dad the most?

‘Why is he so obedient now?

‘Could it be that he knows that his mom doesn’t want him anymore?’

Nox just lay on the sofa and watched their interaction, not disturbing them.

“Don’t you have anything to ask me?” Edward asked George as he ate his porridge.

George pouted but did not say anything.

“When I left, I promised to bring your mother back.” Edward looked at George and continued, “But I didn’t manage to do it.

George knew Edward had not done it.

Yesterday, when he saw his father being carried back by Finn and Nox and did not see his mother, he knew that his mother was not back.

Even so, he did not ask about it.

He knew that his father’s body was very weak.

He was afraid that asking too much would affect his father’s recovery.

“She was taken away by Kingsley.” Edward told George.

At least, he could tell George that his mother was still alive. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

George blinked his big eyes.

He was not wearing his glasses today.

Those pitch-black pupils made it hard for one to look away.

George looked like Edward.

In fact, George had inherited all the good qualities of Edward and Jeanne.

“I’m sorry.” Edward smiled. “I didn’t stop Kingsley.”

He took the blame.

George shook his head at that moment.

He said, “Mommy once told me that if she left me, it would be her choice to leave. She told me not to wait for her.”

Edward looked at George.

George said, “I probably can only rely on you in the future.”

Edward smiled.

He wanted to reach out and touch George’s head.

One of his hands was on an IV drip, while the other was wrapped in thick gauze. He was really helpless.

“I’ll do my best to take care of you,” Edward said, trying to comfort George.

“No need. Just take good care of yourself.” George was obviously a little disdainful.

Edward felt that he did not have the right to say what he did indeed given his state at the moment.

“I can take care of myself,” George said with a serious expression.

“Alright,” Edward responded.

After George finished feeding Edward the bowl of porridge, he asked, “Do you want more?”

“No.”

“Then I’ll take the bowl out.”

George kicked his little legs and got out of bed.

“George.” Edward stopped him.

“What?” George turned around.

“I’ll bring your mother back,” Edward promised.

George looked at Edward.

After all, he was just a 6-year-old child.

Upon hearing Edward’s words, a smile appeared on his face.

“Don’t tell anyone. This is our secret,” Edward said bluntly.

“But he heard it.” George turned to look at Nox.

Nox quickly turned his back to them and said, “You can pretend I don’t exist.”

“Do you want to kill him?” George suggested.

Edward laughed.

Nox was angry.

George ran away.

“Your son is just like your wife. They’re cold-blooded and heartless.” Nox could not help but ridicule as he watched George leave.

Edward ignored Nox.

Nox said, “Don’t bring Jeanne back. I’m afraid you’ll die without knowing why.”

“Once husband and wife, always husband and wife,” Edward said.

“I don’t see Jeanne showing that,” Nox retorted.

That woman almost killed Edward.

“She can just show it in bed.”

“...”

‘Is he saying that Jeanne can just repay him with her body even if she does heinous things to him?

‘F*ck!’

Nox suddenly felt that it was easy for women to stay alive!
