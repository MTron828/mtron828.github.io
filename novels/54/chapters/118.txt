Chapter 119: Danger Lurks Everywhere

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jeanne definitely did not live in vain while she was overseas. Of course, don’t give up on yourself. It’s not a bad thing to fail the first time. At least you understand that Jeanne is not as incompetent as we thought. You need to be more cautious in what you do next,” Micheal comforted him.

“Okay,” Eden replied.

“I’m calling to tell you that Melody is eager to make Jeanne suffer. She has suffered a lot because of Jeanne recently, and she was very upset.”

“I know.” Eden nodded.

“If you have any needs, you can call me directly. I’ll try my best to help you.”

“Okay.”

“Eden, you’re my best friend. That’s why I introduced you to the Sanders. You have to seize the opportunity.”

“I know.”

“Actually, we both know that you’re a very capable person. Your development is far from what it is now. If it wasn’t for your Uncle Edward, the Swans would have been yours now.” Micheal appeared a little regretful as he said that. “But don’t worry too much. Once you get help from the Sanders, it won’t be difficult for you to take over the Swans.”

“Micheal, I treat you as my best friend as well, so I want to say some things to you.”

“It’s okay. Tell me, I won’t tell anyone.”

“If Miss sanders married my Uncle Edward, would she still help me instead of him?”

“You don’t have to worry about that.” Micheal gave him an affirmative reply, “If Melody Sanders married your Uncle Edward, it was not just a personal marriage, but also a political marriage. The Sanders took a liking to your Uncle Edward’s ability and wanted him to develop as a politician. To put it bluntly, once your Uncle Edward marries Melody Sanders, he will let go of the Swans’ business and enter politics. Think about it, if your Uncle Edward leaves, who else will the Swans belong to?”

“I see!” The huge rock in Eden’s heart was set down.

The reason why he wanted to curry favor with the Sanders previously was indeed to climb up the ranks of the nobility and raise his status. The Sanders were the most powerful people in Harken, so he had no other choice.

He heaved a sigh of relief and no longer had to worry.

Micheal was right. Once his Uncle Edward left, the Swans would only belong to him.

“You haven’t had much contact with the Sanders, so you don’t know much about political matters. If you encounter any difficulties or areas that you don’t understand, just ask me directly.”

“Thank you.”

“Don’t treat me as an outsider. I treat you as a friend, and it’s only right for me to help a friend.”

Eden smiled. “Then I won’t be sentimental with you.”

“Indeed, you shouldn’t.” Micheal affirmed and suddenly said, “Oh right, Eden, don’t drag me into the matter of setting Melody Sanders up with your Uncle Edward for the time being.”

“What’s wrong?”

“I’m with Monica now. Monica’s best friend is Jeanne. I don’t want to cause a conflict between Monica and me because of this matter.”

“I understand.” Eden agreed immediately. “But I really don’t understand why you like Monica.”

“After you get involved with politics and power, you will know that a woman like Monica is rare.”

“But you are not a sentimental person.”

“So, of course, it’s not just because of feelings. There are many things that I won’t tell you for the time being. You should settle the matter between Melody and your Uncle Edward first. We can talk about other things later.”

“Okay.” Eden felt that Micheal was unwilling to say more, so he did not ask further...

“If you have any difficulties, remember to look for me.”

“I will.”

The two of them hung up the phone.

Eden had a cunning look on his face.

He was very clear about Micheal’s ability. Although he had yet to make a name for himself in politics, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

He did not believe that with the help of so many people, he would not be able to kill Jeanne.
