Chapter 1559: Monica Gets Jealous

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Where’s Finn?”

“You told him to come, didn’t you?” Monica was very sure.

She had indeed told Jeanne about her schedule on purpose. On the one hand, it was to let Jeanne know where she was so that Jeanne knew where she was. On the other hand, it was to have Jeanne tell Finn.

That was because she was also worried that the same thing would happen when she was last overseas. Moreover, there was nothing wrong with having a doctor by her side.

“All I did was tell him that you were going to Casterbridge. As for why he followed you there, I don’t know either. Don’t accuse me.”

“I’m not accusing you.” Monica typed. “You were the one who told him to come. ”

“Why don’t you accept Finn’s initiative?”

Monica did not know how to answer that question.

“Finn has changed a lot.”

He had indeed changed a lot. He had become someone who knew how to seduce women.

In the past, no matter what, Finn had always had admirers and even flirtatious people around him, such as Patsy and Sarah. However, he had never taken the initiative to approach anyone.

Monica had to admit that as a secretary, Ms. Hansen was pretty. She also had a good figure and good temperament and was eloquent in her speech.

Forget it. Monica felt that she was overthinking.

She continued typing. “I just wanted to let you know that I’m doing well in

Casterbridge. Don’t worry.”

“Alright. Take care of yourself there.”

“Yes.”

The two of them ended their conversation, and at that moment, Finn also came out of the shower.

When he came out, he only had a towel tied around his lower body, and his upper body was naked with some water droplets. His hair was a little wet.

Monica glanced at him but soon looked away. “Why aren’t you wearing any clothes?”

Finn glanced at himself and said, “I forgot to bring a change of clothes inside.”

“Hurry up and put your clothes on.”

“Alright.” Finn quickly agreed.

Then, he walked into the closet. After a while, he changed into a set of short-sleeved home clothes.

“Hair.” Monica said, “Don’t go to bed wet. I don’t like it.”

“Alright.”

Finn hurriedly dried his hair. When he was done, Monica was already asleep, so he quietly climbed onto the bed. Just as he turned off the lights, his phone screen lit up.

He quickly picked it up and saw a message from Wendy. “Mr. Jones, how about we pick you guys up at the hotel at 9 a.m. tomorrow?”

“9 a.m. is too early. 10 a.m. is more suitable,” Fin replied.

“Alright.” The other party quickly replied, “In that case, we’ll wait for you in the hotel lobby at 10 a.m. tomorrow. It’s getting late, and you should rest early, Mr. Jones. Goodnight.” “Goodnight ”

Finn replied before putting his phone down again. The moment he put it down and turned around, he saw Monica looking at him with her eyes wide open.

The two of them were lying under the same blanket and were looking at each other at such a close distance.

“You’re still awake?” Finn asked.

“Who are you texting?” Monica asked. “Ms. Hansen, about our schedule for tomorrow—”

“Finn,” Monica suddenly interrupted.

“Yes.” Finn looked at her.

“Don’t you think we’re sleeping too close?” Monica said bluntly.

Did they not sleep like that last night?

“It will affect my sleep. Can you not share a blanket with me?” Monica requested.

Finn pursed his lips. “I won’t move when I sleep.”

“How do you know you won’t move when you’re asleep?” Finn was speechless.

“Also, find another blanket. I’m not sharing a blanket with you.”

Finn had no choice but to get up and requested the hotel staff to bring him a blanket. When he lay back down beside Monica, she deliberately distanced herself from him.

Finn sighed. As expected, if he wanted to get Monica back completely, the process would be long and arduous.

The next day, they also had breakfast in the room. Finn was halfway through his breakfast when his phone rang.

He glanced at the caller ID and picked it up. “Ms. Hansen.”

“Mr. Jones, we’re waiting downstairs, but please take your time to come down.”

“Alright, I understand.”

The moment he hung up the phone, he saw Monica suddenly put down her utensils. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Finn frowned. “Why aren’t you eating?”

“I don’t want to eat.”

“How can you eat so little? It would take an hour by car today, and we’re taking the highway. What if you get hungry midway?” Finn said worriedly..
