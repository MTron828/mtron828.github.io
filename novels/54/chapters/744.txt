Chapter 745: She Couldn’t Please Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Did Finn come to see you?” Jeanne changed the subject.

Monica smiled.

She said in a self-deprecating tone, “What makes you think he would come looking for me?”

“Didn’t you two... sleep together?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

The call to Monica did not go through the day after the incident. It only went through the next day.

Her phone was dropped at the hotel and it was later delivered by the staff.

When the call had gone through, Jeanne hadn’t expected Monica to be so calm. She wasn’t sure if it was because it had been a day or if she had accepted it, but after she had slept with Finn and was pushed away by him, she hadn’t burst into tears as she usually would. In fact, Monica hadn’t expressed much of her emotions. She just told Jeanne flatly that it was never going to happen between them again. Finn really didn’t love her anymore.

Jeanne asked Monica if she regretted helping Michael.

Monica still said she had no regrets.

It was just a little uncomfortable.

Unexpectedly, she and Finn really broke up.

However, she still did not feel that she had done anything wrong. She had her principles.

Her only regret was that she and Finn had broken up because of this.

Jeanne asked Monica if she blamed Finn. However, she answered rationally without any complaint.

After all, Monica was the one who had suggested a temporary breakup to help Michael. Back then, Finn had humbly begged her to stay. Now, she was humbly begging Finn to stay. It was only expected that he would not agree.

Monica only told Jeanne that she felt reluctant. She was unwilling to accept that Finn did not trust her, nor accept that Finn had given up on her without seeing the truth of the matter.

Jeanne did not tell Monica at that time that Finn had seen it clearly.

But without substantive evidence, whatever Jeanne said would not be taken seriously by Monica.

“Jeannie, we’re living in the twenty-first century. Would sleeping together change anything?” Monica replied and smiled. “Though at that time, I naively thought that he would believe me if I managed to seduce him and show him my naked body. It turns out that your warning earlier was right. Finn hates me to death now. No matter what I do, he thinks that I’m disgusting.”

“What happened that made you realize the truth?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Just a lot of unpleasant things.” The first thing Finn had wanted to do after she’d slept with him was strangle her. The second was to tell her to get lost. The third was to kiss her cousin in front of her. And so on...

These were still very humiliating moments for Monica and she planned to bear the weight of it alone.

Jeanne wanted to press her further when Monica blurted, “By the way, my cousin is now pursuing Finn romantically.”

“What?” Jeanne frowned.

“It’s Sarah Harrison. You should have seen her before. She’s the little girl who used to stay in our house. She used to complain all the time and always got me into trouble,” Monica explained.

“I know her. I mean, Sarah Harrison likes Finn?”

“Surprise, surprise!” Monica’s tone was unreadable. It felt like she was someone who’s seen through this world. “I’m equally as surprised. In my heart, Sarah is just a little brat. She’s the kind of brat who only knows to kiss up to the adults. I never would’ve thought that she would grow up and seduce men.”

“I don’t think Dr. Jones would be the type to be interested in a girl like Sarah.”

“Well, he’s no match for her persistence,” Monica said. “Do you know how I got Finn all those years ago?”

Jeanne didn’t answer.

Monica said, “It’s all about being thick-skinned. Finn had no choice but to be with me because I pestered him non-stop. Now, Sarah has one upped me on this.”

“What did she do?”

“She almost died in a car accident because of Finn. So, Finn is feeling extremely guilty now. From my personal experience, once a woman breaks Finn’s first line of defense, she’s set as long as she doesn’t give up the pursuit.”

“So... You’re jealous?” Jeanne asked.

“What’s there to be jealous about?” Monica retorted. “I wish them both a hundred years of happiness!”
