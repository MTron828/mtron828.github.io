Chapter 1478: Shelly and Nox Fight

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly looked at Nox, who had suddenly become smarter. However, she was not so kind as to let him know the truth.

She would let him and Zoe live forever. Zoe would give birth to three sons, but none of them would be his. Most importantly, they would all have different fathers, and the daughter they had when they got older would be brown-skinned.

The thought of Nox being cuckolded for the rest of his life made her very excited, and she said, “Yes, I did.”

Nox’s eyes narrowed. “Shelly, I’m giving you a chance to prove your innocence.”

“There’s no need to prove myself. I did what I did. I don’t need to prove it.” Shelly decided to take all the blame.

She was not doing it out of spite. Rather, she just wanted Nox to never find out the truth. She wanted him to live in a world of deception forever, until one day, he suddenly realized how many times he had been cuckolded.

It would be best if he found out about it when he could no longer stir up trouble. Then, even if he wanted to take revenge, he could not.

“Shelly, let me ask you this again-”

“It’s me. There’s no need to ask!” Shelly said calmly.

Nox’s expression was ugly, and the veins on his face were bulging from how angry he was. He even looked like he might strangle her again in the next second. However, in the next second, he opened the door and left angrily.

Shelly could only pray that he did not come back after he left. As such, she quickly left the hospital as well. Considering Nox had been angry all day, who knew what he would do next?

She even took a taxi back because she was afraid that Nox would catch her again while she was waiting for the bus, and she really wanted to avoid him.

The moment Shelly sat in the taxi, she received a text message.

When she opened it to take a look, she saw that tens of thousands of dollars had been transferred to her name. Shelly counted the zeros and realized it was 50,000 dollars. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Nox had finally given her the money, and the medical fees had not been deducted.

Shelly put down her phone. For some reason, she knew that Nox would never torture her again and she could peacefully accompany Bei Bei to treat her illness.

Nox had told someone to transfer the money.

From now on, if he was the one who went looking for Shelly or caring about her again, he would look down on himself.

With that, Nox took out his phone and made a call.

“Nox?” It was Zoe’s sweet and soft voice.

He must have gone mad to rather be tortured by Shelly than be with his fiancée. He even believed that if he spent a few more seconds with Shelly, he would lose two years of his life in jail.

He asked, “Where are you? I have something to tell you.”

“I’m at home. Come over.”

“Wait for me.”

“Alright.” The other party nodded obediently.

After that, Nox put down his phone. He had thought it through and decided that had to confess to Zoe.

The taxi stopped at Zoe’s luxurious apartment. The moment Zoe saw Nox, she was shocked, and her face turned pale. “Nox, what happened to your face?”

Her concern for him was obvious, and she was worlds apart from Shelly, that selfish and heartless woman who only wanted him and even his money. “And your neck. What happened to you?” Zoe asked in shock.

Tears were streaming down her face.

“I got into a fight with a woman.”

‘Who dares to fight with you and beat you up like this? Could it be your mom?” “No. It was an unimportant person,” Nox said calmly.

Zoe wanted to ask something else, but Nox interrupted her with a serious look on his face. “I’m looking for you today because I have something important to tell you.”

Zoe instantly became serious.

“I cheated.” Nox enunciated each word.

Zoe’s eyes flickered.

She did not expect Nox to confess to her. In fact, she had planned to leave some evidence behind so that she could make a deal with Nox in the future.

However, now that he had confessed, what was the point of her doing all that? What kind of stupid idea did Brandon come up with?

“The night before last, we were both drunk. Then, I was drugged and had sex with a woman.” Nox said bluntly, “I’ve already sent that woman away, and I guarantee that she won’t affect our marriage.. But I wonder if you’d still want to marry me?”
