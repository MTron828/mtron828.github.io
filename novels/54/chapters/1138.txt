1139 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

She had to work hard now and make up her mind to give up on Finn.

Sarah said, “I’ve broken up with Finn.”

At that moment, Monica’s fingers that were typing on the keyboard paused for a moment. However, she did not show any emotions and continued to work.

On the other hand, Ruby, who was peeling fruits, was a little surprised.

After such a long time, Ruby had also returned to her normal self. It was probably because she had accepted the fact that Gary might not wake up again.

She was even wondering whether she should leave the hospital with her family. Then, she would come to visit Gary every day.

After all, it was not a good idea for the whole family to stay in the hospital.

When she heard what Sarah said, she was a little surprised. “Why did you guys break up? Did something happen?”

“No.” Sarah was unwilling to admit that their relationship was fake from the very beginning.

She also had her reputation to keep.

“Why did you break up if nothing happened?” Ruby said with concern, “Relationships are not child’s play. How can you break up just like that?”

“I’m only 18 years old. I’m so young. How can I be so devoted to someone?” Sarah made up a random excuse. “I don’t like Finn anymore. I like a boy in my class.”

Ruby was speechless. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Monica also turned to look at Sarah.

“Can’t I like someone else?” Sarah made herself look brave. “My classmates are like that too. They break up in the shortest time possible. I’ve been with Finn for a long time.”

“You said that you almost gave up your life for Finn back then, and now, you don’t like him just because you say so? You child, what can I say about you?!” Ruby said in a reproachful tone, “Don’t you think it’ll be embarrassing for us to face Finn considering that we tried so hard to matchmake the two of you?”

“What’s there to be embarrassed about? It’s not as if Finn had feelings for me. He only got together with me because he found me annoying. Now that I’ve taken the initiative to stop liking him, he can’t be happier.”

“I should’ve known that children are unpredictable.” Ruby did not accept Sarah’s choice of words. “I won’t interfere with who you date next time.”

“You shouldn’t have interfered in the first place. I’m a grown-up now. Don’t you think I know what I like?”

“Yes, yes, yes. You’re a grown-up.” Ruby would not blame Sarah. “It’s good that you broke up. Finn is indeed much older than you, and you two don’t match.

“Yes.” Sarah nodded.

“I’ve peeled some fruits for you. Eat more, especially Monica. Don’t work all the time. Eat something,” Ruby instructed.

“Alright,” Monica replied.

“I’ll go see your dad now.” After that, Ruby washed her hands and left the ward.

Only Sarah and Monica were left in the ward.

Sarah ate the fruit her aunt had peeled and looked at her cousin as she ate. “Your mom wants you to eat something.”

Monica gave a simple response to acknowledge Sarah.

“Cousin, can you stop?” Sarah was not used to Monica being so busy.

At that moment, Monica had just finished one of her tasks.

However, Sarah was making a lot of noise beside her, which made it difficult for her to concentrate.

In the end, she turned off the computer.

Then, she picked up the fork from the fruit plate in front of her and took a bite of the fruit.

“Cousin, I broke up with Finn. Don’t you feel anything?” Sarah asked seriously.

Her cousin used to like him, so she should be a little emotional.

However, there was nothing. Monica did not even say a word and just shook her head lightly. It was as if the person she was talking about was a stranger to Monica.

Since Sarah did not get any answers from her cousin, she said faintly, “Finn really has no heart. I don’t even know how you managed to woo Finn back then. How did you manage to move Finn back then? I originally wanted to copy your method to get Finn, but I realized that I don’t have the perseverance to do so. I simply can’t keep giving, while the other person is completely unmoved.”

Monica ate some fruit and said, “Perhaps I was young and ignorant at that time.”

“I’m about the same age as you were back then. I’m also ignorant, but I still have feelings. I’ll get hurt too.” Sarah did not agree with Monica’s explanation.

Monica did not know how to explain it to Sarah. She could not possibly tell Sarah that she probably loved him more deeply than he loved her.

At that time, she felt that it had to be Finn.

She pursued him with all she had in her and did not give herself any excuse to back off. She just kept pursuing him.

“Cousin, don’t have feelings for Finn anymore.” When Sarah did not get an answer, she continued.

“I don’t like him anymore.” Monica did not seem to be lying. Her tone was so calm that it sounded like she really had no feelings for him anymore.

“I used to think that you weren’t worthy of the quiet, reserved, and mature Finn, but now I realize that he’s not worthy of your love for him at all. Not to mention when you were dating, even during the three years of your marriage, how did you persist in facing Finn’s indifference? You persisted for so many years!”

“I wasn’t persistent. I always asked for a divorce.” Monica even seemed to smile.

They would argue about getting a divorce every day, but she just could not bear to do it. In the end, it was because of Michael that they got divorced.

Thinking about it now, she found it ridiculous.

“Cousin.” Sarah suddenly grabbed Monica’s hand.

Monica was stunned.

To be honest, she was not used to Sarah’s sudden intimacy even though she did not reject it.

“The two of us used to have some conflicts because of Finn, but I hope that we can make up in the future.” Sarah said seriously, “Although I admit that I’ve always been a little jealous of you and even deliberately let you be beaten and scolded by your mom and dad, deep down, you’re still a very important person to me. I was heartbroken when I saw you suffering so much. So, I don’t want to hide my feelings for you anymore. Cousin, I’d like us to be the best of sisters.”

Monica smiled faintly.

She did not expect Sarah to be so nice to her one day.

However, she pushed Sarah’s hand away. “Don’t think that you can please me by saying something nice. I’ve never forgotten all the grievances you made me suffer in front of my parents since I was young!”

...

“Why are you so vengeful?” Sarah broke down.

When did her cousin become so two-faced?

“I’ve always been.”

“Monica–”

“Don’t come near me. I won’t go soft.”

“Monica–”

In the room, the atmosphere was good with the two of them joking around.

Finn’s footsteps left just like that.

He probably felt that his appearance would be a little out of place. That was why he gave up on looking for them to discuss Gary’s treatment.

It was true. She meant it when she said she did not like him anymore.
