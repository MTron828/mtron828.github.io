Chapter 117: Danger Lurks Everywhere

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monday.

Alexander brought Jeanne and signed an on-site cooperation agreement with MUK West.

The cooperation with MUK was finalized.

The news spread over the media like wildfire.

In an instant, the stock market of the Lawrence Enterprise rose, and even became a hot topic.

Countless business executives in the business world called Alexander to congratulate him. Alexander was drowned in his own glory as he was being flattered, praised, envied, and acknowledged.

He indulged in this kind of joy, unable to extricate himself.

On the contrary, the party who actually negotiated the contract was quite calm.

Jeanne sat in the conference room and she was in the middle of a meeting.

Her expression was serious.

She said, “Winning the cooperation of MUK is something worth celebrating, but it doesn’t mean that we can relax. Once the contract is signed and we agree on the outcome, there will be more things to work on. Everyone, please be prepared. Before that, I will first make a new adjustment in our office.”

All the managers of the marketing department, as well as Joshua, were in the meeting room. There were also people from her project team.

Everyone was listening quietly.

Perhaps it was her natural leadership. As soon as Jeanne opened her mouth to speak, she would inexplicably attract people’s attention.

Her manner of speech was neither slow nor hurried, but her tone was sonorous and forceful. “First of all, the project team will not be disbanded and will remain as an active team in the company. In order to increase the work efficiency, I will apply for a separate office for the project members to work alone. The cooperation with MUK Group will involve many unexpected matters, and the project team will be fully responsible for them. Everyone in the project team will only listen to the arrangements of the project team leader. Other centers and departments can provide their opinions, but the team project team has no obligation to obey them. The team leader of the project team will no longer be me, but Mr. Forrest Jackson.”

Forrest was a little surprised by the sudden appointment.

He looked straight at Jeanne. Before this, he had not communicated with her directly.

Jeanne returned his gaze. “Team leader Jackson, you will have a lot of responsibilities in the future. Thank you for your hard work.”

“I… I will work hard.” After many years in the workplace, he was suddenly so nervous at the moment that he stuttered.

Perhaps it was not because he was nervous, but because he was a little excited.

After being in the workplace for so many years, his passion had long been hollowed out. However, he suddenly seemed to be ignited with passion again.

Jeanne nodded slightly and did not waste any time. She continued with the work arrangements, “Next, let’s talk about our collaboration this time. The first thing we need to do is to establish the logistics warehouses.”

Everyone present listened attentively.

Jeanne spoke frankly, “The online construction and operation will be carried out by the professional team from MUK Group, while some of the current basic equipment will be provided by our company. When I mention the logistics warehouses, it is not just building warehouses all over the country. What we need to build is a logistics ecosystem. A logistics industry that specializes in distributing goods for our e-commerce platform. The goal is to turn online transactions into offline deliveries faster. Without any further ado, I will make a comprehensive work arrangement for the logistics warehouses. Everyone, please make a meeting record to improve the efficiency of the meeting.”

“Yes.” Everyone quickly agreed.

Jeanne began to divide the work of the logistics warehouses.

Including a location requirement across the country, investment requirements, the building standards of the warehouse, a purchase of logistics vehicles, a staff expansion of logistics, and so on. Everything was detailed, so people did not need to waste time and deliberately find out more about what they should do.

This meeting lasted a little longer.

However, no one seemed to find it boring, except for Joshua.

Joshua’s attention was not on work, but entirely on jealousy.

He was jealous that Jeanne had this ability. He was jealous that every word she said hit the nail on the head. He was jealous that she had such a strong aura. He was jealous that she could arrange everyone’s work so well that she was even worshipped.

“Finally, I would like to emphasize my work principles. First, under normal circumstances, I only have two meetings a week. I don’t like to waste my time and effort on meetings. I also ask the supervisors to adjust the length and frequency of your meetings. Try to convey the purpose and main points of the meetings to everyone in a simple and clear manner. Secondly, since I only have two meetings a week, I will make work distributions twice. That is to say, we have to complete the two goals in a week. I don’t accept any delays or even failure to complete them. If you have any difficulties, please come to my office immediately. If you can not complete your work by the deadline and did not mention any difficulties you are facing during the meeting, I will not accept any explanation and give corresponding punishment. All in all, the deadline for today’s work is Wednesday. I’d like to ask the heads of office to make their own overall planning and division of responsibilities. Meeting adjourned.”
