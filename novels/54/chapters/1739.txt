Chapter 1740: Nox’s Love For Babies

Nox carefully passed the baby to Shelly, who was more skilled than Nox in carrying the child. She held the baby in her arms and could not help but smile. It was obvious that she liked the baby very much.

Nox looked at Shelly and the warm smile on her lips. It seemed Shelly could smile so naturally at anyone but not to him.

His eyes flickered, and just as he was about to shift his gaze, he heard Shelly say, “Nox, you didn’t hold the baby the right way.”

“Huh?” Nox looked at Shelly.

He was actually a little excited because Shelly rarely took the initiative to talk to him.

“You were nestling the baby in your arms just now, which could be uncomfortable for her. When you hold her, you must rest one hand behind her head, back, and little butt. Just like this.” Shelly was demonstrating to Nox, who observed attentively.

Monica watched their interaction from the side and could not help but tease,

“Shelly, are you using my baby for Nox to practice?”

Shelly was stunned. She did not think too much about it.

“Just go ahead and train him. A person like Nox should be allowed to practice being a father as soon as possible. Otherwise, he won’t be able to help at all when the time comes,” Monica said generously.

Shelly pursed her lips. At that moment, she felt a little uncomfortable.

“Speaking of which, I didn’t expect Nox to like children so much. I always thought you didn’t like them, but when I saw you holding my baby just now, you were so gentle,” Monica said straightforwardly.

Nox was also a little uncomfortable, and he did not intend to make things difficult for Shelly.

He said to Monica, “I’ve always been so gentle, okay? Of course, my gentleness is not for you.”

“Tsk, I don’t care either.” Monica rolled her eyes. “I have Finn.”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk. I wonder who it was who said you wanted to break up with him back then!”

“Nox, are you trying to sow discord between us?

“Even if I want to sow discord, I can’t. Everyone knows how deep of a relationship the two of you have!”

“Hehe. At least you’re self-aware.” Monica did not hide her smile.

The atmosphere in the room returned to normal because of the conversation between Nox and Monica.

Shelly held the baby for a while before returning it to Finn. When Finn held the baby again, she could see how much Finn doted on his child, and for some reason, she was infected by him. It made her wonder whether men would look forward to the birth of their child.

She turned to look at Nox, and there was an indescribable feeling in her heart. It was as if… something was stuck in her heart, making her feel suffocated.

Shelly did not stay in the ward for long before she had to leave since Bella was about to be dismissed from school. Hence, Nox left with Shelly.

When they were leaving, Shelly said in a low voice, “I can head back myself. If you want to stay longer, go ahead Don’t worry about me.”

“There’s nothing fun here.” Nox said nonchalantly, ‘What’s the point of hanging around two kids?”

He clearly enjoyed himself very much just now, but Shelly did not expose him. She sat in Nox’s car, and they went to Bella’s kindergarten together. Shelly had to wait at the door for a while before Bella was sent out.

The moment she was sent out, the teacher said to Shelly, “Mrs. Carter, there will be a parent-child sports day next Tuesday. Remember to bring Bella’s father along.”

“Next Tuesday?” Shelly asked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Yes.”

“Must both parents attend?” Shelly confirmed again.

“It’s best that both parents attend since most of the children will be with both their parents. If the child is only with a father or a mother, they might be disappointed. To not disappoint the child, I suggest that both parents participate. Of course, if one party is not available, the mother can also participate alone,” the kindergarten teacher said gently.

“Alright.” Shelly nodded without rejecting her directly.

Shelly held Bella’s hand and said to Bella with a smile, “Say bye to your teacher.”

“Bye, ” Bella said.

The kindergarten teacher also waved Bella goodbye while Shelly brought Bella back to the car..
