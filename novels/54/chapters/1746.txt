When he was serious, he was really serious.

Shelly looked away, and not long after, Nox and Bella went onstage. Nox gave Bella a determined look, and Bella hurriedly nodded, looking very confident.

As soon as the match began, Bella took the ball and threw it at Nox. Her aim was not at the basket, but Nox caught the ball according to the direction Bella threw it. It was as if they had both exchanged roles.

After all, although the distance between the two of them was not far, it was really difficult for a three-year-old child to throw the ball into the basket. Therefore, the parents of the other groups were wiped out, while Nox received every ball steadily. It even attracted the attention of the entire class.

Those who were not in the competition started counting for Nox and Bella. “15, 16, 17, 18…”

The more Bella threw, the more confident she became. Shelly was also touched to see Bella’s eyes light up because Bella, who had always been an introvert, had never been as lively and cheerful as she was now.

When one minute was up, Nox and Bella naturally won. They even broke the kindergarten record. Just like that, the first activity was over.

The second activity was to piggybacking. It was to put the child on the parent’s back, and the parent would run according to the prescribed path. Whoever completed the path in the shortest time would win.

Just as Shelly wanted to participate, Bella immediately said, “Uncle, good luck!”

“Alright.” Nox agreed immediately.

As such, Shelly held her tongue.

When the match began. Nox told Bella to hold on to him firmly while he held her on his back with both hands. Bella obediently grabbed onto him.

Nox was a little slow at the start because he was afraid Bella would be frightened and wanted to make sure Bella felt safe. Therefore, he naturally held back a little. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Once he saw that Bella was fine with it, he said, “Bella, I’ll speed up now!” “Alright.” Bella seemed rather excited.

With a smile, Nox dashed forward in the next second, his speed shockingly fast. Not only was Bella not frightened, but she was also beyond excited.

She kept shouting, “Go, Daddy, go!”

Nox was the first to cross the finish line. Again, they won first place, and everyone cheered for them. After that, Bella was the one who asked Nox to participate in the water-balloon race, kangaroo jumping, ring tossing, and other activities.

Shelly suddenly felt like she was here to be a pretty face. Previously, when Bella was in other kindergartens, she had also participated in parent-child activities. She and Bella had always participated in them together, but now she had been ignored.

She watched the interaction between Nox and Bella. The smile on Bella’s face showed her undisguised fondness for Nox. After all, Nox was talented in sports; he was first in all the activities.

In the past, she and Bella had always been ranked at the bottom. Every time she comforted Bella, she would tell Bella that the most important thing was that they participated. Although Bella did not cry, children would always hope that their parents could be better and be praised by more people.

“Mommy,” Bella suddenly called out to Shelly.

Shelly came back to her senses.

“Mommy, isn’t Daddy amazing?” Bella’s face was filled with excitement.

Shelly nodded. “Yes.”

Bella was smiling from ear to ear. She said, “My teacher said that the school-wide relay race is up next. We have to cheer for Daddy!”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

Seeing that Bella’s face was covered in sweat, she took out a napkin and wiped it off for her.

Bella quickly said, “Mommy, Daddy’s face is covered in sweat too. Why don’t you wipe it off for him?”

Shelly was stunned.

“Daddy is going to compete in a while. What if Daddy’s sweat blocks his eyes and he falls?” Bella voiced her worries.

It was obvious that she liked Nox.

Shelly glanced at Nox, who was watching the other people on the field while drinking water. He probably did not notice their conversation.

“Mommy.” When Bella did not get a reply, she called out to Shelly like a spoilt child.

Shelly could not refuse Bella’s request. Hence, she thought about it for a moment before taking out another tissue and walking toward Nox.

Nox naturally saw Shelly, but before he could speak, he was stunned. He watched as Shelly wiped the sweat off his forehead with a tissue..
