1006 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

Under the same sky, in the presidential suite of a five-star hotel in South Hampton City, Jeanne was waiting in the room, waiting for an answer.

Tonight, Michael would send Brie away or kill her to silence her, and Mason followed them to their destination.

According to the current development, Michael’s method of sending Brie away should be the same as sending Eden away.

She looked at the real-time location that Brie had sent her.

Brie had already rushed to the dock and got on the speedboat.

The direction that the speedboat was heading toward was the place that the ship was going to pass through tonight.

Mason had already gone over in advance to make some preparations.

Half an hour later, Brie’s real-time location had not been updated yet as she was waiting for the ship that was about to pass by.

However, it did not take long. It was probably because Michael had calculated it accurately.

Brie boarded the ship, and the positioning began to change in the sea.

If his calculations were right, that would be the place where Brie would be killed, and Edward should have been buried in this part of the sea too.

Now, other than Michael and her, or perhaps Edward, no one else knew that Eden was no longer alive.

Eden’s parents probably only knew that he had escaped and not that Eden had died long ago.

Jeanne sent a message to Mason. “Be careful.”

Mason replied with one word, “Yes.”

Jeanne put her phone aside and casually lit a cigarette.

Recently, her smoking addiction seemed to have gotten worse. She had the urge to smoke, but after a few puffs, she felt nauseated.

In the end, she extinguished the remaining half of the cigarette.

At that moment, the phone on the coffee table rang.

She glanced at it and picked it up, only to hear Mason’s voice from the other end of the phone. “Brie has been saved.”

“How?” Jeanne asked.

“She listened to our suggestion and wore a bulletproof vest. So, when the bullet hit her heart, it didn’t take her life. The other party immediately threw her body into the sea, and we were waiting at the bottom of the sea. We’ve rescued her and are on our way back now.”

“The other party didn’t notice, right?”

“No,” Mason confirmed.

“Michael is too cunning. If he finds out that Brie is not dead, it will be difficult for us to accuse him in public. We must catch him off guard!”

“Okay,” Mason agreed.

“Confiscate Brie’s phone and take her to a secluded place. Get Nox’s men to keep watch over her, and don’t let her out before the case with the quality inspection department goes to court.” Jeanne said, “It’s best if she cooperates voluntarily.”

Mason alone could not guarantee that there would be no mistakes in tonight’s operation, so Jeanne asked Nox for help.

Nox had indeed provided her with a lot of manpower, and naturally, it helped a lot.

“I’ll come back after I’ve sorted everything out.”

“Thank you.”

“Be careful.” Mason reminded.

“Don’t worry.”

After ending the call, Jeanne took a deep breath.

Tonight’s matter had come to an end. Next, they would wait for Michael to court his own death.

She turned around and prepared to go to the bathroom to take a shower and sleep because she had to go to the hospital early the next morning for Gary’s surgery.

Hopefully, everything would go smoothly.

Just then, the doorbell suddenly rang. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

It was past midnight, so who could it be? Who would come to look for her so late at night?

She remained calm, took out her gun at once, and quickly walked to the door.

As she looked at the man standing at the door through the surveillance footage, her heart skipped a few beats.

She pursed her lips before opening the door to see Edward, who was dressed in a suit and leather shoes, standing there, looking imposing.

“Do you have to be so guarded against me?” Edward said.

At that moment, he could see the gun she was holding.

When Jeanne returned to her senses, she put down the gun and said, “I didn’t expect it to be you.”

“You’ve contacted Finn, Nox, and George… but you didn’t contact me. So, if I didn’t take the initiative to come to you, you probably wouldn’t remember me.” Edward’s voice was cold and indifferent.

There was not much emotion in his tone.

However, Jeanne suddenly chuckled and said, “Are you jealous, Fourth Master?”

Edward chuckled as well.

When that man smiled, he could really cause the downfall of a city.

Then, he suddenly moved closer to her, and his tall body leaned over.

Jeanne tensed up. It was because of his powerful aura that she could not help but feel nervous.

His face was close to her cheek, and the two of them were very close to each other.
