Thank you readers!

It was best for outsiders not to interfere.

Zoe watched as Monica left, and her expression was a little ugly. She knew Monica must have suspected her. Fortunately, although Nox was very capable in all aspects, he was not great when it came to relationships.

When she first got together with him, she did not even believe that Nox had been with so many women. If he was really experienced in relationships, he would know what kind of woman she was.

All these years, she managed to coax him so well. He probably never thought that she would cheat on him behind his back.

However, Monica’s words just now did make her a little wary, and she wondered if it was time for her to stop.

Strangely enough, when Monica returned to the dining table, Nox was the only one at the dining table pestering Edward to drink. Finn and Candice were not around.

Where did those two go?

She had wanted to tell them that she would be leaving first. After all, she could not drink, and George was not coming down for dinner. There was no point in her hanging around.

It was past 10 p.m., and she still had a flight to catch, so she had to go back early to pack. At that thought, Monica looked around the hall and walked toward the tea room in the back garden.

She instinctively felt that Candice was there, and as expected, she saw Candice and Finn sitting together, seemingly discussing something.

Monica hesitated for a moment and decided not to say goodbye. However, the moment she turned to leave, Finn looked over at her.

Candice also looked over instinctually, as if she had undergone special training to notice when someone was approaching her.

“You broke up with Monica?” Candice followed Finn’s line of sight and asked.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“Why did you break up?”

“I don’t know.” Finn smiled bitterly.

He really did not know why Monica dumped him. Just when he thought their relationship was stable, he was dumped and could not woo her back.

“Monica probably thinks that you don’t love her,” Candice blurted out.

As soon as she said that, she was surprised. It was as if she knew their relationship very well.

On the contrary, Finn nodded calmly. “Yes, but she doesn’t seem to believe anything I do.”

“She probably doesn’t dare to believe it.” Candice did not want to doubt herself anymore.

Finn nodded.

“Are you planning to give up?”

“I just don’t know what to do.” “Does she know everything you’ve done for her?”

“She should know,” Finn replied.

“Should?” Candice raised her eyebrows.

“She knows that I sent her flowers, but she refused to accept them,” Finn said.

Then, he thought about how she gave the flowers to someone else, and his expression changed.

“What else?”

“I would cook for her too.” Finn said, “When we lived together, I would cook whenever I had time, and she would eat with me too.” “When she’s not around, do you cook for yourself?”

“Yes.”

“So…” Candice raised her eyebrows.

At that moment, Finn seemed to have realized something.

“What else did you do for her?” Candice continued to ask.

“I saved her once with my life. Although it was a long time ago, she should remember it. ”

“I heard she also saved you once.”

“That was why I thought we love each other,” Finn said bluntly.

“It was because you think you both loved each other that you took the relationship for granted.”

Finn was speechless.

“How about this? Tell me how you and Monica usually get along.” Candice felt that that was very important.

“We…” Finn paused for a moment. “We’ve broken up and got back together many times, but there was a time in between when we completely gave up on each other. But later on, we got back together, and I really wanted to start over with her. I assumed she thought the same too, so I got along with her like how I normally do. I felt that the best relationship was one in that we could be comfortable with each other. So, we didn’t get too involved in each other’s lives. Besides, we’re really busy. Sometimes, we’re so busy that we might not even be able to talk for a day…” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His face darkened. He suddenly realized that in the three years that he and Monica were together… nothing happened between them.

The only thing they did was live together. They did not even have a real heart-to-heart conversation. He could recall that the most time they spent together was… going to bed and sleeping..
