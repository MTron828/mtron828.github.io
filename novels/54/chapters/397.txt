Chapter 398: Finn Awakens, and I Want to Give Him a Child! Translation

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She knew.

After all, she had changed too much.

“I’ve also investigated you, but other than knowing that you and Kinglsey have a deep relationship, I didn’t really discover anything else. I also won’t hide this from you. I don’t know what Kingsley does for the time being, so I don’t know your identity.”

Jeanne remained silent.

There were just some things that she did not want to say.

“To be honest, I’ve warned Fourth Master Swan to keep an eye on you from the very beginning. I think you should also know that a person like Fourth Master Swan would know that you’re different from before — that you returned a changed person and might pose a threat to him. However, he still married you in the end.”

“What are you trying to say?”

“I don’t know your motive, nor do I know why you suddenly left Fourth Master Swan but decided to marry him. However, I’ll tell you that Fourth Master Swan really likes you and has liked you for many years.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Actually, she did not want to hear too much.

“Otherwise, do you think you could have gotten into his bed so easily seven years ago?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

Jeanne looked at Nox, a little surprised at what he said.

......

He said many years ago… Did Edward’s feelings for her not start seven years ago?

Nox said, “I’ll add this last bit. Fourth Master Swan’s current condition is actually not good for his body. He has been unconscious for so long is because his body needs to recuperate, to calm down his entire body and mind to recover and adjust. However, you know that sometimes, when the cells in the body have been worked to their limits, it’s very difficult for them to recover. To put it simply, the elasticity of a spring would become weaker and weaker the more times it’s used. One day, when it’s used up, it will have no more elasticity! And at that stage, a spring is useless, and in regards to a person, a person would... die.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

“If Fourth Master Swan didn’t protect you and gave you the only watch that he knew I could help, he wouldn’t be in this state,” Nox said, enunciating each word clearly to Jeanne. “I’m not saying all these to make you feel guilty, nor do I think there’s anything wrong with Fourth Master Swan protecting you so much. I’m just telling you all this to let you know that Fourth Master Swan treats you very well. If there’s a day when the two of you have a conflict, and you want to attack him, please show him mercy.”

After all, he believed it would be very easy for Jeanne to kill Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne did not reply, and Nox was not looking to get a reply from her anyway.

Hence, he turned around and said, “I will take my leave now. Please clean him up so that he can sleep more comfortably.”

After that, Nox left, leaving Edward and Jeanne in the room.

Jeanne was silent for a while before she turned around and looked at Edward lying on the bed.

Nox’s words rang in her ears. “When you want to attack him, please show him mercy.”

Her heart tightened.

Kingsley did not say that he wanted to attack Edward. He only said that they had different standpoints.

Standpoints... Why were they different?

She turned around, walked into the bathroom, and took a shower.

After this day, she also needed to relax and calm herself down, especially after learning Edward’s inhuman physique and hearing Nox’s words…

.

In fact, she was not as indifferent as she thought.

After she took a shower and changed into clean pajamas, she wrung a hot towel, wiped Edward’s body down, and changed his clothes for him.

Seeing that he was still in deep sleep, she did not feel sleepy at that moment.

She had not gotten any rest since the accident the day before yesterday, but she just could not fall asleep.

She took out a cigarette from the drawer and walked to the balcony, where she sat on the sofa chair and smoked the cigarette.

As smoke filled the air, Jeanne took out her phone. She was surprised to find that it was still functional after being soaked in seawater.

Then, she dialed Kingsley’s number.

The call went through very quickly, as if he was waiting for her call.

“Are you out of danger?” the person on the other end of the call asked.

“Sure enough, you know everything.” Jeanne did not beat around the bush.

“I do.”

“Was it your doing?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She was sure that the body she saw a second before she found Edward was Kingsley’s subordinate.

Although she had never met him before, she heard that Kingsley had a professional killer with a red birthmark on his neck, codenamed “Red Spot Killer”. He was ranked very high in the world of assassinations.

However... he still died a horrible death in Edward’s hands.

“Warren Sanders wanted to verify Fourth Master Swan’s strength,” Kingsley said bluntly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What was the purpose of the verification?”

“To determine if they can touch the Swans now.”

“So, what’s the result?”

.

“They can’t touch them,” Kingsley said. “But they have become a threat to the Sanders.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

“I warned you not to involve your emotions.”

“Kingsley.” Jeanne’s expression was grim. “Did Warren issue a killing order?”

Kingsley stayed silent.

“He wanted to kill me too?” Jeanne asked.

She knew very well that during the chase, the other party did not hold back against her.

If she were not careful, she might have died in the Balti Islands.

“It’s so that Fourth Master Swan won’t suspect you,” Kingsley said.

Jeanne sneered.

It meant that if she were to die tragically… she would be dead.
