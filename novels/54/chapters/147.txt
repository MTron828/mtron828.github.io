“Yes.”

“Can he be trusted?”

“We don’t have any other choice for the time being.”

Melody endured it and did not want to belittle Eden anymore. She said, “I gave my instructions just now. If any accident happens tomorrow, the official department will arrive late due to ‘circumstances’. They will only go to the scene to deal with it after Eden’s people leave. Micheal, we’ve already done so much. We can’t fail again this time.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Okay.”

“How’s your father’s situation?” Melody suddenly thought of it.

Micheal pursed his lips. “The doctor said that he’s fine for the time being, but he needs to recuperate.”

“I also mentioned your current situation to my father just now. My father told you not to worry too much. If anything really happens to your father, my father will personally support you. He won’t let your family decline like this.”

“Help me thank him.” Micheal appeared to be very respectful.

“As long as you sincerely support the Sanders, my father will not mistreat you. Moreover, with me around, I will always help you put in good words in front of my father.”

“Thank you.”

“In short, you don’t have to bear the burden.”

“Okay.”

“I’ll hang up now,” Melody said. “We’ll see the results tomorrow.”

“Okay.”

He hung up the phone.

Micheal rubbed his aching temples.

Actually, he was very tired.

When he returned this time, he suddenly received news that his father was critically ill. It was hard to accept.

Back then, he was forced to break up with Monica. He was unwilling, but he still accepted it for the sake of his official career in the end.

He had lived in a place where cheating and power were paramount.

He had seen too many people kneel in front of his father without any dignity in order to curry favor with him. He had also encountered a time when his father was schemed against and his life was on the line. His entire family was almost buried with him at that time.

His father had taught him since he was young that this was a world where the strong preyed on the weak. If he could not grow stronger, then he would be devoured by others. He could only continue to grow.

Under his father’s influence, he had a strong desire for power and status.

However, it could not be denied that back then, he really loved Monica when he dated her.

In fact, he had a crush on Monica for many years.

In high school, he was in the same class as Eden. Eden and Jeanne were dating, and Jeanne’s best friend happened to Monica, so they got to know each other.

Friendship was all there was between them.

In fact, he was very clear that he should have married a woman who was more beneficial to his career, and not the daughter of a businessman. Thus, he did not have a good impression of Monica, and even said that he would keep a distance from her.

However, there was once…

During a mock test in his third year of high school, he made a mistake in the performance test and fell from the first to eighth grade. That time, he was scolded by his father, and his mood was extremely low.

Coincidentally, that day, he agreed to go to the amusement park with Eden to relax his nerves. In order to prevent others from knowing his inner feelings, he did not refuse.

When he went, he saw that Jeanne and Monica were also there.

The four of them went together.

To give Eden and Jeanne some time alone, it was him and Monica who went together in the end.

Monica was really a very cheerful person. He had seen too many young ladies from influential families in the upper class. No one would be as carefree as she was.

He was actually a little envious.

Monica pulled him to the roller coaster.

He was a cautious person. He rarely did things out of his control, and felt that roller coasters were not suitable for him.

However, Monica was a stubborn person. She pulled him to line up and forced him to go with her.

As they sat on the roller coaster, Monica took the initiative to hold his hand. “If you’re afraid, hold my hand.”

How could Micheal admit that he was afraid?

Monica held on anyway. “I can see that you’re in a bad mood today. When you’re in a bad mood, you have to vent. Trust me!”

In fact.

The thrill of the roller coaster was never a concern in Micheal’s mind.

The only thing that had been touching him in the depths of his heart was Monica’s soft and warm hand, which was holding him tightly.
