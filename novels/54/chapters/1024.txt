1025 It’s Not Worth It For Kingsley

Weiss was clearly intimidated by Jeanne.

“Even if you’re gay, that part of your body is still important to you!”

With that, Jeanne left.

Lucy untied Kerby, dragged him out of the operating theatre, and sent him back to his room. Then, she went to Kingsley’s room.

She heard Jeanne and Kingsley arguing loudly in the room.

“I was the one who ordered Kerby to sleep with Lucy. If you want to touch Kerby, you might as well touch me! In any case, I’ve always been the one who disobeyed your orders!” Jeanne said valiantly.

Kingsley’s expression was extremely unsightly. “Do you have to go against me to feel good?”

“I just can’t accept your disregard for human life!” Jeanne said fiercely, “It’s said that it’s not easy to train an assassin. Even Mason told me that Kerby is a rising star, but now you want to castrate him? Do you want him to be like Cain and take a back seat, or do you want to take his life?”

“Those who disobey the rules of the Hills should be taught a proper lesson!” Kingsley was serious!

“Rules? What rules do the Hills have? To torture the assassins who are loyal to you as you desire? Is it an unforgivable crime for assassins to help each other?” Jeanne glared at Kingsley. “Are you really teaching him a lesson from the Hills’ standpoint, or are you just venting your anger on him?!”

“Jeanne!” Kingsley called out her name through gritted teeth.

Had it been anyone else, they would have been shot dead by Kingsley. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lucy also had the urge to argue with Kingsley. However, as she was standing at the door, she thought that Jeanne was the best candidate to confront Kingsley.

Jeanne was the only person who could piss Kingsley off so badly yet he would not hurt a single hair on her.

“What’s wrong? Are you upset that Lucy slept with another man?” Jeanne did not care about Kingsley’s feelings at all and continued to provoke him.

The veins on Kingsley’s face were bulging, and at that moment, he was so angry that his body was trembling.

“If you’re not comfortable with it, why don’t you think about how Lucy feels when you sleep with other women?”

“Enough!” Kingsley was filled with hostility. “Don’t think you know me very well!”

Jeanne glared at him.

“I’m telling you now that Lucy is just a body for me to vent. I admit that she is more attractive to me than most women, but that’s only because she is smarter than them and knows what I want. I can’t deny Lucy’s intelligence. She can think of many things for me that I can’t. Keeping her by my side will only bring me benefits and no harm!”

“Only beneficial and no harm?” Jeanne mocked.

“That’s right!” Kingsley was very determined.

“Kingsley, don’t you think you–” Jeanne was about to retort.

However, Lucy walked in from the door and interrupted, “If I tell you that I didn’t sleep with Kerby, can you let him go?”

Kingsley’s eyes flickered.

Jeanne also turned to look at Lucy.

The two of them clearly did not believe her, or to be more precise, they were shocked.

“I don’t know what to say to convince you that I didn’t sleep with Kerby. Even if I ask Kerby to prove it, you’ll only think that I’m working with him to deceive you! At this moment, I can only swear to God that I didn’t sleep with Kerby. If I disobeyed your order and slept with Kerby that night, I will be struck by lightning!” Lucy enunciated every word with a serious expression.

It could be said that oaths were quite cruel.

Jeanne believed her in an instant. In fact, she did not suspect Lucy just now; she was just a little surprised.

She had experienced being drugged before. If Finn had not given her the antidote last time, she could not guarantee that she would not have lost control in the end.

However, Lucy persisted. She did not take any antidote and persevered on her own.

Was it because she did not dare to disobey Kingsley’s orders or…

“I really didn’t sleep with Kerby.” Lucy continued to explain, probably because she thought that they would not trust her. “I know very well that if I disobey your orders, the consequences will be a hundred times more painful than being drugged. Rather than suffering greater torture for a moment of pleasure, I’d rather choose to endure for a night. I don’t care if you believe me or not, but I really endured it all by myself. I really did!”
