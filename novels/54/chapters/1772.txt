Therefore, when she pushed the door open and entered, she was shocked to see the two people hugging and kissing each other in front of her. They both had never interacted with each other back when they were in school. Yet now, they could not keep their hands off each other in the washroom.

Shocked, Shelly stared at them for a while and forgot to close the door. The people inside seemed too engrossed in each other and did not notice her.

“Don’t look.” A familiar male voice suddenly sounded from behind her.

At the same time, Shelly’s eyes were covered by his big hand. Only then did she come back to her senses and turned around. Even her whole face was red by then. She did not want to stare, but she was just too stunned to move.

As soon as she turned around, she was wrapped in Benjamin’s arms. At such a close distance, she immediately recognized Benjamin’s familiar scent and pushed him away the next second.

As the push came a little too suddenly and hard, Benjamin was pushed back a few steps Suddenly, the atmosphere became a little awkward. Shelly wanted to explain but did not know how to. She just thought they were too close, and her heart would… beat faster. Benjamin chuckled. “I’m sorry. I crossed the line just now.” “No.” Shelly quickly shook her head. “I’m j-just… not used to it.”

“I understand.”

Benjamin was not angry at all. On the contrary, he understood why she did it, but Shelly felt that she had hurt Benjamin.

“Um, why don’t you leave first? Now that everyone is drunk, nobody Imows who has left and who hasn’t. Besides, some really have left, so it’s fine.” Benjamin tried to persuade her.

He probably assumed that she was still a little shy and felt a little out of place in the group.

“I’ll leave with Sarah later. I don’t want to leave her here alone. I don’t think..” Shelly pursed her lips. “It’s safe.”

Benjamin could not help but laugh. “Don’t worry. Although everyone is having fun, they won’t mess around. You saw the two of them in the bathroom just now. They both wanted it. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t have forced it on each other. There is still basic decency.” “But Sarah is drunk and might not be conscious,” Shelly retorted.

Benjamin nodded. Shelly’s worry was not completely unreasonable.

“But looking at Sarah just now, I don’t think she’ll be able to leave anytime soon,” Benjamin said.

“It’s fine. I’ll wait for her.”

“Alright.” Benjamin said, “If you want to use the washroom, you can go to the public one outside. Just turn right and you’ll see it.”

“Okay.”

With that, Shelly left the room, and the noise from inside where noticeably quieter outside. She took a deep breath, not knowing if it was because it was too overwhelming inside or because Benjamin made her feel overwhelmed which made her chest feel heavy.

After walking into the bathroom and going to the toilet, she washed her face, which was a little red. Perhaps it was because the room was not well-ventilated.

She patted her face with water and sent a message to Nox. “I might be back late tonight. Is Bella asleep?”

“She’s asleep.” The other party even replied in an instant. “I’ll have to trouble you to watch over her a little longer.”

“It’s okay. Have fun.”

“Yes.”

“By the way, did you guys drive there? Do you want me to get someone to pick you up?”

“It’s okay. I’ll take a taxi back with Sarah.”

“Where are you now?” “Starlight Nightclub.” “Okay.” “I’ll see you later.”

“Sure.”

After Nox replied, he dialed a number.

“Mr. Winter.” The other side was extremely respectful.

“My girlfriend is in Starlight, and her name is Shelly. I’ll send you her photo. Once she is done tonight, get a car to send her home. Don’t say I arranged it. Just treat it as a normal pick-up.”

“Yes, Mr. Winter.”

Nox hung up. Then, he leaned back on the bed, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He felt that the room was empty with Shelly not around.

He sighed. How should he live without Shelly in the future?

When Shelly returned to the private room, it was still lively inside. Everyone was drinking, singing, and dancing crazily.

Shelly was sitting on the sofa, and her eyes were fixed on Sarah, who was really popular and could get along with everyone..
