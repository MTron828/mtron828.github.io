1205 It’s A Girl

“What about Uncle Gary?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“He saw that Monica could manage the company, so he chose to take the back seat. Moreover, because he’s recovering well, he would go out to have some fun with Monica’s mother from time to time.”

Jeanne listened quietly.

She was relieved that the Cardellinis’ hardships had finally come to an end.

“When are you and Monica going to have a child?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

Finn was stunned, and he even blushed.

He said, “Monica’s physical condition isn’t great yet. Let’s wait for her to recover a little longer.”

“Don’t tell me you haven’t slept together after so long?” Jeanne teased.

Finn pursed his lips and did not deny it.

Jeanne knew that would be his response. She said, “Even if you don’t have children, you can still enjoy the benefits between men and women.”

“Yeah,” Finn responded.

She did not know whether he was listening to her or not.

After the ultrasound, Jeanne got out of bed.

Finn was actually a gentleman. Other than looking at her protruding belly during the ultrasound, he would definitely be polite and not look at her after the ultrasound.

When the two of them were walking out of the ultrasound room, Finn began to explain the things she should take note of in the six months.

Jeanne was also listening attentively.

At that moment, she wondered how awesome it would be to have such a full-time doctor by Monica’s side if Monica was pregnant.

She was a little lost in thought.

“Jeannie,” Finn called out to her.

Jeanne returned to her senses. “I’m listening.”

She felt embarrassed, like when she was distracted in class and was caught by the teacher.

Finn handed Jeanne a piece of paper. “I’ve written down all the important points. Take a look when you have time.”

“I have a lot of time, so I’ll take a good look at it.” Jeanne smiled.

Finn was visibly stunned at that moment.

She had a lot of time because she could not go anywhere other than here.

Jeanne also knew what Finn was thinking. At first, she was quite upset about it, but as time passed, she was used to it.

She casually looked at the note and finally saw the line that said, “When can you have sex?”

Finn came back to his senses.

Every time the topic of sex was mentioned, Finn seemed a little embarrassed.

He was a man in his thirties, who had been married once but was now in love again. Moreover, his ex-wife and current girlfriend were the same person., so the fact that he was still so embarrassed now was really commendable.

“That will be this month because starting next month, it’s banned.” Finn used his professional knowledge to hide his embarrassment. “You and Fourth Master should make use of the time you have.”

Jeanne smiled.

She, too, wanted to make the best use of her time, but she could not see a certain someone.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.”

“Finn,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

Because of their relationship with Edward and Monica, the two of them had become more casual with each other.

“Is Nox feeling better?” Jeanne asked.

She could not help but ask him the same question every time, and every time, he would hope that a miracle would happen.

“Not yet, but it’s only been three months. Recovery isn’t usually that fast.”

Jeanne thought about it and agreed with him.

“You don’t have to worry too much about him. He’s in a good state of mind now and is actively receiving rehabilitation treatment. I believe that a person like Nox, who is all brawn and no brains, usually won’t have too bad of luck.”

She was speechless. Was he comforting her or “praising” Nox?

“You’re pregnant now, so the most important thing for you is to stay happy. The most important thing is that the baby in your stomach is a girl. You don’t want her to be sad the moment she’s born, do you? Little girls should be innocent and bright.” Finn smiled gently.

She always found that Finn was more talkative whenever he talked about children.

Jeanne could not help but ask, “You want children, right?”

Finn did not answer, and usually, not answering meant that he admitted it.

“By the way, do all men like daughters?” Jeanne asked him in a serious tone.

A long time ago, when Edward wanted to have a second child with her, he said that he would give George a younger sister.

It meant that subconsciously, he just wanted to have a daughter.

“Not all of them.” Finn said, “But Fourth Master definitely does.”

“What about you?” Jeanne asked.

“I ...” Finn smiled. “If it’s with Monica, both are good.”

“You’re making me envious of your relationship with Monica.” Jeanne could not help but laugh.

Finn was a little embarrassed. He cleared his throat and said seriously, “I still have another patient coming to the hospital for a checkup later, so I’ll take my leave now.”

...

“If you want a daughter, it’s best to have one soon.” Jeanne said, “I heard that it’s easier for women to give birth to boys after they turn 25.”

Finn was at a loss for words.

There was no such thing in the medical world. However, Finn could see where Jeanne was coming from.

Jeanne watched as Finn left Bamboo Garden through the glass door and looked in that direction for a long time before turning back.

She turned around and walked toward Teddy, who was preparing dinner.

She said, “George should be out of school soon.”

“It’s about time. I’ll ask the driver if he has picked George up.” Teddy was about to make a call.

“No need, I’ll do it. You do your thing.”

“Okay.”

When Jeanne returned to the sofa in the living room, she took out her phone and dialed George’s number.

“Mom.”

...

“Are you in the car yet?”

“I’m on it. I’ll be home in about ten minutes.”

“Okay. I’ll wait for you to come home for dinner.”

“Sounds good.”

After hanging up the call, Jeanne hesitated for a moment but still could not help but give Edward a call.

Every time she had a prenatal checkup, all she wanted was to share the news with him. For some reason, her heart was racing. However, the moment the call went through, the call was cut off.

As expected, Edward was still busy, so she quietly put down her phone and decided not to disturb him anymore.

She believed that he would come back after he was done with his work.

Jeanne turned on the television and watched it to kill time.

Not long after, George returned.

“Mom.” George sat next to Jeanne and said, “Our school is having a parent-child sports event next week.”

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

“My parents have to attend.”

“Alright,” Jeanne responded.

“Are you going to participate?” George asked.
