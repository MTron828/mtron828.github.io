Chapter 1409: The Failed Birthday Surprise

Thank you readers!

Candice’s self-introduction made everyone jealous. Was she trying to show off their love for each other by addressing herself as Edward’s wife?

Now, the man had a bright smile on her face.

Nox did not understand how could Edward have a change of heart. Back then… he and Jeanne loved each other so much that they did not even care about their lives!

“Hello, I’m Finn,” Finn said to make Candice feel less awkward.

“I’m Nox.” Nox echoed, “And this is my fiancée, Zoe.”

“Hello.” Candice was very friendly.

“Hello,” Zoe said enthusiastically. “I used to look at you from afar and thought that you were really beautiful. But now that I can see you up close, I realize your skin is perfect.”

“You flatter me.” Candice smiled.

Then, she looked at Monica, who looked back at Candice and said, “Monica.”

Candice could not help but laugh. “Of course, I know you. Come and sit down. George will be back soon.”

As she spoke, she took the initiative to hold Monica’s hand.

It was an intimate move, and Monica really wanted to shake her off, but… she could not. She told herself that she had to be respectful to the Leader of the country.

With that, the group sat on the sofa.

At that moment, Paige was also playing in the hall. Paige, who was very close to Candice, would call out for her mother with her sweet and cute voice from time to time. It was so cute that it could melt people’s hearts.

Monica kept looking at Page, lost in thought…

“I thought you didn’t like Paige?” Nox suddenly said.

Monica’s eyes flickered.

“Don’t you like me, Godmother?” Paige was playing with her toys on the ground when she suddenly looked up and asked.

Nox was dumbfounded that Paige heard him. After all, he said it in a low voice, and Paige was so focused on playing that he thought she did not hear him. Hence, he felt a little embarrassed.

Monica, however, was even more embarrassed. She glared at Nox, thinking, ‘He really deserves to be cuckolded.’

Despite that, she smiled and explained, “Uncle Nox is talking about Paige from the cartoon. I don’t like pink, so I don’t like pink pigs.”

“Oh.” Paige smiled sweetly and believed her.

She even got up from the ground, crawled to Monica with her short legs, and burrowed her small body into Monica’s embrace.

Monica’s entire body stiffened.

In fact, she knew that Paige was very clingy, so she always avoided her. She was afraid that she would have feelings for the cute Paige, but she just did not like the child that Edward had with another woman.

However, at that moment, she felt like her heart was about to melt.

“I like you the most, Godmother,” young Paige said in Monica’s arms.

Monica felt guilty. She felt that it was horrible of her to inflict the fault of the adults on the little ones.

“My brother said that Godmother is Mommy’s best friend.” Paige said with her sweet voice, “And Mommy’s best friend is my best friend. ”

The ‘mother’ George was referring to was Jeanne, whereas the ‘mother’ Paige was referring to was Candice.

Monica patted Paige’s little head and said gently, “Okay, I know. Be good and go play.”

She could not refuse Paige but did not want to go against her own principle. With that, Paige left Monica’s embrace and knelt down to play with her toys.

Candice, who was sitting beside Monica, saw Monica’s emotions and said, “It’s like Paige has magic.”

Monica looked back.

“I like her very much too.” Candice said, “I just can’t help but warm up to her.”

“Sometimes, I’m afraid to see her,” Monica muttered.

Candice understood why Monica felt that way. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Monica was afraid that she would fall in love with Paige, but she was also afraid that she would betray her best friend. After all, Monica did not know that Paige was Jeanne’s daughter.

At 7 p.m., George came back and was a little surprised to see his family.

He was driven back halfway through the journey for the reason that there was a problem over there, so he would go over next time. George did not resist even if he did not want to go back.

When he came back and saw that the house seemed to have been specially decorated, he vaguely knew something was up. However, George did not show it. He greeted everyone politely and was about to return to his room..
