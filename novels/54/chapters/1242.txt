1243 Zachary’s Death

Edward watched as Teddy helped Jeanne to the bathroom.

After Teddy helped Jeanne into the room, he turned around and waited for her outside. When he turned around, he saw Fourth Master standing at the door, giving Teddy a shock.

Edward gave him a look.

Teddy quickly nodded and left the room.

When Jeanne came out of the bathroom, she saw that Teddy was no longer around. Instead, Edward was waiting for her at the door.

She did not react to his presence, nor did she ask why Edward suddenly came over from Old Master Swan’s place. He probably had not had lunch yet. In fact, it was obvious that it was Finn who had informed Edward.

The two of them remained silent in the room, with Jeanne laying on the bed while Edward sat on the edge of the bed and watched as Jeanne tried to fall asleep.

After waking up so many times in one night, he finally understood why Jeanne was always sleeping.

“Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t feeling well?” Edward asked.

He knew that Jeanne was not asleep.

“You’re not a doctor anyway,” Jeanne replied.

Edward nodded. After all, he could not fault that answer.

“Finn just called me and told me that your sudden gastritis was caused by your irregular diet.”

“I feel much better now.” Jeanne did not seem to want to continue that topic.

“Do you also care about me being with Susan?”

“I’ll slowly accept it.” It meant that she would completely accept it. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Edward pursed his lips.

Sometimes, he really wished that Jeanne could be more emotional, but sometimes, he felt that… it was useless.

Anyway, he could not change what would happen in the end. Him wanting her to be emotional was just to satisfy the desire in his heart. Therefore, he gave up.

He said, “Go to sleep. I’ll stay with you for a while.”

“Alright,” Jeanne replied.

She no longer accepted or rejected him.

Edward stayed by Jeanne’s bedside for a long time until the phone that was on vibration rang. He glanced at it and then left the room.

After he left, Jeanne opened her eyes to look at Edward’s departing figure. After confirming that he had really left, she closed her eyes and truly allowed herself to fall asleep.

It was past 2 p.m. in the afternoon. Jeanne had had her lunch and was about to take a walk in the back garden when Edward appeared in the hall with Susan.

After he appeared, Edward went straight upstairs. Teddy was also called away by Edward, leaving Jeanne and Susan alone.

“You were looking for me?” Susan said.

Jeanne nodded. “Have a seat.”

She invited Susan to sit on the sofa beside her. With that, Susan sat down, and Jeanne also sat at the side.

“I’m not going to beat around the bush and waste your time.” Jeanne cut to the chase. “I’m mainly here to talk about my two children.”

“You mean George and the one in your belly?” Susan said bluntly.

Jeanne nodded.

“Don’t worry. Edward and I have already made our next plan.” Susan said, “Everyone in the country knows that George is your son, so I can only be his stepmother. But don’t worry, George is someone Alex likes, so no one will dare to treat him badly. As for the baby in your belly, I’ll announce to the public that it’s my child.”

Jeanne looked at Susan.

“I don’t think you’ll mind. As a mother, you probably don’t want your child to know that she doesn’t have a mother the moment she was born. That’s why Edward and I have arranged for the baby in your belly to be my child, and I will tell everyone, including the child herself. Of course, according to the time, it would be impossible for me to give birth to the child in your belly so soon. Even if I conceived the child on the first day I dated Edward, it wouldn’t be possible. So, after this child is born, we will hide it for a period of time and announce her age to the public. She’ll be half a year younger than her actual age.”

“Is this Edward’s arrangement?” Jeanne asked.

It turned out that Edward had already made all the arrangements and there was no need for her to worry too much.

Yet, she never trusted him.

In fact, what she wanted to talk to Susan about today was exactly what Susan had just said.

“He’s the one making the arrangements.” Susan replied, “Actually, I don’t have much say in front of Edward.”

Susan did not try to hide it.

Moreover, Jeanne could tell from Susan and Edward’s interaction that Susan had always taken the initiative, while Edward had always been cold to her.

“If you really want to be with Edward, it’s better to retreat in order to advance,” Jeanne said.
