1312 The First Negotiation With George

“Are you Candice?” The boy’s voice behind her made Candice turn around.

She saw George.

She could recognize George because he had appeared in the media, unlike Paige.

Paige was really well protected by Edward. Other than a few people close to her, no one knew what she looked like.

Those who did not know might think that Edward did not care for Paige.

Because in the eyes of outsiders, Edward prioritized things beneficial to him and

Paige was also a product of profit.

Even Candice once thought so herself. It was not until today that she realized how wrong she was.

Edward’s feelings for Paige could be seen with the naked eye.

On the contrary, it was George who seemed to be behaving more indifferently.

Perhaps, it was not indifference. Rather because George was older than Paige, and the next heir to the Chief, the requirements for George would definitely be much stricter than for Paige.

She had heard that George was very intelligent and had been nurtured like a genius since he was young. Edward often brought George to various activities. He was only ten years old, but he had already displayed extraordinary abilities.

“Yes, I’m Candice.” Candice’s lips curved into a smile. When she heard George’s displeased tone, she still showed her friendliness. “Nice to meet you, George. I hope we get along in the future.”

George scanned her from head to toe. At such a young age, he really had a maturity that did not match his age. It was a stark contrast to Paige.

Candice wondered if Edward had really given all his gentleness to Paige to make her so innocent, romantic, lively, and cute. George, on the other hand, was obviously different.

She could actually imagine how much responsibility he had to bear as the successor of the leader.

At this moment, she suddenly felt a little sorry for George—a ten-year-old child without a mother was forced to shoulder such a burden.

He said, “I don’t like you.”

She was caught off guard by George’s frankness, which was a little overwhelming like an arrow had pierced through her heart.

She even suspected that Edward had drugged her.

Otherwise, why would she have such… abnormal feelings for Edward and her daughter?

Her feelings for Paige were a little unacceptable.

There was also a sense of familiarity when seeing George right in front of her, apart from having the same feelings as she did for Paige.

Was she once… involved with them before she lost her memory?

Candice was shocked when she thought of this possibility. Hence, she denied her thoughts in the next second.

She still believed that it was fate; some fates were just so wonderful.

She quickly composed herself and smiled. “I know.”

George frowned.

After all, he was ten years old. He was much taller and bore the mien of a young man. He looked very mature, but he was still only a ten-year-old boy. No matter how complicated the world was at that age, it was still much simpler than the world of adults.

George was surprised by Candice’s answer. He stared straight at Candice, at this strange woman.

Truth be told, he knew before anyone else that his father would marry Candice.

Before the charity banquet that night, his father had told him that he was getting married. The moment George thought that his father would never remarry, he announced that he was getting married.

His father clearly still loved his mother. All these years, he had never forgotten, even if he did not show it. He knew that his father had been unable to let go of his mother because his father had come home drunk once and kept calling her name “Jeannie”.

That was his mother’s name.

Although his father had a brief relationship with Susan and even brought her here to stay for a period of time, he had never seen his father and Susan sleep together. Teddy also said that the two of them did not live together. Susan only appeared for certain benefits. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Therefore, Susan and his father did not last long.

That was the reason he had never thought that his father would marry someone else so soon.

Was he putting on an act again?! Was there some benefit to gain from such an act again?!

Either way, George did not like it.

He was very content with his current family.

Although his mother was missing, it had been so many years. He had learned to accept it. He did not want another person to disturb their peaceful life.

He always felt that other than his mother, he could not accept anyone else in this world.
