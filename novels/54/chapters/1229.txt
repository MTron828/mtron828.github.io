1230 Learning To Forget About Each Other

Edward did not reply because they were sleeping in separate rooms now. He did not know when she would wake up at night.

Of course, Finn was not one to speak out of turn either. He just had to pass on the message.

He said, “That’s about it. I’m going to take Jeannie’s blood for a test now, so I’m leaving.”

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

Finn took his things and turned to leave.

The moment he left, he suddenly thought of something. He turned around and said, “Fourth Master.”

“Yes,” Edward replied.

At that moment, Jeanne had already left his side.

Since Finn was leaving, she did not seem to want to… continue the act. However, she did not expect Finn to turn around again.

He said, “Can I tell Monica that Jeannie is alive and fine?”

It was because he really did not want to lie to Monica. He believed that if he told her that news, Monica would be very happy.

He did not know why but he felt that although Monica had moved in together with him, there was still a distance between them.

Perhaps everyone had been too busy.

Monica’s day was usually stressful. Other than the normal working hours, she would also be working overtime.

Finn, too, often had to work overtime because of the emergency treatment in the hospital.

Hence, the two of them had not spent much time together. Perhaps it was because they were too tired, but sometimes, when they were together, they would go on their phones, take a break, and then go to sleep.

That was why he thought that if he could tell Monica something that would make her happy, they could have more common topics to talk about.

For example, if Monica knew about Jeanne’s pregnancy and that the baby was a girl, he felt that Monica could talk to him for a long time.

“No!” Edward and Jeanne said in unison.

Such tacit understanding made Finn stunned for a moment, and both of them looked so serious that Finn felt as if he had been muddled by love and had lost his sense of propriety.

“It’s not that I don’t trust Monica, but…” Of course, Jeanne knew that her reaction made Finn feel embarrassed.

In fact, Monica was her best friend, and she would not trust anyone else in the world but Monica to keep her mouth shut.

However, she was about to die. If Finn told Monica now, would he not make Monica suffer again?

It was better to let her misunderstand and accept the fact that she was no longer around from the beginning.

“Finn.” Edward walked to Finn’s side.

Perhaps he had also realized that Jeanne did not want Finn to misunderstand.

“Come with me.”

Edward took Finn away.

Jeanne actually wanted to stop him, but on second thought, she could not stop him. Finn would know sooner or later anyway.

She watched the conversation between Edward and Finn from afar, watching as Finn’s expression became more and more serious, which meant that he knew.

With that, she turned around and went back to her room.

She did not want anyone to be reluctant to part with her. Sometimes, she even wished that when she left, everyone would be able to let go and not miss her.

Jeanne took a nap in her room.

She was always feeling sleepy. In fact, there were times when she did not want to sleep too much. After all, she would be sleeping forever soon. However, she could not stop herself from falling asleep.

When she opened her eyes again, it was already past noon. Usually, Teddy would not wake her up when she was asleep as he knew that she would wake up when she was hungry.

She was indeed hungry at that moment. Therefore, she quickly washed up and went downstairs.

The living room downstairs was in a mess, and Teddy was ordering the men in black suits to move things around.

Those people were naturally Alex’s men who monitored her and stopped her from going out.

Teddy had always found them annoying, but was he not making good use of them now?

“Madam, you’re awake.” When Teddy saw Jeanne, he quickly went up to her. “I’ll prepare lunch for you immediately.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne nodded and could not help but ask, “What are these? There are so many of them!”

“I don’t know. Fourth Master bought them, and he told me to move them to the rooms upstairs. I saw that these people had nothing to do, so I made them move the stuff,” Teddy explained.

Jeanne smiled.

Those men were nothing but free.

“Did Edward go out?”

“He went out after you fell asleep.”

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

She would not ask where Edward had gone.

She sat in the dining room, waiting for Teddy’s lunch. Teddy was usually very fast as he basically prepared everything in advance and only needed to heat it up.

Soon, a compact lunch was placed in front of her.

Just as she was about to eat, Edward came back. Teddy asked him enthusiastically if he had eaten, and after that, Edward sat in front of her.

In fact, Jeanne had not been able to eat much recently, but it was not because of her mood. It was because her belly was too big and it seemed to be pushing against her stomach.

Even if she ate a little, her stomach would feel uncomfortable. Hence, she only took a few bites and stopped eating.

“Finn said that the baby has grown very little recently.”

“He told me to eat less but have more meals.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

...

“But you’re eating too little,” Edward commented.

“It’s enough,” Jeanne replied.

“Have some more.” As he spoke, Edward picked up a piece of cod and placed it on Jeanne’s plate.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

“The baby needs nutrition.”

Jeanne pursed her lips. Then, she quietly picked up her utensils and started eating. She was not eating it because she thought her baby did not have enough nutrition, but because the child was his.

In the future, he would be the only one taking care of their daughter, so she needed to be responsible for him. Therefore, she would try her best to satisfy whatever he said about the child.

After lunch, Jeanne took a walk in the back garden out of habit while Edward went straight upstairs. He probably knew that she did not want him to accompany her or perhaps, he was also keeping his distance.

Slowly, the distance between them was growing further and further.

After walking a few times around the garden, Jeanne felt tired, so she returned to her room. In the corridor, she suddenly stopped in her tracks.

She saw Edward in a room that she passed by. He was assembling everything in the room alone, including painting the room with pink, pollution-free paint. She then watched him install the crib with pink netting, a children’s cushion, and various decorations…

...

Her eyes flickered.

It turned out Edward went out today and bought so many things just to build a nursery for the baby.

Actually... from the moment she learned that she would not be around to see her baby grow up, she stopped looking forward to the birth of her baby. She did not dare to look forward to the baby’s birth or fantasize about her growth and future.

However, seeing Edward’s actions at that moment, she could finally feel it. She was about to give birth to a daughter!
