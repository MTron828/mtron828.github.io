Jeanne interrupted him and said, “I’m sorry to disappoint you, Nox.”

Nox frowned.

He felt that Jeanne was very proud of herself.

“Fourth Master and I are getting married soon.”

“Wow... What?!” Nox looked at Jeanne.

At that moment, he thought he must have heard wrongly.

“You can keep those resources to yourself. From now on, you don’t have to worry about the Fourth Master’s sex life.”

Nox’s eyes were bulging.

He refused to believe it or, to be more precise, he could not accept it!

He could not accept that his Fourth Master Swan was being played by Jeanne.

Just as he was about to speak, Edward suddenly said from behind, “Nox, contact a wedding company for me.”

“...”

What kind of miraculous turn of events was that?

......

Has the author– No. Has Fourth Master Swan gone crazy?

Nox turned his head and looked at Fourth Master Swan in a daze.

By then, Jeanne had already left with George.

When they walked out, the Fourth Master Swan’s black car at the door stopped in front of her. The driver got down from the car respectfully and said to Jeanne, “Miss Lawrence, Fourth Master has told me to send you and the young master off.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

She turned around to look at the driver with a smile. “Thank you.”

“No worries, Miss Lawrence. Please hop on. “The chauffeur opened the car door for her.

With that, Jeanne and George got into the car and left Bamboo Garden.

Jeanne could not help but heave a sigh.

She, too, did not know why she was sighing. It was probably because she wanted to relax her tense heart.

Forget Nox finding it unbelievable, for even she could not accept how things had developed.

“Mom.” George, who was beside her, suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne looked over at him. “Hm?”

“Are you going to marry Fourth Master Swan?” George asked in his childlike voice.

Jeanne felt guilty. “I’m sorry. I know. I promised you I wouldn’t be with Fourth Master Swan.”

George stared at her.

Jeanne said, “I know you don’t like Fourth Master Swan, but sometimes, I don’t have a choice either. George, if you don’t like living with Fourth Master Swan, I’ll get Kingsley to bring you with him–”

“No need.” George shook his head. “I want to stay with you.”

Deep down, Jeanne was a little touched.

When she was at her worst, George’s existence would be her greatest encouragement.

She touched George’s hair and said, “Actually, Fourth Master Swan and I are in a marriage of convenience. That means we’re not married because we have feelings for each other, but because of benefits. So, one day, Fourth Master Swan and I will get a divorce.”

It seemed like Jeanne was assuring George that they would leave one day.

George opened his small mouth, but the words got stuck in his throat. Then, he turned to look out of the car window.

He did not want to tell his mother that when Fourth Master Swan carried him in the amusement park today before they entered the haunted house, he whispered in his ear, “Promise me two things. First, take care of yourself so that your mother doesn’t have to worry about you. Second, take care of your mother for me so that I don’t have to worry about her.”

Although George was very young, he understood what Fourth Master Swan said then.

He understood that Fourth Master Swan was saying his goodbye.

That was why when his mother picked him up and left the amusement park, he asked, “Where’s Fourth Master?”

What he wanted to tell his mother at that moment was that Fourth Master Swan would not stop them from leaving.

However, he did not say it in the end.

He always thought Fourth Master Swan would snatch his mother away, and that was why he would not give Fourth Master Swan a chance.

When the car arrived at the Lawrence family’s manor, Jeanne thanked the driver and then led George inside.

She thought she would never show up in this place again, but she was back.

It had been more than a week since the accident, but her sudden appearance stunned Alexander and Jenifer in the living room. Obviously, they did not expect her to come back.

Alexander’s face sank as he had been seething with anger at Jeanne’s sudden absence from work for a week.

If it were not for Fourth Master Swan giving him a call, he would not have endured it until now.

Jeanne was really becoming more and more arrogant!

She thought she could look down on others just because of her current ability.

As such, he said coldly, “You’re finally willing to come back, huh?”

Jeanne had already expected Alexander to be behaving strangely.

However, she did not want to deal with him right now.

Alexander said, “So what? Now that you’ve seduced Fourth Master Swan, you think you’re all grown up, huh? You don’t even take me seriously anymore!”

Honestly, without Fourth Master Swan, he would not take her seriously either.

If it were not for her mother, who had once stayed in the house, she would not have been so entangled with the family.
