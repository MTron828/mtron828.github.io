Chapter 504: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction!

Finn took a deep breath.

Monica was really gullible at times.

However, for some reason, a smile appeared on his face, seemingly indicating that he was in a good mood.

Monica returned to the bathroom and looked at the red dot in the mirror.

She thought to herself, ‘Damn it. What a fantastic place for an allergy.’

Then, she wiped it with her hand again.

F*ck. She was so disappointed.

She thought Finn had done something to her. How could that man be so indifferent to her?

“F*ck!” Monica cursed in the washroom for quite a while before stepping out of the washroom. When she came out, she saw an additional person in the room.

It was a woman who could instantly make her angry.

Her expression twisted as she looked at Patsy sitting beside Finn’s bed and looking at Finn lovingly.

Finn also had a faint smile on his face, and it was a warm one.

At that moment, Monica wanted to hide Finn, and she was furious.

......

The moment she appeared, both of them turned their heads to look at her at the same time.

Monica noticed their gazes and deliberately made herself appear magnanimous by climbing onto Finn’s bed and laying gently in his arms.

Patsy’s expression visibly changed.

Monica deliberately asked, “You’re here!”

Her tone was very natural.

Patsy glanced at Monica and did not answer her question. Instead, she turned her gaze to Finn affectionately. “Finn, how are you feeling?”

“I’m fine.”

“How did you get hurt so badly?”

“It was just an accident.” Finn did not explain further.

“It makes me heartbroken that you’re hurt,” Patsy said sadly.

Monica was really going to die from how corny that sounded.

F*ck. How could that woman say something so cringe so naturally?

Most importantly, it seemed like men would fall for that trick.

She saw Finn’s gentle and comforting expression. “It’s alright. I’ll be fine in a few days.”

“Okay.” Patsy nodded her head hard.

“How have you been?” Finn asked out of concern.

Monica pouted and buried her head between his neck because she did not want to see him treat another woman so gently.

Even though she said she would accept them both, she had told him not to let her see it. For that, she was angry.

However, Finn acquiesced to Monica’s intimacy.

Patsy also watched Monica’s behavior. She knew Finn did not like people getting close to him, so deep down, she was a little unhappy.

At that moment, she just stared blankly at Monica.

Monica seemed to have felt Patsy’s gaze as well. She did not know whether she had lost her mind because she was so angry, but at that moment, she suddenly stuck out her tongue and licked Finn’s neck.

Finn’s body visibly stiffened for a second before his face turned red.

Patsy did not catch what Monica was doing, but she could see the changes in Finn’s body.

“I’m not doing too well,” Patsy replied, wanting to pull Finn’s attention back to her.

However, Finn looked at her at that moment and did not say a word for a long time. It was obvious that his attention was not on her.

That was when she saw his tensed body.

After a long while, Finn said in a stern voice, “Monica.”

Monica smiled as if her evil plan had succeeded.

At that, she let go of Finn.

When she saw his blushing face, she felt a sense of accomplishment.

‘To allow you and Patsy to hook up? To allow you and that b*tch to flirt? Well, if you two want to flirt, I’ll force myself on you, and I don’t play around!’

“Be serious,” Finn whispered to Monica.

“I can’t be serious with you.” Monica looked proud.

Then, Finn’s face seemed to redden even more.

With a bright smile, Monica said, “You two have a nice chat. I’m going out to get some fresh air.”

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

By then, Monica had gotten out of bed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The moment she left with her walking stick, she said to the two people inside, “I’ll give you ten minutes, and only ten minutes!”

That was her limit.

After that, she left the ward.

She looked like she was in high spirits, but in fact, she still felt a little uneasy when she left.

There was just something in her heart that made her feel uncomfortable.

Fine. She wanted to strangle Patsy for a second, so she was afraid that if she stayed in there for another second, she would fight Patsy to death.
