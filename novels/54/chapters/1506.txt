Heart-wrenching screams echoed throughout the prison.

Wyatt looked at Claire with an ugly expression. He did not expect the family to be in such a mess because of Chloe’s matter.

He said fiercely, “Claire, Chloe is who she is now because of you. If you hadn’t doted on her since she was young, tolerated her every time she made a mistake, and stood on her side unconditionally after she made a mistake, Chloe wnllldn’t he ignorant l”

“Do you mean I’m ignorant too?” Claire argued with Wyatt. “If that’s the case, why are we still living together? Let’s get a divorce. Let’s get a divorce immediately! ”

“You think I don’t dare to do it, do you?” Wyatt asked coldly.

“Divorce, immediately!” Claire had lost all her rationality.

Candice looked at Claire acting impulsively and believed Claire was the reason Chloe had such a twisted personality. She finally saw it for herself. As a parent whose child made a mistake, instead of telling her own child off, Claire picked at other people’s mistakes.

Candice originally thought that such people were only mentioned in gossip and entertainment, but today was really an eye-opener for her.

“Candice, Dad and Mom are about to get a divorce because of you, but you’re still so indifferent to the situation. Do you even have a conscience?” Chloe suddenly pointed the finger at Candice.

Chloe’s ability to shift the blame was unparalleled.

Candice looked at Chloe coldly. “I really don’t understand. This matter is so simple and easy to understand. It’s clear who is at fault. How can you twist things to such an extent?”

“What did you say-I‘ Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Candice immediately interrupted Chloe. “First of all, whose fault is it to seduce someone else’s husband? Was it my fault because I didn’t keep a close eye on my husband?”

“I’ve already explained that I didn’t seduce him. I was just drunk-”

“Even if you were drunk, do you think it’s a matter of course for you to sleep with a married man? If you did it unintentionally, shouldn’t you be ashamed? How can you be so shameless as to think that it’s okay?” Candice sneered. Chloe was about to say something, but she was suddenly rendered speechless by Candice.

“Secondly, when you ask others for help, what makes you think others must help you and that not helping you would be treason?” Candice continued to mock Chloe. “Who do you think you are? The Queen? And everyone has to worship you unconditionally?”

“You!” Chloe’s face turned red from Candice criticizing her.

“I’ll say it one last time. Whether or not to pursue this matter is not up to me or Dad to decide. It’s Edward’s decision. If he didn’t want to pursue this matter, he wouldn’t have chosen to do it this way. Since he’s doing it this way, this is not child’s play to him, and you should understand the true meaning of this matter. Don’t assume that you can pretend it never happened because you were fooling around. You can never predict what the Leader of a country will do,” Candice said coldly and clearly.

“You haven’t even tried, so how could be so certain? You just don’t want to help me. You want me to be punished and to stabilize your position. All men have liked me since we were young, and you’re just jealous of me. You’re afraid that Edward might really like me, so you can’t wait to see me go down! Candice, do you think I don’t know about your selfish thoughts? At the end of the day, you’re doing all this to benefit yourself!”

“You really think too highly of yourself, Chloe! Who exactly do you think Edward is? Would he care about someone like you? Look in the mirror and see what it is you have to make men like you. Get to know Edward’s ex-wife, Jeanne, and compare yourself to her!” Candice sneered, and she looked at the person in front of her with a contemptuous smile. “Chloe, it’s important to know your place.. In Edward’s eyes, you’re nothing!”
