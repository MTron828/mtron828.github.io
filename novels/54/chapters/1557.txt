Chapter 1558: Monica Gets Jealous

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Especially when she looked at Finn’s side profile through the dim street lights, she suddenly felt that the curve of his side profile was perfect.

At that moment, Wendy’s eyes flickered a little when she saw his Adam’s apple again. She did not know when it started, but the man’s Adam’s apple had become a fatal attraction.

Wendy suddenly felt her mouth go dry. Finn gave people the impression that he was a man of abstinence, and when that kind of man was around, his presence would make women unconsciously fall for him.

Finn, who was looking out the window, noticed Wendy’s gaze. He immediately turned to look at her with a frown.

“Ms. Hansen, do you have anything to say?” Finn asked.

Wendy snapped back to her senses, and her face was flushed red. Fortunately, the lights were dark, so he could not tell.

She tried hard to calm herself down and said slowly, “Um… Aren’t we bringing your director to do some sightseeing tomorrow? It involves some arrangements, and because we might not be as familiar with Director Cardellini as you are, we’d like to communicate with you about the schedule in advance. Do you think that’ll be okay?”

“Sure.” Finn nodded.

Only then did Wendy return to normal and arranged the schedule for tomorrow. Finn listened attentively before pointing out a few things, which Wendy quickly noted down. She was really impressed that the secretary was so familiar with his director’s habits and hobbies.

As for herself… She had thought she was responsible enough for a secretary. However, in comparison to him, she suddenly felt that she was instantly reduced to dregs.

“Will that put you in a difficult position?” Finn asked when he saw that Wendy was silent.

“No, no.” Wendy quickly denied it. “I just admire you very much. Seeing that you didn’t interact much with your director today, I thought you weren’t particularly close to her. But now, I’ve realized why Director Cardellini, such an outstanding person, would hire you to be her secretary. As expected, outstanding people can only be matched with outstanding talents.” Finn seemed to smile.

“In that case, I’ll have to trouble you with tomorrow’s schedule.”

“As I should.” Wendy said politely, “By the way, Mr. Jones, can I have your contact number? That way, I can contact you in advance when we’re coming over to pick you guys up tomorrow.”

“Sure.” Finn gave his phone number to Wendy.

Wendy also gave Finn her phone number. “If Director Cardellini needs to change her schedule or if there’s anything we need to take note of, please let us know in advance, Mr. Jones.”

“Alright.’

The two of them chatted until the car arrived at the five-star hotel where they were staying.

The people from the other company sent them to the door, and after both sides expressed their gratitude, Monica and her group walked into the hotel.

Monica was so tired that, as soon as she returned to her hotel room, she lay on the bed and did not move. It was only then that Finn realized how much Monica’s workload was.

With that thought in mind, he went to prepare a bath for Monica and then brought her a set of clean clothes. “Monica, take a bath.”

Monica glanced at Finn and recalled that Ms. Hansen had waved at Finn when she saw them off at the hotel entrance. She pursed her lips. Without saying anything, she got up from the bed and went straight to the bathroom. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Finn seemed to have noticed that Monica was a little unhappy, but it also seemed to be an illusion. As such, he assumed that she was just a little tired, considering that she did not take a nap at noon and only managed to rest for a while.

When Monica came out of the shower, Finn placed a glass of warm milk on the bedside table.

“I just told the staff to bring it in. Warm milk can help you sleep better,” Finn explained.

Monica did not refuse. She picked up the glass of milk and drank it. By then, Finn had gone to the bathroom to take a shower.

After drinking the milk, Monica was not yet sleepy, so she took out her phone and sent a message to Jeanne. “Didn’t you miss me?”

Due to the time difference, it was only nightfall in Harken.

Jeanne was speechless. It had only been a day. What would she miss Monica? Besides, she had been seeing Monica so often.

However, to Monica, she had finally reunited with Jeanne for the first time in many years but had to go on a business trip the day after their reunion. Therefore, she was naturally reluctant to part with Jeanne.

“I miss you. How are you doing in Casterbridge?”

“It’s been pretty good..”
