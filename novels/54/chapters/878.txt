879 They Gave Up on Each Other

Reese’s expression changed again after seeing that Monica was still objecting. However, before she could roar, Michael said bluntly, “You don’t have a choice.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Monica gritted her teeth.

“I have many methods to force you to agree. You know that, don’t you?” Michael threatened her coldly.

It was true. If she did not agree, Michael might take action against her family.

Jeanne was right. Only when the enemy was completely knocked to the ground without being able to even get up could it be considered a victory. She had to win the battle, not the war.

“Alright, then.” Monica agreed.

It was only because Michael had threatened her that she agreed.

He knew very well what Monica was most afraid of. She was terrified that the people most important to her would get hurt because of her, so she would compromise infinitely. He had no doubts about that.

Seeing that Monica had agreed, Reese sneered. “Monica, since you’re marrying into the Rosses, you’d better know your place. Don’t think you’re still some rich lady! You must treat your husband’s family as the sky, and do your duty as a wife. You must take care of Michael and be filial to me!”

Monica did not reply, and Michael did not seem to want to listen anymore.

“That’s enough. I’ll tell her about our family’s rules in the future. Right now, we need to prepare for the wedding.”

Seeing that Monica was obviously more obedient, Reese felt a little more at ease and did not say anything more.

“Let’s go. I’ll take you back.” Michael said to Monica.

Monica glanced at Reese. She looked at this noble lady who was praised by the public as being virtuous, elegant, generous, with a noble temperament, and a role model wife. Right now, she was really eager to see how this ‘role model’ would be praised by the world and thrown down by them!

She left the Rosses residence with Michael. It was silent throughout the car journey back to the Cardellinis’ villa.

The moment she got out of the car, Monica was suddenly pulled back by Michael.

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

“Sit properly,” Michael said.

Then, he slowly got out of the car, walked to Monica’s side, and opened the door for her.

Monica’s mouth curved into a sneer.

He was acting so volatile around her, hot and cold. He threatened her in front of his mother, and now he was suddenly being considerate.

The moment they got out of the car, only then did Monica realize that she had overthought it.

There was no need for Michael to pretend in front of her. His affectionate actions towards her were only because he had discovered a paparazzi hiding around her villa. As long as there were paparazzi around, Michael had to show his deep love.

Monica cooperated with Michael and reluctantly said goodbye to him. Before Michael left, he lifted the back of her head and planted a kiss on her lips. Monica did not resist. Some scenes had to be played out with Michael.

They kissed for a long time. It was like two lovers who were glued together and could not bear to part.

Monica did not refuse Michael’s advances. To her, he was just a body. She would even go so far as to sell her body in order to deal with Michael. Furthermore, it was just a kiss, a deep kiss.

So she allowed Michael to kiss her. She kissed Michael so deeply that even the scarily self-disciplined Michael had a slight reaction, his eyes filled with lust.

He said in a hoarse voice, “Don’t resist me in the future.”

“Alright.” Monica agreed with a smile.

“I can love you very much.” Michael made it clear. As long as she was obedient, he could love her very much.

She agreed again with a smile.

Michael touched her red and swollen lips with his finger. “Only leave after I’ve gone.”

“Alright,” Monica agreed. She would agree to anything he said.

Michael kissed her forehead again before getting into the car and driving further and further away as Monica watched on.

All this while, she had been showing how much Michael loved her. So it was Michael’s turn to show that she loved him very much too. Watching her fiancé’s car leave for a long time was a sign of love, especially under the deliberate guidance of certain people.

Monica’s eyes flickered as she watched the hidden paparazzi leave. Then, she sarcastically turned to leave. The moment she turned around, her heart suddenly tightened. Finn was standing not far behind her.
