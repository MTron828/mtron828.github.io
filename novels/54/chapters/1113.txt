1114 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

However, what surprised Edward was that…

Logically speaking, Kingsley should have brought a lot of men to Harken, even though bringing all of them was inconvenient to travel. However, it had been a night. Why had no assassins come over to support them? Once they came, the people led by Edward would not be able to withstand a single blow.

Then, Kingsley could leave without a hitch and would not have been forced into such a state.

“We need reinforcements. The sooner, the better,” Edward instructed.

“Yes.”

Jack was extremely respectful.

He made a phone call and reported the current situation.

After a while, he returned to Edward’s side. “They’ve agreed to send more people here. They will arrive in about half an hour.”

“Tell them to be careful not to be discovered by the Sanders. Once the Sanders comes to support, we will not gain anything.”

“Yes.”

The other party respectfully dialed a number to remind the people who were coming.

Edward said, “I’ll bring Nox and a few of the men over to scout the situation. You guys cover us. After we enter, we won’t act rashly. Once the reinforcements arrive, send us a signal. Nox and I will give you instructions according to the situation.”

“Won’t it be too dangerous?” Jack was worried.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. Pay attention to the surroundings and keep an eye out for the Sanders or the other assassins of the Hills,” Edward instructed.

“Yes.”

Edward randomly picked two people and brought Nox along as they sneaked in from the side.

With that, a gunshot was purposely sounded from the other side. It was obvious that it was to distract the attention of the people inside so that Edward and Nox could enter smoothly.

The four of them carefully crept forward and approached the bamboo forest where Kingsley was hiding.

Halfway there, they hid in a deep ravine.

Edward gave Nox a look, and after so many years of tacit understanding, Nox understood at a glance.

The two of them were quick to react. In an instant, the two people who followed them were knocked to the ground. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Take off their clothes,” Edward instructed, already putting his plan into action.

Nox really held it in again and again.

He felt that Edward was courting death. However, he had no choice but to follow the arrangement and take off the clothes of the two men.

After that, Edward did not stop and left immediately.

“Edward.” Nox pulled him back.

“Don’t worry.” Edward pushed Nox away and rushed in.

Still, Nox suppressed his anger and followed Edward in without a care for his life. Anyway, if Edward wanted to die, they would die together.

The two of them arrived at the bamboo forest that Kingsley was hidden in.

There was a clearing ahead of the bamboo forest, and once exposed, they would be shot to death. They could only hide inside, behind the bamboo.

Since the other party did not know what was going on inside, they did not dare to rush in.

At that moment, when Kingsley saw Edward, his raised gun paused.

However, he did not hide the fact that his expression was extremely ugly after being forced to this point.

Edward, on the other hand, noticed that there were only three people left with Kingsley.

If the Duncans increased their manpower, Kingsley would not be able to escape!

He asked, “Are your assassins under Warren’s control?”

The fact that no backup came was obvious

Kingsley’s expression was grim.

It seemed that his guess was correct.

The Sanders was really despicable.

Warren had predicted that Edward would make a move and that Kingsley would not sit by and do nothing. Thus, he wanted them to kill each other. Once Kingsley died, all the assassins of the Hills would be his, and they would not need to go through Kingsley’s command.

After all, he was only making use of Jeanne, but Kingsley would truly give his all to Jeanne.

Once he threatened Jeanne’s life, Kingsley may turn against him at any time.

He was also worried that Kingsley would be captured by the Swans. Once that happened, not only would he suffer heavy losses, but the other party would be even stronger. How could he let such a thing happen?

He wanted to use Edward to help him get rid of Kingsley or use Kingsley to kill Edward.

Whoever died here would be of great benefit to him!

If Kingsley died, the assassins of the Hills would be his, and he could make those people kill the Duncans and the Swans for him.

With all the resources he had, he refused to believe that he could not kill those minions!

It would be better if Edward was dead. Then, the most capable general of the Duncans would be eliminated. Without him, the Duncans’ survival rate would be damaged by at least half!

As for Jeanne, if she was still alive, Jeanne’s hatred for Edward or Kingsley would double.
