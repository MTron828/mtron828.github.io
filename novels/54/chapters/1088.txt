1089 Neither of Them Needed The Other Anymore

Michael was executed the next day.

Michael’s incident had a great impact on the public. Not only was his trial broadcast live, but he had also been exposed to the media since the death of the little boy. Hence, after his execution, the warden of the prison personally announced the results of the execution to the public.

All of a sudden, everyone was overjoyed! After all, bad people deserved the punishment they deserved.

However, something unexpected happened next.

On the day of Michael’s death sentence, his mother, Reese, chose to jump off a building and died.

When Monica saw that news, she was also a little surprised. However, she quickly felt relieved.

Michael’s end was inextricably linked to everything that his primitive family had given him, so it was understandable that Reese died with him.

Monica sat on the chair and read the news about Michael coldly.

Just then, someone knocked on the door.

Monica put down her phone and responded, “Come in.”

Steve pushed the door open and entered.

Steve was not someone who liked to show his emotions, but he still looked like he was delighted after Cardellini Enterprise won the lawsuit. He said, “We have now received orders from many pharmacies and hospitals. According to the current order volume we’ve received so far, the total number of orders received in the country has exceeded 3 billion, and it’s still increasing.”

“Go through the list of all the pharmacies and hospitals that want our products. We will not provide any supplies to those who didn’t help us when we were in trouble and even hit us when we were down,” Monica said bluntly.

“...If that’s the case, we’ll lose more than half of our orders.” Although Steve was also very unhappy about being ostracized by the market, he would still treat business competition rationally.

“It doesn’t matter. Once we release the news that we won’t supply those former big agents, other pharmaceutical agents will approach us. This market has never lacked bold and visionary businessmen. It’s only a matter of time.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“The most important thing for us now is to bring Cardellini Enterprise back to a profitable state from its previous loss. If we reject the purchase request for those drugs now, we will continue to lose money.”

“I’ve promised that I would produce another billion worth of medicine to give away for free, and that will not change. We’ll take advantage of the free period and wait for the new pharmaceutical market in Harken.”

“Chairman, but you’re playing with money!” Steve’s heart ached.

That was really a waste of money.

“I just want some people to understand that although it’s important to make money, it’s important to conduct themselves with integrity too.” Monica was very determined.

Steve had no choice but to nod. “Alright.”

Although his heart ached for Cardellini Enterprise’s money, he had to admit that Monica’s vengeful personality, whether or not it was because she was impulsive and would not think of the bigger picture, was a good thing. When he thought of those people’s disgusting faces when they were in a crisis, he found it difficult to calm down if he did not teach them a lesson.

Besides, Monica was rich. She had gained her wealth so suddenly that she probably would not care about that amount of money either.

Moreover, with that amount, once Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s business returned to normal, they could quickly make a profit.

“There are a few things I need to tell you. Remember to let me know when you’re done,” Monica said. She did not know when it started, but ever since she had an aura to her, her expressions became controlled, and she no longer laughed heartlessly. Once she stopped laughing and coupled with her calm personality, she appeared very dignified.

“Yes,” Steve said respectfully.

He had also accepted all of Monica’s changes.

Monica said, “First, because of the fall of Sunny Pharmaceutical, after we’ve given away all one billion worth of drugs, according to the market estimates, Cardellini Enterprise should have a crazy amount of orders in the next month. It will be even more than what you have received now, so we must prepare enough supplies. Get the sales department to calculate the exact value and give me a specific number. If there are no problems, we will start production.”

“Yes.”

“Secondly, Cardellini Pharmaceutical has been committed to drug research and development for so many years. Now that more than half of the research and development team has left, rebuilding the research and development team is key. Otherwise, Cardellini Pharmaceutical will crash and go bankrupt again. I hope you’ll be personally in charge of this matter.”
