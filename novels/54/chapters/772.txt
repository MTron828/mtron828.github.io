Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

…

Nox drove very fast, and soon, Jasmine was sent to Lawrence Enterprise.

Jasmine only reacted after she arrived at Lawrence Enterprise and asked Nox why she was brought there.

Nox replied, “I don’t know either. Jeanne told me to bring you here. Perhaps you should ask her.”

As he said that, Nox was already calling Jeanne.

However, Jeanne did not pick up. She only replied with a message. “Tell Jasmine that if she wants to get out of her current life, she has to work with me.”

Nox showed the message to Jasmine.

Jasmine did not expect that in the end, the person who would save her would be the woman she hated the most in her life.

With that, she followed Nox out of the car, walked into the Lawrence Enterprise, and then walked through a large door.

The moment she entered, she heard her mother and Jeanne arguing in front of the reporters.

At that moment, she knew why Jeanne had called her over. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She could not help but admire Jeanne. How could Jeanne be so sure that she would work with her and betray her own mother?

Right. When she was tortured by the Swans, she did think of dying a few times. Although she had asked her mother for help, other than comforting her and telling her that it was fine in the future, her mother had never thought of taking her away from the Swans. For her own benefit, she ignored how miserable her daughter’s life was and how crazy Eden was!

Jasmine lost all hope and was truly disappointed.

That was why she chose to work with Jeanne.

In front of everyone, she enunciated each word clearly. “My mother, Jenifer, has never treated Jeanne well. She even tried to frame Jeanne!”

As soon as she said that, the room was in an uproar.

No one probably expected the plot to change again. Now, Jenifer’s biological daughter was accusing her own biological mother in front of everyone!

What a shocking turn of events!

The bribed reporters at the scene were at a loss as to what to do!

Seeing that things had gone differently from the original direction, they suddenly felt a little overwhelmed and could only wait for further instructions.

Of course, the most agitated person at the scene was none other than Jenifer, who could not believe what she just heard.

She could not believe that the daughter she had raised would one day treat her like that in front of so many people.

She rushed forward and grabbed Jasmine. “What nonsense are you saying? What kind of trauma did you go through? Tell me, Jasmine. Did Jeanne threaten you? Did she use her status as a member of the Swans to threaten you? Don’t be afraid. Speak now and I will definitely give you justice. I’m not afraid to fight anyone for you.”

However, Jasmine simply looked at Jenifer.

She had grown up being treated like a puppet by her mother and had always done whatever her mother said. Yet, when she was hurt and wanted her mother to help her, the latter refused and cruelly abandoned her.

Suddenly, she smiled and laughed coldly while pushing Jenifer away.

Jenifer was shocked.

Just as she was about to pull Jasmine away, Jeanne stopped her by grabbing her arm forcefully.

Jenifer screamed in pain.

“If you get any closer to Jasmine, I’ll break your arm,” Jeanne threatened.

After saying that, she let go of Jenifer fiercely.

Jenifer’s arm, which Jeanne grabbed, was almost numb from the pain.

Having been threatened, Jenifer did not approach Jasmine anymore.

By then, Jasmine did not look at Jenifer again. With her face pale, she said numbly, “From the moment my mother brought me and my brother into the Lawrences, my mother warned me and my brother that everything in a wealthy family must be stolen. It was she who stole Jeanne’s mother’s position that allowed us to enjoy wealth and glory in a wealthy family. Hence, my brother and I also had to snatch Jeanne’s position to truly become the young miss and young master of the Lawrences.”

“I’ve always believed in my mother’s teachings. That’s why I’ve always been against Jeanne and wanted everything she had, including her ex-fiancé, Eden. Eden and I don’t get along as well as everyone else thinks. Eden got together with me because I drugged and seduced him. Eden didn’t want to take responsibility at first, but my mom got the reporters to blow up the matter so that Eden had to take responsibility. She also made use of Jeanne’s feelings back then and knew that she wasn’t someone who wouldn’t resist when she was hurt. She made things worse and caused Jeanne to be kicked out of the family. My mom planned all of this.”
