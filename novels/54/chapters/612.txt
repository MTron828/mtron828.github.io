Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Lawrences’ hall, Jenifer suddenly crashed into the wall beside her.

Everyone, who was discussing with each other, was shocked by Jenifer’s actions.

Joshua quickly went over to hold Jenifer up. “Mom, what are you doing?”

Jenifer’s eyes were red, and she looked weak. She sobbed and said, “I never thought your father would be a person like that... I’ve been sleeping together for so many years, not knowing he could be such a bad person.”

“What does my father being a bad person have to do with you? Why are you punishing yourself by hitting yourself on the wall? No matter what, you’re a victim. We’re all victims. For so many years, I never knew my father was such a person. I-I really want to kill him with my own hands!” Joshua looked enraged.

Jeanne, who was at the side, was shocked by Jenifer’s and Joshua’s reactions.

To think they could disregard the matter of Jonathan’s death and come up with an excuse to treat themselves as victims so quickly.

Jeanne did not react to them.

On the contrary, the others could not stand it any longer and quickly went forward to console them, “Don’t say that. No one knew. If Jeanne did not expose him, no one would be able to tell that Alexander was such a person. It’s better to expose him now than to keep a ticking time bomb by your side. If you provoke him, he could be ruthless to you... Just thinking about it makes me terrified.”

“To think I’ve been so good to him all these years. I always thought he was a good man. At home, he was usually respectful and filial to his father, so I never thought he could be so vicious. I was really blind...” Jenifer cried her eyes out.

At the same time, the people around her kept comforting her.

Seemingly having thought of something, Jennifer asked her son to help her up. There were still some blood stains on her forehead, and she looked extremely weak.

With Joshua’s help, she slowly walked toward Jeanne. At that moment, she suddenly knelt in front of Jeanne.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Jenifer was really willing to do anything to achieve her goal.

“Mom, what are you doing? What are you doing?” Joshua looked very flustered as he kept pulling Jenifer up from the floor.

However, Jenifer just knelt in front of Jeanne and said regretfully, “I’m sorry to have wronged you, Jeannie. It’s my fault.”

Jenifer just wanted to let people know how good she was to Jeanne.

That way, when it came to fighting for the family assets, the weaker side would receive more sympathy.

Jenifer was indeed smart to have been able to think about the family asset so quickly.

Upon careful consideration of Jonathan’s passing, his inheritance would naturally fall into Alexander’s hands. However, now that Alexander was out of the picture, the Lawrences’ assets would naturally fall into the hands of others. In Jenifer’s heart, Jeanne was also part of the Lawrences, so it was inevitable that she would receive the Lawrences’ inheritance. In fact, Jeanne would not be able to get too much of it. However, she was afraid that Jeanne would snatch it all from them. After all, everyone knew how capable Jeanne was. When the time came, she would incite the shareholders and force them to hand the company over to her. Then, all her years of hard work would be wasted!

Therefore, the best way at that moment was to make it seem like she had a good relationship with Jeanne. If Jeanne really wanted to take all the assets, she would accuse Jeanne of turning her back on her family.

Jeanne could see through all of Jenifer’s schemes, so she chose to continue the act with Jenifer.

She squatted down and said, “Mother, you didn’t know what kind of person father was, so of course, I won’t blame you. You don’t have to kneel for me. Are you trying to make everyone think that I, Jeanne, am a person who doesn’t know right from wrong? Are you deliberately trying to embarrass me?”

“I-I didn’t mean that. I just feel guilty and ashamed because I scolded you just now. I hope you can forgive me...” Jenifer hurriedly explained. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She was also filled with a mix of emotions.

At that moment, she was trying to make Jeanne look bad. She wanted people to see Jeanne’s domineering side and that Jeanne could be aggressive to the Lawrences. Hence, if Jeanne wanted to snatch the inheritance from them, Jenifer would be able to better accuse her of being cold-blooded and heartless.

However, it was obvious that the current Jeanne was not someone she could easily plot against.

With Jeanne’s one sentence, she was immediately embarrassed.

Jeanne personally helped Jenifer up. “Mother, please don’t say that. We’re a family, so of course, I’ll forgive you. You’ve worked hard in the Lawrences all these years. Now that the Lawrences have ended up like this, with grandfather’s passing and father’s crime, we have to unite as a family and support each other again.”
