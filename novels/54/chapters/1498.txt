Chapter 1499: Chloe’s End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, what was going on now?

They went downstairs together and teased Paige in a friendly manner. From their faces, there was no sign that she had ruined their relationship.

To think that when she was teasing Paige this morning, she had deliberately told Paige that Edward and Candice were going to give her little sister for her to, in turn, provoke Candice. How could Candice be so indifferent to it?!

That woman was really willing to lose her dignity for status and power, and Candice was definitely not like that in the past. What exactly went wrong? Was Candice still the same woman?

“I have to go to work now, so you have to listen to Mommy at home, okay?” Edward did not answer Paige and directly changed the topic.

Children’s attention was usually easy to divert, so Paige quickly replied, “Okay.”

“You can’t eat ice cream whenever you want anymore? You have a weak stomach. If you eat too much, you’ll get a stomach ache. Look at how in pain you were yesterday. We also felt very bad when we saw you suffering.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes.” Like a little girl who had done something wrong, Paige lowered her head and accepted the criticism.

“I’m leaving now. Give me a kiss.” After being a little serious, Edward immediately became gentle.

It was true. He was very good to Paige. In fact, he doted on her a little too much.

Candice stood at the side and watched their interaction. She thought to herself that it was pretty amazing that Paige’s personality did not go astray under Edward’s unprincipled doting.

Paige quickly planted a big kiss on Edward’s face, and Edward tapped on

Paige’s little nose,

Just as he wanted to put Paige down and leave, Paige’s young voice suddenly said, “Mommy wants to kiss Daddy too.”

‘Why?” Candice pulled Paige over from Edward. “We can’t make Daddy late to work. Daddy’s very busy.”

“Brother says that people who like each other kiss each other.” Paige said very seriously, “I like Daddy. Don’t you like Daddy, Mommy?”

Candice did not answer Paige, nor did she dwell on that matter. Anyway, kissing Edward was not a big deal, and she did not want to waste too much of Edward’s time because of her.

Since she was sure of her position in the family, she had to do her part. With that, she leaned over and planted a kiss on Edward’s cheek.

Then, Edward smiled and said, “I’m leaving.”

“Bye, Daddy.” Paige waved obediently.

“Bye.” Edward looked at Paige and then at Candice, who smiled at him.

Seeing her smile, Edward’s throat moved slightly.

He was actually afraid that she would do that because the more she behaved that way, the less she cared. He would rather she lose her temper at him. However, he was also afraid that after her temper subsided, she would turn around and leave.

Edward held back his emotions and turned to leave.

“Edward.” Chloe, who was standing at the side, quickly called out to him and followed him out of the hall.

Candice watched Chloe’s actions coldly. If she said he did not mind… she would be lying. However, because they had made their relationship clear now, she suddenly had a feeling that she was fine if anything happened between Edward and Chloe and she would not interfere.

Outside the hall, Chloe called out to Edward and asked with concern, “Edward, how are things between you and my sister?”

Edward was about to get into the car when he turned around and glanced at Chloe.

“How many days do you have left here?” Edward asked.

“My parents are coming back the day after tomorrow,” Chloe quickly replied.

That seemed to be the first time in a long time that Edward had taken the initiative to ask her about something. For a second, she was really flattered.

“I see.” Edward only responded.

“I’m really grateful that you took me in. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to take care of myself, and it would’ve affected my parents’ travel plans,” Chloe said sincerely, and her smile was cute.

“It’s nothing.” Edward nodded. With that, he planned to get into the car.

“Edward.” Chloe grabbed his arm fiercely.

Edward’s eyes flickered, but at that moment, he did not push her away.

“I didn’t affect your relationship with my sister, did I?” Chloe asked. She had a guilty look in her eyes, which would make men take pity on her.

No man could reject her like that.

Previously, she had never had the chance to show herself in front of Edward. Since she would be leaving the day after tomorrow, she had to seize the opportunity..
