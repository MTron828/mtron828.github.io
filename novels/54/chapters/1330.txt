1331 Chloe Slapped in the Face

Everyone beside Edward instantly returned to their cars and drove away.

Candice stood at the door for a long time.

Was that reluctance? Was she starting to feel reluctant to part with him?

Perhaps even she herself did not notice the smile on her face.

“You’re very smug, aren’t you?” An abrupt female voice suddenly sounded beside her ear.

This voice had ruined her mood and her expressions changed.

She turned around and looked at Chloe coldly.

When Chloe saw Candice’s sudden gaze, she was shocked for a second.

It was one that made another shudder.

Impossible!

Candice had never looked like this before.

She must have been mistaken. She looked at Candice who did not even pay her another glance. Candice ignored her and walked past her.

“Candice!” How could Chloe accept Candice’s disregard for her?

Ever since she was young, Candice had always come back to please her but now, she was actually so arrogant.

Without thinking, she stepped forward to grab Candice. She even used her long nails to scratch Candice’s arm, and wanted to leave scratches all over her body.

In any case, if she pursued the matter, she could say that she was careless.

She was the best at acting cute and no one could reject her pitiful look.

However, just as she reached out and before she could react, Candice suddenly grabbed her hand. The force was so strong that she cried in pain. Just as she was about to scream, Candice’s other hand quickly grabbed Chloe’s neck.

Chloe’s face turned pale. She looked straight at Candice. She really did not know that Candice was so skilled.

It was not just her skills, but the vicious aura emanating from her entire body that made Chloe extremely terrified.

“You! Let me go, let me go…” Chloe twisted her body.

Under Candice’s shackles, she could not move at all.

“Chloe, I’m not bickering with you because I’m afraid of you, but because I don’t want to disrupt the peace in the family!” Candice threatened coldly. “Don’t challenge my limits. You can’t afford to provoke me!”

As soon as she finished speaking, Candice pushed Chloe away.

Chloe lost her balance and fell to the ground. Tears were streaming down her face. She was so shocked by Candice’s aura that she was stunned speechless.

Candice did not even look at Chloe. She could not care less about Chloe and left directly!

Chloe looked at Candice’s back and almost wanted to kill her. There was no way she was going to put up with this.

She could not let Candice show off like this anymore.

She must make Candice die a horrible death!

…

Candice returned to her room. She sat on the edge of her bed and stared at her own hands in a daze.

Was that purely based on instinct? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Her instinct made her do what she just did.

Did she really grow up in the army with her father, which was why she was so skilled?!

She was really starting to doubt her past!

…

The next morning, Monica opened her eyes and wanted to get out of bed.

She was drunk again last night. She felt light-headed.

She watched as the person beside her got out of bed. It was always the same time every day. Sometimes, Finn’s lifestyle was so self-disciplined that it was scary.

She was no different though, she was also very disciplined now.

Even if she wanted to die in bed now, she would still get up and go to work. Though she could afford to be a little late.

Hence, Monica turned over and continued sleeping until the alarm clock rang.

Monica finally got up on her own. She guessed that Finn might have already left at this hour.

She washed up slowly, changed her clothes, and put on makeup.

The moment he opened the door, he received a call from Brandon.

“Brandon.” She answered the call as she walked to the living room.

Surprisingly. Finn was watching TV in the living room and had not left.

It was past his time to go to work.

“Were you too drunk last night?” Brandon’s voice came from the other end.

Obviously, she was too distracted to hear what he said earlier, so she only caught Brandon’s question.

Monica came back to her senses. “It was alright. What did you say just now?”

“I said, sign the contract at 11 am. I didn’t drink for nothing last night. I received a call from the other party’s company early this morning. They said that they would come to our office to sign the contract with you at 11 am,” Brandon repeated impatiently.
