Chapter 452: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide

“I’ll pay!” Henry gritted his teeth.

It was just 270 million dollars!

He gritted his teeth and took out his wallet from his pocket.

“Director Henry, please hear me out first.” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed unhappily.

At that moment, Henry did not say anything else.

Jeanne said unhurriedly, “First of all, Eden caused Swan Enterprise to lose 270 million dollars. For that, he will have to pay the compensation according to the current market’s interest rate.”

Henry gritted his teeth. Although he was dissatisfied with the result, he could only endure it.

“Secondly, Eden will also have to compensate for the losses he caused Lawrence Enterprise.”

Henry glared at Jeanne.

At that moment, the rims of Eden’s eyes were red.

“Lawrence Enterprise only suffered a heavy loss this time because of Eden’s intentional actions. So, I will give Eden the specific amount according to the losses, and Eden will compensate accordingly. At the same time, Eden needs to solve the in-store bulk-buying campaign in Minze District. I don’t care what method you use, but the campaign must end today!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

Eden was at his limit.

After all he did, he was just asking for trouble. He had dug a hole for himself and suffered a huge loss!

......

“Do you have any objections?” Jeanne asked Eden.

Eden’s face was cold. Although he did not speak, he had no choice but to nod his head.

“What I said just now are all losses that Eden should make up for.” Jeanne made herself clear. “Making up for mistakes is only one aspect. The important thing is to pay the price so that you can really learn a lesson! You have to give an explanation to all the employees of the Swan Enterprise.”

“What do you want?” Henry asked Jeanne fiercely.

“Director Henry, please watch what you say. This isn’t what I want. I’m just thinking of a way to save your son!”

Henry was made speechless.

Naturally, Jeanne did not care about Henry anyway.

She looked at Eden and said clearly, “Remove him.”

Eden looked at Jeanne fiercely, while Henry also tried his best to suppress his anger.

“Remove Eden from his position as the president of the Swanhaven Bank,” Jeanne said righteously. “As a leader, he should be responsible for his actions!”

Eden’s reddened eyes stared straight at Jeanne.

He really wished he could drag that woman down with him right there and then. It was far better than being trampled on by her now. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He really wanted to kill Jeanne, and one day, he would definitely kill her.

“What do you think, President?” Jeanne did not ask for Eden’s opinion at all. Instead, she turned around and asked Edward.

“Very good,” Edward affirmed.

“What about the others?” Jeanne asked.

The other senior executives naturally did not dare to express their views.

“Director Henry?” Jeanne asked again.

Henry gritted his teeth.

Although he could not accept it, he had to. He said, “I accept it.”

“So... What about Director Eden?”

Eden clenched his fists. “I accept the company’s punishment for me!”

Jeanne nodded. “Since everyone has unanimously approved it, general manager of the general affairs department, please make an announcement to the entire company today of the removal of President Eden from Swanhaven.”

“Yes.” A staff member, who was sitting in for the meeting, immediately agreed respectfully.

“I’m done with my side of things.” Jeanne looked at Edward.

Edward nodded and said, “The meeting is adjourned.”

After that, under everyone’s watchful eyes, he held Jeanne’s hand and walked out of the senior management meeting room.

Once they left, the others also left one after another.

In the end, only Henry, Elaine, and Eden were left.

As for Richard, compared to Henry and Elaine, he was slightly more easygoing. He was ranked in the middle anyway, so no matter who managed Swan Enterprise, it would never be his turn, so he did not have such big ambitions. Hence, he did not form an alliance with Henry and Elaine.

Now, only three people were left in the meeting room.

Henry was so angry that he kicked the chair in the meeting room.

“Enough. Being angry is useless! Fortunately, Jeanne still knows her limits and didn’t send Eden to jail.” Elaine comforted him.

“It was enough for Edward to show off his power in front of us, and now, Jeanne too!” Henry said fiercely, “As the eldest son of the Swans, I’ve had enough of it!”

“What else can we do? Edward has Swan Enterprise deep in his grasp, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Moreover, we’ve known how good father treats Edward for a long time now. You have to put up with it!”

“I can deal with Edward, but for me to endure Jeanne as well? It’s impossible!” Henry was enraged.

“That’s true.” Elaine’s expression was also a little ugly. “For putting me on the spot and humiliating me today, I have to teach that little girl a lesson. Otherwise, she will think that the Swans are easy to bully! However, if Eden had married Jeanne and not Jasmine back then, he wouldn’t have gone to the extent of...”
