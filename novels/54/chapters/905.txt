906 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

As Sarah spoke, to prove that she and Finn were indeed a couple, she even hugged Finn’s arm and took the initiative to kiss him.

Finn’s eyes flickered, but he did not refuse.

Monica just stared at them…

Could the little bit of hope that had just been ignited be destroyed in an instant?

The guard stared intently at them. However, Finn did not look at him. He only turned to look at Sarah and said in a serious tone, “Sarah, thank you for accompanying me all this time. Thank you for being so magnanimous as to let me witness Monica’s wedding. I finally know that I don’t like Monica as much as I thought I did. It was probably a knot in my heart, one that was very difficult to untie. Only when I faced this knot head-on did I realize that it was actually very easy to untie. From now on, I’ll let go of Monica and be with you.” The sudden and affectionate confession confirmed their relationship.

Monica was not far away, listening to every word Finn said. It was rare for Finn to confess in front of so many people.

She should celebrate. Celebrate the fact they had turned Finn into another man and then personally hand him over to another woman.

Her eyes were a little red, and her cheeks rosy. Fortunately, she did not get too excited and blurted out all the words she had hidden in her heart. If she had said it out loud, she would lose face, would she not?

Now, she could at least put on a pretense. Even if she regretted it, she did not love Finn so much that she would do such a stupid thing. In the eyes of outsiders, she should still love Michael more, as it was because of love she would do so many things. That was the name of the game…

She tried to silence her thoughts and forced herself to smile. It had indeed just been wishful thinking.

If Finn really still had feelings for her, he would have come to take her away from the wedding ceremony when she had torn Michael apart! When he saw how much of a scumbag Michael was, he could not have helped but come to save her. However, she had not even seen Finn once throughout the wedding. Perhaps when he realized that he no longer had feelings for her and saw how bad Michael was, he was secretly happy. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She stayed silent as a tear fell onto the back of her hand. In that instant, she concealed it. She did not want to seem as though she was having much of an emotional reaction.

At the scene, due to the first man’s resistance and Finn’s incident, the entire banquet hall was in an uproar.

“Who are you to not believe him? Everyone in the country knows about what happened between Finn and Monica. Now, you’re accusing Finn of groundless crimes. What makes you think you can do whatever you want?”

“You can search us, but at least take us all to the police station and let the whole country know that we are guilty. Then, I will accept your investigation!”

“If you don’t give us a reasonable explanation, even if I die here today, shot dead by that so-called spy, I won’t let you touch a single part of my body!”

There were more and more sounds of resistance as more and more people started to get agitated. The scene became chaotic.

Everyone was protesting against their human rights being violated when a figure from the Sanders, who had not shown their faces since the start, suddenly appeared on the banquet stage.

It was not the leader. Instead, the young master of the Sanders, Chester. He was the most popular candidate to be the Sanders’ next heir, and his appearance represented the leader himself to a large extent.

As soon as he opened his mouth, the entire place fell silent. Everyone’s attention was on him. He said, “I’m very sorry for the inconvenience caused. It was not my intention to use this method to embarrass everyone! As a member of the Sanders, I would like to express my deepest apologies for the suffering caused to everyone today!” He bowed deeply to everyone present.

He had to use the Sanders’ sincerity to move everyone at the banquet, as they could not completely offend these people. Since they had already done so much, they could not give up halfway. They could only use this method to let everyone understand the Sanders’ forced actions.
