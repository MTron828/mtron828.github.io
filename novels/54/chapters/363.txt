Chapter 364: The Accident Is Just the Start

The next day, Edward picked Jeanne up from the bed. Then, they went out to sea on a speedboat.

On the deck, the sea breeze blew.

The sun in Balti Islands was very nice. In the morning, it was warm but not too sunny. The sky was blue, the sea was choppy, and the sun sparkled on the sea’s surface.

Jeanne lay on the sofa on the deck and looked at everything in front of her lazily.

At that moment, Edward was driving the speedboat. He stood not far away from her with his back facing her.

He was wearing a white t-shirt and a pair of black swim pants. On his feet was a pair of flip-flops. He did not pay much attention to his hair, so his soft short hair looked a little messy with the sea breeze blowing.

That was the first time Jeanne saw Edward dressed like that. It was so casual that nobody would think he was the legendary Fourth Master Swan. Even his pajamas at home were made of high-end silk that looked extremely luxurious.

Suddenly, she took out her phone and took a few pictures of Edward’s back, prompting Edward to turn his head around.

That was because Jeanne forgot to mute the volume.

The moment he turned his head around, Jeanne felt that the sky and the sea became dull. The man was so good-looking that it could make all things in the world lose their color.

She looked away, not wanting to sink further into the trap.

“What are you taking pictures of?” Edward asked her.

“I’m not taking pictures of anything,” she said as she looked at the picture of his back on the screen.

......

Edward chuckled before turning his head back and continuing to drive the speedboat.

Jeanne did not know why she took a photo of his back. However, after a few glances, she put her phone down and continued sleeping.

It was not that she was low in energy... It was just that a certain person’s stamina last night was too good.

Upon recalling the scene from last night, a trace of redness appeared on her face.

As some scenes that were too intimate kept flashing in her mind, she wondered how they could be so intimate with each other.

“Ah!” Jeanne was suddenly startled because at that moment, Edward suddenly sat next to her, and his handsome face was enlarged in front of her eyes.

Jeanne was shocked.

If Kingsley knew someone could get so close to her before she realized, Kinglsey would beat her to death again.

She put her hands on Edward’s chest to keep a distance between them. “What are you doing?”

Edward whispered in Jeanne’s ear.

The next second, Jeanne’s face turned red.

What a stud!

How could he say such... explicit words in such a serious manner?

“Won’t you be annoyed?” Jeanne accused.

They were at it all night last night, and now, he still wanted it so early in the morning?

Were all men machines?

“Not with you.” Edward leaned close to her cheek.

As soon as he finished speaking, Jeanne felt his lips on hers, kissing her deeply.

While the sun shone brightly, the breeze blew lightly, the sea sparkled, and the waves crashed, Jeanne panted heavily as she lay in Edward’s embrace.

They had just gone all out last night, so how did they go at it again today?

Moreover, the man in front of her was definitely not sloppy in doing such a thing. Every time, he would do it fast, not giving her any chance to resist.

At that moment, she was so tired that she did not even want to move. She just lay in his embrace and listened to the sound of his powerful heartbeat.

“Let me apply sunscreen for you,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne did not agree, but Edward had already lied her down on the sofa.

Then…

“Edward!” Jeanne tugged at her clothes, which she did not even take off just now.

“No one else is around.”

“I’m not used to it.”

“You have to get used to it.”

“I will not get used to it.”

“You will.” The corner of his mouth lifted into a faint smile, and he looked very good with it. His tone was also filled with affection.

Jeanne looked at him resentfully.

As he wished, Edward applied sunscreen on her meticulously with his slender fingers.

“I always forget to ask you,” Edward suddenly said.

Jeanne’s face was buried on the sofa, but her small ears were visibly red.

“What does the tattoo here mean?” Edward’s slender fingers pointed at her back, at the position of her spine.

There was a string of Sanskrit characters there. On her slender and fair back, it was unusually eye-catching and sexy.

“I once almost died, so I got myself a tattoo with Sanskrit words. It means ‘to be protected’,” Jeanne replied.

Edward remained silent for a few seconds before he asked, “Does the tattoo hurt?”

Jeanne suddenly smiled and turned to look at Edward.
