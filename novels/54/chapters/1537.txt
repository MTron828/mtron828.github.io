Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Alright, I’ll wait for you outside. The bath towel is by the side. I’ll put Paige’s pajamas on the bed, and you can take Paige to the bedroom to get dressed later. The bathroom is not convenient.”

“Alright,” Monica replied.

“The bathroom floor is slippery with water. Be careful not to fall.”

“Yes.”

“Slippers are non-slip. You mustn’t walk barefoot on the bathroom floor.”

“Yes.”

“I’ve set the temperature at 39 degrees. If it’s a little cold, you can adjust it. The button to adjust the temperature is here…”

“Finn, I know,” Monica interrupted him.

She was no longer the unruly young lady who knew nothing.

“Alright.”

Without saying anything else, Finn walked out of the bathroom and closed the door for them.

Monica looked in the direction of the door and felt that the current Finn…

indulged her a lot. However, she bit her lip lightly. She just did not want to…

accept it or think too much about it.

She turned to face Paige and bent down to help Paige take off her dress. Then, she bathed Paige.

It seemed like young children really loved a bath. Paige was in the bath for a long time and did not want to leave.

Toward the end, Finn started to urge her, “Paige, are you still not done?” “I’d like to stay for a while longer.”

“No, it’s not good for your body to take a long bath. Moreover, the air circulation in the bathroom is not great. If you’re done, come out.”

“Oh.” Although Paige was reluctant to leave the bathtub, she agreed obediently.

With that, Monica turned off the warm water.

“You can have another bath tomorrow.” Monica comforted Paige when she saw how unhappy the little girl was.

“Yes.” Paige nodded obediently.

Monica did not want to admit it, but she had to admit that she really liked Paige. Even though she would be betraying her relationship with Jeanne by liking Paige, she could not control herself.

How could there be such a lovable little girl in this world?

Monica wrapped Paige in a towel and walked out of the bathroom. Finn was not in the room, so he should be waiting outside.

Monica picked up the pajamas on the bed and helped Paige put them on. Then, she grabbed another clean towel and draped it over Paige’s shoulder to prevent her wet hair from soaking her clothes.

After that, she took out the hairdryer from the bathroom and was about to dry Paige’s hair when the door was pushed open.

Finn walked in from outside and said, “I’ll do it.”

Monica did not refuse his offer. In fact, she was a little tired from bathing Paige for so long. Taking care of a child was not an easy task because they were full of energy. Paige was playing non-stop in the bath.

With that, Monica handed the hairdryer to Finn and walked to the side.

“Your clothes are all wet,” Finn suddenly said.

Only then did Monica realize that her loose dress was wet and clinging to her body. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Go take a shower. Don’t catch a cold,” Finn suggested.

She felt fine before Finn said it, but now, she really did feel a little cold. However, she still refused.

“No need.”

“A pregnant woman’s symptoms will be many times worse than ordinary people’s. Moreover, once you catch a cold, the virus can easily invade your body. Although nobody knows how much it’ll affect the baby, there are indeed pregnant women who catch a cold during pregnancy and give birth to a baby-” “Stop.” Monica could not bear to listen to it.

The more she listened, the more flustered she became. Hence, she said, “I’ll take a shower.”

The corners of Finn’s mouth curled into a smile, but it seemed to be an illusion.

That’s right. It was a good disguise.

“I’ll help you look around and see if you still have any clothes here.”

“Thank you.”

Finn put down the hairdryer and told Paige to wait for him. As she was told, Paige sat on the edge of the bed and waited obediently.

After a while, Finn returned to his room with a loose white T-shirt and a pair of boxers in his hands.

“I looked around but couldn’t find any of your clothes,” Finn explained.

Monica also knew that she had packed everything before she left and broke up with him.

“Can you make do with this? I’ll dry your clothes later for you,” Finn said.

Monica did not refuse the clothes from Finn’s hands. She had never been a person who cared about trivial matters.

When Monica walked into the bathroom, Finn’s smile was obvious..
