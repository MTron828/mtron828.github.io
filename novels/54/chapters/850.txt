851 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

…

In a luxurious European manor in the Delta Islands, Jeanne was finally back. There seemed to have been some changes since she left this place half a year ago. At the very least, there were new faces.

When she returned to her room, she found everything as she left it. Kingsley had not seen her once in the two days since he had come back. Jeanne felt like she had dragged him down and did not know how to face him.

It was sunny at the time Jeanne left her room. While she had many wounds on her body, they were nothing compared to Edward’s. She did not even know if Edward was still alive. Though she dare not ask. She had not even contacted George yet since she had not decided on a way to tell him that she was leaving.

As she walked along the corridor, she saw an unfamiliar woman. When the woman saw her leaving, she was quick to greet her respectfully, “Eldest Young Lady Lawrence.”

“Who are you?”

“My name’s Melinda, a new assassin of the Hills. I’m now in charge of Mr. Hill’s daily life,” the woman quickly introduced herself.

Was she really in charge of his daily life, or were they just sleeping together?

Jeanne nodded slightly and asked, “Is Kingsley in his room?”

“He is.”

“I’ll go find him, then.”

“Eldest Young Lady,” Melinda called after her suddenly.

Jeanne turned around.

“Mr. Hill isn’t feeling well and has only just fallen asleep. Try not to wake him up.”

Jeanne sneered, ignoring Melinda. For some reason, she did not like this woman at all. Maybe it was because she still was holding on to Lucy. She knew that she would not be able to forget her for a long time.

Jeanne walked into Kingsley’s room and pushed the door open.

She thought that she might see a naked man lying on the bed, but all she saw was Kingsley’s pale sleeping face.

As she walked to his bed to have a look at him, She noticed how unusually pale his face was, even his lips. There was a thick bandage on his abdomen that had been stained by some blood. It seems he had probably just finished re-bandaging and had fallen asleep.

Her appearance instantly woke him up. Though all he did was glance at her and said nothing.

Jeanne went closer. “When did you get injured?”

Kingsley did not answer.

“In South Hampshire?”

“No,” Kingsley said. He was clearly very weak, but he was still full of energy.

“Or…” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Was it the Sanders?”

Kingsley did nothing to deny it, which made Jeanne’s expression change.

“There’s nothing to be angry about,” Kingsley said bluntly. “We have a mutually beneficial relationship with the Sanders. Since the project was unsuccessful, we should show a little sincerity.”

“So your idea of sincerity was to hurt your body?” Jeanne suppressed her anger.

“You feel bad?”

“No. I just don’t think it’s worth it.” Jeanne denied.

“Do you think the Sanders would believe me if I hadn’t done this? They would’ve believed that we let Fourth Master Swan go on purpose. For now, we still need to rely on the Sanders, ” Kingsley said.

Jeanne was speechless.

“Don’t worry. I’m not dying. I’ll be fine after a few days of rest.” Kingsley appeared very calm. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jeanne’s eyes turned reddened.

Kingsley smiled when he saw this. “I thought you only had eyes for Fourth Master Swan.”

“Don’t tell me that you’re still jealous?” Jeanne was speechless.

“Who told me to only care about one person in my life, right?” Kingsley laughed.

Jeanne was truly touched by this old man. Sometimes, she wondered if Kingsley was deliberately letting her use her skills. He wanted her to be loyal and work for him without any regrets.

If Kingsley wanted to do this, she would not hold him back. However, she would not dare admit that Kingsley was good to her, as she was afraid the burden would be too heavy.

“Go on out. I’d like to get some sleep.” Kingsley requested.

He closed his eyes.

“Is Melina your new pet?” Jeanne could not help but ask.

Kingsley did not answer. After all, he did not view it that way. To him, it was just to satisfy a man’s needs.

“She’s nothing compared to Lucy,” Jeanne emphasized.

Even if no one noticed it, Kingsley was obviously stunned for a second.

He said, “Not that you’d understand, but men pursue novelty. Now get out.”

“If I were Lucy, I would never let you go, even as a ghost.” With that, Jeanne turned to leave.

“Jeanne.” Kingsley suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne swiveled around to look at him.

“Lucy…” Kingsley suddenly mentioned.

Jeanne frowned at him.

“Isn’t dead,” Kingsley said.

Jeanne’s eyes widened.

What was Kingsley saying?

“I didn’t think I should tell you, but I was afraid you’d go off on a tangent. Get Melinda to bring you to her. ”

“She’s here?” Jeanne said expressively.

She did not hide her excitement at this knowledge. She really thought that Lucy had been shot dead by Edward. She did not expect Edward would show her any mercy under such circumstances.

She ran out of Kingsley’s room to find Melinda. As she escorted Jeanne to see Lucy, Jeanne noticed that the place they were where the Hills was imprisoned. It was clearly somewhere for punishment when the killer had made a mistake.

Her expression changed slightly.

Melinda pushed open an iron door. Lucy laid on the ground, covered in wounds. For a moment, Jeanne thought that Kingsley had asked her to meet Lucy’s corpse.
