Chapter 221: Monica, You Really Don’t Treat Me as a Man, Do You?!

Monica thought, ‘I’ll just anyhow wash it.

‘Why do you have so many demands?!’

“You stepped on it,” Finn enunciated each word clearly.

“I washed my feet. When I took a shower just now, I washed my body clean from head to toe!”

“Did you disinfect yourself?”

“Finn, am I sick? Am I seriously sick? Why do I need to disinfect myself after taking a shower?”

“Do you know how many bacteria are under your feet? Do you know that those bacteria—”

“F*ck, Finn!” Monica was furious.

She was so angry that she was about to explode.

Therefore, she lost her mind at this moment. She threw the foam-filled underwear directly at Finn’s face.

“Pow!”

It landed squarely on Finn’s face and stayed there.

Monica was stunned.

She did not expect herself to... throw the underwear out just like that.

After she threw it out, she saw the underwear slowly sliding down from Finn’s face.

It slid down and landed on the ground.

Finn’s face was covered in water and foam.

He looked... strangely funny.

Monica was furious at first.

At this moment, she burst into laughter when she saw Finn’s disheveled appearance.

She had never seen Finn like this before.

Regardless of whether Finn was outside or at home, he was always well-dressed and meticulous.

Monica had a smug look on her face. “Wash it yourself.”

‘I won’t keep you company anymore.

Monica was barefoot and planned to leave unfettered.

Who would want to be tortured by Finn all day?!

Monica had only taken two steps when she slipped.

“Bam!”

Monica fell on all fours.

She lay on the ground in a sorry state. For a second, she felt like she was going to die as her vision went black.

The next second, she saw Finn looking down at her from above, coldly watching the “karma” she had suffered!

Monica was infuriated.

She was about to fall to her death, yet Finn was still so indifferent.

Monica wanted to kill the scum.

At this moment, she did not seem to feel the pain in her body. She got up from the ground and lay her hands on Finn’s body.

She used all her strength to push Finn.

The ground was slippery because of the foam.

Monica had also stepped on the foam and fell embarrassedly just now.

At this moment, Finn also lost her balance under Monica’s sudden attack. It was also because of the foam on the floor.

He lost her balance and was going to fall back.

However, at this moment, he quickly grabbed onto Monica.

Monica was not stable at all.

The moment Finn grabbed onto her, she pounced on him.

Then, there was an unusually loud sound in the room.

The two of them fell to the ground together.

Monica was prepared to die from the pain, but unexpectedly, it felt much softer than the previous fall.

She seemed to be lying on someone’s body.

Her body was pressed against the person’s body.

Finn fell hard.

For a second, he felt that he had suffered a concussion from the fall.

While he was in a daze, he suddenly felt a body moving on his body. He also felt Monica’s slender and cold fingers strangling his neck, “Finn, do you think I’m nothing just because I’m not doing anything?”

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

The moment Monica retaliated against him, he suddenly pressed her against the ground instead.

Monica only felt a wave of dizziness.

Before she could react, she heard Finn whisper in her ear along with his warm breath, “You really don’t treat me like a man, do you?!”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
