Chapter 181: Took Jeanne Away With Dominance

Therefore, Melody thought about why she should be threatened by Edward.

She sneered. “Edward, do you know the consequences of you being so reckless over a woman?”

“Consequences? That’s something you have to consider, Ms. Sanders,” Edward said.

He hugged Jeanne and was about to leave.

“Stop!” Melody shouted, “Where are you taking her?! Do you know what situation she’s in now? If you dare to bring her out of this door, I’ll have people arrest you for ignoring the laws and regulations of Harken!”

Edward gave Melody a cold glance.

He said in a low voice, “Nox.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yes.” Nox quickly went forward.

After standing on the side for so long and watching this long drama, it was finally his turn to go on stage.

“Bring the bail pending trial document for bail to Ms. Sanders and let her read it word by word!” Edward said coldly.

Melody did not believe it.

She did not believe that Edward could have gotten a bail pending trial for Jeanne under her authority.

Melody took the document from Nox’s hands.

She looked at the words and was very agitated. “It’s fake! It must be forged by you!”

Edward sneered. “Whether it’s fake or not, you can verify it yourself.”

After saying that, he left.

Nox hurriedly followed behind him.

Melody watched them leave smoothly. At this moment, she was so angry that she wanted to kill them.

How was it possible?!

How could Edward be qualified to let Jeanne be released on bail pending trial?

Melody did not believe it.

She gritted her teeth and quickly picked up her phone to make a call.

The call was quickly put through. “Did you handle that bail pending trial?!”

“Ms. Sanders, I was the one who handled it, but I was also forced into a corner. Fourth Master Swan took all the laws and regulations of Harken. There was no way for me to reject him. He even used the Swan Enterprise’s real estate as collateral for Jeanne’s bail. You have to know that their real estate’s total market value is over a hundred billion dollars. I have no reason to reject him. If I reject him, once the truth is exposed, it’ll become the inspection bureau’s problem. In that case, I’d be abusing the private law while you and the chief won’t be able to explain it to the people!”

Melody’s hand was trembling as she held her phone.

Edward actually used the Swan Enterprise’s real estate as collateral for Jeanne!

Melody would be lying to herself if she still thought that Edward only used Jeanne as a shield and did not like her!

She gritted her teeth.

It was good that she knew.

It was good that she confirmed it.

This way, she would not hold back from killing Jeanne.

Even if she could not get Edward, she would make him regret it for the rest of his life!

…

Jeanne sat in Fourth Master Swan’s expensive car.

The car was very quiet.

Jeanne actually thought for a second that Fourth Master Swan had used a fake bail release document to trick Melody. Logically speaking, Melody had done so much, so she must have handled all the steps. Most people would not dare to disobey her orders... Of course, after thinking about it carefully, Jeanne knew Fourth Master Swan would not do anything illegal. She was only curious about what he had done to bail her out.

“Ms. Lawrence, you really can’t stay still for a second,” Edward suddenly said, breaking the silence in the car.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly, and she turned to look at Fourth Master Swan.

She did not know if it was her eyes that were playing tricks on her. At this moment, she seemed to feel that Fourth Master Swan had lost his aura. He had lost his aura from the detention center just now. He seemed to have become much weaker.

Yes, he was weak.

Jeanne thought that perhaps it was her illusion.

Fourth Master Swan had always been high and mighty, standing tall and unyielding.

Jeanne responded with some sarcasm, “Isn’t this all because of you?”

Edward looked at Jeanne, “So you’re angry?”

“No,” Jeanne said bluntly, “All karma has its consequences. I deserved it for sleeping with you in the past. Now that you’re taking revenge on me, I have nothing to say.”

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

“Melody is targeting me because of your intentional actions. Given how you treated me in front of her just now, I suppose I won’t be far from death next time even if I don’t die this time.”

“So this is how you think of me, Ms. Lawrence.”

“Fourth Master.” Jeanne looked very serious. “Seven years ago, it was my fault. Now, I should pay the price. However, if I’m lucky enough to escape this time, please be magnanimous and let me go. I only have one life.”

Edward was indifferent and did not say a word.

Jeanne felt that she had expressed what she needed to express.

She looked out of the window. “Thank you for bailing me before court, Fourth Master. Please pull over. I have to go back.”

Edward remained indifferent.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She looked at the driver.

The driver felt the gaze behind him but pretended not to see it.

Those who had been by Fourth Master Swan’s side for a long time knew that he could not be provoked at this time.

Jeanne looked at Nox again.

Nox had initially turned around to look at them secretly. He just wanted to see what kind of expression Fourth Master Swan would have when he was misunderstood.

He was just... Gloating over Fourth Master’s tragedy.

Nevertheless, when Nox met Jeanne’s gaze, he quickly turned around. He even muttered softly, “Don’t harm me. I only have one life too.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She let herself relax.

In any case, she was very fortunate that she was bailed. She still had many things to do.

The most important thing was of course to investigate her case and find evidence to clear her name.

Even so, Fourth Master Swan did not seem to want to let her go.

Jeanne was also very clear that she could not go head-to-head with Fourth Master Swan.

As such, she chose to remain silent and sat in the back seat silently. She watched the car drive into the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.

The car stopped.

Jeanne opened the car door.

She opened the car door and turned around, ready to leave on foot.

Despite that, her body was suddenly tugged at by someone.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At the next second, she was forcefully brought into Fourth Master Swan’s private residence.

Nox stood at the back and watched the two of them leave.

Should he get involved in this fight between the “husband and wife”?

Yes.

He should go and watch the show.

Hence, he hurriedly followed.

In the hall, Teddy looked at his master’s sudden return in complete disbelief.

In the past, Fourth Master would be away at least a week every year, and every time he came back, he would “recuperate”. How could he be so energetic at this time? More importantly, he even dragged Ms. Lawrence along.

What was going on?

Teddy stepped forward with an expression of solicitude.

“Shut up!” Edward said coldly.

Teddy felt wronged.

What did he do wrong for his master to treat him like this?

Nox walked toward Teddy and patted his shoulder. “Your master has been despised by his wife. You have to forgive him.”

‘Wife?!

‘Ms. Lawrence?’

“Although I know that you’ve been coveting Fourth Master Swan’s attractiveness for a long time, there’s no other way. You can’t make him gay,” Nox comforted Teddy.

Teddy’s eyes were wide open as he retorted loudly, “Young Master Winter, what nonsense are you talking about? I’m straight, I’m straight! I like women!”

Nox could not help but laugh.

Sometimes, teasing Teddy was very fun.

“I’m not going to talk to you anymore. I’m going to see how Fourth Master Swan coaxes his wife!” Next, Nox went up to the second floor as well.

Teddy did not know why Young Master Winter always looked energetic.

More importantly, was Young Master Winter really not afraid of death?

Teddy clearly felt that his master was furious at this moment.

Given that Nox still went to watch the show at this time, was he not afraid of being killed by Fourth Master Swan?!

In any case, Teddy would not dare to do that.
