Chapter 312: Edward Agrees to Get Married

She said, “Dad, I’m a little tired, so I’ll head to my room now.”

“Have you been staying at Fourth Master Swan’s place for the past few days?” Alexander asked.

Jeanne nodded in response.

She really did not want to waste her time on Alexander.

“What’s your relationship with Fourth Master Swan now?” Alexander asked bluntly.

Jeanne did not want to answer.

She felt that although Fourth Master Swan had agreed to it, she was afraid... he would suddenly go back on his word.

It was not that she did not trust him, but after thinking it through, she felt that she had come with ill intentions.

If he really had some sense, he would not have agreed to marry her so abruptly.

“What? You can’t say it?!” Alexander’s face darkened.

“I can’t say it.” Jeanne did not beat around the bush.

Alexander sneered and looked at Jeanne in contempt.

Jeanne did not need to think to know what Alexander thought of her. In Alexander’s mind, she and Fourth Master Swan were just sleeping together.

......

She did not explain herself, nor did she want to explain herself.

In any case, she did not care about how Alexander saw her.

With that, she held onto George’s hand and left straight for upstairs.

Alexander’s expression was ugly, but he did not say anything more.

Meanwhile, Jenifer stared at Jeanne’s silhouette and purposely said, “I can’t believe Jeanne would actually sell her body.”

Alexander sneered, “Otherwise, do you think she is where she is now by relying on herself?”

“That’s true. Jeanne has so many assets. It would be impossible for her to earn it all by herself even over eight lifetimes! Who knows how many men she had to accompany to have her current achievements?” Jenifer looked a little annoyed. “Right now, everyone out there is talking about where Jeanne got her money. She has really dragged the Lawrences’ name through the mind.”

Alexander’s expression was a little grim. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Jenifer knew best to fan the flames, so she said again, “Right now, for Jeanne to do better in life, she has gone to seduce Fourth Master Swan again. Although Fourth Master Swan has shown his fondness for Jeanne at all major events, I heard from Jasmine that Fourth Master Swan did this so that he had a reasonable reason to reject the Sanders. However, I don’t understand why Fourth Master Swan would reject a perfectly fine princess of the Sanders.”

Alexander did not understand it at first either.

That was until he had a few words with Eden, who told him that the Sanders had taken a fancy to the Swans’ assets and wanted to use the marriage to get a piece of that cake.

When he thought about it, he found it reasonable for the Sanders to be afraid of how powerful the Swans were becoming.

Then, he instantly understood.

Seeing Alexander did not speak, Jenifer continued. “Now that the Sanders’s third princess has passed away unexpectedly, Jeanne probably knows she’s useless. That is why she climbed into Fourth Master Swan’s bed and won’t let him go.”

“Jeanne really knows no shame!” Alexander cursed fiercely.

“However, I do rather admire Jeanne.” Jenifer appeared to be very sincere. “Fourth Master Swan hasn’t had a single woman by his side for so many years, yet Jeanne got into his bed. It shows that Jeanne is quite capable. Now that I think about it, it’s not surprising for Jeanne to have such a large amount of assets. If she could seduce Fourth Master Swan, other men shouldn’t be a problem!”

She was certain that Jeanne had gotten all her money from men.

“What’s there to be proud of by selling one’s body? If not for the fact my father thinks highly of Jeanne now, I would’ve kicked her out of the house long ago!” Alexander snickered.

“Forget it. Doesn’t the old master think Jeanne is useful now?” Jenifer advised, “I think the old master knows his limits, but...”

“But what?”Alexander’s expression turned cold.

“But the old master thinks so highly of Jeanne, and since Joshua is so useless, I’m really afraid that the old master would make his decision and hand the Lawrence Enterprise over to Jeanne. In the end, didn’t the Lawrences want someone to carry on the family name? In any case, even if the women in the Harken are deemed unsuitable to assume that role, if there was no other choice, the daughter would have to bear that responsibility. More importantly, Jeanne now has a son, George, whose surname is also Lawrence.”

That was Jenifer’s concern.

She had finally found the right time, when Alexander was very dissatisfied with Jeanne, to say it, all because she wanted him to be on her side.

When Alexander heard what Jenifer said, his expression turned ugly. “Who can you blame? It’s all Joshua’s fault for not living up to expectations!”
