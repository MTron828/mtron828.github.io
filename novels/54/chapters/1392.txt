1393 Birthday Surprise

Most importantly, she did not feel repulsed at all.

She had originally decided not to have any contact with that woman. However, that woman had a magical power that made it difficult for her to resist.

“What’s up?” Monica’s expression was cold.

“George’s birthday is this Saturday,” Candice said bluntly.

She just did not feel like she had to be too polite with Monica.

At that moment, Monica seemed to realize what was going on. She had almost forgotten because George had not celebrated his birthday in the past two years.

He was not even in South Hampton City on his birthdays, so she could not celebrate with him.

“Are you free on Saturday?” Candice asked.

“Are you going to celebrate George’s birthday with him?”

“That’s right.”

“George doesn’t spend his birthdays in South Hampton City.”

“I’ve already spoken to Edward to keep George here this time.”

“Alright.” Monica immediately agreed.

George was her godson, so she definitely had to go.

“I want to give George a surprise.” Candice asked, “Do you have any ideas as to how we can do that?”

“I really don’t know how to answer your sudden question. Let me think about it.”

“Okay, but if you do have some good ideas, you must let me know.”

“Yes.” Monica nodded. Then, she thought of something and said, “George is a little stubborn.”

Candice was stunned.

“George still hasn’t let go of Jeanne after so many years, and he probably doesn’t celebrate his birthday because he doesn’t want to think of Jeanne. I’m worried that we’ll make things worse if we want to celebrate his birthday without telling him beforehand.”

“But George can’t stay like this forever. He will have to get over it one day.” Candice did not think much of it.

“Of course, I support your decision, but I just want you to be mentally prepared.”

Monica was not stupid to know that Candice wanted to celebrate George’s birthday to gain his approval. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, what she was worried about was that George would not only not approve of it but would also dislike her even more. After all, no one could change Jeanne’s place in George’s heart.

“Don’t worry. I have a strong mind.” Candice smiled and said, “I won’t disturb you from your work. I’ll go online and see if there are any good ideas that I can use as a reference.”

“Okay.”

After they hung up the phone, Monica was also thinking about how they could surprise George and what birthday present she should prepare for him. However, George seemed to have everything he wanted.

While she was lost in thought, someone knocked on the door.

Monica responded, “Come in.”

“Chairman, your flowers.” Tim walked in with a bouquet of flowers.

It had been a month since she broke up with Finn, but she still received flowers every day. Even though she had rejected them every time, Tim would still bring them in, and she was starting to get a little scared of them.

She was a little angry at Tim. “I said I don’t want them. Why are you bringing it in?”

“Uh...” Tim felt a little awkward after being scolded.

“Is there something you can’t say?” Monica frowned.

She, too, knew that Tim would not ignore her instructions.

“Dr. Jiang sent it over personally,” Tim said.

Monica was stunned.

“I really can’t refuse Dr. Jones, so…”

Monica did not expect to hear that Finn personally delivered it.

Was he not usually very busy? Why did he have so much time now to deliver the flowers personally?

The key was to send it every day at 10 a.m. in the morning, and Finn should be busy at the hospital.

She looked at Tim, who was a little embarrassed, and held herself back. “Put it down.”

“Yes.” Tim heaved a sigh of relief and left.

Monica glanced at the fresh flowers in front of her and picked up her phone to send a message to Finn.

When she opened their chat, she saw that Finn had sent her a lot of messages in the past month. He had probably said everything he wanted to say in this lifetime, yet Monica did not look at it or reply to him.

She initially wanted to block Finn’s number, but after thinking about it, Finn was her father’s attending doctor, after all. If anything happened, they would not be able to contact each other.

However, because of Monica’s coldness toward him, Finn went from sending long text messages at the start to only sending one or two sentences a day.

Today’s text was even simpler. Only a “good morning” message was sent at 7:30 a.m., so she figured Finn’s enthusiasm would probably die down soon.

With that, she typed into the dialog box. “How much were the flowers? I’ll pay you back.”
