Chapter 293: George Is “Abused”, and Jeanne Returns

“I think so too,” Edward said.

He had just eaten the food Jeanne made two days ago.

“Does your mom always wash the dishes?” Edward asked again.

George frowned but still answered, “Yes.”

“You have to learn to wash the dishes yourself in the future.”

George did not want to bother with Fourth Master Swan.

Edward did not say much to George. He instructed, “Come out after your shower.”

“I don’t have any clothes.”

“They’re outside.”

Edward turned around and walked out of the bathroom.

George took a look at Fourth Master Swan and quickly rinsed off the foam on his body. He walked to the bedroom outside.

Just as he walked out, a white towel was thrown directly on his body.

George was stunned.

He quickly wrapped the towel around his body and dried himself.

Afterward, he saw a set of children’s clothes on the sofa in the bedroom. He hesitated for a moment before putting them on.

The size was just right.

Edward seemed to have sized him up and said, “Come this way.”

George followed Edward and walked into the bathroom again.

Fourth Master Swan’s bathroom was very big. The dry and wet areas were well separated.

At this moment, George was in front of the bathroom sink. Edward was blowing his hair roughly.

George bit his lip and did not move.

After a while, his hair was blown dry.

Edward put down the hair dryer and asked casually, “Are your curls natural?”

It was not natural.

Jeanne said that it was for fashion, so she gave him a perm.

It was done by her.

George did not say anything.

Edward casually rubbed his hair a few times. “Just like a poodle.”

‘You’re the dog—everyone in your family is a dog!’

“Take an afternoon nap.” Edward messed with George’s hair for a while before instructing him again.

George did not have the habit of taking an afternoon nap.

“I advise you to preserve your strength. There are still a lot of things to do in the afternoon.”

George did not look at Edward.

“For example, mopping the floor, washing clothes...” Edward said, “Before you consider calling your mom and asking me to send you over, you have to be prepared to live under someone else’s roof.”

George hated Fourth Master Swan.

After Edward finished, he turned around and walked out.

The moment he walked out, he did not forget to remind George, “Don’t think about jumping out of the window. This floor isn’t high, but you’ll easily break an arm or a leg.”

George bit his lip, and his expression became even worse.

Nonetheless, he was still threatened by Fourth Master Swan.

He climbed onto the bed and was very unhappy.

What made him even more unhappy was that after he got up from his nap, he was really ordered by Fourth Master Swan to start cleaning the big home.

George started by mopping the floor.

There were three floors, each floor more than 100 square meters. A 6-year-old child like him had to clean the big house.

Teddy could not stand it anymore.

He wanted to help George but was stopped by Fourth Master Swan’s death stare.

Feeling repentant, he could only watch George mop every floor.

It took a full six hours from 3:00 pm to 9:00 pm.

After mopping the floor, George could eat.

George was so hungry that he wolfed down his food.

Edward looked at George and smiled.

George finished eating.

Before Edward said anything, George went to wash the dishes.

After washing them, he wiped the surroundings and the ground clean.

Edward nodded. “Tomorrow, Teddy will teach you how to wash clothes.”

Teddy did not want to abuse a child.

“You can go upstairs to sleep now,” Edward instructed.

George quickly went upstairs.

Nox was still here at the moment. Regarding Fourth Master Swan abusing a child…

Well, he had no comments.

He stood up and said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back too.”

“Wait,” Edward said.

Nox thought he had heard wrongly.

“Someone will come.”

If it was not Jeanne, it would be Kingsley.

Edward was ready to greet whoever came.

After saying that, he went upstairs.

Nox was confused.

‘Did he suffer too much and become abnormal?!’

In the end, Nox still stayed.

Late at night, it was quiet.

Nox fell asleep on the sofa in the living room.

Jeanne appeared at Bamboo Garden.

In fact, Fourth Master Swan’s Bamboo Garden was even easier to enter than the Lawrences’ manor.

Other than the gate of the manor that was being guarded, there was no one else. In particular, Bamboo Garden could be easily accessed once one entered the manor.

Entering a gate was a piece of cake for Jeanne.

At this moment, she had arrived in front of the building in Bamboo Garden.

Of course, she was not stupid enough to enter directly through the hall.

Even though she knew there were very few people in Bamboo Garden, it was not to the point that she could swagger around. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne walked directly to the backyard.

She needed to analyze which room George was in.

Logically speaking, George should not be in Fourth Master Swan’s room. Fourth Master Swan would not let George sleep with him.

Then, it was very likely that George was in the room next to Fourth Master Swan’s.

Even if he was not next door, at least there was no one next door. It was considered the safest place to enter from.

Jeanne did not waste any time. She nimbly climbed up to the second floor, climbed over the outer balcony, and walked straight into the bedroom.

In the bedroom, she carefully approached the big bed.

There was a small person on the bed. She did not need to get too close to know that it was George.

Jeanne held her breath and went to George’s side. She whispered in George’s ear, “George.”

George frowned.

After a while, he opened his eyes.

Before he could speak, his mother covered his mouth. “Don’t talk, I’ll take you away.”

George nodded.

He knew his mom would not leave him behind.

Jeanne carried George up from the bed.

Then, she quickly went to the balcony and put George down. “I’ll go down first, then I’ll catch you from below.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne directly jumped down from the second floor.

There was a lawn below. Although the floor was a little high, Jeanne was skillful, so she did not feel anything when she jumped down.

After she landed, she stabilized her body.

Just as she was about to get up and let George jump down, a man’s voice was suddenly heard coming from behind her.

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re really skilled!”

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

She knew it would not be so easy to take George away!
