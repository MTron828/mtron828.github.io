Chapter 81: I Only Lent Jeanne to You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After taking a shower and having dinner, George planned to go back.

Teddy suddenly went forward respectfully. “Fourth Master, Shawn Reed from the Reed Group has brought his son, Adam Reed, to look for you. He’s waiting outside the door.”

Edward took a look at George.

George was a little baffled.

Edward said indifferently. “Let them come in.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Understood.”

Teddy turned around and left. He brought a few people in later.

As soon as they entered, George recognized the boy.

Although the boy was badly bruised, George recognized that he was the one who had taken the lead in beating him today.

Shawn hurriedly tugged at his son and said apologetically, “Fourth Master, my son has offended you today. I brought him here to let you deal with him.”

“He hasn’t offended me.” Edward’s voice was neither slow nor hurried as he glanced at Adam.

The moment Adam met Fourth Master Swan’s gaze, he was so frightened that he was about to cry again.

Initially, he had gone back to complain about his grievances. He did not expect that when he said that he had offended Edward Swan, he was almost beaten to death by his dad.

Now, he was asked to apologize again. He had originally refused, but he was beaten up again.

“Yes, yes, yes. He must’ve offended Little Master San. I’ll ask him to apologize to him in person,” Shawn said quickly.

“That’s not it too,” Edward said coldly.

“Huh?” Shawn was a little confused.

While his son said that he had beaten up a boy named George, he was certain that it was not George. The only person that Fourth Master Swan could stand up for was Quinton, his nephew.

“George,” Edward called him calmly.

George looked at Edward.

Edward asked, “Do you forgive him?”

George turned his head and looked at Adam.

Adam had been beaten up terribly.

Shawn was also a smart person in the business world. He quickly realized that his son had indeed offended this little boy named George.

At this moment, Shawn did not have time to think about why Fourth Master Swan would protect an unknown little boy. He quickly grabbed his son and said, “Hurry up and apologize.”

Adam was pulled in front of George by his dad, who was very embarrassed. He sobbed and said to George, “I’m sorry, George.”

George just looked at him and did not answer.

Shawn quickly tried to fawn over him and said, “George, it’s Adam’s fault for hitting you today. I’ve gone back and beat him up. Will you forgive him?”

“No,” George uttered clearly.

Shawn looked embarrassed.

Teddy was also a little surprised.

He had always thought that George was the kind of boy who was boring and easy to compromise with. George was the kind that was easy to bully.

George was cornered this afternoon and did not resist or make a fuss. He seemed to be the kind of boy who would tolerate it and was very introverted.

Edward, who was at the side, raised the corner of his mouth.

“Then, how will you forgive him?” Shawn asked awkwardly.

“My mom said that something wrong that’s done is done. It doesn’t need to be forgiven,” George said, “Either you continue to be wrong, or you correct yourself. The price of forgiveness is too light. It’s meaningless and a waste of time.”

Shawn was stunned.

George’s words rendered him speechless.

Instantly, he felt a little awkward.

Shawn asked after a long while, “Then how would you like him to correct himself?”

“Correct the way he was wrong,” George said seriously.

Shawn nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. Then I promise that Adam will never bully you again. If he bullies you again, I’ll break his legs!”

George did not say anything else.

Fourth Master Swan spoke, “George said that he doesn’t need to be forgiven because the price of forgiveness is too light. The underlying meaning is that you have to pay the price for doing wrong.”

His indifferent words made Shawn’s hair stand on end.

Shawn quickly said respectfully, “Fourth Master, please instruct me. I’ll do what I can.”

“Adam, right?”

“Yes,” Adam answered with tears in his eyes.

“You’re a tyrant at school?” Edward raised his eyebrow.

“Waaah...” Adam was scared to tears.

He had never been beaten up like that by his father since he was young.

Everyone in the family was in a state of panic because he had offended Edward.

He also knew that this matter seemed to be very serious.

“From now on, you’ll be George’s little brother.” Edward was straightforward.

Adam looked at Edward in disbelief.

“Do you have any objections?”

“He dares not, he dares not,” Shawn quickly said, “From now on, in school, George will be Adam’s big brother. Don’t worry. In the future, he won’t bully George anymore. He’ll also protect George and listen to all his arrangements.”

Edward nodded. “Alright, bring your son back.”

“Fourth Master, I’m really sorry to disturb you. I’ll surely discipline my child well in the future,” Shawn quickly promised.

Edward did not reply,

Shawn tactfully took his son and left.

After leaving, Edward also took George and sent him back to the Lawrence family’s manor.

It was very quiet in the car.

George wanted to speak a few times, but he kept his mouth shut.

“If you have something to say, just say it. We’ll be at your house soon,” Edward suddenly said.

George bit his lip and seemed to have mustered up his courage. “Why did you help me?”

Edward turned to look at George. “Are you touched?”

“No.” George refused flatly.

Edward smiled but did not answer.

“Actually, I don’t like you.” George was very serious.

“You’ve said it before.” Edward was very indifferent.

“But if...” George bit his lip. “If you promise not to snatch my mom away from me, I can barely like you.”

Edward smiled again.

He said, “That won’t do.”

George’s face was filled with annoyance.

Edward said, “Besides, I’m not the one who wants to snatch your mom away. I’m the one who lent her to you temporarily. You’ll have to return what you borrowed sooner or later.”

‘That’s not true.’

The car stopped at the front door of the Lawrence family’s house.

Fourth Master Swan did not get out of the car.

George was sent back by Teddy.

Jeanne took a look at George and said to Teddy, “Go back and tell your master that the next time he gets sick again, I’ll really send him to the hospital!”

Teddy replied respectfully, “Yes, I’ll definitely pass on the message.”

Jeanne watched Teddy leave and turned her head to look at George.

George’s eyes flickered as he felt that he had made a mistake.

He followed Jeanne back to the room.

There were many clothes that Fourth Master Swan had bought for him. Fourth Master Swan had gotten the shopping mall to send them back in advance, filling up George’s room.

“Mom...” George called out to her.

Jeanne took a deep breath. “Forget it, sleep early.”

This was not her son’s fault.

She did not have to let her son take the blame for someone else’s mistakes.

“Okay.” George obediently went to the bathroom to wash up.

Lying on the bed, George could not fall asleep.

Jeanne could not fall asleep either.

On one hand, she was angered by Fourth Master Swan. On the other hand, she was thinking about work tomorrow.

“Mom,” George said.

“Hmm?”

“Does everyone change when they grow up?” George asked.

Jeanne was a little silent.

She did not expect him to ask such a deep question all of a sudden.

Just as she was thinking of a more philosophical and understandable answer, George said again, “Fourth Master Swan’s looks very strange.”

Jeanne frowned.

“He gave me a shower. I saw it.” George described it very clearly.

“...”

‘So…

‘What should I say?!’
