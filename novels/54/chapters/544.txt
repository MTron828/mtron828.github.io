Chapter 545: Edward’s Identity Revealed (Back To The Main Story)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The news of “Monica Keeping Her Innocence for Michael All This While” spread across all of Harken and was widely talked about. Everyone was praising their faithful love and was envious of how they could still stay innocent for each other after so many years.

The news was popular.

The hashtags “Monica’s Innocence”, “Michael and Monica”, “Michael Isn’t the Third Party”, “Monica and Finn Divorce Long Ago” and so on were trending on the Internet and were a hot topic of discussion.

With that, their image of Michael instantly changed.

From the immoral man who came in between someone else’s relationship, he had become the best and most infatuated man in the world.

Many people saw the news, including the party involved, Finn.

There was nothing he could do about it as it was the first thing he saw when he opened the news on his phone.

Even so, he did not refuse and just clicked on it.

It had only been three or four hours since Monica and Michael told the public about it, but who knew it would become so popular?

In fact, it was hard to believe that no one was promoting it behind the scenes.

However, Finn read the news calmly.

There were many praises for Monica and Michael on the news, but not much for him. Other than his divorce from Monica, there was not much of him on the news, and he did not garner too much attention.

To him, that was enough since he did not want too much trouble in his life either.

After all, he had no reason to pay for their love.

The moment he put down the phone, the word “Nox” appeared on the screen. He took a look at it and picked up the phone calmly. “Nox.”

“Monica dumped you in the end, huh?” Nox was straightforward and did not beat around the bush.

“What else could it be?”

“I don’t even know what to say.” Nox was speechless.

After reading the news for the past few days, he really did not know what to say. He felt relieved and angry at the same time, but all in all, he just felt sorry for Finn.

Yet, he did not expect Finn to be so calm.

From Finn’s tone, he sounded frighteningly calm.

“In that case, don’t.” Finn said indifferently, “There’s nothing to say.”

“Can you let go? Do you want me to have a drink with you or something?”

“I’ve let go,” Finn said easily.

Nox did not know if Finn truly did not care, but the latter did not sound like he was lying.

In fact, Nox had always found Finn to be a rational person who would not do anything to hurt himself or take revenge on someone. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Finn could quickly regulate his emotions, and for being able to do that, he was not cold-blooded.

He had just learned how to protect himself, and he paid a huge price for learning from all that he experienced and all the pain he had suffered.

“By the way, have you never been in bed with Monica?” Although Finn did not care anymore, Nox still could not let it go.

“Nope,” Finn admitted.

“Does Monica even know how protective you were of her?” Nox lost control of himself and roared.

If that woman regretted it one day, he would really despise her.

“I wasn’t protecting her. It just didn’t develop to the point where we could have sex yet,” Finn said without portraying himself as great. “And fortunately, we have nothing to do with each other anymore now.”

“What exactly is that woman thinking?” Nox gritted his teeth.

Finn did not answer because Monica’s thoughts were no longer important to him.

He said, “Nox, I’ll leave it at that. Monica’s father is calling me.”

“That old man, Cardellini?” Nox raised his eyebrows. “I’m afraid he’ll die from anger.”

“Maybe, but this is something that Monica should handle.”

“That’s true.” Nox nodded. “Are you really okay?”

“Yes,” Finn replied.

“If anything, don’t keep it to yourself.”

“Okay.”

After all, the two of them ended the call.

Finn looked at the name “Dad” that kept flashing on his phone.

He pondered for a moment, but in the end, he chose to hang up.

The moment he hung up, he changed the contact names of “Dad” and “Mom” to “Uncle Gary” and “Aunt Ruby”.

Then, he chose to switch off his phone and got up from the sofa.

Just as he was about to return to his room, the door swung open.
