1155 The War Has Started: Edward’s True Identity Is Exposed

In fact, Finn should have died.

None of them expected that a woman, who did not care about her life, would pop out of nowhere and save Finn, ruining his plan!

“Where’s Jeanne?” Warren asked Chester fiercely.

“In her room.”

“Call her over,” Warren ordered coldly.

Chester did as he was told.

When he turned around to give orders to his subordinates, Warren said angrily, “Is Jeanne the only one in this family who can be my right-hand man?!”

Chester heard everything. There was no expression on his face, but he began to bear a grudge in his heart.

He was originally the person his father trusted the most. Yet now, because of a single mistake, he had been belittled to such an extent.

Jeanne was just a pawn. How could she be compared to him, the only qualified heir to the Sanders?

In the study room, the atmosphere was tense until Jeanne came in.

When she saw the paper and ink on the floor and Warren’s expression, she could roughly guess what was going on.

She remained calm and said, “Are you looking for me?”

“What do you think of the news this time?” Warren asked bluntly.

“Big brother told me not to interfere. He said he has settled things with you,” Jeanne said on purpose.

There was a hint of sarcasm in her words.

Warren’s face turned dark at the thought that his plan had failed. He said, “There’s been an accident, and it hasn’t been resolved yet.”

Jeanne remained silent as if she was seriously thinking about how to deal with that matter.

“Did the Duncans do it?” Jeanne asked.

Warren nodded.

“Their goal is to deliberately create a conflict so that we can’t take care of it ourselves and we’ll give up on finding the whereabouts of the Duncans’ descendant.” Jeanne made an analysis.

Warren listened with a dark expression.

“In other words, we’re heading in the right direction.” Jeanne said to Warren, “If we didn’t make them panic, they wouldn’t have done something so desperate.”

“You mean that because we’re about to find this descendant of the Duncans, they’re in danger. And that’s why they’re doing this to distract us?” Warren said coldly.

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“So, what should we do now? Should we let the news spread and look for the descendant of the Duncans first, or… give up on finding the existence of their descendants for the time being?”

“Stopping the news from spreading is not in conflict with finding the Duncans’ descendant anyway,” Jeanne said domineeringly.

Warren could not help but get a little excited.

“You can even make the Duncans more flustered.”

“Go ahead.” That immediately piqued Warren’s interest.

“The problem with the news is that we used illegal means to obtain the private economy so that we, the Sanders, could control Harken’s economy. The companies that were hurt were Lawrence Enterprise, Cardellini Enterprise, and Swan Enterprise. As long as the three companies work together to prove that we didn’t do such a thing, the news will be dispelled.”

Warren said in disbelief, “How can we get the three companies to speak for us?”

“Sure.” Jeanne was very certain. “Jasmine is the only legal heir of Lawrence Enterprise. I’ll find Jasmine and have her announce to the world that it’s reasonable for me to get the right of inheritance to Lawrence Enterprise and that she has voluntarily given up the right of inheritance. She owes me a favor, so she’ll agree. As for Cardellini Pharmaceutical, I can tell you with certainty that as long as I go to Monica, Monica will do anything for me. There’s no need for a reason. So, there’s no need to worry about Cardellini Pharmaceutical. The last one is Edward, who is even easier to deal with. If you let him go as an exchange, he’ll be more than happy to do so.”

At that moment, Warren could not help but look at Jeanne deep in the eyes.

In his opinion, he was at his wit’s end, but Jeanne had made it sound so easy. If he had known, he should have let Jeanne handle that matter instead of acting rashly with Chester.

That was the result of acting rashly, and it caused a lot of unnecessary things to happen. For example, Monica, the key person needed for that incident, was said to still be in the intensive care unit.

Jeanne continued, “Our efforts will go to waste if we let Edward go, so we can’t really let him go.”

“You want to scheme against him?”

Jeanne nodded.

“It’s not easy to plot against him Edward,” Warren reminded Jeanne.

“Edward has a fatal flaw,” Jeanne said coldly.

Warren frowned. He did not realize that Edward had any fatal flaw.

“He can’t let go of me.” Jeanne said, “So, we can use the honey trap.”

“Is it still useful at this point?” Warren did not believe it.

“You’ll know once you try.”

“Alright.” Warren had no other choice.

“The best outcome would be for me and Edward to get back together again, and the Duncans would then think that Edward had betrayed them for me. Once Edward’s betrayal is confirmed, the Duncans will initiate a change, and a war will break out at any moment.” Jeanne looked at Warren. “Father, I don’t think you’ve forgotten why we captured Edward.”

Warren thought for a while and said, “To cause internal conflicts in the Duncans and cause chaos.”

“Therefore, finding the descendant of the Duncans is not important. What’s important is to force them to show up without sufficient preparation, force them to make a move, and kill them!”

“Let’s go according to your plan, and I will support you unconditionally!” Warren agreed.

“Now, I want to have a talk with Edward,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Sure.” Warren nodded.

“I’ll go by myself.”

Warren hesitated for a second. “Okay.”

...

Jeanne turned to leave.

“Jeannie.” Warren suddenly called out to her, “I have some bad news for you.”

Jeanne frowned.

“Something happened to Monica,” Warren said bluntly.

Jeanne’s expression changed.

“It was Chester’s fault. When he tried to kill Finn to destroy all the evidence and people who were against us, he accidentally injured Monica. She’s in the intensive care unit right now. She just underwent a craniotomy surgery and is still in a coma.” Warren blamed himself. “I know you have a good relationship with Monica, so I specifically instructed them not to hurt Monica when dealing with Finn. However, I didn’t expect that Monica would risk her own life for Finn. In the end, Finn didn’t die, and now, we don’t know if Monica is dead or alive.”

Jeanne clenched her fists tightly, and her body trembled. She knew that Finn was in danger, but she did not know that Monica was involved. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Go and check on her first and see how she’s doing.” Warren said, “If she’s not doing well, try to clear our family’s name by clarifying the situation. Think about whether there are other people involved.”

Jeanne walked out of Warren’s study and slammed the door behind her.

It was a sign of Jeanne’s temper — that she did not hold back on venting her anger on Warren.

Warren did not dare to reprimand Jeanne. He even felt that Jeanne would play the most crucial role in whether he could win against the Duncans.

...

However, at that moment, Chester was a little angry. “Jeanne is too unruly. How dare she slam the door?!”

“If you had Jeanne’s ability, you could slam the door too!” Warren was obviously mocking Chester.

When he thought about how Chester had not only failed in his attempt to settle the matter but had also made a huge mistake and caused Monica, who was currently the most useful person to their family, to be in a critical condition, he was furious.

Chester did not expect that he would be scolded by his father for helping the latter to scold Jeanne.

His face was filled with embarrassment, and he felt extremely upset! How could he let Jeanne take his place?!
