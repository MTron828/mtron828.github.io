1314 The First Negotiation With George

Candice looked at Monica’s messages. Even though she had only known Monica for a day, she seemed to know that this was Monica’s style, full of vibrance.

Monica did not get a reply from her, so she sent another message: [Remember to reply to me when you wake up.]

She probably thought that Candice was still asleep, so she did not call to wake her up.

Candice looked at her phone and wrote: [I’m fine. I was indeed drunk last night. I’m not feeling too well now that I’ve woken up. The Chief didn’t do anything to me. Don’t worry.]

Right then, Monica called.

Candice answered, “Monica.”

“Are you really alright?” Monica asked.

“No, I did feel a little dizzy last night and even blacked out, but I woke up early this morning and felt refreshed.”

“That’s good.” Monica heaved a sigh of relief and could not help but ask, “Did the Chief really not do anything to you? Did you forget how he treated you last night?”

No matter how she looked at it, she felt that with Edward’s personality, he should be very unhappy that Candice went to such a place.

After all, Edward was now the leader of the country and had to pay attention to everything.

And she was still challenging his limits.

“I had a blackout last night, but not today. He didn’t give me any foul mood today…” Candice had yet to finish her sentence.

“Did you spend the night at the Chief’s house last night?!” Monica was super excited.

Candice pursed her lips. She had never thought of hiding anything from Monica.

But right now, she regretted it. It was obvious that Monica had misunderstood.

“It was because I was drunk that he brought me straight to his house. But we didn’t do anything.”

“Nothing?” How could Monica believe it? “A man and a woman, an engaged couple, didn’t do anything?! Edward has been holding it in for so many years. How can he let you off?!”

In the beginning, she even pretended to call him Chief but now, she had completely switched her form of address for him.

“Really, nothing,” Candice explained. “I was drunk. What can he do?”

“It’s because you were drunk that he was able to get his way.” Monica was certain.

How could she explain?

“F*ck.” Monica could not help but curse. She knew that she could not have any expectations for that Sc*mbag Swan. Men only thought with their d*cks.

Now with a new woman, how would he still remember the old ones?

The thought of Jeanne being buried alone underground while the man she loved the most was now living a good life really made Monica explode with anger.

When she woke up today, she was a little worried that Candice would be implicated because of her. Now, she felt that she was indeed overthinking.

Candice and Edward were a couple, while she was being… nosy.

She hung up the phone angrily.

Every time she encountered something related to Edward, she would completely lose control of herself. She lay on the hotel bed and faced the ceiling, throwing a tantrum.

A text message notification chimed. Monica glanced at it casually.

He looked at the message from Candice. “Thank you for yesterday. I had a great time.”

‘Well good for you because I didn’t.’

Monica ignored the text. Just as she was about to put down her phone, she saw another message from someone else.

It was Brandon. He said, “Monica, are you awake? If you’re awake, send me a reply. I’ll come and look for you.”

Monica took a deep breath and replied, “I’m awake.”

Not long after, there was a knock on the hotel door. It was as if that fellow had been waiting for her at the door.

She got up lazily from the bed. Fortunately, it was Saturday and she did not have to go to work, so she could still get up slowly. She opened the door and saw Brandon holding a few bags in his hands with a bright warm smile on his face.

That moment touched Monica for some reason. She just thought that a man looked quite good when he smiled.

“Monica, I vomited on your clothes last night. I’ll compensate you with a new set of clothes.” Brandon waved the bags in his hand. This man actually went to buy clothes for her so early in the morning?!

Her plan was to wait for when she woke up and slowly get one of the brands she usually frequented to send new clothes over.

However, since Brandon had already bought it, she could not refuse.

From the looks of it… Brandon also bought a set for himself.

Of course, they could not wear their clothes from last night.
