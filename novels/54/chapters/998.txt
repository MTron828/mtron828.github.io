999 Monica’s First Victory, Michael’s First Defeat

“Now, Monica is asking me to give her an explanation! Michael, aren’t you being a little shameless by asking me to clean up your mess?”

“I’m sorry!” Michael apologized.

He could only apologize.

“I don’t want your apology!” Warren Sander’s aura was overbearing. “I’ll give you one day to think about how to solve this problem! If you don’t, I’ll sell you out, and don’t blame me for being merciless then. You’ve been in politics with your father for so many years, so you should be familiar with t the principle that the winner takes all!”

“Yes.” Instead of pleading for himself, Michael just accepted Warren’s wrath.

Warren did not say anything more and hung up the phone abruptly.

Michael clutched his phone, his hands trembling.

In fact, from the moment Monica exposed the suspicion that the report was fake, he had already thought of a way to get out of the situation. He was angry now not because he would be punished for this but because he could not bear the fact that Monica had escaped from the palm of his hand!

He just could not stand the fact that Monica could hold her own and even face him head-on! He wanted Monica to kneel in front of him and beg for his forgiveness!

His face turned cold.

Then, he immediately picked up his phone and dialed a number. “Brie, where are you?”

“What is it?” Brie asked.

“Let’s meet and talk about the vaccine incident.”

“...Okay.” She was a little hesitant, but she still agreed. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I’ve sent the address to your WhatsApp. I’ll be there in ten minutes.”

“Yes.”

Once they hung up the phone, Brie’s expression changed.

Last night, someone forced her door open in the middle of the night.

She did not know how Jeanne could be so capable as to destroy the lock of her high-class apartment and break into her house without any resistance just to tell her that Michael would kill her.

Of course, she would not believe Jeanne so easily, and Jeanne did not seem to expect her to believe it immediately.

Jeanne just told her what Michael was going to do to her next and told her to be on her guard. She also told her that if she did not dare to do anything to Michael, they would secretly protect her.

After a brief conversation, Jeanne left.

She really did not believe it and did not even want to take it to heart. However, she subconsciously knew that Jeanne was telling the truth.

If it were not true, why would Jeanne tell her that? Was Jeanne not afraid that she would repeat to Michael what she had just said?

In the end, after hesitating for a long time, she chose not to tell Michael.

She needed to leave herself some leeway.

She admitted that she loved Michael very much, so much so that she would do anything for him, but she was not blind. Even if Michael wanted to kill her, she had no regrets about loving him.

She was not a magnanimous person!

However, at that moment, she really did receive a call from Michael, and it proved that Jeanne was right.

Jeanne said that if anything happened to Michael, he would look for her immediately to find her and make her pay for her crimes.

She had agreed to meet Michael not only to discuss the vaccine but also to verify the truth of Jeanne’s words.

Brie gritted her teeth and quickly went to her destination, which was a very well-hidden coffee shop.

It was owned by Michael. There were only a few customers on a regular basis as he did not do any publicity for it. In short, it was not for profit. It was just a safe place for Michael to discuss business.

When Brie arrived, she was brought into a private room at the far end of the cafe.

Michael was waiting for her inside.

She went over and sat opposite Michael, who said, “Monica tricked me again!”

Michael’s expression was ugly.

He suddenly put down the cigarette that he was smoking, and pressed Brie onto the sofa in the private room, with the smell of smoke all over him.

Brie did not refuse and had never been able to refuse Michael.

In fact, she had been waiting for him for many years. Hence, now that Monica had broken up with him, she finally got Michael.

After a round of sex, Michael and Brie put on their clothes and sat in silence for a long time.

A long time passed when Michael said, “Brie, only you can help me now.”

Brie looked at Michael.

She had thought that Jeanne was lying when she was met with his tenderness and sweetness just now.

She did not reveal any expression and just looked at him silently.
