1261 A Sudden Heartwarming Moment, My Sister Will Be Named Paige

He had underestimated what impulses Jeanne’s body could trigger in him, and he needed her to tell him no to stop him.

Just as he stood up, Jeanne suddenly pulled him back, and Edward turned back to look at her. It was impossible for her not to know how dangerous he was at the moment.

“Where are you going?” Jeanne asked anxiously.

Edward gulped.

That was because when he turned around, he saw Jeanne’s unkempt appearance. Although she had really gained some weight, her touch... could still make him go crazy.

He said, “I’m going to take a shower.”

“I’ll help you,” Jeanne suddenly said.

Did she know what she was saying?

“I’ll help you...” Jeanne’s voice was a little soft, and her face was flushed.

It had been a long time since he had seen Jeanne so shy.

In the past, he could even… make it hard for Jeanne to get out of bed. However, he could not do that now because he could not hurt the baby. Even if he had to bear with it until he exploded, he had to endure it.

He said, “No need. I–”

Edward’s body froze as he looked at her flushed cheeks, which were now even redder. He held back the urge to lose control of himself, clenched his hands tightly, and let her…

At night, after a long time, Edward carried Jeanne into the bathroom.

Jeanne suddenly recalled something from a long time ago. In fact, it had not been long.

Although many things had happened between the two of them, it had only been a year since she returned to Harken. However, because she had gone through so much, she felt like it had been a long time.

She was reminded of the time when Edward was injured, and after that… she was also the one who helped him.

Although she was passive at that time, the feeling was almost the same.

At that time, she did not think that she would be together with Edward or that she and Edward would love each other so much one day.

Her eyes moved slightly.

After they cleaned up, the two of them suddenly looked at each other in the huge mirror. As they looked at each other, Jeanne suddenly laughed.

She said, “You’ve been holding back for so long.”

At that moment, Edward’s face turned red. To think there would come a day when such a confident Fourth Master Swan would also feel embarrassed!

“Yes,” he replied.

Although it was just a one-word reply, he knew exactly what happened just now.

“I’m sleepy.” Jeanne yawned.

After being tormented for so long, she was starting to feel sleepy. With that, Edward bent down and picked her up.

Jeanne was shocked as she could have walked on her own. However, she instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck, bringing the two of them closer.

When Edward gently placed her on the bed, Jeanne did not let go of his neck. The two of them were still looking at each other at a close distance.

Jeanne pouted her lips as if she wanted to kiss him, but to her surprise, Edward avoided her.

She was a little disappointed because she thought that he would like it. After all, before she was pregnant, the most common thing the two of them did in that house was… sex.

As if he had sensed Jeanne’s emotions, Edward suddenly smiled. It was a smile that she had not seen in a long time, and it was very charming.

It turned out that she was still looking forward to seeing him smile at her without putting up any defense. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He said, “Trust me, you will be crippled.”

“What?” Jeanne frowned.

She could not understand what that guy was saying.

“I’m talking about...” Edward’s charming smile was so handsome.

He then grabbed her small hand with his large hand and planted a kiss on her chubby palm. “Be good and go to sleep.”

His voice was filled with affection.

Jeanne also came to her senses at that moment. When she finally reacted, her face was a little red.

Men were really animals that thought with their lower bodies.

She let go of Edward’s neck and closed her eyes to go to sleep.

In the meantime, Edward also returned to the bed and lay beside her. From behind, he hugged her gently.

Eventually, Jeanne’s even breathing sounded.

Edward’s face, which was buried in her neck, inched closer. He was so greedy that he wanted to remember all of her taste.

…

She slept until the sun was high up in the sky.

Jeanne had never slept so soundly before. She would either get up to go to the toilet or suddenly wake up for no reason.
