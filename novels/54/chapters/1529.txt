Chapter 1530: Edward, I’m Back

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne pulled away from Edward’s lips and said, “Do you believe I’m back now?” Edward’s eyes became even redder, and he asked, “Why are you back?”

He believed her. However, he was trying to keep himself calm. Perhaps she had come back to take a look at him…

He really wanted to hug her, but he did not dare to.

“Edward, let’s have a good talk,” Jeanne said. Edward had been trying her best to hide his panic.

“What do you want to talk about?” Edward asked her.

“Back then, why did you choose to make me lose my memory?” Jeanne asked bluntly.

Edward remained silent. He did not know how to tell her that he was selfish and despicable.

“Do you not trust me that much?” Jeanne looked at how helpless he looked.

Who would have thought that the Leader of the Harken, a man who could build such a successful nation in such a short period of time, would be so careful and panicky when facing a woman?

If she really did leave and never came back, what would that man become?

“I never hated you,” Jeanne said bluntly.

She voiced her thoughts out in the open.

“Kingsley’s death has nothing to do with you. If he didn’t die, you would’ve died instead.”

Jeanne did not seem so sad about recalling the past anymore because she had seen Kingsley’s true happiness.

“And Kingsley will choose to let you live.”

She Imew that after Lucy died, Kingsley had never thought of staying alive.

“As for what happened after that, when you dealt with the Hills…” Jeanne looked at Edward.

Edward and Jeanne looked at each other.

“You didn’t leave any of them behind, did you?” Jeanne asked him.

She did not know if he killed them all.

“Not much,” Edward replied.

To be precise, he had killed everyone he could, and those he allowed to escape were not a threat to him.

Jeanne was still a little emotional when she heard it. That was probably the reason why it was difficult for them to be together. Too many lives had been sacrificed because of them, and it was very difficult to turn a blind eye to it. “In order to gain Alex’s trust, I couldn’t be soft-hearted,” Edward explained.

He had to explain to her why he did it.

After he had secretly sent Jeanne away, in order to further gain Alex’s trust, he personally dealt with the Hills. He Imew that when he massacred the Hills, it would be completely over between him and Jeanne; it would be worse than

when he killed Kingsley.

Kingsley’s death was inevitable, but the Hills’ demise was unnecessary. Therefore, he chose to make Jeanne lose her memory.

He hoped she could live without hatred and pain — that no harm would come between them and they could be together again. He could accept thousands of curses and go against his conscience. As long as he could be with her, he would do whatever it took.

In the end, God was fair, and not everything he wanted went his way. Now, Jeanne knew everything, including all his bad deeds.

“Kingsley once told me not to hate you and not to avenge him. He said that this was the inevitable result of the evolution of history,” Jeanne said in a low voice. Ultimately, she found it hard to accept how ruthless Edward was to the Hills.

“I’ve decided to listen to Kingsley.”

Jeanne looked at Edward. This time, she had made a decision for herself.

Edward, on the other hand, simply looked at Jeanne. Perhaps he did not believe what she had just said, that she would really compromise by letting go of her hatred for him and forgiving him.

“Actually…” Jeanne paused and said, “Have you read the diary I left for George?”

Edward was stunned, but he shook his head slowly. He did not look, or should he say that he did not dare to look. He held it in his hand a few times, but he put it down in the end.

“No wonder.” Jeanne suddenly understood why he did not believe her. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

If he had read it, he might just believe her.

Then, she said, “I’ll show it to you when I’m free.”

Edward looked straight at Jeanne, who said, “You smell like alcohol. Get up and take a shower. I’ll get Teddy to come in and tidy up the room.”

As Jeanne spoke, she was about to turn around and leave when someone suddenly grabbed her arm. Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

Only at that moment did Edward finally react and believe that she had returned to his side.

He asked, “Are you really back?”

Jeanne nodded.

“Jeanne,” Edward called out to her. His voice was very soft.

Jeanne pursed her lips tightly. She, too, was not as calm as she appeared to be when she came back.

“I love you,” Edward said.

There were so many things he wanted to say to her, but in the end, he only said three words.

Jeanne’s eyes reddened. As far as she could recall, she seemed to have never said those three words to Edward. Although he said he knew she loved him, did he know that now?

She turned around and looked at the tall Edward. Suddenly, she realized he looked fragile, like he would crumble with a touch.

Did he lose so much weight because he had been depressed for three days?

From the bottom of her heart, she said, “I’ve always loved you too.”

It was not “I love you too”, but “I’ve always loved you too.”

As soon as she said that, both of them burst into tears.

After so many years and so much blood feud, she still chose to be with him, as they did in the beginning..
