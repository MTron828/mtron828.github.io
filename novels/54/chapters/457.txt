Chapter 458: Sweet Shopping

Even though many times, all he could think about was Jeanne.

Whenever he thought about Jeanne under his fourth uncle, he wished he could cut Jeanne into a thousand pieces!

The woman was his first, yet he did not even get to touch a single finger of hers.

Hence, he vented his frustrations on Jasmine in bed and even became rougher. He did not take any precautions either.

Now, she was pregnant.

“I thought you’d be looking forward to it. Even when I received this report today, I was already thinking about how I should share this joy with you. When I heard the maid say you came back early, I was secretly delighted. I thought you and the baby had a telepathic connection,” said Jasmine. Her pitiful act was gone. Now, it was as if she was telling the truth.

That, on the contrary, made Eden less disgusted with Jasmine.

He said, “How big is it?”

“The doctor said two months,” answered Jasmine.

Eden chose to remain silent again.

In fact, he did not know how he felt about it either. He was happy, but at the thought that it was Jasmine’s child, he could bring himself to feel happy.

He no longer liked Jasmine, so naturally, he was not particularly excited about the child in Jasmine’s belly.

However, to say that he was not happy… After all, it was also his child.

......

Although the thought of being a father did not make him emotional, the child might be able to change his position in the Swans.

In any way, he felt a little conflicted.

Jasmine looked at Eden’s mood swings but did not see any hint of happiness. At that, she felt a chill in his heart.

It turned out that when a man could not like someone at the snap of a finger.

Yet, a woman would give everything she had!

She said, “Eden, are you excited about the child?”

Eden glanced at Jasmine.

He was feeling conflicted at first, but now, sarcasm was written all over his face. “Jasmine, don’t think that just because you’re pregnant with my child, you can rely on it. Let me tell you this. It’s your duty to give birth to my child. I married you just to let you carry on the family line. You should feel honored. Don’t you dare think you can use this to show off in front of me! I will not fall for this.”

“I know full well that you despise me for not being capable enough to help you with anything. I know that.”

Eden sneered.

At that moment, he could not be bothered to figure out Jasmine’s thoughts. He felt it would be a waste for him to spend even one more second on her.

However, Jasmine said, “If you’re not in a hurry to have a child, I can help you suppress Jeanne. I can even make your fourth uncle feel embarrassed!”

All of Eden’s anger stemmed from the fact that Jeanne was targeting him everywhere and that he had not given Jeanne what she deserved! On top of that, his fourth uncle was in charge of the entire Swan Enterprise, so he was still under someone’s control!

If she could help him, he would look at her in a different light. Then, he would feel that she was useful and get back together with her.

Her mother had told her that to achieve her goal, she had to do anything, whether it was to others or herself.

The more ruthless she was to herself, the more ruthless she could be to others.

She looked at Eden coldly, with disbelief in her eyes, and he also looked at her the same way as if he did not believe she could help him deal with Jeanne and his fourth uncle.

“I can make use of this child and let Jeanne bear the blame. Just like in the past, she will lose her reputation and be kicked out of the Swans!”

Eden’s eyes narrowed, and he just stared at Jasmine.

In the next second, he smiled sinisterly.

Very well. He must take revenge on Jeanne for everything that happened to him today! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

…

In South Hampton City’s International Shopping Mall.

Edward held Jeanne’s hand the entire time in front of so many people, which made Jeanne a little shy.

The point was that the two of them were really eye-catching, with Edward too handsome and she too beautiful.

When the two of them walked together, they caught many people’s attention. On top of their identities, they would attract even more attention if they were recognized.

Jeanne moved her hand, feeling a little uncomfortable.

Edward turned her head to look at her. “What’s wrong?”

“Don’t hold my hand. Many people are looking.” Jeanne gestured.

There really were many people around. The people who came and went were all looking in their direction.

However, when they felt Edward’s gaze, they abruptly retracted their gazes and left quickly.

Everyone knew that the Fourth Master Swan of South Hampton City should not be provoked.
