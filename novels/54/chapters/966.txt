967 Since You Refuse to Help Monica, I’ll Have To Do It, No?

In the chairman’s office in Cardellini Pharmaceutical, Jeanne’s words shocked Monica.

It was not that she still had any feelings for Michael, but Jeanne’s words made her a little overwhelmed.

What did it mean to be ruthless? Was she supposed to kill Michael?

She did not dare to do anything illegal.

Jeanne did not explain too much to her. “Monica, I only have one week with you. In this one week, you have to learn how to survive on the job. Do you understand?”

Monica quickly nodded.

Whenever Jeanne was in a serious mood, Monica would be like a little lamb.

Jeanne, on the other hand, did not waste any more time. At that point, what she had to do next was to show Monica what she meant.

“The quality inspection department said that the results will be out within a week, right?” Jeanne returned to the main topic.

“Yes,” Monica answered solemnly.

“And it’s been five days?”

“Yes,”

“In other words, it’s very likely that the results will be announced tomorrow or the day after.”

“My father said that there’s absolutely no problem with the quality of our vaccine and that the incident was caused by the child’s own autoimmune response. Once the results are out, Cardellini Enterprise’s reputation will be restored. When that time comes, we can look for the hospitals and drugs we’ve worked with before to discuss partnerships. It’s just that Sunny Pharmaceutical is really popular now–”

“Monica, you still don’t get it.” Jeanne interrupted her.

Monica blinked at Jeanne.

“Our focus now is not on whether Cardellini Enterprise will be cleared of suspicion after the results are out. Our focus is whether this result is what we want.”

“What do you mean?” Monica looked at Jeanne blankly.

“Do you think Michael will let Cardellini Enterprise go?”

“Are you saying Michael will do something? That’s impossible! The quality inspection department was is under the Sanders’ government. They wouldn’t do anything against their conscience, right? Moreover, Michael’s power can’t be so great that everyone in the quality inspection department has to listen to him!” Monica had never thought that someone would tamper with the results

“Nothing is impossible,” Jeanne answered

“Then, what should we do? What do we do now?” Monica began to panic. “If Michael can do that, once they announce to the public that there’s a problem with our vaccine, not only will our Cardellini Enterprise be gone, but my father will also be held responsible! I can’t let Michael succeed!”

“So now, we have to find a way to prove our innocence instead of relying on the quality inspection department.”

“However, the quality inspection department is the official authority. Once the results are out, we can’t convince the public otherwise.”

“No, there’s a way.” Jeanne enunciated each word.

Monica looked at Jeanne nervously. When she was at her wits ‘end, Jeanne would always know what to do.

“Has the child been cremated?”

“I didn’t ask.” Monica thought for a moment and said, ” it’s been so many days, so by right, it should have been cremated.

“Let’s ask first.”

“Alright.” Monica quickly picked up her phone and called Steve. “Mr. Warren, can you help me ask the family of the deceased child whether the child has been cremated?”

“Ms. Cardellini, why are you suddenly asking this?”

“It’ll be useful.” Monica did not know why either.

However, Jeanne’s instructions were definitely useful.

“Alright. I’ll ask them immediately and get back to you later.”

“Okay.”

Monica hung up the phone and then looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne also did not explain why to Monica either.

After waiting for two minutes, Steve called. “Ms. Cardellini, I heard that the other party couldn’t bear to part with the child, so they haven’t done anything to his body. But now, the child’s body has begun to show signs of decomposing even in the cooling board, so they had no choice but to choose to start the cremation at 5:10 p.m. this afternoon. The body has already been sent to the crematorium.”

Monica responded in acknowledgment before passing the news to Jeanne.

Jeanne looked at the time on her watch and dragged Monica away. “There’s still 20 minutes.”

“To do what?” Monica was dumbfounded.

“We’re going to stop them.”

“I’m afraid that’s not a good idea, Jeannie.” However, Jeanne had already dragged Monica away.

For some reason, Monica got into the car that Jeanne was driving.

The car was hers, but Jeanne was the one driving.

It was going so fast that Monica did not dare to remove her hand that was on the car window’s handrail. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

‘Jeanne’s skills are… How many tickets would she get?’ Monica thought.

Jeanne took ten minutes to get to the crematorium, which would have taken at least half an hour.
