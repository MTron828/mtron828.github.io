1286 Candice’s Identity Revealed

“Don’t you like it?” Edward asked.

There was clearly a hint of pampering.

Candice frowned.

She felt that she had heard those familiar words somewhere before.

She forced herself to calm down and smiled elegantly. “Chief, you’ve misunderstood. It’s not that I don’t like it. I just heard that this jade bracelet was left behind by your ex-wife, so I wanted to bid for it and return it to you. I was extremely touched that you could attend the charity banquet personally and even donate a charity auction item, so I wanted to use this auction item to thank you.”

Edward retracted his hand silently.

There was no awkwardness.

He just looked at how Candice had indifferently and skillfully rejected his gift.

He said, “Okay.”

It was the same indifferent response again.

Candice merely smiled. She did not know if it was an illusion, but she felt that the Edward in front of her was looking at her strangely.

It felt as if there were a mix of emotions behind his gaze while it seemed like there was nothing at all.

He turned around. “Go back and prepare well for our wedding next month. I’ll announce the wedding date to the public tomorrow.”

“…Alright.” Candice nodded.

Edward left.

With a cold and strong aura, he disappeared from Candice’s sight.

She just watched as he drove away.

At that moment, he could not help but sigh heavily.

After recuperating overseas for so many years, she did come back this time to get married.

Actually, she had a long stretch of memory that was blurry.

It was just that she could not remember many things.

When she opened her eyes, she was faced with an unfamiliar environment and a stranger. Then, she learned all about her past from the words of others.

She was Candice Nicholson.

She was the daughter of Minister Wyatt Nicholson.

She grew up in the army with her father and had received many honors since she was young. She had become the pride of her father and family. However, she did not expect that in an aerial act, she would crash in order to complete a difficult maneuver.

After the crash, she had been in a coma. She was treated domestically and overseas. Later, she lay in bed for many years. At one point, she was declared as someone in a vegetative state. However, a year ago, she woke up unexpectedly and lost all her memories. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She underwent rehabilitation treatment abroad and recovered surprisingly quickly.

She even wondered if she had crashed a fake plane.

After all, she did not lose an arm or a leg.

It was just that after waking up, she was very weak.

However, this weakness was short-lived. Not long after, she almost returned to being a normal person.

During the recovery process, her father, Wyatt Nicholson, would take time out of his busy schedule to travel across the Pacific Ocean to visit her. If he had a longer time off, then he could accompany her for two days. If shorter, then he could only accompany her for two hours. She should have been very touched by his pampering, but for some reason, she could not seem to understand the feelings between blood ties. She even felt that she was a little too cold-blooded. Of course, she was not completely indifferent. Sometimes, when she saw her father dozing off when he was accompanying her, her heart would still ache.

Moreover, as she woke up for a longer period of time and her father spent more and more time with her, her feelings for her father deepened bit by bit.

Just like that, one day…

Her father was silent for a long time in her ward.

He had not uttered a word for a long while, as if something was on his mind.

This was very unusual because every time he came, he would be as warm as the spring breeze replacing the winter chill to her.

Every time, she would think about how outstanding she must have been when she was young to make her father dote on her to this extent.

She also had an inexplicable urge to make herself shine again.

“Candice.” Her father called her name solemnly.

“Just tell me what you have on your mind, Dad,” she said with a small smile.

She really felt that she could accept anything.

She felt that she had experienced many earth-shattering things in her life. In fact, she could not remember anything, but she felt that she could accept any blow.

“The Chief of Harken, Edward, said he wants to marry you.” Wyatt sighed.

For real?

At that moment, Candice was shocked beyond belief.

She had thought about many things. For example, her father had been fired, and her father might even face jail time for embezzlement, bribery, and abuse of power. She had never thought that he would actually let her get married.
