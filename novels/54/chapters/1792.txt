She wished she could suck his blood dry for laughing at her.

Finn, however, did not even push Monica away. After all, he could not feel any pain, but he felt an instinctive reaction in his body. Hence, he hugged Monica with both hands and lifted her up forcefully.

Startled, Monica quickly let go of Finn’s neck and hugged him tightly.

“Finn, what are you doing?” Monica shouted.

Finn placed her on a glass cabinet in the closet where he kept his ties, her jewelry, and other accessories. Then, he pressed her against the glass cabinet. The two of them were very close to each other, and they could feel each other’s breaths.

‘F*ck!’ Monica cursed to herself in anger. She could not believe Finn was still in the mood to think about such things.

“Don’t come near me. I’m leaving soon. I have to go pick up Shelly.” “Didn’t you say just now that the chauffeur would pick her up?” “I told the driver to pick me up and then pick her up.”

“Be good. The chauffeur will pick her up.”

“Finn!” Monica resisted.

However, Finn had already picked up the phone and dialed a number. He gave the chauffeur a few instructions and put the phone aside.

He said, “The chauffeur will go to pick up Shelly and then come back to pick you up. The timing should be just right.”

“Just right my *ss… Mmph.” Monica’s mouth was sealed tight by Finn’s kiss that she could not speak

She wished that sc*mbag would not be so horny all the time, and the least he could do was take her to the bed!

In the end, the already messy room became even more messy. By the time Monica took a shower and got changed, Shelly was already waiting for her in the car. Seeing that, she cursed Finn for sleeping with her during the day. Even her walking looked a little unstable.

She got into the car and apologized, “Sorry, I’m a little late.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When she apologized to Shelly, she could not help but secretly curse Finn again for being a beast.

“It’s okay. It’s still early anyway, and tomorrow is Saturday. Bella doesn’t have to go to school, so it doesn’t matter that you’re late.” Shelly smiled and said nicely.

“Sigh, my babies wanted some milk before I left.” Monica was still finding excuses for herself.

Shelly nodded and did not expose to Monica the obvious hickey on her neck. Moreover, it looked fresh. Of course, Monica did not notice it herself and told the driver her destination.

Shelly frowned. “Are we going that far? The seaside?”

“There’s a great restaurant on a cruise ship over there. I haven’t eaten there in a long time.” Monica mentioned a reason that she had thought of in advance. “I don’t get to go out often, so of course, I have to take the opportunity to eat what I want to eat the most.”

Shelly did not doubt him.

Monica was afraid that she would be exposed if she lied, so she quickly changed the topic to Bella.

“Bella, I will take you on a cruise ship, okay?”

“What’s a cruise ship?” Bella asked innocently.

“A cruise ship is a very, very big ship that can go out to sea.”

“Alright.” When Bella heard that it was a cruise ride, she immediately became excited.

“There’s a lot of good food on the ship too. Bella, do you want to go?”

“I do!” Bella said excitedly.

Monica stroked Bella’s little head. She did not know if it was because she was a mother, but she seemed to be more patient with children. On top of that, Bella was truly adorable, unlike Paige, who was as obedient and beautiful as a doll that had walked out of a two-dimensional world. Bella was sensible and obedient, just like Shelly, which made it easier for people to take a liking to her.

Amidst the rather pleasant conversation, they finally arrived at the cruise that Monica mentioned after driving for more than an hour. It was a huge cruise ship. Shelly did not even need to think to know how expensive it would be to eat there.

Under the guidance of the staff, they boarded the boat together, and Jeanne was already waiting for them on the boat. She was standing on the broad deck, watching the sun setting on the sea, and the breeze ruffled her hair.

Shelly could not help but exclaim, “The Leader’s wife is really beautiful.”

Shelly also thought she looked a little different from her usual self. Her appearance seemed a little familiar, as if she had seen her somewhere before.

Monica usually did not pay much attention to Jeanne, but when she saw Jeanne today, she also thought Jeanne’s appearance had changed a little. However, she could not tell what had changed other than the fact that Jeanne was becoming more beautiful by the day. In fact, everyone was getting prettier, except for her, who was getting uglier.

Monica called out to Jeanne unhappily, “We’re here..”
