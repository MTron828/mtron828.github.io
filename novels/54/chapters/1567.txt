Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica did not know why she was always threatened by Finn. She gritted her teeth and picked up her utensils to eat again. The moment she lowered her head, Finn smiled brightly.

At 12:30 p.m., the group gathered at the entrance of the hotel and departed for the scenic area. There was no traffic jam this time, so according to the schedule, they had lunch and then explored the area.

The other company hired a special tour guide, and the tour guide explained everything vividly. He made the originally boring historical sites less boring.

However, because Wendy had been here many times and received many important clients, she still felt a little bored after listening to it again. Hence, she placed all his attention on the others.

She looked at Finn, whose gaze was fixed on Director Cardellini the entire time. When Director Cardellini smiled, he would smile too; when she frowned, he would frown too. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She had never thought about it in a different way before as she thought that a secretary’s job was to take care of his boss. However, at that moment, her heart suddenly skipped a beat. The way Finn looked at Monica was definitely not the way a subordinate looked at a superior.

When she thought about how Finn had rejected her proposal of a one-night stand, she was even more certain that Finn and Monica had a close relationship. After all, according to common sense, Finn was alone in a foreign country. Unless his girlfriend was right beside him, he did not need to feel so responsible for his girlfriend.

Once Wendy understood what was going on, she was shocked. She could not believe she had tried to seduce Finn, who was Director Cardellini’s man!

Gosh. She suddenly felt that she had violated a workplace taboo. If she pursued the matter, would she not lose her status as a secretary?

The more she thought about it, the more panicked she became. How could she be so bold to seduce anyone’s man?

Looking at how handsome Finn was, she felt that he was a perfect match for Director Cardellini.

“Ms. Hansen,” Finn suddenly called out to her.

Wendy jumped in shock. She quickly snapped back to reality and looked at Finn. “What’s the matter?”

When she looked at him, she was a little wary. “How long does it usually take?” Finn asked.

“Oh, it usually takes about an hour or so.”

Finn nodded. He wondered whether Monica would be very tired after an hour. “If you’re tired, you can get the tour guide to take a break, and we can take it slow, ” Wendy hurriedly said.

“No need. Let’s see how it goes.” What he meant was that he wanted to see Monica’s condition first.

Wendy believed that something was going on between Finn and Director Cardellini, but she tried her best to remain calm.

After visiting the famous historical sites, they sat down at a stone table with a good view to rest.

“Director Cardellini, do you want some water?” the person in charge asked. Monica did feel a little thirsty, so she nodded. “Sorry for the trouble.”

The person in charge of the other party quickly said to Wendy, “Go get some mineral water.”

“Let me help you.” Finn volunteered himself.

“Thank you, Mr. Jones.” The person in charge was very polite.

With that, Finn left with Wendy.

Monica glanced at them a few times before she turned around with no visible emotion on her face. Seeing that Finn did not seem to know how to woo a woman, Brandon smirked. It served Finn right that Monica did not forgive him.

The few of them waited on the stone table for a while before Finn and Wendy returned with some mineral water.

Monica pursed her lips, whereas Brandon, who listened from the side, felt a little upset.

Thus, Finn went with Wendy to buy water just so that he could get Monica warm water to drink, yet he was mocking Finn for not avoiding suspicion. Now, he was slapped in the face by the man.

It was obvious that small actions like that were the easiest to touch a woman’s heart.

“Mr. Jones is really attentive to Director Cardellini.” The person in charge could not help but praise Finn.

Wendy quickly agreed. “That’s right. Because the water had just been boiled, Mr. Jones was afraid that it would burn Director Cardellini, so he made sure to cool it for a long time before bringing it over..”
