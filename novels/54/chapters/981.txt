982 Finn Is Not Good Enough For Monica

She had always felt that as long as she worked hard, three months would be enough for her to woo Finn.

However, she suddenly felt that she might not be able to do it even if she was given three or 30 years.

Despite that, she refused to believe that Finn really had no feelings for her.

“It pains me if I don’t like you,” Finn said as he stood up from his desk.

Sarah looked at his cold figure, and her heart ached.

Before Finn left, he even said, “Us pretending to be a couple ends here…”

“No!” Sarah grabbed Finn.

Finn’s eyes flickered.

“We agreed on three months. Why are you ending it after just a few days?” Sarah said fiercely, “Finn, you can’t be so cruel to me!”

“The longer we wait, the crueler it’ll be!” Finn enunciated each word.

Sarah looked at him with tears in her eyes.

How could Finn be so heartless and cold-blooded?

However, she could not see any change in his expression.

Did Finn even have a heart?

“In that case, how are you going to explain to my parents and the people you’re trying to lie to?” Sarah asked him, trying her best to calm herself down.

Finn pursed his lips tightly and remained silent.

“It’s only three months. What are you afraid of?” Sarah said sarcastically, “Are you really afraid of falling in love with me?”

“I won’t,” Finn said firmly.

“Since you won’t, what’re three more months? Three months later, as long as you have no feelings for me, I swear you don’t have to chase me away. I’ll get lost myself!”

“I don’t want to have any emotional burden.”

“I’m willing to do this. I don’t need you to bear any feelings for me, nor do I need you to give me anything. I just need three months to give up on you completely.” Sarah was trying her best to persuade Finn.

Finn hesitated for a few seconds.

“Do you want me to continue to pester you like this or do you want me to leave willingly after three months?”

“Sarah, don’t have any hope in me.” Finn left after saying that.

That meant he had agreed to her request, but he also reminded her that he would never fall in love with her.

Sarah’s heart ached.

In fact, she even felt bad for her cousin at that moment.

She knew very well that her cousin and Finn did not have a good relationship, and she used to think that they did not love each other. However, it was only later that she found out that her cousin loved him very much.

It was because she loved him that she always gave herself hope and waited for him for many years!

Considering all that, how did her cousin survive all those years?

Just how did she, until this day, endure Finn’s cold-blooded and heartlessness for so many days and nights?

Sarah suddenly felt that after being treated so heartlessly by Finn, she had to put in more effort in the next three months!

In fact, three months was not Finn’s limit. On the contrary, it was challenging her own limits!

She kept her emotions in check and picked up her phone to make a call. “Cousin.”

“Yes.” At that moment, Monica was driving to the hospital with the clothes she was going to wear tomorrow.

“Finn has agreed. I’ll be with him tonight,” Sarah said.

Monica’s grip on the steering wheel tightened, and her heart tugged unexpectedly. Then, her vision blurred.

However, it suddenly became clear again.

She said, “Alright. Congratulations. You’re finally becoming an adult.”

“Don’t you feel uncomfortable about it?” Sarah asked Monica

“I really don’t want to get emotional with you. After all, I’ve always felt like you were deliberately snatching my parents’ love from me since I was young. However, you’re still my sister. If you’re happy, I’ll give you my sincere blessings,” Monica said sincerely, and her tone was light.

“I don’t think Finn is good enough for you,” Sarah suddenly said.

She really felt that in terms of romantic relationships, Finn was not good enough for Monica.

“Finn and I are in the past, and whatever that’s in the past is no longer important. I just want you and Finn to be happy. However, don’t blame me for not reminding you that Finn really isn’t a traditionally good man. He doesn’t know how to love others, or rather, he doesn’t know how to show it. It takes him relatively slow to warm up to people, and he doesn’t seem to be very interested in many things. Anyway, you have to be mentally prepared. That’s all the advice I can give you.”

“Monica, I just can’t accept it,” Sarah said.

“What?” Monica was puzzled.

She did not quite understand what Sarah was saying.

“Just wait until I give up!” Sarah said fiercely.

Right. She had to give up. However, she could not accept the fact that she could not move the man.

She had always thought that if her cousin could do it, so could she!

“We really are related. We won’t give up until we’ve been proven otherwise.” Monica smiled faintly.

At that moment, she felt blessed.

Finn was indeed not a good man. However, once he genuinely accepted someone, he would slowly change.

Now that Finn had agreed to sleep with Sarah, it meant that he had accepted her and that he might change for her.

Of course, Monica did not have much hope for Finn. It was just that…

Back when they were still dating, although Finn did not take the initiative, he would accept anything she said as long as it did not go against his principles, such as kissing or having sex.

It made her think that if Sarah loved Finn as much as she did, Finn’s non-rejection was a good thing for them.

As long as they were happy, she would sincerely wish them well.

She parked the car in the hospital’s parking garage, and the moment she walked toward the elevator, she saw Finn coming out of the elevator.

However, she did not see Sarah, which surprised her.

Just as she was about to ask something, Finn walked past her.

All she could feel from Finn now was his cold aura and his rejection of her.

Monica forced herself to smile.

In fact, she was deliberately acting to hide her emotions. Perhaps if she was a little colder, she could truly let go of their relationship. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

She walked into the elevator and went to her father’s ward.

The moment she entered, she patted her face before she forced a smile on her face.

Only now did she realize that being an adult was so difficult.
