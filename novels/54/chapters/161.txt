Jeanne hung up on Kingsley.

It had been a long time since they had argued like this.

To be exact, it had been a long time since Kingsley had spoken to her in such a stern tone.

She looked a little grim.

George sat in front of the computer and turned to look at her. “Did you have a fight with Kingsley?”

Jeanne calmed herself down.

She did not want to lose her temper in front of her son.

Jeanne responded, “We had some disagreements at work.”

“Actually, Kingsley is quite good to us.” It was rare for George to put in a good word for someone.

Kingsley often fawned over George, who would roll his eyes at him, but he was also important to George.

“I know.” Jeanne forced a smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t sever my relationship with him.”

“Okay.” George nodded.

“I’ll take a nap.”

“Okay. I’ll get back to work.”

Jeanne closed her eyes and lay on the bed.

Kingsley’s stern voice lingered in her mind.

‘The matters with Fourth Master Swan end here.’

Jeanne somehow felt a stabbing pain in her heart.

She pursed her lips and ignored it.

Jeanne ignored... The throb.

The next day.

Jeanne brought Klaus to the administration office’s planning department. They had an on-site discussion and designed the local traffic of the logistics warehouse and amusement park with the people from the planning department. In fact, before Klaus came to South Hampton City, he already had a preliminary plan, so everything was finalized very quickly. The local traffic blueprint was completed and announced to the public in just three days.

In order to express their support for the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse, the administration office immediately launched a tender for its construction. It was expected to open up at the same time as the project of the amusement park in a month’s time.

Such a series of actions were very popular among the people.

Thus, the incident of the Lawrences’ logistics warehouse, which caused a lot of buzz, came to an end.

The logistics warehouse was now being built in full swing according to the original plan.

Naturally, the Lawrences’ e-commerce project was also going smoothly.

Not only that, but the Lawrences also announced to the public that they would use the popularity of the amusement park to build the largest electrical appliance mall in South Hampton City in the location of the logistics warehouse. The warehouse, which was originally planned to have three stories, would be expanded to six stories. The three floors above were to realize the Lawrences’ original vision of building the largest offline electronics store, which they dared not do due to the decline of the offline economy. Taking advantage of the number of people in the amusement park this time, the Lawrences wanted to rebuild it. In order to attract more people from the amusement park, they would open the largest children’s electronic amusement park in South Hampton City.

A series of god-like operations were carried out.

This allowed the Lawrences to benefit from the logistics warehouse incident.

Not only was the online project perfectly solved, but the offline economy was also boosted.

This time, the Lawrences really took advantage of it.

It was so much so that Alexander could strut around in their high-level meeting.

Jeanne appeared to be calm.

“This time, Jeanne displayed amazing ability in the logistics warehouse incident. She was able to see the business opportunity and seized it to build an offline electrical appliance city. I give her the highest recognition and praise. I hope that everyone here can learn more from Jeanne. Think more, develop your own thinking, and avoid sticking to the rules.” Alexander stood from the perspective of a great man and positioned himself in a very high position.

The atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

Everyone could sense Alexander’s self-satisfaction.

Most of the people in the room had previously scoffed at Alexander.

At this moment, they felt that he was being “petty”, so not many people agreed with him.

Alexander did not care. He turned to Bryce and said, “Director Hoffman, are you satisfied with the outcome of the project?”

Bryce’s expression was a little ugly.

He could naturally sense Alexander’s sarcasm.

When the project was ruined, he reacted the most fiercely.

This time, he was being picked on by Alexander.

Bryce said, “This brings so many economic benefits to the Lawrences. Can I say that I’m not satisfied?”

“I remember someone saying something like, ‘it’s either her or me’.” Alexander deliberately brought up the past.

Bryce’s expression changed abruptly.

“Of course, I don’t think you’re really going to keep that promise, Director Hoffman. Words in anger shouldn’t be taken to heart. I’m just saying this to remind you and the other high-level leaders to be careful when speaking. Otherwise, it’s easy to be slapped in the face!” Alexander was so blunt that he did not show Bryce any respect.
