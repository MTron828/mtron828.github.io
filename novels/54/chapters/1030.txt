1031 Becoming Vengeful

Monica was busy for the entire day.

When Monica left the conference room and returned to her office, it was already 11 p.m. at night.

She leaned back in her office chair, feeling exhausted.

Hence, she also told Tim to make her a cup of black coffee, mainly to refresh her mind. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

She took a few sips, but it was still so bitter that she frowned. However, she forced herself to drink it.

After drinking it, she picked up her phone and made a call.

“Monica?” Nox frowned, probably not expecting Monica to call him.

“Can you do me a favor?” Monica asked.

“Don’t tell me you want to borrow some money,” Nox said bluntly.

Monica pursed her lips. She was quite short of money now.

“No, I don’t have money,” Nox refused.

Regarding Monica’s past with Finn, he was 100 percent on Finn’s side, so he had a deep prejudice against Monica.

“No.” In the end, Monica still felt a little upset. However, she knew very well that in the business world or on any occasion, talking about money would hurt one’s relationship.

She had never thought of letting anyone foot the bill for what her family was going through.

Then, she told Nox the reason she was looking for him, “Recently, more than ten core researchers from Cardellini Enterprise have jumped ship, and I suspect that Sunny Pharmaceutical has given them some benefits. I don’t mean anything else, but I just want your help to find out what benefits they’ve gotten. I want to expose them.”

“Even if they’re exposed, it can’t save Cardellini Enterprise from its current predicament.

“I know.” Monica’s eyes turned cold. “I just want to teach these people a lesson and at least let these people know the consequences of betraying Cardellini Pharmaceutical. I want to destroy their career for the rest of their lives!”

There was a few seconds of silence on the other end before Nox said slowly, “Monica, you’ve changed.”

Monica tightened her grip on her phone.

“When did you become so vengeful?!”

“From the moment I was tricked by Michael.” Monica replied, “I used to think that kindness would always be rewarded and that if I don’t harm others, others won’t harm me. Only when Michael pushed me to this extent did I realize that kindness is useless and that I’m terrifyingly stupid!”

Nox frowned.

“If it’s inconvenient, forget it.” Monica did not insist.

She could not deny that she was doing this to satisfy her inner vengeance. Hence, if Nox was unwilling to help her, she would not force him.

Just as she was about to hang up the phone, Nox said, “I’m not helping you. I’m just doing this for your father’s sake. I heard your father’s surgery failed. Since he used to treat me well, I’ll help you this once for your father’s sake.”

“Thank you.” Monica thanked him.

Without wasting her breath, Monica put down her phone.

Then, she immediately left the company, and when she drove to the hospital, it was already past midnight.

Before she went back to the ward, she went to her father’s intensive care unit first.

She thought to herself that not many miracles would happen in this world. Hence, she stayed for about ten minutes before leaving.

She did not even have the time to be sad now.

Back in the ward, her mother had already fallen asleep, and her uncle was making do on the sofa.

Monica went over and called out to Ron softly. “Uncle, you should go home and sleep.”

Ron opened his eyes and looked around. He was still in a daze.

After a long while, he whispered, “Monica, are you off work?”

“Yes, uncle, go back and rest. You can’t get good sleep on the sofa. Just come back tomorrow.”

“Alright.” Ron did not refuse.

After all, he was not used to sleeping on the sofa.

“In that case, I’ll come over tomorrow morning.”

“I’ll leave at 8:30, so you can come back then.”

Ron nodded.

Monica walked him to the hospital’s elevator. “Uncle, drive safely. It’s late.”

“I know. You should go back and rest. It’s getting late. Go to bed early and don’t tire yourself out.

“Alright.” Monica smiled.

Once Ron left, Monica returned to the ward.

However, she had just taken two steps when she saw Finn, dressed in casual clothes and seemingly planning to leave the hospital.

Monica walked past Finn.

Finn stopped in his tracks, and by the time he turned around, he saw that Monica had already walked into the ward.

Finn looked away and left the hospital.

The next day, Monica had breakfast with her mother.
