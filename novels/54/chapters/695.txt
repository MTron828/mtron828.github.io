Chapter 696: Letting Go: Sorry I Made You Feel Disgusted

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She just watched as Finn slowly let go of Sarah and held Sarah’s hand.

Just as he was about to leave, Monica called out to him, “Finn.”

Finn stopped in his tracks.

“I give up,” Monica said seriously.

However, Finn did not turn around.

“You win. I won’t look for you again,” Monica said as she stared at his back.

From now on, she would only see his back.

“I’m sorry for making you feel disgusted last night,” Monica said calmly.

It was her fault last night. It was she who arrogantly helped him.

She did not change into her clothes. She was not even afraid of death, so why would she care about her image?

Finn held onto Sarah’s hand and stood at the door without leaving.

However, Monica walked past them both and left.

Shelly had been by Sarah’s side the entire time.

She stayed with Sarah because she was afraid that Sarah would do something stupid, but she did not expect to witness such a shocking scene.

She had always thought that Finn liked Monica, so Monica should be the one to help him with such matters.

Was she wrong?

She hurriedly caught up with Monica and followed her into the elevator, where she saw the latter’s tears overflowing.

In a place that Finn could not see, Monica was crying her heart out.

When the elevator arrived on the first floor, Monica walked out.

Since it was the afternoon, many people were coming and going to the hotel, and many people saw Monica in her bathrobe.

Shelly gritted her teeth. She took off her coat and handed it to Monica. “Monica.”

Monica turned to look at Shelly and did not take her coat.

However, Shelly put it on Monica’s body.

Monica smiled with a face full of tears.

Outsiders must think she was very miserable, right?

“I’m Shelly. I was the one who called you last night. I–”

“Don’t do whatever I did in the future,” Monica suddenly interrupted her.

What Monica said stunned Shelly.

“Don’t let go of the person you like. If you let them go, you’ll never be able to find them again. Also, don’t like someone who has given up on you. It’s useless even if you like them,” Monica said. “You’re Nox’s child bride, right?”

Shelly was surprised.

She had seen Monica before at the Winters’ banquets, but she always thought that people at those banquets would never notice her.

“It’s best not to fall in love so easily,” Monica said. “It’ll ruin your life.”

After that, Monica walked out of the hotel lobby.

She just watched as Monica put on her coat, got into a car outside the door, and left.

Monica must have been very hurt to say that love would ruin one’s life.

Once one fell in love, they would be ruined for life.

Fortunately, she did not love him.

Then, her eyes moved as she saw a hurried figure run past her.

…

Monica returned to her own neighborhood.

The entire journey, the driver was trembling with fear.

He did not know what had happened that would make the passengers behind him cry so hard like the sky was going to fall.

Fortunately, they were finally at their destination.

Monica thanked him with tears flowing down her face and got off the car.

At the entrance of the neighborhood, the autumn sun was shining brightly, and Monica saw Michael.

He had been standing there the whole time as if he was waiting for her.

Suddenly, Monica smiled. Only one person had been waiting for her the entire time, but she was too stubborn to notice.

She walked toward Michael, who saw her but did not take the initiative to approach her.

He seemed to have noticed her strange behavior, so he did not dare to approach her until he felt her suddenly jump into his arms.

Michael’s tensed body exploded, but he also tried to calm himself down.

“Michael, I give up,” Monica said.

She really gave up on Finn, and it was a mistake between them from the start.

Was it just because she did not trust him? At the end of the day, it was because they did not trust each other that gave rise to all their sadness.

That was why she had decided to let Finn but also herself go.

“Monica, last night... It didn’t work out?” Michael asked worriedly.

Monica shook her head.

That was not it. It was because it did work out that she could see so clearly that it was impossible for her and Finn to be together again.

“Monica.” Michael looked heartbroken.

He turned around and hugged Monica in his arms.

He said, “No matter what you’ve experienced, I will always be by your side. I will never leave you.”

At that, Monica burst into tears. She really regretted liking Finn now.

She should... cherish the person in front of her.

The two of them hugged each other tightly.

Not far away from them, a taxi stopped.

The scene in front of them was deeply moving. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It turned out that every time he left her, she would quickly go to another man.

Was it because they were not fated to be together? Or was it because their relationship was not deep, to begin with?

Or... was it because they did not love each other enough?

It was probably because they did not love each other enough. It was the same for him and her.

“Sir, we’re here,” the driver in the front reminded him.

Finn retracted her gaze.

He said, “Let’s go.”

“Where are we going?”

Anywhere was fine, as long as... there was no Monica.

As the taxi left, the man holding Monica looked coldly in the direction of the taxi.

He had endured the most painful night of his life last night.

From today onward, no one could bring him or Monica any more pain!
