“I wonder who he’s waiting for?”

“I wonder who’s so lucky.”

“Oh! Don’t you guys think he looks like an overbearing CEO who has been abandoned by his petite wife?”

“You read too many novels.”

That was right.

He was... abandoned!

…

After Jeanne left Fourth Master Swan, she went straight to the children’s area. There, she picked George up and dashed out.

George was, in fact, not heavy, so Jeanne could also carry him easily and leave as fast as she could.

“Where’s the Fourth Master?” George was a little puzzled.

Jeanne seemed to have paused for a moment before saying, “We’ll leave first. We’ll leave to South Hampton City now.”

“Oh.” Seemingly having understood something, George lay quietly in Jeanne’s embrace.

They quickly left the amusement park in a taxi and went straight to the airport.

......

As soon as they got in the car, Jeanne dialed Miles’ number.

She said, “Bring Nox to the airport. We’re leaving right now.”

“Right now?”

“Yes. Right now.”

Jeanne put down the phone.

The moment she put it down, she took out another phone, which belonged to Fourth Master Swan.

In reality, she had it all planned out.

The reason she wanted to go to the haunted house was to take the Fourth Master Swan’s phone from him without alarming him.

Therefore, even though she was scared out of her wits, she had another motive for approaching him.

In such a dark place and in such a tense atmosphere, getting her way was very easy.

Once she got the phone, she could guarantee that at least Fourth Master Swan would not have time to inform others to look for her when she left. Besides, she had observed that the driver really did leave and that no one was following them. Although the amusement park was not far from the airport, the next flight was in an hour, and time was tight. Leaving would be a very difficult task.

She maintained her calm but did not dare to relax. After all, she did not know if something would happen midway.

That was because she never knew the limit to Fourth Master Swan’s ability.

It did not take long before the taxi arrived at the airport.

Jeanne held George’s hand and rushed in.

In the huge airport, she dialed Miles’ number while she went to buy a ticket.

She waited at the airport ticket counter for a few minutes when Miles walked over with Nox.

Their hands were handcuffed together and covered by a coat, so they looked like a pair of comrades holding hands.

Some people could not help but take a few more glances at them, thinking who wore the pants in the relationship.

When Nox saw Jeanne, he was a little surprised. “Isn’t there one more day left?!”

By then, Jeanne had gotten Miles to buy the plane ticket with his passport.

She answered nonchalantly, “You still want to be held hostage for one more day, huh?”

“Did Fourth Master Swan let you go early?” It did not make sense to him.

Fourth Master Swan did not seem like the kind of person who would give up halfway.

However, Jeanne did not answer him.

She quickly settled the plane tickets and led George to the security check.

Since they were flying business class, the security check was not packed with people.

That was when Jeanne said to Miles, “Let him go. We’re going in.”

Miles took out the key and unlocked the handcuffs on their wrists.

Nox rolled his wrist around unconsciously.

Having been held hostage by that guy for six days was simply his greatest humiliation. The next time he met that guy, he would definitely kill him!

Nox was still secretly displeased until he saw that Jeanne and the others had already walked in.

They really did just turn around and leave.

No matter what, they had somewhat of a revolutionary friendship. How could they leave without saying goodbye?

Jeanne was really too cold-blooded.

At that thought, Nox turned around and was about to leave. However, he could not help but sigh.

It was a pity that he had sacrificed so much, yet Fourth Master Swan still could not keep Jeanne by his side.

“Nox.” Behind him, Jeanne’s voice suddenly sounded.

Nox hurriedly turned his head to see Jeanne striding toward him.

What?

She could not bear to leave, huh?

She did not want to leave, huh?

He looked at Jeanne arrogantly as she walked to him and handed him a black phone.

Nox frowned.

“This is Fourth Master Swan’s. Please pass it to him.”

“Why is his phone with you?” Nox was surprised.

However, Jeanne did not reply to him. Instead, she turned around and was about to leave.

“Jeanne.” Nox stopped her. “You didn’t steal it, did you?”

“I did.” Jeanne nodded, to which Nox frowned even more.

“So, please pass it to him for me.”

“You really did everything you could to stop him from coming after you.” Nox was not stupid and could immediately figure it all out.

Again, Jeanne did not reply to him.

“Doesn’t it hurt you to scheme against someone you like?” Nox was a little angry, and it was really hard for him to conceal his anger.
