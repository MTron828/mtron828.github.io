Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, when she realized what was going on, she pushed Nox away. As soon as she pushed him away, the oats in her hand spilled all over the bed.

Silence suddenly filled the room, and no one spoke. It was as if they were avoiding talking about something.

In the end, Nox opened his mouth and said, “Do you understand now?”

Shelly pursed her lips tightly. She felt that Nox was sick in the head to be toying with her like that. Was she really that fun to toy around with?

She looked at Nox and said word by word, “I don’t know why you’re suddenly behaving like this. Regardless of whether you’re toying with me on purpose, I’m serious when I say I’ll never be with you again in my life! To be precise, there is no way I’ll be with you. After all, we’ve never been together before, so we can’t get back together.”

Nox’s expression changed. It was filled with anger and sadness.

In any case, Shelly did not care. Nox meant nothing to her as a person, so she would not be affected by any of his emotions.

“I’ll help you with the discharge procedures.” With that, she planned to leave.

However, Nox suddenly grabbed her hand, and Shelly tried but could not shake him off. Hence, she could only turn around and look at Nox coldly.

“I told you, I’m not joking,” Nox said coldly.

“I also told you that no matter what your motive is, I will not be with you again.”

“Shelly, you better know what you’re talking about!” “I know what I’m talking about!”

“Do you know what it means for you to reject me?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“It doesn’t mean anything.” Shelly was cold and even a little sarcastic. “I don’t care about anything you have.”

“Shelly!” Nox gritted his teeth.

“If you understand what I just said, let go of me.” Shelly said, “I’m going to handle the discharge procedures.” “What’s so good about Benjamin?” Nox asked.

Shelly frowned.

“I’m asking you, what’s so good about Benjamin?!” Nox raised his voice.

His emotions were getting erratic, and according to Shelly’s experience, that was the precursor to his outbursts.

“My rejection of you has nothing to do with Benjamin.” Shelly gritted her teeth.

She seemed used to dealing with Nox face-to-face.

“Nothing to do with him?” Nox sneered, and his smile looked a little despondent.

“Can you say you don’t like him?” Nox asked.

Shelly really thought Nox was crazy.

“Answer me!” Nox’s voice grew louder.

He unconsciously tightened his grip on Shelly’s arm.

In pain, Shelly gritted her teeth and said, “Yes, I like Benjamin.”

She admitted that she liked Benjamin. In fact, she had liked him since high school, but she did not dare to show her feelings for him, so she chose to suppress them.

Then, when they met later again in life, she also told herself not to like him.

However, the more she told herself not to like him, the more she liked him. Especially when compared to Nox, she realized Benjamin was the best man in the world, and Nox was sc*mbag!

“Heh.” Nox laughed.

Even though he had expected to hear that answer, when he heard her say it out loud, his heart ached. It was so painful that he could not even breathe, and he had to hide it with a smile.

Shelly looked indifferently at Nox’s smile, which looked a little scary.

“So, what’s so good about him?” Nox calmly asked her the same question again.

“Everything about him is good!” Shelly said bluntly.

“What’s so good about him?!” Nox roared.

Shelly’s voice was also a little loud. “He’s gentle, considerate, and kind. He also knows how to cook, do the laundry, and take care of children! He’s the best man in the world!”

Nox looked at Shelly, his heart aching, but he endured it.

“You’re nothing like that. Besides, we’re not the same kind of people, so-”

“I’ll learn, ” Nox interrupted Shelly mid-sentence.

His words surprised Shelly.

“Gentle, considerate, kind, cook, do the laundry, take care of children…” Nox looked at Shelly. “I’ll learn!”

Shelly laughed sarcastically, mocking Nox. Some things were easy to say, but not everyone could do it.

Not to mention being gentle, considerate, and kind, just doing simple laundry, cooking, and taking care of the children were like Greek to Nox. There was no way he could do it.

“Give me some time. I’ll show you.” Nox could also see the sarcasm in Shelly’s eyes..
