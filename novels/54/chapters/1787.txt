Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When Nox finished smoking and was about to return to his room, his phone suddenly rang. Although he did not want to answer it, he still picked it up. “Mom.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Nox, have you broken up with Shelly?”

“Aren’t there a few days left?” Nox was a little impatient. “Can you stop rushing me? I know what I’m doing.”

“If you knew what you were doing, I wouldn’t have to worry so much about you. You’re 30 years old, and you don’t even have a child of your own. How can I not be worried?”

“There are still ten days. If I can’t get Shelly back in ten days, we’ll break up, ” Nox said angrily.

Mrs. Winter could tell that Nox was unhappy. She also knew that if she pushed too hard, things might go the other way.

As such, her voice became gentler. “I’m not rushing you. I’m just reminding you that I’ve arranged a few blind dates for you. You promised me that after you broke up with Shelly, you would go on blind dates and get married.” “I got it.” Nox said, “As soon as we break up, I’ll go on those blind dates and do whatever you want.”

“In that case, it’s settled.”

“Okay.”

After Nox hung up the phone, he looked up at the sky and suddenly could not help but shout to release his anger.

Shelly, who was in the room, heard it. She glanced at the balcony and frowned, wondering what Nox was up to this time. However, she ignored him. She had never thought of interfering with Nox’s affairs; she could not care less.

On Saturday, Shelly went to her classmate’s wedding and brought Bella with her. None of the students knew that Bella’s daughter was already four years old, so they were all surprised. After all, they were only 22 years old.

Getting married at the age of 22 was rare enough, but Bella was four years old. Everyone was asking who the father was because everyone knew that Shelly did not go for the college entrance exam or stay with the Winters.

Shelly did not answer. However, since Sarah was there, the gossipers stopped asking more questions, and everyone gradually stopped talking about that topic.

Bella ate her food obediently and whispered unhappily to Shelly, “Mom, why didn’t you tell them that my father is Nox ”

“Shh.” Shelly covered Bella’s mouth.

Bella looked at her mother unhappily. She thought she was lucky to have Nox as her father. She even wanted to show off to the world that she had a father, yet why was her mother so… reluctant to reveal him?

“I will explain to you later. Now, listen to me and be a good girl. Eat your food.”

Bella blinked at Shelly and nodded obediently.

After lunch, the classmates gathered together to play some card games for entertainment. Since Shelly did not know how to play and did not want Bella to come into contact with those things early, she decided to leave early.

Sarah, on the other hand, was very proactive. She was shouting at her classmates to play with her.

When Shelly left with Bella in her arms, Benjamin called her from behind, “Shelly.”

Shelly paused and asked in surprise, “Aren’t you playing with them?”

“There are enough people, so I won’t join in. Moreover, my card skills are bad.” Benjamin smiled and

“Oh,” Shelly replied.

“Are you leaving?” Benjamin looked at her and asked.

“Yes. I’m thinking of taking Bella home. She has the habit of taking afternoon naps.” “This place is a little remote and not easy to get a taxi. Let me send you guys back.”

“Aren’t you going to stay for dinner?”

“I won’t. I still have to work overtime in the afternoon, so let’s go. It’s on the way.” Benjamin smiled. While Shelly hesitated, Benjamin had picked Bella up and teased her. “Bella, do you remember me?” Bella looked at Benjamin whom she thought looked familiar but could not recall his name.

“What an ingrate. I even cooked for you. Have you forgotten?” Benjamin pretended to be angry.

Bella thought about it carefully before saying, “Uncle Ben.”

“You do remember me!” Benjamin was very happy. “Are you happy that I’m back?”

“I’m happy.” Bella smiled brightly.

“I’ll send you and your mommy home, okay?”

“Alright.” Bella’s clear voice rang out as she nodded.

As Benjamin walked in front with Bella in his arms, he turned around and said to Shelly, “Let’s go.”

Shelly gritted her teeth and followed. She figured she would just treat him as an ordinary friend, so there was no need for her to hold herself back too much.

Benjamin drove them away in his car, but Shelly did not know what to say to him on the way back. She felt that it was a little awkward for the two of them to be alone..
