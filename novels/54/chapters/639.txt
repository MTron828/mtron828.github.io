Chapter 640: Monica Was Drunk and Walked Into the Wrong Door

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn’s expression darkened.

The door that was supposed to close on Monica stopped for a moment.

“Are you at the wrong door?” Finn asked her.

Monica hugged Finn tightly like an octopus. “That’s right.”

“Let go of me.” Finn’s voice was cold.

Even though she could not see his expression, she knew it was terrifying.

However, rather than letting go, Monica hugged him tighter and tighter.

“I’ll count to three.” Finn’s voice sounded scary. “One, two...”

Monica suddenly let go of Finn but did not leave his house. Instead, she limped straight into his living room.

Finn’s expression was extremely ugly.

He held it in for a second, but the next, he turned around and grabbed Monica’s arm, wanting to throw her out.

“Barf...” Monica suddenly vomited all over Finn’s body.

Finn kept putting more force on Monica’s arm that he was pulling

However, Monica did not seem to feel any pain.

After she vomited once, she vomited twice in a row. Only then did she feel better, and she looked up at Finn and said, “Much better.”

Finn sneered.

That smile could really kill Monica.

Then, he let go of Monica and returned to his room.

Monica looked at his silhouette before limping to the sofa beside her and collapsing on it.

Her world was spinning.

How long had she not drunk? Why was she so dizzy?

She looked at the ceiling above her head with a lifeless gaze and saw that the ceiling was spinning non-stop.

Suddenly, she did not know where she was.

Why was it so familiar yet unfamiliar at the same time?

However, her current physical condition made her not want to move.

She swore she would never drink so much again in the future. No matter how much she wanted to drink, she had to control herself.

With that, she silently set a goal for herself

Then, she suddenly felt her body yanked up by someone.

“Ugh.”

She felt terrible.

‘Don’t touch me,’ she thought.

Monica’s small face was scrunched up due to the discomfort.

“Don’t move. I’m not feeling well. Ugh...”

Monica looked at the person in front of her, who had water droplets falling off his hair and on his body. He also smelled nice.

It was a very pleasant smell, and it made her want to get closer.

However, her body was shackled by something, and she could not move, no matter what.

“Monica, don’t challenge my limits!”

Monica looked at him and his furious expression.

In the next second, she felt as though her body was floating, like someone was carrying her. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As she was carried, she was closer to the pleasant smell on his body, so she reached out and hugged his neck.

Finn’s throat bobbed as he carried Monica out of the house.

Meanwhile, Monica buried her head in his exposed neck.

She did not know why, but she wanted to take a bite of it. Hence, she opened her mouth.

Finn’s eyes narrowed as Monica took a bite and even licked his neck.

Then, just as she was about to touch it, her body was suddenly thrown into the backseat of a car.

The sudden movement almost made her vomit again.

She held her stomach and felt the car speeding on the road for some time.

Anyway, Monica was asleep.

For a drunk person, falling asleep was as easy as getting high on energy.

When Finn parked the car at the entrance of Monica’s residential area, he opened the back seat to see that Monica was fast asleep.

He called out to her, “Monica.”

Even so, Monica did not move.

Finn stared at Monica for a while before picking up his phone and making a call.

After a while, someone picked up the call. “Finn?”

“It’s me. Monica is drunk and is now downstairs. Please come down and get her.” Finn’s tone was cold.

Michael was stunned for a second.

However, Finn had hung up the phone by then.

Michael looked at his phone with a dark expression. Then, he put down his phone, changed his clothes, and drove to the entrance of Monica’s residential area.

That was when he saw Finn leaning against the car and smoking on the street near the entrance.

Michael got out of the car and walked over.

Finn glanced at Michael but did not say anything.

Meanwhile, Michael turned his head to look at Monica, who was sleeping soundly in the backseat. He turned around and asked Finn, “Why is she here?”

“Ask her,” Finn put out the cigarette and said coldly, “Take her away.”

Michael gritted his teeth and picked up Monica, who was sleeping in the backseat.

Just as Finn was about to get into the car and leave, Michael called out to him, “Finn.”

Finn turned around.

“You’d better stay away from her.”

“You should tell Monica that.”

“What do you mean?” Michael’s expression was a little ugly.

“Since you’ve used all means to keep her by your side, you’d better watch her closely,” Finn said coldly.

Michael just looked at Finn.

Monica did not know what he was up to, but Finn knew!

In that case, he did not need to refute that statement.

Finn sat in the driver’s seat and left.

Michael glared in the direction Finn left before lowering his head to look at Monica.

He suppressed his emotions and carried Monica upstairs to her house, where he placed her on her bed.

Monica twisted and turned on the bed as she was not feeling well.

Hence, Michael made a hot towel to wipe her face with it, and as he did, he gulped.

Suddenly, an impulse popped up in his mind.

If he took her virginity... would Monica still want to return to Finn’s side?

At that moment, his entire body tensed up.
