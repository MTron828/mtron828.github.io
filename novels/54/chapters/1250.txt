1251 Nox’s Accusation Against Jeanne

However, Monica was different.

A person’s personality would not change so much.

For Monica to treat Finn like that, it could only mean that… she really did not have much hope for Finn. That was why she chose to be with him but keep her distance.

It was not a physical distance but a distance between their hearts.

Nox was wondering whether Finn would misunderstand that if two people slept together, it meant that they were completely honest with each other and that they loved each other very much…

Many times, having sex really did not mean anything.

Just like him, having sex with someone was a common occurrence for him, and he could leave after he was done with it.

Sometimes, he did not even know what the woman in bed looked like, let alone love her.

“Hey, did you hear what I just said?” Nox thought about it for a long time, but he did not get a response from Finn.

Finn said while driving, “I heard you. Monica has indeed changed a lot. Think about it, if she can manage such a big company, how can she manage it with her old personality and behavior? Now that she has gone through so much, she has matured.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Finn, I suddenly feel that one day, you will regret your ignorance.” Nox was a little disappointed with Finn.

Finn smiled faintly.

He had never felt that he could discuss the so-called feelings between a man and a woman with a person like Nox, who only knew how to think with the lower half of his body.

He sent Nox to her apartment before driving back.

Since he had applied for a week’s leave from work and could rest at home for two days, he drove back.

When he entered the house, he did not expect Monica to be there.

He had just told Nox that he was not tired, not to the point where he could not drive. However, after working for five days, he was still physically and mentally exhausted. Thus, the moment he returned home, he went straight back to his room to prepare to take a shower and sleep to recuperate.

However, when he pushed open the bedroom door, he saw Monica changing her clothes.

Monica seemed to be a little surprised to see him. She asked, “I thought you would accompany Fourth Master for two more days.”

After all, she could see that the Old Master Swan’s death must have dealt a huge blow to Fourth Master Swan. She could feel Fourth Master Swan’s immense sorrow even when Old Master Swan was being buried.

At that thought, she found Fourth Master Swan quite pitiful. First, his wife was dead, and now his father was dead.

Of course, she would not sympathize with him.

Whose fault was it that he got together with another woman right after his wife died? She would never be able to get over Fourth Master Swan’s actions for the rest of her life! Even when she was facing Fourth Master Swan, she was still very timid.

It was not that she was afraid of him.

It was just that she had once received one billion dollars from Fourth Master Swan for the company. Although Nox was the one who gave it to her, she knew that it was Fourth Master Swan’s, so… in front of her benefactor, she could only suppress her anger.

Even if she did not sympathize with Fourth Master Swan, it did not mean that she would not agree with Finn going.

Finn and Fourth Master Swan’s relationship should be deeper than what they made it to be. At a time like that, as Fourth Master Swan’s friend, should Finn not be with him for two more days?

She was prepared to be at home alone for a few more days.

In fact, she did not need to make any preparations. She and Finn were both very busy, so busy that they did not even have much time to be together. Most of the time they spent together would probably be in bed.

“Fourth Master knows what to do,” Finn replied.

Monica nodded, thinking that it was true.

If Fourth Master Swan could accept Jeanne’s death and live with it so calmly in such a short time, it would probably be the same with Old Master Swan’s death.

Hence, she did not say anything more.

“Do you need my help?” Finn looked at Monica, who was struggling to put on a long black dress.

“No need,” Monica said calmly, “I can do it.”

Finn nodded.

At that moment, he watched as Monica tried her best to pull up the zipper at the back and tidied up her skirt.

The dress was a fitting cut, so after Monica zipped it up, the dress her curvaceous figure was vividly wrapped in the dress.

How good was Monica’s figure…

Finn knew all about it. Therefore, when he saw her now, his face seemed a little red, which was just a natural reaction of his body.

Of course, Monica was in a bit of a hurry and did not notice Finn’s expression. After tidying up her appearance, she said, “I’m leaving.”

“Okay.” Finn nodded.
