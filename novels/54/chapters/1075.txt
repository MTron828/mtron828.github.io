1076 Going To Court: Brie Appears and Exposes Michael

Or perhaps, he was deliberately stalling for time and waiting for an order from his superior.

At that moment, the staff member, who had just left returned to the courtroom, walked to the judge and whispered a few words in his ear.

The judge’s expression changed slightly, and he nodded. Then, he sat up straight, as if he had received clear instructions and knew what to do next.

Nox looked at the judge’s expression and laughed. “It seems like he has received an order to be fair.”

How could the judge be unfair and unjust?

After all, the entire Harken was watching the trial now.

In the courtroom, Brie was silent for two seconds. She seemed to have taken a deep breath before saying, “Everything I said is the absolute truth. If there’s a single lie in what I said, I’ll be struck by lightning!”

“Alright!” The judge agreed immediately. “In that case, please answer the plaintiff’s lawyer’s questions truthfully and seriously.”

Brie nodded.

The moment she nodded, she looked up at Michael in the audience, and their eyes met.

Even from a distance, she could still see Michael’s red and ferocious eyes as if he wanted to kill her.

Brie’s throat moved slightly.

During this period of time when she was imprisoned by Nox, she had actually thought about letting Michael go. After all, she had loved him for many years and did not want to see him die. However, after she had “died” for such a long time, she did not see a trace of sadness or forbearance in Michael. The only news she received was that Michael had been continuously developing Sunny Pharmaceutical and working hard for his future. He did not feel any guilt or regret toward her.

She was not that selfless or stupid either. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Since Michael was heartless, there was no need for her to die for him.

As she looked back, the trace of emotion in her eyes instantly turned cruel. She said, “In order to clear his name, Michael told me to atone for his crime. After all, I had the motive to frame Monica. He told me that he would send me out of South Hampton City and out of Harken. Even if I was found guilty, the police in Harken wouldn’t be able to find me, and I wouldn’t be punished. That way, I could leave safely, and he could clear his name. It’s killing two birds with one stone. He even promised that when things are over and he has regained his rights, he will bring me back from abroad and marry me. ”

“If that’s the case, why did you come back to accuse him after he sent you away safely?” Judah asked, “This doesn’t seem to make sense.”

“Because...” Brie’s expression was extremely cold. “Michael didn’t want to send me away at all. He just wanted to kill me! After killing me, no one can threaten him and expose his crimes!”

“What evidence do you have to prove that Michael wanted to kill you?”

“I have a recording!” Brie said.

“Please show me your recording.” Judah did not ask for the judge’s permission and directly told Brie to show evidence.

Brie took out the USB that she had brought with her. Then, Judah took it and told the staff to play it in front of everyone.

In an instant, the sound of a man and a woman conversing sounded in the court.

“My idea is that you should be the scapegoat for this. You have the motive to take revenge on Monica, and you also have the ability to fabricate such an incident–” It was Michael’s voice.

“So, I should die in your place.” It was Brie’s voice.

“I won’t let you die. Before you’re exposed, I’ll have someone send you away secretly–”

“I’m a sinner. Can I still return to Harken?”

“As long as I still have power, I can think of a way…”

It was a very long recording, and everyone at the scene listened carefully. The more they heard, the more they saw how cruel Michael was.

When Michael heard the first sentence of the recording, he got up to leave.

He wanted to leave without anyone noticing before anyone noticed him.

He knew that Brie’s accusation would immediately prove that he had committed a crime, so if he stayed here, he would be waiting for death.

No matter how emotional he was now, no matter how unwilling he was, and no matter what would happen to him in the future, the only thing he could do now was to escape.

If he escaped, at least he would have a glimmer of hope to survive. He refused to believe that he, Michael, would be utterly suppressed like that.

After all, where there was life, there was hope. Hence, he gritted his teeth and left.

Just as he got to the door, Nox stood in his way.

Nox’s smile was a little frivolous and casual, but it formed a sharp contrast with the nervous Michael.

Nox said, “It’s not over yet. Where are you going, Mr. Ross?”

Michael’s expression was extremely ugly.

“We just got to the exciting part. It’ll be a pity for you to leave. Mr. Ross. You should go back to your seat and enjoy it. After all, you’re about to be put on trial.” Nox’s words made Michael’s face sink.

At that moment, he also thought that the fact that Brie was still alive might have something to do with Nox.

He was suppressing his anger, but he knew that he could not cause any chaos. With that, he glanced at Nox and turned around to return to the audience.

However, he had just taken two steps when he suddenly turned around and punched Nox’s face.

Even if it caused chaos, escaping was the most important thing. He could not let himself die here.

However, as soon as he threw his fist, Nox caught it firmly, so much so that Michael could not move at that moment.

Michael glared at Nox fiercely and used all his strength to resist, but he still could not break free.

Nox coldly said, “I knew you would be so despicable.”

Michael gritted his teeth.

“Nox, let me go!”

“Let you go? If I let you go, wouldn’t all the grievances that Monica has suffered from you be for nothing?” Nox’s expression grew colder and colder.

The moment he said that, he even kicked Michael hard.

Michael lost his balance and was sent flying to the ground by Nox’s kick.

It instantly caused a huge commotion and alarmed everyone at the scene.

However, Nox did not stop after kicking Michael. He went over, grabbed Michael’s collar, and punched Michael in the face until Michael’s face was swollen and beyond recognition!

...

That was for bullying Monica!
