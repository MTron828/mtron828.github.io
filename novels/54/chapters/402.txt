Chapter 403: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship

Jeanne scrutinized him.

Why was he worried that he would be killed?

“I admit that I’m a very dangerous person.” Edward smiled helplessly. “But I promised I would protect you, and I’m a man of my word.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When did she say she wanted him to protect her?

However, she changed the topic slightly. “Can anyone take that kind of medicine?”

“Of course not,” Edward said. “Finn adjusted the dose of the medicine according to my physical condition. If others can’t take it, they will bleed from their seven orifices and die from her heart exploding.”

“In that case, if it is according to my physical condition, can I take it?”

“You can’t either.”

“Why?”

“Because mine is already the lowest dose.”

It meant that the dosage could not go any lower than that, and even he could only withstand that dose, so it was best for others not to try it.

Moreover, Jeanne felt that for Edward to be able to use that medicine, countless people might have been sacrificed before.

As she bit her lips unconsciously, Edward hugged her tightly. “Don’t be afraid. I won’t hurt you.”

......

“What if one day, we stand on different sides?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

He smiled. “I won’t either.”

Jeanne’s throat bobbed.

Then, Nox’s words rang in her ears again, telling her to show mercy.

She bit her lips.

Just like that, she nestled in Edward’s embrace and heard him say in her ear, “Jeannie, cherish the present.”

What he meant by ‘cherish the present’ was…

He, too, knew that many unpredictable things would happen in the future!

…

At South Hampton City Central Hospital, Monica was lying on the bed after the surgery.

The anesthetic had worn off, so she was in pain. Although the surgery was yesterday, it still hurt today.

It hurt so much that she wanted to ask the nurse to inject her with another shot of painkiller.

She looked at her leg, which was in a cast hanging in front of her, and felt inexplicably sad. What made her feel even worse was that she could not see Finn.

Nobody knew that she could go crazy just thinking about him now.

One week was simply too long. Even one day was too long.

Days passed like years.

“Monica, eat something.” Ruby had been taking care of Monica, and Gary did not leave her side either.

“Mom, go ask the doctor how Finn’s doing.”

Ruby was speechless. “You just asked me to do that ten minutes ago.”

“Did I?” Monica pretended to be dumb.

“The doctor said that Finn is recovering very well. Her body’s functions are slowly recovering, so he can definitely leave the intensive care unit within a week,” Ruby repeated impatiently.

“Does it have to be a week?” Monica asked.

“Do you miss him that much?” Ruby teased while feeding Monica porridge.

Monica nodded and did not hide her feelings.

“I wonder who was the one who said she didn’t like him back then?” Ruby could not help but laugh and say that on purpose.

“Back then, didn’t I... I had my own dignity to preserve! I thought Finn didn’t like me, so I told myself I didn’t like Finn either, not at all! But now that I know Finn loves me so much, I won’t hide my feelings,” Monica said happily.

“What made you realize that Finn loves you?” Ruby was curious.

It was useless to tell Monica that before, so why did she suddenly see it now?

“I won’t tell you,” Monica refused flatly.

In fact, it was not that she could not tell her mother. It was just too bloody, and she was afraid it would scare the old couple.

“Look at you all smug.” Ruby did not probe further either.

Everything was good as long as the young people had sorted out their feelings.

Ruby kept feeding Monica while Gary sat on the sofa in the VIP ward and read the newspaper.

The atmosphere in the ward was harmonious until Michael suddenly appeared.

At that time, Monica had just finished a bowl of porridge when she looked up and saw Michael. Not only her, but her parents saw him too.

Michael was holding a bouquet of flowers and some fruits.

Then, the smile on Monica’s lips gradually faded.

When Gary and Ruby saw Michael, their expressions shifted a little.

Michael glanced at Monica, and when he saw her smile disappear the moment she saw him, he was actually upset. However, he did not show it on his face. Instead, he smiled and greeted Gary and Ruby respectfully, “Hello, uncle and auntie.”

“What are you doing here? “Gary glanced at Michael before lowering his head to read the newspaper. His tone was also very cold.
