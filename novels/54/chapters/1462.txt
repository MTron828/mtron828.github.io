Chapter 1463: Tortured by Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, she had no choice because Bella was different from other normal children. She was born deaf. She could not hear anything at all in one ear and could barely hear with a hearing aid in the other.

She had brought Bella to the various hospitals for a checkup. The doctor said that Bella’s condition could be treated with surgery, but the surgery was very expensive. From the initial examination to the surgery to the long-term treatment, the doctor said that it would cost at least 50,000 dollars.

According to the doctor, the sooner Bella’s surgery was done, the better. That was why she desperately wanted to earn money. However, no matter how hard she worked or how frugal she was, saving 500,00 dollars was really difficult.

The whole thing discouraged her a little, and she thought, ‘Why don’t I just let

Bella be since one of her ears was barely functional?’

However, the doctor said that it was very likely that during the process of development, Bella’s ear might become completely deaf.

Shelly sighed.

The moment she wanted to stroke Bella’s little pink face, she gave up for fear that she would dirty Bella. With that, she turned around and went to the bathroom to wash up.

She then took off her clothes, revealing her body that was covered in bruises. Nox did not even feel any pity for her when he was sober, let alone when he was unconscious. Now, her entire body looked as terrifying as it could be.

Shelly did not react much to how her body looked. She just took it as if she had been bitten by a dog that had bitten her many times. In any case, she would be able to leave South Hampton City with Bella one day.

She took a quick shower and then searched for some burn medicine at home.

Although there were many marks on her body, they were all bites, bruises, and hickeys. If she did not touch them, she would not feel any pain. However, she could not ignore the injury on the back of her hand.

Fortunately, Sarah’s aunt was really attentive to her. From time to time, she would come over and give Sarah all her daily necessities, so they definitely had medicine for burns.

Shelly gently rubbed it on herself, and the cool feeling made her feel much better. After she was done, she lay back down on the bed.

By then, it was already 6 a.m. in the morning. She could still sleep for two hours, and two hours later, she would have to take Bella for a regular ear checkup.

When Nox woke up, it was already morning, and he sleeping on his own bed.

He could not even remember how he came back or what he did last night. That was the first time he had lost his memory after getting drunk.

“Nox.” The woman beside him suddenly called out to him. “Are you awake?”

Nox turned to look at Zoe, who was lying in bed. Somehow, he had a feeling that something was wrong.

“Did you send me home last night?” Nox asked.

“No.” Zoe said, “We were both drunk last night, and I don’t know how we got back as well. But when I woke up, I was already on your bed. My friend probably sent us back.”

“Is that so?” Nox muttered.

It was not that he doubted her, but he found it a little hard to believe that he blanked out.

“Are you feeling unwell?” Zoe looked at him. “Do you have a hangover?”

“No.” Nox shook his head. “Sleep a little while longer. I’m going to take a shower.”

“Alright.”

Nox walked to the bathroom and took off his clothes, which were the same set of clothes he wore last night. It was clear that he had come back unconscious. Otherwise, he would not have gone to bed without taking a shower or changing his clothes.

The moment he took off his clothes that reeked of alcohol, he froze. He looked at the huge mirror and saw terrifying scratch marks all over his body.

What did he do last night?

Just then, some images suddenly appeared in his mind. It was all Shelly!

‘F*ck! I’ve been raped by Shelly!’

Nox immediately came back to his senses. Last night, he seemed to have done it with Shelly…

It was not a dream. If he was dreaming, how could there be so many marks on his body? It could not be Zoe because Zoe would never treat him like that, so it was definitely Shelly.

As soon as he recalled it, it made him inexplicably angry. To think Shelly had used such a despicable method to scheme against him! It even struck him now that he was drugged. If not, how could he have sex with Shelly, that shameless bitch? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The more Nox thought about it, the angrier he got. He was so angry that he was about to smoke.

Outside the bathroom, Zoe knocked on the door. “Nox, I want to shower with you.”

“No!” Nox hurriedly locked the door.

If Zoe saw the marks on his body, it would be a disaster! Hence, he quickly said, “I’ll be done soon. You can take a shower yourself later.”

“Oh.” Zoe was always very obedient.

No matter what he said, she would agree. That made Nox start to feel guilty toward Zoe, and for that, he really wanted to strangle Shelly.

Nox quickly took a shower, changed into a set of pajamas that fully covered his body, and came out of the bathroom.

Zoe, who was always smiling at him, hugged his arm affectionately, and Nox’s body froze for some reason, like he did not know what to do after doing something bad.

“I’ve made you a cup of tea, and it’ll sober you up. I’m going to take a shower.”

“Alright.”

Zoe kissed his cheek before walking into the bathroom.

Nox felt bad and was wondering if he should tell Zoe. If he told her, Zoe would be sad, but if he did not tell her, he would feel that he was hiding it from Zoe. Hence, he thought about it and gave Finn a call.

Finn had just accompanied Monica to Cardellini Enterprise. To be precise, he was not accompanying but following. Every day, he would follow behind Monica and try to make his presence known.

He looked at Nox’s call and picked it up.

“If you had an affair, how would you explain it to Monica?” Nox asked immediately.

…I will never have an affair.” Finn enunciated each word.

“Forced to have an affair.” “I will never be forced.’ “Hypothetically.”

“It will never happen. ”

“Finn!” Nox was about to explode with anger.

“Did you cheat?” Finn knew Nox’s personality all too well.

If Nox had not run into trouble, he would not take the initiative to look for him.

“I was drugged.”

“By who?”

“A slut.’

“So, you cheated on Zoe a month before you’re supposed to get married,” Finn concluded.

“I’m not asking you to come to a conclusion. I’m asking you, what would you do if you encountered such a situation? Will he confess to Monica?” “I will never encounter such a situation,” Finn said stubbornly.

“Alright, now that I’ve encountered it, how do you think I should deal with it?”

“First of all, you have to figure out why you cheated. Were you really drugged or seduced? If you were drugged and forced, it’s understandable. But if you were seduced, even a little bit, I think your marriage is over.”

“Of course, I was forced, and I regret it now.”

“If you were forced and want your wedding to go ahead, you must do two things. First, find the person who drugged you and cut off your relationship with her, especially anything that can come and bite you back in the in the future. What I’m talking about is pregnancy and whatnot — anything that will tie you back to her.”

Nox was stunned. At that moment, he could not help but admire Finn’s seriousness in handling matters. However, he never thought Shelly would trick him like that. If she really did that…

Perhaps his parents and grandfather would want him to marry Shelly immediately.

“Once you’ve done the first thing, you should come clean to Zoe. Hiding something like this is the greatest harm to your relationship. If Zoe understands, you can continue with the wedding. If not, it’s best you go your separate ways..”
