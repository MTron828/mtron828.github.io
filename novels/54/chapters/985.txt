986 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

“You know Mr. Thorn quite well.” Mason nodded.

Jeanne rolled her eyes.

Kingsley was a devil. When he was ruthless, he was really wicked beyond redemption.

“Did Kerby tell you?” Jeanne asked.

“It’s probably because Lucy is in too much pain right now and is a little unstable, so when you were on your way down just now, Kerby asked me what to do. What do you think I should do?” Mason asked Jeanne.

Jeanne just stared at him, which creeped him out a little.

“Mason,” Jeanne said, “you want to get Kerby to help Lucy with her physical needs through me, don’t you?”

Mason did not deny it.

Jeanne was just wondering when Mason had become so interested in gossip. However, it turned out that he had another motive for saying so much.

As expected, an assassin would not usually speak, but if he did, it mean something had happened.

“Other than you, no one in the Hills dares to oppose Mr. Thorn, and that includes me. I only came back with you this time because I said I wanted to protect you, which Mr. Thorn could accept. But if I cross the line and let Kerby disobey Mr. Thorn’s orders, I’ll be courting death.”

“Why are you helping Lucy?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

Were assassins not supposed to be cold-blooded and heartless? Why get oneself into trouble when it did not concern one?

“Lucy is the only person I admire in the Hills,” Mason said bluntly.

“You like her?” Jeanne asked.

“No, I just admire her.” Mason denied it. He did not seem to be lying. “Moreover, if the Hills lose Lucy, it’s the Hills’ loss.

“But Kingsley doesn’t cherish her,” Jeanne said.

At the same time, she was already calling Kingsley.

In fact, she would have done the same even without Mason’s request. Compared to Mason’s admiration for Lucy, her feelings for Lucy were deeper.

There was no way she was going to let Lucy die from the drug.

The call went through quickly.

Kingsley’s angry voice came from the other end of the phone. “You’re finally willing to call me, huh?”

“I’m calling to tell you that Lucy’s body can’t take it anymore. Since Kerby is by her side, I’m going to let him solve her physical needs.”

“You just have to go against me, don’t you?”

“Why don’t you let Kerby sleep with Lucy?”

“She knew that Millie was plotting against her, yet she allowed Millie to do it. Isn’t this the punishment she deserves?” Kingsley could not hide his anger. “Besides, do you think I don’t know what Lucy is thinking?! Since she wants to get rid of Millie this way… There were ten thousand ways she could use to get Millie far from here, but since she insisted on using this method, shouldn’t I fulfill her wish?”

“You just won’t admit that you don’t want other men to touch Lucy.” With that, Jeanne hung up the phone.

She refused to listen to Kingsley’s rebuttal, which could piss Kingsley off.

Mason suddenly felt that Lucy was not the only person he admired in the Hills. In fact, he also admired how domineering Jeanne was in her confrontation with Kingsley.

He unconsciously tightened his grip on the steering wheel. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Some of the emotions that he once suppressed seemed to stir.

“Do you have Kerby’s number?” Jeanne asked Mason after she hung up on Kingsley.

Mason looked back and said as usual, “You can use my phone to call him. His number is the first on the list.”

Jeanne took Mason’s phone and made a call.

“I’m Jeanne,” she said bluntly.

“Eldest Young Lady.” Kerby was very respectful.

“How’s Lucy?”

“We’re in the hotel now, and she’s in the bathroom. I don’t know how she’s doing. However, when she went in just now, I thought she was going to die soon,” Kerby reported.

Actually, it was obvious.

Since Millie wanted to kill Lucy, she would definitely drug Lucy with the highest dosage.

“Go and help her,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Kerby obviously did not dare to do so as he did not agree immediately.

“I’ll explain things to Kingsley. If anything happens, I’ll take care of it. I won’t implicate you.”

“Alright.” Kerby did not say much and agreed immediately

Perhaps Lucy was really at her limit.

After all, in serious cases, that drug could cause death.

She returned the phone to Mason and sent a message to Kingsley with her phone, saying, “I’ve told Kerby to help Lucy.”

Jeanne felt that if she sent that message out, Kingsley would be so angry that he would die of a heart attack.
