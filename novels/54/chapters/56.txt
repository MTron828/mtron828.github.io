Chapter 57: Something Is Wrong With Fourth Master Swan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne registered George at the Angerburg Private Elementary School.

These days, Paul had been under intensive training at home. A teacher was specially hired to teach him how to ace the interview.

As for George, no one cared.

On this day, Jasmine came back.

It was the first time she came back after her honeymoon after the marriage.

Eden did not accompany her.

After Eden returned, he immediately went to work at a listed company under the Swans and could not find the time.

It was also said that after Eden got married, the Swans held him in high regard and seemed to be interested in grooming him to become the successor of the Swans.

Of course, that was what Jasmine said.

Jeanne brought George downstairs to drink some water.

George was holding a book in his hand. Jeanne poured a glass of water and passed by the hall. She was ready to go to the back garden for a walk to get some fresh air.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with Fourth Master these past two days. He has been boiling chicken soup for us,” Jasmine suddenly said.

Jeanne choked on her water. “Cough, cough.”

Jasmine turned to look at Jeanne and did not say anything.

She said to Jenifer and Phoebe. “The chicken soup tasted disgusting. Everyone in the house wanted to throw up.”

“Is that so?” Jenifer smiled and said, “You used to say that Fourth Master is a god-like figure. Now that you’re living together, you must’ve realized that he’s just an ordinary person.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Not really. Fourth Master’s aura is still very strong. I don’t dare to talk to him.”

“Say, is Fourth Master making soup for you in hopes that you and Eden will have children soon?” Phoebe immediately complimented, “I also heard that Fourth Master Swan seems to have some problems in that aspect.”

“Who knows?” Jasmine seemed to be a little proud. “That said, your speculation isn’t unreasonable, Auntie. If Fourth Master was healthy, he wouldn’t have fallen for someone.”

As Jasmine said that, he glanced at Jeanne who was walking toward the back garden.

Jenifer sneered. “That day, Jeanne admitted that the Fourth Master Swan only kissed her because he wanted to reject the marriage with the third princess of the Sanders. Have you heard that from the Swans?”

“I’ve heard about it. The Swans don’t want a marriage agreement with the Sanders.” Jasmine nodded.

“Why? Wouldn’t it be better for the Swans to climb up to the imperial family?”

“I’m not too sure either. Eden said that if it’s an important matter of the Swans, other than Fourth Master Swan and Old Master Swan, no one else has the right to speak nor get involved. Hence, no one knows the exact reason for this matter. All they know is that the Swans are determined not to have a marriage agreement with the Sanders.”

“Could it be Fourth Master Swan’s health problem? Once he marries the princess, if his health isn’t good enough, wouldn’t he be ruining the princess’s life? I reckon that the Swans wouldn’t be able to explain.” Jenifer speculated.

“Fourth Master Swan’s health condition is truly a mystery. No one in the Swans dares to talk about it. I’ve also asked Eden, but he can’t explain it clearly. Anyway, in the Swans, Fourth Master Swan’s position is particularly high. Not to mention Eden as a junior, even Eden’s father has to be a little humble to Fourth Master Swan.”

“Then you have to perform well in front of Fourth Master Swan in the future,” Jenifer reminded, “The most important thing is to not let Jeanne marry Fourth Master Swan. Let me know if anything happens. I’ll think of a way to stop it. No matter what, we mustn’t let Jeanne marry Fourth Master. Otherwise, we won’t have a good life.”

“I know.” Jasmine nodded heavily.

“I don’t think Jeanne has the ability to marry Fourth Master Swan.” Phoebe interrupted at the right time with a look of disdain. “She has an illegitimate child. That’s all she has. Besides, she is so unambitious toward her son. I just saw George reading a children’s book! To be honest, as an ordinary person, I don’t even care about the mother and son, let alone Fourth Master Swan! Jeanne only relies on being the daughter of the Lawrences. Otherwise, she’d be trash on the streets! It’s not that I’m boasting, but George just isn’t as smart and capable as my son.”

“Is Paul going to interview for a first-class elementary school?” Jasmine asked.

“Yes, tomorrow,” Phoebe said, “Everything is ready.”

“Good luck.” Jasmine touched Paul, who was sitting obediently next to her. “You must step on George hard.”

“Yes, Sister Jasmine.” Paul was very confident.

“I heard that Quinton, the youngest son of Third Uncle Swan, is going for the interview tomorrow too,” Jasmine said, “That child was educated very well by the Swans. I’m afraid that when he grows up, he’ll compete with Eden.”

“You’re thinking too far ahead. That child is only a few years old, whereas Eden is already working at the Swans’ enterprise and has the advantage.” Jenifer was much more magnanimous.

“That’s true.” Jasmine smiled. She also felt that she was thinking too much.

With Eden’s ability, in the years that Quinton had grown up, he had grasped the Swans tightly in his hands. How could there still be anything left for Quinton?!

…

In the backyard, Jeanne brought George to sit in the gazebo to rest.

George was reading a brain teaser book.

Jeanne sat next to him and seemed to be deep in thoughts.

“Nom, are you thinking about something?”George put down the book and looked at her.

Jeanne came back to her senses. “Yes.”

“What are you thinking about?” George asked.

‘I’m thinking about... the matter of Fourth Master Swan making chicken soup.’

Jeanne answered, “I’m thinking about how to get Fourth Master Swan to stay away from me.”

“Mom, do you really hate Fourth Master Swan?” George asked.

“I just don’t like him.”

“Me too.” George was straightforward. “I always feel that he’ll snatch you away.”

Jeanne was stunned.

George said, “Will he?”

“No.” Jeanne was certain.

“That’s good.”

“Are you afraid that I’ll be snatched away?”

“Yes.” George nodded honestly. “After all, my dad is dead. If you leave as well, I’ll become an orphan. I heard that orphans are very miserable.”

“Silly.” Jeanne rubbed George’s head.

Even if she left, she would bring George along…

Besides, she would not leave.

She had never thought of being with anyone else in her life.

Especially... Fourth Master Swan.
