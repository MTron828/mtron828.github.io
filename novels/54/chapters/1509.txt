Nevertheless, Candice placed her hand on Edward’s palm. The moment she did that, she felt him heave a sigh of relief. It made her dumbfounded as to who between the both of them should be the one nervous. He held her hand tightly in his and said slowly, “I like Candice very much.” He was talking to Chloe, who had gone crazy.

Chloe was stunned for a second. She then raised her head and looked at the tall Edward.

“I like her very much. The reason why I gave her birth control pills was that I didn’t want to hurt her body.” Edward said coldly, “Of course, I don’t have to explain it to you. There’s no need to explain it to unimportant people.”

Then, he left with Candice, leaving the devastated Nicholsons in the prison room.

Outside the detention center, Candice and Edward sat in the car. The two of their fingers were still interlocked, but they did not speak.

“Candice,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

“Yes,” Candice responded.

“If you have any questions, you can ask me.”

Chloe was silent for a few seconds. In fact, she had nothing to ask. She understood the nature of their marriage very well, so she did not mind it. She said, “You have your own considerations, and I respect your decision.” It meant she would not interfere with the Nicholsons’ or Chloe’s matters.

Putting aside the fact that she did not feel much for the Nicholsons, the fact that Chloe had caused her to crash during the drill was enough to make her watch coldly from the sidelines.

“I’m talking about our feelings for each other,” Edward said bluntly.

It was as if he had long expected that she would not intercede for the Nicholsons. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Candice’s eyes flickered, and she looked up at Edward. “Didn’t we walk about it that night? I don’t really care about our feelings for each other. I’m content as long as we’re a family. It doesn’t have to be a passionate love…’

“I like you.” Edward interrupted her.

Candice bit her lip.

“The reason why I like you is not to lie to Chloe, nor is it to lie to you. I really do like you,” Edward said seriously.

He did not look like he was joking. Moreover, there was no need for Edward to lie to her.

Suddenly, she did not know how to accept his feelings for her, but she had thought it through. As long as Edward did not initiate a breakup, she would not leave.

She asked, “What about Jeanne?”

What she meant was, ‘Have you forgotten Jeanne?’

Edward remained silent as Candice looked at him calmly.

In fact, she did not have much expectation of him, and she would not make a fuss over a dead woman. The point was, she really believed that it did not matter whether she liked him or not.

She said, “Edward, what we have now is great, so you really don’t have to feel guilty. My only hope is that you don’t hide anything from me. I’m not as weak as you think. As long as it doesn’t go against my principles, I can accept it.” “I do hope you can be a little weaker.” Edward’s voice was low and deep.

Candice stared at him.

“At the very least, make me feel like you need me.”

Candice chose to remain silent because she did not want to rely on anyone, especially with anything related to the heart.

Silence filled the car again, and Candice was deep in her thoughts. She figured that although they would slowly return to their original lives after Chloe’s matter and not quarrel like they were now, there would be a conflict between them. However, she always believed that time could wash away everything.

A week later, Wyatt resigned from his position as the minister of Harken due to his health issues. The control of Harken’s army was handed over to Edward. Now, Edward had complete control over the entire Harken and became one of the few leaders in Harken’s history to hold that power.

Candice was not too surprised when she read the news. From the moment Edward discovered Chloe’s scheme to the moment she acquiesced to Chloe’s actions, she had thought that Edward had other motives.

She seemed to know him very well, even though the two of them had not been

together for a long time.

Candice’s eyes flickered as she looked at the incoming call and slowly picked it up. “Dad.”

“Candice, we’re preparing to go abroad,” Wyatt suddenly said.

Candice was a little surprised. She thought that exchanging power was enough and that Edward would not go so far as to be ruthless..
