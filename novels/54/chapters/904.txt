905 The Thrill Continues, Who’s More Cunning?

“Why did you come to the wedding? You and your ex-wife are divorced. Don’t you think it’s weird you’re here?” The guards said righteously.

“How many times do I have to say it?! Do you want me to admit that I can’t let go of my ex-wife so that you will think that it’s natural for me to be here?” Finn looked at the guards coldly. “Okay. Since you insist on trampling on all my self-esteem and my pretense, I will admit in front of everyone in the banquet hall that I still like Monica and can’t accept that she’s with another man. I need to see her marry someone with my own eyes so that I can give up and let go of her completely! Is this reason sufficient?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The guards were rendered speechless by Finn’s words.

Beside Finn, Sarah’s expression changed slightly. She knew it. Finn’s purpose for coming here was because he still could not let go of her cousin.

Monica, who was sitting two tables next to him, had become a little flustered from the initial shock. She did not know Finn would be at this wedding banquet and had not expected him to come either. She always felt that they should not have any contact with each other.

So why did he suddenly appear? Why did he say…

Did he really not want to let her go?

She did not know if she should believe him. However, from Finn’s tone just now, it was clear that even though he was a little angry, he sounded sincere.

Her heart was racing, unable to control her emotions.

“Who can prove what you just said?!” The guard forced himself to respond.

“Everyone here knows that I was married to Monica, and she abandoned me for Michael!” Finn spoke intently.

As soon as he finished speaking, someone chimed in, “I can testify! Monica did abandon Finn for that scumbag, Michael.”

It was Nox.

Everyone’s eyes turned to him, but Nox did not care and was even a little excited. “Finn and Monica had been married for three years. Finn put his all into their relationship, but Monica turned around and went to Michael’s side. Finn hasn’t been able to walk out of the shadow of this relationship for a long time. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Monica!”

Monica was suddenly called out, and all eyes were back on her.

Monica bit her lip. She thought that her wedding was over and did not expect her feelings to be suddenly put on the table again.

“Monica, if you still have a conscience, you’d better tell everyone what unforgivable things you’ve done to Finn!” Nox loudly threatened Monica.

Monica gritted her teeth and mustered her courage to say, ” That’s right. I abandoned Finn. For the sake of Michael’s future, I chose to divorce Finn and pour my heart and soul into helping Michael overcome his difficulties so that he could develop in politics. So, Finn and I weren’t as emotionless as everyone thought. While it was only a marriage of convenience, I ended up hurting Finn for Michael! Now, I’m filled with regret! I didn’t expect Michael to be this kind of person. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have...”

Monica could not bring herself to say some words in front of so many people. However, she really, really regretted it. If Finn could convince himself that he still had feelings for her, she could admit her mistakes and return to his side.

Her eyes were a little red. There was a glimmer of hope left.

Her words made Sarah feel a little uncomfortable. She did not want them to get back together. She wanted to be with Finn.

“You clearly said that he’s your boyfriend!” The guards found a loophole and questioned Sarah.

Sarah stared blankly at the guard. She had been lying just now.

“In order to let go of Monica, what’s wrong with dating someone else?” Finn answered on behalf of Sarah. “I’m dating Sarah to let go of Monica. Sarah knows this very well. I’m also attending the wedding to make myself completely give up on Monica. Are there any conflicts between the two?”

“That’s right!” Sarah quickly chimed in, “I’m helping Finn let go of my cousin. I was willingly helping him move on from her!”
