Chapter 790: Monica and Michael’s Conflict Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You and Eden aren’t the same,” Monica commented.

Michael’s smile widened. “But I heard Eden ran away.”

“Is that so?” Monica did not know that, so she was a little surprised. “I thought they arrested him.”

“Insider information. However, he can run, but he can’t hide. One day, he will be brought to justice.”

“He won’t live a good life even if he runs away. Eden is used to being the young master. He won’t be able to last long out there.” Monica, on the other hand, did not care much about Eden.

“Yeah.” Michael nodded.

The two of them continued to talk about Eden, and they eventually warmed up to each other.

After dinner, Michael got the staff to clear the table and serve the dessert.

Monica also put down her phone.

Finally, they were getting to the main topic.

Monica silently cheered herself on and said, “Michael, do you want me to post on my Facebook account tomorrow that we have broken up peacefully, or do you want to post it? Or should the two of us do a post together?”

Michael, who was eating the dessert, wiped the corner of his mouth and said, “Monica, can you give me a little more time?”

“Why?”

“I’ve told you the reason.” Michael looked at her. I don’t want to make things difficult for you. I wouldn’t do this if I had a choice.”

“But I think now is the best time for us to break up.” Monica was very determined.

Michael stayed silent.

“While the news about Jenifer and Eden is everywhere, the public attention won’t be on us if we keep a low profile and break up. By the time they remember us, it’ll be so long ago. Once it’s over, it won’t have any news value, and it’ll be less widely spread. Then, we won’t be affected as much.”

“Not necessarily.” Michael denied it. “Once we break up, it’s very likely that the attention will shift from Jenifer and Eden to us, and news of them will be suppressed.”

“It won’t.” Monica did not agree with Michael’s point of view. “I’m a gossip enthusiast, and I know very well what people want to see the most now. What they want to see now is an exposé, something that gives them a sense of justice and makes them feel good. I’ve been in such a good mood these past two days. That’s why they won’t shift their attention to other news at the moment. Also, when the media sees how popular this news is, they’ll definitely seize the opportunity to keep the news trending for a few more days. They won’t take the risk to change a hot topic immediately. If we break up now, they’ll suppress our news with your connection to them, and things will calm down very quickly.”

Just as Michael was about to speak, Monica interrupted him. “I’m not spouting nonsense. I have evidence.”

Michael frowned.

Monica took out her phone and searched for a piece of news from yesterday. It was the news of her and Michael being intimate.

The headline of the news was, “Breaking the rumor: Michael and Monica are in love as usual.”

A cold glint flashed in Michael’s eyes.

That was the news he had forgotten about yesterday.

“Do you see this? With Jenifer and Eden’s news still in the headlines, this news has less than 10000 views and less than 100 comments. This means our news can’t attract the public’s attention now. They’re all immersed in the pleasure of the exposé and didn’t notice us.” Monica told Michael seriously, “We’re actually not as important as we thought. The news about us blew up before because it happened to be during the exposure period of your election. That was why it caused a sensation in all of Harken and became a hot topic. Now that we’ve kept a low profile for so long, there’s nothing breaking newsworthy about that. It’s just a peaceful breakup, and it won’t cause too much of a stir.”

Michael did not expect that the news he designed would become a reason for Monica to convince him to break up.

Monica could not read Michael’s mood either, so she continued, “Do you think it’s easy to become one of the hot topics? If it’s that easy, why would so many top celebrities spend their money and work themselves to death to get themselves trending?”

Michael chose to remain silent.

Monica thought that Michael’s silence meant that he had acquiesced.

She heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “In that case, I’ll write on Facebook tomorrow that we’ve broken up peacefully. I’ve already written a draft of the post. Take a look. If there are no problems, we can post it tomorrow morning– no, tonight. At midnight, when everyone is asleep, I’ll post it, and no one will read it.

As she spoke, Monica showed Michael her draft of the breakup post.

Michael glanced at it.

There were only five words — “We’ll go our separate ways.”

Monica said, “People these days are smart, and they should be able to guess what it is with just these few words. If we write too much, people will make a big thing out of it. When they ask about it in the comments section, we’ll act as if we didn’t see it, and after a long time, they’ll be met with a rebuff. By then, we’ll no longer be together, and everyone will figure out that we have really broken up.”

Michael looked at Monica, who was looking a little excited.

She had really thought of everything to convince him of breaking up now.

He almost could not think of a rebuttal at that moment.

In fact, he did not expect that Monica would really do all her homework. After all, Monica had never gone out of her way to research something.

His throat moved slightly before he said, “Monica, I don’t want to break up.”

The smile on Monica’s face suddenly stiffened as she looked at Michael in disbelief, thinking that she had misheard.

Michael had never made things difficult for her. Yet, at that moment, he said he did not want to break up.

“I like you.” Michael looked at Monica seriously.

The affection in his eyes was not a lie.

However, Monica was not touched at all. On the contrary, she was a little disgusted.

Did they not agree on that? Once he was on the right track, they would break up. Did he not say that he respected her choice?

Monica looked at him in a daze, still a little stunned.

“Monica, let’s start over.” Michael said, “I made you that promise before because I thought you could start over with Finn. But now that you can’t be together with him anymore, why don’t you consider us? We were once in love, and we can make up as we did before.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I don’t like you.” Monica made herself clear.

She did not want to waste any more time.

“You’ll like me,” Michael said coldly.

“I won’t.” Monica immediately stood up from her chair. She felt that perhaps she should not have discussed it with Michael. She should have just posted the breakup on Facebook.

“Monica…” Michael reached out to stop her.

However, Monica avoided him.

She walked straight to the door of the private room.

Suddenly, the door opened.

“Slap!” A tight slap landed on Monica’s face, followed by Reese’s sharp voice. “Monica, how shameless are you?!”
