All he did was talk about marriage with Zoe and then start preparing for the wedding.

As the two of them kissed passionately, everyone watched them with excitement.

When Shelly came in with another cup of water, she saw the scene and realized how Zoe could easily deceive Nox. It was because everyone here was putting on an act with Zoe.

The two kissed for a long time, and it made Zoe so shy that she leaned against Nox’s chest. Her behavior was a world difference compared to when Nox was not around.

Seeing their kiss had ended, Shelly walked over and bent down to put the water in front of Zoe. Then, she picked up two pieces of ice from the coffee table and put them in, turning the water warm.

After that, she stood up respectfully and left to stand at the side obediently, waiting for orders. What she wanted the most now was for them to call it a night as soon as possible. If not, she could not go back.

The men and women in the private room stayed for a while until around 2 a.m., people began to leave. In the end, only Nox was left, drunk on the sofa, while Zoe was nowhere to be found. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The two of them were originally together, but Zoe left with someone after that. Shelly thought she was just going to the washroom and did not expect her not to come back.

It was either she was so drunk that she had forgotten about her husband or…

she deliberately left the drunk Nox behind and went to have fun. However, what Zoe was doing had nothing to do with her.

At that moment, she knew that if Nox did not leave, she would not be able to get off work tonight. It was because the time they got off work was determined by the moment the last customer left.

As such, Shelly forced herself to wait for a while. She wondered whether Zoe

would come back after she cheated but figured the latter should be back soon. Hence, she waited for half an hour, but Zoe was still not back.

Shelly looked at the time. It was 3 a.m. in the morning! In the end, she gritted her teeth and decided not to care.

She walked toward Nox and kneeled in front of him. “Nox, get up. They’ve all left.”

Nox was unconscious and did not seem to hear her.

“Nox!” Shelly called out to him.

Considering how Nox assaulted her the last time he was drunk, this time, she would not touch him. She even kept a distance from him. However, the man in front of her seemed to be asleep and was not moving at all.

Shelly was speechless, but she then wondered if she could leave first. Just as she had that thought, she dismissed it.

If she left the guest alone in the room, her salary would definitely be deducted or she might even be fired. It was not easy for her to work in the VIP area. Not only did she have the opportunity to get tips, but she also earned a lot.

Shelly hesitated for a while. In the end, she gave in and stood up.

She was about to walk to the side and watch Nox sleep when her body suddenly jerked as the person on the sofa pulled her back and thrown onto the sofa. It was so rough that it frightened her.

Having been pinned down by Nox, she could feel that the heat on his body was abnormal. Moreover, the emptiness and desire in his eyes…

Shelly seemed to realize in an instant that Nox had been drugged.

Who drugged him? When was he drugged? Why was Nox drugged? What the hell was Zoe doing…

“Oh.” Shelly’s lips were suddenly sealed by Nox’s.

Shelly twisted her body and resisted with all her might.

It was obvious that Nox was behaving differently from the last time. Last time, he reacted based on his nature as a man and did not go out of control. This time, it was pure desire.

“Let go of me, Nox. Let go of me!” Shelly shouted.

Just as she said that, Nox kissed her again, on the lips and with his tongue. He kissed her so hard that she could not breathe.

Shelly, on the other hand, felt disgusted. She could even recall the scene of Nox kissing Zoe. When she thought of that scene, she was even more disgusted.

She pushed Nox frantically and finally pushed his lips away from hers.

She said hurriedly, “Nox, calm down. Let go of me, and I’ll help you find Zoe!”

Anyway, she had Zoe’s number..
