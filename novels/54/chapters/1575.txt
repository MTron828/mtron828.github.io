Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne smiled nonchalantly. Anyway, Nox was the kind of person who would not hold grudges. Besides, it was Edward’s problem to deal with.

She brought Monica to the sofa, where they sat. Then, she said, “Have you really let go of all your prejudice against Finn?”

“I should have.” Monica said, ‘Ever since I went on the business trip to Casterbridge, it’s like I’ve been subconsciously reminding myself that I can start over with Finn. I don’t know if it’s because of you, but I always feel that with you around, everything becomes easier for me.”

Jeanne felt a little helpless. Could Monica have gotten back with Finn because she was still alive?

“Finn cares a lot about you,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Don’t put in a good word for him. I know you were the one who helped him think of the idea for the proposal. I can’t believe I thought Finn had really come to his senses…

“It was my idea, but if he didn’t put in so much effort, would he have done all that? Finn was a reserved person. He would hide in a corner and never walk into the crowd, so it wasn’t easy for him to be willing to do that for you. He recorded the confession video last night many times. He said you cared about looks, so he was afraid you’d reject him if he didn’t look good on camera.” ..Am I such a shallow person? F*ck!” Monica was speechless.

In her mind, she tried to picture the scene of Finn recording the video again and again, and she was moved by it.

“In any case, the two of you should bury the hatchet and live your lives well.” Jeanne smiled and did not say anything else.

Monica nodded. “Actually, I really want to start over with him. Regardless of whether it’s my fault or his, I’ve decided to let go of the past. After all, I could never live in the past, even though I still held a grudge against Finn for rejecting me for a period of time. At that time, Cardellini Pharmaceutical was going through a rough patch, and Finn treated me really coldly. You have no idea know how hard it was for me. Now that I think about it, it still makes me a little angry. Since Finn likes me so much and has always liked me, how can he bear to be so indifferent to me?”

She found that Finn had too much self-control. If it were her, she would not have been so cold-blooded.

“Finn didn’t just stand by and watch, did he?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“He didn’t, but do you know I was depressed for a while? At that time, I really wanted to die. If I didn’t think how my actions would affect my parents, I would have died. Look at my wrist.” Monica showed her hand to Jeanne. “Although the scar is faint, if you look closely, you can still spot many small marks.”

Jeanne’s heart ached.

Monica had experienced many things alone to become the strong woman was now. That was also why she did not dare to give her heart to someone again.

“At that time, I really hoped that Finn would lend me a helping hand. It was not that I hoped he would help me, but I wanted to have someone to rely on… You don’t know, but for the sake of Cardellini Pharmaceuticals, I almost used my body to entertain the guests.”

Jeanne, too, had heard of how much Monica had to go through when she was not by Monica’s side. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Forget it, let’s not talk about it. It’s all in the past anyway.” Monica smiled. ‘We always have to look ahead.”

Jeanne held Monica’s hand tightly and glanced at Finn who was behind Monica. Obviously, Finn had heard everything Monica said. She could even see the pain in Finn’s eyes.

“There’s one more thing.” Monica suddenly thought of something and felt indignant.

“What else?” Jeanne asked.

Monica’s hatred for Finn ran deep, yet she still agreed to the proposal. Just how much did she love him?

“Finn is bad in bed.” Monica was very serious.

At that moment, Jeanne almost spat out the tea in her mouth. Monica’s train of thought was as… shocking as ever. Should she tell Monica that Finn was right behind her?

At the thought of that, Monica seemed to get a little agitated. “He only knows how to pleasure himself. You should know what I’m talking about..”
