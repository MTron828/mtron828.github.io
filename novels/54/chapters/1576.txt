Chapter 1577: Complaining About Finn, Nox Meets Shelly Again

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Could she say that she did not want to know what Monica meant?

“Fourth Master Swan should be pretty good, right?” Monica asked.

“He’s alright.” Jeanne did not know how to answer Monica’s question. She thought about how Edward was in bed… and her face turned red.

“I can tell from your expression that Fourth Master Yan has served you very well.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Monica.” Jeanne was speechless.

Why was so difficult to change a person’s nature?

“This matter is very important to married couples, okay? If you don’t get along, it would affect you for the rest of their lives. If Finn weren’t so bad in bed, I wouldn’t have broken up with him so easily!” Monica said seriously.

Finn must be speechless. Did it mean Monica broke up with Finn because Finn was not good in bed? Any man who heard that reason would want to kill himself.

Jeanne did not even dare to look at Finn’s expression behind Monica.

Fortunately, Finn left, probably because he could not take it anymore.

“Now that you’re back with him, don’t you feel aggrieved?” Jeanne asked after Finn left.

“I do, but I’m pregnant now, so we can’t do anything, and that’s all for now. As for after giving birth to the children…” Monica thought about the matter seriously.” I haven’t thought so far ahead yet.”

“So, if Finn doesn’t…” Jeanne still could not bring herself to say it, so she paused for a moment before continuing, “Would you think of getting a divorce again?”

“Do you really think that I take marriage as a child’s play? I’ve been divorced twice now. If I get divorced again, what would become of me?”

“Well, that’s what I’ve gathered from what you’ve said to me.”

“Divorce is impossible, but he can try to learn to be better.” Monica appeared to be very deep.

Jeanne was speechless. Perhaps only Monica would be able to talk about such matters so calmly.

The two of them chatted for a while, and the three people who left earlier returned. Nox did not look happy, which meant Edward probably could not comfort him.

As soon as Nox walked into the hall, he stared straight at Jeanne, causing her hair to stand on end. Then, in the next second, he left without looking back.

Jeanne stared at Nox from behind. “Is he angry?”

Edward nodded.

“Are you letting him go just like that? Aren’t you going to explain further?” Jeanne asked.

She felt that Edward was too cold. Nox was really devoted to him, yet he had hidden it from Nox for so long, so he should not have treated her better.

Moreover, when she thought about how Nox crippled his legs to save her… she felt a little guilty.

“He’ll be fine in two days. Don’t worry,” Edward said bluntly.

“I won’t!” Nox, who had suddenly left, ran back.

Edward pursed his lips, not expecting Nox to hear him. Hence, he felt a little embarrassed.

Nox came back to pick up the phone that had fallen on the sofa and left. Everyone stared at Nox from behind…

“Should we call him back? I’ll explain it to him,” Jeanne said. “Do you think he left because he was angry?” Edward was speechless.

“Don’t you?”

“He’s meeting Zoe’s parents to discuss the wedding tonight.”

“Oh.” Jeanne seemed to recall what Nox had just said.

“Don’t worry, he’s not that petty.” Edward consoled her so that she would not overthink it.

In fact, he was also indirectly affirming Nox’s position in his life, which had never been low! However, Nox did not think so. On the contrary, he thought he was being played by Edward!

Edward would only tell Finn everything while keeping him in the dark. Was he that untrustworthy? He was so angry!

Edward said he would be fine in two days, and the former was very wrong about that. He would never be able to recover from Edward hiding the fact that Jeanne was still alive from him.

Nox drove angrily with a ferocious expression on his face. Then, his phone rang. Nox took a look and pressed the Bluetooth button. “Zoe.” “Nox, how long will it take you to arrive?” Zoe asked him. “I’m on my way now. I’ll be there in about five minutes.”

“Alright. I was just afraid you’ll be late for the first official meeting between our parents.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not that unreliable now. Just bring your parents over.” “Okay, drive carefully on the road. Don’t rush. It’ll take us at least 20 minutes to get there..”
