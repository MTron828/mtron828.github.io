911 The Sudden Fire Rescue UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She brushed past Finn as he carried Sarah out, her body leaning weakly against Finn’s chest. It was unclear whether she was injured or just too frightened. Her body kept trembling as she clutched Finn’s clothes tightly. Sarah probably did not expect so many things to happen at a wedding and that she would be so close to dying here.

Her eyes were red. Finally, with Finn’s help, she walked out.

Finn had disappeared from her side the moment the lights went dark. She did not know where he had gone, and she was frightened and panicked.

She wanted to run out with the crowd. However, there were so many people, and the screams were endless. She was knocked to the ground several times and nearly trampled to death. So, she simply hid beside the table and waited until there were fewer people to leave.

To be honest, she was only waiting for Finn. Her first instinct had been to run for her life. However, once she calmed down, she thought about how Finn was still inside and how he would not just leave her behind. He was not that kind of person.

While people were fleeing, her parents dragged her along, but she let them go first. She told them she had sprained her ankle and would come out when there were fewer people.

Sarah was waiting for Finn inside. Now, there were fewer and fewer people around her, but Finn still had not returned. Perhaps Finn had really left on his own.

Sarah was a little upset. She thought that Finn’s confession was true. Maybe it had been for…

She had no idea, but Finn had been acting really weird today. It was like she did not know who he was anymore.

She rose from the darkness and was about to leave when the hall suddenly caught fire. It was fierce, and the entire banquet hall was instantly engulfed in flames.

She could not stop coughing due to the smoke. Through the firelight, she could see that her cousin’s family had just left the banquet hall.

They had probably been in the same dilemma as her. As they were all seated at the innermost part of the banquet hall, they were far from the exit, and it was tough to get out.

On the other hand, with her cousin’s reception dress being so complicated and the skirt so long, there was no way she could not walk out amid the chaos. Not even a step. She would only get hurt in the crowd if she tried. It was probably because there were fewer people that the family walked out of the banquet hall. However, they had only taken a few steps when they were suddenly surrounded by fire.

Everyone was shocked. The remaining people in the banquet hall, frightened by the fire, frantically ran out, as did Monica and her parents.

Monica’s skirt and high heels already made it difficult for her to walk. Now, she was walking very fast. It only took for someone to accidentally brush past her, which caused her to fall to the ground. She thought she was about to fall to her death, and everything in front of her was blurry for a while.

Gary and Ruby quickly knelt down. “Monica, are you alright?”

Monica endured the pain. She held back her tears and tried her best to get up.

She said, “It’s nothing. Let’s hurry and leave.”

Gary and Ruby did not dare to delay. They helped Monica up and hurried out.

They were halfway through the banquet hall when the ribbons, flowers, and dry grass used to make the banquet even more beautiful fell onto the ground.

“Ah!”

The remaining people at the scene all started to scream. Some of the decorations had even fallen onto the guests, and they instantly caught on fire.

Fortunately, there were still guards in the banquet hall escorting the guests. A few guards quickly used their clothes to extinguish the flames on the guests and sent them out as quickly as possible. However, they had limited manpower, meaning not everyone was able to get support. It all depended on luck.

The fire inside was getting bigger and bigger. It was getting harder for them to leave.

“Auntie!” Sarah suddenly called out as she walked behind them. She had wanted to leave with them. However, she did not expect there to be so much fire. Her skin had been scalded by fire debris fallen on her, and her dress was on fire.
