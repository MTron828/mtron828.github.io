Chapter 415: Fourth Master Swan Is Jealous

After that, she turned around and left, leaving behind everyone in the senior management meeting room angry but also speechless.

In fact, Jeanne was right.

The failure of the project had nothing to do with her personally. Everyone just thought she was rich, so it should be very easy for her to take out some money to help Lawrence Enterprise! However, it did not mean that Jeanne would definitely do it. In any case, why did Jeanne have to help the Lawrences? Was it just because she was also a Lawrence that she should help the company unconditionally? Legally, there was no such thing! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Alexander’s face was already red from holding it in.

He said fiercely, “Meeting adjourned!”

After that, he stood up and left angrily.

Joshua was also in the meeting room.

With Joshua’s position in Lawrence Enterprise, he technically did not have the right to be here. However, because he was the Lawrences’ successor, everyone had tacitly allowed his existence.

He looked at his father’s angry back and smiled evilly. Then, he followed the crowd and left the meeting room.

Upon returning to his office, he closed the door and quickly made a call to Eden. “As expected, Jeanne and my father argued during the meeting. It was so intense that my father almost died from anger!”

The person on the other end of the phone sneered.

With his current understanding of Jeanne, he knew that she would definitely not be threatened by anyone.

That was why he made Joshua deliberately lead Alexander to think that Jeanne should pay for it if the project lost money. After all, Jeanne had money.

......

As expected, Alexander really listened to him.

He thought that if Jeanne had money, he could get her to take it out. In fact, he, too, found the idea ridiculous.

“Brother-in-law,” Joshua called Eden. “Can you really kick my sister out of Lawrence Enterprise?”

“Of course!” Eden said firmly, “Based on Jeanne’s temper, she would never take out her money to make up for the losses if the project fails. Do you think the Lawrences will still allow Jeanne to stay in Lawrence Enterprise then?”

“That’s true.” Joshua nodded, “But I don’t think Jeanne is as simple as she seems anymore. What if she finds out that we were the ones who did something to the pilot project?”

“If she finds out, so be it. I’ve never thought of hiding it from her!” Eden was extremely calm. “To put it bluntly, I purposely did it so that she wouldn’t be able to profit from this project. Even if she knows I’m targeting her, what can she do?”

“Won’t your Fourth Uncle find trouble with you? After all, Jeanne’s married to him.” Joshua was a little worried.

“Did I say that I would do it personally? I can naturally find a gunman to help me with these things. You just need to help me keep an eye on Jeanne’s movements.”

“Okay.” Joshua agreed immediately.

Eden then gave some instructions before hanging up the phone.

He sat in his office with a cold expression.

No matter what, he would definitely drag Jeanne down!

That woman should not be so arrogant in front of him!

…

Jeanne walked out of the senior management meeting room.

When she returned to her office, Amy followed behind her respectfully.

“Get the project team together for a meeting immediately,” Jeanne ordered

“Yes.”

Once everyone sat in the meeting room, Jeanne asked, “What went wrong for the pilot project to have such bad results?”

Forrest said, “Everything was carried out according to your previous arrangements, President Lawrence. However, no one would have thought that while the pilot project was ongoing, an in-store bulk buying activity would launch locally. The prices of all the products were lower than the prices of the products on our e-commerce platform. Even our company’s brand, Lawrence Electrical, and our own distributors were selling at a cheaper price in-store than what’s online.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed. “Didn’t the local distributors report their in-store activities to the local branch?”

“I specifically went to ask the branch over there. They didn’t receive any response from the local distributors, so they didn’t know there would be such a large in-store bulk purchase activity. They didn’t even receive word from the local Chamber of Commerce in advance. It seemed like the activity just suddenly appeared out of thin air. And coincidentally, when our e-commerce project was officially launched for trial sale on the same day, their advertisements were everywhere.” Forrest explained, “But at that time, we already had everything in place, including the merchants’ discounts, prices, and the operation of the backend. There was no way we could make any immediate changes. I did some preliminary calculations. If we were to negotiate with the merchants about the prices, discounts, pricing, and so on, it would probably take two weeks later if things went smoothly. However, those two weeks had a huge impact on our e-commerce platform. Almost all of our sales came from the morning of the first day, and by the time the in-store bulk-buying campaign rolled out in the afternoon, we had close to no sales. Most importantly, we got tons of returns.”
