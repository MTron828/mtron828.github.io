Shelly just stared at them. Since Nox’s eyes were closed, he did not notice her.

When the elevator arrived, the woman helped him up from the wall and dragged him out of the elevator with difficulty. As the two of them walked past her, Shelly was silent for a few seconds before she held Bella’s hand and prepared to walk into the elevator.

Suddenly, Bella shouted at Nox, “Daddy.”

Shelly was so shocked that she quickly covered Bella’s mouth and led Bella into the elevator.

The moment the elevator closed, the man who was walking in the corridor suddenly turned around and saw the tightly shut elevator that carried Shelly and Bella away. At that moment, he smiled and then turned back to walk toward the hotel room.

Just as the woman helped Nox into the room, Nox pushed her out and closed and locked the door on her. The woman was stunned for a while and could not seem to react to the situation. When she came back to her senses, she quickly knocked on the door.

However, Nox pretended not to hear her. He lay on the bed alone, dizzy as he stared at the ceiling in a daze. Even if it sounded like the door was about to be broken through, he could not hear anything. The only thing on his mind was the scene of Shelly leaving coldly.

How much did Shelly not like him that she would watch him go to the room with another woman without feeling anything? He only had two months left with Shelly, and their relationship would most likely end then.

The woman knocked on Nox’s door for a long time, but in the end, it did not open. As such, she walked angrily to Mrs. Winter’s room and pressed the doorbell.

Mrs. Winter opened the door and was a little puzzled when she saw the woman.

‘Why aren’t you with Nox? What are you doing here?”

“Nox kept me out.” The woman’s eyes reddened, and she felt aggrieved.

Mrs. Winter’s expression turned ugly. She could not believe how stubborn Nox was! Was he so mesmerized by Shelly that he had lost his mind?

Based on her previous understanding of Nox, Nox had never rejected anyone. Hence, she thought the woman could get close to Nox and take the opportunity to sleep with him and get pregnant. However, her whole plan had failed. “Aunty,” the woman called out to her coquettishly. “Does Nox not like me?”

“Don’t you know Nox is drunk?” Mrs. Winter found an excuse. “Don’t worry. If I like you, my son will definitely like you. When he wakes up, I’ll introduce you to him.’

“Thank you, Aunty.”

“Thank you for helping my son to the room. You should go and get some rest.” “Alright.” The woman left, satisfied.

After she left, Mrs. Winter did not look for Nox. She thought that since only two months were left, it would not be too late to talk about it after two months.

Shelly took the elevator and left.

Monica and Finn’s babies’ celebration party was very grand, so many people attended. The entire hotel was filled with guests, and as the elevator was a little crowded, Shelly and Bella were slowly squeezed into the innermost part of the elevator.

That was when Shelly heard the gossiping voices of the two women who had just entered. “Did you see Nox just now? He’s the one who was cheated on last year and fainted at the wedding.”

“I know Nox. Apart from what you just said, he’s a big shot in the business industry. My dad often talks about him. And as you know, Nox and the Leader are best friends, so he can be considered a big name in Harken,” the woman said. “By the way, why are you talking about him?” “Do you know Mia Lane?”

“Are you talking about the young miss of the Lanes?”

“Yes.” The woman said, “I saw her helping the drunk Nox back to his room just now.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Oh, I see that woman, Mia has climbed up the social ladder and become Cinderella.”

“You sound so sarcastic. The Lanes’ assets aren’t bad either. They’re as wealthy as both our families, but they cannot compare to the Winters. So, in some way, they are climbing up the social ladder by marrying their daughter to Nox, but Nox isn’t exactly Prince Charming. After all, it will be Nox’s second time getting married.”

The woman did not give a damn about Nox.

“After all, the Winters are a traditional family. I heard that the Lanes were chosen because although their assets aren’t much, the family educates their children well. Mia is a top student who is proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. I also heard that she’s proficient in four languages.”

“I couldn’t tell from her delicate looks that she’s so talented! Are you sure what you heard isn’t fake?”
