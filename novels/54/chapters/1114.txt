1115 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

He could make better use of Jeanne.

If Jeanne were to die…

In any case, she was just bait, and her death was not worth pitying!

“I’ll send you off,” Edward said bluntly.

Kingsley looked at him coldly.

“The Duncans are increasing their manpower and will arrive in half an hour. Once they arrive, they will attack, and you won’t be able to leave!” Edward said bluntly, “These are two sets of clothes for the Duncans’ men. Who do you want to change into these?”

Since there were three other people besides Kingsley, he was not sure who Kingsley would want to change into it.

Kingsley took the clothes from Edward’s hands.

“Kerby, change into it.” He called out Kerby’s name.

Lucy was right beside Kerby.

Kerby did not expect Kingsley to give him the clothes. Everyone knew that the set of clothes was their only hope for survival, and everyone wanted it.

However, he said, “I don’t need it. Give it to Ms. Harmon.”

“She’s a woman, so she’ll be easily discovered with her figure,” Kingsley said coldly.

That was true. She was a woman, so she would be easily discovered. In that case, it was only natural that Kingsley would not give it to her.

“Kerby.” Kingsley’s face darkened. “If you don’t want it, I’ll give it to–”

“Change into it!” Lucy interrupted Kingsley and looked at Kerby sternly.

Kerby looked at Lucy.

He had never thought that he would be able to leave that place alive. In fact, he was prepared to die.

“Hurry up,” Lucy urged.

Kerby held it in. After all, assassins did not have much emotion.

Kerby quickly took off his clothes and changed into the ones he was given.

“I suggest that he puts on your clothes.” Edward pointed to another male assassin and said, “He needs to disguise himself as you to attract the attention of the people outside. Then, I will bring you guys out of here. Once you are out of their sight, you should leave immediately. I will try my best to buy you time.”

Kingsley nodded.

In all aspects, Edward was very thoughtful to immediately order the assassin to change into Kingsley’s clothes.

An assassin would listen to orders at any time, even if it meant death! Therefore, the assassin quickly put on Kingsley’s clothes to die for him.

“In a while, you’ll go this way and try to attract their attention.” Edward was giving instructions on how to prolong the life of that assassin.

The longer it took, the more time Kingsley would have to escape.

An assassin always followed the instruction given to him and never had a choice.

Lucy did not either.

She said, “I’ll go with him.

Together, they would be bait. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Edward paused and looked at Kingsley.

At that moment, Kingsley’s hand that was holding the gun trembled.

“It’s impossible for Kingsley to not have me by his side. They’ll only believe that this person is Kingsley if I show up. Then, they’ll really come after us!” Lucy said rationally.

Edward did not reply because he agreed with Lucy’s suggestion. Without a doubt, that was the best way.

Lucy had always been by Kingsley’s side. Once Lucy and the assassin in Kingsley’s disguise appeared, the other party would not hesitate to believe that the person in disguise was Kingsley. Then, they would chase after him regardless of the consequences.

Once they were lured away, it would be much easier for Kingsley to escape.

It had to be said that that was for the best.

However, he wanted to see if Kingsley was willing to let the woman who had been with him for so many years die for him.

There were two seconds of silence.

Due to the time constraint, they could only be silent for a moment. Kingsley then said, “We’ll do as Lucy said.”

As she suggested, she would go with the other assassin as bait.

Lucy nodded.

In the face of life and death, she could only face it with the calmest attitude.

Once, everything was agreed upon, Edward reminded, “Hurry up.”

He was reminding Kingsley to give the order.

Kingsley finally glanced at Lucy and watched as she whispered something to Kerby.

Kerby kept nodding his head and could not hide his emotions.

After giving a few simple instructions, Lucy left Kerby’s side.

The moment she left, Kerby pulled her back, obviously because he could not bear it. “Ms. Harmon.”

Kingsley saw all of that. He looked at the two of them, who looked like they were saying goodbye to each other.

However, there was no farewell between the assassins.

His eyes were cold. “Get ready!”

His voice was cold and emotionless.

...

Lucy pushed Kerby’s hand away and walked to the side of the male assassin.
