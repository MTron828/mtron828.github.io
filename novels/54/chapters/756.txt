Chapter 757: The Upper-Class Banquet, the Conspiracy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At night, in South Hampton City, Watsons Bay was a high-end area and a prime location

When Jeanne was at the entrance of the banquet hall, she felt as if it was daytime. The hall was so bright and filled with people.

Jeanne held Edward’s hand and walked in with the crowd.

It was the first time the two of them attended a banquet together since they got married.

She was wearing a black mermaid-tail evening gown, and the diamonds on the skirt were dazzling. Edward, on the other hand, was wearing a black tuxedo.

The broken diamonds on his collar and her mermaid tail complemented each other.

The moment they appeared, it caused a sensation. Everyone’s eyes could not help but fall on the handsome man and beautiful woman.

It was difficult to find the words to describe their good looks. In short, they were way out of anyone’s league.

In the past, they had always felt that Jeanne’s looks were gaudy and not worthy of Fourth Master Swan’s magnificence and elegance. However, when the two of them stood together, they were an extraordinary match. It was as if they would be overshadowed if no one else was around.

Under everyone’s gaze, the couple stopped in front of a man.

It was rumored that the man in front of them was 39 years old this year, but he looked surprisingly young and did not look more than 30 years old.

He had a sprightly buzz cut, a hairstyle that was difficult for anyone to pull off, but it made him look inexplicably manly.

The rumored Gates family was not one of the 12 big families in South Hampton City, but the 12 big families would still give in to the Gates. Instead of saying that the Gates was one of the richest antique collectors in the world, it would be better to say that the Gates knew a wide network of people.

The Gates relied on their antique trade to gain their network and win over various forces. Not only did they have connections with both the government and the triads, but they also knew people from all over the world and from all walks of life. As long as one had a relationship with the Gates, people would avoid them, no matter who they were.

It was probably because of the Gates’ networking ability that the Sanders were targeting William Gates.

When Jeanne first saw William Gates, he looked different from what she had imagined.

William kept a low profile and rarely showed his face in public, so Jeanne had never seen his true appearance before. She thought he was a typical middle-aged man or that he would look more mature than others. However, she did not expect the man to be so much more charming than she had imagined.

His facial features were not incredibly handsome, but it was perhaps his naturally-inherent noble aura that made people unconsciously attracted to him.

Her eyes moved slightly as she saw William reach out his hand and took the initiative to shake Edward’s hand. “Fourth Master Swan, it’s an honor to meet you.”

“Mr. Gates, it’s an honor to meet you.” Edward extended his hand.

The two of them greeted each other politely.

“And is this Mrs. Swan?” After a simple greeting, Zhong Yurong looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne was shocked.

She had attended countless banquets and had seen many high officials and noble people, but being looked at by William still made her a little nervous.

However, she could feel that his gaze was different from others.

She smiled. “Hello, Mr. Gates.”

“Mrs. Swan is indeed more beautiful in person than I thought.”

“Mr. Gates, you flatter me. You, too, look different from what I thought.”

“Is that so?” William seemed intrigued. Then, he asked with a smile, ” What kind of person would you imagine me to be, Mrs. Swan?”

“Someone with glasses, slightly longer but short hair, and a beard.” Jeanne concluded, “Someone with the temperament of an artist.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you, Mrs. Swan.” William smiled.

“No, you’re much more handsome than I thought, Mr. Gates.”

“Mrs. Swan, you’re complimenting me so much in front of Fourth Master Swan. Won’t he get jealous?” Willaim looked at Edward.

Edward laughed. “In terms of looks, I’m very confident in myself.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh as she felt that Fourth Master Swan was getting more and more shameless.

The three of them were talking, and the vibe was quite good until the Sanders suddenly showed up.

William, however, became a lot more cautious with the Sanders’ presence. He tidied his clothes slightly and stood up to greet the family.

It was the Sanders’ eldest young master, Chester Sanders, and the person beside him was not his wife but his youngest sister, Stacey Sanders, the fifth Princess of the Sanders.

Edward led Jeanne to the pastry area and carefully picked out the food for her.

In the meantime, Jeanne sized up Stacey nonchalantly and saw how shy the latter was when she was talking to William.

“Is he very handsome?” She heard a familiar male voice say.

Jeanne retracted her gaze and took the pastry from Edward’s hand. She took a bite and found it to be very sweet.
