Chapter 1649: Nox’s Heartfelt Confession

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox was angry, as with every time Shelly was cold to him.

“I’m asking you a question!” Nox questioned.

Shelly had a temper as well, and she shouted at Nox, “I just don’t want to take care of you or be ordered around by you. To put it bluntly, I don’t even want to look at you! Why don’t you hire a nurse? I’ll pay for it!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nox was stunned by Shelly’s words.

After Shelly said that, she turned around and was about to leave.

“Stop right there!” Nox called out to Shelly. “Did I say that I wanted to hire a nurse?”

Shelly gritted her teeth.

“Come here. Help me to the toilet.”

However, Shelly did not move at all.

“Hurry up and come over. I have a terrible headache. I’m afraid I’ll faint if I stand up,” Nox said matter-of-factly.

Shelly gritted her teeth and walked over to support Nox, who put most of his weight on her, almost crushing her to death. With great effort, she helped Nox into the toilet and then turned to leave. “Help me take off my pants…”

Shelly did not even listen.

“Wait outside for me. You’re not leaving!” Nox quickly shouted at the closed toilet door.

Shelly did not reply either, so Nox quickly peed and walked out of the toilet, where Shelly was waiting for him at the door.

When she saw him come out, she did not react to him walking on his own. Instead, she immediately went forward to support him to the bed. After all, she was used to Nox’s viciousness.

After lying down for a while, he wanted some water, so Shelly poured him a glass of water. Later, he wanted to watch TV, so Shelly turned on the TV and changed the channel for him.

Then, she peeled him some fruits, poured him water, changed the channel for him, helped him to the toilet… In short, she took care of Nox as if he was a

cripple until finally, he fell asleep.

Nox was asleep on the bed while Shelly was on the sofa, and the night was quiet.

Shelly was on her phone and wanted to send a message to Benjamin, but she deleted the edited message again. She believed she should not give Benjamin or herself any hope.

Just as she was about to put down her phone, a text message suddenly popped up. Stunned, Shelly quickly opened it to see that it was from Benjamin. He wrote, “Bella is asleep. Don’t worry. Take care of yourself.”

Shelly stared blankly at the message, not noticing the sudden appearance of a figure beside her.

“How long are you to take to read those few words?”

The sudden cold voice startled Shelly.

She looked up at Nox, who was close to her, and said in exasperation, “Weren’t you asleep?”

“I’m not dead. Can’t I wake up?” Nox said coldly.

Shelly knew she could not outspeak Nox, so without saying anything, she put down her phone, turned her back to Nox, and closed her eyes to sleep. Seeing that, Nox held himself back from saying what he wanted to say and returned to the bed.

After a long day, Shelly fell asleep quickly, but Nox, on the other hand, could not fall asleep. At the thought of Shelly and Benjamin… ‘Damn, what a pain in the *ss.’

He tossed and turned a long time before he called out to Shelly, “Shelly.”

As he could not sleep, he wanted to wake Shelly up. However, Shelly did not respond to him.

“Shelly,” Nox called her again.

Still, Shelly did not respond, which made Nox a little angry. He got out of bed and walked to the sofa, only to see that Shelly was sound asleep and her breathing was very even.

The moment Nox wanted to shake her awake, he suddenly stopped himself because he could not bear to do it. He cursed to himself, not knowing when he started caring so much about Shelly, that scourge.

He looked at her quietly for a long time. He admitted that he was obsessed with looks and liked good-looking people, but… did he have to like Shelly, out of all people?

Even if she had done plastic surgery, there were plenty of good-looking women out there. How did he fall in love with her?

Looking at her sleeping, he seemed so infatuated that… he could not help but move closer to Shelly’s cheek and kiss her on the lips. When their lips touched, Nox’s heart was racing, and he was so nervous that he felt as though his heart was about to jump out of his chest.

He had been with countless women before but had never been so excited about anyone before. At that moment, he was not only excited, but his body was also reacting intensely to it..
