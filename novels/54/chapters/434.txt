Chapter 435: The Swan Enterprise’s Senior Management Meeting, Confronting Eden Swan

One more day of delay would mean another day of loss.

She was certain that it was Eden behind the matter, but she had to be absolutely certain so she could tear Eden apart in front of all the Swan Enterprise’s higher-ups tomorrow.

“I’ll get Mr. Teddy to pick me up.” George agreed.

“Thanks. I’ll forward the things I need to your phone.” Jeanne said.

“Okay.” George nodded obediently.

After hanging up, George did not even think about asking for a leave from his teacher.

He just left his seat and walked out of the school classroom.

As he walked, he called Teddy. “Mr. Teddy, I need to get something done at home. Please come pick me up.”

“Okay,” Teddy quickly agreed.

Teddy did not know when it started but his duties went from attending to Edward’s needs to now George’s.

...

5:30 p.m.

Jeanne got off work on time.

......

After figuring out the reason for the e-commerce pilot project, she decided to head home.

She went downstairs where she was greeted by a clear view.

It was rare that Edward was not in sight.

That man! Does he only pick her up when he feels like it?

Fine.

It seemed that Jeanne was starting to get used to Edward’s presence.

She sat in the car and stared at the streets of South Hampton City indifferently.

Miles looked at her through the rearview mirror and said, “Mr. Thorn said that the hair sample of Fourth Master Swan has been obtained. He wants you to get a sample from Old Master Swan as soon as possible.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly in annoyance.

That was easier said than done. If she’s not careful enough, she would be exposed.

However, she still replied, “I understand.”

The car arrived at the bamboo garden.

Jeanne thought that Edward might be working overtime tonight, and that was why he did not come to pick her up from work. However, she saw that Edward was already sitting on the sofa when she walked into the hall, with George sitting beside him. The two of them looked serious.

Jeanne was surprised by the scene.

When Edward and George saw that Jeanne had returned, they also had a surprised look on their face.

They did not expect her to leave work on time.

“You’re not working overtime tonight?” Edward asked.

“I won’t work overtime after I’m done with my tasks. I’m not a workaholic.” Jeanne said as she sat on the sofa.

At that moment, Teddy was busy preparing dinner for them.

“Then head upstairs and shower. You’ll feel more comfortable,” Edward suggested.

Jeanne frowned.

She had a feeling that there was something fishy going on between Edward and George. She thought about it for a moment.

In the end, she decided not to disturb them so she got up and headed upstairs.

Only Edward and George were left downstairs.

The two of them stared at each other.

Edward said, “Name your conditions.”

It was the tone of a business meeting.

George replied, “Give my mother back to me.”

“Don’t even think about it.” Edward retorted,

“Then don’t even dream about it.” George said, his small face filled with determination.

George had just finished the things that his mother wanted when Fourth Master Swan returned in the afternoon.

When Edward returned, he asked George to come downstairs and told him he had something to ask of him.

The two of them sat on the sofa and negotiated.

Fourth Master Swan asked George to fix the loopholes in Swan Enterprise.

But George was not willing.

“George,” Edward said sternly.

George gave him the same look in return.

“Do you know who will suffer the greatest loss if you do this?” Edward asked.

George continued staring at him. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Your mother. She owns 8% of the shares of Swan Enterprise. If you let something happen to Swan Enterprise because of your stubbornness, your mother’s finances will suffer a loss.”

George said, “My mother said that she can afford to squander that small amount of money.”

“Did your mother tell you that?” Edward looked at George.

“She did. She said that as long as I’m happy, I can do whatever I want.”

Edward clenched his teeth.

He had never thought that the dignified Fourth Master Swan of South Hampton City would one day fall on the hands of a little brat.

He never imagined that he would lower his voice just to negotiate with a brat.

The worst was that this little brat had a look of disdain on his face.

“Fourth Master Swan.” George called out to him.

Edward frowned slightly. That address was no good. He swore he’ll change that.

“Actually, I’ll agree to it.” George suddenly relented.

Edward looked at George.

He had felt that George looked like a bookish person. In truth, he was a cunning boy.

“How did you treat me when we first met?” George said.

“When we first met?” Edward did not understand.

“You asked me to wash the dishes, clean the floor and do laundry.”

“...” That brat. He’s vengeful.

“One week.” George stretched out a finger. “If you do these chores for a week, I promise I’ll fix the loopholes in Swan Enterprise.”

Edward stared at George.

“An eye for an eye. My mother said that it’s only fair.” George said and laughed.
