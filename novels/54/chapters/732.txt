Chapter 733: Warmth: Do You Know Why We Raise Pigs?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hey, where are you going? My grandfather told me to come and look for you. Then, we will go to Old Master Swan’s place together and tell him about the failure of our trip to the old and remote town,” Nox shouted at Edward.

“We’re not going now.”

“When are we going?”

“We will go after I’m fed.”

Why did Nox feel that Edward was referring to something dirty?

He looked at Edward, looking like a “good husband and a loving father”, and suddenly felt goosebumps all over his body.

It was simply too scary.

He would never, in his life, be like Edward.

With that, he turned around and continued to eat his eggs on toast.

As he ate, he turned his head to look at George, who was giving him a death stare.

“Yours?” Nox asked.

If not, whose is it?

“I didn’t eat breakfast,” Nox explained.

Did George eat breakfast?

“Get your dad to make you another plate later.” Nox did not feel guilty at all and started to eat again.

After all, that was made by Edward himself, and he might not be able to eat it again in his life. Hence, he did not want to miss it.

F*ck. He was acting like he was gay for Edward.

With that, he ate with righteous indignation.

“Bro,” George suddenly called out to him.

Nox was stunned for a long time. “What did you call me?”

“Bro.” George enunciated each word. “Otherwise, should I call you little bro?”

F*ck.

Nox was a little angry at how his seniority suddenly seemed to have dropped. He could not believe he was the same generation as a six-year-old brat.

“What’s the matter?” Nox answered casually.

“Is it good?” George asked. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s good.” Nox deliberately flashed George a proud smile.

“Anyway, I don’t like the food Fourth Master Swan makes.” George acted as if it did not matter.

“That’s because you don’t know how to appreciate it. Your father has never cooked.” Nox ate his food happily.

“Take your time to eat.” George climbed down from the dining chair.

Nox wolfed down his food and responded.

“By the way.” George said as he left, “I just spat into it.”

Nox froze.

“Because I didn’t want to eat his food, I spat. I was going to throw it away, but seeing that you like it so much, you should eat more,” George said sincerely.

That was when Nox’s stomach began to churn, and at the thought of it, Nox vomited. “Ugh.”

George smiled evilly.

Nox could not beat Fourth Master Swan or vent his anger on others.

After Nox vomited, he turned to look at George. “Why didn’t you say so earlier? C-Can you not be so disgusting?”

Nox wiped his lips fiercely. His entire face was red with anger.

“I was actually... lying to you.” George smiled a harmless smile.

“But now that you’ve vomited it out, it should be inedible.” George glanced at Nox’s bowl.

Nox was exasperated.

At that moment, he had a reason to suspect that George had done it on purpose. George was deliberately taking revenge on him for stealing his breakfast.

That little brat was really sinister, just like a certain someone.

“Let’s go out for breakfast,” George suggested.

Nox was stunned.

At the end of the day, that little brat, George, wanted him to take him out for because he had not eaten breakfast.

Holy sh*t. That little brat’s scheme was too scary. He had plotted against him in minutes and then succeeded in achieving his goal.

When he grew up, would he not be the second Edward? No. It was very likely that the student would surpass the master.

In the end, Nox brought George out for breakfast.

As for Edward, Nox believed there was no way the former would return downstairs in a short while. After all, it would take a long time to feed him.

In fact, Edward had never thought of going to his father’s place today. If he wanted to go, he would wait for Jeanne to go to work tomorrow.

During that two-day weekend, he did not want anyone to disturb their family of three.

George protested. ‘What family of three?’

In the bedroom, Jeanne really wanted to sleep. She did not want anyone to disturb her at all.

“Be good. Eat something before you sleep.” Edward’s gentle voice urged her by her ears.

She really wanted to kill him.

As such, she opened her eyes angrily and saw Edward holding a plate of eggs on toast, sitting in front of her with a pure and innocent look on his face.

All of her anger suddenly disappeared when she saw Edward, who looked like a housewife at that moment.

Where the hell did the big bad wolf from last night go?
