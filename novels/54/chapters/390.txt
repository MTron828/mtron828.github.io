Chapter 391: Escape from Danger: Don’t Leave Me Behind, Finn Translation

Just now, Nox said that there was no danger here. Did that mean that the people who came to kill them were all dead?

Then, her eyes widened in shock as she saw another body, and it was gruesome to look at.

In an empty space, it looked unbearably hideous.

She paused for a moment but still gritted her teeth and walked over eventually.

Her eyes narrowed.

She squatted down and carefully observed the body, looking at its neck…

Suddenly, her body jerked. She turned around to see that not far from her, the leaves were swaying.

There was no wind at the moment, so… it was either an animal or a person.

In short, it was a living being.

She started to feel nervous.

She did not know whether Nox’s so-called “no danger” really meant that there was no danger, but she raised the pistol, loaded it, and walked over vigilantly.

Her forehead was dripping with sweat.

Gritting her teeth, she suddenly kicked away a large leaf in front of her.

......

The moment she aimed her pistol, she felt like she could not breathe because she saw Edward.

His entire body was trembling, and his expression was ferocious. He looked nothing short of... very terrifying.

However, at that moment, Jeanne was not afraid at all. She had even forgotten Nox’s warning and wanted to walk directly toward Edward.

From yesterday’s separation to today, so much time had passed.

She could not believe that she wished for him to be alive more than she thought.

Just as she walked over, Nox suddenly called out to her, “Jeanne!”

Jeanne’s body froze, and she stopped in her tracks.

The moment she stopped, Nox pulled her back.

Jeanne looked at Nox and then at Edward. At that moment, in front of them, it looked like there was no focus in the man’s eyes.

‘What happened?’ Jeanne looked at Nox. ‘What happened to Edward?’

How did he suddenly become like that?

“You stay further away.” Nox left her with those words before he walked toward Edward.

Just as he leaned over, Edward suddenly kicked Nox fiercely.

Nox had expected it, so he managed to block it. However, Edward still kicked him to the ground.

Then, Edward attacked Nox crazily. His speed was fast and violent.

Under Edward’s mad behavior, Nox could only dodge continuously. He could not even raise his hand.

Edward’s current appearance, his current ferocious appearance… was like a beast’s.

As if his mind was blank and he could not think, he just kept on fighting and attacking like he was mad.

How could that be? How could a person become like that?

It was as if he was a completely different person.

Even if a person was forced to a certain state or driven mad, they would not lose their rationality like that. Not only was it about losing rationality, but the strength that he unleashed was not something that an ordinary person could do. Jeanne looked at Edward’s kick.

It was just a kick.

The kick was aimed at Nox’s leg, but because Nox dodged, the kick landed on the trunk of a big tree.

The big tree shook, and then… It fell down.

No.

Was Edward human?

He clearly was not anymore, and the way he lost his sanity made Jeanne really scared.

She could even see the muscles on his entire body bulging ridiculously. It was so exaggerated that she thought his body was about to explode from not being able to withstand the power in his body!

“Jeanne, think of a way to knock out Fourth Master Swan!” After dodging for a while, Nox’s body finally started to fail him.

However, from Edward’s current appearance, it was clear that the effects of the medicine had not worn out.

If it did not wear out…

Nox gritted his teeth. He could only use the most extreme method to calm Edward down.

“Jeanne!” Nox called out to Jeanne loudly.

By then, Edward had already beaten Nox to the ground.

Jeanne snapped back to her senses. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She gritted her teeth, looked left and right, and picked up a rock on the ground. After that, she went over and held the rock at the back of Edward’s head, daring to get close to him.

At that moment, Edward suddenly turned her body and faced Jeanne.

At a close distance, Jeanne could sense Edward’s danger and felt the vicious aura that erupted from his entire body.

He looked at her fiercely.

The next second, he moved his hand.

Jeanne saw the stone in her hand fly far away, and her palm was trembling because of his strength.

That was when a hint of fear washed over her.

She looked at Edward’s ferocious and terrifying look with his veins exposed, feeling that Edward might kill her in the next second.

Her fear made her extremely tense and nervous. Sweat kept dripping down her forehead.

Her eyes narrowed as she looked at Edward, who suddenly made a move.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and intended to catch it.

However, in the next second, she saw Edward suddenly turn around as if trying to use his remaining rationality to make him stop.

After that, he continued to use self-harm to make himself stop being violent.

Jeanne simply looked at Edward venting his emotions madly on the tree trunk. From the looks of his body, he looked like he was on the brink of exploding.

If that went on, she had a feeling that Edward would kill himself

She even saw Edward holding a stone and wanting to smash it down on her head.

At that, Jeanne pounced forward fiercely and used her hand to block Edward’s head fiercely.

As a result, the stone smashed into her hand. For a moment, she felt that her entire body was numb from the pain.

Nox, who was lying on the ground, looked at Jeanne’s appearance and crawled up in fright, intending to take Jeanne away from Edward.

However, Jeanne suddenly hugged Edward tightly.

She hugged his unbelievably stiff body, which was due to the tension in his muscles.

“Edward, it’s me. I’m Jeanne. Calm down, calm down!” Jeanne shouted.

She hugged Edward tightly with all her strength!
