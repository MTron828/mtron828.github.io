Edward pursed his lips. Of course, he would not make things difficult for Jeanne, but he was a little disappointed. As expected, Jeanne was much more difficult to deal with after recovering her memories.

In the quiet dining room, Edward’s phone suddenly rang. However, Edward did not even look at it. Instead, he looked at her and then ate slowly. It felt as though Jeanne was his appetizer and he could not eat without looking at her. ‘Your phone is ringing.” Jeanne could not stand it anymore and reminded him.

“It’s not important,” Edward said bluntly.

Jeanne frowned. “Don’t you want to see who it is?”

“Nobody matters.”

“What if it’s an official matter?” It could be something related to national affairs.

“It’s not important.”

“Do you want to be a fatuous ruler?” Jeanne could not help but complain.

At that moment, she did not know how to describe what she felt about Edward having become the Leader of Harken. She did not expect that after so many years, Edward would take the position.

In that case, what about Alex? Where had Alex, who had once risked his life for him, been sent to? Was he dead or…

“If you like, I can be one too.” Edward’s eyes were filled with determination.

Jeanne almost choked. Nobody would want to be the witch who brought disaster to the country and the people. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Jeannie,” Edward called her name affectionately.

Jeanne, who was originally a little flustered and exasperated, felt a little emotional when she heard him call her “Jeannie” gently. It felt as if a lifetime had passed since he called her that.

“I love you,” Edward confessed.

His large hand was holding her small hand tightly in his palm, and her hand was warm.

Jeanne’s heart raced. She could not believe that after so many years and having two children together, the man could tease her until her face turned red.

“If you don’t eat, I won’t love you anymore!”

She thought she sounded very domineering, but she sounded like she was flirting with him.

Edward looked at Jeanne and laughed heartily. He did not have a sunny personality, but at that moment, he was radiating with joy.

Jeanne shifted her gaze away.

Edward said, “Jeannie, thank you.”

He was thanking her for returning.

Jeanne, however, remained cold, not wanting to be led by Edward. Between their dynamics in the relationship, he was clearly inferior. However, he controlled everything. He was clearly pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger. She was completely under his control.

After a long time, Edward finished his meal. In the end, he did not pick up the call or even looked at it. He explained to her that even if the sky fell today, he would not leave her side. Therefore, no one could disturb their reunion.

She wanted to say that they had only been separated for three days but then realized it was three years.

When George came out of his room for dinner, he began to regret persuading his mother to forgive his father, especially when he saw how possessive his father was.

He remembered the year when they lived together as a family of three. That year, not only did he not find his biological father, but he also lost his biological mother. He became the air between them, and it was the same now.

He went downstairs and deliberately made some noise, but the two of them on the sofa did not even look at him. Then, he sat next to them, trying to get their attention. However, his father blocked his mother’s view and hugged his mother tightly.

Could George say that he was rendered speechless by his father?

In the few years without his mother, he had lived like a robot. Other than forcing a smile at Paige, he had no other expressions.

Now, his father was hugging his mother now was like hugging the whole world.

George’s eyes hurt just looking at them, and he swore would never be like his father.

“George,” Jeanne suddenly called out to him.

George’s expression lit up expectantly. He was clearly the younger version of Edward.

“Get me a glass of water,” Jeanne said lazily.

Edward was hugging her so tight that she felt like she was suffocating. However, she could not push him away, and it made her furious.

“Alright.” George went to get water.

He had completely forgotten that he had just said that he would never become like his father.

Below Cardellini Enterprise’s building, Finn sat in the driver’s seat, and in the back seat was Paige.

Finn had specially placed a child’s seat in his car, and Paige’s chubby calves were swaying in the seat..
