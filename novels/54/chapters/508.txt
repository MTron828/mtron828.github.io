Chapter 509: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction...

Translation

Before she could speak, she heard Finn moan again. It was clearly a very erotic tone.

Then, after a few seconds, Finn seemed to have regained his senses. However, his hand was still holding hers, and he was still looking at her.

Just like that, the two of them froze.

Monica did not know why she would be seduced by Finn. At that moment, she felt like she could not move because if she did, she would ruin something good for Finn.

Only after a while did Finn let go of Monica.

Monica took a deep breath, thinking, ‘Was I being stared at just now? Damn it! Finn is too evil.’

Her breath was heavy, and her face was still inexplicably hot.

“Monica,” Finn called out to her.

His tone was cold. Compared to the hot man just now, he seemed like a completely different person.

However, she still liked the earlier Finn more.

She said, “You’re awake?”

“Wipe my body for me,” Finn instructed.

“Haven’t I done that today?” Monica was displeased.

......

Had she not wiped his body three times when she woke up that morning?

She was excited about it at first, but after that… Finn was too demanding, so every time she wiped him down, she would be exhausted.

Now, she finally understood why Finn could be so clean even though he had not showered for half a month.

“Just do it when I tell you to.” Finn seemed to be in a bad mood.

Monica glared at Finn and was a little angry too.

He was fine when he was asleep, so why was his temper so bad now that he had woken up?

Did that *sshole have two faces?

Monica cursed in her heart, but in the end, she lifted the blanket and got out of bed.

After telling the nurse to fetch a basin of water for her, she lifted Finn’s blanket, only to be stunned.

Finn’s pants… What the hell was that?

Finn was completely taken aback by Monica’s gaze.

He asked, “Haven’t you seen it before?”

“Never.” Monica looked at it carefully.

Finn said, “If you think it’s dirty, I’ll do it myself.”

“Finn.” Monica looked at his face.

She could tell that the man was feeling utterly embarrassed, yet he could make himself look normal with that fierce expression of his.

“Why haven’t you been like this even though I’ve been with you for so many days? Yet, Patsy came today, and this is what happens!” Monica forced the words out through her gritted teeth.

Finn really felt that it was hard to deal with an unreasonable woman.

“Who did you dream about just now?” Monica asked angrily.

At that, Finn’s face turned red again. The embarrassment he had been holding back was now exposed before Monica.

Who did he dream about? Who else could he dream about?

A series of images appeared in his mind.

He said, “This is a normal physiological phenomenon for men.”

“Don’t lie to me. I’m not good at anything, but I’m especially good at physiology...” Monica looked serious.

“Monica!” Monica was driving Finn mad.

“What?”

“I said I dreamed of Monica!” He dreamed of Monica helping him…

Finn was exasperated. He felt that Monica would piss him off to death one day.

Monica looked at Finn and his flushed-red face, not knowing whether he was embarrassed or angry.

Anyway, she loved him, so she said, “If I knew you wanted me to help you–”

“Don’t talk!” Finn told her to shut up.

With that, Monica stopped talking.

However, throughout the entire process of wiping him down, she was in a good mood.

Monica felt that from now on, she and Finn would love each other for the rest of their lives. Then, they would have many grandchildren, and they would be very, very happy…

At night, before they went to sleep, Monica looked at a text message on her phone.

“8 a.m. tomorrow morning, is that okay?” It was from Michael.

Monica pursed her lips and replied with one word, “Okay.”

After that, she put down the phone.

At night, the ward was not too dark as there was always a warm lamp light shining.

The moment Monica leaned into Finn’s embrace, Finn’s body tensed up again.

Now, Finn was really afraid of Monica.

Monica said, “I’ll be leaving the hospital tomorrow morning for a bit.”

“Huh?” Finn raised his eyebrows.

“I’ll go back and pack some clothes. I don’t want to be in a hospital gown every day.”

“Okay.” Finn nodded.

“I’ll also get you a few more pairs of underwear.”

Finn’s expression changed slightly.

“I’m afraid you won’t have enough,” Monica purposely said.

She even smiled after she said it.

Finn’s face darkened, and with great difficulty, he turned his body over to face his back to Monica.

He was obviously angry.

Hence, Monica leaned over, stuck herself against his back, and hugged his strong waist.

Finn had a really good body.

She could not imagine that the muscles under a doctor’s white coat could be so perfect.

She buried her head in his back.

In fact, she felt that she should not hide from Finn that she was actually going to see Michael’s father tomorrow.

However, she did not want Finn to misunderstand her.

It had not been easy for their relationship to develop to this stage, and she did not want to cause a rift in their relationship because of some unnecessary misunderstanding.

If she cared a lot about Patsy, she figured he would also care about Michael.

Moreover, she had thought it through. By helping Michael this time, she would owe him a little less next time.

In any case, she would never be able to be together with Michael again. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Therefore, after thinking it through, Monica was not worried anymore and calmly fell asleep with Finn.
