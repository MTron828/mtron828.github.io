Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is it that funny?” Nox gritted his teeth and asked.

At that moment, he even saw the words “Nox Got Cuckolded” on Shelly’s phone screen. Therefore, he knew what Shelly was laughing about. She was laughing at him for being cuckolded so badly!

Nox’s voice startled Shelly. She raised her head and saw Nox’s grim face facing her like he wanted to strangle her.

Shelly shuddered and figured she had to be more careful when he saw others make a fool of themselves in the future. After all, it would be awkwvard if she was discovered.

The two of them looked at each other for a few seconds. Just as Shelly was about to shift her gaze away, Nox snatched her phone away. Shelly’s expression changed. “What are you doing?”

‘What are you looking at?” Nox said coldly. Shelly was speechless. “It’s not what you want to see anyway.”

“It’s none of your business!” Nox glared at Shelly.

Shelly ignored him. Anyway, if Nox wanted to torture himself, it was his business. She was even hoping that he would be angered to death.

In the quiet space, Shelly focused all her attention on Bella and ignored Nox.

Nox had been able to control himself from not watching the news as he, too, knew that nothing good would come out of it. However, when he saw the

news…

‘F*ck.’ Nox felt like his heart attack was about to relapse! Was he that f*cking funny? What the hell were those commen ts?

Nox immediately uninstalled the news application and threw the phone at Shelly.

Shelly was shocked by Nox’s sudden action. Although she caught the phone with both hands, it hurt a little when the phone hit her palm. However, she held her tongue.

She did not want to argue with Nox since it was useless anyway, and she might as well get rid of Nox as soon as possible.

To be honest, she felt that the Nox in the news was much cuter than the Nox in real life. As for the Nox in real life… she just wanted to stay as far away from him as she could.

“Let me tell you, Shelly, don’t think you can laugh at me just because I’ve been cheated on. Even if I’ve been cheated on, there are still many women who like me, and I can still find many women who are better.” Nox lost his temper, and for some reason, he was venting his anger all on Shelly.

Shelly was speechless.

Fortunately, before she could say anything, she heard a young father in the next room berate them, “This is the hospital. If you want to quarrel, go home. Don’t disturb my daughter’s rest!”

Shelly pursed her lips, and Nox was also a little unhappy about being scolded. Looking at the little girl sleeping on the bed beside him, he held himself back and did not say anything else. Meanwhile, Shelly remained silent and said nothing about Nox being cheated on.

Nox was inexplicably furious. Whether Shelly laughed at him or not, he would not be happy, and he did not know why he was so frustrated.

He could not help but speak again, but his voice was much lower. “Why aren’t you saying anything?”

“There’s nothing much to say,” Shelly said coldly.

Her eyes were fixed on Bella, and she did not even spare a glance at Nox.

Nox was furious. “Shelly, can you not be such a hypocrite? Do you think I don’t know what you’re thinking just because you don’t say anything? You must feel very happy knowing that I’ve been cheated on, right? That this day has finally come for me? That I didn’t want you back then, and now I’m being cheated on?

Are you happy?

“I’m not that childish.” Shelly sounded a little impatient. “Besides, you and I have nothing to do with each other. What happens to you is your business. I don’t think it affects me. It’s just that the netizens’ comments are a little funny, so I laughed.”

“Stop lying to me! I know what you’re thinking. You’re over the moon now, aren’t you?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What’s there to be happy about?” Shelly said to Nox. “That’s your business. It has nothing to do with me.”

“Now that I’ve been cuckolded, Zoe and I will never be together.” Nox was still very certain. “That must be what you’re thinking!”

Shelly did not want to waste her breath on Nox. However, Nox could be too cocky sometimes, and she had no choice but to make things clear to him. After all, overconfidence was not a good thing..
