1061 Crushing Michael (Confirmed To Be A Sc*mbag)

She said, “Anyway, Cardellini Enterprise has a lot of drugs in stock, and since the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals won’t want to buy from us, the drugs are just going to be left there. Even if Cardellini Enterprise declares bankruptcy, these drugs won’t be worth much under Michael’s suppression. Instead of wasting them like this, I want to distribute these drugs for free in the name of Cardellini Enterprise’s public welfare. I’ve got someone to investigate the matter, and it’s not that there’s no market for Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s drugs, but because no one is selling them. If it’s free, many people will want it. As to the fact that our products are similar to that of Sunny Pharmaceutical, I only found out today that they are exactly the same. Since it’s exactly the same, we’ll naturally reduce Sunny Pharmaceutical’s sales by giving out our medicine. This way, we can also deal a blow on their products.”

As Nox listened, he pondered over Monica’s idea.

“It’s to go against Michael with the mentality of a life-and-death struggle.” Monica was very straightforward.

Nox was silent for a few seconds before he said, “I think that can do.”

Monica looked at Nox, still surprised that he would support her. After all, she was clearly courting death now.

Once Cardellini Enterprise started to distribute medicine for free, it would be really difficult for them to recover their capital. Without funds, Cardellini Enterprise would be screwed.

“The pharmaceutical companies and hospitals are all under Michael’s control, so it’s impossible for you to work with them. The only way to solve the problem is to give the drugs to the user. Of course, the drugs will be given away for free, but you’ll be able to earn back some reputation. Once your reputation goes up, it will be slightly easier to re-develop Cardellini Enterprise.” Nox looked at Monica and asked her, “How big is your working capital gap now?”

“It’s neither big nor small. Cardellini Enterprise’s biggest problem right now is that money is only going out and not in. If this continues, we’ll run out of money no matter how much we have.”

“I’ll give you 1 billion for you to play. Is that enough?” Nox asked.

Monica looked at Nox, thinking that she had misheard.

Was it 1 billion or 1 million?

“I’ll transfer 1 billion to your account each time. Before I get the evidence, you don’t need to make a profit. Just take this 1 billion and mess with Sunny Pharmaceutical until they die. After I take Sunny Pharmaceutical to court, I’ll reorganize Cardellini Enterprise.”

“You’re not joking with me, are you?” Monica still could not believe it.

“Do you think I have nothing better to do other than come here and joke with you?” From Nox’s current expression, it was clear how much he hated Monica.

“In that case, why are you giving me so much money?”

“I’ve been entrusted with a task, and I’ve done it faithfully.” Nox gritted his teeth.

If Finn had not called him in the middle of the night yesterday, he really would have just stood by and watched the whole situation unfold.

At most, he would just follow Jeanne’s instructions and get rid of Michael. There was no need to meddle in Cardellini Enterprise’s business.

“Who is it?” Monica was surprised.

At that moment, she was still a little nervous and perhaps a little excited.

“Jeanne,” Nox spoke bluntly.

Monica was stunned for a second, but immediately after, she was relieved. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Who else in the world would treat her so unconditionally other than Jeanne?

Hence, at that moment, she was neither surprised nor did she reject it. She had no way to repay Jeanne for all the good she had done for her, so she could only silently accept it.

“Alright.” Monica said, “During this time, I will try my best to regain the reputation that Cardellini Enterprise had taken a beating and lost.”

“I won’t interfere too much in the internal affairs, but I’ll let you know if I have any news.” Nox did not waste his breath on anything else other than work.

It was also Monica’s first time seeing Nox’s work attitude.

In the past, she had heard that many of the Swans’ businesses were supported by the Winters. Although Nox did not work often, he was the one who solved many things. She used to think that it was just a rumor, but now, she knew that Nox was much more capable than she thought.

She and Nox both loved to fool around, but she was the only one who was useless.

“Nox,” Monica suddenly called out to him.

“What?” Nox raised his brows.

“Will Jeannie come back?” She asked him.

Having completely lost contact with Jeanne, she did not know how Jeanne was doing or where Jeanne had gone.

She knew that there were a lot of things Jeanne could not control, but at least she could feel a little more at ease if she knew how Jeanne was doing.

“I really can’t answer you.” He really did not know.

After all, Jeanne had returned to the Delta Islands.
