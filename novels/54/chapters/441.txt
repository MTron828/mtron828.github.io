Chapter 442: Humiliating Eden In Public

He kept suppressing the anger in his heart.

Rather than saying he could not accept Jeanne flaunting her power in front of him, what he could not accept even more was the fact that after Jeanne abandoned him…

That was right.

It seemed like he was the one who abandoned Jeanne back then, but in reality, Jeanne was the one who chose to abandon him. If Jeanne had endured it back then, they could still be together, but she chose to fight to the death.

All these years, he had always wanted Jeanne to submit to him completely.

However, after Jeanne had abandoned him, she seduced his Fourth Uncle, whom the entire South Hampton City, including him, was afraid of.

His Fourth Uncle even spoiled her so much that she was now lawless!

He could not accept that Jeanne was living such a good life after she abandoned him!

He looked at Jeanne coldly as she said calmly, “I have evidence!”

The moment she said that, Eden felt a chill down his spine. He thought he was meticulous in doing things but was also afraid that he left some traces behind.

Despite that, he just looked at Jeanne without batting an eyelid.

All he could do now was wait and see.

Jeanne said, “To subsidize the merchants a normal profit for the Minze District’s in-store bulk-buying campaign… According to the current transaction situation, the amount of subsidy needed for a month’s sales will be 300 million. Of course, with small profits and high sales, the merchants will also give out a part of the profit. According to the principle of 88 percent discount in the market, it will add to 264 million.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So, Director Lawrence is trying to say that I took out 264 million and gave charity to the Chamber of Commerce in Minze District?” Eden asked somewhat sarcastically.

“Yes,” Jeanne replied.

Eden smiled again and said, “During this time, none of the projects that Swanhaven Bank loaned from were 264 million yuan. I can even provide an internal financial account of Swanhaven recently. To say the least, if the charity fund exceeds 50 million dollars, I have to apply for approval from the headquarters, which is my Fourth Uncle. I don’t have such authority to allocate funds privately. Even if I allocate funds privately, the loan will not go through. Director Lawrence, before you’re familiar with the internal procedures of Swan Enterprise, it’s best not to make irresponsible remarks. It will make people think you’re very unprofessional and... unreasonable.”

Eden looked confident.

He believed that Jeanne was deliberately threatening him on such an occasion, thinking that he would panic and admit it just like that in front of so many people!

She was simply underestimating him. Since he could do such a thing, he had long been prepared!

He looked at Jeanne coldly.

He could take that opportunity to slap his Fourth Uncle in the face!

If it were not for his Fourth Uncle indulging Jeanne, Jeanne would not be so arrogant!

Jeanne was about to speak, but Henry could not hold it in any longer.

At first, his heart was pounding nervously. After Jeanne accused his son so firmly, he felt a little guilty. He was afraid that his son would have really done something that would go against the company’s principles. However, at that moment, seeing how confident his son was, he also believed that Jeanne was deliberately framing Eden. Hence, he could not help but stand up for his son.

He said, “I’m not saying these words because I’m Eden’s father. I think that, with my understanding of Eden, he would not do such an arduous and unrewarding thing. Eden would not be so reckless. Moreover, a 264 million charity fund is a huge investment, and Eden really doesn’t have the authority to do so. Sister-in-law, in front of all the senior management, I might as well tell you that the funds allocated by Swanhaven Bank aren’t something that can be simply signed and sealed. After the approval process, they need to be approved by the system. Doing it manually is impossible. Simply put, if Edward didn’t sign and approve the funds through the system, the funds would not be allocated.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne looked at Henry.

“I don’t blame you if you don’t know. After all, you don’t work at Swan Enterprise, and you don’t know that our internal procedures are so strict. A company like the Lawrence Enterprise probably doesn’t have such thorough system software.”

“Indeed, they don’t. The Lawrence Enterprise has many projects that can be implemented through the manual signing and approval system.”

“So, if there really is such a sum of money, this fund for charity should be approved by Edward and have little to do with Eden. Of course, I don’t think it exists. The Swans have never been so foolish as to do such a meaningless thing!” Henry mocked and then said, “Putting aside whether the charity undertakings are done silently or announced to the world, the Swans will definitely not do such charity to subsidize the merchants. After all, whether the merchants could make up for the difference will depend on how much they earn. After all, that is their marketing method. I personally think that such a thing is not called charity and has no charity value! The charity that we, the Swans, have to do is either educational support, building roads in the countryside, medical treatment for diseases, or some scientific research and development. How can we subsidize the merchants for their losses? The Swans’ money doesn’t fall from the trees!”
