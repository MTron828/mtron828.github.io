“...”

“It would be even better if we have twins,” Monica muttered.

Meanwhile, Jeanne thought, ‘If Monica is in such good spirits, she must be alright.’

At that moment, outside the ward, a wheelchair was pushed out of a room.

“Dr. Jones,” the nurse pushing him, could not help but speak.

Finn was leaning against the wheelchair.

After he saw Michael, he just had to... come out. However, he could not be out for too long, so he had to be pushed back.

When the nurse called out to him, he did not answer. Hence, the nurse said to herself, “If you want to give birth to twins, it’s not impossible these days...”

Finn’s face turned red.

He had never thought that he would pass by Monica’s ward... Well, he was not just passing by.

Anyhow, when he heard that she was going to give him children and two children in three years at that, he was surprised.

…

In the ward, Monica did not notice any movements outside the ward.

......

She was still on the phone with Jeanne and seemed very excited. “Jeannie, Fourth Master Swan is almost 30.”

Jeanne was stunned.

It seemed so.

“Aren’t you going to give him a child?” Monica questioned.

No.

“Although George is very cute, are you really not going to give Fourth Master Swan another child? Don’t you take pity for Fourth Master Swan?”

“You don’t have me worry about my matters.”

“It’s not that I’m not worried. I’m just concerned that Jasmine might get pregnant since she has been married to Eden for some time now. I can even imagine how smug Jasmine would be if she were pregnant with the great-grandson of the Swans! You must not give Jasmine a chance to gloat. You should trample that woman under your feet!” Monica’s thoughts were changing too fast.

Why was Jasmine suddenly involved in the conversation?

“Alright. I got it. You’d better think about how you’ll give Dr. Jones children.”

“What do I have to think about? I just need to climb into his bed and force myself on him.” Monica smiled cunningly.

Jeanne could imagine that... scene.

Moreover, she always found it very easy for Monica to get her way.

“I’ve thought about it. First, I’ll give birth to a cool and handsome son like George and then a daughter, so the older brother can protect his younger sister. Just thinking about it sounds wonderful.” Monica was in her own happy world.

.

Jeanne seemed to be affected by Monica at that moment.

The two of them talked for a long time.

Monica thought about her many futures, feeling like she would be the happiest woman in the world in the future.

..

The next day, Jeanne woke up a little early because she wanted to go to work.

She tiptoed and tried her best not to disturb Edward’s sleep.

Last night, both of them had slept very late.

In fact, she and Monica had talked on the phone for more than two hours last night, and when she returned to her room, Edward was waiting for her at the head of the bed. Since both of them had slept for too long in the day yesterday, they both had some insomnia at night, and then… They did a lot of things later that night.

Though, they probably overdid on some things.

Jeanne could feel that her legs were weak when she got up and walked.

She walked into the bathroom and sat on the toilet. Out of habit, she scrolled through some of the latest news.

However, just as she started to read, the bathroom door was pushed open.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Edward glanced at Jeanne and said, “You can continue.”

“...”

Jeanne finished going to the toilet and went to wash up when she heard splashing sounds beside her ear.

Without thinking, she knew that a certain someone was peeing.

After that, he naturally hugged her from behind, took his toothbrush, and rinsed his mouth.

He rinsed his mouth while hugging her.

At that moment, in the large mirror in front of her, Jeanne saw the image of the two of them brushing their teeth together. She thought she looked so small under Edward’s body that she might not be able to withstand a single blow from him.

She did not even know how she withstood Edward’s ‘attacks’ on her…

Her legs were weak, so she quickly brushed her teeth, washed her face, and walked out of the bathroom.

When she went to the dressing room to get changed, Edward showed up again.

He was really haunting her.

“I have to go to work too,” Edward said.

As he said that, he changed into a formal suit while Jeanne changed into a business suit.

Just as she turned around and prepared to leave, Edward held out a tie. “Help me.”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

If she remembered correctly, she bought this tie for him right before she left him.
