900 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

Where did he bring her? Could it be that she would become Fourth Master Swan’s bargaining chip? The leverage that could threaten them?

Nevertheless, she remained calm and continued to observe every movement in the hall, especially the restless waiter.

Lucy’s eyes narrowed.

Once Kingsley gave the order, the first person to be taken down would be that person.

Therefore, her gaze was fixed on that person.

…

In the cloakroom, Edward’s body was against Jeanne’s, and her body was trembling uncontrollably

However, the two people outside kept gossiping, and there was only one exit. There was no way they could leave or do anything.

If they made any noise, they would be discovered by the people outside.

That stalemate lasted until a stern voice suddenly rang out in the room. “Everyone, get out!”

“Ah!” Shocked, the makeup artists shouted.

“Hurry up!” The voice was cold.

The two makeup artists quickly followed him out, and after that, there was no one else in the dressing room.

Jeanne frowned as she could not figure out what was happening.

Edward, who was behind her, heard Finn’s voice through the microphone in his ear. “I’ve been discovered.”

There was a slight change in Edward’s expression, and the next second, he left Jeanne.

Jeanne glared at Edward’s back.

He just left after having what he wanted from her. What a beast!

She suppressed the displeasure in her heart. After all, she had a mission to complete and had no time to fuss about it.

She quickly left as well, but her legs seemed a little…

Nevertheless, she gritted her teeth and walked out without stopping.

At that moment, the hall was brightly lit, and the Sanders’ guards were everywhere, shackling all the guests. Jeanne did not dare to act rashly after she walked out of the dressing room, so she could only stand in a corner and remain still under the guard’s fixed gazes.

In another corner, Finn had already left the main hall of the banquet hall before the lights turned on. However, because the exit was blocked, he could only go directly to the toilet outside the backyard. He would not walk into the trap. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As he walked, he said, “If I don’t leave, you don’t have to worry about me.”

“Don’t do anything extreme.” Nox could not help but whisper.

By then, he was already surrounded by the guards and did not dare to make any big movements. He could only pass on a message to Finn secretly while protecting George.

As the guests were not allowed to move around freely, Edward could not return to his seat. He was in a corner of the hall, being closely watched by the security guards.

It was not until an order came from the speakers for everyone to return to their seats that he followed the crowd back to his table.

He and Nox looked at each other but did not speak.

After Finn answered Nox’s last sentence by saying he knew what to do, he took off the micro receiver in his ear and the micro-transmitter on his body and threw them into a bush in the backyard.

That meant that he would completely lose contact with Edward and Nox and could only leave on his own.

If he could not leave, he would die here.

At that moment, Nox, who was in the banquet hall, had also secretly hidden his things on George, whom he was carrying.

As for Edward, he had already taken care of it. The moment everyone returned to their seats, he threw away those things that would be easily found if he was searched.

The banquet hall was extremely quiet.

All the guests inside were well-known figures. Even if they didn’t do anything too impulsive in consideration of their image, they were still very dissatisfied with being watched and ordered by others. However, no one took the lead to object now as everyone seemed to be waiting and watching.

Meanwhile, outside the banquet hall, Finn walked into the women’s washroom, closed the door, and quickly changed into his clothes.

As he took off the human-skinned mask and the waiter’s uniform, his eyes suddenly narrowed.

He could clearly hear the sound of footsteps approaching.

If they could find him so fast, it meant that he had been targeted long ago.

In fact, he had been under surveillance for disrupting their plans on purpose. As long as there was an order, he would be dealt with immediately.

There was a slight change in his expression.

He felt the footsteps getting closer and closer.

Fortunately, that was the largest public bathroom in the banquet hall. There were more than a dozen toilet booths inside, and each one was hidden, so it would take some time to find him. Taking advantage of that time, he put the clothes he had taken off, the human skin mask, and the wig in his mouth. Then, he quickly and agilely climbed up to the top of the bathroom and took out a square ceiling. That was the escape route he had left for himself before he came.
