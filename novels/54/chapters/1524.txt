Chapter 1525: Side Story: The Birth of Kingsley’s Son

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now that she had been pampered by Kingsley, she was afraid of death, and an assassin who was afraid of death was useless.

She had to admit that she had really been spoiled by Kingsley. If Kingsley died, she might not be able to survive alone.

“I don’t want you to die,” Lucy suddenly answered seriously.

Kingsley looked at her.

“I want you to live forever. If you want to die, you have to die after me.” Lucy was telling the truth.

She was afraid that she could not accept the pain of Kingsley’s death.

At that moment, Kingsley’s expression suddenly changed. He looked as though his heart ached for her. She vaguely saw a trace of redness in his eyes as well. Then, in the next second, he hugged her in his arms and kissed her passionately.

Lucy was dumbfounded. It was a normal conversation between lovers. Did she provoke Kingsley?

Later, she finally understood why Kingsley was acting differently. It was because she was pregnant. Kingsley had heard that in order to prepare for pregnancy, one had to quit smoking and drinking and start exercising.

Previously, she thought that Kingsley’s feelings for her might be a spur of the moment. However, she Imew now that it was not that Kingsley did not take her seriously; he was just ecstatic to know that she was pregnant.

Jeanne was there too, and her eyeballs almost popped out. He did not usually like George much. Although he treated George well, he was definitely not enthusiastic about George.

How did Kingsley, a man who prioritized his girlfriend over anything, become the head of the Hills? Did they not say that assassins had to be heartless? Did he not love Lucy very much?

Jeanne could not understand it, but she decided to stop thinking about it. Anyway, she had never understood Kingsley.

Kingsley’s protection of Lucy became even more exaggerated during her pregnancy.

He did not allow Lucy to walk or eat on her own. Even when she slept, he had to order everyone in the manor not to make a sound. It was as if Lucy was the only one in the world who could be pregnant. Sometimes, Lucy could not stand it.

In the first three months, because she had severe morning sickness, she understood Kingsley’s nervousness. However, after three months, everything returned to normal. She even felt that she could run 800 meters with her pregnant belly.

If Kingsley continued behaving like that, it would be too much. Moreover, if word got out, the people in the assassin industry would laugh at him.

Kingsley’s reason was that whoever laughed at spoiling his wife would be an idiot!

After more than a year, Lucy still could not fully accept her identity. She really did not understand why Kingsley liked her so much.

Sometimes, she would ask Kingsley what he saw in her, and he would say,

“Everything. ”

What kind of answer was that? It also seems particularly insincere. However, she could not find fault with it.

Nine months later, Lucy went into labor, and the lineup for her labor was truly unprecedented. Kingsley had summoned all the assassins back to stand by. He was so prepared that not even a fly could fly into the manor.

Lucy’s natural labor was not a smooth one.

She was originally in good physical condition. After all, being an assassin made her different from an ordinary person. However, after being pampered by Kingsley during the nine months of pregnancy, her body seemed to have become a little weaker. She was in labor for a long time, but the baby would not come out. It was so painful that she screamed.

Kingsley, on the other hand, was even more unsettled. He could endure the first hour of labor, and when he heard Lucy’s scream, he would at most stand up and pace around. However, from the second hour onward, he became a little irritable.

He would ask every three minutes, “Has the baby not been born yet?” Three hours later, he ordered, “Cut open that kid immediately, and I’ll beat him up.”

Jeanne, who was also accompanying Kingsley, was speechless. She even felt like punching him in the face.

Giving birth was a process. Moreover, the doctor had made it very clear that the baby’s fetal position was correct and that the baby was not big, so natural labor was fine. It was just a matter of time.

Lucy did not approve Kingsley’s order, so he endured it for another hour until he could not take it anymore.

He kicked open the delivery room specially prepared for Lucy and said to the doctor, “Do a C-section for her immediately.” “Shut up!” Lucy shouted at Kingsley. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was stunned.

After all, no one had ever dared to shout at the famous Kingsley so loudly and fiercely before..
