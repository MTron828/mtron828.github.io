Chapter 655: The Relationship Between Edward and Jeanne Started When She Was in the Womb!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne drove away from the Lawrence family’s manor.

Jeanne was actually a little overwhelmed by the fact that she had received a portion of the Lawrences’ assets.

Her eyes moved slightly, and she recalled what Eden said about Edward not having returned yet.

Not only had he not returned, but he had not been calling her as well.

She pursed her lips, seemingly a little hesitant. Ultimately, she put on her wireless earpiece and made the call.

The phone rang a few times.

When the call connected, a familiar and deep male voice came from the other end of the phone. “Jeannie.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat as she did not expect Edward to pick up her call.

She had always thought Edward was so busy that he did not have the time to make a call or answer calls.

Yet, at that moment, she was caught off guard when she heard his voice.

Jeanne calmed herself down and said, “When will you be back?”

“In another three to five days.” Edward did not give her a specific time because he was unsure when he would be back.

“Did you run into a sticky situation?” Jeanne asked.

“Yes, we ran into some sticky situations,” Edward replied.

However, he would not tell her the details.

Jeanne was driving while talking to Edward on the phone. In fact, the two of them did not say much.

It was as if they were discussing an irrelevant topic.

“In that case, be careful. I’m hanging up now.”

“Jeannie,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

“Huh?”

“I miss you,” Edward said.

Suddenly, the conversation turned sappy.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

At that moment, the anger she had been holding back all this while finally showed itself. “You miss me. Can you not give me a call for a few days?”

“Are you angry?”

“No,” Jeanne denied. “I’ve been busy all day. How would I have time to be angry?”

“I was afraid I’d miss you more if I heard your voice. However, I’m not sure when I can come back,” Edward explained. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to control myself.”

“How slick.” Jeanne rolled her eyes.

However, a small flower was blooming in her heart because of this.

“Have you settled the matter with your grandfather and father?” Edward changed the topic.

“I got my share of the inheritance today.”

“Not bad,” Edward praised.

“Eden... is in cahoots with the Lawrences,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“That’s his choice,” Edward said indifferently.

After Jeanne received a clear answer from Edward, she did not say anything more. “I’m driving now.”

“Wait for me to come back.” Edward nodded.

“Okay.”

Only once Jeanne hung up the phone did Edward slowly put down the phone.

Nox was beside Edward.

The two of them were staying in a small hotel in the remote area of Cape Town. Nox stood on the balcony as he smoked and said, “Basically, we can confirm that the people following us are from the Delta Mafia.”

“Okay,” Edward responded while taking a cigarette and started smoking. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“It’s also clear that the head of the Hills in the Delta Islands is Kingsley. Kingsley Thorn’s original name is Kingsley Hills, but he changed it to avoid exposing his identity.” Nox looked at Edward, “In fact, we should’ve expected it. Isn’t it obvious?”

Edward did not answer.

Nox seemed to have gotten used to Edward’s reaction and continued to speak, “Now, the Hills’ business has spread all across the world. The bigger they are, the more enemies they have. Therefore, the Hills has roped in many national-level forces and has a deep relationship with the Sanders. There are rumors that the Sanders was able to take down the Duncans and change history because of the Hills’ secret operations.”

Edward rarely expressed his opinions, but his brain was working quickly.

“I’ve looked up a lot of things about the Hills and found a troubling thing for the Hills. There are very few people in the family, and most generations only have had one child. Only Kingsley’s generation had two children to succeed the family. The other one was Kingsley’s sister, Penelope Thorn, whose original name was Penelope Hill.” Nox paused. “You should know who Penelope Thorn is, right?”

Edward took a drag of his cigarette and said with certainty, “Jeanne’s mother.”

Nox nodded.

They finally knew Jeanne’s background.

Nox said, “There’s no gender discrimination for one to become the Hills’s successor. It’s different from Harken’s tradition. Regardless of whether the Hills have a boy or a girl, they can be the successor. The only requirement is that the successor’s next successor has to have the surname Hill. That made Penelope the Hills’ successor and not Kingsley. However, Penelope is a rare one among all the Hills because she was not interested in succeeding the family. In fact, she was very disgusted with the Hills’ cruel and bloody business. After she came of age, she even ran away from the Hills, hid her identity, and came to the Harken to work at Lawrence Enterprise.”
