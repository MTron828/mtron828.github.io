1195 Finn’s Company

“Also, don’t get too agitated.” The doctor then instructed, Stay calm. Once you’re agitated, there’s a high chance that you’ll have a cerebral hemorrhage, which will be very dangerous.”

“Yes.” Monica listened attentively.

“Now, we’ll put Ms. Cardellini back on the bed and then transfer you to another ward. With your current condition, you don’t need to stay in the ICU anymore.”

“Thank you.” Monica thanked him. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The doctor gave him more instructions before he walked out, leaving the nurses in the intensive care unit to help her with everything else.

Monica thought that Finn had left with the doctor, but she did not expect that he would return to the ward after a while.

The moment he returned to the ward, Ruby and Sarah also walked in.

It was probably Finn who informed them.

When Ruby saw that Monica had woken up, she could not help but burst into tears.

“Aunty, don’t cry. The doctor just said that you can’t let Monica get emotional. What if she gets emotional when you cry?” Sarah quickly advised.

At that moment, Finn was looking at the equipment next to Monica’s body, looking at her heart rate and blood pressure.

Ruby tried her best to hold her tears back.

When she finally managed to do it, she grabbed Monica’s hand. “Monica, I was really afraid that you’d never wake up again. If you didn’t wake up, and if your father doesn’t wake up, what should I do?”

“Mom, I’m fine.” Monica was not very emotional.

Just as the doctor said, she was not emotional, and she would do whatever the doctor told her to.

Suddenly, she cherished her life. After dying once, she felt very lucky to be able to open her eyes again.

Back then, when she crashed into Finn’s car, she was really determined to die. She really did not think that she would be lucky enough to survive.

Now that she was alive, she did not want to die anymore.

On the other hand, her depression had probably been cured as well. At least, she was no longer suicidal.

She even wanted to get better as soon as possible and become a normal person.

“It’s good that you’re fine,” Ruby said while trying to suppress her emotions.

No one knew how she survived Gary and Monica entering the intensive care unit one after another during this time.

If the doctor had not said that Monica was just unconscious and would wake up in a few days, she would have really chosen to commit suicide!

Fortunately, Monica had woken up.

“Madam, we’re changing Ms. Cardellini’s ward now. Can you please make way for us?” the nurse said politely.

Ruby hurriedly moved away, but she never let go of Monica’s hand.

Monica, too, held Ruby’s hand as she was pushed to her father’s ward, where her mother was still living.

After she was pushed in, the nurse asked, “Is there any family member who can carry Ms. Cardellini to this bed?”

“Let me do it,” Finn, who had been following them, suddenly said.

“Dr. Jones, sorry to trouble you.” The nurse was very respectful.

Finn bent down and gently picked Monica up from the bed. The moment he picked her up, he frowned because of Monica’s weight.

He had picked Monica up before.

In order to maintain her figure, Monica had deliberately gone on a diet, so she had never been too heavy. However, at that moment, she was so light that he felt that she weighed nothing.

As he gently placed Monica on the bed in the ward, Monica said in a low voice, “Thank you.”

Finn glanced at her.

The moment she thought he would be silent, he replied, “You’re welcome.”

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

After that, he did not say anything else.

After lying on the bed in the ward, the nurse re-installed a new body-monitoring device for Monica. Then, she took out an IV drip with saline and nutrient fluids.

Even though she was awake now, she still needed nutrition because she had not eaten anything.

“Ms. Cardellini, you can’t use this needle anymore, so I’ll give you another one.” As the nurse spoke, she took out the intravenous needle for Monica.

Monica endured the pain as the nurse put in another intravenous needle for Monica again.

However, after searching for a long time, the nurse could not find a blood vessel that was easy to suture.

“Let me do it,” Finn suddenly said.

He probably noticed the nurse’s dilemma.

“Ms. Cardellini’s blood vessels are too thin. Coupled with the fact that she hasn’t eaten much, it’s not easy to find her blood vessels,” the nurse explained.
