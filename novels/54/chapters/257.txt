Chapter 258: Fourth Master Swan Comes to the Rescue

At night, smashing sounds could be heard everywhere.

Monica stood next to Finn.

She saw his hands. His originally beautiful hands of a doctor had been completely ruined.

‘Doesn’t he…

‘Doesn’t he need to do... surgeries?!

‘Aren’t a doctor’s hands very important?!’

Monica bit her lips tightly.

Her vision was blurry.

It was so blurry that she could not see all the wounds on Finn’s hands clearly.

She could not make Finn stop.

The only thing she could do at the moment was to smash down the door, find Fourth Master Swan, and save Jeanne.

Monica just watched.

She watched Finn smash the door relentlessly.

She did not know how long it would take.

Perhaps it would not take long.

Finn suddenly stopped what he was doing.

Monica looked at him blankly.

She saw him suddenly take a few steps back.

Then, he suddenly kicked the door hard.

“Clang!”!

The door was kicked open.

It was kicked open. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, the light from the door made Monica feel that she had seen the light.

She was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes.

Tears welled up in her eyes as she rushed in.

Then, she saw Fourth Master Swan and Nox kneeling on the ground.

Fourth Master Swan was wearing a white shirt. On the back of the shirt, there were traces of blood. It seemed like he had been whipped by something.

Nox was not injured, but he had been kneeling beside Fourth Master Swan.

Even when the two of them heard the movements at the door, they did not move. They kneeled straight.

The moment Monica saw Fourth Master Swan, she broke down.

She even fell in front of Fourth Master Swan and Nox because she had walked too fast.

The two of them looked at her.

Nox was a careless person, but he did not laugh when he saw Monica’s sorry state.

At that moment, he knew that something must have happened.

In this so-called punishment room of the Swans, there was an amazing soundproof effect. No sound could be heard from the inside. Therefore, other than the movements at the door toward the end, everything that happened before could not be heard by Edward and Nox. They had no idea what happened.

Monica could not care less about how badly she fell. Her eyes were red as she looked at Fourth Master Swan. She said to him quickly and anxiously, “Fourth Master, Jeannie is in trouble. Go and save her!”

Edward’s expression, which was originally cold, had obviously changed at this moment.

It was a change that could be seen with the naked eye.

In the past, Edward had always been calm and collected.

It was only when he met Jeanne that he became unrestrained and out of control.

He immediately stood up from the ground.

Without thinking, he walked out.

Nox seemed to have tried to pull him, but he did not grab him in the end.

He hurriedly followed Edward.

‘Ms. Lawrence just can’t let us have some peace.’

Edward left the Swans’ Universe Garden very quickly.

It was as though he forgot what he was being punished for at the moment.

Even if he had thought about it, he would not give up.

He suddenly stopped.

Nox stopped behind Edward as well.

Finn had been following Edward ever since he left, so he also stopped at this moment.

Monica, Micheal, and Eden also hurriedly chased after them and stopped in their tracks.

Everyone looked at Zachary, the old master of the Swans, standing there.

He stood there motionless.

There was a sudden stalemate.

Edward went forward.

“Edward!” Zachary called out to him.

Edward pursed his lips and did not stop in his tracks.

“Are you sure you want to walk out of this door?” Zachary asked him coldly.

Edward said, “I’m very sure!”

He did not hide his intent.

At this moment, he did not even stop.

Meanwhile, a lot of people suddenly appeared in Universe Garden.

They were the same people as the two guards just now, but there were a lot more of them.

Those people surrounded them in an instant.

Monica was about to fall into despair.

If this continued, would Jeanne still be alive?!

It had been so long.

Was Jeannie still alive?!

Monica only wanted Fourth Master Swan to save Jeannie. Why was it so difficult?

Just as she was about to break down again, so much so that she did not know how to vent her emotions, everyone stared with their mouths agape as Nox suddenly stepped forward and directly seized Old Master Swan.

He moved very quickly.

While everyone was not on guard, under the watchful eyes of his grandfather, Nox disgracefully restrained Old Master Swan and grabbed his neck with his hand.

No one could react in time.

This was because everyone’s attention was on the sudden appearance of the many bodyguards in front of them.

As for Zachary and Wade, their attention was on Edward.

They did not expect Nox to act so unexpectedly.

There was a second or two of silence.

“Nox!” Wade was furious. He was exasperated. “Let go!”

Nox smiled.

He seemed to be very cheeky. “I won’t let go unless he lets Fourth Master Swan go!”

“You unfilial son, I’ll beat you to death!” Wade said as he wanted to hit Nox.

Nox tightened his grip on Zachary’s neck. “If you come over, I’ll use force!”

“Nox, what did I teach you? How could you do such a thing? You, you, you!” Wade was so angry that he could not speak!

Nox, on the other hand, was very calm. He said calmly, “Grandpa, didn’t you say that my life belongs to Fourth Master Swan? In order to prevent Fourth Master Swan from being beaten to death by Grandpa Zachary, I can only take the initiative to strike first!”

“You unfilial Son!” Wade was angered to death.

Zachary was calm.

He said, “Nox, you’re really bold!”

“Grandpa Zachary, for the sake of Fourth Master Swan, I can only fight to the end. If you let him go, I’ll let you go. After I let you go, I’ll give you my life in exchange for his, okay?!” Nox asked.

Zachary’s face turned cold.

His eyes moved, and he asked Fourth Master Swan coldly, “Let me ask you again—are you going to leave?!”

“Yes!” Edward answered, enunciating each word.

“Let him go!” Zachary suddenly said.

Everyone was stunned for a second.

The next second, Edward left quickly.

Finn followed behind.

Monica also chased after them.

So did Eden and Micheal.

No one cared about Nox anymore.

Nox watched Edward leave without any hesitation. Edward did not even look at him. He felt very hurt.

‘I risked my life for you. You should at least say something nice!

‘Hoes over bros, huh?!’

“Let go!” Wade said fiercely to his grandson.

Nox saw that Edward and the others had left, so he slowly let go of Old Master Swan.

The moment he did, he was kicked to the ground by his grandpa.

Nox grimaced in pain.

‘Am I not your grandson?

‘You almost killed me.’

He could not help but shout, “Can’t you be a little gentler just for show? Do you want to kill your grandson?!”

“Didn’t you just boast shamelessly that you wanted to exchange your life for Fourth Master Swan’s?!” Wade sneered.

“I was just...” Nox finished the rest of his sentence in his head, ‘Saying it for fun.’

“I’ll beat you to death!” Wade approached Nox.

Nox was terrified.

He quickly got up and planned to run away.

His body was suddenly restrained by many bodyguards in front of him.

Nox also knew that he could not beat them, so he did not resist too much at this moment.

“I’ll leave this to you,” Zachary said to Wade.

Afterward, he left.

“Grandpa Zachary, don’t go. My grandpa will really beat me to death. Can’t you let me go on account of my loyalty to your son? Grandpa Zachary—ah!” Nox was hit hard and cried out in pain.

He was definitely not Wade’s biological grandson.

Definitely not!

...

At this moment, Edward had walked out of Universe Garden quickly and went to a garage in the courtyard.

Finn had been following beside him the whole time.

Edward asked as he walked, “Do you have your phone with you?”

He sounded calm, though he was walking astonishingly fast.

Finn hurriedly looked for his phone.

He had fought too fiercely just now. Did he lose his phone during the process?!

Finn answered, “No.”

“Help me find a phone. I’ll go and drive!”

“Okay.”

Finn quickly turned around.

He turned around and quickly walked back.

At this moment, Micheal was driving and following them.

Finn suddenly appeared in front of the car.

Micheal slammed on the brakes.

Finn’s body seemed to have been hit a little.

Even so, he did not seem to feel any pain.

He quickly walked to the passenger seat.

Monica hurriedly opened the car door because she felt that Finn must have something to tell her.

“Give me your phone!” Finn said bluntly.

Monica was stunned.

Finn did not say anything to Monica and directly pulled her phone away from her hand.

Monica watched helplessly as Finn snatched it away and left. He was really cold!
