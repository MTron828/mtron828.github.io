Chapter 486: Jasmine’s Video Exposed, and a Slap in the Face

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As Jasmine admitted it, tears streamed down her face.

However, she admitted it because she was forced upon by someone. As such, she had no choice but to admit it.

Jeanne really did admire Jasmine a little.

She had always thought Jasmine was really stupid, but on second thought, having been under Jenifer’s guidance for so many years, she was pretty capable.

Jasmine looked at Jeanne eagerly. “Sister, are you okay with that? Can you let us go now? I tried to keep the baby all of last night and only had the abortion surgery this morning. The doctor said it’s easier for a woman to fall ill after an abortion, so he told me to get more rest. Right now, all I want is to take good care of my body so that I can bear another child for Eden in the future. Now that I’ve admitted to it, can you let me go?”

The look on her face said, “I’ve compromised, yet you’re still pushing me for an inch and a foot.”

That made Jeanne seem even more like a villain.

“Enough.” Eden could not stand Jasmine’s aggrieved look anymore. “We don’t need her permission. Let’s go.”

“If I say you can’t go, you can’t!” Jeanne’s face darkened.

Her presence was intimidating, and it caused both Eden and Jasmine to shudder.

The two of them stopped in their tracks because of Jeanne’s words.

Eden gritted his teeth. However, he refused to be threatened by Jeanne, so he took Jasmine and was about to leave again.

......

At that moment, Wade stood in front of Eden.

Eden was stunned, but he looked at Wade fiercely.

Everyone knew that Wade’s every move was his grandfather’s instructions.

He gnashed his teeth, realizing that he could not show Jeanne respect, but he had to show his grandfather respect.

With that, he stood in his place and did not leave. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jeanne said, “You guys can forget about this matter, but it doesn’t mean I will forget all about it. After all, I’m the one who’ll lose my reputation, not you guys!”

“Jeanne, don’t humiliate yourself!” Eden was at his limit at trying to suppress his anger.

“I should be saying that to you.” Jeanne looked at Eden coldly. Then, she looked to Old Master Swan and said respectfully, “Dad, can I use your computer?”

Old Master Swan nodded.

Wade left in front of Eden and walked into the hall. After a while, he came out with a laptop and turned it on.

A little nervous, Eden and Jasmine exchanged glances.

Could Jeanne have captured the scene from yesterday? How was that possible?

Jasmine was certain that no surveillance cameras were installed in the washroom of Universe Garden, and the surveillance cameras in other places could not capture the scene either. Moreover, after the incident, Eden had specially asked someone to look through Universe Garden’s surveillance footage, and after making sure there was no footage of the washroom, she began to carry out the following series of plans. She had already thought through how to make it difficult for Jeanne to defend herself!

If George were not Edward’s son, Jeanne would not be able to rid herself of that matter, no matter how Jeanne tried to explain herself. Even if Old Master Swan was protecting Jeanne, Jeanne would still be the “culprit”. Perhaps she could not do anything to Jeanne this time, but if Jeanne had any ‘suspicious behavior’ in the future, Old Master Swan would not continue to protect her like that. He would not allow her to continue to be so rampant.

However, what was the situation now?

Did Jeanne really manage to capture that scene?

No. She could not be humiliated like that.

Jasmine’s hand that was holding Eden was trembling.

She could not imagine what would happen to her if people saw that she was the one who fell and framed Jeanne instead.

What would happen to her?

At that moment, she suddenly had an idea and was just about to faint.

“Don’t faint.” Jeanne did not even turn her head. Her back was facing Jasmine, and she was plugging her USB drive into the laptop.

Jasmine was stunned.

“Because fainting is useless. If you faint, the truth will still be exposed,” Jeanne said coldly.

Now, Jasmine’s body was trembling. Jeanne’s words made her so afraid that she did not know what to do.

Eden also braced himself and looked fiercely at Jeanne.

He had a feeling that Jeanne would definitely expose something of Jasmine’s. He was even thinking about how to get rid of his relationship with her.

If Jasmine was exposed in public, how should he get rid of his relationship with her?

His face was grim as he watched Jeanne find the video file.

Just as she was about to play the video, Jeanne suddenly called out. “Teddy.”
