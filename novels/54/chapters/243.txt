Chapter 244: A Big Accident Happens

Jeanne also had no time to please the Lawrences.

“Be careful on the road then,” Gary reminded her.

Jeanne nodded. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this moment, Gary’s car had also stopped at the entrance of the banquet hall.

The driver got out of the car and opened the door for him and his wife.

“Then we’ll head back first. Go back early to rest,” Ruby said after she and Gary got into the car.

“Alright, you should go back quickly. While Dad is still young and strong, perhaps you can still give birth to a younger brother for me,” Monica urged them.

“You d*mned child!” Ruby’s face was red from her daughter’s words.

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

She was very envious of Monica’s family.

They were... a very good family.

There were no schemes between them.

There was only love.

Jeanne watched the car leave.

Her car was also parked at the entrance of the hall by the valet guy.

Jeanne said to Monica and Finn, “Go home early. I’ll be leaving first.”

“I’ll go with you.” Monica suddenly tugged at Jeanne’s arm.

“Monica.”

“I don’t want to sit in the same car with Finn. I want to go with you. Can you send me home?” Monica acted coquettishly.

Monica did not want to be alone with Finn.

She felt that her heart was a little unsettled these few days.

Jeanne was speechless. She looked up at Finn and saw that he seemed to have picked up a call. He turned around and walked toward the car at the back.

Afterward, Finn sat in the driver’s seat, started the car, and left at a rather fast speed.

Jeanne and Monica watched as Finn left.

At this time, Jeanne turned around to look at Monica.

Monica said, “See, if you don’t send me back, I’ll have to walk back on my own!”

“...” Jeanne pursed her lips and did not say anything.

She sat in the driver’s seat while Monica sat in the passenger’s seat.

Jeanne drove Monica back first.

Monica’s gaze was fixed outside the car window on the streets of South Hampton City.

Perhaps Monica was tired after a night of socializing. She was usually talkative, but at this moment, she leaned against the chair and did not say a word.

Jeanne wanted to say something, but her eyes suddenly narrowed.

At an intersection, she hit the brakes.

The brakes were not working.

She pursed her lips and stepped hard on them.

At this point, she was sure that someone had tampered with the brakes.

Jeanne looked at her speed. It should not be a problem for her to force the car to stop by drifting.

She said, “Monica, fasten your seatbelt.”

Monica frowned.

‘Have I not fastened it properly?’

Before she could ask, she felt a shake in the car, scaring her so much that she hurriedly grabbed the armrest beside her. “Jeannie, what are you doing?!”

“I’m forcing the car to stop—” Before Jeanne could finish her sentence, through the rearview mirror, she saw a black car crazily approaching them.

It was the same trick again.

Only this time, they cleverly tampered with her brakes.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she definitely could not brake. If she did, she would be smashed into pieces by the car behind her.

She suddenly stepped on the accelerator and sped away.

Monica was frightened by the sudden acceleration.

She was really frightened.

‘Jeanne isn’t possessed, is she?!’

“Jeannie, what’s wrong with you? Don’t scare me. You’re speeding so fast in the middle of the night!”

Monica was scared to death when she saw the speed of the car.

‘Is Jeanne flying a plane?!’

Monica held onto the armrest tightly.

Jeanne had no time to answer Monica’s questions at this moment.

Without the brakes, she needed to focus more to ensure their safety.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly as she looked at the car behind her. In an instant, there were four of them.

‘Has Melody not learned her lesson?!’
