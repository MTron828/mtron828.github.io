Chapter 133: Touching Between Adults

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thump Thump Thump.

Thump Thump Thump Thump.

In the quiet car.

At that moment, Jeanne heard the sound of her own heartbeat.

It was irregular and very fast.

She looked at Fourth Master Swan who was standing close to her.

She looked at his handsome face which was magnified under the flickering street lights.

She thought to herself.

She could probably understand why Melody Sanders, the dignified princess of the Sanders, would lower her status and take the initiative to chase after this man.

This man’s charm was really hard to resist.

She blinked.

Her heart was still racing.

She did not answer.

However, at that moment, his face came closer.

She closed her eyes.

Many... indescribable things could happen between adults because of a look, a heartbeat, or even because of a little touch.

She admitted that she had lost her mind.

The moment she lost her mind, she felt a soft kiss on her forehead.

It was a light kiss.

However, it seemed to have left a mark.

She opened her eyes and looked at him.

Nothing that she imagined had happened.

It was just a light kiss on her forehead.

A kiss like that could not be considered lust.

It was just… a form of pampering?

To a woman, it was more than any kind of intimacy.

Fourth Master Swan said, “Ms. Lawrence, do you need my help?”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

The emotions that had caused her to be in a trance just now gradually calmed down.

When she spoke again, she was calm and collected.

A moment of excitement could also disappear in an instant.

“No need,” she refused. “As long as the Fourth Master knows that you are the main cause of this matter, I don’t need your help nor do I need your guilt. I only need you to keep your promise.”

Edward looked at her.

She reminded him word by word, “Make Melody Sanders give up on you, then we will go our separate ways and never interact with each other again.”

Edward’s expression changed slightly. He said in a slightly cold voice, “That will depend on Ms. Lawrence’s ability.”

At this point.

The two of them did not say anything more.

The car stopped at the Lawrence family manor.

Jeanne got out of the car.

Edward also got out of the car.

“Take care, Fourth Master.”

Edward nodded slightly.

Jeanne turned around and left.

When she left, she could still feel the intense gaze behind her.

She gritted her teeth.

Actually, every time she turned around, she could feel Fourth Master Swan’s gaze, but she... would not turn back.

Edward would only leave after Jeanne had completely disappeared from his sight.

He returned to the car and was very quiet.

Teddy sat in the front passenger seat. He had always been very quiet.

At this moment, the car was driving towards the Swan family manor.

“Fourth master, you didn’t eat anything for dinner tonight. Do you want to eat something now? Chez Jeanne is open all night.” Teddy reminded him.

Edward asked, “Are you hungry?”

Teddy was touched.

He did not expect his fourth master to care about his health.

He hurriedly nodded. “I am.”

“It’s good that you’re hungry,” Fourth Master Swan said coldly.

Teddy was stunned.

“Otherwise, how can you lose ten pounds?”

“...”

“Take away some food from Chez Jeanne and send it to the Bamboo Garden,” Fourth Master Swan instructed. “For one person.”

“...”

Fourth Master, you can’t be like this!

You suffered from Ms. Lawrence, but you can not vent your anger on me!

What did I do wrong?!

…

The next day.

Jeanne woke up.

She slept too late last night.

After washing up, she went to bed past 4:00 am.

It was already 7:00 am when she woke up with the alarm clock ringing.

She turned it off, got up, and washed up.

George also got up in a daze.

He rubbed his eyes and was reluctant to move.

He did not want to go to school.

The school was dull and uninteresting, and it seriously affected his sleep.

His heart was resisting, but his body was very sensible.

He lifted the quilt, got up, and waited at the bathroom door.

When Jeanne came out after washing up, she saw her son waiting at the door.

She said, “You don’t have to go to school today, so you can sleep more.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Really?” George’s eyes were glimmering.

George, without his glasses, was very handsome.

She rubbed his little face. “Really.”

“Mom, you’ve finally figured it out?” George was only six years old. Although he looked mature, he was still a child.

When he encountered something happy, he could not hide his emotions.

“Don’t get the wrong idea. It’s just today.” Jeanne smiled.

George was a little disappointed.

Jeanne said, “And I’m not letting you off today to have fun. There are things to do.”

“What is it?”

“Turn on the computer and keep it running normally. Wait for my instructions.”

“Okay.”

“Go and sleep for a while more. I have to go to work.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne patted George’s little head and changed into her business attire. She still wore light makeup and went to the company.

She soon arrived at the company.

A few people from the project team also got up from their beds in a daze.

Jeanne walked into the office.

Amy yawned and followed behind Jeanne.

Jeanne said as she turned on the computer, “Tell the project team to wash their faces and wake up. After breakfast, we’ll have a meeting in the conference room.”

“Yes.” Amy nodded. “Director Lawrence, do you need a coffee without sugar?”

“Follow them for breakfast. Come back and make coffee after breakfast.”

Amy was stunned.

Then she quickly said, “Thank you, Director Lawrence.”

Jeanne nodded slightly.

Amy left.

9 am in the morning.

Jeanne called for a meeting.

The people in the project team were already fully awake and full of energy.

At the same time, in the Marketing Deputy Director’s office.

Joshua received a call from Eden and reported, “I don’t know what Jeanne is up to. Last night, I heard that she worked overtime until 3 am. The people in the project team are even sleeping in the office. Now that she has just gone to work, she is having a meeting again, as if she is making a big move. In fact, I have inquired about it. Jeanne wanted to seek redress for herself through the media but was rejected by all the media platforms. It is impossible for her to speak up for herself. Moreover, I know that my father wants this matter to be settled quietly. If it’s a loss, then so be it. He won’t go against the government.”

“I can see that,” Eden said.

Eden then hung up the phone.

He did not think that the Lawrence Enterprise would settle things so peacefully. With Alexander’s cowardly personality, he would definitely just let it be. He would not confront the government directly. However, Eden was not certain about Jeanne. To be honest, he really felt that this woman could not be controlled at all.

He even had a feeling that if he really angered Jeanne, she might come charging over with a knife.

He smiled.

No matter how uncontrollable she was, her abilities were limited.

No matter how great Jeanne’s abilities were, she was fighting alone.

With so many people behind him, it would be easy to kill Jeanne.

…

Jeanne returned to her office after the meeting.

She asked Hans to leave the Lawrence Enterprise with 100 employees to cause trouble at the City Hall.

Jeanne opened up the public opinion platform which Forrest told her about and gave George a call. After giving him a few simple instructions, she sent the content to him.

In a short while.

The news that Jeanne wanted appeared on those platforms.

The topic itself was eye-catching – How could the Lawrence Enterprise survive if the Government deliberately targeted it?

The moment the content appeared, it attracted a lot of people.

However, ten minutes later, the news was completely deleted. Even when the information was re-posted by many individuals, the post was directly restricted and could not be shared.

Eden scrolled through his phone and looked at the news that had been emptied.

When Jeanne could not persuade the news media, he had expected her to use other ways to spread her news. Hence, he told Micheal and Melody in advance to prepare for network surveillance. As expected, Jeanne fell for it.

Now. What would she do next?

Jeanne naturally also expected that something like this would happen. Otherwise, she would not have asked George to stay behind and not go to school.

She had to give George some time.

Conquering a well-established system and completely controlling it was not something that could be done in a short period of time.

At least... half a day.

She turned her chair around.

The phone rang and she picked it up.

“Director Lawrence, the government has triggered the police to suppress us. They are penalizing us on the grounds that we are causing trouble for no reason, and we seriously affected their official duties. If we don’t leave now, they will detain all of us.”

“Get the employees to leave. Your main task today is to take more photos.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

She continued to wait.

At this moment, Eden was sitting in his office with a smug look on his face, looking at the message on his phone.

“The people from the Lawrence Enterprise who caused trouble have all been chased away. They did not cause any large-scale impact. Please rest assured.”

Eden smiled coldly.

‘Jeanne... is this the best you can do?’
