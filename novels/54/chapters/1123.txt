1124 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

Edward turned around and stopped in his tracks.

At that moment, Nox’s expression also changed.

No one had expected Jeanne, who had left, to suddenly return and see Kingsley’s corpse.

It was a tragic sight.

Then, she saw Edward’s entire body covered in blood, in Kingsley’s blood.

At that moment, Nox did not even know what would happen!

From Jeanne’s perspective…

From Edward’s perspective…

Nox thought that this was good too.

In any case, they had already become enemies, so it was better to fight it out now. The next time they met, neither of them would show mercy to the other.

“Did you kill them?” Jeanne asked Edward.

Her voice was surprisingly calm. There was no panic, no pain, and no breaking down. She just asked Edward calmly.

Edward’s eyes were fixed on her.

He looked at Jeanne, whose face was turning paler and paler because of Kingsley’s death.

“Did you kill them?” Jeanne asked him again.

When she did not get a reply from him, she asked him again.

She had indeed left. Following Mason, she had a smooth journey with Kingsley and Edward covering for them.

However, the moment she left, she still turned around.

She thought that since the war had broken out, and since she could not let go of Kingsley or Edward, she decided to come back and persuade Kingsley to work with Edward.

In any case, their goals were similar, so why could they not cooperate?

As for what would happen after the cooperation? That would be after the cooperation. She could not think too much about it now.

Hence, she persuaded Mason to turn around.

In fact, Leng Muye did not need her to persuade him. As long as she threatened him with her life, Mason would follow her orders.

However, in the end, she was still too late.

When she rushed back, she saw Kingsley’s corpse. Such a powerful man was now lying in front of her, motionless.

She still remembered the first time she met Kingsley. At that time, she had just woken up from a cesarean section in the hospital.

The first person she saw when she woke up was Kingsley, and the first thing he said was, “I’m your uncle.”

From then on, the word ‘uncle’ had become her backing.

No matter what she did, no matter how willful she was, that ‘uncle’ of hers would always indulge her unconditionally.

Now, that person no longer existed. She had lost another relative on top of the few she had lost.

Jeanne walked up to Kingsley, step by step, and looked at his tragic appearance. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Since she did not receive a reply from Edward, she did not need to ask anymore. In fact, the truth was obvious.

Who else could it be but him?

If not Edward, who else could it be?

She was just… giving herself some hope.

Jeanne slowly squatted down in front of Kingsley.

Had Kingsley ever thought about the fact that there would come a day when he would die in such an ugly way?

She had clearly said that she was obsessed with looks.

He cared so much about her feelings, but he was still unrecognizable when he died.

She stretched out her hand to reach out and grab Kingsley’s hand, which was gradually turning cold and stiff.

He had promised her to go home, but now, he was dead in a foreign country.

Jeanne’s tears streamed down her face.

‘Kingsley, did I not tell you? I’m so glad I met you.’

“When I thought that family was the most disgusting thing in the world, you were the one who made me feel the warmth of family. You were the one who made me feel that there were still family members who loved me so much in this world.”

The pain that Jeanne was enduring was becoming more and more obvious.

Edward stood behind her, watching her hold Kingsley’s hand as she tried to hold back her tears.

She probably did not dare to release all her emotions, for fear that she would break down completely.

“Jeanne,” Edward said.

His voice was extremely hoarse. He had been holding himself back as much as Jeanne.

At least, Jeanne could hate him all she wanted. However, he had no right to hate anyone.

“Don’t be like this.” Edward tried to comfort her.

The words that came out of his mouth sounded so powerless.
