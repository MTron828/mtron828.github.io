Chapter 634: Monica Was Drunk and Walked Into the Wrong Door

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the detention center, Alexander glared at Jenifer and Joshua. He finally saw how cold-blooded they were toward him.

To think he would end up in this situation in the end.

His entire body was in excruciating pain, and he seemed to have lost consciousness.

He said fiercely, “I won’t sign it!”

“Alexander, you don’t want to live anymore, do you?” Jenifer’s disguise had disappeared, and her tone was threatening.

“Either I won’t be sentenced to death, or you’ll wait for me to die and for the inheritance to be evenly distributed!” Alexander raised his voice. He was probably fuming.

Although he had not achieved anything in his life, he had never thought he would live such a miserable life!

He had been raising someone else’s daughter, the woman whom he had thought like him only coveted his money, the son he had always wanted to nurture was actually an ingrate, and now, he was about to be sentenced to death.

“Hahahaha...” Alexander suddenly laughed crazily.

That was the life he thought was good!

His craziness made Jenifer and Joshua’s faces extremely ugly.

Fortunately, they had expected Alexander to threaten them with the shares.

With Alexander, a person who would not take responsibility for things and only choose to run away, he definitely would not give them his only bargaining chip so easily. He would definitely use the bargaining chip to ask them to do a lot of things, but now, they did not want to waste time dealing with him.

Jenifer gave Joshua a look, which Joshua immediately understood.

He grabbed Alexander’s hand fiercely and placed the share-transfer document in front of Alexander. Then, he handed Alexander a pen. “Dad, if you don’t want to suffer any more physical pain, I advise you to sign it immediately. I don’t have the patience to wait any longer!”

“I said I won’t sign... Ah!” Alexander screamed again.

Due to Alexander’s refusal, Joshua stabbed the tip of the pen into the back of Alexander’s hand.

Alexander was instantly in so much pain that it was unbearable to look at. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Joshua stabbed the pen into the back of Alexander’s hand harder and harder. At the same time, he threatened Alexander again in his ear. “Dad, I have 10,000 ways to torture you!”

“You unfilial son! One day, God will... Ah!” Alexander screamed even louder.

Joshua said, “It’s none of your business what happens to me. You won’t be able to see it in your lifetime anyway! Sign it right now!”

Joshua inserted more force into the stab.

As the entire tip of the pen sank into Alexander’s flesh, the pain was so painful that Alexander could no longer bear it.

He had no choice but to compromise with the mother and son. “I’ll sign it.”

Joshua smiled coldly.

Jenifer, on the other hand, was unmoved by what Alexander was experiencing.

Joshua took the pen from the back of his hand and handed it to Alexander.

Alexander’s hands were trembling as he looked at the black-and-white words in front of him.

His vision was blurry.

He was so old that he had long forgotten what it felt like to cry. At that moment, he could not control the tears from welling up in his aged eyes.

It was probably not just from the pain in his body, but he was also grieving for his life.

He signed his name, and after Joshua received the signed document, he did not look at Alexander again.

He said to his mother happily, “It’s done.”

Jenifer took a look at it and nodded before they both left. They were not reluctant to part with Alexander at all.

After all, he would be useless to them once he signed it.

Alexander was thrown back into the cell by the prison guards.

There, he lay on the cold hard bed and looked at the tiny room surrounded by wild roses. Suddenly, he knew that his life had come to an end.

Thinking back on his life, he had never succeeded in anything.

His grades had been bad since he was young, and his father constantly beat and scolded him.

He liked Penelope, but she only wanted his “family assets”. Now he finally knew that Penelope did not want his family property and only wanted to give her child a reasonable reason to be born, he regretted killing her back then. If she had not died, he would not be so sad now.

He would not be sad to know that Jenifer was the one coveting his money or that his son could be so cruel to him. He, too, would not use his extreme methods to kill his biological father and end up in this situation.
