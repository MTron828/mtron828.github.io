“It can’t be fake,” the woman said. “I have a friend who’s very close to Mia. Every time she talks about Mia, she says that she’s a godsend. She’s good-looking, has a good figure, and is well-educated. In short, she’s amazing.”

The other pouted. She looked like she had nothing else to say, but she was also jealous and did not echo the same sentiment as the other woman.

“Sigh!” The woman sighed. “Outstanding people deserve to be with outstanding people. I have no idea when people like us will be able to find a good man who’s of equal social status!”

“Why? Do you want to get married?” the woman teased.

“Don’t you want to?”

“I don’t want to. I haven’t had enough fun.”

“You don’t mean what you say.”

As the women were arguing in the elevator, the elevator soon arrived at the lobby. Then, Shelly held Bella’s hand, walked out of the elevator, and walked straight out of the hall.

Halfway through the banquet hall, Sarah called her from afar, “Shelly.” Shelly looked at Sarah. “What’s wrong?”

“I’ve been so busy today that I almost forgot. There’s a high school class reunion next month. Let’s go together.”

“No thanks.” Shelly refused. “In all these years, when have I ever gone for a class reunion?”

She really was not interested. Sarah would always invite her to her class reunions, and every time, she would firmly reject her.

“Shelly, just join us for once! You haven’t shown your face once in so many years that everyone in the class thinks you’ve disappeared. The class representative called me and told me to bring you along this time no matter what. Shelly, just promise me you’ll go, okay?”

“Sarah. ”

“Just once. If you go this time, I won’t force you next time. I promise. And I definitely won’t let those b*stards talk about you or let them ask about your life and so on. I guarantee that it won’t be awkward for you.” Sarah swore.

Shelly was no match for Sarah’s determination. Besides, she did not want Sarah to bombard her every time there was a class reunion.

“In that case, let me say this first. If I go this time, you can’t force me again in the future.”

“I promise.” Sarah nodded quickly. Shelly thought about it and agreed hesitantly. “Okay.”

“Hooray!” Sarah jumped with joy.

Sometimes, Shelly wondered whether they were the same age. Sarah was more lively than her, but Sarah’s personality was very similar to Monica’s. As expected, they were a family.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll see you then,” Shelly said.

“Where are you going?” Sarah frowned. “The party is still going on. Are you leaving?

“Yeah. I don’t feel comfortable staying here, so I’ve decided to take Bella and leave.”

“Where’s Nox?” Sarah asked.

“Nox is drunk and sleeping in his room.”

“Between you and him?”

“There’s no progress,” Shelly said bluntly.

Upon hearing that, Sarah did not ask further. She said, “A man like Nox is not suitable to be a husband. If possible, you should leave him as soon as possible. It’s not worth wasting too much of your time on him.”

“I know.”

“In any case, you’re more mature than me, and you always know what you’re doing, even though it’s not good for you sometimes,” Sarah concluded and sighed. “I’ll leave it at that. Remember you’ve promised me to be at the class reunion.”

“Alright.” Shelly nodded. “I’ll see you.”

“Okay.”

Shelly walked out of the hall with Bella, hailed a taxi, and left.

When they were in the car, Bella finally could not help but ask, “Mommy, are you and Daddy going to separate?”

In the elevator, she heard that her father was going to be with another woman, and just now, she heard Aunty Sarah saying that he was not great.

Bella had been sensitive since she was young and had matured a little earlier than others in many things. Therefore, she probably understood some of the more complicated feelings.

“Bella, Daddy and I are not the normal couple you see on television. We’ll separate sooner or later.”

“Why?” Bella did not understand.

She could tell that her father loved her mother so much. She had caught her father secretly looking at her mother many times, and he was always staring at her in a daze.

“You’ll come to understand many things when you grow up.” Shelly found an excuse. “But right now, all you have to do is be obedient, eat well, and study well. As for the rest, it’s grown-up things.”

“But I don’t want Daddy and Mommy to be separated.” Bella felt rather upset.

She had always thought that she had a complete family that consisted of a mother and a father, which she had. Yet now, her mother told her that she would not be with her father. That meant that she could only live with her mother in the future.

The more she thought about it, the more upset she felt. Slowly, Bella’s eyes reddened, and she burst into tears..
