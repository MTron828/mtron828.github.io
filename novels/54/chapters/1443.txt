Chapter 1444: George Was Moved

He looked at the person in front of him with unfocused eyes and nodded obediently.

Only then did Candice let go of his hand. Once she made sure that he did not move, she got up and poured him a glass of water. Then, she helped George up from the bed.

As George lay in her arms, the familiar feeling made George’s eyes turn red. Tears instantly streamed down his face.

Candice was shocked. “George, are you in great pain? Hold on, Dr. Jones will be here soon.”

“Mom…” George suddenly called out.

Candice’s body stiffened.

“Mom,” George called her.

He seemed to be muddle-headed from the fever and was talking to himself.

“Mom, I miss you so much,” George said uncomfortably.

His tears fell like a waterfall.

“I really miss you…’

Candice did not know how to respond to George. She could only feel the pain in her heart at that moment. It was as if a thousand-pound boulder was pressing down on her chest, making it hard for her to breathe.

Her throat moved slightly, and she said in a somewhat unsettled voice, “George, be good. Mom is by your side.” “Mom.” George hugged Candice even tighter. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Here, drink some water,” Candice coaxed George.

George opened his mouth obediently, and Candice fed him a few mouthfuls. “George, do you want more?” Candice asked him gently.

Seeing George shaking his head, Candice put the cup aside and helped George back to bed. After that, she got up and wanted to give him another physical cooling, but George grabbed her hand tightly.

“Mom, don’t leave me.” George seemed to sense that Candice was about to leave.

He grabbed her hand tightly and refused to let go. His grip was strong, and it was unlike the strength of a ten-year-old child at all.

Of course, it was not that she could not break free, but she just could not bear to. She felt that George was so fragile at that moment that she seemed to have become his whole world, even though he had mistaken her for someone else.

She said, “Okay, I won’t leave you. Be good and sleep, okay?”

“Mom, don’t go…” George muttered.

He was really afraid that she would leave.

“I won’t leave. I promise you that I will never leave you again.” “Mom…” George closed his eyes again but was still calling out to her.

Just then, Finn walked in from the door.

He was really on call. It was so late at night, yet he was awake when he received her call.

“How’s George?” Finn came over to check on George’s body condition while taking his temperature. “He’s a little groggy.”

Finn nodded.

“39-5 degrees. He has a high fever. I’m going to give him an injection to reduce his fever.”

“Alright.”

As Finn spoke, he quickly prepared a needle and injected it into George’s butt.

After he was done, he said, “Usually, the temperature will drop within half an hour, but after the temperature drops, it can rise up again, and there’s no need to panic. A child’s fever is a process.”

“Okay.” Candice nodded.

She did not realize that Finn’s tone of voice sounded like he was giving an explanation to George’s parents.

“By the way, George kept screaming in pain just now,” Candice quickly said.

“The wound on his leg should hurt for a while, and when it’s healing, it will be itchier. The painkillers contain anesthetics, so I don’t recommend them often. How about this? I’ll stay here tonight. If George cries out in pain again, I’ll give him an appropriate injection.”

“Alright.”

By then, George had fallen asleep. Although he did not sleep well, he did not cry out in pain.

“You go to sleep first. I’ll continue to accompany him,” Finn said.

Although Candice wanted to accompany George, she figured George might have a fever during the day and might need to be taken care of. If she went back to sleep now, she could take care of him tomorrow. With that thought in mind, she nodded and prepared to leave.

However, George held her hand tightly.

Finn saw it too, and he could not help but laugh. “It looks like George can’t bear to see you leave.”

“George has mistaken me for his mother.” Candice smiled.

Finn did not say much.

“How about this? You go to sleep. Since George needs to be taken care of tomorrow, I’ll sleep tomorrow, and you guys watch over him,” Candice suggested.

Finn nodded. “I’ll go to sleep when George’s temperature drops.”

“Sure.”

Just like that, the two of them waited for George’s fever to subside.

In less than 30 minutes, George was covered in sweat, and his temperature quickly dropped to 38 degrees..
