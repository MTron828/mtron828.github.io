Chapter 182: The “Married Couple” Fights

In the bedroom.

Jeanne was forcibly brought back to Edward’s bedroom.

She gritted her teeth and glared at the man in front of her.

Did he not know that her time was very precious?

She only had five days left to investigate the truth of her case.

Fourth Master Swan was probably really trying to kill her!

“What do you want to do?” Jeanne asked, her tone a little cold.

Anyone would not have a good attitude at this time.

Edward responded, “I’ve already brought you here, Ms. Lawrence. What do you think I want to do?”

“At least let me go and take a shower!” Jeanne said, “Of course, if you don’t mind that I didn’t shower in the detention center yesterday, we can also start directly.”

Jeanne did not feel that Fourth Master Swan was going to let her go.

Other than Nox, who was secretly watching the show at the door, the huge room was quiet. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How nasty am I to you, Ms. Lawrence?” Edward suddenly asked.

“Well, take it as I’m the nasty one instead.” Jeanne was indifferent. “I thought that when a man can’t get it, he’ll especially want it. Just like Eden.”

“Am I the same as all men?”

“You’re naturally different. However, to me, other than George, all other men are the same.”

“Ms. Lawrence, do you know that it’s very dangerous for you to treat me like this?!” Edward was cold.

The sudden aura made Nox, who was standing at the door, feel a chill down his spine.

Jeanne was really bold.

How could she say that Edward could not even be compared to a little brat?!

“How would I not be in danger then? Tell me, and I’ll change.” Jeanne was clearly showing weakness, but her tone and expression did not show it at all.

Edward looked at Jeanne coldly.

“Fourth Master, I’m very busy.” Jeanne did not seem to have thought of wasting her time on this.

In fact, she was merely following his footsteps. How could she change?!

If she could change, she would not have to face so many things.

Kingsley was right.

Jeanne abhorred evil and would not admit defeat even if she died!

She would not lower her head to anyone. This was her bottom line in life!

Jeanne took a deep breath and her tone became gentle. “Melody is accusing me of having 30 million dollars for personal gain. According to the laws of Harken, I’ll be sentenced to more than 10 years. Judging from her current hostility toward me, it wouldn’t be too much for her to add another 10 years to that. I don’t want to spend my entire life in prison, so I need to find evidence.”

“I won’t let you go to jail,” Edward said clearly.

“But I only believe in myself.”

“Jeanne!” Edward called her name.

It was rare for Fourth Master Swan to call her so directly.

“Is it so hard to believe in me?”

“It’s hard.” Jeanne nodded. “Seven years ago, I didn’t wait for you to save me. Now, I don’t need to either.”

Edward’s expression changed slightly.

“Fourth Master, don’t take it to heart. In the end, you and I only met by chance and slept together for one night. I tried to use that to get you to stand up for me. After thinking about it carefully, it was indeed my wishful thinking. No matter what, you and Eden are Swans. How can I expect you to stand on my side?”

“Are you brooding over what happened seven years ago?” Edward asked her.

“No, I’m very relieved. I only hope that you can let it go. If you feel that you suffered a loss and that you wasted a night on me back then, you can return it to me now.” Jeanne was especially calm. “Let me take a shower. I can’t sleep with you like this.”

Edward pursed his lips tightly and looked at her.

Jeanne did not want to be outdone and looked back at him.

Kingsley was right.

She could not get entangled with Fourth Master Swan anymore.

There were too many external factors. She could only use the fastest method to cut the tie with Fourth Master Swan.

Perhaps the words she said today had provoked Fourth Master Swan.

She had thought of parting with Fourth Master Swan peacefully and not interacting with him anymore.

Nonetheless, it was clear that her previous rejection did not achieve the effect she wanted.

This time, Jeanne could only make things worse.

In the silent space, Edward suddenly let go of her.

Jeanne looked at him.

She felt that the warm touch on her wrist had suddenly disappeared.

Then, she pursed her lips.

She smiled and said, “Then I’ll go take a shower.”

Edward was expressionless, but he nodded.

Nox stood at the door and could not help but laugh internally.

As expected, men were animals that only wanted to have sex.

‘He even ridiculed me the last time?!

‘He still gave in after being seduced by Jeanne,’ Nox thought to himself.

Earlier, when Jeanne said to sleep with Fourth Master Swan, he did not immediately agree. Nox thought that Fourth Master Swan was different from other men.

In the end, it was still the same! The next time Fourth Master Swan mocked Nox again, he would definitely retort!

As Nox wondered, he suddenly saw Jeanne, who was originally walking toward the bathroom, suddenly rush toward the door.

Nox widened his eyes and saw Jeanne rushing toward him at lightning speed.

What surprised him even more was that Fourth Master Swan seemed to know all of her actions and blocked the door before she got there.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Of course.

How could she possibly sleep with Fourth Master Swan again?

She would not use her body to achieve her wish.

Jeanne was just trying to create a diversion, trying to slip away from Fourth Master Swan.

She did not expect that Fourth Master Swan seemed to have seen through her thoughts long ago and stood right in front of her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

She suddenly kicked toward Fourth Master Swan.

Since she could not think of any other way, she could only fight head-on.

Fourth Master Swan grabbed her foot.

Jeanne took advantage of Fourth Master Swan’s help and leaped into the air. She then kicked at his head.

Edward was quick-witted.

He let go of Jeanne and took a few steps back.

Jeanne flipped over and landed on the ground.

At the next second, another punch was fiercely thrown at Fourth Master Swan.

In the room, the sounds of an incomparably loud fight were heard.

There were punches and kicks.

Nox was shocked.

He knew that Jeanne knew some martial arts, but he did not expect that she would be so powerful.

She was not considered top-notch.

Even so, every move she made was absolutely fatal.

This was completely different from the usual taekwondo. Free-for-all martial arts were mainly for show. At worst, one could protect oneself. On the other hand, Jeanne’s moves were aggressive.

Edward kept retreating and was forced to the wall of the bedroom by Jeanne.

Jeanne did not stop at all. She kicked hard at Fourth Master Swan’s face.

‘F*ck.’

Nox cursed internally.

‘Isn’t Jeanne afraid that Fourth Master Swan’s face will be ruined? If that happens, it would be a national loss. He’s equivalent to a national treasure.’

Luckily, Edward turned his body sideways and dodged.

He dodged that moment.

There was an obvious dent on the wall from a high heel shoe.

The strength was simply shocking.

Jeanne did not stop. She aimed at Fourth Master Swan again and swiftly kicked him.

Fourth Master Swan’s back was hit by Jeanne’s kick.

“Hiss.” Nox could not help but exclaim.

‘Ouch.’

Even Nox felt that it was painful.

However, after receiving that kick, Fourth Master Swan was still able to remain expressionless.

He was kicked a few steps back by Jeanne.

Despite that, he stabilized his body and turned around to look at Jeanne.

At this moment, Jeanne seemed to be resting and paused for a moment.

Both of them were drenched in sweat.

Edward asked, “Is this the limit of your martial arts?!”

Jeanne looked at Fourth Master Swan warily.

Had he been avoiding her all this while just to test her martial arts skill?!

“Watch out, Ms. Lawrence.”

Jeanne frowned.

Next, she felt Fourth Master Swan’s strong attack like a gust of wind.

Edward took the initiative to attack.

Jeanne gritted her teeth and faced him head-on.

The two of them exchanged blows, and it was a fierce fight.

Nox just watched from the side.

He watched Fourth Master Swan fight with Jeanne without holding back.

Jeanne was quite capable.

A normal person would not be able to hold on for so long without being beaten down by Fourth Master Swan, who was like a monster. Jeanne held on for at least ten minutes.

In those ten minutes, every time Nox saw Fourth Master Swan move his fists and legs, he felt a throbbing pain.

Fourth Master Swan had probably forgotten how serious his injury was at the moment.

If this continued...

Would Nox have to collect Fourth Master Swan’s corpse?

Fortunately, Fourth Master Swan finally restrained Jeanne.

He pressed her fiercely against the wall. No matter how hard she struggled, she could not move.

Fourth Master Swan asked, “Do you admit defeat?”

He expressed himself clearly with those words.
