1167 The War Has Started: William Gates’s Identity Exposed

When Jeanne left Warren’s study, she ran into Chester again.

During this period of time, Chester would come to Warren whenever he had the slightest opportunity as he was anxious and afraid of losing favor.

He looked at Jeanne with an ugly expression.

He had heard that Jeanne played chess with Warren every day, but he did not know what they talked about in private.

Every time he asked, Jeanne would tell him that they said nothing, that there were no plans at all. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yet, every time, he would still ask, “What did father tell you today?”

Jeanne looked at Chester.

“It’s fine if you don’t want to tell me.” Chester seemed impatient.

Jeanne said bluntly, “He told me not to tell you”

It meant that there was a plan this time, but she could not tell him.

Chester’s expression changed, and he looked at Jeanne coldly. “What do you mean?”

“Exactly what I said. Big brother, you’ve always been wise and intelligent. There’s no way you wouldn’t understand what I mean.”

“Are you showing off?” Finally, Chester could not hold it in any longer and lost his temper.

“Big brother, aren’t you being too sensitive? I’m just telling you that I can’t tell you many things because of father’s orders. I don’t know why you would misunderstand me like this!” Jeanne looked very innocent.

Chester’s expression turned ugly. “You’d better not be too full of yourself. You’re just a daughter of the Sanders. No matter how smart and capable you are, you’re just like water that has been spilled.”

“You’re right.” Jeanne said to his back as he left, “Harken is a place that favors boys over girls, so I naturally can’t do anything. However, you shouldn’t be too proud and complacent of yourself either. You’re not the only son in the Sanders.”

“What are you talking about?” Chester suddenly stopped in his tracks and glared at Jeanne.

Jeanne smiled faintly. “I’m just reminding you that there’s really no meaning this time. Big brother, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.”

Without waiting for Chester’s approval, she left.

Chester glared at Jeanne’s back and walked angrily to Warren’s study. He slowly calmed himself down and knocked on the door.

“Father.”

“I have something to deal with, so you don’t have to come over and report to me alone. If there’s anything, we can talk tomorrow.” Warren directly refused his entry.

Chester was so angry that he flung his hand away and left.

…

At night, Warren told everyone to have dinner together.

Usually, even if they lived in the Sanders’ residence, each courtyard would have its own life, and they rarely gathered together.

However, it seemed to be because of Jeanne’s return that there were often such family dinners.

The family sat around a table.

Everyone was originally happy, but they saw Warren’s serious expression.

He said, “Before we eat, I have something to announce.”

Since Warren was serious, the others naturally became serious as well.

“Before I announce this, everyone, please hand over your phones,” Warren ordered.

Since he treated everyone equally, no one had anything to say about it. Although everyone was surprised, they still voluntarily handed their phones to the servants beside them.

The servant took them all and locked them in the safe beside them.

The key was passed to Warren, who accepted it.

Then, he said, “I think everyone here is clear about the Sanders’ current situation. “Now, the Duncans’ descendant is getting restless, but we still don’t know who he is. I have to admit that I’m a little worried because of this person’s existence. Thus, in order to prove everyone’s innocence and let us trust each other, we can only choose to investigate blindly. We’ll start with the most important people around me.”

The whole family looked at Warren, and everyone except Jeanne was a little surprised.

Jeanne glanced at William without batting an eyelid and saw that he did not react much.

“I’m not targeting any of us here, nor do I suspect any of you. But in order to dispel everyone’s concerns and be more honest, I have to verify all of us present.” Warren said coldly, “That’s why I want to see if your DNA matches the Duncans’ descendant.”

No one dared to object or have any opinions.
