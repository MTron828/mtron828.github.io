1355 I Actually Don’t Love You That Much

They had to admit that Nox’s words made them lament how much things had changed and how unexpectedly things had turned out.

Edward nodded as he, too, never thought that everything would turn out like that.

“Are you getting along well with Candice?” Finn asked.

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

The moment he nodded, the corners of his mouth curled into a smile.

Finn could clearly feel the change in his emotions. In fact, he did not even need to ask to know that it would be good.

After all, Candice was…

He said, “Do you plan to keep it going?”

Some things did not need to be said directly for Edward to know what he was talking about. That was probably the tacit understanding they had had since they grew up together.

He said, “For now.”

Although he was very selfish, he… did not dare to take the risk. With her, he had never dared to take risks.

Finn did not say anything more. Instead, He poured another glass of wine and started drinking with Edward. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Did you break up with Monica?” Edward asked about him at that moment.

“It’s not considered a breakup.” Finn did not hide anything from Edward. “I just want to start over with Monica again, from dating to getting married. Maybe because we’ve been living together all this time, and we might be living together for the rest of our lives, I have to admit that I want a child.”

Therefore, he did not want to continue this stalemate with Monica.

He felt that from the moment they broke up, they could regain their feelings for each other and Monica’s confidence in him.

“Alright.” Edward nodded.

He could only be concerned about personal matters like relationships. After all, other than the people involved, no one else could empathize with a relationship.

After singing for a while, Nox went back to them and started drinking. He looked like he really wanted to get drunk.

Despite that, it was obvious that as time passed, as they grew older and their responsibilities increased, they could no longer go wild.

Edward left early, and even though he had drunk quite a bit, he was definitely not drunk.

It was only 11 p.m. when he left. However, to Edward, 11 p.m. was considered pretty late.

At that time, he either had to go to bed or would still be dealing with official business, so he should not be drinking and having fun outside.

Nox was visibly upset with Edward leaving, but he could not stop Edward. After all, to Edward, it was groundbreaking for him to spend so much time with them tonight.

No matter what, Nox knew his place.

Feeling a little depressed, he asked Finn, “Finn, do you think Edward is happy?”

Finn looked at Nox and smiled. “It’s hard to say for sure about the old Edward, but I think he will be in the future.”

Nox frowned.

Finn seemed to know a lot of things that he did not.

“It’s getting late. Let’s go.” Finn did not explain further.

“You’re leaving so early?!” Nox could not accept it at all. “I can forget about Edward because tomorrow is the wedding day. I understand that he wants to rest and maintain his best condition. However, you’re single and don’t have to satisfy a woman. Why are you going back so early?!”

Finn was rendered speechless by Nox’s words. He really did not know how to talk to Nox sometimes.

“Anyway, you can’t just leave like this.” Nox would not let Finn off. “None of us is allowed to leave this place until we’re drunk tonight.”

“Your behavior is making me think that you want to get drunk because of love,” Finn said bluntly.

“What?!”

“I’ve always suspected that you have improper thoughts about Edward. I didn’t dare to confirm it before, but now, I suddenly think that–”

“Finn, how could you come up with such a ridiculous reason just because you don’t want to drink with me? F*ck!” Nox cursed.

Finn smiled and said, “It’s getting late. Goodbye.”

“Hey.” Nox watched as Finn left.

‘Damn it. How disappointing!’

Nox, as stubborn as he was, decided to drink to his heart’s content even if he was alone in the private room.

As he leaned back on the sofa and faced the luxurious private room, he thought, ‘No. I refuse to accept that I can’t have fun in a place like this anymore, that I’ve reached the age where I don’t like to have fun in such a place anymore!”

Still, he continued drinking until he found the wine bitter.

When he could not take it anymore, he left the room.
