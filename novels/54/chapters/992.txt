993 Glib-Tongued, Monica’s Imposing Presence

The press conference instantly burst into an uproar. The twist in the situation was completely unexpected.

Daniel could not stay calm anymore.

Did they not say that everything was ready and that he only needed to announce the results in person?

The sudden change in the situation was completely out of his expectations.

He was embarrassed, but fortunately, the reporters’ attention was all on the forensic pathologist and Monica.

“Dr. Green, are you saying that the child’s death has nothing to do with the vaccine?”

“Yes,” Jacob Green replied.

“But the report given by the quality inspection department states that there is a problem with the vaccine. How do you explain that?” the reporter asked anxiously.

“Whether there’s a problem with the vaccine or not is not my responsibility to find out. What I’m telling everyone now is that the child’s death has nothing to do with the vaccine. He died from potassium cyanide poisoning.”

“Who can prove that your autopsy report is true? Are you fabricating the truth?” the reporter asked.

“This report was personally issued by me and stamped by the forensics department. I can guarantee the absolute authenticity of this report. Of course, if anyone has any doubts about me, the child’s body is still here. You can apply for another autopsy on the child,” Jacob said sternly.

His confidence made all the reporters believe him.

At that moment, they quickly turned their attention to the head of the quality inspection department, Daniel Cook.

“Director Cook, do you have anything to say about the different results given by the forensics department?”

“Is there a problem with your report, or is the autopsy report false?”

“Director Cook, please give us an explanation.”

Daniel was sweating profusely. The reporters had put him on the spot.

After all, he was able to take on the position of the head of the quality inspection department because of his adaptability.

He said, “The quality inspection department can’t give everyone a clear answer to this incident, but all I can say is that our report was done fairly and justly. As for whether there is a possibility that there was a mistake during the quality inspection process because of time constraints, I can’t jump to a conclusion now. Of course, I’m not excluding that there won’t be any problems with the autopsy report. Personally, I think that this matter should be re-verified.”

As he spoke, he was planning to end the press conference right away.

“Actually, all we have to do is inject the vaccine on the spot to know if there’s a problem with it,” Monica said directly.

Daniel’s expression was extremely unsightly, and Monica’s unexpected move made him panic.

Monica did not ignore Daniel’s reaction. She said into the microphone, “Cardellini Pharmaceutical has been dedicated to drug research and development for hundreds of years, and we have always regulated our drugs to an extremely perverted extent. For so many years, there has never been a medical accident in Cardellini Pharmaceutical, and our Cardellini Enterprise can not afford to bear the slander!

“What are you doing?” Daniel whispered in Monica’s ear.

Monica sneered. “The vaccine is for a six-year-old child, and it just so happens that my godson is six years old this year and has not been vaccinated. I will get someone to vaccinate my godson in public so that everyone can see whether there is a problem with the vaccine or not.”

“I don’t agree!” Daniel’s expression was serious as he said righteously to everyone, “I absolutely do not agree with anyone being vaccinated before we know whether there is a problem with the vaccine! This is disregarding human life. Monica, it is not right for you to sacrifice a child for the sake of Cardellini Enterprise’s reputation!”

“Director Cook, I’ve already made it very clear that there’s no problem at all with the vaccine. Everything I’m doing now is to clear Cardellini Enterprise’s name and to give an explanation to the millions of families who have been vaccinated by Cardellini Pharmaceutical! Of course, we also have to answer to the boy who died because of the vaccine,” Monica said righteously.

Daniel was speechless.

Did they not say that Monica was useless? Had she rehearsed those lines in advance? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Even if that was the case, the confidence and aura she had when she spoke were not something that an ordinary person could display.

“I just don’t want to risk anyone’s life.” Daniel was still trying his best to defend himself.

“Is it that you don’t want to risk anyone’s life, or are you afraid that the outcome will be different from what you think?”
