Chapter 612: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He slammed Jonathan’s head against the floor until Jonathan did not resist or struggle anymore.

By then, Jonathan was dead.

Everyone at the scene saw how cruel Alexander was. It was the side he had never shown anyone.

When the video ended, everyone felt a chill down their spine, and a wave of fear overtook them.

They looked at Alexander, who had been exposed in front of everyone, in shock. After seeing the video, Alexander could not even stand properly.

His face was pale, and his body was trembling.

His frightened appearance at that moment was a stark contrast to the cruel man in the video.

His mouth kept opening and closing, and his eyes were empty.

It seemed he wanted to say something, but he did not know what else to say because it was useless to say anything.

He had killed his father with his own hands, and that matter had been exposed to everyone.

It was as if he did not know what to think anymore. His mind was blank, and only his body was trembling with fear.

While everyone was looking at Alexander with fear and trepidation, Jeanne gave Alexander a hard slap on the face.

“Slap!”

It was loud and even knocked Alexander to the ground.

However, at that moment, no one dared to step forward and say a single word. No one dared to say that Jeanne was rebellious.

On the contrary, after seeing the video just now, they all wished they could beat Alexander, that hateful man, to death.

Jeanne said, “I really want to kill you on grandpa’s behalf!”

Alexander fell to the ground, his entire body trembling.

He probably did not expect he would be exposed.

He had not enjoyed any authority or taken control of his family yet. How could he just... lose everything just like that?

Suddenly, Alexander got up from the ground, looking unusually ferocious.

He rushed toward the huge television screen like he had gone mad and grabbed it before throwing it on the ground toward everyone.

“Ah!” People at the scene screamed.

The hall was in chaos.

Old Master Swan protected George behind him while Finn stood in front of Jeanne, and Michael protected Monica.

The others could not help but move further away.

They kept their distance as they watched Alexander go crazy. He suddenly roared, “It’s all lies. These are all lies. They’re not real. None of them are real!”

On the other hand, Jeanne was expressionless. She glanced at Jenifer, who also did not approach Alexander, but her expression was ugly.

With Alexander’s act of killing his father exposed, Alexander was dead for sure!

As for Jenifer, she never thought that Jeanne would be so capable.

The last time she schemed against Jeanne, the latter took out an indecent video she filmed of Jasmine and made Jasmine lose all her status in the Swans. Jasmine was even terribly humiliated. This time, it was the same, and Jeanne was able to film evidence of their crimes. What in the world? How did Jeanne do it?

How did Jeanne do so many things without them knowing? Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It was as if she had made preparations in advance and wanted them to die.

She glared at Alexander’s crazed look.

At that moment, she did not have any feelings for Alexander. All she was thinking about was how she should protect herself from now on.

As the scene was still chaotic, Jeanne whispered into Finn’s ear, “Call the police.”

“I already did,” Finn replied.

The moment Jeanne took out the video, Finn called the police because he knew that Jeanne had evidence.

Jeanne smiled gratefully, and Finn returned the smile.

At the same time, Monica unintentionally caught sight of the interaction between Finn and Jeanne and gritted her teeth.

She was not jealous. After all, nothing was going on or would go on between Finn and Jeanne.

She just… had not seen Finn smile for a long time.

He was cold to her, like a stranger.

In the hall, other than Alexander, who was going crazy and self-destructing, the others were also at a loss as to what to do. It was as if they were waiting for that farce to end.

About ten minutes later, the police arrived.

They went up and directly handcuffed Alexander.

Alexander resisted like mad. At that moment, he had completely lost all reason. He looked as if he had gone crazy and had no care for his image. “Let go of me! Let go of me! What right do you have to arrest me!”

The police did not waste time on Alexander. They just went forward and said to Jeanne, “Please accompany me to the police station.”

“I have to deal with my grandfather’s funeral before reporting to the police station. Is that alright?” Jeanne asked.

The policeman nodded. “Yes, but we will detain him.”

“Alright.”

The policeman immediately dragged Alexander away and took him away from the Lawrence family’s manor.

“Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me–”

Alexander’s heart-wrenching cries reverberated throughout the entire hall.

Only after a long time did people in the hall start to whisper again. “I never thought Alexander would kill his father.”

“It’s too cruel and too bloody.”

“How could he do it? How could he be so cruel?”

“Just thinking about the scene of Alexander killing his father makes me scared. This is simply not something a human would do...”

Amidst the discussion, a sudden collision shocked everyone.

Everyone watched in horror as Jenifer suddenly slammed her head into the wall of the hall.

In the next second, her forehead was covered in blood as she fell to the ground.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed as she thought, ‘What the hell is Jenifer going to do this time?’
