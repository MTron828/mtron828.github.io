Chapter 848 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

Monica just looked on. She felt more and more embarrassed by the minute. How could she have danced like that? In ancient times, she probably would have drowned in a pig cage for what she had done.

She put down her phone and covered herself with the blanket. She did not care anymore. It was time for her to run!

...

Bamboo Garden.

Finn and Nox were having breakfast in the living room. For the past few days, the two of them had been closely watching over Edward.

Nox was looking at his phone, eating his porridge, when suddenly, he choked and vomited so hard he almost fainted. Finn frowned and glanced at Nox, taking in his disgusting appearance. George had a look of disdain as well. So he moved his butt closer to Finn and kept his distance from Nox.

Once Nox had regained his composure, he wiped his mouth and roared, “Monica is simply a disaster.”

Finn’s brows furrowed even more. He did not know what Nox was up to.

“I almost burped.” Nox took a deep breath.

No one seemed bothered with Nox. He leaned closer to Finn, asking, “Have you seen the news today?”

“I haven’t.”

“Would you like to see it?”

“Not really.”

“Are you sure?” Nox’s smiled strangely.

Finn remained unmoved.

“It’s about Monica,” Nox added.

Finn put down his bowl and chopsticks. “I’m done,” and left.

Nox looked at Finn’s back, “Boring.”

He glanced at George with an evil smile. As George did not like him too, he lowered his head and ate.

Nox could not help but sigh. It seems he was the only normal man left in this world.

After breakfast…

Finn went to Edward’s room to change his dressing. After making sure his body was under surveillance and recovering according to his treatment, he left Edward’s room and returned to the living room.

In the hall, Nox was still looking at his phone. It seemed today’s news had piqued his interest.

He watched as Finn went downstairs and said, “The melons today are very interesting.”

Finn ignored him. He was sorting out all the first aid kits in the house, making sure everything was in place just in case he needed them at the last minute.

“Finn.” Nox walked over to his side. Finn only lowered his head and continued tidying up.

“Just take a look,” Nox said.

Finn frowned.

“Please. I promise you won’t die of anger,” Nox lied.

Finn felt very annoyed by Nox. So he gave in and took a look. He saw a woman’s seductive figure on the screen, seducing men to her heart’s content. She was so sexy that it seemed to overflow through the screen.

Finn just watched on.

Nox frowned, “No reaction? Seriously?”

“How did you want me to react?” Finn looked away.

“F*ck. You’re not a man at all. Do you know how many men have been fantasizing about Monica recently? Of course, I didn’t when I knew it was Monica.” Nox quickly clarified herself.

Finn did not care at all.

“Monica’s about to get married, but she’s still hanging out at nightclubs. Isn’t she afraid of being beaten to death by Michael?” Nox could not help but wonder. The video had even been exposed on the news, and it was clear that people thought it was incredible.

“Maybe Michael can’t do anything to Monica…” Nox mumbled to himself, “I saw many people in the comments section saying that Michael indulges Monica too much, he’s too doting, or he doesn’t actually care that she went out to play. Some even said that Michael’s sex life is probably miserable.”

Finn remained expressionless.

“By the way, don’t you think you’ve lost out?” Nox suddenly asked Finn.

Finn tidied up the first aid kit.

“Have you ever touched Monica?” Nox asked.

He had felt that he had suffered a great loss. Finn should have slept with this woman until she could not get up. After so many years, Michael, that refined scumbag, had taken advantage of it! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yeah. I have,” Finn suddenly said.

Nox thought he had heard wrong. He looked at Finn in disbelief.

“You’ve really slept with Monica?” He was certain.

“Yeah.”

“No way! When? Why didn’t you say anything?” Nox had thought they were pure and always felt sorry for his brother!

“It was quite a long time ago.” Finn did not seem willing to say more.

“How did you feel after?” Nox gossiped.

In any case, Monica was no longer Finn’s woman.
