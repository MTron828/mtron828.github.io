After Jeanne read it, she said, “I have something to do now and need to leave the company. Call me if anything comes up.”

“Yes.”

With that, Jeanne took the documents and left immediately.

Forrest could feel a breeze when Director Lawrence walked past.

…

Jeanne got into Miles’s car.

Miles was originally George’s chauffeur. However, because Teddy had been keen to take care of George, and Jeanne could not reject Teddy’s enthusiasm, Teddy was the one to pick George up and send him off to school most of the time, leaving Miles free to be her chauffeur again.

The car drove toward the Lawrence family’s manor as Jeanne had some matters to discuss with Jonathan directly.

In the car, Jeanne kept looking at the personnel list and was even a little engrossed in it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Jeanne,” Miles suddenly said.

With her attention still on the list, she replied indifferently, “Yes.”

“Mr. Thorn said he has sent us more men.”

“I know.” Jeanne nodded. “He called me.”

“Do you know who it is?” Miles asked.

She shook her head. “He didn’t tell me.”

“Oh.” Miles did not say anything more after that, and silence filled the car again.

Jeanne was reading the personnel list, so she did not ask Miles if he knew who it was.

However, she did not care who it was as long as they could help her.

As soon as the car arrived at the Lawrence family’s manor, Jeanne got out of the car and walked straight in.

When the servants at home saw Jeanne’s sudden appearance, they were a little surprised, but they hurriedly called out, “Eldest Young Lady.”

In the past, the servants’ attitude toward her was cold. Even if they did things for her, they were not friendly.

Now, everyone was respectful toward her because they knew that the Eldest Young Lady married better than the Second Young Lady and that she was capable.

Right now, the Lawrences seemed to be supported by the Eldest Young Miss. Hence, they could not afford to offend the Eldest Young Miss.

In the meantime, Jenifer saw the servant’s attitude toward Jeanne and thought, ‘All that group of dogs know is to act pragmatically.’

She shifted her gaze to look at Jeanne, who ignored her and was heading straight upstairs.

“Oh, look at her now. She doesn’t even greet her elders when she sees them.” Jenifer’s sarcastic voice sounded in the living room.

Jeanne did not plan on wasting her time on Jenifer.

However, she turned her head to look at her and said coldly, “How can you still sit at home and have tea? For crying out loud, you’re an elder. I don’t know what kind of torture your daughter is going through in the Swans, but to think you can be carefree? You have opened my eyes to your true self.”

“You!” Jenifer stood up from the sofa.

“If I were you, I’d think of a way to save my daughter from the Swans instead of being here, enjoying myself.”

“Stop mocking me here! You just can’t wait for Jasmine to leave the Swans so that the Swans will be yours alone, right?” Jenifer’s expression was ugly.

“Are you so naive to think that Jasmine can still enjoy the treatment of the Swan’s Eldest Young Mistress? Eden didn’t immediately divorce Jasmine because he still needed Jasmine to keep his image. After all, he was the one who brought Jasmine into the family, and chasing Jasmine away just like that is not worth it... Once Jasmine is useless, or if Eden finds someone better...” Jeanne sneered, “Your Jasmine will be kicked out.”

“Don’t try to fool me here! Jasmine is my daughter. Her methods of coaxing men are top-notch–”

“It’s not enough because she uses the same method to coax other men. Think about it. If you had sex with other men, do you think my father would still dote on you?”

“Jeanne! Are you insulting me?”

“If that’s your reaction, do you think Eden will just let things rest? I used to hate Jasmine, but now, I suddenly think that Jasmine is very pitiful to have?such a cold-blooded and heartless mother!”

Utterly humiliated by Jeanne’s words, Jenifer rushed up to Jeanne. “You were the one who set up Jasmine and Sam!”

“Mother, if you didn’t use that kind of method to frame me, would I be able to turn your trick to my own and have you eat the fruits of your own doing?”

Jenifer was rendered speechless by what Jeanne said.

She really did not expect that Jeanne, who had returned seven years later, would act like a different person, which she could not stand.

At the thought of the embarrassment she suffered at the Swans that day, she was so angry that she wanted to kill Jeanne.

Even after she came back, she was slapped twice by Alexander. The first one was for teaching her daughter how to make a fool of herself, and the second was to vent his anger by letting Jasmine stay at the Swans.

Although Alexander knew that letting Jasmine stay was the best way for them to express their views on that matter, he still felt a little uneasy when he thought about the possibility that the daughter he had raised might suffer. However, in the end, he only vented his anger once before tacitly agreeing to let Jasmine stay.

Jenifer looked at Jeanne with a sinister look.

Seeing that Jeanne did not want to waste any more time and went straight upstairs, she hurriedly gave Alexander a call. “Hubby, Jeanne is back.”

Alexander’s face darkened.

“She seems to have gone to look for dad with some documents. Is she up to something–”

Alexander immediately hung up the phone and left the office.

What trick was Jeanne playing again by overriding his authority?
