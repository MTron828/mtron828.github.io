Chapter 384: I Won’t Let You Be Abused

A woman’s voice sounded. “Let him go!”

The man pinching Finn suddenly paused while the unresponsive man on the ground suddenly trembled.

“Let go of him!” Monica ran over and tried to push the bearded man away.

The bearded man had already released his grip, so he let go of Finn.

Monica lay on the ground and looked at Finn, who was bleeding from all seven orifices. She looked at his blood-red eyes that were looking straight at her.

At that moment, she saw his rage and knew that Finn was very angry.

She just knew she could not make Finn happy no matter what. He had used his own life to protect her, yet she did not cherish it.

Tears fell from her eyes.

However, she did not regret coming back.

She turned around and said to the bearded man, “Your mission is to sleep with me.”

The bearded man was a little surprised.

According to common sense, the woman should have run away, but now she was back! What a touching love story.

“I’ll let you complete your mission, but don’t kill him,” Monica said word by word.

......

“Don’t worry. We have our own rules. If it weren’t for him protecting you so desperately, I wouldn’t have been so heavy-handed on him!” The bearded man agreed immediately.

Monica nodded. “Okay.”

As she said that, she began to undress.

Although the bearded man tore open her clothes, they were still on her. They were just hanging on her body in a mess.

The moment she took off her clothes, someone suddenly grabbed her hand.

Her eyes moved slightly, and her heart hurt so much.

Why did she still care about all of that at that moment?

Monica’s vision was blurry.

Even though Finn could not say anything, he was still there to stop her.

However, with a push, she pushed his hand away and said, “Finn, I didn’t keep my innocence for you anyway. You don’t have to feel sorry for me.”

Tears of blood flowed out of Finn’s eyes and slid down his face.

He had lost his glasses in the car accident, so at that moment, his ferocious expression was visible without the lens in the way.

Monica took off her clothes and suddenly stood up.

Then, the bearded man grabbed her.

“Let’s go over a little,” she said bluntly.

She did not want to be by Finn’s side, not even with the limited space in the warehouse.

That was their respect for each other — the last good thing she could give him.

The bearded man let go of Monica, who walked to a spot a little further away from Finn.

At that moment, the bearded man followed by her side.

She was lying on the ground, waiting and thinking about how life was filled with unhappy encounters.

For example, back when she saw Finn cheating on her, she even wanted to commit suicide. However, she managed to get out of it in the end.

After so many years, it still hurt to think about it, but it was now all in the past.

It would also be the same for this incident.

In the quiet warehouse, there were no more screams or sounds of resistance.

Michael, who was witnessing all of it, had a twisted expression on his face as he did not expect Monica to come back for Finn.

Moreover, Monica was willing to come back and be abused to save Finn!

He clenched his fists tightly, his expression hideous.

He had always thought that Monica did not have many feelings for Finn.

Their relationship had been on and off for so many years, so they must not have feelings for each other anymore.

Otherwise, he would not have been able to interfere with their relationship, and Monica would not have agreed to his request.

However, at that moment, he was just deceiving himself.

“Mr. Ross.” The person beside him reminded him, “If you don’t stop it now...”

The person next to him was Michael’s trusted aide. He knew a lot about Michael, so he naturally knew about the relationship between Michael and Monica.

He also knew very well that Mr. Ross did not really plan to hurt Monica today and that all he wanted was to verify Finn’s identity.

Yet now, Mr. Ross was suddenly indifferent to the situation.

Michael really wanted Monica to be trampled on because he could not accept that for Finn, Monica would…

If she really wanted to do that for Finn, he shall fulfill her wish! He was already at his point of breaking from enduring it all.

However, just as he was about to speak, his eyes narrowed.

He saw Finn suddenly stand up again in the warehouse.

He thought that the man would never be able to get up again, yet here Finn was, standing up from the ground.

Finn stood up and used all his strength to kick away the bearded man, who was close to Monica.

“Finn….” Monica looked at how gruesome he looked, covered in blood.

Then, with a thud, he suddenly fell onto her to protect her body under his. He was covering her entire body.

“Damn it!” The bearded man failed to attack again.

In an instant, his rage filled the air.

He kicked Finn’s body hard.

Instead of making a sound, Finn simply pressed Monica down tightly with his body to protect her.

The bearded man used a lot of strength, but he could not break Finn apart from Monica.

His expression was extremely grim.

“Beat him to death!” he ordered.

He refused to believe that he could not beat Finn to death.

“Finn! Finn! Get up!” Monica watched as Finn was getting beaten and kicked violently.

He really could not feel any pain.

As his body was pressed against Monica’s, the blood on his body eventually stained hers. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Don’t worry. I can’t feel any pain.” Finn’s weak voice rang in Monica’s ears.

What did he mean by that?

All she knew was that her heart was aching in pain.

“I won’t let you be abused...”

At that moment, Monica wished Finn could make her hate him even more instead.
