1137 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

Jeanne pursed her lips and slowly said, “Yes.”

“Chester, come with me.”

“Yes.”

As Warren left with Chester, Jeanne looked up at their backs before going straight to her room.

Everything she had done today was just to gain Warren’s trust.

Of course, she did not show any mercy to Edward. However, the most important thing was to dispel Warren’s suspicions of her.

…

Warren brought Chester back to his study.

“As expected, your prediction is right. Jeanne and Edward really don’t have any feelings for each other anymore. If we hadn’t stopped her, Jeanne would have killed Edward.” Chester could not help but admire his father’s foresight.

Warren sneered. He was also proud of his previous guess. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He said, “I originally wanted Jeanne to kill Edward just like that. At most, I would use Jeanne as an excuse. It would be a life for a life anyway, and no one will say anything about our Sanders.”

“Why didn’t you do that?” Chester was surprised.

It did not cross his mind that he could use Jeanne to kill Edward first. Once Edward was killed, they could dampen the Duncans’ spirit.

“Jeanne is still useful.” Warren said bluntly, “Think about it. We couldn’t do anything to the Swans for such a long time, but Jeanne managed to restrain them so quickly. In the current situation, it doesn’t matter whether Edward is dead or not. He’s being held captive by us, so he can’t do anything anyway. On the other hand, Jeanne can be by our side and play a greater role. Killing Jeanne now will be a disadvantage to us.”

“You’re right, father. It’s not worth it to exchange a useless Edward for Jeanne.”

“Once I take down the Duncans, I’ll let Jeanne kill Edward and then convict Jeanne. That would be the perfect plan.”

“What a well-thought-out plan, father! I’m impressed,” Chester quickly complimented his father.

Warren smiled sinisterly.

‘Jeanne, don’t blame me for being too cruel.’

In the face of great benefits, anything could be sacrificed. Furthermore, that sacrifice was worthless to him!

…

The news that the Swans had been arrested instantly spread throughout Harken. Everyone was discussing the matter, stating their opinions.

The news garnered a lot of attention, and the daily reports about the Swans were everywhere.

Finn also saw the news. In fact, it had been a week since he saw the news.

However, a week had passed, and there was no progress on the case. However, the Sanders’ officials would respond to the matter every day. It gave the people a feeling that the Sanders would conduct a fair trial on this matter, that they would not tolerate evil, and that they would not wrong any good person.

Every day, the progress of the case would be announced to the public so that everyone could see the Sanders’ sincerity on that matter. After all, the trial was held against the famous Swans, so they would not neglect it.

That way, nothing bad would be said about the Sanders.

Finn had read the latest news today.

At first, Edward had told him to announce the Sanders’ scandal, but now, it was the Swans’ who were in trouble.

Moreover, he lost all contact with Edward after the incident and could not get any orders from Edward.

He had already gone to look for Old Master Swan.

However, Old Master Swan was also being monitored, and there were many things he could not say to him. Hence, he did not receive any orders.

The thing in his hand had been pressing down on his hand.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door from outside his office.

Finn put down his phone and tried to calm himself down. “Come in.”

The door was pushed open.

It was Sarah.

Today was Sunday, so Sarah was on holiday.

When she was on holiday, or to be more precise, when she was free, Sarah would be with her aunt in the hospital.

Recently, she had not been bothering him much. As such, he was a little surprised that she had taken the initiative to look for him today.

Although he was surprised, he was also cold.

Sarah noticed it too.

She had long discovered that Finn was a block of ice that could not be warmed no matter what. To think that she had once been so confident that she could also do what her cousin could do.

Only now did she realize that she could not do it at all.

Finn was not a bad person, but his indifference could really hurt any woman who loved him and make them run away.

She sat opposite Finn.
