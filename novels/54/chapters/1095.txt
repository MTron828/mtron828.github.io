1096 Lucy’s Resistance

“Have you ever thought that you would die?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

“Anyone can die.” Kingsley said bluntly, “I never thought that I would live like this until I die.”

“So, do you have any regrets?” Jeanne asked him.

He was born into an assassin family, so his life and death had always been up to the heavens, not fate.

No one knew when they would really die. Even Kingsley could not guarantee it.

“No, I don’t,” Kingsley replied firmly. “I don’t have any regrets.”

There was no need for any regrets. He shouldered his own responsibility and led the development of the Hills. He had nothing to regret.

Of course, if he died, the Hills would also face extinction. However, that was not his regret. That was just the survival of the fittest.

That was how the world evolved.

The Hills did not rise up out of thin air. They, too, killed a lot of people to get to where they were today.

If someone did the same to them one day, it would all be... normal.

Kingsley understood the life he had to live very well, and the only thing that had changed in his life was his sister leaving Jeanne behind.

He was originally emotionless and was even too numb to the world, but he developed a trace of emotion.

The blood ties between family members were difficult to abandon.

“Lucy will become your regret.” In response to Kingsley’s answer, Jeanne retorted.

Kingsley looked at Jeanne.

“Never,” Kingsley said firmly.

After saying that, he strode away.

Jeanne looked at Kingsley’s back.

Kingsley probably had never realized that he would get angry every time Lucy was mentioned.

Jeanne retracted her gaze and looked at her phone.

Apart from Monica calling her a few times and sending her a few messages asking where she was, she did not receive any messages from anyone else.

Jeanne wondered that after she went back on her words and hurt him that day, would they still be husband and wife the next time they met?

…

Kingsley returned to his room and stood on the large balcony, smoking.

Naturally, his high-level assassins were by his side. However, they did not even dare to breathe loudly during this period of time, for fear of provoking Kingsley.

They were afraid that if Kingsley suddenly raged, they would be implicated.

Kingsley smoked one cigarette after another.

Finally, Kingsley ordered, “Arrange for a woman to come in.”

The high-level assassins were stunned and a little dumbfounded. Getting a woman for Kingsley had never been within the scope of their duties.

It had been Lucy before, and later, it was Millie.

Ever since Millie’s death, Mr. Thorn had been abstinent for a long time, and that abstinence frightened them.

Now that he had finally returned to normal, that instruction was too difficult for them to carry out.

“Why? Don’t you know how to do it?” Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

Since when did they know how to do that? However, they could only bite the bullet and say, “Yes.”

Then, one of the high-level assassins left.

He left and went to find Lucy.

It could not be helped. They did not know Mr. Thorn’s preference for women and which assassin was qualified to sleep with Kingsley. He was afraid that if he made a wrong arrangement and caused an internal conflict, he would not be able to bear the responsibility.

Being by Kingsley’s side was like being with a tiger. He might not even know how he died.

When the high-level assassin found Lucy, she was planning to leave the manor with Kerby. It seemed like they were going to the town on the Delta Islands to have some fun.

“Ms. Harmon,” The high-level assassin was very respectful.

Lucy looked at the high-level assassin who had never left Kingsley’s side and wondered, “Kingsley is looking for me?”

“No.” The assassin quickly shook his head.

“In that case, why are you looking for me?” No matter what, she found it a little strange.

After all, Kingsley’s closest assassins usually paid no attention to the outside world and only focused on protecting Kingsley.

“Mr. Thorn told me to find him a woman, and I really don’t know who to look for.” The assassin was in a difficult position.

Only then did Lucy understand the situation.

She had heard that Kingsley had been abstinent for a period of time after Millie’s death.

Of course, she did not think that Kingsley still had any feelings for Millie. He must have been so angry with Jeanne that he lost his sexual desire. Now that Kingsley and Jeanne had reconciled, he had let go of his emotions, hence his physical needs.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m
