Chapter 628: The Identity of Jeanne’s Mother Exposed, Alexander’s Tragic Ending

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Why didn’t you help my mother back then and save her from my grandfather?”Jeanne asked rhetorically.

Jeanne shot Alexander down with her words, and he could not say a single word for a long time.

“What goes around, comes around.” Jeanne said coldly, “The law will give you a fair result.”

“No.” Alexander tugged on Jeanne anxiously. “Jeanne, you can’t just leave me like this. You Can’t just leave me like this. I’m your father. No matter what, I’m your father. We’re family. You can’t just watch your father die like this. Jeanne, you can’t do this!”

Jeanne smiled, and it was a frighteningly cold one.

She said, “Oh, so you admit you’re my father now? Seven years ago, when you were so cruel to me, why didn’t you think that I was your daughter? !”

“I was really angry seven years ago. Besides, you know you caused so much trouble back then and refused to listen to our advice. You caused the company’s stock market to fall, so it was only right for us to be angry. Furthermore, the Swans also put pressure on me in private, so I had to teach you a lesson. You have to put yourself in my shoes too. I had to consider the family’s reputation and development. That was why I had no choice but to treat you like that.”

Jeanne naturally did not believe it.

Did the so-called ‘no choice’ mean she could be left to fend for herself overseas for seven years?

Even if he reacted in a fit of anger, it would only take a day or two, or a month or two for them to ask her to come back. It would not take a whole seven years.

If he did not tell her to come home because she had some use to them, he probably would have forgotten he had a daughter.

Alexander could naturally see her expression.

He hurriedly explained, “I admit there’s another reason. It’s because of your mother’s domineering attitude back then that hurt my self-esteem as a man. Moreover, you and your mother really look too alike. That’s why I’ll think of your mother every time I see you, and it reminds me of the hurt she once gave me. That’s why I have mixed emotions toward you. Jeannie, it was indeed my fault. I shouldn’t have implicated you in the adults’ matters. I regret not treating you properly now.”

He regretted it now.

However, regardless of whether he regretted it, it was already too late.

She said coldly, “There’s no point crying over spilled milk.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Jeannie, no matter what happened to you when you were 18, at least I was good to you before you were 18 years old and long after your mother died. You didn’t have to worry about food and clothes and were living the life of a young lady. Even if I crossed the line with what I did after you were 18, you can’t erase all the good I’ve done to you!” Alexander was very agitated, and he kept playing the emotional card, hoping that Jeanne could help him.

However, Jeanne was still indifferent to him. She said, “Didn’t you treat me well after my mom died because of the Swans’ eldest young master? If it weren’t for Eden taking a fancy to me at my mother’s funeral, would you have treated me so well? If it weren’t to curry favor with the Swans, would you have treated me well?”

Now that she thought about it, she should be grateful to Eden — for that fateful encounter that made the Swans’ eldest young master fall in love with her at first sight.

Otherwise, after her mother died, Alexander would have tortured her to death.

At that time, she would not have had the power to resist.

Jeanne’s one sentence exposed Alexander’s lie, and it caught Alexander off guard. Hence, he went on to explain, “How is that possible? Your relationship with Eden had nothing to do with how I treated you–”

“Didn’t you just say you had mixed feelings toward me because my mother humiliated you back then and because I look very similar to my mother? It just so happened that my relationship with Eden was good, so you endured all those emotions, didn’t you?” Jeanne made it clear.

Alexander was rendered speechless by Jeanne’s words because… what he said to Jeanne was a lie.

Back then, if it were not for Eden suddenly getting close to Jeanne, he might have tortured Jeanne when she was young.

At that time, Jeanne’s mother humiliated him.

Not only did she not let him have sex with her, but she even had control over Lawrence Enterprise, so no one in the company take him seriously. Some even called him a man who lived off his wife behind his back. As the young master of the Lawrences, how could he endure that humiliation? On top of that, Jenifer took the initiative to express her goodwill toward him, giving him the dignity he had never been able to get from Jeanne’s mother. That made his hatred toward Jeanne’s mother grow deeper, and in the end, he had the urge to kill Jeanne’s mother.
