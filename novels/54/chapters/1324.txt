1325 Asking for Hand in Marriage

Dream on!

Chloe would never let Candice succeed. Never!

She felt an indescribable sense of unfamiliarity toward Candice. It was as if she was completely different from the woman she had met in the past.

It was hard to tell when Candice first came back. Candice was obviously unfamiliar with this family. She probably could not remember the past, so she was cold to everyone in this family. She seemed neither good nor bad, so Chloe had no idea what kind of personality she had. Of course, Chloe was not in the mood to get to know her. However, when she saw that Edward and Candice’s wedding date was getting closer and closer, she could not hold it in anymore.

She could not help but want to deliberately make Candice suffer, but she was surprised that this woman did not seem to care about her at all.

She remembered that when she was young, Candice would deliberately curry favor with her every time she came back. Now, she was clearly… ignoring her completely.

Chloe’s eyes turned cold.

Is she insufferably arrogant because she was about to become the Chief’s wife?!

Chloe would definitely teach Candice a lesson!

…

Candice lay on the bed after taking a shower.

It was clearly very late, but she could not fall asleep no matter what.

She stared at the ceiling in a daze.

It was not because Chloe’s words made her feel uncomfortable and could not relax—she really did not take Chloe seriously, nor was she a threat. Rather, it was because of her relationship with Edward.

There was a feeling she could not pinpoint. She still seemed to be able to feel the heartbeat she felt earlier. It was completely different from how she felt when she treated others.

Was she really… in love just like that?!

Candice took a deep breath. She was letting himself relax silently.

To be honest, from the moment she opened her eyes a year ago, she had the illusion that she had been reborn.

Since it was a rebirth, she naturally had to start over.

There was no particular thing to reject, so she decided to let nature take its course.

The last thing she expected was how easy and smooth it felt when nature was taking its course.

She finally understood why Edward was so reluctant to part with her tonight.

In the month before their wedding, Edward and Candice really did not have time to meet properly. Even the wedding preparations were completed by Edward’s assistant. He was so busy that he did not even take wedding photos. Candice wondered if she could just photoshop themselves at the venue.

Then again, she had no idea if there would be any photos at the scene.

According to the traditional ceremonies of Harken, these sessions might not even exist.

One more week till the wedding and the house had been decorated for the day.

The entire residence of the Nicholsons had been refurbished as this was a very important day.

One afternoon while Candice was watching television in the living room, she received a call from Edward.

She had almost forgotten this person’s existence. The trace of feelings she had for him had faded because they had not seen each other for a month.

She was still a little surprised that he suddenly showered her with affection. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She took a deep breath and answered the call. “Hello.”

“It’s me, Ed.” The other end of the line used the short form, “Ed”.

“Mm, Ed.” Candice chimed in.

It was a very normal conversation, but it suddenly made her feel inexplicably shy, even though she could not mask it.

The person on the other end seemed to be in a much better mood when he heard her call his name.

He said, “I’ll come to your house for dinner tonight.”

“What?” Candice was really surprised this time.

“Our wedding is in a week but I haven’t visited your family.”

“But I’m afraid they won’t be prepared for your sudden arrival.”

“They don’t need to. What matters is that you get ready.”

“What should I do?” Candice asked with a trembling voice.

There seemed to be a chuckle on the other end. “Get ready to see me.”

Candice was speechless.

“I’ll come to the Nicholsons’ residence at around six in the evening,” Edward said and added, “To ask for your hand in marriage.”

Her heart started beating rapidly again. It was as if she was easily bewitched by this man.

No wonder he was so popular with women.

The two of them did not talk for long. After all, Edward was very busy. She hurriedly mentioned the time and hung up.

Candice did not delay and told Claire that Edward was coming here for dinner.

When Claire heard that the Chief would be visiting for dinner, she was a little excited. She quickly arranged for the servants to prepare and did not forget to call Wyatt to come back early.
