Chapter 639: Monica Was Drunk and Walked Into the Wrong Door

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She hesitated for a long time before agreeing.

She said, “Is it still the same place?”

“The same place at 7 p.m. I’ll see you.”

After that, Monica hung up the phone. In the end, she was still a little uninterested.

‘Whatever,’ she thought.

Then, she got up and went to the dressing room to get changed and put on some makeup.

She assumed she was the only person in Harken to be dancing in the nightclub with her crutches.

Anyway, she was going.

It was really a long-lost nightclub feeling.

The group of them did not like to sit in private rooms either because the private rooms were not as lively and happening as the main hall. Hence, they chose a place where most people were seated and then drank non-stop while making explicit comments to all the men and women there.

At first, Monica thought she was not interested. However, she did not know if it was because of the loud music inside, but when the alcohol got to her, she suddenly felt high, like she had taken stimulants. She even went to the dance floor with her crutches and shook her head, dancing.

She had quite a lot of fun that night.

When she left, it was 2 a.m.

The one who was the most unwilling to come became the one who was the most reluctant to leave.

As expected, the nightclub was where she belonged.

She wondered if she was in a bad mood recently because she did not have an environment like that to go crazy.

She dragged her girlfriends, who could not get on their feet anymore. “You’re not allowed to leave. I haven’t had enough fun yet!”

“Girl, it’s 2 a.m. in the morning. Do you still want us to live? I still have to go to work tomorrow. Damn it!” The woman began to curse.

She could curse at anyone when she was drunk.

“Let’s go. We really can’t take it anymore!” The others staggered away one after another.

Everyone drank quite a lot and had all forgotten that Monica was still crippled.

She was limping and drunk, so she could not walk properly.

In a daze, Monica watched as all her friends left.

Since not many people were left in the nightclub, Monica felt bored and was about to leave with crutches.

However, as soon as she got up, she sat back down.

Damn. She felt dizzy and could not even walk on her own.

As such, she took out her phone. Her mind was still clear enough for her to know she had to find someone to pick her up.

She then made a call, but it did not connect even after a long time.

That damned Finn was not picking up her call again. It made her so angry that she wanted to throw her phone away.

Nevertheless, she said to the waiter beside her, “Come here.”

The waiter quickly went over. “Miss, do you need any help?”

“Send me back.”

“Miss, please wait a moment,” the waiter replied.

It was a higher-end nightclub, so there were all kinds of services to send guests away.

The staff helped Monica into one of the nightclub’s cars, and Monica gave the address to the driver.

Then, in a daze, she arrived at her destination, where she casually handed a handful of money to the driver from her bag. “Keep the change.”

Frightened by the amount, the driver hurriedly asked, “Miss, do you need me to send you upstairs?”

Monica wanted to refuse.

However, she could not even walk properly or see clearly, so she did not refuse. “Alright, sure.”

The driver hurriedly got out of the car and helped Monica into the residential area before going up to the elevator.

“Miss, do you have the key to the house?” the driver asked.

“No, no. That *sshole Finn has deleted the fingerprint and changed the password.” Monica leaned against the wall and said angrily with her eyes half-closed.

Feeling helpless, the driver had to ring the doorbell.

After a while, a man in pajamas and with smart black-framed glasses appeared at the door. When he looked at the driver, he was a little surprised. “What do you…”

‘Want?’ He wanted to say.

However, before he could finish his sentence, he saw the drunk Monica standing at the side in a daze.

Finn’s expression darkened.

The driver quickly explained, “This young lady is drunk, and I sent her back. Since she’s back, I’ll head off now.”

He could see that the man in front of him did not look to be in a good mood. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

In fact, in their line of work, they often sent guests back. They had even seen couples fighting in front of their house.

To avoid awkwardness, they would usually leave right after sending the guest to their doorstep.

At that moment, the driver had already pressed the button for the elevator and left.

Finn simply glanced at the drunk Monica before deciding to close the door.

That was when Monica suddenly pounced on him.

The moment Finn closed the door, she pounced on Finn.
