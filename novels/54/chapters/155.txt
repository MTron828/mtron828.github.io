Chapter 156: Jeanne Could Only Be His Wife

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What else do you plan to do?”Micheal asked.

“Jeanne brought Klaus to South Hampton City, but whether or not he can plan the transportation routes, it’s up to the Sanders.”

“Don’t be rash.” Micheal hurriedly reminded, “The reason why Jeanne invited Klaus to the South Hampton city was to give the Sanders no reason to reject. Think about it. If you reject her without any reason, Jeanne will definitely make it as though you are targeting the Lawrences. At that time, not only you but your father will also be forced into a corner.”

Melody suppressed her anger.

It was difficult for her to endure it.

Micheal advised, “Melody, there’s still a long way to go. In the end, no matter who Jeanne is, as long as she’s in Harken, you will be able to deal with her.”

Even though that was the case, Melody’s eyes were still red from holding it in.

“Calm down. This is just a drill. Next time, we will definitely see blood!” Micheal said cruelly.

At this moment, he was very clear that now was not the time to be emotional.

Before they understood Jeanne’s background clearly, if they acted rashly, the ones who would be injured in the end would be themselves.

“Melody,” Micheal called out to her.

I heard that Jeanne is at Edward’s place now!” Melody finally broke down at this moment.

She had done so much.

In the end, Jeanne still went to Edward’s embrace. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

How could she bear it?

“I personally feel that Fourth Master Swan does not really like Jeanne. Think about it, if Fourth Master Swan really likes her, would he let the person she likes take the hit for him?”

Melody was stunned.

Micheal said, “Fourth Master Swan is so smart, so it’s impossible that he didn’t expect you to target Jeanne. Since he did it on purpose, doesn’t that mean that he doesn’t love Jeanne at all?”

Melody was convinced.

“So, after thinking it through, he won’t really take Jeanne seriously anymore. Now that we’ve gotten rid of Jeanne, it’s just to let Fourth Master Swan have no more excuses to reject you.” Micheal kept on comforting her, “You mustn’t get into a dead end.”

“Okay.” Melody nodded.

She had to admit that she was convinced by Micheal.

Actually, she was still very glad that Micheal had returned to the country. They grew up together. The reason why she was able to get her father’s favor was actually all thanks to Micheal. He had been giving her advice and planning together. She really relied on Micheal, and would basically believe whatever he said.

“Then don’t think too much. After I investigate Jeanne’s background, we will have a long-term plan.”

“Okay.”

Melody hung up the phone.

She was still feeling suffocated.

Ever since she was young, she had never been forced to this extent by a single person. She was forced to the point where she wanted to kill that person regardless of everything.

She picked up her phone and flipped through the news.

The image of Edward hugging Jeanne spread through the news.

Once the news was out, everyone was speculating whether Edward Swan was really dating Jeanne. There were actually so many people who wished her well.

No!

She gritted her teeth.

She wanted to see what kind of relationship Edward and Jeanne had.

She made a call. “Eden.”

“Ms. Sanders.” Eden held the phone in his hand. In fact, he was prepared to be scolded by Melody.

“Come and pick me up now. I want to go to your house!”

“What?” Eden was surprised.

“Hurry up!”

After saying that, Melody directly hung up the phone.

Her face was extremely cold.

She definitely wanted to marry Edward. It was not just her political stance. More importantly, she was the princess of Sanders. She could not accept failure in any matter.

…

Bamboo Garden.

In the hall, on the sofa.

Edward received a phone call from Nox.

Nox’s smug voice said, “Are you satisfied with the news? Teddy is quite smart. He even took a few photos of you two. This way, the whole world will know that you and Ms. Lawrence are dating.”

“Yes,” Edward replied.

“Speaking of it, I’m actually a little surprised by you.”

Edward did not reply.

“These few days, Jeanne has been targeted by the Sanders. Now that you’ve exposed that you and Jeanne are really together, you want Melody to really kill her, don’t you?”

“She can’t be killed.” Edward enunciated each word with a hint of cold-bloodedness.

“I know that Jeanne is no longer the same as before. But to be honest, are you really not going to find out what Jeanne has been through all these years abroad? The abilities that she displayed in the business world could be said to have been nurtured. After all, Jeanne seemed to have been smart since she was young. Once she put in some effort and wanted to learn something, it was not surprising that she would be able to make a name for herself in the business world. But she knows martial arts, she knows how to race cars, she is calm in the face of trouble, and she knows so many people that I think are quite the big shots. Don’t you think that there is someone behind Jeanne?” Nox was unusually serious, “There is even someone who is training her.”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly, and he said, “There is no rush now.”

“No Rush? Or are you afraid that the result will not be good?” Nox hit the nail on the head.

“It doesn’t matter. No matter who Jeanne is, she will only have one identity in the end.”

“Huh?” Nox did not react in time.

“My wife.”

Nox was stunned.

Edward was actually serious.

“Let’s not talk about it.” Edward did not think about explaining anything to Nox. He hung up the phone.

“Edward!” Nox called out to him, “Since you like Jeanne so much, then your actions today are even more inappropriate! You exposed yourself and Jeanne to the public! Those who know a little about it would think that you are deliberately using Jeanne to reject the Sanders. I am guessing that when Jeanne saw this news, she would also think the same.”

“I know very well what I am doing.” Edward obviously did not want to waste his breath on Nox.

“I am worried for you.” Nox was irascible.

Why was this guy so stubborn?

If he pursued his wife like this, he would not be able to get her.

“If you have the time, you should worry more about yourself.”

“I am pretty good. My woman is easy to get. I am not like you or Finn, who are hanging on the same tree.” Nox had a smug look on his face.

“That’s why I’m worried. Try not to get any STI.”

“F**K.” Nox cursed.

Edward already hung up the phone.

His eyes moved slightly and he glanced up to the second floor.

Jeanne’s clothes had already been delivered, but he did not bring them to her.

Jeanne also did not rush him.

Jeanne... just how much longer would he have to endure?

“Fourth Master.” Teddy suddenly stepped forward.

Edward turned around.

“Eldest Young Master has brought Melody Sanders to Bamboo Garden,” Teddy reported.

Edward sneered.

He suddenly stood up from the sofa and casually picked up the clothes that he had prepared for Jeanne. “Bring them to my room in a while.”

“...” what was the Fourth Master planning now?

Fourth Master Swan left behind these words and went up to the second floor.

The room door was pushed open.

Jeanne was sleeping in a corner of his bed.

It looked like she was sleeping.

He placed the clothes on the sofa at the side and walked over directly.

Jeanne felt someone approaching and opened her eyes.

When she opened her eyes, she saw Fourth Master Swan pressing down on her body.

Jeanne’s body tensed up.

In the next second, Fourth Master Swan lowered his head and kissed her lips.

Jeanne held onto the bedsheet tightly.

Fourth Master Swan’s kiss was too sudden and even too intense.

She did not expect it.

She only felt that he was very aggressive at this moment.

Suddenly... very dangerous.

She let go of the bedsheet and placed her hands on Fourth Master Swan’s chest, trying to pull away from the sudden intimacy between the two of them.

At that moment, Fourth Master Swan took her hands away and forced her to wrap her arms around his neck.

In this way, Fourth Master Swan’s entire body was entirely stuck to her body.

Jeanne suppressed her emotions.

Wasn’t he a gentleman when he applied the medicine on her?

Now... he became a beast?
