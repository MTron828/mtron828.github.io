Chapter 286: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

After all, Kingsley basically responded to Jeanne’s every request!

The car suddenly fell into silence again.

It was silent.

The car did not stop and drove to the airport.

At the same time, in the Swans’ manor.

In Bamboo Garden’s hall.

George and Miles were brought here by Nox.

Nox was baffled.

He had not even recovered from his injuries when he received a call from Fourth Master Swan. He was asked to stay at the Lawrences’ manor and keep an eye on George’s movements.

Nox was truly dumbfounded. He felt that Fourth Master Swan was crazy.

What was the point of keeping an eye on a child?!

Nox had been instructed to watch George leave school from noon yesterday until 9:00 am today. Then, this morning, he found out that George did not go to school but went in the direction of the airport.

Naturally, he had to report it to Fourth Master Swan.

Then, Fourth Master Swan ordered him to bring George back.

Nox was the great young master of the Winters. He felt bad for treating a kid like that.

Fortunately, there was someone in the car who knew some martial arts. Although it took Nox some time to take down the other party, if word got out, at least he would not be said to have bullied a kid.

As such, Nox brought George back.

At this moment, when he heard the conversation between Fourth Master Swan and Jeanne, he roughly understood what was going on.

‘Has someone been dumped?! Is he trying to use her son to make her stay?!

‘Tsk, tsk, tsk.

‘Fourth Master Swan is too crazy when it comes to dating.’

Despite that, seeing that Fourth Master Swan was in a good mood, Nox did not want to get himself killed.

He sat on the sofa obediently.

He sized up George as he had nothing to do.

‘This stupid kid is quite patient.

‘He didn’t even make a sound from the beginning to the end.

‘Does he know that he’s being kidnapped now?

‘A hostage can be killed during a kidnap.

‘He could be killed.’

It was not baseless thinking. Given Fourth Master Swan’s state, if Jeanne did not come, he might really kill the innocent.

Nox imagined a lot.

His phone rang at this moment.

He looked at the incoming call and picked it up. “How is it? Have you gotten a location?”

“Yes.” The other party was respectful. “According to a call just now, we found that the phone’s base station is located on a highway heading to the base station. We’ve just sent someone to drive there. We’ll report accordingly.”

“Don’t lose them,” Nox instructed.

“Understood.”

After hanging up, Nox said, “Ms. Lawrence is now on the highway to the airport.”

Edward was expressionless.

“Maybe she’ll turn around and come back later,” Nox speculated.

No matter what, since Jeanne’s son was here, it was impossible for her to leave just like that.

No parent would be so ambitious.

Edward did not react to Nox’s speculation.

Nox also felt very bored.

He could not sit still.

He got up and walked toward George.

George looked up at him.

Nox asked, “Are you scared?”

George did not answer.

“Do you think your mom will come back to save you?”

George still did not answer.

“Have you been scared silly?” Nox looked at George. At this moment, he felt a little sorry.

“My mom said that only people with low IQ would talk so much,” George suddenly said.

“...”

‘F*ck!

‘Who is he cursing at?!

‘Who the f*ck is this brat cursing at?!’

George turned around and ignored Nox completely.

He walked straight toward Fourth Master Swan.

Since he was not restricted in any way, he could move freely.

Of course, Miles was not treated as well.

Miles was seriously restrained and could not move.

At this moment, when Miles saw George walking toward Fourth Master Swan, he was a little emotional. “George!”

George took a look at Miles, but he still walked toward Fourth Master Swan.

He stood in front of Fourth Master Swan.

As he was very short, he was only as tall as if Fourth Master Swan were to sit.

George asked, “Why did you bring me here?”

Edward’s eyes moved slightly. He looked at George in front of him. “I thought you knew very well.”

“Is it because of my mom?”

“Yes.”

“My mom doesn’t like you,” George told Edward clearly.

Edward looked at him.

Nox, who was at the side, also looked at the two of them with interest.

“Who does your mom like?”

“My mom likes Kingsley.” George was straightforward.

Nox, who was at the side, was about to vomit blood.

‘He’s really not afraid of being strangled to death by Fourth Master Swan.’

“My mom said that the most important man in this world to her is Kingsley,” George told Fourth Master Swan very seriously.

“Is that so?” Edward’s face was dark.

At this moment, Nox felt that... he was quite scary.

Even so, George was indifferent.

Nox felt that he was really stupid.

George was too smart but also too stupid.

“Fourth Master, it’s useless even if you kidnap me,” George told Edward very seriously. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘So you know that you’re being kidnapped?!’

Nox stared at George with his eyes wide open.

“My mom can just leave me,” George said. “She can still have a lot of children. One more or less won’t make a difference.”

Nox almost laughed to his death.

‘Does he understand everything so clearly?!

‘If Fourth Master Swan understands everything as well as that kid, he wouldn’t have made himself so miserable.’

At this moment, Nox’s phone rang again.

Nox hurriedly picked it up. “Did you catch up with Jeanne?”

“I did. I found that the car Jeanne was in had stopped at the airport. She followed two people into the airport. It looks like she’s about to leave.”

“...” Nox was speechless.

‘Ms. Lawrence is really... special!

‘She just left her son like that?!’

Nox turned to look at Fourth Master Swan. “Ms. Lawrence has entered the airport. It seems that she has no intention of coming back.”

Edward’s expression was extremely ugly.

On the other hand, George said calmly, “So, I was right.”

He was left behind by his mom.

Fourth Master Swan was also left behind!
