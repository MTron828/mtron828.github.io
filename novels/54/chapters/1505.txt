The moment Chloe said that, Wyatt and Claire looked at Candice. They probably thought that Chloe’s suggestion was a good one too.

Candice pursed her lips and said, “As Dad said earlier, if Edward wanted to consider our relationship as a family, he wouldn’t have chosen this method. Instead, he would have settled it privately. Since he chose this method, it must mean that he never thought of letting it go.”

“You haven’t even tried. How would you know it won’t work? Sis, are you afraid that it will affect your position as the Leader’s wife? Are you afraid that you will anger Edward if you plead for me? If you are, just say it. Don’t let me have any expectations of you…”

“Yes,” Candice admitted.

Chloe looked at Candice in disbelief. She did not expect Candice to answer so rpndilv

“Firstly, Edward is the Leader of this country, and like any great Leader, he is unpredictable. If I’m not careful, I might provoke him. Secondly, even if Edward was not the Leader of this country and we’re ordinary people, you seduced my husband. Why do I have to plead for you instead?” Candice was a little sarcastic. “Do you think it’ll work?”

“Like I said, I only did what I did because I was drunk. I wasn’t seducing him at all. I was trying to mediate the conflict between you and Edward. I was doing that for you-”

“Chloe, I should remind you that since Edward sent you here, there must be sufficient evidence to prove that you’ve committed a crime. Yet, you keep saying you were drunk. Aren’t you afraid of being humiliated?”

“I…” Chloe bit her lips and refused to admit it. “Candice, you speak with such dignity, but you’re just afraid that I’ll affect your status and position. I never thought you’d be someone who wouldn’t care about your sister for the sake of your own interests!”

“If you really want to put it that way, I’ll answer you plainly. Yes, I’m such a person, so I won’t interfere in your case with Edward”

“Candice, how could you do this to your sister!” Claire could not stand it anymore. “You two are sisters, after all. Blood is thicker than water. How could you treat her like this-I‘ nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Enough!” Wyatt roared.

Claire and Chloe were stunned by Wyatt’s temper.

“Chloe, apologize to your sister!” Wyatt said.

Chloe thought she had heard wrongly. She looked at her father in disbelief and said, “Dad, it’s her fault. Why do you want me to apologize? I’m in this place because of her. Why do you want me to apologize? Ever since we were young, you’ve been biased toward her. You’ve even ignored my feelings because of her. Now, no matter the situation, you’re still on her side. Am I really your biological daughter?”

Chloe broke down and started crying.

At that moment, Claire could not care less anymore. She shouted at Wyatt,

“Chloe didn’t do anything wrong. What right do you have to make Chloe apologize? What right do you have to defend Candice?”

“Whose fault is it? Do you think I don’t know Chloe has been spoiled by you since she was young? If not for Chloe back then…” The veins on Wyatt’s face popped. “I don’t want to talk about the past anymore. If Chloe has a death wish, so be it. I don’t care anymore!”

Wyatt was about to leave when Claire threatened him. “Wyatt, if you leave today, I will die in front of you!”

“Sure! Die right now!” Wyatt was also furious.

“Y-Y-You!” Claire could not complete her sentence for a long time.. Then, she scolded Wyatt, “You’d rather lose your daughter for the sake of power, huh?

You and Candice are the same — both selfish! One day, God will punish you for
