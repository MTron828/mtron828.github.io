Chapter 225: Compared to Jeanne, All of You Are No Different From Trash!

In the Lawrences’ hall.

Alexander was so angry that his face turned cold.

The more he thought about it, the more he could not bear it anymore. At this moment, he sat on the sofa and suddenly kicked the coffee table in front of him. The coffee table fell to the ground in an instant.

Everyone in the house, including the servants, was so scared that they did not dare to breathe.

At this moment, Joshua rushed in from outside. When he saw his father throwing a tantrum, he was also scared.

Alexander looked up and saw Joshua. His face darkened. “Where did you go?!”

His voice was scary.

Joshua did not know what happened. He looked at Jenifer.

Jenifer signaled him not to provoke Alexander.

“Speak! Can’t you speak?!” Alexander vented his anger on Joshua.

At this moment, he was mad at Joshua.

If Joshua was capable, he would not have let Jeanne turn the house upside down!

Joshua quickly said, “After going to see Jeanne’s lawsuit today, I left with Jasmine and Eden. I stayed with them for a while. I just received a call from Grandpa, and he told me to come back immediately.”

Alexander’s eyes narrowed. “Your grandpa told you to come back?!”

“Yes. He just called me and told me to come back right away.”

“What happened?”

“I don’t know either. He just told me to come back. He also said that he wanted you to go to his study with me.”

Alexander had a bad premonition.

Jenifer also felt that something had happened at that moment.

“Are we going to Grandpa’s room now?” Joshua did not know what had happened and asked nervously. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Alexander thought for a moment and took the lead to go upstairs.

Joshua quickly followed.

Jenifer also followed.

The three of them walked into Jonathan’s study.

At this moment, Jeanne was standing beside Jonathan.

“Grandpa, why did you—”

“Kneel!” Jonathan suddenly said, extremely frightening.

Joshua was stunned.

He looked straight at Jonathan, not knowing what had happened.

He was also wondering if he had heard wrongly.

Ever since he was young, as he was the only son in the family, he was always favored a little.

“I told you to kneel!” Jonathan was so angry that he slapped his hand on the desk. With a pow, even the teacup shook.

Joshua was terrified.

He suddenly knelt on the ground.

He knelt down instinctively.

Alexander and Jenifer did not know what had happened.

That said, looking at the current situation, Joshua must have provoked Jonathan.

Jenifer quickly hit Joshua hard a few times. “You d*mn kid, what did you do to provoke your grandfather again? I’ll beat you to death, I’ll beat you to death!”

“Mom, Mom...” Joshua was in a lot of pain from the beating. He was also baffled. “I don’t know what I did. I didn’t do anything. I really didn’t do anything...”

The room was noisy.

“Enough!” Jonathan shouted.

Jenifer stopped hitting Joshua. At that moment, her eyes were red as if she had done something wrong. “Dad, I didn’t educate Joshua well.”

“Indeed!” Jonathan said coldly. He did not give Jenifer any face at all. “I’m very disappointed in your family now!”

“I’m sorry, Dad. I’m sorry.” Jenifer quickly apologized and said to Joshua, “Hurry up and apologize.”

“What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong…?” Joshua was still a little unconvinced. Although he was kneeling on the ground, he was still a little confused.

“You still have the nerve to ask me!” Jonathan was furious.

Joshua still did not know what was going on.

Jonathan suddenly threw a few photos in front of Joshua.

Joshua was stunned.

Alexander and Jenifer also looked at the ground and saw the photos of Joshua sleeping naked with a woman.

Joshua saw them.

His expression changed immediately.

‘Who took these photos?!

‘Was It Jeanne?!’

Joshua looked at Jeanne fiercely and saw that she was just watching the show from the side.

When their eyes met, she even deliberately smiled.

She smiled so proudly.

In fact, those photos were obviously not taken by Jeanne. She had not been back for long, so how could she have so much time to do these things? It was Adrian’s wife, Casey, who did it. She followed her husband, so of course, she would also follow her husband’s lover. When the time came for the divorce, she could bring the mistress down as well!
