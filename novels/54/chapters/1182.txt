1183 Nox, You’re Meant To Achieve Greater Things

The bomb on Warren sent them flying.

The moment they were sent flying, the figure was still protecting her, preventing her from suffering much physical damage. However, the impact of the bomb made her dizzy, and her vision went black. She tried hard to wake herself up.

She crawled out of the man’s body in a panic and looked at the bloody Nox in front of her.

That was when she saw that his back, which had blocked the bomb for her, looked unsightly.

Jeanne’s eyes reddened.

At that moment, she could not even speak. She just watched as Nox lay on the ground, motionless.

Did he not say that… he wanted her to die? Why did he rush over to protect her? He clearly wanted to kill her just now, so why did he do this?

What she said just now was not to make Nox risk his life to protect her. It was really her last words.

She did not want Nox or Edward’s friends to hate her too much.

‘I didn’t tell you to protect me with your life.’

Tears streamed down Jeanne’s face.

“I’m not dead yet.” Nox endured the pain and said.

He could not even open his eyes, but he forced himself to speak.

Jeanne was stunned, and she wiped away her tears fiercely as she looked at Nox without blinking.

“I didn’t do it for you,” Nox said.

Clearly, it was difficult for him to speak, but at that moment, he still wanted to save his dignity.

“Edward told me to protect you.”

Edward…

Did Edward tell Nox to show mercy when he knew that Nox would oppose her?

“If...” Nox tried to endure the pain. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jeanne really wanted to tell him to stop and not say another word.

“If you weren’t pregnant with Edward’s child, and if Finn didn’t tell me that you had tipped him off...” Nox’s voice became weaker and weaker.

That was right.

The moment she found out that Warren was going to deal with Finn, she sent a message to Finn, telling him to be careful!

She just did not want the innocent to be hurt.

She believed that Monica would not want Finn to die, or perhaps she just did not want to burn her bridges with Edward.

Her tears were still streaming down her face.

Did she not just say that the child was gone? Why did he still sacrifice himself?

“Tell Edward,” Nox said while trying his best to open his eyes.

When he opened his eyes, his eyes were instantly dyed red by the blood on his face.

“My name...” Nox looked at Jeanne.

They could not see each other clearly. Nox’s eyes were filled with blood, while Jeanne’s eyes were filled with tears.

“My name is Nox, and I’m meant to achieve greater things–”

Before he could finish his sentence, Nox could not hold on any longer and closed his heavy eyes.

A scene from the past suddenly appeared in his mind. It was the scene of Edward, Finn, and him training together for the first time and they introduced themselves to each other.

Edward said, “I’m Edward, like Edward the Great.”

Not to be outdone, Finn said, “My name is Finn, like Finn the Giant.”

Nox said, “...My name is Nox!”

“Why doesn’t anybody else famous have my name?” Nox asked his grandfather unhappily when he returned home after training.

He was younger than Edward and Finn, but he was never willing to admit that he was weaker than them.

However, the first time they met, he felt like he had been crushed. He was very unhappy about it

“So what if no one famous has your name?” Wade’s face darkened, and he said very seriously, “Nox, you’re meant to achieve greater things! Do you understand?”

Nox did not understand back then, but later on, he understood.

He would achieve greater things by helping Edward, and he had done it now by dying for him!

Now, he could finally rest in peace!

“No...” Jeanne looked at Nox in a panic, her face pale.

What did he mean by ‘he was meant to achieve greater things’? How was she supposed to explain that to Edward?

If he died, how was she going to answer to Edward?

“Nox, wake up,” Jeanne called out to him again and again.

She kept trying to wake him up.

“Don’t fall asleep, okay? I’m begging you to stay alive, okay?” Jeanne’s tears continued to fall.

Due to Warren’s death, Warren and Nox’s men started fighting around them.
