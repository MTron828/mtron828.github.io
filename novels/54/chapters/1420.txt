Shelly picked up her jacket and put it on slowly. In just a second, the originally naked girl was fully dressed even though her clothes were a little wrinkled and two of the buttons on her jacket seemed to have fallen off.

Nox really could not remember what he had just done. He seemed to have done a lot… but nothing seemed to have happened. He just watched as Shelly put on her clothes and left.

The moment she left, Shelly only had one thought in her mind, which was to never interfere in Nox’s matters again.

It was his problem that he had been cheated on a thousand times, and he deserved it. He was lucky that the heavens did not strike him to death with a bolt of lightning.

She had just walked to the door and was about to open it when Nox suddenly asked her, “Did we do it?”

Shelly really did not want to talk to Nox or stay in the same room with him for more than a second.

Before Shelly could answer, Nox suddenly sneered, “It’s useless to ask you! Anyway, you’ll say that we’ve done it.”

Shelly took a deep breath before turning around and saying “Yes, we did. So, how do you plan to compensate me?”

“Compensation? You should be grateful that I’m not suing you for assault.” “In that case, why are you asking so many questions?” Shelly sneered.

“I-I…” For a moment, Nox was at a loss for words, and it made him furious. “I’m afraid you’ll threaten me with some photos you took! You know that I have a fiancée that I like very much now. If you use that thing to destroy my relationship with Zoe-”

“No, I didn’t,” Shelly interrupted him.

“Do you think I’ll believe you?!”

Shelly looked at Nox, speechless. “Do you think I want to cling to you?” “If you didn’t want to cling to me, why did you seduce me?”

“You’re so aggressive when you’re drunk, and you sleep with everyone you see.

How dare you have the courage to say I seduced you?”

“Shelly, I was drunk and sleeping perfectly fine here. If you didn’t come near me, do you think I would get up by myself? Let me tell you, if I’m really drunk, I can’t get up!” Nox said firmly.

Shelly fell silent. After all, she was indeed the one who went near him.

“What? Have you been exposed?” Nox mocked.

Shelly felt that talking to Nox was a waste of time, so she turned around and pulled the door open, intending to leave. Anyway, he could think whatever he wanted.

Nox, on the other hand, thought Shelly wanted to run away because she was exposed. Therefore, he rushed over and slammed the door shut.

Shelly pulled the door handle a few times, but just like how she tried to resist Nox earlier, she could not do it at all. As such, she calmed herself down knowing that Nox was a person who would be fine after he kicked up a fuss.

“Give me your phone!” Nox suddenly demanded.

Shelly clenched her fists unconsciously. No matter how mentally prepared she was for Nox, Nox could still be eviler than she imagined.

“Give me your phone!” Nox’s face darkened. “I want to see if you took any photos of me.”

Shelly gritted her teeth and held herself back. She said, “Let’s make a deal, and

I’ll show you my phone.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“You want to cling to me? There’s no way! ”

“If I didn’t take any photos of you, don’t make me lose my job here.”

Nox was stunned.

What was Shelly up to again? How many jobs did Shelly have? She was working as a waitress at the restaurant and the nightclub, as well as a tour guide. What was that woman doing?

Of course, Nox would not go soft on her. He even thought she deserved to be living such a bad life for not going to school and spending his money on plastic surgery.

“Alright.” Nox agreed.

Where Shelly worked was none of his business.

Shelly took out her phone from her pocket and handed it to Nox, who took the phone and unlocked it.

On the phone screen was a picture of a little girl, but Nox was not bothered by it as he assumed it was just a picture downloaded from the Internet. He even thought that Shelly did not have a good eye for things.

“What’s the password?” Nox asked.

Shelly reached out and unlocked the door with her fingerprint.

Nox tapped open Shelly’s phone, only to see there were not many mobile applications other than some functional applications, Whatsapp, and some applications for work.

Nox opened the photo application first.

Seeing that almost all the photos were of the girl in the screensaver, Nox could not help but frown. “Who is this little girl?”

“What does that have to do with you?” Shelly asked, “Weren’t you looking to see if I took any photos of you?!”
