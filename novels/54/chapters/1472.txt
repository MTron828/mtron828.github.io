Chapter 1473: Shelly, Whose Child Is It?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Sarah probably wanted to help her, but she rejected Sarah every time.

Sometimes, Shelly was so stubborn that she refused to accept it. It was not because she did not want to accept it, but because she knew she could not afford it so she did not want to owe Sarah anything. “Not bad, if everything goes well.”

“What do you mean?” Sarah was dumbfounded.

Shelly did not explain. She just turned the stove down the medium heat and said to Sarah, “In about five minutes, you can turn off the stove and eat it. I’ll send Bella to kindergarten.”

Sarah was also suffering from a terrible hangover, so she did not ask further.

With that, Shelly left with Bella, whose kindergarten was just across the street from the neighborhood. Actually, there was also a high-end international kindergarten in the neighborhood, but the annual tuition fee was about the same as Bella’s surgery fee.

She and Bella chatted and laughed as they walked out of the neighborhood, not noticing that a black car was parked at the entrance and the man inside was staring at them. After sending Bella to kindergarten, Shelly returned.

In front of Bella, she tried her best to look as energetic as possible when, in fact, her current body temperature should be about 39-5 degrees Celsius. Hence, she had to hurry home, take some fever medicine, and then get some sleep.

With that thought in mind, Shelly tried to walk faster as she was afraid that she would faint if she was any slower. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Just as she rushed into the entrance of the neighborhood, a man called her from behind, “Shelly.”

Shelly really did not want to talk to Nox as her body was burning and shivering at the same time. Nevertheless, she still turned around. Anyway, he would not let her off if she did not pester him.

“I thought about it. Words mean nothing. Even if you swear on your life, how many oaths have you made? I don’t trust you.”

“In that case, what do you want me to do?” Shelly tried her best to make herself look normal.

However, Nox still noticed something different about her due to her overly rosy cheeks and her uncontrollable rapid breathing. Although he noticed, Nox said nothing.

Instead, he said, “I’ve written an agreement. If you tell anyone about what happened between us the night before last, you’ll return me 50,000 dollars.” “Alright.” Shelly agreed readily.

Nox handed the document to her, and Shelly took Nox’s agreement document without even looking at it. “Where’s the pen?” Shelly asked

“I forgot to bring it.”

Shelly was speechless.

“Get in the car with me and go to the nearby convenience store to buy it,” Nox said bluntly.

Shelly really wanted to refuse. All she wanted was to go back to sleep, but she also wanted to put an end to that matter as soon as possible. Therefore, she

braced herself and followed Nox into the car.

There was no driver around today, so Nox drove himself.

When Shelly instinctively wanted to sit in the backseat, Nox shouted at her,

“Do you think I’m a driver?”

She just thought that the passenger seat should be reserved for Zoe, but she did not argue with Nox and sat in the front passenger seat.

Nox asked while driving, “Where’s the nearest convenience store?” It was a wealthy district, so how could there be convenience stores?

“There should be one on the opposite street.” Shelly thought for a moment and said.

Nox drove over and looked around until finally, he spotted a small shop selling stationery. From there, he bought a box of pens.

Shelly signed her name on the spot. Once she was done, she handed the document to Nox and happened to accidentally touch his hand.

Nox was visibly disgusted, but Shelly did not care. However, what he was concerned about was why Shelly’s hand was so hot. On top of that, her face had turned redder.

“Do you have a fever?” Nox asked.

Shelly did not answer.

“Shelly.”

“Yes, so will you give me an extra 10,000 dollars?” Shelly looked at Nox.

Nox sneered. That woman was really pushing her luck.

“Since you won’t, it doesn’t matter to you whether I have a fever or not.” Shelly said, “I’ve given you the agreement. If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave now.”

“Shelly, whose child is it?” Nox suddenly asked her.

Shelly was stunned.

The moment she saw Nox, she wondered when Nox had arrived and if he had seen Bella. However, there was no need to guess now.

She said, “It’s not yours anyway..”
