Chapter 753: Monica and Michael’s Conflict

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward didn’t answer. He didn’t want to shoot himself in the foot.

In truth… he thought that was just reality.

A relationship could bring one to heaven, but also make one fall into hell in an instant.

As Jeanne moved to get off Edward, he said, “We’re officially married. From the moment we were pronounced husband and wife, the thought never once crossed my mind that we’d be separated.”

Jeanne’s chest rose and fell slightly.

She was trying her best to keep her emotions in control.

Edward’s affection often overwhelmed her.

Jeanne only wanted to vent about Finn and Monica’s relationship.

She didn’t think she’d get a passionate confession.

Edward continued, “You’re bound to me for the rest of your life.”

A smile appeared on her face.

Who knew what thoughts were hidden behind that smile?

She gave him a kiss.

It was better that they kept the relationship purely physical.

...

The next day, Monica opened her eyes. She felt like her head was about to explode.

How could she feel so terrible? Just how much did she drink last night? Did Jeannie send her back again?

She drank until she blacked out, so naturally she did not remember that she cried her heart out last night and said she missed Finn.

She tussled her messy hair and got up.

Someone was knocking on the door.

Other than Michael and Jeannie, no one else knew about this place, not even her parents. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She opened the door.

Reese Witherspoon was standing outside her door. That surprised her.

What does Michael’s mother want?

She tried to calm herself down and smiled politely. “What brings you here?”

“I’ve come to see you.” Reese said with a regal bearing.

In the past month or so, Michael’s career in politics was taking off. The Rosses’ glory had gradually begun to recover. Reese was much less anxious and she looked much better.

“I’ve been fine.” Monica smiled shakily.

In fact, her relationship with Reese had not been very good. Ever since Reese rejected Monica from being with Michael a few years ago, she was traumatized by the woman. Though she’s shown Monica some vulnerabilities, some deep-rooted impressions were still difficult to change. Monica did not want to deal with her.

“So I came all the way here and you’re leaving me standing at the door?” Reese raised her eyebrows.

She looked completely different from when she had begged Monica to help Michael two months ago.

Now Reese was back to her high and mighty self again.

Monica didn’t retort.

Monica figured that people like Reese, who were used to a high status, would have a hard time changing her habit of doing things.

She smiled. “Please come in.”

Reese stood in the doorway but didn’t move.

Monica frowned. “Yes?”

“Aren’t you going to hand me my slippers?” Reese looked matter-of-factly.

Monica’s expression changed slightly.

She was also pampered from a young age. When has she ever been ordered around?

But Monica didn’t want to complicate matters. She was already at the end of her relationship with Michael. There was no need for her to have any conflict with Reese.

She opened the shoe cabinet, bent down, and placed a pair of slippers at Reese’s feet.

Only then did Reese take off her shoes, put on the slippers, and walked in.

She sat on Monica’s sofa and crossed her legs elegantly. She looked very high and mighty.

“Aren’t you going to pour me a glass of water?” Reese asked.

Monica bit her lip.

She turned and went to the kitchen, then poured water.

Monica was very much hungover last night and her head was about to explode. To top it off, she was being ordered by this old woman.

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

Therefore, when Monica handed the water to Reese, she was a little irritable. Monica spilled some of the water in the glass on Reese’s haute couture clothes. Reese’s expression immediately changed, and she lectured in a stern tone, “What are you doing? How are you going to be the young madam of the Rosses in the future?”

“I don’t want to be the young madam of the Rosses.” Monica snapped back. She couldn’t take it anymore.

Reese’s expression darkened. “Don’t tell me you think Michael isn’t good enough for you.”

“That’s not the point. I don’t like Michael.”

“Don’t be ungrateful.” Reese’s tone was cold.

“Mrs. Ross.” Monica did not want to waste time with Reese any longer. “You know very well that I’m only with Michael to help him salvage his image. Now that his career is going well, we’ll break up. That’s why you don’t have to waste time on me. I believe there will be many girls who catch your eye for the position of Michael’s wife.”
