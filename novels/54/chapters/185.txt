Chapter 186: Sleep Together

Edward took Jeanne into his embrace in satisfaction.

Jeanne had always known that Fourth Master Swan’s body was very sturdy.

As she was 166cm tall, she was petite next to him.

She even felt that her entire body was in his embrace.

Jeanne felt that if she was facing Fourth Master Swan, she would have been hugged by him like a bear, unable to breathe.

Fortunately, she chose to have her back against him.

As such, she felt his head buried directly into her neck.

Suddenly, she shuddered.

Her heart tightened.

The overly intimate sleeping position made her feel uncomfortable.

She moved her body and resisted.

“Ms. Lawrence, it’s best if you don’t move,” Edward whispered in her ear.

His voice seemed to be a little hoarse.

Jeanne endured it.

She knew that Fourth Master Swan was injured. She also knew that if he moved even a little, his wound might be torn again. Hence, she listened obediently and did not move.

At that moment, she heard Fourth Master Swan’s deep voice. “I won’t be able to control myself!”

“...”

‘Beast!’

In the quiet room, Jeanne was tense the entire time.

She was not used to it.

She was not used to having someone hugging her so tightly from behind.

Although George had been sleeping with her ever since they returned to South Hampton City, both of them had separate covers. Moreover, George did not like anyone touching him. Jeanne occasionally teased him and wanted to hug him, but she was also rejected by him. At night, she would sleep at the edge of the bed.

Therefore, she was not used to being hugged like this.

Meanwhile, the man behind her was breathing evenly.

He fell asleep very quickly.

Was it because he was too tired, or was it because he was too mentally exhausted? He was just teasing Jeanne a second ago, but he was sleeping so soundly at the moment.

Jeanne did not know how she felt either.

Nonetheless, after she felt the even breathing of Fourth Master Swan, she began to feel very sleepy as well.

Last night, she basically did not sleep at all.

In that kind of environment, no one could sleep.

At this moment, she was sleepy.

Then, she also fell asleep.

…

Outside the bedroom.

Downstairs in the hall.

Finn and Nox were sitting on the sofa, smoking.

Finn said, “Keep an eye on Fourth Master’s injuries this time.”

“Mm.” Nox took a deep breath and nodded. He said with some worry, “I’m not afraid of Fourth Master Swan’s injuries now. With his powerful recovery ability, he’ll recover sooner or later. What I’m worried about is how he’ll explain it to his dad for suddenly coming back.”

Finn glanced at Nox. “It’s my fault.”

“That’s not true.” Nox put out his cigarette. “If you hadn’t told Fourth Master Swan that Jeanne is in trouble, he’ll definitely fly into a rage when he comes back. At that time, we’ll be the ones suffering!”

Finn nodded. “Fourth Master treats Jeanne really well.”

“It’s a pity that she doesn’t appreciate his kindness.”

“It’s understandable,” Finn said, “Back then, Jeanne thought that Fourth Master would help her. In the end, he disappeared without a trace. It’d be strange if she didn’t hold a grudge.”

“Back then, Fourth Master Swan wasn’t able to resist so much. He couldn’t return.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Even so, after Jeanne left, shouldn’t Fourth Master go after her?”

“Do you think that given Fourth Master’s situation back then, he could go after her? His legs might’ve been broken before he leaves the country.” Nox was a little sarcastic.

Finn was silent.

To outsiders, Fourth Master Swan seemed powerful, but there were a lot of things about him that no one knew.

“I had hoped that Jeanne wouldn’t come back.” Nox sighed.

Finn frowned.

“If she doesn’t come back, they won’t see each other anymore. Even if Fourth Master Swan has always had such a person in his heart, after not seeing her and enduring for so many years, he wouldn’t really want to be together with her. Now that she’s back, great. She stimulated Fourth Master Swan’s nerves and now, things are out of control. I think that even god can’t stop him from being together with Jeanne.”

Finn could imagine how difficult the journey would be for Edward.

“Forget it.” Nox did not say anything more. “Anyway, it’s useless for us to talk too much about what Fourth Master Swan has decided on. Besides, after so many years, he has only fallen in love with such a woman. It’s not realistic for him to give up. I always feel that he can change his fate!”

Finn smiled.

Sometimes, even though Nox was always careless and did not treat Fourth Master Swan seriously, in fact, his admiration for him was beyond everyone’s imagination!

Perhaps it was because Nox knew everything about Fourth Master Swan how powerful he was that he would truly submit.

“Oh right.” Nox changed the topic. “How’s Jeanne’s case? Did you find anything?”

“I found some, but I was afraid of alerting the enemy, so I didn’t take any action.” Finn turned around and took out the documents, “This is all the information on Jeanne’s case. When Fourth Master wakes up, I’ll show them to him. What he needs the most now is rest. Don’t disturb him for the time being.”

“Okay.” Nox took the documents and looked at them.

“Actually, as long as it’s not a real crime, it won’t be a big problem,” Finn said. “No matter how powerful the Sanders are, justice is in the hearts of the people.”

Nox nodded and put down the documents. “Let’s talk about it when Fourth Master Swan wakes up.”

Finn nodded as well.

The two of them chatted for a while more.

“Finn, how are things with Monica?” Nox suddenly asked.

Finn was stunned.

“I don’t think you two should be together, nor do I think you two shouldn’t be together,” Nox said bluntly, “It’s just that I’ve been investigating someone recently.”

“Who?” Finn looked at Nox.

“Micheal.”

Finn frowned slightly. “What about him?”

“He’s the only son of Minister Liam Ross of the Rosses. He was born when the minister was already old, so a lot of importance was placed on his education from when he was young. Moreover, he was the only international exchange student from Harken who was sent to further his studies with relationships between countries as the premise. If nothing goes unexpected, he’ll be the next candidate to be groomed by the Sanders.”

Finn nodded.

He knew that too.

“Liam Ross suddenly fell ill, and his condition isn’t optimistic. According to the information I know, he might pass soon,” Nox said bluntly.

“What you mean is that Micheal is about to take over!”

“Yes, that’s why Fourth Master Swan asked me to keep an eye on him during this period,” Nox said, “It mainly depends on his ability. Also, it depends on whether he’ll do anything for the sake of power, and to what extent! It’s just in case.”

Finn was silent.

“We suspect that Micheal was involved in the case of Melody targeting Jeanne this time,” Nox said bluntly.

Finn frowned.

Monica even asked Micheal to help her…

He remained calm.

“Originally, I didn’t want to tell you many internal matters, but because it concerns Monica, it also indirectly concerns you, so I’ll tell you about it. Be careful of Micheal.”

“Mm.” Finn nodded.

“Well, what’s your relationship with Monica now? Have you reconciled? I’m your matchmaker, after all. This is my first time being a matchmaker in my life. Can you give me some face?” Nox, who had just been serious for a while, went back to his usual self.

Finn was also used to Nox’s abrupt behavior. He was about to speak when Teddy suddenly walked in from outside the hall.

Finn and Nox both looked at him.

Teddy said, “There’s a man named Kingsley Thorn outside. He says he wants to see Fourth Master.”

“Who?” Nox frowned slightly.

‘Who’s Kingsley Thorn?!’

He had never heard of this person’s name.

‘Who gave him the courage to come and meet my master?!’
