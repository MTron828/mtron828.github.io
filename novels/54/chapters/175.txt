Chapter 176: Is Fourth Master Swan Not Going to Interfere?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne and Monica’s conversation was interrupted.

Micheal said, “It’s about time to leave.”

Monica looked at Jeanne reluctantly.

Jeanne nodded. “Okay, don’t make things too difficult for Micheal.”

Monica’s eyes reddened again.

Jeanne was speechless by this silly girl, but she could not deny that she was touched. She said, “Don’t worry, I can take care of myself.”

Monica bit her lip as if she did not want to leave just like that.

“Monica, Micheal had a hard time letting you see me,” Jeanne reminded.

Monica knew, but she said, “Then I’ll come and see you again when I have the chance.”

‘There’s no need.

‘I’ll leave this place on my own.’

Nonetheless, Jeanne just nodded. “Okay.”

Monica still followed Micheal and left.

When she left, her eyes were extremely red.

She was afraid that something would happen to Jeanne.

Monica followed Micheal to the entrance of the detention center.

She saw Melody and Eden.

Monica’s expression changed immediately.

Before Monica could speak, Melody said to Micheal with an extremely ugly expression, “Micheal, if I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have thought that you’d really bring Monica to see Jeanne! Do you think it’s worth it to go against me for a woman?”

Micheal pursed his lips tightly, and his face was stiff.

Monica did not react in time.

At the next second, she looked at Micheal beside her, then at Melody.

‘So what Melody meant was that Micheal went against her for me.’

“Micheal, you better know your identity and the consequences of what you did!” Melody said as she walked past Micheal with Eden.

Monica gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she wanted to beat Melody to death, but she was afraid that she would cause trouble for Micheal, so she chose to endure.

“Let’s go.” Micheal suddenly held her hand.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat.

Micheal brought her into the car.

He drove on the streets of South Hampton City.

“Do you have a conflict with Melody now because of me?” Monica could not help but ask.

“It’s alright.” Micheal smiled gently.

“Will it affect you?”

“It’s not too serious.”

“I’m sorry, I...” Monica felt guilty.

“Monica.” Micheal held her hand in his. “Compared to Melody’s opinion of me, I’m more afraid of seeing you sad.”

Monica looked at Micheal.

He always made her feel very touched. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“So, don’t think too much.” Micheal smiled. “Besides, on the matter of Melody targeting Jeanne, we already have our differences. In other words, the conflict between us happened a long time ago.”

“Is it really Melody targeting Jeanne? How can she be so cheap?!” Monica was agitated.

“Melody grew up with the Sanders and was also the chief’s favorite woman. She was used to being superior since she was young. Now that she suffered a loss from Fourth Master Swan, she’s naturally unhappy. On top of that, she can’t do anything to him despite liking him, so she could only vent her anger on Jeanne. Of course. I can’t guarantee whether Jeanne’s crime was done on purpose by Melody or not, but I personally feel that no matter how willful Melody is, she should know the law and not break it. However, one thing is for sure. Once something happens to Jeanne, Melody will use all means to increase the severity of the original legal sanctions!”

Monica was nervous.

“I have to say that Jeannie’s case this time isn’t looking good.”

Micheal analyzed the situation as a bystander.

He even looked worried.
