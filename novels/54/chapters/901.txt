902 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

However, the wedding venue was huge, so it was not surprising that she could not find him.

In fact, she was very worried that Finn would suddenly come forward to snatch the bride.

Would he…

Especially the moment Michael was exposed in public and when everyone was insulting Michael, she was the only one worried that Finn would step forward and save her cousin from the grievance her cousin was suffering.

She was so nervous that her palms were sweating.

That was until a familiar voice said in her ear, “Go straight and turn right. Wait for me under the first big tree you see in the backyard. Don’t ask anything.”

It was Finn’s voice. Even though she could not see his face clearly in the dark, she could tell that he was talking to her from behind.

She did not know why Finn had suddenly asked her to do this, but after hearing Finn’s voice, she quickly did as he was told and went to the place he mentioned.

However, before she left the dining table, she did not see Finn’s figure when she turned around.

Although it felt weird, because it was Finn’s request, she did not think too much about it and went straight there.

She waited for a long time.

Just as she was suspecting whether Finn was deliberately sending her out of the banquet hall, she saw him arrive.

Just a second ago, she was wondering if Finn had sent her away because she did not want to see him snatch the bride away.

Even though that reason was untenable, she could not stop Finn from snatching the bride.

Fortunately, Finn finally showed up while her imagination was running wild.

The moment he appeared, he was still so distant. She even closed her eyes nervously, waiting for Finn’s lips to touch hers.

Just then, a stern voice startled Sarah. “You over there, come over!”

Finn let go of Sarah, and the two of them turned to look at a man in a guard’s uniform.

They seemed to be patrolling the wedding venue to make sure that no one was left behind!

“Go back to the main hall immediately!” that person ordered.

Sarah was confused, but seeing that person’s terrifying appearance, she was a little scared. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Finn pulled Sarah into his arms and walked into the hall under the surveillance of the security guards.

He had just entered the hall when Lucy came out of the toilet.

If they were just a second late and Lucy had seen Finn and Sarah, she would have stopped them and then found out that Finn was the hidden waiter.

However, Lucy did not see it, so she followed Kingsley’s instructions and quickly returned to the banquet hall.

When she returned, she saw Jeanne not far away.

She quickly walked over and said bluntly, “I lost him.”

“What?”

“That waiter.”

Jeanne frowned. “All the exits here have been blocked.”

“But I couldn’t find him, so Mr. Thorn told me to come back to cooperate with the Sanders. After all, the most important thing is to find that person. As for the waiter who disrupted our operation, we can only bear with it for the time being.”

Jeanne nodded.

“Where were you?” Lucy asked.

Jeanne’s expression changed. “Edward pestered me for a while.”

Lucy gave her a pensive look, and Jeanne shifted her gaze.

Jeanne did not explain the situation, and Lucy did not ask further. Some things were better kept to oneself.

“Fourth Master Swan is quite smart,” Lucy suddenly said.

“Hm?” Jeanne responded.

At that moment, her attention was focused on all the guards at the scene who seemed to be waiting for instructions.

Did that mean the Sanders were no longer planning to act in secret?

“If you were here just now, we could have chased after him together, and maybe we wouldn’t have lost him,” Lucy kept saying.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

At that moment, if she still believed that Edward did not know who she was, she would be lying to herself.

She did not reply.

After all, it was a fact. Other than feeling angry about it, there was nothing to gain.

She changed the topic. “So the Sanders have decided to do it openly?”

“You’re right. Rather than acting in secret, which might lead to failure, it’s better to be direct. That’s what I suggested to Mr. Thorn,” Lucy said. “He just talked to the Sanders, and they agreed.”

Before they came back, Kingsley had organized a meeting to discuss how to get the DNA of all the guests present. He had suggested saliva from the guests’ wine glasses. If nothing unexpected happened, all the guests would touch their wine glasses with their lips, even if they were drinking beverages. However, washing the sides of the wine glasses could not guarantee that they would be able to extract accurate DNA. Hence, in the end, they decided to use hair.

Getting the hair would be more complicated, but if nothing went wrong, it would be a piece of cake for the Hills’ assassins. They were just afraid that someone would make trouble midway, and their worry was not unnecessary. Now, their plan had really been ruined.

Therefore, Jeanne suggested that Kingsley communicate with the Sanders and get the hair in public. Kingsley had agreed, but the Sanders rejected him and even suspected that the Hills did not want to do it! Kingsley got angry and did not waste any more time talking to the Sanders. He chose the method they wanted.

In the end, since the mission had failed, they had to choose the first option.

It was a waste of the Hills’ manpower and resources.

Suddenly, a man’s voice rang out in the hall again, and he said seriously, “We’re going to start the investigation one by one now. Please be quiet and cooperate with our search. Once you are cleared of suspicion, we will immediately send you away.

As soon as he said that, all the guards at the scene began to move.

The Hills’ assassins did not need to join in.

They were not official troops, to begin with. Hence, what they had to do now was to keep a close eye on everyone at the scene. Once someone moved, they would act at the first moment.

At that moment, Jeanne could not help but look at Edward, who was standing in the distance.

She watched as he remained calm and collected!
