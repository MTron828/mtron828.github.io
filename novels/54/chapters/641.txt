Chapter 642: Can You Not Be So Cold to Me? It Scares Me

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In her memory, she was still in that lively nightclub, eating, drinking, and having fun with her friends. Then, all her unreliable friends left, leaving her limping and with no one to take care of her. As such, she told the nightclub staff to send her back!

In that case, did the staff send her back?

However, why was Michael in her house?

She felt like her head was about to explode.

Although she was sober, the effects of the alcohol had not subsided, so she was still suffering terribly.

“It was Finn who sent you back,” Michael suddenly said.

Monica’s hand that was rubbing her head stopped, and she looked at Michael fiercely.

Michael could see through her gaze very well.

As expected, Monica loved Finn. Otherwise, she would not have had such a big reaction.

“Don’t you remember?” Michael asked. No matter how grim he was feeling, he could still maintain a warm smile.

Then, Monica began to recall.

There were indeed some fragmented images of Finn in her mind, which she thought was part of a dream.

“But after he sent you here, he told me to send you home,” Michael said again, ignoring all of Monica’s expressions.

“You mean, he asked you to pick me up?”

Michael nodded. “I chatted with him for a while, and he thought you probably went into the wrong house.”

It turned out she instinctively went to Finn’s place she got drunk.

Then, Finn sent her back but did not send her home. Instead, he asked Michael to send her home.

What did that mean?

“Monica, I seem to have affected your relationship with Finn.” Michael blamed himself.

Monica pursed her lips, and her eyes were already red.

For Finn to give her to another man so late at night, was he really not afraid that she... would be in danger?

Or did he not care at all?

Michael looked at Monica’s appearance seriously and said, “Finn told me to tell you to stay away from him.”

Monica was shocked.

She suddenly got up from the toilet bowl.

Michael reached out to support her as she limped towards the sink.

Then, she turned on the cold water and washed her face.

From the side, Michael watched as she washed her face with the cold water, and tears were flowing out from between her fingers.

She said, “Michael, thank you. You can go back first.”

“I don’t trust you to be alone.” Michael was worried.

“I’m sober now.”

Nevertheless, Michael looked at her silently.

Monica washed her face with cold water again and wiped her face with a dry towel. She said, “I really am sober now. It’s so late, and you still have to go to work tomorrow. Hurry up and go back.”

“Monica, I’m sorry,” Michael apologized.

He seemed to blame himself for what happened.

“It has nothing to do with you.” Monica shook her head. “It was my decision.”

Michael looked at her worriedly.

“Hurry up and go back. I need to rest too.” Monica urged Michael.

Michael knew very well that he could not rush Monica right now.

All he had to do now was continue to treat Monica well, and Monica would gradually understand that Finn had completely let go of her. Once Monica understood that she and Finn would never be together again, she would return to his side. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

With that, Michael left.

To not make Monica feel repulsed by him, he chose to endure it, regardless of whether it was physical or mental impulses toward Monica.

As soon as Michael left, Monica could no longer control the emotions she was suppressing.

She looked at herself in the mirror and started crying her heart out.

How could Finn be so heartless as to hand a drunk her to another man?

If Michael was not a gentleman, would she have lost her virginity tonight?

…

By the time Finn sent Monica to Michael and returned home, it was already past 3 a.m. in the morning.

He always had a regular schedule.

Other than spending a few days with Jeanne to stay up late to keep vigil over Jonathan, he usually went to bed and woke up when it was time to do so. His self-discipline had long become a habit.

Hence, to be woken up in the middle of the night, he was very unhappy about it, especially since the person was Monica.

He walked into the bathroom, planning to wash up again before going to sleep.

While looking at himself in the mirror, he saw a hickey on his neck.

Monica seemed to be able to take the initiative toward anyone.
