Chapter 269: Dr. Jones Is So Nice to His Wife

“I’m sorry,” Finn said.

The words were very clear.

Monica looked at him.

She thought that after she made such a big fuss tonight, their relationship would become even more rigid and tense. They would be further and further away from each other. Based on her understanding of Finn over the years, he would definitely turn around and leave without any feelings.

However, at this moment...

He took the initiative to apologize to her.

Monica was a little shocked.

She heard Finn say as if he was explaining himself, “I didn’t mean to ignore your calls. I had an emergency patient at that time—”

“I know.” Monica interrupted him. “Your assistant told me.”

Finn looked at her.

Monica said, “I was being unreasonable. You don’t have to worry about it.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly.

“You know that I’ve been childish since I was young. I need to vent a lot of things. I was just venting just now. In fact, I’m very clear that it has nothing to do with you,” Monica said indifferently.

She was not so unruly that she wanted to blame Finn for ignoring her while he was saving a patient.

What she found hard to accept was that he was never by her side when she needed him.

Now, she understood.

Who was Finn to her? If he was not by her side, he would not be by her side when she needed him, let alone in normal times.

What right did she have to expect anything from him?

Monica did not want to continue this topic.

She said, “Give me back my phone. Go back to Fourth Master Swan’s place. I’ll go to the hospital to treat my wounds.”

“I’ll be gentler,” Finn said.

Monica looked at Finn.

It was rare to see Finn being gentle.

It felt so surreal.

Monica suddenly asked, “Are you feeling guilty?”

Finn pursed his lips.

“So you want to make it up to me?” Monica was straightforward.

She had known Finn for so many years. After getting along with him for so many years, other than the case of Finn being entangled with his “lover”, he was a very positive man. He had medical ethics, respected his elders, and treated his friends with respect. Other than treating Monica badly, it was undeniable that he had a good outlook on life.

Therefore, it was normal for Finn to feel guilty about what happened tonight.

He needed to do something to make himself feel better.

“If that’s the case, go ahead.” Monica did not want to be in a stalemate with Finn anymore.

If it was going to hurt, let her die from the pain.

It was only going to be five minutes.

Finn said that five minutes was enough.

In any case, Monica had suffered for more than five minutes from this man throughout their marriage. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She gritted her teeth and endured it.

Finn remained silent for a few seconds.

He suddenly stood up.

Monica looked at him and saw him suddenly turn around.

The moment he turned around, he said, “I’ll change my clothes and send you to the hospital. There’s no anesthetic at home.”

Monica watched him leave.

She never knew what Finn was thinking.

Why did he suddenly compromise?

After waiting for a few minutes…

Finn had probably cleaned himself up. Monica saw that Finn’s face, which was initially stained with blood, was now clean. After changing into a set of clean clothes, he looked much cleaner.

He walked toward Monica and bent down to carry her.

“I’ll walk on my own,” Monica refused.

Finn was stunned for a second.

Then, he nodded.

Monica struggled to get up from the sofa.

The pain in her knees was fine if she did not move, but once she needed to move, it was bone-piercing.

Monica gritted her teeth and walked toward the door step by step.

She had always been barefoot tonight. There were many cuts on her feet, but compared to the pain in her knees, she felt that they were not worth mentioning. She found a pair of slippers and followed Finn out of the house.

Monica returned to the car and was sent to the emergency treatment center of the hospital in the city center.

She sat in the trauma surgery room and waited for the doctor to treat her wounds.

Finn kept talking to the doctor and nurses.

After all, they were from the same hospital, so they should be familiar with each other.

Finn kept talking, and the doctor kept nodding.

Monica was a little far away, so she could not hear what they were saying.

She suspected that Finn had asked the doctor to be rough on her to prove that he was not rough just now.

Monica took Finn as a sinister person, so she believed that he would do it.

Her mind was wandering.

A nurse walked over first and was extremely gentle as she said, “Mrs. Jones, Dr. Jones said that you might still have some wounds on your body and asked me to help you treat them first. Lie down, and I’ll take a look at them for you.”

Monica frowned.

She still lay down obediently.

The nurse closed the curtain and helped Monica take off her gown.

There were indeed some scratches beneath it.

It was inevitable that Monica would have some injuries after jumping out of the car.

Fortunately, there were only scratches that were not serious. At this moment, some of them had formed calluses. As such, the nurse only helped Monica with simple disinfection and applied some medicine. She looked at Monica’s gown which was obviously tattered, then she asked gently, “Mrs. Jones, do you want to change into one of our patient’s gowns?”

“Do you have one?” Monica did not want to wear this tattered gown anymore.

“I’ll go get one for you.”

“Thank you.”

As soon as the nurse left, she returned again.

She said with a smile, “Dr. Jones has asked someone to bring one over just now. He’s so considerate to you.”

‘Ha-ha-ha.’

Monica only wanted to sneer.

Finn’s kindness to her was probably in front of others.

For example, he only knew how to pretend in front of her parents.

Monica changed her clothes with the help of the nurse. The curtain was then pulled open.

At that moment, the doctor also walked over and said to Monica, “Dr. Jones said that you’re afraid of pain, so he prepared two anesthetics for you. It’ll still be a little painful when they’re being administered, so please bear with it, Mrs. Jones.”

The doctor was obviously much gentler than Finn.

Monica nodded. “Okay.”

The doctor administered two doses of anesthetic to Monica.

One on each side of her knee.

It did hurt a little.

Nevertheless, it was much better than Finn applying medicine directly on her knees.

The anesthetics worked very quickly.

Monica felt that her legs were a little numb at the moment.

Fortunately, when the doctor began to treat her wounds, it did not hurt at all.

Anesthetics were good!

Monica lamented from the bottom of her heart.

The doctor treated Monica’s wounds, applied medicine on them, and bandaged them. After he was done, he said to Finn, “Try to change the medicine every day. The weather isn’t great now, so I’m afraid that she might get an infection.”

“Is there an available ward?”

The doctor was startled and said, “I don’t think there’s a need for her to stay in the hospital.”

“I just don’t want her to travel back and forth,” Finn said calmly.

The doctor was a little speechless.

The nurse beside him chuckled softly and could not help but say, “Dr. Jones is so nice to his wife.”

Monica was looking at her wounds at that moment. She felt that the bandages were done quite well. When she heard what the nurse said, she quickly looked up.

At that moment, she thought to herself.

‘This young nurse seems to be quite smart, but she’s a little blind.’

“I’ll contact the inpatient department.” In the end, the doctor nodded in agreement.

“Thank you.”

Soon, Monica was sent to the ward.

Finn had carried her there.

It was not that she was unwilling to walk, but that her legs were weak.

After she was anesthetized, she did not have much strength in her legs.

This made the “blind” nurse excited again. She kept saying, “Dr. Jones treats his wife so well. He’s too good...”

Monica rolled her eyes.

The reason Finn let her stay in the hospital was that he did not want to waste his time.

If he left her in the hospital, he would not need to care about her at all.

Was she the only person in this world who knew how bad Finn was?!

Of course, she did not refuse at that moment.

In fact, she wanted to avoid trouble. Moreover, her knees were so painful. Once the anesthetics passed, they would definitely hurt again. She wanted to avoid trouble as well.

Just like that, Monica was admitted to the VIP medical ward because of knee injuries.

As for those who were more seriously injured, they were recuperating at home.

For example, Jeanne, who was seriously injured!

In the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.

On Fourth Master Swan’s big bed.

Jeanne slept quietly on the bed.

Her wounds were finally thoroughly treated by Fourth Master Swan.

After the treatment was done, Jeanne was also extremely sleepy.

In fact, during the process, she had almost fallen asleep a few times but was woken up by the pain. She was able to hold on until now.

It was probably 4:00 am or 5:00 am.

“Go to sleep.” Jeanne heard a low voice in her ear.

She fell into a deep sleep.
