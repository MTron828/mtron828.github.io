968 Since You Refuse to Help Monica, I’ll Have To Do It, No?

When they got out of the car, Monica did not even have the chance to vomit before Jeanne dragged her into the crematorium.

She endured her nausea and rushed in with Jeanne. Then, she saw the little boy’s family.

Only his parents were there, and their eyes were already swollen from crying.

In fact, Monica still found it difficult to face them.

Whether it was the issue with the vaccine or not, the little boy’s accident happened after he was injected.

She did not dare to go over. However, Jeanne was already pulling her toward the young couple.

The couple’s eyes were dull, and their faces were lifeless. It was as if their lives had come to an end. There was no anticipation, but only desolation and despair.

The couple felt someone approaching them and turned around. The moment they saw Monica, their expressions changed.

The originally quiet waiting hall suddenly erupted with a woman’s shrill scream. “Monica, you horrible woman! How dare you have the nerve to show up here? I’m going to kill you. I’m going to die with you!”

At that moment, she stepped forward and grabbed Monica.

However, Jeanne suddenly stood in front of Monica.

That day, Monica could still put on an act with that woman in front of the reporters. In fact, she did not really hit that woman that day because she could not bear to do it then, let alone now.

Just as she thought that she was going to be beaten up badly again, she saw Jeanne standing in front of her.

Suddenly, she recalled her childhood.

Although they were studying in a prestigious school, there were always one or two school bullies who were mischievous and not afraid of anything! Once, Monica accidentally provoked the two little tyrants, and they blocked her way in the back garden of the school after school. They did not let her leave and even wanted to beat her up. Monica was so frightened that she cried loudly. At that time, it was Jeanne who found her and stood in front of her. It was also Jeanne who protected her behind her back.

Even though both of them ended up being beaten up by the school bullies, at that time, Monica felt that Jeanne was like her guardian angel, glowing with radiance.

Now, she was 25 years old, yet Jeanne was still standing in front of her and protecting her.

She heard a slap. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The woman slapped Jeanne’s face.

However, Jeanne did not retaliate. Instead, she said, “Please don’t get angry. We want to give your child justice.”

“Justice? What justice?!” The woman’s eyes were red as she screamed at the top of her lungs, “My child died because of the vaccine from Cardellini Pharmaceutical! But the police didn’t give us a result. All they said was that before the report came out, they couldn’t determine whether Cardellini Pharmaceutical had anything to do with our child’s death, so they couldn’t detain the person in charge of Cardellini Pharmaceutical. But now, the report still isn’t out yet, so what’s the use of it even when it’s released? Whether there’s a problem with the vaccine or not is not for us to decide. What can ordinary people like us do?

“We can only blame ourselves for being unlucky and incompetent. We can only blame ourselves for not being able to give our child a good living environment. Even when we die, we can’t give our child justice…”

The woman was crying so hard that she could not continue.

“I know how upset you are. I’m also a mother, so I understand how you feel.” Jeanne said to the woman, “We came looking for you today to tell you that your child’s death was not caused by the vaccine–”

“Enough!” The woman screamed, “You’ve already succeeded. What else do you want?! What else do you want from us? Do you want me to tell the media that my child’s death has nothing to do with you? Do you think that just because you’re rich, ordinary people like us should be tortured by you?”

“You’ve misunderstood. I’m not asking you to do anything for us, and we won’t be so selfish as to ask you to clarify anything. I swear that regardless of whether there’s a problem with the vaccine or not, I won’t force you to put in a good word for Cardellini Enterprise in front of the media! I’m here today to make you understand that your son’s death wasn’t because of the vaccine, nor was it an immune response. He was murdered!”

The woman was stunned, and so was Monica.

What was Jeanne saying?

How did it become murder?

“That’s why we need to do an autopsy on your child now. Once the autopsy report is out, we can prove the cause of your child’s death.”

“What are you guys talking about?!” The man could not take it anymore. “In order to clear your name, you can come up with anything! Our family has no grudges against anyone. Why would my son be murdered?”
