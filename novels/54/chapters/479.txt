She was crying so hard that she felt like she was about to lose her breath. It was as if she had suffered a great injustice.

Jenifer hurriedly hugged Jasmine and turned her head to Jeanne. “Jeanne, I have never been angry at you since you were young, but I really can’t hold it in any longer! I thought I had given you a lot, but I can’t believe you ended up so ill-mannered! With this behavior of yours, don’t you think your late mother would be ashamed of you?”

Alexander also rebuked angrily, “I regret letting you come back now. You’re simply a disgrace to our family!”

“Why did I come back? I come back to bring you benefits, didn’t I? If I couldn’t do that, would you have allowed me to come back?” Jeanne sneered. “Seeing you speak so pompously now, I’m afraid you’ve forgotten why you called me back then! You can keep your words to yourself. The people here are all elites in the business world and are very smart. If you say too much, you’ll only embarrass yourself.”

Alexander was rendered speechless by Jeanne’s words. He was exasperated but could not find the words to retort her for a long time.

“Sister, what made you like this? How did you become like this?” Jasmine asked while choking. She was very weak, but she still struggled to speak, to let others see how upset she was. “How can you slander me just because you can’t give birth to a child of the Swans? I didn’t carry Eden’s child in my belly because I wanted something from the Swans, nor did I do it to strengthen my position in the family. I really only wanted to give birth to the child because I love Eden. All I want is to live a simple life with Eden. I don’t know what goes on in the business world, but ever since I was young, my mother has always taught me how to be a good wife and mother. I’ve never wanted to steal what’s others. All I have ever wanted was to take good care of my husband and children. This is a woman’s greatest ability, and I’ve always thought of it that way...” Jasmine sounded a little anxious as she spoke.

At that moment, she was so weak that she could barely breathe, so Jenifer gently comforted her by the side.

“Since I was young, other than basic studies, I’ve never come into contact with business-related stuff. It’s because I’m not interested in those things, and I just wanted to be a housewife. I really don’t have that many ambitions other than being a quiet little woman. If you want to shine in your career, I can only give you my blessings as I’ve never thought of getting involved. But now, sister, for you to insult me and my life? I just want to live a life of my own. Why is it so difficult? What have I done to offend you for you to slander me like this? Unless... Could it be that since you can’t give birth to a child of the Swans, I can’t either?”

At that, tears streamed down her face again.

That aggrieved look of her really made people feel sorry for her.

At that moment, Eden walked over and hugged Jasmine in her arms, putting on a show of deep affection.

“Jasmine, don’t listen to her. I refuse to believe you’d betray me! Some people want to deliberately drive a wedge between us, and I will never believe her. I know it too well. Even if I don’t want you anymore, you will never do anything that will let me down, unlike some people who say she loves me but turn around and give birth to another person’s child! She thinks you’re just like her.” Eden expressed his trust in Jasmine while mocking Edward at the same time.

“Eden, I’m really tired. I don’t want to say anything to her or feel so bad anymore. Let’s go back and forget about this matter. From now on, I will avoid her.” Jasmine said weakly, “The next time I’m pregnant, I’ll move out from here, and I don’t want anything from the Swans either. I just want to live with you. I really don’t have any thoughts of relying on my children. I just want our little family.”

“Okay,” Eden agreed immediately.

As he agreed, he was about to pick Jasmine up and leave when Jeanne called out to them. “Stop!”

Eden looked at Jeanne coldly.

Jasmine also looked at her, looking very pitiful. “Sister, what do I have to do for you to let me go? How far do you want to push me? You don’t even like Eden anymore. Why do you still want to make things difficult for us? You’re so in love with Fourth Uncle. Why do you want to stop me from my happiness? Can’t I give birth to children of the Swans? Don’t tell me that I can’t if you can’t!”
