Chapter 723: The Family of Three

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After a night of intimacy, the sky outside was already bright when Jeanne opened her eyes.

She did not even know what she did with Edward last night…

In short, it was indescribable.

She flipped over, not knowing what time it was. Hence, she reached her snow-white hand out from the mattress to get her phone to check the time.

She did not know why the alarm clock did not go off today.

Just as she stretched out her hand, someone suddenly hugged her body.

Jeanne was instinctively frightened by how tightly the person behind her was hugging. She thought he was still sleeping.

After all, a certain someone had worked very hard last night.

She turned her head to look at Edward, only to see that he seemed to have just woken up too.

“Are you awake?” Jeanne asked.

“Yes,” Edward replied, and his casual voice was very attractive.

She used to think that the man in front of her was cold and aloof. Perhaps it was because of the image that he gave people in the past, that he was always difficult to approach and was always high and mighty.

However, after the two of them got together… She found him flirty.

At that moment, his big hands that were everywhere…

“Edward,” Jeanne called out for him to stop.

Was last night not enough? She was… close to dead.

Edward looked at Jeanne’s nervous look and laughed softly.

Damn it. He could not look any better when he smiled. Even the autumn sunlight could not even be compared to the brilliance on his face.

Was there a misunderstanding of his looks back then? She had always felt that the rumored Fourth Master was astonishingly handsome, but she never thought he looked charming. She always thought that he was the cold type. She had heard that Fourth Master Swan did not look good when he smiled, and that was why he always pretended to be cool.

As expected, the public had misunderstood Edward greatly.

They had a misunderstanding of his appearance, his personality, and... well, his character.

Edward did not force Jeanne. Instead, he hugged her in his arms and said, “Sleep with me for a while.”

“It’s late. I have to go to work.”

“It’s the weekend today.”

“I don’t have a weekend.”

“Yes, you do.”

“...”

The rumored cold and aloof Fourth Master Swan was as clingy as a piece of chewing gum.

Jeanne could not move in Edward’s embrace, even though she had been resisting silently.

“Jeannie.” Fourth Master Swan breathed in her ear.

Jeanne’s entire body trembled, and her ears were completely red.

“Be good, don’t move,” he said, his voice seductive.

Jeanne stared at him.

“It’s not safe,” Edward said straightforwardly.

Jeanne’s entire face flushed red.

Edward was a beast!

Nevertheless, Jeanne did not move.

Edward seemed to be very satisfied with her obedience at that moment. He hugged her into his arms again, and the two of them hugged each other tightly.

While in Edward’s warm embrace, Jeanne looked at the autumn breeze blowing at the trees outside the window, at the scattered sunlight under the curtains, colorful and dappled. She looked at... everything. It was peaceful and gentle.

Was it an illusion? It probably was an illusion

Otherwise, how could she have thought of that at this moment? It was as if she would be with him for the rest of her life.

She buried her head in Edward’s chest and listened to his strong heartbeat. Each heartbeat seemed to hit her heart.

Suddenly, she smiled, and it was obvious.

“Did you recall something happy?” Edward asked her from above her head.

At that moment, his chin was against the top of her head.

In front of Edward, she was obviously so petite that it was scary. Jeanne always thought that he could lift her up with one hand.

She hugged his strong waist.

Of course, she would not tell Edward of her thoughts, that between men and women, nothing could not be solved by sleeping together. If one time was not enough, two times would do the trick.

Last night, they had done it so many times that it drew the distance between them closer. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At least, Jeanne got to hand it to Edward’s skills in bed.

During the days when Edward was away, so many things happened. Admittedly, she felt that they were two independent individuals and did not think that she depended too much on anyone. However, deep in her heart, she would still think that if there was someone by her side, and if that someone was Edward, perhaps she would not feel so tired.

She did not answer his question. All she did was hug Edward tightly.

A lot of things that happened between them within that half month of being apart should probably just go up in smoke. For example, Lucy’s death.

The smile on Jeanne’s face gradually disappeared.

She knew that would leave a scar in her heart for a very long time, and it would take a while for her to forget.
