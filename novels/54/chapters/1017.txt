1018 Millie’s Tragic End

“I heard that Cardellini Enterprise has encountered some trouble–”

Before Ron could finish his sentence, Monica gave him a look.

Ron immediately shut up.

He thought that Monica did not know what happened to Cardellini Enterprise. Otherwise, how could she still be so strong, as if nothing had happened?

“So, uncle, you can come over during the day. My dad should be fine as there will be doctors and nurses taking care of him. I’m just worried that my mom will take things too hard.” Monica even smiled and said to Ruby, “Mom, are you really going to die for love because the doctor said he might become a vegetable? If dad wakes up and you’re not around, will he have to die for love too?”

Ruby looked at her daughter, who looked very optimistic.

She asked, “Will your father wake up?”

“I believe the heavens won’t be so cruel to him!” Monica was very certain. “My dad is such a good man. He has done so many good things in his life but never once a bad thing. I believe God will not let him lie in bed forever and that dad will wake up eventually.”

At that moment, Ruby seemed to have been persuaded by Monica’s words.

She said, “Yes, your dad will definitely wake up.”

“So, we should listen to dad and take care of ourselves. Then, when he wakes up, we can give him a good explanation.”

Ruby nodded, and only then did she finally begin to eat.

Monica smiled.

He tried his best to pull a smile from the corner of his mouth.

Jeanne was right. She was already a grown-up and had to bear everything on her own. She could no longer rely on anyone!

She finished the dinner in front of her.

After that, she told her uncle and his family to go home, and she accompanied her mother to sleep on the hospital bed.

“Monica, thank goodness I still have you.” Ruby was talking in her dreams.

Monica could hear her mother’s voice mid-sobbing and choking.

In fact, she felt the same too.

Fortunately, she still had her mother. If not for her mother, she might have accepted her fate!

…

On the Delta Islands, after Jeanne got off the plane, Kingsley personally came to pick her up.

Neither of them said a word as the car returned to the Hills’ residence.

The moment Jeanne returned to her room, Kingsley said, “Give me your phone.”

Jeanne frowned.

“I’ll confiscate your phone during this period to stop you from contacting the outside world.”

“Kingsley!” Jeanne was furious.

“Warren specifically told me to watch over you so that you won’t interfere with Harken’s affairs.”

“Whatever he says, right?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“Now, we must gain his trust.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“That was why he didn’t care about my feelings.”

“You just want to help Monica, but I can tell you responsibly that you can’t do that.”

Jeanne glared at him.

“Let’s not talk about back when Warren didn’t specify any names and tell us not to interfere with Harken’s affairs. Back then, I could let you do some personal things that you wanted to do. But now, since Warren has made himself clear, I will definitely not let you ruin all of our plans for your personal feelings.”

Jeanne bit her lip.

“Jeanne, you shouldn’t have all these feelings,” Kingsley said coldly.

“So you want me to become a homicidal maniac like you?”

“If it’s possible, I would rather you become like me!” Kingsley was harsh.

Jeanne looked at him coldly.

Kingsley no longer had the patience to argue with her, so he bent down and took out her phone from her pocket.

The moment he took it away, he said, “Don’t even think about getting the phone from others. I can’t guarantee that my authority will be effective on everyone in the Hills. However, I can tell you that whoever whose phone you use will never live to see the next day’s sun, including Mason and Lucy, whom you think I can’t bear to kill. I mean what I say!”

“You’re so cruel, Kingsley!”

“I never said I was a good person, and I’m not a good person either.”

Then, Kingsley left, without saying another word.

After Kingsley left, Jeanne slammed the door shut. The slam was so powerful that it created a loud noise.

Kingsley definitely heard it.

He stopped in his tracks and said, “Call Lucy to my room.”

“Yes.” The high-level assassins beside him immediately showed their respect and did not dare to be slow for even a second.
