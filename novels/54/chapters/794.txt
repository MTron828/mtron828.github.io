Chapter 795: Monica Discovers Michael’s Disguise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Most importantly, her current appearance… was tragic. No matter what, in a bustling city, most people’s hearts were cold.

With that, the driver drove off.

Monica walked past a traffic light and then entered a residential area.

She was going to Finn’s house. It used to be the home she shared with Finn, but now, she found the door in front of her unfamiliar.

She stood at the door for a long time, not knowing what she was doing standing there or what she was there for.

She did not even have the courage to knock on the door, so what exactly was she doing here?

She laughed at herself and looked at the closed door. Although they were separated by a door, it felt like they were miles apart.

Just as she turned around to leave, the door suddenly opened.

Monica’s heart skipped a beat when she saw Finn appear at the door with a bag of garbage.

At that moment, he also saw her in front of him.

Monica saw the disgust in his eyes. In fact, she also felt disgusted by herself, not to mention Finn.

However, she smiled at Finn, and her smile made Finn even more disgusted.

Even so, she still opened her mouth and said, “Finn, if I tell you that I regret it and want to start over with you, will you agree?”

“I won’t,” Finn replied to her calmly without any hesitation. He was very determined.

“I know Michael lied to me,” Monica said, surprisingly calm.

Finn was still unmoved.

“It turns out all of you saw it, but I couldn’t,” Monica said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Finn simply looked at her silently.

“Now that I know, I won’t be with Michael anymore. Can we start over?” Monica asked again but with a smile, looking very innocent.

Finn said, “I’m not someone who can come and go at your beck and call. Since you chose Michael back then, you chose him. Between us, it’s already over.”

She had made a choice back then, and it was the stupidest decision in the world. Now, nothing could be done to reverse that decision.

That was right. Everyone was responsible for their own actions, and since she was stupid, she should accept that outcome.

While keeping a smile on her face so that she did not look pathetic, she said, “I guessed so too.”

She just said it at the top of her head. After all, she had come to take her chances.

Growing up, her luck had not been too bad, so she thought what if she ran into good luck?

After that, she turned around and left. She figured that good luck would never come to her again because of how stupid she was.

As she walked into the elevator, Finn suddenly called out to her, “Monica.”

Monica’s hand, which was pressing the elevator button, trembled slightly, and she pursed her lips tightly.

That was when she heard Finn say, “Don’t ever say things like that to me in the future. I don’t want to waste time dealing with you.”

“Alright.” She nodded and did not look back.

She was nodding her head furiously, not daring to let Finn see her tears.

She was afraid that Finn would think she was pretending to be pitiful and that he would hate her even more.

When the elevator arrived, Monica walked straight in. Then, she lowered her head and pressed the elevator button before the elevator door closed.

While leaving, it crossed Monica’s mind that this would probably be the last time in her life she would step into this place.

Back then, no matter how determined Finn was in rejecting her, and even though he had made it so obvious that he would not be with her anymore, she still had a glimmer of hope. She held onto the hope that after she had separated from Michael and when the truth came to light, she would still have a chance to start over with Finn.

However, now she knew that she had lost her chance.

Finn was not the only one who had given up on her as she, too, had given up on Finn because she was not worthy of him.

She walked out of the neighborhood and left in another taxi.

She did not know why, but now that she was sitting in the car now, she felt calm.

When she first found out the truth, she felt so hopeless that she cried because of her own stupidity. However, after Finn rejected her so explicitly, she felt nothing as if she had accepted everything.

It was probably because her heart was dead.

Therefore, even if she encountered something shocking, it would be nothing.

When she returned to her apartment, she opened the door and realized how big her house was.
