Chapter 1670: Jeanne Helps Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Nox is ruining Shelly’s relationship?” Monica was surprised.

What did Sarah mean by destroying Shelly’s relationship? Did Shelly have a boyfriend?

“That’s right! It’s sabotage!” Sarah said confidently, “Shelly is dating a boy who had good grades in high school, and he treats Shelly really well. He has been in love with Shelly since high school and is a hundred times better than Nox. Now that Nox sees how stable Shelly’s relationship is, he’s jealous. And as you saw, Nox is crazy about pursuing Shelly.

“It makes me suspect that Nox either likes Shelly or can’t bear to see Shelly live a good life! Monica, I don’t understand. Is Nox a psychopath? Why can’t he bear to see other people doing so well?”

Monica also fell silent. Although Nox used to be a playboy, he was not that despicable.

At first, she thought Nox did something so crazy because he liked Shelly.

However, now that she had heard it from Sarah, Nox was a complete jerk!

“Now, Benjamin, Shelly’s boyfriend, will be going overseas in two days for an opportunity to study abroad, which is supposed to be a happy thing. Even if they have to be away from each other, it would at least be of great help to Benjamin’s future because when he comes back, he’ll have a better job and be able to provide Shelly with a better life. However, Nox is deliberately ruining their relationship. At this juncture, isn’t it obvious that he’s making things difficult for Benjamin? Seeing how Nox is pursuing Shelly now, do you think Benjamin will want to leave or stay?” Sarah became angrier as she spoke.

“Damn it, Nox is a scumbag!”

Upon hearing that, Monica also found Nox to be a sc*mbag.

“Monica, since you’re friends with Nox, why don’t you go talk to him and tell him to stop making things difficult for Shelly? She finally has a stable life and a boyfriend like Benjamin who treats her well. Please can he stop ruining her life? Shelly has suffered a lot in the past and has worked hard to get everything she has now. She doesn’t deserve to be destroyed by Nox!”

“Okay, I’ll go talk to Nox about it,” Monica said.

Her intention was to find out about Shelly’s feelings for Nox and help out if she could. However, she did not expect to find out about Nox’s evil side instead!

Monica hung up the phone and looked at Finn who was driving.

Finn felt her death stare and was a little confused. “What’s wrong?

“Do you know your best friend, Nox is a sc*mbag?” Monica was a little angry.

If what Sarah said was true, Nox was shameless.

“I only have one best friend, who is Monica, not Nox,” Finn said seriously. His desire to live was strong.

Monica originally thought that she would be angry no matter what Finn said and that she would take the opportunity to throw a fit. However, after hearing what Finn said, she could not find any reason to lose her temper.

She took a deep breath and adjusted her emotions. She said, “I’ll say this now. If Nox is really as bad as Sarah said, I’ll take Shelly’s side. Shelly has helped me once, and I have to return the favor to her.”

“What did Nox do?” Finn was also curious.

How could Nox, a man who had been cheated on so badly, have any bad intentions?

“In any case, it’s unpardonable.”

Was Nox that bad? Based on his understanding of Nox, Nox was just a little playful, but his character was alright.

“Anyway, don’t interfere in Nox’s matter,” Monica said firmly.

“Okay,” Finn answered.

In fact, he did not explicitly agree as he was still curious about what Nox had done to offend Monica — or Shelly, to be precise. There was nothing wrong with liking someone and pursuing someone, right? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Only recently did Nox realize that he had fallen in love with Shelly. Although he did treat her horribly back then, it was because he did not like her. Now that he liked her and was pursuing her again, there was nothing wrong with that!

Although Finn was a little puzzled, he did not ask further, for fear that Monica would burst out in anger. Sometimes, women could be really unreasonable..
