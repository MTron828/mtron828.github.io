945 Monica Stirring Up Trouble

Monica did not come up with that official speech. Naturally, it was the Cardellini Enterprise’s official spokesperson who helped her draft it.

She even took quite a while to memorize it, but fortunately, she managed to memorize it all.

She gulped.

At that moment, she heard a reporter ask, “Do you have any evidence to prove that Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine is safe? As far as I know, the quality inspection department hasn’t issued an official test report yet. Ms. Cardellini, don’t you think it’s a little too much to suddenly announce that there’s nothing wrong with Cardellini Enterprise’s vaccine?”

“Whether it was an accident or not, it’s not up to you to say. Don’t you think your actions today are a little too humiliating? ” The reporter’s words were sharp.

He did not show Monica any respect at all.

“I also want the authorities to give me a result, but they haven’t made any progress yet. I don’t know how long we’ll have to wait for the official result.” Monica said to the reporters bluntly, “If the authorities take a year and a half to come out with the results, that means our company will have to bear with being slandered for a year and a half. I think by that time, the Cardellini Enterprise’s building might be razed to the ground.”

“Ms. Cardellini, are you complaining about the efficiency of the quality inspection department?”

“It’s not a complaint. I’m just stating a fact,” Monica indirectly admitted it.

“If that’s the case, Cardellini Enterprise can communicate privately with the quality inspection department. Don’t you think it’s a little disrespectful to the quality inspection department to criticize them in public?” the reporter asked again.

“The quality inspection department is under the Sanders’ official food quality inspection department. They should be more concerned about how to give the public a fair and just result instead of abusing their power to get other people’s attention. Besides, isn’t the Sanders’ philosophy to serve the people? Is dignity a standard of service to the people?” Monica asked in return.

The reporter’s face suddenly turned red. He also seemed to have realized that he had said something wrong.

He quickly explained, “What I mean is that you can communicate with each other openly. I believe the quality inspection department will give you a good answer.”

“It’s precisely because I didn’t get a reply that I chose to use this method,” Monica said bluntly.

“Do you mean the quality inspection department rejected your request?”

“It’s not a rejection. It’s special treatment,” Monica said bluntly, “There are so many medical malpractices in Harken, but none of them have been examined by a special team that the quality inspection department had set up. Of course, I agree with the quality inspection department’s working attitude. They’re afraid that Cardellini Enterprise would do something shady in the dark, and that’s why they haven’t given us a time frame and have made us wait blindly. However, I’m sorry. Cardellini Enterprise can’t wait that long. I need the quality inspection department to give me a clear answer now. How long will it take for the results to be out?”

“Ms. Cardellini, do you mean that the quality inspection department is operating in secret?” one of the reporters asked.

“I don’t know. I’m just voicing my doubts. After all, according to the standard of quality inspection technology in our country, the test results for vaccine problems can be out in less than a week. However, the quality inspection department has not given us any time frame. From my standpoint, it naturally leads me to think of the worst. By then, who’s wrong…” Monica did not seem to want to hide anything and said bluntly, “I don’t know if it was the conflict between me and Michael that caused the relevant staff of the quality inspection department who had a good relationship with Michael to deliberately make things difficult for Cardellini Enterprise.”

“You mean, this matter has something to do with Michael?”

“As I said, the current development is forcing me to think in that direction. As for whether it has something to do with him, I don’t know.”

It was obvious that she was deliberately making people suspect him.

Then, the quality inspection department would want to avoid suspicion, and they would have no choice but to deal with the Cardellini Enterprise’s matter fairly.

“In that case, Ms. Cardellini…”

As the reporters were getting a little restless, a woman suddenly rushed into the press conference.

The moment the door opened, everyone’s attention was on her.

That woman directly rushed toward Monica, grabbed her hair, and went crazy.

Stunned by the scene, all the reporters quickly took many photos. After all, reporters loved to blow things up.

Monica and the woman fought for a long time before the security guards pulled the woman away.

As soon as she was pulled away, the woman shouted at Monica, “Give me my son back!”

At that moment, Monica’s hair was in a mess, and her face and body were scratched by the woman’s nails, making her look disheveled.

“Who are you?” Monica asked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Who am I? Something happened to my son only because of your company’s vaccine… Y-You… I want you to pay with your life.”

After saying that, the woman was about to rush over again.

Fortunately, the security guards held her down.

Monica was also enraged. “Do you think you’re the only victim? Am I not? Cardellini Enterprise is now being boycotted by the entire nation because of this vaccine, and we’re about to go bankrupt! Not only that, but my dad is still in the hospital because of this accident. We don’t know if he’ll live or survive. Your son’s body rejected the vaccine, and Cardellini Enterprise has compensated you and done everything we should do. However, who will make up for what our Cardellini Enterprise has suffered?”

“Y-Y-You… My son is dead. How can you say such things? How can you?” The woman broke down.

“Before the inspection report from the quality inspection department comes out, no one knows if there’s a problem with our vaccine or your son. Now that you’re complaining that I killed your son, can I sue you instead? Your son’s accidental death has put Cardellini Enterprise in our current predicament. My glory and wealth have all been ruined in your son’s hands. Are you going to compensate me for all my losses?!”

“Y-You… How could you say that? How could you be so vicious? God will punish people like you and send you to hell–”

“I’m telling you that before the results are out, it’s useless even if you curse me to death.” Monica rushed toward the woman in an imposing manner.

At that moment, she even waved her hands and left the press conference.

The woman was so angry at Monica that she fainted.

The scene was in chaos again.

However, it had to be said that Monica, with her notorious reputation, had blown the whole thing up!
