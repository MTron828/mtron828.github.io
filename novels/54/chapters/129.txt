Chapter 130: I Fulfill All the Definitions of a Bad Girl

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Yes,” Amy said respectfully.

“Make me a cup of coffee. No sugar, thank you.”

“Yes.”

Amy took a deep breath and left Jeanne’s office.

When Amy walked into the office again, Jeanne lit a cigarette.

Amy was stunned.

She noticed that there were occasional cigarettes in Director Lawrence’s office, but she had never seen her smoke. She always thought that it was someone else’s.

She was a little surprised.

Jeanne was very calm. “Put it down.”

Amy came back to her senses and quickly put the coffee on Jeanne’s desk.

After putting it down, Amy could not help but say, “Director Lawrence, you’re completely different from my impression of a rich young lady.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne answered.

“When I was first arranged to be your secretary, I thought you were like Deputy Director Lawrence. I thought that you don’t know anything, and you’re just here to experience life.” Amy said bluntly.

Jeanne smiled.

She put out the cigarette butt and said casually, “I’m afraid that’s not what you mean when you said that I’m different.”

“I really admire your ability now,” Amy explained quickly.

“You’re more curious about why I race cars and smoke, aren’t you?” Jeanne smiled faintly.

Amy was embarrassed.

It was as if someone had seen through her thoughts.

Jeanne said nonchalantly, “I fulfill all the definitions of a bad girl.”

Amy was stunned.

Then she became nervous. “Director Lawrence, I didn’t say that you...”

“You can go out now,” Jeanne ordered.

Amy gritted her teeth.

She really did not say that Director Lawrence was a bad person.

She really treated Director Lawrence differently.

Amy walked out of Jeanne’s office and closed the door.

Jeanne took a sip of coffee.

She did not argue with Amy because she did not want to waste too much time explaining. After all, she was short of time.

About the so-called bad girl.

She was telling the truth.

Having a child out of wedlock.

Smoking and drinking.

Racing and tattooing.

Fighting.

Which did she not do?

She put down her coffee cup and organized herself.

In an instant, she put all her attention on work.

2 am.

When Jeanne took a breather from work, it was already so late.

She stretched her body, and she felt her whole body aching.

She stood up from her chair and casually picked up her phone to take a look.

She turned her phone to mute and placed her phone with the screen facing down. She was not used to being disturbed while working.

She saw a few missed calls on the screen from Alexander. She ignored all of them. However, she dialed back the moment she saw Monica’s call.

Monica was in a daze.

She picked up the call. “Jeannie, why are you looking for me so late at night?”

There was sleepiness in her voice.

Jeanne finally realized that it was already so late.

She said, “It’s fine, you can continue sleeping.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Oh.” Monica was about to hang up when she suddenly realized something. “What did you do tonight? Why didn’t you answer my calls?”

“I was working overtime.”

“Is the Lawrence Enterprise in trouble? I heard that there was a problem with the construction of your logistics warehouse, and you were in charge of this project?”

“I can solve it.”

“I just want to ask if you need my help,” Monica asked.

“Not at the moment.”

“You always like to put on a brave front.” Monica was notably upset.

“No, I really can. Don’t worry, go to sleep.”

“You’re still working overtime?”

“I’m getting off work soon.”

“You have to take care of yourself,” Monica reminded.

“Okay.”

Monica hung up the phone worriedly.

She put down her phone and covered herself with the blanket, preparing to go back to sleep.

At that moment, she suddenly felt a pain in her chest.

Damn it.

Monica got out of bed.

She had been in a lot of pain recently. Could it be that Finn Jones angered her so much that her mammary gland hyperplasia relapsed?
