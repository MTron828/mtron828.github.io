Chapter 469: Constantly Seeking Her Own Destruction

“Don’t you think your words contradict each other? Since they’re sisters, why would Jeanne push Jasmine?” Old Master Swan’s face was cold.

Belle was a little speechless for a moment.

However, the next second, she quickly said, “Jasmine has always been kind-hearted, and she has never found fault with Jeanne. On the other hand, Jeanne can’t stand seeing Jasmine having a good life. Moreover, I have to say that back when Jeanne and Eden were a couple, they would have been together if it weren’t for Jasmine. That’s why Jeanne has always held a grudge.”

“That’s right. If Jasmine had a kind heart, could she have hurt her sister’s feelings?” Old Master Swan asked coldly.

Belle was speechless again.

Her eyes were red as she looked straight at Old Master Swan. It was obvious that he was overly biased toward Jeanne.

Belle was on the verge of breaking down. She was at her limit, trying to suppress her emotions, but she could not find any words to refute him.

At that moment, Henry could not stand it anymore because the bias was obvious.

Taking advantage of Jasmine’s matter, Henry’s family did not think of going easy on Jeanne!

He went forward and looked at Old Master Swan, visibly angry. “Dad, why do you have to protect Jeanne like this? Since young, you have always protected Edward, but we can accept all that we’ve suffered. After all, Edward is our youngest brother and someone capable of managing Swan Enterprise well. Although we’re a little dissatisfied with it, we respect dad’s decision. Yet now, you protecting Edward’s wife like this really humiliates us. I can tolerate anything but this!”

Old Master Swan’s eyes narrowed. “What I want is evidence. Without evidence, I won’t believe Jeanne would treat Jasmine that way.”

“Evidence, I have it,” Jasmine suddenly said.

Her weak voice rang out softly in the hall that was filled with tension, and everyone looked at Jasmine, whose face was pale at that moment. In Eden’s embrace, she looked extremely pitiful. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

......

She broke free from Eden’s arms.

Eden was worried for her. “Be careful.”

Jasmine nodded.

She looked like she barely managed to stand up and said to Old Master Swan, “Actually... if the child could’ve been saved, I wouldn’t have said it. My sister and I... Indeed, there are some conflicts between us, but she’s my sister after all. I have never thought of fighting with her. I have always wanted to get along with her peacefully. Regarding the matter between Eden and I back then, I really do feel guilty toward her–”

“Get to the point!” Old Master Swan did not seem to buy Jasmine’s pitiful words.

“Yes,” Jasmine answered respectfully. She did not feel embarrassed because of Old Master Swan’s harsh tone.

She said, “Last night, I went to the bathroom. As I walked over, I saw my sister coming out. When she came out, she looked at me and didn’t look too happy. I knew she had always disliked me, so I was always careful not to provoke her. However, last night, she stopped in front of the bathroom door and used her hand to push me to the ground on purpose.”

“This is still your one-sided statement!” Old Master Swan lost his patience with her.

“Yes, that’s true. It’s my one-sided statement, but... She really did push me. I knew I had to be exceptionally careful after I became pregnant with this baby, afraid I would fall. So, I definitely wouldn’t have slipped and fallen on my own. Now when I think about this baby, when I think about how my sister was so heartless to push me, I-I...” Tears started streaming down her face.

“So, you still don’t have any evidence to prove that Jeanne was the one who did this.” Old Master Swan’s expression was very ugly by now.

“How do I have evidence?” Jasmine cried miserably at that moment. She felt that she had suffered a great grievance, yet no one understood her still. “There were only the two of us at the bathroom door. What evidence can I produce to make everyone believe that Jeanne pushed me? I-I-I...”

At that moment, Jasmine was almost out of breath. She seemed agitated but did not know how to express it, and she looked as if she was going to faint at any moment.

Eden quickly went forward and hugged Jasmine.

Jasmine leaned into Eden’s embrace and cried her heart out.

“Dad, as a bystander, from a fair and impartial standpoint, I think you’re making it hard for Jasmine by getting her to produce the evidence. The incident happened very suddenly. How do you expect Jasmine to produce evidence in such a short time? It would take some time to produce evidence, and dad, you can’t be so biased toward Jeanne. From what I see, I don’t think Jasmine could have wronged accused Jeanne. In any case, Jasmine married into the family and is eager to please us. Once she gets pregnant, she can rely on her child to support her. She would not treat her own baby carelessly,” Elaine said, with a righteous look on her face. “Logically speaking, this matter is definitely related to Jeanne!”
