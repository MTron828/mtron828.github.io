Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He took a deep breath and picked up the call. “Leader.”

“How’s Cardellini Pharmaceuticals coming along?” the other party asked immediately.

“It’ll be done in a few days”

“Alright.” Warren replied, “Do you know about Eden?”

“I know.” Michael did not hide anything.

“I heard you have a good relationship with him?”

“We’re classmates, so we’re great friends. He’s also the eldest young master of the Swans. I think he’s useful, so I’ve been keeping in touch with him,” Michael said.

“He escaped right under our noses,” Warren said bluntly.

“I heard about it.” Michael said, “I tried to contact Eden, but I couldn’t.”

“Michael.” Warren’s tone was stern.

“Yes,” Michael replied respectfully.

“You’d better not let me find out anything.” Warren made himself clear.

Michael’s grip on the phone tightened.

It turned out that the Sanders had started to suspect him.

In fact, he had also expected this.

He had a good relationship with Eden, so it was understandable for the Sanders to suspect him when something happened to Eden.

However, they had no evidence, so they would not do anything to him.

That was also the reason why he wanted Eden dead. If Eden were alive, he would definitely be implicated.

He said, “Leader, I’m loyal to you, and I’ll die for you.”

Michael expressed his stance seriously and sincerely.

He knew very well that the Sanders had no evidence because if they did, they would have killed him long ago.

At that moment, Warren was just testing or threatening him.

“I can make you my right-hand man, but I can also make you lose everything. Michael, you’re a smart man. ”

“Yes, leader.”

“I’ll give you at most a week to deal with Cardellini Pharmaceuticals. I don’t want any more mistakes,” Warren said before hanging up the phone.

Michael looked at his phone, and his expression was grim.

Although the Sanders was not making a move on him now, they were threatening him.

If he could not meet the Sanders’ requirements, he would soon be kicked out of the political scene.

His face turned cold.

‘Monica, it’s not that I don’t love you. However, in the face of my career, love is nothing.’

…

At 8 p.m., just as Monica was about to call Michael, she received a call from Michael.

“I’m sorry. I was working overtime,” Michael apologized.

Monica’s anger subsided.

She knew that Michael had a lot of things to do and that he was busy, yet he still had to deal with her matters.

She should be more understanding of him.

She said, “It’s fine. It’s not too late now.”

“Are you home? I’ll be right over.”

“Um…” Monica hesitated for a moment. “You haven’t had dinner yet, right? Let’s meet at a restaurant.”

Michael was driving, his face clearly ugly.

Was Monica guarding against him? She was so guarded that she did not even want to him in her house.

However, he said, “Alright, I’ll come and pick you up.”

“No need. Send me the address, and I’ll just take a taxi.”

“Alright.” Michael nodded.

After that, Monica hung up the phone and took a deep breath.

She had always felt that she was too standoffish to Michael, and her rejection of him was obvious.

Although she and Michael could be considered friends, she did not know when she had started to keep a distance from him.

However, she told herself not to overthink it.

She reckoned that once her involvement with Michael was over, they should be able to become normal friends again, and she would not have any prejudice against Michael.

With that thought in mind, she quickly went out the door.

She followed the address Michael had sent her and went straight to the restaurant Michael mentioned.

When she arrived, Michael was already waiting for her at the door.

In fact, every time Monica faced Michael, she had no confidence.

She did not know why, but it was probably because he was too good to her. He was so good to her that she could not say what she wanted to say most of the time. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

She gritted her teeth, silently cheering herself on.

With that, the two of them walked into the restaurant’s private room.

Behind them, Reese stared at them.

She had gone for a facial and done some shopping with her two sisters today, and now, they were having a meal together at the restaurant.

The moment she entered and saw her son and Monica, her expression changed.

Michael had not had a meal with her in such a long time.

Every time she told him to come back or ask him out for dinner, he would say that he was busy. Yet now, he was having dinner with Monica.
