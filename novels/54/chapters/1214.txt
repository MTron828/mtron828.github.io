1215 The Love Rivals Meet

Edward stood beside them and pretended to be the bad guy. “George, go back to your room and take a shower.”

George bit his lips, not very willing to do what Edward told him to.

“I’ll go with you.” Jeanne took George’s hand.

Edward stared at their backs and held back the words that he was about to say.

After Jeanne and George returned to the room, and Jeanne was looking for clothes for George, George looked at his mother and said, “Dad told me not to tell you.”

Jeanne paused in her search for clothes.

“But I really don’t want to go there anymore.” George’s tears flowed out of his eyes.

After all, no matter how mature he was, he was only six years old. At the age of six, when he was faced with something he did not want to do and felt powerless, he could only cry.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly, and she lowered her head to wipe his tears. She said, “George, do you know that Kingsley is dead?”

George was shocked. Tears blurred his vision as he stared at his mother in disbelief.

Jeanne said, “I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to be sad.”

George’s tears flowed even harder.

“I’m telling you now because I want you to know that we don’t have anyone to back us up. In other words, the only person in this world who can protect us is no longer here. Therefore, we need to protect ourselves. We can’t be willful anymore.” Jeanne stroked George’s head as if to comfort him.

In fact, she was already in tears.

In this world, there was no one who could protect them, so they could only choose to protect themselves.

“Can’t dad protect us?” George asked her. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jeanne pursed her lips.

It was not that he could not protect them. Rather, he just had too many people to protect, so he would not be able to take care of everything.

Jeanne said, “I hope you can become stronger on your own.”

“Do I have to do that to be strong?” George could not help but ask.

“You must,” Jeanne replied firmly.

George bit his lips.

“You will understand in the future.” Jeanne used a logic that all children could not accept.

However, that was the only reason she could use.

“Go take a shower.” Jeanne wiped George’s tears for him.

George nodded obediently.

Jeanne looked at George’s back and thought she finally understood why her mother had put away her hatred back then, married someone randomly, and had her grow up in an ordinary family.

It was really just because it was hard to deal with, just like how helpless George was toward her right now.

Her eyes flickered as she watched the door close silently.

As for Edward, she really did not hate him.

…

The next day, Edward left early in the morning with George, and Jeanne watched them leave.

George was wearing a black suit and a black bow tie, looking like a noble young master.

It made her think, ‘Was Edward the same back then? Did he grow up like this?

After they left, Jeanne and Teddy were alone at home again.

Teddy seemed a little awkward in front of Jeanne at that moment. After all, Edward and George could leave in their fancy clothes, while she could only be trapped in the house.

“Teddy,” Jeanne called out to Teddy, who was pretending to be busy.

“Madam,” Teddy said respectfully.

“Do you know how to bake a cake?”

“I do,” Teddy quickly replied.

“Teach me.”

“Huh?”

“It’s my birthday today.”

Teddy was visibly surprised.

“I want to make a cake for myself.”

“I’ll teach you immediately.” Teddy seemed very enthusiastic.

Jeanne smiled. She felt that since she was alive, she should live well.

With Teddy’s help, Jeanne was very serious about baking the cake.

The two of them were halfway done, and when Teddy was teaching her the next step, the room suddenly fell silent.

Jeanne frowned. Then, she looked up at Teddy and followed his gaze to see Alex and a familiar-looking woman beside Alex.

Jeanne’s throat moved slightly.

She stood up straight and said to them, “Edward is out. Shouldn’t he be attending the state banquet with you?”

“I’m looking for you,” Alex said bluntly.

Jeanne thought about it and agreed.

...

Alex’s time was very precious now, so there was no way he would do something that wasted his time.

She told Teddy to help her take off her apron before she walked toward Alex.

Then, she heard Alex say to Teddy, who was behind Jeanne, “I advise you not to call Edward.”

Teddy trembled in fear.

Jeanne turned around and saw that Teddy was indeed making a call. Hence, she said, “There’s no need, Teddy. Mr. Duncan won’t do anything here. You may leave.”

Teddy was still worried, but he nodded.

Once Teddy left, Jeanne walked up to Alex.

Alex looked at Jeanne and said bluntly, “Actually, I’ve always admired you. You’re very smart.”

Jeanne did not reply because she knew that such words were meaningless.

Alex, however, was not embarrassed by Jeanne’s silence. Instead, he changed the topic. “This is Susan, my sister.”

“Hello,” Jeanne greeted the woman politely and looked at the woman in a black dress.

...

It was obvious that the woman was dressed to attend a banquet.

At that moment, she seemed to have put on exquisite makeup. Compared to what Jeanne had seen on the news, the woman looked more elegant and beautiful.

“Hello.”

While Jeanne was sizing up Susan, the latter was also doing the same.

Both women had never seen each other before, but… although it was their first time meeting, they could already sense who the other party was — love rivals.

Sure enough, the next second, Alex said, “She’s also Edward’s fiancée.”

Jeanne’s eyes flickered.

“To the public, you’re already dead, so it’s normal for Edward to get married,” Alex explained.

“You mean, you want your bother to marry two wives?” Jeanne’s tone was sarcastic. “What a good brother.”
