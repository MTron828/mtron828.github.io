Chapter 200: Don’t Be Afraid, I’ll Always Be With You

At this moment, Jeanne was already taken to the defendant’s dock.

The contractor was also in the other dock.

All the staff members and lawyers were in place.

After the clerk gave a lecture on the discipline of the court, the judge walked out.

Everyone stood up.

Then, they sat.

The judge announced the official opening of the court.

Josiah Newton, the attorney for the prosecution, stood up and made a statement, “On September 18th, the Lawrence Enterprise and MUK, an international e-commerce company, discussed an e-commerce collaboration. On September 25th, the Lawrence Enterprise held a tender for the logistics warehouse of the e-commerce case and finally selected Tenda Planning and Construction Company. Construction started on September 27th and has been going on since then. On October 10th, the prosecutor’s office received an anonymous report that Jeanne, the person in charge of the e-commerce project and the marketing director of the Lawrences Enterprise, has secretly sought personal gains of up to 30 million dollars in the construction of the logistics warehouse. A dual contract and the specific details of the amount sought were provided. It violated the laws and regulations of Harken. Therefore, the public prosecution has initiated a prosecution.”

The judge nodded. “The prosecution is established. Please hand over the defendant’s proof of guilt to the trial bench.”

“Understood.” Josiah respectfully handed them over to a staff member.

The staff member handed it over to the trial bench.

Josiah continued, “Your Honor, please allow me to present the important witness of this case to the court.”

“Permission granted.”

The first person to appear in court was the informant, Adrian Zimmer.

Adrian stood in the position of the witness, looking a little nervous.

Jeanne looked at that man just like that.

She originally wanted to go over and meet the man in person, but because she had found a more crucial clue, she did not have any contact with him. Jeanne had not been at the Lawrence Enterprise for long, so she did not have a deep impression of him. At this moment, she could still look at him calmly.

Josiah walked toward Adrian. “Informant, you don’t need to be nervous. You just need to answer my questions truthfully.”

“Okay.” Adrian quickly nodded.

“May I ask how you discovered Jeanne’s crime?” Josiah asked.

“Well, I was fully in charge of the project’s construction work. One day, I went to check the construction progress on a routine basis. I suddenly realized that the construction materials brand on the construction site are somewhat different from what I remembered the construction company had told me. I quickly went back to check. There was indeed something fishy. I believed that there was something wrong with the construction company, Tenda, so I went to look for Tenda’s boss, Tenda Wadler. Tenda denied it repeatedly at first, but later, he couldn’t resist and admitted that he had indeed changed to another brand. He even advised me that the brand was different but the quality was similar. He made me turn a blind eye to it and said that he would give me benefits. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Of course, I rejected him outright and ordered him to immediately return to work and rebuild. However, the cost of rebuilding was too high. Tenda rejected me outright. The moment I expressed that I would take him to court, he had no choice but to tell me that the mastermind behind everything was Jeanne. He said that it was Jeanne who made him do it. He even threatened me not to interfere given Jeanne’s status in the Lawrences. Otherwise, I would lose my job! Of course, I wouldn’t listen to his nonsense. I never thought that this would have anything to do with Jeanne. Tenda saw that I didn’t believe him, so he secretly showed me the contract that he signed with Jeanne!”

Adrian’s words were smooth and fluid. It was as if he had memorized the script in advance.

The courtroom was very quiet.

It was as if they believed his explanation without a doubt.
