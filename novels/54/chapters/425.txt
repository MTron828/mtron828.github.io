Chapter 426: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

As she wiped, she was in a bad mood.

However, Monica suddenly thought of something and raised her head to look at Finn, whose face was as red as a tomato.

What was there to be shy about?

She had not done anything yet and had only just wiped his upper body. Did he need to be so... innocent?

He made her look like a pervert!

“What’s wrong?” Finn looked into Monica’s eyes and pretended to ask calmly.

Monica came back to her senses and quickly said, “Finn, if you can’t feel pain, can you do it in that aspect?”

Finn was speechless.

“Do you have a problem with that aspect?”

“I can feel just fine.”

“What about pleasure?” Monica asked.

He had not tried it, so he would not know.

“It can’t be that you can’t be pleasured like normal people, right?” Monica looked worried.

......

She wanted to give him “sexual pleasure”!

Finn did not answer.

“You really can’t?”

“You’ll know after you try it,” Finn blurted out.

“That’s true.” Monica was not one to get overly obsessed about something. Hence, she thought about it and reckoned that she had to try before she would know.

Besides, did he not have his darling lover?

The two of them would not have not done it, right?

Ow!

Her heart ached.

When she thought about how pure and innocent Finn looked, she was so annoyed by that pig, Patsy.

In the future, she had to squeeze Finn dry so that even if he wanted to, he would not be able to do anything.

With that thought in mind, Monica pulled off Finn’s pants.

She admitted that she was nervous too.

Suddenly, the ward fell silent. Neither of them spoke, and their breathing was heavy.

After a long time, Monica finally wiped Finn’s body clean.

By the time she was done, both of their faces were red.

Monica did not expect that such a thing would be so awkward that she did not know what to say.

It was clear that they would do a lot of those things in the future.

Fortunately, the nurse knocked on the door at that moment and said, “Mrs. Jones, Dr. Jones’s lunch is here.”

“Bring it in,” Monica replied.

The nurse was carrying a tray.

On it was a bowl of nutritious soup. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Is this what Finn eats?”

“The doctor said it’s best for him to eat liquid food now. Moreover, his body is too weak to digest a bigger meal, so he has to take it slow. Today, we have started adding minced meat into his diet. Eventually, he’ll be able to have bigger cuts of meat and seafood,” the nurse explained.

“Oh, alright.” Monica could only listen to the doctor.

She took the bowl of soup from the nurse’s hand.

Then, the nurse went to help Finn to sit up.

“Open up.” Monica scooped a spoonful of soup and placed it beside Finn’s mouth.

“Wait a moment.” The nurse quickly reminded her, “The bowl is insulated, so the porridge is still very hot.”

“Oh.” Monica quickly placed the spoon beside her mouth and blew on it.

After blowing on it for a while, she used her tongue to lick it as she did not know if it had cooled down.

Once she was certain, she put the spoon next to Finn’s lips again. “Ah...”

Finn opened his mouth and ate it.

The nurse at the side chuckled softly.

Dr. Jones had a serious obsession with cleanliness, but he did not mind Mrs. Jones at all.

Usually, when she fed Dr. Jones soup, she would cool it down naturally before feeding it to him. She could not cool it down by blowing on it, let alone use her tongue to check the temperature.

With that, the nurse left so as to not disturb them.

In the ward, only Monica and Finn were left.

Monica was feeling Finn very seriously, and Finn also drank the soup that Monica cooled down for him one mouthful at a time.

When Finn was halfway through the soup, Monica suddenly sighed.

Finn looked at her.

Was she tired?

Monica seemed to have never served anyone like that before.

“I really want to eat too,” Monica said.

It seemed that Monica was never on the same page as everyone.

“Why does the bland soup look so good when it’s in your mouth?” Monica asked Finn.

Finn pursed his lips. “If you want it, you can get the nurse to make another bowl for you.”

“I want yours,” Monica said eagerly as she put the spoon next to Finn’s mouth.

Finn was speechless.

Monica never played by the rules anyway.

He said, “You can eat it if you want.”

He would get the nurse to make him another serving later.

“Really?” Monica’s eyes sparkled.

Finn nodded and still ate the spoon of soup that Monica had put next to his mouth.

The moment he ate it, her soft lips landed on his.

He was stunned for a long time, and when Monica’s lips left his lips, there was a bright smile on her face.

Finn looked at Monica with his face flushed red. He was exasperated. “Can’t you be more reserved?”

“I asked you just now, didn’t I?” Monica looked a little upset.

Finn frowned.

“How am I not reserved? You were the one who said I could have it,” Monica defended herself.

He only promised her that she could eat the portion in his bowl and not from his mouth.

However, on second thought, she seemed to be right. It was only in his mouth that it was delicious.

As Finn’s face turned redder, Monica’s smile became even brighter.

She looked at Finn and said with a nostalgic expression, “As expected, it tastes amazing.”
