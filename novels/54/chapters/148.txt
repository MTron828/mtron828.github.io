Chapter 149: Monica, Finn, and Micheal’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Micheal’s true feelings for Monica were not from that time.

He always felt that his heart rate increased because the roller coaster was too intense.

Therefore, he and Monica only remained friends for a long period of time. They did not have any interactions, and there were no changes in their feelings.

Until..

He was studying official affairs with his father while attending the University of Civil Affairs. He was actually very busy and had no time to think about other things.

One day, he accompanied his father while they were getting off work.

It was already midnight. There were almost no pedestrians on the streets, and there were very few cars.

He sat in the back seat of the car in fatigue and looked at the night sky of South Hampton City.

Usually, there would be a lot of night lights flashing at this time, but tonight seemed to be much darker than usual.

He watched silently. Then, he suddenly saw a familiar face appear on the largest promotional electronic screen in South Hampton city. Seeing her bright smile and her face full of joy, she said, “Finn, Happy Birthday to you!”

Finn...

Who could he be?

Monica had rented all the electronic screens in South Hampton city from 0 a.m. to 24 a.m., exactly an entire day.

That was why Monica was famous.

The man named Finn also became famous.

Micheal was someone who never cared about gossip, and that was the first time he typed the words “Finn” on the internet.

Looking at that man’s resume, looking at all the information about that man…

Micheal finally admitted that he had feelings for Monica.

Otherwise, he would not have wasted his time finding out about another man Monica liked so much.

However…

He still decided to endure it.

After all...

He and Monica would not have a future.

As a human, there would always be times when he could not control himself and act on impulse.

It was a gathering of university alumni.

He was drinking with a group of classmates at the bar when he saw Monica sitting in front of the bar counter, crying.

He looked at her for a long time.

Looking at her slender body that was breaking down.

In the end, he got up and walked toward her.

Monica was also a little surprised to see him.

He took the initiative to order a glass of wine and sat beside Monica. “Did the sky fall on you today?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Finn cheated,” Monica said.

When she said it out loud, her tears flowed like a torrent.

It was even more painful than the sky falling.

When Micheal heard those words, his heart was filled with joy.

He was next to Monica through the night.

Monica actually asked him to ignore him several times, but he did not leave.

He stayed with her the whole night.

He did not leave with her until the bar closed in the morning.

He then sent her back.

Monica was probably tired from crying, so she did not refuse.

The car arrived at the door of Monica’s villa.

From afar, he saw a man standing there.

The impulse in his heart grew stronger and stronger.

Therefore, the moment Monica got out of the car, he hugged her in his arms.

Monica was shocked.

At that moment, she looked straight at him.

“Monica, would you believe it if I say that I like you?” Micheal said.

Monica seemed to be even more frightened.

“I have liked you for many years.” He enunciated each word.

He actually confessed.

He thought that he would never say something like that in his life.

Monica seemed to be unable to react in time.

He saw Finn approaching them from the corner of his eye, and even saw Finn’s eyes turn red.

He leaned close to Monica’s ear and whispered, “Do you know? The best way to give up a relationship is to start another one.”

“Micheal...”

“Finn is behind you. If you don’t want to be hurt by him again, you have to acquiesce to my actions.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he…

Monica did not actually have time to react. She felt Micheal’s kiss on her lips.

From her surprised expression, it was obvious that she was rejecting him.

However, in the next second, she gave in.

Perhaps she had really experienced something too heart-wrenching, which was why she chose this way to break up with Finn.

Micheal kissed her and saw Finn standing behind them in a daze.

Micheal even saw that the man was clenching his fists, his eyes were red, and then... a tear fell.

A man could actually cry like that for a woman.

Perhaps he was deeply in love.

Perhaps there was a misunderstanding between them.

Perhaps..

However, Micheal did not care.

He was cruel enough to break them up.

He knew that Finn was an orphan, and he also knew that an orphan lacked security.
