886 While the Wedding Was Going On

Monica took the next elevator to Michael’s house.

She had the password to his house.

At this moment, her hand that was pressing the combination lock was trembling.

The door lock opened gently.

Monica walked in.

When she walked in, she heard an abnormal flirtatious sound.

The drug should have completely taken effect.

Monica did not dare to get too close to the bedroom. From afar, she saw the two people in the room rolling together. Michael was very impatient.

Brie did not refuse at all and even cooperated actively.

Monica trembled as she faced the room and recorded a video.

Jeannie said that tonight was the most suitable night to do such a thing.

Firstly, the wedding was tomorrow. When Michael woke up, he would not have time to think about how to make up for this matter. He would only want to hold the wedding first and resolve it later. Therefore, he would not think of any way to deal with it. If it was exposed at the wedding, Michael would have no choice but to cancel it.

Secondly, Brie definitely liked Michael. Michael was getting married tomorrow. No matter how rational a woman was, she would still be controlled by her emotions. Therefore, as long as Michael took the initiative, she would definitely not resist.

Evidently, Jeanne had predicted everything.

Everything that happened tonight was arranged by Jeanne. It was as if she had known in advance and everything was going according to her prediction.

Monica filmed for a long time.

The two people in the room were very engrossed.

Michael’s body was now full of medicinal properties, so he could not pay attention to anything else. His body was just instinctively venting the effect.

Brie was too focused on Michael to notice that there was someone else in the room besides them.

Everything had happened.

Monica put down her phone and left quietly.

After leaving Michael’s home, she gently closed the door for them.

She stepped into the elevator.

Actually, she was not as indifferent as she thought.

It was not that she really had feelings for Michael.

Michael was not sad that Michael and Brie slept together. When she saw Finn and Patsy together in the past, even when they did not do anything, it was enough to break her heart. Now, her emotions were fluctuating only because she felt that she had schemed against Michael. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

She felt a little guilty.

Even though Jeannie had been emphasizing that she was just being on her guard, she still felt guilty for doing something bad.

Monica returned home.

She sent the video to Jeanne.

Jeanne knew that Monica was not stupid.

It was clearly not an easy task, but as long as she did it seriously, she still succeeded.

Jeanne gave Monica a call. “Hold the wedding with Michael tomorrow as if nothing happened. I’ll find a way to help you play the video and the recording live.”

“Who are you going to ask to play them?” Monica was still a little surprised.

Since it was Michael’s wedding, everyone present should have been screened by Michael, so it should be very difficult to bribe them.

If Jeanne failed to bribe anyone and Michael found out in advance, it would be over.

“I’ll find someone more powerful than Michael,” Jeanne answered but still did not tell Monica who it was.

Monica was even more curious.

“In short, you’ll proceed with the wedding tomorrow. Don’t think about anything else. Leave the rest to me.”

“You’re not even in South Hampton City.” Monica was still a little angry.

Although Jeanne had been helping her plan, she just could not be by her side.

“I…” Jeanne thought to herself, ‘I’ll be back.

‘But…

‘We might not have the chance to meet.’

Jeanne finished her sentence. “I’ll definitely be there the next time you’re officially married.”

If she was still alive, she would participate in the wedding even if she had to risk her life.

Monica could not help but laugh. “There won’t be a next time. These are the only times in my life, and both times, I was so wronged.”

Speaking of which, Monica was still a little unhappy.

Jeanne smiled as well. “What if there’s a next time?”

“Then I’ll count on your blessings.” Monica did not say much.

If there was a next time, she would fall in love with another man.

Otherwise, she would not dare to enter a marriage hall again.

Monica was scared.

She was really scared.

Monica and Jeanne chatted for a while more before hanging up.

After hanging up the phone, Monica lay on the bed, unable to fall asleep.

Thinking of tomorrow’s wedding…

All the major news outlets would be reporting the news of their wedding tomorrow. Everyone would see it, including Finn.

A tear flowed down from the corner of her eye.

Every time she thought of Finn, she still felt uncomfortable.
