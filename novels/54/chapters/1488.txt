Chapter 1489: Edward Has Been Giving You Birth Control Pills!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When George saw Monica and Candice come in, he quickly put away his diary, and the redness in his eyes instantly disappeared.

“Are you thinking of your mother again?” Monica teased.

She used a casual tone that did not sound like she was provoking or mocking him, so it would not expose George’s weakness and embarrass him.

He said, “No.”

In an instant, he returned to that cold and aloof George.

Monica did not expose him. Instead, she changed the topic. “How’s the injury on your leg? Has it recovered?”

“It’s recovered,” George replied.

“Why are you still in a wheelchair?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“I’m lazy.”

Monica looked at George speechlessly. “I give full marks for that answer.” “I heard you’re pregnant.” George looked at Monica.

“Yes, I am, with twins. Aren’t I impressive?” Monica pointed at her flat belly, clearly a little smug.

She had probably forgotten that, a long time ago, when she first found out that she was pregnant, she was so devastated that she wanted to cry.

“Impressive.” George nodded meekly for once.

“By the way, do you want a younger brother or sister?” Monica asked.

Candice seemed to have just snapped out of her daze from their conversation. Many scenes were playing in her mind, which was filled with images of that notebook.

She kept staring at the drawer where George put the notebook. It was as if there was magic in it that kept her in a daze for a long time. Only now did she manage to pull herself back to reality.

“You’re already pregnant, and you’re asking me if I want siblings? If I say I don’t want them, won’t you be furious?” George replied seriously.

Monica was speechless. That brat just refused to go along with her sometimes, and she wondered how much the woman would despise him if he were to fall in love in the future.

In fact, she was not asking George whether he wanted younger siblings from her but from Candice instead. At that moment, Candice was actually looking forward to George’s answer.

There was no need to ask Paige because she kept asking for a sister every day.

However, what about George? Would he accept having another child at home? Or could it be that George could not accept it because it was not Qiao Qing’s child? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Aren’t you going to marry Uncle Finn?” asked George.

“Who said I’ll have to marry him?”

“Aren’t you pregnant with his children?”

“Who said I have to get married just because I’m pregnant with his child?” “In that case, why are you carrying his child and not someone else’s?”

“Why do you care so much?” Monica was a little speechless at how the brat was meddling in her affairs.

“It’s nothing. I was just afraid that no one would want you with the two babies.”

“What do you think of me as? As long as I say I’m looking for a man, all men in South Hampton City will be fighting each other to be my babies’ dad,” Monica said proudly.

George did not believe it.

“I just took a break from my busy schedule to see how you’re recovering.” Monica said, “I’ll get going now.”

George nodded.

No matter how much he could not bear to part with her, he would not show it on his face. He would not force others to do anything for him either.

He had always been very independent. He did not know if he was born this way, or… he forced himself to become like that. “Be good and get some good rest.”

“Yeah.”

When Monica left George’s room, Candice followed suit and sent Monica out. After she watched Monica leave in the car, she stood there in a daze.

For some reason, she felt that everything around her was becoming increasingly familiar — all the scenes looked more and more familiar. However, why did she feel that way?

“Madam.” Teddy’s voice suddenly sounded from behind.

Candice turned around.

“Madam, Paige has been complaining about a stomachache,” Teddy said anxiously.

Candice quickly ran back to the hall.

In the hall, Chloe, as well as the tutor and the nanny who were at home, surrounded Paige.

“It hurts. My stomach hurts so much. It’s so uncomfortable…” Paige cried out. Her little face was scrunched up in pain.

Candice hurried over. “Paige.”

“Mom, my stomach hurts.” When Paige saw Candice, she reached out for Candice to carry her.

Candice did not hug Paige immediately. Instead, she touched Paige’s stomach. “Here?”

“No.” Paige shook her head. “It’s here.”

Her chubby little hands touched the place where her stomach hurt.

“Here?” Candice pressed down..
