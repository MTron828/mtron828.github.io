Chapter 526: Finn, Let’s Get A Divorce

“Mrs. Ross, may I ask how Minister Ross is doing now? Is he dead or alive? Can you give us a clear answer?”

“Mrs. Ross...”

“Enough!” Reese’s voice was loud. “That’s our family’s business. What does it have to do with you? Get lost!”

However, the reporter did not back down.

“Mr. Ross, I heard what’s happening between you and Monica is not your fault. It’s because Monica keeps seducing you and, in turn, causes you to lose control of yourself. That is why you and she are having an affair. As long as you give us the word, we’ll make sure to write the truth.” The reporter was baiting Michael to speak ill of Monica.

“Mr. Ross, I also heard you received a good education since you were young and would never do such a thing. I heard Monica has always liked to play. Although she was born into a rich and powerful family, she doesn’t behave like one. Apparently, many rich and powerful young ladies in the upper class avoid her, saying that she’s indecent and often frequented nightclubs–”

“Mr. Ross, tell us what happened. We know what to write,” the reporter kept interrogating Michael and smearing Monica’s name.

Monica gritted her teeth.

Although what the reporter said made her angry, if she could help Michael, her reputation was not important.

While she was thinking about that, she suddenly saw Michael get angry.

He suddenly pushed Reese, who was blocking his way, aside and went forward to grab the reporter who had just accused Monica of being indecent. Then, he gave the reporter a vicious punch, beating the latter to the ground.

The other reporters were shocked.

Furious, Michael said to the reporter, “If you say one more word about Monica’s indiscretions, I’ll kill you!”

Monica felt a pain in her heart.

At a time like that, Michael should have gone along with what the reporter said and pointed all the blame at her. After all, that was the best way to repair his reputation, yet he was still protecting her.

It took some time for the reporter to get up from the ground.

He was also quite angry when he got up. He said to Michael, “That means you and Monica are together and that both of you have no moral principles. I originally planned to write a good piece of news for you so that you can rebuild your image and win back the votes! However, it seems that you and Monica, who are secretly having an affair, do not deserve sympathy at all.”

“Say that again!” Michael’s eyes were bloodshot as he glared at the reporter.

Reese, who was at the side, was so frightened that she kept trying to persuade Michael. “Stop. I beg you. Don’t say anything more!”

The reporter was not threatened, so he said fiercely, “You and Monica have received upper-class education, yet you both can do such immoral and despicable things. You and Monica are the sc*ms of this world, the most disgusting existence in this world...”

Michael raised his fist and was about to punch the reporter again.

However, Monica could not take it anymore. If it went on, Michael would end up destroying himself.

With that, she pushed Finn away.

Finn’s eyes narrowed as he grabbed Monica, who turned back to look at him.

Finn’s expression was stern. “Don’t go over.”

Monica gritted her teeth.

“Don’t go over!” Finn’s expression was cold.

Nevertheless, Monica pushed Finn away and said, “I can’t be that cold-hearted.”

“Monica, if you compromise once, you’ll do it again!”

“I’ll come back.”

“You won’t.” Finn made sure to enunciate each word.

“I will,” Monica said.

After that, she leaned on her crutches, rushed over unsteadily, and stood in front of Michael to protect him.

Michael’s fist paused in mid-air.

Only then did the reporters notice Monica.

Finn watched as Monica got closer to Michael in the end and protected Michael. His expression was cold.

She said to the reporter, “Don’t slander Michael. Michael isn’t as you said. Unlike your reports, Michael and I are–”

Monica tried to explain to the reporters about her relationship with Michael. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, at that moment, Reese suddenly said to all the reporters, “Yes, Monica is together with Michael.”

Monica paused for a moment.

Reese said, “They’ve been together for a long time. It’s just that they haven’t made it public. Moreover, Monica and Finn have been divorced for a long time now, and to begin with, it was just a marriage of convenience. If it weren’t for Michael’s father and me disagreeing with their relationship back then, Michael and Monica would have gotten married a long time ago. Now, Michael and Monica are back together because they’ve always had feelings for each other. As for Monica and Finn, they got a divorce a year ago before Michael returned to the country and didn’t announce it because they didn’t want to make it public. Now, Michael and Monica are together legitimately, so it’s nothing like what you reporters wrote!”
