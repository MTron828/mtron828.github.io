929 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

“That’s because the chairman has been working overtime for a long time.” Steve said, “When we launched our new product, Sunny Pharmaceuticals also launched new affordable drugs at the same time. It’s basically the same as our company’s. It was even launched on the market a week ago and received the favor of many hospitals. The chairman spent a lot of time on this matter and has been working more than 12 hours a day to discuss the launch of the new drug with us. This has been going on for many days. Today, just as we were about to decide on the final plan, we were shocked to learn that he fainted. At first, I thought it was caused by overwork, but I didn’t expect it to be so serious…”

Monica bit her lip.

She did not expect her father’s condition to suddenly become so serious.

Her father had not pushed himself for many years, but every time he was at work, he was still more nervous than anyone else.

Suddenly, she felt that she had cared too little for her father.

He was not young anymore, and his body could not support his high-pressure work environment and long work hours, but she had never thought of sharing her father’s burden.

As long as her father was well, she would definitely try her hardest with working in the company.

“Uncle Warren, you don’t have to stay. The company is definitely in need of people now that my dad is down. Also, be careful not to tire yourself out.” Monica quickly said.

Steve looked around the ward and could only nod. “Okay. While the chairman is in a coma, I’ll try my best to help the chairman take care of the company. But if the chairman doesn’t wake up, the release of our new product will be delayed.”

“It’s fine. My dad’s health is more important right now. We just have to run the company accordingly. We’ll talk about it when my dad wakes up.”

“Alright.” Steve nodded.

With that, he left the ward.

Monica and Sarah waited at the door for a long time.

Monica said to Sarah, “Go to Finn’s office and ask how serious my father’s condition is. I’m worried he didn’t tell my mom the worst-case scenario for fear that she won’t be able to accept it.”

“Alright,” Sarah quickly agreed.

Monica looked at Sarah’s back and felt an inexplicable bitterness in her heart.

She had never thought that one day, she and Finn would be so far apart, so much that she had someone else to pass on the message.

Monica was sitting alone outside the ward, not knowing what would happen to her father in the end.

She was really scared, but she did not dare to show it as she was afraid that her mother would be even more afraid. Yet now…

She really could not control her emotions.

At the thought that her father might be bedridden for a long time, there was a hint of craziness in her eyes.

She had always thought that she was very lucky.

When did that luck start to drift away from her? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After a while, Sarah and Finn appeared at the entrance of the ward. Finn had already changed out of his surgical gown and put on his clean white coat.

Monica wiped her tears and stood up from the chair by the door.

She looked at Finn respectfully and was very afraid of offending him.

Finn glanced at Monica and said bluntly, “I’ve told you about uncle’s worst-case scenario. Right now, his life is not in danger.”

He was probably answering the questions she asked Sarah to ask.

“Alright,” Monica responded.

After that, Finn pushed open the door of the ward, only to see Ruby lying beside Gary and her eyes swollen from crying.

Monica’s heart ached.

However, she did not know how to comfort her mother.

Finn walked over and checked Gary’s condition.

Slowly, he said, “There’s still no sign of him waking up, but don’t give up. We still have one more night.”

He was comforting Ruby, who nodded mechanically.

However, at that moment, she was really disheartened. She really felt like Gary was going to sleep for the rest of his life.

“Monica can give it a try too.” Finn said, “Daughters can also have a certain effect.”

Finn told her what to do without looking at her.

“Yes.” Monica hurriedly nodded.

“I’ll be on duty in the office today, so if you need anything, you can press the call button to look for me. This button will allow you to talk to me directly,” Finn explained.

As it was a special VIP ward, the equipment was almost the same as the intensive care unit, but the facilities inside were more complete.
