1390 Birthday Surprise

After all, she had not taken any precautions for the past month, and she should be on her period in the next two days. If it did not come…

Candice’s heart was racing. Although she had never mentioned to Edward whether they wanted to have more children, she was still a little worried.

In Candice’s heart, she had tacitly agreed that she would conceive. Besides, Paige was clamoring for a younger sister every day, and Edward did not refute it. Moreover, she really wanted to give Paige a sister.

Candice thought about some things and fell asleep for a while. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Usually, Paige would wake her up. The first thing Paige did when she woke up was to run to her room, crawl into her bed, and wake her up with a kiss.

In fact, she would wake up every time Paige came, and because she did not want to disappoint the little girl, she played the same game with Paige every day.

They would play in bed for a while before getting up together. Then, like a little tail, Paige would follow closely behind Candice.

When she carried Paige to eat breakfast that day, Teddy seemed to have something to say but hesitated.

“Teddy, what’s wrong?” Candice could tell at a glance.

Teddy endured it. “George’s birthday is soon.”

Candice was stunned.

“His tenth birthday,” Teddy said.

They had always said that George was ten years old, but it turned out that he was only about to turn ten.

“Are you planning a birthday party for George?” Candice asked Teddy.

“I wish. But ever since George’s mother passed away, George has stopped celebrating his birthday.”

“Is that so?” Candice’s heart ached for George.

“And every year, George will leave South Hampton City during his birthday,” Teddy said.

“Where would he go?” Candice was surprised.

Could it be that George wanted to be alone on his birthday?

“You can ask Fourth Master.” Teddy did not dare to reveal it.

“When’s George’s birthday?”

“This Saturday.” Teddy said, “In three days.”

“Let’s plan a birthday surprise for George.” Candice made a prompt decision.

When Paige heard about the birthday surprise, she was so excited that she agreed immediately. “I want to prepare a birthday gift for my brother.”

“I’m afraid George will refuse.” Teddy was a little troubled. “But I also want to celebrate his birthday with him. After all, he’s turning ten this year.”

“Just because he refuses doesn’t mean that we’ll back down! ” Candice was determined. “He has rejected me this entire time. Do you see me giving up?!”

Teddy was amused by Candice.

After spending a month together, Teddy and Candice were much more familiar with each other. Moreover, Teddy found Candice more favorable the more they interacted.

At first, he also thought that everything Candice did was to please Fourth Master. However, after interacting with her for a while, he realized that Candice treated George and Paige very well.

On top of that, he also seemed to feel a sense of familiarity toward Candice.

“To George, apart from Edward, Paige, and you, does he have anyone else important in his life?” Candice believed that since it was his birthday, the more the merrier.

Teddy came back to his senses and quickly replied, “He has a good relationship with his godmother, Monica.”

Upon hearing Monica’s name, Candice could not help but smile. It was an existence that warmed her heart.

With that, she made a prompt decision. “In that case, let’s invite Monica.”

“You can also invite Young Master Winter and Dr. Jones.” Teddy suggested, “George doesn’t dislike them, and they’re Fourth Master’s best friends.”

“Alright.” Candice agreed immediately, but then she thought of something. “The rest of the Swans don’t have a good relationship with George?”

“Not really,” Teddy said bluntly, “because George’s mother and the others from the Swans…”

Teddy suddenly stopped because he had mentioned George’s mother.

Candice did not care much about those things, so she took the initiative to ask, “What kind of person was George’s mother?”

Teddy looked at her.

“I just want to know more so that I can get to know George better.” Candice said, “To me, Jeanne is a thing of the past. After all, she’s already gone. Even if I’m jealous of someone, I won’t be jealous of her.”

When Teddy heard Candice, he said, “She was a very powerful person.”

“Powerful?”

“Yes, powerful.” Teddy nodded. “She and Fourth Maser were evenly matched. When two of them were together, neither of them overshadowed the other.”
