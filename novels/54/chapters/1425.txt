Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thank you readers!

When Candice returned to the room, Edward was already up and had gotten changed. Hence, she walked up to him naturally, took the tie from him, and helped him tie it seriously.

Edward just looked at her with his gentle gaze, seemingly enjoying the way Candice cared for him.

“Edward.” Candice asked as she tied his tie, “When did you fall in love with me?” Edward was stunned.

He panicked a little, but he instantly returned to normal. He said, “How did you find out that I like you?”

Candice was speechless. She was not so stupid as to not realize his love for her.

“I started to like you when you liked me. The feelings are mutual.” He did not answer the question directly.

Once Edward was ready, he went downstairs.

Candice, on the other hand, would usually lie in bed for a while and wait for

Paige to wake her up. Hence, she stared at the ceiling in a daze, wondering how Edward fell for her, and his feelings for her were very intense.

Her eyes shifted slightly to look at the box of medicine that she had casually placed on the bedside table last night and reached out to take one. The moment she put the pill into her mouth out of habit, she suddenly paused.

She had been taking that medicine ever since she woke up from the coma.

The doctor said that it would be helpful for her recc huge accident and sleeping for so many years, man not fully recovered. Therefore, he prescribed nutrit to calcium tablets and vitamins for her to take every day.

She did take it every day, and it had become a habit. However, she suddenly hesitated today.

As she put the pill back into the bottle, it struck her that she did not know whether that medicine would affect her pregnancy.

She and Edward had been so intimate recently and did not take any precautions. Perhaps… she was pregnant.

Moreover, her body was basically fine now, and she probably did not need to take it every day. With that thought in mind, Candice placed the pills into the bedside cabinet.

When Edward appeared downstairs, George was still eating the pancakes. The latter simply glanced at Edward before continuing to eat his breakfast seriously.

Edward sat across from George as father and son.

After Teddy served Edward breakfast, Edward ate slowly.

“Is it delicious?” Edward suddenly asked.

His question was directed at George.

George looked up at Edward and did not answer.

Edward seemed to smile. “I don’t even get this kind of treatment.”

George knew what he was talking about. However, he pursed his lips and continued eating his pancakes.

After finishing his plate of pancakes, George wiped the corners of his mouth and said politely, “I’m full. Enjoy your breakfast.”

Edward nodded.

The moment George left the dining table, he asked, “Dad, when can I go to the base for training?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Edward looked up. ‘You want to go?”

“I was supposed to be there today.”

Edward seemed to hesitate for a moment before saying, “You can go today. I’ll arrange it for you.”

“Alright.” George agreed.

“George,” Edward called out to him.

“Hmm?”

“Happy birthday,” Edward suddenly said.

At that moment, George was visibly a little surprised, and he looked at Edward.

“I didn’t have the time to tell you last night.” Edward smiled.

George thought that he would be reprimanded today. Even though others did not dare to say anything, his father would. Yet unexpectedly, all his father said was “Happy Birthday”.

George got a little emotional, but he could quickly calm himself down. He said, “Have you forgotten my mother?”

Now that Edward had such a good relationship with Candice, did that mean he had forgotten about Jeanne?

George did not blame his father because his godmother was right. His father could not be alone for the rest of his life. If it was not Candice, it would be another woman.

One day, his father would forget his mother completely.

“I’ve never forgotten about her.” Edward enunciated each word.

George looked surprised.

He and Candice had such a good relationship.

“She has always been by our side,” Edward said.

George, however, could not understand what he meant.

“Go back to your room and get ready. I’ll get someone to send you to the base.” “Yes.” George nodded obediently.

He and his father alwavs said what was onlv necessarv. His father would not say much, and George would not ask too much.

By the time Candice and Paige woke up, Edward and George had left.

Teddy brought her and Paige’s breakfast to them.

Every morning, ever since she married into the family, there would never fail to be a portion of omelet and toast that was specially prepared for her. Apparently, Edward had instructed Teddy personally to cook that.

She assumed it was Jeanne’s favorite, and of course, she did not refuse. There was nothing wrong with a good breakfast.

No matter what, Edward was still the leader of the country. As his wife, she had to maintain her image.

“George went to the base this morning,” Teddy reported.

Candice was stunned.

Teddy said, “George asked for it himself.”

“Oh,” Candice responded, but she sounded a little disappointed. She said, “Based on your understanding of George, do you think he hates what I did for him last night?”

“Yes.” Teddy did not hide anything.

Candice sighed. She knew she should not have crossed George’s boundaries.

“But it doesn’t matter.” Teddy smiled. “At least it has given him a new understanding of you.”

“You don’t know what’s good for you, do you?” Candice felt helpless at Teddy’s answer.

“It’s not that.” Teddy said, “He knew you made breakfast today, but he still finished it.”

Candice was a little surprised.

“George is cold on the outside but warm on the inside,” Teddy added.

Candice nodded silently.

She did not know why, but she felt inexplicably good to be able to get a little bit of recognition from that little brat George.

When Monica returned to South Hampton City a week later, the first thing she did when she came back was to go to the hospital because her morning sickness had been terrible.

That was right. She was indeed pregnant. On the night she left South Hampton City, she could not help but take a pregnancy test after returning from Bamboo Garden.

She had to know the result. If she was really pregnant, she should be more careful when she was away on a business trip.

It was not that she had decided to keep the child, but she just did not want her body to suffer unnecessary harm. However, when she saw the two lines on the pregnancy test, she was shocked.

Were the heavens playing a joke on her? She had broken up with Finn, and they did not take any precautions once only.

How could it be such a coincidence that she was really pregnant?
