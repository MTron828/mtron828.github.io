927 Out of Danger, Cardellini Enterprise’s Emergency

Outside the operating room, Ruby, Monica, Sarah, as well as his father’s assistant, who had come with the ambulance, were all waiting nervously. The corridor was silent. It was as if anyone who made a sound would disturb the operation inside. The atmosphere was so suppressed that no one even dared to breathe too loudly.

Monica turned to look at her mother. Ruby, who had always been strong in front of her, was now crying silently. She used to think that her father loved her mother more, but she knew now that the feelings had always been mutual. How far could a person’s love go?

She reached out and held her mother’s hand tightly in her palm. Ruby looked at Monica with teary eyes and leaned her on her shoulder. It was true. She really needed someone to rely on. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She was afraid that something would happen during the surgery. The operation took a long time. So long that the people waiting outside began to feel uneasy. They were also telling themselves not to be impulsive. As long as the operation was still in progress, Gary would at least still be alive.

Finally, after a long wait, the light in the operating room went out. Ruby’s body trembled at the sight. She looked forward to the end of the surgery but was also afraid that it meant bad news. Monica knew this feeling well. She was also frightened. Her body was stiff. She was afraid...

No. He would not.

Her father would be fine.

The door of the operating room opened, and Finn walked out. Sarah and Gary’s assistant hurried over while Ruby and Monica sat there motionlessly as if they had been petrified. All Monica did was stare at Finn.

Sarah grabbed Finn’s hand and asked excitedly, “Finn, is my uncle alright? How is he?”

Finn pushed Sarah’s hand away. However, it was not like how he treated Monica just now. As if he had been contaminated by something unclean, and his rejection very obvious. He was much gentler towards Sarah.

Ruby looked at Finn as he walked to her, clearly frightened. Her eyes were red, and her body was trembling. “Gary…”

“Auntie,” Finn said. “Uncle’s life is not in danger for the time being.”

Ruby cried even harder. She was moved to tears by the news.

“However…” Finn suddenly paused, and everyone’s mood tensed up again.

“Uncle is not showing any signs of waking up. His heart disease caused atrial fibrillation. The thrombosis in his heart caused complications, and the shedding of it circulated to the brain, causing cerebral thrombosis. He just underwent emergency treatment during the operation, and his life isn’t in danger for the time being. However, if he continues to stay unconscious, there can only be two outcomes,” Finn said. “One, he becomes a vegetable. Second, if he wakes up, the lower half of his body will be paralyzed.”

Ruby’s tears fell crazily, and Monica’s heart broke down when she heard this.

Sarah was also crying her eyes out. “T-then, what do we do?”

“We’ll send uncle back to his ward first. Then, Auntie and Monica will try to wake him up, “Finn said. “If he wakes up today, the probability that his body will be able to recover from this will be high, and the above results may be avoided. However, if he does not wake up today, it’ll be hard to predict what will happen.”

“How could this be…?” Ruby murmured. Even Gary’s first heart attack was not this serious. He managed to survive the first time. How could it be?

At this moment, Gary was pushed out of the operating room. Ruby hurried over, excited and sad at the same time. However, as soon as she got up, she fell back unsteadily. Monica hurriedly went to support her, as did Finn.

Then, Monica’s hand accidentally touched Finn’s hand, but she was quick to let go. She was afraid of touching any part of his body. Monica did not want to cause any conflict with Finn, nor dare to even offend him. Her entire family’s hope was on him now. The hope that Finn could save her father.

Finn did not seem to notice Monica’s reaction. He revealed no expression and said, “Auntie, your health is the most important right now. If you collapse, it will be really difficult for uncle to wake up.”
