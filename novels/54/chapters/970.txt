971 How Should She Repay Jeannie?

Why should he help her, that cruel woman?

“Because I can’t think of a person more suitable to do this than you,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“That’s your business. What does it have to do with me?” Nox remained unmoved. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jeanne seemed to be silent for a few seconds before she said, “If you really can’t, forget it.”

With that, Jeanne was about to hang up the phone.

If Nox could not do it, she would look for Edward.

In fact, it was not that she could not look for him. It was just a little awkward, and she did not know how to face him.

“Is this how you ask for help?” Nox was a little unhappy.

Jeanne tightened her grip on her phone.

“You should at least be begging for help.”

Jeanne smiled.

Nox had a sharp tongue but a soft heart, which was a character trait similar to Monica’s.

She even felt that Nox might be more suitable for Monica than Finn. If the two of them were together and there was a conflict, they would just have a fight at most.

Nox would not be like Finn, who would use cold violence to solve all his problems.

“I’m begging you, Nox.” Jeanne’s voice was lowered, and she sounded very sincere.

“It’s useless even if you beg me.” Nox acted like he was her boss.

Jeanne was speechless, and she really wanted to strangle Nox at that moment. To think that she wanted to matchmake Monica with him!

“Actually, it’s useless even if you don’t beg me,” Nox said, “because I will help you anyway.”

Jeanne was stunned. What was Nox talking about?

“Edward has told me to follow your orders.” Nox was still a little unwilling.

Jeanne suddenly remembered that Edward had once told her that both Finn and Nox would obey her.

At that time, she was a little touched, but she did not take it to heart.

At that thought, she realized that both Finn and Nox had both agreed to help her.

“Are you touched?” Nox raised his brows.

Jeanne returned to her senses. “Thank you.”

“What a cold-blooded woman.” Nox complained and said angrily, “I’m telling you, Jeanne. If you treat Edward badly, you will be punished by the Gods!”

She knew that, but she could not guarantee it.

…

After Nox hung up, he quickly settled the matter that Jeanne instructed him to do. Then, he gave Edward a call.

“Edward, do you know that your wife has returned to South Hampton City?”

Yan Xun narrowed his eyes and thought, ‘Great!’

She had informed everyone that she was back but not him!

…

Jeanne hailed a cab and left the crematorium.

Just as she got into the cab, she received a reply from Finn saying that the forensic pathologist had confirmed he could set off immediately.

With that, Jeanne sent the address to Finn and headed there herself.

In fact, the destination was not anywhere else but the Lawrence family’s villa.

Ever since Joshua was caught, Jenifer was also sent to prison for intentionally framing and instigating others to commit crimes. The two of them were sentenced to 20 years in prison and 8 years in prison respectively. After the two of them were sentenced, Jasmine disappeared from South Hampton City. Rumor had it that Jasmine had taken all the money in Jenifer and Joshua’s accounts and left Harken to live abroad.

That was undoubtedly the best choice for Jasmine.

With Jasmine gone, the Lawrence family’s villa was naturally deserted. Without the servants, only an empty villa was left.

When Jeanne returned home, she found that the house was almost empty.

She did not know if the servants or Jeanne had emptied it, but in any case, it was extremely bleak.

The Lawrences were considered one of the twelve great families in South Hampton City. Yet, in just a few months, everything had changed.

She saw the ice coffin in the hall and the little boy.

In fact, she had seen so many bodies like that that she felt nothing, and that was why she could remain calm.

She waited a long time for the forensic pathologist, whom Finn had found for her, to arrive.

The forensic pathologist walked toward the ice coffin with his special tools. When he looked at the body, he paused. “The autopsy process will be a little too gory to look at. Ms. Lawrence, you can stand further away.”

Jeanne smiled.

She had seen worse.

She said, “It’s alright. I can accept it. I can even be your assistant.”

Finn was probably afraid that the matter would be easily exposed if too many people knew about it, and that was why he told the forensic pathologist to come alone.

Under normal circumstances, forensic pathologists would need help.

The forensic pathologist was surprised by Jeanne’s answer, but he began to perform the autopsy without saying much.

The autopsy took a long time because Jeanne had asked for more details.
