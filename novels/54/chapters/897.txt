898 A Thrilling Escape From Danger

That man was like a beast, and she was pressed tightly against his body.

Clearly, she could not resist or escape, so she could only endure it.

Suddenly, there seemed to be some noise outside the door.

Edward suddenly carried her into a dressing room that was not very spacious, and as soon as they entered, they heard footsteps coming in.

It was accompanied by the sound of conversation. “I really didn’t expect Michael to be such a person. Was his love for Monica in the media a lie? This kind of man is really disgusting.”

“That’s right. It’s a good thing that he was discovered and exposed. Otherwise, Monica would have been ruined. Monica is really blind. Why did she keep her innocence for such a person? I wonder how terrible Michael is!”

“Furthermore, Michael’s mother is the same. In front of outsiders, she portrays the image of a noble lady and always acts like she’s doing it for the country and the people, making people think that she’s not only noble but also virtuous. In reality, she’s disgusting. Those demeaning words she said to Monica made me want to go on stage and slap her a few times. Where did she get the confidence to think that Monica is out of Michael’s league? Where did she get the confidence to think that her son was invincible?”

“In my opinion, Fourth Master Swan is a hundred times better than Michael.” Suddenly, someone mentioned Edward.

Jeanne’s body tensed up.

It was not just because she heard the name, but it was the man who was shackling her.

As she turned around to glare at him, she watched as he mouthed, “Don’t move.”

She was so angry that she wanted to kill him.

At that moment, outside the changing room, the two women were still discussing. “Fourth Master Swan, please don’t have any scandals. I’m afraid it will ruin my dream of love in a wealthy family!”

Jeanne wanted to make a sound immediately and destroy their dreams.

“By the way, did you see? The woman Michael slept with is today’s bridesmaid.”

“I saw, and to think that I just made her look pretty. Ugh. I should have turned her into an ugly monster!” The woman was indignant.

One could tell from the way they spoke that the two gossiping girls sitting outside were today’s makeup artists.

They must have gone out to watch the fun just now, and now they were back in the dressing room to gossip. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It had to be said that after what happened to Michael today, he would not be able to have a career in politics. After all, people in politics could not have any stains on their reputation. His affair was also one of them, and so, the Sanders would no longer use Michael. Even if the Sanders were reluctant to give up their talents, in order to convince the public, they would not use Michael again.

Although the outcome did not force Michael to his death, it was quite a blow to him.

In fact, Jeanne could feel that Monica did not want to take revenge on Michael too deeply. To be able to break off the engagement and expose Michael’s true face in front of the public was Monica’s limit.

Monica might even feel a little guilty about destroying to country’s future pillar of support.

To Monica, that was enough.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

No matter how she tried to distract herself, she could not. She just endured it, with her body tensed up.

…

In the banquet hall, Finn began to frequently obstruct the Hills’ assassins’ work.

That was the final result of their discussion. They did not plan to swap out Alex Duncan’s hair because it was very dangerous.

After all, if he had only swapped Alex Duncan’s hair, he would have been able to fool them without being discovered. However, once he was found out, Alex Duncan’s identity would be exposed immediately, and they did not dare to take the risk.

That was why he chose that method of deliberately obstructing the assassin’s action.

Then, while that was happening, he would take the opportunity to swap Alex Duncan’s hair. This way, the Hills would not know whose hair he had swapped out, and they would not be able to find the target.

With that, he shuttled through the assassins.

He had attracted the attention of the assassins, but he was moving so fast that the assassins were completely caught off guard in such a short time. The main point was that the assassin had not gotten all of the guests’ hair yet, and they were afraid that all their plans would fail once there was chaos, so they did not deal with him immediately.

However, Finn only had that little time, so he could not waste any more time.
