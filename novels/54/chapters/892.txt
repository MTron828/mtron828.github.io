893 Humiliated At the Wedding, Michael Is Utterly Embarrassed!

There was another round of applause.

Tears welled up in Reese’s eyes. She looked very sad but with a sense of pride. She said, “His father had a message to tell Michael at the wedding. Can I please get the staff to play the video?”

Then, in the hall, the high-definition screen behind them showed the scene of Michael’s father in the ward when he was critically ill.

He was so thin that he looked like he had lost all his looks.

That reminded Monica of the last time she saw that person, and it inevitably made her heart ache.

Everyone’s heart also ached when they saw the video.

However, the person in the video was smiling, which made people think that he was in good spirits.

He said, “Michael, I took this video without you knowing only because I can’t do anything for you when you get married. I can only express my blessings to you in this way. Since you were young, I have been very strict with you. You almost didn’t have a childhood. For as long as you remember, you were always with me, dealing with many official matters. Everyone says you’re a genius, but I know that everything you have now is all your hard work. Michael, I am very proud to have a son like you to inherit my last wish of not being able to serve the country. Dad hopes that after you get married, you’ll be able to become a father. While you take care of your family, your mother, and your wife, you should devote your greatest effort to serving the country. I hope that in the years that I can’t be with you, you can continue to strive for self-improvement and become a useful person for the country,”

The entire speech was filled with emphasis on the hope that Michael could become a talent who serves the country.

It had a fearless spirit to it that moved people when in fact, it was just to pave the way for Michael’s future political career.

Before Michael’s father died, he had been asking his son to serve the country. As the leader of the country, the Sanders were naturally moved by Michael’s father’s words, and everyone who attended the banquet felt the same.

If not for the following incident, Michael’s future career should be glorious!

Monica pursed her lips tightly. At that moment, her arm that was holding Michael’s was trembling slightly.

She did not know if she was really destroying the country’s future pillar of support.

Putting aside all of Michael’s lies to her, Michael was indeed capable in terms of his career.

When Michael’s father’s video ended, the audience burst into continuous applause.

At that moment, Reese was already sobbing uncontrollably. She said, “Once again, thank you all for coming to Michael’s wedding. I will also follow Michael’s father’s last wishes and supervise and train Michael so that he can become a useful talent for the country and our society!”

With that, she bowed.

In the eyes of outsiders, Reese was the greatest wife of the people. She was noble, decent, and respected by the world.

Monica could not understand how a person could be so two-faced.

She even suspected that Reese’s disgusting face, which was hidden from everyone’s eyes, was just an illusion. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, that was the real Reese.

That perfect appearance lasted for only a second as a recording suddenly sounded at the banquet.

At that time, Reese was gently helping Monica down the stage.

Under the light, Reese seemed to be very close to Monica. As Monica’s gown was too long for her to walk, Reese even helped Monica with her gown, like a kind and loving mother.

Just then, slapping sounds rang out.

Her vicious voice came from the speaker.

“How dare you still want a wedding gift! Monica, you’d better know your worth. Marrying Michael is already way out of your league…”

“It’s your honor to be able to marry into the Rosses, and for you to marry our Michael is already your biggest wedding gift… However, you can’t miss out on a single dowry. If it’s not in my hand in a week, let’s see whether you’ll be able to marry–”

“I’m kind enough to allow her to marry into our family… Once she enters our family, she has to follow our family’s rules!”

“Monica, prepare the gifts and dowry according to my mother’s instructions.”

“So, is this what you meant when you said you like me?”

“...I like you when there’s no benefit to be gained.”
