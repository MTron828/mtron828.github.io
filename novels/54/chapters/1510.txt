Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s not the Leader’s intention. I just want to leave with your mother and sister because I’m too embarrassed to stay in South Hampton City,” Wyatt said bluntly.

“Even if you’ve handed over the power, I’m still by Edward’s side. No one will dare to do anything to you. There’s no need for you to leave this place.” Candice was a little emotional.

To her, Wyatt was the person who had treated her the best since she could remember.

Regarding the Nicholsons’ matters, she chose to remain silent because she did not want to involve herself in the country’s affairs, and she did not have the right to be involved either. That was Edward’s matter; he must have his own reasons for doing so, and she could not stop him. However, from a personal point of view, she could make her father’s life better.

“I don’t think it’s a shameful thing to hand over my power. In fact, even if the Leader didn’t do this, I would’ve handed over my power sooner or later. He’s truly an outstanding Leader. Harken wouldn’t be too bad under his rule, and I have no regrets.” Wyatt was actually very loyal.

After all, Harken had experienced too much turmoil, and the best way to avoid another riot was to unite all their strengths.

“The true reason I want to leave is that because of your sister’s matter, I can never live in Harken with my head held high. However, my selfish thoughts don’t allow me to put righteousness above family, so I can only choose to leave.” Wyatt said, “Don’t feel guilty. This matter has nothing to do with you or the Leader. It’s my own decision. Besides, I’m really grateful to the Leader for letting Chloe go.”

That was right. Since Wyatt had handed over his power, Edward chose to let Chloe go.

“In fact, he didn’t have to let her go. To put it bluntly, with the current situation in Harken, if Edward were a little tougher on me, my power would have been in his hands a long time ago, so I don’t blame him.” Candice listened quietly and slowly calmed herself down.

She said, “Has it all been decided?”

Had they decided to go abroad?

“It’s been decided.” Wyatt said, “After I leave, you have to take good care of yourself, even though we-”

Wyatt paused. It was as if he wanted to say something but held his tongue. “You’re a good child,” Wyatt said something else instead. “I really like you.” “But you’re leaving,” Candice said faintly, feeling a little emotional.

“Because I know you can take care of yourself. You’re completely different from Chloe. You’re much stronger than her, and I believe you will live a good life.”

Was that what people meant by ‘the squeaky wheel gets the oil’? “Before I leave, I have something to tell you.”

“Yes.” Candice nodded and accepted the fact that they were leaving.

It seemea tnat sne could accept many tmngs. sne did not Know wnat sne naa gone through in the past, but her heart was sometimes so strong that even she admired herself.

“Live a good life with Edward. Don’t hold any grudges against him, don’t blame him, and don’t think he doesn’t love you. He actually wasn’t as happy as you thought he was. He also hides a lot of sadness that no one knows about. You really have to treat him well, ” Wyatt said earnestly.

It made Candice feel as though there was a hidden meaning behind his words, and she did not know how to answer him.

After the unpleasant conversation that day, her relationship with Edward had indeed returned to normal. They seemed to have left the past behind, yet there also seemed to be some distance between them. It was an indescribable feeling, but Candice did not care too much.

“Candice, take good care of yourself.” Wyatt reminded her.

“You too, Dad. Take good care of yourself, Mom, and Chloe.”

“Alright.” Wyatt said, “You can call often as well. No matter what, we’re family.”

“Yes.”

“Bye-bye.”

“Bye-bye.”

When Candice hung up the phone, she still felt a little sad. It was as if she was reluctant for her loved ones to leave her side. However, it also seemed like their bond was not strong.

She looked at Paige, who was having fun by himself. In comparison, she seemed to be even more reluctant to part with the Swans.

“Mommy.” Paige suddenly got up from the ground and called out to her.

“What’s wrong?”

“I want to poop,” Paige said anxiously.

“Okay, I will take you to the bathroom.” Candice picked Paige up.

With Paige in her arms, she felt warm and satisfied.

She carried Paige to the bathroom downstairs, which Teddy was using. He was very apologetic as he said, “I’m sorry, Madam. I’m having diarrhea, but I’ll be fine in a while…

“It’s okay. I’ll bring Paige upstairs. Don’t worry.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Thank you… Madam.” It was obvious that the person in the toilet was not feeling great.

“Mom, I can’t hold it in anymore. I need to poop.” Paige was so anxious that she was about to cry.

Candice quickly carried Paige upstairs.

“Mom, hurry, hurry,” Paige kept urging her.

Candice went upstairs and rushed straight to George’s room. She removed Paige’s pants and placed the child on the toilet bowl. As soon as Paige sat down, she started pooping with a serious expression on her face.

Candice looked at Paige and could not help but smile, feeling content. She supposed it was because of Paige and George that she could not bear to leave this place.

After Paige was done, Candice cleaned her up.

The moment they were about to leave, Paige suddenly said, “Mom, I want to play in Brother’s room for a while.”

George was already trying to get back into shape, so he was training alone in the back garden.

George was not a typical dawdler, and when he was exercising, he would never let anyone accompany him. Not to mention her, even Teddy, who had been taking care of him, could not get anywhere near him.

That little brat’s sense of pride was too strong.

“Doesn’t your brother hate it when you play in his room?”

“That’s why I have to play in here when he’s not around,” Paige said seriously, as if there was no problem with her logic.

“There’s nothing fun in vour brother’s room.” Candice tried to dissuade her.

“I want to sit at his desk and draw.”

“Don’t you have your own desk?”

“I think his is better.”

Candice was speechless. Were other people’s things better and nicer?

“I’ll just draw a picture,” Paige said cutely.

Candice could not reject Paige’s request.

She said, “But if your brother doesn’t want you to play on his desk when he comes back later, you have to leave obediently, okay?”

“Alright.” Paige’s crisp voice sounded incredibly adorable.

Candice sat on George’s chair with Paige in her arms. The chair could be raised and lowered, so Candice lowered her head and adjusted the seat for Paige, who sat there obediently. Then, Candice found some of George’s drawing papers and colored pens.

While Paige obediently sat on the desk and started drawing, Candice sat beside

Paige. As she was bored, she helped George tidy up his messy desk and saw George’s precious diary. Looking at it, her heart suddenly ached. It was as if some memories were locked inside that diary.

She reached out and picked it up with the thought that if it was George’s diary or something private, she would put it down. She would never peek into George’s privacy. She just wanted to… see what was inside.

She was so attracted to it that she could not control herself..
