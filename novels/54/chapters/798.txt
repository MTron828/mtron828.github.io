Edward’s footsteps were quick as he shuttled through the base.

“Hey,” a man suddenly called out to Edward.

Edward lowered his cap and stopped in front of the man.

“Where to? Didn’t I tell you to go outside to provide support? What are you doing back here!” The man’s expression was dark.

Edward remained calm and said respectfully, “The boss told me to inform the men to bring the women out.”

The man glanced at Edward and seemed to believe him.

“Follow me,” he said coldly.

Edward followed the man’s footsteps.

the surroundings were a little chaotic as the patrol team was constantly sending out reinforcements, and gunshots kept coming from outside.

Edward followed the man and walked toward an exit.

Just as he walked out, the man turned around and pointed his gun at Edward.

Edward reacted quickly and raised the man’s gun. The bullet went off above the man’s head with a loud bang, attracting the attention of the others.

Edward’s eyes narrowed, and he made a move on the man.

The man felt as if his wrist had been broken, and the gun slipped from his hand. The next second, Edward’s gun was aimed at the man’s head, and he was shot dead.

The moment the man fell, Edward threw the man’s body toward a group of people who had suddenly rushed out from the inside. Then, he quickly retreated.

Gunshots and footsteps sounded behind him.

It was clear that he had been discovered by the other party.

In fact, when he saw the man lower his head and whisper a few words to his collar, he knew that his identity had been exposed. Therefore, when the man wanted to kill him, he was already prepared.

As he fled, he thought about why the man suspected him.

Logically speaking, there were so many people here, and about hundreds of people were stationed at the base. It was impossible for them to know everyone. Moreover, organizations like that had many new people, so it would not be too suspicious to see unfamiliar faces. However, how did the man just now know that he was not one of them?

It was because Jeanne was already dead!

That was how the man saw through his lie that he wanted to bring Jeanne out.

No, Edward did not allow himself to think about that because Jeanne could not be dead.

In that case, it was very likely that Jeanne had already been taken away. Therefore, when a second person appeared, they would know that he was lying.

With that thought in mind, Edward flipped over and leaped over a wall. The moment he leaped over, several gunshots sounded from behind him and brushed past his shoulders.

He rolled on the ground twice, quickly got up, and left in a hurry.

If his guess was correct, Jeanne had been taken away. According to conventional thinking, in order to not expose Jeanne’s movements, the man should have taken him in the opposite direction from Jeanne. Therefore, he should be going in another direction.

He quickly recalled the map of the base in his mind and located his current location. Then, he quickly simulated the direction he was going in.

As he strode toward his destination, he found more and more people patrolling the area.

They must have received notice that an outsider had infiltrated the area and sent more people to capture him.

However, he could not care less anymore. When the group of people passed by, he joined them again without anyone knowing.

Besides, no one would notice that there was another beside them because everyone’s attention was on the search.

He blended in with the people inside and walked quite a distance in the open while looking around discreetly.

At that moment, he had to go in another direction and separate from the group.

Hence, he tipped his cap and calmly walked away from the group of people.

He did not panic at all until someone called out to him from behind, “Hey, we’re going this way. Where are you going?!”

Edward pretended not to hear him and kept walking forward steadily. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I said, you’re going the wrong way!” the man called out to him again.

Then, in the next second, Edward rolled on the ground.

The other party may not be reacting immediately, but they would in the next second and shoot at Edward.

Only then did they realize that Edward was the person they were supposed to look for. Immediately after, countless bullets were fired at Edward, who was rolling on the ground.

During his escape, Edward managed to kill a few of them.

He rolled behind a pillar.

The sound of bullets could be heard all around them.
