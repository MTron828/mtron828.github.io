Chapter 111: Another Identity of Jeanne, Exposed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne parked the car.

Shen then rolled down the window. “Miles.”

Miles took a look at her, quickly opened the passenger seat, and sat down.

“Where’s George?” Miles asked.

“I’m going to pick him up now.”

“Okay.” Miles nodded.

The two of them did not say much.

Miles was one of Kingsley Thorn’s subordinates. In fact, she was also Kingsley Thorn’s subordinate. It was just that her relationship with Kingsley was a little different, so her identity was also a little special. However, Jeanne and Miles were still technically colleagues, and there was no need to be too formal with each other.

Jeanne went to pick George up and brought them to a luxurious restaurant in South Hampton City. They sat in a private room.

Jeanne ordered the dishes.

As she ordered the dishes, she asked, “Miles, are you from South Hampton City?”

They were all from Harken. In fact, they were Kingsley Thorn’s subordinates, and also a group of people who had gone abroad to ‘work’.

“No, I heard it’s in the Ancient City.”

“Oh, that’s not too far away. You’ve been away from your home for so long. Do you have any favorite local dishes?”

“I’ve forgotten all about it. Besides, I’m not picky about food,” Miles said coldly.

“Then I’ll just order whatever I want.”

“Sure.”

Jeanne ordered the restaurant’s signature dish. In fact, it was the same restaurant that Fourth Master Swan had brought her to eat in the middle of the night the last time.

She did not know if she was too hungry at that time, but she felt that the food here was pretty good.

The food was served quickly.

Miles asked, “What did you ask me to come back for?”

“Kingsley didn’t tell you?”

“He didn’t say. He just said that you needed me.”

“To protect George,” Jeanne said straightforwardly. “I have a lot of things to do, and I can’t take care of him properly.”

“What do you want me to do, specifically?”

“To be George’s chauffeur.”

“...” Miles looked at her.

“I know it’s a waste of talent, but don’t worry, Kingsley will not give you any less.”

“Okay.” Miles nodded.

In any case.

It was all just for money.

After dinner.

Jeanne wanted to leave the place.

Just as they walked out of the room.

They met... Fourth Master Swan.

Edward Swan’s eyes moved slightly as he looked at Jeanne and the man beside him, Miles.

Miles noticed his gaze and looked back.

“What a coincidence.” Edward’s gaze paused for a second on Miles before he looked at Jeanne.

“Fourth Master Swan, are you here for your meal?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yes.”

“Then I better not disturb. I’ll be leaving first.”

“Miss Lawrence, are you done eating?”

“I’m done eating.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne did not say anything more. She brought Miles and George away and even smiled at Edward when she left.

Edward’s throat moved slightly as he looked at her back view.

Miles turned his head to look at the man behind him. He then turned around and left with Jeanne.

Jeanne drove.

Miles sat in the front passenger seat. He said, “Is that the rumored Fourth Master Swan?”

“Is he that famous?” Jeanne could not help but laugh.

“Mr.Thorne often mentioned his name.”

She knew that Kingsley Thorn did not like Fourth Master Swan very much. To be more precise, he was not very fond of the Swans.

“You seem to have changed a little,” Miles suddenly said.

“How so?” Jeanne asked casually.

“In the past, when we were abroad, I felt that you were quite cold and preferred to be alone. You almost never smiled.”

It was not to that extent.

Jeanne just disliked Kingsley Thorn’s oppression and felt unhappy in her heart. There was no way she did not smile. Moreover, when she was with George, she was always as warm as spring.

“And you did not drive this slowly in the past,” Miles added.

“The outcome racing in Harken can be very tragic,” Jeanne explained.

Miles still felt that Jeanne had changed a little.

He thought about it and found that it made sense.

This was Jeanne’s hometown. After returning to her hometown and her family, she would eventually change.

Unlike them, who were a bunch of orphans that no one wanted.

They were lucky to be adopted, trained, and become... professional killers!
