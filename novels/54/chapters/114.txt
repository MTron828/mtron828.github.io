Chapter 115: Who Wouldn’t Know How to Play the Emotional Card?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was obvious that Edward already put him in an important position.

Just that it was far from what Eden wanted.

Moreover, Eden was always below Edward.

“It won’t if you behave and do what you should.” Edward gave an affirmative answer.

“So your reminder to me tonight was only for Jeanne, just to stop me from matchmaking you and Melody again?”

“Not only that.”

Eden looked at his uncle.

“The Swans have already laid our hands off royalty and the government for many years. Don’t try to break this taboo. Whether it’s your friend Micheal Ross or Melody, you can have a casual relationship with them. However, if you want to rely on them to let you climb higher, you’d better think twice before acting.” Edward’s voice was cold. He was neither threatening Eden nor did he sound angry. “The Swans have a lot of assets, but it’s up to you whether you can get it or not.”

Eden unconsciously clenched his fists.

What exactly did his uncle find out?

There was a feeling that Edward had seen through all his thoughts.

“Our conversation ends here. You choose your own path” Edward said. “Teddy, get in the car.”

“Yes.” Teddy opened the car door.

The car engine started and they left.

Eden looked in the direction where the car left and could not help but tremble.

He would not be threatened by Edward.

Definitely not.

He would definitely have a share of the Swans’ assets.

Not only a share but all of it!

He would not compromise!

…

The next day.

Jeanne woke up feeling refreshed.

It was indeed wise of her not to agree to go to Fourth Master Swan’s place last night.

A few days ago, she had to work overtime because of her collaboration with MUK Group. Today was Sunday, she slept until she woke up naturally. There was nothing happier than this.

George was also a child who liked to sleep. Ever since he went to school, he could not wake up on weekends no matter how hard he tried.

So, Jeanne let George sleep and walked out of her room.

She walked towards the stairs.

Just as she was about to go downstairs, she hesitated for a moment, then turned around and went to Jonathan Lawrence’s room.

The door was opened by Jonathan’s full-time maid.

“Is grandpa awake?”

“The old man is in the study.”

“I’ll go look for him.”

As she said this, Jeanne walked straight in. She then knocked on the door.

Jonathan raised his head. At this moment, he was using a calligraphy brush to practice writing. He glanced at Jeanne. “Come in.”

Jeanne went over and saw that Jonathan’s writing was vigorous and powerful. It was very elegant.

She said, “I didn’t expect grandfather’s writing to be so good.”

Jonathan did not have any special expression towards Jeanne’s deliberate flattery. He put down the brush.

The servant quickly went forward to help him tidy up.

Jonathan drank a mouthful of tea. “What’s the matter?”

“You don’t sound like you knew about the MUK contract. Did dad tell you about it?”

“Which one are you referring to?”

“The interest-free loan from Swanhaven Bank.”

“He did.” Jonathan looked like he did not care too much.

“200 million. Grandfather, do you understand?”Jeanne asked.

“My memory is still alright.”

“The Locke Enterprise also said that they would give us 200 million back then,” Jeanne said bluntly.

The moment Jonathan looked at Jeanne, he paused.

The next second.

He said indifferently, “What are you trying to say?”

“Back then, grandfather asked me to marry into the Locke Family. In return, they would provide us with 200 million in financing fees. They would help us build our relationship with MUK Group. Now, I’ve negotiated the cooperation with MUK Group, I’ve also gotten back the 200 million in financing fees.” Jeanne looked at Jonathan.

“So you want me to praise you?” Jonathan raised his eyebrows.

“Not really. I’m just telling grandfather that your 5% shares were not given in vain.”

Jonathan’s eyes moved.

“I won’t disturb grandfather anymore. I’ll go out first.”

Jonathan nodded slightly.

Jeanne left.

Jonathan looked at Jeanne’s silhouette and felt a sense of loss. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jeanne’s personality... had indeed changed.

In the past, Jeanne was very smart. She had been smart since she was young and did not spend much time on her studies. However, her results were always in the top three in the entire school. Even so, he had never thought that Jeanne would have such amazing development in the workplace. He still thought that Jeanne was still a playful girl. She was actually similar to Joshua. On the contrary, Jasmine was more scheming and had more value in the Lawrence family.

At this moment, he seemed to have changed his mind.

When Jeanne took the initiative to express her achievements today, it greatly boosted Jonathan’s impression of her.

If she was really well-behaved, it was not impossible for her to stay in the Lawrence family.

Jonathan smiled sinisterly. Next, it would depend on Jeanne’s own performance.

…

Jeanne left Jonathan’s study.

After she left, her smile instantly disappeared.
