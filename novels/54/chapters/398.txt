Chapter 399: The End of Monica and Michael’s Relationship Translation

The night was waning.

Jeanne held her phone tightly. Her expression was somewhat grim.

Her eyes were cold as she looked ahead and extinguished the cigarette butt.

Kingsley spoke on the other end of the phone, “For the time being, you guys won’t be in danger.”

“What do you mean for the time being?” Jeanne sneered.

“The Sanders don’t dare to touch the Swans easily, so without incriminating evidence of the Swans, even if the Swans have become a threat, they won’t act rashly. Otherwise, both sides will suffer heavy losses,” Kingsley said bluntly.

“Evidence?” Jeanne frowned.

Kingsley did not hide anything from her. “The Sanders are now looking for the Duncans’ orphan.”

“There’s still an orphan?”

“Back then, when the Sanders took the Duncans’ empire from them, the eldest madam of the Duncans was pregnant and escaped. Although she was hunted down later, her face was completely different when she died. The technology back then was not as advanced as it is now, so there was no way to verify if it was the eldest madam, but their shape and clothes were similar. Over the last few years, the Sanders had been worried, so they secretly sent people to investigate. Recently, the Sanders’ Intelligence Bureau sent a message saying that the eldest madam didn’t die back then. Her true death was only two years later.”

Jeanne listened coldly.

“And at that time, the eldest madam was pregnant. If she only died two years after the incident, it’s very likely that she gave birth to the only child of the Duncans. In other words, the Duncans are still alive in this world, and the child is a living threat to the Sanders. That is why the Sanders must get rid of the child.”

“Does this orphan have something to do with the Swans?” Jeanne hit the nail on the head.

......

“I suspect it has something to do with the Swans.”

“Back then, the Swans were the ones who helped the Sanders to build their success.” It seemed the Sanders were really good at burning their bridges.

“That’s why they suspect the Swans.” Kingsley said, “Back then, Old Master Swan was a member of the Duncans. However, when the battle between the Sanders and the Duncans broke out, Old Master Swan turned against his own and helped the Sanders to take down the head of the Duncans at the very last minute. In turn, he gained the trust of the Sanders. To show his loyalty, he chose to abandon politics and enter the business industry. Logically speaking, there’s nothing wrong with the Swans doing that. It was also because he took the initiative to give up military power that it reduced the Sanders’ suspicions of the Swans. However, after so many years of revisiting it and finding some clues, they believe the Swans aren’t what they appear to be.”

“What do you mean?”

.

“Firstly, the Swans were highly regarded by the Duncans back then. With Old Master Swan’s loyal character, even if he died on the battlefield, he wouldn’t have chosen to betray the Duncans and join the Sanders to protect himself. Secondly, over the last few years, the Swans have been growing bigger and bigger without the Sanders noticing. It’s not just business achievements. In fact, you know Fourth Master Swan very well, so I believe you can also tell that Fourth Master Swan isn’t a simple businessman.”

Indeed, he was not.

If he were just a businessman, his martial prowess would not be so strong. Moreover, his anti-human physique was indeed very suspicious.

“He’s not a simple businessman. He has his own underground forces. If Old Master Swan really abandoned politics and entered the business industry, he would definitely not train his own forces in secret. He clearly knows that training his own forces would threaten the Sanders and bring fear to the Sanders. By doing so, he definitely has another motive. Furthermore... Under the circumstances back then, it was sure that the Sanders would take over the power of the Duncans. If Old Master Swan were to fight with the Sanders, he would end up the same as the Duncans. But if Old Master Swan joined the Sanders at that time, the Swans would be able to survive and help the only heir of the Duncans to survive.”

Jeanne understood.

What Kingsley meant was that back then, Old Master Swan suddenly defected not because he was sincere about it and needed to protect himself. It was because he wanted to protect the only heir of the Duncans.

That meant that the Swans had been supporting that heir to grow up. Of course, not only would he grow up, but he might even take back the empire.

“After the Sanders thought of this, they began to make a move against the Swans. They said the Swans’ business status posed a threat to the Sanders, but in reality, they only wanted to test whether the Swans were really as the Sanders predicted. After a series of tests, they still aren’t completely sure if Old Master Swan is supporting the orphan of the Duncans. However, they’re certain that the development of the Swans has already exceeded the control of the Sanders. Hence, the Swans pose a great threat to the Sanders.”
