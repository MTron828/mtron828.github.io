Chapter 1403: Finn Drinking His Sorrow Away

Nox brought Monica to his private room, which was empty.

Monica frowned. “Are you drinking alone?! Where’s your fiancée?”

“She has to attend a company dinner tonight,” Nox spoke bluntly.

“So you’re lonely.”

“Do I look lonely to you?” Nox was speechless. “Hurry up. Sit down and drink with me–”

“Urgh! Urgh!” The sound came from the bathroom in the private room.

Monica’s hand that was holding the glass suddenly paused, and she turned to look at the bathroom.

“Finn’s drunk,” Nox said bluntly.

Monica’s expression darkened. Then, she put down her glass and was about to leave. She was fine drinking with Nox, but she really did not want to see Finn.

“Monica.” Nox pulled her back. “Why are you so afraid to see Finn?”

“I just don’t think it’s necessary.”

“I guess you still can’t let go of him”

“I don’t like him anymore.”

Nox was a little speechless, but he continued to say, “Haven’t you loved Finn for many years?”

“Don’t you know women change their minds very quickly?”

“Have you fallen in love with another man?!” Nox’s eyes widened.

Monica could not be bothered to talk to him. Hence, she pushed Nox’s hand away and turned to leave.

At that moment, Finn appeared in the private room, probably having heard their conversation. However, Monica did not stop when she saw Finn.

As she was about to leave, her eyes suddenly narrowed. She did not know how Finn, who was quite far away from her just a moment ago, had suddenly run over and blocked the door.

Of course, Monica was no longer surprised by Finn’s many inhuman abilities. For example, he was born not to feel pain, and he had super strong fighting abilities.

At that moment, the sprint was also a type of strength from fighting.

She looked at Finn coldly, and Finn was also looking at her in the same way. The two of them were in a stalemate.

Suddenly, Nox was in a good mood. He was originally extremely frustrated, but now that he was watching the “couple” fight, he felt inexplicably happy!

“Move aside,” Monica said coldly.

“I’m drunk,” Finn said.

” so- I‘

“I’m drunk, Monica.” Finn sounded and looked drunk.

“If you’re drunk, get Nox to send you back.”

“You can send me back,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica had never seen such a shameless Finn before. She pursed her lips and tried to control her emotions before she said, “Nox will send you home.”

“I said, I want you to send me home.” Finn enunciated each word, his tone heavy.

Nox was truly shocked by Finn. Was Finn acting like a spoiled child?

However, he did not look cute. On the contrary, he looked a little cold.

“Finn, don’t drown your sorrows with alcohol.” Monica’s expression was unsightly.

“If I don’t go drink my sorrows away, am I supposed to watch you fall in love with another man?” Finn mocked.

“We’ve broken up. My matters have nothing to do with you,” Monica said straightforwardly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Who said it has nothing to do with me?!” Finn laughed and said coldly, “I like you!”

Monica bit her lip lightly.

“So, I won’t allow you to fall in love with another man,” Finn said.

Then, he stretched out his hand and pulled Monica into his embrace.

Nox was dumbfounded at how proactive and overbearing Finn was! That was not the Finn he knew.

Monica lost her balance and fell straight into Finn’s embrace, with her nose bumping into his chest. It was so painful that tears were about to flow out of her eyes.

However, in the next second, she began to resist crazily.

“Let go of me, Finn!” Monica roared. “No!” Finn hugged Monica tightly.

“Finn!” Monica screamed.

At that moment, she really wanted to kill the man. She kept twisting her entire body to get away from him, but no matter how hard she tried, it was useless.

“Nox!” Monica had an idea. She called out to the man who was watching the show.

Only then did Nox come back to his senses. He was really frightened by Finn. Since when would Finn do such a difficult thing?

He even believed that in bed, Finn was one who would follow a routine without much of a reaction.

At that moment, his abnormal behavior toward Monica… was true love!.
