1136 She Meant It When She Said She Didn’t Like Him Anymore

However, she was emotionless. There was not a single trace of emotion in her eyes as she watched his expression coldly. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

At that moment, there was even killing intent in her eyes.

Perhaps she was here to kill him, unlike the Sanders, who did not dare to touch him.

If he were to die in prison and the Sanders could not explain themselves to the outside world, it would cause chaos.

However, Jeanne did not need to care about that because she only needed to kill Edward and avenge Kingsley.

Hence, she exerted more and more force on Edward’s abdomen.

The electricity struck Edward’s entire body. That continuous intense pain was not less severe than any injury he had suffered before. Even if it was a knife wound, a gunshot wound, or a whip, the pain would not last forever. However, the only thing that was forever was the voltage that seemed to penetrate his bones and circulated in his body. He did not even have the time to take a breath.

“Jeanne!” Chester sounded agitated.

He turned to look at Warren, seeking the latter’s opinion.

If that continued, Edward might really be killed by Jeanne. Once Edward died, there would definitely be internal conflicts in Harken. Then, once conflicts arose and the Duncans took advantage of that, the Sanders would be in danger.

However, at that moment, Warren did not signal for Chester to stop Jeanne.

On one hand, he was considering whether he should really kill Edward through Jeanne and use Jeanne as an excuse.

Anyway, Jeanne was just a pawn. It was worth it to exchange her for Edward.

On the other hand, he was also checking to make sure that Jeanne was not lying to him.

Chester reminded him that Jeanne might be acting with Edward.

At that time, he had dismissed Chester’s idea. However, as the head of the Sanders, he would naturally consider more things than others. In order to ensure that nothing would go wrong, he wanted to see how cruel Jeanne could be to Edward.

Did they really become enemies?

With that, the stalemate lasted for a long time until even Edward felt that his body might not be able to take it. Perhaps in the next second, he would really die in that prison.

“Enough!” Warren suddenly stepped forward and pulled Jeanne’s hand away.

The murderous intent in Jeanne’s eyes was still visible.

The moment Warren pulled her away, she switched to her other hand and tried to get close to Edward.

She had been in the Hills for so many years, so she should be able to sense what was the limit of life.

She should be able to sense that Edward’s life was about to end in the next second.

“Stop her!” Warren could see through Jeanne’s plan.

The two bodyguards who were holding Edward down immediately stepped forward, held Jeanne down, and snatched the taser from her hands.

At the same time, Edward, who could only stand up by relying on the bodyguards, fell to the ground.

He was unconscious on the ground, his face pale.

Warren gave Chester a look.

Chester walked up to Edward and placed his finger under Edward’s nose. He was trying to confirm if Edward was dead.

Then, after a few seconds of silence, Chester nodded at Warren. It meant that Edward was not dead yet.

Warren looked at Jeanne with hostility.

He said coldly, “Jeanne, I didn’t say you could act recklessly!”

At that moment, he was telling her off.

Jeanne bit her lip.

“In a situation where we don’t have evidence to prove that Edward is guilty, you will be creating trouble for us if you kill him!” Warren chided, “Since you’ve returned to the family now, you have to follow the rules of the Sanders!”

Jeanne’s throat moved, but she held herself back.

“Let’s go!” Warren ordered.

He allowed Edward to fall to the ground, unconscious.

Then, with a long face, he left the prison first.

Chester quickly followed behind Warren.

Jeanne turned to look at Edward, who was lying on the ground, his life or death unknown. After that, she turned around and left the prison.

They sat in Warren’s car that car drove toward the Sanders’ residence.

No one said a word in the car, and the atmosphere was solemn.

When the car arrived at the Sanders’ residence, Warren instructed, “Jeanne, I hope you can go back and calm down.”
