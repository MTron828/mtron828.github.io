Chapter 697: Another Problem Follows (Back To The Main Storyline)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was a cool autumn day.

Monica thought the weather was good, and it was. It was just the human heart that was bad.

She returned to her apartment with Michael accompanying her.

Michael poured her a cup of warm water, and Monica took a sip, which seemed to have warmed her cold body.

Even though they were not yet in the cold winter month, people could still shiver from the cold.

“I’ll go get the bath ready for you,” Michael said. “You’ll feel better after a hot bath.”

Monica just looked at Michael.

From the beginning to the end, he did not question her too much. All he did was support her silently.

Her eyes suddenly turned red again as she thought if only she could fall in love with Michael! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why must she torture herself like that?

Once the bath was ready, Michael came out and said, “It’s ready. Go take a shower. I’ve put all your clothes in the bathroom.”

Monica nodded.

She was really touched.

She walked into the bathroom and closed the bathroom door. After that, she took off Shelly’s coat and untied the hotel bathrobe, revealing her naked body.

She left the hotel just like that, wearing nothing underneath.

She looked at herself in the mirror — at her swollen eyes, her pale face, and her body, which was covered with terrifying bruises. She also saw many deep and shallow bite marks.

Suddenly, she laughed sarcastically.

Since when did she put herself in such a miserable state?

It was all for Finn, but was it worth It?

She turned around, soaked herself in the bathtub, and buried her head in it.

She told herself that she would never insult herself like that ever again.

…

In the room, Michael’s expression was grim. When he thought of Monica and Finn last night... He clenched his fists tightly.

He had deliberately waited for Monica downstairs at her house today.

In fact, he was also not sure if she would come back because he was actually afraid that Monica and Finn would get back together.

Fortunately, Monica came back covered in injuries.

He even saw traces of... sex marks on Monica’s body, which her clothes did not cover, and there were a lot of them.

Last night…

He chose to forget what happened last night, but forgetting did not mean he would act as if nothing happened. Forgetting only meant that he did not want to live in pain.

He had bigger goals and ambitions in his life and could not be obsessed with love. Therefore, he could not torture himself like that.

However, he was sure going to make someone pay back the humiliation and hurt he had suffered last night.

His eyes moved as he looked at the phone call.

Finn?

He did not save Finn’s number, but his memory had been amazing since he was young. Hence, he had memorized it after seeing that string of numbers once.

He actually did not know why Finn was calling him at that moment.

Finn was definitely not a person who would show weakness, nor was he naive enough to show off.

No matter how much harm Finn suffered or what honor he received, he would always... keep it to himself instead of expressing it to anyone.

That was probably the biggest conflict between him and Monica.

No matter how much he loved Monica, she would always be hurt by his indifference.

In this relationship, Michael had the advantage because he understood Monica better, and he was willing to change for Monica, even if it was not sincere.

However, Finn would not, even if it was just for show.

Michael picked up the phone nonchalantly.

“Finn.”

“Remind Monica to take a birth control pill,” Finn said bluntly, seemingly not wanting to talk to Michael.

Michael was finally provoked by that sentence. “Are you showing off?”

“I just don’t want to be involved anymore.”

Michael’s hand that was holding the phone tightened. “From now on, Monica won’t have anything to do with you anymore.”

“I know.” Finn’s voice was cold.

He knew very well that after this, it did not matter whether it was him or her, but they had already put an end to their relationship.

He admitted it. He actually regretted kissing Sarah.

Hence, when he saw Monica leaving sadly, he chased after her.

Monica could make him abandon many of his principles in life, and for a second, he wanted to give up his bottom line as well.

However, Monica chose to abandon him again and return to another man’s side.
