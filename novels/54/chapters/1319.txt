1320 Finn Is Jealous

Monica carried her clothes and walked out. She tossed the clothes into the laundry room, then returned to the living room to watch television.

Although she was drunk last night, she had slept well till this morning. She had been eating and drinking at Brandon’s house the entire day, but it was not even ten o’clock. She was not sleepy, so she turned on the television and watched some lively variety shows.

When she was free, she liked to watch these funny shows. It could also relieve stress.

She was laughing heartily alone in the living room.

When Finn came out of the shower, he saw Monica sitting on the sofa with a smile on her face.

In fact, he could not remember how long it had been since he last saw Monica like this. In the past three years, they seemed to have been busy with their own things and did not spend much time together. He had almost forgotten how heartless and indifferent Monica used to be.

When Monica saw Finn coming out, she only glanced at him before continuing to watch TV with a bright smile.

Finn walked over as if wanting to say something to Monica.

Monica’s phone suddenly rang. She took a look and picked up the call. “Brandon.”

“Monica, have you eaten the cookies that my mother baked?”

“Not yet,” Monica replied.

“Why don’t you take a bite? My mother insists that I ask you how it tastes.”

Mrs. Hayes was still the same, amusing. She said, “Okay.”

“Or if you’re on a diet and don’t want to eat at night, I’ll make up a comment for you.”

“No need, I’ll eat right away. Don’t hang up.” Monica quickly opened the cookies and took one out to chew on.

Finn walked closer to her and left silently. He walked to the kitchen and made himself dinner.

If not for the discomfort in his stomach, he might have forgotten that he had not even eaten dinner. He proceeded to eat his noodles quietly.

He heard Monica and Brandon chatting. They seemed to be chatting happily for a long time.

Monica hung up the phone and turned around to see Finn cooking in the open kitchen.

She frowned. “Haven’t you had dinner yet?”

She asked Finn.

Finn responded, “Nope.”

“Isn’t your stomach feeling bad?” Monica asked.

“Mm,” Finn replied.

Monica thought that as a doctor, Finn should know how to take care of his body better than anyone else, so he did not say much. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She placed the cookies that Brandon gave her in front of Finn, “It tastes pretty good. If you want to eat it, just help yourself. Remember to seal it for me. It won’t taste good when air gets in.”

Finn nodded.

“I’m going back to the room.”

With that, Monica left the living room.

Finn raised his head and looked at Monica after she left.

This was not much different from their usual interactions, but he felt that… something was really wrong.

Finn glanced at the cookies in front of him. In the end, he did not eat it. He sealed it for her and placed it on the coffee table.

He cooked the noodles and ate them slowly.

Halfway through, Monica came out of her room twice. She came out to pour water and returned to her room.

The two of them did not say much. He felt that they were like two guests living under the same roof.

After Finn finished his noodles and cleaned up the kitchen, it was already past eleven.

He suddenly felt like smoking, so he did not go straight back to his room. Instead, he went to the large balcony outside the living room. He stood by the railing and took his puffs, some deep, some shallow.

He finished one cigarette. He silently lit a second one.

He was releasing his emotions. He would never vent his emotions on others. It had always been himself to ease his own burdens.

He took out his phone and made a call. There was no answer.

Finn stopped dialing.

He put down his phone and smoked another cigarette.

Just as he was about to put out his cigarette and return to the room to sleep, his phone rang.

He looked at the caller ID and picked it up. “Nox.”

“Why are you calling me so late at night? I was just experiencing the bliss of life.” Nox smiled lewdly.

Finn chuckled. Sometimes, he really envied Nox’s personality.

In fact, Nox was not heartless. He just understood a lot of things, so he did not care too much about the trivial matters of life and had little worries.

“It’s nothing. Have fun.” Finn did not want to say anything more.
