Chapter 123: Ms. Lawrence Should Treat Me With “Courtesy”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Fourth Master Swan looked at Jeanne’s silhouette and slowly returned to the car.

Teddy followed and sat in the passenger seat.

The car drove towards the Swans Family Manor.

In the quiet car.

“Teddy.”

“Yes?” Teddy’s voice was trembling.

Those who were not familiar with Edward Swan only knew that he was cold, aloof, and unapproachable. Those who had come into contact with him would know that he was a petty man who would seek revenge for the smallest matter.

The perfect example was when the Fourth Master and the Eldest Young Master had dinner together. As Eden schemed against Edward and asked Miss Sanders to come over for dinner, Edward had deliberately woken Eden up even after he had passed out drunk. Lecturing was only one part of the purpose. It was actually for revenge.

He heard that because Edward woke Eden up midway, Eden had vomited the entire night after returning home. When Eden woke up the next morning, he said that he could not stand on his own feet and had even taken a day off to rest at home. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Thinking of this, Teddy’s heart trembled.

He was afraid.

“You can choose whether you want to gain ten pounds or lose ten pounds...”

“...”

He would definitely die in Edward’s hands one day.

…

Jeanne returned to her room.

George was already asleep.

Jeanne first charged her phone, then carefully returned to her room to take a shower.

After taking a shower, the quick charge mode quickly amped up her phone to 60% charged.

She exchanged the SIM card again.

After doing everything, she was just about to lie down on the bed to sleep when she suddenly thought of something.

She picked up the white phone again, connected it to the WiFi, and then downloaded something on the phone.

…

The next day.

Jeanne brought two phones to work.

She pressed a series of numbers.

The call went through.

“Fourth Master.”

“Ms. Lawrence.”

“How should I return your cell phone to you?” Jeanne asked.

“I’ll get Teddy to take it.”

“I’m at the Lawrence Enterprise. When Mr.Dolittle arrives, he can call me first.”

“Okay.”

Fourth Master Swan responded.

Jeanne said “Goodbye” and hung up the phone.

After hanging up the phone, she did not take this matter to heart. She quickly got back to work.

She was actually not very interested in romance.

She busied herself the whole morning.

It was almost 12 o’clock when Teddy came to her office.

Jeanne handed the phone to Teddy. “Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Dolittle.”

“Ms. Lawrence, you’re welcome.” Teddy appeared very polite.

Jeanne smiled.

“Then I’ll be leaving first.”

At that moment, the office door was knocked open.

Amy said respectfully, “Director Lawrence, it’s time for lunch.”

Sometimes she was so busy that she forgot to eat, so Jeanne would ask her secretary to remind her.

Jeanne nodded and said to Teddy, “Mr. Dolittle, do you want to have lunch together and try the Lawrence Enterprise’s employee meal?”

“No,” Teddy refused immediately. “I’m on a diet.”

Jeanne frowned slightly.

No matter how she looked at it, Teddy did not look like someone who needed to lose weight.

Could it be that nowadays, it is fashionable for men to say the word “Diet”?

“I won’t bother Ms. Lawrence anymore.”

Jeanne did not say much.

Before Teddy left, he remembered something.

“Oh right, Ms. Lawrence,” Teddy said again.

“Yes.”

“The phone is really mine,” Teddy emphasized once again.

Jeanne smiled. “Actually, it’s nothing. There’s really no need to take it to heart.”

She was not feudal to that extent.

“I have evidence.” Teddy quickly turned on the phone and opened Whatsapp.

He quickly browsed through it and found chat logs.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

The chat log was theirs.

That night, in order to send a voice message to Fourth Master Swan, they had added each other as friends.

Teddy immediately clicked on Jeanne’s voice message.

“Fourth Master, I’ve warmed up the bed for you tonight.”

“Come back soon, I’ll wait for you.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

So it really was Teddy’s.

‘But... why was the phone in Fourth Master Swan’s hands?’

Teddy said, “In order to hear Ms. Lawrence’s voice message anytime and anywhere, my boss took my phone from me.”

“...”
