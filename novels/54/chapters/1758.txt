Chapter 1759: Nox Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Outside the curtain, Sarah smiled cunningly.

Finn’s face turned red despite his trying to maintain his composure, whereas Monica was calm. To her, it was just a normal moment between husband and wife, and she did not think there was anything to be embarrassed about.

“Shelly, you’re here!” Monica greeted Shelly casually. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Yes, I came with Nox. Then, Sarah invited me to come along to see your two babies. They’re so beautiful now. They look so different from when they were born,” Shelly said sincerely.

“Yeah, I also thought they looked ugly when they were born, so I was surprised to see how good-looking they’ve grown after three months. It’s crazy.” Monica also praised her children generously.

“It’s because you and Dr. Jones are both good-looking.”

“That’s true.” Monica nodded proudly. “By the way, where’s Nox?”

“He’s out socializing.”

“He left you behind to socialize?”

“No, he was afraid I’d be bored with him, so he let me go. Besides, Bella would not have the patience.” Shelly defended Nox.

As Monica observed Shelly seriously, Shelly could feel her scalp go numb from Monica’s stare. Did she say something wrong?

“Shelly, you’ve changed. Are you starting to put in a good word for Nox? Tell me, have the two of you become very close now?” Monica asked cunningly.

Shelly blushed, not knowing how to answer Monica. She usually hated others talking about her and Nox, but now that she was fine with it, she did not know what to say.

Sarah could tell that Shelly was embarrassed, so she quickly said, “Monica, why do you have to care about other people’s affairs? Don’t you think it’s enough that you and Finn act so lovey-dovey in front of all of us?”

Monica naturally noticed how awkward Shelly was. It seemed like Nox still had not won Shelly’s heart completely, but their relationship had most probably improved a lot.

Since her intention was not to make things difficult for Shelly, she said to Sarah, “Okay, I’ll make sure to be extra lovey-dovey with Finn in the future.” Sarah could not believe how evil Monica was.

“Where’s Brandon?” Monica looked around. “Is he socializing out there as well?”

“How can he? He’s still at work because he’s afraid you’ll deduct his salary. He was thinking of coming over during lunchtime, “Sarah answered.

“Don’t forget that I pay him very well.” Monica looked gratified.

Sarah rolled her eyes. It was not a matter of salary but Brandon’s feelings for Monica. Sarah even wondered if Brandon would ever forget Monica.

“Alright. Since the two babies have eaten and Monica has gotten changed, let’s go out,” Ruby urged.

With that, everyone left the lounge and walked toward the hall. As soon as the hosts walked in, the originally lively hall suddenly became quiet. Everyone looked at Monica and Finn, each carrying a baby as they walked toward the center of the stage. The others who came out with them naturally stood below the stage.

Shelly held Bella in her arms and stood with Sarah. After a while, another person appeared beside Shelly.

He whispered to Shelly, “Let me hold Bella.”

Just as Shelly was about to refuse, Bella excitedly reached out and threw herself into Nox’s arms. Shelly watched as Nox held Bella in his arms, and a series of thoughts popped up in her mind.

Did he not have to socialize? Would his image be damaged if he was seen carrying a child? More importantly, his clothes would be wrinkled if he carried Bella, and it was not good to be seen with wrinkled clothes when socializing.

Shelly thought about it silently, but in the end, she allowed Nox to carry Bella. Although she did not think Nox should be carrying Bella, when she saw the smiles on Bella and Nox’s faces, nothing else mattered.

On the stage, a warm light shone on the family of four. Finn held a baby in one hand and the microphone in the other, thanking all the guests for coming to his children’s celebration party.

After thanking the crowd, Finn said, “Next, I have to thank my wife.”

Monica, who was beside him, suddenly turned to look at Finn. She could not believe such an aloof person like Finn would thank her..
