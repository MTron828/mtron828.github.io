Nox did not even look at Shelly as he bent down and punched Benjamin in the face a few more times.

In his mind, he screamed, ‘Let’s see how you sleep with Shelly now!’ ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Shelly watched as Nox, who was so angry that he had lost his mind, beat Benjamin up. She could not understand why Nox could do whatever he wanted to her and in front of her. What did she owe him for him to torture her like that?

Without thinking twice, Shelly picked up a vase at the entrance and smashed it on Nox’s head.

“Clang!” The vase shattered into pieces.

Suddenly, Nox stopped hitting Benjamin as he felt pain in the back of his head and his vision turned black. He tried his best not to faint so that he would not look pathetic in front of Shelly, but still, he fell uncontrollably in front of Shelly, with the back of his head covered in blood.

Shelly glared at Nox, watching as he fell to the ground motionless and the blood on the back of his head seep out from his hair. The scene in front of her was bloody and terrifying.

However, she felt inexplicably relieved, thinking it was a good thing that Nox was dead. If he were dead, he would not find trouble with her anymore.

Benjamin, on the other hand, quickly got up from the ground with bruises all over his body to check on Nox’s condition. If Shelly killed Nox… No, Shelly could not commit murder.

He reached his finger toward Nox’s nose and noticed that Nox was alive and had only fainted. Hence, he quickly covered the wound on the back of Nox’s head with his hand to stop the bleeding.

At that moment, he said to Shelly, who was standing there like a wooden statue. “Call the ambulance. Quick!”

Shelly suddenly came back to her senses and looked at Benjamin.

He added, “He’s not dead. Call the ambulance.”

Shelly gritted her teeth. Once she calmed down, she realized that killing someone would cost her her life. Hence, she hurriedly went to her room to get the phone that Bella was playing with and quickly called the ambulance for help.

Bella was also frightened by Shelly’s appearance. She murmured, “Mommy, I’m scared…

“Bella, be good. Don’t be afraid, and don’t come out of the room. I have to take care of some things and will be back with you very soon,” Shelly said quickly and anxiously.

Then, ignoring Bella’s emotions, she handed the phone to Bella and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door for her.

At that moment, Benjamin was already using a tissue to stop the bleeding, and the blood had dyed the tissue in Benjamin’s hand red.

“Get more tissue paper for me,” Benjamin called out to Shelly.

Shelly quickly took a packet of tissue paper and gave it to Benjamin, who pressed the tissue on Nox’s wound again. He was afraid that Nox would really die from losing too much blood.

Neither of them spoke in the living room, probably because they were still frightened. Benjamin had never seen such a scene before, and neither did Shelly.

The two of them waited quietly for the time to pass until the ambulance finally arrived. The medical staff quickly gave Nox a simple treatment to stop the bleeding and carried him out quickly. When the medical staff left, he shouted, “Family members, follow us!”

Shelly was stunned for a second.

Benjamin said, “I’ll go.”

As he spoke, he was about to leave with the medical staff.

However, Shelly pulled him back. “I’ll go.”

“Shelly… ”

“I’ll go.” Shelly was determined.

She had to take responsibility for what she had done. Even if Nox wanted to sue her, she would accept it.

“I’ll go with you!” Benjamin was obviously worried.

“No, look after Bella for me.”

“I’m afraid that Nox will—”

“I know how to solve it. Even if I can’t, I can beg the Winters.” Shelly had made up her mind.

Seeing how determined Shelly was, Benjamin nodded slowly. Then, Shelly quickly caught up with the medical staff, and they sent Nox to the hospital.

In fact, Nox woke up on the way to the hospital. Lying in the ambulance, he looked at Shelly, who was sitting next to him.

Shelly naturally saw that Nox had woken up, but neither of them spoke. Shelly did not even say a word of concern and just looked at him coldly.

Nox’s expression was extremely ugly. He could not believe Shelly wanted to kill him by smashing his head with a vase!

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got. However, he did not say anything because he had a terrible headache. He was afraid that getting too worked up would cause him a brain hemorrhage and he would really die as Shelly wished!

The ambulance soon arrived at the hospital, and Nox was sent to the emergency room. Meanwhile, Shelly sat outside the emergency room and waited calmly. Since it had happened and she could not change anything, it was better for her to accept it.

She waited for almost an hour until Nox was pushed out.

The doctor said, “Fortunately, it’s just a superficial wound and we managed to stop the bleeding in time. His life is not in danger at the moment, and his brain stem is not injured. But because the wound is relatively big, he needed four stitches. To be safe, I suggest staying in the hospital for a day to see whether he has a concussion.”

Shelly nodded and then turned to look at Nox, who was lying on the bed with a bandage on the back of his head. It was obvious that the back of his head had been shaved off by the doctor.

“I’ll go handle the hospitalization procedures,” Shelly said to Nox.

Nox ignored her. He was very angry with Shelly. However, Shelly had expected that, so she turned to leave, not looking to get a reply from Nox.

“I’m not staying in a normal ward,” Nox suddenly shouted at Shelly.

It meant he wanted to be put in a high-class private ward.

With that, Shelly gritted her teeth and left without saying anything. When she was handling the procedures, she asked about the cost of the private ward. Upon learning that it would cost 2000 dollars a day, she almost choked.

Shelly hesitated before saying, “Just a normal single ward will do.”

After that, Nox was pushed into an ordinary single ward. While Nox was fuming, Shelly appeared in the ward.

He yelled at Shelly, “Are you crazy to think I would live in such a cheap place?”

Shelly remained silent. In fact, she knew that Nox had always had the best of everything since he was young, so this kind of room was not up to his standard.

“Change my room, now!” Nox went berserk.

Still, Shelly did not respond to him.

“Shelly, are you deaf? I want you to change my room.”

“The doctor said you should stay calm, or you might get a brain hemorrhage,” Shelly reminded.

“I told you to change my room!” Nox gritted his teeth.

He really wanted to strangle Shelly for putting him in such a place!

“Give me the money, and I’ll change it for you,” Shelly said calmly.

She knew that if she did not give it to Nox, he would go on and on.

At that moment, Nox was about to explode with anger.. “Do you remember why I’m in the hospital? How dare you ask me for money? Are you crazy? Shelly, believe it or not, I will strangle you to death!”
