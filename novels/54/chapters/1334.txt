1335 An Encounter at Dinner and Finn’s Outburst

As Monica spoke, she sighed. Things had changed. She seemed to be able to recall the scene with Jeanne when Edward was still the Fourth Master.

It had only been a few years, but everything had changed.

Jeanne was dead.

The emotions in Monica’s eyes were obvious. Brandon naturally noticed it too. He said, “You’re thinking about Jeannie, right?”

Everyone in Harken knew about the relationship between the Chief and Jeanne, so it was normal for Brandon to be able to guess Monica’s thoughts.

Even though Monica was surprised for a second, she did not think too much about it.

She said, “Nothing. She’s dead.”

She had been dead for so many years. So what was the point of talking about it?!

Brandon looked at Monica and chose to remain silent, even though he knew that she must be feeling terrible right now. After all, let alone Monica who was Jeanne’s close friend, even when he found out that Jeanne had passed away, he could not accept it for a long time.

Now that she was dead, he did not know how to comfort those still alive. He could only accompany Monica even though it was difficult. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The car soon arrived at Chez Jeanne.

The two of them walked into the luxurious private room of the restaurant. Everyone on the project team had already arrived. They were just waiting for them.

Brandon could liven up the atmosphere. He was the kind of person who was very useful in a group. He quickly said to everyone, “I’m sorry, there was a traffic jam and we got a little late. To express our apology, the Chairman and I will down our drinks first.”

Monica could not help but glance at Brandon. D*mn it, could he not drag her down with him?

However, she did not refuse. In any case, her alcohol tolerance was not bad. Coupled with the fact that it was a celebratory dinner, there was actually no need to practice restraint. Hence, she raised her glass. Because of her gesture, the team, who were originally a little restrained, immediately let loose to enjoy themselves.

They had yet to eat but everyone at the table had started drinking alcohol to their hearts’ content.

“Everyone, don’t just drink. If you get drunk and forget to collect the reward, that’ll be on you. Don’t blame me.” After a round of drinking, Brandon found an excuse to stop.

When everyone heard that there was a reward, they hurriedly put down their wine glasses. Monica also took a break from drinking.

This bunch of people, she did not expect them to be so good at drinking. She could barely hold on. Fortunately, Brandon was smart to come up with an excuse she could use as a breather. Otherwise, she would actually get wasted at this rate.

“Alright. As promised, when we win the project, there’ll be rewards given by the Chairman. Everyone’s rewards are in my hands right now.” After Brandon finished speaking, he deliberately joked, “My rewards are also inside.”

Everyone was amused by Brandon. There was no seriousness like when they were at work at all. The vibe was extremely good.

Brandon distributed everyone’s rewards. The rewards are simple, cash rewards. The scale differs according to the contribution made by different roles in the team.

Brandon was holding checks issued by Cardellini Enterprise. Nothing beats the satisfaction of handing out a check on the spot.

After distributing the rewards, everyone present got even more excited. Monica originally thought that she could rest for a while, but she did not expect that the employees who received the reward would be so pumped. Those who asked her for a drink turned into two glasses, four glasses, and eight glasses.

If this continued… She would be forced back to the ground by these people. She had only gotten drunk last night. She really did not want to experience that feeling again today.

She began to push back a little. Brandon had always been good at reading Monica’s expressions. When he saw her begin to push away the glass, he knew that she did not want to drink too much, so he quickly helped Monica drink.

Monica and Brandon really had a tacit understanding. She did not know if it was because they had known each other since they were young, but in terms of work and life, they could really get along well.

As soon as Brandon helped her block the drinks, she found an excuse to leave. She left to ease the discomfort in her stomach. She walked out of the private room and headed for the washroom.

There was also a washroom in the private room, but she wanted some fresh air to lose the smell of alcohol so she walked out.

She had just walked into the washroom and her eyes suddenly paused.

The woman opposite her halted too when she saw Monica. As if she could not recognize her, she looked straight at her.

Monica was speechless when she saw Patsy’s expression.
