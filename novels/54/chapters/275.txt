Chapter 276: There’s No Need for a Fruitless Relationship to Begin

“I didn’t expect that either,” Kingsley said fiercely, “If I had, I wouldn’t have let you go back! I could’ve found anyone to help you take revenge for your mother! Now, you’re completely involved in the mess there!”

“Everything that unfolded isn’t what I had expected, but they indeed happened because of me. If I suffer any consequences because of this, it’s my own choice. You don’t have to feel guilty!”

“Jeanne, I want you to live well.” Kingsley’s tone was a little heavy, and it was obvious that he was angry.

“Me too.” Jeanne was straightforward. “But now that things have come to this, other than forcing myself to go on, what else can I do?!”

“You can still leave!” Kingsley said.

Jeanne frowned slightly.

“You can leave South Hampton City right now, and from now on, you’ll never interfere with anything in Harken!” Kingsley’s voice was a little loud.

Jeanne’s heart froze.

She never thought that she would suddenly stop halfway.

“Let go of your hatred and your feelings for Fourth Master Swan. Leave South Hampton City and Harken right now!” Kingsley was extremely serious, “This is the last chance for you to completely get rid of the Sanders, the Swans, and Harken!”

Jeanne was a little silent.

She remained silent and did not reply.

“If you refuse this time, I can guarantee that you won’t have the chance to escape unscathed anymore!” Kingsley reminded her.

It was a heavy reminder.

Jeanne pursed her lips. “I’ll think about it.”

“You have to answer me now!” Kingsley did not give Jeanne any time to think at all.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

“You’d better think about it. Besides yourself, you still have George. George shouldn’t bear the mistakes you made!” Kingsley reminded her again.

In fact, Jeanne had not been with Kingsley for too long.

Even so, he knew her weakness very well.

Until now.

In fact, Jeanne had not thought about the danger she was in Harken. Melody’s death had indeed made her look at the chief in a new light. She also believed in Kingsley’s words that it was risky to be with someone of a high position. If she angered the chief again, she might end up like Melody.

Nevertheless, Jeanne did not think that there would be a next time.

She only needed two months at most to settle the enmity with the Lawrences and take their assets.

After that, she would leave.

She would not have any lingering feelings for this city.

Now, Kingsley’s words made her a little scared.

Kingsley would never exaggerate and say something that would make people afraid. He must know a lot of inside information and know that a lot of things would happen next. That was why he was so determined to let her leave. Therefore…

Yes.

In this world, she only trusted very few people.

Jeanne admitted that she was very unwilling.

When she was framed by Jenifer, whipped by Alexander, and found out the real cause of her mom’s death, she wished she could kill everyone in the Lawrences with her own hands. Hence, during those years when everyone thought that she had suddenly disappeared, she desperately tried to become stronger. The only thing she wanted was to take revenge for what happened.

Now…

It did not matter!

If it was not her, it could be someone else.

Jeanne believed that Kingsley would not go back on his words.

In any case, the outcome would be the same. She did not need to pursue the pleasure of taking revenge.

All she needed to know was that the Lawrences would die a horrible death.

Jeanne said, “Alright, I’ll leave.”

After a few seconds of hesitation, she agreed.

When Kingsley heard Jeanne’s reply, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Jeanne was too stubborn. Sometimes, if he forced her to do something, she might react even more violently. That was the case with the matter with Melody this time.

If she could endure it a little, it would not be to the extent that Melody would die.

“Make some preparations. At the latest, tomorrow, I’ll personally come to pick you up and leave.” Kingsley did not say much. Those sentimental words were not appropriate at this moment.

“There’s no need to make any preparations. Other than George, I have nothing to take away.”

Jeanne had brought George along when she came.

When she left, she would only bring George along.

“Alright.” Kingsley directly hung up the phone.

He had probably gone to make preparations.

Jeanne also hung up the phone.

After hanging up the phone, her heart was empty.

She could not describe what she felt.

It was as if she had given up a lot…

Her eyes moved slightly.

Jeanne looked in the direction of the door.

Fourth Master Swan appeared at the door.

He looked at Jeanne with his arms around his waist. He looked at her sitting at the head of the bed and seemed to be in a daze. The moment he appeared, she stared straight at him.

The two of them looked at each other.

“Do you want to get up?” Edward asked her. He stood at the door and asked Jeanne.

Fourth Master Swan kept his word of not setting a foot in this room anymore.

Jeanne smiled and made herself look very normal. “Yes.”

“What do you want to eat for breakfast?”

“Are you going to make breakfast?” Jeanne asked.

It had been two days and there was still no one else in Bamboo Garden other than the two of them.

Jeanne suddenly felt sorry for Teddy.

She would not believe that Teddy had gone to send Nox back and had not returned even after two days!

Jeanne wondered where Teddy was!

Fortunately, she was leaving.

Once she left, Fourth Master Swan should let Teddy come back.

Some emotions were hidden at the bottom of Jeanne’s heart.

“I’ll try.” Edward nodded.

“I want to have some sausages,” Jeanne replied.

“Hm?” Edward raised his eyebrow slightly.

He looked a little... perverted.

Jeanne frowned.

Edward asked in an attractive voice, “Say it again.”

Jeanne was baffled.

She said, “You can make me a big breakfast.”

Jeanne was craving a big breakfast at the moment.

“Oh,” Edward replied.

His smile was really bright.

Jeanne was speechless when he saw Fourth Master Swan’s smile.

Her face turned red when she recalled what she said just now. It turned out that Fourth Master Swan was having dirty thoughts.

“Go and wash up. I’ll go down first.” Edward seemed to be very pleased.

His mood was great.

Before he left, he deliberately said, “I’ll let you eat my sausages.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘Eat my *ss!’

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Her face was a little red.

Despite that, she felt a little bitter.

Monica was sometimes very naive, so simple that she might not even know who she really liked, but sometimes, she could see many things clearly.

For example, Monica said that Eden was far inferior to Fourth Master Swan. She also questioned why Jeanne could fall in love with Eden but not Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne could love Edward.

However, what could she do?!

There was no need for a fruitless relationship to begin!
