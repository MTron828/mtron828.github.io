1092 Neither of Them Needed The Other Anymore

With that, he opened the car door and left.

Monica watched as Nox disappeared from her sight before she slowly drove away.

Nox’s words rang in her ears. “Don’t take depression lightly.”

She drove to the hospital.

She had not been to the hospital for two days because she had to attend court and deal with some urgent matters at Cardellini Pharmaceutical.

Once she parked the car, she went to her father’s intensive care unit first.

She did not know when he would wake up or if he could still wake up. However, she seemed to have accepted everything.

She stood outside the intensive care unit and stayed with her father for a long time before she went to the ward.

The moment she pushed open the door to the ward, her eyes narrowed.

She saw Richie, the man who had set up the trap with Michael and almost caused her to be raped by Michael.

She remained silent as she looked at him. He seemed to have brought a lot of gifts and was talking enthusiastically to her mother. He kept talking about how well her father had treated him in the past, but because he had been busy with work all these years, he had not been able to visit her father more than a few times. Now that he was back, he did not expect to see the old man in that state. He was very sad.

Monica just watched his performance. Instead of interrupting or stopping him, she sat on the sofa and listened to him.

At that moment, he seemed to realize that Monica had arrived, so he hurriedly said, “Monica, look at how big you’ve grown. When I first saw you, you were only four or five years old. You were only this tall. I even carried you in my arms to buy lollipops. Do you remember?”

“That was such a long time ago, but I remember very clearly that we had a dinner party a few days ago.” Monica smiled without revealing too much emotion.

Richie was not embarrassed, and he quickly echoed, “Yes, yes, yes. Oh, what is my memory? There were so many people that night that I almost forgot.”

Of course, Monica did not believe his nonsense.

“I remember I said I wanted to visit your father. Look, this delay has dragged on for another two days.”

“That’s right, and I said that business is more important. Mr. Sanchez, you’re so busy. It doesn’t really matter if you come or not.” Monica said bluntly.

“How could I not come? No matter how busy I am, I will come,” Richie said eagerly.

Monica smiled. “In that case, my dad’s ward is in the intensive care unit, not here.”

Richie felt a little awkward. Of course, he knew that Monica was being sarcastic, so he hurriedly said, “I just went over to take a look and thought that your mom must be very sad, so I wanted to come and see her. I believe that Mr. Cardellini will wake up sooner or later.”

“My mom and I have heard a lot of these words,” Monica said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It was so satirical that Richie was really embarrassed at that moment.

After all, he was 20 years older than Monica and had been in the business world for many years. However, he had never been embarrassed by a little girl.

Monica naturally refused to show Richie any shred of respect. She said, “We appreciate your kind intentions, Mr. Sanchez, but it’s getting late. You should head back.”

It was obvious that she was telling him to leave.

Richie also knew that Monica would not be dismissed like that, so he smiled apologetically and said, “Actually, I came here this time because I have a small matter to discuss with Monica.”

He finally revealed his true colors.

“Mr. Sanchez, if it’s a private matter, you can speak now. If it’s a business matter, I’m sorry. I don’t talk about business after work. If you have anything to discuss, you can make an appointment with my secretary. I’ll see you when I have time.”

“Look, you’re treating me as an outsider. Your father and I had a great friendship back then. Won’t you hurt our relationship by doing things in such a formal manner?” Richie said with a fawning smile.

Monica shot him a glance.

She really did not want her mother to see how dark the business world was.

As such, she said, “Let’s talk outside.”

“Sure, sure.” Richie quickly agreed.

Monica said to Ruby, “Mom, you can order dinner first. I’ll come back to eat with you after I’m done talking with Mr. Sanchez.”

“Alright.” Ruby nodded.

Her mood was a lot more stable the past few days, probably because she had accepted Gary’s condition.

Monica led Gary out of the hospital ward and walked straight to a balcony in the ward area.

Occasionally, there would be one or two family members of patients, doctors, and nurses who would come to take a breather or smoke.

However, it was mealtime now, so it was very empty up there.

“Mr. Sanchez, if you have something to say, just say it.” Monica brought Richie here and went straight to the point.
