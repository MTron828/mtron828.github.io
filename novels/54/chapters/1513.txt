Chapter 1514 Candice Recovers Her Memories, Jeanne Is Alive

Although it had been a long time since he had been here, he never thought that the next time he came here, he would be met with such a scene.

Candice turned to look at George. To be precise, she was not Candice but Jeanne, the person whom the entire world thought was dead. She had regained her memories and recalled the last time she was at Bamboo Garden. At that time, everything was silent.

After she had given birth to Paige naturally and Edward had left her side, a few medical staff rushed in and gave her an injection. She thought that was her end. Although she was unwilling to die, she did not have the ability to resist. Thus, she calmly accepted her death.

She had never thought that she would open her eyes again in this world. If she did, she would be in heaven, or even hell. However, when she opened her eyes, she saw Finn.

Just as she was wondering what happened to Finn and how he died, she heard him say, “We’re not dead. We’re all alive.”

Jeanne really could not believe it, but she had to.

Did that mean Edward was keeping her alive by faking her death again?

“However, you can’t leave this place for the time being.” Finn said, “You should get some rest first. After that, I’ll help you with plastic surgery on your face.”

“Why?”

“Using another identity to let you live.”

“Is this Edward’s idea?”

“It’s Fourth Master’s idea, ” Finn answered affirmatively.

“Can I see him now?”

“No, not for a long time. Once you are found alive, we will all be in trouble,” Finn said coldly.

“So, I can only accept the arrangement?” “This is the only way to keep you alive.”

‘What if I don’t want to?”

“Jeanne, you have to understand Fourth Master.”

“Who will understand me?” Jeanne asked Finn, “I’ve lost everything because of all this politics. And in the end, I don’t even have the right to be myself, huh?” “Being alive is more important than anything else,” Finn comforted her.

Yes, staying alive was more important than anything else, and she accepted Edward’s arrangements for her.

Two months later, she underwent the surgery Finn arranged for her. Surgery after surgery, she watched as she was transformed into another person — a stranger — a woman named Candice.

“Do I have to take this medicine?” Jeanne looked at herself in the mirror, at her unrecognizable self after countless surgeries. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Finn remained silent.

“What’s the use of eating it?” Jeanne asked him calmly.

Finn said, “You’ll lose your memory.”

Jeanne listened and thought, ‘No wonder I haven’t been able to remember many things recently.’

Many of her memories seemed to have become a blurry shadow.

“It’s just amnesia. There won’t be any other side effects. I’ve already done clinical trials on it.”

“So you were the one who developed it?” Jeanne asked Finn. She did not sound excited or angry. She was just chatting with him. “Yes.” Finn nodded.

Actually, Jeanne did not doubt Finn’s medical skills. After all, Edward’s hormone pills were probably made by Finn. However, those drugs should not be on the market, which meant they were banned.

“Is Edward afraid I will kill him?” Jeanne asked Finn.

When she asked, she found it a little amusing. Finn looked at Jeanne and said, “No, he just wants to start over with you.” “That means he still doesn’t believe me.”

“There’s too much blood feud between the two of you. Are you really willing to ignore the past and be with him? Are you willing to put on an act with him? Are you willing to become another woman for him? Are you willing to return to his side as another woman and accompany him for the rest of his life?”

“So the best thing for us is to split up.”

“He’s willing to use the most despicable means to get you back to his side.” Finn said, “For that, you can say he’s not a good person, but he’s definitely the man who loves you the most in the world.”

That conversation was not a pleasant one.

Later, her memories after that became more and more blurry. She gradually forgot about Edward, Finn, Monica, and even her son and daughter. It felt like the next time she woke up, she might not remember anything anymore. Hence, she asked Finn for a favor..
