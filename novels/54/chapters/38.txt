Chapter 39: It’s Time for You to Do Family Planning With Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica accompanied her dad to the hospital.

Sitting in the luxurious car, Monica was deep in thought.

Gary frowned. “You’re normally talkative. Why aren’t you talking to me now?!”

“What can I say to an old man like you…? Ah!” Monica held her head. “Dad, I’m so stupid because you’ve been hitting my head since I was young.”

“If you know you’re stupid, stop thinking so much. Just live a good life with Finn.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Finn, Finn. Is Finn your illegitimate child?!” Monica was displeased.

Gary was too lazy to answer and changed the topic. “I heard that Jeannie is back?”

“She’s been back for many days. Dad, you don’t even care about my friend!” Monica complained.

Gary was speechless. He said, “When you’re free, ask Jeannie to come over for dinner. I’ll treat her well.”

“You promise?”

Gary nodded.

“Then I’ll find time to ask her to come over for dinner,” Monica said with a smile.

The father and daughter had a very good relationship. They were often noisy, but their relationship was extremely good.

They chatted and laughed as they walked into Finn’s office in Central Hospital.

Finn was wearing a white coat and a pair of framed glasses. He was everything one could fantasize about a doctor.

Back then, Monica fell in love with this b*stard at first sight. It was probably because she could not resist seeing him in a white coat!

“Dad, you’re here so early,” Finn called Gary naturally. He stood up respectfully and went over to help him.

“I have a shareholders’ meeting in the afternoon. I came over early since I have time in the morning.”

“I’ve arranged everything for you. Follow me.”

Finn brought Gary to undergo a physical examination.

Gary had a very serious heart condition. Three years ago, he underwent a heart bypass surgery. Finn was the chief surgeon, and the surgery was very successful. Nonetheless, because of the heart surgery, Gary had to undergo a full body checkup every six months, and it was also done by Finn himself.

Monica waited in Finn’s office.

Finn’s assistant respectfully made a cup of tea for Monica. “Mrs. Jones, here’s your favorite royal black tea.”

Monica thanked her and sighed. “The treatment in this hospital is too good. You even serve such expensive tea. Isn’t this a public hospital?”

“The tea belongs to Dr. Jones,” the assistant replied.

“That scum really knows how to enjoy himself,” Monica could not help but say after taking a sip of her tea.

The assistant was speechless.

Dr. Jones never drank black tea. It was only brewed for Monica whenever she came.

…

Monica waited for an hour.

When Finn and Gary returned, Monica asked Finn, “How’s my dad?”

“He’s fine,” Finn answered. He turned to Gary and said, “Based on the results, your health is no different from a normal person’s. As long as you continue to take care of yourself according to my medical advice, there won’t be any problems.”

“Thank you.” Gary patted Finn’s shoulder with a smile.

“Dad, you’re being too polite.” Finn was very polite.

Monica looked at Finn. This man was always polite in front of outsiders, but in front of her, he was the worst!

“Since I’m fine, I won’t disturb your work. Monica, let’s go,” Gary said.

Monica stood up from the sofa.

“I’ll send you off,” Finn said hurriedly.

The three of them walked out of Finn’s office and entered the elevator.

The moment the elevator opened, Monica paused for a moment.

Not only Monica, but the person inside was also stunned.

He looked straight at Monica.

“Commissioner Ross, we’re here,” the person next to him reminded him to get off the elevator.

Michael then walked out.

He walked past Monica.

Monica pursed her lips and did not look any different.

Finn sent Monica and Gary to the car. Gary said, “It’s been a long time since you’ve gone home for dinner with Monica. Come back for dinner tonight.”

“I’ll try my best.” Finn agreed.

Gary nodded and gestured for the driver to drive away.

In the car, Monica did not say a word.

Gary said, “Michael has returned to Harken?”

Monica came back to her senses and said nonchalantly, “Probably.”

“Don’t come up with any bad ideas. Think about how he broke up with you back then!” Gary sounded a bit serious.

“Got it.” Monica was a little impatient.

She picked up the mineral water in the car and drank it as though she was not bothered.

“When are you and Finn going to have a child?” Gary suddenly asked.

Monica almost spat out a mouthful of water.

‘F*ck.

‘I’m still a virgin. How are we going to have a child?’

“You can start planning,” Gary said with a commanding tone.

Monica was not going to care about what the old man said. In any case, she was going to divorce Finn sooner or later!

…

Before long, the Lockes declared bankruptcy.

They were probably the only publicly listed company that declared bankruptcy so quickly. It seemed that their death was declared before they could even struggle.

Jeanne lay on the chair in her room and looked at some news out of boredom.

These few days, she had nothing to do. She either accompanied George in their room to “play computer games”, went out for a stroll in the Lawrence Residence’s courtyard, or watched coldly from the side as the Lawrences prepared for Jasmine and Eden’s wedding.

There were only three days left before the cheating couple got married.

Jeanne was very calm. She calmly watched Jasmine act like a shy yet eager woman.

She put down her phone and looked at the time. It was 9:00 pm. Just as she was thinking of getting George to wash up and go to bed earlier, her phone rang.

Jeanne frowned.

To be honest, she did not like answering the phone at night.

She looked at the incoming call. “Monica.”

“Jeanne, I’m drunk.” Monica’s slightly drunk voice came from the other end.

“You’re drunk at 9:00 pm?” This did not seem like Monica’s style.

“Come and pick me up.” Monica did not explain. “King-T Club, room 999.”

After saying that, she abruptly hung up the phone.

Jeanne was a little speechless.

She took a deep breath and said to George, “Take a bath and sleep by yourself. I’ll go out and send your godmother back. She’s drunk at the nightclub.”

“Okay.” George nodded.

Sometimes, George was so sensible that Jeanne was very touched.

She got up and caressed George’s head. Then, she went to change her clothes and walked out of the room.

Downstairs, Jenifer and Jasmine were still in the living room preparing for the wedding. Besides them, Jenifer’s relatives from her mother’s family had also come.

According to the rules of South Hampton City, before a wedding, there must always be bridal guests. Usually, large families would let the bridal guests stay with them in advance. It was normal for them to spend three days and three nights together.

The hall that was originally filled with laughter and chatter became silent for a second when everyone saw Jeanne.

Jeanne walked out directly.

Someone said from behind her, “She didn’t even greet us. Despite being the eldest young lady, she isn’t as polite as us!”

Jeanne did not care at all. She used her phone to call for an Uber and arrived at the destination.

She did not like nightclubs, so she was not used to them and was also very unfamiliar with them.

Under the guidance of a staff member, she walked into room 999.

The door was opened.

Jeanne was stunned.

Other than Monica, there was also Finn, Nox, and... Fourth Master Swan.
