Chapter 298: Jeanne Stays, and Fourth Master Swan Confesses

Jeanne seemed to be comforting George.

George nodded obediently.

Jeanne patted George’s little head and brought him upstairs, returning to the room where he had been sleeping.

Lying on the bed, Jeanne could not sleep.

On the other hand, George was a child.

His sleepiness kicked in very quickly.

Very soon, Jeanne heard the sound of him snoring.

She smiled.

Sometimes, she really envied how young and ignorant he was.

…

The next day, Jeanne woke up naturally.

It was 11:00 am when she woke up.

It had been a long day.

Jeanne also had insomnia for a long time.

When she opened her eyes, George was not by her side.

She frowned.

Logically, George would wake her up when he woke up.

Jeanne hurriedly got out of bed because she felt uneasy.

She hurriedly went downstairs.

In the empty hall, there was no sign of George, nor was there any sign of Fourth Master Swan.

“Ms. Lawrence,” Teddy suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne hurriedly turned her head.

“Little Master Lawrence is over here,” Teddy said.

Jeanne followed Teddy to the back garden.

In the back garden, in a huge open-air swimming pool.

Jeanne watched Fourth Master Swan and George swimming in the pool.

It was early autumn, so it was not too hot or cold.

“Ms. Lawrence, don’t worry. The pool has a constant temperature,” Teddy quickly said.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She just watched as Fourth Master Swan taught George to swim.

George was weak in sports.

In fact, it was not that his body was not coordinated; it was that he was not interested in sports.

Kingsley had once thought of letting George go through a series of training, but Jeanne refused.

At least until George was 10 years old, he should give George a childhood that he liked.

Hence...

George could not swim.

At this moment, he was forced to swim, and he looked unhappy.

Even so, Fourth Master Swan could not see it, and he patiently taught George to hold his breath.

The adult and the child swan in the pool.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you want to go over—” Teddy did not get to finish his sentence.

Jeanne had turned around and left.

There were some things that she was not interested in.

Edward saw her leave.

He turned his eyes.

After she disappeared, he looked back at George, who was staring at him with his eyes wide open.

George was obviously unhappy.

He was unhappy that Edward had forced him out of bed early in the morning and thrown him into the pool.

He did not like swimming.

Despite that, Fourth Master Swan insisted on making him swim.

George was about to break down.

He said, “I can’t learn it.”

“Mm,” Edward replied.

“I’m going up.”

“Out of all the sports, I like swimming the most,” Edward suddenly said.

George frowned.

“I thought you would like it too.” Edward smiled.

‘You like it? Why must I like it too?!’

George was displeased.

“Since you don’t like it, come up.” Fourth Master Swan went up from the pool.

In fact, George often felt that Fourth Master Swan was very... baffling.

He followed him out of the pool.

Teddy hurriedly handed over their bathrobes.

The adult and the child walked into the hall.

They went upstairs.

Before they went their separate ways, Edward said, “After you shower, ask your mom to come downstairs for lunch.”

George did not answer and walked straight into his room.

Jeanne had washed up. She sat on the sofa in the room and held her phone. She seemed to be hesitating whether she should send a message to Kingsley or not.

She should have angered Kingsley very much yesterday.

It would take a week before Jeanne could go back.

Jeanne did not know if she should tell Kingsley about her situation.

“Mom,” George called out to her.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

When she returned to her senses, she put down her phone.

It was better for her to go back directly.

What should she say to Kingsley at this moment? He was probably furious.

She turned around and looked at George, who was drenched. “Didn’t you say that you don’t like sports?”

“Fourth Master Swan forced me.”

Jeanne smiled.

She said, “We’re living under someone else’s roof now.”

“That’s why I didn’t resist,” George said.

Jeanne nodded.

George walked into the bathroom and took a shower by himself. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After taking a shower, he changed into a set of dry clothes.

Jeanne blew George’s hair.

“Fourth Master Swan asked me yesterday if I was born with curly hair.” George suddenly asked.

Jeanne paused what she was doing. “How did you answer him?”

“I didn’t answer him.”

Jeanne smiled.

George was indeed a reliable and talented child.

Jeanne dried his hair, then brought him downstairs.

Downstairs, Fourth Master Swan was sitting elegantly in the living room.
