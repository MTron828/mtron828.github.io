1005 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

“Alright,” Gary agreed.

He was really amazed by Monica’s performance this time.

Perhaps he had really protected Monica too much back then. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

In fact, Monica was not as clueless as they thought. She could take care of herself and be capable of dealing with things.

“Oh, that’s right.” Monica suddenly thought of something and said, “Although the little boy’s death was not caused by our vaccine, it was ultimately related to our family. If Cardellini Enterprise weren’t plotted against, the little boy wouldn’t have become a scapegoat. So, I took the initiative to go to the little boy’s family to compensate and gave his parents 10 million dollars. I also promised that in the future, no matter the price of Cardellini Enterprise’s medicine, it would be free for them for life.”

“As long as you think your conscience is clear, you’ve done well.” Gary nodded.

Monica knew that her parents, like her, were most afraid of owing emotional debts and would only feel comfortable after paying them off.

“Dad, you have surgery tomorrow, so you should rest early tonight and conserve your energy!”

“Yes,” Gary replied.

Then, he really did close his eyes.

Monica fluffed the blanket for her father and turned the lights to the dimmest before telling her mother to return to go to bed.

The two of them slept on the same accompanying bed.

Monica, who had slept for most of the day, was not sleepy at that moment. However, she was afraid of disturbing her parents, so she pretended to be asleep.

Just then, she felt her mother getting up from the bed. Monica opened her eyes and silently watched as her mother walk to her father’s bedside and looked at her father.

After that, her mother bent over and gently planted a kiss on her father’s face.

Monica smiled, but her eyes were red. Sometimes, she would be deeply moved by her parents’ relationship.

She remained silent and looked at her mother’s gentle face under the soft light.

How lucky were they to have such a loving relationship?

Her mother looked at her father for a long time.

Just as she was about to return to her bed, Gary suddenly said, “Ruby.”

That meant the old man was not asleep at all.

Ruby, on the other hand, was a little frightened. However, Ruby quickly grabbed Gary’s hand when she saw his fingers moving.

Gary said, “Thank you for taking care of me recently.”

“It’s not hard.” Ruby smiled gently. “From the moment I married you, I was ready to take care of you for the rest of my life.”

“I don’t know what I did in my past life that allowed me to meet you in this life.”

“Silly man.” Ruby’s face was gentle.

Her hand had been holding Gary’s hand tightly.

Under the soft light, it was a very sweet scene.

“Ruby, I know that this surgery is actually very risky–”

“Honey!”

“Listen to me.” Gary was panting a little.

Ruby held it in.

“If I really don’t make it out of that operating table alive...” Gary paused for a moment.

Ruby’s eyes instantly turned red.

“Don’t be too sad. I’m very happy to have you and an obedient daughter like Monica in my life. I think I’m so blessed, and I don’t have any regrets,” Gary said with great effort.

“I don’t want you to say this.” Ruby’s voice was obviously choked.

“Ruby, a person’s life will have an end. If my end is tomorrow, I’ll be content. I’m just afraid that you and Monica won’t be able to accept it.”

“How can we accept this?”

“Although Monica has grown up a lot, in my heart, she’s still the little princess who needs to be pampered and loved. If anything happens to me, you must be strong. For Monica’s sake, you must also be strong. Do you understand?”

“Honey–”

“Also, if I really do go, don’t be a widower for me. Find a good old man who can take care of you and live the rest of your life,” Gary instructed.

It was as if he was giving his last wish.

By then, Ruby was crying so hard that she could not speak.

Gary’s eyes were also red, but she held Ruby’s hand and said, “Promise me that you’ll take care of yourself and Monica.”

Ruby nodded silently.

Meanwhile, Monica’s vision was already blurry, but she held it in.

That night, her mother stayed with her father on his bed for the entire night. The two of them fell asleep with their fingers crossed.

Monica, on the other hand, just looked at them deeply and did not sleep for the whole night.
