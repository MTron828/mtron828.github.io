921 Another Accident, Gary’s Illness Acts Up

On the plane.

Melinda was embarrassed by Lucy’s words, but she smiled shakily and forced herself to look innocent. She said, “I’ve always been a little too direct. I’m sorry if I’ve offended you in any way.”

“Are you being too direct? Or are you deliberately trying to drive a wedge between us?” Lucy glared at Melinda. “You know very well what you’re trying to do.”

“How could you misunderstand my intentions so badly? How could I have such thoughts?!” At first, Melinda was a little embarrassed, but now, she looked as if she had been greatly wronged. “Lucy, ever since I joined the Hills as an assassin, I’ve been loyal and regarded myself as a part of them. I only want the best for the Hills, so how did it become a provocation? What did I say today to piss you off? Was something I said not the truth? If any part of it was a lie, I will be struck by lightning!” Melinda said, filled with righteous indignation. It was as if Lucy had wronged her.

Lucy had been in the Hills for a long time, and Melinda was a newcomer. The weakness Melinda currently showed was proof she was being bullied by Lucy. Even though what Melinda had said was a little repulsive, everything happened just as she said. She had not made anything up and was just telling the truth. However, being mocked by Lucy made people feel that Lucy was not magnanimous enough. It was also because she had a guilty conscience and was afraid of what others would say.

Lucy looked at Melinda coldly and said, “We’re assassins. There’s no need for assassins to talk so much nonsense!”

“What nonsense did I just say?” Melinda became even more agitated. “I just... I just wanted to ease the tension between Mr. Hill and Jeanee. I also wanted to make them less angry, so I found a topic to brush it off. Was that wrong of me?! Lucy, could it be that you can’t wait for Mr. Hill and Jeanne to fight because of you?”

“Melinda!” Lucy had always been calm, but she was starting to lose control because of Melinda’s deliberate instigation.

“I’m not wrong!” Melinda said firmly. “Everything I’ve done is for the harmony of the Hills. I won’t stand you slandering me like this!”

The anger that Lucy had been holding back was slowly erupting.

As assassins were usually quiet, this kind of war was very rare. When there was conflict, they would fight directly. The Hills did not allow their assassins to kill each other. It was taboo.

Looking at Lucy’s expression, Melinda provoked her once more. “Or did you do something shameful and are afraid others would say it out loud—” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Smack!”

Lucy gave Melinda a hard slap across her face. The sudden loud noise stunned all the assassins on the plane. Melinda also looked at Lucy in disbelief. She had not expected Lucy to hit her.

Though...

She smiled evilly in her heart. She had been trying to provoke Lucy. She knew very well that Kingsley could not stand an assassin doing whatever they wanted in front of him. Kingsley’s authority was not to be violated. No one else in this world could do it except Jeanne.

“Lucy!” That was why Kingsley had spoken at that moment. He had already been extremely angry and now looked downright terrifying.

“Have you forgotten who you are?” Kingsley said coldly. “I’m the only one who can touch the assassins of the Hills. You can’t just hit them as you please! You’ve challenged my limits again and again! Do you really think that I won’t kill you?”

Lucy sneered. “So, in Mr. Hill’s mind, it’s considered touching Monica when I hit her, but Melinda’s mockery of me doesn’t count as touching me?”

“I wasn’t mocking you. I was just telling you the truth. I didn’t expect you to mind so much. Besides, I’ve been trying to explain my innocence because you’re mocking me.” Melinda explained hurriedly to make people think Lucy was bullying her on purpose.

Assassins were not usually good at arguing, but Melinda was an anomaly. Previously, Lucy thought highly of her and let her sleep with Kingsley. Other than her good looks and figure, it was also because she was more talkative than most assassins. She thought she could please Kingsley, and she really did.

“Let me remind you again. Do not cross my bottom line.” Kingsley looked at Lucy with an ugly expression.
