1334 An Encounter at Dinner and Finn’s Outburst

Monica smiled. She thought she must have been overthinking just now.

A man like Brandon was young and promising. Many women would fancy him. Practically speaking, he would not fall for her. She was older than him and even had a boyfriend. For someone as prideful as Brandon, there was no way he would fall for a woman who already had another man. His ego would not allow it.

“If you don’t have anything to do, go out and work. Don’t think that just because you bribed me, you don’t have to work. I’ve always been a person who distinguishes work and private matters.” Monica pretended to be serious.

“Capitalists,” Brandon commented. “They’re evil.”

Then, he left Monica’s office.

After leaving, the smile on his face gradually faded. There was even a trace of bitterness.

He liked her.

He truly liked her.

Feeling helpless, he lamented that their reunion was not at the right time again.

Later in the afternoon, when Monica was in a meeting, her phone rang.

She looked at the caller ID and hung up. She even muted her phone to prevent further distraction.

The meeting ended half an hour later. When Monica returned to the office, she gave her secretary a lot of instructions before picking up her phone to take a look.

She saw a missed call from Finn on her phone. It was the one during the meeting.

Finn would occasionally give her a call when she was busy.

Her fingers were about to call back when she saw that Finn had sent her a text. She clicked on it.

Finn wrote: [It’s 6:30 pm. Can you come to our department’s gathering?]

Monica looked at the time. It was already past 6:30 pm. When there was work, she would actually often work overtime.

She replied, “No, I still have dinner tonight.”

It was a rejection. Finn looked at Monica’s message for a long time.

“Okay,” he replied with one word before putting down his phone.

He was still at home as he thought if Monica agreed, he would pick her up directly. Alas, she declined his invitation.

Even so, he still had to go. As the head of the department, it was impossible for him to be absent. He had already received a few calls just now, stating that he had not arrived yet. He picked up his car keys and was prepared to leave.

“Finn, where are you going?” Patsy was watching television at his home. When she saw that he was about to go out, she could not help but ask.

“The department has a gathering, so I won’t be having dinner at home tonight. You can stay at home by yourself. Either you make yourself something to eat, with the ingredients in the fridge, or you can order takeout,” Finn reminded her.

“Can I go with you?” Patsy asked him pitifully.

In fact, over the years, she had gradually become less dependent on Finn. She was aware that he had his own family and the woman he liked. She grew independent.

For some reason, she felt insecure during this period of time, as if she was going to be forgotten by the world. She could not help but want to find someone to rely on. In this world, the only man she could rely on was Finn.

Finn could also feel Patsy’s low spirits during this period of time. He thought for a moment and nodded, “Okay.”

Tonight’s gathering was a department gathering with family members. There was nothing wrong with Patsy tagging along. No one said that a family member had to be a girlfriend.

As soon as Patsy heard that Finn agreed, she said happily, “Finn, I’ll go change right away. Wait for me for two minutes, it won’t be long.”

“Mm.” Finn nodded.

He suddenly had a feeling that he was needed. It felt good.

Back in Cardellini Enterprise, after Monica received Finn’s reply, she no longer cared about his department gathering. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Just then, Brandon happened to come to look for her to go to the celebratory dinner.

She left with Brandon after work.

Brandon sat in her car and asked, “Do you know about Chez Jeanne?”

“Yes.” Monica nodded. “Who doesn’t know about such a famous restaurant in South Hampton?!”

“I heard that the Chief likes to dine here.”

“Nonsense.” Monica rolled her eyes. “This is his business. Of course he likes it.”

“So it belongs to the Chief?!” Brandon had no clue.

It was just that he had eaten with a friend once and felt that the taste was quite good. Moreover, the ambiance was great, so he suggested it this time.

“But of course not now. It has become one of the businesses of the Winter family,” Monica said.
