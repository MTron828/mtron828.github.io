888 While the Wedding Was Going On

The reporters could not hold it in anymore. “Will the chief attend today’s wedding?”

“I can’t answer this question for the time being.” Reese had always been polite and understanding.

She looked dignified and imposing.

“I heard that many people from the political and business world have been invited to today’s wedding. Who will be attending?”

“They’re just some relatives and friends.” Reese tried to play dumb.

“Mrs. Ross, what was the betrothal gift and dowry for Michael and Monica?” A reporter suddenly asked.

“We don’t have so many rules. As long as the young couple has a good relationship, there’s no need for betrothal gifts or dowries.

“Mrs. Ross, are you saying that the two families don’t have any betrothal gift and dowry?”

“We didn’t ask for a dowry but had planned to give a betrothal gift. Even so, Monica’s parents didn’t want it. Their reason was the same as ours. They also said that it was fine as long as the two of them had a good relationship.”

…

Monica could not stand it anymore.

Despite that, it was good.

The more she made herself nobler, the more Michael’s face would be slapped.

Monica did not have the slightest bit of sympathy for Reese.

She could not wait for everyone to see Reese’s disgusting side at this moment.

Monica was a little excited.

At this moment, she heard someone say, “The groom is here!”

Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

Sarah quickly put down her phone and tried to close the door.

“Sarah.” Monica stopped her. “There’s no such ceremony.”

Sarah pouted but still obediently returned to Monica’s side.

With that, Michael appeared in Monica’s room just like that.

He was wearing a white suit.

Michael had never worn white before, but at this moment, he looked exceptionally good.

Monica just looked at him.

She looked at how calm he was, just like Brie.

It was as if nothing had happened yesterday.

Michael could face her very openly.

Similarly, Monica could also pretend that nothing had happened.

Michael walked in front of Monica, looking at her beautiful and dazzling white wedding dress.

The corners of his mouth curved up slightly.

Then, he knelt down on one knee and presented the bouquet of flowers in his hand to her. “Monica, I’m here.”

Monica just looked at him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She looked at the bouquet of champagne-colored roses in front of him.

She suddenly thought of her first wedding.

She remembered that no one had closed the door when Finn came.

There was no liveliness of a wedding.

Finn did not even announce his arrival. He just walked in front of Monica and waited for her to get up from the bed and leave with him to the wedding.

“Monica,” Michael called out to her.

Monica returned to her senses.

She smiled. “I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

Then she took the bouquet of flowers from Michael.

Michael got up from the ground and approached Monica. He bent over and picked her up from the bed.

Monica instinctively wrapped her arms around Michael’s neck.

If…

If this was a normal wedding ...

Perhaps she would be touched by Michael’s actions as a boyfriend.

However, this was not a normal wedding.

Even so… She could enjoy it.

At least, this was a wedding.

It was not the same thing that she did many years ago.

Michael put Monica into the wedding car.

The car drove straight to the golf course in the suburbs.

The best man and bridesmaid were sitting with them.

Monica observed Michael and Brie discreetly. From the beginning to the end, the two of them did not have any communication or eye contact.

They were really good at acting.

The car arrived at its destination.

Even though Reese had warned the media not to go to the venue, they still blocked the entrance.

After wasting a lot of time, the car managed to drive in.

Monica was directly sent to the dressing room to change into the main wedding dress, while Michael went to the wedding venue to greet the guests.

Brie stayed by Monica’s side the whole time.

The two of them were changing.

After changing into the main wedding dress, Monica sat in front of the mirror and looked at herself.

She was beautiful.

She was dazzled by her own beauty.

Nonetheless, what was the use?

She just could not find a good man.

“Cousin, your wedding dress is even more beautiful.” Sarah ran into her dressing room again.

Monica felt that she was like a haunting ghost.

“If only I had such a beautiful wedding gown when I got married. I’m so envious.” Sarah was full of anticipation.

At this moment, the image of Sarah and Finn getting married appeared in Monica’s mind.

‘F*ck.’

Monica’s heart was in so much pain that she couldn’t breathe.

“Get out, get out!” Monica waved her hand, somewhat impatiently.

Sarah pouted.

“Oh right, my friend wanted to come and congratulate you in person.” Sarah suddenly thought of the purpose of her visit.
