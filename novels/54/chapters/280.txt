Chapter 281: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

Jeanne walked toward the huge outer balcony of Fourth Master Swan’s bedroom and stood there, looking at the garden scenery of Bamboo Garden.

She said to Kingsley, “I can leave.”

“Do you need me to arrange for someone to come and meet you?”

“That’s not necessary,” Jeanne said straightforwardly. “It’ll only alert Fourth Master Swan. Don’t worry, I can escape from his place in one piece.”

“Jeanne, this is your last chance. If you miss this chance, I really can’t promise you anything anymore.” Kingsley was very serious.

“I know.” Jeanne nodded. “I won’t go back on my word.”

“Tomorrow, I’ll ask Miles to directly take George to the airport. As for you, be careful.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone.

After hanging up the phone, she leaned on the railing of the balcony.

Then, she saw Fourth Master Swan suddenly jump into a huge pool in the garden and swim crazily in it.

Jeanne smiled again, but she felt that it was very funny.

She still felt that Fourth Master Swan was a little childish.

He could clearly use the most direct way to relieve himself, but he chose every other way to torture himself to calm down!

Jeanne just silently watched Fourth Master Swan swim around in the pool.

After tomorrow, such a scene would never be seen again.

…

Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan spent their last day in a rather comical way.

The next day, Jeanne changed into an outfit.

Fourth Master Swan was cooking breakfast seriously in the kitchen.

He made toast, milk, and eggs.

Edward watched Jeanne get up and put the breakfast in the dining room.

Jeanne sat down.

She sat next to Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan was peeling a hard-boiled egg for Jeanne very seriously.

“Fourth Master, did you sleep well last night?” Jeanne asked.

When she asked, the hands of the man who was peeling the egg trembled.

It seemed that he did not sleep well.

“Me neither,” Jeanne said.

She did not sleep well either.

To be more precise, she did not sleep at all.

She had too many things on her mind.

In the end, she could not fall asleep.

She took the egg that Fourth Master Swan had peeled and ate it silently.

Edward also ate his food silently.

“I want to go out for a walk,” Jeanne said as she ate her breakfast.

Edward frowned slightly.

“I’m here every day. I want to go out for a walk.”

“Where do you want to go?” Edward asked.

“Anywhere is fine. I just don’t want to stay here,” Jeanne said bluntly. “I can’t do anything. I’ll suffocate to death.”

‘Can’t do anything?!’

The corners of Fourth Master Swan’s mouth twitched.

“Let’s go shopping. I have many clothes here, but shopping is still a woman’s nature,” Jeanne suggested.

“I’ll go with you after breakfast.”

“Fourth Master, when do you plan to let me go back?” Jeanne could not help but ask him. She continued, “As you can see, my injuries are almost healed.”

“In a few days.”

“George is still waiting for me at home.”

“Let him wait a few more days.”

“...” Jeanne gritted her teeth/ “I still have to go to work.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I asked for leave from your father.”

“...” Jeanne was speechless.

No wonder Alexander did not even call her these few days.

Of course, she did not think that Alexander would care about her. Nonetheless, since she suddenly did not go to work for no reason, Alexander would find fault with her!

Jeanne continued to eat her breakfast quietly.

In any case, it would be impossible for her to leave by herself today.

She looked at the clock in the living room.

It was 8:30 am.

It would probably be about 9:00 am when they left for shopping.

Kingsley must be on a private plane, and he must have arranged everything at the airport. There would be no need for security checks, but it would still take some time to get from the special passage to the plane, so Jeanne only had 1 hour and 40 minutes to slip away from Fourth Master Swan.

It should not be difficult.

Jeanne thought to herself and finished her breakfast.

After breakfast, Fourth Master Swan also changed into a set of clothes and drove Jeanne out.

In the most luxurious and top-class shopping mall in South Hampton City, Fourth Master Swan accompanied Jeanne to go shopping.

Jeanne bought a lot of things.

Since she was not spending her money, why not?!

The two of them walked into a luxury store.

Fourth Master Swan was very famous in South Hampton City.

Jeanne was also very famous here.

The shop assistants here remembered famous people very well. When they saw Edward and Jeanne arrive, they quickly went forward to welcome them. “Fourth Master, Ms. Lawrence.”

Fourth Master Swan nodded slightly.

Jeanne also nodded.

“Ms. Lawrence, we have a lot of new bags here. They’re all limited edition. You can take a look here,” the shop assistant quickly introduced.
