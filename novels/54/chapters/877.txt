878 They Gave Up on Each Other

“Have you told your parents about the dowry?” Reese asked without hesitation.

Monica looked at her coldly and did not reply.

“Mom, let’s not talk about this for now.” Michael refused.

“How can we not? You’re getting married soon!” Reese’s voice was high-pitched as if she had to answer immediately.

Michael was about to reply when Monica suddenly said, “Okay. Let’s talk.”

Michael looked at Monica.

Monica said bluntly, “Since we’ve chosen to get married, let’s make everything clear.”

Reese sneered with a disdainful expression.

The three of them returned to Michael’s study and sat on the sofa. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Monica said, “My family will prepare the dowry you mentioned previously, but there can not be a betrothal gift lacking.”

“You still want a betrothal gift?” Reese’s voice grew louder, her words clearly full of sarcasm. “Monica, you’d better check your own status. How dare you still have the cheek to ask for a betrothal gift? You’re already climbing up the social ladder by marrying our Michael!”

Monica was a little angry after hearing Reese’s words, but she suppressed it and said, “If I don’t get a betrothal gift, in return, my family won’t provide the dowry.”

“Monica!” Reese smacked the coffee table in front of her. “You’re being shameless again! What right do you have to negotiate with my family?”

“My parents didn’t raise me to not stand up for myself. Just because you want my family to take out thirty million as well as two luxury houses and a car for a dowry, does that mean we should? While I admit that my family has the means to pay, it should be mutual. Why should my family give unconditionally when yours won’t even give a single cent?”

“That’s because you’re unworthy! It’s your honor that we let you into the Rosses, and to allow you to marry our Michael is your greatest betrothal gift. You better know your place! I’ll warn you one more time. Not a single cent less for the dowry, and I must see it a week before the wedding. There won’t be a single betrothal gift. It’s up to you whether or not you want to marry him! If you don’t, many women do!”

Monica glared at Reese, unable to hide her anger anymore.

“You saw Brie just now. She’s an educated and well-mannered lady from a wealthy family. She’s better than you in every single way. I’m not afraid to tell you that Brie and Michael grew up together. If it weren’t for you, they would be the ones getting married now, and you wouldn’t even be in the picture. So you better know your place. Don’t lose more than you gain!”

“Enough,” Michael interjected. “This marriage is between Monica and me, and I’ll discuss the betrothal gifts and dowry with her.”

“There’s no room for negotiation!” Reese said coldly. “That’s the condition. Michael, if you dare give Monica the betrothal money behind my back or secretly give the Cardellinis this dowry, our relationship will be over!”

“Mom.”

“I won’t ever compromise on this matter with Monica. I was already kind enough to let her marry into this family,” Reese said firmly. “I don’t care how Monica grew up or how her parents indulged her. Once she enters the Rosses, she must follow our rules! Moreover, this rule will be from the moment of marriage. There’s no room for discussion!”

Michael seemed to be silent for a few seconds.

He did not want to have any conflicts with his mother regarding marriage! Since Monica was entering the Rosses, she should follow Rosses’ rules. She definitely could not do whatever she wanted like before.

When they were in a relationship, it could be said that they doted on each other in front of the media. However, once married, Monica would take his family name. Whatever she did would be closely related to the Rosses at all times. So she had to have the demeanor of a Ross, and he could not let Monica do as she pleased anymore. It was not a bad thing to let Monica understand this truth now, either.

He said, “Monica, prepare the betrothal gifts and dowry according to my mother’s instructions.”

“So this is what you meant when you said that you like me?!” Monica smiled sarcastically.

“What I meant was, I like you in a situation where there are no benefits involved,” Michael added.

Monica’s smile became even more sarcastic.

Fine. Since Michael put it so bluntly, she would not have any guilt in taking revenge.

“What if I don’t agree?” Monica faced Michael with a firm attitude.
