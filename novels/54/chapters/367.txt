Chapter 368: The Accident Is Just the Start

After that, he sat in the driver’s seat and drove to the hospital.

Monica kept looking out of the window, refusing to look at Finn, so she turned the back of her cold head to him.

On the contrary, Finn, who had never been the one to take the initiative to speak, suddenly spoke up.

“Did you fall in the bathroom?” Finn asked.

Monica sneered.

That person was so skilled at putting on airs that she really wanted to applaud him.

“I was out buying food,” Finn said. That was why he did not hear her calling for help.

However, Monica did not turn around as she did not believe him. To be precise, she was pretending not to hear anything he said.

Finn wanted to explain himself, but seeing how cold she was, he did not say anything more.

In fact…

If Monica paid more attention, she would have seen a serving of pasta on the dining table at home.

Apparently, it was from the most famous restaurant in South Hampton City that did not do delivery and had a line very early in the morning.

When the car arrived at the hospital, Finn opened the car door.

......

“Don’t touch me!” Monica got out of the car by herself.

Finn endured it and looked at her coldly.

Monica got out of the car with difficulty and leaned on her crutches.

Just like that, the two of them went to the orthopedics department, with Monica walking in front and Finn behind.

Finn briefly explained the situation to the doctor. “She fell a few times at home today. Can you check if she hurt herself again?”

“Why did she fall?” The doctor frowned.

He told them to take good care of her.

“She can be a little clumsy sometimes,” Finn explained.

Monica turned to look at Finn.

Yes, she was a little clumsy. She stuck out like a sore thumb. She was an idiot!

Finn noticed Monica’s gaze and turned to look at her as well.

Monica sneered.

In any case, she was useless in Finn’s eyes.

“Well, let’s take another x-ray,” the doctor suggested.

“Sorry for the trouble.” Finn smiled.

The nurse took Monica to get another x-ray done.

Once they got the scans, the doctor said, “Everything’s fine. It’s not as serious as yesterday. I don’t think she fell on her ankle, but you must be careful next time.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay.” Finn nodded.

After that, Finn left with Monica.

The orthopedic doctor and the nurse looked at the two of them — one at the front and the other at the back.

“Did Dr. Jones and his wife quarrel?” The nurse gossiped.

“Mrs. Jones is really ruthless. She bit Dr. Jones’s hand until it bled.” The doctor shook his head.

“That’s because Dr. Jones indulged her. It’s all because he dotes on his wife. A straight man like you won’t know anything. You deserve to be single.” The nurse spoke up for Finn.

“...”

In any case, in front of the female employees of the hospital, no one was allowed to speak ill of Dr. Jones, not even Dr. Jones’s wife.

…

In the hospital corridor, Finn called out to her, “Monica.”

However, Monica did not respond, so Finn walked in front of Monica.

Monica’s eyes moved as she glared at him fiercely.

In fact, once she calmed down, she did not know why she would break down to such an extent today either.

Thinking about it, it was actually a trivial matter. It was not worth making such a big fuss over!

“I’m going to the emergency and trauma department.”

“If you want to go, go!” she said to him.

“Can you head home yourself?”

Monica looked at him. “I know how to take a taxi.”

However, Finn suddenly picked her up.

Monica was shocked.

“If you don’t want to embarrass yourself in the hospital, don’t resist,” Finn said bluntly.

Monica gritted her teeth.

At that moment, Monica’s phone rang again, and she looked at her father’s call. She did not need to think to know that he was calling to urge her to go to the office.

She picked up the call angrily. “Dad, Finn won’t let me leave!”

The person on the other end of the call immediately fell silent.

Monica knew that no excuse other than Finn would work best.

To prove that she was not lying, Monica placed the phone next to Finn’s mouth. “Speak!”

“Dad, Monica can’t come to the company right now...”

“It’s fine, it’s fine. You, young people, have your own things to do, so it’s fine if you don’t come,” Gary quickly said.

At that moment, Monica had already put the phone back next to her ear when she heard her father say, “The plan is more important.”

Damn that old man! What was he thinking?

Monica abruptly hung up the call.

By then, they were at the emergency and trauma department, where Finn treated the bite marks on his hands.

It was real, and they were deep.

“How did you get bitten so badly?” the doctor asked as he cleaned Finn’s wound up.

It hurt just looking at it.
