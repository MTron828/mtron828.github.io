Chapter 804: Exciting and Intense, Rescuing Jeanne

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

His eyes narrowed when he saw K01 walking out with Jeanne in his arms.

At that moment, the emotions that Kingsley was hiding changed drastically.

He opened the car door with his eyes bloodshot and looked straight at Jeanne, who was in K01’s arms.

However, she was not moving at all…

In the end, he did not protect her as he promised and had broken his promise.

Kingsley’s eyes were extremely red.

At that moment, the assassins protecting Kingsley did not dare to look at him directly as they were afraid to see him in such an emotional state.

K01 stood in front of Kingsley and said, “She’s not dead.”

Kingsley’s body trembled visibly the moment he was about to take Jeanne from K01.

Then, he looked at K01.

“She’s not dead. In fact, she’s not even injured. I just knocked her out,” K01 explained.

Kingsley could not believe what he just heard.

She was not dead after falling from a height of 50 meters! How was that possible?

K01 was not a talkative person, so he carried Jeanne straight to Kingsley.

Kingsley hugged Jeanne’s warm body and could even feel her faint breathing.

It turned out she was not dead.

“Where’s Fourth Master Swan?” Kingsley’s eyes narrowed.

He could shift between emotions in just a split second.

After all, he was a Hill. He was just a tool to kill, so he did not have much emotion to speak of.

“He left.” K01 said, “Jeanne wanted to chase after Edward, so I stopped her by knocking her out.”

Kingsley nodded and said, “Go and find Fourth Master Swan.”

“Yes.”

“Capture him alive,” Kingsley ordered.

“Yes.”

K01 received the order and left immediately.

Kingsley sent a few assassins to follow K01 before he carried Jeanne back to the car and waited.

…

The night passed, and M Underground Organization was completely wiped out by Kingsley’s men.

However, Kingsley’s men had captured the ringleader of M Underground Organization alive.

The ringleader was in a sorry state. Covered in blood, he knelt in front of Kingsley with a scowl on his face.

Kingsley said, “This is the consequence of provoking the Hills, and there has been no exception for the past hundred years!”

The ringleader glared at Kingsley.

After all, the winner takes all, so the ringleader did not resist when Kingsley took a gun and pointed it at his head.

“Bang!”

The ringleader was immediately shot to death.

With his eyes wide open and his face covered in blood, the ringleader died in front of them.

From then on, a mafia that had just risen had disappeared.

When Kingsley returned to the car, Jeanne had already woken up.

After she woke up, she stayed in the car. She did not say anything, nor did she mention that she was going to look for Edward.

The car was filled with silence.

Kingsley also stayed quiet because regardless of the reason, Jeanne’s actions of jumping down from the high platform were unforgivable to Kingsley.

Kingsley would pursue the matter but not now.

With that, the car left slowly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Hills had also suffered heavy losses in this operation against M Underground Organization. 50 of their top assassins invaded, but only less than 20 of them remained. To the Hills, assassins were the foundation of their existence, and training top-notch assassins were not easy. They were one in a hundred, one in a thousand, or one in ten thousand. With so many of them dead now, the Hills had suffered a heavy blow, and it would take them some time to recover. However, since the Hills had wiped out M Underground Organization overnight, the other organizations that were tempted to attack the Hills did not dare to act rashly.

Therefore, no one dared to offend the Hills for a long time.

That move also allowed the Hills to establish power so that no one would dare to offend them.

The car drove off for a distance until Kingsley’s phone rang.

He glanced at the caller and said coldly, “Did you catch him?”

“I found him.”

Kingsley frowned.

“But we can’t beat him.” K01 said, “I need backup.”

“Five people can’t win against one person?”

“You’ll know when you come.” With that, K01 hung up and sent his location.

Kingsley’s expression darkened.

“Go here,” he instructed and projected the address onto the car’s navigation screen.

He wanted to see how capable Edward was.

Jeanne, who had been silent the entire time, turned to look at Kinglsey after hearing his instructions.

Kingsley said, “I’m going to deal with Fourth Master Swan.”

Jeanne pursed her lips and remained silent.

Kingsley also chose to remain silent.

The car headed in another direction and sped off.

Soon, they met up with K01, and Jeanne followed Kingsley out of the car.

K01 glanced at Jeanne, who also looked at him coldly.

K01 shifted his gaze and said to Kingsley respectfully, “He’s in front.”

Kingsley nodded and strode over.

All the assassins followed behind him.

Edward, who was fighting with someone, looked ferocious. He had already killed three assassins. Their deaths were extremely gruesome. It was as if they had been torn apart alive. The assassins who were still fighting with Edward were also being beaten up and could not fight back at all. They might even be killed in the next second.

Kingsley was stunned by Edward’s combat power, to say the least.

Not to mention the fact that jumping down from 50 meters did not hurt him, but all of Edward’s actions were beyond the capabilities of ordinary people.

Kingsley was even sure that he was no match for Edward.

His eyes narrowed. Then, he took out his gun and pointed it at Edward’s head.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She was well aware of how good Kingsley’s marksmanship was. If Kingsley raised his gun, he would not miss, and someone was sure to die…

With that, she left Kingsley’s side and ran toward Edward.

Kingsley’s expression darkened, and his grip on the gun tightened.

The moment Edward sent an assassin flying with a kick, Jeanne rushed forward and hugged him tightly.

“Edward, stop fighting! It’s me! I’m Jeanne!” Jeanne called out to him.

As she shouted her name, Edward, who had lost his mind, forced himself to stop because of what Jeanne said.
