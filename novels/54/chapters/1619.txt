Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She pursed her lips and did not say much. She was used to Nox’s behavior anyway.

When the elevator opened again, Nox stood at the door and did not go out. As such, Shelly and Benjamin, who stood further inside, waited for a while.

Seeing that Nox had no intention of going out, Shelly whispered to Benjamin, “Let’s go.”

As her voice was low, it sounded very gentle.

Upon hearing that, Nox felt like he was about to explode with anger because Shelly had never been so gentle to him. Especially recently, Shelly had never once looked at him without a long face, yet she was so gentle to Benjamin.

At that moment, Shelly and Benjamin walked past him and out of the elevator together. From behind, they really looked like a family of three.

Nox did not know what was wrong with him, but he just could not stand the way they looked.

He said to their backs, “Shelly, do you really think Benjamin likes you? I used money to get Benjamin to pursue you. Don’t think too highly of yourself!” Shelly stopped in her tracks, and Benjamin turned to look at Shelly.

Shelly eventually turned around and said, “I know.”

“You know? What do you know?” Nox strode up to her. “When you were still in school, Benjamin was so nice to you because I gave him money to pursue you so that you could leave me sooner. Do you really think there are men out there who truly like you?”

He just wanted to see Shelly angry. In fact, he could not wait for Shelly to be angered to death.

“When you told Benjamin about it, I heard it from outside the warehouse on the west suburb street. You were going to teach Benjamin a lesson, but in the end, you told him to pursue me. I heard everything.”

Nox stared at Shelly with wide eyes.

“At that time, in order to marry you, I followed you because Grandpa Winter said that if you slept with someone else within a year, you would be with me. I thought you went to look for a prostitute.”

Nox was furious. “Since you know, why are you still with him?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was not just talking about now but back then as well. Back then, she knew that Benjamin had ill intentions toward her, yet she still got together with him. She even allowed Benjamin to kiss her. How shameless was she?

“I had never been treated sincerely by a man before, so I wanted to experience what it felt like. Fortunately, I experienced it, and only then did I know how unbearable it felt to force myself to be with you. That was why I could let go of the so-called glory and wealth and chose to leave you,” Shelly said calmly.

Nox felt that he would be angered to death by Shelly one day.

“By the way, Ben has explained the situation to me. He really likes me. He’s not threatened by you, nor does he want your money.”

Ben? That sounded really intimate.

Nox said sarcastically, “Are you so stupid to believe it when says he isn’t threatened and doesn’t want my money?”

“At least you didn’t threaten him or give him money, right?” Shelly asked.

Nox was stunned.

“But he still treats me very well, and I think that’s enough,” Shelly said bluntly.

“You must miss having a man so much that you’re going crazy! I really admire you.” Nox did not say anything nice to Shelly.

If Shelly were not used to it, she would have been angered to death by Nox.

She said, “Yes, I just miss having a man. Fortunately for you, I don’t want you. I like all men except you.”

“Shelly, who do you think you are? Do I need you to take a fancy to me? All I need to do is wave my hand, and there are many women who like me. Who do you think you are?”

“I’m just telling you what I’m thinking. At the same time, I’m reminding you not to get close to me. We don’t like each other, so why bother?” “You better f*cking remember what you said!” Nox was furious.

What right did Shelly have to look down on him?

He was one of the most handsome and richest men in the country, whereas she was a single woman with a child and had nothing in her name. How could she say that she looked down on him? She must be sick!

Nox strode past them like he would feel disgusted if he stayed with them for even a second longer.

Bella watched as the man in front of her left. In her childlike voice, she said,

“Mommy, this man is really like the bad guys on television.”

Nox stopped in his tracks and clenched his fists. If Bella were not a three-year-old child, he would have beaten her to death.

Shelly suddenly covered Bella’s mouth. She was really afraid that someone like Nox would not even let a child off.

She said, “Don’t say it. If the bad guys hear you, they’ll get their revenge.”

Nox ran out of the hospital while cursing Shelly. He hoped she would meet a

scumbag that cheated her of her everything and made her regret it for the rest of her life!

“Let’s go,” Benjamin said when he saw that Nox had left.

At that moment, he seemed to be in a good mood. After all, judging from Shelly’s behavior, she really had no feelings for Nox.

Shelly let go of Bella’s mouth, and the three of them left together. As soon as she walked out of the hospital, she saw Nox, who had left earlier, surrounded by a group of reporters, probably getting interviewed about being cuckolded.

Shelly and Benjamin who was carrying Bella walked over from the other side. However, they did not seem to react to Nox being pestered by the reporters at all.

In their hearts, Nox was a stranger, and when a stranger encountered difficulties, it was naturally none of their business.

Nox watched coldly as the three of them drove away in a taxi like they were showing off to him..
