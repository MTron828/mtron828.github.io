1111 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

Jeanne returned to Kingsley’s side with her vision blurry.

Kingsley just looked at her coldly and said, “Jeanne, I told you to be prepared.”

She knew, but…

Jeanne was trying so hard to hold it in that she bit her lips until they bled.

Nevertheless, Kingsley was unmoved as he left Jeanne’s side and walked toward Edward.

Nox was standing behind Edward and was well aware that they would definitely die in that situation.

However, Nox still stood in front of Edward.

He was not very capable of much, but the only thing he could do was take a bullet for Edward. The only thing he had was to die before Edward.

“Nox!” Edward’s tone was heavy.

“Don’t try to persuade me,”

“I order you to leave!” Edward enunciated every word.

“I won’t listen to orders.” Nox was very determined. “I won’t let you die in front of me. There’s no way!”

His eyes were bloodshot as he faced the black gun in front of him.

Kingsley’s gun was already pointed at Nox’s forehead.

However, Nox did not move.

“Nox!” Edward called out to him.

“I don’t have any pursuits in my life, nor do I have anything I like. Playing with women is just to pass time. The only thing I’ve decided to do in this life is to be able to help you.”

“No need!” Edward said bluntly, “I chose this path myself. I don’t need you to be buried with me.”

“Since you’ve chosen it, it’s the right choice.”

“Nox!” Edward’s expression sank.

“Since it’s the right choice, I’ll die...” ‘With no regrets.’

Before Nox could finish his sentence, his vision turned black.

He was knocked unconscious by someone behind him and fell to the ground unwillingly. Just like that, he passed out.

Edward had schemed against him.

Of course, Nox could die for him, but it could not be because he wanted Nox to die with him when he chose to die.

The only reason why Nox would die for him would be because he could still live. He had more important things to do, so he could not die.

Nox sacrificing himself like that was not worth it.

Kingsley watched Edward’s every move.

Edward said, “Without me, Nox won’t be of much use.”

It was not that Nox could not do it. Rather, Nox would only listen to his arrangements, and once he had no orders, Nox would not do anything.

Kingsley did not make any promises to Edward.

Killing Nox was something he could do with a single thought.

He could let Nox die with Edward, but he could also let Nox live. It all depended on his mood.

He aimed at Edward’s forehead.

Once the bullet was fired, Edward would die instantly.

“Jeanne,” Lucy called out to Jeanne.

She watched as Jeanne stared at the scene in front of her, where Kingsley was about to kill Edward.

In the end, she could not bear to let Jeanne see everything.

“Don’t look,” she said.

‘Don’t look at such a cruel scene.’

However, Jeanne bit her lip and shook her head in refusal.

She did not hate Kingsley, but she wanted to send Edward off on his last journey. Even if it was too horrible to look at, she still wanted to look.

As she straightened her back, she felt Edward’s gaze on her.

The moment Kingsley’s gun touched Edward’s forehead, his eyes were fixed on her.

The two of them stared into each other’s eyes.

Edward opened his mouth and did not make a sound. However, he was saying, “Goodbye.”

They would never see each other again. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In the quiet night in the vast wilderness, a deafening gunshot suddenly sounded.

The loud noise did not come from Kingsley, but from behind him. Suddenly, after a gunshot, a barrage of gunshots followed one after another.

At that moment, everyone hid behind the car.

The next moment, a few cars drove over, and they threw a grenade at them.

Edward dragged Nox’s body and jumped to a slope at the edge of the field to hide. Meanwhile, Kingsley and the others also quickly retreated and dispersed.

The two cars were set on fire.

War seemed to have broken out at that moment.

...

Edward patted Nox’s face.

Nox opened her eyes and felt a sharp pain at the back of her head.

“Wake up,” Edward said to him.

Nox’s eyes widened as he looked at Edward.

Why was he not dead?

Edward hurriedly explained, “I don’t know whose men they are!”

“What do you mean?” Nox was baffled.

What had happened in the second that Edward knocked him out?
