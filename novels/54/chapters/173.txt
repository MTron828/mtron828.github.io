Micheal held his phone and told Melody clearly.

Melody fell silent for a few seconds again.

Micheal continued, “Mel, I thought you knew what kind of person I am.”

“In that case, I believe you,” Melody said bluntly, “In the end, in terms of politics in the Sanders, the only person I trust is you. I don’t even trust my other brothers and sisters.”

“I won’t let you down.” Micheal was solemn.

“When are you bringing Monica to see Jeanne?” Melody asked.

“It can’t be too early or too late. I estimate that it’ll be 10:00 am tomorrow.”

“Okay.

“I’m ready to lend you a hand.” Melody sneered.

“Hmm?”

Melody told Micheal her thoughts.

Micheal smiled. “Thank you for your support.”

“Micheal, I really hope that you can develop very well,” Melody said sincerely.

“I’ll do my best.”

The two of them ended the call.

Micheal’s eyes narrowed.

He would develop very well. What he was afraid of was that when he developed, Melody would have... Stepped down.

…

The next day.

Monica had been anxious for a day and a night.

At 10:00 am, she received a call from Micheal. He said that he had gotten through to someone and that she could meet Jeanne now.

Monica was truly grateful to Micheal.

That said, she was still thinking about Jeanne the most at this moment.

She did not even know what Jeanne’s life was like in the detention center!

Micheal came to pick up Monica at the Cardellini Enterprise.

It had been more than half a month since they last met.

“Monica.” Micheal reached out and took the initiative to hold Monica’s hand.

Monica was stunned. She turned her head to look at Micheal.

The palm of her hand was filled with his warmth.

Nonetheless, at that moment, for some reason, she wanted to leave.

It was just that…

They did not have a proper relationship at this time.

Despite that, Monica did not let go in the end..

Micheal said, “Don’t worry, I’ve asked around. Jeannie is fine inside. It’s a private room, so she won’t be ostracized and threatened by other prisoners. Moreover, Jeannie is someone with status, so the prison guards will take care of her more.”

Monica nodded.

Even so, before seeing Jeannie with her own eyes, she did not dare to relax.

The car soon arrived at the detention center in the suburbs.

Micheal went through a series of procedures, and Monica finally saw Jeanne.

Jeanne was a little surprised when she saw Monica.

She did not expect that Monica would be the first to see her through her connections. She could not help but look at Micheal.

Micheal was very polite. He said to Monica, “I’ll wait for you outside.”

After saying that, Micheal left.

It was as if he was giving them some privacy.

Jeanne watched him leave and was deep in thought.

Monica did not notice that much at that moment. When she saw Jeanne appear in front of her, her eyes turned red. “Jeannie, how are you?”

Jeanne regained her senses.

She regained her senses and looked at Monica. Her heart moved slightly, and she forced a smile. “I’m alright.”

“You always say it’s alright. Now that you’re in jail, you’re still saying it’s alright!” Monica was on the verge of breaking down. “Can you not be so strong-willed? I feel uncomfortable looking at you.”

“Monica, I didn’t commit a crime.” Jeanne did not explain further and told her bluntly.

“I know, I know you didn’t,” Monica said, “but what do we do now? I heard that there are both witnesses and evidence. The facts of the crime are very obvious. Who exactly did you offend?”

“Isn’t it obvious?” Jeanne looked at Monica.

From the moment Monica knew about Jeanne’s arrest until now, her mind was filled with the image of Jeanne being locked up in the detention center alone. In fact, she had not thought about the case.

At this moment, Jeanne did not say anything. However, after being reminded by her, Monica suddenly quivered and asked, “Is it that woman, Melody?!”

Jeanne nodded.

‘If this silly girl isn’t too emotional, she wouldn’t be stupid.’

“Could she have done this for Fourth Master Swan?!” Monica could not believe it.

Jeanne nodded.

“I knew she was sick!” Monica cursed and continued, “Fourth Master Swan doesn’t like her. Instead of finding fault with herself, she came to deal with you. This woman should be struck by lightning and drowned in a wicker basket!”

As compared to Monica’s excitement, Jeanne appeared much calmer. She said, “I didn’t do it. I’ll eventually clear my name.”

“What about Fourth Master Swan?” Monica suddenly thought of Edward.

Jeanne pursed her lips.
