Chapter 64: Moved

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the banquet hall, Jeanne subtly changed the topic.

West looked around and said, “I just heard that the Fourth Master Swan from South Hampton City is here.”

Jeanne kept her smile and did not reply.

“I’ve been looking forward to meeting him for a long time,” West muttered. At that moment, he turned around and looked at Jeanne. “Did you see him?”

“No.” Jeanne smiled very naturally.

West was a little frustrated.

Jeanne said, “Godfather, it’s getting late. You also saw that I’m feeling a little uncomfortable due to my ear allergy, so I’ll go back first. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“Okay.” West nodded. “Don’t go missing again.”

“Don’t worry.” Jeanne said a few words to West and left the banquet hall.

Since she had achieved her goal for the night, there was no need to waste any more time socializing.

She walked out of the hall’s entrance.

A worker walked over in a hurry.

Jeanne avoided the person, but at that moment, her shawl fell off accidentally.

At this moment, a few flashes of light appeared behind her, accompanied by clicking sounds.

Jeanne turned her head.

The paparazzi had run away with the SLR camera.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

The staff member hurriedly picked up the shawl on the ground for Jeanne with an apologetic look on his face. “I’m sorry, Miss, I’m really sorry...”

Jeanne took the shawl, nodded slightly and left.

She drove back to the Lawrence family’s courtyard.

In the hall, Alexander and Jenifer had left without anyone knowing. In any case, they had returned.

At this moment, they were clearly waiting for Jeanne in the hall.

“What’s your relationship with West!” Alexander shouted at her.

Jeanne was calm. “Didn’t you see? He’s my godfather.”

“Godfather?” Alexander stood up from the sofa and walked toward Jeanne. “Godfather? What godfather? Why didn’t I know that you have a godfather!”

“What do you know about me?” Jeanne asked. “After you chased me out of the Lawrences, did you ask about me? Did you care about me? You wouldn’t have known even if I died overseas years ago!”

“Jeanne!”

“I’m telling the truth!” Jeanne’s voice was also very loud, “So at this time, you don’t have the right to question me! I only need to take responsibility for the life I want to live. It has nothing to do with you!”

“Do you want me to chase you out of this family again?!” Alexander roared angrily. He was really infuriated by Jeanne’s words.

“Do you think I care?” Jeanne looked at Alexander. The smile on her lips was filled with contempt. “With my current conditions, what do you think the Lawrences have that are worthy for me to stay?!”

“You!” Alexander was really furious.

Jeanne turned around and left. As she walked, she said, “To be honest, I’m curious. Why do I still have to return to the Lawrences? After thinking about it, it’s probably...”

“Is George your illegitimate child with West?!” Behind her, Alexander’s furious voice was suddenly heard.

Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

She smiled.

It was just a very natural smile. There was no emotion to be seen.

Fortunately, she really did not have any feelings for her so-called “father”.

The reason she still stayed in the Lawrences was probably to seek justice for her mother and take back everything that belonged to her mother.

She did not say anything and went upstairs.

It was a waste to talk to the Lawrences!

Alexander saw how Jeanne ignored him. He was going crazy with anger!

At this moment, Jenifer was fanning the flames by the side. “Since she didn’t deny it, doesn’t that mean that she has admitted it?”

Alexander’s face turned completely dark.

Jenifer said, “I heard that West has a family and that his child is already very old. Is Jeanne interfering in someone else’s family? That’s too immoral! Today, she appeared in such a high-profile manner at the banquet and was even affectionate with West. She even called him her godfather. If this were to spread in the future, our family’s reputation...”

“Enough!” Alexander was furious. “You better discipline Jasmine and Joshua well. I know how to deal with Jeanne’s matter!”

“Yes, yes, yes. I won’t say anymore. You should also calm down.” Jenifer quickly tried to fawn over him.

At that moment, Alexander wanted to beat Jeanne to death! This time, she had returned to go against him!

…

Jeanne returned to her room.

George was sitting in front of the computer typing code.

Jeanne took a deep breath and walked toward her son with a smile on her face.

There was no need to affect her mood because of some unimportant people, much less George’s mood.

“What are you doing—” George directly closed the computer as soon as Jeanne asked.

Jeanne frowned. “I can’t look?”

“No.” George was very determined.

“What did Kingsley ask you to do again?” Jeanne asked.

George did not answer.

Jeanne patted George’s little head and scolded fiercely, “Kingsley, that exploiter. Stop working. Take a bath and sleep.”

“Okay.” George nodded obediently.

At that moment, it was obvious that his eyes were flickering.

George went to the bathroom to take a bath first.

Jeanne was a little tired and lay on the chaise longue in the room to wait.

She opened the French window and allowed the hot summer breeze to blow in. She then lit up a cigarette.

Actually, she rarely smoked, especially in front of George.

Occasionally, there were exceptions. There was no reason.

She took a deep breath.

In her mind, a voice echoed…

“Is George the illegitimate child between you and West?!”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

This was what her father was like. He would only think of her in the most despicable way.

At this moment, Jeanne’s phone suddenly rang.

Jeanne came back to her senses and picked it up. “Monica...”

“D*mn! I’ve only been away for a week, and so many things have happened to you!” Monica was rather excited.

‘What happened to me?!’

“Why didn’t you tell me that George is a genius!” Monica questioned, “Do you still treat me as your sister? Am I still George’s godmother? !”

“I wanted to surprise you.”

“F*ck!” Monica cursed, “Then why didn’t you tell me that you have a relationship with West, the CEO of MUK Group?!”

“Do you also think that we have a relationship?” Jeanne was very calm.

“Aren’t you his goddaughter?” Monica was straightforward.

“Do you really think I’m his goddaughter?” Jeanne smoked a cigarette and asked nonchalantly.

“Or what?” Monica was a little confused. “Could there be some kind of illicit relationship between you?! Stop joking. How’s that possible?!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Do you trust me that much? I’m not the same as before, and we’ve been separated for seven years...”

“It won’t matter even if we’ve been separated for 70 years!” Monica was resolute, “How can I not know what kind of person you are?! Don’t interrupt me on purpose. Quickly tell me your true identity now. Are you a super big shot? Are you like the main character of the TV series I’ve been watching? Once your mask falls off, will South Hampton City tremble?”

Jeanne could not help but laugh.

She was amused by Monica.

In fact, she was really... moved by her trust.

Jeanne put out the cigarette butt.

She said, “No, I only worked hard to live.”

“Don’t make it sound so deep. You know I don’t understand you since my grades are bad.” Monica was a little unhappy.

“I’ll tell you in the future when the time is right, but I can’t tell you now.”

“Why?”

“I can’t tell you either.”

“Jeanne!” Monica was going crazy.

“Monica.” Compared to Monica’s excitement, Jeanne’s voice was much gentler. “Thank you.”

Monica was moved. Jeanne was suddenly so emotional, she was somewhat taken aback.
