1242 Susan’s Arrival

After all, she was still human and had the basic emotions and desires a human should have. When she saw the man she once loved so much behaving so loving with another woman, she would also get emotional. That emotion was an instinct, just like how she would laugh when she was happy and cry when she was sad. She would not blame or hate anyone.

Therefore, she really did not need anyone to give her advice. She understood the logic. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Finn held back the words he was about to say.

He knew that Jeanne was more rational and smarter than most people.

Now that things had come to this, Jeanne knew why it all had to happen, and it was useless for him to say too much. However, there was one thing he had to say.

When Finn saw Jeanne, he said seriously, “Don’t give up on Fourth Master.”

Jeanne’s lips curled into a faint smile.

To her, there was no such thing as giving up hope. After all, there was nothing to be hopeful about. At that point, their relationship would not develop any deeper.

Very naturally, they changed the topic to what to take note of in the later stages of pregnancy.

Teddy bought the medicine that Finn had specified as fast as he could and handed it to Finn while panting. It looked like he had done a 100-meter sprint.

In fact, Jeanne sometimes felt that she was not too miserable. At least, many people still treated her sincerely.

Finn took Teddy’s medicine and gave Jeanne one pill. He then listened to her heartbeat and confirmed that she was fine before leaving.

After leaving, Teddy and Jeanne were the only ones left in the room. Jeanne was resting on the bed while Teddy stood guard.

When Finn left, he told Teddy to keep Jeanne company for a while, for fear that Jeanne would have a reaction to the drug. Although it was only a vitamin, everyone had different tolerance for drugs and food. If she were not used to the medicine, it would be very dangerous.

Teddy was really responsible when it came to Jeanne’s health.

Jeanne did not feel sleepy at the moment. However, since Finn told her to try her best to rest in bed for a while, she could not go anywhere.

With nothing to do, Jeanne suddenly said, “Teddy, why don’t you sit on the sofa?”

Teddy quickly shook his head. “It’s fine.”

“Have a seat. Just looking at you is making me tired.”

Then, Teddy sat down obediently.

“You’ve been with Fourth Master for many years, right?” Jeanne suddenly changed the topic.

“Not really. I used to be with the Old Master.” Teddy said, “I’m an orphan like Dr. Jones. I was actually raised by Old Master Winter and took care of Old Master Swan with him. Later on, because Fourth Master was seriously injured once, Old Master Swan told me to come over and help take care of the Fourth Master. Since then, I’ve been by the Fourth Master’s side.

“It hasn’t been long, but I can’t believe you’re so loyal to him,” Jeanne said faintly.

“Fourth Master is actually a good person.” Teddy said seriously, “He’s usually cold, but he’s really a good person. Since he treats me well, I’ll definitely treat him well.”

“Yes.” Jeanne smiled.

She did not question their relationship. She was just thinking about her children and figured that they would be treated well under Teddy’s care.

“Teddy, help me up,” Jeanne called out to him because she wanted to go to the toilet again.

Teddy hurriedly stepped forward and helped Jeanne up.

At the door, Edward just looked at them and watched how close Teddy was to her.
