1291 Edward and Candice’s First Date

“If you succeed, will you stay in Cardellini Pharmaceutical long-term?” Monica asked.

“Since I’m back in the country, I’m looking at the long-term.” Brandon looked at Monica. “I’m not someone who likes change very much. Back then, I only worked in a company overseas and rose from the bottom step by step. To me, since I’ve decided on something, I won’t change my mind easily.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

The only thing she was worried about for a talent like him was his instability.

For a corporation, change was not something favored. The change in personnel was too frequent, especially for the leaders of important positions.

The interview was over. The candidate with the highest overall score was Brandon, who even Steve supported.

Steve had always valued young people and had always wanted to give them a chance. He always said that the current market was for youths, so he should not keep to his stubbornness to restrict young people to develop. In other words, young talents could have the ability to sit in a higher position.

Sometimes, Monica felt that Steve was indirectly praising her.

After all, ever since she revived Cardellini Pharmaceutical, she seemed to be able to feel Steve’s inexplicable admiration for her.

Truth be told, she was not all that powerful.

Actually, she wasn’t that powerful.

If not for Fourth Master Swan’s ten billion dollars, she could not have made it too.

Monica returned to her office.

Tim made her a cup of black coffee.

The moment Monica picked it up and was about to drink, she paused. She was reminded again of what Finn said about wanting children.

She was thinking perhaps she should not drink coffee, so she silently put the cup down.

Honestly, she did not know how to feel about it.

She did not know what kind of relationship she had with Finn and how far they would go. She had no idea if the two of them were even considered a normal couple or even… husband and wife.

Was it right to even give birth to Finn’s child when she herself was not sure about her feelings?!

However, her gut was telling her that Finn was not joking. That man had never made a joke.

Did that mean, for Finn, who was already thirty-four years old this year, could really have the urge to have children at this age?

On second thought, Edward, who was the same age as Finn or younger, already had two children. The older one would be able to start dating in a few years.

Monica could not help but smile faintly. The thought that George might be in love was inexplicably comical.

She wondered how interesting it would be if George really fell in love with a girl, or if a girl fell in love with him.

Alright, she had digressed.

In the end, Monica did not touch the cup of coffee.

She thought she ought to have a deep discussion with Finn about having a child.

After all, they were talking about a kid here.

Her relationship with Finn needed to change completely!

They could not stay like this, where they looked harmonious but were actually at odds with each other. No matter what, the child needed a loving family.

That was what Monica thought.

There was another knock on the door.

“Come in.”

The person who pushed the door open was Brandon, who had just applied for the job today.

Monica was a little surprised. He should have been notified of his successful application, so should he not be going through the induction process now?

He was required to report to the company tomorrow.

“Chairman.” Brandon walked towards her. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“What’s the matter?” Monica asked calmly.

Having been in the business world for so many years, Monica was used to handling things calmly.

Brandon did not reply.

There was a sudden silence.

Monica frowned.

Was there something wrong with this person?!

They had just signed the employment contract. It could not be that he wanted to compensate with a huge sum of money to cancel it even before his first day of work right?

Monica was lost in her own thoughts.

Brandon suddenly laughed. There was a little dimple at the corner of his mouth.

This dimple made Monica’s heart skip a beat.

She looked straight at Brandon and instantly seemed to remember who this person was.

“Yes, it’s me. You called me Little Tail when you were young.” Brandon seemed to be able to tell that Monica had remembered him.

It was obvious. He could recognize her at first glance, but she had obviously forgotten about him.

“Didn’t you go overseas?” Monica could not help but ask.

She had indeed remembered who this fellow was.

The Hayes family was actually one of the twelve families of the older generation in South Hampton. Of course, they still were now. It was just that at that time, because the Hayeses focused on foreign markets, and after the entire family moved, almost no one mentioned the Hayes family anymore. Most of the Hayes family’s industrial chains should be overseas now.
