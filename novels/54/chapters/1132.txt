1133 The War Has Started: The Battle of Wits Between Jeanne and Edward

“I know that very well.” Warren was a little angry when he spoke. “I’ve really learned a lot recently. I thought that with your relationship with Edward, he would at least give me some respect, but really... he doesn’t even care about you.”

He deliberately tried to drive a wedge between them.

However, Jeanne did not agree with him.

Warren continued to put on a show. “In the end, Edward even killed Kingsley. The more I think about it, the angrier I get! Jeannie, don’t worry. I will definitely avenge you.”

“Thank you, father.” Jeanne did not want to put on an act with him as she felt tired.

Hence, she said, “Father, I’m a little tired. I want to go back to my room to rest.”

“I’ll send you back to your room,” Warren quickly said.

Jeanne shook her head. “It’s alright. You have more things to do. I shall not waste any more of your time.”

“Alright. Go back to your room and have a good rest. Don’t think too much. I’ll be here for you.”

“Yes.”

With that, Jeanne nodded and left the study.

Mason had been waiting for her outside the study and would not leave even a single step.

Everyone knew that they were walking on thin ice here, and if not careful, they would be doomed.

In the study, Warren’s expression darkened as soon as Jeanne left.

Naturally, Chester’s expression also changed.

He asked Warren, “Can Jeanne be trusted? Could it be a show by Jeanne and Edward?”

“I don’t think so. I’ve secretly investigated Kingsley and Jeanne’s relationship, and it’s true. Since Edward has killed Kingsley with his own hands, it’s reasonable for Jeanne to want to kill Edward. Most importantly, she must be my daughter. Once I fall from power, do you think the Duncans will tolerate her? Don’t look down on Jeanne. Although she didn’t grow up by my side, her abilities are definitely not inferior to yours and your sister’s. I know that she’s not a simple person from her series of operations in the business world. Take Michael for example. Didn’t Qiao Qing easily take him, a talent I thought so highly of, down?” Warren said sinisterly, “Since Jeanne is smart, she knows what she should be doing now. It’s obvious that her only choice is to help me stabilize the Sanders’ regime.”

“You’re right, father, ” Chester said respectfully. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Learn from Jeanne in the future.” Warren said, “Harken will be yours one day. You can’t let me down.”

“Yes, father.”

“Of course.” Warren’s eyes narrowed. “Just in case, we still have to keep an eye out on Jeanne’s every move. Although Jeanne might have already given up on Edward, they still have a son, George, and I’m afraid that he’ll drag her down.”

“You mean that Jeanne might give up on killing Edward because of George.”

“Now that George is in Edward’s hands, if Edward uses George as a threat, it’ll be hard to guarantee what Jeanne will do! So...” Warren’s face darkened, and he said cruelly, “When necessary, don’t show George any mercy.”

“Yes.” Chester nodded.

There was also a sinister look on his face.

..

Jeanne returned to the bedroom in the Sanders’ residence that the Sanders had prepared for her.

She was in this room with Edward just yesterday, and from today onward, they would be facing off against each other.

The next time they meet, only one of them would live.

Jeanne sat on the sofa in silence for a long time.

As she thought of Kingsley and Lucy, her eyes reddened. However, she forced himself to calm down.

Before she could take her revenge, she did not have the right to feel pain!

…

At 9 a.m. the next day, the Swan family’s manor was suddenly surrounded by the police.

After a night of preparation, the Sanders found a reason, which was that the Swan Enterprise had an illegal business transaction with another country and caused huge losses to Harken’s economy. The police detained all the people involved with Swan Enterprise and blocked all of the company’s economic and trade dealings at the same time to conduct a thorough investigation.

As a result, Swan Enterprise’s finances were temporarily controlled by the Sanders, and the Swans were naturally shackled by the Sanders.

The person who led the arrest was Chester Sanders. As the fourth young master of the Sanders, it was natural for him to handle the matter personally, and the matter was not a trivial one.

He stood in front of Edward and took out the arrest warrant. “Someone anonymously reported Swan Enterprise’s illegal profit-making that has caused a huge loss to the country. We need to bring the person in charge of Swan Enterprise back for interrogation. Fourth Master Swan, please come with us.”

Edward looked at Chester and sneered. “I didn’t expect the fourth young master of the Sanders to come personally.”

“The Swans are the most loyal family to the Sanders. My father has specifically instructed us not to mistreat you. Fourth Master, please don’t make things difficult for me so that I can go back and report to my father.”

“Why would I make things difficult for you?” Edward said, “Since the Sanders think that I have done something wrong, I naturally have to follow you back and be investigated.”

“Thank you for your understanding, Edward.” Chester gestured.

The two police officers behind Chester stepped forward and cuffed Edward’s wrists.

Edward’s eyes narrowed as it crossed his mind that the Sanders might find some groundless charges.

He did not expect that they would act so quickly. In fact, they were even faster than him.

However, he did not resist and was taken away by the Sanders.

After all, he could not resist. The moment he resisted, it would mean that he had really done something wrong.

Once he did something wrong, the Sanders would have enough reason to brazenly punish the Swans.

The Duncans, on the other hand, had never thought of taking over the Sanders’ power in such a way.

In order for the Duncans to better manage Harken, they needed to use a reasonable method to replace the Sanders’ position.

At that moment, other than Edward, Elaine, Richard, Nox, and all the members of the Swans who worked in Swan Enterprise were also detained.

As for Zachary, because he had retired for many years, and because the Sanders deliberately wanted to show their respect to him and the Swans, they did not detain him. However, it was clearly stated that Zachary could not leave South Hampton City, and if needed, he could talk to him at any time.

Just like that, the entire Swan family was brought to the police station.

It was so smooth that even Warren found it unbelievable.

...

He asked Jeanne, “Do you think something is fishy about this?”

“It’s hard for me to guess.” Jeanne said, “Instead of wasting time thinking about why Edward would compromise so easily, it’s better to ask him directly. Since he’s in our prison, we can do whatever we want!”

“That makes sense.” Warren said, “Let’s go and meet Edward now. Jeannie, do you want to go?”

“Yes.” Jeanne said bluntly, “If I don’t go, I won’t be able to find out what Edward is planning in secret.”

“That’s good.” Warren nodded. “I’m just afraid that you haven’t gotten over him.”

Jeanne smiled.

There was nothing that she could not get over.

She had no feelings for anyone now.

With that, Warren brought Chester and Jeanne to the Sanders’ higher-class prison.

Only important people would be imprisoned or detained here if they committed a crime. It was obvious that to the Sanders, the Swans were not an ordinary family.

Under the guidance of the staff, Warren walked into the room where Edward was being held.

...

Edward looked up and saw Jeanne standing beside Warren.

It turned out that she had chosen to return to the Sanders.
