Thank you readers!

Nox gritted his teeth. He was not in the mood to know anything else about

Shelly, so he scrolled throug it.

Worried, he opened Shelly’s Whatsapp. Perhaps that woman was smart enough to post the photo directly and delete it from the album.

The moment he clicked on her Whatsapp, Shelly blocked it with her hand.

“Shelly!” Nox’s eyes narrowed.

“It’s my privacy.”

“Privacy? You’re hiding something, aren’t you?” Nox was certain.

“I told you, I didn’t take any photos of us. Since you disgust me so much, why would I take any photos?” Shelly said bluntly.

“Who are you calling disgusting?” Nox was furious.

“You’re disgusting!” Shelly refused to be submissive anymore.

“Shelly, what are you up to this time?” Nox looked at her coldly. “You were the one who tried to climb into my bed back then, and you call me disgusting? Why don’t you say that you’re the disgusting one?”

“That’s right. I only found out after I slept with you that such a disgusting thing existed in this world.”

“Shelly, you were the one who plotted to climb into my bed back then. How dare you call me disgusting?!”

“I was young and insensible back then. Now that I think about it, I regret it so much!”

“Shelly!” Nox was so angry that he wanted to strangle the woman.

Shelly always had a way to piss him off. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If you want to look, do it. Hurry up!” Shelly moved her hand away from her phone screen.

In any case, Nox was not interested in her life.

Nox glanced at Shelly coldly.

That woman was smarter now and knew that he was disgusted with her, so she resorted to misdirecting him first.

He had seen too many women trying to please him, and Shelly thought she could attract his attention by doing the opposite. However, there was no way he would fall for it!

With that, he scrolled through Shelly’s chat history. Shelly did not have many friends, and most of them seemed to be transaction records of money.

Nox did not even think about it before he blurted out, “Shelly, are you an escort?”

“Yes, I am,” Shelly admitted.

“Are you f*cking crazy?” Nox’s face was ashen, and he looked terrifying.

Shelly was still stunned by Nox’s expression. She was afraid that he would lose control and really kill her.

“Are you that shameless?!” Nox questioned her.

Shelly did not answer him because there was no such record. Those transaction records were only the remuneration she received for her part-time jobs. She only answered Nox earlier about being an escort so that they would not have anything to do with each other.

Anyway, in Nox’s heart, the more embarrassed she was, the better he felt.

“You seduced me just now for money, didn’t you?” Nox’s expression made Shelly feel like he wanted to kill her.

Shelly bit her lip. At that moment, she did not answer, for fear that she would anger Nox.
