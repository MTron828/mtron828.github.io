Chapter 375: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

He gave a look to his subordinate beside him.

His subordinate understood and hurriedly picked up a rock on the ground and threw it out. Just as he threw it out, the rock was shattered by a single shot.

At the same time, Nox aimed in the direction of the shot and fired, immediately shooting down the other party.

Just like that, the gunfight started again, and countless gunshots rang out beside Nox, who rolled a few times on the ground and dodged.

However, the moment he stopped, the man from the other direction raised his pistol and aimed it at Nox’s head.

“Bang!” The bullet burst out.

Nox’s body tensed up.

He, too, realized that he was in danger, but there was no way to avoid it. Hence, he gritted his teeth and was ready to accept it when he saw the man, who was about to pull the trigger, fall.

Nox did not dare to stop and quickly hid to the side. As he hid, countless gunshots rang out beside him.

He turned his head to look at Jeanne.

Jeanne’s shooting skills just now... really surprised him.

It was just one shot, and it directly hit the middle of the other party’s forehead. However, that shot also prompted countless gunshots to aim in her direction.

She had not fired a single shot since the start of the fight, so the other party did not know she was hiding.

......

At that moment, it was obvious that she had exposed herself.

Under the firing of the gunshots, Nox was quite some distance away from her.

Jeanne gritted her teeth as she could feel that someone was approaching her.

As the footsteps were getting closer and closer, she tensed up and aimed at the position behind her before firing a shot.

One person fell, but the other person…

Jeanne’s eyes moved a little, and she just stared at the black muzzle of the gun aimed directly at her forehead.

The moment the bullet shot out, Jeanne’s body was in pain as her entire body fell backward and to the ground.

However, she was still alive.

A man in front of her had jumped out from the side, put himself in front of her, and hugged her as they fell to the ground.

The man who protected her was Nox’s only remaining subordinate.

Yet now, in order to protect her, he was on the ground in front of her, lying in a pool of his blood.

Jeanne was a little shook for a moment, and her fear of death had made her entire face turn pale.

If not for that person saving her, she would be the one dead instead.

She would really be dead.

In the meantime, Nox killed the man who fired the gun in an instant before he quickly ran over from the side, grabbed Jeanne, and left in a frenzy.

Not many people were behind them but seeing them escape, those men chased after them. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The two of them ran for some distance.

Even then, those men were at their tails, refusing to give up.

Nox grabbed Jeanne and said loudly while panting, “I’ll distract them!”

“Nox!” Jeanne called out to him, “I’ll go!”

“Jeanne!”

“The watch is with me, so I’ll distract them. Get someone to come and get me!”

“Okay.” Nox did not decline.

He had to say that it was best for Jeanne to distract them.

During that time, he could call the others back to support him. Then, with the GPS on Jeanne’s hand, he would be able to find her and support her immediately.

While Jeanne quickly ran to the side, Nox hid in the forest and felt the group of people leaving.

Once he was sure that everyone had left, Nox asked in the locator, “Has anyone found Fourth Master Swan?”

“Not yet.”

“We haven’t found him here either.”

“Team A will come and pick me up while Team B continues with the search. As soon as there’s any news, inform me immediately.”

“Yes!”

Nox’s eyes narrowed.

He waited for a few minutes before Team A returned to his side. The entire time, he had been observing Jeanne’s movements.

As long as she was still walking, it meant she was alive.

Hence, he quickly led a group of people to chase after her.

Both of them were very fast, so once they pulled out the distance, they would only draw further and further away from each other.

Fortunately, Jeanne was much smarter than he thought.

He observed Jeanne’s trajectory and knew she was running in a circular arc. In other words, he could take a shortcut to get closer to Jeanne faster.

Nox could not help but be a little surprised.

For Jeanne to think of those things under such circumstances, she was really not a simple woman.

He followed the pattern of Jeanne’s escape and quickly ran over from another direction.

As expected, it did not take long before Nox saw Jeanne from afar, running madly in front of him.

He did not know if it was because she was exhausted or if she really did not notice what was under her feet, but Jeanne suddenly fell to the ground.
