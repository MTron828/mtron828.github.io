871 Step by Step, the Proposal

“No. I’m not interested in that,” Monica replied.

Michael didn’t say much. “The wedding will be held at a golf course outside South Hampton City. We’ll limit the guest list to less than a hundred families. I know you have more relatives and friends, so tell your parents they can invite sixty families at maximum, and us Sanders will have forty.”

Monica nodded.

“The wedding planner will update us on the rest of the details in a few days. As for the wedding dress, we’ll try it on a week before the wedding.”

“Alright.”

“As for the betrothal gifts and dowry…” Michael said. “I’m not going to ask for any dowry. Feel free to ask if your family needs any betrothal gifts, but I can’t guarantee that I can satisfy them all.”

“No!” Reese suddenly interjected.

Michael and Monica looked at her.

“I don’t care about the other things, but we’ve got to have the dowry.”

“Mom,” Michael called out to her.

“No. Monica marrying into our family is already a social climb for her. We can’t let her take all the advantages. The Cardellinis should also express their gratitude.”

“What do you want from us?” Monica asked.

“Thirty million in cash, two exquisitely-decorated houses of more than two hundred square meters in the center of South Hampton City, and a luxury car worth more than five million.” Reese seemed to have thought about it beforehand and blurted it out.

Monica gritted her teeth. This woman really knew how to talk.

“If it can’t be done, I won’t agree to this marriage.” Reese was certain.

Michael hesitated for a moment, then looked up at Monica. “It shouldn’t be difficult for you.”

It was not difficult, but she was furious!

Why was it that when others married off their daughters, they would send money into the family, but when she married out, her family still had to lose so much money?

“Alright,” Monica agreed.

She had no choice but to agree.

In Michael’s opinion, if she did not agree, the marriage would not be accepted. This meant Cardellini Enterprise would not be able to protect itself.

Thus, Monica did not reject the request.

“There’s less than a month until the wedding. You better know your place. I don’t want to use my methods against you,” Michael threatened.

Monica did not respond.

“I’ll send you back.” Michael stood up. There was no delay once he finished speaking.

“No need. I can take a taxi back.” Monica refused.

Michael looked at Monica coldly as she left.

Reese stared at Monica’s back and turned to her son, saying fiercely, “You can’t indulge a woman like Monica. The more you let her be, the higher her tail will be. After you two get married, let me teach her a good lesson. She must be obedient to you in the future.”

Michael did not answer. It was considered a silent agreement. He felt that he should indeed let Monica learn how to behave herself.

…

Monica took a taxi home.

After saying a few words to her parents, who had been waiting for her, she quickly returned to her room. Then, she called her advisor, Jeanne.

“How was it?” She asked about her performance at the press conference.

“Hehe.” Jeanne laughed coldly.

Monica’s hair stood on end at the sound of her laugh.

“Did I not do well enough? Didn’t you say to let Michael perform so his ego would soar? I’ve been playing along with his performance.” Monica said, a little agitated.

“It was pretty good, but…”

Jeanne’s ‘but’ always frightened Monica.

“You’ve really blocked your marriage this way.”

“What kind of marriage could I have?” Monica had thought it was something important.

“So you don’t want to get back together with Dr. Jones?”

“Stop joking,” Monica said. “I’ve already made myself like this. How can we get back together? He couldn’t even work it out back then, let alone now. I’m prepared to die alone.”

“Alright, then.” Jeanne did not say anything else. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Based on the current situation, It did not seem like Monica and Finn would be able to reconcile.

However, as long as Monica figured it out, no feelings could not be washed away by time.

She had liked Eden before and then not at all. In fact, she could not even remember what it felt like to like him.

Jeanne returned to the main topic. “So, we have achieved our first step, which was to let Michael be praised by the world and have a good image. Now it’s time to make Michael reveal himself in front of the public.”

“Yeah.” Monica nodded her head, looking very serious.

“Does Michael have any female friends other than you?” Jeanne asked.

“…Uh…” She did not know.

“I don’t think so.”

In her memory, Michael’s only friend was Eden. She did not know anyone else.

Only now did she realize that she might have never loved Michael before. She did not even know what kind of people Michael had around him, but she knew Finn and the people around him very well, including those female seductresses, no, female nurses in his hospital department.

“I only know about Melody, but she’s dead,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“You’re looking for one of Michael’s female friends to trick him into sleeping with him?”

“It’s easier to scheme the people around you. A random prostitute will easily arouse Michael’s suspicion.” Jeanne made it clear.

“Then I’ll keep an eye on him and see if such a person exists around Michael or in his work circle.”

“That’s right. His work circle.” Jeanne suddenly agreed with Monica. “It’s impossible that no one likes a capable young man like Michael. Once this person exists, what we have to do next will be much smoother.”

“I’ll be sure to find out,” Monica said.

“Careful not to alert the enemy. Michael’s level of caution is beyond our imagination!” Jeanne reminded.

“Alright,” she said.

“Oh, yeah.” Jeanne suddenly thought of something. “How did Michael’s mother treat you?”

“You mean Reese?” Just the thought of her made Jeann angry.

Probably. She did not quite remember Michael’s mother’s name.

“That woman hates me to death because I made a cuckold out of Michael. In addition, I’ve been lukewarm towards Michael, so she thinks I’ve sullied her son! When I went to their house to discuss the wedding today, I was slapped in the face by her. She even asked me for a large dowry sum, making me look like a good-for-nothing woman.” Monica’s words were filled with righteous indignation, giving people the wrong impression that she was not too sad.

In reality, Monica was not as heartless as she appeared to be. She just did not want others to worry.
