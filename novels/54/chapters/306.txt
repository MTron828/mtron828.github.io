Chapter 307: Plot Twist: Fourth Master, Do You Want to Get Married?

“I did it to protect myself.”

“So it wasn’t Fourth Master Swan who let you go. It was you who sneaked away again.” Nox was certain of it, and Jeanne did not refute it.

“Fourth Master Swan never breaks his promises.” Nox enunciated each word.

Jeanne kept silent because... at that moment, she knew she was not in the right and could not defend herself.

She simply turned around and left.

There was no need to explain herself. In any case, she would not come back here after she left.

Whatever happened here would stay here.

With that, she walked forward.

“Jeanne, without Fourth Master Swan’s permission, no one can take away what belongs to him.” Nox shouted behind her, without forgetting to add, “No matter what!”

Jeanne’s body froze, but she eventually pursed her lips and left.

Nox watched as Jeanne entered the security check and completely disappeared from his sight.

How cold-blooded of her!

However, her leaving was also a good thing as it would save Fourth Master Swan from all the heartbreak in the future.

......

Just like that, he turned around and walked out of the airport, where he took a taxi and left straight for Bamboo Garden.

He thought it was a good idea to have a good laugh at the victim.

The moment he walked into the hall, he saw Fourth Master Swan sitting on the sofa, expressionless.

Fourth Master Swan did not react to him coming back either.

“Aren’t you curious why I came back?” Nox sat down next to Edward.

“It’s useless. You would’ve come back eventually.” Edward was indifferent to his return

Nox was fuming.

Was that what they called burning bridges?

It was simply outrageous!

Forget it. He would not argue with someone who had just broken up and handed the phone to Edward. “Jeanne wanted me to pass it to you.”

Edward glanced at it, took it, and placed it on the sofa casually.

“You tacitly allowed Jeanne to leave, right?” Nox leaned on the sofa and asked lazily.

Edward did not answer.

In fact, there was no need to answer that question because Nox knew.

“Jeanne was not reluctant to leave at all.” Nox said bluntly, “Stop thinking about her. She really doesn’t have any feelings for you, so don’t waste your feelings on her. It’s not worth it.”

Edward still kept silent.

“If you think about it carefully, how could Jeanne be worthy of you? She may be beautiful and capable and have a powerful background, but in any case, her feelings for you are not sincere! Besides, who knows what her relationship with Kingsley is? And she really doesn’t have any feelings for you. It’s a good thing that she’s gone now. If the two of you really do get together, aren’t you worried that she’ll cuckold you every day?” Nox could not be more straightforward.

However, Edward was still unmoved.

“Forget it. On account of your breakup, I won’t say much. However, Fourth Master Swan, I feel the need to tell you something.” Nox suddenly looked serious.

Edward glanced at him.

“You can’t be so abstinent. It’s not good for your body.” Nox was very serious.

Edward refused to listen to him anymore. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What I said is true. If you get to know more women and have more sex, you will eventually forget about Jeanne. Speaking of Jeanne’s figure... I think if I try my best, I can find someone better than her for you. It’s fine if you don’t want a better match! In any case, as long as you nod your head, anything is fine!”

“There’s no need. “Edward said, “You can go back now.”

“What I said is true.”

“Me, too.”

“You just can’t let go of Jeanne, huh?”

Edward did not say anything.

“What exactly did Jeanne do to you seven years ago to make you miss her so much?” Nox could not understand Edward.

They had only slept together for one night. What kind of feelings could he get out of it?

Nox had slept with so many women. Once he put on his pants, he would not be able to differentiate between them, let alone feelings!

However, Edward seemed to have completely ignored Nox as he got up and turned around to go upstairs.

Nox shouted at his back, “Jeanne is such a fickle and cold-blooded woman who isn’t worthy of you!”

By then, Edward was already a distance away.

Nox felt that he had expressed everything he could and had comforted Edward as much as he could.

Anyway, no matter how hard it was, Fourth Master Swan would be able to endure it on his own.

Fourth Master Swan was just that strong.

He reckoned that even if Fourth Master Swan was heartbroken right now, nobody could tell, not even him.

Nevertheless, it was all his speculation.

He did a stretch and figured there was no point in staying here. He might as well find a girl to sleep with and relieve the emptiness of having no woman for a week.

Just as he was thinking of that, he turned around and was almost scared to death.

Was he f*cking seeing things?

Who was the person standing behind him?

Was It Jeanne?

Was it the woman who entered the security checkpoint just now and walked away gracefully?

Was he possessed?

He rubbed his eyes and looked at Jeanne in disbelief.

“It’s me, the fickle and cold-blooded woman you spoke of,” Jeanne said flatly, confirming what Nox was seeing.

Nox was stunned for two seconds before he exploded with rage. “Why are you back again?!”

He had to leave as soon as possible, so as not to stand in the way of his Fourth Master Swan.

“I’m back to...” Jeanne grinned. “Seduce Fourth Master Swan.”

“Jeanne!” Nox’s eyes were bulging out of their sockets.

Holding George’s hand, Jeanne walked past Nox’s side and went upstairs.

“Are you crazy?” Nox swore.

Jeanne bit her lips and did not answer. To other people, she was indeed crazy.

She brought George upstairs and stopped at the door of Fourth Master Swan’s bedroom.

Then, she lowered her head and said something to George, who left obediently.

As he left, he looked at her worriedly.

Jeanne took a deep breath before knocking on the door.

The moment the door opened and their eyes met, Jeanne said, “Fourth Master, do you want to get married?”
