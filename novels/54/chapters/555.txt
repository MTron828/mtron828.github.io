Chapter 556: Sowing Discord Between The Lawrences

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Once there was a rift between them, it would be easy for her to deal with the Lawrences.

The corners of her mouth curled into an evil smile.

Then, she took out her phone and dialed a number.

The call went through, and she looked a little surprised when she heard, “Eldest Young Lady Lawrence?”

“Nox.” Jeanne said, “Are you free? I want to talk to you.”

“Talk to me? Are you going to kill me?” Nox’s desire to live was still very strong, especially since he was right in front of a certain someone.

The moment he answered the call, a certain busy person, who had been ignoring him all day, looked up at Nox.

His attention was drawn the moment Nox mentioned his wife.

“It’s business.”

“If it’s not, I wouldn’t have answered your call either.”

“...”

The person on the other end smiled. “Now?”

“If you’re free, I’ll wait for you now at Bamboo Garden.”

“Okay.” Nox agreed immediately.

After that, he deliberately said to Edward in a flirtatious manner, “Your wife has asked me to meet her at Bamboo Garden, so I’m getting off work early.”

Edward glanced at Nox and suddenly put down the work in his hands. He said, “I happen to have nothing else to do.”

Nox thought, ‘Dude, you clearly have a lot of things to do, and because Eden has been fired, you have even more things to do. How shameless are you to say you have nothing else to do?’

…

Jeanne put down the phone and pondered for a while before dialing Monica’s number out of concern.

Monica was feeling pretty down, so when she received Jeanne’s call, she sounded a little weak. “Jeannie.”

“What’s wrong? Aren’t you helping Michael? Are you regretting it already?” Jeanne teased.

“That’s not it. I’m definitely going to help Michael. Now that I’ve come this far, I have no choice but to help him.”

“Then why are you feeling so down?”

“I don’t know. I thought I made the right decision, but no one seems to support me. Now that I’ve calmed down, I feel horrible.” Jeanne could tell from Monica’s tone that Monica was feeling down. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Are you at work now?” Jeanne asked.

“No, how would I be in the mood to go to work?” Monica said, “I’m at the hotel now, lying on the bed and waiting to die.”

“How about this? Since we haven’t met for so long, come to Bamboo Garden for dinner. We’ll talk about you, Michael, and Dr. Jones.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

She really needed someone to guide her.

After returning from her family’s villa, Michael sent her to a hotel.

Monica should have gone to look for a house as she could not stay in the hotel forever. However, she could not bring herself to do it and refused to go with Michael. She even refused Michael accompanying her, so she returned to the hotel on her own and had been lying on the bed ever since.

She did not know why, but after she calmed down, she felt lost. It was as if nothing could bring her back to her senses.

Ever since she was young, she had always been full of energy and nothing could stop her, not even for a minute. When she was unhappy, she would go to a bar to get drunk and go crazy. However, today… She did not feel the urge to go out at all. She was so depressed that there was nothing she wanted to do.

If Jeannie had not called her, she did not know how long she would have laid there.

Monica was also a little annoyed.

She did not care at first, but after lying on the bed for a while, she began to care about what her cousin said about wanting to pursue Finn.

How could Sarah get Finn?

With Finn’s cold-as-ice attitude, he would not be with Sarah no matter what.

She was clearly aware of the situation, yet she was still unhappy.

Especially at the thought of how Finn ignored her, she felt even more uncomfortable.

She gritted her teeth, jumped up from the bed, and patted her lifeless face.

She could not allow herself to wallow in her sadness. She had to help Michael stabilize his career as quickly as possible and then leave Michael to return to Finn’s side, even if it meant she had to be shameless.

She always thought Finn was cold. However, after spending some time together in the hospital, she realized that Finn was the type of person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside. Although people like him may seem difficult to please, all she had to do was put in more effort to break down his wall.

With that thought in mind, Monica felt a little better.

Then, she washed her face and touched up her makeup.

Since the five-star presidential suite had everything equipped, it would be a waste not to use its amenities.
