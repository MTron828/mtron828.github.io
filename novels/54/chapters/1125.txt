1126 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

“There’s no need for that.” Jeanne rejected.

She would give herself an explanation and did not need anyone to do that for her.

Edward looked at her silently and watched as she crouched down in front of Kingsley, not moving at all.

In the end, he turned around and left. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He knew very well that Jeanne would not leave. She would not leave Harken or go as far away as possible because the most important person to her, Kingsley, had died here.

With that, he left with Nox as he still had many things to do.

Even if Jeanne did not need an explanation, he would still give it to her.

When it was time to leave, Nox suddenly turned to Jeanne and said, “Who do you think is the main culprit behind all this? Do you think it’s Edward or Alex? Let me tell you, the one who killed Kingsley was your so-called biological father, Warren. If he hadn’t detained the assassins from the Hills, Kingsley would have gotten his support and wouldn’t have died in Alex’s hands!”

Edward did not stop Nox.

He did not say that because Jeanne did not want to hear it, but Nox was not afraid to say it. He, too, hoped that Jeanne would know the entire story.

In fact, Jeanne would know.

Edward and Nox left together.

They went to the road in the distance and drove the car that was still there from last night away from this barren place, the place where he had met up with Kingsley to save Jeanne.

He had told Kingsley to come to take Jeanne away and to keep her alive at the cost of his life.

However, they had failed, and as a result of that failure, he could only watch as Jeanne end up in the cruel war.

“Mason,” Jeanne suddenly said.

After Edward and Nox left, she called out to him.

“Yes,” Mason said respectfully.

Even though an assassin had seen too many cruel images, when Mason saw Kingsley dead, he was still a little... emotional.

Probably no one would have thought that the head of the Hills would die so easily.

He had thought that Kingsley would never fall. Yet, Kingsley died in this desolate place.

If Jeanne had not gone back on her word and rushed back halfway, Kingsley would have died without a proper burial place.

She said, “Find out if Lucy is dead for me.”

Jeanne’s tone was very calm. It was as if she had accepted the reality and was frighteningly calm.

In fact, it was good that she had let out all her emotions. If she did not, no one would know what she was thinking.

Mason simply nodded and agreed. With that, he left Jeanne’s side and went to look for Lucy.

In fact, since Kingsley was dead, there was no way Lucy would be alive.

Based on his understanding of Lucy, he knew that she would not choose to escape before Kingsley was safe.

As expected, he saw Lucy’s corpse from a distance. To see such a beautiful woman die so tragically…

He squatted down, picked her up, and carried her toward Jeanne, who was already digging with her bare hands.

Mason hurried over.

He put Lucy down and grabbed Jeanne’s hand. Jeanne’s body was covered in mud, and her hands were covered in blood.

“Jeanne,” Mason called out to her.

However, Jeanne did not react to him.

“Don’t do this. Mr. Thorn would be heartbroken if he saw you like this.” Mason stopped her.

“No.” Jeanne shook her head. “He’s already dead. He won’t be heartbroken anymore.”

“But he died for you! Shouldn’t you cherish your body more?” Mason was clearly a little angry when it was usually difficult for an assassin to have any emotions.

Kingsley had died for her, so what was the use of blaming Edward?

He was clearly the one who caused it, but in order to let out her emotions, she said all those ugly words to Edward.

She also understood what Nox just said.

In fact, Kingsley’s death had little to do with Edward. Other than the bullet in Kingsley’s head, the other reasons for Kingsley’s death had nothing to do with Edward.

Yet, she could be so despicable as to hate him.

If there was someone she should hate, it would be herself.

She should also hate Warren, whom Nox had just mentioned.

If Warren had not been so despicable, Kingsley would not have died at the hands of the Duncans.

She pondered over it silently while digging Kingsley’s grave with her bare hands.
