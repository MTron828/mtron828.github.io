1112 Edward and Kingsley’s Alliance

“I don’t know if it’s the Sanders or the Duncans’ men who rushed over. Now, we and Kingsley’s men are surrounded.”

“Where’s Jeanne?” At the thought of that woman, Nox was filled with anger.

“She’s with Kingsley.”

“F*ck. Don’t let me see her again,” Nox said viciously.

“The most important thing now is to find out who’s behind this.” There was a look of urgency on Edward’s face.

As they could not determine who it was, they could not guarantee Jeanne’s safety.

It would be fine if they were from the Sanders.

If it was the Duncans...

“They’re from the Duncans,” Nox confirmed.

Edward frowned.

“This.” Nox took out a small tracking device.

Edward’s expression changed.

“The Duncans gave it to me and told me to keep it with me without you knowing. Edward, don’t blame me. I didn’t want you to die.” Nox did not hide it.

There was no need to hide anything between brothers.

Even if Nox had disobeyed his orders, Edward did not say anything at that moment.

He did not complain or get angry.

He understood where Nox was coming from and did not blame Nox, but he wanted to send Jeanne away.

He had to send her away because if he did not, Jeanne would die without a doubt.

He suddenly left from the bottom of the slope.

There were still countless gunshots out there, and it was obvious that Kingsley had started fighting with the Duncans.

“Edward!” Nox wanted to stop him but could not.

By then, Edward had already rushed out toward Kingsley.

Nox gritted his teeth and had no choice but to go over. He wondered if the Duncans would notice their actions in the dark.

If they were discovered, they would not be able to clear their names.

Edward quickly appeared in Kingsley’s hiding place.

Kingsley looked at Edward coldly and pointed the gun at Edward

“I can’t die now.” Edward said, “We have to send Jeanne away first.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

If he was dead now, Jeanne would definitely die too. Hence, before Jeanne was safe, he could not die.

Kingsley endured it.

“You ambushed me!” he said ruthlessly.

“If I were the one who ambushed you, I wouldn’t have appeared in front of you again. I want to talk to you about cooperation now. For Jeanne’s life, we have to work together.” Edward’s words were quick and urgent. “According to the current situation, the Duncans have a lot of manpower. Even if you break out of the encirclement, you will still suffer heavy losses in the end. More importantly, can you guarantee that you can still leave Harken safely with Jeanne? Would Warren allow you to leave with Jeanne?”

“What do you want me to do?” Kingsley agreed.

When it came to Jeanne’s safety, the two men in front of her had always reached an agreement.

“You’ll be the bait to let the Duncans and even the Sanders think that the Duncans and I are after you. Take this opportunity to get someone to secretly leave with Jeanne. When everyone’s attention is on you, let Jeanne go first.”

“Alright,” Kingsley said without hesitation.

“I’m returning to the Duncans’ side now. In 10 minutes at most, you have to let me see your figure. Then, I’ll lead everyone to hunt you down!” With that, Edward left.

It had never crossed his mind that Kingsley would refuse because it was obvious that Kingsley could not refuse.

The best way now was to take the advantage of the chaos to send Jeanne away.

Edward, that man, could react faster than anyone else. It would really be a pity for him to die.

Kingsley watched as Edward left with Nox.

At that moment, he turned around and went to Jeanne’s hiding place.

“K01,” Kingsley ordered.

“Mr. Thorn,” K01 said respectfully.

“In ten minutes, I’ll leave with everyone in that direction. I’ve talked to Fourth Master Swan. He’ll bring all his men to chase after me, and you’ll take this opportunity to leave with Jeanne from this direction. Just the two of you will go because the chances of you both getting exposed will lessen with fewer people. After you leave, think of a way to return to the Delta Islands and wait for me to return.”

“Yes.”

“What if you don’t come back?” Jeanne suddenly asked Kingsley.

Tonight was clearly different from any other time as tonight’s battle was much more intense than any other time.

Since the other party was from the Duncans, the Duncans had already started their move. They had been hiding for decades and finally showing themselves, so it would definitely not be a small move.

He could lure everyone away, but could he guarantee that he would be able to escape unscathed?

“If I don’t come back, take all the money to a country you want to go to and never come back! Don’t go back to the Delta Islands or South Hampton City. Go as far as you can!”
