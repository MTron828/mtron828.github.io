Chapter 392: Finn Awakens, and I Want to Give Him a Child!

In the forest, Jeanne hugged Edward tightly with all her strength to calm him down.

She did not know why he had become like that or why he had suddenly become so out of control like he was a different person.

“Edward, calm down. I’m Jeanne. I’m Jeanne,” Jeanne said loudly.

She tried to pull him back to his senses, but he seemed to find it hard to control himself.

The muscles in his entire body were stretched to their limits, and he looked as terrifying as ever. Yet, he did not hurt her.

Even though he had gone crazy, he did not do anything to hurt her.

Nox fell to the ground and looked at the scene in front of him.

Edward still looked like he was about to explode but was controlling himself and had yet done anything to Jeanne.

Nox secretly gritted his teeth.

After he got up from the ground, he looked at Edward, who was already at his limit of suppressing his violence.

If he continued to suppress it, there would only be two outcomes — he would either die suffocating or calm down.

However, he had to say that there had never been a time Edward could stop himself from acting out when he was still under the effects of the medicine.

Nox did not think too much about it as he moved closer to Edward and gave Jeanne a look.

......

Jeanne understood.

She knew that Edward might push her away and hurt himself again in the next second, so she took the initiative to kiss Edward.

The moment she kissed him, the furious man stayed silent for another two seconds.

In those two seconds, Nox had already leaned over and lifted the stone he had prepared earlier to the back of Edward’s head.

Edward’s eyes moved as if he suddenly regained some focus.

His gaze fell on Jeanne, who had taken the initiative to kiss her cheek. Looking at her appearance, he slowly collapsed.

Jeanne held Edward tightly in her arms to prevent him from falling to the ground.

Nox heaved a sigh of relief.

Whenever Edward came to that point, regardless of whether he fell asleep on his own or passively, all was good as long as he woke up.

Nox walked over, took Edward over from Jeanne, and put Edward on his back.

Jeanne looked at Nox’s face and saw that he did not seem to be surprised by Edward’s terrifying appearance. That meant it was not the first time Edward was like that.

However, why?

How did Edward become like that, that non-human behavior?

Nox carried Edward on his back and walked forward.

As he walked, he said, “I know you have questions, but I personally think that it’s up to Fourth Master Swan to decide whether or not he would like to tell you the truth about himself.”

Jeanne pursed her lips.

She, of course, knew what Nox meant.

Hence, she did not think much and followed Nox.

While Nox carried Edward to the speedboat, he ordered through the walkie-talkie, “Everyone, gather at the beach on the island.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne followed Nox out of the jungle and saw a speedboat docked on the sea.

Nox then brought Edward on the speedboat and put him down. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Meanwhile, Jeanne sat at the side and let Edward fall on top of her.

At that moment, Edward seemed to have entered a deep sleep. She had a feeling that he would not wake up no matter how hard she tried.

She looked at Edward’s extremely quiet appearance. The image of him going crazy just now kept playing in her mind.

In the end, she chose to remain silent. Nox would not tell her anything anyway.

By then, Nox’s subordinates had already boarded the speedboat.

Many people should have died this time. Other than Nox’s own people, the other party might have been completely wiped out.

Jeanne was stunned again.

Edward fought ten people alone. Although they might not be top-notch killers, they were definitely above average.

The man’s ability was much more terrifying than she had imagined.

The speedboat sped on the surface of the sea.

Nox drove the speedboat and did not return to Jeanne and Edward’s honeymoon island. Instead, he went straight to another small island where a helicopter was parked.

He said bluntly, “Let’s put the honeymoon aside for now. I want to bring Fourth Master Swan back to the country.”

She was not in the mood for a honeymoon anyway. After all, she almost lost her life.

Nox carried Edward on his back and boarded the helicopter, with Jeanne still by their side.

The helicopter hovered in the sky above the Balti Islands and arrived at the only international airport in the Balti Islands. Then, they boarded a private plane and left the island, that soul-stirring place.

Jeanne did not know if she and Edward could still... face each other calmly when they returned home.
