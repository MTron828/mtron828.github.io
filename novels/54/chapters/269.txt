Chapter 270: I Want to Pamper You With All My Life

The bloody night had come to an end.

The whole world was quiet.

In the room, Edward looked at Jeanne, watching her sleep.

Her eyebrows were slightly furrowed, and her face was pale.

Edward sat next to her as if he was petrified, quietly watching her sleep.

He could not shift his gaze away.

If he was any later tonight…

If Jeanne was still that frail girl from seven years ago…

If…

Edward clenched his fists tightly.

He did not dare to imagine.

“Fourth Master.” A male voice was heard.

Edward’s eyes moved slightly.

Some emotions—some cruel emotions—were hidden deep inside his eyes.

He gently covered Jeanne with the blanket and slowly left the room.

At the door, Finn was waiting for him.

Edward gently closed the door and followed Finn out of the bedroom. He did not want anyone to disturb Jeanne’s rest.

The two of them walked to the living room on the first floor.

Edward sat on the sofa. Finn helped him to treat the wound on his back.

“Old Master Swan didn’t hit you too hard this time,” Finn said as he looked at the numerous whip wounds.

“He’s old,” Edward said straightforwardly.

It was not that the old master was old and could not hit him anymore.

It was that as the old master got older, he had less and less control over him.

Finn nodded slightly.

“Ms. Lawrence isn’t simple,” Finn reminded Edward.

It was Nox who had been reminding Edward previously.

Now, Finn was also reminding him.

Finn was usually not as talkative as Nox. He only spoke when he felt that it was necessary.

“Mm, I know.” Edward nodded.

He did not say what he was going to do next.

It made it hard for people to understand his thoughts.

Finn did not say much.

Fourth Master Swan had his considerations and limits in many things.

He knew better than anyone else what he wanted and had to do.

Finn helped Fourth Master Swan clean up his wounds and reminded him, “Your old wounds have just healed, and you’ve gotten new ones. You must be careful not to get infected.”

Edward nodded.

Finn packed up his medical kit.

“Finn,” Edward called out to him.

“Hm?”

“Aren’t you going to treat your wounds?” Edward asked.

“I’ll treat them later.”

Edward took the medical kit from Finn’s hands. “Let me help you.”

Finn was stunned.

He nodded.

While helping Finn treat his wounds, Edward asked, “Do you still feel no pain?”

Finn nodded.

He was born with no sense of pain, but of course, it was not that he would not feel pain at all. Under precise medical experiments that stimulated his nerve cells, he would react to pain. However, no matter how serious his external wounds were, he would not feel anything.

Such a person sounded very powerful, but in fact, he would face many dangers.

When something strange happened to his body, he would not be able to feel it himself.

Therefore, he did not know how painful his injuries were.

In fact, Finn just did not feel any pain. The other sensations in his body were normal. He would sweat in hot weather and tremble in cold weather. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was late at night.

Nox woke up to go to the bathroom.

His whole body was in pain. He did not want to get up, but he didn’t really want to pee on Fourth Master Swan’s bed. He was afraid that Fourth Master Swan would kill him. No, he did not want to be laughed at.

Nox woke up with difficulty and finished peeing.

He felt that there was still a slight sound outside the door.

As such, he could not hold back his curiosity and went to the glass railing on the second floor. He saw Fourth Master Swan half-naked downstairs, and so was Finn. No matter how he looked at it, he felt that there was something fishy going on between the two of them…

Nox had long felt that there was something fishy going on between the two of them.

When he looked at the enchanting scene…

‘F*ck.’

As a man—a straight man, he was about to get a nosebleed from looking at those two people.

He could finally understand why Teddy was becoming more and more feminine.

If Teddy took care of Fourth Master Swan’s daily life like this, he would be bent.

Nox struggled to move his feet and left again.

After all, he was too embarrassed to disturb Edward and Finn.

In the hall.

Edward finished treating Finn’s wounds and said, “Go back and rest. I’ll call you if there’s anything.”

Finn nodded.

He finished packing up his medical kit.

Edward had also gone upstairs.

At this moment, Finn left Bamboo Garden again. After settling Monica down, he went home.

At this moment, his hands were badly swollen and injured. There were also many bruises and scars on his body. However, he could not feel any pain. He had not felt any pain since he was young.
