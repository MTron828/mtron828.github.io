1208 Edward’s Compromise

Jeanne stopped in her tracks, but in the end, she walked in.

Alex sat on the sofa and looked at Jeanne’s big belly. He said, “I haven’t seen you for a few months, and your belly has grown so big.”

“It’s been seven months.”

“Time flies.” Alex smiled. “I thought you were lying to me back then. I’m indeed a petty person.”

Jeanne smiled faintly and did not seem to mind. She looked at Edward, who was also looking at her, and both their eyes met.

Then, Alex’s sudden voice made them look away.

He said, “Jeanne, I was the one who took Edward away. Now, I’m sending him back personally.”

Jeanne did not know what he meant.

“I’ll try my best to get him to stay with you until you’re in labor.”

“Thank you, Leader,” Jeanne said respectfully.

In front of the Leader of Harken, she naturally had to be respectful.

“Treasure your time with each other.” Alex did not react to Jeanne’s respect.

He suddenly stood up from the sofa. The moment he stood up, he patted Edward’s shoulder. “Don’t forget what you promised me.”

Edward did not nod.

However, Alex did not seem to expect an answer from Edward either as he strode out of the Bamboo Garden.

Jeanne stared at Alex’s back before she turned back to look at Edward and saw that his expression had changed.

In the hall, after Alex left, only Edward and Jeanne were left. Teddy must have left on his own accord, so it was just the two of them.

“Did Alex mean you won’t leave anymore?” Jeanne asked.

Edward looked back.

He said, “Yes.”

“Is everything done?” Jeanne continued to ask.

“Almost. He can handle the rest on his own,” Edward replied.

Jeanne smiled. “That’s good.”

Then, she took the initiative to walk to his side and hold his hand. His hand seemed to tremble slightly before he held her hand tightly in his.

Jeanne smiled and leaned against his chest. She did not know whether Edward could still support her now that she had gained so much weight.

She was not overthinking it.

From the fifth month onwards, her body and stomach had been growing at a speed visible to the naked eye. Sometimes, when she looked at herself in the mirror, she could not even believe that the person in the mirror was herself.

Of course, she was overthinking. With Edward’s physical strength, even if she was 120 pounds now, he could still carry her and run.

As she leaned into Edward’s arms, Edward hugged her tightly.

The two of them were silent for a long time as if they were feeling each other’s warmth to know that it was real.

“Jeannie,” Edward suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne reluctantly left his embrace.

“I’m sending George away tomorrow,” Edward said.

Stunned, Jeanne raised her head and looked at Edward. She asked, “To where?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“The place I’ve been to before.” Edward replied, “The training base.”

Jeanne’s expression sank, and she left Edward’s arms, keeping a distance of one step from him.

Edward looked at her angry expression.

She said, “Was it Alex’s request?”

“Yes.”

“For George to be like you, to train him to be the Duncans’ machine.”

Edward’s throat moved.

“So, you’ve really compromised,” Jeanne said.

However, Edward did not reply.

“Once you compromise, you’ll always compromise,” Jeanne mumbled.

“I’ll do my best to protect George.”

“Now, I don’t think you can’t protect anyone,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Edward hesitated.

“Can he not go?” Jeanne asked.

Could he keep George away from that place?

She did not allow George to come into contact with the so-called cruel training in the Hills because she firmly believed that she would take him away from that place where he had to risk his life. She wanted George to live a normal life.

Yet now, Edward wanted to send George away and turn him into a machine.

“He can’t,” Edward replied.

That was right. What he told her just now was a statement; he was not asking her for her opinion.

She just looked at Edward with reddened eyes.

...

In fact, she did not blame him because she knew how helpless he was. Since he was now loyal to Alex, he could not refuse Alex’s request.

Moreover, she had to admit that George was the best candidate for the Duncans.
