Chapter 1735: The Twins’ Names

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You seem to be recovering well.” Jeanne came alone.

It was obvious that Fourth Master Swan did not have much free time that day.

“Of course. I feel like I’m as strong as a cow now.” “Be careful. A woman needs to recover after a pregnancy.”

“Did you recover fully back then?” Monica asked curiously.

“Are you talking about after I had George or Paige?” Jeanne asked. “Paige,” Monica thought about it and asked about Jeanne’s youngest child.

“Why don’t you ask Dr. Jones?” Jeanne said bluntly.

Monica was stunned. What did that mean?

She turned to look at Finn. “You were with Jeannie during her recovery period?” “Uh, yes.” Finn nodded.

During that time, after Jeanne was secretly taken away from Bamboo Garden, he had been by Jeanne’s side, accompanying her and guiding her. Fourth Master Swan was never there because, at that time, there were too many spies around him.

“Was it during that time when you were often away?” Monica recalled. “Yes.” Finn nodded.

“I thought you some woman had seduced you, but it turns out you were with Jeannie. Finn, you should’ve told me about it at that time. Then, there wouldn’t have been such a huge conflict between us, so it was all your fault,” Monica complained.

“Yes, yes, it was all my fault.” Finn did not want to argue with Monica.

“By the way, when Jeannie was recovering, was she like me? Was she only allowed to be in bed and was not allowed to move?” Monica was still complaining.

Finn said bluntly, “Not really.”

“So, you’re harsher on me…”

“No.” Finn directly denied Monica’s claim. “Jeannie isn’t as dishonest as you.”

Monica was certain that Finn wanted to anger a pregnant woman who had just given birth on purpose!

Her reaction made Finn chuckle, and he was clearly in a good mood. Jeanne also laughed. She did not know why, but for some reason, it was funny to see Monica angry. She could not even hold it. Then, she sat beside Monica and asked, “How are you feeling?”

“I feel fine, but I’m afraid I’ll die of anger.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What’s there to be angry about?” Jeanne consoled her, “When I was recovering Edward was never by my side. But look at you, Finn hasn’t left your side since you gave birth. So, tell me, who’s more blessed?”

When Monica heard that, tears welled up in her eyes. At the thought of how Fourth Master Swan was not around during Jeannie’s two childbirth, her heart ached for Jeanne.

She did not know it before she had children, but now that she had, she knew how weak a woman was after labor. She wanted someone to be by her side and for the person she loved the most to care about her.

“Don’t cry.” Jeanne consoled her, “I’m not as miserable as you think. I understand Edward very well, so I don’t think it’s a big deal. Besides, he makes me happy, and I’m glad to have met him in this life.”

“Are you showing off your relationship with Fourth Master Swan?” Monica blew her nose.

She felt a little better after hearing what Jeanne said.

“How can I compare to you guys when it comes to that? Don’t you know? From the start to the end of your labor, Finn had never left your side. He looked at you with such tender eyes that even I found it corny.”

“Really?” Monica could not hide her joy.

In fact, she knew full well how Finn treated her. However, when it came from someone else, she felt even happier!

Jeanne could not be bothered with Monica anymore, so she turned to Finn and asked, “Have the babies’ names been decided?”

“Not yet,” Finn replied.

“That’s right. We haven’t named the babies yet.” Monica also seemed to have just recalled the fact that they had not named the babies yet.

She had completely forgotten about that matter. Now, they were all calling them baby, brother, or sister.

“There’s no rush. Take your time to think about it,” Jeanne said.

“Do you want me to come up with them for you?” Ruby heard their conversation and came over to interrupt with the baby in her arms.

“No!” Monica refused immediately. “You guys were the ones who came up with my name back then. Tell me, which parent would be so unconcerned to name their daughter Monica? When I was young, I was always called bossy because of Monica from the sitcom, Friends! Someone even mocked me.’

Naturally, she was referring to Finn.

Ruby’s expression was grim. “You looked like a Monica back then. Your father and I spent half a year to come up with it.”

“In any case, you’re not allowed to come up with the names. I don’t like it..”
