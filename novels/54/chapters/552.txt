“The layoffs might create some commotion in the company, but at the end of the day, it won’t hurt us. Grandfather, you’re concerned about the backlash from the senior management. However, as long as we have something on those senior managers, they won’t dare to cause any trouble.”

“What do you mean?” Jonathan was drawn to Jeanne’s words.

Jeanne picked up the document in front of her again, flipped it to the one she needed, and said, “I want to replace all the people that have been circled.”

Jonathan read through it.

“But before I do anything to them, I will first do an investigation on them. They must have something that cannot see the light of the day. Once I get hold of that something, I can fire them without any scruples. Even if they’re unwilling, they can only endure it for fear we will expose their matter. That is why it won’t hurt the company.”

“Can we get dirt on all of them?” Jonathan asked.

“I’m not sure, but we have to try. If we really can’t get dirt on all of them, we can make them take a back seat. We didn’t say we’d fire them. We just want them to retire ahead of time. Even if we have to spend more money to do so, we can’t let any of them take these important positions.”

“Alright. I support your idea,” Jonathan affirmed.

“I don’t trust my father to do this, so I hope that you’ll–”

“You want me to give you the authority to take charge of this matter?”

“Yes.” Jeanne did not hide it.

Jonathan looked at Jeanne and was a little wary of her now that he had seen her potential.

Jeanne, who understood the situation, added, “Grandfather, Lawrence Enterprise belongs to the family. The company has been around for so many years, and not only have we not done well, but we’ve also been looked down on quite a lot. I know you may think I have selfish motives toward Lawrences Enterprise, so I do admit that I want more from the company and to have more of a presence in this family. However, I’m doing all of this to bring the company to greater heights. Grandfather, you don’t have to be overly wary of me. I don’t want the company. I just want my shares.”

“Jeanne.” Jonathan looked at Jeanne with a serious expression, “This time, your capability has made me look at you in a new light. From the bottom of my heart, I see you. I even think you’ve surpassed Jasmine, Joshua, and your father by a mile. If you were a boy, I would not hesitate to give everything to you. However, all throughout the years in Harken, it is a tradition for the men to inherit everything in the family, and I can’t turn my back on tradition. So, I will still give the Lawrences to Joshua.”

Jeanne smiled. “I know.”

It was as if she had long understood.

“But if you perform well, I will definitely give you what you deserve.”

“Thank you, grandfather.”

“However, I don’t wish for you to be too ambitious,” Jonathan said openly. “No matter how outstanding you are in the company, you should know that I’m the chairman of Lawrence Enterprise. With my power, I can make you lose everything in an instant.”

Jeanne smiled, not expecting Jonathan to be so honest.

She listened calmly.

Jonathan said, “I have to admit that what happened to you seven years ago was a little too cruel of me, but it is all in the past. After all, the blood of the Lawrences runs in your veins, which makes you a part of our family. As long as you are one of us, I will acknowledge you. From now on, no one in the Lawrences will be able to bully you.”

Jonathan was now using the emotion card to express his stance.

It meant that as long as she gave her heart and soul to the company, Jonathan would back her up. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Looking extremely touched, she said, “Thank you, grandfather, for acknowledging me.”

When it came to feelings, anyone would know.

If Jonathan wanted to use that method to bribe her, she would... play along.

“Grandfather, don’t worry. I don’t want Lawrence Enterprise, and there’s really no need for me to take control of it. I’m sure you know about my assets, so Lawrence Enterprise doesn’t attract me. Even if I am, Swan Enterprise is more attractive.” Jeanne deliberately told him what she wanted.

Jonathan was a little surprised as he looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne smiled. “I was just saying.”

She was just saying so that Jonathan would think she had her eyes on Swan Enterprise.
