1336 An Encounter at Dinner and Finn’s Outburst

Was this woman planning to enter the entertainment industry? She was so good at pretending!

“Monica.” Patsy seemed to think for a while before confirming.

Monica rolled her eyes. She could not be bothered.

“Monica, why are you here?!” Patsy could not help but ask loudly.

“Isn’t it normal for me to be anywhere? What about you? Why are you here?!” Monica asked.

Why did she come out instead of staying at home with Finn?

She was aware that nothing was going on between Finn and Patsy; Patsy simply relied on Finn.

Finn was also innocent and took care of Patsy. She did not like Patsy purely because of the trauma left behind by her first impression.

“Finn and I came out to have a meal with his colleagues from their department,” Patsy replied.

Monica suddenly remembered that Finn was having a department dinner tonight. He actually chose this place?! What a coincidence!

“He brought you here?” Monica asked.

“He was to bring family members to the gathering. If I don’t come, won’t Finn lose face?” Patsy looked straight at Monica, obviously mocking her but Monica was not in the mood to argue with Patsy. She walked past Patsy without saying more.

Patsy looked at Monica’s back. Although she did not have any improper thoughts about Finn, she also felt that she was not worthy of him. Monica did not care about Finn at all.

She turned around and headed back to the private room. Everyone was still drinking.

Finn would also down a few glasses of wine but he did not drink much throughout the night.

After all, doctors and nurses were much more reserved. No matter how indulgent they were, they would know their limits.

“Finn.” Patsy sat beside Finn, “I saw Monica.”

Finn’s eyes moved slightly. His emotions were affected and they were obvious.

“She seems to be eating here too,” Patsy said.

Finn nodded. He appeared indifferent.

Right then, someone came to propose a toast and Patsy did not say anything else.

However, it was obvious that Finn became a little absent-minded. The gathering did not last long to begin with, and by nine o’clock, Finn’s dinner was over.

Everyone left one after another. Finn’s car was also parked at the entrance. Since he had drunk some alcohol, of course, there would be a designated driver.

Patsy sat in the car calmly and looked at Finn who was standing in front of the car door, looking a little hesitant.

“Finn, aren’t you leaving?” Patsy asked him.

When Finn came back to his senses, he said, “Patsy, you can go back first. I still have something to do. I’ll be back in a while.”

Patsy frowned. She had no doubt what she had in mind was right. “You’re waiting for Monica, right?!”

Finn did not lie to her. “Yes, I’ll wait for her to go back with me.”

Patsy nodded indifferently. After all, she had completely accepted the fact that Finn and Monica were together. She said obediently, “Then I’ll go back first.”

Finn closed the car door for her and the car left. Finn was waiting for Monica at the entrance of the restaurant. He waited until 10:30 p.m.

A group of people came out of the restaurant. When they came out, at least half of the people were drunk. Monica must have had a lot to drink at dinner tonight too. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

One group left after another. Finn did not see Monica coming out. He wondered if Monica was drunk and could barely hold herself up.

Without thinking, he went straight to the private room where Monica was having dinner. After finding out from Patsy that Monica was also here for dinner, he looked into which private room Monica was in.

There were a few times when he wanted to go over, but he stopped himself. He should not interfere too much with her work. He decided that he would just wait for her and go home together.

Finn walked quickly to the private room. As soon as he pushed open the door, he heard the heart-wrenching vomiting sound from the washroom in the private room.

Finn suddenly pushed open the bathroom door. He saw a man vomiting in the toilet bowl. Monica was just beside him, taking care of him and patting his back.

Sensing that someone was there, Monica turned around. She turned around and saw Finn.

She saw him suddenly appear in front of her. It took her a few seconds to realize that Finn was also eating at the same restaurant.

He was here just in time. She quickly said to Finn, “Help me hold him up. He is very drunk.”

Finn just stared at Monica.
