Chapter 1407: Are You Saying Zoe Is Lying To Me?

Thank you readers!

Nox went back after settling Finn down. On the way back, his mind was filled with what Monica just said.

‘F*ck.’

Monica just could not stand seeing him doing well and wanted everyone to go down with her, huh? How could Zoe be that kind of person?

For some reason, he felt vexed, especially more so today. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Soon, the car arrived at his high-class neighborhood. However, Nox suddenly had the driver stop the car at the entrance because he saw Zoe.

Zoe was also getting out of the car at that moment, and there seemed to be a man beside her. Seeing that, Nox rushed down angrily.

Zoe naturally saw Nox from afar, but she was doing it on purpose for Nox to see. The look in Monica’s eyes tonight… Women were sometimes more sensitive than men. Hence, she had to dispel Nox’s doubts.

“Cody, thank you for sending me back.” Zoe pretended not to see Nox and kept a distance from the man, as if they were not very familiar with each other.

“You’re drunk. Do you want me to send you to your door?” Cody was also very polite, not overstepping their boundaries.

“No need. I’m afraid my fiancé will misunderstand.” Zoe rejected him directly.

“Alright.” The man nodded. At that moment, he could not help but joke, “You and your fiancé must have a really good relationship.”

“Yes, he’s very good to me.” Zoe smiled sweetly.

“I can see that.” The man smiled. “Take care.”

“You, too. Be careful on the road.” Zoe seemed very well-mannered.

Then, without any hesitation, she turned around and walked into the neighborhood. She deliberately avoided looking at Nox, who was not far away.

Nox watched as Zoe walked into the neighborhood while the man returned to his car and left. Therefore, he did indeed overthink things, and so did Monica.

In society, there were so many interactions between men and women, and it was normal to socialize with others occasionally.

Suddenly, he strode over because Zoe, who was in front of him, was unsteady on her feet and was about to fall.

As he pulled Zoe into his arms, Zoe was stunned. However, when she turned around and saw Nox, she heaved a sigh of relief. “Nox, are you back?” Zoe asked.

“Are you drunk?”

“I was having dinner with my colleagues tonight, but halfway through the meal, my dad called me to another meeting, so I drank a little. My alcohol tolerance isn’t good to begin with, so I got a little drunk, and I was sent back,” Zoe said without hiding anything.

There was really nothing unusual about it.

“If you can’t drink, drink less.”

“Okay.” Zoe nodded obediently.

With that, Nox helped Zoe into the neighborhood.

Zoe smiled evilly to herself. Obviously, Nox would not suspect her anymore.

The two of them returned to Nox’s house together and took turns showering. In order to show that she was drunk, Zoe did not take the initiative in bed.

However, it was rare that Nox did not take the initiative either, which had never happened before. As long as the two of them were together, they would definitely sleep together.

Zoe twisted her body and approached Nox.

Nox shifted his eyes to look at Zoe.

“It’s okay. I’m only a little drunk.” Zoe was obviously inviting him.

Nox pursed his lips. He did not know why, but even though they had not done it for two days, it felt like he had lost interest tonight. He would not have been able to hold it in if it were in the past, but tonight, he was just not in the mood.

Before Nox could do anything, Zoe had taken the initiative to approach him.

Admittedly, he was not someone who would refuse, so the two of them just followed each other’s lead until…

Late at night, Nox was smoking on the balcony.

After they were done, he took a shower and did not feel sleepy anymore, so he went to sit down on the balcony.

Somehow, he felt a little down. He was already feeling a little sad today, and after the deed in bed, he felt empty.

He took a fierce drag from his cigarette.

“What’s wrong with you tonight?”

Somebody suddenly hugged his body from behind.

Nox put out his cigarette.

“I’ve never seen you in such a bad state.” Zoe buried her head in Nox’s neck. “It hurts.”

Nox’s throat moved slightly.

For some reason, he thought of Shelly when he was in bed with Zoe just now and recalled what Shelly said about never pestering him again. After that, he got so inexplicably angry that he vented all his emotions on Zoe..
