Chapter 328: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

“Ms. Lawrence, please allow us to help you put it on,” the staff member said respectfully.

“Are you sure Fourth Master Swan prepared this for me?” Jeanne was still a little uncertain.

She had always assumed their wedding would be with a simple white wedding dress and a black suit.

However, now that it was a designer dress... She was surprised.

“I’m sure.” The staff member smiled.

With that, Jeanne pursed her lips. “In that case, thank you.”

“Ms. Lawrence, you don’t have to be so polite.”

While the staff member said that, she went forward to help Jeanne change into her wedding dress.

Then, the room door was suddenly pushed open.

Monica’s carefree voice sounded. “D*mn, do you have to be so early?”

George was still sleeping, so when he heard the voice, he covered himself with the blanket. His small face looked very unhappy.

Jeanne turned her head to look at Monica. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After all that shouting, Monica’s gaze instantly fell on the wedding gown in front of her.

......

Her eyes were wide open. “My god! What the hell is this? Is this Old Master Adams’ gown? The legendary designer wedding gown?!”

“Yes, Ms. Cardellini,” the staff quickly replied.

“D*mn.” Monica circled around the white wedding gown and almost drooled.

“This is absolutely beautiful!” Monica exclaimed.

Jeanne also thought it was absolutely beautiful, so much that it was shocking.

“Ms. Cardellini, you also have a bridesmaid dress. Come over here. I’ll help you change into it.”

“Oh, okay.” Monica was instantly attracted.

In the meantime, Jeanne changed into her wedding gown with the help of the staff.

The gown had three layers inside and three layers outside.

It was very complicated. After all, the more expensive the item, the more steps there were.

Jeanne felt that just changing into the dress alone took an hour. Since it was not easy to change into, it made her wonder how she would take it off!

On the other hand, Monica had gotten changed long ago.

She was wearing a pink dress that was slightly old-fashioned, conveying Harken’s concept of traditional beauty, but it had an elegant and modern design. Alone, it was a really beautiful dress, but next to Jeanne’s wedding dress, it looked much more elegant. As a bridesmaid’s dress, it was just right. Not only would she not steal the bride’s show when they stood together, but even without the bride, she would shine.

Monica was very satisfied.

The two of them sat in front of the makeup mirror as they got their makeup done.

Monica looked at Jeanne’s extremely complicated makeup and could not help but ask, “Did Fourth Master Swan prepare all of this?”

“Probably,” Jeanne replied.

She did not know either, mainly because she was not involved in the wedding planning. They did not even take wedding photos, and she did not even ask if they would.

“Why do I feel like he has put in a lot of effort?” Monica was really envious.

Thinking back to her own wedding back then, she was the one who did all the work, and Finn did not care.

At that time, all she wanted was to make herself look good, so she was the one who chose the wedding dress.

What a contrast! Compared to this, she felt that her wedding was really weak.

The next time she got married, she would have to plan carefully!

The two of them spent more than an hour putting on makeup before the hairstylist did their hair.

“Ms. Lawrence, because the gown is so gorgeous, we will have the accessories a little simpler. However, don’t worry. No matter how simple the accessories are, they’re not cheap,” the staff member explained.

Speaking of which, did she look poor?

“It was Fourth Master Swan who told us to tell Ms. Lawrence that.” As if she could read Jeanne’s mind, the staff member hurriedly explained.

At the side, Monica could not help but laugh. “The Fourth Master is quite funny.”

Was he afraid that Jeanne would dislike him? To think he would send someone to tell Jeanne that the wedding today had cost a lot of money!

“This is a golden hairpin. The craftsmanship may look simple, but it actually requires a lot of skill. It is a finished product made by Harken’s cultural and heritage jeweler, Mr. Williams, who has failed over a hundred times. Some experts have determined that the golden hairpin is currently worth tens of millions, but because Mr. Williams is eccentric and does not care about money, his accessories are only sold to those he wants to. In other words, even if you have money, you may not be able to buy it.”

Jeanne listened quietly to the staff member introduce the accessories to her.

At first, she thought it would be very boring, but on the contrary, she found it quite interesting.

Monica’s makeup and hair were a little simpler, so after she was done, she listened to the staff member’s explanation with much interest.

“This is a jade bracelet.” The staff member put the bracelet on Jeanne’s wrist, and it was just the right size.

Moreover, the color was translucent, and it was very smooth. With one look, one could tell that it was expensive.

Monica also observed it very carefully. When she did not get an explanation after waiting for a long time, she said, “Why didn’t you say anything about this?”

The staff smiled. “Fourth Master said that this used to belong to his mother, so there’s no need to explain. Ms. Lawrence should know its value.”

From money to status, Fourth Master Swan was really showing off.

After all, he had already taken out his family heirloom.

Jeanne was a little moved.

Everything on her body probably could not compare to the value of that bracelet.

After a long time, her makeup and hair were finally done. By then, it was already 10 a.m. in the morning.

It really did take five hours to get a bride ready.

Just as she was all done up, she heard someone shout downstairs, “Fourth Master Swan is here to pick up the bride!”

It was clearly Nox’s voice, and he was announcing it to the world!
