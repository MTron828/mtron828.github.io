1388 Parent-Teacher Conference: You’re My Son!

George looked at Candice. He did not expect her to have so much to say.

“So, in order for us to get along better, I think we should make peace.”

“I don’t need to make peace with you.” George refused again.

It really broke her heart.

“If you want to win my father’s favor, just take good care of my sister.” George said, “I’m not important.”

Candice was stunned. Did he say he was not important because he felt that his father did not love him?

Candice’s heart ached again.

She said, “Your father is just too busy. That’s why he doesn’t have that much time to spend with you.”

“I don’t need his company,” George said firmly.

He was very mature at such a young age and did not have the nature of a child at all. It was as if he had thought through and understood everything.

“I’ll keep you company from now on.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Candice felt that she had a lot to say to George, such as Edward’s helplessness. However, in the end, she felt that there was no point in explaining too much.

What did George not know? He knew it, and that was why he acted like he did not care.

Therefore, she told him directly that she would accompany him more. She would personally participate in all the things in his life that required her presence.

At that moment, George was still a little stunned by Candice’s words.

“I don’t have much to do today anyway, so I have a lot of time to spend with you and your sister.”

“I don’t need it.” George refused again.

Candice thought to herself, ‘Why are children nowadays so hard to please?’

George and Paige were two extremes.

No matter how she tried to be nice to George, he would always be cold and resistant to her. Yet, she did not even need to be nice to Paige, and the little girl would throw herself into her arms.

Was that the difference between having a son and a daughter? No wonder so many people wanted to have a daughter.

“I don’t like anyone getting close to me,” George added.

Candice expressed that she was a little hurt.

She thought that George would be a little touched that she attended the parent-teacher conference today, but as expected, she was overthinking things.

Everyone fell silent in the car, and suddenly, no one spoke.

The car drove all the way back to Bamboo Garden.

When Teddy saw them, he rushed forward enthusiastically. “George, you’re back. How was the parent-teacher conference today? Did the teacher praise him again?”

George glanced at Teddy and did not answer.

However, Candice chimed in, “Yes, the teacher kept repeating George’s name like a recorder.”

“I knew it. Every time I attend the parent-teacher conference, I’m beaming with pride.”

“Me, too,” Candice agreed.

Just like that, the two of them chatted happily.

Of course, George would not get involved. Instead, he carried his bag and went upstairs.

“George, it’s time for lunch,” Teddy called out to him.

“Bring it up for me. I’ll eat in my room.”

With that, he disappeared before their eyes.

Teddy looked at Candice in confusion. “What’s up with him?”

“He’s not happy.”

“Why?”

“He didn’t want me to attend the parent-teacher conference.”

Teddy was a little embarrassed.

“It’s fine.” Candice chuckled. “We have to take things one step at a time.”

Teddy nodded and said seriously, “George is cold on the outside but warm on the inside.”

“I know.”

It was as if she knew George very well.

Even when George was cold to her just now, she seemed to be able to feel that it was not because George hated her, but because he was afraid that someone would replace his mother.

No one had ever told her about it. It was as if she had a special ability to know that George and his mother should have a really good relationship.

Upstairs, in George’s room, George sat in front of his desk in a daze, staring into space. He was biting his lips as if he did not want to think too much.

He took out an old notebook from the drawer in his desk, which was left for him by his mother.

No matter how much time had passed, no one could replace his mother.

He could forget about his father, but he would never forget his mother!
