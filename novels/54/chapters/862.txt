863 Jeanne and Monica’s Joint Counterattack

Monica was stunned.

Those words seemed to have opened the door to a whole new world for her.

She had always felt that from the looks of it, she was unworthy of Michael. He was now the youngest director of Harken, and with the Sanders’ support, his future was limitless. She was just a girl from a rich family with no merit.

Michael was more than enough of a match for her.

“Expose Michael’s scandal.” Jeanne had given her the answer.

Monica gritted her teeth. She had never thought about it like that and felt she could not expose herself.

What scandal could Michael possibly have?

While she had always been diligent, serious about her work, and polite to her relatives and friends, even if she exposed Michael’s schemes, she had no evidence. It was her word against his. Who would believe her?

Jeanne had indeed dug a big hole for her.

“No. Just make some for him,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Monica was stunned again. How?

“Monica, this is a world where the strong prey on the weak. If you don’t become stronger, you’ll only be constantly bullied and compromised. The first step to being powerful is to be ruthless.” Jeanne did not want to teach Monica these things, but she had to.

It was clear she could not always be by Monica’s side. She did not know if she would even still be alive in this world in the near future. She could not provide help to Monica whenever and wherever she needed it, only forcing Monica to develop on her own.

“I— What should I do?” Monica was still not confident.

“First of all, you have to be sure that you’re doing this not to let Michael down, but because Michael has been lying to you since the start, and even threatening your family now. You’re protecting yourself. There’s no need to feel guilty about it. ”

“Mm.” Monica nodded.

Jeanne was right. Michael had forced her hand. She could not pity Michael, not at any time.

“Next, you have to think carefully about what you can do to ruin Michael’s reputation.” Jeanne reminded her.

This made Monica think of how to harm people, but her mind was blank.

She broke down. “I really don’t know.”

“It’s okay. I’ve thought of something for you,” Jeanne said.

Monica’s eyes almost popped out. How could Jeanne have thought of it within a few minutes of their phone call?

“Do you remember when Finn was drugged?” Jeanne asked.

“Why would you suddenly bring up that matter?” She was already trying her best to forget.

She didn’t want to remember. It hurt to remember.

“It was Michael,” Jeanne told her frankly.

If she were to tell Monica all the truths now, she would believe her and accept it, even. It was unlike before when she might have had a mental breakdown.

“Michael bribed two of Sarah’s classmates and got them to instigate Sarah into using this method to get Finn. The purpose was to make you completely give up on Finn and be with Michael. However, the plan went wrong, and in the end, led you to consummate your marriage with Finn. However, since Michael used such a despicable method to get you, you can use it back on him. An eye for an eye.”

“You mean, you want me to find someone to drug Michael? Then, find a woman to sleep with him and take an indecent photo of him?” When Monica said this, Jeann was surprised.

“Yep,” Jeanne answered affirmatively.

“But…”

“Why don’t you just marry Michael, then? Live under the same roof with him for the rest of your life, sleep on the same bed, and even give birth to a bunch of children for him.”

“Jeanne, don’t disgust me like that!” Monica couldn’t stand it at all. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“He was so despicable that he even implicated your parents and threatened you with your family business. Why do you think you need to show him mercy?”

“I don’t need to!” Monica gritted her teeth.

Michael was evil. She did not need to leave him any room for negotiation.

“Success is not defined by whether or not you win a round, but by making the opponent unable to get up again,” Jeanne said. “If you don’t completely suppress Michael, then the next to suffer will be you, your parents, and maybe even your entire family. Monica, you can’t be soft-hearted to your enemies at any time.”

“Alright,” Monica agreed.

Jeanne was right.

Mercy to the enemy was cruelty to oneself.

“Now, let me tell you what to do. How are you going to get Michael to walk into your trap with him unprepared?” Jeanne meant business.
