Chapter 1749: Sports Day: Nox’s Moment to Shine

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After so many intimate encounters with Nox, her heart was racing this time, and it did not stop.

“Ahh! It’s starting!” Bella was so excited that she was jumping up and down.

Only then did Shelly come back to her senses. She glanced at Bella dancing with joy and then turned to look at the field, where the relay race had started. Everyone was cheering on as the most popular event of the sports games had finally begun.

Shelly, too, was a little nervous. Seeing the four teams on the field together, Shelly looked at Nox, who was the last one in line. Everyone knew the most important part of a relay race was the first and last runners, especially the last leg. Shelly did not know why, but she felt that she was being overly nervous.

After a while, it was finally time to pass the last baton. Nox’s team was temporarily ranked second from the bottom, which meant that they were ranked third, and there was already quite a distance between him and the first place.

Nox was ready. He grabbed the last baton and dashed out like a cheetah. Before he could run far, he had surpassed the second place and was heading straight for the first place.

Everyone at the scene was boiling with excitement. However, the first place felt threatened and sped up. The second Nox ran up and was about to surpass the first place, the team at first place accidentally tripped Nox over.

Caught off guard, Nox fell to the ground and secretly cursed. There was already a wound on the inside of his right leg in the car accident today, and now, he felt like his legs were about to break from the fall.

Nox’s fall shocked everyone present. They thought the team could catch up, but now it seemed like they had lost. Due to Nox’s fall, the two teams behind them surpassed them, and more importantly, Nox did not get up from the ground quickly.

“Daddy, you can do it! Daddy, you can do it!” Far away, Bella’s frantic cries sounded.

When Nox heard it, he gritted his teeth. However, because of his leg injury, he could not stand up quickly.

“Nox, come on! Come on!” From afar, he seemed to hear Shelly’s anxious voice, and it sounded like she really wanted him to stand up.

Nox’s eyes narrowed. At that moment, he quickly got up from the ground and ran as fast as he could. This time, his speed was even faster than when he started running, and his explosive power was stronger.

In the last ten meters, he surpassed third place, second place, and first place. Everyone cheered as they were shocked by Nox’s astonishing speed.

After Nox crossed the finish line, he did not stop for a long distance. He kept running forward to adjust his breathing steadily before he slowly came to a stop. When he stopped, he placed his hands on his thighs, still panting slightly.

“Daddy.” Bella’s cry rang out from behind him.

Nox straightened his back and turned around to see Shelly walking over with Bella. However, Bella hurriedly shook off Shelly’s hand and charged at Nox, who bent down slightly.

The moment Bella got closer, she reached her hand out and said, “Daddy, pick me up.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As Nox picked Bella up, the wound on his leg hurt a little, but he endured it.

“Dad, you’re amazing. You’re the most amazing dad in the world.” Bella praised Nox, her eyes beaming with happiness.

Nox felt an indescribable sense of pride. In fact, since he was young, he did not have a strong desire for victory.

He grew up with Edward and Finn, and as he was younger than them, he was a little inferior to them. Therefore, he was used to being in their shadows and had no desire to win. That was why he had the urge to give up the second he fell, but Shelly’s words of encouragement fueled his fighting spirit. He smiled at Bella. “Bella, you’re the cutest daughter in the world.”

“I love you, Daddy.”

“I love you too, Bella.” Nox kissed Bella’s little face.

Bella also returned Nox the kiss. She thought about it for a while and decided to kiss Nox on the lips with a smack. She was very pleased with herself as well.

For a second, Nox was stunned. He could not believe how mischievous that little girl was, but he did not mind. On the contrary, Shelly did mind it, but she did not know why she felt that way. After all, Bella was only three years old and did not know anything at all, so it was not a big deal for Bella to kiss Nox.

At that moment, she watched as Nox carried Bella out of the field since other groups were still competing. While Shelly was staring at their backs, she noticed that Nox’s right leg looked a little different when he walked.

Did he fall badly just now? She could not tell from the way he stood up and ran. Moreover, his speed was shocking fast.

Nox carried Bella and played outside the field for a while. At the end of the sports day, it was announced that Bella’s class had gotten first place in the relay race, so Nox brought Bella to the stage to receive the award.

The duo also won first place in the sports games in class, and Bella was over the moon. Under the envious gazes of the entire class, she accepted a gold medal as a reward.. That was the first time Shelly had seen Bella so proud!
