“It’s fine,” Shelly suddenly said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She wanted to make it clear to Benjamin that she had never thought of anyone helping her and neither did she want anyone to sympathize with her. More importantly, she did not want to implicate anyone. Hence, she said, “Benjamin, you can go back.”

“Shelly.”

“As I’ve said, I’ve never thought of dating, so don’t waste your time on me. It’s not easy for me to fall in love with someone.” Shelly seemed very cold.

For so many years, she had been able to take on everything on her own, which proved that she was not so fragile.

“I can’t deny that I really like you and really want to be with you. However, I won’t force you to be with me. If you don’t want to, I won’t cross the line.” Instead of turning around and leave because of Shelly’s rejection, Benjamin said, “I just hope that I can be with you, even when I don’t have the power to help you. I won’t do anything, and neither can I do anything, but I just want to be with you so that you won’t be so lonely.”

Shelly’s throat moved slightly, and she just looked at Benjamin, without agreeing or rejecting him outright. At that moment, she could actually feel Benjamin’s pain and how helpless he was.

“I’ll go back to school first.” Benjamin did not make things difficult for Shelly either.

Shelly felt that all the men in the world were different from Nox, who would never understand how she felt and whose happiness always came first. All the other men were better than Nox!

Benjamin took off his apron, and before he left, he went to the bedroom, probably to say goodbye to Bella.

Bella really liked Benjamin, so when she heard that Benjamin was leaving, she almost cried. However, Benjamin comforted her and left.

When he left, Shelly did not say goodbye to him. She believed that they should part aways before they had any feelings for each other. After all, she did not want to hurt anyone.

Three days later, Zoe exposed the video of Nox cheating on her while they were dating. Once the video was exposed, it caused a sensation throughout the country.

The entire country had originally been one-sided in their criticism of Zoe. However, now that such shocking news had broken out, the people were furious, and they started to denounce Nox.

At first, they only criticized Zoe before they moved on to both Zoe and Nox. Later on, more and more people started bashing Nox.

Seizing the opportunity, Zoe also released a video that she had recorded, where she appeared on screen without makeup and looking extremely haggard. She complained about all the bad things Nox had done to her over the years and how Nox’s private life was more chaotic than hers.

She also admitted that before she met Nox, she had indeed made many friends and that she was young and ignorant. However, after she got together with Nox, she really wanted to be with Nox. Unexpectedly, Nox still could not change his habit of being a playboy. Hence, she endured it for many years because she loved Nox very much, but she really could not stand him treating her like that, so she used the same method to take revenge on Nox.

She even said that she had no choice but to expose the video. She had tried many times to reconcile with Nox and break up amicably, but Nox had rejected all of them. Now that The Sullivan Group was in danger because of Nox’s sudden withdrawal of the funds, she had no choice but to reveal the truth to After Zoe’s own video was released, Nox’s image plummeted. Some people even began to sympathize with Zoe, saying that she was the biggest victim between them. In fact, calling Nox a sc*mbag was kind enough.

A breakup would reveal one’s true colors, and to hit Zoe when she was down, Nox was not a gentleman at all! Hence, the people strongly requested Nox not to expand her personal grudge to a family!

Of course, there were many internet ghostwriters among them, but they still effectively incited this incident, allowing Zoe to benefit from it.

Nox called Shelly the day after Zoe’s video was exposed. Shelly, too, had read the tabloid and quite a lot of them at that, so she naturally saw the heat between Zoe and Nox. However, she did not care who would win or lose in the end. She was only concerned about how she was exposed in the video that Zoe had exposed.

Fortunately, Harken was a nation that did not allow such elicit content to be posted on the internet. It was too revealing to be posted publicly, so her entire body was censored. Even her face was censored, leaving only Nox’s face..
