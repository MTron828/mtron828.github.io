1327 Asking for Hand in Marriage

Edward looked up at Chloe. Chloe quickly explained, “This is my mother’s specialty. Try it.”

“Thank you.” Edward smiled faintly.

He was just upholding decorum whereas in Chloe’s eyes, it was a form of intimacy.

It had been known that the Chief seldom smiled, yet he smiled so naturally at her.

She blinked in anticipation as she watched Edward eat the braised beef.

“Is it good?” Chloe asked.

“It’s delicious,” Edward commented.

“I knew you’d like it. I specially asked Mom to prepare it for you today. Mom was worried that you weren’t used to home-cooked food and didn’t want to make it.” Chloe looked very lively at the table. “Mom, look. Edward likes it very much.”

“I’m glad you enjoyed it. I’m just worried that you won’t like it if I make it too homely,” Claire quickly echoed.

The atmosphere at the dining table was not as awkward, thanks to Chloe.

“No, I like it very much. Thank you.” Edward was still very polite.

“Eat more if you like it,” Claire quickly called out.

From time to time, Chloe would take the initiative to put food on Edward’s plate.

She just looked innocent, cute, and warm. Although she did not obtain any honor since she was young, every time her parents brought her out, her social skills and ability to please her elders were much better than others her age. Therefore, in the eyes of her elders, she had always been very likable.

She believed that Edward would like it too. She had always been very proactive.

Just then, Edward suddenly picked up a piece of pine mushroom and placed it on Candice’s plate.

Candice was surprised. She looked up at Edward and Edward returned her gaze with a chuckle. Candice smiled back.

The interaction between the two of them felt inexplicably warm. It was as if they had been husband and wife for a long time. It was natural and affectionate.

Chloe’s expression turned a little ugly, even though she hid it well.

Her eyes flickered.

She took the initiative to pick up a piece of braised beef and placed it in Candice’s bowl. “Candice, you’re so skinny. Eat more meat to nourish yourself.”

It was to show that the two of them were very close and that she was treating her sister exceptionally well.

“Thank you.” Candice smiled.

Although she knew very well why Chloe was acting like this today, she would not embarrass Chloe at the Nicholsons’ dinner table.

She picked up the piece of braised beef and was about to eat it.

“I thought you didn’t like to eat fatty meat?” Edward suddenly said.

Candice was stunned. Since when did she not like to eat fatty meat?

“Give it to me,” Edward said.

As he spoke, he opened his mouth.

Candice was a little… embarrassed. After all, it was a little awkward to feed him in front of the elders. She, however, did not dare to go against Edward’s wishes since he had already opened his mouth.

She had no choice but to feed Edward the piece of braised beef that she was about to put into her mouth.

Edward ate it and could not help but comment again, “Claire’s braised beef is really delicious.”

“It is. Help yourself to more of it. I’ll make everything for you when you come to our house in the future,” Claire said happily.

She was also surprised by the interaction between Edward and Candice.

The two of them did not seem to have interacted much but now it seemed like they had been dating for a long time. She thought that these two’s relationship was going well. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Of course, she would not show it too much. After all, to the Nicholsons, being able to marry the Chief was in itself elevating their status. Of course, she could not wait for her daughter to have a better relationship with Edward too.

Only Chloe’s expression was extremely ugly. Putting aside the fact that Edward and Candice’s relationship was so good that it made her jealous, she even felt that Edward’s actions just now were clearly rejecting her enthusiasm.

It just seemed like… he was doing it on purpose for her to see.

She bit her lip. Perhaps Edward was just doing it for her parents to see.

After all, Edward and Candice were in a political marriage. Political marriages were more awkward, so they needed to perform.

‘That must be it,’ she thought to herself comfortingly. She was also constantly cheering herself on!

Ever since she was young, any boy who liked Candice would fall in love with her immediately after seeing her. Edward would be no exception!
