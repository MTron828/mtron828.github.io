“You will definitely regret it. You will definitely regret it!” Belle screamed.

She had reached the point of madness and could not suppress it anymore.

Perhaps in her heart, she was sure that Jasmine’s child was Jeanne’s doing and felt that the Swans were being unfair.

Although she had married into the family for many years, those who could marry the Swans were from large families that were either rich or noble. Most of them had never suffered such a grievance before. If they were to burst out in rage, they could not care less about the consequences!

“Eden, drag your mother away! This is simply embarrassing!” Henry hurriedly called out to Eden.

Only then did Eden seem to come to his senses.

He quickly went forward to pull Belle up and bring her away.

Everyone understood that Old Master Swan was hell-bent on protecting Jeanne today, so no matter how hard they tried, they would not be able to turn the situation around. On the contrary, they might really be kicked out of the family!

As to being kicked out of the family, no one dared to try.

Initially, they had thought of using such methods to force Old Master Swan to divorce Edward from Jeanne. Yet now, it seemed like they had really failed to turn the tables.

Eden’s expression was hideous.

Not only did he lose his baby, but he also did not get any benefits!

He suppressed his anger and dragged his mother away harshly.

......

In the main hall, Belle’s heart-wrenching echoed. “Zachary Swan, karma will get back at you one day. It’s because of your unfair treatment that Jeanne can act so unbridledly in this family. In the end, it’s you who killed your own great-grandson. You’re the murdered– Ah...” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Eden gritted his teeth and used all his strength to drag her mother away!

“Can I say a few words?”

At this moment, in the main hall, Jeanne suddenly opened her mouth amidst Belle’s crazy cries.

Everyone looked at her as she said, “We can’t let this matter go just like that.”

“How do you still have the cheek to say that?” Elaine could not stand it anymore, and seeing that Jeanne had spoken, she vented her anger on Jeanne.

“Although dad is certain I didn’t do such a thing, no one will truly think I’m innocent. In fact, you’ll only think that dad is intentionally biased toward me. In return, it’ll only create a misunderstanding toward dad, and it’s also a form of injury to me.” Jeanne enunciated each word as she said, “I don’t want dad’s trust in me to be the reason everyone thinks dad is unfair to this family!”

“Don’t try to pretend to be nice,” Elaine mocked.

Jeanne ignored Elaine and turned her head toward Belle, who was shackled by Eden. She said, “Didn’t you say that I was the one who killed your grandchild? You may not have any evidence to prove I did it, but I have evidence to prove I didn’t do it!”

“What evidence do you have?” Belle glared at Jeanne.

At that moment, half of her face was still swollen.

Jeanne glanced at Belle before facing everyone and saying, “Elaine and Belle are very sure that the root cause of Jasmine’s miscarriage was that I was jealous of Jasmine...”

“Isn’t that so?” Elaine continued.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed as she looked at Elaine coldly.

At that moment, Elaine was actually a little scared by Jeanne’s gaze, for she suddenly felt a chill on her back, making her hairs stand.

However, the next second, she straightened her back again and still did not take Jeanne seriously.

“Sister, have you got more to say?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

Elaine was stunned.

“If you do, you can continue. I’ll continue when you’re done.”

Elaine gritted her teeth. What else could she say now?

Her father was completely on Jeanne’s side. What else could she say that would not offend her father? Seeing how Belle was treated, she did not want to end up the same.

Hence, she glared at Jeanne.

However, Jeanne’s cold voice revealed that she did not care if she humiliated Elaine. “Interrupting others is very rude. Sister, you grew up in the Swans, so there’s no way you weren’t taught this. At least when you were talking just now, I didn’t interrupt.”

“You!” Elaine was somewhat embarrassed by Jeanne’s lecture.

Jeanne glanced at Elaine, looking at her twisted face, and asked bluntly, “Second sister, do you still have anything else to say?”
