Chapter 1710: Zoe’s Visit

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He really wanted to apologize to her and the child they had lost. However, in the face of Shelly’s indifference, Nox held his tongue.

He watched as Shelly, whose attitude toward him had been lukewarm, turned around and went back to doing her own thing. Hence, Nox silently sat on the bench and continued peeling garlic. In the kitchen, no one spoke again, and it was quiet.

After dinner. Shelly would shower Bella and put Bella to bed before returning to her room. Usually, Nox would lie on the sofa and watch TV or play games while waiting for her, and it was the same tonight.

The moment Nox took out his phone and was about to play a game, his phone suddenly rang.

Nox looked at a familiar phone number and answered the call. “Hello.”

“Nox, it’s me, Zoe.”

Nox’s expression changed immediately.

When he was about to hang up, he heard her say, “I know you don’t want to answer my call, but I just want to tell you that I don’t mind getting an abortion.”

Nox’s eyes narrowed. “What tricks are you playing now?”

“I admit that I have a motive, but I have no choice. Nox, I’m downstairs.” Zoe hung up the phone after that.

Nox gritted his teeth and rushed out of the house at lightning speed.

Shelly had just coaxed Bella to sleep and opened the door to see Nox leaving the house anxiously. She did not know what he was up to, but without him around, she could relax a little. Hence, she returned to her room and did her own thing.

The moment Nox walked downstairs, he saw Zoe standing under a street lamp and waiting for him alone from afar.

He walked up to her and said, “Tell me, what do you want?”

“Nox, was our relationship nothing to you? The child in my stomach is yours.” Zoe was a little unhappy when she saw Nox’s cold-blooded appearance.

“Let me ask you again. What do you want?” Nox did not have much patience with Zoe.

Zoe held it in. She also knew that if Nox said he could ignore her, he would.

She said bluntly, “I don’t mind aborting the child. In fact, I can even tell your mother that the child is not yours, but I want some money. Then, I’ll make sure there won’t be any conflict between you and your mother.” “Tell me your purpose.” Nox did not want to waste any time.

Zoe said, “I want a sum of money.”

Nox just stared at her.

“You know I’m short of money. I admit that I kept the child at first because I wanted to get back together with you. Although I messed around with a lot of men, you were the only one I liked the most, and I did want to be with you again. However, after seeing how cruel and cold-blooded you were to me, I gave up. Since we can’t get back together, I don’t want to use the child to tie you down, and it’s unfair on the child. I don’t want him to be born fatherless either.” Zoe made things clear.

“However, I’m still pregnant with your child, and I’ve suffered so much. Even if I was wrong in the past, I’ve paid it all off with this child, and I don’t owe you anything. That’s why I’m asking you for money!”

“How much do you want?” Nox asked.

It was so straightforward that even Zoe was surprised. She thought that Nox would at least reject her. After all, Nox could never be threatened. Fortunately, she was right about Nox not wanting to have any conflict with his parents.

She said, “One million dollars.”

Nox frowned slightly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Seeing the change in his expression, Zoe quickly said, “Nox, you destroyed our business and made us lose tens of millions of dollars, so what’s wrong with me taking back one million dollars? That is the least I’m willing to accept. If it’s anything lower than this, we’ll have to have a proper talk. I know I can’t resist you and will lose the child sooner or later, but I guarantee I’ll ruin your relationship with your mother!”

“I’ll give it to you.” Nox suddenly agreed.

However, Zoe did not believe him.

“I’m not threatened by you. I just don’t want to have anything to do with you anymore!” Nox said, “I’m afraid of Shelly misunderstanding the situation.” Zoe’s expression darkened.

She could not help but ask, “Are you together with Shelly? Didn’t you say you disliked her? Didn’t you hated her to the core?”

“That’s none of your business!”

“Nox, you’re hilarious,” Zoe mocked.

“Have you said enough?” Nox’s expression was ugly.

“I suddenly realize that you’re no better than me!” Zoe sneered. “I guess Shelly will never fall in love with you.”

Nox looked at Zoe coldly, and Zoe pursed her lips, gloating.

She said, “I’ll go for an abortion tomorrow, but I need you to come with me. I need the best doctor. I can’t hurt my body.”

“Alright.” Nox agreed.

“Also, before the abortion tomorrow, I want to see 500 thousand dollars in my account. You can give me the other 500 thousand after the abortion. I’ll send you the account number later.” Zoe stated her conditions.

“Anything else?” Nox looked impatient.

Zoe was still unhappy with Nox’s attitude toward her. He used to treat her so well back then, but now, he had turned hostile..
