Chapter 164: Jeanne’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Melody pursed her lips.

She was forced by Jeanne.

She turned to Micheal and asked, “Have you found out Jeanne’s background?”

“I haven’t,” Micheal answered bluntly, “What I know now is that seven years ago, Jeanne’s reputation was very bad because of the matter with Eden. She was cruelly sent out of the country by the Lawrences. The decision to send her abroad was made by the Swans. At that time, the Lawrences weren’t going to go so far, but they couldn’t withstand the pressure from the Swans and sent her away.

“After sending Jeanne abroad, the Lawrences didn’t bother about her anymore. On one hand, it was a punishment for her. On the other hand, their stocks in the market plunged due to the incident with Jeanne. The Lawrences spent a lot of effort to stabilize the situation, so they didn’t have time to care about her. As a result, she was left to fend for herself overseas.”

“How did she survive? How did she give birth to the child?”

“Jeanne was abroad at that time. She didn’t have a diploma and relied on doing many lowly jobs to survive. For example, washing dishes, sweeping the streets, and performing on the streets. She did many jobs that could allow her to survive, no matter how lowly they were. From what I could find out, Jeanne met a chef in a restaurant in Sontar. The chef liked her very much, but the two of them didn’t date, so I can’t be sure that he’s George’s father. That man left Sontar not long ago and was an illegal migrant worker, so his identity was all fake. It was very difficult to find out anything more than that.”

Melody listened attentively.

Micheal continued, “Medical treatment is too expensive abroad, so Jeanne didn’t go for pregnancy checkups from the time she was pregnant to the time she gave birth. As a result, she didn’t know that the fetus was reversed. According to the locals, someone from Harken almost died in a rented house. It was probably Jeanne.”

“Then why didn’t she die? How did she give birth to the child?”

“It was said that a man took Jeanne away from that low-class rented house. From then on, she never appeared in that place again.” Micheal looked at Melody and added, “We can infer that she was saved by someone.”

“Who?”

“I couldn’t find out. I spent a lot of effort but couldn’t find anything. I couldn’t even find any clues.”

Melody frowned. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

‘Who was that person?!

‘Who was helping Jeanne behind the scenes?!’

“After that, Jeanne reappeared three years ago. In other words, other than the year when she went abroad to give birth to George, she had completely disappeared for three years. As for what she did and experienced during those three years, there’s no way to find out. When Jeanne finally reappeared after three years, she had been reborn,” Micheal said straightforwardly, “I specifically investigated Jeanne’s work experience in MUK. A part of it was luck, but really, she relied on her capabilities. To put it simply, half of MUK’s empire was established by Jeanne on behalf of West!”

Melody did not believe it.

“I wouldn’t have believed it either if I hadn’t looked into it.” Micheal was very certain. “This is why I think that the reason MUK was able to come to South Hampton City to develop the e-commerce project this time was that Jeanne had probably planned it long ago. We took the wrong path from the beginning when we spent a lot of effort to stop the development of the project!”

“We were played by Jeanne from the very beginning!” Melody gritted her teeth.

Micheal nodded.

He nodded and said, “I’ve said a lot, but the most important thing is...”

Melody frowned slightly.

“When Chief asked me to meet you, he asked us not to fight with Jeanne.”

Melody was stunned.

“Yes, he personally told me.”

Micheal affirmed again.
