When the car arrived at Nox’s neighborhood, Nox paid and returned to his own apartment.

He lay on the sofa, feeling a little hopeless. He could not believe that he, the Young Master Winter, would be ridiculed by the entire nation one day. Then, he suddenly recalled how Shelly was on her phone and laughing at him that day!

He cursed as he kicked the coffee table hard. He had a feeling that he would never be able to get over it in his life!

While he was fuming, the phone suddenly rang. He picked the phone up, glanced at the caller ID, and hung up. He even blacklisted that person. From now on, Zoe was banned from his life. He would never have anything to do with that woman again.

Nox got up impatiently and went to take a shower. He planned to take a nap after to forget everything. Just as he came out of the shower, he casually put on a towel and was about to lie on the bed when someone knocked on the door.

Nox opened the door impatiently. He thought it was his mother, so he did not look at who was at the door through the camera. It was only when he opened the door that he saw Zoe standing outside.

Nox instinctively closed the door, but Zoe quickly used her body to stop it. As such, the door slammed hard on her body, and it was obvious that she was in pain.

Tears welled up in Zoe’s eyes. She, who already looked weak without makeup, looked even weaker now.

“Nox, I just wanted to talk to you. I called, but you didn’t pick up,” Zoe said with a sobbing tone.

“I have nothing to say to you. I even find you disgusting. Get lost!”

“I know I’ve let you down, and that’s why I want to apologize to you. I also know that nothing I say will help. I’ve never thought of asking for your forgiveness, but I just want to apologize to you. I really didn’t want to do this. I was forced. 1-”

Nox sneered. ‘Forced? Yes, you were forced to have an affair with another man, and that was why you looked so lewd!’

“I regret it too. I wanted to be with you, but those men threatened me. I was afraid that you would despise me, so I had no choice but to compromise…”

“Don’t you use the word compromise.” Nox interrupted her, refusing to listen to her explanation. “If you just want to explain to me why you did those unsightly things, I’m telling you now that no matter what your reason is, I won’t forgive you. You’re a b*tch to me, and you’ll never be able to clear your name for the rest of your life.”

Tears streamed down Zoe’s face as she listened to Nox’s heartless words. She knew that Nox, or any man, would never forgive her. However, recently, she had been subjected to a lot of cyberbullying. Some people even sent her dolls with broken arms and legs, scaring her to death.

On top of that, Nox had just told the media that he would withdraw his investment from The Sullivan Group. Once he withdrew his investment, The Sullivan Group would be finished, and neither she nor her family could not bear the consequences! Therefore, she had no choice but to ask for Nox’s forgiveness. Moreover, she had to admit that the only person she truly loved was Nox.

“If you understand, get lost!” Nox said coldly and emotionlessly.

Zoe really did not expect Nox to be so indifferent to her. She thought that even if Nox did not forgive her, he would not be so cold to her.

She bit her lips and said with tears in her eyes, “Nox, I know I’ve let you down. I also know that we can’t be together anymore, but my parents didn’t do anything wrong. I hope what I did won’t affect my parents. My family shouldn’t suffer because of what I did. It’s unfair to them.”

“Heh.” Nox sneered and said sarcastically, “So you think I should be an idiot and invest in your family so that they can live a luxurious life and continue to give you money to fool around with men?”

“That’s not what I meant. That’s not what I meant…

“Zoe, everyone has to be responsible for their actions! Since you had the guts to do this, you should’ve thought of all the consequences. Let me put it this way. Not only am I going to withdraw my investment, but I’m also going to make your The Sullivan Group go bankrupt and lose everything! ”

“Nox-”

“Get lost! ” Nox snapped, showing Zoe no mercy..
