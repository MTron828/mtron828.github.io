Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Lawren Enterprise marketing director’s office.

Teddy said, “You should trust me.”

Jeanne recovered from her slight shock.

She actually never thought that the phone belonged to Teddy.

She said and nodded, “Yes.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

However, it was actually not important.

She had never thought of it as a big deal. In a few days, she would have forgotten about it.

“Then I’ll be leaving first.” Teddy saw that he had finally explained things clearly and was prepared to leave.

“Mr. Dolittle,” Jeanne called out to him.

“Ms. Lawrence, is there anything else?”

Jeanne said, “I downloaded them back for you. It’s on the phone.”

“What?” Teddy did not know how to react for a moment.

“The ones you deleted yesterday...”

“The videos?” Teddy raised his eyebrows.

“Yes.”

“...”

“I originally thought it was Fourth Master Swan’s,” Jeanne said straightforwardly.

So, Ms. Lawrence had done it for Fourth Master Swan.

“Anyway, I hope you’ll like it.”

Of course, he would.

He said, “Ms. Lawrence, I’ll go first then.”

“Take care, Mr. Dolittle.”

Teddy left.

After leaving, Jeanne took a deep breath.

The face of Fourth Master Swan suddenly appeared in her mind.

That beautiful face was too lethal.

She also suddenly remembered the kiss last night…

Actually, she did not even think about it when she was sleeping last night. Instead, at this moment, she was a little affected by the kiss.

Was it because she misunderstood Fourth Master Swan, so she felt a little guilty?

…

Teddy took the phone and returned to Fourth Master Swan’s side.

He handed it over respectfully. “Fourth Master, I’ve brought the phone back.”

“Leave it.” Fourth Master Swan was processing his official documents and did not raise his head.

In fact, Fourth Master Swan was busier than everyone thought.

Teddy had been by his side for a long time. He always felt that if he had not been taking care of Edward’s daily life, Edward might just die suddenly one day.

Teddy put down the phone and turned to leave.

“Did Ms. Lawrence say anything?” Edward, who had his head lowered as he processed the documents, suddenly asked.

Teddy hurriedly said, “The misunderstanding has been resolved. Ms. Lawrence has already believed that the phone is mine.”

“Okay,” Edward replied.

“By the way, Ms. Lawrence also gave you a gift.” Teddy hurriedly picked up the phone again.

Edward’s hand that was holding the pen paused for a moment.

He looked very calm. “What?”

“Here.” Teddy found the content and handed the phone to him respectfully.

The content was called “Treating you with courtesy.”

Fourth Master Swan had always been a stern person, but the corners of his lips curled up slightly then.

Teddy felt that ever since Ms. Lawrence came back, Edward had started smiling more often.

Fourth Master Swan casually clicked on the content.

The smile on his face instantly froze.

He raised his eyes to look at Teddy.

Teddy’s eyes flickered. “I’m guessing that Ms. Lawrence... feels that you need it.”

“Get out!”

“Yes.” Teddy hurriedly left.

Edward turned off the content.

He put down the phone and thought for a moment before picking it up again.

For such a long time, their contact was only limited to phone calls. They had never added each other as friends on any other communication applications.

Jeanne had just returned to the office after dinner when she received a friend request on her phone.

She clicked on it casually.

When she clicked on it, she saw that the name of the friend request was “Ed”

Jeanne knew at a glance that it was the Fourth master Swan.

Even though the name was a little different.

She hesitated for a moment, but she still accepted the request.

After she accepted.

[ Ed: Thank you for your gift, Ms. Lawrence. ]

Jeanne frowned.

What gift?

When the other side did not receive her reply, he sent another message over.

[ Ed: it’s just the content is not what I like. ]

Jeanne instantly understood.

Teddy must have told him about it.

Jeanne pursed her lips and typed.

[ Jeannie: What does Fourth Master like? ]

[ Ed: You. ]

[ Jeannie: ... ]

[ Ed: Teddy is right. I’m only interested in Ms. Lawrence’s body. ]

[ Jeannie: ... ]

[ Ed: Next time, Ms. Lawrence can show more sincerity. ]

Damn it.

Damn hooligan!

[ Jeannie: Fourth Master, I’m about to have a meeting, so I won’t chat anymore. ]

[ Ed: Okay. ]

Jeanne sent a picture of “Goodbye”.

Then, she directly exited the chat and did not want to see a single word from Fourth Master Swan anymore.

She took a deep breath.

Who the hell said that the Fourth Master Swan was cold and ascetic?

How could a cold and ascetic person be... like this?

Who said that Fourth Master Swan never talked to strangers?

To Jeanne, he was like the king of flirting.

She could feel herself burning up from the thought of it.
