1129 The War Has Started: The Battle of Wits Between Jeanne and Edward

Edward immediately stood up and left, ignoring how angry Old Master Swan was.

Nox, on the other hand, hesitated for two seconds. Although he was hesitating, he felt happy.

Ever since they were young, they had always followed Old Master Swan’s orders and had never rebutted him. Hence, at that moment, he felt so happy!

He hurriedly got up from the ground and quickly chased after Edward.

Wade looked at his grandson. Before he could call out to Nox, he saw him dashing away at the speed of lightning.

He was so angry that he gritted his teeth. “This stinky brat!”

Zachary was also furious. He sat back in his chair, his expression unsightly.

After Wade scolded his grandson, he looked at Zachary’s expression and quickly comforted him, “Old master, Edward is also in a fit of anger. We’ve watched him grow up, he won’t go astray.”

“I know.” Although Zachary was angry, he knew his son’s character very well.

However, he just could not suppress his temper after being talked back to like that today.

“It’ll be fine when his anger subsides. The most important thing now is how to help the Duncans push the Sanders back,” Wade said.

Zachary nodded his head. “What I’m angry about now is finding out what kind of father Edward sees me as all these years. I’ve always thought that I was competent enough. At the very least, compared to my other sons, I’ve put more effort into raising and educating him.”

“Edward understands.” Wade said with certainty, “He’s just venting it out now. Old Master, you have to understand Edward. Now that he has killed Kingsley, it will be difficult for him to be with Jeanne. Him losing his temper is a good thing too. At least we know what he’s thinking now. He has to let it all out because if he doesn’t, we really wouldn’t know what he’ll do!”

“I’ve already warned him about his relationship with Jeanne,” Zachary said solemnly.

“None of us would have guessed that Jeanne was Warren’s daughter.” Wade also looked helpless. “If Jeanne had nothing to do with Warren, this matter would be so difficult to deal with.”

“That’s why what I’m most worried about now is that Edward won’t be able to lay his hands on Jeanne.”

“I understand, Old Master. However, I don’t think you should interfere in Edward and Jeanne’s matters. Edward isn’t someone who doesn’t care about anything. We should trust him.”

“He’s my son. I know what he’ll do. What I’m afraid of is that the Duncans don’t trust him.” Zachary said, “Every new sovereign brings his own courtiers. Once the Duncans take the throne, the first thing they have to do is to eliminate those who disagree with them. When that time comes... It’s hard to say.”

“Putting aside the fact that Edward is your son, Edward is still Alex’s younger brother.” Wade comforted Zachary, “So, there’s still a chance for the situation to turn around.”

“I hope so.”

Hopefully, nothing unexpected would happen!

…

Edward returned to Bamboo Garden.

He sat on the sofa without saying a word, and his expression was extremely ugly.

Teddy watched from the side and did not even dare to breathe.

Yesterday, after Finn picked George up, George had not returned home. Teddy had wanted to ask Fourth Master when George would be back, but for some reason, ever since he took care of George, the two of them had spent a lot of time together, and he was a little reluctant to part with George.

However, now that he saw Fourth Master’s expression, how could he ask the question?

With that, he stood at the side and watched as Nox quickly ran into the hall.

“Why were you walking so fast?” Nox sat down beside Edward, panting heavily.

Edward did not reply.

“Actually, what’s the use of throwing a tantrum at your dad just now? You can’t really disobey him anyway,” Nox said faintly.

Although it felt good just now, when he thought about how his happiness was built on his brother’s pain, he had no choice but to comfort Edward.

Edward remained silent and sat there in the hall.

Nox leaned back on the sofa, looking a lot more relaxed. I told you, you can’t fall in love so easily. Look at you. You’ve only loved this one woman in your life, yet you’re so hurt! I could see that Jeanne was looking at you like she wanted to kill you. The next time we meet, she definitely will not go soft on you–”
