Chapter 205: Furious, and Another Slap in the Face

In the court, Lunetta was rendered speechless.

She did not expect to be exposed so suddenly and thoroughly.

“Ms. Walker.” Judah waited for a while but did not receive a reply. He called her name again, clearly with a threatening aura.

Lunetta gritted her teeth.

She said fiercely, “Yes, I was the one who wrote it.”

The corners of Judah’s mouth curled up.

Everyone else in the court also looked at her.

Joshua was on the verge of collapsing in the audience seats.

His body was trembling.

Eden could not care less at this moment.

He had never thought that there would be such a sudden reversal.

In the extremely quiet court, Lunetta continued, “It was Jeanne who forced me to write it!”

Judah’s face suddenly darkened.

Jeanne’s eyes also tensed up.

Joshua was stunned.

Eden felt lucky at this moment.

“Are you sure that Jeanne forced you? Ms. Walker, you have to think carefully before you answer. This is a court...”

“I didn’t dare to admit it because I was afraid of being implicated. Jeanne asked me to help her write this contract. I didn’t think too much at that time. I’m an employee of the Lawrence Enterprise while Jeanne is a Lawrence and my boss. I’ll do whatever my boss wants me to do...”

Judah’s face turned cold. “What benefits did my client give you for you to help her draft the dual contract?”

“I told you—I work for the Lawrence Enterprise. Jeanne doesn’t have to give me any benefits. I’ll carry out her orders.”

“Ms. Walker, do you know that this contract is illegal? Just from the contract alone, no one else should be able to see anything strange. However, you’ve personally drafted the contract for the Lawrence Enterprise’s e-commerce project. You’re familiar with all the terms and conditions. You should be able to see that there’s a problem!” Judah said.

“As I said, I work for the Lawrence Enterprise. As a qualified employee, I’ll do whatever my boss tells me to do. I won’t ask too many questions.” Lunetta insisted.

Judah’s expression changed slightly.

The court was in a stalemate for a while.

“Ms. Walker, don’t you feel that your words are inconsistent?” Judah continued to say.

Lunetta was trying her best to keep calm.

“I asked you just now if both contracts were done by you...”

“I said that I was afraid of being implicated, which was why I denied it!”

“Please watch your emotions, Ms. Walker, and hear me out!” Judah enunciated each word.

Lunetta was very nervous.

It was obvious that she was nervous, but she was trying her best to control herself. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Judah continued, “Earlier, you told me that the e-commerce project’s contract was written by you, but this dual contract was not. If I remember correctly, you said that my client went to you to ask about the contract, and you also answered that you were indeed involved in the e-commerce project’s contract. If my client knew that these two contracts were written by you, why would she waste her time asking you alone?! Where is your logic?!”

“There’s no logic. I was lying just now. In order to not get implicated, I deliberately made up a set of lies to not be involved in this. In fact, these two contracts were written by me, but I wasn’t involved in anything. If you don’t believe me, you can look into my accounts. I’m innocent!” Lunetta pointed out that Jeanne was the one who instructed her to do so.

At first, everyone thought that Jeanne might have really been framed, but at this moment, the development of the case started to deviate again because of Lunetta’s words.

Joshua said with some pride, “Jeanne must’ve not expected to be attacked.”

Eden was not as optimistic as Joshua.

Nonetheless, if Lunetta kept on putting the blame on Jeanne, they still had hope of winning.

In the court, Judah seemed to be silent for quite a while.

It gave people the feeling that he seemed to have lost his confidence.

Even his imposing manner was reduced by a lot.

The public prosecutor’s attorney, Josiah, stood up and was about to speak.

Judah suddenly sighed heavily. Then, he raised his head to face the judge and said, “Luckily, I still have evidence.”

Everyone in the court was nervous again.

Lunetta looked straight at Judah.

Judah said, “Ms. Walker, I heard that you and Adrian Zimmer have some unspeakable collusion.”

Lunetta was obviously frightened. She shook her head. “What nonsense are you talking about?! You’re insulting me! How could I have anything to do with Chief Engineer Zimmer?!”

“You’re very capable, Ms. Walker. That said, Mr. Zimmer must’ve helped you a lot for you to be able to rise from a little secretary to the position of secretary-general in just five years.”
