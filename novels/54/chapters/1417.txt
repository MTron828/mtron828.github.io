“After we got together, when I almost died at home because of appendicitis,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn’s heart ached. Therefore, it was not that Monica did not want to start over with him. It was he who did not cherish her.

In fact, he regretted it that time. When he found out that Monica was hospitalized, he felt very guilty, but he thought Monica understood.

He had told her that he had to perform a risky heart surgery on a patient whom he tried to resuscitate for three days and later required surgery, which lasted nearly 12 hours.

She did not blame him at that time, so he thought that she understood the situation. However, he did not realize that she had chosen to forgive him because she no longer had any hope for him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Since there was no expectation, she did not blame him.

Finn’s eyes were frighteningly red. He said, “It’s been a year since your appendicitis.”

It was only a year later that she proposed to break up.

“Yes, it took me a year to let go of you.”

What did he do in the year Monica was letting go of him? He thought their relationship was stable.

Finn watched as Monica left with Brandon after laying everything out and stayed there until the taillights disappear in front of him.

What did he say about using the same method Monica used to woo him back then to woo Monica back? It was really too difficult!

In the car, Monica, on the other hand, had tears streaming down her face. Although she said she had let go, she still could not control her body’s instinctual reaction.

Brandon remained silent at the side. He did not understand why Monica would turn around and leave even though she was still in love.

He really believed that Finn and Monica both loved each other very much. Why would two people who loved each other so much force each other to this point?

“Monica.” Brandon was so afraid that she would faint from crying.

Monica slowly calmed herself down.

“Do you want to try again with Finn? Maybe there really is a huge misunderstanding between the two of you-”

“Didn’t you say you like me?” Monica interrupted him.

Brandon’s heartbeat quickened. Although he did like her, he did not want to take advantage of her when she was still in so much pain. However, he could not help but get excited when he heard what she said.

“If you like me, don’t mention Finn anymore.” “Does that mean I can pursue you?”

“If you want to…” Monica looked at Brandon. “Be a father.”

Brandon was stunned. ‘Is that a lie? Please don’t joke around like that!’

In the bustling South Hampton City, the night was a blur.

In the car, Nox was making a fuss, and Zoe could not help him back

“I haven’t had enough. I still want to drink. Where are you taking me?!” Nox was restless.

“You’re drunk. Be good. We’re going back to sleep.”

“Zoe, do you know how good my alcohol tolerance is? How dare you say

I’m drunk?!”

“Nox, stop fooling around.” “If you bring me back today, I’ll fight you to death.” Zoe was speechless.

“I want to go to the nightclub,” Nox suddenly said.

“You’re drunk-”

“I said I want to go to the nightclub!” Nox was determined.

Zoe could not take it anymore and said to the driver, “Bring us to the nightclub.”

The chauffeur quickly nodded. “Yes!”

With that, Zoe brought Nox, who could not even walk steadily, to the nightclub.

After Zoe helped Nox into the luxurious private room in the nightclub, Nox ordered a bunch of wine while Zoe sat with him.

Sometimes, Nox was really like a child. He held the microphone and started singing a song, but before he could finish the song, he fell onto the sofa and stopped moving.

The bottle of wine was opened, but Nox did not even take a sip.

Zoe had never seen Nox so drunk before. However, seeing that Nox had calmed down, she supported him up and planned to send him back.

Just then, her phone rang.

Zoe glanced at it and hesitated for a moment before answering the call. She lowered her voice and said, “I told you not to look for me.”

“I think I saw you in the nightclub.”

“What’s up?”

“Come over. There are a lot of young boys here tonight.”

“Are you crazy? I’m with Nox now.”

“Can’t you go to the bathroom? I’m in room 8806.” After that, the other party hung up the phone.

Zoe cursed and turned to look at Nox, who was lying motionless on the sofa.

He probably would not wake up while she was away for a while, right?
