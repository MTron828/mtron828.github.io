Chapter 673: Conspiracy Theory: She Can Only Belong To Him!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What you mean is, you want me to chase after Quinn? Don’t forget. I’m currently married. Do you think Quinn will care about me? Besides, Quinn seems engaged, and her fiancé is also a diplomat. You must be joking with me!”

“I never joke,” Michael said sternly.

Eden raised his eyebrows. “In that case, tell me. What can I do?”

“Can you get a divorce if you’re married?” Michael asked.

Eden was stunned, but then he said, “I can, but that’ll make me a divorcee.”

“That’s not important. What’s important is, can you get a divorce?”

“Yes, I’ve been wanting to kick that b*tch Jasmine out for a long time. If it weren’t because she was still useful and I had to keep my dignity so as not to ruin my reputation, I would’ve gotten a divorce long ago.”

“I will tell you how to get a divorce that will be in your best interest.”

“However, that doesn’t mean I can get Quinn just because I’m divorced.”

“There is always a way.” Michael’s eyes darkened. “It’s true. It’s hard to get Quinn through the proper means, but it’s harder to guard against secret plots. There are many hidden methods we can plot against Quinn.”

“How do we do that?” Michael had piqued Eden’s interest.

Not to mention anything else, but once he had a relationship with the Sanders, his Fourth Uncle would definitely have to be a little more polite to him.

He was already fed up with being bullied by his Fourth Uncle, or more accurately, by Jeanne.

“Don’t worry. I’m just telling you to aim for one goal. However, what you should do now is gain a firm foothold in Lawrence Enterprise.”

“Okay.” Eden agreed, but at that moment, he was still a little taken aback by Michael’s proposal. “Michael, we’ve been friends for many years. I know you and I treat each other as real friends, but there are some things I want to ask you openly.”

“Go on.”

“Logically speaking, it would be better for you to marry the Sanders’ princess. However, why are you helping me? It’s not that I don’t trust you. I just feel sorry for you.” Eden put it tactfully.

In fact, both of them knew that their relationship was based more on interests.

“I like Monica,” Michael answered.

Eden frowned.

“Back then, I almost fell out with my family because of Monica. Now that I’ve finally got her, I can’t let her go. That is why I can’t marry the Sanders’ princess.” Michael explained the reason.

“What’s so good about Monica? That unsophisticated girl doesn’t deserve you at all. You don’t even want your future because of her!” Eden could not understand Michael at all.

“I do want my future! You’re my best friend and the person I trust the most in this world, so your marriage with the Sanders is no different from my marriage with the Sanders. But if you marry into the Sanders family, I can be with the person I love the most. This is killing two birds with one stone,” Michael explained. Then, he said, “Although my thoughts are a little selfish, this is the best way I can think for us.”

“You’re not selfish.” Eden said, “I’m looking forward to someone helping me, and I’m glad I’m your best friend. I’ll leave you with this. Once I grow bigger, I definitely won’t treat you poorly.”

“I’m glad to hear that!” Michael chuckled. “Next, I’ll teach you how to get Quinn, but you can’t be too hasty.”

“I’ll listen to your arrangements.”

“Okay.”

The two of them chatted for a while before hanging up.

Michael held his phone and smiled coldly.

His father once told him that the best way to develop his career was to use everyone around him!

Hence, he could not let any of them go, no matter who it was!

…

With the passing of Jonathan and Alexander of the Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne became the CEO-slash-executive-general-manager of Lawrence Enterprise, with full authority to manage the company. On top of that, the news of Eden joining Lawrence Enterprise to assist the development of the Lawrence Enterprise was a hot topic in Harken.

This time, Eden had set himself up as a good person again. He could be considered to have gained the most from that piece of news.

After all, he had entered Lawrence Enterprise as the deputy general manager, which in everyone’s eyes, was a waste of his talent. However, Eden joined, saying that, as part of the Lawrences, he was purely helping the Lawrence Enterprise through their difficult times.

Jeanne drank her coffee and read the news with some amusement.

Meanwhile, Amy was reporting on her work in front of her.

After becoming the CEO of Lawrence Enterprise, she had more things to do.

Jeanne put down her coffee. “Alright, call Mason in for me.”

“Yes.” Amy put down her schedule.

There were endless things to do every day.
