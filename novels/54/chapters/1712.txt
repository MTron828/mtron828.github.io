Chapter 1713: The Miscarriage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Two of his men hurried after him.

As soon as Zoe’s parents saw Nox leaving, they were so angry that they started cursing again until Zoe’s surgery was over, and she was pushed out. When she was pushed out, Zoe’s complexion was terrifyingly pale.

Zoe’s parents hurriedly went up to ask, “Zoe, how are you feeling? Do you feel any pain?

“Boohoo…” Tears streamed down Zoe’s face.

She really had not thought about losing her uterus because of that. So many people had undergone abortions, but why did she have to be the one to end up with such a small chance of having such an outcome? She never thought that she would end up like that by scheming against Nox.

“Be good. Don’t cry. You need a lot of rest right now. Just like during postpartum, you need to take good care of yourself, ” Zoe’s mother comforted her. “You don’t need to worry so much. We’ll stay with you.”

Zoe gritted her teeth and nodded. Then, the doctors and nurses pushed Zoe into the ward, but there was no one there.

Zoe asked, “Where’s Nox?”

“He left!” Zoe’s parents gnashed their teeth in anger. “That beast, I really wish I can beat him to death!”

“He left? Does he know I don’t have a uterus anymore?” Zoe asked.

“So what if he knows? Do you think he has a shred of conscience?”

Tears streamed down Zoe’s face even more. “Is Nox that cruel? I can’t believe he can’t even bear to see me!”

“He promised to give us another one million dollars, but we don’t know if he’s lying!” Zoe’s father said, “Zoe, forget about Nox. He has no conscience!’

“Where’s my phone?” Zoe asked in anger.

“Zoe!”

“Where’s my phone? I want to call Nox. I want to call him!”

“What’s the use in calling him?”

“Give me my phone!” Zoe yelled.

Seeing that she had lost control of her emotions, Zoe’s parents quickly found her phone. Zoe took the phone and frantically dialed Nox’s number. She could not accept the way Nox treated her! She would accept even a little pity from him, but she could not accept that Nox was so heartless to her.

She frantically dialed his number. However, Nox did not answer, and he eventually turned off his phone. Zoe was so angry that she wanted to smash her phone on the ground.

“Zoe, forget it. Nox won’t be kind to you. Don’t be angry because of him…” Zoe’s parents advised her.

However, Zoe refused to listen. She gritted her teeth and dialed another number.

Shelly was surprised to receive an unfamiliar call but still answered, “Hello.” “I am Zoe. Where is Nox?” Zoe asked straight away.

Shelly pursed her lips, “He’s not back yet. You can call his cell phone.” “If I could reach him, would I need to call you?” Zoe mocked.

“There’s nothing I can do for you even if you push me. Nox is not here…” As Shelly said that, she saw Nox open the door and walk into the living room. She said, “He just got back.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Give him the phone!” Zoe screamed.

Her voice was so loud that Shelly felt like that woman might have gone crazy.

She hesitated for a moment but still handed her phone to Nox. “Zoe is looking for you.”

Nox just stared at Shelly.

“I don’t know what happened, but it sounds urgent,” Shelly said as she handed over the phone.

Then, she picked Bella, who was playing on the ground, up and went to Bella’s room. It seemed like she was giving him space to talk to Zoe.

Nox watched as Shelly left before holding to phone to his ear. “What do you want?”

“What do I want? Nox, I no longer have a uterus. What do you think I want?” “Didn’t I promise to give you an extra one million dollars?”

“Can money buy everything? I lost a uterus! Nox, you b*stard! How are you so cold-blooded? I got pregnant for you and had an abortion for you, and now, I don’t even have a uterus. Can you solve it with just one million dollars?” “Are you done cursing?” Nox asked coldly.

“No! Not yet! Someone like you should get hit by a car every time you go out! Why don’t you just go die!” Zoe was utterly devastated.

She was cursing at the top of her lungs, so much so that her voice was hoarse. Meanwhile, Nox held the phone and listened to Zoe cursing with a cold expression.

She cursed until she broke down and said, “Nox, do you really have no sympathy for me? Shouldn’t you treat me a little better because I’ve suffered so much for you? You didn’t even thank me! How could you treat me like this?”
