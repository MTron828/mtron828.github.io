Chapter 1464: Nox and Shelly’s Past

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

As Nox quietly listened to Finn’s suggestion, he heard Finn say, “This is the least harmful method I can think of for both of you.”

Nox stayed silent. In fact, he agreed with Finn’s point of view, but doing it was much tougher than agreeing to it.

Ever since he had calmed down and made up his mind not to be a playboy anymore, he had been strict with himself. He had never had any improper relationships with other women except Zoe, but Shelly had broken his vow!

The more Nox thought about it, the angrier he got.

“You can think about it. I’m hanging up.” Finn was not someone who liked to talk nonsense.

“Finn, if you could analyze your relationship like how you analyze others’ relationships, you would not have ended up like that-”

Finn immediately hung up.

Nox rolled his eyes in response. Seeing how bad of a personality Finn had, he found it no surprise that Monica was still rejecting Finn.

When Nox put down his phone, Zoe came out of the bathroom after a shower.

Zoe, as usual, was intimate with him.

“Nox, did you drink the tea?” Zoe smiled.

Nox did not even dare to look Zoe in the eye as he felt very guilty.

His eyes flickered. “I’m going to get changed and go to work. Since you were drunk last night, you should stay at home and get some rest.”

“Are you going to work today?” Zoe was a little disappointed.

She was obviously reluctant to part with him, and Nox felt even more guilty when he saw Zoe’s expression.

He had thought it through. After he dealt with Shelly, he would confess everything to Zoe. If she really could not accept it, he would respect her choice. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

With that thought in mind, Nox seemed to calm down a little. “I have something to deal with at the company today, so I’ll be leaving first.”

“Alright.” Zoe nodded obediently.

In front of him, she had always presented herself as an obedient girl. However, when she saw Nox going to the closet to get changed, she smiled evilly. Nox should be feeling extremely sorry for her now.

Actually, she did feel a little uncomfortable last night.

Last night, Cody had placed a miniature camera in the private room. Under the dim lighting of the nightclub, ordinary people would not be able to discover it. Then, they left on purpose after Nox’s drug took effect, leaving only the waitress and Nox in the room.

Under the effects of the drugs, Nox would definitely go crazy. The effect of the drug was so strong anyone would turn horny at anything they saw. As expected, Nox could not control himself.

Zoe, on the other hand, was watching from the outside the entire time. At first, it was fine as she forced herself not to care and told herself that it was to protect herself. However, as she watched, she started to feel upset.

She Imew that Nox was very skilled in bed, but what she was unhappy about was the way Nox looked at the waitress. There was a feeling of urgency and lack of control — it was as if he had been holding it in for a very, very long time.

She could not wait for it to end. Although she knew he had been drugged, it made her feel like Nox could have a good or even a better time with other women.

Nox and the waiter did it many times until she could not stand it anymore. No matter how strong the medicinal properties were, was it so strong that they have to do it five times?

How much did Nox want to sleep with another woman?

She was really worried that Nox’s nature would be reignited and he would start to get entangled with countless women again.

Fortunately, when she saw Nox that morning, he seemed to have returned to his original state. Moreover, his guilt toward her was obvious.

What she saw last night was probably an illusion. He was just controlled by the drug and was acting instinctively. There was nothing else.

By the time Nox changed and came out, Zoe had brought the tea to Nox, who looked at her.

“Nox, drink some. You’ll feel better.” Zoe had always been sensible.

The more gentle and considerate she was, the more Nox felt sorry for her.

He drank the tea, and just as he was about to pass the cup to Zoe, she suddenly stood on tiptoe, hugged his neck, and kissed him.

Nox was stunned. It was normal for him to be intimate with Zoe. However, at that moment, he suddenly did not know how to react to her kiss and stood there stiffly..
