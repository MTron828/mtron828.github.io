Chapter 1628: Shelly and Nox Come To An Agreement

When their fingers interlocked, the emotions that Nox was suppressing were on the brink of exploding.

“That’s right, we’re together. I’m very grateful to you for letting Benjamin pursue me back then. It made me experience what it’s like to be truly loved and realize that I really don’t like you at all. That was why I walked away from you so freely.” Shelly said to Nox, “I hope you won’t disturb us again. Thank you.” This time, she did not hesitate to reach out and close the door.

The moment she closed the door, Nox suddenly grabbed the door with his hand. However, Shelly pushed the door harder as she did not want to see Nox for even a second longer.

Seeing Nox’s fingers caught between the door, Shelly pursed her lips and looked up at Nox. There was no trace of heartache on her face, just disgust.

Nox sneered. “Shelly, what are you thinking about? Do you think I’m regretting it? Do you think I’m pestering you because I want to be with you again?”

Shelly ignored him. After all, she did not want to waste her breath on him after all that she said.

“You really think too highly of yourself. Since I told you to get lost back then, I never thought of asking you to come back,” Nox said sarcastically.

Shelly listened calmly. She was completely unmoved.

“I came to look for you today because there’s something I need you to do,” Nox said bluntly, looking indifferent. “Zoe is threatening me with the video of you and me sleeping together at the nightclub. She wants me to let her go.”

The mention of the video of them sleeping together made Shelly’s expression change for a second, and Benjamin reacted the same.

Nox looked at the change in their expression and said sarcastically, “Shelly, you didn’t tell Benjamin that we slept together, did you?”

Shelly really felt that Nox was disgusting and had no moral conscience.

Nox looked at Benjamin again. “Don’t tell me you thought Shelly was innocent when she was with me?”

“If you have something to say, just say it.” Shelly did not want to hear Nox’s nonsense.

Without beating around the bush, Nox continued, “I will never let Zoe go. I will make sure that the woman who cheated on me will die a horrible death! Therefore, I won’t be threatened by Zoe. Since I’m not threatened, she will expose the video and accuse me of cheating on her while I was dating her.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Shelly pursed her lips, annoyed at the issue at hand. She had never thought that the entire country would know about her and Nox sleeping together.

Nox observed the change in Shelly’s mood and said coldly, “The only way I can think of to prevent my reputation from being affected by Zoe is for you to admit that you drugged me after the video is exposed.”

Shelly looked at Nox. For a second, she thought that Nox was just here to inform her so that she would be mentally prepared… As expected, Nox’s shamelessness had no limits.

In fact, she was reacting to it pretty calmly. After all, after experiencing so much, she could accept whatever reality threw at her.

She said, “What makes you think I’ll help you?”

“No reason other than I gave you money when we slept together. Since I’ve given you the money, you have to solve all my problems,” Nox said matter-of-factly.

Therefore, for the sake of that 50 thousand dollars, she had to throw away her dignity.

However, she was not angry. After all, there was really nothing to be angry about since she did not have any expectations for Nox.

She told Nox calmly, “I wasn’t the one who drugged you the last time we slept together, and I had never thought of seducing you. However, it’s very likely that it was Zoe. From Zoe’s perspective, she had to protect herself, so she made you cheat on her when you were dating her. This way, even if she was exposed, she could give herself a way out, just like what she’s doing now. I think the best way for you to salvage your image now is to find evidence against Zoe instead of making me take the blame for you.”

Shelly was seriously analyzing the matter and giving him advice.

“What I want to do is for me to decide. You don’t have a say in it.” Nox refused to listen to her suggestion.

Anyway, he would not listen to anything she said.

“Whether or not I want to put myself out there and tell the world that I seduced you is also for me to decide. It’s not your place to tell me to do it.” Shelly rejected him directly.

There was no need for her to sacrifice herself so much for Nox..
