Chapter 817: Edward and Jeanne’s Standpoints

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At that moment, the sky in South Hampshire was already dark, and it seemed even more difficult to find traces of car tires on the floor.

Finn tried to divert his attention to stop himself from thinking about it.

He did not want to think about the message he just read. “I heard Monica committed suicide and has just been rescued in the hospital.”

Whether she was dead or not had nothing to do with him.

…

The night was peaceful.

In the forest, under the cover of the grass and trees, there was a medium-sized building!

That was the small base that the Hills had set up in South Hampshire.

In fact, the Hills had been making plans since the rise of M Underground Organization. Therefore, they had set up a base here and sent people to infiltrate M Underground Organization’s base to obtain all their information. Their goal was to get rid of any future trouble. However, because Jeanne was kidnapped, it was brought forward.

At that moment, in the dark basement of the building, it was humid.

As the house was built with wood, it was very humid, so the basement was even more humid. At night, there were some water stains on the floor.

To be precise, it was water stains mixed with some blood.

In the basement, the sound of whipping rang out. However, due to the excellent soundproofing, the sound only echoed in the basement and could not be transmitted outside.

The whipping sound continued for a long time before it stopped.

After it stopped, the whip was covered in blood that dripped onto the floor and flowed to Jeanne’s feet.

She was in the basement at the moment, watching as Edward was being whipped over and over again.

He was beaten until his flesh split open.

After his body had finally stabilized, he was supposed to rest for a few days. However, he was whipped awake, and now, he was extremely weak.

His wrists were tied up with iron chains, and he sat on the ground, without any strength in his body. Blood soaked his entire body.

“Who is the Duncans’ descendant?”

In the quiet basement, a cold voice asked him.

It was Kingsley interrogating him.

After coming up empty-handed, they could only find out the whereabouts of that person from Edward.

However, Edward did not say a word since the beginning. He did not even complain as he endured Kingsley’s endless torture.

Meanwhile, Jeanne stood not far away and watched coldly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Fourth Master.” Kingsley squatted down and approached him.

Edward’s entire body reeked of blood.

He pinched Edward’s chin, forcing the latter to look up at him

With that, Edward looked at Kingsley. Although his body was weak, the sharpness in his eyes was still there.

He looked straight at Kingsley and was not afraid at all.

“You don’t have to suffer so much.” Kingsley’s tone was cold. “Just tell me who he is and where he is, and I’ll let you go.”

Edward smiled.

With his face covered in blood, his smile looked terrifying.

Due to his current physical condition, his voice was very low and deep. The two days after his physical outburst was when his body was at its weakest. He said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“You do know.” Kingsley was very certain.

All Edward did was shake his head.

“I can kill you.” Kingsley enunciated each word clearly.

“Yes,” Edward replied.

He really did not have the strength to resist now.

In fact, he had made all the preparations before he went with Kingsley. It even crossed his mind Kingsley would use this opportunity to get rid of him.

After all, the Hills and the Sanders were in cahoots, and the latter could not wait to get rid of him.

He had taken the pill that night and pushed Jeanne away because, for one, he was afraid that he would lose control and kill her. However, on the other hand, he also wanted to escape.

If he did not escape, with so many of Kingsley’s men surrounding him, he might die.

As expected, he did not manage to leave.

At that moment, he suddenly turned his head and glanced at Jeanne. He saw that she had already changed into clean clothes, and the wounds on his body had been bandaged.

He watched as she stood there indifferently.

Having seen the look in Edward’s eyes, Jeanne pursed her lips tightly and did not show any expression.

When their eyes met, Edward looked away, for he had no intention of asking her for help.

It was probably because he was too aware of their purpose to say such meaningless words.

Kingsley naturally noticed their gazes.

With that, he let go of Edward, and as he stood up, the assassin beside him handed him a white handkerchief.

Kingsley wiped Edward’s blood off his hand and threw the handkerchief on the ground. He said, “I’ll give you one more day to consider.”

After saying that, he got up and left the basement.

Everyone in the basement left with Kingsley, including Jeanne, who was the last to leave.

Jeanne turned to look at Edward and watched as he leaned against the wall, motionless.

In the end, she left with Kingsley and returned to her warm room.

The temperature difference between morning and night in South Hampshire was huge. At that time of the night, it was probably around 0 degrees.

She was wearing a lot of layers, but even in the basement, she still felt cold, not to mention Edward, who was only wearing a thin layer of clothes and was covered in blood.

Kingsley and Jeanne sat on the sofa.

He casually lit a cigarette and turned to look at Jeanne, who looked back at him.

Kingsley said bluntly, “The Sanders have made it very clear that they either want Fourth Master Swan’s life or find out the whereabouts of the Duncans’ descendant.”

“He won’t tell you.” Jeanne was very certain that Edward would not say it even if he was beaten to death.

“In that case, he will die.” Kingsley enunciated each word.

Jeanne pursed her lips. “I’ll give it a try.”

As she spoke, she got up and was prepared to leave when Kingsley called out to her, “Jeanne.”

Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

“You need to know where you stand.”

“I know,”

After that, she left and returned to the basement, where two assassins were standing guard at the entrance.

They looked at Jeanne and greeted her respectfully, “Eldest Young Lady.”

Jeanne nodded and instructed, “Bring me a first aid kit.”

“Yes.” One of the assassins left.

“Give me a cigarette,” Jeanne said to the other assassin.

The assassin quickly took out a cigarette and handed it to her respectfully. Then, he took out a lighter and lit it for her.

Jeanne took two deep puffs.

At that moment, the assassin who left quickly returned with a first aid kit.

Jeanne took a look at it.

Following that, she put out the cigarette after taking a few puffs and took the first aid kit. “Give me the cigarette and lighter.”

The assassin handed it over to her respectfully.

“Open the door,” she ordered.

The assassin opened the door for her.

As soon as the door opened, a gust of cold air hit her in the face.

Jeanne looked at Edward, who was lying on the ground as if he was dead.
