Chapter 1662: Utterly Despicable

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Shelly’s words made Benjamin’s parents silent for a few seconds. They were probably thinking about that possibility. To them, the most important thing now was to seize the opportunity and get Benjamin to study abroad first. As for the rest, they could talk about it later.

Anyway, they could not allow Benjamin and Shelly to be together. Benjamin had a bright future ahead of him, and Shelly, a single mother with a child, was not the best candidate for their daughter-in-law.

Mrs. Bacon and Mr. Bacon looked at each other and shared the same thought. Mrs. Bacon said, “Do you think you can persuade Benjamin to study abroad?” “I can.” Shelly was very sure about that.

He would only be away for a year, and she could wait for him for a year. In fact, she could wait many years, let alone one year.

“Alright, I’ll trust you for now.” Mrs. Bacon finally relented.

“Where’s Benjamin? I want to see him.” Shelly said bluntly.

“I’ll get him to see you tomorrow, but Shelly, don’t play any tricks,” Mrs. Bacon threatened.

“Like you, I also value Benjamin’s future.”

Mrs. Bacon was convinced by Shelly. She was also certain that a woman like Shelly must be someone who was greedy for money. If Benjamin could have a better future, Shelly would definitely want to benefit from it. However, Mrs. Bacon did not say anything else and left Shelly’s house with Mr. Bacon.

Although the deal was successful, Shelly had to admit that the arrival of Benjamin’s parents had changed her heart. At the very least, it made her understand that dating and even getting married involved more than just the couple.

The next day, Shelly saw Benjamin. She thought she would be able to see him after his exams, but unexpectedly, four days had passed.

The moment the two of them met, for some reason, there was an indescribable sense of distance between them. Actually, it was Shelly who felt distant, which meant that the arrival ot Benjamin’s parents must nave had an impact on her.

The two of them sat on the sofa in silence for a long time before Benjamin said,

“Shelly, don’t worry. I won’t leave you. No one can stop us. We’ll be together.”

Shelly looked at how determined Benjamin was as if he was swearing an oath to her and felt touched. As she really liked him, Benjamin’s kindness to her made it difficult for her to part with him.

She said, “Go study abroad.”

Benjamin was stunned, but once he recovered, he instantly understood something.

He said, “What did my parents say to you yesterday?”

“They said I shouldn’t stand in the way of your future.” Shelly did not want to hide it from him either.

“Is my future just to study abroad?” Benjamin smiled sarcastically. “All roads lead to Rome! I don’t think going abroad is my only way out.”

“But in a situation where your future is unknown, this is the best path you need to take right now.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Shelly.” Benjamin took her hand and held it tightly in his palm. “Going abroad is the best, but that’s only in terms of personal development. What I really want is to stay by your side. I want to be with you. I want us to live our lives together.”

Shelly quietly listened to everything Benjamin said and could clearly feel him getting emotional. He was afraid that she would reject him.

Shelly pursed her lips and said bluntly, “It’s just a year. Benjamin, do you think our relationship can’t withstand a year of long-distance?

Benjamin was stunned.

“Why can’t we have both?” Shelly asked him, “If you study abroad for a year, it’ll help you to develop your career better in the future. I’ll wait for you in South Hampton City for a year, and when you come back in a year, I don’t think it will change anything for us. Benjamin, I know you like me very much, but sometimes you really can’t let your feelings get to your head.”

Benjamin was silent. No matter what, Shelly’s overly rational thoughts still bothered him a little.

Shelly said, “Don’t throw away any chance of success. At least, you don’t want to have any regrets in your life.”

“I thought that you would be like me, unwilling to let me go,” Benjamin said faintly, clearly disappointed.

He thought Shelly would be like him and could not bear for him to leave..
