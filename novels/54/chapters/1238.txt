1239 Susan’s Arrival

Instead, she asked, “Are you free? Let’s have a chat.”

She saw that Edward had gone upstairs, so she thought they would have some extra time together.

“No. Edward has gone up to get changed, and after that, we’ll be heading to Old Master Swan’s place. I won’t be able to speak much with you.” Susan rejected her immediately. “But don’t worry. Edward told me last night that we’ll be here after lunch at Old Master Swan’s place.”

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded.

In that case, she would not disturb them.

“Jeanne,” Susan suddenly called out to her.

“What?”

“Do you like Edward?” Susan suddenly asked.

“Do you think there’s any point in asking this now?” Jeanne smiled faintly.

Was it important whether she liked him or not?

In fact, it did not even matter whether Edward liked her or not. After all, they only had a little more than two months with each other. She refused to believe that such a smart woman like Susan could not wait for two months.

Alex could not wait because of the situation, and he had to force Edward to do many things. However, Susan did not need to do that. She could cultivate her relationship with Edward after her death. There was no need for her to do anything at that time to cause estrangement or conflict between her and Edward.

“No, I just find it unbelievable that you can be so calm in front of me. I think if a person really loves a man, no matter how much they hide it, they won’t be able to pretend. However, your behavior makes me think that you’ve never loved Edward,” Susan said bluntly.

Jeanne did not answer.

Susan could think whatever she wanted. In fact, even if she had deliberately said it to tell Edward that, Jeanne could agree.

After all, what Susan needed to do now was to build her relationship with Edward. The best way to develop a relationship with a man who had another woman in his heart was to make the man feel that the other woman was not worth it.

“Susan,” Edward’s voice sounded from behind Susan.

Moreover, it sounded not far from her. Therefore, he had heard their conversation clearly.

Susan’s lips curled into a faint smile.

Then, she turned around. As if no one had noticed what she did, she walked toward Edward enthusiastically and wrapped her arms around Edward’s arm naturally. She had a bright smile on her face. “Men really do change and wash up very quickly, unlike us women who need at least an hour before we can head out.”

At that moment, Edward seemed to turn back to look at Jeanne. However, Jeanne had already lowered her head and was eating her breakfast with no emotion on her face.

“Today, I got up two hours earlier to see your father. Look, it’s only 7 a.m. now, but I’ve been up since 5 a.m…” She was clearly acting coquettishly, like a woman wheedling to a man.

Jeanne suddenly felt that she had never acted coquettishly to Edward before.

Although they had been through a lot together, they had spent very little time together.

She had never been in a relationship before and got married immediately. Then, after she got married, she had been scheming and using him, so she had never really opened up her heart to Edward.

There was once when she wanted to confess to him, when Edward saved her from Alex and she had reconciled with Edward. Before she knew that her time on earth was limited, she had thought of expressing her feelings, but Edward rejected her.

After that, she would never say it again in her life.

Now, she suddenly felt a little emotional. She remembered a saying, “Women who flirt live the best lives.”

She wanted to tell the daughter in her stomach not to be like her. She was too cold when it came to her emotions and too rational when it came to her character. She hoped that her daughter could be innocent, lively, and carefree. It would be good if she could even be as heartless as the old Monica.

At the thought of Monica, Jeanne was overwhelmed with emotions. To think that silly girl had now become the person she despised the most.

Jeanne suddenly put down her utensils. When she put them down, her body sprawled on the table. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Madam.” Teddy looked at her, and his face turned pale. “What’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

Jeanne felt a sharp pain in her stomach.

It was so painful that the baby in her stomach kept kicking her stomach. The harder the baby kicked, the more uncomfortable her stomach was.

“Madam!” Teddy was really frightened. “I’ll call Fourth Master to come back. I’ll call Fourth Master right away!”
