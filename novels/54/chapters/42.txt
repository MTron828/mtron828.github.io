Chapter 43: Jeanne Was Drugged

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica looked at her phone and felt like she was about to explode.

‘F*ck.

‘Is Jeanne really into Finn?!

‘She’s giving up Fourth Master Swan for that scum?!

‘Who’s the blind one now?!’

Monica felt like she was about to break down.

She took a deep breath and looked at the time.

’11:00 pm, right?

‘F*ck!

‘Why has Jeanne been so weird ever since she returned?!’

…

After Jeanne put down the phone, she thought for a moment and took out a mini camera from the cabinet. She felt that it would come in handy tonight.

She adjusted the position of the mini camera and switched it to night mode. After confirming that she could capture the big bed, she lay on the bed and waited.

After waiting for about... more than an hour.

Someone knocked on the door.

Jeanne knew that tonight was not going to be simple.

She opened the door.

Sam stood at the door.

Jeanne asked, “Brother Black Bull, you’re still awake?”

“I’m not used to sleeping here, so I can’t sleep. I don’t know what to do, so I was thinking of chatting with you. Is that okay?”

The corner of Jeanne’s lips curled up. “Come in.”

Sam was almost mesmerized by the curve of Jeanne’s lips.

He did not know if it was because of the night, but Jeanne was as charming as an alluring demon, the kind that could suck a man’s blood dry!

Even though she was dressed very homely.

Sam’s heart raced as he walked into Jeanne’s room.

“Is George not here?” Sam asked on purpose.

“He’s sleeping with Paul. I’m alone,” Jeanne answered with a smile.

“Is that so? I thought I might disturb George’s sleep.”

Jeanne smiled again.

Her smile was enchanting.

Sam managed to find some topics to talk about, and the two of them continued to chat.

As they chatted, Jeanne felt that something was wrong with her body.

Sam also noticed that something was wrong with Jeanne. He said, “Jeanne, your face is a little red.”

Jeanne touched her face.

“Do you have a fever?” Sam reached out to touch Jeanne’s cheek.

Jeanne moved back.

Sam endured it and asked with concern, “Are you feeling unwell?”

“I’m feeling a little hot.” Jeanne panted lightly.

She looked incredibly seductive.

Sam could not endure it anymore.

He suddenly said excitedly, “Jeanne, I like you very much. I really like you very much...”

Jeanne looked at him.

“I liked you when I was young, but I was afraid that I wasn’t good enough for you, so I didn’t dare to say it. Now that I see you again, I can’t hold it in anymore. Jeanne, I...” As he said that, he pounced on Jeanne.

Jeanne suddenly dodged.

Sam wanted to get closer again.

Jeanne said, “Brother Black Bull, I don’t know why, but I also have some indescribable feelings for you now. That said...”

“Do you feel like you want to do something?” Sam asked her.

“Yes, but...”

“No buts. Don’t worry, I’ll take responsibility for you.” Sam leaned over again.

“Wait,” Jeanne called out to him.

At that moment, she was panting a little.

Sam knew she must be suffering from the effects of the drug.

His aunt said that once the drug took effect, he could do whatever he wanted to Jeanne.

When he thought about what was going to happen next, he became even more excited.

“Brother Black Bull, go and turn off the lights first,” Jeanne said.

Sam could only think about wanting Jeanne at this moment, so he did whatever she said.

He quickly went to turn off the lights.

It was suddenly dark. Sam did not know where Jeanne had gone. He only heard her soft voice. “Brother Black Bull, wait for me on the bed for a while. I’ll go and change my clothes. I’ll be right back.”

“Okay, hurry up.”

“Okay,” Jeanne replied.

Sam hurriedly fumbled and lay down on Jeanne’s soft bed. The whole bed seemed to have Jeanne’s scent, which made Sam even more excited.

Jeanne took this opportunity to open the door and walk out.

She was a little drowsy.

Jenifer had probably used a huge dose of the drug!

Jeanne forced herself to calm down and walked directly to Jasmine’s room next door.

She knocked on the door.

Jasmine seemed to have just taken a shower.

She was probably too excited to sleep tonight, so she quickly opened the door.

When she opened the door and saw Jeanne, she was a little surprised. Did her mother not say that there would be a good show tonight…?

Jasmine did not have time to think. The back of her head suddenly hurt, and her vision went black.

Jeanne dragged Jasmine’s body back to her room.

In the room, Sam was fumbling around. “Jeanne, are you not done yet?”

“I’m done,” Jeanne said breathlessly, “Promise me you’ll close your eyes the entire time. I’m shy...”

“Whatever you say... ” Sam was extremely excited.

“I’m coming now. Have you closed your eyes?”

“Yes.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth and forcefully carried Jasmine onto the bed.

Sam hugged Jasmine’s body and started to kiss and touch her all over.

Jeanne glanced at them and turned to leave.

She closed the door gently and walked straight to the balcony on the second floor of the Lawrence family’s house. She estimated the height and jumped down.

After jumping down, she rolled on the ground and quickly walked toward the entrance

At this moment, in the main hall.

Jenifer was sitting in the main hall. It looked like she was still preparing for tomorrow’s wedding, but in reality, she was just waiting for something to happen.

It was about time.

Jenifer smiled viciously.

Tomorrow... There would be a good show to watch!

…

When Jeanne walked out of the entrance, she saw Monica’s car parked there.

Monica had always been reliable when it came to Jeanne.

Jeanne suddenly opened the door of the front passenger seat.

Monica was still listening to a song when she was shocked by Jeanne’s sudden appearance.

Just as she was about to say something, she heard Jeanne say, “Go to your place. Hurry up!”

“...” What was wrong?!

Monica felt that Jeanne was in a hurry at that moment as if she was different from the usually calm and collected her.

Frightened, Monica quickly started the car to drive toward her house. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Along the way, Monica drove a little fast.

As she drove, she asked, “Jeanne, what’s wrong? Why are you panting so much? Don’t scare me!”

“I’m fine.” Jeanne forced herself to remain calm.

“Don’t say that you’re fine. I get scared when you say that.”

Jeanne gritted her teeth and did not say anything else at that moment.

Her body was tensed up, and she was already pressing her nails into her palms.

Monica saw that Jeanne’s condition was getting more abnormal, so she sped up again.

She even crazily parked her car in the district’s garage and got out to help Jeanne up.

The moment she touched Jeanne’s body, she was completely shocked. “Why are you sweating so much? Why is your body so hot?!”

It seemed like…

Monica did not dare to think further.

She helped Jeanne into the elevator and pressed the button to her floor frantically.

When the elevator arrived, Monica used her fingerprint to unlock the door.

Jeanne said weakly, “Help me into your room and call Dr. Jones for me.”

“...”

Monica thought, ‘How can that scum be so blessed?!’
