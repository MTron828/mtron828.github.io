Chapter 253: Jeanne Resists: Do You Know Who I Am?!

In the Swans’ Universe Garden.

Finn walked forward recklessly.

Wade did not stop him anymore.

Monica, Micheal, and Eden quickly followed Finn’s footsteps.

‘Am I imagining things?!

‘Why do I feel that Finn has changed into a different person tonight?’ Monica wondered.

‘He has become so terrifying.’

In the past, Monica had only felt that Finn had a bad personality and treated her badly. Now, she felt that he was very far away from her!

It was as if...

They were not from the same world!

Monica gritted her teeth.

Now was not the time to think so much.

‘Who is Finn?!

‘Why does he have such skills?

‘Finn…’ In any case, it had nothing to do with her.

The important thing at this moment was she only wanted to see Fourth Master Swan.

She only wanted Fourth Master Swan to save Jeanne.

Everything else was not important!

Monica tried her best to calm herself down.

She followed behind Finn calmly and went to look for Fourth Master Swan.

Finn seemed to know where Fourth Master Swan was, and his motive was very strong.

Soon, Finn stopped in front of a large door.

This door was obviously different from the other rooms.

They had walked through the hall into the corridor, then they went into the forest garden before arriving at this door.

This door was not an ordinary bedroom door. It was a sturdy-looking anti-theft door.

At the door stood two tall and strong men guarding the door.

Without thinking, the others knew that Fourth Master Swan must be in this room.

What mistake did Fourth Master Swan make that Old Master Swan wanted to lock him up in such a place?!

While Monica was still wondering, she saw Finn rush forward and start fighting with the two guards without any hesitation.

The fight was quite intense.

Micheal pulled Monica into his arms as if to prevent her from being hurt.

Eden also stood a little further away as he sized up Finn.

Finn was fighting two against one.

It was obviously not that easy.

Monica even saw that Finn had been hurt many times, but he seemed to just endure it every time. He still fought fiercely with his life on the line. The fight was getting more and more intense.

Monica saw that Finn’s body was gradually bleeding.

She saw that Finn’s cold face was becoming more and more ferocious.

Monica watched the scene in front of her closely.

She even felt that if this continued, Finn might be beaten to death.

Monica suddenly pushed Micheal away.

Micheal was stunned.

Before he could react, Monica had rushed directly to Finn’s side.

She was not there to help Finn.

Monica knew very well that she did not have the ability to help Finn. If she went over, she would only be beaten to death. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She rushed over. While the three of them were locked in a fierce fight and could not spare any time to deal with anything else, she went over to smack on the tightly shut door. She hit it crazily and called out to whoever was inside, “Fourth Master Swan, Fourth Master Swan!”

Among the three people fighting, one of the burly men quickly withdrew from the fight. His pupils constricted, and he directly rushed toward Monica.

“Monica, be careful!” Micheal hurriedly wanted to go over.

At this moment, the burly man was completely savage and directly kicked Monica’s back.

With that kick, Monica might break a few ribs.

All of a sudden, a green figure moved at an astonishing speed.

He hugged Monica in his arms and quickly dodged the burly man’s punches and kicks.

In the end, the burly man reacted fast as well. Finn’s back was still kicked ruthlessly.

Finn’s body trembled, and the malevolence on his face became more obvious.

Monica only felt that she was in someone’s tight embrace for a second before she was pushed out.

She was pushed away with force.

An extremely cold voice was also heard at the same time. “Stay away!”

Monica was pushed to the ground.

It was unexpectedly painful.

Her eyes could not help but redden.

She turned her head and saw Finn fighting madly with the other party.

Monica did not know if Finn was saving her because she could not see what the person behind her was doing to her. She only knew that Finn had pushed her to the ground with all his strength and showed no mercy. She even felt that Finn was very angry at that moment as if she had dragged him down.

She bit her lips tightly.

Micheal had come to her side and picked her up from the ground. “Monica, how are you?”
