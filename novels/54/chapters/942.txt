943 Monica Stirring Up Trouble Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When Monica heard the news, she was devastated.

How could it be so difficult?

Judging from the current situation, they could not do any public relations at all. If the quality inspection department deliberately delayed their results, Cardellini Enterprise would really be done for.

She gritted her teeth and refused to wait around.

She had to think of a way to make the quality inspection department produce the results immediately.

“I think we’re being targeted,” Steve said.

Monica looked at Steve.

“This isn’t the first time a pharmaceutical accident has happened in Harken, but they have never had such a high standard before, and never have they been so careful. I’m basically certain that our company has been targeted by the quality inspection department,” Steve explained.

“Who is targeting us?” Monica asked.

Steve did not answer.

However, a thought crossed Monica’s mind. “It must be Michael!”

Steve did not deny it, and Monica trembled with anger.

She had never thought Michael would do that. In fact, she thought that they were even after the wedding.

However, here he was targeting her.

She had always thought that Michael was a good person, but she really was blind.

“In fact, I can’t be completely sure. It’s just a suspicion,” Steve said.

“Alright, I got it.” Monica said, “I’ll go and talk to Michael alone.”

“Don’t force yourself.” Steve was concerned.

“Alright.” Monica nodded. “Mr. Warren, please leave the room for a moment.”

“I’m just next door. Call me if you need anything.”

Monica watched Steve leave.

It took her a long time to gather her emotions before she called Michael.

If not for the accident, she and Michael would really never interact!

The phone rang a few times before Michael picked up.

He answered without saying anything, and Monica did not speak either.

After half a minute of silence, Monica gritted her teeth. “Michael, did you do it?”

Michael chuckled.

Monica had heard everything.

He said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. As far as I’m concerned, I thought you’d never contact me again.”

Monica gritted her teeth. “Can you not be so hypocritical?”

“Is that so? You humiliated me in public and ruined my reputation. I thought you did that because you were determined to cut off all contact with me. Otherwise, why would you do it without considering the consequences? Shouldn’t I be flattered that you’re calling me?” Michael, on the other end of the phone, mocked her.

“Michael, what will it take for you to let Cardellini Enterprise go?”

“Have you forgotten that I have no power or influence now? What can I do to Cardellini Enterprise?”

“Michael!” Monica’s body was trembling from all the emotions she was suppressing.

“That’s enough, Monica. I have nothing more to say to you now. Let’s leave it at that.”

“What do you want?” Monica was certain that the matter had something to do with Michael.

If not, how could they be targeted?

“What do I want?” Michael sneered, “Monica, from the moment you arranged for me to sleep with Brie, the Michael who could pretend to be a good person in front of you was dead. It was you who forced me to take back all my kindness to you. It was you who deprived me of my right to be a good person, or at least my right to be a good person in front of you!”

Then, without giving Monica any time to speak, Michael hung up.

Monica’s hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

What did he mean by saying she had deprived him of his right to be a good person?

He was so bad, but was he not the one who was bad?

Her eyes were a little red. She was so angry at Michael that she wanted to cry.

At first, she had some doubts, but now, she was sure that it was Michael who did it!

In fact, it was true.

Michael hung up the phone at that moment, and the smile on his lips was terrifyingly sinister.

He had been waiting for Monica’s call for some time.

However, Monica was stupider than he thought, considering it took her so long to suspect him.

He had no choice. With his scandal exposed, he naturally could not continue to keep his high position. However, the Sanders needed talents. Since they had painstakingly nurtured him, they could not bear to see him destroyed just like that. Therefore, on the surface, they dismissed him from his position when, in reality, he was still secretly helping the Sanders do many things. The Sanders had also given him a lot of power, so the quality inspection department was still within his authority.

Cardellini Enterprise’s accident was not an ordinary pharmaceutical accident. He had deliberately arranged it and framed her.
