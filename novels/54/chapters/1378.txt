1379 Getting Along and George’s Rejection

Monica left in Brandon’s car, and in the car, no one spoke.

Monica gradually regained control of her emotions during the ride. She had accepted the end of her relationship with Finn.

In fact, she had gone over the scene many times so that when the day really came, she would feel okay about it.

She watched as the car stopped at a clubhouse.

She was at home when she received a call from Brandon. He said that the people he had been talking to about some international drug research and development technology were here in South Hampton City and wanted to talk to her today. Naturally, she did not hesitate to go and discuss it.

She did not tell Finn on purpose because she felt that there was no need for her to do so.

She took a deep breath and wiped her tears away. She even put on light makeup on her face so that it did not look like she cried.

She said, “Go buy me a cell phone and get me a SIM card. Then, come in and look for me. ”

“Alright.” Brandon agreed immediately.

Monica tidied up her clothes. After making sure that she was dressed appropriately, she got out of the car and walked into the high-class clubhouse.

Brandon stared at Monica’s back and felt that she had become very powerful. She gave off a feeling that she was invincible.

When they were young, she was still that little girl who loved to wheedle, cry, and rely on others. How much did she have to go through to become like that?

Brandon went to buy a new phone for Monica and replaced her SIM card.

She probably did not want to be involved with Finn anymore, so she would not go back to Finn to get her phone back.

He did not know if Finn and Monica’s breakup would give him a chance to woo Monica. However, since he had that opportunity, he would not allow himself to give it up.

Monica had lunch with the international R&D technical director, and they talked until 4 p.m. before ending the business meeting happily. The result was naturally good as the R&D team would come to Cardellini Pharmaceutical next month and bring the advanced, foreign research and design technology to Harken.

Of course, Edward’s support was also the reason the negotiations went so smoothly.

In fact, Edward was the one who negotiated many of the international medical technology, and she was the one executing them most of the time.

It was indeed to Edward’s credit that Cardellini Enterprise could develop to its current peak. Hence, even though she hated that sc*mbag Edward to the core, she had no choice but to submit to his tyranny. That was what it meant to take advantage of others.

After the negotiation, Brandon drove away.

“Where are we heading back to?” Brandon asked.

Monica looked out of the window and said calmly, “Let’s go back to the company.”

“Boss, are you going to work overtime?”

“Why not?”

Brandon smiled and drove the car to Cardellini Enterprise. After arriving at the Cardellinis, Brandon followed Monica into the company.

“You don’t have to work overtime,” Monica said.

“That won’t do. If my boss works overtime and I don’t, how will my boss see my hard work?” Brandon deliberately said, “The unspoken rule of the workplace is that we work for our boss to see.”

Monica smiled faintly, which meant she tacitly agreed. Moreover, there were some things that she needed Brandon to do.

If she gave him the task today, all the employees could get to it when they came to work tomorrow.

She sat in her office and said to Brandon, “This international research and development team will come to the company next month to conduct research and development. There are some specific matters that needed to be settled. I’ll give you the overall plan now, and you can go and sort out the necessary arrangements.”

“Alright.” Brandon nodded.

When it came to work-related matters, both of them would be very serious.

The two of them talked for almost two hours.

Monica said, “If you have any problems, you can look for me directly. We can’t make any mistakes with the research.”

“I know.”

“It’s getting late, so you can get off work after you’re done.”

“What about you?” Brandon asked.

“I want some time alone.”

Brandon naturally knew why Monica wanted to be alone. She probably wanted to have some time to think about her and Finn. After all, her relationship was over, and she still needed some time to adjust.

“In that case, I’ll go out.” Brandon stood up from his seat and did not ask any more questions.

Most of the time, he would put himself in Monica’s shoes. He did not want to make things difficult for her or scare her too weakly.

The moment he left, Monica suddenly said, “Brandon, don’t send me flowers anymore.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
