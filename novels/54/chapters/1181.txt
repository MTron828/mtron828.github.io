1182 Jeanne Kills Warren With Her Own Hands

In fact, Warren had his guard up against Kingsley.

Kingsley was too brutal and wise, and Warren was afraid that he would not be able to control Kingsley.

Therefore, if Kingsley mistakenly thought that Jeanne was his daughter, he could naturally make better use of that resource to achieve his goal.

Both sides were scheming against each other.

Ever since Warren acknowledged Jeanne as his daughter, Kingsley practically listen to everything Warren said.

When Warren arranged for Jeanne to return to South Hampton City, on the surface, he said that he wanted to avenge Jeanne’s mother. However, in reality, he wanted Jeanne to help him take over Lawrence Enterprise.

Everything that Jeanne had done for Warren was to gain his trust.

In order not to arouse Warren’s suspicion and to make him think that she did not want to get too involved in the Sanders’ affairs, Kingsley even pretended to take Jeanne away from South Hampton City several times. In fact, they already had a plan on how to make Warren let her stay, and that was by using Melody and Edward.

Finally, Warren told Jeanne to marry Edward, for the reason that she had caused Melody’s death. Then, naturally, she had to replace Melody.

As a result, not only did Jeanne stay in South Hampton City as she wished, but she also participated in the Sanders’ affairs. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In other words, Jeanne had a motive for marrying Edward from the start.

From the very beginning, her goal was to kill Warren.

However, she could not form an alliance with Edward. Even though Edward’s goal was the same as hers, they were ultimately two different factions.

She belonged to the Hills, who were at loggerheads with the Duncans. Even if only one of them were enemies, they could never be friends. Hence, she could only make use of Edward.

She would use the Duncans’ descendant that he supported to start this war and then achieve her goal from there.

What she did not expect was how cunning Warren was. He was so cunning that she could only put herself in danger and return to his side to gain his trust.

She did not even expect that Warren had long wanted to kill Kingsley.

She had always thought that Warren would rely on Kingsley’s power, but she did not expect that he had long wanted to take Kingsley’s power for himself.

Now, Kingsley was dead before he could avenge his sister.

Before he died, when he was covering for her to leave, he had told her not to take revenge. If he succeeded, he would have succeeded; if he failed, the matter of revenge would end there!

After all, the strong dominated the weak, and she would have to accept nature’s law of elimination!

In fact, Kingsley knew that she could not do it! There was no way she could bear the blood feud of so many lives and pretend that nothing had happened.

Hence, she returned to Warren’s side, but this time, she really made use of Edward.

It was not just Edward. As long as it was someone who could help her kill Warren, she would make use of them.

Then, she used all her means just to hasten the war between the Sanders and the Duncans.

She did not care whether the Sanders or the Duncans won in the end. All she cared about was killing Warren.

However, she knew very well that she could not kill Warren herself and that she needed help from the Duncans’ power.

As for whether the Duncans were ready or not, and which side Edward was on, she did not care. All she needed was to start the war and wait for the right time!

She had been waiting for that exact moment when she could kill Warren — when she could point the gun at his head with her own hands and avenge her parents, Kingsley, Lucy, and the many people who had died at Warren’s hands!

She looked at Warren coldly.

The fact that Warren could still find himself a chance to live at that point proved why Kingsley did not dare to act rashly.

No wonder Kingsley had repeatedly warned her not to make a move on Warren, and it was because the consequences would be unimaginable.

She believed she had put up with Warren for as much as she could.

There were a few times when she wanted to kill him but held back, and she was glad that she did not act rashly. Otherwise, she would have ended up like Chester, who died at Warren’s hands.

Her fingers trembled. In the face of death, anyone would be afraid!

She had thought of dying together with Warren, but she hoped that she could escape unscathed.

She still had people in this world who were worthy of her love. For example, George, the baby in her belly, and Edward…

She loved Edward but had never dared to express her feelings for him. She thought that after the war ended, she would be able to be brave and tell him how much she loved him.

Tears welled up in her reddened eyes, and she bit her lips as she tried to control her emotions.

“If you let me go, I won’t kill you!” Warren was negotiating terms.

He wanted Jeanne to let him go.

At that moment, they were in a standoff, and no one dared to act rashly.

“You’re responsible for the fetus’s life too. It’ll be a pity if you die.” As Warren tried to persuade Jeanne, he could see that she was slowly crumbling.

She probably did not expect him to have a way to save himself at that point.

Warren sneered to himself.

He had used his blood-stained hands to become the leader of the Sanders. He had killed so many people, but no one had ever hurt him!

Even though Jeanne was so smart, she would not be able to kill him!

“Just because she doesn’t dare to kill you doesn’t mean I can’t help her!” Nox suddenly said loudly.

He had thought that Jeanne could really kill Warren.

Of course, the moment he saw it, he even wondered whether Jeanne and Warren were putting on an act.

However, after listening to their conversation, he finally understood that Jeanne’s motive was to kill Warren.

It was because she knew that Warren was not easy to kill that she returned and placed herself in the position closest to him without expecting that cunning old man to be so cunning!

At that moment, he still had a way out for himself.

However, Nox pointed his gun at Warren.

...

He did not care about Jeanne’s life. The order he had received today was to find Warren, take his head, and hand it over to Edward to complete Edward’s mission!

Just as he pulled the trigger, Warren shouted at Nox, “Stop! If you shoot me, I’ll really die with Jeanne!”

“In that case, you can die together!” Nox did not care!

“She’s the woman whom Edward risked his life to protect. If you kill her, will you be able to answer to Edward? Not only would you kill Jeanne, but you would also kill Edward’s child!” Warren said to Nox fiercely.

At that moment, Nox hesitated. ‘F*ck. That damn old man.’

Nox gritted his teeth and told himself that he had to do it.

However, he could not bear to do it. It did not matter if Jeanne died, but it was not worth it for Edward’s child to be buried with her.

He even thought that if Edward rushed over and saw Jeanne’s corpse at that moment, what would Edward do?

Nox was conflicted.

Naturally, Warren saw that. As he said, once a person had feelings, nothing could be achieved!

If not for Nox’s indecisiveness, he would have died under the chaotic gunfire. Then, he would not still be alive and threatening Nox.

...

Jeanne also saw Nox’s expression.

She knew very well that Nox had a sharp tongue but a soft heart. If he really wanted to kill her, she would have been shot dead when they first surrounded her!

She said, “Nox, don’t be conflicted. I choose to die with him.”

Nox’s eyes narrowed as he looked at Jeanne coldly.

“You and Edward are brothers. There’s no need for you two to be on bad terms because of me. I’m actually very envious of the relationship you, Edward, and Finn have. It’s rare to come across a relationship like that, and there’s no need to create conflict between you guys because of me. So, you don’t have to do anything. I’ll do it myself.”

Nox clenched her fists tightly and kept staring at Jeanne.

Jeanne was not trying to gain Nox’s sympathy, nor was she trying to make Nox let her go by saying all that.

She really believed that since she was going to die, there was no need for Nox to be blamed. Moreover, even if Nox did not make a move, she had never thought of letting Warren go.

She had already come so far, and it had not been easy for her to get here. There was no way she would give up.

She said to Warren, “In that case, let’s die together!”

“Jeanne! Don’t forget the fetus’s life too! It’s not worth it for you to die!” Warren reminded her in a panic. At that moment, he also told her anxiously, “Besides, Nox won’t do anything. He will never do anything to you! You still have a choice!”

“I know Nox won’t do it,” Jeanne said bluntly and coldly. “I, too, know that I have a fetus in me. Compared to that, death is indeed not worth it! But on second thought, you’ve taken the lives of my father, my mother, Kingsley, Lucy... and so many more that I suddenly think it’s worth it!”

“Jeanne, calm down. Calm down.” Warren clearly felt Jeanne’s murderous intent.

He could feel that Jeanne had already made up her mind to take him down with her.

“Besides.” Jeanne’s fingers were trembling as she slowly pulled the trigger. “Do you think my baby is still alive after such a night?”

The baby should not be there anymore.

She was so busy tonight that she did not even try to protect the baby. She had even felt pain in her abdomen and the blood between her legs.

Therefore, the baby would not be alive anymore.

In that case, she would die with the baby as atonement for the sins of killing the baby before she could be born!

Her fingers tightened, and without any hesitation, she pulled the trigger.

She looked at Warren, who had never been so flustered and in so much pain before.

Then, the moment Jeanne was fully prepared to die with Warren, a figure pounced on her, pushed her to the ground, and used his body to protect her.
