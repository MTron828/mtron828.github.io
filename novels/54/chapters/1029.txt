1030 Becoming Vengeful

At Cardellini Enterprise’s shareholders’ meeting, Monica sat in the middle.

It was unsure if it was because of Monica’s rebuttal last time, but although the shareholders present were filled with anger, no one dared to take the initiative to speak.

In the eyes of those shareholders, Monica was a typical fearless and ignorant person. No matter who they were, she would be able to go against them. They did not want to lose face and status because of a little girl.

The conference room was a little quiet.

Seemingly having adjusted her emotions, Monica said, “Cardellini Enterprise is now facing a huge crisis. I just held a full-staff meeting and told the employees to leave as they please.”

The shareholders had some objections.

Was Monica trying to get rid of Cardellini Enterprise at a time like this?!

“Employees have the right to choose, but we don’t.” Monica looked serious.

The Monica today felt a little different from the last time they saw her.

All the shareholders just stared at her.

“If we choose to give up, Cardellini Enterprise will be done for, and everything that we have will also be gone! Therefore, we can only give it our all and go for it!” Monica said powerfully.

She did not look like someone who could not fight back after she was knocked down.

She said to all the shareholders, “I believe you’ve heard about my father’s condition. According to the medical answer, my father basically won’t wake up…”

The crowd began to discuss. They were still sad about what happened to Gary. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In fact, Monica was also a little emotional, but she had to bear with it.

She continued to say in a calm voice, “Therefore, it’s impossible for my father to show up in the company again. From now on, I’ll be taking his place. I admit that I don’t have my father’s capability and know nothing about the business world, but I can assure everyone here that I, Monica, will do my best to save Cardellini Enterprise from this crisis. I won’t give up even until the last moment.”

The shareholders looked at Monica, the little girl who could still argue with them a few days ago. However, after experiencing so much, she seemed to have matured a lot.

Monica stood up from her seat and said, “As the new chairman of Cardellini Enterprise, I would like to thank all the shareholders. I hope you can work with me to save the Cardellini Enterprise from this crisis!”

After that, she took a deep bow.

The room was silent.

Everyone found it hard to believe how much Monica had changed.

Putting aside whether Monica had the ability to save Cardellini Enterprise, they were willing to believe her this once just from the fact that she could still maintain such a calm and composed attitude even after encountering so many things.

One of the shareholders suddenly said, “Cardellini Enterprise belongs to all of us. Don’t worry. If there’s anything I can be of use, I’ll definitely do my best!”

“Me too,” another shareholder echoed, “Your father is lying in bed now. We are deeply saddened. Now that you’re inheriting your father’s business, I’ll definitely give you my greatest support. Otherwise, when your father wakes up, he’ll drink this cup of wine again. Go ahead and do it, I’ll support you unconditionally!”

“I won’t give up until the last moment.”

At the scene, all the shareholders were siding with Monica.

Monica’s eyes were red, but she controlled herself.

If she wanted to become an adult, one who was responsible and capable, she should never shed tears anymore.

Therefore, at that moment, she said, “Thank you.”

After that, the shareholders’ meeting ended.

The purpose of the meeting today was to tell all the shareholders that she would be taking over the Cardellini Enterprise from now on. She hoped to get their approval and support as she did not want to waste her energy by causing any more conflicts among the shareholders.

Obviously, she had achieved her wish, and now, there was no need to waste too much time.

Monica left, and naturally, Steve was by her side.

Monica always surprised him.

He thought that the shareholders would argue with each other again during the meeting, but he did not expect Monica would try to win their hearts.

Monica had really changed.

Overnight, she seemed to have grown up into an adult who could rely on herself to survive in any situation!

After the board meeting ended, Monica immediately called for a meeting with the various heads of departments to discuss the matters regarding the drug promotion. She comprehensively analyzed Sunny Pharmaceutical’s advantages and disadvantages and decided on Cardellini Enterprise’s promotion plan.
