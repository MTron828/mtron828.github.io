Chapter 1586: The Mystery of Bella’s Background

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Bella was deaf, everything else about Bella was normal. At the very least, there were no defects in her growth, so Shelly could raise her up. It was just that every time she went to the hospital for Bella’s consultation, the doctor would suggest that Bella had ear surgery as soon as possible so that she could recover better. However, Shelly did not have any money.

Even if she brought Bella with her to work and did not go to school, she still would not be able to earn that much money to treat Bella. Hence, she had no choice but to look for Mrs. Winter.

As such, she thought that it was better to put her stubbornness aside. It was much better to be living with the Winters than on her own. Living alone outside was hard enough, let alone with Bella. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Mrs. Winter refused, saying that she could come back but not Bella. It was because people would misunderstand that Bella was Nox’s daughter, which would affect the marriage and relationship between Nox and Zoe. In turn, it would also cause the Winters to be slandered by the public.

She also said that it would be difficult for Shelly to marry into a good family with a child in the future. However, the Winters would definitely not let her marry a random man. With the Winters’ current status, if she did not have a good life in the future, it would also make the public think that the Winters did not care about her and affect the Winters’ reputation.

Mrs. Winter suggested that she send Bella to an orphanage and promised that she would find a way for Bella to be adopted into a good family. In fact, Mrs.

Winter was doing everything for the best of everyone, but that fairness made Shelly feel even worse. It was as if she had caused a lot of trouble for the Winters.

She was extremely grateful to be able to live in the Winters since she was young, but she never thought that one day, she would make things difficult for them and even embarrass them.

If Mrs. Winter was determined not to accept her anymore, she might feel better, but what she was afraid of was that Mrs. Winter cared so much about her but could not meet her requirements. That kind of mental torture was unbearable. Therefore, she carried Bella and left.

Then, she changed her phone number and cut contact with the Winters. She would rather be a heartless existence in the eyes of the Winters than endure the pain in her heart. Since the Winters’ love for her was not the kind of love she wanted, it was better to break all ties with them. She would rather them take her as an ingrate.

After she excluded the Winters from her life, she did not think she would have anything to do with the Winters again. If not, she would have met Nox again. She had indeed lived a hard life the past few years, but her days were not as difficult as she thought. She was not internally tormented, and all she had to do was rely on herself to live a life with Bella. She had actually thought it through. If there was really no way to treat Bella’s ears, she could at least make Bella a mentally healthy little girl, especially in a world where were so many people who were crippled, and not everyone was unhappy.

Of course, if she had the chance to heal Bella, she would not give it up. Hence, since Nox was willing to give her money, she accepted it. If Zoe was willing to give her money, she would accept it too.

After a few years of being beaten up by society, she was still very clear about the importance of money. As long as she did not steal or rob, she could use the rest of the money as she pleased.

Shelly looked at Mrs. Winter coldly. Her emotions did not change at all because of her discomfort. Instead, she said, “I don’t understand. All I know is that I wanted to bring Bella along, and you rejected me. Although you gave me so many high-sounding reasons, it seemed to me that you just didn’t care about my feelings.”

“Shelly, I’m doing this for your own good. What are you going to do with your life if you have a child by your side? In today’s society, there are still people who mind if you have a child by your side! I, too, hope you can marry into a good family in the future. I really treat you like a daughter…” Mrs. Winter tried her best to persuade Shelly, but she got a little emotional because Shelly could not understand her perspective.

“Mrs. Winter, don’t say anymore. I won’t appreciate it.” Shelly interrupted her.

She probably did not want to talk to them or about the past anymore. She really wanted nothing to do with the Winters..
