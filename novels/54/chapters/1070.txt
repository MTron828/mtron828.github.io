1071 Going To Court: Intense Debate

“I don’t want to,” Monica answered without any hesitation. In fact, she sounded very determined.

Nox looked at her.

At that moment, he seemed a little surprised by her answer.

“I really don’t want to,” Monica confirmed her answer when she saw Nox’s confusion.

“Why?” Nox asked her, “Don’t you like him anymore?”

“It has nothing to do with whether I like him or not. I just don’t want to be in a relationship anymore.” Monica laughed sarcastically. “I think I’m not worthy of love.”

“Monica–”

“Of course, I’m not completely against dating or getting married. I just think that there are only two people I can’t marry in this life. One is Michael, and the other is Finn.”

“How could you compare Finn with Michael?” Nox was still a little angry.

Finn was so good to Monica, yet she compared him to Michael.

“Putting everything else aside, the feelings they gave me are actually the same.” It was the same, and she did not dare to go near it again.

Nox still wanted to say something, but Monica interrupted him. “Thank you, Nox.”

Nox held his tongue.

He did not think Monica was joking or acting out of spite. In fact, she had really let go of her feelings for Finn.

With that, Nox stood up and left.

While he was driving, he gave Finn a call.

“I saw Monica taking anti-depression medicine,” Nox said.

“Mm,” Finn replied.

“Actually, I kind of want to match you and Monica together,” Nox suddenly muttered.

“You don’t need to,” Finn said with certainty.

“Monica also said that she doesn’t want to,” Nox said bluntly.

The other person on the other end of the phone was silent and did not answer.

“She said there are only two people whom she would never marry in this life. One is you, and the other is Michael.” Nox sighed as he drove. “It seems like Monica has really let you go.

Even then, Finn did not answer.

“Forget it.” Nox also took a deep breath. “You know the relationship best, and I shouldn’t meddle in other people’s business. Although Monica is at the lowest point of her life, I don’t know why, but I feel like she will get through it.”

“Yes.” Finn gave another simple response.

“Let’s not talk about it. We’ll wait for tomorrow’s court session.” With that, Nox hung up the phone.

Finn also put his phone aside.

He rarely smoked at work. In fact, smoking was forbidden in the hospital. However, at that moment, he still went to the smoking area of the hospital and started smoking.

Her mind was filled with Nox’s voice, saying that the only two people Monica would never marry in her life was him and Michael.

Right now, things between him and Monica were better than he had ever imagined.

The moment he was forced to leave Monica, he had never thought about revenge, nor had he ever hated Monica for it. He just wanted to cut off all ties and have nothing to do with her anymore.

Now, it had finally come true.

Finally, Monica had completely given up on him. She no longer pestered him and had any expectations of him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

His throat moved slightly.

Things were good the way they were now.

…

The next day, Monica brought Steve to court.

She had just arrived at the entrance of the court when a group of reporters immediately surrounded her.

“Ms. Cardellini, do you have anything to say about this court session?”

“I heard that the defendant Brie has disappeared. Did she run away?”

“There are no problems with the vaccine, but Cardellini Enterprise still isn’t developing. They say it’s because your leadership doesn’t deserve the trust of your employees and partners. Do you have anything to say about this?”

“Now, Cardellini Pharmaceutical is giving away medicine for free in order to suppress Sunny Pharmaceutical. Don’t you think it’s a little despicable to use such a shoddy business marketing model?”

“Regarding the rumors that Cardellini Enterprise will produce 1 billion dollars worth of free medicine, may I ask if this is true? is it to deliberately cause panic in Sunny Pharmaceutical?”

…

Countless questions were thrown at her.

Steve was helping Monica deal with the reporters.

The five intimidating bodyguards around Monica also pushed the reporters to the sides, preventing the reporters from getting close to Monica.

There was a commotion at the scene.

Monica had no intention of answering the reporters’ questions.

In the past, she would always try to clear her name. If she did anything wrong, she would fight with the reporters until her face turned red.

Now, she felt like she used to be an idiot.

After all, it was useless to argue with the reporters. In fact, they might even write about her in an even worse way.
