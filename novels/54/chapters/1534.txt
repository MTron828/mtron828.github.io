Chapter 1535: Finn and Monica Getting Along

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Just like that, Finn carried Monica back home, and Paige obediently followed beside Finn, looking very cute.

Finn gently placed Monica, who was still sound asleep, on his big bed. Then, he leaned over and planted a kiss on her lips. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Monica twisted her body in discomfort and instinctively licked her lips. Finn’s heart skipped a beat, and he stayed there for a long time, with his lips on Monica’s lips and his eyes on her face.

“Godfather.” Paige really did not want to disturb him.

Her teacher said she should not disturb others when they were doing their work and had to learn to wait quietly. However, she was so hungry that she could collapse.

If she did not eat, she would starve to death. If she starved to death, her parents and brother would not be able to see her. The thought of never seeing her parents and brother again made her very sad.

Finn reluctantly let go of Monica’s soft lips because Paige called him. He suppressed the desire in his heart, turned around, carried Paige out of the room, and gently closed the door for Monica.

When Monica woke up, she was a little confused. It seemed like she had slept for a long time, but it also seemed like she had only slept for a short while.

Anyway, when she opened her eyes, she was a little shocked. After all, the bed she was sleeping on now was Finn’s.

They had shared the same bed for so many years, so she knew where she was at a glance. Even if she did not know where she was… the familiar scent of Finn under the bedsheets…

She quickly got up from the bed and had to admit that she was a little hungry. However, she could not even remember how she fell asleep. She was just sitting in Finn’s snail-speed car with her eyes wide open. How did she fall asleep?

When she opened the door, she saw Finn and Paige sitting on the sofa outside the room watching television. They looked especially harmonious.

From afar, she heard Paige say, “Godfather, are there really two little sisters in Godmother’s belly?”

“It’s true.”

“Then, when can I see them?”

“If nothing unexpected happens, six months later.”

“How long is that?”

“That’s right. When you turn four, you’ll be able to see your sisters.”

“Yay!” Paige was so excited that she was bouncing on the sofa. “I’m going to be a big sister. I’m going to have two little sisters soon.”

“Be careful, don’t fall.”

As he spoke, Finn moved closer to Paige. He was protecting her, for fear that she would accidentally fall off the sofa.

Paige was an obedient child. Seeing that Finn did not allow it, she obediently sat down again. When Finn saw how obedient and lovely Paige was, he started liking children more and more.

“Godfather, what do you think my sisters will look like?” Paige was silent for a second before she suddenly asked out of curiosity.

At that moment, Finn thought about it for a while. As if he really knew what they looked like, he said, “Of course, they’ll look exactly like Godmother.” “I like my sisters to be exactly like Godmother,” Paige quickly agreed.

However, she raised another question in the next second.

“Godfather, why do my brother and I look like my father, but my sisters look

Paige’s IQ at three years old was indeed much higher than her peers. The ability she had to draw references and think logically was rare at her age.

“Because your godmother is good-looking, and because I like your godmother very much, I hope your sisters will look like her.”

“Does it mean that my brother and I look like Daddy because Daddy doesn’t love Mommy?” Paige’s large eyes were filled with curiosity as she looked at him.

Monica listened in on their conversation. Although she was very hungry, but she did not want to disturb them. It was a very heartwarming scene, and it was rare to see Finn radiating such warmth. It was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

“That’s because your mother loves your father very much, so you and your brother look like your father.” Finn secretly changed the concept.

Paige seemed to have understood instantly. “So it’s because Mommy likes

Daddy.”

“Yes.” Finn patted Paige’s little head. “Be good and stay on the sofa.. I’ll go and see if your godmother is awake…”
