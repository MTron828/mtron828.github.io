Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I understand.” Mrs. Winter glared at her son. “Since you’re back with Shelly, when are you both getting married? When are you going to have children? You’re not young anymore!”

“I want to get married and have children, but Shelly said she’s still young and wants to wait for two years. I can’t force it on her. Getting her back wasn’t easy.” Nox looked as if he would never dare to provoke Shelly again. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Mrs. Winter was a little disappointed. “Since you’re both together, you’ll definitely get married and have children. I’ll talk to Shelly later.”

Nox wanted to stop Mrs. Winter. However, he did want to get married and have children, so he decided otherwise.

After washing up, Shelly walked out with Bella in her arms and placed Bella on the mat in the living room to play. Then, as she went back into the kitchen, Mrs. Winter got up and followed Shelly into the kitchen to help Shelly prepare breakfast.

Mrs. Winter was a full-time housewife who contributed a lot to the family. Therefore, although there were servants at home, she would occasionally participate in the housework, especially cooking. She even learned cooking because she wanted her family to eat better.

While helping Shelly toast some bread, she said, “Shelly, you’re 21 years old now and you’ve reached the legal age to get married in Harken. Do you want to get married to Nox soon and move back to the Winters’ residence? Only a few of us live in the biz house. and it gets verv lonelv sometimes.”

Shelly pursed her lips and said, “Auntie, Nox and I are not in a rush to get married. Moreover, our relationship is still unstable. Let’s talk about it when it’s stable.”

“Nox is my son, and I know him best. If he’s serious about it, the relationship must be stable. Don’t worry. If he can’t control himself in the future, I’ll help you with it.”

Shelly chuckled. Since when could others make decisions for Nox?

She said bluntly, “Auntie, Nox and I will settle our relationship matters ourselves. When it’s time to get married, we’ll naturally get married.”

“Getting married is only one aspect of things. The most important thing is to have children. It’s best for your body for you to have children when you’re still young. Moreover, Nox isn’t young anymore. At his age, I should have a few grandchildren by now,” Mrs. Winter said enthusiastically.

Shelly did not know how to answer Mrs. Winter. Ever since she was young, she was taught to listen to the Winters’ every word. However, she was not ready to bear Nox’s children yet.

“Shelly, don’t hesitate. Listen to me. Get married and have children as soon as possible. Raising the child in the Winters won’t be as hard as you raising Bella alone.” Mrs. Winter tried her best to persuade Shelly.

Shelly took a deep breath and mustered her courage to say, “Auntie, I really don’t plan to marry Nox now, nor do I plan to have children. To me, Nox and I are just in the dating phase. We haven’t been together long enough to get married, let alone have children. Besides, I have Bella, so I don’t want to have more children for now.”

“At the end of the day, Bella isn’t your biological daughter! How is that the same?” Mrs. Winter said in a reproachful tone, “Of course, I’m not against Bella joining our family. When you and Nox return to the Winters, Bella will naturally be our precious granddaughter, and we will treat her the same. However, you and Nox must have a child of your own, no matter what!”

Shelly understood where Mrs. Winter was coming from. The Winters needed someone to inherit the huge family business, but that person might not be her.

She said, “Auntie, can you leave our relationship matters to us?”

“Sigh.” Mrs. Winter sighed heavily.

She was still a little unhappy that Shelly did not agree.

“Shelly, you never used to be like this.” Mrs. Winter got a little emotional. “You used to want to be with Nox very much. You even said you wanted to have

Nox’s children. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have had an accidental miscarriage—” “Auntie, let’s not talk about the past.” Shelly interrupted Mrs. Winter.

Seeing that Shelly’s expression was off, Mrs. Winter left the matter be. Instead, she said, “Shelly, I really like you, and I’m happy you and Nox are back together. But Shelly, don’t take the Winters’ kindness for granted. You have to do what you have to do. Don’t make things difficult for everyone..”
