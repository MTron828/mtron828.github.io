1003 You Probably Wouldn’t Remember Me If I Didn’t Take the Initiative to Come To You

Monica pushed Finn away.

The moment she pushed him away, the rebound force from her using too much strength made her sit on the bed.

She was also panting.

At that moment, the room seemed to be a little quiet. In the silence, only Monica’s breathing could be heard.

Finn silently lowered his arm and clenched his fingers. However, there was no expression on his face.

He said coldly, “The doctor said that you’re exhausted and that you haven’t eaten for a day, so you’ll be weaker when you wake up. You’d better eat something first.”

“Alright.” Monica also felt that it was impossible for her to act tough at that moment.

Her instinctive reaction just now was…

It was just an instinctive reaction, and she felt that there was no need to explain anything to Finn.

After all, it was better for her to keep a distance from Finn.

Although she did not know why Finn would take the initiative to help her up, or perhaps it was just a casual move when she fell, she really did not want to have any physical contact with him.

Somehow, she always felt that he would be annoyed, even if he took the initiative.

She did not want Finn to misunderstand anything or think that she was using her weak body to get close to him.

She did not know when she had started to be so careful around Finn.

Perhaps it was because she had ruined their marriage with her own hands that she felt inferior to him.

Or perhaps it was because Finn was her father’s attending doctor, and Finn did not dare to offend her father.

Anyway, there were many reasons, but the final result was that she would never provoke Finn again and would even try to stay as far away from him as possible.

Monica returned to the bed slowly because she was afraid of falling again. However, she tried her best not to show how much pain she was in.

In fact, there should still be some injuries on her body.

She felt that it was very difficult to lift her feet, and her exposed arm was also red and swollen.

Finn stood by her side and did not help her again. He just watched her lie down on the hospital bed again with great difficulty and like a snail.

He pressed the call button for her. “Please send dinner to Ward 028.”

“Alright,” the other party quickly agreed.

The room fell into silence again as they silently waited for Monica’s dinner.

In fact, Monica did not know why Finn was still around or why he was here.

She tried her best to hold that curiosity of hers in, but in the end, she could not help herself anymore and asked, “It’s getting late. Why don’t you go home and rest? I hope you’ll be in your best condition for my father’s surgery tomorrow.”

Finn did not respond.

Hence, Monica continued, “I’ll be fine on my own. After dinner, I’ll go back to my dad’s ward to accompany him–”

“Do you know how you got into the car accident?” Finn suddenly interrupted her.

It caught Monica by surprise.

Finn said, “I checked your car. Someone has tampered with your brakes.”

Of course, she knew.

There was no reaction when she stepped on the brakes, and she was very sure that when she went to the little boy’s house, her car was fine.

There was no way the brakes would suddenly stop working after she went to the little boy’s house.

However, she did not have time to think about who it could be.

In fact, there was no need for her to think too deeply about it because who else could it be other than Michael?

Her actions today had probably angered Michael. Otherwise, why would he think of killing her?

“I suggest you be careful during this period of time,” Finn said bluntly.

“I’ll be careful.” Monica nodded.

Her attitude toward Finn had changed in the sense that she would go with whatever he said and not go against him.

“It’s best to rest a little more after dinner. Blood loss after a car accident will lead to low blood sugar, and it’s easier to faint.” Finn reminded.

“Yes.” Monica nodded obediently.

With that, Finn left the ward, and as a doctor, he left only after giving a few simple instructions.

After he left, Monica heaved a sigh of relief. When she had nothing to talk about, she really did not know how to get along with Finn.

She leaned against the head of the bed and stared at the ceiling above her.

In fact, forgetting someone was not difficult at all.

As long as she recognized the difference between them, understood that the other party had given up, kept telling herself that it was impossible for them to be together, and kept suppressing her feelings, the relationship was over.

Monica ate the dinner the nurse sent over.

She did not have much of an appetite, but she forced herself to finish it all.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
