Chapter 284: Jeanne Leaves, While George Is Kidnapped

Kingsley was afraid that Jeanne would act rashly.

“Okay.” Jeanne agreed immediately.

After hanging up the phone, Jeanne waited for Kingsley at the intersection.

She told herself that there was no need to panic.

No matter what, George was not in danger. Even if he was captured by Fourth Master Swan, he would not be in danger.

Even so, her eyes narrowed.

Her expression was still a little ugly.

Not long after, Kingsley came.

A black car stopped in front of Jeanne, and the car door opened. “Get in.”

Jeanne quickly got into the car.

She sat next to Kingsley and said, “I suspect it’s Fourth Master Swan.”

Kingsley nodded.

“Fourth Master Swan will definitely bring George to Bamboo Garden. We’ll go straight there now.” Jeanne had thought it through.

Since the soft approach could not work, she would use the hard approach.

She believed that she could leave if she wanted to!

Kingsley refused, “No, we’ll go to the airport now.”

Jeanne looked at Kingsley in disbelief.

Kingsley repeated, “We’ll go to the airport now!”

“George is seized by Fourth Master Swan!” Jeanne reminded him.

Kingsley said, “I know, so at least he isn’t in danger!”

“What right do you have to say that he’s not in danger?!” Jeanne was furious.

She was mad.

“Do you know what kind of person Fourth Master Swan is?! How can you be sure that George isn’t in danger?!” Jeanne asked him fiercely.

Kingsley was a little quiet.

He did not seem like he wanted to compromise.

At this moment, the car was already heading toward the intersection of the airport highway.

Jeanne did not want to waste any more time with Kingsley.

Her pupils constricted, and she immediately wanted to go to the driver’s seat to move the steering wheel and force the car to turn. She did not want to get on the highway.

She had just moved when Kingsley suddenly restrained her.

Jeanne’s pupils constricted.

The driver in the driver’s seat had also noticed Jeanne’s strange movements. She looked at Jeanne through the rearview mirror and smiled. “Jeannie, you’re still so stubborn.”

Jeanne was stunned.

She did not expect Kingsley to bring Lucy along.

“Uh, Kingsley was afraid that you’d go back on your word, so he asked me to come and persuade you if it’s necessary.” Lucy seemed to have seen through Jeanne’s doubt, so she explained.

At that moment, she even smiled.

Even for a woman in her thirties, at such a charming age, her every move, every frown, and every smile were alluring.

This was probably the reason Lucy was able to stay by Kingsley’s side even though he had so many women. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lucy was a woman that Jeanne truly admired.

Despite that, at this moment, Jeanne refused flatly, “I want to take George with me and leave! I can’t leave him behind!”

“I’ll send you off first then go save George!” Kingsley said clearly.

“Why can’t you include me?!”

“I’m not at ease,” Kingsley said affirmatively, “I’m not at ease with letting you face Fourth Master Swan!”

“Kingsley, I’ve decided to go with you. What exactly are you uneasy about?!”

“You’ll compromise for George.”

“I won’t!” Jeanne was very determined. At that moment, she was very angry.

Lucy watched their argument through the rearview mirror.

To be honest, after so many years, only Jeanne could make such a big fuss and act so recklessly toward Kingsley.

When the others saw Kingsley, they were all respectful.

Even Lucy did not dare to behave atrociously in front of Kingsley.

This man was sometimes very scary when he was ruthless.

Therefore, at this moment, Lucy drove quietly and very seriously. It was her duty as a driver.

“Kingsley, stop the car!” Jeanne was enraged.

She was infuriated.

It would not matter if it was anyone else, but not George.

“I’m telling you to stop the car!” Jeanne roared angrily. She was so mad that her eyes were red.

Kingsley was still indifferent.

“Kingsley, do you know how important George is to me?”

“Do you know how important you are to me?!” Kingsley suddenly turned his head to look at her.

Jeanne’s heart moved.

Kingsley’s words made her feel a little uncomfortable.

“How important George is to you is how important you are to me!” Kingsley was also very angry at Jeanne.

The two of them confronted each other.

Kingsley said, “I said that I’ll take George away. I’ll keep that promise!”

“Why can’t you let me follow you? Am I that untrustworthy?”

“Not in regards to Fourth Master Swan’s matters.”

“Kingsley, is that all the trust you have for me? Do you really think that I’ll lose my sense of propriety for a man?!” Jeanne’s eyes were bloodshot.

What made her feel even worse was Kingsley’s distrust of her.

“Today, either I take George and leave South Hampton City, or I die in South Hampton City!” Jeanne looked at Kingsley and asked him fiercely, “Is that alright?!”
