1377 Do I Have To Dig My Heart Out For You To See It?

Finn kept staring at Monica with cruelty, coldness, and pain in his eyes… There were so many emotions that Monica could not understand.

However, at that moment, she felt a little glad. After so many years, she finally saw the mix of emotions in Finn’s eyes.

She had always thought that he was a cold-blooded animal without any emotions. To him, nothing else but social responsibility existed; he was living without a soul.

Where did she get the courage to think that she could make a soulless man fall in love with her?

They looked at each other, and Finn suddenly let go of Brandon’s hand, which was numb from the pain.

“I didn’t know I’d been such a failure in the past three years.” Finn said in a cold voice, “In the three years we were together, not only did I not take good care of you, but I also made you lose all hope in love and almost made you suffer from depression. ”

Monica really did not want to argue with Finn. She was really so tired that she really did not want to waste any more energy on that relationship. That was why she had to cut off all their feelings for each other and all possibilities for reconciliation.

“Brandon, let’s go,” Monica called out to Brandon.

“What do I have to do to make you feel that I love you?” Finn called out to her.

Monica sneered and replied, “If you really love me, you don’t have to do anything.”

Therefore, how much of a failure was he to love a woman to the point where he was willing to die for her but made her feel that he did not love her at all?

“Finn, you really don’t have a heart,” Monica said resolutely.

She thought she heard Finn chuckle, but it also seemed like an illusion.

“Do I have to dig out my heart for you to see it?” he asked with bloodshot eyes.

Monica felt a sharp pain in her heart.

She really did not know why Finn would suddenly act so radically.

She had never thought that Finn would become so agitated because of the breakup. On the contrary, she thought that Finn would remain calm and accept their departure indifferently.

Her vision was getting blurry.

She did not dare to try again. Even though she could feel that Finn was different from usual, as if he had fallen in love, she really did not dare to accept his love so easily.

How many years could a woman give a man? She was afraid if she held on for another ten more years, she would really lose herself in the relationship.

Without saying anything else, she turned around and left with the coldest attitude — ignoring all his feelings and leaving with another man.

The two of them walked into the elevator together, and the moment the elevator closed, Finn reached out to block it.

Monica looked at him while holding herself back. He looked like he was really injured this time. However, she had no idea why Finn was so persistent this time.

What was it that he could not let go of? He was clearly a cold-blooded person, and every time they broke up, his life was great.

“Monica, give me some time. I’ll prove it to you,” Finn pleaded.

He was acting so humble that Monica’s tears fell uncontrollably. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She did not need Finn to treat her like that. In fact, she did not want to owe anyone anything. Whether it was the past or now, no matter how she had changed, her conscience would not allow her to owe anyone.

She said, “Finn, what’s the point?”

Why did they have to make each other so sad?

“I can’t lose you,” Finn said.

He was telling her the truth. He really could not lose her this time, or he did now know what would become of him.

Would he become numb to everything? Would he lose all hope of the world?

He did not know. All he knew was that he really did not want her to leave; he did not want them to become strangers.

“Don’t leave me. Even if we want to break up, we should think about it carefully and give each other some time to adapt.” Finn was begging her humbly.

He was begging her to give him some time to adapt even though it would mean that they broke up. However, that was just an excuse to make her stay, no matter how despicable the method was.

Still, he was wrong to think that Monica loved him and that he could get her back if she let her leave. As long as he took the initiative and Monica saw his sincerity, they could reconcile.
