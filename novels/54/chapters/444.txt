Chapter 445: Humiliating Eden In Public

“Why is there no news that Swan Enterprise is doing charity?” Jeanne asked.

“I have too many things to do and haven’t followed up on the news for a while. I admit this is my mistake, but Director Lawrence can’t just take this as me allocating funds to Minze District! Moreover, what benefits do I get from allocating funds to Minze District?” Eden asked in return.

“Don’t you know full well whether there are benefits or not?” Jeanne asked sarcastically.

Eden’s expression darkened. “Director Lawrence, I think you’ve concluded that I was the one who did this based on these few sets of data. Do you think you’re convincing?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“But all these funds eventually ended up in Minze District’s Chamber of Commerce. Doesn’t that prove something?”

“I’ve donated the money, and since the social organizations have accepted my money, they’ll use it wherever they need to. It’s their business what they do with the money. Out of courtesy, they can report the money they used to us. But now, I can tell you very clearly that I haven’t received a single financial statement from them, so I really don’t know where their money went,” Eden said bluntly, seemingly having thought of all the measures.

He had probably thought about the matter very carefully, and that was why he appeared so calm throughout the entire process.

He continued, “Moreover, the six charity organizations that you’re accusing are government public welfare organizations. To put it bluntly, they are approved of by the Sanders. The Chamber of Commerce, under the Sanders’ government, is responsible for promoting the development of the local economy. Now, these six charity organizations are investing the funds into the Chamber of Commerce, which is also an investment in the public’s social welfare. Isn’t operations like that a very normal thing?”

Jeanne just looked at Eden with a magnanimous look.

When Henry heard what Eden said, he quickly spoke as well. He was probably still a little unconvinced by Jeanne’s words earlier. “Did you hear that? Charity funds are very complicated, to begin with. If you don’t understand, don’t question it here. I suggest you ask more questions before holding this kind of meeting. Otherwise... you will embarrass Edward!”

Jeanne glanced at Henry before ignoring him.

She continued to look straight at Eden. “What you mean is that you were only responsible for allocating the funds to these few charity organizations and did not manage where the funds ended up. You were just following Swan Enterprise’s standard procedures.”

“Yes.” Eden was very confident.

......

“In that case...” Jeanne scrolled down the screen on the projector. “I would like to ask again. The Swan Enterprise allocated some funds to One Organization a month ago, but why did we donate more money to them in less than 20 days? One Organization is not the only one. Sunshine Organization was also just allocated funds two months ago. Why didn’t Director Eden review such frequent allocation? Does he think he could get it approved since the request went through?”

Suddenly, Eden felt a little nervous.

At that time, all he wanted was to transfer all the money into the Chamber of Commerce for a reasonable reason, so he looked for a few government public welfare organizations to carry out his plans. To begin with, there were not many government public welfare organizations. Hence, to split the funds… he had no choice at all, and that was why he had not considered the fact that the allocation of funds was too frequent.

He gritted his teeth and said, “I really didn’t pay too much attention to this. I’ll check it later.”

“Do you always make such mistakes, Director Eden?” Jeanne asked.

“As I said, I’ve been busy, so I might not have been paying enough attention to these donations. What’s more, I have to say that Swan Enterprise has a donation quota to meet every year. In principle, it can’t be too much or too little. The current donation quota is under control, so I didn’t pay much attention to it! Moreover, Swanhaven Bank still has a lot of things I need to deal with. Right now, I’m negotiating a loan contract with a foreign country, and I admit I don’t have enough energy for these trivial matters.”

Of course, Jeanne would not listen to Eden’s words. She said, “Swan Enterprise’s annual donation quota can’t exceed 300 million. This is only October. According to the usual practice, the end of the year is when every company does charitable activities. Now that Director Eden has used up the Swan Enterprise’s quota, isn’t this something you should be putting more attention on? Logically speaking, under such circumstances, you should at least report it to the headquarters.”
