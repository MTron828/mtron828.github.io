Chapter 800: Exciting and Intense, Rescuing Jeanne

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward held his breath as the gunshots were getting closer and closer.

He was listening carefully to the footsteps.

There should be three people approaching. On top of that, he had killed two people just now, and there should be one left from that group.

He held his gun up and kept his cool. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Now, it was a one versus three, so they should still have a chance of winning.

He listened to the sound of their footsteps, and according to the speed at which they were approaching, he chanted in his heart, “Three, two, one!”

Edward suddenly stretched out his body.

Facing the three people who suddenly approached, he aimed his gun at their heads and flipped on the ground agilely. The gunshot sounded three times.

The three of them had their guns in their hands, but all of them fell to the ground without pulling the trigger.

Edward rolled over and got up. However, just as he stood up, his expression darkened.

Sure enough, there was one more person in the dark who was already aiming a gun at his head.

He had no time to dodge the bullet.

At that moment, a gunshot sounded in the distance. “Bang!”

The man in the dark fell to the ground.

Edward looked up and saw that on the second floor, K01 had put away his gun and left.

Edward, too, had no time to waste.

With such a huge commotion, it would naturally attract many people to come closer, so he needed to evacuate immediately.

Hence, he moved in the direction he planned.

His footsteps were quick as his pursuers were also following him closely.

With that, he changed his route and went straight to the second floor.

There was a balcony on the second floor, and if he was not wrong, Jeanne would be taken away below the balcony.

Even if he missed the timing, he could jump down from the balcony and choose the shortest route. Hence, he quickly went up the stairs, drawing a distance from him and his pursuers.

When he was upstairs, he weaved through the corridor on the second floor.

The main rooms of the building were all on the second floor, seemingly without much planning. It was as if that a room was built wherever it was convenient, and whoever liked it could stay there.

The map of the second floor kept appearing in his mind, so he moved quickly according to the directions in his mind.

Suddenly, he leaned to the side and instantly hid in a room, leaving the door half-closed.

There were more patrols here.

Thus, once the accident broke out, the map Kingsley had given him could only be used as a reference.

He hid himself and watched the patrol through the gap.

Just as a patrol walked past him, the guy suddenly gave chase, probably because he saw someone suspicious, and disappeared in front of Edward along with the sound of gunfire.

Edward quickly left the room and headed in the opposite direction.

However, as soon as he went over, he saw that K01 was being chased.

Perhaps it was because he had been discovered when he had shot for him just now, so her actions had been exposed.

Edward aimed at the group of people chasing K01 and fired, killing two people.

The others quickly went into hiding.

At the same time, Edward also hid himself in the dark, in the same direction as K01.

Edward gestured to K01, who nodded and took out a small bomb before throwing it out.

Suddenly, a bullet hit the bomb, and the bomb exploded, blowing up a large building outside.

In the meantime, Edward quickly found the few people hiding based on the direction of the bullets and aimed his gun at them. Every shot was accurate, and they all died.

K01 appeared behind Edward.

“We’re even,” Edward said and walked forward without any further delay.

K01 turned around and looked at Edward, not expecting the man to be so skilled.

At that moment, he did not plan to split up again, so he followed Edward instead.

Edward glanced at K01.

As a man, many things were self-evident.

With that, the two of them quickly arrived at the balcony on the second floor, which was, in fact, both their destinations.

K01 said, “I just happened to see a group of people coming out of a room. I could vaguely see that it was Jeanne, but I can’t be sure. If I’m not wrong, they should have left in this direction, and according to the time, they shouldn’t have passed by yet.”

At that moment, Edward pursed his lips.

In that case, his guess should not be wrong, and fortunately, it was not. Otherwise…

His eyes narrowed.

K01 had also noticed a group of people walking past below.

At a glance, there were seven people — two in the front, two at the back, and three in the middle, where one of them was holding a woman who looked like Jeanne and the other two were walking closely beside them.

“I’ll distract them.” K01 said bluntly, “You go and save Jeanne.”

“Alright,” Edward agreed immediately.
