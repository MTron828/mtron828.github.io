Chapter 838 Monica Begins to Fight Back, and Finn Saw Her Wound

“You’re awake?” Edward’s room door was pushed open by Finn.

Edward and Nox looked at him.

Nox could not help but tease, “The great doctor sleeps quite well.”

Finn had indeed just woken up from his sleep.

Halfway through, he woke up once and asked Teddy to ask someone to make some porridge for Edward. Edward had not eaten for a long time, so it was best to replenish his food after he woke up.

After giving the instructions, Finn went back to sleep.

Finn could not sleep for a long time last night but accidentally overslept today.

He was able to sleep in peace because of his trust in Nox.

He had always felt that he had to take care of Edward.

Nox was more attentive than anyone else.

Finn walked straight to Edward and took his temperature and blood pressure. After confirming that everything was normal, he changed the dressing for Edward’s wounds.

As he changed the medicine, he said casually, “Your right hand is seriously injured.”

Edward nodded slightly and did not hide anything. “The night I saved Jeanne, she jumped from a high altitude. In order to save her, I also jumped down and rubbed my hands against the pillar, so I grazed myself.

“You’re really willing to give up your life for Jeanne.” Nox could not help but interrupt.

Edward did not reply.

Finn asked, “Did you take medicine again?”

Otherwise, Edward could not have had such a strong explosive force that allowed him to jump down from such a high altitude and still be alive with Jeanne.

In addition, Finn had gone to the M Underground Organization to check out the situation.

He was almost certain.

“Mm.”

“You can’t take too much of that medicine. You’re taking it too often,” Finn reminded Edward, ” I remember you ate it in Balti Islands just 2 months ago.

Edward did not refute.

“It’s best to keep it once every half a year. The gap can’t be less than 3 months. You’ve obviously gone over the limit,” Finn noted.

At that time, Edward had no choice but to save Jeanne.

Of course, he was not acting on impulse.

When he and Kingsley had gone to save Jeanne, he was ready to take the medicine.

Hence, that night, Edward had put the medicine in his mouth in advance. When he really needed it, he bit through the capsule and ate it.

Fortunately, the reaction time of that drug was very short.

The effect would be seen almost immediately.

Edward’s body would immediately reach its peak state.

Otherwise...

He and Jeanne would have fallen to their deaths from the high platform.

“Don’t joke around with your body.” Finn was very serious.

When they first started researching this drug, they were well aware that the side effects of the drug were very severe. Ordinary people would not even be able to try it as it was very likely that they would not be able to withstand the stimulation of the drug. They would bleed from their seven orifices and die from a heart explosion. However, Fourth Master Swan was challenging the limits of the drug.

His weak body at the moment was clearly due to this medicine.

“It’s no use telling him.” Nox interrupted again. “He’ll risk his life for Jeanne again.”

Edward glanced at Nox.

Nox was unhappy. “I didn’t say anything wrong.”

Edward pursed his lips.

Nox was not wrong.

Finn also knew very well that Fourth Master Swan was a rational person. If he did something irrational, it would be because he could not be rational.

He could not control himself.

The others could not help him either.

Finn could only explain the aftereffects clearly. As for what Fourth Master Swan would choose, it would be up to his sense of propriety. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Edward would consider whether he should or not and whether it would be worth it.

Finn changed the medicine on Edward’s wounds and said, “Rest well. Don’t get out of bed these few days. The gunshot wound on your leg also needs to heal.”

Edward responded.

Finn helped him lie down.

Nox also got up from the sofa at this moment. His back was aching from last night’s sleep, so he twisted her body. He asked, “Have you had breakfast?”

“Not yet.” Finn was tidying up his first aid kit.

“Me neither,” Nox said.

“Fourth Master, have you eaten?” Finn asked casually.

“Don’t mention it. My eyes were tortured early in the morning,” Nox said.

“Hm?”

“It’s George. That little brat had always hated Fourth Master Swan, but he came early in the morning to feed him breakfast. I was so stunned when I saw him.”

“You’re jealous.” Finn hit the nail on the head.

Nox’s eyes were about to pop out. “Jealous my*ass! I just find it unbelievable.”

Finn smiled.

He rarely smiled.

He did not like to smile.

He did not like to talk.

Very few people knew what he was thinking.

He had very few facial expressions.

If he did not look so gentle, he might have looked very scary.
