1087 Great Satisfaction, Michael’s Tragic End

“Yes.” Monica’s eyes moved slightly. She said, “You don’t have to wait for me. You can leave first.”

“But–”

“Thank you for today,” Monica said politely.

She was so polite and there was a lack of emotion in her tone that it made people think she was unreal.

Seeing that Monica had rejected him, Judah no longer insisted. He said, “Ms. Cardellini, if you have any needs in the future, you can come and look for me again. Of course, I hope everything will go well for you for the rest of your life and that you won’t need me in any way.”

Monica’s lips curved into a faint smile, a smile that was not sincere, and she said, “Okay.”

With that, Judah left.

After he left, she was the only one left in the court.

She looked at the majestic courtroom and suddenly did not know where she should go. Suddenly, she felt a little lost.

All her goals had been achieved — she had finally made Michael receive a death sentence. The man she had even wanted to die with had finally met a tragic end.

On top of that, the crisis of Cardellini Pharmaceutical had also been resolved. Once Sunny Pharmaceutical went bankrupt, and Sunny Pharmaceutical’s drugs could no longer be circulated in the market, Cardellini Pharmaceutical would become a platform for all pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to compete for its products. It was only a matter of time before Cardellini Pharmaceutical returned to its former glory.

Everything was done, but she was not happy at all.

Was it that extreme joy begets sorrow?

However, she had to do something. In fact, she had never been happy. She just suddenly felt that she had lost her purpose of living.

By then, a staff of the court was urging her to leave because they needed to clean up the courtroom.

Monica responded. Then, she lowered her head, took out a pill from her bag, and swallowed it.

After that, he got up and left the courtroom.

At the entrance of the court, the few black bodyguards were standing there, waiting for her respectfully.

Monica looked at them and said, “You don’t have to follow me anymore.”

The few of them did not understand.

“There’s no danger anymore, so there’s no need to follow me,” Monica said bluntly.

“But–”

“I will explain to Nox.” Monica was firm with her decision.

As such, the bodyguard could only obey.

The moment Monica left, she suddenly remembered that Nox had been kicked out of court because of her.

To be honest, Nox’s actions really touched her. Regardless of whether it was Jeanne’s request or any other reason, she had decided to call Nox her friend.

Monica walked passed the long flight of stairs outside the courtroom.

As it had been a while since the trial ended, and the reporters waiting there had all left, she got into her car and drove away.

She heard Michael would be locked up and executed in the nearest prison.

She felt the need to visit him before he died. Therefore, she parked her car at the prison gate in the suburbs, went through the procedures, and saw Michael.

Perhaps it was because Michael would be executed tomorrow, so from a humane point of view, outsiders would not be stopped from visiting as long as they did not violate any rules.

She sat on a stool in the prison and watched as Michael show up in front of her in his prison uniform and with his hair shaved.

The moment Michael saw Monica, his originally cold face finally showed a trace of emotion.

“Only 20 minutes!” the prison guard said grimly.

Then, he rudely pressed Michael down on the stool in front of him.

Michael’s eyes met Monica’s, and the two of them were silent for a while.

Monica said, “Michael, have you ever thought that such a day would come?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Michael just stared at Monica coldly.

“I’ve never really thought about it,” Monica said bluntly and looked at Michael, taking in all his forbearance and anger.

Perhaps only a person like Michael could force himself to not go crazy at a time like that.

“I’ve always thought that you were a good, cheerful, uplifting, and upright person. I even thought that you’d do a lot of good to the people of Harken in the future because you’d be a clean and honest government servant. I was even very proud that I had a great friend like you,” Monica whispered.

There was no sarcasm and, of course, no emotion in her tone.

“Back then, for the sake of your image, I was willing to give up my marriage to help you not because I loved you very much, but because I felt that you were worth it — for me and the people of this country. I always thought that if a good person like you could serve the country, it must be a blessing for the people, and I shouldn’t ruin your political career. So, even if I was misunderstood by everyone and lost the person I loved the most, I would do it without any hesitation,” Monica said.
