Shelly was shocked by Bella’s crying. She quickly hugged Bella and said with her heart aching, “Bella, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?”

Bella choked and said, “Mommy, I don’t want Daddy to leave us. I want to be with Daddy. I don’t want you both to be separated.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Shelly was surprised. She knew that Bella’s relationship with Nox had improved a lot, but she did not expect it to have reached the point where they could not bear to part. As she had lived with Bella for so many years, she thought that Bella had long gotten used to spending time with her.

“Bella, don’t cry.” Shelly comforted her. “Don’t you still have me if you don’t have Daddy? Aren’t I always with you? Aren’t you with just the two of us?”

“I am happy, but I prefer to live with both you and Daddy. That way, no one will laugh at me for not having a father.”

Shelly pursed her lips. She knew nothing about Bella being mocked for not having a father.

She hugged Bella tightly and said, “I’m sorry, Bella, but Daddy and I really can’t be together.”

“Why? Is Daddy not good enough? Are you going to abandon Daddy?” Bella asked her with tears in her eyes.

“Daddy has many… shortcomings that I can’t accept. In fact, we’re not very happy together,” Shelly said bluntly. She realized that she had no choice but to explain many things to Bella.

Bella blinked her teary eyes at Shelly as if she did not quite understand.

“Bella, when two people are together, especially with husband and wife, they must love each other. Otherwise, if they’re forced to be together, no one would not be happy.”

“But I think Daddy loves you very, very much! Daddy always wants your attention, and he always looks at you without blinking.” Bella said seriously, “Since Daddy loves you so much, why don’t you tell Daddy to change?”

Shelly was suddenly rendered speechless by Bella as she did not expect such logic from such a young child like Bella.

She had always thought that Bella was still too young to understand anything, and that was why she never told Bella anything. Yet now, she realized that adults had underestimated children’s intelligence.

Shelly said, “There are some shortcomings that Daddy can’t change.”

“Did you tell Daddy about these shortcomings?” Bella asked seriously.

Shelly shook her head.

“If you didn’t, how do you know Dad can’t change? I think Daddy will change. He will.” Bella had unconditional trust in Nox.

Shelly, however, was speechless again.

After a few seconds of silence, she said, “Daddy has done a lot of things that hurt me, and I can’t forgive him.”

“My teachers always say that good children know their mistakes and changes.

If Daddy changes, Daddy will be a good child. Why can’t Mommy forgive Daddy? My teachers say that as long as we admit our mistakes, all children should be forgiven.” Bella started to reason with Shelly.

“Adults are different from children.”

“Why is it different? Doesn’t everyone make mistakes? It’s fine as long as the person who makes the mistake changes. Mommy, you can’t be so selfish. You must give Daddy a chance to change,” Bella protested.

Shelly took a deep breath. “Bella, I will consider what you said. However, can I handle my own affairs? Didn’t your teachers tell you to be responsible for your own things?” “Yes.” Bella nodded.

“So, can I solve it myself?”

“Sure,” Bella said in her tender voice. “But you must tell Daddy what’s wrong with him. You must accept Daddy’s apology. You can’t decide to separate on your own.”

“Bella, can you respect my decision? I know you’ve grown up and have the ability to discern things. However, I’m an adult, and I have the ability to discern things too. So, I would only make my decisions after careful consideration, and Bella must choose to support me, okay?”

“Alright.” Bella nodded helplessly. “But I still want Daddy and Mommy…” “Be good,” Shelly interrupted Bella.

Bella pouted. She really did not want to leave her father. She was very happy living with both her parents.

Nox only came back after dinner, and when he returned, it was almost 11 p.m..
