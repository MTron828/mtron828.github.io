Alexander was so angry that he kicked the coffee table in front of him, making a loud noise.

Shocked, Jenifer quickly went forward and said, “Alexander, don’t be angry. It’s not good for your health, and some people don’t care even if you are angry.”

Alexander said coldly, “She will eventually!”

Joshua, who was also in the living room at the moment, quickly agreed, “Jeanne is courting death! And she won’t end well!”

The three people downstairs all wanted her to die immediately.

Nevertheless, Jeanne did not care. After all, she also wanted all the Lawrences to die a horrible death! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

She faced Jonathan respectfully and explained her reasons, “Everyone rejected Quinn because of Quinn’s shocking identity. Every company’s concern is that a person like her will be impossible to control. I admit that we have no way to control Quinn, and we don’t even dare to offend her. However, this doesn’t mean Quinn cannot join the company.”

Jonathan did not speak. It was as if he was patiently listening to her explanation.

Jeanne said, “All people see is the pressure Quinn’s identity will bring to the company. However, they’ve never thought about the other way around. Isn’t Quinn’s identity also a resource for our company? First of all, news about Quinn joining Lawrence Enterprise company will become a hot topic, and it’s free publicity for us to spread our image to the public. If the second princess of the Sanders is working at Lawrence Enterprise, our future will be limitless. Then, won’t Lawrence Enterprise’s stock market soar?

“Second of all, Quinn’s identity as a princess of the Sanders can, in fact, act to control Quinn. Her every move represents the Sanders, so she will manage herself better or even stricter than others for fear of ruining her reputation. In fact, we don’t have to worry too much about Quinn not listening to the arrangements of the company. What she wants more is to perform in the company. Moreover, Quinn is very capable. I’ve seen her resume. If she can bring us what we need, she’ll be an asset.”

Jeanne seemed to have convinced Jonathan.

He looked at Jeanne and said, “Actually, I’ve considered all the things you just told me. I’m actually not against Quinn joining Lawrence Enterprise, and I think that with Quinn’s status, she wouldn’t bring harm to the company. Overall, it’s beneficial to us. But in the end, there are two sides to everything. If you can’t control her, you’ll get half the results, and the gains can never make up for the losses. What I want to know now is whether you have control over Quinn. Can you not be afraid of Quinn’s status and control her?”

“I can,” Jeanne gave him an affirmative answer.

At that moment, she could not help but secretly sneer at herself.

What Jonathan was trying to say now was that if Quinn really caused trouble in the Lawrence Enterprise, she would be the one to offend Quinn. In other words, if Quinn were to bring harm to the Lawrence Enterprise, she would have to step forward and confront Quinn head-on.

She would have to bear all the consequences!

The corners of Jeanne’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Grandpa, I was the one who recruited her. I will definitely take full responsibility!”

Jeanne gave her promise to Jonathan even though she knew he would not be around anymore soon for her to keep her promise.

However, at that moment, Jonathan was visibly happy. He said, “I was right to trust you. You are more courageous than your father and your brother, Jeannie.”

Jonathan sighed, feeling emotional.

He lamented, “If only you were a boy.”

Jeanne could tell that Jonathan’s words were sincere. From the bottom of his heart, he acknowledged her and felt helpless and regretful toward her.

Jeanne smiled.

Of course, she would not be moved.

After all, if Jonathan did not think highly of her, he would not have said such words. However, by saying that, he meant that the Lawrences would be given to Joshua no matter what.

It was because Joshua was the only son of the Lawrences, and only he could carry on the family line.

If it were in the past, she might still feel sad. However, after knowing that she was not one of them, she felt nothing.

“Actually, it’s not important. You don’t need to feel bad. Even if you give it to Joshua in the future, I will help him manage the company well,” Jeanne said generously.

Jonathan was somewhat gratified. “Your father and brother should really be grateful to you.”
