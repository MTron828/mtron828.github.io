Chapter 424: Finn Is Out of the Intensive Care Unit, and Monica Takes the Initiative

That was her bottom line.

If he had to take care of Patsy, he must have a reason for having to take care of her.

She would accept it, but he just should not let her know. After all, she was very stupid and easy to fool.

Finn’s heart suddenly hurt.

Monica had never been a person who could compromise.

He did not want Monica to repay him in such a way because she felt guilty and touched, so he said, “Monica, I don’t need you to repay me.”

Monica looked at him.

“If it were anyone else, I would protect them as long as it’s within my ability. I’m not against you— Mm.”

Finn froze, looking straight at Monica.

He watched as she suddenly got close to his face and kissed his lips so hard that what he wanted to say disappeared into her kiss.

Monica had always been so bold, and no matter with who, she would always take the initiative.

Finn looked at Monica, who was kissing him with her eyes closed.

In fact, she did not go too deep into the kiss. She just did not want him to say something she did not want to hear at that moment. To be more precise, she was afraid that Finn’s words would make her worried.

......

Anyway, she had already made up her mind.

No matter what happened, she wanted to be with Finn for the rest of her life.

She did not want to hide her feelings anymore. As long as Finn did not push her away, she would cling to him for the rest of her life.

Their lips were together for a long time before they parted.

Finn’s face turned red again.

At that moment, Monica seemed to have realized something as her hand was close to Finn’s chest.

As expected, his heart was beating very fast. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A smug smile appeared on her lips. “Finn, could it be that your heart was racing just now because I was on your body?”

Finn turned his face away from Monica as if he was secretly adjusting his emotions.

“How old are you?” Monica complained.

Finn’s expression changed slightly.

Then, he suddenly recalled Monica saying he was “an old man’s son”.

He was five years older than Monica, so when Monica was still in university, he had already started working.

Hence, there was an age difference between them, but it was not to the extent of using the word “old” to describe him, right?

“Why are you still shy?” Monica usually could not read people’s emotions. She stared at Finn. “And you blushed just from a kiss. What would you do if I were to sleep with you?”

“Monica,” Finn called out to her.

Monica pouted. “I’m going to sleep with you sooner or later anyway.”

“Can you be more reserved?”

“I’ve been reserved for three years,” Monica answered seriously. “Three years, and I haven’t climbed into your bed yet.”

He was actually speechless.

“Anyway, once you’ve recovered, we have to consummate our marriage,” Monica said firmly.

“I still have a long way to recover from my current condition,” Finn said bluntly.

“It doesn’t matter. If I’ve waited for three years, I can wait for another three months.” Monica seemed to have thought it through very clearly and planned it all out.

Finn did not know what to say.

“Right.” Monica suddenly thought of something.

Finn frowned.

“The nurse said I have to clean your body for you.”

“Monica...”

“Wait for me.”

Monica stood up, picked up her walking stick, and walked to the bathroom.

After some thought, she called for the nurse.

The nurse helped to bring in a basin of warm water for Monica and placed it beside Finn’s bed. Then, she adjusted the temperature of the air conditioner to a suitable one before she naturally went to untie Finn’s hospital gown.

“You can leave now,” Monica called out.

The nurse glanced at Mrs. Jones in front of her, thinking, ‘Isn’t Mrs. Jones a patient?’

“Monica, let the nurse do it,” Finn said.

“Why?” Monica was about to cry.

She felt so aggrieved that her eyes were red.

Finn paused for a moment, shocked by Monica’s sudden expression.

“You’d rather let an old woman touch you than let me touch you.”

The nurse felt very wronged.

How was she touching him? She was just taking care of the patient’s daily life.

Moreover, she had been a nurse for many years and had taken care of such patients countless times. Although Dr. Jones was very handsome, she was not so old as to have any thoughts about him. Nurses also had professional ethics.
