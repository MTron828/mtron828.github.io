987 Scheming Against Michael, Kingsley’s Cruelty

Jeanne was right.

When Kingsley saw Jeanne’s message, he immediately smashed his phone to the ground, and it broke into pieces!

His angry expression made his entire face look ferocious.

At that moment, he did not even know whether he was angry at Jeanne for resisting him, or at Lucy for acting on her own initiative, or…

He clenched his fists, and his veins popped out.

Jeanne’s words rang in his ear. “You just don’t want to admit that you don’t want other men to touch Lucy!”

F*ck!

Kingsley suddenly punched the coffee table beside him, and the tempered glass on the coffee table instantly shattered.

One had to know that the glass was bulletproof. How angry must a person be to be able to unleash such powerful strength?

…

In a five-star hotel in a big city in Country R, Lucy was in the bathroom of a luxurious suite.

She was going crazy.

From the moment Kerby called Kingsley and the latter said that no one was allowed to help her, she knew that she had to rely on herself tonight.

If she could not hold on, her only outcome was death.

She bit her lip and tried to control herself.

She did not want to die either. At least, she did not want to die before she killed Millie.

However, on second thought, Jeanne should be able to help her get rid of Millie if she were to die.

At that thought, she seemed to relax a little.

She was using cold water to relieve the pain and the heat in her body when suddenly, there was a knock on the bathroom door.

By then, Lucy was already hallucinating, so she did not know if someone was knocking on the door or if she was fantasizing that someone was knocking.

“Ms. Harmon!” Kerby called out a few times.

However, there was no response from the bathroom.

He gritted his teeth and pushed the door with all his might. Upon pushing it open, he saw Lucy lying on the ground, covered in blood.

“Ms. Harmon.” Although an assassin was used to seeing blood, he was still a little nervous.

Lucy’s eyes seemed to move, but she was not reacting to anything.

Kerby quickly checked Lucy’s body.

After making sure that all the bleeding was caused by her using sharp objects to scratch her body to suppress her inner desire and that her life was not in danger, he said, “I’ll carry you to the bed.”

Lucy did not resist.

At that moment, her body could not help but move closer to Kerby.

Kerby could also feel her eagerness, so he did not waste any more time in putting Lucy on the bed and pressing her down.

An assassin did not have much control over this aspect. Sometimes, it was so chaotic that it was hard to describe. Therefore, this kind of thing was easy for Kerby.

That was until Lucy kicked him off the bed with all her strength. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Kerby was caught off guard. After falling and rolling off the bed, he even felt that his ribs had been broken.

He clutched his stomach and forced himself to get up from the ground.

He did not understand why Lucy would push him away at that moment. How could she still have the strength to push him away?

Assassins had many tricks up their sleeves, and drugs were just one of them. They were very clear about the effects of each drug and what kind of reaction it would do to the body!

However, Lucy’s current behavior was not human at all!

Kerby could not help but say, “Ms. Harmon, if you don’t satisfy your desires tonight, I’m afraid you won’t be able to last until tomorrow.

“Leave.” Lucy was holding herself back, and her entire body was shaking madly.

She did not know how she managed to utter that word so clearly.

Her body had actually reached its limit, and it was out of her control.

“Don’t worry. It was the Eldest Young Lady who told me to help you solve it. She said she would bear the responsibility if anything happened and that it wouldn’t affect us–”

“Leave!” This time, Lucy cried out at the top of her lungs.

Her face was filled with horror and ferocity.

It made Kerby a little scared.

He thought that she needed it, but he did not expect her to not want it at all. Was he overthinking?

Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll wait for you outside the hotel. If you can’t hold on anymore, just open the door!”

Lucy did not say anything else. She just hugged her body tightly and dug her nails into her skin.

She did not dare to move. She was afraid that she would lose control of her body if she moved even a little.

Then, she would not care who solved her desires anymore, and she knew very well that if she did that, she would regret it.
