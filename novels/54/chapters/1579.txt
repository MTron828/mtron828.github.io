Chapter 1580: The Conflict Between Shelly and the Winters

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Ms. Sullivan, you were looking for me?” Shelly greeted Zoe politely and respectfully.

Zoe looked at Shelly coldly and confirmed that the woman was hypocritical and scheming. She said coldly, “Come with me!”

After saying that, she walked ahead arrogantly, and Shelly followed her to the backyard of the restaurant.

Once Zoe confirmed there was no one in the backyard, she turned to Shelly and asked, “Tell me, what’s your motive?”

She could not be bothered to talk nonsense with Shelly.

Shelly looked innocent as if she did not understand what Zoe was talking about. “I don’t know what you mean, Ms. Sullivan.”

“Shelly, stop pretending. I don’t buy it! Just tell me why you’ve been hiding by my side! I don’t have time to deal with you!” Zoe said coldly.

Shelly stayed silent. After all, she really had no ulterior motives. It was all a coincidence, but it was obvious no one would believe her. Nox would not believe her, and Zoe naturally would not believe her.

With that, she said, “I want money.”

The only way to avoid trouble was to take the money and leave.

Zoe’s expression changed. She probably did not expect Shelly to admit it directly. Perhaps she did not expect Shelly’s request to be so simple. It was so simple that she found it unbelievable.

“How much do you want?” Zoe asked coldly after recovering from a moment of shock.

“How much do you think is appropriate?” Shelly asked.

She wondered where Zoe’s limits lay. For example, Nox was stingy with her. He would hesitate for a long time even if he gave her a few hundred thousand dollars.

Would Zoe do the same? After all, birds of a feather flocked together.

“Are you messing with me?” Zoe had no patience for Shelly.

She was certain that Shelly would not be so easily dismissed. Therefore, she did not believe that Shelly was only after money.

Shelly was starting to feel helpless. “I’m very short of money. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be working as a waitress.”

“Stop pretending in front of me, Shelly! You became a waitress to ambush me and catch me red-handed!”

Shelly did not know how to refute Zoe. Was such an arrogant and self-righteous personality contagious?

She said, “I’m really not. I’m just doing it for a living.”

“For a living? In that case, shouldn’t you return to the Winters? Mr. and Mrs. Winter would never let you be a waitress!” Zoe was certain about that fact.

Shelly looked at her and thought what she said made sense.

“Tell me, what do you want?” Zoe was on the verge of a breakdown, and she could not hide her emotions anymore.

In fact, Zoe’s reaction was understandable. Who would have thought that Nox’s ex-companion would see her shameful side?

If Shelly told Nox, her marriage with Nox would be over. When she thought of that possibility, she became even more uneasy.

“Shelly, what do you want? Let me tell you, don’t even think about breaking Nox and me up! Nox and I have been together for three years, and we have a great relationship. Don’t even think about breaking us up!” Zoe was furious.

She was probably still too flustered to remain calm.

“I beg you to please stay together,” Shelly said seriously She really wanted them to be together because she could not wait for Zoe to cuckold Nox for the rest of his life. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Shelly, stop being so sarcastic!” Zoe refused to believe anything Shelly said.

She said bluntly, “I know it’s impossible between Nox and me. If it were, Nox wouldn’t have kicked me out. I don’t care if you believe me or not, but I’m only a waitress to earn a living. I really don’t have any feelings for Nox. I wouldn’t have waited so long to expose you if I did.”

Zoe’s expression darkened. It turned out Shelly knew everything about her.

“Of course, I understand that, from your point of view, you can’t trust me. So, why don’t you give me a sum of money to shut me up?”

“How can I guarantee that you won’t say anything to Nox if I give you the money?”

“By making me write an agreement letter?” Shelly asked.

Zoe stared at Shelly.

“Otherwise, what other ideas do you have?” Shelly could not think of anything, so she asked Zoe instead.

Zoe thought for a moment before saying bluntly, “Take my money and leave South Hampton City!”

“That won’t do.” Shelly rejected him directly.

“Shelly!”

“My daughter is about to undergo surgery. I’ve contacted the doctors in South

Hampton City, and they’ve prepared everything. I can’t leave at this time..”
