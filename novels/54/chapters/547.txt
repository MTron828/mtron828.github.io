Ruby also gave Gary a look before she turned to Monica. “Monica, come upstairs with me. Let’s talk it out.”

Monica wiped her tears and nodded.

With that, Ruby brought Monica upstairs to her room, and Sarah quickly followed.

In the room, Ruby appeared to be much gentler.

She had a good personality, considering that Monica had been in countless troubles since she was young, but Ruby had never hit or scolded her before.

She said, “Monica, have you really thought about it?”

“Mom, I admit that I’m a little impulsive for not considering everything and asking your opinions before deciding to do this, but I really can’t leave Michael be. Even if you stop me, or even if I have no friends, I’ll follow through with my decision,” Monica said with certainty.

“Since that’s the case, I won’t say anything else.” Ruby still, more or less, pampered Monica. After all, Monica was her one and only precious daughter. If she did not pamper Monica, who would? Even so, she had to explain things clearly to Monica. “However, I have to tell you the price for doing this is that you might lose Finn completely. It won’t be a fake divorce but a real one.”

Tears welled up in Monica’s eyes again.

“Your father and I have watched Finn grow up, so we know what kind of person he is. He is kind-hearted and knows how to repay others’ kindness, but he’s definitely not one to accept whatever comes his way. He has his bottom line and his principles. He will not wait for you. Today, your father and I took turns calling Finn, but he either chose not to answer or switched off his phone. This isn’t him losing his temper. He’s just using his actions to tell us that for him, this marriage has ended.”

As Monica’s tears continued to fall, she said, “After everything is over, I’ll go back to pursuing Finn. If he could agree to marry me three years ago when I was still in love with Michael, he’ll understand what I’m doing and will agree to it a year later.”

“Not necessarily.” Ruby rained on her parade. “Three years ago, Finn married you because he loved you very much. But after a year, after his love for you has died out, he won’t agree to it anymore. In fact, your father and I forced you to marry Finn back then because Finn admitted to us that he still liked you. Otherwise, do you think your father and I would arrange your marriage so casually?”

Monica bit her lips.

She had always thought that Finn was just repaying their kindness.

“Monica, you should understand the price you have to pay. If you think it’s all worth it, your father and I have nothing to say. But if you think it’s not worth it, I advise you to pull out while you still can. If you want to make up now, it’s still not too late.”

“No. I’ve already thought it through. Even if I can’t get back together with Finn, I won’t ignore Michael now.” Monica was very sure of her decision.

In that case, Ruby sighed as she had nothing else to say. “Since that is your decision, we’ll leave it at that. You can leave once you go down, and I’ll explain it to your father.”

“Mom, thank you.” Monica’s tears turned into a smile. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, Ruby could not smile no matter how hard she tried because she had a feeling that Monica would definitely regret it.

She said, “Let’s go downstairs.”

Monica followed Ruby down to the living room, where Ruby gave Monica a look.

“Dad, I’ll head off now. Take care of yourself.”

Gary was so angry that his eyes were bulging.

At that moment, Ruby walked over. “I told Monica to leave. Since you’re angry, I don’t think it’s the right time for you to talk about things. Let’s wait until your anger has subsided.”

Gary, however, did not agree with her.

Ruby held Gary’s hand and whispered into his ear, “Your daughter is not in a good place right now, so don’t push her too far.”

Gary took a deep breath and stared coldly into Monica’s eyes as he said, “Let’s go to the hospital tomorrow for a check-up and see if you can give birth to another child.”

“...”

Monica left in a huff.

Sometimes, Ruby really found the father and daughter childish.

Seeing Monica leave, Sarah chased after her.

“Monica.”

Monica’s footsteps halted.

Sarah said, “Did you really divorce Finn?”

“Why are you asking this?” Monica was not in a good mood.

“I’m just asking if you guys are divorced.” Sarah was persistent for an answer.

“So what if we are and what if we’re not? You should be more concerned about your college entrance exams. Why do you care so much?” Monica said in a harsh tone.
