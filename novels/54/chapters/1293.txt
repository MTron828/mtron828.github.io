1294 Edward and Candice’s First Date

“Be careful on the road.” Claire did not say much. She only reminded Candice, “When you interact with the leader, mind your manners.”

“Okay,” Candice agreed and left.

After Candice left, Chloe did not hide the displeasure on her face. She held her mother’s hand and complained, “Mom, Dad is too biased. He left all the good things to Candice. I haven’t received any love from him since I was young. Didn’t I accompany Candice for all these years when she was treating her illness overseas? Now that Candice is awake, he has placed all his attention on her. Am I adopted or what?”

“Alright, alright. Don’t you still have Mom to dote on you?” Claire comforted her.

“But all the benefits in the family are taken by Candice.” Chloe was obviously unhappy. “It’s the same now that she’s married. She’s clearly slept for so many years and has been out of touch with society for so long. When she opened her eyes, she could still marry the Chief. Mom, her life is too good!”

“Do you think it’ll be fine if you marry the Chief?! Don’t you know that accompanying a ruler is like accompanying a tiger? Once you marry the Chief, your actions will always be monitored. You won’t even have any freedom. Do you really think it’s a good marriage?!”

“I don’t care. In any case, I think Candice took all the benefits. If she hadn’t suddenly woken up, I would have been the one to marry him instead! She was the one who stole my happiness!” Chloe argued.

Moreover, she had actually done everything to marry the Chief.

Back then, when she heard her father say that the Chief wanted to marry his daughter because he was afraid of his power, Chloe had always thought that she would be the one.

It never occurred to her that it would be Candice who had just woken up.

She actually had a good impression of the Chief.

Previously, she had seen him on television. Later on, the Chief personally visited their home to look for his father. She was lucky enough to see him in person. The moment she saw him, she was really attracted to him. It turned out that love, at first sight, was really so simple. For many days after, her mind was filled with him, and she could not forget him.

She had been waiting for her father to tell her that she was going to marry the Chief, but in the end, it turned out to be Candice.

God knew how difficult it was for her to accept this news.

God knew that she had the urge to kill Candice and let her steal her man.

“Chloe, calm down,” Claire called out to her. “Yes, the Chief’s indeed perfect. Not to mention you, if I were a few years younger, I would also be tempted. But you can’t look at the surface. Think carefully about the Chief’s ex-wives. Think about it carefully. How did he get to his current position?! Haven’t you heard some gossip that he stepped on women to get to his position? He doesn’t care about women at all. Now that he’s married your sister, it’s also because of your father. Do you really think they have any feelings for each other?! If I really let you marry the Chief, I won’t be happy.”

“I believe I can change him.” Chloe had heard a lot about the Chief, so even though he was handsome on television, she did not have any feelings for him. However, after seeing him with her own eyes and fulfilling all her fantasies about men, she could not stop herself.

No matter how cruel he was, she liked him.

“You’re just too young.” Claire was a little disappointed.

At this moment, Lillian could not help but interrupt, “Claire, it’s useless no matter what you say to Chloe now. She’s trapped now and can’t understand. When Candice marries the Chief, she’ll find out if it’s good or not.”

Claire nodded and said to her daughter, “Just wait and see.”

Chloe did not seem to believe it.

However, she was still very indignant.

…

Candice arrived at Chez Jeanne in her private car. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It was said to be a very famous local restaurant in South Hampton.

She had always thought that a date with the Chief should be in a restaurant more upscale than this and did not expect this to be the chosen place. Not to mention that this place was not great, the price point was rather high still. It was also too homely, giving the impression that it did not match the status of the Chief.

She was led by the staff to the private room.

The private room was above the moat. The afterglow of the setting sun was reflected in the clear moat water.

She sat obediently in the private room and waited, with no idea how long she would have to wait. She dared not ask either. After all, if she did ask, that could show she was rushing him. The Chief is a busy man, day in and day out. She would not have the guts to make him leave important state affairs for her.

Her wait persisted from evening till night.

It was a beautiful sight when the neon lights in South Hampton were shining on the moat.

“Ms. Nicholson, the Chief said he’ll be here in ten minutes.” The man who brought her here said respectfully.

“Alright.” Candice smiled, indifferently.

She had actually thought it through. Since she was going to marry the Chief, she would listen to his arrangements in the future.

Right then, the waiters finally began to serve a table full of dishes.

The door of the private room was opened again. Candice turned to look at the scene outside and knew that it was Edward.

She rose quickly from her seat, looking very self-conscious.

The moment Edward walked in, he saw Candice standing there respectfully.

He gulped.

He walked straight to her side and naturally took her hand.

Candice was stunned. She did not expect Edward to be so… unrestrained.

She had a feeling that they might not have had any intimate contact before they got married.

She felt that he was actually a little cold.

Naturally, she did not dare to refuse. So just like that, Edward pulled her to sit down.

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” Edward said, feeling a little guilty.

“It’s nothing. I have nothing to do anyway.” Candice smiled.

“Let’s eat,” Edward called.

“Okay.”

Edward let go of her hand.

There seemed to be reluctance, but it also seemed to be just her imagination.

Candice had a feeling that Edward had a special feeling for her.

Could they have had a history between them?!

She had no idea. Candice did not want to think too much about it.

...

Even now, he seemed to be more indifferent to everything.

It was the feeling of someone who had experienced life and death and had seen through the mortal world.

The two of them ate dinner in silence. No one spoke.

“Is it to your liking?” Edward took the initiative to change the topic.

“I like the local cuisine very much,” Candice replied.

“That’s good,” Edward said, really gently.

He picked up a piece of steak and placed it on Candice’s plate.

Candice was stunned and quickly said, “Thank you.”

Then, she ate the steak and it tasted really good.

Meanwhile, she could feel Edward’s gaze on her as she chewed.

She felt a little uncomfortable.

...

Suddenly, Edward suddenly reached out and approached her lips.

She winced.

“Don’t move. There’s sauce at the corner of your mouth,” Edward said.

Candice did not move at all, but still felt a little nervous for some reason.

She nervously watched Edward approach.

And then…

His lips moved closer…
