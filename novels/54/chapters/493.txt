Chapter 494: Jasmine’s Tragic Downfall

All he cared about was that Jeanne had trampled on his male dignity today.

“Eden.” Jasmine propped herself up from the ground and crawled under Eden’s feet. “Please believe me, okay? I beg you to believe me. I love you. I’ve loved you since I was young. I really, really love you very much. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have put in so much effort to sleep with you back then–”

“What did you say?” Eden looked at Jasmine coldly.

Jasmine was stunned. Out of anxiousness, she had just blurted out what had happened all those years ago.

The pitiful and weak expression on her face turned into fear again as she looked straight at Eden.

Suddenly, she saw Eden squat down and pinch Jasmine’s face hard. “All those years ago, you set me up?”

“No, no, no. It was an accident. It was really an accident...” Jasmine denied.

“B*tch!” Eden slapped Jasmine’s face hard.

Jasmine was hit so hard that his vision went black.

“That year, if it wasn’t for you, would I have broken up with Jeanne? Would I have lost Jeanne because of you? Jasmine, you b*tch. You set me up that year. You set me up!” Eden’s expression was scary.

Jasmine also knew he could not refute her, so she kept saying, “That’s because I love you. I love you very much. That’s why I’m like this. That’s why–”

“Enough!” Eden did not want to hear another word from Jasmine. “I don’t even care that you love me! Your love will only make me feel dirty and disgusted! Now that I think about it, if it weren’t for you back then, I wouldn’t have ended up in this state with Jeanne–”

“Are you blaming me now?” Jasmine went crazy. In fact, she also knew that no matter how she begged for mercy, the man would not let her off. She said fiercely, “If you could’ve controlled yourself back then, would you have had to sleep with me even if I had plotted against you? Or can’t you control yourself? Can’t you control your lower body?”

......

“Jasmine!” Her words enraged Eden even more.

“Don’t think I don’t know that in the seven years we dated, you cheated on me too. I just didn’t want to expose you. All I wanted was to maintain our relationship! Eden, don’t you know what kind of person you are? Even if I didn’t plot against you, even if you were with Jeanne back then, wouldn’t you have cheated? Wouldn’t you still be the same? Anyway, Jeanne wouldn’t have stayed with you...”

“Bam!” Eden slapped Jasmine’s face again.

As if she did not feel the pain, Jasmine roared fiercely, “What kind of person I am is what kind of person you are! Look at your Fourth Uncle, Fourth Master Swan. After so many years, has any woman been able to get close to him? No wonder Jeanne fell in love with Fourth Master Swan. No wonder she doesn’t even look at you now! Can’t you see? Can you compare yourself to Fourth Master Swan? Can you compare to— Ah...”

Jasmine screamed.

At that moment, Eden was grabbing her hair so hard that her scalp felt like it was going to fall off. Then, he even hit her head hard on the floor.

Her head banged against the floor repeatedly.

Jasmine was already prepared to be beaten to death by Eden.

She was resentful of how her life turned out! She hated everyone in this world, including Alexander, Jenifer, Jeanne, and Eden!

There was a ferocious look on her face, and just when she thought she would die in the next second, Eden suddenly let go because Henry pushed Eden away.

Angry, Henry scolded, “Do you really want to kill her? If you kill her, can you bear the legal responsibility? Calm down!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Eden’s expression was extremely ferocious, and his eyes were bloodshot.

All he wanted to do was kill Jasmine.

“Keeping her alive is worse than killing!” Henry said sinisterly.

Eden was still fuming with anger.

“To talk business and make a deal, you need a woman in many ways. Isn’t she cheating on you? Just let her do it!” Henry said cruelly.

Eden turned to look at his father and said, “I want a divorce with that b*tch, Jasmine!”

“Are you crazy?” Henry refused immediately.

Eden glared at Henry.

“Divorce? What reason do you use to get a divorce? If word gets out that you’ve been cuckolded, can you live with yourself?” Henry asked him coldly.
