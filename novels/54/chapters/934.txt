935 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

“I know you can’t live without me…”

The old man and old lady suddenly became corny.

How could they be so shameless in front of their daughter and niece?

Monica could not help but interrupt them, “Mom, come out for a moment. I’ll go through the things that Finn told me to take note of again.”

Ruby quickly let go of Gary’s hand. “Take a nap and don’t think about anything.”

“Alright.” Gary nodded and smiled sweetly.

Ruby and Monica were on the balcony outside the VIP ward. Monica said, “Mom, I won’t hide it from you. Finn said that dad’s current situation isn’t as optimistic as we thought. He’s currently in recovery, but if his recovery doesn’t go well, he might have to undergo a heart transplant.”

Ruby was shocked to hear that and could not say a word for a long time.

“Don’t be afraid. I believe my father will be fine. God won’t be so cruel to him.” Monica quickly held her mother’s hand.

Ruby’s eyes were red, and she could not hide her pain.

“The most important thing now is for us not to help with dad’s recovery and not have a mental breakdown.” Monica comforted her, “During this time, I will need you to accompany dad, take care of him, and encourage him. If he really needs a heart transplant, we have to believe in the current medical standards.”

Ruby could only nod. “I didn’t expect your father’s health to be so bad. He rarely shows it in front of me. Whenever his heart hurts, he would always get Finn to come over and take a look at him. I thought he had already recovered…”

“This isn’t your fault. It’s just that dad loves you too much and can’t bear for you to worry and be sad for him.” Monica said, “I told you so much to let you know that, on one hand, we really can’t take his health lightly, and on the other, I plan to go to the company to work.”

“You’re going to work at the company?” Ruby looked surprised.

“If not… are you going to let dad go?” Monica raised her eyebrows.

“But can you do it?”

“Even if it doesn’t work, we have to give it a try.” Monica said, “The Cardellinis’ pharmaceutical company has been passed down generations. Do you think that dad can’t let go because of the money? No. What he can’t accept is the fact that this business that has been passed down for generations will be destroyed in his hands. If it really is destroyed, he will have to die to atone for his sins.”

“I know, but you haven’t been to work much. How are you going to deal with those cunning businessmen in the company?”

How could you say that your own employees are cunning?!” Monica could not help but laugh.

“Businessmen are cunning, to begin with.”

“Isn’t dad a businessman too?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Your dad is different.”

“That’s why I believe that the people around him will be different.” Monica said with certainty, “Mom, what I mean now is that I’ll take dad’s place to work at the company and you’ll devote yourself to take care of his health. If I really can’t manage our company well, we’ll have a clear conscience when something really happens. At least we’ve tried our best. But if we let the company collapse, we won’t be able to answer to him.”

“I’m just afraid that it’ll be hard on you.” Ruby said with her heart aching.

“You’ve protected me well enough, and I can’t rely on you for the rest of my life. If you die one day–”

“Monica, are you itching for a beating?” Ruby was angry.

In fact, Monica did it on purpose because she did not want her happy family to be depressed.

She said, “I have to learn how to live alone somehow. Unless you want me to die earlier than you.”

“You, child!”

“I’ll leave dad to you. I’ll make sure to visit often,” Monica said solemnly.

Ruby looked at Monica with her heart still aching. “Monica, if you can’t deal with it, don’t make things difficult for yourself. If our family can afford to enjoy a rich and noble life, we can also accept a poor life.

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

She was really touched by her mother’s magnanimity.

Even though she had made up her mind to work for her father’s company, she did not think that she could turn things around.

She just… wanted to make herself look less useless!

With that, Monica left the hospital.

However, she did not go straight to the company as she thought that she had to be in her best state.
