915 Have You Really Let Go of Finn?

In the car.

George held Edward’s hand, obviously trying to help him out. Edward looked at George and smiled. He said, “I’m not going to die.”

“You always get hurt, though.” George’s round eyes looked straight at Edward.

Edward was speechless.

“It seems I’m asking too much of you to take care of yourself,” George muttered.

“...It’s not serious this time.” Edward could only reluctantly explain.

George blinked his eyes in disbelief.

“I can be witness to that,” Finn said. Nox, who was watching the commotion, came over and helped Edward. “It’s really not that serious this time.”

George turned to look at Finn.

Nox also deliberately said, “Even if your dad is dying, I’ll take care of you. So don’t be afraid that no one will want you.” He knew that his father would not take care of him.

Edward glared at Nox. He promised George, “I’ll definitely do what I promised you.”

George nodded, choosing to believe his words.

Edward stroked George’s head and did not say much. He would try his best to give him a complete family. He had promised George that he would not only take care of himself but also bring Jeanne back!

Nox helped Edward back to his bed before Finn removed the bullet in Edward, with George accompanying him. It was clearly a bloody scene, but George was not afraid. He stared straight and watched Finn’s operation very carefully.

“Aren’t you afraid?” Nox could not help but ask George.

George turned to look at him. “Why should I be?”

“Shouldn’t a child be afraid of a bloody mess?”

“No,” George replied.”I see it often in Delta Island.”

Nox was speechless. Just what kind of environment did George grow up in?

He was clearly weak and had obviously not been trained. Naturally, it made him think that Jeanne had protected him since he was young. As expected, Jeanne really was unpredictable. Was she not afraid that her son would go astray?

Finn’s surgeries usually went quickly and successfully. He removed the bullets and bandaged Edward’s wound. Then, He treated the minor burns on his body and put him on an anti-inflammatory drip. After that, he packed his surgery bag.

“You should recover in about a week,” Finn said. “It should be peaceful this week too.”

Edward nodded. “The Sanders didn’t get anything useful. Coupled with the fact that they have to appease the people with this incident. They won’t act rashly for a while.”

“I hope we can end this quickly,” Nox said. “My heart itches.”

“It won’t be long now,” Edward said bluntly. “Once the Sanders know of this person’s existence, they will not delay.”

The room suddenly fell silent. It was always quiet before the storm. They had been training since young for this moment! Therefore, there were still some feelings overflowing…

“Finn.” Nox changed the topic, “Aren’t you going to treat your wounds?”

Finn lowered his head and looked at himself. He did not feel any pain, which made him unaware of where he was injured.

“Your back and arms are burnt quite badly,” Nox reminded him.

Finn responded indifferently, “Okay.”

“Do you need my help?” Nox asked.

“No need. You stay here with Fourth Master. I’ll go back to the hospital to deal with it,” Finn said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Nox still wanted to say something, but he held his tongue.

Finn reminded him, “The worst thing to fear every time after an injury is an infection. Nox, help me keep an eye on Fourth Master for any signs of a fever. If he does, let me know immediately. I’m leaving and will only be back later.”

“Go ahead. I’ll accompany Fourth Master Swan,” Nox said.

Finn informed Edward and left Bamboo Garden.

Nox looked at Finn’s back and said, ” I bet Finn went to see Monica.”

Edward glanced at Nox.

Nox laughed, looking very proud of himself. “I can’t help it. I’m just that fiery.”

“…”

Finn drove away from Bamboo Garden. When he returned to the hospital, he went straight to the burn department. There were many patients. As most of the injured at the banquet had been sent here, the VIP ward was at full capacity. So Finn casually went to a general clinic to treat the burns on his body.
