Chapter 1527: Edward, I’m Back

Kingsley and Lucy’s wedding was held when their son was two years old.

Lucy had never thought that there would be a wedding, for she did not care too much about those things. As long as the two of them could be together and loved each other, she was content. There was no need for so many fancy ceremonies.

However, Kingsley said that life needed a sense of ceremony. She really wanted to ask him why he had never held a ceremony for someone he killed because she could not understand him.

For assassins like them, nothing else mattered as long as they were alive. However, she could not dissuade Kingsley. Although he usually listened to her, there were some things he was stubborn about.

Anyway, they had a wedding — a grand wedding, and many people came. Kingsley had invited everyone in the industry. The manor on the Delta Islands was pretty lively.

Lucy put on the wedding dress and saw herself in the mirror, looking completely different from before.

Most assassins were orphans who had been abandoned. Therefore, no one loved them, and they lived for the sake of living. Yet now, everything had changed. The woman in the mirror no longer had sharp eyes and a cold expression.

“You look very beautiful.” As the bridesmaid, Jeanne stayed by Lucy’s side. Lucy’s eyes flickered, and she looked at Jeanne through the mirror.

She said, “It feels so surreal.”

Jeanne understood how Lucy felt. After all, there was no way for an assassin to live a normal life.

She said, “I don’t know why, but I want to thank you.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Huh?” Lucy was surprised.

“I think you warmed Kingsley’s heart and made him a normal man,” Jeanne said sincerely.

Kingsley’s life was not initially like that, and it was Lucy who changed him.

Even so, Lucy still did not understand how Kingsley fell in love with her. It all happened so abruptly, but his love for her knew no bounds.

“Anyway, congratulations.” Jeanne smiled.

On that joyous day, she had to give her blessings, and there was no need to dwell too much in the past.

Lucy smiled and felt relieved. After all, assassins always enjoyed themselves because no one knew if they would be alive in the next second.

The wedding ceremony started at 12 p.m. sharp. Lucy was wearing a long wedding dress, looking as beautiful as a painting, with Jeanne accompanying her on the long red carpet. At the end of the red carpet was Kingsley, who stood there in a suit and leather shoes, waiting for Lucy.

He looked at her smiling face and alluring figure. The smile on his lips was so big that it surprised everyone who attended the wedding. They had mostly only seen Kingsley’s cold and heartless appearance and had never thought he would become so gentle one day.

As Lucy walked up to Kingsley, the two of them looked at each other. Kingsley suddenly stretched his hand out, and Lucy placed her small hand on his palm.

Lucy had to tell herself that it was not an illusion. She thought she vaguely saw a tear in Kingsley’s eyes, but she could be wrong. For some reason, she suddenly felt something tug in her heart. It was as if they had paid a huge price in exchange for the love they had now.

The wedding ceremony was a traditional one, where they swore an oath and exchanged rings. Then, Kingsley kissed her deeply in front of everyone.

For the first time, she felt that his kiss was just filled with affection and warmth, without any lust.

Lucy looked at Kingsley and wondered what exactly had they gone through in their previous lives to make him feel so sorry for her.

Kingsley’s lips left Lucy’s reluctantly, and he looked at her deep in the eyes. Even though there were many people watching the ceremony, at that moment, it was as if only the two of them were there.

Lucy said, “Kingsley, I don’t know what happened between us in our previous life, how deeply you hurt me or how desperate I was for you. But in this life, I want to tell you that I love you, and I will always love you.”

Kingsley smiled with tears in his eyes. To think such a powerful man was so touched by her words that tears welled up in his eyes!

He had never felt so thankful about anything since he was young. He was thankful that the heavens had given him a chance to be reborn and to have a chance to love her properly, with all he had.

He said, “Lucy, in this life, you’re the only person I’ll ever love..”
