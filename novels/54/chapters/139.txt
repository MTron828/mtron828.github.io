Chapter 140: Finn Personally Examined Monica

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay.”

Jeanne hung up the phone, still feeling a little uneasy.

She thought for a moment and made a call.

The call went through. “Ms. Lawrence.”

“Dr. Jones, do you know that Monica is having a breast examination at the hospital?”

Finn was sitting in his office sorting out some of his medical advice materials. When he heard what Jeanne said, his hands paused and he replied, “I didn’t know.”

“She’s doing a checkup by herself right now. I can’t leave since I have something to do. I’m worried that if something happens, that silly girl will be alone...”

“It should be fine,” Finn said straightforwardly. “It’s just normal hyperplasia of the mammary glands. Just follow the doctor’s instructions and prevent it from happening.”

“Are you sure?” Jeanne asked.

Finn pursed his lips.

“If you’re not sure, I hope you can go and take a look.”

Finn replied, “Okay.”

“Thank you.”

Jeanne actually knew that there was some conflict between Finn and Monica. She was not trying to set them up, but she really felt that Monica and Micheal were not suitable for each other. Micheal... placed himself in the Sanders’ political arena, and his family was in a high position. Micheal was definitely not a simple man.

Monica would be more suitable for a simpler environment.

Even so...

When it comes to matters of the heart, it is never up to others.

Therefore, the biggest reason she asked Finn to visit Monica was that she was really a little worried about that woman.

Monica looked carefree and heartless, but if something really happened, she might choose to bear it herself.

“Director Lawrence.” Amy knocked on the door and entered.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

“The General Manager wants you to go to the meeting now.”

Jeanne’s eyes twitched, and her face was a little cold.

Alexander really only knew how to drag her down.

…

The hospital.

The Breast Department.

Monica put down the phone.

At that moment, the hospital staff came forward respectfully. “Ms.Cardellini, it’s your turn to have your checkup.”

Monica nodded and followed the medical staff to the doctor’s clinic.

She actually did not want to come today.

She was young, so how could she have cancer? However, who knew that she would be so bothered when she went to work today? Finn’s words kept lingering in her ears. She would think of it no matter what she did. Even when she looked at Jeanne’s news, Finn’s voice would also appear.

What if, what if… FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

People would always be afraid of what-ifs.

She was the same.

So in the end, she still came to the hospital alone.

Since she did not make an appointment in advance, she waited in the hospital for a while.

At this moment, she walked into the doctor’s office.

She was inexplicably... very nervous.

The doctor was a female doctor in her forties. Her attitude was very friendly. After all, she used the VIP channel, so the fees were naturally much more expensive than normal outpatient clinics.

She sat in front of the doctor.

The doctor asked about her condition.

Monica answered them one by one.

After the doctor recorded her answer, she said, “Ms. Cardellini, lie on the bed. I’ll help you check.”

“Okay.”

Monica lay on the examination bed behind the doctor’s outpatient clinic.

She laid down, lifted her shirt, and undid her bra.

The doctor did the examination for a while.

Monica felt a little awkward and nervous.

After all, she was still a virgin. Although she was a female doctor, she still felt a little embarrassed to be examined like this.

What made her nervous was... she would not really be sick, right?

She looked at the doctor’s serious expression.

After a long while.

The doctor finished the examination and let her get up from the bed.

“How is it?” Monica asked.

Her heart was racing.

“It should not be a big problem. But for the sake of being conservative, I suggest that we go for a doppler ultrasound and see how the breast hyperplasia is,” the doctor suggested.

“Okay.”

“I’ll get the nurse to take you for a doppler ultrasound.”

“Okay.”

Monica followed the nurse out.

She was still a little nervous.

She had just left when Finn walked into the doctor’s office.

Monica did not see Finn, even though Finn had seen her leave.

“How is Monica?” Finn asked.

“Dr. Jones?” The breast doctor was surprised. Why did he suddenly ask her about the patient’s condition?

The other nurse next to the breast doctor quickly said, “Ms. Cardellini is Dr.Jones’ wife.”

Finn pursed his lips.

Monica would occasionally accompany her father for a physical examination, so everyone in the cardiology department knew about Monica. It was normal for the news to spread naturally.

After all, being a doctor was still an ordinary profession. The Cardellinis were one of the top five companies among the twelve families in South Hampton City. Since Finn married a Cardellini, it was natural for people to gossip about them.
