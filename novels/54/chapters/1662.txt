Chapter 1663: Utterly Despicable

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Not to mention a year, he did not even want to be apart from her for a day.

“Yes, I can’t bear for you to leave.” Shelly nodded. “But for the sake of a better life, I think a year’s wait will be worth it.”

Benjamin could not refute. He knew it would be better if he could go abroad, but Shelly’s persuasion still made him a little emotional.

Although he knew that Shelly was just being rational and not that she did not like him, he still hoped that Shelly would be like a woman who needed him and wanted him to stay!

“Benjamin, we’re young, and we will still be young after a year.” Shelly said seriously, “I’ll wait for you to come back!”

In the end, Benjamin gave in because he could not reject Shelly. Even though he hated Shelly’s rationality, he knew that Shelly had chosen the best path for them.

He said heavily, “Alright, I’ll agree to study abroad.”

Upon hearing Benjamin’s words, Shelly was still a little sad. After all, one year was neither long nor short, and nobody would want to be away from the person they loved. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After reaching a consensus, the two of them looked at each other deeply. Then, Benjamin cupped Shelly’s cheeks, and Shelly closed her eyes.

It was not unusual for couples to be intimate with each other, especially since they were about to part, and their feelings for each other would be more intense. If the phone did not ring at that moment, perhaps… it would have happened.

Benjamin quickly picked up the phone. He was also shocked by his eagerness just now. It was actually much more nerve-wracking for a man’s first time than a woman’s.

He took a deep breath and answered the call. “Mom.”

Shelly tugged at her clothes and sat up straight, feeling a little awkward.

“Where are you? The school just called me again. You’re leaving the day after tomorrow. If you don’t go to the school to settle the relevant procedures now, it’ll be too late.”

“I understand.”

“What do you know? Did you get stopped by that vixen Shelly again?” Mrs. Bacon was cursing on the other end of the phone.

The soundproofing of the phone was not very good, so Shelly could hear Mrs. Bacon’s voice.

Benjamin took his phone and walked to the side. “Mom, that’s enough. If you keep talking like that, I’m going to get angry.”

“I don’t care. Just go to the school right now and settle the procedures. You’re going with your dad. If you don’t go, I’ll go straight to Shelly directly!” Mrs. Bacon said fiercely.

Benjamin gritted his teeth and hung up the phone. He tried hard to compose himself, and it took him a long time before he walked up to Shelly.

At that moment, Shelly was not as affectionate as she was before and was no different from her usual self.

“I have to go back to school first,” Benjamin said.

“Alright.” Shelly nodded.

“I’ll be back after I’m done with the procedures.” “Alright, I’ll wait for you.” Shelly smiled.

She would not make things difficult for Benjamin.

Benjamin looked straight into Shelly’s eyes, clearly reluctant to part with her. Then, Shelly said, “Before you go abroad, we should do it.”

Benjamin was stunned, and his face was a little red. Of course, he knew what Shelly meant by that! If not for his mother’s phone call just now, they might have…

Benjamin replied,” Okay.”

“Hurry up and go. The sooner you finish, the sooner you’ll come back,” Shelly urged.

Benjamin nodded. With that, he left Shelly’s house.

Shelly sighed heavily, still a little disappointed. She did not expect there to be so many obstacles in her relationship with Benjamin. She had always thought that when ordinary people fall in love, nothing much would happen.

Nox naturally heard about Benjamin agreeing to study abroad.

The other party reported, “He has signed the procedures with the school today, and his flight will leave South Hampton City at 8 a.m. the day after tomorrow.”

“Alright,” Nox replied, not showing how excited he was deep down.

“However…” The other party wanted to say something but hesitated. “What’s wrong?” Nox frowned, obviously afraid that something bad would happen.

“Shelly and Benjamin didn’t break up,” the other party said bluntly.

“What?!” Nox was furious.

“Even if you send him abroad, it doesn’t mean that the two of them will break up. In this world, there’s a type of relationship called a long-distance relationship,” the other party said while trembling.

“F*ck! That was not what you said to me back then!” Nox was about to go mad..
