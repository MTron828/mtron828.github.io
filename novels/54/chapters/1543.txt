Chapter 1544: Jeanne Tells Monica Her Identity

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At 6 p.m., Jeanne was waiting for Monica in the private room. There was no doubt that Monica would come, and as expected, the door was pushed open at 6:30 p.m.

Monica walked in and said bluntly, “I came mainly for the food. That’s all.”

Jeanne could not help but laugh. Then, she said, “I’ve ordered your favorite dishes.”

“How do you know what my favorite dishes are?” Monica sat beside Jeanne, her face full of disbelief.

“I also know you have a mole on your inner thigh.”

“Candice, do you like peeking at people in the shower?”

“When do you think I’ve had the chance to peek at you in the shower?”Jeanne asked.

Monica frowned and thought so too. After knowing Candice for so long, she had never had the chance to see each other in the shower.

As such, she said, “Did Finn tell you?”

However, she did not think Finn would be so gossipy.

“I’m-

Jeanne was about to speak when there was a knock on the door. The two of them turned around to take a look.

“I’m here to serve the dishes.” The waitress was respectful.

“Shelly?” Jeanne looked at the waiter in surprise.

After all, the person in front of her did not look exactly like Shelly. She was much prettier, but her appearance seemed to be Shelly.

“Hello, Madam.” Shelly quickly bowed respectfully.

Shelly was also surprised that Candice recognized her. Could Monica have told her?

“You know Shelly?” Monica immediately broke Shelly’s conjecture and expressed her surprise.

Logically speaking, Nox and Shelly broke up a long time before Candice and

Edward got together, so there was no way Candice knew Shelly through Nox.

Could it be that, in order to be with Edward, Candice had investigated all of his friends? To think Candice knew someone like Shelly, who did not have much of a relationship with her.

Monica realized that Candice was indeed not a simple woman. No wonder she was no match for Candice, who had her wrapped around her finger. “By the way, how many jobs do you have?” When Monica saw Shelly, she was also surprised.

She had seen Shelly working as a waitress in another restaurant, and here the latter was again.

“No, I only have this one now,” Shelly answered as she served the dishes.

She did not reveal that she was working in another restaurant now because she did not want to see Nox. However, it seemed like no matter where she went she would bump into someone she knew.

She could not help but lament how small South Hampton City was.

“Where’s your daughter?” Monica asked.

What would happen to Shelly’s daughter if Shelly had to work all day?

“You have a daughter?” Jeanne was a little surprised.

“Yes, I do. She’s three years old.” Shelly replied, “I’m working a later shift today, but I usually work until 8 p.m. Then, I’ll pick her up.”

“Isn’t it hard to take care of the child alone?” Monica was a little curious.

After all, she would also have to take on the role of a single mother. However, she had her parents and a wealthy family to support her. Even if she was a single mother, she still had a group of people to help her, unlike Shelly, who seemed to be alone.

If not for the fact that Shelly was poor, she would not have to live in Sarah’s apartment.

“It’s alright. I’m used to it.” Shelly smiled.

“How old are you again?” Monica could not help but ask.

In her memory, Shelly was young. Yet, she was already a mother and was even taking care of her child alone. It made Monica pity Shelly a little. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“22 years old.”

“Yes, you’re the same age as Sarah, who is still relying on her parents, but you’re already earning money to support your family.”

“Everyone’s family background is different. If I were born into a family like Sarah’s, I could be like that too,” Shelly said calmly.

She did not complain about life, nor was she jealous of others. She gave off the

feeling that she was content with her life.

“The Winters wouldn’t be so cruel to you, would they? Even though, I must say, Nox is evil,” Monica said.

‘Mrs. Winter, Mr. Winter, and Grandpa Winter treat me very well.” Shelly admitted, “But after all, I was brought back to the Winters to be Nox’s wife.

Now that Nox has a fiancee, it’s not appropriate for me to stay in the Winters.”

“You have too much pride.”

“That’s not true.” Shelly quickly denied it. “Actually, there was a time when I couldn’t make ends meet, and I did think about going back to the Winters. However, it felt like I would be cheating on the Winters if I brought a child with me. So, after thinking about it, I decided not to go back and embarrass the Winters. In fact, earning money and raising my own child with it isn’t as hard as I thought it would be. When I was young, I was afraid of being poor. That was why I wanted money so much. Now, I have learned to live within my means, and I have to say, without Nox by my side, I feel much happier..”
