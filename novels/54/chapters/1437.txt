Chapter 1438: George Came Home Injured

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Candice was stunned, and so was Edward. Neither of them had expected they would be so engrossed in it that they forgot where they were or who was around them.

“I want to kiss you too.” Paige looked at them eagerly.

Edward and Candice finally let go of each other awkwardly.

Paige’s big, clear eyes looked straight at them as she asked, “Daddy, is Mommy’s mouth sweet?”

Edward looked at his daughter. Then, he smiled. “How do you know?”

“Because I see you kissing Mommy all the time.”

Candice was embarrassed. Sometimes, even though what a child said was normal, it would come across as a little lewd.

“I want to give it a try too.” As she spoke, Paige climbed onto the seat and wrapped her arms around Candice’s neck.

Candice watched as Paige’s little mouth was moving closer to hers and kissed her on the lips. Candice almost melted at the sight of Paige’s cuteness.

“It’s not very sweet,” Page concluded after the verification.

Candice was so embarrassed that she wanted to bury her head in a hole. Fortunately, Edward carried Paige over at that moment, and the Ferris wheel shook.

“Only Daddy can taste Mommy’s sweetness.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why?” Paige’s face was filled with confusion. “Because… You’ll know when you grow up.”

“Daddy, I hate you,” Paige wheedled.

Edward hugged Paige and coaxed her.

Meanwhile, Candice quietly watched the interaction between Edward and Paige… She did not know why, but she suddenly felt like crying.

She had lived with them for a while, so she would still be inexplicably moved by some of their interactions. It was as if it touched her soul.

The Ferris wheel slowly descended, and they walked out together.

Edward’s assistant, who was waiting below the Ferris wheel, stepped forward respectfully. “Leader, I just received news that Young Master Elias was injured at the base and was sent back urgently.”

Edward’s face sank. Candice was also so shocked that she stared straight at the assistant.

“It’s a little serious but not life-threatening.”

“Alright,” Edward replied indifferently. He turned to Candice. “Let’s head back.”

“Alright.” Candice quickly nodded.

When Paige heard that her brother was injured, she did not make a fuss and left the amusement park with them.

When they returned to Bamboo Garden, George had just been sent back and was lying on his bed. His little face looked visibly weak, but he was stubborn and did not say a word.

The moment Edward appeared in George’s room, a man guarding George reported respectfully, “Leader, Young Master was accidentally scratched in the thigh by a tiger during the combat drill today. The wound is a little serious. Because I didn’t take good care of the Young Master, I’m willing to accept all the punishment.”

“It has nothing to do with Mr. Dunn.” George explained to him, “It’s my fault, not Mr. Dunn’s fault.”

“It’s my fault for not protecting the Young Master well.” Julian felt very guilty.

“How big is the wound?” Edward did not mention punishment and only asked about George’s condition.

“His entire right leg is badly scratched. The deepest part has penetrated deep into the Young Master’s bones, but it hasn’t really hurt his muscles and bones. The doctor has already given him emergency treatment. After recovering for a period of time, the injury will heal, and it won’t affect the Young Master’s right leg.”

Edward nodded and asked, “How long will it take to recover?”

“At least three months.”

“Alright, I understand,” Edward said. He was so cold that no emotions could be seen. “George will be resting at home for the time being. You guys can head back first.”

Julian looked at Edward, a little surprised that he did not receive any punishment.

“George said that it was his fault and doesn’t blame anyone, so you don’t have to feel guilty. In the base, he is just an ordinary person. There’s no need to treat him differently. This injury was just an accident,” Edward said bluntly.

“Yes,” Julian hurriedly replied respectfully.

“You guys can leave.”

“Yes.”

With that, the group of men left George’s room.

George was lying on the bed without any expression. Even his lips were pale.

How serious was his injury? Injured by a tiger? What exactly had George experienced to be hurt by a large wild animal?
