“Calm down.” Wyatt was also a little irritated at the moment.

How could Claire calm down at a moment like that? However, she had no choice but to suppress her emotions.

Candice said, “I think we should visit Chloe now and ask her about her situation.”

“Yes, let’s go take a look at Chloe now. She must be scared out of her wits being in the detention center for so long!” Claire quickly said.

Wyatt agreed, and the family went to the detention center together.

After going through a series of formal procedures, they finally saw Chloe, who was locked up in an independent room. Chloe’s eyes were swollen. It was obvious that she had cried all night.

When she saw her parents, she burst into tears. “Dad, Mom, you’re finally back. I’m so scared. I’m so scared…

Claire hugged Chloe. “Chloe, don’t be afraid. Your father and I are back. We will protect you. Don’t be afraid.”

“Mom, you don’t know how scary this place is. I’m so scared here. If you guys didn’t show up, you might not have been able to see your daughter,” Chloe said miserably. She also looked extremely pitiful.

Seeing that, Claire’s heart broke. The mother and daughter burst into tears in prison.

Chloe asked, “Mom, can I leave with you now?”

Claire froze.

Chloe looked at them in disbelief. “Can’t I leave? No, I don’t want to stay here for a second. There are rats here, and they ran past me last night. No, Mom, I can’t stay here. I’ll die.”

“Be quiet!” Wyatt suddenly roared at Chloe.

Chloe was shocked to see Wyatt lose his temper. Her eyes were red as she looked at Wyatt pitifully and did not dare to cry anymore.

“How can you still have the cheek to feel wronged after doing something so snametlll( wny aren’t you retlectlng on wnat you did and wny you’re IOCKed up?” Wyatt berated.

Chloe’s eyes were red, and tears streamed down her face again. “Dad, I was really drunk. That’s why I did that to Edward. I was really drunk.. Sis quarreled with Edward yesterday, and Edward was in a bad mood, so he was drinking at home. I thought that I could help Sis and Edward patch up their relationship by accompanying Edward to drink and putting in a good word for her. My alcohol tolerance is not great to begin with, and I got drunk. That was why I lost my sense of propriety…’

Candice really impressed by Chloe’s lies, and she finally understood why Claire was so biased toward Chloe. Chloe was really good at pleasing people.

“Are you stupid? If your sister and your brother-in -law were quarreling, why did you get involved?”

“I was just… worried about my sister and brother-in-law. If Sis and Edward have a fallout, with Edward’s status, it might affect our family. I was also doing it for the sake of our family. I didn’t expect things to turn out like this?” The more Chloe spoke, the more aggrieved she sounded.

Candice listened coldly from the side. She was impressed and amused at the same time.

Did Chloe forget that Edward had video evidence? If they both had drunk sex, why would they send her here?

“What do you want me to say, child?” Claire looked as if she had expected better from Chloe. It was obvious that she believed Chloe’s words.

“Mom, can you take me out? I don’t want to stay here, not even for a second.”

Claire quickly asked Wyatt, “Can you think of a way to get Chloe out first? We can explain the rest to Leader alone, okay?”

“I just asked. Apparently, the Leader has personally given the order that we can visit her, but we can’t take her out.” ‘Why?” Claire was even more agitated. “Can’t you release her on bail?”

“The Leader has the authority to do so.”

“T-T-Then, can’t he let Chloe out first because we’re family?”

“Do you think he would’ve sent Chloe here if he accounted for our relationship?” Wyatt was also a little angry at that moment.

Regardless, Claire could not accept it and was extremely annoyed by it.

Chloe naturally could not accept it either.. At that moment, she suddenly saw Candice who was not involving herself in the matter, and quickly said, “Sis, can’t you plead for me? I’m here because of you? Can’t you beg Edward for me?
