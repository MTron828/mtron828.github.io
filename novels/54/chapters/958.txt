959 Birthday Party, Jeanne Returns To South Hampton City

Mason just looked at her.

“I plan to leave without him knowing tonight,” Jeanne said, “and I need your help.”

Mason fell silent. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Assassins were usually quiet. It seemed like other than Millie, the other assassins did not talk much.

If there was a mission, he would do it, but if there was no mission, he would enjoy his time in seclusion.

Jeanne waited quietly for Mason’s answer for a long time.

“How long will you be back there?” Mason suddenly asked.

He did not ask her why she wanted to go back. He just asked her how long it would take.

“A week.” Jeanne said, “At most a week. I’ll also give Kingsley a good explanation.”

Mason nodded. “Alright.”

Jeanne was a little surprised as she did not expect Mason to agree.

Mason said, “Mr. Thorn once came to talk to me about you.”

Jeanne frowned. She did not know that Kingsley would talk about her in private.

“He told me that if he’s gone, I have to protect you,” Mason said bluntly.

Jeanne’s heart sank.

Sometimes, Kingsley could really move her. Even though she often felt that Kingsley was not a good person — in fact, he was a cruel demon — he was so good to her that it was frustrating.

Moreover, she would often deliberately misinterpret Kingsley. She felt that he was good to her because he wanted her to work with him and help him inherit the Hill family.

She had always said that Kingsley was sinister and cunning, but was it not because he was afraid that the emotional burden would be too heavy?

Kinship, or blood relation, was so powerful that it needed to be interpreted with one’s life.

“He also said that your life is more important than his,” Mason added.

Jeanne bit her lip.

At that moment, she would feel a little uncomfortable.

“So, are you sure you want to go back?” Mason asked her.

Jeanne nodded.

Kingsley was indeed very good to her. However, other than Kingsley, she still had other people that she could not let go of.

“Even if you want to leave, Mr. Thorn can’t stop you.” Mason could see it clearly.

Jeanne was Kingsley’s weakness. No matter what Jeanne did, Kingsley would eventually compromise.

Hence, instead of letting Kingsley and Jeanne start a big fight, it was better to help Jeanne leave.

In any case, the result would be the same, so why waste time going through an unnecessary process?

He only needed to protect Jeanne, and that was also an order from Kingsley.

Actually, there was something Kingsley did not tell Jeanne. He did not mean to hide it from her, but he felt that there was no need to say it.

In any case, Mason just had to execute Kingsley’s order.

“Jeanne can’t die before K01!” That was what Kingsley said.

The simple and crude explanation was that if Jeanne was dead, he had to die too. However, if he died, Jeanne could live.

Hence, when Fourth Master Swan threatened to jump off the cliff with Jeanne, he would have jumped off at the same time if they really did jump.

That was an order that an assassin had to carry out, and there was no room for negotiation!

“When do you plan to leave?” Mason asked her.

“Around 10 p.m., when the birthday party is at its busiest,” Jeanne replied.

“Alright.” Mason said, “I’ll make the arrangements.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne thanked him.

Mason nodded and said nothing more.

Jeanne did not say anything else either.

In fact, she did not expect it to go so smoothly, but Mason agreed immediately.

However, she would not think too much about it. She knew very well that no one in the Hills would dare to betray her, offend her, or even kill her!

Therefore, she did not need to be afraid of anything or anyone.

…

That night, it was the busiest day of the year in the manor on the Delta Islands.

As scheduled, that day was considered a holiday for all the assassins and staff on the island, and it was the most important celebration of the year.

Other than the servants, everyone else, including the workers, could dress up to attend the banquet and enjoy the same treatment as the upper-class society.

The party officially started at 7 p.m., and it was held in the manor’s hall.

At that time, the hall was filled with bright lights, and it was a dazzling sight. On top of that, a feast was served, toasts were exchanged, and the atmosphere was lively.

According to tradition, Kingsley would only come down from the red carpet on the second floor after the party started.

His presence was pretty domineering, and he had a woman by his side.

It was Lucy or Millie but Jeanne.

Ever since Jeanne returned to the Hills, she was the only one who could stand beside Kingsley on formal occasions.
