1279 A Woman Appears

Everyone was mingling around on their own and Monica took her time before joining in the crowd.

In fact, every time Dr. Jones reminded her about something, she would always heed his words, such as grabbing something to eat first.

She went straight to the dessert section and chose a few pastries that she liked.

She was ready to leave the station when someone called her from behind, “Godmother.”

Monica turned around in surprise. “George, you’re here!”

“Yes.” George nodded.

The ten-year-old George had really grown much taller.

She had no idea when but his fair face had grown tanner. Even his baby face was not as childish anymore. He gave off a big boy vibe, and he was clearly more mature than his age ought to be.

If Jeanne knew that her son had suddenly become so sophisticated, her heart would probably ache.

Monica patted George’s head. “Do you want some pastries? Godma will get you some.”

“No need. I’ve just eaten.”

“Did you follow your father here?” Monica asked.

“No,” George said. “I came on my own. I asked Teddy to send me here.”

“Your dad’s not coming tonight?”

“No.”

“Why so?” Monica was surprised.

George didn’t answer.

Oh well. George actually had a deep prejudice against Fourth Master Swan, just like she did.

Once someone was related to Jeanne, who would not have a prejudice against Fourth Master Swan?!

Monica smiled. “Don’t worry, I’m on the same side as you.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

George nodded.

He seemed to believe her.

“By the way, how’s your sister?” Monica asked as she ate her pastry.

Although Monica did not like Paige very much. Once she saw Paige by accident. She inexplicably felt that Fourth Master Swan’s daughter looked very likable, the kind affability at first glance. Paige probably looked exactly the same as George, that was why she felt a sense of familiarity.

However, logically speaking, she still could not accept the existence of Fourth Master Swan’s daughter. Therefore, even if she liked that little girl very much, she would not care much for her.

She had only heard that George loved his sister very much. At this moment, the two of them had nothing to talk about. They could not keep complaining about Fourth Master Swan. It was fine if they complained in private, but it would be awkward if others heard them.

She could only switch the subject.

“She’s such a chubby girl. She’s very cute.” George’s eyes instantly lit up when speaking of Paige.

Monica could not help but sigh to herself.

George was still a child after all.

He did not expect his father to abandon his mother and give birth to his sister.

“I’ve been away for a long time but she’ll remember me. As soon as I come back, she’ll want to sleep with me. She’ll stick to me wherever I go. I came here just now to avoid my sister. She’ll cry if she sees me leave,” George said in one breath.

Monica seemed to be able to imagine that scene.

A chubby little girl crying her heart out.

‘I can’t think about it.’

Monica did not know why, but whenever she thought of that little girl, she felt an inexplicable heartache.

Was it because she was born without a mother?!

After all, Susan had already been expelled.

It was probably impossible for her to return to Harken and see her daughter again.

That was why there was a trace of sympathy.

“Godmother, when will you come to my house to see my sister? She’s really cute. I’m sure you’ll like her too.”

“Uh… Okay.” Monica nodded perfunctorily.

‘Admit it. That was a white lie.’

George was about to say something else when there was a sudden movement in the hall.

Monica turned to look.

Looking across the banquet hall, a woman walked in with a security detail.

She could not see it clearly from afar but that should be the organizer for the event today, Candice Nicholson.
