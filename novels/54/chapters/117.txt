Chapter 118: Danger Lurks Everywhere

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne left in a domineering manner.

After Jeanne left, everyone seemed to come back to their senses from the meeting and walked out of the meeting room one after another.

As they walked, there were people discussing, “There were too many rumors before. If it wasn’t for this project and we met her personally, we wouldn’t have known about Director Lawrence’s ability.”

“I couldn’t tell that she was only 25 years old.”

“She really scared me. Her aura is terrifying.”

Joshua listened to everyone’s discussion.

He returned to the office in a huff. The pressure he felt in his heart made him appear distorted.

He could not accept Jeanne flaunting her power in the Lawrence Enterprise.

At this moment.

The phone suddenly rang.

Joshua glanced at the incoming call. He did not even adjust his emotions. “Brother-in-law, why are you looking for me now? Do you think that I haven’t been slapped in the face enough?”

“Hey, watch your attitude.”

“What attitude? I trusted you so much, yet you let Jeanne climb onto my head so easily. I have to swallow my pride in the company and listen to her arrangements!” Joshua could not control his emotions at all.

Eden’s expression changed slightly. “Joshua, if you decided to give up on yourself, then I won’t care about your matters anymore.”

Joshua gritted his teeth.

“I called you today to tell you about the matter of dealing with Jeanne.”

Joshua instantly became a little excited. “What idea have you thought of?”

“Now that the Lawrence Enterprise has negotiated the MUK contract, what is the first job now?”

“To build a national logistics warehouse and establish the logistics ecosystem of the Lawrence Enterprise,” Joshua said quickly.

“To build a warehouse...” Eden was thinking hard.

“Yes. A super logistics warehouse will be built in South Hampton City. Considering the supply chain, the logistics warehouses in other areas will be mainly rented temporarily and assigned to the supervisors of each region. The warehouses will be fully operational.”

“What is the location of the warehouse in South Hampton City?”

“In the Hampton River area. This piece of land was bought by our family a few years ago. We initially wanted to build a physical e-commerce city. However, with the development of the online market, we did not dare to build such a large physical store offline. Therefore, the land had been idle. Now, it could be used for the construction of logistics warehouses. And the scale of our logistics warehouse is on par with Swan Logistics.”

Eden held his phone in silence.

Jeanne was really proactive and efficient in doing things.

A normal company would need at least a month to process the contract before they could start work. After all, after the signage, they would have to bear the costs, and they would then have to come out with a principal amount. A single wrong move and they would lose money. For collaboration of over two billion like this… Lawrence Enterprise invested so much, and the MUK e-commerce platform would pour in more money. A collaboration of almost half a billion, yet Jeanne was so confident.

“Brother-in-law!”Joshua did not hear the voice on the other side and hurriedly called out to him.

Eden came back to his senses. He would not admit it. The more he understood Jeanne, the more surprised he was about this woman’s ability. He said, “The most important thing for you now is to monitor Jeanne’s every move. During our previous cooperation, I suspect that Jeanne has already discovered the mole we placed around her. She will definitely investigate. With Jeanne’s capabilities, it shouldn’t be long until find out. You must now rope in more people to ensure that you can get all the latest news about this project at any time, anywhere.”

“Okay.” Joshua immediately agreed.

“Be careful,” Eden emphasized.

“Brother-in-law, you have to chase Jeanne out of the Lawrence Enterprise. I can’t be bullied by Jeanne like this.”

“As long as you can monitor Jeanne well, I have a way to let you achieve your wish.”

Eden hung up the phone.

He sat in his office, thinking about how to stop the construction of Jeanne’s logistics warehouse project. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He was lost in his thoughts.

Until his phone rang.

He took a glance at the incoming call and picked it up. “Micheal.”

“Are you busy with work?”

“I’m fine. What I’m worried about now is how to help Miss Sanders deal with Jeanne.”

“Have you thought of a good idea?”

“I’m thinking about it, but the pressure is great.” Eden did not hide anything from Micheal. “Jeanne is indeed more capable than I thought. I didn’t even expect it. Before Jeanne turned 18 years old, even though her results were better than average, she was still a pampered young lady who only knew how to have fun. I really didn’t expect her to be so impressive after going abroad for a few years.”
