After experiencing so much, Jasmine finally understood that reality.

However, she was not as lucky as Jeanne to make a comeback!

“What you’re worried about is that Jeanne is now in charge of everything in the company. Even if you inherited most of the inheritance, you would still be under Jeanne’s control.” Eden hit the nail on the head and got to the heart of the matter.

Jenifer nodded. “I have consulted the lawyer about the family’s current situation. Before Jonathan passed away, he did not make a will. Hence, the assets will be distributed according to the law. Logically speaking, Alexander is the first successor. However, Alexander has been convicted of killing Jonathan, so he doesn’t have the right to inherit. Only the second successor, namely the grandchildren, will get equal distribution of the assets. In other words, their assets will be divided equally among Jeanne, Jasmine, and Joshua. However, the lawyer said because I’ve done my best to support Jonathan, according to the law, I can also get a share of it. What he means is that it’ll split four ways between Jeanne, Jasmine, Joshua, and me.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Eden listened attentively.

Jenifer said, “The reason why I’ve been acting like this these past few days is to get my share.”

“If Jeanne is smart, she won’t stop you from getting your share. She would only be damaging her reputation if she stopped you. The loss outweighs the gain.”

“That was why I reminded her just now. I don’t know if she heard me.” Jenifer gritted her teeth.

“Don’t worry. There are some things you don’t need to remind her. Jeanne knows better than you.”

“If that’s the case, we can take 75 percent of Jonathan’s inheritance, and Jeanne will only have 25 percent. I did some calculations. Jonathan has 52 percent of the company’s shares, and we’ll be able to get 39 percent of it. Adding that to the 5 percent of Alexander’s shares, which he definitely won’t give Jeanne, we’ll have 43 percent. As for Jeanne, she already has 10 percent of the shares. Adding that to what she could get this time, she would have 23 percent of the shares. Hers is nothing compared to us. However, I’m worried that with Jeanne’s control over Lawrence Enterprise’s development right now, many of the senior management and other shareholders would request Jeanne to manage the company. If the company stays under Jeanne’s management, Jeanne could use a lot of tricks to make us react out of anger and kick us out of the family in the end.” Jenifer understood the situation very well.

“You need someone who can control Jeanne to help you stabilize the management rights of Lawrence Enterprise.” Eden gave them the only solution. “As for who can do it, I can.”

Jenifer looked at Eden.

“Even though I haven’t been in the business world for long, I’ve had quite a few achievements when I managed the Swanhaven Bank under Swan Enterprise. Joshua definitely won’t be able to gain the trust of the senior management and shareholders of Lawrence Enterprise. However, if I manage the Lawrence Enterprise on Joshua’s behalf, I will have an advantage over Jeanne.”

“What you mean is that you’ll work at Lawrence Enterprise?”

“Yes,” Eden said. “I’m sure you know that my Fourth Uncle fired me from Swan Enterprise for Jeanne, and I happen to have a lot of free time now. Mom, not only do you guys want to bring Jeanne down, but I also don’t like her very much. Ever since she returned to the country, she has been targeting me everywhere. Now that she has joined hands with my Fourth Uncle to target me, I can’t take it standing anymore.”

That was the truth. Although he wanted Jenifer to trust him, he really did want to kill Jeanne.

Jenifer still seemed a little hesitant.

After all, she might not be able to control Eden. Letting him work in Lawrence Enterprise might be able to make Jeanne less arrogant, but what if that, in turn, exposed Eden’s ambition?

She felt conflicted and also a little frustrated. If Joshua could be as capable as Eden and Jeanne, she would not have to make those choices!

“Mom, we don’t want Jasmine’s shares.” Eden expressed his sincerity.

Jenifer looked at Eden in disbelief.

“Jasmine’s share will be directly transferred to Joshua. We don’t want any of it.” Eden confirmed again.

“You really don’t want it?”

“No. It was Joshua’s, to begin with,” Eden said straightforwardly. “Even if I want it, I want it from the Swans.”

“Okay.” Jenifer no longer hesitated after hearing Eden’s words.

In fact, she did not have many other choices.
