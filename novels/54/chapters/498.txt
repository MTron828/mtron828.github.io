Chapter 499: Father and Son “Reunited”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You know me so well, huh?” Jeanne asked.

It was because he knew her too well that he was mistaken.

Therefore, because time was tight, all he did was tell Nox to stay and send her back when he left. He did not have Nox wait for her.

Then, when she came back, he found that she had left.

Just like that, she disappeared from Harken.

It was not that he had never thought of looking for her, but his body was too weak then. When he had the energy to look for her, he seemed to have figured out some things.

In fact, being with him was not necessarily good for her. He could not even protect himself at that time, let alone Jeanne.

He even thought it was a good thing that she left.

Once he completed his mission, he would look for her all over the world. However, if he did not… he would probably have died.

Forgetting him was the best thing for her.

Hence, all those years, he only thought about her. He thought about her madly but did not do anything until he heard she was coming back.

After seven years of separation, he heard she was coming back to get married. Since she was going to get married, she should marry him.

He could allow her to disappear from his world, but he could not allow her to be with someone else under his nose.

......

He could control himself if he had not had a taste of her before. However, he had, and it would be hard for him to let go of her.

He said, “As I said, I’ve liked you for many years.”

Jeanne frowned and looked at Edward with a face full of doubt.

She said, “Could it be that you’ve already had feelings for me when I was dating Eden?”

“Otherwise, did you really think it was so easy to get in bed with me?”

That fellow had been waiting for her to walk right into his trap for a long time! She said, “You like your nephew’s girlfriend.”

That person was just too dark.

Edward smiled. “Who said I didn’t let him have you?”

Jeanne frowned.

“That year...” Edward paused.

On the contrary, Jeanne started to get excited. “That year, what? When did you realize you like me?”

When exactly?

After all, she had only seen Edward less than a handful of times until she was 18 years old, and they had never even talked to each other before that.

“I won’t say anything else.” Edward suddenly refused to answer her question.

Jeanne’s face darkened

“There’s nothing to say.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Why are you so bad?” Jeanne was angry.

“In short.” Edward hugged Jeanne in her arms, but she deliberately resisted him. Hence, he hugged her even tighter. “All you need to know is that I’ve liked you for many years.”

“Hmph.” Jeanne ignored him.

“Didn’t you want to know why I was so sure that George was my son?” Edward changed the topic. It was obvious that he was trying to please her.

“I don’t want to know anymore. Since you’re so powerful, there’s nothing you don’t know anyway,” Jeanne said sarcastically.

“It’s actually easy to figure out. Back then, when you climbed into my bed–”

“Please. Back then, you were probably hoping I’d climb into your bed. Don’t make yourself sound so passive.”

On second thought, she had only taken the initiative to look for him that night.

In fact, the entire process… was all him.

At the thought of it now, her face turned red.

She thought she had forgotten it all because in the seven years she was away, she deliberately tried not to think about it. However, at that moment, her mind was suddenly clear.

Edward smiled and admitted, “Yes, I had waited for a long time, and I was so excited that night that we didn’t use any protection.”

At that, Jeanne’s face turned even redder.

It was true. It seemed like they were entangled in each other’s bodies the entire night.

“Moreover, George is six years old this year. Based on my understanding of you, you wouldn’t have slept with another man after you slept with me. After all, you and Eden have been together for so many years, yet Eden has never touched you,” Edward said.

“You know very well about my relationship with Eden, huh?”

“Eden mentioned it occasionally.” Edward’s eyes flickered.

“Eden would tell you these things?”

“I would occasionally ask a few questions.”

Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“These aren’t important. What’s important is that I know that you’re not a casual woman.” Edward changed the topic again.

Jeanne just stared at him.

“Since you’re not, according to my reasoning, George is, without a doubt, my son.”

That fellow really did understand her.

Suddenly, Jeanne felt a chill down her spine.

In that case, she reckoned that she had grown up under the covetous gaze of Edward before she was at least 18 years old.

If he was a pervert... Just thinking about it made her feel terrified.
