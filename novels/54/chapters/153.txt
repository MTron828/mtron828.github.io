Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She said, “Where are you taking me?”

Obviously, they were not on the way to the Lawrences’ courtyard.

“Ms.Lawrence, where do you think is the safest place right now?” Fourth Master Swan’s tone was unhurried, but his voice was a little deep.

Jeanne did not reply.

Fourth Master Swan’s eyes moved slightly and he said with indifference, “To my place.”

She had actually guessed it.

However, she was hesitating and it could not be blamed.

The safest place was none other than Fourth Master Swan’s place.

At least for now, the Sanders would not directly confront the Fourth Master Swan.

She said, “Didn’t you say that you wouldn’t help me?”

“It’s my fault for always being unable to control my feelings towards Ms. Lawrence.” Fourth Master Swan’s cold words seemed to carry a hint of cruelty.

One could vaguely sense his temper.

Could he be angry?

What was he angry about?

There was a sudden silence in the car.

It was always after one sentence that the two of them did not speak again.

The car arrived at the Bamboo Garden steadily.

Teddy respectfully opened the car door for her.

The moment she was about to get out of the car, Fourth Master Swan had already gotten out of the other car door, walked in front of her, and carried her by the waist.

Actually…

She did not hurt any vital parts, and the crash also did not affect her walking.

However, at this moment, for some reason, she did not reject him.

Fourth Master Swan carried Jeanne directly up to the second floor and walked into a luxurious room.

This room was actually...

She had slept in it before.

So many years had passed, and the furnishings and displays inside did not seem to have changed at all.

Fourth Master Swan placed her on the big bed.

Jeanne’s slender body leaned against the headboard of the bed.

Fourth Master Swan’s cheek was very close to hers.

He said, “Ms.Lawrence, do you want to take a shower or bandage up first?”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly. She said bluntly, “I want to do something first.”

Fourth Master Swan’s expression obviously changed.

“It’s very important.” Jeanne was very persistent.

Fourth Master Swan stared straight at her, who was covered in blood.

Jeanne was not actually asking for Fourth Master Swan’s permission.

She left the bed and took out her phone. She then walked to the huge balcony.

She called Miles. “Are you home?”

“Yes.”

“How’s Klaus?”

“He’s in good condition.”

“Pass the phone to him.”

After a while.

Klaus’ voice came from the phone. “Jeanne.”

“Mr. Klaus, I’m very sorry for what happened today.” Jeanne expressed her apology.

“I’ve experienced it before in another country. It was probably because they don’t want me to help someone climb to a higher position. I can understand, so don’t worry about me. Besides, I’m safe and sound now, so there’s no need to take it to heart. But how are you? Are you hurt?”

“I’m fine,” Jeanne replied. “I need to trouble you about something.”

“Go ahead.”

“I’ll get Miles to help you record a video. I hope that you can use the video to tell everyone in Harken that you’ve arrived in South Hampton City safely. Tomorrow, you’ll personally go to the administrative office and plan the traffic road design with the planning department.”

“Okay.”

“Once you come into contact with the officials, any accidents that you get involved with will be related to them. This will ensure your safety to the maximum extent,” Jeanne explained.

“I understand.”

“Mr. Klaus, sorry for your trouble. And thank you.”

“You are welcome. You are my disciple’s mother. I can not stand by and do nothing about your matters.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne expressed her gratitude again. “Please give Miles your phone.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne told Miles some things and hung up the phone before calling George again.

“Mom, did you forget about me?” George picked up the phone and was extremely dissatisfied. “Didn’t you say that you would come back to pick me up after picking up my master?”

“Something happened and I can’t come to pick you up. I will send you a video in a while, please help me post it on the Internet.”

“Are you in danger?” George was concerned.

“No.”

“Oh, when can I see my master?”

“Tomorrow. Tomorrow, your master will let you personally handle... the design of the traffic blueprints.”

“...”

Jeanne smiled.

She could imagine George’s breakdown at this moment. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After she finished instructing George, she called Forrest the next second.

“Director Lawrence, did you get Mr. Klaus?”

“I did,” Jeanne said. “I ran into something today, so I won’t be coming to the company. You take the lead on the project. Call me if there’s anything.”

“Okay.”

Jeanne reminded him of some precautions before hanging up.

After hanging up, she received a clear video.

Jeanne transferred the video to George.

After the video appeared on various major networks, Jeanne put down her phone and returned to Fourth Master Swan’s bedroom.

In the bedroom, Fourth Master Swan sat on the huge sofa.

His eyes moved slightly as he watched her enter.

From the moment she left the bedroom to the balcony, she had been gone for at least half an hour, yet this man did not disturb her at all.

At this moment, it seemed that he was just waiting.

Waiting for her to finish everything and walk toward him.

When she was one step away, he raised his eyebrows. “Are you done?”

“Yes.”

“So, are you planning to take a bath or apply medicine first?”

Jeanne could actually feel some of Fourth Master Swan’s emotions, even if he looked very normal.

When she was about to answer, Fourth Master Swan said bluntly, “I suggest that you take a bath first.”

After saying that, he turned around and went straight to the bathroom. Then, she heard the sound of running water.

Jeanne looked down.

There were indeed a lot of bloodstains on her body.

However, she was very clear that the injuries on her body were all superficial wounds.

Fourth Master Swan came out of the bathroom and returned to her. He directly carried her by the waist.

Jeanne instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck.

The two of them seemed to be very close.

Their breath was very close to each other, and their heartbeat was even closer.

Fourth Master Swan carried her into the bathroom and placed her on the sink.

The sound of the shower could be heard from the bathroom.

“Don’t take too long. Try to avoid water on your wound. Call me after you’re done washing.” Fourth Master Swan’s voice sounded in her ears. “Clean clothes are on the clothes rack.”

After saying that, he walked out.

Jeanne looked at Edward Swan’s back.

Her heart skipped a beat.

She looked down at her bloody clothes and slowly took them off.

Outside the bathroom, Master Swan sat on the sofa with his legs crossed elegantly.

He picked up the phone and dialed.

“Fourth Master Swan.” Nox Winter’s voice came from the other end.

“Spread the news that Ms.Lawrence is here at my place.”

“What?” Nox was dumbfounded.

Edward did not give any explanation and hung up the phone.

Nox looked at his phone and did not react for a long time.

Did Fourth Master Swan mean that... he and Jeanne are now official?

…

Jeanne came out of the bathroom after taking a shower.

She was wearing a bathrobe.

So, Fourth Master Swan’s so-called clean clothes was this robe? The kind that had practically no cloth.

She wrapped it tightly and appeared in front of Fourth Master Swan.

Fourth Master Swan raised his head and looked at her.

There was nothing... strange in his eyes.

Perhaps, she was worrying too much.

“Go to the bed, I’ll help you with the medicine,” Fourth Master Swan said, his voice pleasant to the ear.

Jeanne returned to his big bed.

Fourth Master Swan also walked over.

The medical kit was placed on the head of his bed. He took out iodophor from inside and helped her treat the injuries on her forehead, the many places on her arm that had been scratched by the car window, and then...

She lay on the bed.

Fourth Master Swan lifted up her tightly wrapped sleeping robe.

Jeanne blinked.

She looked at Fourth Master Swan and saw that his deep eyes seemed to be dyed with color.
