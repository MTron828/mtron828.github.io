Chapter 567: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Jeanne smiled.

People in the workplace really knew how to twist the truth.

Such a statement could make people think she left Lawrence Enterprise because of her work and not because of some shameful scandal.

“However, I’ve worked hard in all the years I’ve been in Lawrence Enterprise and led the public relations department to sign many big contracts. Now that you want me to leave, I am indeed somewhat reluctant. Even if my skills are no longer sufficient, I have contributed all my youth to the company...” Michelle was probably still somewhat unconvinced.

Jeanne nodded. “That meant none of you read all the contents of the document I gave you. The compensation is written at the end of the document. Regarding the transfer and dismissal of position, a clear and detailed case should be stated in there. In short, for those who will be transferred, regardless of whether you’ve been demoted or relocated, your original salaries won’t change, and you will still enjoy all the benefits you get as part of the senior management.”

Winston did not believe that they would receive such treatment.

He quickly opened the last page and did see a compensation contract from Lawrence Enterprise.

He raised his head and looked at Jeanne. “Are you lying to us?”

Jeanne smiled. “The chairman has already signed and stamped it with the official seal. Once you sign it, it will be established. You can’t sue me for demotion and layoffs, but you can sue me if I don’t fulfill what’s stated in the contract.”

Winston was flattered.

With the information in his hands, Lawrence Enterprise would not only not have to compensate him for demoting him, but they could also keep him quiet for the rest of his life.

However, now that the company had given him such a big surprise, he suddenly could not understand Jeanne.

Jeanne could also read Winston’s thoughts, so she did not beat around the bush. “Although the current senior managers are no longer the right fit for these positions, we cannot deny your contributions to the company. So, we will definitely give you the greatest compensation. And for these changes, I have to say again that it’s not that the company wants to abandon you, but we need a group of talents more suitable for this position to continue to make Lawrence Enterprise better. I hope everyone can understand.”

“I understand.” Bryce hurriedly flattered, “We’re old. It’s time to step back and let young people take over. We can’t just occupy the position and do nothing.”

In just a short while, they suddenly switched sides.

Alexander looked at Bryce with some surprise, wondering when Bryce became so easy to talk to.

Bryce seemed to have noticed Alexander’s gaze, but he ignored it. In fact, he had never been clearer about something. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

They had caught hold of his weakness yet were giving him such great benefits. He had to be crazy to go against Lawrence Enterprise.

At that moment, he had no choice but to admit that Jeanne was indeed much smarter than the average person.

At least she managed to buy him off.

He knew that Jeanne was doing so to force them to leave their positions, yet he still allowed her to buy him off.

After all, why did she have to give them such benefits when she could just kick them out without spending a single cent? In all the large enterprises in Harken, probably no one could be so magnanimous.

He really admired Jeanne’s boldness.

With his understanding of Alexander and even Joshua, they would never be like that.

Hence, what he said to Jeanne was also from the bottom of his heart.

The other senior managers all agreed with Bryce. In an instant, those who had been demoted and transferred all had looks of gratitude on their faces.

On the contrary, Alexander’s expression did not look good.

What did Jeanne have up her sleeve to make those people go with the arrangements so obediently?

“What about us?” Michelle asked, “If those who don’t leave their jobs can receive this treatment, what about us?”

“As for you, your salary will be halved according to the retirement age limit, but your benefits will be the same as before. In other words, Lawrence Enterprise will continue to cover your insurance until you retire.” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly.

Michelle looked at Jeanne with surprise.

Jeanne said, “Lawrence Enterprise has never mistreated any employee, let alone a senior manager who has made such a great contribution to the company. We hope that these initiatives will get the approval of all the senior managers and gain us good publicity.”

In other words, not only would the layoffs not cause a negative impact, but Jeanne also wanted to hype up Lawrence Enterprise’s humanity and morality.

“Don’t worry. I know what to say to the public,” Bryce quickly promised.

The others all promised as well.
