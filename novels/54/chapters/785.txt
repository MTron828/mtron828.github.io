Chapter 786: Monica and Michael’s Conflict Breaks Out

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox knew that Edward would not blame him.

However, he felt bad that he had failed to fulfill his duty.

“No one expected you and Jeanne to get in an accident last night. No one, including Fourth Master, expected that someone would make such a bold move on you when the Sanders had mobilized so many armed forces. So, you really can’t be blamed for this, and Fourth Master won’t blame you either.”

“I just can’t accept it. If anything happens to Jeanne while she’s by my side…” Nox clenched her fists.

“I understand you. If it were me, I would feel the same way. However, now that things have come to this, all we can do is help Fourth Master find Jeanne.”

“But Edward doesn’t need our help.”

“Then, he must have other plans.”

Nox looked at Finn.

Since he was young, he was not as good as Edward and Finn in terms of strategy.

Rather than saying it was because they were slightly older than him, so they had to consider a lot of things, it would be better to say that he was not born with brains like them.

Then, he heard Finn say, “We all know that Jeanne’s identity is not simple.”

Nox nodded.

“We’ve confirmed her identity as the young lady of the Hills.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah.”

“So, if something happens to the Hills’ young lady, do you think the Hills will sit back and do nothing?”

“Do you mean Edward will inform Kingsley and work with him?”

Finn nodded.

Nox was deep in thought.

“Since Fourth Master doesn’t need us now, he must have his own plans. When has Fourth Master ever made a mistake?”

Nox was convinced by Finn’s words.

He had always been the most impulsive one. No matter in what situation, he would always lack calmness.

However, every time that happened, either Edward or Finn would find a way to calm him down.

“Believe in Fourth Master. You should take care of yourself now. For you, recuperating is the greatest help you could give to Fourth Master. After all…” Finn’s eyes narrowed. “The real war has yet to begin. We can’t let anything happen to either of us now.”

Nox nodded.

He knew that the real battle had yet to begin, and it might be coming soon.

Hence, the most important thing for him now was to take good care of himself and then face death calmly.

Nox calmed himself down.

Then, he looked at Finn and asked, “Who do you think took Jeanne away?”

Finn shook his head and said, “I don’t dare to guess.”

Nox raised a brow.

Finn said, “Jeanne might be related to anyone but no one at the same time. It’s possible to take a guess, but I don’t dare to make any wild guesses, in case I’m wrong.”

Nox nodded.

It was true.

Was Jeanne good or evil? Who exactly was Jeanne involved with? Whose side was Jeanne on? What was Jeanne thinking? Who was Edward to Jeanne?

None of them knew.

Perhaps even Edward did not know. Yet, he still placed an unknown bomb by his side without any hesitation.

Nox sighed and said bluntly, “I’m afraid something will happen to Jeanne this time.”

Finn nodded.

“I’m more afraid that…” Nox’s eyes were deep. “Edward will die in Jeanne’s hands.”

Finn did not answer because none of them was sure when it came to Jeanne.

…

Finn stayed with Nox in the hospital for most of the day.

Although the scene of the accident was gruesome, because the car was custom-made, even if it was a major accident, the injury Nox sustained was not serious.

As long as he took a CT scan of his brain and confirmed that there was no internal bleeding, he could be discharged from the hospital.

After Finn helped Nox with the discharge procedures, he and Finn left the hospital.

“Isn’t that Monica?” Nox looked at the woman who was walking toward them.

Finn also saw her, but he pretended that he did not.

Monica did not notice them at first, but at that moment, she saw them.

Her footsteps even halted for a few seconds.

On the other hand, Nox limped over. “What are you doing in the hospital? Are you sick?”

Monica glanced at Finn, who was not looking at her.

Hence, she looked back at Nox. “I’m here to take out the nail in my leg.”

“Is it out now?” Nox looked at her ankle.
