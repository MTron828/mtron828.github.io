Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jeanne turned to look at them. When she looked back, she looked even more beautiful and charming.

Monica could not take it anymore, and Shelly, too, was a little shocked by her beauty, which exuded a sense of femininity that even women could not resist her charm.

“Come and have a seat,” Jeanne said to them.

There was only one dining table on the luxurious deck. Shelly knew that they lived a luxurious life, but sometimes she was still shocked by their extravagance.

She and Bella sat down at the exquisite dining table, feeling rather restrained. When Bella saw the beautiful pastries in front of her, her eyes sparkled. However, because Shelly did not say anything, Bella did not dare to reach out to take it herself.

“Eat. ”

Jeanne could see the look in Bella’s eyes, which was very similar to her daughter’s when she wanted dessert, and it made her wonder if all the children in the world had the same expression. As such, Jeanne looked at Bella affectionately.

Upon hearing Jeanne’s words, Bella raised his head to look at Shelly. Only when Shelly nodded did Bella politely take the dessert from Jeanne. “Thank you, Aunty.”

Jeanne patted Bella’s head, finding the little girl very cute. If Nox and Shelly could be together, she had a feeling that Bella and Paige could become very good friends in the future.

There were only some desserts on the dining table, and everyone was eating, except for Monica.

Jeanne frowned. “Aren’t these your favorite dessert? Why aren’t you eating?”

“I’m going on a diet.”

“Going on a diet while you’re breastfeeding?”

Speechless, Jeanne immediately placed a macaroon on Monica’s plate.

“I’m not eating. If I eat any more, I’ll be obese.”

“No one will dislike you for being fat.” Jeanne retorted.

“I will hate myself! I’m a person with high self-esteem,” Monica said resolutely. “But you can’t go against your parents and Finn.”

Monica was at a loss for words. Jeanne, that woman, really had her under her thumb.

“Eat, ” Jeanne continued to persuade her.

In fact, Monica wanted to eat it too, and she was almost drooling. However, she told herself that she must not let herself down.

While she suppressed her urge, she muttered, “Maybe they don’t despise me verbally, but they must think that I’m fat and ugly in private.”

“That’s what you think.”

“All men like beautiful women, not fat women. Finn must be lying.”

“If he were lying, there wouldn’t be so many marks on your neck, ” Jeanne said straightforwardly. Stunned, Monica looked at Jeanne, who lowered her head and ate the pastries gracefully.

“Why don’t you go to the bathroom and take a look yourself,” Jeanne said.

Monica quickly put down her Imife and fork, left the deck, and rushed into the bathroom on the cruise ship. Jeanne watched as Monica left anxiously and chuckled.

Shelly was envious of their friendship. It was a relationship where they often bickered, but deep down, they were always thinking for each other.

In fact, she had a good relationship with Sarah too. However, she felt that because she had lesser experience in life than them and because her life was very different from that of Sarah, she and Sarah could not be as carefree with each other as Jeanne and Monica.

“Just ignore her.” Jeanne looked at Shelly and said, “You’ll get used to her moaning.”

Shelly nodded and thought, ‘Only true friends can act so freely with each other!’

While they were snacking on the desserts, the staff poured them some red wine. By then, Monica had returned, and she felt a little embarrassed.

She said, “It’S just normal behavior between husband and wife.”

“No one said anything about you.” Jeanne retorted, “I’m just telling you that you’ve gained weight and that you look very cute and charming.”

“Are you complimenting me?” Monica smiled brightly.

She was easily convinced by Jeanne.

‘Yes, yes, yes. I’m complimenting you. Now, hurry up and eat.”

“In that case, I force myself to have some.”

Although she said she was reluctant to have it, she ate quite a lot. It was probably because her appetite had grown from eating too much recently. Hence, once she started eating, she could not stop.

“If all you eat is dessert, how are you going to have the main course later?” Shelly voiced her concern. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Who knows if I still have the stomach to eat later…” Monica suddenly realized that she had let it slip, so she quickly said, “Don’t worry, I have a big appetite now. I can eat an entire cow in one meal..”
