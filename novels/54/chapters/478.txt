Elaine’s expression looked ferocious when she said fiercely, “Go on. I’ll let you speak. Let’s see what you have to say!”

“Thank you, sister.” Jeanne appeared very polite.

However, that made Elaine feel even more embarrassed, so she snorted and chose to shut up.

Jeanne said again, “With regards to my jealousy toward Jasmine, I’d like to ask, what I am jealous of her? Is she better looking? Does she have a better career? Did she marry better than me? Do I have to lower myself to be jealous of someone who’s the child of a mistress?”

“Jeanne, how can you say that?” Alexander scolded her.

Jeanne said, “Isn’t Jenifer a mistress?”

“Your mother died many years ago! Do you want me to be alone for the rest of my life?” Alexander was indignant.

“Yes, my mother has been dead for many years, but Jasmine is only two months younger than me! Did my mother die when she was pregnant with me?” Jeanne asked coldly.

At that, Alexander’s expression turned ashen.

“From a young age, everyone knows who’s jealous of whom.” Jeanne sneered as if the people in front of her were all a joke. Then, she turned her attention to the pale Jasmine. “Jasmine, do you think I’m jealous of you?”

Jasmine suddenly looked into Jeanne’s eyes and began to panic. She had a feeling that Jeanne had a plan in mind.

She gritted her teeth and said in a somewhat meek manner, “You’re not jealous of me, but you’ve always been very angry about what happened between Eden and me back then–”

......

“I am. I’m just angry about why I was so blind back then to take a liking to scum like Eden!”

“Jeanne!” Eden was furious. At that moment, he had also let go of Belle and shouted at Jeanne, “What happened between Jasmine and I was consensual. I don’t like you anymore. Do you want me to suffer and force myself to be with you? You think too highly of yourself!”

“It’s fine if you want to be with me. Even then, I won’t even call you a sc*m! What makes you a sc*mbag is that you do such cruel and infuriating things for the sake of your own reputation. You’re so cruel that you even let your wife hurt her body and lose her child to frame someone else. What you’ve done is disgusting, and even that word flatters you!”

“Enough! Are you trying to insult me to rid yourself of the fact that you caused Jasmine to have a miscarriage? No matter what your feelings toward me are, perhaps just as my aunt said, you might not like me anymore. Yes, I admit I’m not as good as my fourth uncle in any aspect. I admit that you like my fourth uncle now. However, I was the one who hurt you a lot after I got together with Jasmine. Now, you’re holding a grudge toward me, and that’s why you’ve never wanted me to get along with Jasmine. Everyone can tell that!”

“Do you think I’m that stupid? Would I use such a method to take revenge on you? Even in a place like the Swans’ home? If I really didn’t want Jasmine to have this child, I could have hired someone else to do it for me, and no one would know! Why would I do it myself and have all of you catch me in the act?”

“Aren’t you relying on my grandfather’s favoritism toward you? Anyway, if you did it, you’ll still be safe in the end. Can’t you do whatever you want in the family now?” Eden sneered. Although he did not dare to go against his grandfather, he was still sarcastic about it. “Forget it. I don’t want to argue about this. Let’s just take this as Jasmine being careless. Next time, we’ll be more careful and move out to take care of the baby.”

Jeanne looked at Eden. “As expected, I was blind.”

“Me, too,” Eden said fiercely.

As the two of them glared at each other, a big hand suddenly stopped in front of Jeanne.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly, and she turned around to see Edward beside her.

Edward said, “It turns out I do get jealous.”

Jeanne pursed her lips, feeling speechless. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Then, she averted her gaze and took a deep breath.

Not wanting to waste any more time with that group of people, she said, “Whether Jasmine fell on her own accord or on purpose, the reason is simple. It’s because this child isn’t Eden’s at all.”

After that, there was a moment or two of silence.

However, on the third second, Jasmine’s face fell. She lost control of herself and said to Jeanne, “Sister, how can you slander me like this? Eden and I only have eyes for each other. We were both each other’s first time, and we’ll also be each other’s last. You can insult our relationship, but you can’t insult my innocence like that! You’ve gone too far. You really... Even if you want to take revenge on me and cause me to miscarry, I can still accept it. But how can you slander me like this? How can you...”
