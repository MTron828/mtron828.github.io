1354 I Actually Don’t Love You That Much

In a private room in the nightclub, Nox was wailing inside when Edward arrived.

The bodyguards following Edward all stopped outside. With Edward’s current status, bodyguards were rarely allowed to leave his side, but only Nox and Finn could break the rules. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When Nox and Finn saw Edward, Nox quickly put down the microphone. “Edward, you’re here.”

Looking at Edward all on his own, he seemed very relaxed.

Edward removed his cap and mask and nodded.

“It’s been a long time since I drank with you. We must get drunk tonight.” Nox was beyond excited.

At that moment, he poured Edward a glass of wine.

Edward did not refuse. He picked up his wine glass and toasted Nox and Finn. “I’m fine with it as long as you’re happy, but let’s forget about getting drunk. We still have many things to do tomorrow.”

“You’re such a spoilsport,” Nox said disdainfully.

How many years had it been since they last drank together?

He felt that everything had changed in the past few years.

In the past, they had always thought that they existed for Alex and did not expect that Edward would overthrow Alex’s regime one day. However, Edward could not be blamed.

Alex’s desire to control was too strong. If Edward did not resist, he would be under Alex’s shadow for the rest of his life. Rather than saying Edward overthrew Alex’s regime, it would be more accurate to say that Alex was courting death himself. If he had been more magnanimous, he would not have fallen into such a state.

Most importantly, Alex still did not recognize his position to this day.

The power that he had obtained was given to him by those loyal to the Duncans. However, he had never thought that those so-called loyalties did not include Edward, Nox, and Finn. Alex should not have done as he pleased with them.

Hence, when Edward chose to rebel against Alex’s regime, Nox thought it was a matter of course.

He did not think that Edward was unfaithful. On the contrary, it allowed him to release the emotions he had been suppressing all these years.

Alex could not compare to Edward in any aspect, and Edward should not have submitted to Alex. The change in political power was the result of natural selection.

In the private room, the three of them drank a little too quickly.

Indeed, the three of them had not gathered for so many years that they had even forgotten the time when the three of them grew up together.

It felt like all they did was blink and half a lifetime had passed.

As Nox drank, he suddenly felt a little sad. “It just occurred to me that we’re not young anymore.”

Edward and Finn turned to look at him at the same time. They rarely looked as serious as they were now because he did not seem like his usual self.

Nox felt their gazes and said seriously, “Isn’t that so? Edward is already married three times.”

Edward pursed her lips and sipped his wine. He said calmly, “No one will think you’re mute if you keep quiet.”

“Can’t I just lament about it?” Nox was a little displeased. Moreover, he had drunk some wine, and once he was drunk, everything he said would be out of context. He said, “Back then, I always thought that you would die alone. There was no love in your life, and you were treated like a machine. I even thought that you didn’t have any goals in life. Yet, you fell in love with Jeanne in the end. After Jeanne died, you almost married Susan, and now you’re with Candice. Now that I think about it, Monica was right. You’re a high-quality sc*mbag.”

Edward’s expression was grim. “Drink your wine.”

“Edward, you broke our promise.” In a drunken state, Nox questioned Edward, “We agreed to grow up and spend the rest of our lives alone together. Now, not only have you gotten married a few times, but you even have two children. How can you treat us like this…”

However, Edward ignored Nox.

Finn could also tell that Nox was drunk, and Nox was stupid when he was drunk.

Finn picked up the microphone and said to Nox, “Sing.”

“Why should I sing?”

“You sing well.”

“Really?” Nox’s face, which was filled with dissatisfaction, was now filled with pride.

“Yes. Now, hurry up and sing.”

Finn quickly dismissed Nox.

Sometimes, when he thought about it, the three of them did not seem to change much. Especially when no one else was around, they could let down all their defenses and be themselves. Even Edward could too.

Finn poured himself a glass of wine and clinked glasses with Edward. “Fourth Master, I never expected things to turn out like this.”
