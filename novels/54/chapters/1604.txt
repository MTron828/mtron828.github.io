Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a luxurious wedding hall, the joke of a wedding continued.

“This gift is for you.” Wade stood in front of Nox. He may be old and shorter

Nox yelled at the host. Who the f*ck gave him the “surprise”? Who the f*ck let the whole world know that he had been cuckolded? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Nox’s aggressiveness scared the host so much that his face turned pale. He did not know that the so-called “surprise” would be like that. If he did, he would never have allowed the staff to play it. Now, he felt like Nox might strangle him to death in the next second.

He stuttered for a long time but could not complete a sentence.

Nox was so angry that he raised his voice again. “Who is it?!”

The host’s eyes widened in shock. Just as he mustered up the courage to speak out, a deep voice of an old man suddenly sounded in the banquet hall. “It’s me.”

Nox turned around abruptly, and everyone’s focus was on the person who spoke, Wade.

The old master did not show himself much today. Although Nox knew he was here, because he did not like to interact with others, he kept a low profile. However, what did he say now that he had walked out under everyone’s watchful eyes?

Nox watched as his grandfather stand in front of him calmly.

“This gift is for you.” Wade stood in front of Nox. He may be old and shorter than Nox, but as he stood in front of Nox, he exuded an imposing aura that made people subconsciously look at him.

The moment Nox saw his grandfather and heard him say that he was the one who gave him the gift, he was furious.

Nox clutched his chest which was about to explode and forced himself to calm down. Then, he asked calmly, “Grandfather, when did you find out?”

He was asking his grandfather when he found that Zoe had cheated on him.

“Early in the morning.” Wade looked a little cold.

He did not feel guilty about how terrible Nox was feeling.

“Early this morning?” Nox asked.

“No, that morning you insisted on being with Zoe,” Wade replied.

Nox felt that he might be angered to death by his grandfather, and he found it hard to calm down. “Why are you only telling me now?”

Why did his grandfather allow him to be cuckolded for three years and make him think that Zoe was the woman who treated him the best in the world? “Why should I tell you”‘ Wade asked.

That sentence made Nox even more infuriated.

He shouted, “I’m your grandson. How could you do nothing when your grandson, me, has been toyed with by a woman to this extent? How can you say that? Don’t you feel bad for me?”

“I told you not to be with Zoe. Did you listen to me?” Wade asked.

Yes, at that time, he did not listen because he did not know what kind of woman Zoe was.

“Since you didn’t listen to me, what was the use of telling you?” Wade asked calmly.

Nox really believed that he would die of anger.

“In that case, why are you telling me now? Why not let me marry Zoe and be cuckolded for the rest of my life?” Nox shouted in despair.

Why was his grandfather telling him all that now? Since he did not care about him, why was he so kind as to tell him all that? He deserved to be deceived for the rest of his life!

“It’s not for your own good.” Wade faced Nox’s aggression calmly.

Nox glared at Wade.

“I just want to get back at you for resisting me back then,” Wade said matter-of-factly.

It was as if he had done something normal and did not embarrass his grandson in any way. In fact, it was as if he could not see how angry his grandson was.

Nox looked at his grandfather in anger and listened to his grandfather speak in such a dignified manner, like he did not care about anything at all.

In this life, he could never win against his grandfather, not even once.

It was not easy for him to think that he had the power to decide on his relationship and marriage. He had finally made the decision for his life and walked the path he had chosen..
