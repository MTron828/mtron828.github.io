1123 The War Has Started: Will You Be Happy If I Die?

Edward just looked at Kingsley, whom he had killed. Kingsley did not even have the time to close his eyes before he died at his hands.

As the bullets went through, blood splattered everywhere.

He was covered in blood, and his eyes were bloodshot as he looked straight at the man in front of him.

He had watched a powerful man die in his hands.

In fact, many people had died at his hands. He had been raised to kill when necessary since he was young, and he had already lost count of the people he had killed.

Only Kingsley made him break down mentally. Bit by bit, he had to build himself up again.

He squatted there as if his entire body was frozen, while everyone looked at him as he suppressed his emotions.

Nox looked worried. However, he did not seem to know what to say.

He knew that the moment Edward killed Kingsley, Edward and Jeanne would really… That would be the end of their relationship.

Edward had always thought that he could change his fate, but in the end, he still walked on the path of death. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The empty field was extremely quiet.

Alex looked at Edward and took in all of his emotions.

At that moment, he even had a smile on his face.

He looked exactly the same as the real William. Whether it was his expression or the marks on his face, if one looked closely, even the tiny wrinkles were exactly the same.

In fact, the real William had also been killed by Edward.

Many of the important matters of the Duncans had been done by Edward.

Now, Edward had even killed Kingsley of the Hills, who had helped the Sanders to take over the government back then.

To the Duncans, Edward was their greatest contributor.

To Jeanne, he was her greatest enemy.

Alex said, “Old Master Swan, thank you for coming all the way here.”

Zachary came back to his senses.

At that moment, he was also a little moved by Kingsley’s death.

No matter what Kingsley’s identity was, he was still a very important and formidable character. With his death, it would still make people... Zachary sighed.

Facing Alex, Zachary was very respectful. “As I should.”

“Let’s go,” Alex invited.

Zachary nodded and turned back to look at Edward.

He, too, knew what his son was hiding.

However, at that moment, Edward had to bear it himself, just like how he endured all the cruelty he had experienced since he was young.

With that, Zachary left with Wade.

Before Wade left, he urged Nox to keep an eye on Edward.

Nox nodded, but he was afraid that he would not be able to see it well.

Alex took Zachary into the helicopter and left.

After they left, the Duncans’ men also left.

During the evacuation, all the carriages of the Duncans’ men were blown up.

The Duncans’ people, who were here to provide support, were all killed as well. It was only because those people saw Alex’s true face. Therefore, they had to die.

Nox looked at the burning fireballs from afar. Suddenly, he felt a little tired of that kind of life and felt like retiring from the martial world.

He retracted his gaze and looked at Edward, who was still frozen in place, as well as Kingsley and Kerby, who were dead on the ground.

Kerby was shot dead when the Duncans were evacuating.

To them, death was too easy.

“Edward, have you ever thought about leaving this place?” Nox suddenly asked him.

Edward’s throat moved, and he said, “I can’t leave.”

He originally thought that he could retreat safely after helping the Duncans accomplish their great cause.

However, from the looks of it, once one joined the cause, it was impossible to walk out of it.

Nox thought about it and agreed.

It was not easy for the Duncans to nurture them. Unless he died, how could he escape?

“Let’s go,” Nox called out to him.

The battle here was over, but there was also a bigger battlefield that he had to face.

With Kingsley dead, the Sanders would be even more impatient. After all, it meant that the Duncans truly existed and had begun to have the ability and power to exist.

Edward stood up from the ground and put Kingsley down on the ground.

The moment he left, he closed Kingsley’s eyes.

He hoped that Kingsley could die in peace.
