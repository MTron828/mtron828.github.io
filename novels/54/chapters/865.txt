866 Step by Step, the Proposal

Monica tried her best to control her emotions as she slowly walked into her parents’ room. If it was not for Jeanne, she might really have compromised.

Gary and Ruby were a little surprised to see their daughter looking for them, but still, they did not tell Monica about Cardellini Medical Technology’s current situation.

It was to let her be willful. Even though it was clear she was not doing a good job, they still supported her.

Parents like hers…

Monica’s eyes turned red.

She said, “Dad, why didn’t you tell me that you’re being forced to this point by the Board of Directors?!”

Gary was stunned. “Who did you hear that from?”

“Who else could it be? Michael, that scumbag, of course!”

Gary’s expression turned ugly. “Don’t be threatened by him.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Her mother must have told him about Michael’s sinister and cunning scheme. That was why her father would rather shoulder everything himself than let her suffer for him.

“I will not be threatened by him.” Monica gritted her teeth. “However, I won’t let you guys be suppressed by him, either.”

“Huh?” Gary frowned.

Monica had never been responsible before. Ever since she was young, his expectations of her were not high. He did not know if he had been spoiling her or harming her by doing so.

“I’ve agreed to marry Michael…” Monica said.

Before she could finish her sentence, Gary was already enraged. “No matter how bad it gets, I will not sell my daughter out!”

“Let me finish, dad.” Monica rolled her eyes. She finally knew who she took after with her impulsive personality.

Gary endured it.

Monica said, “I’ve agreed to the marriage with Michael first to let down his guard. Then, I’ll think of a way to find Michael’s scandal and expose him so that he has no choice but to give up marrying me. ”

“...” Gary just stared at Monica. Was she sleep-talking?

Ruby looked at her in the same way. She obviously felt that this was an unlikely plan.

Monica looked at their expressions. Her parents had not restrained from hiding their thoughts about her plan. Could they not have a little more faith in her?!

“You guys don’t believe me!” Monica’s face was full of hurt.

“Michael’s not as simple as you think,” Gary said. “Although I’ve never fought with Michael, for him to hold such a high position at such a young age, it’s a definite that he’s not as easy to deal with as you thought. This is also why your mother and I have always been so against you being with Michael. Michael’s mind is very heavy. One day, you won’t even know how you sold yourself. It seems our worries were not unnecessary too since you’ve really sold yourself.”

“...” Her parents were just adding unneeded salt to her wounds.

“I thought Michael truly loved you. When your mother and I saw you commit suicide that time, we thought it was an act…” Gary said, gritting his teeth. “Who would’ve expected Michael to be so shrewd that even he deceived me? Just based on this, you can’t win against Michael.”

This was also why Gary and Ruby did not tell Monica about their situation. Monica was easily swayed by her emotions and would compromise very quickly, just like now. Secondly, it would be useless to say anything and only add to Monica’s troubles.

People like Michael were too good at using tricks. They chose to hide in the dark until it was time to emerge and would always achieve their goal no matter what.

Thinking about it made his teeth itch. Gary had also been suppressed by a man in his twenties for many years.

“I thought I couldn’t win. I even decided to compromise, but Jeanne’s been secretly helping me,” Monica said.

Gary frowned slightly. “Jeanne’s in South Hampton City?”

“There’s something called a phone?” Monica retorted.

Gary was stunned, speechless.

He never used to think that Jeanne was capable. After all, they were all young and in their twenties. To them, they were still growing and inexperienced. However, the results Jeanne had achieved during this period of time had indeed impressed him. Coupled with Michael’s suppression of him this time, he had to admit that the world now belonged to the young.

“With Jeanne’s help, you still have a chance of winning.” Gary immediately agreed.

Monica expressed her hurt. Her ego had taken a hit.

She said, “I’ll discuss with Jeanne about the details, so don’t ask me for them yet. I came to you today just to tell you that I’ll pretend to be with Michael first to keep Cardellini Enterprise and your position as the chairman. We can’t give up the family business for Michael. It’s not worth it. After that, I’ll know how to prevent us from getting married.”
