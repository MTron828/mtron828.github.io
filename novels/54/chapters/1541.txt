Chapter 1542: You Still Can’t Let Go of Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Monica looked back. “Edward’s daughter, Paige, is with Finn. He wanted me to go over and take care of her.”

“In order to get you back, Finn has really done everything he could.” Brandon was able to tell at a glance.

Monica nodded. She could see that, too.

“Will you get back together with him?” Brandon asked.

When Finn asked, she would directly refuse without hesitation. However, when Brandon asked, she was silent for a long time because she really did not know. She did not know if she would give in to Finn or how long she could persist.

“Actually, you still can’t let go of Finn,” Brandon said quietly when he felt Monica’s silence.

She could not tell how sad he was. However, it was apparent that he was disappointed.

The car arrived at Monica’s apartment, and Brandon got out of the car to send her off.

“No need. Go back and rest early. Good night.” Monica rejected him.

Brandon smiled, and as he nodded, he saw that Monica had turned around and walked into the neighborhood.

Monica probably did not even realize herself that she rejected Finn verbally, but physically, she rejected other men. In fact, she had never let go of Finn. It was because she loved him too much that she was disappointed and did not dare to try it again.

Brandon had known it from the very beginning, but because he loved her very much, he had some selfish hopes that Monica would not discover her own feelings and allow him to take advantage of the situation. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, Monica did not give anyone a chance to take advantage of the situation.

The next day, Finn sent Paige back to Bamboo Garden. Paige was a great help, but he was too lousy. Therefore, he did not think it was right for him to take up any more of Paige’s time.

Paige returned home and was extremely excited to see Jeanne. She ran very fast with her short legs.

She threw herself into Jeanne’s arms and hugged her tightly. Accompanied by her wailing, she said, “Mommy, I thought you didn’t want me anymore. Boohoo…

Jeanne’s heart ached. If she really left with George…

She knew very well that if she wanted to leave, she would only take George with her and leave Paige behind by Edward’s side. Only then would it be considered fair.

At the thought of that possibility, Jeanne’s heart ached even more, and she blamed herself.

She picked Paige up. “I promise you that I will never leave you again, okay?”

“Mommy, you have to keep your word.”

“Of course.”

“Pinky swear.” Paige stretched out her cute little pinky.

Jeanne also stretched out her pinky.

After pinky-swearing, Paige finally believed that her mother would not leave her again. However, she still did not want to leave her mother’s arms and hugged her neck tightly. It was as if she did not want to leave for even a second.

“Thank you for taking care of Paige for the last two days.” Jeanne thanked Finn.

“It wasn’t hard. With Paige around, the family will be much happier,” Finn said bluntly.

“How are you and Monica?”

“Still the same.” Finn’s smiled bitterly.

The scene of Monica leaving with Brandon last night was still in his mind.

“Give Monica more time,” Jeanne said.

“I’m afraid that she’ll really leave,” Finn said.

His tone may sound calm, but he was, in fact, upset.

“Is there a third party?” Jeanne almost hit the nail on the head.

Finn nodded. “Monica has never lacked suitors.”

“I know.”

“Ever since we were young, because of her lively personality, she has attracted the attention of the opposite sex. To be honest, when she said she liked you, I was shocked. I always thought that she liked someone like Michael, who was gentle and considerate to her. I didn’t expect her to like or love a man who didn’t treat her very well. Of course, perhaps your kindness isn’t so easily discovered. But from my understanding of Monica, she wouldn’t like a cold man like you.”

Finn smiled, trying to hide his emotions.

He said, “I was too arrogant. I thought Monica really wanted me.”

“That’s not what I meant.” Jeanne explained, “What I mean was that Monica likes you so much that she is going against her own type. That means she really loves you. Since she really loves you, it might not be so easy for her not to love you. So, don’t be discouraged. Accompany her as best as you can. As time passes, she will let go of her grudge against you and be with you..”
