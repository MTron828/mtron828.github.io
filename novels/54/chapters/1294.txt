1295 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

Candice watched as Edward’s lips approached hers.

Countless thoughts seemed to appear in her mind.

Reject, reject not, avoid, avoid not, how to reject, how to avoid…

Hence, her thoughts were all on Edward’s lips.

It stopped abruptly.

She looked at Edward’s face up close.

She saw that his eyes were closed and his eyelashes were very long.

Candice also closed her eyes at that moment, because there was no way to refuse.

The moment Edward approached her, she had already reminded herself to get used to it; that she was used to his intimacy and the intimacy between them when there were people around.

There was indeed Edward’s personal bodyguard in the private room.

Everyone looked at them solemnly, as they shared a deep kiss.

Candice was not sure if it was because the Chief was a busy man or something else, that dating the Chief did not require any process. He was direct and went straight to the point. There were not so many steps to go through one by one.

She endured Edward’s kiss for a long time.

Then, his lips parted from hers.

The moment he left and opened his eyes, Candice felt that she seemed to have seen Edward’s deep affection.

It was that kind of strong, very strong affection, or perhaps it was just an illusion.

After all, in the next second, the man was back to his slightly cold aura.

It was the kind of attitude that would make people feel oppressed even if it was gentle.

She gulped, after kissing each other.

That was rather awkward.

They had already reached this stage only on their second meeting without any feelings for each other. She found this rather difficult to accept, but she had no choice but to just accept it.

“Have some more.” Edward picked up another piece of steak and placed it on Candice’s plate.

Candice looked at the steak and felt that it had a pretty explosive taste.

She picked up her fork and started eating fervently. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Have you gotten to learn about me?” Edward suddenly asked.

Candice glanced at him and nodded. “I’ve read about you on the news.”

“I’m usually very busy.”

“I understand,” Candice replied.

“I’ll try to ask you out sometime,” he said.

“Alright.” Candice nodded.

“If I do something wrong, you can remind me,” Edward said. “Sometimes, I can’t control myself.”

No one would come to say such crowning words after they have done exactly that.

Candice did not reply.

“Eat more,” Edward reminded again gently.

Candice had eaten a lot today. The reason was that she was too embarrassed to say anything, so she could only keep eating.

She felt that Edward did not seem to have touched her fork and knife much.

Was the food not to his liking?! Were these dishes not prepared according to his taste?

She could not figure it out and would not ask more now.

At least to her, she was still unfamiliar with Edward. There was a distance and even a slight disparity in status. Such a relationship would make her a little reserved.

When they were done with dinner, Candice thought that he would have just left.

After all, Edward had just said that he was very busy and did not have the time to accompany her.

And yet, when they left the restaurant, they went straight to the moat and sat on a black-capped boat. The clear moat under the black-capped boat reflected the resplendent lights of South Hampton. The May breeze caressed their faces, giving them a soothing feeling.

The two of them sat quietly at the bow of the ship, with three of Edward’s bodyguards with them. One rowed while the other two sat in the stern.

There were also countless black-suited bodyguards in the black boat behind them, following them at a distance.

“I heard from Minister Nicholson that you haven’t lived in South Hampton much,” Edward asked.

“Yes, I heard that I grew up in the army,” Candice replied.

When the two of them interacted, it felt like they were accommodating each other.

“Heard?”

“Didn’t my father tell you? I don’t have any memories of what happened before I turned twenty-eight. The only memory I have is the one year of recovery after I woke up,” Candice said bluntly.

“I told you, I forgot,” Edward replied.

Candice did not say much, even though she did not believe that Edward would forget such important information.

“To me, this city is unfamiliar. It’s not just the city. Many people around me are strangers to me. After I woke up, I started rehabilitation treatment in a foreign hospital. Every day, other than my father, I interact with medical personnel. Sometimes, I almost forgot what the world outside the hospital was like. Until a month ago, I returned to South Hampton. When I came back, I didn’t know what I should do.” Candice shared about herself.
