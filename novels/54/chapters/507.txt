Chapter 508: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction

Translation

Finn took a deep breath, letting his mind go blank.

However, that person beside him was starting to misbehave again.

“Monica.”

“I definitely won’t do anything to you.”

Finn’s body tensed up.

Did Monica misunderstand the word “do”?

“Go to sleep,” Monica said.

Finn was, in fact, a little sleepy.

He usually could not fall asleep with Monica because sometimes, when she was sleeping, he could feel her wriggling around him. As such, he had not gotten a good rest for a while now.

He closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep.

He thought that even if he could not fall asleep, he could at least calm himself down.

Just like that, he quietly calmed himself down.

......

“Finn,” Monica suddenly said.

Finn’s heart, which had finally calmed down, started beating again.

He did not know why, but the woman’s words could make his heart beat faster.

All he could do at that moment was suppress it.

“Is there really nothing between you and Patsy?” It suddenly crossed Monica’s mind.

Finn replied, “Yes.”

“Don’t lie to me.”

“Do I have to lie to you?” Finn was speechless.

Monica paused for a moment, thinking that what Finn said made sense.

He did not need to curry favor with her anyway because she had already fallen in love with him.

With that, the corners of Monica’s mouth curled into a smile.

She buried her head in Finn’s neck as she liked the familiar smell on his body. Even though it was mixed with the faint smell of medicine from the hospital, she still found it pleasant. She always thought that Finn had his own unique body fragrance.

She said, “Finn, I really love you so much.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly, and he thought, ‘Me too.’

However, he... always found it difficult to say it out loud.

In the quiet ward, Finn fell asleep, probably because he was too sleepy.

Monica, on the other hand, could not fall asleep because she had slept too much in one day. She was so energetic now that she wanted to go out for a long run.

Despite that, she turned over and looked at Finn’s sleeping face.

How could she like that person so much?

He was… Yes, he was quite good-looking.

His facial features were all good-looking, and she could not find any flaws.

She did not know whether it was because he had removed his glasses, but Finn did not feel so distant anymore.

Her fingers caressed his eyebrows, his eyes, the bridge of his nose, and his perfectly-shaped thin lips. She did not know why men’s lips could be so soft, but she really wanted to get close to them whenever she saw them.

However, when she did that, she suppressed the desire in her.

She was afraid that Finn would not be able to control herself. After all, he said he really wanted to do it.

She did not know if he really meant it, but she did. She really wanted to invade Finn’s body.

In spite of herself, she held it in.

In the quiet ward, Monica gently climbed out of Finn’s embrace, picked up the phone beside her, and then looked at the news out of boredom.

Oh? Jeannie was on the headline.

The headline was “Fourth Master Swan really loves his wife”.

Monica could not help but laugh.

She could also tell that Fourth Master Swan really loved Jeannie.

She looked at the content of the news and looked at the photos, in which Jeannie was blushing and Fourth Master Swan was looking at her affectionately.

The two of them seemed to be in a lingerie shop.

Monica glanced at Finn beside her. She believed that with Finn’s personality, he definitely would not go to a lingerie shop with her.

She might as well silently envy someone else.

However, she was a little curious. Most media outlets would not dare to report news about Fourth Master Swan, yet that piece of news was published so brazenly…

A certain someone must have deliberately published it.

Why was Fourth Master Swan so provocative?

She ate peanuts while passing the time and looked around.

After some time, Monica seemed to hear a low moaning, so she turned to look at Finn beside her. That was when she saw his slightly flushed face.

Could he have a fever?

The doctor said that during this period of time, Finn could not have a fever. Hence, she quickly stroked his forehead.

It did feel a little hot, but it was not too hot either. However, since his body was warm, she was so scared that she hurriedly pressed the call bell.

At that moment, someone suddenly grabbed her hand.

Monica was stunned to see Finn suddenly open his eyes.

The moment he opened his eyes, his eyes... were seductive. Monica did not know why, but she was embarrassed by Finn’s gaze.
