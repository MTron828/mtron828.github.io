He would only dote on her, and he really did follow through with his promise.

After they got married, Kingsley loved Lucy even more. Other than dealing with business, he basically did not leave Lucy’s side.

As their son grew up, the son started to complain about why his parents disliked him so much! To be precise, why did his father dislike him so much?

Was he not his father’s biological son? Why was it that every time he got close to his mother, his father would look at him like a tiger eyeing its prey?

At one point, he finally mustered up the courage to question his father if he was their biological son or if he was adopted. His father’s answer was: he hoped he was adopted.

What did his father mean? He was dumbfounded. Later, he found out that if he was adopted, he could be abandoned again. He was redundant in their family.

Seven years later, Jeanne left the Hills. Lucy was actually very reluctant to let her leave, so she confirmed with Kingsley many times whether he had to let Jeanne go. Kingsley’s answer was firm every time. However, the moment he saw Jeanne leave with George… his eyes reddened.

Lucy used to think that Kingsley was an emotionless man. Later on, she found that he was more than emotionless; he was too emotional, especially when it came to her.

She felt that even if she was killed by Kingsley in her previous life, she could forgive him for everything in this life. Everyone should give themselves a chance to live again. She loved Kingsley, and that was enough!

Jeanne woke up and stared at the ceiling. The scene in her mind was fixed on Lucy’s happy moment. The dream felt real, and it was really beautiful.

“Mom,” George suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne looked over to see George’s worried expression.

“You’re crying.” George looked at the tears in the corner of her eyes with a frown.

It was only at that moment that Jeanne realized that she was crying. She thought she was smiling after witnessing how happy Kingsley and Lucy were.

It seemed to have allowed her to let go of the thing she had been suppressing in her heart, even if it was just a dream.

She wiped her tears and said, “George, let’s go back.”

“Back where?” asked George.

“To your dad.”

George was surprised as he thought that his mother really wanted to leave South Hampton City with him. After all, his father had done so many things behind his mother’s back. With his mother’s personality, she would not forgive him so easily, let alone get back together with him.

“Everyone should give themselves a chance to live again,” Lucy told her.

Lucy was telling her that as long as she loved Edward, that was enough.

With that, Jeanne left the Delta Islands with George. However, before they left, they ended up visiting Kingsley and Lucy’s graves. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She looked at their graves and hoped that there was really a parallel dimension, one where they were living the same as in her dream.

“Mom,” George suddenly called out to her.

Jeanne turned her head to George, who was bent on the ground and had seemingly discovered something.

When Jeanne walked over, her eyes instantly turned red. In fact, she even burst into tears because, on the ground covered by weeds, she saw the words, “Daddy is the worst! I hate him the most!”

She bent down and touched the words on the floor. In her mind, the image of Kingsley’s son venting his anger on the ground appeared.

“Mom, do I have an uncle?” George blurted out suddenly.

The moment he said it, he was shocked by himself. He did not know why he felt that way either.

Jeanne smiled. ‘That’s right. In a parallel universe, you have an uncle who is younger than you. Their family is living a good and happy life, so let’s not disturb them.’

She held George’s hand and left the Delta Islands to go back to Bamboo Garden in South Hampton City.

In fact, they had only been gone for three days, but it felt like three years had passed since she came back.

When she walked into the hall, Teddy was dumbfounded to see her. Fourth Master said the Madam would never come back, and because of that, Fourth Master had… fallen.

He stared at Jeanne with his eyes wide open and was so shocked that he could not say a word for a long time..
