Chapter 377: Danger Level Up, Jeanne’s Ability Exposed

After that, he stood up from the ground, picked up the phone, and dialed a number.

Two other people were beside the man, both standing by his side obediently, waiting for orders.

“Sir, you’re awake. Don’t worry. I won’t make any mistakes. Although one of them is severely injured, they’re still alive. They won’t die for a while.” The man seemed to be reporting their situation to the person on the other end of the phone.

In the meantime, Finn was observing the environment here.

It was a dilapidated warehouse, but it was not the same place where Jeanne was kidnapped the last time. However, it was more or less the same. It was just an empty warehouse, so there should be nothing around the area.

Therefore, calling for help might not be possible. It might even lead to a violent beating.

However, if they could not call for help, how could they escape?

Why did those people kidnap them? Was it for money?

It would be easy if it were for money, but on second thought, it was impossible. Especially since something had happened to Edward, it could not be a coincidence.

While Finn was deep in thought, he looked at the window above the warehouse to see that it was already nighttime.

The bearded man was on the phone for a long time before he approached them again.

Finn looked at him warily, and Monica was also a little frightened.

“Are you afraid of me?” The man squatted down and looked at the two people in front of him.

......

“I have money,” Finn said quickly.

The man smiled. “Do you think I’m a robber?”

“We have no enmity, yet you kidnapped us. No matter what your motive is, you want money, right? I’ll give you double the amount the other party gives you,” Finn negotiated.

The bearded man was stunned.

“Three times is fine too,” Finn enticed him. “Just say the word, and I promise I’ll make you a happy man.”

“I’m a little tempted.” The bearded man glared at Finn. “However, as someone in this field of work, I still have to keep my word. Otherwise, no one would look for me in the future. I need a good reputation too! But more importantly, there is nothing I can do this time. If I don’t listen to the other party’s arrangements, I’ll die a horrible death.”

Finn looked at the bearded man.

From the bearded man’s words, it was clear that even if he wanted to negotiate terms, he would not be able to escape.

Did that mean he could only fight head-on? It was one against three.

He unconsciously moved his body.

Since he could not feel any pain, he did not know how serious his injuries were at first.

However, under such a serious situation, could he escape with Monica?

“I’m not going to beat around the bush with you guys. The faster I finish the job, the sooner it’ll end.” The bearded man stood up again.

Finn’s eyes narrowed.

The bearded man said, “I don’t know what you’ve done to offend the other party for them to torture you like this, but this is the first time I received such a job.”

Finn’s expression was cold.

The bearded man waved his hand. “Lift the woman on the ground.”

Finn grabbed Monica, who was so frightened that her body was trembling.

The two men at the side walked toward Monica. Then, they grabbed her body harshly and wanted to leave.

The moment they were leaving, Finn grabbed Monica’s arm tightly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

How did a man, who was about to die, have so much strength?

“Let go!” A man threatened.

Even so, Finn held on tightly with all her strength, refusing to let go.

The man gritted his teeth, kicked Finn’s arm hard, and a crack sounded like bones breaking.

“Finn!” Monica shouted.

The man had kicked Finn aside and instantly took Monica away.

Finn gritted his teeth.

He believed his arm was broken as he could not exert any strength at the moment.

Just like that, he watched as Monica was taken to the bearded man’s side.

“What are you doing? What are you doing? !” Monica looked at the person in front of her, petrified.

She could not control her tears from falling.

The bearded man was seemingly sizing up Monica, who was standing in front of him, supported by the two men.

“She’s quite good-looking,” the bearded man commented.

His eyes were fixed on her face and body, unabashed.

“What are you going to do?” Monica was a little frustrated by the bearded man in front of her, so she shouted.

“Say, what do men and women do together?” The bearded man’s hand suddenly moved closer to Monica’s face.

His thick and dirty hand caressed Monica’s face.

“You… Let go of me. Let go of me.” Monica’s face was filled with fear. She was so disgusted by the man’s caress that she was going crazy.

“Don’t scream. Otherwise, you won’t be able to scream for a while.” The man with the beard laughed evilly.

Monica stared at him fiercely, her eyes red.

“To tell you the truth, I’ve been in this line of work for more than ten years, and this is the first time I’ve encountered such a thing. It’s also the first time I’ve racked my brains to carry out a kidnapping not to silence or kill someone, but... to rape someone!” The bearded man said cruelly, “This is also my first time doing something like this, so please bear with me.”

As he spoke, he suddenly exerted force on his hand.

Monica’s clothes were instantly torn open.

“Ah!” Monica was frightened.

She looked at the bearded man’s actions in shock before seeing a strange glint appear in his eyes.

Finn, who was lying on the ground, was fuming. His eyes were red as he watched the scene in front of him.

At that moment, in a surveillance room, the scene in the warehouse was also presented before a man’s eyes.

He looked at everything in front of him coldly.

If Finn took the opportunity to leave at that moment, Finn’s identity would be suspicious.

After all, he had chosen to protect himself. If he risked his life for Monica right now…

Michael’s expression turned cold as he watched Monica break down crying.

He would not let Monica get raped. He would stop her at the crucial moment!

After that, he would definitely make it up to her.
