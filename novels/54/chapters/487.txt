Chapter 488: Jasmine’s Video Exposed, and a Slap in the Face

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Just a second ago, she was still bitter about losing her grandson. However, at that moment, when she realized that her daughter-in-law was actually so indecent in her behavior, she could not accept it!

“Didn’t you accuse me of killing your grandson?”

“It wasn’t my grandson!” Belle said firmly, “That was the bastard’s thing!”

Jeanne sneered.

She knew it. To a noble family, reputation was more important than anything else.

Since Jasmine had cheated on Eden, they definitely would not tolerate it.

Even if Jasmine had suffered a great grievance, that crushing defeat would not allow her to redeem herself again, no matter what.

Jeanne was apathetic about it. Toward Jasmine, she really could not bring herself to pity her.

She said, “No matter whose it is, Jasmine used that baby to frame me, and I need to prove myself innocent.”

Belle was fuming at that moment, and she glared at Jeanne.

Of course, she also hated that woman very much. Even if Jasmine had wronged Eden, Jeanne should not have used such a method to embarrass Eden.

Yesterday, he was humiliated at Snow Enterprise, and today, he was humiliated at home.

For that, she really wanted to kill Jeanne.

......

“First of all, George is Edward’s son. Does anyone have any objections to that?” Jeanne started to prove her innocence to everyone.

No one said anything because they did not want to admit it, but they had to. As such, they could only choose to remain silent.

Jeanne turned to look at Old Master Swan. “Dad?”

“Yes.” Old Master Swan nodded. “George is a descendant of the Swans.”

Jeanne was a little moved.

Although the truth was obvious, she did not expect that Old Master Swan would really approve of it.

Just to be safe, should they not do a paternity test?

After being stunned for a second, she said respectfully, “Thank you for your trust in me, dad.”

Old Master Swan nodded his head again.

Then, she turned around and said to the others, “So, you accusing me of being jealous of Jasmine because I couldn’t give birth to a child of the Swans and intentionally pushing Jasmine to cause Jasmine’s miscarriage obviously doesn’t stand!”

No one refuted.

Jeanne continued, “Since I have no motive, it’s Jasmine who framed me. But why would Jasmine frame me? I believe after seeing the video, everyone should understand. The video was taken the night before Eden and Jasmine’s wedding, and the man in the video was Sam Zimmer, Jasmine’s cousin. The two of them spent the night together before their wedding. According to my calculations, Eden and Jasmine have been married for more than two months, and Jasmine was also two months pregnant. To be honest, can you guys be sure whether it was two months or more?”

“No. No, I didn’t...” Jasmine still wanted to defend himself.

However, with the facts laid out in front of her now, any defense seemed futile.

Jeanne glanced at Jasmine and continued to say, “I’m afraid Jasmine didn’t even know if it was Eden’s or Sam’s, so of course, she couldn’t keep him. Since she couldn’t keep him, why didn’t she abort it behind our backs? Why did she choose to frame me? The reason is simple, and even Eden said it just now. She’s afraid I would steal the Lawrences’ assets, so she wanted to use this to get me kicked out of the Swans and the Lawrences. Since I wouldn’t have a child anyway, she might as well use it to frame me. Isn’t that killing two birds with one stone?”

“No, no...” Jasmine kept murmuring, wanting to refute and make people trust her.

Jeanne looked at Eden and said, “I don’t know if you’ve also been schemed against.”

She was mocking Eden.

She actually knew very well that Eden and Jasmine discussed the matter beforehand because Jasmine would not have the courage to do such a thing alone in the Swans. If it were not for Eden’s support, she would not have been able to do it so confidently! Moreover, Jasmine must have done that to help Eden, who naturally felt the same. Little did he expect to learn, after the matter was exposed, that Jasmine was using him to get rid of the child and making him feel that he should treat her better in the future since he owed it to her.

Eden’s expression became extremely ferocious.

Jeanne looked at Eden’s expression. With Eden’s intelligence and a little bit of advice, he would be able to understand!

Once he understood, Jasmine’s consequences would be tragic.

She looked away from Eden and asked the others, “Regarding what I just said, is there anything anyone disagrees with?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone remained silent, so Jeanne turned back to Old Master Swan and said, “What do you think, dad?”

“I’ve never doubted you from the start,” Old Master Swan assured her.

“Thank you, dad.” Jeanne smiled sweetly before turning around and asking Henry, “Big brother, what do you think?”

Henry’s expression was ferocious at that moment.

Never in his wildest dreams would he have thought that in the end, it was his family who brought disgrace upon themselves.

He could not believe that Jasmine had the guts to cuckold Eden!

That was a fact that no man could bear.

“Big brother?” Jeanne called him again. She did not think he would let the matter rest so peacefully.

Henry looked at Jeanne coldly and said, “Since you’ve put it that way, how else do you want me to agree with you? You’re deliberately making it difficult for me, aren’t you? !”

“Big brother, it’s best for you to get it clear. I’m not making it difficult for you. I’m just trying to clear my name. Otherwise, should I just accept your accusations against me as if it’s a matter of course? Now that the truth is out, you won’t acknowledge that I’m innocent?” Jeanne’s eyes turned cold. “Should I allow you to bully me?”
