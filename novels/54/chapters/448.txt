Chapter 449: Eden Humiliated, With No Place To Hide Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

He had never thought that his proud son would do such a thing!

Eden had never been such a reckless person!

He asked Eden furiously, “Are you crazy? How could you do such a thing? Do you know the consequences of abusing your power?”

He did, but he just could not bear to see Jeanne live a good life. He just wanted that woman to fall into his hands slowly and become miserable.

“Eden!” Henry was so angry that he really wanted to beat Eden to death.

After all, he was the head of the Swans and the eldest son. In front of so many of the senior management, he felt utterly humiliated!

“I had no choice. Jasmine forced my hand!” Eden looked like he was about to break down.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

That man, Eden, really knew how to find someone else to take the fall.

She looked at him coldly as he said, “Jasmine has always been jealous of Jeanne. Now that Jeanne is doing very well in Lawrence Enterprise, she’s afraid that Jeanne will be in the limelight and that Lawrence Enterprise will end up in Jeanne’s hands. That was why she asked me to help her chase Jeanne out of the Lawrence Enterprise! I love Jasmine so much that I can’t reject her request. That was why I was so muddle-headed and did such a thing!”

“How could you do everything for a woman? Was that what I taught you?” Henry scolded his son, feeling a little resentful that Eden did not live up to his expectations.

“Dad, you know Jasmine and I have a good relationship. She begged me every night...” Eden said. At that moment, he looked like he was on the verge of breaking down.

Suddenly, he had lost his previous arrogance and became extremely emotional.

......

Jeanne looked at Eden’s performance coldly, thinking about how she fell in love with Eden back then.

Was this the Eden she saw back then? How sinister and cunning he was!

Could he really betray anyone for his own benefit?

At that moment, she even pitied Jasmine a little.

Now that Eden had put all the blame on Jasmine, she would probably not live a good life from now on, be it in the Swans or the Lawrences.

Jasmine would not be able to please anybody.

Hence, she said calmly, “You mean Jasmine made you do all of this?”

Eden nodded, pushing all the blame onto Jasmine.

“You finally admit it now, huh? So, you did use your authority to give up to 270 million dollars to the Chamber of Commerce?” Jeanne asked.

Eden nodded uncomfortably.

“It’s good that you admit it. Otherwise, we will be wasting more of everyone’s time,” Jeanne said indifferently.

Eden frowned.

He had a feeling that there was another meaning to what Jeanne said.

The next second, he heard Jeanne say coldly, “Eden, go and turn yourself in!”

Eden thought he had heard wrongly and looked straight at Jeanne in complete disbelief.

The woman had done so much just to embarrass him into admitting it, but she had never thought of letting him go.

As soon as she said that, the others were also a little surprised.

Although Eden had indeed abused his power to break the law, Eden was still a member of the Swans no matter what. Therefore, they could solve the matter internally and had never thought it would go to such an extent!

Jeanne took in everyone’s gazes. “Eden’s abuse of power has caused losses to the Swan Enterprise. Now, we need to use legal means to punish Eden and get our money back from the Chamber of Commerce through the proper channels so as to minimize our losses even more.”

They had to admit that, according to the rules, that was the best solution. If it were anyone else, they would have done that without a doubt.

However, Eden was still a member of the Swans.

Even if it caused a certain amount of losses to the company, it was considered the Swans’ loss. There was no need to go so far.

Nevertheless, Jeanne did not look like she was joking as she said it with a serious face.

Eden stared fiercely at Jeanne.

At that moment, he really wanted to strangle that woman to death and take her down with him.

“Jeanne!” Henry’s voice was very loud. “Are you crazy? You want Eden to turn himself in? Do you want to destroy Eden?”

Although he hated Eden for not living up to expectations, Eden was still his son. He could not watch as Eden went to jail!

Jeanne’s eyes moved as she looked at Henry and said, “That was Eden’s choice. He should pay the price for his choice!”
