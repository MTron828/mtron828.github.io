Chapter 1792: Nox Proposes

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox disappeared for nine whole days, and no one knew where he went. However, Shelly did not doubt what Monica told her. She believed Nox had a lot of confidential matters to deal with, but no matter what, she was still a little disappointed.

According to the conditions that Nox had promised Mrs. Winter, it would be over between them tomorrow. However, Nox had disappeared. She did not know if Nox’s disappearance would change the agreement between Nox and Mrs. Winter. In fact, she could not even figure out if she wanted Nox to keep the agreement or… let her go.

Shelly sighed. Sometimes, habits could really change a person a lot, and she had gotten used to Nox.

In the afternoon, she picked Bella up from kindergarten, and the two of them were chatting and laughing on the road when they received a call from Monica.

“Monica.”

“Shelly, where are you?”

“I just picked Bella up from school, and we’re walking home now.”

“Are you available tonight? I’d like to have dinner with you.”

Shelly was surprised. She had interacted with Monica before, but they had never had a meal together.

“Don’t reject me. It’s not easy for me to have a night of freedom with the two babies pestering me. Don’t dampen my spirits.” Monica was a little domineering.

Shelly was not someone who could reject others, except for Nox, so she said, “Alright, but I have to bring Bella along. Nox isn’t here, and no one can take care of Bella.” “Of course, bring Bella along. I’ll get the chauffeur to pick you up.” “No need. I’ll just take a taxi.”

“It’S a little far. You might not be able to find it even if you take a taxi.”

Shelly was speechless and puzzled as to what Monica wanted to do. Was it not just a night of relaxation? There was a need to make such a big thing out of it!

She said, “Alright. I’ll get Bella changed, and we’ll wait for you downstairs of Nox’s apartment.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alright.” Monica agreed immediately.

After agreeing, she was so excited that she quickly called Jeanne. “Shelly is settled.”

“Alright. Just come at the given time.”

“By the way, Jeannie, do you think it’s a good idea to scheme against Shelly like this?” Monica was worried. “I’m afraid Nox will be hurt badly.”

“Isn’t that something he expects? Let’s put it this way. If Nox doesn’t do it, Nox will regret it for the rest of his life. If he does it, Nox will also regret it for the rest of his life, so…”

“So you’re just going to let Nox be, right?”

“Yes.” Jeanne nodded.

“Fine. In that case, I’ll go pick Shelly up now. See you later.”

“See you later.”

Monica hung up the phone and started to get changed into one set of clothes after another. Finn, however, could not stand it anymore. The entire walk-in closet was filled with Monica’s clothes, piled up everywhere, yet Monica was not satisfied with any of them.

“Which one do you want to wear?” Finn asked Monica as he looked at the mess in the room.

“I want to go naked!” Monica was suddenly angry.

Looking at her round and chubby self in the mirror, she felt disgusted. She thought she could return to her former body figure after giving birth, yet she was still as chubby as when she was pregnant. She wanted to go on a diet to lose weight, but her family stopped her. They even lectured her about mistreating the babies by not giving them enough to eat.

As a result, her daily appetite was even more than during her pregnancy, and she could not bare to look at herself in the mirror. She wanted to jump down from a building and end it all.

Having been yelled at by Monica, Finn felt a little helpless. He touched his nose and said, “You look good like this too. There’s beauty in being chubby”

“Why don’t you try to eat like me?” Monica lost her temper. Looking at herself in the mirror made her angry.

“I don’t get fat,” Finn said bluntly.

“so, are you here to attack meg” Monica was tuming.

Finn chuckled.

Monica got even angrier when she saw Finn laugh. If he had not gotten her pregnant, would her figure be so out of shape? How dare the culprit laugh at her?

With that thought in mind, Monica suddenly rushed over and bit down on Finn’s neck..
