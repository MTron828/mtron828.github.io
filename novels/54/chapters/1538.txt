He picked up the hairdryer again and dried Paige’s hair gently and carefully.

“Godfather, are you happy?” Even Paige could sense his joy.

“Mm,” Finn replied, not at all trying to hide it. “Are you so happy because of Godmother?”

“Yes.”

“Is my father upset because my mother ran away from home?” Paige asked.

All of a sudden, she seemed to be reminded of her father and felt a little sad.

Finn noticed Paige’s sadness and comforted her, “Don’t worry, your mother is back.”

“Really?” Paige was very excited. “I thought Mommy left with Brother and didn’t want me anymore.”

“How could your mother bear to abandon you?” Finn dried Paige’s hair and stroked her soft hair. “Your mother loves your father very, very much. Didn’t I say that before?”

“Yes.” Paige nodded emphatically. “Can I go back to see my mom now?” “Did you forget our agreement, Paige?” Finn asked.

However, she missed her mother so much… but she felt that her godfather needed her more.

She said, “Godfather, I’ll definitely help you get Godmother back.” Paige promised, and Finn was a little touched by her.

“Back then, Daddy told me to help him get Mommy like this.”

No wonder Paige’s acting skills were perfect. It also made Finn wonder if she would deceive many little boys when she grew up.

The thought of Paige getting a boyfriend and getting married in the future… He believed Fourth Master would be devastated when that happened.

While the two of them chatted, the bathroom door opened. Monica walked out wearing Finn’s T-shirt and a boxer. As she had also washed her hair, she was drying her hair with a towel as she walked out.

Fortunately, Finn’s T-shirt was big enough. Since her three-month-old belly was still not obvious, and she had not gained weight, it fit her perfectly.

“I’ll dry your hair for you,” Finn offered.

“No need-”

“Godmother, I want you to tell me a bedtime story,” Paige suddenly said. Monica was stunned. “I don’t know how to tell stories.”

“Godfather bought me a fairy tale book. Can you read it to me?” Paige looked at her expectantly.

Monica gave in and walked over to take the picture book from Paige’s hands. Paige was already under the covers, so Monica sat by the bed and read the picture book to her.

Finn naturally stood by the side and blow-dried her hair for her. The sound of the hairdryer was lowered to the lowest level so as not to disturb them. Suddenly, only Monica’s gentle voice sounded in the room, which was filled with warmth.

After a while, Monica’s hair was dry, but Finn did not interrupt them. He simply put the hairdryer into the bathroom, took Monica’s clothes, and walked out of the room.

Monica did not notice that Finn had taken away her clothes as she was very focused on reading Paige the picture book.

Just then, Paige yawned, obviously sleepy.

Monica looked at Paige’s sleepy face and coaxed her softly, “If you want to sleep, close your eyes and go to sleep.”

“I still want to hear the story.” Paige really could not keep her eyes open, but she still insisted on not sleeping.

Monica did not know why children refused to sleep.

In any case, he would not obediently close his eyes and sleep until he could not hold on any longer.

“Paige, be good.” Monica’s tone was somewhat stern.

Paige pouted and said, “I want you to kiss me, Godmother.”

Monica, of course, would not reject her request. Hence, she leaned over and planted a kiss on Paige’s forehead.

“I want Godmother to kiss me on the lips, just like how Godfather kisses Godmother.”

Upon hearing that, Monica frowned.

Paige assumed Monica did not know how to kiss her, so she quickly made a pout with her little lips, looking really cute. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After that, she said, “Godfather kissed you for a long time when you were asleep.”

Therefore, what she thought was a dream really did happen.

She looked at Paige’s innocent face, not knowing if the child was just babbling. Nevertheless, she pouted her lips and pecked Paige on the lips.

“Be good and go to sleep.”

Paige nodded and closed her eyes. Then, she fell asleep. Her ability to sleep in seconds was incredible!

Monica helped Paige with the blanket. After making sure that she was properly covered, she dimmed the lights in the room and left.

When she saw that Finn was not in the living room, she frowned and went to Finn’s room. However, he was not there either.

She thought about it for a moment before going to the laundry room, where she saw Finn washing her underwear seriously…
