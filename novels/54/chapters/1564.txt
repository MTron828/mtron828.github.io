Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Then, he started drinking with Brandon. He drank neither too much nor too little.

At first, the two of them did not speak much. However, after drinking some wine, they warmed up to each other.

“Do you know how many years I’ve liked Monica?” Brandon raised the topic.

He started feeling a little emotional as he drank. However, Finn did not reply to his question.

“I’ve liked her for my entire life. But when I was young, I had no choice but to follow my parents overseas. When I wanted to go back to South Hampton City to further my studies at a university, I found out that Monica was already in a relationship,” Brandon said and sighed. It was as if he was recalling the sadness he felt at that time.

He still could not forget the pain he felt when he found out that Monica liked Finn so much that she bought all the billboards in South Hampton City to confess to Finn.

That was why he chose to retreat and stay overseas. Then, after thinking that he had truly let go of her, he returned to South Hampton City. It was when he returned to the country and saw Monica that he fell for her again.

Men always had a kind of obsession with their first love. Even if he supported Monica and Finn as a couple, it still hurt when he thought about it.

“Do you like Monica?” Brandon suddenly asked Finn.

Finn, who was also drinking, glanced at the drunk-looking Brandon and

realized the latter was spilling his heart out because she was drunk.

‘You like her very much, right?” When Brandon did not get an answer from Finn, he continued, “How could a man not like a woman like Monica?” ‘Yes, I like her very much,” Finn suddenly said with certainty.

“If you like her, why don’t you cherish her?” Brandon questioned Finn, “Why did you hurt her like you did back then? Why did you make her feel so hopeless? How did Monica, such a cheerful and lively woman, change so much because of you?”

Finn’s throat moved. He could not refute what Brandon said about him.

As for Monica… he had indeed done many things to hurt her in the past, and when they reconciled, he did not give her enough sense of security. He did not even apologize for everything he had done in the past.

He pursed his lips. “That’s why I regret it.”

“Regret?” Brandon sneered. “Why do you get to return to Monica’s side if you regret it, but I get nothing?”

Finn clenched his fingers a little.

Things were not going as smoothly as Brandon said. Monica was still repulsed by him. Sometimes, he felt that she had changed a little, but at other times, he felt that she still rejected him.

In fact, he was also worried and afraid that Monica would be determined to take care of the babies alone.

“I really shouldn’t have come drinking with you.” Brandon suddenly said in exasperation, “I wanted to relax, but seeing you makes me even angrier. You’re simply asking for it!”

Finn listened to Brandon’s complaints. He rarely complained about anyone or anything. Most of the time, he accepted it, so he remained silent.

While he remained silent, he, who said he could not drink, suddenly realized he had drunk too much.

Seeing that it was getting late, Brandon wanted to tell Finn to leave with him.

However, as soon as he got up, he saw a pile of wine bottles beside Finn. Then, Finn collapsed on the sofa and did not move.

Brandon was speechless. Did that mean he still had to carry Finn back? He hated Finn to the core, yet he still had to take care of Finn! No other love rival would be willing to do that, but in the end, Brandon bent down and helped Finn up.

Finn was really deadweight. Although he was tall, he was thin, so where did the weight on his body come from?

Brandon used all his strength to help Finn back to the room. Instinctively, he helped Finn to Monica’s room. He really did not mean to matchmake them. He was just drunk, and that was why he carried Finn to Monica’s place.

When he knocked on the door roughly, it was already past midnight. Monica had also fallen asleep, and she was suddenly woken up by a knock on the door. She heard Brandon’s voice from outside. “Monica, open the door.”

Thinking something had happened to Brandon, Monica quickly got up to open the door.

The moment she opened the door, she could smell the strong smell of alcohol. Then, she saw Finn being supported by Brandon, who was drunk.

“Monica, here’s Finn. Good night,” Brandon said in a daze.

After that, he pushed Finn to Monica. Monica quickly caught Finn, whose weak body leaned against her. It took Monica a lot of effort to lift Finn up.

She watched as Brandon opened his room door shakily and went inside to sleep.

‘F*ck.’ Monica was infuriated.

Since Finn was drunk, why did Brandon send Finn here instead of his room? She was really speechless.

At that moment, she helped Finn into her room. With her current physical strength, it was impossible for her to carry a heavy man like Finn back to his room, and she did not want to have a miscarriage.

She zritted her teeth and placed Finn on her bed. Seeinz him so drunk, she

really was pissed off.

He was the one who said he was here to ensure her safety. Now that he was so drunk, even if something happened to her, he would be dead asleep!

The thought of it infuriated Monica, but she still leaned over and helped Finn take off his clothes. Looking at his flushed face and him tugging uncomfortably at his shirt, tie, and suit, she knew that he was feeling extremely uncomfortable.

The first thing she did was help him undo his tie. After that, she lowered her head to help him undo his buttons.

Just as she was taking off his clothes, she suddenly felt a burning gaze staring at her. She turned around, only to see that Finn had woken up at some point and was staring straight at her. He did not even blink.

“You’re awake?” Monica asked.

At that moment, she did not want to serve him anymore. It was the middle of the night, and she was having a good sleep. Moreover, she was pregnant. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I’m not awake,” Finn muttered, his eyes still looking at her. “If I wake up, I probably won’t be able to see Monica treating me so well.”

Monica’s heart skipped a beat. How badly did she treat him?

“It’s not that she’s bad to me. She just won’t take the initiative to get close to me anymore,” Finn mumbled to himself.

At that moment, he seemed to be answering her inner thoughts. Monica pursed her lips and urged, “Go and take a shower. You smell like alcohol.”

“I don’t want to move.” Finn shook his head, a little shameless.

“You smell. Why don’t you want to take a shower?” Monica’s face was full of disgust.

“I don’t feel well, and I don’t want to move,” Finn explained.

“You’ll feel better after taking a shower.”

“I won’t feel comfortable even after taking a shower.” Finn pointed at his heart and said, “It’s always uncomfortable here.”

Monica could not care less about Finn anymore. He was drunk and could not speak clearly, and she did not want to be affected by him in any way.

“Monica.” Finn suddenly pulled her back.

Monica was at a loss for words. Why was Finn so annoying when he was drunk?

“Can I kiss you?” Finn suddenly said.

Monica’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. She wondered, ‘Is Finn really drunk?

“I really want to kiss you.”

As he spoke, he even got up from the bed and leaned his rosy cheeks closer to

Monica.

Monica was stunned.

Then, she heard Finn, who reeked of alcohol, say again, “I’m really going crazy..”
