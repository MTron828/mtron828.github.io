Chapter 781: Eden’s Regret, A Tragic End

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The fact that he could think of how to protect himself at the first moment when something happened, that calmness and strong thinking ability was beyond ordinary people.

One day, Monica would fall into Michael’s hands.

Jeanne turned to Nox. “Let’s head back.”

“Are you giving up?” Nox asked.

“He should be dead,” Jeanne said bluntly.

Moreover, she said it so calmly and peacefully. It was as if she was saying it was getting late and that it was time to home for dinner.

On the other hand, Jasmine, who had been sitting next to Jeanne, jerked.

Jeanne noticed it, so she turned her head and glanced at Jasmine.

Jasmine asked, “Is Eden dead?”

“Still can’t bear to give up on him?” Jeanne’s tone was neither warm nor cold.

“I’ve long given up on him. I just didn’t think that he would die so quickly,” Jasmine said bluntly.

Jeanne did not say much as she did not like Jasmine either. She only helped Jasmine today because they happened to share the same interests.

She did not need to be grateful for Jasmine’s gesture of helping her.

With that, she asked Jasmine, “Where do you want to go now?”

She was going to send Jasmine away.

After getting what they both wanted, it was only normal for them to go their separate ways.

The greatest mercy she could give Jasmine was to never see each other again.

As for how Jasmine was going to survive after losing everything, that was for her to figure out.

“Send me to the police station,” Jasmine said.

She wanted to see Jenifer.

Jeanne did not say anything and told Nox to drive to the police station.

On the way there, Jeanne’s phone rang.

She lowered her head to take a look, and her eyes paused for a moment. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Having noticed Qiao Mo’s strange behavior, Nox narrowed his eyes.

Jeanne pursed her lips.

At that moment, an unknown number was calling her, and it made her suspicious.

Hence, she calmed herself down and answered the call.

Eden’s voice came from the other end of the phone. He said, “Jeanne, I heard you’ve mobilized all the Sanders’ armed forces to arrest me.”

“Where are you?” Jeanne tightened her grip on her phone.

Beside her, Jasmine reacted to it as well.

Nox’s attention was also focused on Jeanne.

“Where am I? I’m about to leave Harken and get away with it. Before I leave, I just want to tell you, don’t even think about catching me! Did you think that by ruining my reputation and having Jasmine’s family expose me, my life would be over? This is not the last of him. I’m going overseas to lay low for now, but I’ll come back one day. I’ll come back to kill you one day!”

“Do you know you’re about to die?!” Jeanne said fiercely.

She was angry at Eden’s stupidity.

“I’m going to die? Ha!” Eden sneered. “I’m about to leave Harken’s borders. Who would come to kill me?! You probably can’t think of how I’ll leave, right? Do you think I can’t leave just because you’ve blocked all the roads and stopped all planes, trains, and cars? What a joke!”

“I’ll remind you for the last time. You’d better return to South Hampton City right now, or you’ll definitely die!” Jeanne enunciated each word clearly, not threatening him.

“Come back? What nonsense are you talking about? If I didn’t anticipate that you would capture me today, you would’ve caught and killed me. Do you think I’d come back to wait for you to send me to prison?” Eden had a smug look on his face as he said, “I’m calling you to tell you that I’ll be free soon. I’ll leave Harken and be a free man! Don’t even think about killing me or sending me to jail!”

“Eden, is Michael helping you to leave?” It was Eden’s own problem that he was stupid and wanted to court his own death.

The only reason why she wanted to arrest him was to get evidence against Michael.

At that moment, she also turned on her phone’s recording mode.

“What are you trying to get out of me?” Eden sneered.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

She hoped Eden would be stupid instead of trying to be a smarty-pants.

“Michael wants to kill you,” Jeanne said bluntly.

“Heh! Are you trying to scheme against me again?”

“I’m telling the truth.” Jeanne tried to calm herself down. “Michael has gotten someone to take you away so that he can kill you to protect himself, yet you think that he’s helping you. Think about it. Why is he helping you? Is it really because of your friendship? Let me ask you this. If something happened to Michael, would you risk breaking the law to help him?”
