He was able to do it because Jonathan had encroached on his interests!

“Jeannie, are you listening?” Monica was a little nervous.

No matter the relationship between Jeanne and the Lawrences, Jonathan’s death should make her feel bad.

“I heard you. I’m going back to the Lawrences to take a look.”

“I’ll go with you.”

“No need. It’s too late. You should rest early.”

“I won’t be able to sleep for a while anyway, so I’ll go with you. You don’t have to pick me up. I’ll just take a cab there myself,” Monica hurriedly said.

Jeanne could not reject Monica’s kindness. After all, in Monica’s heart, she was supposed to feel terrible.

She said, “I’ll pick you up. Give me the address.”

“Okay.” Monica sent the address to Jeanne.

Jeanne took a look and got up to get changed.

As she left, she called Kingsley. “Jonathan is dead. He fell to his death. Take a look at the surveillance footage and send me the evidence.”

“Okay.”

After that, Jeanne hung up the call and called Miles. “I just sent you the address. Pick up Monica first and then me before we go to the Lawrence family’s manor.”

“Did something happen?” Miles was on alert.

“Someone from the Lawrences is dead. Let’s go watch the show.”

“...”

Was the Lawrences not Jeanne’s family?

Jeanne waited in Bamboo Garden for half an hour until Miles brought Monica, who was still in a cast, to pick her up.

Jeanne had just gotten into the car when she heard Monica’s unusually excited voice say, “Jeannie, are you alright?”

What was there not to be alright about?

She had been looking forward to this day.

However, she said, “I’m alright.”

“I don’t even know what happened. Why would he suddenly fall down the stairs? Doesn’t the manor have an elevator? Why did he take the stairs?” Monica thought it was a little strange.

Jeanne did not answer.

“If you’re so old, you’ll definitely know that you’ll fall to your death. Sigh.” Monica sighed.

In Monica’s heart, no matter how evil the Lawrences were, they did not deserve to die.

Jeanne kept quiet and did not say much.

At that moment, she looked out of the window and was thinking about some things. When the Lawrences wanted to kill her mother, were they as unscrupulous and merciless?

She looked like she was in a low mood.

Monica thought she was still a little sad, so after yapping on for a while, she chose to accompany her quietly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Soon, the car arrived at the Lawrence family’s manor, and a lot of reporters were already crowding the the manor’s entrance.

Jeanne frowned.

Did Alexander call so many reporters over to show his grief over Jonathan’s death?

Did he not know that the more he acted that way, the worse his fate would be?

Monica looked at the reporters at the door and was a little speechless. “Don’t these media people sleep? What’s there to be enthusiastic about a dead person?”

The car finally drove into the Lawrence family’s manor under the siege of the reporters.

In the dark, a reporter followed the car and sneaked in when the door opened.

Jeanne noticed it at a glance.

Actually, it was not that she did see the reporter. It was the security guard at the manor’s entrance who pretended not to have seen the man.

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

What tricks was Alexander trying to pull this time?

The car stopped at the entrance of the main hall, and quite some cars were parked on the compound.

As soon as Alexander’s personal social media platform released the news, many people naturally received the news. Business people were best at socializing, and since this was also a way for them to network, quite a number of people came.

When Jeanne and Monica walked into the hall, quite a few people were inside.

At that moment, the hall had been made into a funeral hall.

On the huge wall hung a standard photo of Jonathan’s face when he was alive, but the photo was now in black and white.

At the bottom of the photo was an ice coffin with Jonathan lying inside.

There were staff members around the ice coffin arranging flowers for the funeral. Most likely, the setup had not been completed yet.

However, the rest of the things in the hall had been moved away. With the mournful music playing in the background and everyone at the scene wearing black clothes and a solemn expression, the moment they walked in, the sorrowful atmosphere hit them.

Monica felt very uncomfortable.

She could not help but look at Jeanne, who looked calm and had no reaction to it at all.

She did not know when Jeanne had become so powerful.
