Chapter 265: Fourth Master Swan Treats Jeanne

If Jeanne ended up not being able to wait until Edward showed up, it would be her fate.

She would not blame anyone.

Just like when Fourth Master Swan said he was late when he arrived, she only shook her head to indicate that it was not too late.

There was no obligation for him. It was only right that he did not show up.

However, at that moment.

When Jeanne suddenly felt a piercing pain on her back, she still let go of her lip and bit on the back of Fourth Master Swan’s hand.

The pain made her bite down on Fourth Master Swan’s hand.

Her whole body tensed up.

At that moment, her body trembled.

She even had hallucinations for a few seconds. It was so painful that she almost fainted. She did not know how much strength she had used to bite on Fourth Master Swan’s arm to force herself to endure it.

Monica stood at the side and watched in horror.

When she saw Finn rip open the skull-like wound on Jeanne’s back with a pair of pliers and saw the flesh and blood inside, she felt dizzy. Monica was frightened by the cruel scene in front of her, and her face turned pale.

She did not dare to look anymore.

She was afraid that if she continued to look, she would faint more easily than Jeanne.

Monica had never felt that she was dizzy from seeing blood, but at this moment, when she saw the clear water basin filled with blood and Jeanne’s mangled body, she felt that she could not even stand properly.

She silently shifted her gaze and sat in a corner, her eyes bloodshot as she waited for Jeanne to be treated.

It did not take long.

Finn finished stitching up Jeanne’s wound and bandaged it.

He finished treating the most troublesome wound.

Finn continued to treat Jeanne’s other wounds.

Jeanne had many wounds.

There was blood everywhere, and there were wounds everywhere.

Finn moved his fingers down.

“Let me do it,” Edward suddenly said.

Finn nodded.

He also knew that there were many private places where it was inconvenient for him.

Finn prepared the medicine to treat the wounds for Edward before standing up to make room for Edward to treat Jeanne’s subsequent wounds more easily.

He stood up and heard a noise at the door.

Finn turned his head and saw Nox being carried back by Teddy. Teddy could not help but say, “Fourth Master, Young Master Winter is quite seriously injured...”

“I’ll go take a look,” Finn said.

Edward nodded.

Finn walked out of the room.

He said to Teddy, “Leave Nox to me. Go to the living room and bring me another medicine box.”

“Okay.” Teddy quickly nodded.

Finn helped Nox into the room next door and placed him on the bed.

He took off Nox’s clothes bit by bit.

Under his clothes, there were traces of whips, each of them very deep.

One could imagine how much force was used to hit him.

“Was it your grandfather who hit you?” Finn asked as he looked at Nox.

Nox was in so much pain that he did not even want to speak. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After being beaten up by his grandfather, he was thrown into the Swans’ wall room and left to fend for himself.

He seriously suspected that he was adopted by the Winters.

Otherwise, how could Wade let his grandson work for others and even beat him to death?

The more Nox thought about it, the more he felt that he was adopted by his grandfather from the trash.

Finn saw that Nox was in so much pain that he could not speak, so he did not say anything more.

Teddy had brought the medical kit up.

Finn asked Teddy to cooperate with him and help Nox with his wounds.

Teddy looked at Nox’s wounds and was so scared that he did not dare to breathe. Nevertheless, at this moment, he still noticed Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones’s hands were obviously badly mutilated, but he was helping someone else with the treatment.

He could not help but ask, “Dr. Jones, how are your hands?”

Finn seemed to cast a sidelong glance at him.

“I’ll treat him first, then I’ll deal with myself. Otherwise, it won’t be convenient once I have bandages.”

Teddy was moved by Dr. Jones.

In fact, Teddy was saved by Old Master Swan. For a long time, he had been on Old Master Swan’s side. He grew up with servants. Later, Old Master Swan asked him to follow Fourth Master Swan and take care of his daily life. He had not been by the fourth master’s side for many years, but from the moment he followed him, he knew that Fourth Master, Young Master Winter, and Dr. Jones had an extraordinary relationship.

Finn was very serious about helping Nox with his wounds.

Nox’s heart and lungs were twisted from enduring the pain.

He was fine every time he was beaten up, but every time he was bandaged by Finn, he felt excruciating pain.
