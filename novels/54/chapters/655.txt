Chapter 656: The Relationship Between Edward and Jeanne Started When She Was in the Womb!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward put out her cigarette. “Continue.”

“According to the investigation, before Penelope left the Hills, the Hills wanted her to marry the Sanders to strengthen the Hills’ power. Do you know who Penelope was going to marry?” Nox raised his eyebrows.

Edward did not answer.

He usually only needed an answer.

“Not the current leader, but the younger brother of the leader, Joseph Sanders, the most talented and capable man in the Sanders was said to be a candidate for the leader!” Nox said, “But later, the former leader of the Sanders eventually passed the position to the current leader, who was less qualified. I’m not sure the specific reason, but it was said that the eldest son should inherit the position.”

“It shouldn’t be that simple.” Edward was certain.

“I also don’t think that’s all to it. After all, it concerns the affairs of a country. The leader should choose the most outstanding candidate. But now, with Joseph dead at an early age, It’s difficult to find out the reason. And my investigation has reached a bottleneck.” Nox seemed a little helpless.

Edward nodded his head.

“I’ve basically sorted out the mafia matters. Edward, you should consider your relationship with Jeanne,” Nox reminded him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“Jeanne is the eldest daughter of the Hills. According to the current situation, with Kingsley not married and no children, Jeanne is the successor of the Hills. Once she takes over the Hills, based on the current relationship between the Hills and the Sanders...” Nox hit the nail on the head. “You and Jeanne are enemies.”

Edward remained expressionless, and Nox could not tell what he was thinking.

However, Nox did not force Edward to make a decision. In any case, Edward was more rational than anyone else.

Nox sighed. “What you worried about has come true. Ms. Lawrence is just the daughter of a family in Harken. How could she be related to the famous Hills in the Delta Islands? How could Alexander, Jeanne’s father, have deserved the eldest daughter of the Hills? Jeanne’s mother must’ve been blind too. Edward, I went to investigate what Penelope looked like because how ugly could a woman like her be to fall in love with a trashy man like Alexander? However, Jeanne looks very alike to her mother. Not to mention back then, but even now, her mother is unmatchable.”

“I know.” Edward nodded.

“You know?”

“I’ve met Jeanne’s mother a few times before,” Edward said.

“Didn’t you train with us at the base when you were young? When did you have the time to meet Jeanne’s mother? I’ve never even met her. I think the first time I met Jeanne’s mother was at her funeral, where there was a black and white photo in the hall. But because it was a photo of a dead person, I don’t think I looked at it.”

“When Jeanne was born,” Edward suddenly said.

“Huh?” Nox was a little confused.

“When I was four years old and before I went to the base. Eden happened to be born that year, so I followed my big brother to the hospital to visit Eden. That was the time I met Jeanne’s mother. She had a big belly and seemed to be in the hospital to deliver her baby.” Edward could not remember it all.

After all, he was very young at that time.

However, he could still remember some of the scenes clearly.

At that time, the Swans gathered in the ward and teased Eden, who was just born. Since he had nothing to do, he walked out of the ward and met a pregnant woman with a big belly in the corridor.

The pregnant woman called out to him, “Fourth Master Swan.”

He did not know that woman back then, but because she called his name, he stopped to look at her.

He heard her say, “Can you help me buy an ice cream at the snack bar?”

Edward was stunned by what she said.

He was now four years old and had never been ordered around.

Many people would treat him with respect when they looked at him, much less order him around.

“Look at my belly and how much of a struggle it is for me. Can you help me buy one?” Penelope pointed at her round belly.

“Why don’t you ask your family to buy one for you?” Although he was four years old, his father’s strict education made him much more mature than his age, and he was even on guard.

“Because I have no family,” Penelope answered nonchalantly.
