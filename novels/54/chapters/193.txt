Chapter 194: Jeanne Backs Her Team and Finds the Key to Her Case

Jeanne smiled. She was also a little touched.

She and her team members did not spend much time together. She thought that their relationship was built on business and money, but she did not expect that they would become so close.

Jeanne said, “I won’t let you down.”

“Okay.” Mandy nodded firmly.

“Now, there’s something I need to ask you.” Jeanne brought up the main topic. “Are you familiar with Adrian Zimmer, the chief engineer of the Lawrence Enterprise’s construction department?”

Everyone on the project team looked at each other and shook their heads.

Forrest said, “Chief Engineer Zimmer is a high-level leader. It’s difficult for us to get in touch with him.”

“Have you heard about him and who he’s familiar with?”

“I’m really not sure,” Forrest replied, “Besides, the construction department is not in our main office building. Sometimes we only see people from that department during meetings. I’m not familiar with them.”

“But...” Amy suddenly said.

Jeanne’s eyes moved. “You know him?”

Amy responded, “Well, when I first joined the company, there was a dinner party for a few employees who liked to drink at the nightclub. They would usually ask the female employees who have just joined the company to join...”

Her face was a little red as she said this.

Amy was the kind of girl who could be considered pure and pretty.

It was normal for her to be called out to drink in the workplace.

“Chief Engineer Zimmer often spent time with those people. When I was there, he was there. He seemed to be the leader of those people. I also saw him with another senior leader of the company...” Amy paused again. She seemed to have mustered up her courage as she continued, “They even flirted with the female employee who joined the company with me.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Amy continued, “I was also frightened at the time, so I sneaked away. Later, when someone asked me to go again, I didn’t go. After all, I have a boyfriend. However, I occasionally heard gossip in the secretarial department that Deputy Director Lawrence has been hanging out with those people ever since he joined the company.”

It turned out that Adrian and Joshua really had some connections.

Amy sighed again. “I don’t know if that’s the reason I haven’t had any development in the general affairs department’s secretarial department since then. On the contrary, the female employee who joined the company with me has now become the secretary-general.”

“You mean Luna.”Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

Amy nodded. “Yes. It’s an unspoken rule in the workplace. I shouldn’t bring it up, but I’m afraid that it’ll affect your case, Director Lawrence.”

“What’s Luna’s business ability like?” Jeanne asked.

“Although she rose to her position through unspoken rules, she still has her abilities. Hence, even though many people know some things about her, no one really says anything.”

Jeanne nodded and was deep in thought.

‘The secretarial room of the general affairs department. The secretary-general…’

Normally, contracts came from the contract records room under the secretarial room.

Could the dual contract have been done by Luna?

“Director Lawrence?” Amy called out to Jeanne.

Jeanne came back to her senses.

“Okay, I got it. There’s nothing else. You can go back to your work. If you run into anything, you can call me—” Jeanne suddenly remembered.

Her phone was still in the detention center.

She had been busy and had to go get it.

It was not convenient without a phone.

Thinking of this, she dismissed the meeting and went straight to the general affairs department.

Just as she walked into the department, she met Bryce, the senior president of the general affairs department.

Bryce saw her and was extremely sarcastic.

He asked, “Oh, if it isn’t Ms. Lawrence. Aren’t you being detained? You were bailed out so quickly? Being rich makes one willful indeed!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jeanne glanced at him and turned around to leave.

Bryce’s face darkened.

‘She’s still so arrogant. She really doesn’t know what is good for her!’

Jeanne walked into the contract archive room under the secretarial office and said to the staff member, “I need the contract archive for the Lawrence Enterprise’s tender for the logistics warehouse. I also need the electronic process list.”

The staff member glanced at Jeanne and answered in a businesslike manner, “I need a signature from a leader.”

“Who?”

“I need the secretary-general’s signature in order to register and receive the relevant contract document.”

Jeanne immediately turned around and walked toward the secretary-general’s office. She knocked on the door.

“Please come in.”

Jeanne pushed the door open and entered.

Luna looked at Jeanne and was a little surprised.

The next second, she hurriedly smiled and greeted her, “Director Lawrence, please take a seat.”

As expected, she was the secretary-general. She was especially tactful.

“There’s no need for that. I’m here to ask for a contract for the construction of the logistics warehouse.”

“Sure. Wait a moment. I’ll get the staff to bring it over for you right away.” Luna was very attentive.

“Thank you.”

Luna left.

After leaving the office, she took a look at Jeanne. She picked up her phone and immediately called Joshua, but his phone was turned off. After thinking for a moment, she called Adrian instead. “Director Zimmer, Jeanne is here to get the contract for the contractor.”

“What does she want to do?” The voice from the other side was very cold.

“She probably wants to see if there are any loopholes.”

“You personally handled the contract. Do you think there’s a problem?” The other party asked.

“Don’t worry, there’s definitely no problem.”

“Then show it to her and let her give up on this idea.”

“Okay.”

After Luna finished, she found the contract and walked into the office with a laptop in her arms. At the same time, she asked someone to make a cup of coffee. As she put down the document, she said, “I heard that you like to drink black coffee without sugar.”

“Thank you.” Jeanne nodded slightly.

‘This woman is quite experienced in the industry.’

Jeanne took the document without batting an eyelid and looked at it carefully.

Luna opened up the approval process of the contract for her. The contract system had all electronic documents.

Jeanne looked at the contract archive while checking if it was consistent with the electronic documents.

She was only trying to confirm the contents of the list of materials provided by the successful supplier at that time. She wanted to know if those contents could be changed midway.

The contract watermark could be forged, but the electronic flow in the system could not be faked. As long as documents were uploaded to the electronic flow, they could not be deleted or changed unless the relevant flow was re-established. Obviously, Jeanne did not see any re-application to change the contract.

She looked at it for a while.

Luna was waiting with a smile on her face.

After Jeanne looked at it and confirmed that there was no tampering with the contract, she handed it to Luna.

“Director Lawrence, have you finished reading it?”

“Yes,” Jeanne answered.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” Luna asked. She seemed very polite.

Jeanne took a sip of coffee and was not in a hurry to leave. She asked, “Was this contract drawn up by you?”

“It was drawn up by me and the company’s lawyer. I’ll personally participate in most large contracts. Otherwise, I won’t be able to rest assured.”

“The contract was drawn up very well.”

“Thank you, Director Lawrence, for your affirmation.”

“I’ll be leaving first.”

“I’ll send you off.”

“There’s no need for that.”

Jeanne left.

The moment she left, the corners of her mouth curled up into a smile.

She did not realize that there was a problem with the contract, but she suddenly realized that the method used for this contract was exactly the same as the one for the dual contract.

There was no need to guess. They must have all been done by Luna.

With this, her direction of investigation became even clearer.

Jeanne did not delay any further and directly left the Lawrence Enterprise.

As Jeanne’s car was still under repair, Miles was sent to pick her up. Moreover, at a critical moment, she needed another person to help her. She was afraid that something unexpected would happen.

Before returning to the Lawrences’ manor, Miles directly drove to the detention center, only to learn that Jeanne’s phone had been sent to Fourth Master Swan.

Jeanne hesitated again and again. Taking the risk of her legs being broken by Kingsley, she let Miles send her to the Swans’ Bamboo Garden.
