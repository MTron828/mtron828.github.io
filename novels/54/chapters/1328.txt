1329 Chloe Slapped in the Face

Candice had seen everything that Chloe had done tonight, but she closed one eye to it. She just did not want Edward to witness the scene of them sisters fighting. That would be unsightly, so she endured it. Moreover, it was that feeling, that deep-rooted feeling that Chloe could never withstand a single blow.

Chloe was not a threat to her at all.

However, she did not expect that Edward would solve her troubles instead. From the moment Chloe fawned over Edward and deliberately served him at dinner, Edward had already reminded Chloe to know her limits, but she was still thinking too highly of herself.

She deserved to be slapped in the face at this moment.

Candice did not bat an eyelid. She picked up a fruit fork and took a piece of dragon fruit for Edward. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly. “Try it.”

Edward nodded slightly.

She seemed to see the smile on his lips. It was obvious.

He opened his mouth and ate the dragon fruit that Candice fed him. The awkward atmosphere had been smoothed out, but Chloe’s expression was extremely ugly. This was the first time Candice had dealt a blow to her when it came to men.

Ever since she was young, she had admitted that she was not as capable as Candice. Whether it was her grades, talents, or other aspects, even if Candice was by Wyatt’s side all year round and spent too much time participating in various training camps, under such circumstances, Candice’s abilities were still much better than Chloe’s. Chloe knew that she could not compare to Candice in this aspect, so she had never put in any effort here.

She would instead make herself likable and make her elders and men like her. Her efforts seemed to have been very successful for so many years.

She could not accept it and fell into Edward’s hands. Her pride would not allow it. However, because of Edward’s frankness just now, she did not dare to do anything. She could only behave herself and look at the warmth shared between Edward and Candice.

Chloe gritted her teeth. In the end, what right did Candice have to be liked by Edward?

No matter how twisted Chloe’s heart was, she became much more composed after hearing Claire’s words and Candice’s act.

“I’m here today not only for dinner but also to talk about my wedding with Candice that’s happening in a week.” Edward changed the topic.

Finally, they got to the main topic.

Wyatt quickly echoed, “Let’s go with your arrangements. We’ll cooperate fully.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Edward nodded slightly. For Wyatt’s sake, he did not behave too formally.

Perhaps he was really used to acting this way. He even had to keep a distance from people at all times. It was impossible for him to suddenly become approachable.

He added, “The wedding ceremony and the banquet will be carried out according to the traditional ceremony of the Chief of Harken. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is already doing its best to prepare. Basically, the preparation is complete, with some minor details which require your attention.”

“Sure thing, I’ll look into it,” Wyatt quickly agreed.

“Then, I’d like to talk about the betrothal gift,” Edward said bluntly.

Wyatt declined without hesitation. “No need, there’s no need for those. I don’t need your betrothal gifts. Candice marrying you is a great honor for our Nicholson family. There’s no need for betrothal gifts.”

“That’s speaking too highly of me. Candice marrying me has never been out of my league. Instead, I’m very fortunate to be able to have this marriage after experiencing so many marriages. According to the tradition of Harken, there will definitely be betrothal gifts, and I’ve already prepared them,” Edward said firmly.

Naturally, no one dared to refute his words.

Wyatt smiled and agreed. “Then I’ll accept it.”

Edward nodded and raised his hand. The assistant beside him quickly took out an exquisite document and placed it in front of Wyatt. “Take a look.”

Wyatt opened it. Claire was also looking at the list of betrothal gifts with interest.

The betrothal money was not much, it was just an auspicious number, while others were just some real estate; they looked pretty common.

With Edward’s status, it was not ostentatious, but it was definitely not perfunctory.

These were only for the Nicholsons as it was a completely different list for Candice.

Wyatt seemed to have seriously looked at it a few times, thinking that he had seen it wrongly.

He hesitated for a while before finally asking, “Edward, will you give Candice all 60% of your shares in Winter Corporation?”
