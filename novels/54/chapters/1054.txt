1055 Finn Gets Angry And Nox Attacks

Sarah only told her that they were on her way and did not dare to tell her aunt that her cousin was still taking a shower as if nothing had happened.

Finally, Monica opened the bathroom door.

When she saw that Sarah was waiting for her outside, she did not have much of an expression.

She went into the closet to get changed.

After all, she still had to work tomorrow and would be spending the night in the hospital instead of coming back home.

That was why she needed to dress more formally. She chose a white shirt, a pair of loose-fitting pants, and a black trench coat.

The trench coat had a belt, so she casually put it on.

The moment she put it on, she could not help but look at herself in the mirror.

Her face was pale, her forehead was still stained with some blood, and her body was densely covered with bite marks.

Michael’s words “as thin as a ghost” suddenly appeared in her mind.

The belt on her trench coat could almost be wrapped twice around her waist.

“Monica!” Sarah could not take it anymore. “Can you hurry up? What if something happens to your dad?! Your mom is scared to death over there.”

Monica turned to look at Sarah with still no emotion on her face.

She just felt that her mother should learn to accept unexpected events calmly.

With that, Monica walked out of the closet, left the villa, and drove a small car to the hospital.

Sarah naturally went with Monica.

There were many times when she wanted to urge her cousin to hurry up, but her cousin was just taking her time.

The car finally stopped in the hospital’s underground parking lot.

As soon as Sarah got out of the car, she quickly ran to the elevator and went to the emergency room.

Monica arrived slightly later.

At that moment, Ruby, Ron, and Sarah, who had just arrived, were outside the operating theatre. They were extremely anxious.

Monica walked over unhurriedly.

Ruby’s face was filled with anxiety and fear. When she saw her daughter, she became even more agitated.

She stepped forward and suddenly shouted at Monica, “Why are you only here now? What if something happened to your father?! Why are you only here now?”

Monica chose to remain silent.

“If anything happens to your dad, I-I-I...” As she spoke, Ruby hit Monica’s body as if she was venting her anger.

Ron quickly went over to hold Ruby back. “Sister, I’m sure Monica was very busy today. Don’t be like this. Besides, she smells of alcohol, so she must have had some socializing to do.”

“What is she busy on? If Cardellini Enterprise is going to go bankrupt, so be it. I don’t care anymore. I don’t care at all! I just want our family to be together. That’s all I want. I don’t want her to be so busy. I don’t want her to go to the company, and she can’t change that!” Ruby shot her mouth off.

She was probably fuming and mentally breaking down from not being able to accept the fact that Monica had not appeared at the hospital at the first moment.

In fact, Monica understood why her mother was acting like that.

Before she started working, she was just like her mother. She had scoffed at the so-called company and the Cardellinis pharmaceutical. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She would even complain that her father had put in too much effort but spent too little time with them for such a lousy company.

However, now that she was working in the company, she could finally understand what her father felt.

Sometimes, one just had no control over the situation.

She did not want to live his life like this. He didn’t want to be suppressed by others until he couldn’t climb up. He didn’t want to be resigned to this!

“Mom, I’m sorry.” Monica suddenly apologized.

She did not sound emotional, but the guilt in her voice was clear.

What she felt guilty about was that she suddenly seemed to have seen through life and death.

She suddenly was not as emotional about her father’s illness and his life and death as her mother.

She even felt that being alive was not necessarily a very good thing.

However, she did not dare to say it out loud. If she did, her mother would not be able to accept it.

Nevertheless, she still hoped that everyone could live a good life.

Just then, the door to the emergency room opened, and Finn walked out from inside.

Ruby was extremely scared.

She stared straight at Finn and did not dare to speak. She was afraid of hearing any bad news.

Finn took the initiative to walk in front of them and said, “Uncle’s life isn’t in danger for the time being. There was just an unexpected abnormal reaction in his heart today, which caused his body to suddenly go into brief shock that is difficult to explain with the current medical science. But now, everything has returned to normal.”
