Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She got out of the car for no reason and saw how nervous Finn was in the dark.

“What’s wrong?” Monica was a little worried. “Are you feeling unwell? Do you need me to send you to the hospital?”

“Just walk with me for a while.”

“What’s wrong with you?” Monica looked at him, feeling that Finn was completely different from before.

Finn did not answer her either. Instead, he held her hand and suddenly walked toward the square.

“Finn, if you’re not feeling well, go to the hospital. Don’t-

Before she could finish her sentence, the entire square suddenly lit up as if the entire city had suddenly woken up.

Monica was stunned. She watched as Finn’s face suddenly appeared on the bright LED screen in front of her. At that moment. she instantlv understood something and stared straight at the screen.

On the screen, Finn looked a little nervous. He took a deep breath before he said, “Monica, do you still remember 10 years ago when you bought all the billboards to celebrate my birthday? Actually, at that time, I was very touched, but because I didn’t know how to express it, I chose to remain silent. Perhaps it was because of my silence that we drifted apart. After thinking about it carefully, I realized that when we were together, it was always you who put more effort into the relationship. If I had taken the initiative a little, so many unhappy things wouldn’t have happened between us.”

If he had taken the initiative and asked about Monica and Michael’s relationship at the first moment back then, Michael would not have interfered. Then, so many things would not have happened. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The root of everything seemed to have started from his inferiority complex.

He said, “I’ve had many regrets, and now, my only hope is to make up for the harm I’ve caused you. Monica, when I was recording this video, I was actually very nervous. I didn’t know if you would forgive me. I didn’t even know if you would like it. I also didn’t know if it would cause you any trouble. I actually recorded this many times, but every time, I didn’t think it was good enough. Every time, I was worried that I wouldn’t look good on screen and that you would despise me.”

Monica’s lips suddenly curled into a smile, and her eyes were filled with tears. She could see how helpless Finn was on the screen. She had never thought that a man like Finn would choose to confess to her so publicly and in front of the entire country.

“Monica.”

Finn, on the screen, looked at her with a serious expression. When their eyes met, Finn asked deeply and affectionately, “Will you marry me?”

Monica’s throat moved slightly. Her emotions were getting out of control.

He said, “I will definitely be a good husband, father, and son-in-law. I will definitely take good care of you, the babies, and your parents. I hope you can give me another chance to love you.”

His voice sounded a little choked.

Monica’s vision was already blurry, so she could not see if Finn’s eyes were red when he said that. As she tried to suppress her emotions, the image on the LED screen in front of her suddenly changed, and the recorded video disappeared.

In an instant, she saw Finn standing in the square in real life. At that moment, a beam of light shone on them in the square.

There was originally nothing on the ground, but a heart-shaped colored light had appeared around them, surrounding the two of them. Behind him, the beautiful fountain also shone with colorful lights.

The scene looked like it was from a beautiful painting, and everything was meticulously arranged.

So when did Finn do all those things? Was it when they were away in the last few days? Had he not been with her? When did he prepare all those?

She just stared at Finn in front of her. She could not tell whether Finn’s eyes were red or not from the screen earlier, but at that moment, she could see, even through his refined glasses, that his eyes were red.

“Monica,” Finn said.

His voice was a little choked up, but he tried to calm himself down. That was when Monica saw him kneeling on one knee and took out an engagement ring..
