“That’s why you should play with me.”

“But I want to play with Mommy…”

“Don’t you want a younger sister?” George asked as he carried Paige to the mat in the living room.

“Yes.” Paige’s crisp and tender voice was filled with anticipation.

“If Daddy and Mommy don’t have time together, how will you get a sister?” George explained.

“If I want a younger sister, I must give Daddy and Mommy time together?” Paige was shocked.

“Yes.” George nodded.

“In that case, I’ll play with you.” Paige agreed immediately.

She happily sat on the mat with George and continued to play with her Barbie doll. Their conversation stunned Edward and Jeanne, who were on the stairs.

“Since when did George know so much?” Jeanne asked Edward.

“Don’t you know your son is mature for his age?” Edward looked like he was in deep thought.

“Isn’t he too mature? He wouldn’t marry a wife before he’s of age, would he?” Jeanne was thinking about that very seriously.

Edward was speechless. What he was thinking about now was whether George could inherit the position of leader as soon as possible, yet his wife was thinking about her future daughter-in-law! Nevertheless, he strode upstairs with Jeanne in his arms.

“Hey, I’m talking business with you!” Jeanne was unhappy.

That matter was very important! She even wondered if she should be giving George s*x education.

“I’m also doing serious business now!” Edward argued irrationally. “It’s a serious matter of getting you pregnant with a younger daughter.”

.Who wants to be pregnant again? I’m not getting pregnant anymore!” Jeanne refused.

“I have the final say.”

“It’s my body. I have the final say whether I want to be pregnant or not!”

“Have you ever had the final say?” Edward smiled evilly.

‘Damn it,’ she secretly cursed.

She suddenly found that what Monica said about all men being sc*mbags was apt!

Nox put down his phone and turned around.

When he saw Shelly busy in the kitchen, Jeanne’s words instantly rang out in his mind. She said something about being gentle and considerate, so he hurriedly got up from the sofa and walked to the kitchen. Then, he gave Shelly a bear hug from behind.

Shelly was shocked. Sometimes, she felt that Nox… was like a ticking time bomb.

“What can I help you with?” Nox pulled Shelly into his arms and rested his chin on her head.

Previously, he had despised Shelly’s height. She was around 160 centimeters, whereas he was 180 centimeters, which put him a head taller than her. Yet now, he suddenly thought that this height was just right because he could hug Shelly tightly.

“No need. Just wait for me on the sofa,” Shelly replied. “It’ll be done in a while.” “I can help you,” Nox said seriously.

Shelly felt that Nox was just acting on impulse. However, because she was entangled with Nox, she had to listen to every word he said. “In that case, you can help me with cutting the vegetables.”

“What do you need me to cut?” Nox let go of Shelly.

He loved the feeling of hugging Shelly.

“Eggplants. Cut them into lumps, like this.” Shelly demonstrated.

It was the simplest job, and Nox immediately agreed. He cut the eggplant according to Shelly’s demonstration with utmost enthusiasm.

In the past, he hated being anywhere near the kitchen the most. In fact, he did not even have the slightest interest in cooking, but now, he felt extremely happy. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

While he cut the eggplant seriously, Shelly was cooking at the side. She added butter and beef to the pan.

Just as she had put it down, it sizzled, and some oil splattered on the back of Nox’s hand. Although some of it also splattered on Shelly’s hand, she was fine because she was used to it. However, Nox jumped at the burning pain, and his hand became unsteady.

“Ow!” Nox shouted.

The kitchen knife had cut Nox’s finger, and blood began to ooze out. Shelly turned around and asked anxiously, “What’s wrong?”

“I cut my finger.” Nox quickly replied, clutching his fingers tightly.

Shelly quickly turned off the stove and went over. That was when she saw the blood on Nox’s hand.

“Do you have a first aid kit at home?”

“I think so.” Nox said, “I haven’t seen it around.”

“Come here first.” Shelly led Nox to the sofa and sat down.

Then, she went to look for the first aid kit. If she remembered correctly, it should be in the storeroom.

She walked into the storeroom and quickly found the first aid kit..
