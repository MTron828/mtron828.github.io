Therefore, she knew very well that he was sincerely grateful to her aunt and uncle. She could use that gratitude to force Finn to take responsibility for her. After all, her aunt and uncle would not be willing to see her being wronged like that. Even if they cared about her cousin’s feelings, Finn and her cousin had divorced and were two separate individuals. They would not selfishly tie her cousin and Finn together.

However, they still failed that day.

Moreover, she did not know why her cousin would appear at the hotel. If her cousin did not appear…

Actually, she did not know whether she would sleep with Finn or not. After all, it was the first time Finn had really chased her away.

When she thought of that, Sarah still felt a little uncomfortable.

She said, “Finn, that was my first kiss.”

Then, she did not know what else to say, and it was useless for her to say anything to Finn.

She could only... use her cowardice to win his sympathy.

Finn’s expression changed slightly, but he did not say anything. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sarah said, “If you said you slept with my cousin that night because you were drugged and was unconscious, you could refuse to bear any responsibility. However, what about me? To me, you were the one who took the initiative. It was you who took away my first kiss.”

“In that case, shouldn’t you pay a price for drugging me?” Finn raised his eyebrows.

Sarah was stunned as she did not expect Finn to use that excuse to avoid her.

That was when she saw Finn suddenly stand up.

Sarah bit her lip, and her heart would race because of his every move.

Finn, on the other hand, walked straight to the door and opened it. His meaning was obvious.

He said, “Sarah, you don’t know men very well. If a man wants to be responsible, he will take responsible even if he holds your hands. If he doesn’t want to be responsible, he won’t even sleep with you. So, even if we slept together that night, I won’t be with you. Even if you mention your aunt and uncle, it won’t work.”

Sarah looked at him in a daze.

He did not expect that he would be able to guess all of her thoughts.

“I’m not as good as you think. I’m not a good person. I tolerated your cousin because I liked her. The indifference I have toward her now is only because I don’t like her anymore, and the same goes with you. Because I don’t like you, I don’t care about any of your feelings.” Finn was really harsh, and his words were emotionless. “I don’t care about the last time you schemed against me not because I’m merciful but because I didn’t sleep with you in the end! If there’s a next time, no matter what the end result is, I’ll do everything I can to make you pay back double!”

Sarah looked straight at Finn, watching him suddenly become cold-blooded and frightening.

He was… completely different from usual.

He did not shout, nor did he look fierce. However, his words were painful.

She bit her lips.

At that moment, she was really frightened by Finn.

“I’ll say one last thing. After divorcing Monica, I don’t need anyone to make me forget this relationship. It’s not because I’m still longing for something or because I’m still waiting for something. I just don’t want to ruin myself for Monica!” Finn said, “She’s not worth it, and you don’t have the right either.”

Sarah’s tears continued to fall.

It seemed she had been rejected, and she realized that being rejected so badly could really be painful.

She had always thought that Finn was not difficult to woo.

She had asked her cousin about all the things that had happened when she wooed Finn back then. However, her cousin only took the initiative and pestered him a little, so Sarah thought that she could do it.

She held herself together from breaking down.

She had thought too highly of herself. She thought that as long as she loved him, she would be able to make him fall in love with her.

However, she could not bear to give up.

Even if she knew that Finn really did not like her and that Finn would not fall in love with her, she still could not bear to give up the first love of her life. She felt that in this world, it was impossible for her to fall in love with other men besides Finn.

With that, she decided to left Finn’s house.

She walked to the door and looked up at Finn and his indifference.

She said, “I won’t give up.”

Finn seemed unwilling to say another word to her, and he would not react to her pain at all.
