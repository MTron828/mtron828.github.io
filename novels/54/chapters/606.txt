Chapter 607: Alexander Exposed, Revenge Feels Great

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Many people were now pointing the finger at Jeanne, and it worried Monica a lot.

“Michael, let go of me.” Monica was a little angry.

“Monica, you’re only going to cause more trouble now. Listen to me. The more you talk, the worse Jeannie will be scolded.”

“Even so, I still have to vent your anger.”

“Monica, be more rational.” Michael kept trying to persuade Monica.

However, Monica was really about to explode. How was she supposed to be rational?

At that moment in the hall, an old man with a bad temper came forward again and lectured Jeanne angrily, “Apologize to your father and your stepmother immediately. Then, apologize to your late grandfather!”

How could Jeanne do such a thing?

However, the feeling of being criticized by everyone was still a little... unpleasant.

She did not want to waste any more time. Some truths should be exposed in front of everyone, and some people should get what they deserved.

Her indifference made the old man, who accused her in front of her, lose control. He reached out his hand and suddenly grabbed Jeanne.

The next second, he wanted to slap Jeanne’s face.

At that, Jeanne tensed up. She could totally resist, but she was afraid that if she pushed too hard, the other party would fall.

Since she did not want to provoke some unnecessary trouble, she decided to accept it. She was used to it anyway.

However, the pain that she imagined did not come to her. She just looked at a man’s hand grabbing the old man’s arm tightly.

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

She did not notice Finn, so she did not know when he arrived. Neither did Monica nor Michael notice Finn.

Everyone, including the old man, looked at Finn. “Who do you think you are? Let me go!”

“I am Fourth Master Swan’s personal doctor. Fourth Master Swan is on his way back from a business trip and has asked me to accompany Jeanne on his behalf to attend Old Master Lawrence’s funeral.” Finn’s expression was a little dark as he said, “Old Master Evans, please have some self-respect. Even Fourth Master Swan can’t bear to hit his wife, so you’d better think twice before you act.”

“I’m just teaching Jeanne a lesson for being rude,” Old Master Evans said fiercely and pushed Finn away.

Finn also let go of him.

He said, “Whether Jeanne needs to be taught a lesson or not is not up to you to decide! Don’t think because you’re old that you can do whatever you want.”

His words made Old Master Evans a little embarrassed.

Monica could not help but look at Finn.

She knew Finn had always been very sharp-tongued as one sentence could sometimes infuriate her. However, she had never seen him rebuke anyone in public.

She had always thought that Finn might have some inferiority complex, for he rarely showed himself in upper-class society.

That was why although they had attended many upper-class society banquets together, almost no one knew who Finn was.

“The times are really changing now. Old farts like us don’t have any status at all!” Old Master Evans was embarrassed for a few seconds before he said in a sarcastic tone, “I don’t know where you random people come from, but how dare you talk to me like this? I’m afraid that from now on, Harken will not have any respect for the old and love the young. Old farts like us should be buried as soon as possible... Ow!”

Old Master Evans suddenly shouted because, at that moment, George suddenly stepped forward and bit Old Man Evan’s thigh.

George was definitely not light in his bite.

Old Master Evans cried out in pain and kicked George to the ground.

George looked at Old Master Evans fiercely as his little buttocks hurt.

Jeanne’s expression instantly changed.

Old Master Evans cried out in pain for quite a while and then roared at George, “George, you b*stard! I don’t know who Jeanne slept with and gave birth to this thing, but it has no manners at all! B*stard like him shouldn’t be in the upper-class society. It’s simply embarrassing!”

Jeanne clenched her fists tightly.

To be honest, she could tolerate the bullying herself but to her son?

She stepped forward, but Finn directly stood in front of Jeanne and said, “Let me do it.”

Jeanne was stunned.

No matter what the reason was, treating an old man like that was unreasonable.

Moreover, George had indeed bitten Old master Evans first.

Finn did not seem to care as he went forward and raised his hand. Then, he slapped Old Master Evans. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
