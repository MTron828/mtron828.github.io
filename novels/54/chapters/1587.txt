Chapter 1588: The Mystery of Bella ‘s Background

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It turned out that the child was not Shelly’s biological child, and here he was, thinking that Shelly had a child with a random man.

He did not know what he was feeling at the moment, so he listened quietly as his mother said, “I did have my own concerns at that time. On the one hand, I thought Shelly bringing a child back would inevitably cause controversy, such that it would be bad for the Winters’ reputation and it would also affect your relationship with Zoe. So, I told her to send the child to the orphanage and I’d think of a way to get a good family to adopt her. On the other hand, how could Shelly marry into a good family if she raises that child? Upon considering her happiness for the rest of her life, I insisted that she handle things according to my methods, and only then would I agree to let her return to our family. However, I didn’t expect my good intentions to hurt Shelly instead and make her hate the Winters so much.”

Nox was silent, not knowing what to say.

To his mother, it was reasonable for her to have such considerations. After all, nobody would want not their family to live a better life; nobody would want their family to get into trouble. However, from Shelly’s point of view, she felt that his mother did not love her enough and rejected her request for her own benefit.

“However, Shelly’s words today really broke my heart. I really cared about her, but she couldn’t understand me at all. Thinking about it still makes me a little disappointed.” Mrs. Winter sighed.

She was still brooding over what Shelly had said today.

“Forget it. Let’s just pretend that Shelly never lived with us. If she thinks she can live a good life by relying on herself, she can go ahead. I don’t want to worry about her anymore. On the other hand, you and Zoe are about to get married. Please treat Zoe well. Zoe is a good girl and is outstanding in all aspects. Besides, she’s well-educated and magnanimous. It would be a pity for you to lose a girl like that. Luckily, I didn’t force you to be with Shelly, and neither did your father nor your grandfather. A girl like Shelly, who wasn’t born into a wealthy family, is much more narrow-minded.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Nox nodded. “I know. I will treat Zoe well.’

“Also, have children early. The older a woman is, the riskier it would be for her to give birth to a child. Hence, giving birth to a child early is also a form of protection for Zoe. When the time comes, I can help you take care of the child. Zoe is a career-driven woman, and I won’t be so stubborn as to want her to be tied down by the child,” Mrs. Winter said earnestly.

At the thought of Nox and Zoe’s perfect marriage, she was still very gratified. It could also be considered as making up for the pain that she had caused by the smile.

“Alright, I’ll make plans with Zoe after we get married.”

“What marriage?” Mrs. Winter smiled. “It’s popular to try marriage now. Don’t think I don’t Imow that Zoe often spends the night in your apartment. Anyway, she’s going to get married soon, so it’s fine if she gets pregnant earlier. I’m not such a conservative person.”

Nox smiled. Parents who wanted grandchildren could really tolerate anything.

“Don’t laugh. I’m serious.”

“Alright.” Nox nodded.

“Alright, it’s getting late. You still have to work tomorrow, so you should go back early,” Mrs. Winter urged. “Mom, you should sleep early too.”

“Yes.”

With that, Nox walked out of his mother’s room. Just as he was about to leave, he hesitated for a moment before knocking on his grandfather’s door.

Ever since Old Master Swan passed away, his grandfather had returned to the

Winters. Due to his old age, he rarely went out and basically stayed inside the Winters’ residence. As such, Nox had not seen him for a long time, even though he would still be afraid to see his grandfather now.

“Come in.” Grandpa Winter’s voice came from inside. He was still full of energy.

Nox pushed open the door. In the room, his grandfather was still awake and sitting on the desk in the room, writing.

“Grandpa,” Nox called out to him.

Grandpa Winter looked up at Nox and ignored him.

Nox did not know why his grandfather had disliked him since he was young.

Was he not excited, considering that they had not seen each other for so long?

“What’s the matter?” Grandpa Winter asked coldly.

Nox almost choked on his saliva. He had always felt that he was not his grandfather’s biological grandson.

“I’m about to get married.” Nox said bluntly, “On the 26th of this month..”
