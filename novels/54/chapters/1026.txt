1027 The Rise of Monica

Jeanne bandaged Lucy’s wound.

Jeanne’s technique was not good. After all, she was not a professional. Hence, with the bandage on, Lucy looked even worse because half of her face was covered with gauze. Those who did not know might think that the left side of her face was destroyed!

Once the long scar on her face healed, it would be no different from having half of her face destroyed.

After she was done, Lucy lit a cigarette for herself.

Jeanne did not smoke. For the past few days, even the smell of smoke made her nauseous, let alone smoking.

“Why are you looking for me?” Lucy asked.

Jeanne was clearly looking for her for something, but she had to wait because of the sudden incident.

“Kingsley took my phone.” Jeanne did not look happy as she sat beside Lucy.

“Why?” Lucy was stunned for a second before she immediately thought of something. “He doesn’t want you to contact those in Harken?!”

“The Sanders are threatening him!” Jeanne gritted her teeth.

In fact, she could understand why Kingsley had to do it. However, he was so assertive that she could not help but want to resist!

Lucy nodded as she knew the reason now. She said, “Monica can’t rely on you forever!”

“I know.”

“Everyone needs to grow up. If you hadn’t survived that year, you wouldn’t be alive today!” Lucy said, “Humans are a part of natural selection. You have to give Monica a chance to grow up!”

“The price of growing up is far too great, and I thought she could choose not to go through that.”

“I watched the press conference yesterday where Monica faced the quality inspection department herself. I think Monica can do it! You must believe her!” Lucy kept comforting her.

Jeanne nodded silently.

In fact, she knew very well that there was nothing she could do to help Monica and that Monica could only rely on herself.

However, she looked for Lucy because she wanted someone to talk to. Lucy was the best at conversing, so she knew exactly what Jeanne wanted to hear.

Jeanne opened the floor-to-ceiling window from her room and walked out to the balcony!

As she looked into the distance, it was as if she could not see the horizon no matter how far she looked!

…

In South Hampton City, Monica went to see her father and saw that he was still lying motionless in the intensive care unit.

She had many things she wanted to say, but at that moment, she could not bring herself to say them.

Only now did she realize that talking was the most useless thing, and in the past, all she knew was to talk!

She turned around and left. The moment she left, her shoulders brushed past Finn. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When Monica returned to the ward, Ruby had gotten out of bed with swollen eyes. It was obvious that she had been crying the whole night.

Monica did not say much. She just told the nurse to send breakfast over and then ate with her mother.

She said, “Mom, I have to go to the office later.”

“Yes.” Ruby nodded.

Now, only Monica could support the family.

“I’ll leave when uncle comes.” Monica peeled an egg for her mother and put it on her plate.

Ruby did not have much of an appetite, but she still ate it.

Monica never used to take care of anyone, so now that her daughter was learning to change, Ruby could not be a burden to Monica!

After breakfast, Ron arrived.

Before Monica left, she said to Ron, “Uncle, I’ll have to trouble you for this period of time. I know you’re very busy with work, so I’ll have to get my aunt to help out. I’ll leave my mother to you.”

“What are you talking about? We’re a family. If I don’t take care of my own sister, who will?” Ron said in a huff.

“In that case, thank you.” Monica did not refuse. “Uncle, please stay here and watch over my mother. As for the rest, she’ll have to figure it out on her own.”

“Alright, you can rest easy and go to work. However, I saw on the news that the situation in Cardellini Enterprise doesn’t seem so good.”

“I’ll do my best. If the outcome isn’t good, I’ll just have to admit it.” She did not think that she could turn the tables.

However, she did not want to regret it in the end.

Monica left the hospital without wasting any more time.

When she arrived at Cardellini Enterprise’s building, she saw the company’s lazy employees. None of them were really working. Instead, they gathered in groups of three to five, chatting and gossiping. They were also a little surprised to see Monica, but no one took the initiative to greet her.

Monica was expressionless as she walked past them and straight into the chairman’s office.

“Ms. Cardellini.” Tim quickly followed her in.

“You can call me the chairman from now on.” Monica said bluntly, “My father is not here, so I’ll take over his position from now on.”
