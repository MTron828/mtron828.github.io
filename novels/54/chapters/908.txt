909 The Sudden Fire Rescue

In the dark wedding hall, the screams continued. Everyone was fleeing outside, and there was chaos everywhere. The Sanders’ guards did not dare to act rashly. They maintained the sound of the scene, which was of no use in the current situation since it was all out of control.

Edward dragged Jeanne to a dark corner. Edward, who had a gunshot wound on his leg, sat on the ground, pulling Jeanne into his arms. She struggled but could not break free from his brutality. The difference in strength between her and Edward was frightening! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne gritted her teeth. She really wanted to shoot this man to death. However, she could not bring herself to do it. She failed each time she tried. She was so angry that her body trembled.

“It feels like you’re about to smoke from anger.” Edward’s playful voice sounded beside her ear.

Jeanne said nothing. She was afraid that she would not be able to resist strangling him to death once she opened her mouth. She wanted to know the truth, and it was right in front of her eyes, within her reach.

Besides the mission, she was also very curious about who the descendant of the Duncans was. Who was it that could play the Sanders like fools in Harken?

Yet, just like that, Edward stopped her. She gritted her teeth in hatred.

“Stay me for a while.” Edward suddenly hugged her tighter.

Even though she was still trapped in Edward’s arms, she seemed to have a different emotion. Jeanne’s heart throbbed as she recalled the two of them in the cloakroom just now. This man’s touch left a deep feeling within her body.

She said, “Let me go.”

“I did, and you ran away.” He hugged her tightly and buried his head in her neck. His warm breath on her body made her skin grow hot, and her body was covered with goosebumps at his proximity.

She bit her lip lightly. A mature body was always so easily seduced...

Jeanne desperately wanted to reject his intimacy, but her body’s instinctive reaction was so obvious that even she was afraid.

She grabbed Edward’s unruly hand. “Edward!” Jeanne bellowed.

“What do you think you’re doing?!”

He was still so dishonest.

Edward chuckled after being lectured by Jeanne. “Sorry. I can’t help it.”

Can not help it, my *ss.

Jeanne said, “Ten minutes. You better behave yourself.” After all, she did agree to accompany him for a while.

Soon, ten minutes had passed. The corner of Edward’s mouth, which was buried in her neck, seemed to smile.

She wondered if this would leave bitterness in her heart. Even though they were clearly husband and wife and had been apart for more than a month, they could only spend ten minutes together.

The two of them hugged each other deeply. Everything around them seemed to disappear. For those ten minutes, they had each other.

The lights in the banquet hall were still not turned on. Occasionally, there would be a few gunshots, but no one was hurt. They were just deliberately causing chaos at the banquet.

The Sanders seemed to have given up on keeping everyone inside. Besides, they could not keep them from leaving. In order to save their lives, all the guests instinctively wanted to leave. If the Sanders tried to stop them now, it would prove that the Sanders were barbaric and cruel. In the end, they could only let this matter go to waste.

The Sanders were also well aware it was the other party’s intention in this incident to cause chaos so that the descendant of the Duncans could escape without hurting anyone. Only a few guards at the door died at the scene. The rest of the time, the guns were aimed at the sky.

When the chaos simmered down, at least fifty percent of the guests had fled. The guards had also completely given up on all obstructions. The moment the Sanders swallowed all their emotions and decided to let everyone go… The banquet hall suddenly caught on fire.

The scream grew louder. “Fire!

“Fire!”

“Everyone, get out of here!”

The guards had already started to help the guests out, but the fire came a little quickly. In an instant, the entire banquet hall was engulfed in a sea of fire.

Jeanne pushed Edward away. “Let’s go.”

Edward looked at Jeanne.

“Do you want to die? Let’s go!” Jeanne said. She did not expect the place to suddenly burn up in flames.

Edward said, “You go first.”

“What else do you want to do?” Jeanne stared at Edward. Now, because of the fire, they could see each other clearly.

Edward did not speak.
