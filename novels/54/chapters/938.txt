939 Monica Enters the Company, Unexpectedly Domineering

“Monica, who are you talking about?” The board member who had scolded her the most stood up from his seat angrily.

“I’m talking about you!” Monica shouted.

Since she was young, she liked to go to nightclubs, and it was inevitable that she would meet some hooligans. Hence, Monica’s arguing skills were not bad. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You!”

“Now that the Cardellini Enterprise is in trouble, you curse everything and the person in charge of the Cardellini Enterprise instead of thinking about how to tide over the difficulties together! So, if you fall sick one day, will you not see a doctor and criticize your mother for not giving you a good body?” Monica’s voice was loud.

When she was desperate, she could shed all pretenses of cordiality.

“Y-Y-You wretched girl, what nonsense are you spouting?”

“You’re the one who’s spouting nonsense! My dad is alive and well. Why are you cursing him? Let me tell you, my dad can live for a hundred or a thousand years. When you die, my dad will still be alive and well.”

“Monica!” The board member’s face turned pale.

He did not expect that little girl to be so good at scolding people.

“I’m here today to tell you that I’m the one in charge of the Cardellini Enterprise now. My father will no longer show up in Cardellini Enterprise. He’s going to recuperate and live for a hundred years to watch you old bones die one by one!”

“Monica, watch what you say!” The other board members were also enraged.

“We’re all people. If you don’t talk nicely to me, why should I talk nicely to you? I’m showing you respect by not swearing at you!”

“Damn you!” Monica’s words angered the Board of Directors so much that they were trembling.

“I won’t be dead either, so I’ll just torture you old men to death. When you die, I’ll give you all a flower wreath, and it’ll say you deserve to die on all of them!”

“Monica!” The board of directors raged.

Monica was scolding all of them, but most importantly, no one could scold her back.

None of them had really interacted with Monica before this, so all they knew was that Monica was different from other rich young ladies. However, they finally knew now that she was completely different.

Which rich young lady would dare to scold someone like that in front of so many elders?

Monica did not care about how angry those people were. She said fiercely, “Let me tell you, you can vent your emotions all you want, and if you want to quarrel, I can argue with you. However, no one can hide from Cardellini Enterprise’s crisis! Either you die with us, or we have to think of a way to help the company get through this difficult time!”

Everyone fell silent for a second.

“Right now, Mr. Warren and I are discussing how to turn the situation around for Cardellini Enterprise. The most important thing is to let the outside world know that our vaccine is not a problem! However, to solve this problem, we need to know the progress of the quality inspection department’s testing. As long as the officials can announce that there is no problem with our vaccine, Cardellini Enterprise can survive!” Monica did not give the other directors a chance to speak before she said loudly, “Now, I need everyone to use your connections to get the public relations in the quality inspection department to get the results out as soon as possible! I might as well tell you some very unfortunate news. The former director of the quality inspection department, Michael, has a deep hatred for me and wants me dead. If he still has power in the quality inspection department, Cardellini Enterprise is doomed!”

“How can make what’s your fault sound so natural?” One of the directors was indignant. “If you hadn’t broken off the engagement with Michael, he would still be in the quality inspection department. Then, it would’ve been easy for him to help Cardellini Enterprise solve its problems. You made the mistake, but how do you have the nerve to say it out loud?”

She had clearly offended the quality inspection department, yet she could still act so arrogantly. How could she be so shameless?

It made all the directors very unhappy.

They felt that Monica was like a newborn calf that was not afraid of tigers.

Monica was not embarrassed at all. She said, “I’m telling you this so that you know about Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation. We need you to help us tide over this crisis. Now, as long as we can get the vaccine test report out as soon as possible, Cardellini Enterprise will have a chance to rise again!”

“You’re begging us. Can you plead a little more?” The director was upset again.

Today, he felt like he was being bullied by Monica.

“If Cardellini Enterprise is dead, we’ll all go down together! You guys can do whatever you want!” Monica did not seem to care.

The board of directors was so angry that they glared at her.

They could not believe that they were being threatened by that damned girl!
