Chapter 439: The Swan Enterprise’s Senior Management Meeting, Confronting Eden

His Fourth Uncle was so charmed by that woman, Jeanne, that he was completely smitten.

He even brought Jeanne with him to work!

Then, he narrowed his eyes and asked his assistant, “Go and ask what the Lawrence Enterprise’s actions are on the e-commerce project.”

“I’ve already asked them this morning. They’re still negotiating with the local supplies. It seems like they really want to use the suppliers to stop the in-store bulk-buying campaign.”

Eden sneered. “Jeanne is really stupid.”

“You’re the smart one, President.” The assistant immediately flattered him.

Eden was a little smug.

Soon, the car arrived at Swan Enterprise’s headquarters. By then, many of the senior management had arrived.

Most of the members of the Swans were part of the senior management. Hence, almost all of them were there, including the eldest son of the Swans, Henry, the second daughter, Elaine, the third son, Richard, the eldest grandson of the Swans, Eden, and the nephew and niece of Old Master Swan. In short, the Swans accounted for half of the senior management, and the remaining half were talents recruited by the Swans.

In the huge senior management meeting room, 50 people were set according to their positions in the company.

Everyone was a little confused. Hence, before the meeting started, they were all whispering to each other, completely unaware of what was so important that required everyone to rush over today.

In fact, Jeanne admired Edward.

After all, he had set up such a huge meeting for her without even questioning her.

......

As she followed behind Edward, she glanced at the people sitting in Swan Enterprise’s senior management meeting room. They were all rich and powerful.

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, she sat next to Edward in the middle seat.

Everyone present was visibly surprised when they saw Edward showing up with her wife.

It was already not appropriate for Edward to bring his wife to work, and now she was participating in the meeting, which was probably too much.

Edward had never done such a reckless thing in so many years.

For a moment, everyone in the meeting room was stunned, but no one dared to ask further.

Edward did not explain himself either. He sat in the middle and said, “The main reason I’ve gathered everyone here today for this emergency meeting with the senior management is that my wife, Jeanne, has something she needs to tell everyone in person–”

“President,” Elaine could not help but ask

Edward looked at his sister.

Elaine stood up. “I’ve always thought you have a sense of propriety, so I’m willing to listen to you. However, how can you ask all of us in the senior management to put down our work and come here all for the sake of your wife’s trivial matter? Don’t you think it’s a little too much for you to involve so many of us?”

“Edward.” At that moment, Henry also said, “Don’t mess around.”

After all, Henry was the eldest son. Although his position was not as high as Edward’s, he still put on the airs of a boss with a somewhat critical tone.

“President.” Cole Ward, the employed senior manager, said, “Even if the madam requires something from us, I personally think the President should be the one telling us. We really shouldn’t allow an outsider into Swan Enterprise’s senior management meeting. All of us here have signed a confidentiality agreement, and for the President to bring his wife to such a meeting so abruptly, I think the President did not think it through well enough.”

In an instant, a lot of people were questioning him in the meeting room.

Eden sat at the end of the table and secretly smiled sinisterly. He was afraid his Fourth Uncle was really bewitched to bring Jeanne to a meeting like that.

He wanted to see how his Fourth Uncle would explain himself to so many people.

Edward had yet spoken when Jeanne suddenly spoke in a crisp voice that was neither slow nor hurried. She said calmly, “I wonder if having the original shares of Swan Enterprise counts as one of the Swans?”

Everyone was shocked, and Eden was also stunned.

How could Jeanne have the original shares of the Swans?

Could it be…? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He looked at Edward and could not believe that his Fourth Uncle would transfer the shares to Jeanne.

“Jeanne holds 8 percent of Swan Enterprise’s shares,” Edward announced publicly. “This is the document for the transfer of the shares. All of you can take a look at it.”

Edward waved his hand.

Then, the staff in the meeting room quickly went forward to take it and showed the transfer document to all the senior managers one by one.

Eden looked at it very seriously and a few times at that.

The terms and conditions in it were all beneficial to Jeanne., so it could be considered an unconditional transfer.

Eden really could not believe his eyes.
