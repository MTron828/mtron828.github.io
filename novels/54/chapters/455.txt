Chapter 456: Sweet Shopping

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She could not gain any advantage in front of Jeanne now.

She had always hated that woman. She wished she could skin that woman alive!

Now that Eden had deliberately poked her sore spot, her expression became a little ferocious.

She asked Eden coldly and said, “Do you regret it now? Regret being together with me?”

Eden glanced at Jasmine; his expression still grim. However, he did not answer Jasmine’s words.

He did regret it, but he did not want to admit it.

He did not want to admit that back then, he was the one who was seduced by Jasmine and broke up with Jeanne.

If Jasmine had not been there back then, Jeanne would be lying under his body and pleasuring him.

When he thought about how Jeanne and his fourth uncle were always together like glue...

He hated her to his core.

He refused to admit that he still had feelings for Jeanne.

Jeanne did not know what was good for her back then and almost ruined his reputation. Hence, he launched a series of revenge on her just to make Jeanne show her weakness to him. When he was dating Jeanne back then, Jeanne would never give in even though the two of them liked each other, and he could never have control of Jeanne. He could never ask Jeanne to do anything, and when he wanted to do something intimate with Jeanne sometimes, she would reject him flatly. Having already felt repressed, he wanted to use that opportunity to let Jeanne understand that she could not do whatever she wanted in front of him and that he could also look down on her!

However, his actions did not make Jeanne give in in the end. On the contrary, it made Jeanne give up on him completely. Even now, she was still going against him in every corner!

......

Now that she has married his fourth uncle, not only was he lower in status than her in the company but also in the family!

At that thought, Eden’s expression became even more ferocious.

He did not know whether he hated Jeanne more or loved her more. Anyway, no one could wish to get what he could not. He would rather destroy it!

Jasmine saw the scowl on his face.

She could not understand why Eden had suddenly changed.

They were clearly on good terms before this, and she thought Eden loved her very much.

After all, there were so many young ladies from wealthy families. Her birth was not good, but in the end, he still married her.

She gritted her teeth.

What did Eden say just now? She was nothing compared to Jeanne.

That was right!

Ever since Jeanne’s return, Eden seemed to have changed.

He seemed to have become less and less into her.

Could it be that Eden still liked Jeanne?

No! She refused to accept it.

She had finally managed to snatch Eden from Jeanne’s hands, so she definitely could not let Jeanne seduce Eden again!

Her eyes were red, and the softness on her face turned vicious.

She looked at Eden fiercely as if she wanted to see through him.

Eden was more than annoyed with her. He was furious. “I told you to get lost. Don’t you understand human language? Jasmine, without my permission, you are not to come near me!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jasmine looked straight at Eden.

“You still like Jeanne, don’t you?” Jasmine suddenly asked him.

Since it had already come to that point, and if they were going to shed all pretenses of cordiality, they should just let it be!

Eden looked at Jasmine coldly. “Other than love and affection, what else do you know?”

“What do you want me to do?” Jasmine was also on the verge of breaking down. She shouted fiercely at Eden, “Back then, you said you liked how I didn’t know anything other than loving you wholeheartedly, and now you’re looking down on me? Just because I’m not as capable as Jeanne? Because I can’t help you in your career? Eden, don’t you think that you’re revolting too? You’re not capable enough. Why are you blaming everything on me when you’re not capable enough? You can’t do it yourself...”

“Slap!” Eden gave Jasmine a hard slap on the face.

Jasmine looked at Eden in disbelief.

She covered her face, which was burning with pain.

She had never thought Eden would hit her one day and so mercilessly at that.

Her tears flowed even more violently, and there was a scroll on her resentment-filled face.

“Jasmine, who do you think you are, making such a big fuss here? Do you think I can’t divorce you just because I married you? You’re the daughter of a mistress. What right do you have to be the eldest young mistress of the Swans!” Eden was not ashamed of saying all that, and his expression was abnormally cold.
