917 Have You Really Let Go of Finn? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She felt that Finn had been a little too cold to her daughter and was afraid she would get hurt.

“Forget it,” he said. Gary did not seem to want to delve into this topic. “Don’t mention this in front of Monica. Since she didn’t say anything, there’s no need for us to poke at our daughter’s wound.”

“I know.” Ruby nodded.

“Get some sleep. You’ve been through so much today. Have some rest to recuperate.” Gary comforted her.

Ruby nodded. She leaned into her husband’s arm and closed her eyes. Then slowly, the sound of their even breathing could be heard.

When she was sure they had fallen asleep, Monica opened her eyes and saw her parents hugging each other. She thought of the many lifetimes of cultivation it would take to exchange for such a beautiful love like her parents, which had lasted for decades.

In the past, she did not know anything and only thought her father had no status in front of her mother. Only now did she understand that he doted on her very much. That was why he allowed her to do whatever she wanted in his world. Her mother must have been in God’s good graces to be able to meet her father, who loved her so much!

A faint smile appeared, and a tear fell onto her lips. When did she start crying so much? As both her arms were wrapped in bandages, it was difficult for her to wipe her tears.

Her eyes flickered. During her moment of sadness, Finn suddenly appeared in her ward. When Finn saw her face and their eyes met, he was clearly surprised. Not because of tears, but rather, Finn thought that she had fallen asleep. However, when he saw his tears, he looked a little lost.

Monica was also in a daze for a while. She did not expect Finn to appear here. Furthermore, she did not want Finn to see her cry. She was afraid of being despised by this man.

She raised her hand with great effort and wiped her tears with her bandaged hand. Finn looked on at her before shifting his gaze last minute. He probably did not want to see her like this.

She asked, “Are you here to see Sarah?”

Monica quickly regained her composure. While she was not very capable in this life, she had always been known to be heartless.

Finn returned his gaze to her.

“I heard my mom say she was in the room next door,” Monica told him.

Finn remained silent.

“It’s a good thing you saved her. Otherwise, she would’ve died inside with me, and her parents would probably not have let me off even if they turned into ghosts,” Monica said with a faint smile. Her voice was very low, afraid she would wake her parents. She said, “Who would have thought that a wedding would end up like this? Though I heard that no guests died at the scene. Otherwise, I would have died ten thousand times today.”

Monica blamed herself for the wedding accident.

“It was not related to you,” Finn said. He was trying to say that what happened at the wedding had nothing to do with her.

“If I hadn’t gotten married, all these things wouldn’t have happened.” Monica, on the other hand, could see it clearly. “You weren’t injured, were you?”

Finn looked at her.

“Judging by your appearance, you should be fine,” Monica said lightly. “Hurry up and go keep Sarah company next door. I heard from my mother that Sarah was frightened badly. She probably needs someone to accompany her now.” Monica urged him to leave.

“You didn’t mind?” Finn suddenly asked her instead of leaving.

“What?” Monica was surprised.

“That I saved Sarah first,” Finn said.

Monica smiled. At first, she thought Finn had asked her if she did not mind him going to accompany Sarah. She was always giving herself hope, but it turns out that Finn was just a little uneasy with his conscience. If it were anyone else, they would probably feel a little uneasy as well. That was human nature, after all.

She was not great herself either. Of course, she had grumbled about it. Even if she kept opening up new lands for Finn, it was difficult for her to be magnanimous in the face of life and death.

She said, “In that environment, I would have saved Sarah first if I were you.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly, and he pursed his lips tightly.

“Of course, I’m a little resentful. After all, I almost died. However, humans are selfish creatures. It’s normal they would choose to save those who were more important to them first. I’m selfish too. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t have been so petty. Though, it ended quite well. I’m not dead, so I don’t care too much. You don’t have to feel too guilty.”
