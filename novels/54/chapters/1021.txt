1022 Millie’s Tragic End

Millie looked at Lucy blankly.

She really did not know that the Hills could check their accounts at will or that the Hills knew every single bit of money they had spent.

If only she knew…

However, other than an account from the Hills and the remuneration they gave her, she had no other income.

It was impossible for her to get any money from anywhere else.

Millie’s body tensed up.

At that moment, Cain had already appeared in Kingsley’s room. He respectfully reported to Kingsley, “Mr. Thorn, I was the one who provided Ms. Harmon with the list. Miss Millie did have a sum of 1.5 million dollars transferred to the official account of S Underground Organization. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I also called the person in charge of S Underground Organization and verified that they’ve indeed received Miss Millie’s money.”

“No, it’s not true. You guys are both framing me. Lucy and Cain are colluding to frame me!” Millie denied it and kept trying to defend herself.

“Miss Millie, I’ve been in the Hills for 20 years. I can swear on my life that everything I’ve said to Mr. Thorn is the truth. I’ve never lied.”

“I swear I didn’t hire an assassin to kill Lucy too. I was framed.” Millie was extremely agitated. She faced Kingsley and said nervously, “Mr. Thorn, I really couldn’t have done this. It’s Lucy and Cain who are deliberately trying to harm me. Lucy is jealous that I’m with you now, so she’s thinking of ways to get rid of me! Don’t be fooled by her. ”

Millie placed all her hopes on Kingsley.

She believed that Kingsley was still reluctant to part with her. Otherwise, why would he help her just now?

In any case, Kingsley had the final say in the Hills. If Kingsley protected her, she could bite back at Lucy.

“Miss Millie, I’ll say it again. I’m telling the truth, and I didn’t collude with miss Yu to frame you. Framing you won’t do me any good! But more importantly, I would never lie to Mr. Thorn. Please don’t slander me again and again!” Cain’s expression was ugly.

“Don’t think I don’t know that you and Lucy are having an affair! I just saw you on the same bed a few days ago. There must be an unspeakable secret between the two of you.” Millie insisted. “Mr. Thorn, it’s true. They’ve been in cahoots for a long time. They’ve just been hiding it from us. You must believe me. You must believe that I’m innocent!”

Lucy just watched as Millie courted death, and Cain, too, looked at her coldly and did not defend himself.

Millie thought that their silence meant that they did not dare to go against her. After all, Kingsley was on her side. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Hence, she took the initiative to approach Kingsley, trying to charm her way through. She reached out to hold Kingsley’s hand and said, “Mr. Thorn, you must believe me. I will never do anything that goes against the Hills. To you, I’m– Ah!”

Kingsley flung Millie’s outstretched hand away.

At the same time, Kingsley kicked Millie hard, and his foot landed on her body.

Having been caught off guard, Millie was kicked to the ground and sent rolling over a few times.

If she were not an assassin, an ordinary person would have been killed by that kick.

Lucy and Cain’s expressions did not change. After all, all assassins were cold-blooded people.

Millie curled up on the ground in pain.

She clutched her stomach and lay on the ground, looking like she was in pain. “Mr. Thorn…”

She was still trying to please Kingsley.

However, Kingsley’s expression was extremely cold.

He said, “Millie, no one in the Hills dares to go against my principles!”

“I didn’t. I really didn’t do it…” Millie kept defending herself. “Lucy set me up. Believe me, I’m loyal to you. It’s her. She’s the one who’s up to no good…”

Kingsley stood in front of Millie and looked down at her heartbroken expression.

Then, he lifted his long leg and stepped on Millie’s face with his leather shoes. As soon as he pressed down on Millie’s face, Millie could not even let out a scream.

Meanwhile, Lucy and Cain just stood there, not daring to make a sound. They even believed that Kingsley’s strength was enough to crush Millie’s head.

That cruel man was cold and ruthless to everyone.
