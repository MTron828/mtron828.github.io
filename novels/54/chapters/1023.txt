1024 It’s Not Worth It For Kingsley

Jeanne was really furious when she returned to her room, so she wanted to find Lucy to ease her mind.

Lucy had a kind of magic that no matter how bad her mood was, Lucy would somehow be able to heal her every time they chatted.

Jeanne had always found Lucy to be a treasure that was full of surprises!

Kingsley was really stupid for not cherishing a woman like Lucy!

When Jeanne went from her room to Lucy’s room, she ran into Cain, the Hills’ manager. Cain said that Lucy had brought Millie to the underground prison.

In that moment, she knew that Millie was done for.

In fact, Lucy was the one who gave Millie all of her bragging rights. If Lucy did not want to give her anything, Millie would have nothing, just like now.

Jeanne stood at the entrance of the underground prison and watched as Millie bled to death.

To be honest, she had never seen Lucy kill anyone.

By the time she returned to the Hills, Lucy was already by Kingsley’s side and become the only long-term woman he had. Hence, she almost never went out on missions again.

Moreover, Lucy’s main responsibility at that time was to train her to become a professional assassin from an ordinary person. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

What Lucy had taught her most was not to kill with her hands but to use her brain.

Hence, Jeanne did not have great martial prowess.

Perhaps Kingsley did not want to see Jeanne suffer too much physical torture, so he did not have any requirements for her combat skills. As long as she was stronger than ordinary people, it was fine. However, she was nothing among assassins.

It was her first time seeing Lucy kill someone — a slash to the throat, clean, sharp, cold-blooded, and ruthless!

“Alas, I still showed you the cruelest side of me.” Lucy even laughed at that moment.

With her face and body covered in blood, her smile looked even more terrifying.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered. “That’s true, but there’s nothing wrong with that.”

Who could those people blame for courting their own deaths?

Lucy stood up from the ground. Seeing that Millie was at her feet, she stepped over her corpse coldly.

“Let’s go,” she said.

Jeanne nodded.

There would be others to clean up the place.

The Hills also had different ways of dealing with the death of assassins.

If they died in the middle of a mission, they would receive the best funeral. As for people like Millie, they would only take her body and feed it to the Hills’ hunting dogs.

The world of assassins was cruel beyond imagination.

Jeanne followed Lucy to her room, where Lucy went to take a shower and changed into a clean silk robe.

Lucy liked the color bright red, which complemented with her fair skin and alluring charm. She gave the illusion that no one was worthy of wearing red in front of her.

Jeanne looked at the cut on her face that Millie had made. “Do you want me to take care of it?”

“Thank you.” Lucy did not refuse.

Jeanne went over, took out the first aid kit, and helped her disinfect, clean, and apply some ointment.

Lucy endured the pain silently.

It was a little quiet until there was a sudden knock on the door, and it sounded urgent.

Lucy’s eyes narrowed, and Jeanne also stopped what she was doing at that moment.

“Come in.”

Cain pushed the door open and entered, his tone anxious. “Mr. Thorn has ordered for Kerby to be castrated.”

“What?” Lucy’s face sank.

Jeanne was shocked too.

“He’s already on the operating table.”

Lucy immediately rushed out, and so did Jeanne.

Cain followed behind them, and his pace was also quite fast.

The three of them rushed into the Hills’ operating theatre, where Kerby was tied to the operating table.

Although assassins had seen and experienced too many cruel things, that kind of thing still made Kerby’s face turn pale.

At that moment, the doctor’s scalpel was already waving in front of him when Lucy roared, “Stop!”

The surgeon, Weiss, was shocked by Lucy’s anger for a second.

Everyone knew that the Hills was an assassin organization, and it was easy for an assassin to kill someone.

He said, “M-M-Mr. Thorn gave the order.”

“Stop!” Jeanne was also furious.

Kingsley was so cruel that she wanted to strangle him to death!

“But…” How could he explain himself to Mr. Thorn?

“I’ll go and look for him!” Jeanne made a prompt decision. Before she left, she did not forget to threaten him. “I’m warning you. If you dare touch Kerby, I’ll touch you wherever you touched him!”
