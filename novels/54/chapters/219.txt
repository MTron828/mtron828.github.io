Chapter 220: Monica, You Really Don’t Treat Me as a Man, Do You?!

No matter how Monica looked at it, she felt that she was always embarrassed in front of Finn.

The scum was born to be at odds with her.

Monica secretly adjusted her emotions, absolutely not letting Finn see her embarrassment.

She even smiled and moved her foot away, then she bent down to pick the underwear up. “I don’t know why this dropped on the ground. I accidentally stepped on it. Can you see if it’s dirty?”

Finn just looked at her.

Monica was holding his underwear in her hand. She was embarrassed again.

‘This b*stard would never give me a way out.’

She said, “The housekeeper seems to have something on today. She even forgot to put the washed clothes in the bathroom for me. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have run out naked.”

Finn pursed his lips.

“The housekeeper isn’t here, and your underwear seems to be dirty. Let me throw it away for you.”

“Help me wash it,” Finn suddenly enunciated each word.

Monica looked at him.

“Didn’t you dirty it? Is there a problem with me asking you to wash it?” Finn asked.

“I accidentally—” Monica did not feel guilty at all.

“Didn’t you dirty it in the end?” Finn raised his eyebrow.

‘Sh* t.’

Monica gritted her teeth. “I’ll compensate you with a new one.”

“I’m not that extravagant.”

“Finn...”

“Forget it if you don’t want to wash it,” Finn said straightforwardly. At that moment, he reached out to take his underwear from Monica.

Monica suddenly stopped and held the underwear tightly in her palm.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

“Don’t act as if I owe you a lot. Isn’t it just a pair of underwear? I’ll wash it!” Monica was a little angry.

She hated it when Finn looked at her with a disappointed look.

How bad was she that he looked down on her so much?

Monica took Finn’s underwear and walked toward the huge washing machine.

To be honest, ever since she was young, she had only seen a washing machine but had never used one before.

‘How does this thing work?’

She pondered for a long time before she finally found the door to the washing machine. Just as she was about to throw the underwear in...

“Monica, do you have no common sense in life?”

Monica frowned.

She turned to look at Finn.

“Don’t you know that undergarments can’t be washed with the washing machine?”

“I don’t know!” Monica was a little angry.

‘Why are you so fierce?!’

“If you don’t know, I’ll tell you,” Finn said slowly, “Firstly, undergarments can’t be mixed with other clothes because they need to be absolutely clean. If mixed with other clothes, bacteria will easily grow on them. This washing machine is often used to wash other clothes, so there’ll be bacteria residue in it.”

“...”

“Second, the washing machine mimics the principle of a mallet hitting. It uses machinery to do work to make the drum rotate. The clothes are constantly lifted and let down in the drum, and the process repeats! Use your head to think—can the weight of a pair of underwear achieve that function?! Can it achieve the purpose of being washed?!”

“... “Monica’s face turned red.

‘I just don’t know how to wash clothes!

‘Is there a need to make me sound so idiotic?!’

Monica was born to do housework.

“Wash your hands,” Finn said after giving her a lesson.

Monica took the underwear and walked to the laundry sink at the side.

She wanted to kill Finn and perish together with him.

‘What makes him feel like he can be so arrogant?’

Monica was gnashing her teeth. She gnashed her teeth and turned on the tap, then she rinsed the underwear non-stop. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Don’t you know how to use laundry detergent?” Finn asked.

Monica was stunned.

There was also laundry detergent.

“It’s next to you,” Finn reminded, “Squeeze some on the underwear.”

Monica followed Finn’s instructions.

After a while, his underwear was covered in foam.

The foam stained Monica’s hands. At that moment, Monica did not feel disgusted at all. Instead, she felt that it was very dry and that the smell of the laundry detergent was very fragrant.

“I’m not asking you to play with the foam. Scrub it,” Finn instructed.

‘Scrub it?’

Monica was stunned.

Then, she instinctively scrubbed the underwear twice.

She did not know if it was right.

Seeing that Finn did not babble anymore, she felt that she might have done the right thing.

She scrubbed it back and forth.

After scrubbing it for a while, she felt that her hands were a little sore.

She did not want to scrub it anymore. She turned on the tap and wanted to rinse it.

“Is it already clean?”Finn asked.

“If not?”

“Continue to scrub.”

“Why?!” Monica was a little angry. She was very unhappy with Finn’s instructions, to begin with, but he still wanted more. “Didn’t it just fall to the ground? How dirty can it be?!”
