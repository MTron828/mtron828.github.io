1310 A Family’s Warmth

“When I brought you back last night, Paige happened to wake up,” Edward seemed to be explaining.

Candice felt that her face was a little hot. She did not turn to look at Edward. Her gaze was on Paige, who was focused on playing with the building blocks.

“She saw you and asked me if Mommy is back?” Edward said.

Candice could not help but imagine that scene.

For some reason, she felt a little bitter.

Even Little Paige’s small actions and expressions made her feel a little indescribable and uncomfortable emotion. It was as if she owed her a lot.

“Paige has been looking for her mother since she was a little more sensible. I didn’t want Paige to know too much, so I told her that her mother was working outside and would come back after work. When she saw me bring you back last night, she thought that her mother was back.” Edward looked at Paige and lowered his voice.

Actually, when children were playing games, they could not hear what the adults were saying but Edward was still afraid that Paige would find out, so his voice was very soft.

He even deliberately sat very close to Candice and whispered into her ear.

It made her a little… shy.

“That’s why Paige called you Mom today.” Edward looked at her. “Would you mind?”

Candice quickly shook her head.

She said, “Not at all, I like Paige a lot. I feel like there’s a special affinity.”

“Mm,” Edward replied.

This voice evoked a thousand kinds of emotions mixed into one.

Candice felt that the more she interacted with Edward, the more she felt.

Was this the feeling of being in a relationship?!

She had no idea either.

However, she suddenly felt that because of Paige, she did not seem to reject Edward so much. Previously, she really felt a strong sense of distance from him. Deep down, she was a little resistant to his approach.

“Chief.” In the hall, Teddy suddenly came over from the side. “Ms. Paige’s tutors are here to teach the Miss.”

She saw a few tutors standing by the door respectfully.

Edward nodded slightly. He knelt down and picked up Paige. “Paige, the teacher is here for the class.”

“Okay,” Paige agreed in her baby voice.

She obediently put down the building blocks in her hand and got up with the help of her father’s arms. She ran happily to the female teachers at the door and threw herself into their arms affectionately.

Paige was undeniably a very likable little girl.

She saw the teachers take turns giving Paige a big hug, then holding her hand as they walked to their classroom.

Candice watched as Paige and the teachers left. She was a little embarrassed to find that she and Edward were the only ones left in the hall.

After all, they had not known each other for long, so she felt a little uncomfortable.

Candice thought about it and found a topic to talk about. “Does Paige always have classes at home?”

“Yes,” Edward replied.

“Why didn’t you let her go out to class with the other kids?” Candice asked.

She felt that this should not be the case. Instead, children should grow up together with their peers.

“I’m worried.”

“It should be fine now that it’s peaceful and prosperous.” Candice disagreed.

Edward looked at her.

Candice realized that she was being too nosy. At the end of the day, Paige was only Edward’s child. Although she called her Mommy, she had no right to ask about Paige.

A smile curved her lips. “I’m just saying. Of course, you’re Paige’s father. You know Paige best. I’m sure your arrangement is better.”

Edward’s throat moved slightly and she did not say anything else.

Candice felt that she might have offended him just now, even if he kept silent. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Edward’s phone rang and broke the awkward air between them.

He took out his phone and glanced at the caller ID. He stood up and walked away to the side to answer the call.

Candice heaved a sigh of relief. His presence still felt rather oppressive, even though he seemed very gentle at home.

Edward had just taken a few steps when he turned around and saw Candice’s relaxed mood.

Was it very tiring for her to be with him?!

Edward walked away with his phone while Candice turned her attention to the television in front of her.

She had not watched a variety show for a long time so when she saw a funny scene, she could not help but laugh.

When Edward returned, he saw the smile on her face gradually faded.
