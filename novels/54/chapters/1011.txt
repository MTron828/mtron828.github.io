1012 Identity Exposed: Jeanne Is the Sanders’ Third Princess!

“Alright.” Jeanne nodded.

Anyway, he was just chasing her away.

“When everything is over, I will not only return you your identity as a Sanders within the family but also in public. But during this period of time, I’ll have to disappoint you.” Warren looked a little guilty.

His meaning was clear.

Now, her identity as a Sanders was just within the family. However, she had no identity in public.

In fact, she had never cared about it.

“Jeannie, take care of yourself,” Warren said with a smile.

He looked kind.

Jeanne nodded.

At that moment, she saw two guards suddenly appear in the hall, waiting for her. Hence, she did not stay and left with the guard.

To her, that place was nothing!

Once Jeanne left, the smile on Warren’s face disappeared, and all the friendly smiles on the rest of the Sanders’ faces disappeared.

Chester asked, “Father, are we going to let Jeanne go just like this?”

“There’s no rush.” Warren said, “Let’s wait a few more days until the Cardellini Pharmaceutical business has been settled. Then, we’ll talk”

“Yes.”

Warren’s lips curled into a cold smile.

Back then, Jeanne’s mother was just a pawn in his plan, and Jeanne was nothing more than that now!

…

Warren sent Jeanne on a private plane back to the Delta Islands.

As she sat on the plane and watched it taxied for take-off, she returned to her senses.

In the end, before the plane took off, she sent out a message. “I’m sorry. I broke my promise. I can’t go home the day after tomorrow.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘I can’t go home.’

She did not know if she could go home in the future either.

After sending the message, Jeanne turned off her phone.

She did not dare to imagine how disappointed Edward would be with her when he received that message.

…

In Bamboo Garden, under Edward’s instructions, Teddy was decorating the room.

Teddy did not understand why he suddenly had to hang up those blue, pink, red, and yellow-colored decorations as if it was a festival.

Would it not look too flashy?

At that moment, he was holding a wind chime with feathers in his hand. He asked, “Master, are we really going to hang this on the door?”

It was a little too girly.

Although the feathers fluttered in the breeze and the bell sounded pleasant to the ears, it did not match the vibe of the house.

He may have asked a question, stating his confusion, but he had already found the right position and was about to hang it up.

“Take it down.” Edward looked at his phone and said calmly.

“Huh?” Teddy thought he had heard wrong, so he asked, “In that case, where should I hang it?”

“Just throw it away,” Edward said.

“What?” Teddy was dumbfounded.

He had woken up early that morning to prepare all kinds of decorations.

Although it did look a little flashy, after a whole morning of work, the overall vibe was still there.

The house that was originally cold and icy was much warmer now, and it felt like home.

“Throw it away.” Edward repeated, adding, “Throw them all away.”

What did he mean by ‘throw them all away’?

Teddy looked at his master in a daze.

Ever since his master met Eldest Young Lady Lawrence, he had never been… the same.

Edward stood up from the sofa. Without another word, he left, with his back toward Teddy.

It was his back that made Teddy feel he was a little lonely.

No. His master was so powerful. Why would he get the impression that his master was abandoned? He must be overthinking.

However, he looked at the decorations that he had put up with great difficulty and sighed.

His master did not look like he was joking. Hence, he had to take down everything he had worked so hard on today, one by one.

He even wondered when he pissed his Fourth Master off again. Otherwise, why would he torture him like that?

Edward naturally did not care about Teddy’s thoughts.

He walked up the stairs, which had also been decorated. Every time he walked past, a light with sensors would light up under his feet.

He thought women would probably like shiny things like that, and after being apart for so long, he had to give her a little surprise.

When he walked up to the second floor, he stopped in his tracks.

George stood in front of him, looking at him and at Teddy breaking down and taking down the decorations from the wall.

George said, “I knew my mother wouldn’t like these things.”

He thought Teddy was taking it down because his mother did not like it.

Edward pursed his lips. “Your mother won’t be coming tomorrow.”

George remained silent.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you.” Edward smiled faintly.

It was a sincere apology.

George bit his small lips, clearly upset.
