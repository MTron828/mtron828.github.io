Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I don’t mind.”

“In that case, I’ll pack my things tomorrow and go over to your place.” Shelly nodded.

“Alright,” Nox replied.

Then, silence filled the room again.

Amidst the silence, Nox turned over, and Shelly’s body tensed up. She knew Nox very well, and the most important thing to him in a so-called relationship was physical intimacy. That was why she did not reject Nox’s request to stay the night or sleep in the same bed as him. Since she had agreed to be with Nox, she was ready to sleep with him. “Shelly,” Nox called out to her.

“Yes. ”

“You agree to be with me, right?” Nox confirmed with her again.

“In that case, can I sleep with you now?” Nox moved his body closer to her.

He really could not hold it in anymore. He did not seem any power to keep himself away from Shelly.

Shelly thought for a few seconds before replying, “Yes.”

With Shelly’s permission, Nox was even more impatient.

He pressed Shelly under his body and said to her seriously, “I will take responsibility for you.”

Shelly seemed to smile for a quick second. Even though it felt like an illusion,

Nox thought she was happy, so he had nothing to be concerned about. In truth, Shelly smiled because she found what he said a little funny and did not take his words to heart.

In the wee hours of the morning, Nox fell asleep, but Shelly could not. She stared blankly at the night sky outside, with the man behind her hugging her tightly in his arms, and she could hear his even breathing.

Shelly did not know why she could not sleep. For some reason, she was feeling very down. In fact, she had mentally prepared herself to get back together with Nox and sleep with him.

It was fine when they were in bed since Nox was taking the lead. After it was over, when she quieted down, her thoughts ran wild. She even thought of Benjamin. In the end, nothing happened between her and Benjamin, but she did it with Nox.

She shifted her body position, struggling free from Nox’s bear hug, and got down barefoot. She found the pajamas that Nox had thrown under the bed and put them on before walking out of the bedroom.

Then, she went to clean up the kitchen again and wiped the laundry sink clean. When she was done and ready to go back to her room, she hesitated and walked into Bella’s bedroom.

She really could not fall asleep lying next to Nox as she still had a deep-rooted rejection toward him. However, she thought that it might be better after some time.

Early the next morning, when Nox got up, he saw that Shelly was no longer by his side.

‘F*ck. Where did this woman go?’

He walked out in Shelly’s bathrobe to see that Shelly was already cooking in the kitchen.

“Do you wake up so early?” Nox asked as he rubbed his messy hair.

“Yes.” Shelly nodded.

She was used to it. After all, back when she was working, she used to wake up earlier in the morning.

“Aren’t you tired from last night?” Nox asked.

Shelly pursed her lips and said, “Not really.”

“Not really?” Nox smiled wickedly. “Does that mean I have to work harder tonight?”

With a blush on her face, Shelly said, “Bella is here. Stop talking.”

Nox looked at the little girl who was watching TV on the sofa

Then, he smiled happily. “In that case, I’ll go back to bed and sleep for a while. Let me know when it’s time to eat.”

“Sure.”

Seeing Nox turning around and walking into the room, Shelly sighed.

After she finished cooking the eggs, she plated them and placed the plate on the dining table. As it was a little hot and she wanted to cool it down a little longer, she did not go to get Nox.

She walked to Bella’s side and said, “Bella, we’re going to that uncle’s house later and live there, okay?”

Bella looked at her mother. “Are you talking about Uncle Nox?”

“Yes.” Shelly smiled. “He brought you back to me, so he’s a hero, right?”

Shelly did not want Bella to reject Nox anymore. Since Bella had been afraid of him before, she tried to put in a good word for Nox. “Yes.” Bella hurriedly nodded. “Uncle Nox is a great hero.”

“Will you be happy if we live with him?”

“I’m happy!”

Shelly patted Bella’s head. As long as Bella was happy, everything was fine. As for her, she was fine with anything. Ever since she broke up with Benjamin, she seemed to have become more open-minded and had let go of expectations for love.

She watched some cartoons with Bella for a while. When she figured that the eggs were cooled, she got up to let Nox know. However, Nox was lying on the bed, obviously asleep again, and Shelly hesitated if she should wake him up.

To be honest, Nox had a particularly bad temper, so she was afraid of being scolded for disturbing his sleep. As such, she stood by the bed for a while and decided not to wake him up. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When Nox woke up and walked out of the room, Shelly and Bella had already had breakfast and were having fun in the living room.

“Why didn’t you wake me up?” Nox asked Shelly in an unpleasant tone.

“You were sleeping soundly, so I didn’t want to disturb you.” Shelly climbed up from the cushion. “Are you hungry? I’ll get you your breakfast.”

Nox suppressed his anger and responded with a nod.

Then, Shelly placed the plate of eggs and some slices of bread in front of Nox.

“Have you eaten?” Nox asked.

“Yes.”

“Don’t let me eat alone next time.” Nox was a little unhappy as he felt like he had been abandoned.

“Alright,” Shelly agreed.

For some reason, Nox still felt unhappy. He was unhappy that Shelly was too submissive and that she agreed to everything he said!

Could it be that he tended to be abusive?
