1083 Great Satisfaction, Michael’s Tragic End

At that moment, all of Michael’s crimes were proven.

Michael glared at Monica with his bloodshot eyes.

He probably had never dreamed that he would fall into Monica’s hands one day. In his mind, he was the only one who could make use of Monica.

How was it possible that Monica could put him in such a state, making him lose his reputation and bringing him to his demise?

However, Monica did not react to Michael’s gaze. She did not even look at Michael as she coldly waited for Michael to be sentenced. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the courtroom, the judge said, “The defendant, Michael, do you have any objections to the crimes you’re being accused of in court?”

Michael’s gaze was fixed on Monica, but he could not say a word.

Since he had been exposed, and there was both witness and evidence, he had no way to refute it.

The judge asked again, “If the defendant, Michael, does not answer, this court will take it that you acquiesce to all your crimes.”

Again, Michael did not answer.

At that moment, he still had his pride. He would rather die than admit defeat in front of Monica.

“The defendants, Daniel Cook, Brie Larson, and Wally Fisk...” the judge read out the names of all the people. “Do you have any objections to crimes indicted in this court?”

“No, I don’t,” everyone answered.

Once he received an affirmative reply, the judge stood up from his seat and said, “The case will be adjourned for half an hour. The judges and I will–”

“Your Honor, I have another appeal to make,” Monica suddenly said.

At the moment when everyone was already feeling extremely satisfied, Monica calmly told the judge that she still wanted to file an appeal.

That sentence naturally caused another uproar among the crowd. They felt a sense of excitement like they were watching a show that was at a climax.

Therefore, everyone looked at Monica, the woman who had really undergone a transformation, with anticipation.

The judge frowned.

If it were not for the fact that the trial was live broadcasted on the internet and his superiors had instructed him to judge this lawsuit fairly, he would have rejected Monica’s sudden appeal again and again.

He said, “Does the plaintiff have any more crimes to sue the defendants present?”

“I’m suing Michael!” Monica said out loud.

The judge looked at Monica.

With Michael’s current situation, the death penalty was inevitable, and there was no need to accuse him again.

However, from the perspective of the law, as long as the accused was guilty, no matter what the accused was guilty of, he must be tried thoroughly.

“What are you suing him of? Is there any reliable evidence and legal proof?” the judge asked her.

“There is,” Monica answered. Then, she explained clearly, “I am suing Michael for using illegal means to obtain Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development information and illegally using it in Sunny Pharmaceutical’s products, which caused Cardellini Pharmaceutical to suffer a fatal blow!”

As soon as she said that, the audience was really amazed by Monica.

In the beginning, it was to protect her own rights, but now, it was clear that she was attacking him.

Monica’s ability was slowly showing, and everyone started to look at her in a different light!

At that moment, Michael, who had been pushed to his limit, had a huge emotional reaction because of Monica’s words.

He kept glaring at Monica, who he could not have and had been forced by him to grow into an unattainable figure!

He clenched his fists.

He knew very well that if Sunny Pharmaceutical was finished this time, he would have no chance of survival.

He was still hoping that the Sanders needed him to deal with Sunny Pharmaceutical. Then, he might still be of some use to the Sanders. In that way, at least he would not be executed immediately. Yet now, Monica had forced him to a dead end!

In the courtroom, Monica gave her evidence to Judah, who handed it to the judge and the jury.

Monica explained, “Cardellini Pharmaceutical has always been committed to the research and development of pharmaceutical products. Once the research and development are successful, no matter how expensive they cost, the profits of our products are extremely low. From the start, we have always served the people by making affordable drugs to give back to society. But now, the research and development of our company have been stolen by Sunny Pharmaceutical. The document I handed to you, Your Honor, and the jury are the inspection report of the drugs produced by our pharmaceutical company and Sunny Pharmaceutical on the market. The ingredients and dosage of the drugs are exactly the same. It’s impossible for such a coincidence to happen as Cardellini Pharmaceutical hasn’t disclosed made pharmaceutical technologies public.”
