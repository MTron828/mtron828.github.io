Chapter 177: Compared to Micheal, You’re Worthless, Finn!

Micheal’s words made Monica even more nervous. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She said, “I believe that Jeannie will never do anything illegal.”

“I also believe that, but the current situation is very disadvantageous to her.” Micheal echoed.

“The Sanders can do anything just because they’re in Harken?!” Monica gritted her teeth.

“Only the Swans can barely contend against them.” Micheal was straightforward.

Monica was stunned.

“In other words, if Fourth Master Swan makes a move, it might be of some use. Of course, the prerequisite is that Jeannie is really innocent. If her crime is established, no one can change the situation!”

“I’ll give Fourth Master Swan a call,” Monica quickly said.

Micheal nodded.

He was not giving Monica any advice.

Micheal simply wanted to know if Fourth Master Swan was serious about Jeanne, or if he was just using her as a shield for the Sanders.

He knew very well that his position in the imperial court was not high enough. If something happened to his dad, based on his dad’s power in the court over the years, he would have made countless enemies. The Rosses would most likely suffer a violent revenge. Therefore, Micheal needed to clear up all his connections and know which ones he could use.

Monica took out her phone and dialed nervously.

Nevertheless, a voice message came from the phone. “The number you have dialed is unavailable. Please try again later.”

Monica called several times, but the voice message kept repeating.

She was furious. “Fourth Master Swan turned off his phone at this time. Damn it!”

Micheal was also a little surprised at that moment.

“Can you send me to the Swans’ manor?” Monica made a prompt decision.

For Jeanne’s sake, she did not care anymore.

“Okay.” Micheal nodded.

He drove toward the Swans’ manor.

Micheal said purposely while driving, “Eden and Melody are on good terms now.”

Monica turned her head to look at him.

“Didn’t you see? He and Melody appeared in the detention center together,” Micheal reminded.

“That scum!” Monica gritted his teeth. “Jeanne was really blind back then to have met that kind of scum! Calling him a scum is an understatement! His lowly manner has really changed my view of people!”

“I also didn’t expect Eden to be such a person. As we were classmates, he had always asked me to help him connect with Melody. I couldn’t refuse him. I didn’t expect that he’s so close to Melody now.”

“In the future, you shouldn’t associate with such a man who forgets righteousness for profit,” Monica said firmly.

“Okay.” Micheal agreed immediately.

Monica was touched again.

Micheal always seemed to always listen to her.

The car soon arrived at the Swans’ manor.

Monica directly rushed into the Swans’ Bamboo Garden to look for Fourth Master Swan, but he was really not at home.

She rushed to the Swans’ main commercial building, but she still could not find Fourth Master Swan.

The key was that no one knew where he went. It was as if he had vanished!

‘Damn it.

‘He wouldn’t go so far as to go missing just to get rid of his relationship with Jeanne, right?!

‘Are all men from the Swans scums?!’

“What do we do now?” Micheal accompanied Monica to look for Fourth Master Swan. He asked her when the two of them returned to the car.

Monica gritted her teeth.

At this moment, she really wanted to kill someone.

“Why don’t I send you back first? If Fourth Master Swan really doesn’t want to see you and doesn’t want to interfere in this matter, everything we do will be in vain.”

Monica understood as well, but she was just… Furious.

“I’ll send you back to the Cardellini Enterprise?”

“Send me to the hospital.” Monica gritted her teeth.

“Hmm?” Micheal frowned.

“Finn and Fourth Master Swan have a bit of a relationship. I’ll go ask him.”

Micheal’s expression changed slightly.

Monica also noticed it at that moment.

She said, “Don’t think too much.”

“I’m not.” Micheal smiled slightly. “If you want to be with Finn, you wouldn’t have promised me again.”

Monica nodded.

“I’ll send you there.”

“Okay.”

Micheal parked the car at the entrance of the hospital.

Monica unfastened her seatbelt. “Micheal, go back first. I’ll call a taxi after I’m done.”

Micheal was a little hesitant.

“Didn’t you receive a lot of work calls just now? I’ve stalled you for a whole day. Don’t worry, it’s easy to call a taxi here.”

Micheal agreed hesitantly. “If you need anything, give me a call.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

At that moment, she hurriedly wanted to get out of the car.

The moment she opened the car door, her body suddenly tensed up.

Monica felt Micheal’s kiss on her lips.

She was stunned.

It was a peck.

After the kiss, neither of them was in a hurry to leave.

The two of them maintained a very close distance and looked at each other.

“Monica, I really miss you.” Micheal was extremely affectionate.

Monica pursed her lips.

For a second, she did not know how to answer.

Micheal did not make things too difficult for her. He kissed her forehead again. “Go.”

Monica looked at Micheal.

She looked at the man with a faint smile on her lips.

Afterward, she suddenly approached him and planted a kiss on his face.

Micheal was shocked.

He had always been the one who took the initiative between the two of them.

It did not matter if it was their previous relationship or his current initiative.

Monica said, “Micheal, thank you.”

Micheal smiled. When he smiled, he looked like the boy next door. “With this kiss of yours, I feel that everything I do is worth it.”

Monica blushed and was shy.

She pulled away from Micheal and said, “I’m getting out of the car.”

“Okay.”

Monica opened the car door and left.

Micheal watched her leave and suddenly turned around. He looked at the man in a white coat at the entrance of the hospital and sneered.

He drove away.

The man in the white coat also turned around and walked into the hospital.

Monica rushed into the hospital and quickly pressed the elevator that was about to close.

As soon as she entered, she was caught off guard by Finn.

The moment Monica was about to speak, she heard Finn say to the person next to her, “We’ve just sent away the medical team from Yarra. Next, you should organize the medical research that they left behind and report it to your leader in the afternoon.”

“Yes, Director,” the doctor next to Finn quickly replied.

Finn was arranging some work again, and he looked very serious.

Monica pursed her lips and chose to remain silent in the end.

It was until...

The elevator stopped.

Finn returned to his office.

Monica followed him.

From the beginning to the end, Finn treated her coldly like a stranger.

No matter how bad it was, they had lived under the same roof for several years. Monica did not know how Finn could be so indifferent to her.

‘Forget it.

‘I don’t care.’

If Monica wanted to argue with Finn, she would die of anger sooner or later.

She said, “Finn, Jeannie is in trouble.”

“Oh.”

Finn sat in his office, flipping through his medical documents as he responded.

Monica had said the same thing to Micheal.

What she received from Micheal was care and warmth.

On the other hand, what she received from Finn was indifference.

Monica said, “I just went to see Jeannie. Jeannie was wronged. She was deliberately framed by Melody, a member of the Sanders. The situation is very serious now. Other than Fourth Master Swan, I can’t find anyone else who can help Jeannie, but I can’t contact Fourth Master Swan right now. I hope you can help me find him.”

“I can’t contact him either,” Finn said bluntly.

“How do you know you can’t contact him if you haven’t tried?!” Monica was furious.

At this moment, she was infuriated.

Monica could tolerate Finn’s attitude, but she could not tolerate him trying to not get involved.

It was just a piece of cake. Did he have to treat her like this?!

Finn glanced at Monica.

He said, “Fourth Master Swan only has one number. If you can’t get through, I can’t get through either.”

“What about Nox?”

“Don’t you have Nox’s number too?” Finn raised his eyebrow.

Indeed.

Monica had also called Nox, but his phone was also switched off.

“What about the others? What about the other people around Fourth Master Swan?” Monica could not control her emotions at all.

“Fourth Master Swan only has Nox by his side. If we can’t contact him, that’s it.”

“Finn, do you not want to help me at all?” Monica said fiercely.

Finn pursed his lips.

“I thought that even if we don’t have any feelings for each other, at least we’re still friends. I think it’s normal for friends to help each other. Now I f*cking feel like I’m embarrassing myself.” Monica exploded.

Finn’s expression changed slightly.

“Forget it, forget I was here.” Monica turned around and was about to leave.

“Micheal can’t help you?” Finn, who was behind her, suddenly asked.

“Yeah.” Monica turned around and looked at Finn. “That said, compared to what Micheal gave me, you’re really worthless!”

Finn’s expression was obviously ugly.

Monica left after saying that.

She was so angry that her lungs were about to explode!

She must have been crazy to place her hopes on that b*stard.

Monica left.

Finn’s face was dark. He looked around then pulled open the drawer under his desk.

Inside was a copy of all the information regarding Jeanne’s case.
