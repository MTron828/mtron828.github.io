Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn drove Monica in the car at a slow speed.

Ever since the successful proposal yesterday, their relationship seemed to have risen to another level in an instant. Monica felt blissful as she looked at the back of Finn’s head from her seat.

Sometimes, if one had let go of their prejudices, they would let go of a lot of things. She finally understood that people were unhappy because they did not Imow how to be content. As a matter of fact, she was very content now. She was so happy that she could fly!

Suddenly, Monica’s phone rang. She glanced at the caller ID and quickly picked it up. “Jeannie.”

“You said you missed me, but now that you’re back, you didn’t even call me.”

Jeanne pretended to be angry.

“I didn’t come back until late last night.”

“Are you trying to say that you were proposed to as soon as you came back?”

Jeanne teased.

“I’m not showing off,” Monica retorted.

“That’s right. There’s no need to show off. You’re already the envy of the entire nation.”

Monica was speechless. She was indeed no match for Jeanne after the latter regained her memories!

“Why are you looking for me?” Monica decided to change the topic. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

About the proposal last night… Now that she thought about it, she was very happy but was still a little shy about how public it was.

“Since you’ve reconciled with Finn, you don’t need me anymore, right?”

“…God will punish me if you anger a pregnant lady like me!” Monica got angry.

Jeanne smiled. “Yes, yes, yes. Whatever you say is right, pregnant lady. I just wanted to say, since you’re back, do you want to come to Bamboo Garden for dinner?”

“Yes,” Monica agreed immediately.

However, the moment she agreed, she suddenly thought about something. “Let me see If Finn too.”

“Okay, let me know when you’ve asked him so that I can get Teddy to make more dinner.”

“Alright.”

Monica hung up the phone and said to Finn, “Jeannie wants us to have dinner at Bamboo Garden. Are you coming?”

“You can decide,” Finn said.

“By the way, will we be laughed at if we go?” Monica was thinking about that problem now.

“Why would you think that?” Finn frowned.

“Last night… Wasn’t it too corny?”

Finn was speechless. “Jeanne was the one who thought of the idea for the proposal last night.”

Monica glared at Finn.

Feeling Monica’s death stare, Finn smiled. “I didn’t think of the idea, but the feelings were all mine.”

Monica pursed her lips. She knew that she could not ask too much of Finn, whom she thought was suddenly enlightened.

The car drove toward Bamboo Garden. When Monica and Finn walked into the hall, Nox was there.

Edward had also returned amidst his busy schedule. Along with Jeanne, George, and Paige around, the house seemed very lively.

“Why is everyone here today?” Monica asked.

“I’m here to congratulate the two of you on getting back together.” Nox teased, “I wonder who said you guys would never get back together again some time ago, yet the proposal was successful…’

“Are you here to mock me or to congratulate me?” Monica was displeased.

“I sincerely wish you both a happy marriage,” Nox said seriously.

Monica could not be bothered to deal with Nox, so she walked straight to

Jeanne and hugged her. “Jeannie”

As she was hugging Jeanne, Nox looked at Monica and said, “Jeannie? You haven’t lost your mind, have you? What did you call her?”

Everyone was stunned for a second. Did that mean Nox was not in the know of what everybody knew?

In the next second, Monica smiled evilly. “Nox, how are you Fourth Master’s best friend?”

“You are indeed possessed.” Nox did not take what Monica said to heart and said to Finn, “Finn, go back and do a ritual for your wife. I suspect that she’s possessed.”

Finn pursed his lips while hugging Monica in his arms, looking extremely possessive and protective.

“Nox, come with me,” Edward suddenly said.

Nox frowned. “I’m going out for dinner. I have to meet Zoe’s parents to discuss the final details of the marriage. Tonight, the parents of both parties will officially meet to discuss the marriage. I can’t be late.”

“Come with me first,” Edward said straightforwardly. “Finn, come with us.”

After that, Finn reluctantly let go of Monica and followed Edward and Nox to the back garden.

Monica looked at the three of them and said to Jeanne, “I think Nox will have a mental breakdown..”
