Chapter 86: Finn and Monica’s Relationship Exploded

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After Jeanne, Michael, and the others left, Monica also felt that it was meaningless.

She said disinterestedly, “Then I’ll leave first.”

“Aren’t you going to celebrate Finn’s birthday with him? We haven’t even eaten the cake.” Nox frowned.

“Aren’t you going to accompany him? Besides, he doesn’t want me to accompany him.” Monica smiled and said to Finn, “I thought your girl came to celebrate your birthday with you. Why did she leave early?”

Finn did not answer Monica.

Monica often felt that she was wasting her time with Finn.

She rolled her eyes, turned around, picked up her bag, and walked out.

Monica just opened the door and walked out when she suddenly felt a pain in her wrist.

She felt a gust of wind behind her, and then she was grabbed by someone. It was so painful that she was dragged away in the next second.

Monica was wearing a pair of 10-cm high heels. Under brute force, she was forced to run and almost sprained her ankle several times.

“Finn, you son of a b*tch, are you going crazy again? Let go of me!”

Finn shoved Monica into a special car at the entrance of King-T.

As it was a high-class club, all the high-class cars at the entrance were used to send guests away for free.

Finn gave the driver an address.

The driver quickly drove to the destination.

Monica, who was sitting in the back seat, fiercely shook off Finn’s hand and rubbed her slender wrist, looking unhappy.

Finn did not say anything. He just looked out of the window coldly. From the beginning to the end, Monica only saw the back of Finn’s head.

Monica was filled with anger.

‘This scum has a fit from time to time!’

The car stopped at a residential area.

Finn opened the car door and rudely dragged Monica out of the car.

“I can walk on my own. Let me go, f*ck!” Monica wanted to kill this scum!

Which eye of hers was blind enough to fall for him back then? Which eye of hers thought that he was the most suitable husband as he was a gentle and modest young master?!

She was filled with regret!

Back at home, Finn did not let go of her and slammed her against the wall at the entrance.

Monica was so restrained that she could not move. She roared furiously, “Divorce! I want a divorce right now... Hng.”

Monica widened her eyes.

She looked straight at Finn who approached her.

‘Am I being possessed tonight, or is everyone possessed?’

She was forcefully kissed by two men in one night.

How coquettish was she dressed tonight?!

Not to mention Michael, how could she make Finn, who had always looked down on her, kiss her uncontrollably?!

While she was daydreaming...

“Ah!” Monica screamed.

Finn bit her. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Monica’s eyes were red from the pain.

‘Damn it, what a scum!

‘He was born a scum!’

“Did Michael kiss you like that?” Finn asked Monica. He still pushed her against the wall and lowered his voice to ask her.

“It’s none of your business!” Monica had a bad temper.

“Do you know that you cheated in your marriage?”

“I’m still f*cking abstinent in my marriage! What right do you have to say that I cheated? Have you satisfied me? It has been three years. Have I f*cking touched a finger of yours?” Monica directed all her anger at Finn.

‘I’ve had enough!

‘I’ve suppressed myself to live with Finn all these years. I’ve had enough!’

Finn’s cold expression seemed to be slightly moved at this moment.

He asked, “You care about that?”

“I don’t care anymore.” Monica was very calm. “It’s just a formal marriage between us. What’s there to care about?”

“Monica,” Finn called out to her.

His voice seemed to be a little different from usual.

Monica looked at him.

She looked straight at him.

“Do you want to sleep with me?” Finn suddenly asked her.

Monica’s head seemed to have been hit at that moment. She did not come back to her senses for a long time.

“Didn’t you want to know what our relationship is?” Finn stared at Monica and said slowly, “I’ll tell you after tonight.”

As soon as he finished, he moved toward her lips.

“Are you drunk?” Monica’s eyes moved slightly.

Finn stopped close to her lips. “No.”

“Didn’t your lover satisfy you this time?”

Finn’s expression changed slightly.

Monica pushed Finn away.

Finn looked at her.

“What relationship do we have? We live under the same roof and aren’t even as good as friends,” Monica said bluntly.

Finn’s throat moved slightly. “Is this your answer?”

“Michael and I have started over again,” Monica said without hiding anything, “Starting from tonight.”

Finn looked at her coldly and smiled sarcastically.

“Finn, let’s get a divorce.” Monica looked at him. “I’m serious this time.”

After she finished, she did not wait for Finn’s answer.

In any case, she had decided that she would go back tomorrow and tell her parents about it.

She turned around and was about to leave.

“Back then, you pursued me on a whim, right?” Finn asked her.

Monica pursed her lips.

“To be able to fall into the arms of another man in one night, I was indeed overestimating myself,” Finn mocked himself.

“Finn, are you even a man?” The flames that Monica swallowed suddenly rose again.

Finn’s eyes moved slightly.

“Was I crazy? I brought you breakfast so early in the morning. I’ve never woken up at 5:00 am in my f*cking life! I waited for you to finish your night shift in the middle of the night. South Hampton City’s winter is so cold. Do you know that I had a fever for a week? Was I f*cking crazy? Taking the risk of being beaten to death by my father, I bought all the advertising spots in South Hampton City on your birthday. I made you a f*cking cake myself and almost blew up the kitchen! I did it on a f*cking whim, didn’t I? Finn, we’re just breaking up. Do you have to put all the blame on me? Don’t you think you’re f*cking dirty?!”

Monica was not the kind of person who would keep everything to herself. She would tell Finn everything she was unhappy with.

Even at this moment, she was still brooding over it. She was still brooding over the fact that she went crazy back then and did so much to Finn.

Now that she said it out loud, she felt disgusted to death.

“Forget it, do whatever you want! Anyway, this relationship is over for me!” Monica did not want to fuss over it anymore.

If she thought too much, she would kill herself.

“Have you heard my explanation?”

Monica frowned.

“Have you heard the explanation between me and Patsy? You don’t know anything, so why did you kiss Michael?!” Finn’s suppressed anger was completely released at this moment.

It was as if everything from that year had been revealed in front of them.

Everything that both parties had decided not to mention was laid bare.

“Explain? How?” Monica sneered. “Patsy was lying naked on your bed. Was that a misunderstanding? Even if it was, did I also f*cking misunderstand you for touching her body?!”

“Monica!” Finn called out to her fiercely. “I’m a doctor! Putting aside my identity as a man, I’m a f*cking doctor!”
