Chapter 597: Jonathan’s Fate, The Cold-blooded Lawrence Family

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Enough!” Jonathan’s expression was grim.

On one hand, a noisy family was annoying him, and on the other, Alexander and Joshua still could not understand who they had to rely on to grow the company. Moreover, they even went against Jeanne so openly! If he did not have Alexander as his only son, he would have given up on them long ago!

Jonathan still had the authority. With one sentence, Joshua did not dare to speak anymore. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Apologize to your sister!” Jonathan ordered.

Joshua looked at Jonathan in disbelief. “Why?”

“Because you hit your sister!”

“I didn’t hit her. I really didn’t. She fell on purpose. She’s the one pretending to be pitiful. She–” Joshua was angry.

“Joshua!” Jonathan’s face was black.

“I didn’t do it. I won’t apologize even if I die!” Joshua still had his temper.

As the only son in the family, he was always more domineering than the others!

“No need,” Jeanne said.

It was as if she was giving Joshua a way out.

“I’m not hurt. Moreover, an insincere apology means nothing,” Jeanne said generously. However, she said sarcastically, “Grandpa, it’s getting late, so I’ll head back first. I don’t want to stay for too long and make everyone unhappy. Goodbye.”

Jonathan glared at Joshua, his expression extremely ugly.

However, he was gentle toward Jeanne. “I’ll send you to the door.”

“Thank you, grandpa.”

With that, Jonathan saw Jeanne out.

Meanwhile, Joshua was so angry that he wanted to kill Jeanne. It was clearly Jeanne who did it on purpose. Why should it be his fault?

His eyes were bloodshot, and he was on the verge of going mad.

Jonathan sent Jeanne off and returned. When he faced Joshua, his expression was still grim. “Be careful in the future. You’re not allowed to provoke her!”

Instead of speaking, Joshua clenched his fists tightly.

“This will not happen again!” Jonathan said coldly and left.

As soon as Jonathan left, Joshua could not help but fly into a rage.

“I really want to kill Jeanne. I want to kill her!”

“Enough!” Jonathan shouted at him. “You’re nowhere near as capable as her. You deserve to be schemed against!”

Alexander saw it clearly, but what was the use of saying it out loud? After all, Jonathan would not believe it at all.

In Jonathan’s eyes, only the oh-so-capable Jeanne existed! Why would he care about the rest of them?

“Dad.” Joshua was so angry that his eyes were red. “When can we actually–”

Alexander gave him a look.

Joshua gritted his teeth. “I’ve really had enough of this. If this continues, I don’t know what I’ll do!”

After saying that, Joshua left in a huff.

Jenifer looked at her son’s angry appearance and whispered into Alexander’s ear, “If this goes on, even if your father doesn’t give the Lawrences to Jeanne, she will tear our family apart.”

Alexander’s expression turned cold, and a trace of cruelty flickered in his eyes.

…

In the quiet night, Jeanne tossed and turned in bed, unable to fall asleep.

Today, Edward had not called her for an entire day, and she had a feeling that things were not simple.

She sat up from the head of the bed, considering whether to call Edward.

In fact, she was not holding herself back from calling him. She was just afraid that she would disturb him.

She knew his departure this time was not as simple as it seemed.

Hence, she thought about it and still made the call in the end.

Before the call could connect, another call interrupted hers.

Jeanne looked at Monica’s call and was a little surprised.

It was so late — 2 a.m. in the morning, yet Monica was still awake.

She immediately hung up the call to Edward and picked up Monica’s call.

As soon as the call connected, Monica said anxiously, “Jeannie, did you know your grandfather has passed away?”

Jeanne was stunned.

Monica hurriedly said over the phone, “I had some insomnia, so I was scrolling through my phone. Then, I scrolled through the news of your grandfather’s death. It seemed it was an accident and that he fell from the second floor. When the maid found out, he was already dead, and they didn’t have time to resuscitate him. Sigh. Go and look at the information your father posted on his personal social media platform. It shouldn’t be fake.”

Indeed, it was not fake.

However, she was just surprised that Alexander acted so fast.

After all, Jonathan was still Alexander’s father, and he protected Alexander wholeheartedly.

After so many years, did he not feel anything for his father?
