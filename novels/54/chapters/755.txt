Chapter 756: Monica and Michael’s Conflict

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

However, Reese’s appearance today made Monica lose all her patience.

It wasn’t just Reese’s attitude toward her. It was also the fact that Reese thought that she and Michael would end up together no matter what. Does that mean the rest of the world had the same opinion too?

The longer this dragged on, the easier it would be for others to misunderstand.

Might as well end it quickly.

It was what she’s set out to achieve anyway.

Monica headed to bed and went back to sleep.

In any case, she was never serious about working. She didn’t want her father to grow hopeful either.

Just let her be a worm for a little while longer.

She would think about it once she’s dealt with her messy feelings.

Monica covered herself with the blanket and tried to sleep, but sleep evaded her.

She kept thinking if Finn would be moved if she and Michael broke up completely.

Even if it was no longer possible for a future with Finn, Monica wanted to prove that she had made the right choice back then.

...

Back at the Lawrence Enterprise, Jeanne was working on the papers in her hands.

Amy knocked and entered.

“Director Lawrence, here’s an invitation.” Amy placed a delicate looking invitation in front of Jeanne. “The world’s most famous antique tycoon, Mr. William Gates, has announced his official return to Harken. He’s going to set up the largest antique trading appreciation club in South Hampton City. All the upper-class dignitaries in South Hampton City have been invited to his private banquet tonight at seven o’clock.”

Jeanne picked up the invitation and glanced at it.

The world’s largest antique collector, William Gates.

It was said that as long as you could name the appropriate price, he would be able to help you get the antique and guarantee the authenticity.

Such a legendary figure hailed from Harken. But as he had been overseas in recent years, he did not have much interaction with people from Harken. Now that he’s returned, he invited all the upper-class society to the banquet, which means that he’s looking to achieve something huge in Harken.

Jeanne set the invitation aside.

Amy asked, “Is Director Lawrence going?”

“I will,” Jeanne said.

How could she miss out on attending such a banquet?

Moreover, William Gates was a big shot. This was the first time he had invited her, so she could not turn it down. That would be rude.

“Shall I prepare a gown for you, director?”

“No need. I’ll settle that myself. Just make an appointment in advance.”

“Sure, director,” Amy said respectfully and left.

Jeanne glanced at the invitation again. She thought for a moment before picking up her phone and sending a text.

[Jeannie: Did you receive William Gates’s invitation?]

[Ed: Yes, I did. Did you get it too?]

[Jeannie: Yeap, let’s go pick our outfits later.]

[Ed: My pleasure.]

A smile tugged at the corners of Jeanne’s mouth.

Just as she was about to put down her phone, Kingsley called.

She pursed her lips.

For some reason, every time she received a call from Kingsley Thorn, she felt terrified.

It always felt like something major would happen in the next second.

“Hey.”

“Is there a banquet going on in South Hampton City tonight?” Kingsley asked straightforwardly.

They’ve always been brief on the phone. It was as if he could not waste a second. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, there’s one.”

“William Gates?”

“Yeah. Is something wrong with him?” Jeanne frowned.

“He’s a big shot and the Sanders wants him.”

“They want me to rope him in?”

The Sanders probably thought she was omnipotent.

“No, they’re sending their precious princess.”

“If I remember correctly, William Gates is almost 40 years old. Would the Sanders let their precious daughter seduce him? She’s only in her early twenties.”

“Nothing’s impossible. The Sanders would do anything to rope someone in.”

“What do you need me to do?”

“I’m just letting you know so you’re in the loop.”

“Alright.”

“Did you find anyone suspicious around Edward Swan?”

“No,” Jeanne replied. “Did you find any clues on your end?”

“The Sanders had their people watching Dr. Finn. And Dr. Finn must’ve found out about that, so he hasn’t gone anywhere suspicious. Most of the time, he’s at home. Occasionally, he goes out for meals, and to the hospital. So there’s nothing for the past month.”

“Where exactly did the Swans hide that person?!” Jeanne said, confused.

“I’m baffled too.” Kingsley said, “This is the first time in a while that I have such poor control over something. I suspect even I might not be able to locate this person.”

Even Kingsley was rendered helpless. What had the Swans done?

Logically speaking, there would definitely be clues if this person existed.

To be able to hide so well…

How did they do it?

“Let’s not worry about it for now. The Sanders have their arrangements. We only have to do as they say.” Kingsley didn’t want to make things difficult for Jeanne.

After all, he did not expect it would be so difficult to investigate that person.

Initially, he’d thought that it would be more troublesome if that person did not return to South Hampton City.

Unexpectedly, when that person returned, there’s still any clues that he could find.

It was out of his control now.

Shall he just wait it out the fight between the two families and swoop in for the kill?
