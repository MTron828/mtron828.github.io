Monica could not refuse him, so she said, “In that case, wait for me. I’ll come out to get it.”

“Okay.”

After that, Monica hung up the phone.

Ruby asked, “Who is it?”

Instead of answering Ruby’s question, Monica said, “I’m going to the gate for a while.”

After saying that, she quickly walked out to the gate.

“Be careful. Don’t walk so fast with your crutches.” Ruby reminded her worriedly.

Nevertheless, Monica walked to the door as fast as she could, where she saw Michael’s car parked at the gate. By then, Michael had gotten out of the car and was waiting for her.

Seeing her show up, he quickly walked over and handed Monica a tightly wrapped gift box. “This is for your mother.”

“You’re too kind.” Monica was actually a little embarrassed.

“It’s just a token of my appreciation. I’ll be leaving now.” Michael did not say much.

As if he did not want Monica to feel too embarrassed, he turned around and was about to return to the car when he suddenly heard some voices at the door.

Michael turned his head only to see Finn.

At that moment, his expression darkened, even though he had disguised himself very well.

Finn did not even look at Michael and Monica. He walked straight to his car with Sarah following him. Curious about Michael, Sarah could not help but ask, “Is he my soon-to-be cousin-in-law?”

“No, don’t talk nonsense,” Monica berated Sarah.

“Oh, I know. He’s the youngest director in the history of Harken, Michael, with a bright future ahead.”

“You flatter me.” Michael was very polite.

“Although you’re outstanding, you must treat my cousin well!” Sarah reminded him seriously.

“Of course.”

“Hurry up and leave.” Monica did not want Sarah to talk any more nonsense, so she urged Sarah to leave.

When Sarah saw that Finn was already in the car, she quickly ran over and sat in the front passenger seat.

After that, the car drove away.

Michael looked in the direction the car left and turned back to look at Monica. He could sense that Monica was in a very low mood.

“That person just now, is she your cousin?” Michael asked.

Monica nodded. “She’s my uncle’s daughter. She’s on very good terms with my mother and often stays at our house.”

“Oh.”Michael nodded. “Is she on very good terms with Finn too?”

“Sarah said she likes Finn,” Monica said through gritted teeth. “All she knows is how to think about things other than studying.”

“Finn is quite popular.” Michael smiled faintly.

Monica did not answer him. It was obvious that she was unhappy about it.

“I’m going to take my leave.” Michael knew that he could not say too much at that moment.

If he said too much, Monica would think he was deliberately slandering Finn. Over the years, he had been learning from his father to understand people and what he had to do when he was faced with someone.

“Wait,” Monica said. “My parents are going to spend the night alone, so I’ll leave after I give the gift to my mother. If It’s on the way for you, can you send me back?”

“I’ll wait for you then.”

Monica went back and gave the gift to her mother without saying who gave it to her. Then, she quickly got into Michael’s car.

Michael drove her back.

On the journey back, Monica was very quiet, and Michael did not say much either. Every time she did not want to speak, Michael would accompany her silently.

It also made her wonder why the person she liked was not Michael.

Why did she still like Finn after he broke up with her? However, a breakup with Michael was a real breakup.

If the person she liked was Michael, she might not feel so bad.

In the quiet car, Michael’s phone suddenly rang.

He picked it up. “Mom.”

“Michael, come back quickly. Your second great-uncle has brought your aunt and uncle to our house. He’s very emotional, and I can’t handle it.” Her voice sounded a little anxious.

It made Michael a little anxious as well. “Mom, calm him down first. I’ll be there right away.”

After hanging up the phone, Michael drove faster.

Monica was also surprised by Michael speeding. “What’s wrong?”

“My second great-uncle is the relative who asked us to help my cousin to enter the Cardellini Enterprise’s research team. Now, he’s causing trouble at our house, so I have to go back and take a look,” Michael said quickly and anxiously. “Should I send you back first or–”

“No need. Let’s go to your mother’s place right now in case something happens.”

“Okay.” Michael did not refuse and directly drove to the Ross family’s manor.

Just as he entered the hall, he heard the sound of something being thrown.

Michael hurriedly went over and grabbed an old man. “Second great-uncle, what are you doing?”
