He just stood at the door.

“If you have something to say, say it here.” Shelly stopped smiling and suddenly said.

She did not want Nox to enter her house either.

“I can’t explain it right now. Let’s go to your house and sit down and talk!” Nox came back to his senses and quickly said.

“We can talk while standing,” Shelly said determinedly.

It made Nox angry again. Could he not just enjoy the nice moment when he was not angry at Shelly for a little longer?

Nox suppressed his emotions and took a deep breath, trying to get himself to compromise. Just as he was about to speak..

“Shelly, the washed clothes are cold…” Benjamin came out wearing Shelly’s pink bathrobe with the washed clothes in hand. However, when he saw Nox at the door, he stopped talking.

At that moment, Nox felt that his head was about to explode. He even felt as if his vision had turned black and he was going to faint from anger! He was as angry as the time when he was almost angered to death by his grandfather!

He clenched his fists tightly, and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked like he wanted to kill someone. Nevertheless, he gritted his teeth and asked Shelly, “Why can he enter your house, but you won’t let me in?”

“Why should I let you in?” Shelly asked.

Shelly’s words rendered Nox speechless. He should enter because…

Shelly looked at Nox who was about to explode with anger, but she remained indifferent to him. She was frighteningly cold. “If you have something to say, just say it here. If not, please leave.”

Nox really felt that he had made a fool of himself! Why did he come here? To see Shelly and Benjamin living together? Did he come to see Benjamin in Shelly’s bathrobe wandering around her house? Was he here to humiliate Shelly?

Shelly frowned, looking displeased because he was standing in front of her and not saying a word. It made her feel that he was wasting her time. “What do you want to say?” Shelly was obviously impatient.

What did he want to say?

He wanted to tell her that he did not want Zoe’s child regardless of whether the child was his or not. In other words, he would no longer have anything to do with Zoe.

He also wanted to tell her that he had evidence that Zoe had drugged him. Once Zoe had an abortion, he could send her to prison and clear her name.

Moreover, he wanted to tell her that everything he did to her before was because he was deliberately finding fault with her, and he did that because her coldness toward him made him unhappy.

Lastly, he wanted to tell her that the reason why he was unhappy with her coldness to him was because… he had fallen in love with her.

Nox looked at Shelly. There were so many things he wanted to tell Shelly seriously, even though he knew there was a risk that she would laugh at him.

He also wanted to be with Shelly again. Although he did not want to admit it, he had fallen in love with Shelly. Edward was right. When he was going to marry Zoe, he did indeed hesitate because he already had feelings for Shelly.

In fact, he did not think that he would fall in love with Shelly one day. He had always believed that he would fall in love with anyone else but Shelly. However, feelings would sometimes catch one off guard.

He did not even know when he had fallen in love with Shelly. When did he start liking her more and more? He liked her so much that he could not lie to himself or hide his love for her… He just wanted to have her to himself.

In fact, over the past few days, he had been waiting for Shelly to look for him. As long as she took the initiative, he could put down his pride and get back together with Shelly.

Even if she did not take the initiative and had only looked for him to tell him that Zoe was pregnant but not because she wanted anything from him, he had compromised. He loved her so much that he had no choice but to compromise! However, what did he get in exchange for compromising?

In exchange, he got Shelly’s indifference toward him; in exchange, he had to witness Shelly living with another man.

His bloodshot eyes looked at Shelly and then Benjamin, who was wearing Shelly’s bathrobe and walking around her house as though it was a matter of course. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The bathrobe was obviously too small for Benjamin, and it made him look comical and ugly..
