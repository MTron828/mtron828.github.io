Chapter 1526: Side Story: The Birth of Kingsley’s Son

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Kingsley, too, was stunned.

“Stop interfering. Get out!” Lucy glared at Kingsley, visibly in a bad temper.

She was already annoyed that the baby was not out yet. Could Kingsley be any more annoying, asking her every three minutes whether she had given birth yet and whether she wanted a C-section?

She was an assassin, but she could not even give birth to a child. Would it not be a joke if word got out?

“Can you still push?” Not only was Kingsley not angry, but his voice was also very gentle.

“I can! Hurry up and get out of here!” Lucy scolded Kingsley.

Seeing Lucy in such good spirits, Kingsley reluctantly left the delivery room. However, he was still worried about her after leaving the delivery room, so he told the doctor to prepare anesthesia for a C-section at any time.

The delivery room was not soundproof. As Jeanne and Kingsley were waiting outside with only a curtain between them, Lucy could hear whatever Kingsley said.

She could not take it anymore and said to the midwife, “Take Kingsley away! ” How would a midwife dare to do that?

“If he doesn’t leave, I won’t be able to push the baby out.” Lucy could not take it anymore.

However, the midwife also felt that Mr. Thorn was a stumbling block in Ms. Harmon delivering the baby. As such, she braced herself and walked out.

“Has she delivered the baby?” Kingsley was very excited.

Jeanne rolled her eyes. If Lucy did, he would have heard the baby crying. The fact that there was no crying proved that the baby was still in Lucy’s belly.

“Ms. Harmon has told you to leave temporarily, or it’ll affect her delivery.” The doctor was prepared to be beaten to death by Kingsley.

Unexpectedly, Kingsley did not move at all. In fact, he looked a little… hurt.

He said, “Can you ask her whether I can stay if I don’t try not to talk?”

Was he… begging her?

The doctor was shocked.

“You can’t keep quiet. Once you speak, it will affect me.” Lucy heard him and shouted at him from inside.

“I promise I won’t say anything, ” Kingsley promised.

“You can’t pace back and forth either.” Lucy made another request.

As soon as Kingsley started pacing, she would feel inexplicably flustered.

“I can’t even walk?”

“If you can’t do it, leave!”

“I can do it,” Kingsley immediately said.

After that, Lucy kept quiet.

In the delivery room, Lucy’s scream rang out again, and Kingsley stood at the door, not daring to move or ask. His expression looked a little ferocious.

Fortunately, after half an hour of Kingsley’s silence, Lucy successfully gave birth to a baby boy. Suddenly, a cry sounded throughout the entire manor.

Jeanne heaved a sigh of relief. After all, she still remembered how painful the process was when she gave birth to George back then.

“Mr. Thorn, Ms. Harmon has given birth to a big fat boy for you,” the doctor said excitedly.

Kingsley did not say a word at this moment. He just stood rooted to the ground, not moving, as if he had frozen.

“Mr. Thorn, Ms. Harmon has given birth to your child. Both the mother and son are safe.” The doctor thought Kingsley did not hear her, so she hurriedly repeated herself again. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You can talk and move now!” Lucy’s voice suddenly came from the delivery room.

Everyone was petrified. Did that mean Mr. Thorn was silent because he did not get Ms. Harmon’s permission? The fact that their big boss was like a different person when he was in love scared them!

Kingsley rushed into the delivery room in the next second and saw Lucy’s pale face covered in sweat.

“Does it hurt?” Kingsley asked.

Actually, compared to the training she had received when she was an assassin, it was alright. In any case, it was bearable.

“You must be tired.” Seeing that Lucy did not reply to him, Kingsley spoke again.

His face was filled with love.

“I thought I would never let you get hurt again in this life, but I still let it happen.”

“Giving birth doesn’t hurt me,” Lucy retorted.

“But you’re in so much pain.”

“This pain… is nothing.”

She had almost lost an arm or a leg before, and childbirth was nothing compared to that. Besides, ordinary women would also experience childbirth, and every woman could take it. What was there to feel sorry about?

“We’ll only have one child,” Kingsley suddenly promised.

Lucy was at a loss for words. Since she had gotten pregnant once, she actually wanted to have a second child — a daughter, specifically. That was what she thought when she found out it was a son.

“Mr. Thorn, do you want to cut the umbilical cord for the baby yourself?” the midwife asked.

Kingsley’s eyes were only on Lucy.

“You cut it,” Lucy said.

Kingsley took the scissors and cut the umbilical cord off.

The room was filled with the sound of the baby crying, but Kingsley did not ask about him at all. It was as though he had forgotten that he was a father.

If the doctor had not carried the child over and placed him in front of Kingsley, Kingsley might have forgotten about his son.

“Mr. Thorn, do you want to hold your son?”

Kingsley was a little annoyed that the doctor kept disturbing him and Lucy.

“Hold him,” Lucy said.

With that, Kingsley let go of Lucy’s hand and carried the baby. He examined his

son for a few seconds before saying to Lucy, “He’s a little ugly.” Speechless, Lucy screamed in her head, ‘Is this the first thing you say to your

“He’s probably not as handsome as me.” Kingsley thought about it and commented.

Lucy’s eyes almost popped out of her sockets.

Was Kingsley aware that he was handsome? She thought that he had never cared about his appearance, even though he was really handsome.

“I’d like to hold him.” Lucy did not want to hear Kingsley’s comments about her son anymore, so she reached her hand out.

“No, you can’t. You’re too tired. You need to rest.”

After unloading all that weight, she suddenly felt so much lighter and relaxed. She even felt strong enough to kill a cow.

“I’ll hold him,” Jeanne said from the side.

Kingsley handed his son to Jeanne, not looking happy to be a father at all. It made Lucy wonder whether she or he wanted to have the child. He was the one who made her pregnant, yet in the end, he did not like the child at all.

The more time Lucy spent with the baby, the more obvious Kingsley’s dislike for the child. As the baby needed milk, he would always sleep with Lucy, so Lucy’s attention was mostly on the baby.

Every time that happened, Kingsley would take the baby away. As the baby was very attached to Lucy, from time to time, they would fight over the child.

Those who did not know would think that two people were fighting over the baby, while those who knew would know that Kingsley did not want the baby to be too close to Lucy while he was ignored.

Lucy was on the verge of breaking down. It was said that men would become more mature and responsible when they became fathers, but Kingsley was the complete opposite. After becoming a father, he was a hundred times more childish than before.

Fortunately, after being carried away from Lucy’s arms by Kingsley many times, the baby seemed to have gotten used to Kingsley’s embrace. Later on, he gradually began to cling to Kingsley. If Kingsley did not hold him to sleep, he would cry loudly, and every time the baby cried, Lucy would think that he had bullied the baby. Hence, Kingsley had no choice but to pick up his son again and hold him.

Then, everyone in the industry knew that Kingsley had become a super dad!
