Gary chimed in, “You wanted me to save you, but I was so far away from you. Fortunately, I called Michael, and he happened to be near your house. Otherwise… the consequences would’ve been unimaginable. Monica, why do you have to force yourself to this point for Finn?”

Monica looked straight at Michael, who had made up another lie to deceive her parents.

She really did not know how dark human nature could be or how sinister Michael could be.

She bit her lip, not saying anything.

“It was my fault for not noticing what Monica was going through that led to such an outcome. If I had, I wouldn’t have left her alone at home.” Michael seemed to blame himself.

Monica just stared at him. She really wanted to how far he could go to disguise himself and why on earth would he do such a thing.

“It’s not your fault.” Gary said, “In fact, I have to thank you. Monica lost too much blood, and the hospital’s blood bank is tight. If you didn’t have the same blood type as Monica and transfused blood to Monica, the consequences would’ve been… Even I dare not think about it.”

It turned out Michael had transfused blood to her, and that was why he looked so weak.

Monica really wanted to dig out all the blood and return it to him because the thought of having his blood in her body made her nauseous.

Michael saw the emotions in her eyes, but he pretended that he did not see anything. He maintained his gentlemanly manners and continued to converse with her parents.

He said, “Uncle, Auntie, can I have a few words with Monica alone?”

Gary quickly agreed. “Of course. Ruby, let’s step out first.”

Ruby let go of Monica’s hand and happily left with Gary.

In the ward, only Michael and Monica were left.

When their eyes met, Michael put away all the expressions on his face.

Monica said, “It turns out you’re really good at acting.”

She sneered at him contemptuously.

However, Michael pretended not to see it.

Instead, he said bluntly, “I told your parents that you took the initiative to ask to marry me after you repeatedly tried to get back together with Finn but were rejected by him. However, Finn still didn’t change his mind after you announced your marriage, so you couldn’t think straight and committed suicide.”

Monica snorted.

Michael really knew how to put down others while making himself seem great.

What a sinister man he was. How was she so blind back then to think that he treated her the best?

“I saved you and gave you a blood transfusion. Your parents are completely touched by me.” Michael looked at Monica.

He saw all the expressions on her face, but he was indifferent to them; he did not care.

He said, “You can tell your parents that you committed suicide because I forced you to marry me, and I believe your parents will believe you and not me. I don’t care if you have a fallout with me, but I’m sure that I’ll marry you, and your parents won’t be able to do anything about it. If you want them to know that you’re living a hard life, that’s fine with me. However, you should know that when your dad found out that you committed suicide, he almost had a heart attack. If I hadn’t comforted him and even guaranteed that you would be fine, you might not have been able to see your dad when you opened your eyes.”

“Michael, how can you be so despicable?” Monica gritted her teeth. At that moment, no matter how much she tried to hold it on, she could not tolerate it anymore.

How could he use her parents to threaten her?

“Whether you want your parents to worry about you is up to you.” Michael said coldly, “Of course, if you still want to die, I can’t watch over you 24 hours a day. However, I can tell you that unless you’re dead, you’ll definitely marry me.”

“Michael, you will be punished by the Gods one day!” Monica cursed him viciously.

She wished he would meet with an accident and die as soon as he exited the hospital.

Michael said, “As I said before, for you, I’m not afraid. ”

“Do you love me, Michael? Have you ever loved me?” Monica asked him fiercely.

If he loved her, why would he make her life so miserable that she would commit suicide?

“I do love you.” Michael’s tone was firm. “In this world, I’ve never loved any other woman except you.”
