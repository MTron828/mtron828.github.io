1371 I Love You More Than You Think

She was an adult, and neither was she missing an arm or a leg.

“I was afraid you’d be too weak.”

“I’m not,” Candice retorted.

“If you’re not weak, you wouldn’t have fallen on your face just now.”

‘You should have been the one to fall on your face instead,’ Candice thought.

As if he could read Candice’s mind, Edward smiled and coaxed Candice, “Be good. Open your mouth.”

Candice looked at Edward and how determined he was, so she opened her mouth obediently. She could not believe she was so easily bewitched by the man.

She ate the toast that Edward fed her, and it was really delicious. Having been fed the delicious food, she decided not to forgive him.

The room was filled with love.

Candice finished it all in one go. In the end, only the crust and crumbs were left on the plate.

Edward asked, “Was it delicious?”

“Yes.” Candice nodded.

In fact, she did not expect herself to have such a big appetite and finish all the eggs on toast. It was shocking. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Do you still want more?”

Candice shook her head as she felt very full from eating. If she ate more, she would gain another two pounds.

“In that case, I’ll eat it,” Edward said bluntly.

Candice was shocked, but she watched as Edward ate the crusts and crumbs.

For some reason, she felt a little emotional. She did not expect Edward to be so comfortable with her. Nothing much was left on the plate, and there was her saliva on the food…

Edward finished her food and then looked at Candice, to whom he said, “As expected, you didn’t leave much for me.”

“...You didn’t say you wanted any.”

“I thought you wouldn’t be able to finish such a huge portion.”

Was he blaming her now?

“It’s alright.” Edward looked forgiving. “I like raising pigs.”

“You’re the pig.”

“That’s why my children are called George and Paige1.”

Candice was speechless.

“Sleep a little longer.” Edward placed the plate at the side of the bed and crawled into the bed.

Candice was stunned as Edward hugged her body tightly. However, she had to admit that she had eaten too much and was really sleepy again.

No. It was definitely because she was too tired from last night. She would never admit that she was like a pig, who ate, sleep, and repeat.

The two of them hugged each other tightly again, and everything was perfect.

In the room, Candice suddenly said, “Edward”

“Yes.” Edward smiled.

Every time he heard her call him by his name, she could see the bright smile in his eyes.

“I didn’t bleed,” Candice said.

Although it was awkward, she wanted to explain it to him.

When Edward left earlier, she had rummaged through the bedsheets and did not find any blood.

She thought that she had overlooked it because of how intense last night was, but when she looked carefully just now, there was nothing.

Edward hugged her even tighter.

“Do you mind?” Candice asked.

She did not know if the man would care about that. All she could tell him was, “In my memory, you’re the only man I’ve slept with.”

“I know.” Edward muttered, “I know everything about you.”

“Huh?” Candice was surprised.

“I’ve always been the only man you’ve slept with,” Edward told her with certainty.

Was that so? Perhaps he was, but anyway, she could not remember.

In fact, it could be because she had grown up in the army and received a lot of difficult training, which tore her hymen.

“Be good and sleep.” Edward coaxed her.

Candice fell asleep in his arms. Even though she had slept the entire morning, she fell asleep again very quickly.

The moment she fell asleep, she seemed to hear Edward mumble softly in her ear.

Did he say ‘Jeannie’ or was it just an illusion?

…

The news of Edward and Candice’s wedding was still occupying the headlines of all major news sections the next day, and it was still trending.

Monica threw her phone aside. She did not want to read the news about the two of them, but she could not control herself and read it.

She was very unhappy when she saw everyone blessing the newlyweds.

F*ck.

...

She felt that if she continued reading it, she would become enraged.
