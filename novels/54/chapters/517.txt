Chapter 518: Monica Swayed By Her Emotions

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There were staff members in the reception room, but when Monica entered, she told the staff member to leave.

The two of them sat in front of a table and did not order anything. They just looked at each other.

Reese said, “Michael’s father...”

Monica’s eyes turned red as she looked at Reese. Even if she wanted to, she could not hide her emotions.

At the same time, Monica was also feeling a little nervous. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Reese tried to hold it in for a long time before saying, “He passed away.”

Monica felt a sharp pain in her heart. She would still feel a little sad because someone had passed away.

She said, “I’m sorry for your loss.”

“He passed away the night you left.” Reese tried her best to regulate her emotions.

Monica nodded silently.

“That’s why Michael hasn’t had the time to deal with the news about you and him. After he sent you back, his father’s condition worsened. They resuscitated him a few times before it failed that night, and he was declared dead.”

“I don’t blame Michael. I knew he must’ve had something to attend to, and that was why he didn’t deal with the news.”

“We haven’t announced his father’s death yet, and I think you know the uniqueness of our family’s situation. Michael is young, and his father’s sudden death will make it difficult for him to support the family. Once we announce his father’s death, it’ll cause a lot of trouble in our family. That’s why we’ve chosen to hide it. However, nothing can be hidden forever. Someone will find out soon enough,” Reese said, looking upset.

Monica was not sure what Reese meant by saying all of that.

She just looked at Reese, who said, “I don’t know if you’ve seen the news, but Michael decided to join the election yesterday.”

Monica shook her head, signaling she did not watch it.

She had been pretty happy with Finn that she did not have time to check her phone.

Reese continued saying, “Michael is running for the position of Director in the Department of Quality Supervision. His professional score is very high, but his popularity score is surprisingly low. You can go online and take a look at the popularity ranking now. Out of the three candidates, Michael is ranked last.”

“Hasn’t Michael always been popular?” Michael was young and promising. People from all walks of life thought highly of him and said he would surpass his father’s achievements in the future.

“It’s because the news that day damaged his reputation and caused his popularity to drop considerably,” Reese explained.

Monica nodded.

It was only normal for Michael’s popularity to drop following that news.

“But fortunately, Michael is very professionally competent. Coupled with his father’s identity, even if Michael’s reputation is slightly damaged, there is still hope. However, his father has passed away. Once his father’s death is made public, Michael will lose the election. So, on the safe side, I hope you can help Michael to rebuild his image during this one month of the campaign at least.”

“How can I help him?” Monica was against it.

“By divorcing Finn and temporarily dating Michael. We can tell the public that your relationship with Finn has been broken for a long time. Then, we can make your relationship with Michael sound more convincing. We’ll tell them that you and Michael aren’t together because we disapprove and that the truth is you’ve always loved each other. You only married Finn back then because of an impulsive decision, but you and Finn have already divorced for a long time now. Don’t worry. We can change the time on the divorce certificate and in the civil affairs system. This way, Michael won’t be the third party. If the two of you truly love each other, no one will blame you anymore–”

“I’m sorry,” Monica immediately rejected her.

Reese just looked at Monica as Monica said, “I can’t help Michael by putting on such a show for the public. Michael and I have broken up, and that’s final. I can clarify to the public that Michael and I are just friends and that what the paparazzi took that day was just an accident. However, I refuse to divorce Finn temporarily to get back together with Michael. I can’t do that.”

Reese’s expression darkened.

Monica said, “I understand that you, as a parent, want your son to be happy. I also know that this method might be the best for Michael’s career. However, I have my principles to follow too. There’s no way Michael and I will get back together, so I won’t put up an act with him! After all, doing so will only result in everyone tying Michael and me back together, and once we break up, everyone will still hold onto this point, making it difficult for us to break up in the future. Of course, that is only one of the reasons. Another important reason is that this is unfair to Finn.”
