881 They Gave Up on Each Other

She really had to be very lucky to have such parents and such a family. Therefore, she would cherish it.

Monica returned to her room and sent Reese’s recording to Jeanne.

Jeanne gave her a big thumbs up.

Having been approved, she was in a great mood. However, as she was lying on the bed, the scene of Finn walking past her appeared in her mind.

She smiled bitterly and made herself accept it.

…

By the time Finn drove from the Cardellini family’s villa to Bamboo Garden, it was already 10 p.m. at night.

The fact that he suddenly received a call from Nox meant that it must be a big deal.

When he arrived, he saw Edward and Nox waiting for him in the hall.

After more than 20 days of recuperation, Edward’s body had almost recovered.

Finn sat beside them.

Nox said, “Why are you still on the streets so late at night? Are you in a relationship?”

When he called Finn just now, Finn was driving.

Under normal circumstances, Finn was rarely out at night. Therefore, it was inevitable that Nox would tease him.

However, it did not mean that Finn would care about what Nox said.

Nox found Finn rather boring.

“I called you here today mainly to talk about Alex Duncan,” Edward said.

As soon as he spoke, Nox’s expression turned serious.

On the other hand, Finn had always been serious.

“The other party found Alex Duncan’s first residence after returning to South Hampton City. It was the place where I brought him back to recuperate from the ancient region,” Edward said bluntly.

“How did they find it? How did they find such a secluded place?” Nox was on the verge of breaking down.

The location, the surroundings, the road surveillance, and so on were all personally arranged by him. He had also done countless experiments, in which no one paid attention to that small villa, and no one could find it. That place was originally a place for the Duncans to hide.

“Never underestimate your opponent,” Edward said coldly.

Nox was still a little unhappy.

It was the displeasure of knowing others had seen through all his arrangements!

“I’ve seen the surveillance cameras hidden in the villa. They picked up a strand of Alex Duncan’s hair,” Edward said. “To put it bluntly, the other party has Alex Duncan’s DNA!”

“Why would they have his hair?” Nox asked.

“Because Alex Duncan doesn’t stay there anymore, the servants haven’t been tidying his room and neglected it.” Edward was not as calm as he appeared, but he never clung to his past mistakes. He would only think about what to do next. “Since things have come to this, the Sanders will definitely take action after getting Alex Duncan’s DNA.”

“There are so many people in Harken. Is he going to compare them one by one?” Nox said sarcastically.

“It’s not that they can’t do it. If they’ve decided to do something, they can do anything. Previously, when the Sanders weren’t sure about Alex Duncan, weren’t they trying to get him anyway? Now that they know about his existence and have even obtained his DNA, there’s no way they’ll give up.”

“Damn it!” Nox cursed. “Why don’t we lay our cards on the table and fight to the death? I refuse to believe we can’t defeat the Sanders after so many years.”

“It’s because Alex Duncan has no chance of winning that he’s been hidden until now,” Edward said bluntly. “The Sanders controls the entire Harken. They have the most power and many resources to use, such as the armed forces of the entire country, the armed forces of other countries, and an underground assassin organization that has always protected his regime.”

“In that case, let’s go to the Delta Islands and wipe the Hills out first.”

“Didn’t you see what happened to M Underground Organization?” Edward reminded Nox. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“That small fry…”

“But it will cause us serious losses.” Edward said, “Now is not the time to attack head-on. What we have to think about now is how to prevent the Sanders from finding Alex Duncan.”

“Alright.” Since they could not fight head-on, Nox would leave the scheming to Edward and Finn.

He did not want to waste his brain power.

“I think the Sanders might start investigating the people around you first,” Finn said.

“Yes.” Edward nodded.

He could not look for a needle in a haystack. He definitely had to demarcate an area to investigate.

“So, the Sanders might use Michael’s wedding on the 15th of this month,” Finn speculated.

“Indeed. Michael and Monica’s wedding is considered a political and business marriage. It will attract many businessmen and politicians. When everyone gathers, it will reduce a lot of work for the Sanders.” Edward had already thought of that.
