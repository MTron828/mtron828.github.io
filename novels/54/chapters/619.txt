“Alright,” Finn agreed immediately.

Monica was stunned. She could not believe that Finn had agreed to send her back.

At first, she had wanted to resist and stay a little longer. However, when she heard that Finn wanted to send her back, she instantly chose to remain silent.

“Thank you.” Jeanne smiled gratefully at Finn.

Finn nodded before turning around and walking out of the hall. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica was stunned for a few seconds. Then, without turning back, she quickly followed Finn while Jeanne watched their leaving silhouettes.

In fact, she was not trying to set them up.

She even believed it would be difficult to set them up.

She really did want Monica to head back as soon as possible because she did not want Monica to spend so much time with her, and only Finn could make Monica leave without hesitation.

Jeanne looked back, only to meet Eden’s gaze.

It was only for a brief second before Jeanne averted her gaze.

Eden’s expression changed.

Jeanne was looking down on him more and more.

However, he had to say that Jeanne was much more powerful than he thought.

Seven years ago, Jeanne was still living under the ivory tower and did not know anything. Now, it was as if Jeanne had been cracked open; she could do whatever she wanted.

Not only did it frustrate him to the core, but he also could not bear to see Jeanne live a good life after she left him.

With that, he gritted his teeth and walked straight toward Jeanne.

There were fewer people in the hall now. Since there was nothing much to do, Jeanne sat by the side and closed her eyes to rest.

Just then, Eden sat by her side.

Jasmine had been keeping vigil in the hall for the past two days, and every day, she would cry her eyes out so that people thought she was pitiful.

In fact, if one observed carefully, one would see that Jasmine’s eyes were empty. She was like a machine that only knew how to cry, and nothing or no one else around her deserved her attention.

Yet, seeing Eden taking the initiative to walk toward Jeanne, Jasmine’s eyes moved. She looked straight at them but remained silent.

As Jeanne felt Eden approaching, her expression visibly shifted.

After all, she was tired after two busy days and wanted to rest. She did not want to waste time on insignificant people.

“Where did my Fourth Uncle go?” Eden asked. He used a very normal tone to chat with her.

“I don’t know.” However, Jeanne’s tone was cold.

“Such a big thing happened. Why didn’t he come back to accompany you?” It was clear that he was being a little sarcastic.

Jeanne opened her eyes and turned her head to look at Eden, whom she found disgusting.

Thinking about it now, she could not remember what she liked about him back then. At the very beginning, what did it feel like to like him?

She even had the illusion that she had never liked the man.

Otherwise, why would she be so annoyed?

She said, “You can’t drive a wedge between my relationship with Edward.”

“Do you think I still like you?” Eden mocked, “Jeanne, don’t think too highly of yourself. Since I f*cked Jasmine seven years ago, it means I didn’t like you at all seven years ago. Don’t be so self-righteous here. I’m just concerned about my Fourth Uncle. Who do you think you are?”

“If that’s the case, stay away from me,” Jeanne said coldly.

Eden was so angry that his face was flushed red.

However, he did not leave.

“What? You’re not leaving?” Jeanne’s eyes narrowed as if she hated him!

Eden glared at Jeanne and suddenly got up from the chair. Before he left, he said, “Jeanne, you will regret it one day.”

Jeanne sneered.

She should have said that sentence to Eden.

To be able to turn something good into bad was an ability of Eden’s.

It was not that he would lose out a lot from losing her, but to think that he wanted to compare himself to Edward with that mere ability of his? He might not even know how he died in the end!

After Eden left angrily, he walked straight toward Jasmine, who looked at Eden with her body trembling in fear.

“Let’s go,” Eden ordered Jasmine.

“No, I’m not leaving. I want to stay here with my grandfather. I’m not leaving. I’m not leaving...” Jasmine resisted and cried in a low voice.

She was afraid that if she were to speak a little louder, Eden would beat her up again.

During this time, after Jeanne exposed her, she had been living a life worse than death.

Eden did not treat her as a human at all.
