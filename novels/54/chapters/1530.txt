Chapter 1531: Paige, The Divine Helper

After Jeanne returned, Edward’s mental state had obviously changed.

Teddy thought the Fourth Master would be depressed for the rest of his life, but he watched as the Fourth Master and Madam come downstairs in high spirits.

“Teddy,” Jeanne called out to him.

“Madam.”

“Get your master something to eat,” Jeanne instructed.

“Alright, I’ll be right there,” Teddy quickly agreed.

Jeanne sat on the sofa with Edward and turned on the television calmly. The television was on the animation channel, and it was currently playing Peppa Pig.

“Did you send Paige to Finn?” Jeanne asked Edward.

Edward’s gaze was fixed on her.

Although the two of them had buried the hatchet and Jeanne had told him that she had let go of all her hatred, Edward still did not seem to believe her.

Since just now, when she told him to take a shower and shave, he had been afraid that she would suddenly run away, so he kept an eye on her. He did not even blink.

“Yes.” Edward nodded. “I didn’t want Paige to see me depressed.” “If I didn’t come back, how long did you plan on staying like that?”

“I don’t know.”

He really did not know. At least for the past three days, he did not have the courage to face her departure alone.

Jeanne stared at Edward, the man who had been holding himself back since they met. He seemed strong, but in reality, he always gave in to her. Regardless of whether they were together or not, he had done so much for her. Yet, in the end, she still had the final say.

Her heart skipped a beat, and she did not allow herself to feel bad.

She said, “I’ll give Finn a call.”

“Alright.”

With that, Jeanne got up and walked to the side to make a call. There were some things that she wanted to ask Finn in private.

As soon as she left, she felt that gaze on her. It was as if he could not bear to look away for even a second.

“Finn.” When the call connected, Jeanne called out Finn’s name.

The other party seemed stunned for two seconds before he said unsurely, “Jeannie?”

“Yes.”

“You’ve regained your memory.”

“Yes.”

“I’m sorry.” Finn apologized.

He was apologizing for doing plastic surgery on her without her permission.

Jeanne smiled faintly. “It had nothing to do with you.”

“Fourth Master-”

“I’m back.” Jeanne interrupted him.

She knew that Finn would definitely put in a good word for Edward, so she simply told him that she had returned and was back with Edward.

“You two… Have you guys reconciled?”

“Yes.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Just as I guessed.” Finn seemed to be smiling. “At that time, I believed that even if you knew what Fourth Master had done to you many years later, you would still return to his side. It was just Fourth Master, who didn’t dare to take the risk.”

Sometimes, love could make a person let go of a lot of things. It could even make a person want to live for the other.

“Is it possible to have my old face back?” Jeanne suddenly asked.

Finn was silent for a few seconds before he said, “Sure, but…

“Alright, I know.” Jeanne did not make things difficult for Finn.

She knew what Finn was worried about. She could only live a normal life with Candice’s face and identity. In the eyes of the world, Jeanne was long dead.

“By the way, is Paige with you?” Jeanne asked.

“Yes.” Finn said, “Fourth Master sent her over three days ago.”

“Can I trouble you to send her back?”

“I have a presumptuous request.” Finn forced the words out of his mouth.

“Yes.”

“I want to keep Paige with me for two more days.”

Jeanne frowned.

“I need Paige to help me get Monica back. I never thought that one day, Monica would be so difficult to woo.”

“So you always thought that as long as you told Monica to, she would return to your side.”

“I was overconfident back then.” Finn did not deny it either. “I thought Monica would always be by my side, but I never thought that one day, she would be single even though she’s pregnant with my child.”

“Monica just can’t get over the past. She doesn’t think you love her enough, or rather, she’s afraid that she’ll fall in love with you.” Jeanne said, “But if you can make her trust you again, she will return to your side..”
