889 While the Wedding Was Going On

“Who is it?”

“Shelly.” Sarah said, “You might not know her, but she’s Nox’s child bride. That should give you an idea of who she is.”

It turned out to be Shelly.

To be honest, she liked Shelly more than Sarah.

“Where is she?” Monica asked.

“Outside the door. I’ll let her in.”

“In that case, you don’t need to come back in after that.” Monica did not give Sarah any face.

Sarah stuck out her tongue and turned to leave.

After a while, Shelly walked in, and she was also wearing a white dress today.

Were Monica’s eyes playing tricks on her? Her impression of Shelly was that she was a little chubby, but now, her figure seemed just right.

However, her face was still too ordinary. She probably would not be able to catch Nox, that playboy’s eyes.

Facing Monica, Shelly was still a little shy.

She said, “Congratulations, Monica.”

Monica smiled. “Thank you.”

“I’m just–” Shelly was a little hesitant.

“You’re feeling guilty about that matter?” Monica immediately thought of Shelly’s purpose for coming.

Back then, she was the one who tipped Monica off to meet Finn. She might have thought that she was trying to match them together, not expecting that they would not get back together in the end. Instead, she married Michael. She might have felt that she had done something wrong out of kindness and felt a little apologetic.

Shelly nodded.

“I’m very grateful to you.” Monica said, “Although it did not go and end well, I never regretted it.”

“I thought I was wrong.”

“No, you’re not.” Monica really had no regrets.

At that time, she felt very fortunate, even though she later felt that it was stupid.

Upon hearing Monica’s words, Shelly was slightly relieved.

During this time, she had been reading the news about Michael and Monica. The two of them had such a good relationship that she even wondered if she had made a mistake back then.

“Oh, right. How are things between you and Nox?” Monica did not want to dwell on the previous matter, so she changed the topic.

Shelly shook her head. “Not good.”

“Don’t have high hopes for Nox. He’s not worth it.”

Shelly bit her lip and did not answer.

“It’s true.” Monica said, “Nox won’t accept you, and you’ll be the one who gets hurt.”

“I won’t,” Shelly replied. For some reason, she somehow trusted Monica. “As long as I don’t like him, I won’t get hurt.”

“You don’t like Nox?” Monica was a little surprised.

No matter what, Nox was still a suave and charming man, so it should be easy for women to like him, especially for a young girl like Shelly.

“I don’t like him.” Shelly did not seem to be lying. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, Monica still did not believe her.

“I’m just… after his family’s money,” Shelly said.

The moment she said that, Monica laughed.

That was the highlight of her day.

If that egoistic Nox knew that Shelly was only in love with his family’s money, would he faint from anger?

“I don’t think I should have said that,” Shelly muttered to herself as she looked at Monica’s bright smile.

“Don’t worry. I’ll keep your secret.”

“Thank you,” Shelly said.

“I wish you success,” Monica said.

“I will work hard for it.”

Monica was liking Shelly more and more.

Having seen so many hypocritical people in upper-class society, Shelly felt genuine.

Both were 18 years old, yet how was Shelly so much better than Sarah?

“It’s time for the bride to head out and get ready.” Outside the door, the staff member suddenly said.

“Well, I won’t disturb you anymore. I’ll go outside to watch the ceremony.” Then, Shelly added, “You look stunning today.”

“Thank you.” Monica smiled.

After that, she followed the staff out of the dressing room and went to the wedding venue.

She was first brought to a palace-like barrier, and Gary was with her inside. He was also dressed in a suit today and looked quite handsome.

“Tell me, how many times do I have to do this before I can really get you married?” Gary asked.

She did not want to do it either.

At that moment, as the wedding march started playing, Michael appeared on the main stage. He looked closely at Monica, waiting for her to walk towards him.

The gauze curtain in front of Monica was opened.

Accompanied by the wedding march, Monica held Gary’s arm and walked on the red carpet.

In the sky, some flower petals drifted and fell on the lawn. As they landed around Monica, the scene looked as beautiful as a painting.

“You don’t say. Monica is quite pretty when she’s dressed up.” Nox, who was sitting in the audience, suddenly lamented.

He did not sit with the Winters. Beside him was Edward, and beside Edward was little George.

They were all dressed very formally to attend Monica’s wedding.

Just then, a waiter came over to serve them champagne.

“Yes, I do.” Nox raised his head and seemed to be talking to the waiter.

The waiter was expressionless as he lowered his voice and said, “There are a lot of people mixed in, and they are all from the Hills.”

What the waiter meant was that many of the waiters were from the Hills.

Nox turned to look at Edward, whose expression remained unchanged.

Nox took a glass of champagne from the waiter’s tray. There was nothing strange about their interaction from the beginning to the end.

By then, Monica was already in front of Michael.

As Gary handed Monica’s hand to Michael, Michael bowed and brought Monica to his side.

Once Gary left, Monica and Michael faced the priest, who looked at them kindly and began the wedding ceremony.

All the procedures were done accordingly.

“I hereby announce you husband and wife. The groom may now kiss your beautiful bride,” the priest announced.

Everyone at the scene seemed to be waiting for that exciting moment.

However, Michael just looked at Monica, and Monica looked at Michael the same way.

Slowly, Michael bent down and approached Monica to plant a kiss on her lips.

At that moment, flower petals filled the sky. From just a few scattered petals just, the entire sky seemed to be covered with flower petals now. It looked beautiful and spectacular.

A round of enthusiastic applause rang out, and the wedding ceremony was at its climax.

Seeing the scene, Nox could not help but glance to the side. He looked at the disguised waiter, who was looking at the newlyweds indifferently.

Nox smiled.

He remembered that when he attended Finn and Monica’s wedding back then, the wedding was the worst wedding he had ever seen. Other than the ceremony, nothing romantic or exciting about it. It was as if they were getting married for the sake of getting married, and Finn only gave Monica a kiss on the cheek.

Nox thought about it carefully.

No woman would choose a blockhead like Finn, so seeing today’s wedding, he suddenly understood Monica’s choice!
