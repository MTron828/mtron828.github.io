Chapter 201: Fiercely Defend to Turn the Tables

In the court, Adrian appeared to be a little agitated.

He continued to speak loudly, “When I saw that contract, I couldn’t believe my eyes. I never thought that Jeanne would do such a thing. After all, it’s the Lawrence Enterprise, her family’s assets. She was secretly profiting and harming their assets. I felt a chill down my spine for Chairman Lawrence. I heard that he treats Jeanne very well. When Jeanne was slandered by all the higher-ups and they didn’t trust her, it was Chairman Lawrence who appeared in the meeting room in a wheelchair to save her. Wouldn’t she feel guilty for doing this?! Doesn’t she feel sorry for her grandfather who trusted her so much?!”

Adrian’s tone was heartbreaking.

It was as if he had been treated like this by his own daughter. At the same time, he also described Jeanne’s dark cruelty to the fullest.

“Please control your emotions. The court is a serious place,” Josiah reminded.

Adrian took a deep breath as if he was trying to calm himself down.

After a long while, he spoke again, “After seeing the contract, I completely Tenda that Jeanne is the mastermind behind the matter. I hesitated for a long time. I also thought about letting this matter go. After all, the difference between the qualities of the construction materials isn’t too big, and it wouldn’t affect the overall construction of the logistics warehouse. However, in the end, I still couldn’t let it go and decided to report Jeanne for the sake of justice.”

What he said sounded very righteous.

Monica almost jumped up and cursed when she heard that.

Meanwhile, Eden, who was sitting at the side, had a sinister smile on his face.

He was not the only one.

Joshua, who was sitting next to Jasmine, had a more obvious expression on his face.

A woman not far away from them, Melody, who had been silent since the court session and had not been discovered by anyone, also had a vicious smile on her face.

She was wearing sunglasses and sitting in a corner.

Micheal was sitting beside Melody. The two of them deliberately sat one seat apart from each other in order to not attract too much attention.

“How did you get the dual contract? You even found out that there was a sum of 30 million dollars in Jeanne’s account?” Josiah asked.

“After I decided to report it, I made a lot of preparations. First, I went to look for Tenda again. When I looked for him, I deliberately asked him to admit his dual contract with Jeanne again and recorded it.”

“Do you have the recording proof?” Josiah asked.

“Yes.”

“Your Honor, please allow me to play the recording in court.”

“Permission granted.”

Josiah asked the staff at the scene to play the recording. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the recording, it could be clearly heard that Tenda admitted to his contract with Jeanne and kept telling Adrian to calm down and not meddle in other people’s business.

The recording ended.

Adrian said, “With this recording, I have evidence to threaten Tenda. Tenda saw that my attitude was firm, and he was afraid that he would be implicated too deeply. In the end, he gave me the dual contract. At the same time, he also gave me the transaction record of transferring 30 million dollars to Jeanne. After getting all the evidence, I made an anonymous report. The reason is that I was afraid that I’d be fired because of this. I’ve been working diligently at the Lawrence Enterprise for many years and have long regarded the enterprise as my last career. I have deep feelings for the enterprise and didn’t want to lose my job just like that. That said, later on, I felt that since I exposed the matter for the sake of justice and am not targeting anyone, I believed that the Lawrence Enterprise wouldn’t target me!”

Adrian spoke again, using righteous words to portray himself as quite noble.

“Alright, we’ve fully understood the origin of your evidence.” Josiah appeared to be more business-like. He turned his head toward Tenda in the dock and asked, “May I ask if the witness’ testimony regarding you is true?”

Tenda nodded. “It’s true.”

“Alright.” Josiah nodded and turned to face the judge respectfully. “Your Honor, that’s the end of the prosecution’s legal statement.”

“Please return to your seat, attorney for the prosecution.”

“Understood.”

The judge said to the plaintiff, “Will the attorney for the defendant please defend the prosecution’s legal statement?”

“Thank you, Your Honor.” Judah stood up from his seat.

In fact, Judah was not particularly famous in South Hampton City. He was a few grades lower than Josiah, who had always helped the public prosecution.
