Chapter 1532: Paige, The Divine Helper

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s why I need Paige to help me,” Finn said with certainty. Jeanne thought for a moment before she said, “Alright.”

“I’ll take good care of Paige,” Finn promised.

That was not what Jeanne was worried about. She just missed Paige a little and wanted her daughter, whom she had not seen since birth, to return to her side.

After all, she still felt a little guilty about the fact that she was prepared to die when she gave birth to Paige. Therefore, her feelings for Paige also fizzled silently…

She took a deep breath and felt that it was good to be alive. Only by being alive could she make up for the many regrets in her life.

After Jeanne and Finn ended the call, she turned around. As expected, she saw Edward’s gaze on her. It was as if nothing could attract his attention anymore.

She walked over. “Finn said he needs Paige to help him woo Monica, so Paige will stay with him for a few more days.”

Edward nodded. It was as if he would nod no matter what she said.

Jeanne rolled her eyes and watched as Teddy walked over.

“Can we eat now?”

“Yes, Madam,” Teddy said respectfully.

Jeanne went to drag Edward over. However, the moment her hand touched his, his hand seemed to tremble. It made Jeanne frown. Just how insecure was the guy now? How could her action scare him?

She pursed her lips and suddenly approached Edward. Then, she kissed him passionately. What she needed was to show him that she was committed to the relationship so that he would not worry all the time. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Edward was stunned again. Due to Jeanne’s initiative, he sat frozen on the sofa.

Teddy, on the other hand, blushed. It seemed to him that madam who had returned this time was much bolder toward Fourth Master.

In the past, the Madam had always treated Fourth Master with respect because of their difference in status. However, after coming back this time, the Madam had changed. In fact, she had become even more confident.

Teddy quickly turned around and turned his back to them. Then, he waited awkwardly at the side.

After a long while, Jeanne pulled away from Edward’s lips. The moment their lips parted, they looked at each other. Jeanne’s face and Edward’s face were both flushed red. They were both a little… shy.

At first, Jeanne had only wanted to kiss him. However, she did not expect the kiss to deepen and turn passionate. If not for that little bit of rationality left in them, perhaps…

Jeanne glanced at Teddy, who was equally embarrassed.

She said, “It’s time to eat.’

She was talking to Edward, to ease the overly erotic atmosphere between the two of them.

Edward nodded, seemingly suppressing his lust. This time, he took the initiative to hold Jeanne’s hand and became more confident.

Did that mean the best way to make a man believe that she loved him was to…

give her body to him?

The two of them sat at the dining table and saw the sumptuous meal Teddy had prepared. It was 4 p.m. in the afternoon, which made it neither lunch nor dinner, but they were eating because Edward had not eaten much.

“Eat more,” Jeanne said to Edward.

He ate slowly, and after taking a bite, he would look at her a few times. It made Jeanne really uncomfortable.

She could not help but say, “I won’t leave. Just eat.”

“You taste better than food,” Edward blurted out.

Jeanne blushed. The Fourth Master Swan in her memories was indeed flirtatious.

“Edward!” Jeanne was a little angry.

“Ed.” Edward said, “Call me Ed.”

Jeanne felt as if her heart had been struck by something.

She suddenly recalled the time when she married Edward. On the night of their wedding night, Edward said that his name was Ed and that she would call him Ed from then on.

However, she did not call him by his name. The first time she called him that was when she gave birth to Paige and thought she was really going to die.

After that, she became Candice. During that period of time, she had lost her memories, so when Edward told her to call him that, she did.

Now that she thought about it, she was a little angry. How could Edward be so cruel to make her forget everything, including everything that had happened between them?

“No!” Jeanne refused.

She was very determined to not call him Ed..
