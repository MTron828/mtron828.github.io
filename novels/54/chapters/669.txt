“Next, please raise your hands to vote.” Joshua did not waste any time. “Those who choose Jeanne to be the executive general manager of Lawrence Enterprise, please raise your hands.”

Jeanne naturally raised her hands.

However, other than Jeanne, the other shareholders at the scene looked at each other and did not move.

The corner of Joshua’s mouth curled into a smile.

He knew Jeanne only had a small achievement, so how could she compare to Eden Swan?

The name Swan was like an all-access pass in Harken’s business world. Anyone would give way to a Swan.

He asked, “Other than Jeanne herself, does no one else support her?”

His tone sounded sarcastic.

Jeanne’s eyes were cold as she looked at Joshua, and her lips were pursed tightly.

“Alright, Next, I agree with Eden–”

“Wait.” One of the shareholders suddenly said, “I support Jeanne to take on the role of Lawrence Enterprise’s executive general manager. I believe in her and that she can lead the company to greater heights.”

“Me, too.” Another shareholder echoed, “During this time, Jeanne’s performance in the company has been evident to all of us. If such an outstanding person can’t take on the role of developing Lawrences Enterprise, no one else can.”

“Agreed.” One after another shareholders echoed, “Jeanne has contributed more to Lawrence Enterprise than your father, Alexander. I have come to the company a few times and seen Jeanne working overtime. Based on her attitude toward work, I vote for Jeanne.”

“Putting aside her previous achievements, Jeanne has shown great talent by being able to make some big changes in the senior management without conflict and promote our employee welfare to the others. Based on that move alone, I think the company will develop well under her guidance. I have no reason not to choose Jeanne.”

One after another, the shareholders at the scene started supporting Jeanne, who was a little surprised.

She dealt more with Lawrence Enterprise and its senior management but hardly with the shareholders, so she did not expect them to be so sure of her.

She even thought those people were unaware of what she had done in the company. After all, the company had a large number of shareholders, and they were there purely to take their share of the dividends.

Deep down, she was touched.

To be recognized by others, anyone would feel proud and excited.

Joshua looked at the shareholders in front of him. Seeing the shareholders’ unanimous high regard for Jeanne, his expression was extremely ugly.

In the end, other than him, all the other shareholders, including Jeanne herself, voted for Jeanne.

Therefore, even if he had 43 percent of the shares, he did not have any advantage in Lawrence Enterprise.

As long as the shareholders were on Jeanne’s side, he would not have any right to speak.

Seeing that outcome, Joshua kept quiet for a long time.

After all, he had proposed that Eden join the company, yet the shareholders opposed his proposal. It was utterly humiliating for him!

What was more, it was technically his first day as Lawrence Enterprise’s chairman, and those people did not even show him some respect.

Jeanne saw the change in Joshua’s expression and smiled triumphantly. “Mr. Gray, what’s the result of the voting?”

It was obvious that Jeanne was deliberately trying to provoke Joshua.

Greyson quickly said, “Jeanne has gotten the position of Lawrence Enterprise’s executive general manager with 57 percent of the shares.”

Jeanne’s smile widened.

She ignored Joshua and said to all the shareholders, “I’m very grateful to all the shareholders for their trust in me. I really didn’t expect you to vote for me. I don’t know how to express my current feelings, but I promise I won’t let you down, and I will take on the important responsibility of developing Lawrence Enterprise. I will bring the company to greater heights and definitely won’t disappoint the shareholders!”

Right after, the entire room erupted into loud applause.

It should be a meeting to welcome Joshua as the chairman and Eden as the executive general manager.

Yet, in the end, it became Jeanne’s home ground, and she stole all the limelight.

Joshua gritted his teeth while Eden, who was on the other end of the call, did not look happy.

He had never thought that with his name, Eden Swan, he would not be able to enter a mere Lawrence Enterprise. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

He was doing the Lawrence Enterprise a favor by joining the Lawrence Enterprise, but those people rejected him!
