978 Autopsy Result: It Was A Set-up

“Do you mean that the company is also related to Michael?” Chi Mumu was still smart.

Once she thought about it, she could think of many things.

Jeanne nodded. “In my opinion, if Michael wants to destroy the Cardellinis, he must do two things. Firstly, let Cardellini Enterprise fall by doing what he did with the vaccine incident and get the public to boycott Cardellini Enterprise. Secondly, let another company kill the business of your company.

“No matter what, Michael works for the Sanders, who manages the entire Harken and needs to do things from the standpoint of a country! In order to maintain the balance, they would immediately replace one company that they suppressed with another. This way, they would be able to control the entire pharmaceutical industry. At the end of the day, that’s the Sanders’ goal.

“They will secretly control many industries and the economy without affecting the general economy of the country, enjoying absolute control over the Harken!”

“Isn’t Harken a democratic and law-abiding country?” Monica said sarcastically.

“Yes, to the public,” Jeanne also replied sarcastically.

Monica gritted her teeth. “In that case, we’re now fighting against the country.”

“Don’t worry. The country will only play dirty in the dark. They won’t dare to do it openly because it will cause public anger. As long as they fail this time, they won’t dare to act rashly. They, too, are afraid that we will catch them red-handed. Once we catch them red-handed, there will be other forces that are ready to take down the Sanders.”

“You mean…” Monica could not believe it. “Is there going to be a change in government?”

“That’s not something you should be concerned about.” Jeanne felt that there was no need to explain too much to Monica.

After all, it had little to do with Monica.

All she needed was to take care of Cardellini Enterprise, and other things were other people’s business.

“I suddenly feel very nervous.” Monica’s breathing seemed a little heavy.

It was because there were too many implications. What she thought was just a personal grudge now involved the interest of the entire country!

She was just a mere citizen and had never thought that she would have any relationship with the government.

“Why are you so nervous?” Jeanne could not help but laugh. “How are you in the mood to worry about other things? You have a mess at home waiting for you to clean up. Why are you caring about other people’s affairs?! What’s important is that your dad’s surgery is the day after tomorrow. Shouldn’t you worry about that instead?”

Were they still friends?

“That’s all I have to tell you today. Now, I’m going to leave with Mason to find that staff member and see if we can find out more inside information. You’ll have to rely on yourself for the rest. My energy is limited.”

“Don’t worry. I can handle it,” Monica said confidently.

Without wasting any more time, Jeanne left with Mason.

As Monica watched Jeanne leave, the confident smile on his face faded away.

She just did not want Jeanne to worry too much about her. In reality, she had no confidence.

At the thought that she had to face so many people and do so many things that might involve Harken… she felt that she was not capable enough.

However, she had to bite the bullet and continue because she had no choice.

Monica analyzed the information on Sunny Pharmaceutical again.

Ever since that pharmaceutical company became well-known, it seemed to have been replicating Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s sales model.

Their products were affordable, had a good reputation, and helped the public. Sunny Pharmaceutical had all of the standards that Cardellini Enterprise had set.

From the looks of it, she refused to believe that the emergence of that pharmaceutical company was an accident.

Jeanne had really hit the nail on the head and saw through it all.

That pharmaceutical company was controlled by Michael to eliminate the existence of the Cardellinis.

However, although the marketing style could be used as a reference or completely plagiarized, could the real core of it all, such as the manufacturing of drugs, be copied?

Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s research and development team was personally led by her father. They were all highly-confidential talents using highly-confidential technologies. Could a team like Sunny Pharmaceutical replicate that part?

That was a precious skill that the Cardellinis had spent hundreds of years developing. Could Sunny Pharmaceutical really achieve that in just a year and a half?

No matter what, she found it unbelievable.

Monica had a headache thinking about it, but she just could not figure out what the key point was.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
