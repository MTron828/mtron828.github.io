1019 Millie’s Tragic End

She felt that Mr. Thorn had been unprecedentedly ruthless the last two days. Whoever bumped into him would die.

Soon after Kingsley returned to his room, Lucy showed up there. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

They had returned last night. However, Kingsley did not say anything after they returned and allowed her to go back to her room, which was why she could rest for a night.

After a night of rest, she was in a better state.

She had just heard that Jeanne had returned and was about to go to Jeanne’s room when she suddenly received a message telling her to meet Kingsley.

She could not guess what Kingsley was thinking.

Hence, she could only show herself respectfully in front of him and wait for his instructions.

“Don’t you have anything to say to me?” Kingsley faced her with an intimidating presence.

Lucy was a little stunned. After all, she was still waiting for Kingsley’s orders. Now that he was suddenly asking her that instead, she was too stunned to speak for a long time.

She looked at him and noticed that he was in a bad mood and had probably quarreled with Jeanne.

Usually, when he quarreled with Jeanne, he would sulk and vent her anger on others.

With that, she said respectfully, “I need to report to you about Millie.”

“Speak!” Kingsley responded.

Fortunately, she had guessed his thoughts.

She was really afraid that at that moment, Kingsley would kick her because he was unhappy.

She was not overthinking it. In fact, she had been kicked by Kingsley more than once or twice.

Kingsley’s kick really hurt. It was an unbearable pain, the kind that stopped her from crying out.

She said, “I’m afraid you’ll think that I’m accusing Millie, so I want to confront Millie face to face.”

“Call Millie in!” Kingsley immediately ordered the assassin next to him.

The assassin quickly agreed and ran very fast. He also realized that Kingsley was in a bad mood, so he did not dare to offend him.

After a while, Millie walked into Kingsley’s room.

Millie already knew that Lucy had returned safely yesterday and that Kingsley had personally gone to get Lucy.

When Millie found out, she almost died of anger and wished she could kill Lucy with her own hands.

She did not know how she had made such a mistake with such thorough planning.

However, her mindset was that since the Hills were in favor of her now, she would always have a way to kill Lucy.

If she failed this time, there would be a next time, and she would not let Lucy escape next time!

However, at that moment, she was still a little surprised to be called to Kingsley’s room!

Especially when she saw that Lucy was there, she was even more certain that something bad was going to happen.

Moreover, she suddenly thought of something — Kingsley had not slept with her for a long time.

For a second there, she thought that Kingsley had suddenly remembered her.

She gritted her teeth.

Tonight, she was definitely going to climb into Kingsley’s bed.

Amidst her thoughts, Lucy said, “Millie, do you know the rules of Hills?”

“There are many rules in the Hills. Which one are you talking about?” Millie asked Lucy with obvious disdain.

Without showing any emotions, Lucy said, “It’s a taboo in the Hills for assassins to kill each other.”

“Of course, I know that.”

“In that case, why did you still hire assassins to kill me?! Lucy enunciated every word.

When she said that, her energy presence was released.

Millie’s heart skipped a beat.

She was stunned by Lucy’s sudden imposing manner, but she also had a guilty conscience.

She quickly explained, “What are you talking about? When did I bribe an assassin to kill you? Lucy, don’t tell me that you’re harboring a grudge and slandering me because I sent you on a mission this time.”

Lucy was about to speak when Millie interrupted her. “I sent you to carry out the mission because something came up with the assassin who was supposed to go on a mission. I was afraid that it would affect the completion of the mission, so I sent you. When I told you to go, I asked for your opinion and your consent before making the arrangement. Yet now, you’re suddenly reporting and slandering me? Lucy, you are considered a senior assassin of the Hills and have followed Mr. Thorn for so many years. Don’t you even have any magnanimity?”

Lucy looked at Millie coldly.

Millie continued with an innocent look on her face. “Actually, if you had told me that you didn’t want to go, I definitely wouldn’t have sent you. But now that you’ve gone and accused me, I really can’t accept it. Now, in front of Mr. Thorn, why don’t you tell me if I shouldn’t put you on any missions in the future? If Mr. Thorn agrees, I won’t ask you to go even if I have to go by myself.”
