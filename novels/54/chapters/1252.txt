1253 Standing Up For Shelly

When Shelly returned to Nox’s apartment, it was already in the afternoon.

The moment she returned, she saw Nox’s cold face glaring at her. However, since she was used to it, she pretended not to know anything.

“What are you looking for me for?” she asked him calmly.

“Why am I looking for you?” Nox’s cold voice was filled with sarcasm. “I’ve been looking for you for a few hours, and you’re asking me that question now?!”

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to my room.”

“Shelly!” Nox was furious.

If he could stand up now, he would definitely strangle Shelly to death. Nobody knew how angry he was waiting for Shelly at home.

He could not believe Shelly stood him up! No woman had ever dared to stand him up in his life.

Shelly just stared at his angry face.

In fact, most of the time, Nox had no reason for looking for her. He just wanted to vent his depressed emotions. It was probably because he, a person who could not stay at home all day at all, had been staying at home recently and had developed cognitive distortions.

She was really used to Nox’s temper. Sometimes, she was so calm about it that she pretended not to hear anything, and the same was happening now.

She just stood there in front of Nox. In any case, he would be fine after he lost his temper.

In fact, she did not know how much longer she could last with Nox. All she knew was that her parents had been called to school today, and it was Nox’s mother who went.

Due to the fact that it was Nox’s family, the teacher was very polite to his mother and was quite attentive. She also did not say too many bad things about Shelly to Nox’s mother. Instead, she kept praising her, saying that her grades were not bad and that she was very hardworking.

On the other hand, the parents of the boy who had fought with her were really badly criticized.

In fact, the boy was one of the top students in their class and was usually praised by many teachers. Now, because he had fought with her, it was all the boy’s fault no matter what!

That was the difference in status caused by money. As the Winters were rich, they would be superior to others!

Shelly had truly seen through the coldness of human nature and the reality of society.

“Shelly!” Nox roared again.

He was really upset because he did not get a response from Shelly. On top of that, Shelly could even get distracted when she was standing in front of him!

What the hell was she thinking?

Shelly took a deep breath and asked, “What do you want?”

Nox was startled.

He did not know what he wanted! He had called her back in the morning to torture her. He knew that she was in class, so he deliberately did things that would piss her off.

In fact, he did not know what to do with Shelly. He was just used to venting his dissatisfaction on her.

“Don’t you love me very much?” Nox suddenly said with a matter-of-fact expression, “Shouldn’t you be guessing what I want?!”

Shelly was speechless.

She knew too well that Nox did not want anything. Instead, he just wanted to make things difficult for her.

With that, she walked in front of Nox and pushed Nox’s wheelchair into his room.

Nox was puzzled. ‘What’s that woman up to now?’

To be honest, because he was living with Shelly now, and because he was bored, he kept finding fault with her. As he interacted more with Shelly, he realized he could no longer guess what that woman was thinking.

He found the woman different from other women.

Her kindness to him seemed to be built on his request, and at other times, she would not take the initiative to get close to him!

It made Nox think that Shelly would never be able to seduce him like that.

Shelly pushed Nox back to his room and then helped him to the bed.

“What are you doing?” Nox frowned at Shelly’s actions.

“Didn’t you tell me to guess what you want?” Shelly replied.

As she answered, she also climbed onto Nox’s bed.

Nox was obviously getting a little excited, and his Adam’s apple bobbed. For some reason, Shelly’s actions were a little…

He felt a trace of anticipation.

As expected, he had not had a woman for a few months and could get horny even at the sight of Shelly.

At that moment, he even silently allowed Shelly… to take the initiative. He just lay on the bed and let Shelly change him to a more comfortable position.

After lying down, Shelly went to take off Nox’s pants.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
