1042 If She Fails, She’ll Get Back Up Again

Monica really wanted to take Michael down with her.

She had never hated someone so much that she wanted to cut him into pieces.

“Why? Are you threatened by me just because of that?” Michael asked her coldly.

Monica held her phone tightly. She was fuming with anger, but her insane tolerance made her tremble involuntarily.

“If I were you, I wouldn’t care about Finn’s life. After all, has Finn ever cared about your family ever since your family has been in trouble? ” Michael was mocking her.

He was mocking her for caring for Finn when he did not care for her.

It was true. She had indeed been threatened by Michael because he used Finn to threaten her.

She could have no feelings for Finn anymore.

Whether it was his nonchalance towards her or how cold and heartless he was toward her, she had been able to face him with the most peaceful attitude.

After all, from the moment she ruined their relationship, she no longer had any right to speak to Finn.

She believed that whatever Finn did to her was natural.

However, she did not dare to provoke Finn anymore or involve him in the feud between her and Michael.

She did not want to affect Finn again because of her past mistake. All she wanted now was to stay as far away from Finn as possible!

She did not want Finn to pay for her mistake.

She was not worthy of him to do that for her.

“Of course.” Michael did not get an answer from Monica, so he spoke again. His voice was still cold-blooded and cruel as he said, “Even if you don’t care about Finn’s life, you can’t beat me. If I can think of one way to deal with you, I can think of a hundred ways to deal with you. Monica, you really shouldn’t fight against me. ”

Monica really did not want to hear Michael say another word.

She had said before that she would not give up until the last moment. Even if there was no hope, she would not give up.

With that, she hung up the phone.

In the future, she would never answer any of Michael’s calls again.

She just had to focus on her own thing.

If she failed, she would get back up again; if she did not do it well, she would try again.

She would do that over and over again until she was really exhausted and could not stand up anymore!

The next day, Monica went to the hospital to discuss product distribution with the director.

The director still tactfully rejected her and even expressed what Michael had told her. To put it bluntly, if she really wanted to blow things up, Finn would bear all the consequences of the medical malpractice.

The consequences of that would be, for one, no one would be so dedicated to treating her father. Secondly, Finn would be hurt again because of her and might even face the danger of going to jail.

She gave in and walked out of the director’s office.

Steve was waiting for her outside, thinking that she had succeeded.

After all, judging from yesterday’s results, it was clear that the hospital was being threatened.

However, he did not expect Monica to come out with an empty contract and a failed negotiation.

Steve originally wanted to ask a few questions, but after seeing Monica’s expression, he chose to shut up.

No matter the outcome, Monica was already doing her best.

It was impossible for her to grow faster. Any faster and things would only backfire on her.

In fact, he had always been worried that everything Monica did was actually just a disguise — that she was forcing herself to conceal herself with a hard shell when, deep down, she was still that fragile and easily hurt little girl who needed protection.

Monica did not show any sadness.

After coming out of the hospital director’s office, she said to Steve calmly, “Let’s meet the next business partner.”

“Alright.” Steve nodded. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Anyway, it was good that she did not give up, and Monica gave him the feeling that she would never give up.

…

On the Delta Islands, Jeanne had had enough of living without her phone.

Not only did she not have a cell phone, but even the TV channels were locked. Hence, she could not see any news about Harken.

She felt that if that went on any longer, she might really go crazy.

“I’ve seen it. At least so far, I haven’t seen any news of the Cardellini Enterprise declaring bankruptcy.” Lucy looked at Jeanne’s expression and said in amusement.

In the end, Jeanne was still the most emotional person in the Hills. To think she could even risk her life for her friend.

As for the assassins, they had long lost their humanity.

With that, Jeanne held it in and did not ask Lucy more about Cardellini Enterprise.
