Chapter 325: The Wedding: Announcing It to the World

He quickly went forward. “Fourth Master Swan is here too.”

He was quite enthusiastic.

Jeanne thought it was a pity that Alexander was not an actor. If he wanted to act as a bad guy in a supporting role, he could definitely win the award for the Best Supporting Role.

At that moment, Jenifer also came over in a hurry and greeted Edward warmly. “Welcome, Fourth Master.”

“Thank you.” Edward also appeared to be very polite. Then, he said, “I came today mainly to discuss with you my marriage with Jeannie.”

Jeannie.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

It was her first time hearing Fourth Master Swan say the word “Jeannie”.

He usually addressed her as “Ms. Lawrence”, which sounded a little distant, but she thought it sounded a little flirty coming from his mouth.

“Oh! Is that so?” Embarrassment washed over Alexander’s face for a few seconds before he joked, “I’ve seen the news. I didn’t know your relationship had developed to this stage. You guys have hidden your relationship very well .”

Jeanne, who was standing at the side, really wanted to laugh.

The Lawrences were indeed two-faced, and they were amazing at it.

“We have never hidden it.” Edward did not give Alexander a way out. What he meant was that he had been dating Jeanne the entire time, but they just did not care about her.

......

Alexander was a little embarrassed, so Jenifer quickly tried to smooth things over. “Come in and sit down. After all, we are a family now.”

Edward nodded and walked to the sofa while holding Jeanne’s hand.

Watching their fingers interlocked, Jenifer suppressed her emotions and continued to greet them with a smile on her face.

On the sofa, Edward went straight to the point. “The wedding is scheduled for the 16th, which is three days later. The timing is a little abrupt, but don’t worry. You can leave everything to me. All you need to do is be there with Jeanne on the wedding day.”

“Oh, okay. We’ll go with your arrangements.” Alexander quickly nodded.

“As for the wedding gifts and dowry... For the dowry, there’s no need for you to prepare it because time is too tight, and I don’t want you to worry about it. Moreover, my father has said that he doesn’t care about these ostentatious arrangements.” Edward said bluntly, “As for the wedding gifts, my father said that we’ll prepare them according to your wishes.”

“As the old man said, we aren’t the kind of people to put much emphasis on ostentation as well. Since we’re saving on the dowry, you don’t have to spend too much on the wedding gifts. In fact, we’re fine as long as you guys are fine with it. There’s no need for all the visiting. I’d rather not go through all the formalities,” said Alexander.

Since the other party had made their point clear, if he were to open his mouth and ask for the wedding gifts, what would people say when word of this spread? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Since you’ve said so, I’ll go with the Swans’ arrangements.”

“Yes. Sure.” Alexander nodded his head.

He knew it was impossible for such a large family like the Swans to not gift them with anything.

Then, he heard Edward say, “I’ve prepared eight percent of the Swans’ original shares. On the day of the wedding, I will transfer all the shares to Jeannie. That will be considered my wedding gift.”

Alexander looked at Edward, speechless and too stunned to react.

At that moment, Jeanne felt like laughing again.

Alexander probably did not expect that Fourth Master Swan would give out the shares of the Swans. What was more, he did not expect that Fourth Master Swan would give it to her directly and not to the Lawrences.

“I believe you and my father share the same thoughts. Since Jeannie and I are getting married, the so-called wedding gift and dowry should fall on us,” Edward said in a dignified manner.

Jeanne could see Alexander’s face distorting in anger.

Only after a long while did Alexander reply, “Yes, that’s right. Old Master Swan is indeed thoughtful.”

“In that case, the dowry and wedding gifts are decided.”

“It’s decided.” Alexander nodded his head.

However, he did not mean what he said.

“I still have some things to attend to tonight, so I will take my leave now.” Edward stood up from the sofa.

Jeanne was puzzled as she thought he would stay at the Lawrences’ for dinner.

“Let’s have dinner before you leave,” Alexander said enthusiastically.

“Once Jeannie and I are married, there will be many opportunities for us to have dinner in the future. There’s no need for that tonight.” Edward refused.

Seeing that Edward had matters to attend to, Alexander did not make things difficult for him and thus agreed.

With that, Edward turned around and left.

Jeanne followed him. “I’ll send you out.”

A smile hung on Edward’s lips again.

Jeanne saw Edward out at the main entrance.

To be honest, she was still a little surprised at Fourth Master Swan’s efficiency in handling matters.

When they were discussing marriage just now, he was so domineering that the other party did not have the power to resist at all!

Even his departure now was easy.
