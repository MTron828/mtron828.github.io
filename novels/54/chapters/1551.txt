Edward immediately kept his hands to himself. However, he was a little hurt. He said, “Don’t you like it?”

“It’s not that I don’t like it, but you can’t be so indulgent. Today, your assistant sent me a message saying that you… have been zoning out a lot at work, so he asked me if you haven’t been sleeping well because you’ve been working especially hard recently. He even asked if he should get the doctor to come over and check on your mental health!” Jeanne became angrier as she spoke.

Edward’s lips curled into a big smile.

“I didn’t even know what to say to your assistant. I couldn’t possibly tell him that you had been overindulged in sex and that was why you’re exhausted!” Jeanne was exasperated. She looked at Edward’s beautiful smile and said, “How are you still smiling? Do you know how embarrassed I was?” “How embarrassed?” Edward whispered into her ear.

“Edward, can you be a little more serious about it?” Jeanne could not take it

anymore.

She was talking about something in all seriousness, yet he was…

“I’m listening.” He was listening, but it did not stop him from doing what he was doing.

Jeanne’s body tensed up as she said, “From now on, I’m going to control the number of times we have sex strictly.”

Someone’s body stiffened.

“Since we have done it this morning, you should get some sleep tonight. Otherwise, I’ll share a room with Paige!” Jeanne threatened. Someone had no choice but to try to calm himself down.

“If you understand, go to bed,” Jeanne said.

Edward bent down and picked Jeanne up in his arms. Startled, Jeanne wrapped her arms around Edward’s neck. Edward said, “There must be a buffer period for setting rules.”

Jeanne looked at him warily. “So, we’ll start tomorrow night.”

“Edward-

“Shh.” Edward placed her on the bed and put his fingers on her lips.

Jeanne frowned.

“Don’t talk.”

‘F*ck. Would I lose my virginity if I didn’t speak?’

“In a while, you’ll be screaming.”

‘Damn it, you b*stard!’

The next day, Monica packed her luggage. It was 7 p.m. at night, and Brandon had come over to help her with it. Then, the two of them got into a taxi to the airport together.

“Are you sure you don’t want to bring a doctor? If you need one, I can help you contact one immediately.” Brandon was still a little worried. Recalling Monica’s situation last time, he was almost scared to death.

“No need.” Monica rejected his offer immediately.

As such, Brandon did not try to persuade her further.

As it was a night flight, there were not many people when the car arrived at the airport. Moreover, they got first-class seats, so the check-in process was done quickly.

Before the security check, Monica seemed to turn around to take a look.

“Are you waiting for someone?” Brandon asked.

“No.” Monica turned around.

After that, she walked in with Brandon.

As the timing was just right, they boarded the plane as soon as they entered the airport. The two of them sat in their designated seats, with a stewardess serving them one-on-one.

“Just get me a blanket. I don’t need anything else for the time being, ” Monica said.

“Alright, Miss. Please wait a moment.” the air stewardess said respectfully.

“Are you sleepy?” Brandon asked.

“A little,” Monica replied.

“Then, you should sleep first. You can eat something when you’re hungry later.”

“Yeah.”

The air stewardess passed a blanket to Monica.

After Monica got pregnant, she seemed to be sleeping more. It used to be really difficult for her to fall asleep on the plane, but now she would fall asleep a while after closing her eyes. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, since she was sleeping soundly, she had no idea that the seat beside her had been switched.

Brandon looked at Finn and Monica. It was not that he was willing to give up his seat. On the contrary, he knew very well that he had lost in his pursuit of Monica from the moment she became pregnant.

He did not mind that Monica was pregnant. He had gone abroad when he was very young, so he was much more open-minded than many people in the country, though it did not mean that he did not care that she was pregnant. It was just that if he could be with Monica, he could accept her child.

The reason he lost was because Monica did not let go of Finn down. If Finn did not pursue Monica again, Monica would not be with Finn anymore. However, Finn took the initiative, and Monica could not refuse.

Brandon looked away. Even if he decided to let go of his feelings for Monica, he still could not bear to watch the both of them being intimate.

At that moment, Finn was hugging Monica in his arms, and Monica was leaning into Finn’s embrace with no resistance at all. In fact, she seemed to be sleeping better..
