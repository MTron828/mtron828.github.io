Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No need, you can’t do it.” Shelly was very sure, and she just did not believe he could do it. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You’ve never made me do it before, so how do you know I can’t?!” Nox was angry.

He really hated that Shelly did not trust him.

“A leopard can’t change its spots!”

“For you, I can f*cking bark like a dog. What else is there I can’t do?” Nox was furious.

Shelly hesitated. For a second, she was still shocked by Nox.

Nox said fiercely, “Do you think I like to be embarrassed? Shelly, why do you think I’ve been humiliating myself in front of you? It’s because I’m in love with you, and I despise myself for it. There are so many women out there, but why must I fall in love with you? What is it about you that made me fall for you? Why do I love you? I don’t know when or why I fell in love with you, but I have fallen in love with you!”

To Nox, falling in love with Shelly was a momentous realization, and he despised himself for it, leaving him crushed!

He really did not want to fall in love with Shelly, but he could not control himself! That was why he put down his pride and prepared himself to be embarrassed when he came to ask Shelly to reconcile with him.

Shelly suddenly fell silent. She believed Nox a little, but it was simply inconceivable that he had fallen in love with her. She thought that even if all the men in the world loved her, Nox would not. She even suspected that Nox lost his mind from being cuckolded.

Now, she did not know how to answer Nox. She definitely did not like him, but if she told him that, she was really afraid that Nox would die of anger. As such, she just watched as Nox have a mental breakdown because of the fact that he liked her.

He took a deep breath and tried hard to adjust his emotions. He said, “Shelly, let’s get back together. I promise you that I’ll change.”

He would change and become whoever she wanted him to be, and he would put his words into action.

However, Shelly still rejected him. “There’s no need. I don’t like you, so even if you do change, I won’t like you. Why waste your time and feelings? We should have nothing to do with each other.”

Shelly’s heartlessness made Nox’s heart ache. It felt as if someone had stabbed his heart with a knife, and it was covered in blood.

He said humbly, “I know I didn’t treat you well in the past and that you have comDlaints about me, but I’m begging vou to give me a chance. Let me make it

up to you. Let me change. Let me love you properly. I will love you with all my heart.”

At that moment, his eyes seemed to have turned red.

Shelly had never dreamed that she would see Nox treat her with such sincerity one day. However, other than feeling good about it, she was not moved at all.

She felt good only because he had bullied her for so many years, and now he had reaped what he sowed, which gave her a great sense of satisfaction. As for not being moved… She did not love him, so she naturally would not feel moved.

She said, “You won’t change-I‘

“How do you know I can’t change it if you don’t let me try?”

“Because kindness is innate.” Shelly enunciated each word. “And you can’t become kind in just a day.. If you could, you wouldn’t be making things difficult for me now!”
