1342 Monica, I Don’t Want to Break Up

What kind of tragedy had befallen Shelly? If it were Sarah, she would have killed herself long ago.

As soon as she turned around, she saw Monica coming out of the shower.

“I’m going to sleep,” Monica said bluntly.

“Are you sleeping in my room?” Sarah went straight to her room.

“Where else am I going to sleep? Isn’t Shelly sleeping with her daughter?”

“Alright, alright, alright. I need to watch over Bella anyway.” Sarah nodded.

Monica did not say anything else.

“By the way, what happened between you and Finn?”

The moment the door closed, Sarah’s irritable voice came from outside the living room. Monica ignored her and lay on Sarah’s bed.

What had happened between them, she said? They were going to break up.

Monica had thought it through very carefully. However, Finn did not call or send a message that night, which made her feel a little disappointed.

Forget it. At that point, what was there to look forward to?

Monica closed her eyes and immediately fell asleep.

Her phone was in silent mode as she was afraid that the phone ringing would wake her up. As she could not sleep as well as she used to, any sound could affect her.

Monica woke up at 3 p.m.

After waking up, she lay in bed for a while before getting up and taking a few glances at her phone. They were all calls and messages from Brandon and none from Finn.

In fact, it was within her expectations. Based on her understanding of Finn, he would never take the initiative to do anything.

She dialed Brandon’s number. “Are you awake?”

“Where are you?” Brandon said anxiously, “You didn’t answer my calls or reply to my texts.”

“After taking care of you all night, can’t I have a good rest?”

“You only just woke up?” Brandon seemed surprised.

“Can’t I?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I thought you were hiding from me because you were sad,” Brandon said bluntly.

Monica was speechless. She had long passed the age where she would break her heart for love. In fact, she could see everything clearly now.

“Did you break up with Finn?” Brandon asked directly.

Although he was drunk last night, he remembered many things clearly.

“Yeah, I’m ready to break up.”

“Don’t you love him anymore?” Brandon continued to ask.

“I don’t,” Monica replied.

It meant she could stop loving him.

“Then…” Brandon said, “Can I pursue you?”

Monica was stunned and did not react for a long time.

“I like you a lot.” Brandon seemed to want to make things less awkward for both of them, so he spoke casually, “If you don’t like Finn anymore, why don’t you and I give this relationship thing a go? I’m actually quite nice.”

“Forget it.” Monica rejected him. “I never treat relationships as child’s play. Don’t you come and make a mess out of things. ”

“I’m telling the truth.” At that moment, Brandon became more serious. “I’ve liked you since I was young. Even though I was overseas for so many years, I always wanted to come back and look for you when I grew up. However, who would’ve thought that when I graduated from high school and tried my best to get into a university in South Hampton City, I heard from an old friend of mine that you fell in love with a man who studied medicine and even openly pursued him. I was so sad that I didn’t dare to come back. ”

Monica did not seem to believe him. She thought that Brandon was talking for comic relief.

“Monica, do you remember what I told you before I left?” Brandon could also sense Monica’s disbelief.

“Who would remember something that happened so long ago?”

“I told you I would come back and marry you when I grew up, and you agreed!” Brandon sounded a little angry. “Yet, after I left, you fell in love with another man!”

That made him really upset.

Monica, on the other hand, was speechless.

At that time, she was only seven or eight years old. Who knew what love was? Who knew what marriage was?

She just casually agreed to it when she saw Brandon crying so hard and did not take it to heart. If Brandon had not mentioned it again, she would not have remembered it.

“Anyway, I don’t care. Now that you’re single again, I’m going to pursue you,” Brandon said firmly.

“Are you crazy!” Monica was speechless. “Do you think it’s real because you liked me when you were young? I’m not interested in playing these love games with you. Go away!”

“Who says I don’t like you now? I’m much older now and I know very well that I like you. I was even jealous that you were with Finn. But now that you’ve finally broken up with Finn, I’m so happy that I finally have a chance.” The person on the other end was ecstatic.
