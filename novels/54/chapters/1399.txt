Chapter 1400: Finn Drinking His Sorrow Away

Nox was the man she loved the most out of all the men she had met over the years. However, she had been playing around for so many years that it was difficult for her to give up being a playgirl and be loyal to Nox.

She would give herself another year, and a year later she would immediately pull herself together to be a good wife to Nox.

With that thought in mind, she looked down at the Whatsapp message on the screen. “6 p.m. I’ll see you at our usual spot.”

That was right. She had lied to Nox.

What company dinner? She just had another date with a man!

…

After being rejected by Zoe, Nox felt upset.

In fact, Zoe would not always agree to eat with him. Sometimes, she would even say no to going to his house. However, he was inexplicably annoyed today.

He thought about it and called Finn. “Let’s have dinner together tonight.”

Finn had yet to answer when Nox suddenly raised his voice. “Don’t reject me!”

Finn frowned. “I never thought of rejecting you.”

He did not have much to do these days. The only thing he had to do was to get Monica back.

“I’ll give you the address.” Nox said, “6 p.m. Don’t be late.”

“Alright,” Finn replied.

He put down his phone and sat on the sofa. For the entire day, his mind had been filled with what Brandon was bragging about on the Facebook post.

After thinking about it for an entire day, he still could not get it out of his mind. He could not help but imagine the scene of Monica and Brandon…

He really wanted to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Therefore, he arrived at the restaurant Nox mentioned at 6 p.m. sharp. Under the guidance of the staff, he sat in the private room and waited for Nox.

He was used to Nox being late. Nox always reminded others to be punctual, but he had never been punctual.

Half an hour later, Nox pushed open the door and walked in.

When he looked at Finn, he did not look apologetic at all. Instead, he said, “I’m a working man, and you’re jobless.”

Finn did not care about Nox being late, so why was Nox giving him a reason?

“By the way, did you really resign from the hospital?” Nox still could not believe it.

Finn was a responsible man. They had known each other for so many years, and he knew Finn all too well.

He even had a feeling that Finn would devote his entire life to the medical industry not because he was a kind person, but because he was a little too cold-blooded.

That was why he could be so numb to doing some seemingly great things that made him feel like living in this world was not meaningless.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

“For Monica, you’ve really changed a lot.” Nox could not help but sigh. “Most importantly, Monica doesn’t appreciate it at all.”

Finn was speechless. He did not come to have dinner with Nox just for Nox to attack him.

He said bluntly, “Do you still want to eat dinner together?”

“Can’t I say something? Bro, I’m just concerned about you.”

“You should worry about yourself. You’re not young anymore, and you’ve been dating Zoe for so long. Don’t you plan to get married? Do you not want your grandfather to have a great-grandson?”

“I don’t know why, but after dating for so long, I really don’t have any thoughts of getting married. I originally wanted to get married, but I really can’t bring myself to do it.” Nox suddenly felt a little melancholic. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Maybe you don’t like Zoe.”

“How is that possible?!” Nox looked at Finn in disbelief.

“You just think that Zoe is the one you want as your wife,” Finn said bluntly.

“Even so, it’s fine. After all, Zoe is the only person who has made me think of getting married after so many years.”

“In that case, why don’t you get married?”

Nox was speechless.

“Zoe isn’t the only one who makes you think you want to get married. Zoe just met you at the right time when your grandfather and your parents stopped forcing you.” Finn hit the nail on the head.

Nox was exasperated. Why did Finn have to expose him like that?

He said, “I don’t deny that I’ve thought of that, but after so long, Zoe and I are still dating. To me, she’s still different.”

“Why don’t you say you’ve reached the age where you want to settle down?”

“Finn.” Nox was a little angry. “Your relationship is a mess. What right do you have to judge my relationship?”
