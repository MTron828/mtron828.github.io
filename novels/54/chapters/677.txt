“I think so too, but I’m worried that Finn will think I’m a little too wild.”

“That is why I’ll suggest you choose the red one. It’s equally sexy, but it’s more generous and decent. Don’t scare Dr. Jones too much the first time,” Michael joked.

Monica was also amused by Michael.

“I’ll listen to you then.” Monica chatted with Michael.

They chatted casually and happily about how to seduce another man.

From the start to the end, Monica could not feel anything strange from Michael. He was even very enthusiastic about giving her advice and lingerie consultation.

“Michael.” Monica suddenly felt a little emotional.

“What’s wrong?”

“Don’t you feel uncomfortable?” Monica could not help but ask him.

After he gave her sincere advice, she still felt a little guilty.

“How do you want me to answer?” Michael seemed a little helpless.

“I don’t know.”

“Truth be told, I do have emotions. After all... I do love you. I’ve always loved you. However, compared to the fact that I love you, I don’t want you to be sad. Let’s put it this way. If my love becomes a burden to you, I will choose to withdraw.” Michael sounded very affectionate. “So, you don’t have to worry about my feelings. I will choose to wish you well. As long as you’re happy, I will support you unconditionally.”

“Okay.” Monica nodded.

She was touched by Michael, whose love for her was too selfless.

She always thought that in this world, other than her father, no other man would treat her so well.

“By the way, how do you plan to seduce Finn?” Michael suddenly asked, sounding a little worried.

“Finn hates me now, and I can’t even see him. However, I can ask my parents to help me.” Monica told him her plan, “Tonight, I’ll get my parents to invite Finn back to the house. Finn is my father’s attending physician. As long as my father says he’s not feeling well, Finn will leave and go to my father’s place. Meanwhile, I’ll wait for him at home.”

“You’re quite smart,” Michael commented. “I always thought you were stupid and easy to deceive. But now, I think you have a little trick up your sleeve.”

“I was forced into a corner.” Monica let out a deep sigh. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

If she could settle things on her own, she would not have to scheme with her parents and make them take the fall for her.

If Finn knew her parents were trying to set them up, he would definitely hate her parents as well.

“No matter what, I wish you good luck tonight.”

“Thank you, Michael.”

“Silly, why are you thanking me? I should be thanking you. If it weren’t for me, would you and Finn end up like this? Then, you wouldn’t have had to think of so many ways to get back together with Finn. But if you succeed tonight, I will feel much less guilty. You can do it!” Michael said sincerely.

Monica nodded. “Thank you.”

With that, she hung up the phone.

Monica was deep in thought.

Jeanne told her to only test Michael, but she wanted to do it for real.

Not allowing herself to overthink, she immediately called her father.

“Yes?” the person on the other end of the phone replied impatiently.

“Dad, I want to get back together with Finn,” Monica said immediately.

Gary frowned. “What are you going on about again?”

“I’m not crazy. I told you before that I’m with Michael to help Michael and that I still like Finn.”

“You like him, yet you abandon him. As your father, I can’t understand your logic, let alone other men!” Gary had never shown any mercy to Monica.

It made Monica very unhappy. “Anyway, I want to get back together with Finn now, and you have to help me.”

“You say the first thing that comes to your mind, and you don’t think before you take action. It’s hard for me to believe you.”

“Dad, I’ve been losing sleep every night. I can’t sleep when I think about how Finn doesn’t want me anymore. It’s true. The doctors said I’m prone to depression, and if this continues, I might jump off a building and commit suicide. Do you want me to die?” Monica said agitatedly.

Gary’s expression was a little unsightly.

“Dad, please help me. I really don’t want things to end with Finn.”

“If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?”

“I was stupid back then, and I regret it now. Dad, please help me,” Monica begged bitterly.

Gary could not resist Monica’s persistent pestering.
