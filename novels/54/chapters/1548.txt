Chapter 1549: Monica Gives In to Finn (They Make Up)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Monica, if I can let go of everything and choose to get back together with Edward, why don’t you try and work hard with Finn to reignite the spark in your relationship?” Jeanne asked Monica.

Monica smiled. “I don’t know.”

“Are you afraid of being hurt again?”

“I really don’t know what kind of feelings I have for Finn right now. All I Imow is that living with him is very tiring.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Actually, you’re just reluctant to,” Jeanne concluded.

“Maybe.” Monica nodded. “But I’ve always felt that I couldn’t change Finn, nor could I make him feel anything. I’ve always had to sacrifice myself to be with him, which was tiring. The relationship that I’ve dreamed of is that we will love each other; we will put each other first and not just make do with what we have.”

“In the past, Finn was unwilling to express himself, so he held himself back, which led to his current personality. He didn’t Imow that kind of personality was harmful to others, but the current Finn has changed a lot, especially for you. It doesn’t make sense for the both of you to become strangers after sacrificing so much for each other. Monica, don’t make yourself regret it.”

Monica bit her lips tightly. She was really determined not to be with Finn and had never thought about regretting it.

“After dying once, I’ve realized that there are many things I want to cherish. It’s true that Edward has done many things that go against my principles. There’s even a lot of hatred between us, but in the end, I’ve decided to let go of everything and be with Edward. The greatest thing about love is that we can accept each other and even become the best version of ourselves for each other.”

Monica did not know how to respond. She had always found that compared to Jeanne’s definition of a relationship, hers was always so petty and unpresentable.

“I’m not forcing you to be with Finn. I’m just telling you that, as someone who has been through it before, don’t miss out on the man who loves you the most. Sometimes, I think that when I climbed into Edward’s bed at 18, if I had trusted him a little more and insisted on waiting for him to see him, I wouldn’t have returned to the Hills and experienced so many tragic things.” Jeanne smiled.

Although it was a relieved smile, it was also mixed with a lot of sadness.

People would always regret many things, but it all depended on how one could figure it out.

“So Monica, give yourself and Finn another chance,” Jeanne consoled.

She came to see Monica today not only to tell her that she was Jeanne but also to matchmake her with Finn. In the past, Finn was not the most suitable person for Monica, but now, she was completely certain that he was.

In the end, Monica did not give Jeanne an accurate answer, but Jeanne did not force her to listen to her advice.

When it came to relationships, outsiders would only see a part of it, and only the people in the relationship knew what was truly going on. Moreover, for Monica, who loved Finn so much, to be able to make up her mind to break up with Finn, only she knew what she had gone through.

After the two of them had dinner, they left together.

Shelly had been waiting at the door. The moment she saw them coming out, she was unusually respectful. “Madam, Ms. Cardellini, please come again.”

Both of them looked at Shelly, and Monica suddenly said, “Shelly, Nox is getting married.”

Shelly smiled. “I saw the news.”

The news said that Nox and Zoe had confirmed a wedding date, but they had yet to announce the exact date to the public.

“Anyway, if you encounter any difficulties in the future, feel free to call me.” Monica took out a business card from her bag. “Keep it.” “Thank you.” Shelly was grateful.

Monica nodded at Shelly and left River Restaurant with Jeanne.

At the entrance of the restaurant, two familiar cars were waiting at the entrance, which made Monica frown. Then, when she saw that the people who got out of the car were Edward and Finn, she turned to look at Jeanne.

“I only told Edward that I’m here.” leanne explained.

Edward stepped forward and pulled Jeanne into her embrace. “I told Finn.”

Of course, Monica could not say anything about that..
