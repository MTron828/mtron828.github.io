1052 I Think You’ll Attack Me In This Chapter

“So, are you telling me you can’t bear it anymore?” Monica glared at Michael.

“Yes, I can’t do it anymore. I don’t want to use all these cruel methods on you!” Michael admitted.

Monica laughed sarcastically. “Michael, do you think you can still lie to me?!”

Michael’s expression was extremely ugly.

“Yes, I might not be able to defeat you in the end, but my actions have made things difficult for you, right? You’re afraid that I’ll do something unexpected that you can’t control, right?”

“You think too highly of yourself!”

“You can’t do much. You just have a little more power and the Sanders backing you up.”

Michael was surprised.

He did not expect Monica to know that the Sanders was helping him.

Otherwise, he would not have been able to get so many pharmaceutical companies and even hospitals to use Sunny Pharmaceutical’s products.

“I even know you told Richie to kindly suggest that I declare bankruptcy. Your hypocritical words just now were to make me end my fight with you just so that you won’t have to waste your 100 million dollars in compensation.” Monica made it very clear. “With me bankrupt and Cardellini Enterprise no longer around, the research and development staff will no longer be bounded by law, and you can hire them again, right?!”

Michael’s expression turned cold.

Monica had really become smarter.

It was true. He could not let the 100 million dollars in compensation go up in smoke just like that, so the only way was for Cardellini Enterprise to go bankrupt.

Therefore, he resorted to using many underhanded tricks. Whether it was bribing some shareholders and important senior executives of Cardellini Enterprise, telling them of Richie’s dinner today, or his sudden ‘kindness’ just now, all of them were to force Monica to declare bankruptcy as soon as possible.

However, now that Monica had seen through him, he could not hide his ugly expression.

“Don’t worry, I won’t declare bankruptcy.” Monica said bluntly, “With Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation, we can at least hold on for two to three months. Who knows if we can turn things around in two to three months?”

Michael clenched his fists.

He was probably really threatened by Monica.

Monica, however, did not care about how he felt. She said, “Before it’s completely over, there’s still a glimmer of hope. Perhaps I’ll be lucky in the next two or three months!”

She was still trying to provoke Michael.

Anyway, if she did not have it good, he would not have an easy time either.

After Monica said that, she planned to leave as she really did not want to see Michael at all. Seeing him would remind her of her foolish past.

However, as soon as she opened the door of the private room, Michael slammed the door shut.

Monica’s expression sank.

She could feel Michael’s body pushing her against the door from behind.

At that moment, she heard him say coldly, “Monica, you’re so smart that I now look at you in a different light. However, you still don’t understand me or men in general!”

Monica gritted her teeth. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Do you know what’s the biggest difference between men and women?” Michael asked her.

However, Monica was trying hard to suppress her anger.

“In our strength.” Michael enunciated each word. “So no matter what I do to you now, you can’t resist.”

Monica subconsciously clenched her fists, and her body was trembling as she tried to hold herself back from reacting.

“We were in a relationship for so many years, but I’ve never touched you, have I?”

“Michael, don’t be so despicable!” Monica said fiercely.

“Why? Do you care about this?” Michael’s hand was already wandering all over Monica’s body.

Monica was so disgusted that she could vomit.

“Haven’t you slept with older men? In comparison, isn’t it better to sleep with me?”

“No, you’re even worse than a beggar!” Monica said firmly, “In my heart, you’re the most disgusting man in the world. I’m willing to sleep with all the men in the world, but not you– Ugh…”

Monica’s mouth was sealed by Michael’s.

He kissed her roughly, but Monica kept resisting madly.

She could sell her body. In fact, she had thought about selling her body to Richie if he were a pervert. However, no matter who she sold her body to, she would not sell herself to Michael.

In this lifetime, only two men were not allowed to touch her — one was Michael and the other was Finn.

Anyone else was fine.

She bit Michael’s mouth with all her strength.
