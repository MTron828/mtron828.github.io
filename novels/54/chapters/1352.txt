1353 The Wedding: Last Night As A Bachelor

He was just an ordinary person. Like many men, he hoped that his wife would be able to make him feel proud when she went out. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He did not know if it was because Shelly had been laughed at by others, but he was unusually stubborn about his other half’s requirements.

Clearly, when he was playing around with women, he had no qualms about the other party’s background at all.

As soon as Finn and Nox sat in the private room, the person in charge of the nightclub personally came to greet them.

In fact, that nightclub was also one of Nox’s businesses. However, because he did not manage it personally, many people who worked at the nightclub did not know about it.

Shelly, too, did not know about it when she was called to that private room at the last minute to deliver the drinks.

She was not supposed to be qualified to be in charge of such a high-end private room. However, because the waiter in charge of that kind of private room suddenly felt unwell and asked for sick leave, she came to replace him.

She placed all the alcohol on the coffee table, not daring to look at the guests in the private room.

That was the waitress’s rule. Waitresses were not prostitutes, so they could not have any improper thoughts about their customers.

If she had not heard the familiar voice, she would not have realized that it was Nox.

With that, she turned her head to take a look. She watched as he held the microphone and sang. At that moment, she was a little surprised, so she took a few more glances at him.

“What are you looking at? Let’s go.” The waitress beside her reminded her in a low voice.

Her tone did not sound good, so Shelly quickly came back to her senses and left the private room.

They were only responsible for delivering the drinks, not for the service in the private room. Moreover, those in the private room had informed the nightclub that no one was allowed in.

When Shelly walked out of the room, the waitress who was with her started to scold her sarcastically. “It’s your first day working in such a high-end private room, so don’t be rude. Of course, there were indeed some high-ranking officials and dignitaries in there. Anyone who seduced them would fly up to the branches and become a phoenix. However, you’d better have some self-awareness. The people here are not people you can hook up with. Don’t think you can take shortcuts just because you’re a little pretty. Let me tell you, stop dreaming about it. There’s no way.”

“Yes.” Shelly quickly agreed.

It was because waitresses were also divided into different grades.

A waitress who was in charge of such a private room had to be superior, so of course, she could only follow her instructions.

Moreover, she felt that the waitress was right. The people inside were all high-ranking officials and dignitaries. It was wishful thinking to think they could hook up.

Seeing that Shelly admitted to her mistake, the waitress did not say anything more.

After the two of them delivered the wine, they stood at the door, waiting for the person inside to give them instructions.

It was past 9 p.m. when a man came into the private room.

He wore a mask and a cap, which made him look very mysterious. There were also quite a number of people beside him, all standing respectfully outside the private room.

After the man went in, those people said to Shelly and the waitress, “We don’t need you here for the time being.”

Shelly and the waitress did not dare to waste any more time and left quickly.

When they were leaving, the waitress could not help but glance behind her. Looking at such a huge lineup, she could not help but ask, “Is it a celebrity? What’s with all the men he has?”

Of course, Shelly knew who it was, but it was not that she recognized him. After all, he was wrapped up tightly, and his clothes were different from usual, so it was difficult to recognize him.

However, because Nox and Finn were inside, it was an easy guess. Then, she thought about the wedding tomorrow, which proved that it must be the Leader.

Despite that, she would not tell the people around her. She just returned to the lounge with the waitress and waited for the next task.

Shelly had just taken a few steps when she suddenly stopped in her tracks, and so did the waitress.

That was the rule of the nightclub, especially in the high-end private rooms. Whenever the waitresses saw a customer, they had to stop and bow.

However, Shelly forgot to bow. Instead, she looked at the woman, who had a man beside her.

The two of them seemed to be a little intimate but did not seem to be…

Perhaps she was overthinking.

“What are you looking at?” The waitress looked up and criticized Shelly unhappily, “Don’t you know that we can’t stare at people in here?”

Shelly quickly nodded.

She had seen Zoe, Nox’s fiancée.
