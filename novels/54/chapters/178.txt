Chapter 179: Fourth Master Swan’s Domineering Appearance

Jeanne continued to look at Eden coldly.

“Women should serve their husbands and follow the four virtues. If you didn’t think so highly of yourself, you wouldn’t have fallen into this state. This applies to seven years ago as well! Seven years ago, if you had graciously accepted the fact that I slept with Jasmine, if you hadn’t been so aggressive, you would be the one who could marry me and enjoy the glory and riches now instead of Jasmine. Compared to Jasmine, I have to admit that you’re at least more attractive.”

‘Glory and riches? Accepting that he cheated on me?’

Jeanne really felt that Eden was extremely laughable at the moment.

Did he think that women should obey men and that it was only right for men to do whatever they wanted?

Moreover, a dog would not change its course.

Having cheated once meant that he would cheat twice.

During this period, did Eden not give Jeanne all sorts of hints so that he could do something disgusting behind Jasmine’s back?!

Jeanne had to admit that there was a period when she did regret it. When she was penniless and living a miserable life abroad, she regretted her impulsive actions. Even after the media exposed that Eden slept with Jasmine, at a certain moment, Jeanne wanted to forgive him. She was also telling herself that Eden did not really like Jasmine and that it was just a spur of the moment…

Now, Jeanne was glad that everything that she had done back then had led to a break with Eden.

Otherwise, if she had forgiven him and gotten back together with him, now that she knew all of Eden’s disgust, she might do something even more extreme.

Eden saw how Jeanne was not saying anything and thought that she was regretting it.

He appeared even more pleased. He asked, “Do you regret everything that you did back then? Do you envy Jasmine very much now?”

Jeanne’s eyes moved slightly.

Eden seemed to be very eager to get her to admit that she regretted treating him that way back then.

Jeanne was cold. She said, “I don’t regret it. I’m even glad that I could get rid of a dirty person like you!”

The smile on Eden’s face instantly froze. He stared fiercely at Jeanne.

“As for Jasmine...” Jeanne smiled sarcastically. “Other than feeling pity for her, there’s nothing else.”

“You’re still a stubborn duck!” Eden gritted his teeth.

“What’s there to be envious about a woman who can’t even control her husband?!”

“Jeanne, you still can’t learn how to please people!” Eden asked fiercely, “Do you know what kind of situation you’re in now?”

Jeanne’s expression changed slightly.

She had to admit that she wanted to kill Eden at this time.

She was clear at this moment that other than Melody leading this matter, Eden had also put a lot of effort into this.

In the past, she was blind to fall for a disgusting man like Eden!

“The facts of your crime are clear now. Once you go to court, the judge will directly sentence you and won’t even give you a second chance to appeal. In other words, this is the only time you can beg me now. Yet, you’re still behaving like seven years ago and don’t know what’s good for you!” Eden said fiercely, “Seven years ago, you might’ve been young and full of vigor. Now, you’re 25 years old and not young anymore, but you’re still so stubborn. Do you think that the things that happened to you seven years ago were not bad enough?!”

Jeanne smiled.

Her smile was very cold.

Even so, she was just so indifferent.

Eden gritted his teeth.

He looked at Jeanne fiercely.

Yes.

Today, he came to see Jeanne with Melody to trample on her. He wanted Jeanne to please him. He wanted her to regret everything that happened in the past and present. He could not accept the fact that Jeanne was showing off in front of him. He could not accept the fact that she was living very well.

Despite that, no matter how Eden tried to guide her, Jeanne was still the same. She treated him lightly.

Compared to letting Jeanne suffer a tragic outcome, Jeanne wanted to see her submit to him. He wanted to see her truly regret and submit to him!

“If I beg you, will you let me go?” Jeanne suddenly opened her mouth. “If I beg you, I’ll only humiliate myself more. I’ll only let you trample on me more happily. Other than that, I won’t get any benefits.”

Eden looked at Jeanne coldly.

This woman knew everything.

She was indeed very smart.

Ever since Jeanne came back, she had displayed a series of actions in the business world. Although Eden was unwilling, he had to admit that she had her abilities. If he did not have the incident with Jasmine back then, he would be married to Jeanne, and she might be able to give him a helping hand in the business world!

Eden gritted his teeth.

He would not admit that he actually despised Jasmine now.

It was to the point that he would feel annoyed whenever he saw Jasmine at home during this period.

Other than fawning on him, acting coquettishly to him, and crying, Jasmine knew nothing else. She could not help him at all in his career!

Eden originally thought that he needed such a woman who would treat him like a king. After all, any man had the desire to conquer, and they all hoped that their woman could completely submit to them. However…

He was starting to hate Jasmine.

He hated that she was useless!

“Jeanne, at this point, you can still think so much. I really admire you,” Melody suddenly said, “If it wasn’t because we’re enemies, you’d really be a talent.”

“Ms. Sanders, you flatter me,” Jeanne replied in a neither servile nor overbearing manner.

Melody sneered. “It’s just that in the greater world, there are many people with talent and ability, but there are very few people with supreme power. Eden is right. If you had a little self-awareness and restrained yourself, you wouldn’t have come to this stage.”

Jeanne did not have any reaction.

“I did come here today to see your sorry state,” Melody admitted.

She was much more straightforward than Eden.

It was probably because of the environment she grew up in, which gave her that confidence and domineering bearing. In front of others, she could be unrestrained.

Melody continued, “If you do as we wish and humble yourself to admit your mistakes... Of course, you’ll still get what you deserve, but at least the process wouldn’t be so tragic.”

Jeanne’s eyes narrowed.

She knew that Melody’s words were the main point.

She looked at her warily.

Melody also saw Jeanne’s sudden change in mood.

‘She’s really smart.

‘She knows when she’s really being threatened.

‘But it’s too late now.

‘It’s too late to beg me.’

Melody wanted to let Jeanne know that if she provoked her, she would suffer a fate worse than death.

She asked, “Eden, I heard that seven years ago, you didn’t even lay a finger on Jeanne?”

“That’s right.” Eden was extremely sarcastic. “Back then, Ms. Lawrence protected herself very well. Even holding hands made her angry. Now, she has brought back an illegitimate child. It’s simply disgusting.”

“Then, if I let you f*ck this woman now, do you think she’s dirty?” Melody was very indifferent. “If you think it’s dirty, I’ll let someone else do it.”

“It’s a little dirty, but I still have my regrets.” Eden smiled viciously.

“In that case, do it before you let someone else do it.” Melody was straightforward. She said such cruel words coldly.

Eden nodded. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Then I’ll leave it to you.” After Melody finished giving her instructions, she turned around and left.

She was not the least bit sloppy.

Jeanne coldly watched her leave. At this moment, she felt Eden’s intense gaze!

She turned around.

Eden’s eyes were filled with malevolence. “Jeanne, have you ever thought that you’d one day be trampled on by me when you never let me touch you back then?!”

Jeanne sneered.

‘Trampled on?!

‘It depends on whether you can actually do it or not.’

Jeanne just watched Eden approach.

Just when she gritted her teeth and prepared to resist…

A familiar male voice suddenly appeared at the door. An incomparably cold voice sounded in the dark detention center. “Eden, you’re really not afraid of death!”
