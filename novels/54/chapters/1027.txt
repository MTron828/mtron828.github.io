1028 The Rise of Monica

“Yes, Chairman.”

“Call Mr. Warren over for me.” Monica said, “And make me a cup of black coffee while you’re at it.”

“Yes.”

After a while, Steve came in and was a little surprised to see Monica.

When he heard that an accident happened during the chairman’s surgery, he thought that Monica would be depressed for many days!

“Give me the contract that the researchers signed with us. Also, call our company’s lawyer over. I want to see if there are any bindings on the contract,” Monica instructed.

Steve was stunned again as he did not expect Monica to be so calm.

However, he quickly said, “Okay, I’ll get it done immediately.”

Once Steve left, Monica turned on her father’s computer. The background of the desktop was a family portrait of her family. At that time, her father was still smiling very happily.

Despite that, she did not allow herself to dwell on it. Instead, she opened the browser and began to search for some relevant information.

After about an hour, Steve walked in with Cardellini Enterprise’s head lawyer, Sean Chance, with a large bundle of contracts in his hands. He also brought the human resources manager along.

When everyone sat in front of Monica’s desk, Monica turned the computer around to face them. “I just did a search on the internet. For technicians and employees who have mastered the core technology, if they choose to resign for reasons other than the company, they can’t enter the competitor’s company within three years without permission. If they violate this, according to the laws of Harken, they will be punished for disclosing the company’s trade secrets. According to the severity of the case, the maximum sentence is 10 years in prison!”

“Yes.” Sean Chance gave confirmed and added, “That’s why we didn’t draw up that clause when we drafted the contract back then. It’s because Harken has this law to control it.”

Steve was shocked.

That did not even cross his mind. All he could think of was to make them stay using the expensive damages for the breach of contract and by bowing down to them!

At that moment, after listening to what Monica said, he felt like he finally saw the light of day. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Monica was really a pleasant surprise.

He thought that she would not be able to recover from this setback and that she did not know anything. However, just when he was not paying attention, she caught him off guard.

“Now, let’s look at the contents of the contract.” Now that Monica had become more capable, she no longer talked any nonsense.

The only reason she could think of that was that she had been thinking about it all night.

It turned out that the heavens really rewarded those who worked hard.

She did not know how she came up with that idea. Perhaps it was an epiphany, but she suddenly felt that in business, it was impossible to just take away the fruits of others’ labor just like that. According to the system in Harken, it would definitely be controlled. Hence, she got up in the early morning to search for information, and when she found that regulation, she came to confirm it with the lawyer today.

All she wanted to do was confirm it, and she had nothing to be proud of.

After all, that was only one of the few problems that Cardellini Enterprise was currently facing. There were still many more problems that she might not even have the chance to catch her breath.

She looked at the contract seriously and said, “The contract states that if they resign without a reason, Party B must pay double the total salary during their employment. In other words, if these people resign, they will have to pay double their salary for the breach of contract. Cardellini Enterprise’s salary for these people has never been low, so I estimate that the minimum compensation for each will be 50 thousand dollars.”

“Yes, we’ve done the calculation. 15 core technical personnel have resigned, so the total compensation will be 13.5 million dollars,” the director of the human resources department quickly replied.

“After these people leave, how many core members will we have left?” Monica asked.

“There are only 20 technicians who have mastered the development of Cardellini Enterprise’s drugs.”

“So, we only have five left.”

“That’s right. These five were the ones who fought alongside your father back then, so they stayed because of their relationship!”

“Alright.” Monica nodded. “To Cardellini Enterprise, it doesn’t matter whether we have ten, five, or even three people left! Our newly developed drugs have already matured and are now in production. Without those core technicians, we can still operate. It’s also impossible to develop new drugs in the short term, so we have enough time to recruit new talents.”

“Yes, but the problem we’re facing now is that Cardellini Enterprise has no market! At present, all the pharmaceutical markets are rejecting our products, and our stock market is plummeting! If this continues, I’m afraid Cardellini Enterprise will go bankrupt!” Steve interrupted.
