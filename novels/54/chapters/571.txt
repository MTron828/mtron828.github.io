Chapter 572: Giving Them A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It could not be Edward. Nox knew that the person to compromise in that matter was definitely not Edward.

In that case, the person could only be Jeanne.

However, how was Edward so confident that he could make Jeanne compromise?

Nox sighed.

He really felt that Eldest Young Lady Lawrence was not so easy to talk to.

Hopefully, miracles exist in the world!

…

After Jeanne and Edward hung up the phone, many thoughts ran through her mind.

She had a feeling that Edward’s departure this time was not simple.

She tried to figure out why he had to leave in such a hurry, but she was afraid to find out. Hence, in the end, she chose to not think about it.

Kingsley always said that Edward and she stood on opposite sides.

Since Edward was not an orphan from the Duncans, were they still on opposite sides?

In fact, she was very conflicted. Sometimes, she would be afraid of losing as well.

Even if she kept thinking about it, she would not have any regrets.

After work in the afternoon, Jeanne went to the Lawrence family’s manor.

When she walked into the hall, Alexander and Joshua were already back.

The moment the two of them saw Jeanne, their expressions were ghastly.

Even Jenifer, who was warmly greeting Alexander, had a change in expression.

The family really was not hiding anything from her now.

“What are you doing here?” Alexander’s expression darkened.

Had she not pissed him off enough today? Why was she back to make things difficult for him again?

“I came back for dinner,” Jeanne replied.

“Did I tell you to come back?” Alexander raised his voice.

“I told her to come back!” The door to the elevator in the living room opened, and Jonathan’s stern voice sounded.

Shocked, Alexander quickly turned his head.

Jonathan, in his wheelchair, was pushed over by a servant, and his expression was grim. “What’s wrong? Do I need your permission to tell Jeannie to come home for a simple dinner?”

“Dad, I didn’t mean that. I meant that Jeanne just showed up and didn’t tell us beforehand that she was coming back. I was afraid that the servants at home didn’t prepare her portion.” Alexander was unhappy, but he still acted very respectfully.

“Why does Jeannie have to inform us beforehand to come back to her home? From now on, inform the kitchen to prepare her portion. So, when Jeannie returns, she can eat as she wants.”

Alexander was unhappy about what Jonathan said.

However, Jonathan pretended not to see it. He had the servants push him in front of Jeanne, whom he asked, “Where’s Edward?”

“He has some business to attend to at the last minute.”

Jonathan did not mind either, and he said gently, “Go wash your hands and get ready for dinner.”

“Okay.” Jeanne quickly went to the restroom.

At the same time, Jonathan shouted at Jenifer, who was stunned at the side. “Tell the kitchen to set the table.”

“Yes.” Jenifer quickly reacted and immediately went to the kitchen.

As soon as Jeanne closed the door to the restroom, the corners of her mouth curled into a smirk.

Jonathan thought he was trying to curry favor with her, but little did he know that his actions were making Alexander jealous.

Once Alexander no longer trusted Jonathan…

Jeanne smiled cruelly.

That was the end that Jonathan deserved.

After that, she walked out of the restroom, where Jonathan seemed to be waiting for her.

Jeanne walked to Jonathan’s side obediently, took the wheelchair from the servant’s hands, and pushed Jonathan into the dining room.

After all, Jonathan had not eaten with them for a long time. Yet now, because of Jeanne, he was sitting at the dining table again.

Alexander had to move out from his seat as the head of the family. To Alexander, it was an unacceptable insult to him.

As the dishes were served, Joshua’s expression changed when he saw the cuisine in front of him.

“What dishes did you cook today? None of them are what I like to eat! Bring the chef out!”

“Shut up!” Jonathan’s expression darkened.

Joshua was shocked.

“I told the kitchen to make them.”

“Grandpa, you know I don’t like to eat these–”

“But Jeannie does. I specially told the kitchen to make it for her. If you don’t like it, don’t eat it.” Jonathan was visibly unhappy.

Joshua was so angry that he was about to explode, so Jenifer quickly tried to smooth things over. “It’s rare for Jeannie to come back, and it’s only right to have the chef cook the dishes Jeannie likes. Come, let me serve you a bowl of mushroom soup. It’s delicious. I believe you will like it very much...”

As she spoke, Jenifer took the initiative to serve Jeanne the soup.

It was a deliberate act on Jenifer’s part, but Jeanne did not reject it.

The moment Jenifer served the bowl of soup to Jeanne, Jeanne touched Jenifer seamlessly.

As a result, the boiling soup splashed onto the back of Jenifer’s hand. Jenifer was so startled that threw the soup aside.

As Jeanne’s hand was right in front of the bowl of soup, a part of it splashed onto the back of Jeanne’s hand. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ow!” Jeanne cried out.

Due to that commotion, everyone at the dining table looked at Jeanne nervously.

Jenifer was also shocked as she had never made such a mistake after so many years.

Moreover, she was certain that she only let go of the bowl of soup because Jeanne touched her. Hence, she said in a somewhat reproachful tone, “Jeannie, why did you touch me–”

“Ow!” Jeanne seemed to be in extreme pain.

Jonathan hurriedly instructed the maid, “Go and get some ice for Eldest Young Lady Lawrence.”

The maid hurriedly followed his instructions.

Jeanne covered the back of her reddened hand. “Mother, how can you pour soup on my hand and say I touched you? I thought it was a careless mistake and didn’t want to argue about it, but you’re such a wicked person for blaming it on me. What do you think I should think of that?”

“I’m the one blaming you? You were the one who touched me–” Jenifer tried to explain.

Jeanne interrupted her and even appeared aggrieved. “It’s fine if you don’t like me and don’t welcome me back. All you have to do is tell me, and I won’t come back anymore. If I miss grandpa, I’ll call or video call him. You don’t have to beat around the bush to tell me this.”

Jenifer was trying to suppress her anger at that moment, and she was so angry that she could not speak.

She was the one who had been wronged, yet now Jeanne was the victim instead.

When did that b*tch become so good at acting?

Jeanne looked at Jenifer’s expression and snickered in her heart.

She also wanted to let Jenifer have a taste of her own medicine!
