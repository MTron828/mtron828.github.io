“Monica, what right do you have to say that you love me?” Finn questioned her.

Monica’s eyes were red as she looked at Finn’s cold expression.

At the end of the day, who was hurting whom?

She fell to the ground, her heart aching like hell.

Finn had, time and time again, pushed her away so mercilessly.

She thought it was ironic. She was desperately trying to save that relationship and use the lowly method to save it, yet Finn was still indifferent to her.

Was it because she did not have the right to say she loved him? Or was it because he did not need her love at all?

“Is it because you don’t believe anything I say?” Monica stared at Finn. “Just because I’m helping Michael, I’m considered dead to you, right?”

Finn’s cold face seemed to be extremely patient.

“Have you ever thought about why I’ll help Michael even when everyone thinks I’m wrong? It’s not because I’m stupid. It’s because I can’t live with my conscience! It’s because I’m afraid that if I don’t help Michael this time, I’ll feel extremely guilty about Michael in the future. That way, there will always be a Michael between us, and I’ll always think of him. But if I try my best to help him now, you’ll be the only one in my world–”

“Monica, I don’t care about you helping Michael. What I care about is that no matter what I say to you, you won’t believe me!” Finn interrupted her with that cold and heartless tone of his. “I said, don’t help Michael by returning to his side, but you didn’t listen. I said, let’s think of other ways to help Michael, but you refused. I said, Michael doesn’t need your help, but you don’t believe me. What can I say to you about Michael? What’s the use?”

“Michael has been in politics for many years and knows better than anyone else how to deal with his crisis. Staying with him to shut up the media and improve his image is the best way for him.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“So, even now, you only trust him.” Finn smiled.

It was a cold and icy smile that could make people’s hair stand on end.

Monica bit her lips tightly.

Yes, she really trusted Michael.

She believed he would not lie to him and that he would not do anything to hurt her.

She had always thought that Michael was the best man in the world, at least to her.

“Monica, let’s just leave it at that.” Finn said, “From the moment you chose to divorce me, our relationship was already over. In the future, don’t come near me again. I’m afraid I won’t be able to control myself and kill you.”

Monica’s tears blurred her vision as she watched Finn open the door like she was nothing to him.

She said, “Finn, have you ever put effort into this relationship?”

Finn was startled.

“From the moment I chased you six years ago, have you put in any effort?” Monica questioned him.

Finn gulped.

“I pursued you with all my heart, and everyone in the city knows it. Yet, because I misunderstood you, you chose to turn around and leave without giving me any explanation.” Monica put her hand over her heart! She really felt pain here. Thinking back to all the years they had been together, had Finn fought for their relationship?

She sobbed.

“Now that I’m trying my best to keep you, you still choose to abandon me.” Monica tried her best to control her voice. “I’m so afraid of losing you, yet you can walk away unaffected!”

Finn tightened his grip on the door handle.

Without turning around, he said, “Because... Before Michael, I’m nothing to you.”

Monica was stunned.

After saying that, Finn left without looking back while Monica stared at Finn’s cold back.

In the end, she failed, no matter what method she used.

She lay on the ground stiffly and looked at the crystal chandelier above her head. Tears rolled down from the corners of her eyes like crazy.

If Finn was worthless, would she be crying so miserably? Would her heart be so broken?

In that case, should she let go?

From now on, they would go their separate ways. After all, no matter how hard she tried, she could not get Finn to stay.

…

Finn left the Cardellini family’s villa.
