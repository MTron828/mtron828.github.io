859 Jeanne and Monica’s Joint Counterattack

“A b*tch, right?”

Monica could tell what Finn was thinking by the expression on Finn’s face. She saw his disdain for her.

‘B*tch’ was the word that hurt her the most out of all the vicious comments she had seen about her. In everyone’s heart, she was the dirtiest, nastiest being to ever exist.

However, she chose to accept it calmly.

Since she was not the smartest and did not have many means, she could only use the stupidest way she could think of to solve the problem. Obviously, her plan had backfired on her a little. She had even lost herself in the midst of it all.

Her expression was very calm. Finn, on the other hand, looked stunned. Though he was quick to recover his composure and turned around to get into the taxi. Without saying another word, he left.

Monica continued staring at Finn’s back in a daze. He must be even more disgusted by her now.

She stood at the entrance of the hotel, a little cold, waiting for a taxi. There were usually quite a number of cars coming and going from this hotel. However, after Finn took one and left, it took a long time before the next one came.

Her entire body was freezing from waiting. Finally, a taxi came. As she sat inside, she suddenly felt that the world was frighteningly cold. She didn’t know when it started, but life seemed meaningless.

Suddenly, her phone rang.

Monica glanced at the caller before casually picking it up. “Michael.”

“Couldn’t hold it in any longer, could you?”

“Monica, are you sure you want to keep doing this?” The other party asked her coldly.

In reality, she could not tell if he was irritable or not. After all, there were many who could hide their emotions so well that no one would be able to notice.

Michael could. Finn could do it too. She was the exception, and she did not know when she would be able to learn it.

“I’m very sure,” she answered certainly.

“Just know that you forced me to do this.” Michael hung up after saying this.

He was clearly threatening her, but Monica did not care.

To be frank, at the time Monica had been deeply deceived by Michael, she still had not known how sinister a human’s heart could be. She did not believe that Michael was bad, but that deceiving her was the bottom line of human nature.

She always thought that the earth-shattering things Jeanne experienced would never happen to her. She had two parents who treated her very well and an impressive family background. Just from these points alone, she was much, much happier than many people.

However, she was indeed too innocent.

The next day, Cardellini Medical Technology suffered a heavy blow. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Many large hospitals and pharmacy chains began boycotting Cardellini Enterprise. They rejected their drugs one after another and requested for Cardellini Medical Technology to carry out internal rectification. Due to all of Monica’s indecent photos being leaked to the pharmaceutical industry, it caused a frenzy. The sudden internal scandal caused Cardellini Enterprise, which had always taken the path of being friendly to the common people, and Cardellini Medical Technology, with its high reputation, to suffer a serious blow. Cardellini Enterprise’s shareholders made a joint request to dismiss Gary, the chairman of Cardellini Enterprise and even encouraged all employees to go on strike as protest.

Cardellini Medical Technology’s internal department was in absolute chaos. At this moment, another pharmaceutical company with a similar motto to that of Cardellini Medical Technology had risen out of thin air. Moreover, the pharmaceutical products sold by them were similar to Cardellini Medical Technology’s as well. However, as a newly-established pharmaceutical company, it had no reputation within the medical field to back them up and was not very competitive in the internal sales market. No ordinary hospitals or pharmacies would choose to cooperate with them.

So Cardellini Enterprise did not think too much about them. After all, for so many years, there had been countless pharmaceutical companies, but none had threatened Cardellini Medical Technology sales.

It was only because of Monica’s scandal this time that the entire medical industry boycotted them, giving this pharmaceutical company a loophole to develop and gain momentum.

Under both internal and external pressure, Gary could not take it anymore. Even from the start of the company’s troubles, he had not told Monica anything about what he had suffered. When her parents decided to support her, they really meant it.

It was Michael who had told Cardellini Enterprise’s current situation to Monica. Only then did Monica know the reason why her father had been working overtime so frequently and even staying up all night.
