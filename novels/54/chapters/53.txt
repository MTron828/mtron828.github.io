Chapter 54: Ms. Lawrence, I’ve Taken a Fancy to You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Cardellini family’s villa.

During lunch, Nox had also rushed over to freeload.

A bunch of people were gathered around the table, chatting and laughing.

“Jeannie, who’s the child’s father?” Ruby asked as she took care of George.

Jeanne was stunned.

At this moment, everyone’s gaze seemed to be on her.

This included Edward.

Before Jeanne could speak, Monica said, “A pig.”

“What?” Ruby looked at her daughter. She always said something irrelevant as if she had never grown up.

“Jeannie said that her son’s father is a pig, which is also the reason behind George’s name,” Monica explained seriously.

“Pfft.” Nox burst into laughter.

He had been jolly ever since Ms. Lawrence returned!

Edward glanced at Nox coldly.

Nox sat up straight and continued to eat.

“Child, what nonsense are you spouting?!” Ruby knocked on Monica’s head. “How can it be a pig? Which pig could give birth to such a cute George?”

Nox glanced at Edward.

He thought to himself, ‘There—this one next to me.’

Jeanne said, “George’s father is no longer alive.”

“I see.” Ruby’s heart ached a little, but because the topic was sensitive, she did not ask any further.

Nox laughed even more cheerfully at the side.

‘Edward is not only a pig but also a slaughtered one.’

“What are you laughing at?!” Monica sat opposite Nox and was a little speechless. “Are you happy that Jeannie’s husband is dead? Do you fancy her?!”

“Ms. Cardellini, you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t say whatever you want.” Nox looked serious. “I don’t dare to have any improper thoughts toward Ms. Lawrence.”

He would not dare to do so no matter how bold he was.

“Monica,” Gary suddenly said, “What happened to your family planning?”

“...” Monica’s face turned red. “Dad, why are you talking about this at the table?”

“You’re not young anymore. Look at Jeannie’s child.”

“Jeannie gave birth at the age of 19 and played with fire at the age of 18. If I wanted to do something at the age of 18, you’d probably break my legs! Now, you’re asking me to have a child. I refuse!”

“Are you trying to anger me to death?!” Gary scolded.

“If I wanted to anger you to death, I would’ve divorced Finn...”

“Monica!” Gary was even angrier.

Monica pursed her lips. “Alright, alright. Giving birth isn’t something that I can do alone. Can I give birth just because I want to? It also depends on whether someone can do it or not!”

Then, everyone looked at Finn.

Finn was eating quietly.

“You can’t do it?” Nox asked.

Finn swallowed his food and wiped her mouth. He said respectfully to Gary, “Dad, I’ll consider it with Monica.”

Monica rolled her eyes.

The most vicious person was Finn!

“Now that your mother and I are still healthy, we can spend more time with the child if you give birth to one earlier.” Gary was much gentler to Finn.

“Okay.” Finn agreed.

Monica was speechless.

‘He only knows how to act in front of my parents.’

She turned to Edward and asked, “Fourth Master, why did you kiss Jeannie at the wedding yesterday?”

“Cough, cough.” Jeanne drank a mouthful of soup and almost choked to death.

Monica was always so unexpected.

“What?” Ruby was very surprised.

Jeanne quickly wiped her mouth and said, “Auntie, your chicken soup is really delicious. It has the medicinal fragrance of ginseng and astragali. It’s delicious and sweet.”

“If you like it, come more often. I’ll make it for you,” After receiving the praise, Ruby said with a smile on her face.

“Okay.”

“Why did you interrupt me?” Monica looked unhappy.

Jeanne glared at Monica.

Edward suddenly said, “Because I wanted to.”

‘It was because he wanted to…’

Could this man be any more straightforward?!

Everyone looked at Edward at the same time.

He did not change his expression. “I’m working hard to pursue Ms. Lawrence..”

“What?!” Ruby was shocked.

Gary, who was next to her, was also shocked.

On the contrary, Nox and Finn looked calm as if they had known this for a long time.

“Fourth Master, I helped you at the wedding. It’s fine if you don’t thank me, but I hope you won’t make things difficult and burden me.”

“Is liking you a burden to you?”

“Is liking someone a casual thing to you?”

“Have you ever heard of me liking someone else, Ms. Lawrence?”

Jeanne was stunned.

Everyone thought that Fourth Master Swan... was not a real man.

Naturally, there were no scandals involving him.

“Ms. Lawrence.” Edward suddenly put down his cutleries and looked unusually serious.

Once he was serious, his aura appeared especially strong.

He said, “I’m sure I’ve taken a fancy to you!”

Every word was clear and distinct.

Jeanne pursed her lips. At this moment, she was a little shocked by Edward’s determination.

He said to everyone at the dining table, “I’m done eating.”

Then, he stood up and left while the others watched.

It took Monica quite a while to react to the situation. Her heart was beating fast as she said, “Damn, Fourth Master Swan was so imposing even when he confessed! It made me blush and my heart beat faster.”

Finn glanced at Monica. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Monica did not respond. She looked at Jeanne excitedly. “Jeannie, Fourth Master has taken the initiative. Don’t be so reserved.”

Jeanne seemed to have just come back to her senses.

She said, “I’m full too.”

“Hey.” Monica saw that Jeanne had left the table.

After leaving the table, Jeanne seemed to be chasing after Fourth Master Swan.

No matter what, they looked like... a perfect match!

Jeanne strode toward the back garden.

Edward leaned against a pillar in the garden and smoked.

The way he smoked seemed to be much more elegant than the average person.

His eyes moved slightly as he looked at Jeanne.

Jeanne walked over.

Edward intended to put out the cigarette butt.

“That’s not necessary,” Jeanne said, “I don’t mind.”

In the end, Edward still put out the cigarette.

Jeanne did not care about these details. She said bluntly, “I thought I made it clear yesterday.”

“It’s your business if you don’t like me. I can still like you.”

“What exactly do you see in me?” Jeanne was a little flustered and exasperated. “I have a child. Aren’t you afraid of being ridiculed by the world?”

“Is it important what the world thinks of me?” Edward raised his eyebrow.

“Do your parents’ opinions don’t matter either?”

Edward’s eyes narrowed.

“I don’t like to cause unnecessary trouble. Fourth Master, please be merciful.”

“Seven years ago... What happened?” Edward stared at Jeanne.

Jeanne bit her lip.

“Didn’t you want to be Eden’s fourth aunt?” Edward approached Jeanne.

Jeanne unconsciously retreated to the pillar.

“I agree to that.” Edward leaned over and placed his large hand on the pillar. His face was very close to hers.

At that moment, Jeanne seemed to be able to feel the warm breath of the person in front of her, but it also seemed to carry a trace of coldness.

“I agree to it, so what right do you have to go back on your word?!” He asked her.

He was questioning her!
