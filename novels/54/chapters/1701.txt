Chapter 1702: It Turns Out That Shelly Really Doesn ‘t Like Him

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It suddenly feels to me that you don’t like me very much,” Nox said sarcastically.

Shelly did not answer, which meant she tacitly agreed with his statement. It turned out that Shelly really did not like him.

He thought he would not care about whether Shelly liked him or not, but his heart hurt so much.

After Mrs. Winter left Nox’s apartment and went back to her private car, she was still angry. She found that Shelly had changed a lot and was seemingly much more independent than before.

Back then, Shelly would listen to everything she said, but now, Shelly even had the nerve to reject her suggestion about them getting married and having children. At the end of the day, she was a little unhappy, especially since she had been looking forward to seeing grandchildren of her own for so many years.

All the wealthy ladies around her already had grandchildren of their own. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

When thew had dinner- afternoon tem and or heanty anpointments together- they would talk about their fat grandchildren and obedient granddaughters. Although she said she was happy without grandchildren, she knew better than anyone how much she wanted one.

Now, she really wished she had a baby in her arms, and the thought of it frustrated her even more. Hence, she realized she had to think of a way to get Nox and Shelly to get married soon and have a child.

Suddenly, she lowered her head and looked at her phone, which was ringing. She glanced at the unknown caller and took a deep breath before answering the call. “Hello.”

“Aunty, I’m Zoe.” Zoe’s sobbing voice could be heard from the other end of the phone.

Mrs. Winter’s expression darkened immediately. She could not believe Zoe still had the cheek to call her. When she thought of what that woman had done to her son, she wanted to slap her to death. To think the dignified young master of the Winters had been toyed with by a woman to such an extent!

Now, not only did that woman not stay away, but she even took the initiative to look for her.

“I don’t want to receive your calls or see you ever again. Don’t call me. It’s useless to say anything to me now. I won’t change my opinion of you, nor will I be soft-hearted. I might even hate you to the core-I‘

“I’m pregnant. I’m pregnant with Nox’s child,” Zoe said emotionally.

Mrs. Winter was stunned.

The next second, she said righteously, “You’re saying it’s Nox’s child because you’re pregnant? You cheated on Nox so many times back then. Who knows whose child you’re pregnant with?”

“It really is Nox’s. It’s been nearly four months now. Aunty, I’ve found someone to do a gender test, and it’s a boy.” Zoe said miserably, “I know you won’t forgive me for what I did to Nox, but the child is innocent. Aunty, the child is a

Winter.”

Mrs. Winter was swayed by Zoe’s words.

Zoe could also feel the change in Mrs. Winter’s emotions and quickly said, “Aunty, don’t worry. I won’t pester Nox. After all, I don’t have the right to be with Nox anymore! The reason for my call is to tell you that I’m pregnant with Nox’s child. I want to give birth to it, but with my current financial situation, I can’t take good care of him or give him enough nutrition, so my only choice is to come to you. I’ve also made up my mind. When I give birth to the child, I’ll hand the child over to you and leave Nox. I won’t make things difficult for you!

I just want to give birth to this child.”

“Don’t lie to me!” Mrs. Winter was still in disbelief.

“Aunty, science is so advanced now that we can do a paternity test. If you don’t believe me, you can arrange for me to do a paternity test. I can do it right now!”

Zoe quickly said,

It was safe to say that Mrs. Winter was skeptical about it.

“How about this, Aunty? Let’s meet and have a good talk. If you still don’t believe me, I won’t disturb you anymore!” Zoe’s voice sounded like she was choking.

Mrs. Winter knew she should not trust Zoe so easily and that she would never forgive that woman, but when it came to children..

At the thought of how Shelly had rejected her today, she felt inexplicably angry. As such, she gave Zoe an address where Zoe could wait for her.

Zoe immediately agreed, and Mrs. Winter also headed to that address. As she was not far away by car, she arrived first. After waiting in the private room for almost half an hour, Mrs. Winter ran out of patience, and only then was Zoe led in by the staff.

The moment Zoe entered, Mrs. Winter thought she had seen wrongly. What

had Zoe, who was originally glamorous and beautiful, gone through in just a few months to end up like that?

Zoe looked extremely old, and if she did not know it was Zoe, she would have thought that she was a 40-year-old lady.

Zoe looked at Mrs. Winter’s gaze and lowered her head in shame. “You probably didn’t expect me to end up like this, did you? “You deserve it!” Mrs. Winter was not soft-hearted.

Zoe only had herself to blame!

“Yes, I deserve it. I never expected you would pity me or sympathize with me. If it weren’t for the child in my stomach and if I didn’t want to give birth to him, I wouldn’t have come to you!”

As Zoe spoke, she could not help but cry miserably..
