At the dining table, Jeanne held the back of her aching hand while accusing Jenifer of doing it on purpose.

Jenifer was so angry that she could not even speak, so she just stared at Jeanne with her eyes wide open.

Regardless seven years ago or seven years later, Jeanne had always had a conflict with her. However, Jeanne had never framed her on purpose like that before.

After all, pretending to be pitiful and blaming others was her specialty.

She remained silent for a long time.

At that moment, the servant respectfully handed Jeanne an ice cube.

Jeanne was icing her hand as she said somewhat uncomfortably, “Grandpa, it seems I’m not welcome here. I think I shouldn’t come back from now on so that I won’t make people unhappy.”

“What nonsense are you saying? Your family name is Lawrence, so you’re part of the family.” Jonathan reprimanded Jeanne in a doting manner before turning his head to face Jenifer. His expression was much uglier, and he spoke sternly, “I don’t care what you all used to think of Jeanne, but from today onward, if any of you do anything bad to Jeanne, I will not let it go! In this family, I’ve always been the one in charge, and no one else is supposed to say otherwise. If I find out someone is deliberately targeting Jeanne again, I will kick them out of the family.”

Even though he did not accuse Jenifer, his words were clearly directed at her. It turned Jenifer’s face red and then pale.

She glared fiercely at Jeanne, who was smiling smugly.

The next second, Jeanne acted unusually well-behaved. “Thank you, grandpa. I always felt that this family didn’t welcome me. But now, I have no such worries.”

“You shouldn’t have to worry in the first place.” It was obvious how well Jonathan was treating Jeanne. “Come. Since I’ve told them to make some of your favorite dishes, eat more.”

As he spoke, he placed the dishes onto Jeanne’s plate.

“Okay.” Jeanne looked happy.

Then, she took the initiative to place the dishes onto Jonathan’s plate as well.

Both their interaction at the dining table was heartwarming.

At that, Jenifer’s face turned black with anger, but she did not dare to say a single word.

Joshua looked at the table full of dishes he did not like. He had long wanted to throw his utensils on the floor and leave. However, with his grandfather suddenly treating Jeanne so well, he felt he had lost his position in the Lawrences.

At the thought that Jonathan was teaching Jeanne how to grow the Lawrences, he started to think that Jonathan wanted to hand Lawrence Enterprise over to Jeanne.

No. He refused to give Jeanne what belonged to him!

Joshua’s entire face twisted in anger, looking especially ferocious.

Naturally, Alexander was also sulking and seething with anger.

Never in a million years did he imagine that his father would protect Jeanne so much and make it so obvious.

Was his father’s attitude toward Jeanne not an insult to him?

His father knew full well that he did not like Jeanne, yet his father was treating Jeanne so well.

That was simply humiliating.

In that case, did he have to curry favor with Jeanne too? How ridiculous.

At the dinner table, each had their own thoughts.

After they finished eating, Jeanne accompanied Jonathan to his study, where they discussed work matters. However, they did not call Alexander or Joshua to join them.

Alexander suppressed his anger that was on the verge of erupting.

Jeanne was in Jonathan’s study for a long time.

In fact, they did not talk about much. They were just putting up an act as if they cared for each other.

As soon as Jeanne left Jonathan’s study, she saw Alexander, who looked like he was waiting for her on purpose.

Jeanne knew Alexander would not be able to hold himself back.

She walked over calmly and even smiled sweetly. “Dad.”

“What did you and your grandfather talk about for so long?” Alexander went straight to the point.

It seemed that he probably did not have much patience for her.

Not only that, but he was also worried.

Jeanne said, “We were talking about some work matters. Grandfather said that even though those senior managers have willingly accepted our arrangements, we’ll still have to pay special attention to them. We can’t cause any negative impact on Lawrence Enterprise. He even gave me a separate analysis of what a few of them might do and told me to keep an eye on them. Oh, right. Grandpa also said I should fill in those vacancies in the senior management as soon as possible. He said a lot of things, so I’ll have to go back and digest them before I explain them to you. Anyway, grandpa also said he would leave it to me to handle, so there’s no need for you to worry, father.”
