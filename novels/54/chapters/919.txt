920 Have You Really Let Go of Finn?

“You won’t,” Finn said coldly. After all, she was not who he rushed into the fire for.

Sarah’s heart ached when she saw Finn’s expression. However, as long as there was a glimmer of hope, she would not give up.

She said, ” I’ll be your girlfriend. It doesn’t matter if it’s real or fake.”

“It won’t be more than half a year.” Finn had given her a time limit.

“Alright,” she said. Half a year it was.

She believed that she would be able to save Finn in half a year. Back then, her cousin only had such a short period too! She did not think that she was worse than her cousin nor that she loved Finn any less than her. One day, she would be with Finn!

…

On a private jet in the sky above South Hampton City.

The assassins of the Hills immediately retreated back to Delta Island. As there were no casualties in this incident, the number of people who came on this mission was the same as those who went back. Everyone had already taken off their human-skinned masks and wigs. Assassins did not talk much, so it was quiet on the plane.

A female voice suddenly rang out. “Jeanne, are you hurt?” It was Melinda, asking her out of concern.

Jeanne turned to look at her. “I’m fine.”

“That’s good. I was afraid that you would be when I saw you suddenly rush into the fire. I thought Lucy would stop you, or else I would never have let you in,” Melinda said deliberately.

She had said it on purpose for Kingsley to hear. She knew very well that Kingsley was very angry at Jeanne for returning to the burning wedding hall without a care for her life.

Jeanne’s eyes turned cold. “That’s my decision. It has nothing to do with Lucy.”

“That’s true. Fortunately, you weren’t injured. Otherwise…” Melinda looked very worried. “Mr. Hill would be very sad.”

Kingsley glanced at Melinda, and she quickly shut her mouth.

Then, Lucy took the initiative to say, “I didn’t stop her.”

“You seem to disobey me often.” Kingsley’s expression was cold. “Don’t think too highly of yourself.”

“Understood,” Lucy said respectfully.

Jeanne really could not stand how Kingsley treated Lucy. She could not take it anymore and said, “Why didn’t you say that she took herself too seriously when you slept with her?!”

Kingsley’s expression turned cold.

Melinda quickly said, “Jeanne, how can you say that about Mr. Hill? Lucy and I willingly slept with Mr. Hill. We’re all members of the Hills. Once we enter the Hills, we’re members for life. Since Mr. Hill’s the head of the Hills, we’re all naturally his. So, it’s only right Mr. Hill gets to do what he wants with us.”

Jeanne sneered. “Do you think you’re some ancient king?”

“Jeanne!” Kingsley said coldly. “I don’t need you interfering in my matters.”

“Then why are you interfering in mine? I went in to save Monica, my best friend. What right do you have to stop me?! Lucy couldn’t, so what right do you have to give her that attitude?! Are you planning to return to Delta Island and throw Lucy into the dungeon to be tied up and abused again?” Jeanne mocked.

Kingsley looked at Jeanne coldly.

The two of them had very strong auras. If Kingsley was a big tiger, ferocious and ruthless, Jeanne was definitely a cub. While the cub could not beat the big tiger, once it invaded the cub’s territory, the cub could bite back.

Due to the dispute between the two on the plane, the other assassins did not dare to even breathe. They were afraid of being implicated. After all, everyone knew that Kingsley could kill anyone without reason, but he would not touch a single hair on Jeanne’s head!

“I’ll say it again. I decided to go back and save Monica. If you punish Lucy because of this, I will blow up your manor in Delta Island!” Jeanne looked determined.

She understood Kingsley’s methods all too well. Even though Lucy had helped her so much, Kingsley would definitely punish her since she did not listen to his orders. Kingsley’s attacks had never been light either.

Kingsley’s expression was extremely unsightly. The two of them were now in a deadlock, and no one dared to take the bullet.

Lucy did not dare to interrupt. From her perspective, it was wrong to help anyone. She could only watch the two of them explode in anger.

The stalemate continued for a long time, and the atmosphere on the plane was suffocating.

Melinda suddenly spoke. It was as if she was trying to change the topic. “I saw that Fourth Master Swan seemed to be injured today.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

No one paid attention to Melinda, but it broke the stalemate a little and gave Kingsley a way out. She continued, “However, it was too dark, and I couldn’t see clearly. Lucy, you should know.”

Lucy’s face darkened.

‘I think I saw you shooting Fourth Master Swan when he trapped Jeanne…” Melinda said. “Right?”

Jeanne turned to look at Lucy. So Lucy had been the one who fired the bullet.

She pursed her lips. Lucy did not try to defend herself.

Melinda asked again, “Was it a hit? It was too dark, and I couldn’t see clearly.” It was as if she was forcing Lucy to admit it.

Lucy responded.

“I noticed that Fourth Master Swan’s attention was always on Jeanne. It was indeed a good opportunity to make a move.” Melinda continued to fan the flames. It was all to cause conflict between Lucy and Jeanne.

It was clear Jeanne and Fourth Master Swan still had feelings for each other. Even if the two of them were on opposing sides, they could not bear to hurt one other. If Jeanne were to find out that Lucy wanted to kill Fourth Master Swan behind her back, there would definitely be a grudge between them.

Melinda’s biggest threat now was Lucy. She had observed her in-depth and realized that Kingsley treated Lucy differently from the others. If Lucy stayed by Kingsley’s side a little longer and gained his favor, especially with Jeanne’s protection of Lucy, Melinda’s status in the Hills would immediately plummet. Hence, she had to find a way to get rid of Lucy.

Lucy looked at Melinda coldly. She knew her motive all too well.

In front of everyone, she did not give Melinda any face and said bluntly, “Melinda, it’s not a good thing to be too eager for quick success.”

Melinda’s face turned pale at Lucy’s words. She had not expected Lucy to talk back to her in such a way!
