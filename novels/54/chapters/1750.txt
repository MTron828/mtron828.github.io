Chapter 1751: Shelly’s Change of Heart Towards Nox

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There were also serious bruises on his inner thigh. Almost his entire thigh was bruised and swollen, which looked even more terrifying.

Just as Nox was about to clean his wound with the povidone, he saw the door open. For a second, Nox wanted to dodge. However, Shelly saw it, so he did not bother to hide anymore.

He said, “It’s nothing. It’s just a superficial wound. It’ll be fine after I clean and dress it.”

The more Nox said that, the more guilty Shelly felt. In all the years she had been with Nox, she had never felt that way about him.

She always believed that she did not owe Nox anything in this life, but Nox owed her a lot. Even if he saved Bella for her, she would only be grateful to him and did not think she had let him down in any way. That was why she thought her coldness and dislike toward Nox were reasonable. However, seeing Nox like that at that moment made her feel bad.

She took a deep breath to stop herself from overthinking. Then, she walked over and took the povidone from Nox’s hand.

“Let me help you.”

“No need. You can go and do your own thing. It’S just a minor injury. I’ll just clean it.”

However, seeing that Shelly had taken the povidone from him, Nox pursed his lips and looked at Shelly. He had never thought of using that method to bind or move Shelly. He did not even want her to know. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He was always afraid that Shelly would think that he was pretending and deliberately play the pity card, which would make her hate him even more. He Imew very well that when a person did not love another person, no matter what the other person did, she would not pity him or be moved by him.

Nox watched as Shelly carefully helped him to clean the wound with the antiseptic.

“Does it hurt?” Shelly asked as she moved her hands.

“It doesn’t hurt.”

“I didn’t know you fell so badly just now,” Shelly suddenly explained.

Nox quickly said, “It’s not serious anyway.”

“If I knew you fell so badly, I wouldn’t have told you to get up and run.” In fact, it was clear that it was her cheering that made Nox, who was about to give up, get up to run again.

She felt even more guilty when she thought about how he was charging forward despite having such a serious injury.

“It’s not serious.” Nox said, “I’ve suffered more injuries in the past. Have you forgotten that I was once disabled in both legs? This minor injury is nothing. I’ll be fine in two days.”

That was right. When Nox?s legs were disabled, he was really dramatic. However , even though he was dramatic, he could still grit his teeth and endure the pain of receiving rehabilitation treatment. Otherwise, Nox would not have taken less than a year to recover to his usual self when the doctor thought he would need at least a few years to walk again.

On second thought, Nox did not seem to be without any merits. Why did she used to think that Nox was such a terrible person that even his hair was annoying?

After Shelly disinfected Nox’s wound with povidone, she put some anti-inflammatory ointment on the wound. The ointment was so cooling and tingling that Nox could not help but gasp in pain.

Nox was the kind of person who seemed to be able to endure any kind of pain but would not never hide it. Instead, his expression would become extremely exaggerated, and it was the same at this moment.

However, in the next second, he calmed down and said, “I’m fine. It just hurts a little. I heard that could distract me, and then it won’t hurt so much.”

The more Nox tried to explain himself, the more he exposed himself, and it made Shelly chuckle. Her smile was bright and sincere one that Nox had never seen before. In the past, he had always found that Shelly’s smile toward him felt a little distant.

Shelly said, “In that case, go ahead. I’ll try to be gentle.”

Nox stopped yelping as he felt he had made a fool of himself.

After a while, Shelly applied an even layer of ointment on Nox’s knee before bandaging it with gauze. She was afraid that Nox would accidentally rub his wound when he slept. After all, Nox was not a good sleeper. Sometimes, he would almost push her out of the bed.

Nox liked to push her. If she gave way a little, he would push her a little more, and it was a vicious cycle. However, when she was at the edge of the bed, she would stop moving for him, and Nox would know his place..
