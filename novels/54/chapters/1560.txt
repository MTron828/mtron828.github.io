Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The standstill traffic on the highway lasted for half an hour, and finally, they were able to pass through again.

At that time, Monica had eaten something, so her stomach felt much better. Otherwise, she was afraid she would have caused a big scene.

After they got off the highway, they drove for about an hour before they arrived at a scenic location, a very famous historical site in Casterbridge. The first thing they did was to check into the best hotel in the area and have a meal.

When they checked in, Monica and Finn booked two rooms and were still placed a little far away from each other. After checking in, everyone went to the best restaurant to eat.

The person in charge still looked guilty. According to the schedule, they should have had lunch at 12 p.m. when they arrived. However, he did not expect that, because of the traffic congestion, it was almost 2 p.m. when they had lunch.

“It’s all understandable. No one would have expected a car accident to happen.”

“It’s mainly because you’re pregnant, Director Cardellini. I was afraid that you and the baby in your stomach would starve.” The person in charge blamed himself.

“It’s alright. I’ve eaten some bread along the way, so I’m not that hungry,” Monica said.

“It’s all thanks to Mr. Jones’ attentiveness. We didn’t think so far ahead at that time. Ms. Hansen, you have to learn from Mr. Jones in the future,” the person in charge instructed.

“Yes, Sir,” Wendy said respectfully.

After lunch, Monica said, “Let’s not plan anything for this afternoon for now. I’m a little sleepy, so I need to rest for a while. I’ll go sightseeing tomorrow.”

“Yes, yes. We can have dinner together tonight.”

“Alright.” Monica nodded.

“By the way, Director Cardellini, the temperature difference between day and night here is drastic. When you go out tonight, remember to put on more layers so as not to catch a cold.”

“Alright.”

“Well, I won’t disturb Director Cardellini’s rest,” the person in charge said politely.

Monica also replied politely before going back to the room with Brandon and Finn.

Monica was feeling really sleepy, and last night… she could not fall asleep. Hence, after sitting in the car for the entire morning and having lunch, she was exhausted.

Just as she was about to fall asleep, there was a Imock on the door. She frowned. She hated it when people came to disturb her just as she was dozing

off.

Nevertheless, she got up from the bed and opened the door to see Finn standing outside. In fact, she had guessed that it was him.

She said, “Are you looking for me?”

“I’ve come over to sleep with you,” Finn said like it was a matter of fact.

“Don’t you have your own room?”

“I’ve checked out,” Finn said

Monica rolled her eyes. ‘Whose fault is it that you’ve checked out?’

However, the current Monica was different from the Monica of the past in the sense that the current Monica would not throw a tantrum.

She turned around and walked into the room, not wanting to waste more time with Finn because she was extremely sleepy. Seeing Monica compromise, Finn hurriedly walked into Chi Mumu’s room and closed the door behind him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Monica returned to her bed and fell asleep very quickly. Meanwhile, Finn tidied up the room briefly before lying down beside Monica.

Last night, she had suddenly distanced herself from him.

Finn stretched out his arm and pulled Monica into his embrace, causing Monica to twist her body uncomfortably.

Just as Finn thought that Monica would push him away, he felt her cheek pressing tightly against his chest. Then, she fell asleep peacefully,

Finn could feel his entire body stiffen. Was Monica’s guard down because she was asleep? Was that why she was so dependent on him?

He hugged her back and went to sleep. In fact, not only Monica did not sleep well last night, but he did not too. With that, he fell asleep, and they slept for the entire afternoon.

At 6 p.m., Finn’s phone rang and woke the two of them up from their sleep

Finn quickly picked up the phone and answered the call. After a while, he spoke in his clearest voice, “Ms. Hansen.”

Monica was still lying in Finn’s arms, with her head resting on his chest. However, her expression had darkened.

“Do you think 6:30 p.m. is okay?” the other party asked.

She did not realize that Finn had just woken up.

Finn looked at the time and said, “7 p.m. is better. We ate lunch late, so if we had dinner too early, I’m afraid no one would have any appetite. 7 p.m. is more suitable.”

“In that case, can you confirm the time with Director Cardellini? If 7:00 p.m. is fine, we’ll arrange it for that time..”
