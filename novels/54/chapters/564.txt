Chapter 565: Uproar About the Layoffs, Jeanne Against Lawrence Enterprise’s Senior Management

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

That also meant that Jeanne did not have to be under Alexander’s control when it came to performing the employee transfer.

At that moment, Alexander’s expression was ugly.

Jonathan’s actions were obviously humiliating him.

In private, Jonathan had explained to him why he did it — that his goal was to make use of Jeanne’s skills to grow Lawrence Enterprise. In other words, he was just using Jeanne. However, to Alexander, it came across that Jonathan was questioning his ability.

Although Alexander said he agreed with Jonathan, anger had long been brewing inside him.

Seeing Jeanne sitting proudly beside him now, he felt a little indignant.

Jeanne did not care about Alexander either as she said firmly, “I’ve gathered everyone for an emergency meeting today to confirm the name list for the employee transfer. This matter has been on hold for more than a month, and all of you senior managers should have taken up your new positions long ago. We won’t say much about what happened, but of course, it’s nobody’s fault. After all, there were some problems with the e-commerce project, so it’s only natural that this was delayed.”

Jeanne was giving all in the senior management a way out.

She continued, “Today, with the chairman’s approval, I’ve rearranged and confirmed everyone’s positions.”

Jeanne made it very clear that the list was approved by the chairman. In that case, there was no room for discussion.

The senior management was a little unhappy, but in the end, they kept their mouth shut and waited to hear the arrangements.

They did not think it was a big deal anyway. If anything, they were just switching to a new position.

Jeanne held the list and began to announce, “Mr. Stone, you’ll be removed from the position of general affairs director and appointed as the logistics director. Mr. Hoffman, you’ll be removed from the position of finance director and appointed as Harken’s branch manager. Mr. Weston...” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jeanne went on for a long time.

Out of the 20 senior managers of the Lawrence Enterprise, 12 people’s positions had been switched, and eight did not have their names read.

Those whose names were not read aloud kept quiet, while those whose names were called out began to attack Jeanne frantically.

Winston Stone held it in for a long time. However, once Jeanne finished speaking, he questioned her loudly, “You want me demoted to the logistics department? Jeanne, what right do you have to do this? I hold the original shares of the Lawrence Enterprise. What right do you have to transfer me out of my position? This is simply a joke!”

“You didn’t discuss it with me. What right do you have to make me go to send me to the branch office?” Bryce Hoffman, who was in cahoots with Winston, also started to get angry. “What right do you have to transfer me? The employee transfer we talked about previously kept us in the same position. You’re clearly demoting us by doing this. Why?”

“Although my position remains the same, I also feel sorry for the other directors,” Michelle Williams interjected. “I don’t agree with the employee transfer this time. If you said you wanted to transfer the people under us, with the Lawrences’ authority in the company, we’ll let it slide. However, don’t you think you’re taking it too far by making changes to our positions?!”

“Madam Williams.” Jeanne turned to her.

Michelle looked gallant. “If you don’t like me, you can demote me as well. Let alone demote me, you can even lay me off. Anyway, I don’t agree with your way of doing things. You’re simply too self-righteous.”

Michelle thought she was capable, and since she did not have her own name, Lawrence Enterprise would not survive without her.

In fact, Lawrence Enterprise had been going downhill all these years.

If it were not for them supporting Lawrence Enterprise, the company would have fallen long ago with just Alexander leading.

It was the same in the past.

That was why Jonathan wanted to make changes to the senior management, but he did not dare to as he was afraid that Alexander could not lead the company.

Jeanne saw through Michelle’s thoughts. She said, “Since Madam Williams wants to resign, go ahead.”

Thinking that she heard wrongly, Michelle looked straight at Jeanne. “What did you say? You want me to resign?”

“Didn’t you say it just now?” Jeanne raised her eyebrows.

“You!” Michelle was rendered speechless. However, she said fiercely, “Jeanne, do you really want everyone to go against Lawrence Enterprise?”

“I just want to make Lawrence Enterprise better. Everyone here has indeed done a lot for Lawrence Enterprise, but things change, and some positions require more professional people–”

“You’re mocking us!” Winston was furious.

“I’m just stating a fact.”

“Jeanne–”

“I just told everyone about the change in position. Now, I’m announcing the list of people we’re laying off.” Jeanne enunciated each word.

As soon as she said that, the senior management, who were arguing, looked at Jeanne in surprise.

Jeanne, on the other hand, was very calm as she announced the names of the remaining eight senior managers, including Michelle.

Michelle’s entire face turned green, and she shouted at Jeanne, “What did you say? You want to lay me off?”

“Isn’t that your wish?”

“Jeanne, I’ve worked at Lawrence Enterprise for 20 years, and now you want to lay me off? Y-Y-You... I’ll definitely sue you in court. I’ll sue the Lawrence Enterprise and make the company lose everything!”

Jeanne laughed light-heartedly and said, “You can try.”

As she said that, her imposing presence filled the room.
