Chapter 505: Patsy’s Visit, and Monica’s Seduction!

Translation

She walked along the corridor aimlessly and kept looking at her phone, counting the minutes and seconds.

Anyway, she would be back in 10 minutes. Then, she would chase Patsy away.

While thinking about that, she thought she saw a familiar figure in the corridor.

She stared at the person for a long time only to realize that it was Michael standing not far away from her. He was looking at her too.

Monica bit her lip.

It had been more than a week since they talked about breaking up. In that one week, she had been with Finn all day and night. She had forgotten about Michael completely.

It was true. She had not even thought of him once.

Now that she saw him, her heart suddenly ached like she had been deeply hurt, and she felt guilty for having let go of their relationship in such a short time.

She just looked at Michael, who was looking at her the same way.

Slowly, Michael walked toward her and stopped in front of her.

He asked, “Is your ankle better?”

“It’s much better,” Monica quickly replied.

......

“I see you’re in good spirits.” Michael was very natural with her.

Monica nodded. “The doctor also said I’m recovering very well.”

“When can you be discharged?”

“It’ll be a while. Finn’s injuries are more serious, so I’ll wait for him to be discharged,” Monica said without withholding anything.

In fact, Michael knew Monica was just reminding him that she was now together with Finn.

He smiled. “Is Finn recovering well?”

Monica was stunned as she did not expect Michael to take the initiative to ask about Finn. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She said, “He’s fine. The doctor said Finn is also recovering well, and he’ll be discharged in about a week.”

“Okay.” Michael nodded.

He still wore a smile on his face, hiding his cruelty. Nobody would have made out the anger in his eyes when Monica mentioned Finn.

“By the way, why are you here in the hospital?” Monica asked.

“My dad’s condition is pretty serious,” Michael answered.

Shocked, she looked at Michael and did not know what to say.

“The doctor said he’d probably pass on in the next two days.”

Monica nodded silently.

“I...” Michael seemed to want to say something but hesitated.

Monica looked at how perplexed he was. Still, he managed to say it in the end.

He said, “My dad wants to see you.”

The rejection in Monica’s eyes betrayed her, and Michael, of course, saw it all.

However, he pretended not to see anything as he said, “I told my dad we were back together then, and since he thinks we’re back together, he wants to see you. If you’re alright with it... Don’t worry. My dad won’t make things difficult for you. He just wants to apologize for what he did to you in the past.”

Monica kept silent.

In fact, an adult’s silence meant... refusal.

Michael seemed to understand it, so he said, “It’s okay. If you’re not okay with it, forget it. I was just asking.”

Deep down, Monica still felt a little horrible and sorry for breaking up with Michael because she felt she owed the man a lot.

She felt that…

She looked at Michael, knowing he was in a lot of pain, yet he still acted very calmly in front of her. He said, “In that case, you have a good rest. I’ll be leaving now.”

Monica bit her lips as she watched Michael turn around and leave.

His silhouette looked very lonely. It was as if the entire world had forgotten him.

In the end, the pain and guilt she felt made her open her mouth. However, little did she know that that one compromise would lead to so much sorrow.

She called out to him, “Michael.”

Michael’s body suddenly stiffened for a second.

He looked like he wanted to be cared for but also like he was afraid it was all his wishful thinking.

Monica said, “Roughly when?”

Michael turned around and looked at him in confusion.

“Roughly when should I go and see your father?”

Michael’s eyes reddened, and Monica saw it.

At that moment, the guilt in her heart deepened.

Even if they could no longer be lovers, they could still be friends, and she thought it was reasonable for friends to do whatever in their power to help.

“Today or tomorrow,” Michael said. He was a little excited, but he tried his best to hide it. “My dad may not be able to hold on for long. This is probably his last wish.”
