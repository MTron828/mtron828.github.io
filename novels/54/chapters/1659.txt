Chapter 1660: Shelly’s Smart Response

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Okay.” Bella nodded.

Then, she quickly left, probably because she did not like the person in front of her. Seeing that Bella had returned to her room, Shelly went to the kitchen to make some tea.

“Don’t try to please us. To me, it’s useless no matter how well you do.” Mrs. Bacon did not appreciate Shelly’s gestures at all.

Nevertheless, Shelly still placed the tea in front of them, one cup for each of them.

Mrs. Bacon did not even look at it. “I came with Benjamin’s father today to talk about your and Benjamin’s relationship. No matter how good your relationship is, his father and I will never agree to the two of you dating.”

Shelly had expected that outcome.

She said, “Benjamin and I are truly in love. Even if our relationship is to end, Benjamin will be the one to tell me, not you guys. This is the least I expect from Benjamin and our relationship.”

“Don’t beat around the bush. When it comes to a relationship, the parents will definitely be involved. Since his father and I don’t accept you, your relationship with him will end here!”

“In that case, I need Benjamin to tell me personally.” Shelly was very determined. “Otherwise, I won’t end our relationship!”

“Shelly, how shameless are you? Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Do you think you’re worthy of Benjamin? Why? Do you think you are worthy because you’re good-looking?” Mrs. Bacon suddenly flew into a rage and mocked Shelly.

Shelly endured it and said, “Benjamin and I never got together based on looks. If he cared about looks, he wouldn’t have taken a fancy to me.”

After all, Benjamin knew how ugly she used to look.

“I don’t care why the two of you are together. Just break up immediately! Our family will never accept a woman with a child into our family.” Mrs. Bacon kept her stance.

Shelly, on the other hand, kept her cool. “Bella is not my biological daughter. She’s my sister’s child. Due to some unique situation in our family, I’m the one raising Bella…”

“Only Benjamin would be deceived by such a lie!” Mrs. Bacon did not believe her. “Who would believe that you dropped out of school for a child that isn’t your own? Shelly, just based on this, I can see what kind of person you are! It makes you less worthy of being with Benjamin!”

Shelly was also embarrassed by Mrs. Bacon’s words, but she tried hard to control her emotions. “We can do a paternity test.”

“I don’t want to talk to you anymore. Anyway, I won’t agree to your relationship with Benjamin!” Mrs. Bacon did not seem to want to waste her breath on Shelly. “I have 2000 dollars here!”

As she spoke, she placed a bank card in front of Shelly, whose eyes flickered.

“Take the money and leave my son!” Mrs. Bacon said bluntly.

Shelly pursed her lips. Not to mention how little 2000 dollars was, that kind of behavior was simply insulting. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She said, “Auntie, I respect you because you’re Benjamin’s mother. However, respecL goes DOLII ways. Ylease nave sorne sell-respecu?

“Are you telling me to have some self-respect? Why didn’t you have some self-respect when you seduced my son? You vixen, do you know how much you’ve affected my son’s future?!” Mrs. Bacon was furious.

Shelly looked at her and said firmly, “Auntie, whether Benjamin and I break up or not is between us. I won’t break up with him just because you said so. Our relationship can’t be broken up just like that. Unless Benjamin comes to tell me personally, I won’t break up with him.” “Slap!” Mrs. Bacon slapped Shelly’s face.

Shelly’s eyes narrowed.

Mrs. Bacon pointed her finger at Shelly and scolded, “You vixen! You shameless vixen!”

“Since you don’t want to talk nicely, let’s not talk.” Shelly stood up and sent them off. “You don’t have to come to me anymore. My relationship with Benjamin is between me and him. I won’t be affected by anyone.” “Y-Y-You…” Mrs. Bacon was so angry that she could not speak.

“This is my home. Please leave.”

“Shelly, how dare you treat me like this!” Mrs. Bacon gritted her teeth.

“I’ll naturally treat you the way you treat me!” Shelly said coldly..
