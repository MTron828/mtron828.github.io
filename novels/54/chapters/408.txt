Chapter 409: Fourth Master Swan Bullies George

Ahem. She did not volunteer to marry him.

Although now, she was not against it. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

She said, “Kingsley told me to marry him.”

She did not know when it started, but her ability to shift the blame was also top-notch.

However, she was not lying. The truth was that she was forced into a helpless situation.

George was a little speechless.

“Don’t worry. We will leave one day,” Jeanne promised.

She believed that after she completed her mission, she could still take George with her.

It did not cross her mind that many things would happen in the future, even though her future was uncertain.

“Will you give Fourth Master Swan another child?” George was very bothered by that matter.

“Are you against it?”

“Yes.” George nodded.

“Why?”

......

“I heard the eldest child will be abandoned after the second child comes.”

Who said that?

Jeanne was very angry.

Was Angeburg not the top international school for aristocrats? Was that what the teachers in Angerburg taught the children?

“Kingsley.” George enunciated each word clearly.

Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Kingsley should be nicknamed trouble because chaos followed everywhere he went!

“That was why Kingsley told me to look after you so that you don’t give Fourth Master Swan another child.” George was very serious.

After that, he suddenly felt that something was wrong with his statement.

Kingsley had told him that on the phone, so he repeated the same words exactly.

Jeanne did not notice what was wrong with what George said, but she said, “I won’t give Edward a child. However, I have to tell you — don’t listen to Kingsley’s nonsense. Every child is precious to a parent. Even if I give birth to a second child, my love for you will not fade.”

“So you still want another child?” George looked at her.

“No,” Jeanne replied. “I’m just saying that even if I do...”

“Why do you want another child?”

Well, alright. She was wrong.

Her son’s logical ability was amazing, and she could not win against him.

“I don’t want any, and that’s it,” Jeanne gave an affirmative reply.

At that moment, George seemed to be in a better mood.

“George.” The corners of Jeanne’s mouth suddenly curled up into a smile.

George was a little frightened by Jeanne’s expression.

“Do you love me that much? So much so that you’re afraid of sharing me with others?”

“No.” George denied it immediately.

Jeanne frowned.

At that moment, she had to admit that Edward was right.

George could be a little more down-to-earth.

“My father’s dead, and if I don’t have my mom, I’ll really become an orphan,” George said with a serious expression.

His father was dead…

Jeanne suddenly did not know how to reply to George even though she was the one who told him that his father was long dead.

She took a deep breath and patted George’s head. “Don’t worry. I definitely won’t leave you behind.”

“Of course not,” George retorted. “That was why you left me behind and went overseas with Fourth Master Swan.”

Jeanne was left speechless.

“Forget it. I don’t care anymore. I know it was Fourth Master Swan who forced you.”

“Yes, it was him,” Jeanne insisted.

She must not affect their mother-son relationship, and that was why she had to catch a scapegoat.

“Next time, if you’re going to leave, please let me know,” George did not forget to remind her. “Otherwise, I’ll be very embarrassed.”

Would he be embarrassed or disappointed?

“During the sports day, godmother was so dramatic that I became the focus of the entire school.” George’s face was a little red, probably because he recalled the scene at the sports day.

Jeanne could, in fact, picture how excited Monica was that day. After all, Monica loved to have fun.

What surprised her was that Monica had never participated in any sports events, yet she participated in the relay race for George. Jeanne even heard that she had fractured her ankle.

“But.” It seemed like George had something he wanted to say, but he could not say it out loud.

Jeanne knew what George wanted to say at a glance, so she said, “Do you think that although your godmother is loud and carefree, she can move others very easily?”

George widened his eyes and then nodded slowly.

“That’s why godmother and I are such good friends,” Jeanne said. “George, you can make some friends too. Some true friends.”

George shook his head.

He did not like to make friends with others.

“But regarding things like that, you should let nature take its course. If you make friends with a purpose, you won’t be considered a true friend.”

George seemed to understand but not really.

“You can rest for a while first while I go downstairs and give your godmother a call. I heard she’s in the hospital.”
