1163 The War Has Started: Igniting the War

“Father, there’s no need to blame yourself. I understand. Everyone is equal in front of the law,” Edward hurriedly praised.

“It’s good that you understand,” Warren said heavily. “I hope that our family can be happy together.”

“Definitely,” Edward and the others agreed.

It was very lively during the meal.

“Brother.” Justin took the initiative to raise his glass. ” Let me toast you. No matter what, this matter was my fault.”

Edward picked up his wine glass. “Don’t be so polite. We’re family.”

“Alright.” Justin downed his glass, and Edward did the same.

The others were also toasting each other.

The meal went on for a long time.

“Jeannie, come and have a drink with your dad,” Warren suddenly said.

Everyone addressed Warren as their father. It was a symbol of status.

However, at this moment, he took the initiative to address Jeanne affectionately as ‘dad’. It was obvious that Warren treated Jeanne differently.

On the surface, no one showed any emotion. In reality, Quinn and Stacey, who were both his daughters, started to feel jealous.

Chester was not only jealous, but he also began to hold a grudge against her. Throughout the entire meal, he could clearly see that Jeanne seemed to be closer to Justin than the rest of them.

“Father, I can only drink tea at the moment.” Jeanne looked shy.

“What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” Warren asked with concern.

“I’m pregnant,” Jeanne announced.

The others turned to look at her. No one seemed to believe it.

Justin quickly chimed in. “There was a media report today stating that Jeanne was pregnant. I thought it was just the media taking it out of context. I didn’t expect her to really be pregnant!”

“Well, I really am pregnant. It’s been three months.” Jeanne smiled.

“What good news!” Warren quickly clapped his hands and cheered. “It’s amazing news to have a child in the family! Come, come, everyone. Let’s raise our glasses to celebrate. Jeannie, you can just have some tea.”

“Okay.” Jeanne smiled.

The others raised their glasses as well and congratulated one another. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Edward accompanied Jeanne as she accepted everyone’s well wishes.

“Fourth Master.” At this moment, William also raised his cup. “To you. Congratulations.”

Edward stared at William before the two raised their glasses.

William said, “Stacey and I are also making plans. When the time comes, I hope you’ll share some of your experience with us.”

“Some things are just up to fate. The more you try, the harder it is to get,” Edward replied perfunctorily.

“That’s true.” William approved.

The two finished the wine in their glasses.

William said, “I heard it’s especially easy to get pregnant if you have a good relationship.”

“Jeanne and Edward have such good chemistry together. No wonder they have a second child so soon,” Justin interrupted. “You and Stacey have a great relationship, too, though. I believe you’ll have good news soon.”

“I’ll count on your blessings, then.” William appeared to be very happy and drank a few more cups with Justin.

The atmosphere at the dinner table was very good. After the meal, Warren seemed to be in a good mood. He even asked everyone to stay and have some tea.

In the tea room, Warren and Chester played chess while the others watched from the side. They looked like an ordinary family with some daily entertainment.

“Let’s go out for a smoke,” William suddenly called out to Edward.

Edward nodded and informed Jeanne before leaving with William.

Jeanne turned to look at them before continuing to watch Warren play chess.

Outside the teahouse, William handed Edward a cigarette.

Edward accepted it, and the two started smoking. They did not speak much, and only white mist lingered between them.

“Why did you follow Jeanne here?” William asked him directly.

Edward took a deep puff of his cigarette and said, “I had no choice.”

“Who forced you?”

“Jeanne.”

“Edward, you disappoint me.” William’s face darkened.

“I also have people I need to protect too.” Edward faced him. “You’re not the only one.”

“Is that the answer you’re giving me?”

“As long as you trust me enough, you can continue to do what you need to do,” Edward said bluntly. “My relationship with Jeanne will not affect you in any way.”

William looked at him coldly.

“There’s no conflict between me protecting Jeanne and not betraying you.” Edward made it very clear.
