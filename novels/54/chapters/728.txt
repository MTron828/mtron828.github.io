Chapter 729: Warmth: Do You Know Why We Raise Pigs?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

George believed that he was an accident.

Anyway, from the beginning to the end, Fourth Master Swan only had eyes for his mother.

As for his mother, sooner or later, she would be kidnapped by Fourth Master Swan.

After dinner, the family of three sat on the sofa in the living room and watched TV.

Edward and Jeanne sat together, with Edward hugging Jeanne in his arms. The two of them were very intimate.

Meanwhile, because George was angry, he sat alone in a corner of the sofa, deliberately keeping a distance from them.

Jeanne felt a little helpless about it, but she could not push Edward away. Hence, all she could do was let her son sit in the corner.

She felt that Edward deliberately went against George sometimes to make George feel that she belonged to Edward, and it would make George very unhappy.

Some comedy-type variety show was playing on TV.

Jeanne had not watched TV for a long time, so watching TV felt strange to her. However, she did not expect Edward to be so engrossed in TV shows.

He would laugh at the funny segments and ask to fast-forward past the boring segments.

She used to think Fourth Master Swan was out of touch with the ordinary world. However, after they got together, she realized that the man had quite the common touch.

For example, when he deliberately angered George, she even thought he was still quite childish.

The family of three watched TV until 9 p.m. when Jeanne asked George, “Do you want to go to bed now?”

“No.” Still seething with anger, George refused immediately.

“If you don’t want to sleep, your mother and I will go to sleep,” Edward said.

George’s face turned red with anger.

Edward stood up from the sofa and pulled Jeanne along. “Let’s go to bed.”

Could she voice out and say that she was instinctively afraid of the man saying the word “sleep”?

Edward seemed to be able to read Jeanne’s mind, and a smile stretched across his face.

“I didn’t expect you’d look forward to it, Jeannie”

Was he blind? Did she look like she looked forward to it?

The corners of his mouth curled into a pensive smile, and then he dragged Jeanne upstairs.

Jeanne shook Edward off, but Edward was not angry about it.

Jeanne turned around and walked toward George. “I will accompany you back to your room.”

George was fuming today. He was angry at Fourth Master Swan and at his mother.

He took a glance at his mother and harrumphed before his short legs scuttled up the stairs on their own.

Jeanne was a little frustrated. George had never thrown a tantrum at her ever since he was young.

Therefore, she glared at Edward. It was all his fault.

Edward, on the contrary, pretended to be innocent and had a clueless look on his face. He also had a bright smile on his face as he did not care about how unhappy George was.

Jeanne ignored Edward and went upstairs.

Jeanne did not go directly to their room. Instead, she wanted to go to George’s room.

She felt that she needed to have a good talk with her son because if that continued, George’s state of mind would have a mental breakdown soon.

However, just as she was about to go, Edward pulled her back.

Before Jeanne could throw a fit, Edward said, “I’ll go.”

Jeanne was stunned.

“I was the one who started it.” Edward smiled. “That’s why I’ll go.”

“You purposely pissed George off, didn’t you?”Jeanne gritted her teeth.

Did he not treat George as his own because he did not grow up by his side?

“No, I just want him to understand that his mother belongs to me,” Edward said.

It was clear that he was trying to twist his words so that it sounded like it was a matter of course.

Just as Jeanne was about to retort, Edward suddenly sealed her mouth with his. “Mm.”

Then, he unscrupulously pushed her against the wall of the corridor, hugging and kissing her.

Was he not bored of it?

He would get horny all the time! He was simply a beast.

Jeanne was panting from Edward’s kiss.

Edward looked at her breathless and blushing, and the smile on the corner of his mouth widened.

He whispered in her ear, “Wait for me.”

‘Wait for you, my *ss!’ Jeanne thought.

Edward took a deep breath as if he was trying very hard to relax his mind and body. Then, he walked toward George’s room.

Jeanne looked at Edward’s back and hesitated. In the end, she did not stop Edward from going to look for George alone.

She had a feeling that the matter between father and son should be resolved themselves.

…

At the entrance to George’s room, Edward knocked on the door.

George opened the door angrily.

He thought it was his mother, but it turned out to be Fourth Master Swan.

The moment he saw Fourth Master Swan, he became furious, and the change in his expression was visible.
