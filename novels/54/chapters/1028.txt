1029 The Rise of Monica

“I’ll tell you my next plan.” Monica only nodded her head in response to Steve’s worry, appearing very calm.

It was as if bankruptcy was not important, and she would just do her own thing.

She said, “Within three days, the researchers will be able to pay the compensation for the breach of contract, and Cardellini Enterprise will accept their resignation. After they resign, Mr. Chance will help me to draft a lawsuit to the court of South Hampton City and sue all the researchers and Sunny Pharmaceutical for disclosing core secrets! It might not be successful in the end, but at least Sunny Pharmaceutical wouldn’t dare to hire this group of people again!”

Steve simply could not believe that Monica would think of that!

He could even imagine how angry Sunny Pharmaceutical would be! It would be a double loss!

Monica continued, “We have 13.5 million dollars in assets coming in, so we’ll use this money to distribute the medicine. In other words, we’ll provide the medicine to hospitals and pharmaceutical companies for free and settle the bill after the sales. Even during the promotion period, the purchase price will be 20 percent off!”

“We won’t have much profit after the 20 percent discount.”

“Let’s offer that amount first.” Monica was very determined. “We need to get back some of our money. Our finished products have used up too much capital. If we don’t sell them, we won’t have any cash flow!”

“Alright!” Steve did not say anything else.

He realized that Monica had already considered everything thoroughly and was not spouting nonsense.

“Based on the current situation, the distribution of goods may not be effective. Mr. Warren, draw up a list of the top distributors we want to talk to and give it to me. I don’t need too many. Just the five biggest ones will do, and I’ll visit them one by one.”

“You’ll negotiate personally?” Steve asked.

“You don’t trust me?” Monica smiled.

“No, I’m just afraid that you’ll suffer.” No matter how much people advocated for gender equality now, women were more likely to be at a disadvantage in many situations.

“What’s there to be afraid of now? If we can negotiate a deal, I’m willing to die for it!” Monica said jokingly.

In fact, it was very tragic.

“I believe Cardellini Enterprise can survive this!” Steve didn’t know what to say, so he could only encourage her!

“It’s settled then. We’ll start tomorrow. Are there any problems?” Monica was not sad.

“No, I’ll arrange it immediately.”

“Mr. Warren.” Monica called out to him, “Can we hold a staff meeting?”

“Now?”

“As soon as possible.”

“At this time… I don’t think the staff will listen to you.”

“I’m not trying to make them listen to me. I just want to tell them the truth.”

“Could it be…” Steve looked at Monica and hesitated.

No one would tell their employees about the company’s current crisis as it would only cause panic.

“It’s nothing. No matter how serious the matter is, it’s just bankruptcy. I’m prepared.”

In the end, Steve agreed to Monica’s firm decision.

After two hours, the meeting of more than a thousand people at Cardellini Pharmaceutical’s headquarters was held in the company’s conference room.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Monica walked into the conference room filled with a thousand people!

She glanced down and said, “We’ve gathered everyone here at this emergency meeting today to let everyone know that the Cardellini Enterprise is facing a lot of difficulties now. All the problems you heard about Cardellini Enterprise are true, and they are even more serious than you think!”

As soon as she said that, there was an uproar!

Steve, who was at the side, could not help but break out in a cold sweat!

Monica was really the most daring leader he had ever seen, and no one could compare to her!

“Now, many employees have already lost confidence in Cardellini Enterprise.” Monica said, “I’ve also lost my confidence, so I won’t force everyone to stay. If everyone wants to leave, the human resources department will accept your resignation letters.”

“Monica, what do you mean? Are you driving us away? We’ve been working in Cardellini Enterprise for so many years. Who are you to tell us to leave?” Not able to take it anymore, an old employee questioned loudly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“In that case, why does Cardellini Enterprise have to keep a bunch of idlers!” Monica’s expression turned cold.

“Who are you calling idlers?”

“I’m talking about you and everyone here who started neglecting their work when they heard that Cardellini Enterprise was facing a crisis! If you don’t trust Cardellini Enterprise, you can leave immediately!”

“Monica, what gives you the right to be so domineering? As a company, instead of providing your employees with peace and stability, you’re now threatening us? Don’t you think you simply don’t have the bearing that a leader should have?”

“I’m telling you about Cardellini Enterprise’s situation now, and that is my responsibility to you! If you’re willing to stay, stay and work hard. I won’t mistreat any of you! However, if you think that Cardellini Enterprise has no chance of reviving, I don’t need you to waste your time here.”

“You don’t even give us any confidence. What right do you have to ask us to believe in Cardellini Enterprise?” The person leading the pack sounded very agitated.

“I came to work here today with the determination that Cardellini Enterprise will go bankrupt. What confidence can I give you?” Monica said bluntly.

At the side, Steve gave up. They were bound to be doomed anyway.

He felt that Monica was not here to make peace but to undermine them.

No wonder she did not care whether the employees believed her or not. On the contrary, those employees were eager for Monica to say something to convince them.

“Monica, you said that Cardellini Enterprise is going bankrupt, but you also said that you would not mistreat us if we stayed. Aren’t you trying to harm us?!” The leader was furious.

“I said, if Cardellini Enterprise doesn’t go bankrupt, I will not mistreat you! But if Cardellini Enterprise goes bankrupt, I can’t even protect myself.” Monica said, “I’m giving you a choice now. You can choose to fight like me and have no regrets, or you can choose to leave. It’s up to you. Of course, if you leave now, once Cardellini Enterprise makes a comeback, those who leave can forget about coming back!”

“You’re threatening us!”

“If we want to share benefits, we must also share hardships!” Monica said firmly.

After saying that, she turned around and was about to leave.

“Monica, do you really think I don’t dare to resign?”

Monica paused in her steps.

“I want to resign now!”

“Alright, sure. The human resources department will follow Cardellini Enterprise’s rules and handle the resignation procedure in a simple manner!”

“Y-Y-You ... Do you know who I am?” The leader probably did not expect Monica to be so straightforward.

“It doesn’t matter who. If you want to leave, leave!” Monica was not threatened at all.

The leader was so angry that his face turned red.

He gritted his teeth and deliberately jeered, “Since Monica has said so, I suggest that everyone leave! We won’t be threatened by her!”

“Okay.” Some people started to agree. In fact, many people started to agree.

The conference room was in chaos.

In the chairman’s office, Steve received the news and reported, “The human resources department has received a list of 20 resignations.”

“All of them have been processed.”

“Some of them are really talented.”

“It’s fine.”

“Ms. Car– Chairman, this will demoralize people.”

“No one can be forced, and I don’t want to force anyone to stay,” Monica said bluntly.

Steve still wanted to say something, but Monica interrupted him, “Gather the shareholders for a board meeting.”

What was Monica up to this time?

Steve felt like he was too old to work with young people!
