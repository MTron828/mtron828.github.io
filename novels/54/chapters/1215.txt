1216 Edward Has Done His Best, He Had No Choice

Alex was unmoved by Jeanne’s mockery. Instead, he said, “Edward has agreed.”

Jeanne looked at him.

“You didn’t hear wrong. He agreed,” Alex said again.

Jeanne laughed. “Since he agreed, why did you come to tell me yourself? So that I can get along peacefully with her?”

“Well, I wouldn’t take it that far. Before you leave, she can’t possibly live with you.”

“So, you’re sending me away? Or are you just going to kill me?”

Alex said, “I did think of killing you directly.”

Jeanne clenched her fists tightly.

“But Edward told me to wait for you to deliver his daughter,” Alex said, enunciating each word. “In other words, your value will end the moment you give birth to your daughter.”

“Edward knows that?” Jeanne asked.

“This is the longest he can fight for you. You shouldn’t blame him.”

“Is that so?” Jeanne sneered.

Alex meant that he was allowing her to live a little longer, so she should be grateful.

“You should’ve known the moment Edward saved you that you wouldn’t live for long! Back then, I didn’t kill you not because I was threatened by Edward, but because I wanted Edward to recognize the reality of things. Even if it’s a woman he protected with his life, I’ll kill her sooner or later.”

Jeanne looked at Alex, the man who really had no feelings, coldly.

“Jeanne, I’ve said it before. I can keep you as long as you have no relationship with the Sanders, but unfortunately, you do. Be it Warren or Chester, they’re my old enemies as long as they bear the name ‘Sanders’. I can only make a comeback because the Sanders didn’t kill me back then, but I won’t repeat the same mistakes.” Alex said coldly, “Of course, don’t worry. I won’t touch George and the daughter in your belly.”

Jeanne’s eyes were cold.

“As long as you die, they will only be Edward’s children and have nothing to do with the Sanders.” Alex made it clear. “But if you’re not dead, they’ll be related to the Sanders, and I can’t guarantee that I won’t do something to them at the spur of the moment.”

“You’re really… cruel.”

“You don’t have the experience of rebuilding your family’s great cause after they were killed, so you don’t have the right to call me cruel. Of course, even if it’s cruel, it’s to stop all cruel things from happening in the future.” Alex enunciated each word clearly. “Edward understands this principle.”

“So, he chose to let me die, ending all the Duncans’ worries.”

“Edward has been extremely kind to you. He tried to save you, but his ability is limited! Furthermore, Edward has no choice but to use you to save hundreds of lives.”

Jeanne looked at him coldly.

“I’m telling you all this so that you can prepare for your death in advance. You’re a smart person. You should know how to maximize the benefits and how to protect everyone you want to protect.” Alex looked at Jeanne. “The winner takes all, and I hope that it will end completely with you.”

After explaining everything, Alex turned around and left.

Just as he had taken two steps, he turned around and said, “Oh, right. The marriage between Edward and Susan will be announced to the public tonight. You better be mentally prepared.”

With that, he strode away.

Susan, on the other hand, stopped in her tracks and said, “This necklace suits you very well.”

Jeanne’s eyes flickered. She knew that Susan was referring to the one Edward had given her yesterday.

“I helped Edward pick it out.” Susan smiled.

Then, she strode away with Alex.

Jeanne watched them leave before she sat quietly on the sofa. On the contrary, she felt relieved at that moment. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Alex was right. From the moment Edward saved her, she knew that she would die sooner or later.

Edward could not protect her forever unless…

There was no ‘unless’.

…

At night, in a hall as grand as a palace, it was the first time the new Leader of Harken held a banquet.

He invited all the political officials, as well as… the most influential family businesses in the upper-class society. Among them were Swan Enterprise and Cardellini Enterprise.

In fact, even if Swan Corporation was not invited, Edward would also be there.

Everyone knew that William and Edward had a close relationship.

They had heard that William and Edward used to be business partners before they became brothers-in-law. Now that the Sanders had abdicated, William had taken over, and Edward had assisted him.

Many of the rumors about William and Edward’s relationship among the people were not exaggerated.

Monica was also present at the state banquet today.
