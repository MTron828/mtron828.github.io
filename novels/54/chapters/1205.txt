1206 Reuniting After A Long Time

“Are you going to participate?” George asked.

Last time, she abandoned George because she went overseas for a honeymoon with Edward, and Monica was the one who took her place to participate in the parent-child sports day.

She said, “I’m pregnant with your sister, aren’t I?”

“You can be my cheerleader. The teacher said it’s enough for one of the parents to participate in the sports days.” George looked at her expectantly.

George did not know that she could not leave that place. He had always thought that she was pregnant and had to stay at home.

“I’m sorry.” Jeanne smiled faintly.

A look of disappointment appeared on George’s face.

Immediately after, he said, “I don’t like sports anyway. I’ve always thought that only the unintelligent would like it.”

Jeanne touched George’s head. She had something she wanted to say, but she could only swallow them.

Instead, she said, “Teddy will go with you.”

“Alright.” George nodded obediently and did not say anything.

He did not seem interested in the sports meet.

Jeanne smiled and said gently, “Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.”

“Yes.”

With that, George went to the bathroom.

Jeanne stared at George’s back, and as she did, the smile on her face faded.

After dinner, Jeanne kept George company and only returned to her room after George went to bed.

She did not go to sleep immediately after returning to her room. She took a book on prenatal education and read it silently.

At night, at about 11 p.m., Jeanne put down her book and got ready to go to sleep when the door opened abruptly.

Edward pushed the door open and entered.

They had not seen each other for two months, and suddenly, their eyes met. For a second, Jeanne thought that she was hallucinating.

She looked at Edward, who also looked at her, wondering if two months of separation had made them a little unfamiliar with each other. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In fact, since they got married, this was the first time they had been separated for two months even though they often used to be apart and had been through a lot.

In the past, no matter what, they would have met once in the middle. Yet now, after they were finally together, they were separated for such a long time.

The air was a little awkward.

“You’re still awake?” Edward suddenly asked, breaking the awkwardness between them.

“I’m getting ready to go to sleep.” Jeanne replied, “You’re back?”

“I’ll be leaving in a while.” Edward replied, “I just happened to pass by, so I came back to get something. I also wanted to take a shower and change my clothes.”

“Oh,” Jeanne responded.

She sounded a little disappointed. She thought that he was back, not unexpecting that it would not be permanent.

“You should sleep early. I’m going to take a shower,” Edward said.

“Okay.” Jeanne nodded and watched as Edward walked into the bathroom.

It seemed like there was a distance between them, but they did not know how to… close that distance.

In the end, Jeanne could not fall asleep. Hence, she walked to the head of the bed and waited for Edward to wash up.

Edward did not take long to shower. In fact, he seemed to be in a hurry. After taking a shower, he went to the closet to change into a new set of clothes, dried her hair quickly, and was ready to leave.

“Edward,” Jeanne called out to him.

Edward was tying his tie, so Jeanne went over. She wondered why he was still dressed in a suit and leather shoes at that time of the night.

In fact, it was not hard to guess why.

Edward’s current status was different from before. He used to be a business tycoon, so even if he cared about his public image then, he did not have to be so formal. However, he was now in politics.

His every move, every word, and every action represented the entire country, which did not allow any room for error.

She walked over, reached out, and helped him with his tie.

Edward looked at her and then slowly put his hand down. He watched as Jeanne helped him with his tie.

She seemed to have become a lot rounder after not seeing her for two months. At such a close distance, her fair skin looked fragile.

It was because she was pregnant with his daughter.

Was that why she looked so good?

His throat moved slightly.

At that moment, he reached out and touched her protruding belly with his big hand.

Jeanne’s eyes flickered as she looked down at his hand and watched as his hand gently caressed her belly as if he was feeling the baby’s presence.

Suddenly, Edward’s palm moved. He could clearly feel Jeanne’s lower abdomen nudging his hand, and it was not an illusion.

It was really coming from her lower abdomen.

“Can she move?” Edward asked.

“Yes.” The baby knew how to move a long time ago.
