Chapter 344: Madam, Missus, Wifey, or Jeannie?

Upon hearing that sentence, Jenne fell silent again.

‘Have you thought it through?’

It seemed like there was more to the phrase than asking her whether she was ready to spend the night with him as his wife. To her, it felt like it was mixed with a myriad of emotions.

She did not know how to answer.

In the meantime, he watched as she remained silent and smiled. It was just a gentle smile, so she could not see through his emotions.

He communicated his needs very clearly earlier, but now she found him confusing.

Just then, she heard him say, “If you’re not, you can think it through again.”

Jeanne looked at him, who turned around and left after saying that.

He had clearly given up.

Deep down, she felt inexplicably guilty.

After all, humans were classified as high-level animals probably because they had too many emotions and desires.

She bit her lips, and at that moment, her slender little hand grabbed the corner of his shirt.

Edward’s footsteps halted before he turned around.

......

“Don’t go.”

Edward gulped.

She could see that his Adam’s apple was really bobbing up and down intensely.

“I’ve thought it through.”

Those three words rang in Edward’s ears.

That was right. She had indeed thought about being truly married to Fourth Master Swan.

However, he fell silent at her answer and looked at her quietly.

She did not know if he was suppressing his emotions, but he did not make any move or leave.

Jeanne waited for a long time, so long that it felt like forever.

Then, she took two steps forward, closing the distance between them.

The man in front of her looked at her intently. He watched as she suddenly tiptoed, hugged his neck, and said, “Fourth Master, are you afraid?”

That question sounded like she was teasing him, and the smile on the corner of her mouth was very obvious.

Under the night sky, she was really like a beautiful rose, blooming so brightly that it... aroused something in him.

The emotions in Edward’s eyes were changing and showing little by little. It proved that the man in front of her could not resist the seduction.

She thought, ‘How did he last so many years of abstinence?’

Not one bit did he look like someone who could abstain from sex. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At that moment, she heard his magnetic voice say, “My name is Edward.”

“Huh?” Jeanne frowned.

What did he mean by that? Was he delirious from being aroused?

“That is the name my parents gave me.”

While she was trying to figure out what he was trying to say, he said in his low and magnetic voice, “But you can call me Ed.”

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat.

Ed?!

Her heart began to race. Such an intimate way of addressing him made her feel... an indescribable emotion.

She stared at him and at how close his cheeks were to her. Then, she watched his lips press against hers.

She did not know if it was because he had been out in the cold for too long, but she found his lips cool before suddenly, a fire-like... madness erupted.

On the wedding night, every moment was priceless.

…

The next day, the weather was good.

The sunlight from the outside shone through the tiny gaps and onto the floor of the room. As the wind blew gently against the curtains, the light on the floor flickered.

Jeanne opened her eyes and quietly looked in the direction of the window, lost in her thoughts…

Last night, their first night as husband and wife, everything seemed to have gone according to plan, but it also felt like a dream.

Just like that, she looked out the window without moving for a long time.

Everything was peaceful until the person behind her moved a little.

‘He should be awake,’ she thought.

Last night... was very tiring.

She did, in fact, wake up a little early for some reason, but the man behind her slept very soundly.

The sun was now hung high up in the sky.

She had never thought that Fourth Master Swan was someone who would sleep in, yet he did.

Her body tensed up as she felt someone hugging her from behind. The warm embrace was very natural and intimate.

She bit her lips and could feel his head approaching her neck. Then, he whispered in his ear, “Are you awake?”

How did he know she was awake when she did not move?
