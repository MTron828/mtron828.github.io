Chapter 394: Finn Awakens, and I Want to Give Him a Child!

That silly child.

She was brave in everything she did. Regardless of whether she did well or not, or whether she did it right or wrong, she never flinched. However, she was always submissive in her feelings.

She just was not willing to admit who she really liked.

If going through that incident made her able to face her feelings bravely, it was not necessarily a bad thing either.

However, what on earth did those two people go through to be that seriously injured?

When they received the call from the police, they were terrified.

The police said a serious car accident had occurred and the two people in the car had disappeared.

At that time, the first thought that came to their mind was murder.

The driver must have been afraid that he would bear the responsibility, so he took the two people away, and then…

For a day and a night, Gary and Ruby did not sleep. They waited for news from the police until they received a call in the morning saying that Monica and Finn were in the hospital.

When the two of them rushed to the hospital, they saw Finn lying in the intensive care unit. Her injuries were very serious, but the doctor said he had woken up, so his life would not be in danger for the time being. He just needed more treatment to fully recover.

On the other hand, Monica fainted because she was too sad and mentally exhausted. The doctor said her body was full of superficial injuries and would recover quickly. However, the fracture on her ankle was quite serious and needed follow-up surgery.

Hence, they stayed with Monica the entire time.

......

After Monica woke up, they did not even have the time to ask her what happened before Monica wanted, so desperately, to see Finn.

When she saw Finn, she broke down in tears.

Her vision was blurry that it was almost impossible to see the man lying motionlessly on the other side of the window.

Therefore, she did not see that the man, whose eyes were closed before, had opened his eyes. He had opened his eyes and even turned his head to look at her.

He looked at her teary face.

Finn’s eyes moved.

In fact, he did not know how serious his injuries were. All he knew was that it was very difficult for him even to open his eyes.

At that moment, he was forcing himself to look at Monica, who was heartbroken and crying in front of him.

When he opened his eyes, she did not react and just continued to cry.

Finn frowned.

Monica was never one to follow the norm.

“Look. Finn’s awake,” Gary suddenly said.

Although Finn could not hear him from inside, Gary still called out to Finn.

When Monica heard her father’s voice, she was visibly stunned. She looked at her father and then at Finn in disbelief.

She wiped her tears away, and she could finally see everything clearly.

She saw Finn lying and looking at them in the intensive care unit.

Was she seeing things? Or was she hallucinating?

Monica could not believe what she was seeing — that Finn had really woken up.

He was no longer in a vegetative state.

Finn looked at Monica as well. He saw the shock in her eyes and how she continued to look at him without blinking as if she was confirming whether he was really awake.

In fact, there was a blank in his memory.

He could remember the recent incident where he pressed Monica to the ground and hugged her tightly in his arms.

However, everything after that was a blur. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He did not know how he and Monica escaped danger or how they were in the hospital. During that period of time, he could only hear a weak voice that kept talking in his ear, saying a lot of things.

“Finn!” Monica suddenly called out to him loudly.

At that moment, she shouted as she finally came to her senses.

In fact, Finn could not hear her, but he could see her actions and the changes in her expression.

“Finn,” Monica called out again.

The medical staff outside quickly went forward and said respectfully, “Mrs. Jones, he can’t hear you from inside.”

Monica ignored the medical staff.

She was not stupid. Of course, she knew that the intensive care unit was soundproof.

She just wanted to vent her emotions.

She just wanted to express the excitement in her.

Hence, she did not care and continued, “Finn, you won’t die, right? You won’t become a vegetable, right?”
