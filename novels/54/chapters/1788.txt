Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Bella, do you want to have some ice cream?” Benjamin suddenly said to Bella, breaking the silence in the car.

“Yes!” Bella said with her face full of smiles.

“There’s a delicious ice cream shop here. I will get down and get some for you later, okay?” Benjamin asked Bella.

“Alright.” Bella was so happy that she almost jumped with joy.

Shelly wanted to stop him, but she held herself back from saying anything. She rarely gave Bella ice cream because she did not think it was healthy. However, in fact, eating a little occasionally was alright. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, Benjamin went to buy two ice creams — one strawberry flavored for Bella and another chocolate flavored for Shelly.

Shelly looked at Benjamin. “Did you buy this for me?”

“Don’t all girls like ice cream?” Benjamin laughed.

Shelly did not know what to say, so she just accepted it. After that, Benjamin sat in the driver’s seat and drove them back.

Meanwhile, Bella was eating happily, and Shelly thought it was not bad too. It had been a long time since she had ice cream. For one, she was not a big fan of ice cream, and because she did not want Bella to have too much of it, she stopped having it. However, at that moment, she suddenly found ice cream delicious. She finished it in one go, and so did Bella.

“Is it delicious?” Benjamin asked after they finished eating and Shelly was wiping Bella’s sticky hands with a wet tissue.

Bella said excitedly, “It is. Ice cream is my favorite. It’s as delicious as fried chicken and fries.”

“Next time you want ice cream, I will bring you here again, okay?”

“Thank you, Uncle.” Bella was over the moon.

Shelly observed their interaction and looked away. She wondered, if there were no ifs, would the current scene become a reality?

When the car arrived at Nox’s upscale neighborhood, Benjamin opened the car door for them and carried Bella out of the car.

Bella hugged Benjamin’s neck and muttered, “Uncle, you promised me that he would bring Bella to eat ice cream next time.”

“I will definitely fulfill my promise—”

Before he could finish his sentence, Benjamin paused. Shelly followed Benjamin’s gaze and saw Nox who was not far away.

It was the afternoon, so why was Nox here? Should he not be lying on the sofa at home? That was how he usually spent his weekends. Occasionally, he would work overtime, but his sudden appearance at the entrance of the neighborhood really surprised her. Besides surprise, it was also a little awkward.

“Daddy!” Bella called out loudly to Nox. Probably only she was unaware of the current atmosphere.

Nox walked toward Benjamin and reached out to Bella, who immediately threw herself into Nox’s arms. However, when Nox held her, Benjamin did not let go.

Being held by both Nox and Benjamin, Bella felt rather uncomfortable. Hence, she moved her small body, and only then did Benjamin let go of Bella.

“When did you come back?” Nox asked coldly.

“More than half a month ago,” Benjamin answered.

Nox nodded. Other than that simple greeting, he carried Bella into the neighborhood without saying anything else. He did not even call out to Shelly.

Shelly stared at Nox’s back before turning to Benjamin. “Thank you. I’ll head back now.”

“Shelly.” Benjamin stopped her. “Did Nox misunderstand something?”

“He won’t.” Shelly was certain.

They were going to break up soon, so it did not matter whether it was a misunderstanding or not.

“Do you want me to explain it to him alone?”

“There’s no need.”

Before Benjamin could say more, Shelly had strode away. He watched as Shelly left anxiously and how they were walking one in front of the other. He did not think it was an illusion when he saw Shelly nervous for a second.

Was she nervous because Nox saw them coming back together? He had always thought that Shelly had no feelings for Nox. With that thought, Benjamin gulped and realized that perhaps time could really change everything.

As Shelly followed Nox back to the house, Nox did not lose his temper, and his expression was the same as usual. However, for some reason, she felt that Nox was angry.

She said, “Benjamin and I happened to be leaving at the same time. I brought Bella back after lunch because she wanted to take a nap, and Benjamin happened to be passing by this area..”
