Chapter 1448: Stirring Up Trouble

In the bathroom, Candice’s calm voice stunned George. He had always thought that his father had forgotten about his mother.

It had been so long since his mother passed away, and he had never heard his father talk about his mother again. His father had been living a good life all these years and had not shown any sadness because of his mother’s passing. In fact, he even achieved quite a lot, creating history for Harken.

Therefore, in his eyes, his father could live perfectly fine without his mother. His father was different from him, who always thought of his mother.

When his mother had just passed away, he often could not sleep because he missed her very much. Later, he gradually got used to the days without his mother by his side. However, because of Candice’s appearance recently, he started to think about his mother a lot again.

He concluded that it was because that woman’s influence in the family was too great that he felt she was a threat to his mother’s status, hence his behavior.

Even so, he had always thought he was the only one who felt that way. He had never thought that his father would also… like him.

He did not know what to feel. He seemed happy that his father still remembered his mother, but he also felt a little sad for the person behind him.

Did she not care about his father calling out another woman’s name?

“I can’t possibly be bothered with a dead person, can I?” Candice chuckled.

She seemed to have guessed George’s thoughts.

Then, she said calmly, “That’s why I can’t do anything about it. I can’t take away your mother’s place in your and your father’s hearts. Look at how well your father treats me, like he’s forgotten about your mother, so why can’t you accept me?”

Edward was really good to her, so good that she felt that Edward’s feelings for her were very strong. It was as if he was deeply in love with her.

It was only because Edward would occasionally call Jeanne’s name in his dreams that she knew Edward only loved one person in his entire life.

Towards her, he probably felt more guilt than love. After all, he could not give her his love, so he could only make up for it with other things.

In fact, she could… accept that too. Their marriage had been a political one from the start, so she had not held much hope from the beginning. To be able to have such a good relationship with Edward, she was content.

What made her even more contented was Edward’s children, whom she liked very much. She had a feeling that she would be fine not spending time with Edward, as long as she could spend time with George and Paige.

Therefore, she felt lucky to have married Edward and accepted the fact that Edward would never love her the most.

When a person reached a certain age, they would not dwell on something they had no control over. Once they matured, they would learn how to live a better life.

She did not know why or when it started, but she just knew how to protect herself. Once she felt that she was about to get hurt, she would choose to run away. That was why she knew how to ignore Edward’s feelings for Jeanne.

“It’s clean,” Candice said. She dried George’s short hair with a towel before helping him out of the bathtub. She squatted down and carried George out of the bathroom.

For the first time, George felt that Candice’s back was warm and gave him a sense of security. In fact, her back was not broad at all, and her body was a 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

little slender. However, he had an inexplicable feeling that the woman would protect him.

He tried his best not to show any emotion as Candice placed him on the bed and took out a hairdryer to dry his hair.

After she was done, she said, “Go to sleep, George.” George, however, did not close his eyes.

“Must I leave before you can sleep?” Candice felt helpless. George was too difficult to please. Was his heart made of stone?

“Not really,” George suddenly whispered.

Candice looked at him struggling to lie down. He had his back to Candice and had covered himself up tightly, like he was going to sleep.

Seeing that, Candice smiled.

Some people just refused to admit it, but their bodies would never lie. She had a feeling that George had accepted her, but he was just unwilling to admit it.

She did not know why she understood George so well. It was as if she had a

telepathic connection to him.

Just like that, Candice stayed with George until he fell asleep before leaving his room..
