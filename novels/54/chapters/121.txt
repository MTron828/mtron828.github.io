Chapter 122: Ms. Lawrence Should Treat Me With “Courtesy”

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

With a single glance, his expression changed instantly.

He took the phone from Jeanne’s hand and turned it off.

Jeanne felt her cheeks burning up.

After Edward turned off the phone, he glanced at the passenger seat.

Teddy really wanted to dig a hole in the ground and bury himself in it.

Could he get out of the car? The moment he heard the sound, he knew that Ms. Lawrence had opened his floppy disk.

His reputation was all gone in an instant.

The air in the car was frozen over.

Jeanne did not want to probe into other people’s privacy, but she had unconsciously done it just now. She never thought that such a thing would happen. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Now... It was so awkward.

“The phone isn’t mine,” Fourth Master Swan said straightforwardly.

Jeanne was stunned and slowly said, “Er.”

“Teddy’s.”

Jeanne glanced at Teddy.

Teddy, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, looked embarrassed and quickly said, “It’s mine, it’s mine.”

“Oh,” Jeanne replied.

Her tone was obviously filled with disbelief.

In fact, who would believe that Fourth Master Swan was using Teddy’s phone?

“Teddy.” Fourth Master Yan’s face was a little dark.

“Yes?”

“Delete it.”

“...” Teddy’s heart hurt.

It hurt.

He was still thinking of waiting for the day when he could secretly copy it out.

“Permanently delete it!” Fourth Master Swan’s tone was stern.

Teddy silently took the phone, his heart bleeding.

“Actually... It’s nothing,” Jeanne said, “Fourth master, you don’t have to make such a big deal out of it. We’re all adults, it’s normal.”

“It’s not mine.”

Jeanne looked at him.

“It’s not.” Fourth Master Swan repeated again.

This time, Jeanne felt that Fourth Master Swan... was actually a little childish.

“I didn’t say anything.” Jeanne smiled.

Her smile was also visibly perfunctory.

“Ms. Lawrence, it really isn’t Fourth Master’s, it’s really mine. I definitely didn’t do it just to cover for him.” Teddy was about to cry.

‘If you don’t believe me, I’ll probably be dead.’

Such sincere words, in Jeanne’s ears, meant nothing.

She remained smiling.

Teddy was on the verge of breaking down. He seemed a little agitated. “Fourth Master Swan is only interested in Ms. Lawrence’s body.”

“...”?Teddy should definitely shut up now.

Jeanne turned her head and looked out of the window.

It was obvious that she did not want to continue this topic.

However, Teddy wanted to continue and Edward gave him a look.

Teddy obediently did not speak again.

The car quieted down again until it arrived at the Lawrence Family Manor.

Jeanne got out of the car.

Fourth Master Swan also got out of the car.

Jeanne said, “It’s getting late so I better get going. Take care, Fourth Master.”

“Ms. Lawrence.” Edward suddenly called out to her, who was about to leave.

Jeanne smiled.

An official smile.

Fourth Master Swan approached Jeanne slowly.

Jeanne frowned.

“Thank you for dinner tonight, “Fourth Master Swan said.

After he finished speaking, he suddenly lowered his head and planted a kiss right onto Jeanne’s lips.

Jeanne’s heart skipped a beat and started beating wildly.

It was real. She could clearly feel the intense heartbeat.

She straightened her back, suddenly becoming hyperaware.

Fourth Master Swan inched closer to her.

The other parts of their bodies were not touching, and only their lips were in contact with each other.

In other words, Jeanne could leave at any time if she wanted to.

However, at that moment, she just remained where she was without moving.

Even when Fourth Master Swan forced her lips open with his, she did not step back.

She could taste the tip of his tongue.

The night... seemed to be a little darker.

It was as if the entire world had stopped moving.

Only the two of them were left, breathing rapidly and their hearts beating wildly.

A kiss.

It lasted a little too long.

Teddy stood respectfully by the side, looking at the two of them as if they were stuck together.

The “limited edition” clips that kept him alive were gone, and the fact that he was single was rubbing right onto his face.

What did he do wrong that they had to torture him like this?

After a long time, perhaps the hot-headed Jeanne had woken up.

She stepped back and pulled herself away from Edward’s lips.

The moment their lips separated, there seemed to be a sense of… absence on each other’s lips.

Jeanne’s face was flushed red.

Fourth Master Swan’s expression did not change. He stood in front of her and looked down at her face.

He said, “This is a thank you gift.”

What?

Jeanne’s eyes were wide open.

“I hope that next time, Ms. Lawrence will treat me with ‘courtesy’ too.” Edward emphasized the word ‘courtesy’.

Jeanne gritted her teeth. This flirtatious man!

“It’s getting late. Ms. Lawrence, go back and rest early.”

Jeanne took a deep breath and smiled. “Take care, Fourth Master.”

Finished.

She turned and left directly.
