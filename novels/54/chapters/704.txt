Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Amy’s high heels had fallen off, and Forrest was in a sorry state, with the buttons on his suit all fallen off.

Jeanne pushed them away and stood in front of the reporters, looking imposing.

That move stunned both Amy and Forrest.

“Step back one meter, and I’ll answer your questions. If you come any closer, don’t even think about getting any news from me in the future,” Jeanne said, threatening them with authority.

The originally noisy and chaotic scene was suddenly shocked by Jeanne’s words.

All the reporters exchanged glances with each other before stepping back and keeping a distance from Jeanne.

Amy and Forrest were both shocked by the scene.

Just now, they had risked their lives... Well, in front of President Lawrence, it was nothing.

Jeanne said, “I’ll try my best to answer your questions.”

The reporter quickly asked, “Ms. Lawrence, is it true that Rick Gordon accused you of threatening and beating him in public to the media?”

“If it’s true, would I be able to leave the police station?”

“There has been a lot of drama about the matter between the Lawrence Enterprise and its retail agents, but Lawrence Enterprise hasn’t said anything about it. May I ask if Lawrence Enterprise intends on solving the problem of Lawrence Enterprise’s physical retail stores?”

“It is being solved. Within a week, we will give an explanation to all of our retail agents and publicly announce our solution.”

“Regarding Rick Gordon’s accusation against you, do you have anything to say about that?”

“Truth will speak for itself, and I will do my part.”

Jeanne answered the reporter’s questions with ease.

“Ms. Lawrence, may I ask if Fourth Master Swan has been away from South Hampton City recently?” A reporter suddenly changed the topic.

Jeanne still replied, “That’s right.”

“It has been more than half a month since the incident with your family, and you’ve been carrying the burden of your family matters this entire time. Fourth Master Swan has not once shown up for you since then. Although work is more important, won’t you have any complaints about his indifference, Ms. Lawrence?”

“Every couple has their own way of getting along. Edward and I are destined to be different from the usual couple, and we can’t do whatever we want. Besides ourselves, we have to be responsible for our own families. In fact, everyone has their own things to do. I don’t think it’s wrong for Edward to be busy with the matters of the Swans. I think the best way to treat each other is not to trouble our partner.”

“Ms. Lawrence, what you mean is that the two of you only need to take care of yourselves most of the time.”

“I bring my best self to my marriage, and so did Edward. There’s nothing to be picky about, and the best marriage is to support each other’s success instead of losing ourselves in the relationship.” Jeanne’s understanding of marriage made the reporters present a little surprised.

“Ms. Lawrence, do you mean that your current marriage with Fourth Master Swan is the best type of marriage? Both of you are the cream of the crop in your respective fields.”

“All I can say is that I don’t regret marrying Edward. Regardless of whether he married me with rows of cars filled with flowers or because of the various reasons he can’t return to my side when I need him, Edward is the best to me.”

“Is Ms. Lawrence confessing in public?” The reporter joked.

It could be considered that, but she and Edward could never be so innocent.

Be it their relationship or their career, between them... perhaps they did not even know how far apart they were.

Jeanne said, “Marriage can be cold and warm. If there are no other questions, please make way. As you can see, I still have many things to deal with.”

The reporter quickly made way for her. After all, Jeanne had answered all the questions today, and they could not be so shameless.

When Jeanne returned to the car, Forrest was tidying up his suit jacket while Amy was putting on her high heels.

“Next time you meet a reporter, don’t try to be brave,” Jeanne said.

Forrest and Amy were embarrassed.

“The clothes and shoes can be considered as work-related injuries. Go and claim it from the finance department.”

“Thank you, President Lawrence,” the two of them quickly said.

Jeanne smiled faintly.

For a long time, she had learned to be cold like Kingsley’s many assassins, who were cold and heartless.

However, at the end of the day, she had a son and an uncle.

She felt that she was no longer alone in this world.

Hence, she could not be completely indifferent to everything.

In an old town, Nox was playing with his phone with nothing to do.
