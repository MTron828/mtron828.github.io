Chapter 1603: Grand Wedding, Zoe Gets Humiliated

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Edward shook his head at the stage, saying it was not him.

Nox’s first thought was Edward because although that guy would not say it, his friendship with Nox ran deep, so it would be no surprise if he did prepare a wedding gift for Nox.

However, if not Edward, it would be…

“Finn?”

The light shone on Finn’s face, and Finn also shook his head.

F*ck. He could not believe that his two best friends were so unconcerned about his marriage!

“Who else could it be?” Nox could not think of anyone else who would prepare a special gift for him!

Everyone was trying to guess who that person was as well. Seeing that the host was trying to build up suspense, the person probably was not just anyone.

“Could it be you?” Nox was suddenly a little excited again as he turned to look at Zoe with anticipation.

Zoe was stunned, but she quickly shook her head. “It wasn’t me. Haven’t I given you all my surprises?”

That one sentence made everyone burst into laughter as they thought that Zoe was implying something else. Embarrassed by the sudden laughter, Zoe’s shy expression made her look extremely innocent.

Nox, who Zoe also amused, said, “That’s true.”

The answer made everyone laugh again. The interaction between the newlyweds was extremely sweet.

When Monica saw that, she thought that as long as Nox was happy, all was good. As for Shelly, they were just not fated to be together.

“Alright, stop keeping me in suspense. Just announce who prepared the surprise gift for me,” Nox quickly told the host as he could not wait any longer to find out.

Trying to be mysterious, the host said, “Why don’t we take a look at this gift and guess who prepared it for you?”

Nox thought about it and nodded. He figured that once he saw the video, he would definitely be able to guess who it was. Therefore, he was rather excited about it.

After the host handed the USB flash drive to the staff, the huge high-definition projection screen suddenly lit up. Everyone looked at the screen seriously, curious about the mysterious gift.

A video file appeared on the screen. It was named “Farewell to Nox”.

Nox was also curious as to who would be so nice to him to prepare a surprise for him alone. He really thought about it again but still could not figure out who it was!

His eyes focused on the screen, and everyone looked on with anticipation. As the video played, a black background with white words appeared, stating the date and location.

The next scene showed a group of people partying in a room. The scene was extremely obscene. The entire screen was filled with mosaics because not much was appropriate to be watched normally. Other than the faces on the screen, everything else was covered up.

Among those faces, one was Zoe. However, Zoe in the video and the woman standing in the middle of the stage were two completely different people. The woman in the center of the stage was noble and pure, while the woman on the screen was so lewd. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

That scene only lasted for half a minute before it changed to a black background with white words. The date and location were also written on it. When the next scene played, it was also filled with raunchy images everywhere, and… it was indescribable.

The crowd’s anticipation turned into shock. No one had expected two people from such prominent families and of equal status would have such a huge scandal at their wedding.

The video kept playing, and because no one stopped it, those scenes were presented in front of the entire country. The wedding that had just been praised by countless people had suddenly become a huge joke!

After some time, the Sullivans came back to their senses. They quickly called for the staff and shouted at them frantically, “Turn it off! Turn it off right now! ”

The scene started to get chaotic.

On the other hand, Zoe seemed to have lost half of her energy. She had never thought that the other side of her would suddenly be exposed to everyone and embarrass her to such an extent.

She was so shocked that she could not react..
