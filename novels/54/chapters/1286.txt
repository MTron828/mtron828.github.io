1287 Candice’s Identity Revealed

Was this not strange at all?!

She had been lying in bed for eight years. When she woke up in the ninth year, she was targeted.

The key was that he was not a small fry.

She had never thought of being with the Chief of Harken. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even though she could often hear praise for him from her father, she admired this young leader from the bottom of her heart.

“Why me?” she finally could not help but ask.

“The Chief just ascended the throne and needed someone loyal next to him. I was chosen by him, but in the end, I had too much power. If he used me again, I might be at risk of exceeding his power. In order to make him not be too afraid of me, he suggested that I marry my daughter to him. Once we become a family, there won’t be too many taboos. Originally, I wanted to marry your younger sister, Chloe, to him, but he said that he wanted you.”

“I’ve never even met him.” Candice was really baffled.

In the eyes of politicians, was marriage such a trivial thing?!

“Standing in his complicated position of power, the more innocent and simple the person standing next to him, who is also the most important person, the more beneficial it is to him. You have never interacted with anyone else. Your life now is a clean slate, so you have become the most suitable candidate,” Wyatt explained.

Candice finally understood.

It was just a political marriage. It was precisely because she had nothing now that she was lucky enough to be chosen by the Chief.

She did not know what she was feeling at that time.

However, seeing her father in such a difficult position, she agreed.

She did not know why.

She felt that his feelings were not very deep. It was as if he had experienced something and had a calm heart. She did not have any expectations for his feelings.

Therefore, no matter who she married, it was just a matter of getting married.

Moreover, looking at her father’s appearance, it did not seem to be some flimsy reason, rather it was probably not to put him in an important position.

It was because he had too much power now, and the new Chief had just taken over and felt insecure. He wanted to use this method to shackle her father. If her father disobeyed, he might be suspected of rebelling. If he obeyed, he would feel very sorry for her, which was why he felt so uncomfortable today.

“Okay, I’ll marry him.” She agreed immediately.

She knew that there was actually no other choice. Otherwise, how could her father, who loved her so much, agree to her marriage just like that?

Her father nodded. He was really upset. “It’s been hard on you, Candice.”

“It’s not,” Candice smiled. “He’s the Chief of Harken. Many women flock to him yet I can marry him without any effort. How can I be aggrieved? I’m overjoyed.”

Wyatt smiled helplessly as he knew that she was just comforting him.

The truth was just as she had said. Which woman would not yearn to be with the Chief of Harken?

However, later on… She finally understood her father’s helplessness—the Chief’s past love was not simple at all.

It was said that the first wife was his true love. He had once prepared an exceptionally sensational wedding for her. It was a story that was discussed for a long time in South Hampton. Later on, that wife died because of some political entanglements. It was actually understandable for him to have another relationship after her death. After all, she was no longer around. She could not really live a life of widowhood for that lady. This Chief was scum. The previous wife had just died, but he slept with the second wife and she was even pregnant.

However, the second wife did not have a good ending either.

According to the unofficial history, in order to obtain power, this Chief was actually just using the second wife to obtain his own power and completely abandoned her.

It was probably even more tragic than the first one.

These two wives had each given birth to a child for him, a son and a daughter.

Which meant… The third person to marry him was already the stepmother of two children.

Candice Nicholson really could not accept it.

Sometimes, when she was overseas, she could see a lot of news that could not be seen in the country, so she had specially understood this person in depth.

Many objective evaluations of Edward were that he could do anything for power, but she did not deny that he was the most capable and qualified person to sit in this position in the past thousands of years of Harken. Therefore, her final opinion was that he was a great and outstanding politician. As for the gossip, it was just a small part of his rich life and did not affect his life.
