Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was probably just a guideline.

She did not want Michael to be too proactive with her before this anyway. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I’ll head back first.” Monica lowered her head and put on her shoes.

Michael instinctively squatted down and was about to put it on for her when Monica blurted out, “Don’t touch me.”

Michael’s hand, which was by Monica’s feet, stiffened in embarrassment.

After Monica shouted, she felt a little guilty.

Just a second ago, she had the fear that she would be touched by something dirty.

Michael retracted his hand. “I’m sorry. I keep forgetting. I’ll watch out next time.”

Monica rejected him, but at the same time, she felt guilty. She believed that if this continued, she would go crazy.

Nevertheless, she gritted her teeth and forced herself to become cold-blooded, so much so that she did not notice Michael’s pain.

She quickly put on her shoes and stood up from the swing.

She said, “About what I told you this morning, any results on that?”

“They’ll come up with a plan for me tomorrow. I’ve asked for the first draft in the afternoon, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.” Michael smiled.

Even after she rejected him, he was still extremely gentle to her.

That made her feel even guiltier.

However, she did not show give in. Instead, she said, “I’ll take my leave now”

She was about to leave in her high heels and had just taken a step when she lost her balance.

“Ah!” Monica screamed.

Michael quickly caught her in his arms.

Monica was so scared that she was sweating. Her ankle had just recovered, and she did not want to break it again.

Michael broke out in a cold sweat and asked with concern, “Are you alright?”

“I’m fine.” Monica calmed down and stood up straight.

By then, Michael had also let go of her.

“I’ll send you out,” Michael said.

Just as he said that, he seemed to realize that he had said the wrong thing. “Be careful and don’t fall.”

In the end, Monica could not be so heartless.

Especially when Michael said that it would not be a big problem for them to break up, she became less guarded and resistant toward him.

She said, “In that case, I’ll have to trouble you to send me out.”

At that moment, Michael’s eyes lit up.

Monica shifted her gaze.

She always felt that she was hurting a person who treated her well. Yet, she did not like him anymore.

She and Michael walked side by side out of the banquet hall from the back garden and to the entrance, where Michael’s car was already parked.

Monica frowned.

Michael opened the car door for Monica and hurriedly said, “I’ll get the driver to send you back. I’m not leaving.”

Monica felt that she was judging a gentleman with her own narrow-mindedness. She thought that Michael would go with her, but she did not expect that he would get the driver to send her home.

Seeing that Monica did not get into the car, Michael said, “It’s late, and I’ll worry if someone else sends you away.”

“Thank you, Michael.”

“Go back and get some rest.” Michael smiled.

Monica was grateful to him.

Then, she got into the car and left.

As the car drove off, Michael looked at the back of the car and his expression changed.

He refused to believe that he could not make Monica change her mind after using all his tricks and schemes.

His eyes moved, and he saw a paparazzi disappear from his sight.

…

The banquet hall was still bustling with noise and excitement.

In a corner of the hall, Eden and Joshua were drinking together.

For the entire night, the two of them were in a low mood.

Joshua could not accept that everyone’s attention at the banquet was on Jeanne. He was the chairman of Lawrence Enterprise, but no one took the initiative to greet him. Even when his mother took him around to socialize, no one talked to him about Lawrence Enterprise. He was not recognized by the outsiders at all.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

Of course, Eden was even angrier to see Jeanne handling the banquet with ease and pride and his Fourth Uncle being fawned on by the people.

He, who had always been proud, never thought that there would be a day when he would be in such a sorry state.

As a member of the Swans, not only was he ignored, but no one took the initiative to socialize with him today as well. He even heard some people mocking him, saying that he had been blind back then. Otherwise, how could he have cheated on Jeanne for Jasmine? It was a big loss to him.

He had suffered a great loss!

He could see Jeanne’s face, her graceful figure, and her beautiful smile…
