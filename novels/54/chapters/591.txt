Chapter 592: Big Shots Showing Up One After Another: Jeanne, I Know Your Identity!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Of course.” Jeanne nodded. “Maybe if you used your name ‘Quinn Sanders’ to send your resume, we would’ve directly rejected you.”

Jeanne’s straightforwardness made the other interviewers gasp.

Quinn did not mind. “In that case, I’m very glad I chose this method. I hope all of you can see what I’m capable of and see me in a different light.”

“Ms. Sanders, we can see how capable you are from your resume, and we’ve also heard about your status and identity. However, I’m just curious as to why Ms. Sanders chose to come to our company. If you want to experience normal life and assimilate into civilian life, I think Swan Enterprise is the best choice,” Jeanne said.

Quinn flashed Jeanne a dignified smile.

“Director Lawrence, are you trying to ruin your husband?” Quinn joked.

Jeanne really did want to ruin him!

“You know my identity would bring inconvenience to others, yet you still recommend me to Swan Enterprise,” Quinn said with a smile.

Jeanne pursed her lips. “I just think you are more suited to develop your career in a bigger company.”

“No, my career is suitable for growing business. What I need is a sense of accomplishment.” Quinn appeared a little serious. “Actually, I have applied to many companies in the country, but many have tactfully rejected me. Even if they didn’t reject me, they arranged for me to have a high-paying job that I could mess around with and do nothing. I didn’t plan to apply for Lawrence Enterprise, but I’ve heard a lot of rumors about Director Lawrence. I personally don’t think Director Lawrence is the kind of person who would follow the masses. I believe you would give me a different answer than others!”

“I feel honored that Ms. Sanders decided to choose Lawrence Enterprise and even me. However, I’m sorry to disappoint you, Ms. Sanders. I’m just an ordinary person, and I share the same thoughts as the rest.” The underlying meaning was that she refused Quinn to join Lawrence Enterprise.

However, Quinn did not look disappointed. Instead, she said, “Director Lawrence, why don’t you look at my resume again and decide.”

“Your resume–” Before she could look at it again, she was stunned by Quinn’s gaze.

It was clearly a signal for her to lower her head.

The moment she lowered her head, she saw a message from Kingsley pop up on her phone that she had turned to mute. “Let Quinn enter Lawrence Enterprise.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Damn it. Kingsley, that bastard!

Her expression changed slightly, but she tried her best to adjust her emotions.

Quinn was still smiling. Instead of looking nervous, she looked confident.

Jeanne was silent for a few seconds.

At that moment, everyone in the interview room was an employee under Jeanne, so no one dared to make the decision.

Moreover, it was obvious that the second princess of the Sanders wanted an answer and would not leave without one. In other words, they had to decide now whether Quinn should stay or not.

In the awkward space, Jeanne raised her head. “Looking at Ms. Sanders’s resume again, your capability has really convinced me.”

Quinn still had a smile on her face. It was the standard Duchenne smile.

“I think no one can reject Ms. Sanders from joining us, and I don’t want Lawrence Enterprise to lose out on such a great talent just because of Ms. Sanders’s identity.” Jeanne felt disgusted saying it. “So, if Ms. Sanders thinks that Lawrence Enterprise can provide for you to grow in your career, I sincerely hope Ms. Sanders can join us.”

She even lowered her head as she said and redeemed herself perfectly from rejecting Quin just now.

The other interviewers were all somewhat surprised at Jeanne’s sudden change in decision.

Logically speaking, they should not allow Quinn to join the company.

With Quinn’s status and identity, no one would dare to do anything to her. Even if she had any thoughts or was being unreasonable, no one would dare to refute her.

If Quinn was capable, it would be fine. If not, accepting her into the company would be a disaster waiting to happen.

“Director Lawrence, you’re flattering me. To be able to obtain Director Lawrence’s approval and successfully get the job, I feel extremely honored.” Quinn replied respectfully, “In that case, I’ll go out and wait for you to get back to me.”

“There’s no need to wait for us to get back to you. Ms. Sanders has been accepted,” Jeanne said.

Quinn smiled gratefully. “Thank you.”

“I’ll inform the staff tomorrow to go through the onboarding procedures.”

“Okay, I’ll do my best to cooperate.”

“Take care, Ms. Sanders.”

Quinn expressed her gratitude once again before walking out.

After Quinn was out the door, Jeanne could not hold it in any longer. She was not in the mood to sit in for the next person’s interview.

She had to give Kingsley a call to ask him for an explanation.

She said, “You don’t have to wait for me. I’ll be back in a while.”

“Yes.”

Jeanne left the interview room. Just as she walked to a corner and was about to make a call, a female voice called out from beside her.

“Jeanne.”

Jeanne looked at Quinn, whom she thought had left.

However, at that moment, Quinn suddenly walked up to her while maintaining the nobility that a Sander had.

“Are you surprised I came?” Quinn asked.

“Yes, I’m very surprised, but it’s not just me. Everyone is surprised.” Jeanne did not look any different.

“No, yours is different from the others.” There was a hidden meaning behind her words.

Jeanne smiled. “What are you trying to say, Ms. Sanders?”

“You’re overthinking it.” Quinn maintained her smile. “I just came to greet you on my own initiative. I didn’t mean anything else. But...”

Jeanne frowned as Quinn moved closer to her, making her wary.

Quinn’s voice was a little soft, but Jeanne could hear it. She even felt her hair stand on end.

Quinn said, “Jeanne, I know who you really are.”
