1292 Edward and Candice’s First Date

Of course, it was not because Monica was familiar with Brandon just because the Hayes family was one of the twelve families. In fact, not every family had a good relationship with each other. The relationship between her and Brandon was because the two families were neighbors back then and often played together when they were young.

Brandon looked like a girl when he was young, and he was introverted. He was also a few months younger than she was, so he always followed behind her and called her sister.

Then, he chased after her. When they were about seven or eight years old, Brandon left the country with his family.

When that just happened, she would often think about him. However, as time passed, she actually forgot about it. Even today, she almost could not recall who Brandon was.

As expected, time truly made one grow old!

“Do you still need me to explain?” Brandon asked with a smile when he saw that Monica seemed to have remembered.

“Speaking of which, your parents are back too? What about your business overseas? Don’t you want it anymore? Are you going back here to grow your business again?! Besides, your family has a business. Why are you here instead of with them?” Monica muttered a bunch of questions.

Brandon could not help but smile again. He had always thought that Monica’s current position would have changed a lot.

Before returning home, he had learned a lot about the Cardellini Pharmaceutical Group. Naturally, he knew that Monica had turned the tide by herself and shocked the entire business circle. Now, under Monica’s leadership, the Group was like the sun in the sky. Therefore, he thought that Monica had become very different.

Human nature would not change indeed.

In his memory, Monica’s bright smile had always brought a bright and lively appearance.

Right now, Monica seemed to have overlapped with her childhood appearance.

Brandon answered Monica’s questions one by one.

“Yes, my parents came back together. When they reached a certain age, they started to miss home, so they returned. The family business was left to my eldest brother. He has always been responsible for the family business, so my parents’ return would not affect the development of our family business. As for the main reason I didn’t go to work in my own company, was that I didn’t want to be protected by my family. I had to grow up on my own. Besides, you can be completely at ease. I don’t have the slightest intention of going back to work in my own company. My brother is managing the company very well now and doesn’t need me. My parents won’t force me to work there either. They’re also afraid that with two brothers, there will be a day they turn against each other for their assets, so they’re very supportive of me working in other companies.”

“Oh,” Monica replied. She finally understood what was going on, but was still lost for words. After all, he had not seen Brandon for many years, so they were still a little distant.

Moreover, she did not treat Brandon very well back then.

Although Brandon looked like a girl, he was still a boy. When she was young, she didn’t like to play with boys. To be precise, she liked to play with Jeanne, so she often treated Brandon badly. She even scolded him to stop following her around. Sometimes, when she went to the Lawrence family’s courtyard to play with Jeanne, Brandon would shamelessly follow her. Just thinking about it made her feel that Brandon was really a clingy person back then.

Finally, Brandon left. Although she was reluctant to part with him for a period of time after he left and felt that something was missing from her side, she gradually forgot about him.

If not for his sudden appearance, she might not have remembered having a childhood playmate.

“I’ll get out of your hair now.” Brandon seemed to be able to read Monica’s mind and said jokingly, “I was just here to reconnect with an old acquaintance so we could work better together in the future.”

“Are you trying to use nepotism?” Monica could not help but laugh.

She felt that Brandon had changed a lot after not seeing him for so many years. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He used to be very shy, but now, she felt that he had grown a little funny bone.

“Why not? But you won’t be disappointed either way with what I bring to the table.”

“I’ll wait and see.”

Brandon nodded slightly. He turned and walked out of Monica’s office.

Monica looked at his back and could not help but sigh at how quickly time passed.

She could still remember the scene of the two of them playing together when they were young.

She snapped out of reminiscing and prepared to get back to work.

She then happened to see a piece of trending news on her phone screen.

As the word “Chief” was involved, she could help but click on it.
