1362 The Wedding: I Never Agreed to the Breakup

It was so fervent that Monica could not bring herself to react for a few seconds.

All she felt was Finn suddenly hugging her tightly, and he was so strong that she could not resist at all.

Then, she felt him bite her lips rudely, like he was taking revenge on her.

“Ugh!” Monica twisted her body.

She stammered as she tried to push Finn away.

She did not expect to provoke him so much that he would lose control tonight.

In her opinion, Finn would never do such a thing. Even if he felt uncomfortable at that moment, he would endure it and would never vent it on anyone else. That was why she was caught off guard. However, it was too late to take precautions now.

Finn’s strength was astonishing, and that was something Monica had known many years ago. If Finn did anything to her or even killed her, she would not be able to escape.

Her resistance seemed to have agitated Finn even more.

Finn, who had been suppressing himself for the entire night, finally exploded. He hugged Monica and pressed her onto the bed.

The bath towel on her body was useless. Even without Finn doing anything, it had slipped off during the confrontation.

She bit down hard on Finn’s mouth. She had used so much strength that she even tasted blood, but to Finn, it was nothing. Since he could not feel pain at all, it was useless for her to bite him.

She just suddenly felt uncomfortable because of Finn’s violent and crazy behavior, and tears were flowing down from the corners of her eyes.

What happened to them parting on good terms?

Now, Finn was going to consume every last bit of feelings she had for him.

She suddenly chose to endure Finn’s madness.

She wondered if Finn was just venting his anger because she said she did not love him. If it was, she would compensate him for one night for lying to him all these years.

Although she was fine with it, it was still unbearable. It was so unbearable that her tears never stopped flowing down her cheeks.

Finn saw it but ignored it and vented all his anger on her. After venting, he did not leave. Instead, he pressed down on her body.

By then, both of them had quieted down, and everything was silent. It was as if they were not even breathing, like they were just two empty shells.

After some time, Finn finally got up from her body.

“Was that enough?” Monica asked him.

Finn’s heart ached because of Monica’s emotionless voice. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Tonight, he had lost control and wanted to use a method he despised the most to prove his existence in Monica’s life.

He knew she know her rejection and discomfort, but he did not stop.

“If it’s not enough, you can continue,” Monica said calmly and coldly.

Finn wanted to apologize, but he held it in.

After all, what was the use of apologizing? He had done it, so what else could he apologize for?

“Until you are satisfied.”

Finn’s throat moved slightly, and he clenched his fists tightly. However, he did not do anything to Monica.

Monica waited for a while. After confirming that Finn would not do it again, she said, “Since you’re not interested, leave.”

She was urging him to leave again because she just wanted to push him away.

“I’ll let it go this time.” Monica said, “But next time, I will sue you for rape.”

With that, Monica left Finn’s side to take a shower and wash away all the smell on Finn’s body.

Just as she got up from the bed, Finn suddenly said, “Monica, I never agreed on the breakup.”

It was rare for him to speak.

She had always felt that with Finn’s personality, he would not say a word even if he was beaten to death. He would not mention anything about his loss of control tonight and would treat it as a thing of the past because his pride would not allow it.

Monica’s eyes flickered as she turned around and looked at him.

“I never agreed.” Finn met Monica’s gaze and spoke seriously.

Monica wanted to laugh because she thought she had just heard the funniest joke in the world.
