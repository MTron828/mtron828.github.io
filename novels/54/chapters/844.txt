Chapter 845 Finn, Haven’t You Lost Out With Monica Like This?

It was a dark and luxurious night. The Charm Club, the most popular nightclub in South Hampton City, was crowded from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m. Monica sat in a corner of the hall, looking at the young men swaying wildly on stage. The sound of music, commotion, and drunken energy filled the space.

“Didn’t you ask me to find you a handsome man to play with? So instead of sitting here and drinking, shouldn’t you be on stage, dancing and flirting?” Her fair-weather friend, Elsa, said over the loud and noisy live music.

Monica did not know why she was suddenly uninterest in a place like this. Elsa really had found her a few young hunks, all of whom looked like K-pop stars with killer figures. While she would not have said how much she liked these young and handsome men in the past, she would have at least screamed when she saw them.

Now, it didn’t seem much fun anymore.

“Hey! If you’re not going, I’ll go!” Seeing that Monica was unmoved, Elsa called the five young hunks to the dance floor.

Monica took a few sips of her wine. She watched as Elsa writhed around on stage with the five young hunks surrounding her. The atmosphere seemed much more lively now.

She lowered her head and picked up her phone to send a message. After a while, a man rushed over, panting, “Miss, why did you call me to a nightclub so late?”

It was editor-in-chief of a magazine.

“To take some photos and videos of me, of course. I can’t take them myself, can I?” She said.

He was a reporter, not a photographer.

“Get a good shot of everything. You can use what you want, but the rest has to be given to me.” Monica ordered.

The reporter nodded. “Alright. I’m fine with that.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

They couldn’t afford to offend these big shots anyway.

Monica downed all the wine in the glass. The burning taste made her feel a little dizzy, but this was the state expected at a nightclub.

She was wearing a loose white shirt tonight, with one corner of it slightly revealing her slender shoulder. It revealed the black spaghetti strap on her shoulder, making her look very sexy. Below, she wore a pair of super short black hot pants. The length cut just above her thighs, exposing her long, white, straight thighs. On her feet was a pair of super high-heeled sandals, which made her figure look even more slender and enchanting.

She walked onto the T-shaped stage. As her white shirt was a little long, the wind deliberately created for the dance floor made the shirt flutter on her body. It outlined her body sexily and gave off a hint of a fairy-like aura, especially now that she had released her ponytail. With her soft hair flowing and charming smile, she looked like a beauty in the world.

Everyone who was dancing wildly on the dance floor seemed to be attracted to her and stopped. They even subconsciously left a little space for her to display her charm to the fullest.

Monica was not the kind of beauty that could cause the downfall of a city. However, when she was seductive, she could make all men bend over backward for her.

Her fair-weather friends had even given her a nickname, “Night Fairy” because she seemed to turn into a different person in this environment.

She stopped in the middle of the dance floor. The moving lights flitted back and forth over her body. She stretched out her arm, pointed her slender fingers at the young men who were dancing with Elsa, and smiled seductively. The five young hunks immediately walked through the crowd to her side.

Bit by bit, Monica unbuttoned her shirt. Underneath was an extremely cool black spaghetti strap, revealing her small, chubby waist to everyone. She threw the shirt directly onto the ground, bent over, sliding her hips gracefully. Then, she removed the pair of sandals off her feet and walked barefoot to the middle of the dance floor.

The DJ played some explosive music, and Monica started swaying sexily to it. Her sexy dance moves made everyone’s eyes fall involuntarily on her. Whether it was the sultry smile on her face or beautiful figure that all women wanted to touch, it made the audience scream enthusiastically. This especially affected the five young hunks, who approached her and danced crazily under her seduction. Monica even pressed and grounded her whole body onto the hunks. Her dance was so alluring that it made the people feel like they were going to explode.
