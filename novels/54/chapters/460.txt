Chapter 461: Jasmine Inciting Trouble and Seeking Her Own Destruction

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After buying his underwear, Jeanne and Edward left the shopping mall.

As they passed by an exquisite flower shop on the first floor, Jeanne stopped in her tracks.

She looked at the time while Edward looked at her. “Do you like it?”

“Is this place close to Central Hospital?” Jeanne looked around.

“Yes.”

“Since we still have some time, I want to go and see Monica,” Jeanne said.

Although she knew Monica only had a superficial injury and that she just needed to recuperate, she had not visited Monica since her accident.

That girl loved having people around, so it surprised her that Monica had not called her to harass her over the last few days.

It made her feel... disappointed.

“Sure. I’ll go and visit Finn too,” Edward agreed.

Jeanne said to the lady selling flowers, “Pack a bouquet of red roses for me, please.”

“Yes, miss.”

With that, the two of them carried a bouquet of flowers and walked into the VIP ward of Central Hospital.

......

They went to the orthopedics department first.

After asking around, they found out that Monica had shamelessly moved herself to the emergency and trauma department and was now in the same room as Dr. Jones.

Moreover, the news seemed to have spread like wildfire in the hospital.

In that case, the two of them went to the emergency and trauma department and entered the VIP Ward.

There were two rooms in the ward — one on the inside and one on the outside. The inside was a hospital bed, and the outside was the living room.

When Jeanne and Edward went in, the door to the room inside was closed.

Then, they heard Monica’s loud voice coming from inside. “Can you stop moving? You’re not making it easy for me.”

“...”

“How can I help you if you do this? Finn, don’t be shy.”

“...”

“Hubby, are you comfortable?”

“...”

Jeanne felt awkward. Did she come at the wrong time?

The nurse in the living room looked at Jeanne and Edward and quickly went forward to ask, “Are you here to see Dr. Jones and Mrs. Jones?”

“Uh, yes.” Jeanne nodded. “It seems like this is not a good time.”

“No, no.” The nurse quickly said, “It’ll take at most ten minutes.”

Jeanne stared at the nurse with her eyes wide open.

How did she know?

The nurse said, “It’s the same every day. It takes them about ten minutes.”

It’s the same every day…

Did that mean it was normal for men to want it every day? Had she misjudged Edward?

She could not help but turn her head to look at Edward, who looked back at her and said slowly, “Your best friend is quite capable.”

Was he criticizing her?

“Both of you can take a seat. They’ll be done in a while,” the nurse told them warmly.

In the end, Jeanne and Edward sat down.

After they sat down, the voices in the room continued.

“Monica, be gentle.” Finn was flustered and exasperated.

“Will you feel more comfortable if I’m gentler?”

“Hurry up. Just hurry up.”

“Why are you in a rush…”

Jeanne felt embarrassed for them.

Could the two of them keep a low profile?

Fortunately, they only waited for about ten minutes when Monica’s voice came from inside. “Miss, can you please come in and help us?”

Was Monica always so bold and unrestrained?

When the nurse heard Monica, she quickly stood up and walked into the room.

Jeanne did not dare to look over.

However, after the nurse went in for a while, Jeanne heard Monica’s loud voice from inside again. “Jeanne, are you finally here to see me?”

Having been called out, Jeanne turned her head and glanced at Edward.

With that, Edward held her hand and walked into the room.

In the room, Monica was wearing a hospital gown and lying on Finn’s bed.

Finn was also wearing a hospital gown, but he had many tubes inserted into his body. He still looked weak and like he had to be taken care of.

Jeanne felt her heart ache just looking at Finn. How could Monica do that?

She looked at Monica, who was unusually excited. “What made you think of coming to see me? I thought you and Fourth Master were so inseparable that you had forgotten about me.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’ve been busy.” Jeanne gave an excuse.

Nevertheless, Monica did not mind.

She noticed the bouquet of flowers in Jeanne’s hand. “Are they for me?”

“Yes, I’ll help you put them in a vase.”

“There’s no need. Just let the nurse do it, so you can spend more time with me. I’m bored to death,” Monica said.

Since Monica said so, Jeanne passed the flowers to the nurse beside her and sat beside Monica’s bed while Edward sat beside Finn.

Jeanne asked, “Why are you in the same ward as Dr. Jones?”

“We’re husband and wife. Shouldn’t we sleep on the same bed?”

Jeanne was speechless. That was not what she meant with her question.

However, she had to admit that Monica amused her at that moment.
