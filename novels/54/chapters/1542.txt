Chapter 1543: You Still Can I t Let Go of Finn

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Finn looked at Jeanne, a little surprised that Jeanne would side with him and help him.

He was about to give up. The scene of Monica leaving with Brandon last night still made him feel hurt. It hurt so bad that he even wanted to seal himself off for a while and lived his life coldly, just like he did many years ago when he had no expectations or emotions.

Now, because of Jeanne’s words, his hope was rekindled.

“Thank you,” Finn said sincerely.

Jeanne smiled faintly, indicating that there was no need to thank her.

“I thought you would hate me,” Finn said bluntly.

The current Finn was much more talkative than before.

“I only hate Edward.” Jeanne knew what Finn was talking about.

“Actually, if you want to restore your original appearance, it’s technically possible. Back then, when I performed the surgery on you, I left a backup plan. I was afraid that Fourth Master would regret it one day, so I didn’t touch your bones. It’s not difficult to restore your original appearance.”

Jeanne was still a little surprised at how skilled Finn was.

She had compared her face with Candice’s face in the past. Their two faces looked almost identical, but he did not cut the bones. He only made some facial adjustments.

“From an aesthetic point of view, your previous face could be considered perfect. It would be a pity if it was really ruined,” Finn continued to explain.

“Where are you at medical research?”Jeanne could not help but ask.

“It’s alright.”

“Can you not be so humble?”Jeanne glared at him.

Finn chuckled and replied, “Our medical research laboratory is at least ten years ahead of Harken’s.”

She Imew he was more than alright.

“Why don’t you guys invest your research into Harken’s medical science? Now that Edward is the Leader, he should be strengthening Harken’s medical standards. ”

“No, we’ve been researching a lot of banned drugs, which means they can’t be sold in the market. But in fact, some of them can be applied to medical technology, and they have been slowly immersed in medicine. It just needs a process. Sometimes, being too radical is not necessarily a good thing for a country. It will cause a lot of disputes at the international level. In short, when it comes to governing the country, you just have to trust him. He will be the greatest leader of Harken.”

It seemed that Finn thought really highly of Edward. To be able to make Finn, who had always looked down on others, admire him so much was enough to prove Edward’s true ability!

“By the way, did Fourth Master go to work today?” Finn was still a little surprised.

Based on his understanding of Edward, he would probably stay at home with Jeanne for a long time.

When Jeanne heard Finn, her face flushed. Only God knew the tremendous amount of effort she had spent to get Edward to leave Bamboo Garden today. At the thought of the scene that morning… she felt extremely embarrassed.

Finn seemed to have noticed it, so he did not expose them.

He just smiled. “Now that I’ve sent Paige back, I’ll make a move.”

“Are you leaving, Godfather?” Paige turned around and looked at Finn, still a little reluctant to part with him.

She had fallen in love with her godfather after spending the past few days with him. She found him so gentle, and he treated her well.

“Yeah, didn’t you say you missed your mother? Since I’ve sent you back, I naturally have to leave.”

“I will miss you,” Paige said sadly.

Finn patted Paige’s little head. He finally knew the joy of having a daughter.

He said, “I’ll miss you too, Paige.”

“Godfather, you must woo Godmother!” Paige’s young voice sounded so mature.

Jeanne was amused by Paige, and so was Finn.

He said, “I’ll work hard.”

“Godfather, you can do it!” Paige cheered him on.

“Yes.” Finn nodded.

With that, he left Bamboo Garden.

As she stared at Finn’s back… she thought the man looked lonely.

She thought for a moment and placed Paige on the sofa at the side, telling her to watch television for a while. Then, she picked up her phone and dialed Monica’s number.

“Candice.” Monica’s tone was as indifferent as ever.

Jeanne did not realize it before, but at that moment, Jeanne felt like laughing. She was also inexplicably touched that Monica treated “her” coldly because she did not want to betray their relationship.

It seemed like she had really put Monica in a difficult position.

She said, “Are you free? I’d like to see you.” “I’m busy.”

“It’s okay. I’ll wait until you have the time for me.” “I’m very busy,” Monica refused. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

She was expressing his rejection of the girl.

“I’ll be waiting for you at Riverside Restaurant at 6 p.m. tonight.”

“I won’t go-”

However, Jeanne had already hung up. She was certain that Monica would definitely come. After all, Monica was the type of person who was stubborn but soft-hearted.. That was how Monica was to her and Finn!
