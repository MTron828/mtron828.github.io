Chapter 1762: Nox Gets Drunk

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Nox was facing Edward’s family the entire time, but at that moment, he suddenly turned around and said to Shelly behind him, “You don’t have to feel uncomfortable. They’re all ordinary people in private.” “Alright.” Shelly nodded.

Although she nodded, she still could not relax.

Nox continued, “Edward also farts in private.”

Shelly almost burst out laughing. Did Nox have to make Edward so relatable? With Edward’s status, how could he such that about Edward? More importantly, Nox’s voice was neither loud nor soft, so everyone present heard it.

Edward’s face flushed red with anger. “Nox, can you speak any louder?”

“I was just joking.” Nox smiled and turned around eagerly. “I’ll drink with you later. We haven’t seen each other for a long time.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Edward still had a long face. However, Nox was used to it, so he did not take it to heart.

Jeanne also said to Shelly, “Although Nox’s words were a little crass, he’s right. We’re all ordinary people in private, and we don’t bite, so just relax. We’ll see each other a lot in the future.”

“Alright.” Shelly agreed.

This time, she was much more relaxed. She did not know if it was because of what Nox said about the Leader farting, but she was amused. She realized that, in private, they were just like ordinary people and would also be teased by their friends.

The door of the private room was pushed open again, and in walked Finn and Monica. Then, the two of them sat together at the dining table.

“where are the Dames(” Jeanne as Kea.

“They’re asleep. The nanny is taking care of them so we have time to eat,” Finn replied.

“Jeannie, you know I can’t eat anything when the babies are making a fuss.” Monica was showing off her greatness.

“Cut it out. Every time you can’t eat on time because of the babies, Finn will leave a table full of food for you to eat together.”

Monica’s attempt to make herself seem pitiful failed miserably.

“Alright, there’s no one else. Let’s eat.” Finn tried to smooth things over for

Monica.

He doted on Monica endlessly.

“I’m starving.” Monica quickly picked up her utensils.

With that, the others also began to eat.

Jeanne looked at Monica, who looked like she had not eaten for a decade. “Can you eat slow down? Your food can’t digest if you eat so quickly.”

“I’m hungry,” Monica replied with one word and continued to eat.

Speechless, Jeanne said, “Aren’t you afraid that you will continue to grow horizontally? After all, you already have a love handle.”

Monica suddenly lost her appetite to eat. Jeanne had really touched a sore spot, and she felt that everything she ate now was sinful.

“Eat more.” Finn took another piece of meat for Monica.

“Are you feeding me more so that you have a reason to abandon me?” Monica glared at Finn.

When she thought about how she was so fat because of Finn’s feeding, she was devastated.

“Don’t talk nonsense. ”

“Finn, I think you have ulterior motives,” Monica said regretfully.

She regretted becoming as fat as a ball.

Finn was helpless against Monica. He said, “Yes, I have ulterior motives.”

“Finn, how can you be so heartless? How can you treat me like this when I gave birth to two children for you? How are you so horrible?” Monica accused.

Everyone looked at the two of them as if they were watching a show, feeling extremely happy. They did not feel any sympathy for Monica at all.

“I just want to fatten you up so that you can be with me wholeheartedly. Then, you will never abandon me again,” Finn said seriously.

Stunned, Monica blinked and looked at Finn. After learning that Finn was afraid that she would not want him anymore, her mood instantly changed for the better. Then, she lowered her head and began eating happily again.

As she ate, she said, “To make you feel more at ease, I shall eat more and gain weight.”

Everyone was speechless at how fast Monica’s mood changed.

Nox could not stand it anymore and quickly changed the topic because he was afraid that the two of them would continue showing off their affection. It was even more corny than Edward and Jeanne.

He picked up his wine glass. “Edward, let’s drink.”

Edward glanced at Nox and handed Paige to Jeanne, who took Paige. After all, it was not good for him to drink with Paige around.

Nox also handed Bella to Shelly..
