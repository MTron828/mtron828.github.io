Chapter 252: Who Is Finn?!

In the Swans’ Universe Garden.

Finn held Monica in her arms, preventing her from falling to the ground.

Micheal’s expression changed when he saw Finn.

After Finn stabilized Monica, he let go of her.

Monica pursed her lips.

Without thinking, she went forward again and said fiercely to Wade, “Let me see Fourth Master Swan. If you don’t let me see him, I’ll turn Universe Garden upside down. I’ll do it!”

Monica looked very fierce.

To Wade, she looked like an angry puppy.

Being fierce was useless.

He said indifferently, “Go ahead and try it. Let’s see if your family will lose everything tomorrow. You’ll pay for all the losses here!”

“Don’t threaten me!”

“I’m not threatening you. I asked you to try,” Wade said coldly.

Monica did not care, but Finn knew very well that it was not a threat indeed.

“Old man!” Monica was angry. She could lose her mind at any moment and rush into the hall without caring about anything else.

Wade directly blocked in front of Monica.

He exerted force with his hand.

He pushed Monica away, and she fell backward.

‘How is this d*mn old man so strong?’

Monica had used all her strength. She thought that she should have knocked Wade away, but she was bounced back instead.

She could even imagine how she would fall.

While her mind was still wandering, Monica was caught by Finn next to her.

Micheal, who had also reached out his hands, narrowed his eyes.

Monica was clearly closer to Micheal. He and Finn were going to catch Monica at the same time. Why was Finn’s reaction faster than his?

Finn was one step faster and held Monica in his arms.

Micheal looked at Finn without batting an eyelid and slowly put his hands down.

Monica was frightened. She stabilized her body and looked at Wade furiously.

“Don’t waste your energy. Hurry up and go back!” Wade ordered her to leave.

He did not show any mercy nor did he leave any room for discussion.

“I want to see Fourth Master Swan!”

“I told you—it’s Impossible tonight!”

“I want to see him!” Monica’s voice was very loud. Since she could not defeat Wade, she could only yell at the top of her lungs.

She shouted until her voice was broken!

Wade’s face darkened. “I don’t want to say it a third time. Hurry up and go back!”

He was furious.

Finn could see it clearly.

Eden was also frightened.

He had seen Wade following his grandfather all this time, but he had never seen him in such an imposing manner.

On second thought, Wade was the only one who could get close to his grandfather all these years. He was definitely not that simple!

Monica was stunned by Wade’s shout.

Wade looked at Monica coldly as if he did not want to waste any more time on her. He turned around and was about to leave.

Monica suddenly knelt down.

With a thud, she directly knelt in front of Wade.

Wade was dumbfounded.

Finn pursed his lips tightly and unconsciously clenched his fists.

Micheal and Eden were also shocked.

They did not expect that Monica would go to this extent for Jeanne.

“Grandpa Wade, I’m begging you. Please let me see Fourth Master.” Monica suddenly gave in and knelt on the ground, begging with tears in her eyes.

Her knees were injured. At this moment, she knelt on the ground and felt bone-piercing pain.

Even so, she did not feel anything at this time.

Not only was she kneeling, but she was also approaching Wade step by step. Her knees kept rubbing against the ground, causing blood to flow everywhere.

Finn stared at Monica.

Everyone noticed it.

Micheal could not stand it anymore.

He hurried over and wanted to pull Monica up. “Monica, don’t be like this. Your knees are still injured...”

“Grandpa Wade.” Monica did not seem to hear him at all. She pushed Micheal away and said to Wade, “I beg you to let me see Fourth Master. I’ll tell him something quick. After that, I’ll leave. I’ll kowtow to you.”

As she said this, she suddenly kowtowed.

When there was no other choice, she could only use her pride to exchange for sympathy.

Wade’s eyes moved.

He just watched Monica kneel in front of him and kowtow to him.

If it were not for tonight’s special circumstances, he would not have made things difficult for this little girl.

However, principles were principles, orders were orders.

Wade could not disobey the old master.

Therefore, at this moment, he still turned around and left coldly.

“Grandpa Wade!” Seeing that Wade was about to leave, Monica stepped forward and hugged Wade’s leg again.

Wade’s eyes narrowed.

He gritted his teeth.

At this moment, he was about to exert his strength and might kick Monica over.

Finn suddenly pulled Monica up from the ground.

Monica was shocked.

Wade glanced at Finn and left immediately.

Monica saw Wade leave and she was on the verge of breaking down.

“Take me to see Fourth Master Swan. I want to see Fourth Master Swan!” Monica roared angrily.

Wade remained unmoved as he strode forward.

“Let go of me!” Monica screamed.

She was seized by Finn and could not move.

“Finn, let go of me. Let go of me!” Monica cried.

Finn could not help her, but he should at least not stop her

Monica hated Finn at this moment.

She was going to kill him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

If anything happened to Jeanne, she would fight Finn to death.

“Finn!” Monica screamed.

She was losing her voice to the point that she could taste blood.

Finn pursed his lips.

Micheal stepped forward and pushed Finn away.

Finn’s eyes narrowed. He let go of Monica.

Micheal held Monica in his arms.

Monica gritted her teeth and said to Finn, “I’ve never been so disappointed in you before. Finn, I’m so f*cking regretful right now. I’m so regretful that I loved you so much before...”

As she said this, she saw Finn suddenly change into a completely different person as he walked straight into the hall.

His expression was ferocious, and his veins were bulging.

He was unlike the usually gentle and refined man he was.

At this moment, Finn was exuding a murderous aura.

Wade, who was leaving, seemed to feel something strange as well. He turned around abruptly and saw Finn walking toward him with a murderous aura.

Finn walked right past him.

Wade grabbed Finn’s arm. “Finn!”

Finn was even faster and pushed him away.

The next second, he continued walking forward.

Wade was stunned.

He quickly went forward.

Wade lowered his voice and said to Finn, “Calm down!”

Finn did not seem to hear him at all.

His footsteps were very determined. He walked straight to a certain destination.

“Finn!” Wade called out to him.

Finn did not listen.

Wade had no choice but to attack directly. He could only choose to use force to suppress Finn.

Finn seemed to have noticed Wade’s movements. He turned around and caught Wade’s attack with a punch.

He then said, “Grandpa Wade, apologies!”

Next, a fight broke out.

Micheal, Monica, and Eden followed Finn when they saw him suddenly walk in.

At this moment, they saw Wade and Finn fighting in the corridor.

Monica looked at Finn in disbelief.

She looked at him in disbelief as she was surprised to see that he could fight.

He actually knew how to fight.

It was not a random fight. It was like the fight scenes on TV. Every move was precise and powerful.

Micheal and Eden were also surprised.

Micheal’s eyes narrowed.

‘Who… is Finn?!’

Finn was not a simple person given that he was close to Fourth Master Swan. Now, it seemed that he could also fight.

Just now, Micheal was surprised that Finn could catch Monica before him. Now, he was not surprised anymore.

Finn was obviously very skilled!

With that, the fierce fight only lasted a few minutes before Wade was restrained by Finn.

Wade panted heavily.

Finn said, “Grandpa Wade, you’re old!”

Wade seemed to be smiling cruelly.

He was old.

It would be okay to exchange a few blows.

As time went on, his stamina would not be able to keep up.

Even so, he was convinced.

It was time for the younger generation to rise.

Old people like him should have retired long ago!

Finn let go of Wade. Without wasting a second, he turned around and strode forward.

Wade watched Finn leave and knew that he was going to look for Edward.

He did not stop him anymore.

He could not stop him.

Besides…

Finn went against him at all costs while Monica even kowtowed to him. Something big must have happened!
