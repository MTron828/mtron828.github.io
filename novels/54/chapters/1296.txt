1297 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

“It’s getting late. I’ll head home first.”

“I’ll send you off,” Wyatt quickly said.

“No need. You guys rest early too,” Edward declined.

He let go of Candice’s hand.

That was it. There was a feeling of reluctance.

Reluctantly, he let go.

He nodded at Wyatt and Claire before turning to leave.

The group of people behind Edward also left.

After his departure, the atmosphere at home seemed to be slightly better.

Indeed, when facing a man of Edward’s status, even if he did not do anything, everyone else would feel intimidated standing close.

“Candice, come and sit,” Wyatt called out to his daughter.

Candice sat down obediently while Claire and Chloe took their seats too.

Chloe looked at Candice with hostility but the latter pretended not to notice. She just felt that she would not be staying in this house for long and did not want to cause trouble.

“Did your date with the Chief go well?” Wyatt asked.

“Yes,” Candice replied.

“That’s good to hear. You guys are getting married on the 18th of next month. Nurture your relationship. I don’t want you to suffer.”

“I’ve already said that I don’t feel wronged.” Candice smiled. “A capable and handsome man like him doesn’t make me feel wronged at all.”

“That’s right,” Chloe suddenly interrupted. “Some people are just lucky. They have everything when they’re born and everything when they wake up. I don’t even know why my life is so different when we’re both born from the same parents! Candice, do you think God is biased, or…”

Chloe suddenly paused, before saying, “Parents are biased.”

“Chloe.” Claire gave her daughter a look, which meant to tell her not to spout nonsense.

Chloe could not care less. She said sarcastically, “I’m just complaining. Do I have to force myself to keep it in? If that’s the case, I won’t say anything in the future.”

“Chloe, stop talking.” Claire tugged at her daughter.

Chloe was in an extremely bad mood. Ever since Candice woke up, her status in the family had plummeted. She could not take this lying down at all.

Now, she could only say a few words and not say more?!

Chloe stood up from the sofa. “Since everyone doesn’t want to listen to me, I’ll go back to my room.”

“You little brat!” Claire was a little disappointed.

Chloe ignored Claire and left.

The hall was filled with an awkward air.

Claire held Candice’s hand. “Candice, don’t hold it against your sister. She didn’t mean it.”

“Okay.” Candice smiled.

Was it really though? She knew it best.

“It’s getting late. Wyatt darling, you should let Candice go back to her room to rest as soon as possible. She must be tired from her date with the Chief today,” Claire tried to smooth things over.

Wyatt nodded. “If there’s anything, you must tell me. Don’t carry everything yourself.”

“Okay.” Candice nodded.

The family went back to their respective rooms.

Back in her room, Candice took a shower and lay on the bed. Just like that, even after staying in the room for a month, it was still an extremely unfamiliar room.

She was wondering why she felt any sense of familiarity at all. No matter how short she had lived in her own home, she should be able to feel something.

However, she just felt… strange.

…

On the same night under the same sky, Monica was lying on the bed and playing with her phone. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Was Finn working overtime again tonight?!

He had not returned yet.

She looked at her phone in a daze.

If she was being honest, she even wondered if she had masochistic tendencies sometimes. She clearly did not want to see the news of Edward and Candice, but today, she kept harping on this news. From time to time, she would open it to browse the web if anyone had scolded Edward for being a sc*mbag. Every time she checked it, she would return disappointed.

On second thought, now that Edward was the Chief of Harken, who would dare to criticize him?

As long as it was not a matter of principles, then it was fine.

She was so angry that she decided to put down her phone. She was not planning to wait for Finn anymore. She had wanted to talk to him about the child tonight.

Sometimes, she felt that she and Finn lacked a tacit understanding.

Once something happened, he definitely could not see the other person’s point of view.

She was lying down and preparing to sleep when her phone suddenly rang.
