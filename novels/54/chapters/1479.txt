Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

She did not come here to live under the same roof as Candice.

Hence, early in the morning, Chloe secretly got out of bed. Since knew that

Edward would leave early every day, she had to fight for a chance for herself.

With that thought in mind, she set her alarm clock for 6 a.m. in the morning. Then, she tiptoed out of bed because afraid of waking someone up and went downstairs to the kitchen.

There was actually a kitchen on both sides — an open kitchen and a backyard kitchen. The open kitchen, which was not used as much, would be used to make snacks and drinks most of the time, while the actual kitchen was in the backyard.

Chloe walked into the kitchen in the backyard and prepared to make breakfast for Edward.

What did the saying go? To capture a man’s heart, one must first capture his stomach.

There was a time when she specially hired a chef to teach her how to make breakfast. Now that she had finally learned it, she had to put it to use. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Just as she walked into the kitchen, she saw a figure in the kitchen and frowned. In her opinion, Teddy was up too early. He would only go to bed late every night, yet he was up again at 6 a.m.

Chloe was annoyed. If she went in now, it would seem a little deliberate.

Moreover, she could tell that Teddy treated Candice pretty well after spending a few days with her. If she were to do it instead of Teddy, Teddy would definitely overthink, and it would not be worth it if he ruined her plan.

Chloe gritted her teeth. Just as she decided to leave, her eyes narrowed when she Teddy putting a small white pill from a box into the breakfast he was making. She did not think it was a tonic. If she remembered correctly, he would make Candice breakfast every day.

At that moment, Chloe’s heart raced, as if she had discovered a huge secret.

Then, her body jerked, and she hid to the side when she saw Teddy taking out the breakfast from the kitchen. As Chloe was hiding at the side, Teddy did not notice her.

After Teddy left, Chloe quickly ran into the kitchen and picked up the torn packaging from the trash can beside her. She nervously stuffed all the packaging into her pocket and left in a hurry, avoiding Teddy as she returned to her room.

Once she shut the door, she took out the pieces of the packaging and began to piece it together bit by bit.

As it was torn into pieces, Chloe wanted to give up several times. However, she believed that there must be something more to it, so she pieced it together patiently.

It took her a long time for her to complete it, and she looked at the packaging that she had pieced together. On it was a string of words, but she was afraid that she had pieced it together wrongly, so she checked them on her phone again.

Once she confirmed that the words on the box were “Emergency Contraception Pill, no side effects”, her heart was racing.

It meant that Teddy had been giving Candice emergency birth control pills. No, Teddy did not have the guts to make a move on the Leader, so it must be Edward, who did not want Candice to bear his child!

The thought of it excited Chloe.

In that case, Edward’s feelings for Candice were just that. They were not as loving and affectionate as they appeared on the surface. Perhaps Edward only treated Candice because of her father.

Her father was highly respected in Harken. Edward had just taken office, and his foundation was not strong enough yet. Hence, he must rely on her father, which was why he married Candice. In other words, Edward could have married either her or Candice, but since he was not around, he did not care.

At that thought, Chloe was overjoyed.

At first, she was still a little afraid because if Edward liked Candice so much, Edward might push her away if she tried to seduce him. However, now that she knew he did not like Candice at all, she did not have to worry about anything.

Chloe crumpled the wrapping paper into a ball and placed it on the bedside table. She was not in the mood to go back to sleep, so after getting out of bed and washing up, she opened the door and went out.

The moment she opened the door, she happened to see Paige walking barefoot to Candice’s room to look for her. She hurriedly went over. “Paige.”

She seemed very gentle and friendly.

Having been living here for the past few days, she understood what was going on. Paige was a little tyrant whom everyone doted on, and Candice tried her best to please her.

Since Candice treated Paige so well, it must be because Paige was very important to Edward. To know how to please a man, Candice was indeed not a simple woman..
