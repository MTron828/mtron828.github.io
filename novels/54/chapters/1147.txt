1148 Monica Risked Her Life To Save Finn

However, he forced himself to hold it in.

The car arrived at the hospital in no time, and Finn rushed into the operating theatre with Monica in his arms.

Everyone in the hospital was shocked by the blood all over Dr. Jones’s body and the woman who was covered in blood in his arms.

What was even more shocking was that the usually calm and emotionless Dr. Jones looked as if the sky had collapsed. It was as if the woman in his arms was his life.

He looked indescribably devastated.

After Monica was sent to the operating theatre by the doctors and nurses, the door of the operating theatre slammed shut.

Finn was standing stiffly at the door, with the Duncans’ men all standing respectfully by his side, not daring to make a sound.

The corridor was very quiet.

Amidst the silence, a nurse came over and asked carefully, “Dr. Jones, do you want me to treat your wound? I see that your hand is seriously injured, and the other parts of your body–”

“No need.” Finn refused.

The nurse wanted to say something else. However, when she saw Finn’s expression, she held her tongue and did not dare to say anything more. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The corridor fell silent again.

Time passed by, and eventually, the door of the operating theatre opened.

The surgeon walked out, looking very nervous.

Finn looked at him.

“Dr. Jones, the patient is bleeding internally and is in a coma now. Should we perform a craniotomy?” The doctor asked and then said, “But based on the current situation, I’m afraid that during the craniotomy process, she might–”

“Do the craniotomy.” Finn directly said, “The procedures will be handled later. If anything happens, I’ll be responsible for it.”

He could even pay with his life.

“However, I don’t have enough experience in craniotomy. I’ve asked the nurse to contact our specialist doctor, but since he’s on leave today, if he rushes over…” The doctor could not guarantee that Monica would be able to survive before the specialist doctor arrived.

Moreover, based on his experience and Monica’s current situation, even if they opened her head, they might not be able to stop the bleeding successfully. It might even accelerate her death.

“Help me change into my surgical gown,” Finn suddenly said.

“Dr. Jones...” The doctor was surprised.

Regardless of his current physical condition and the fact that his hands were in a terrible state, he was a cardiologist and not a surgeon.

According to the hospital’s rules, he was not qualified to perform that kind of surgery!

“I’ll open the head,” Finn said with certainty.

His voice was clear, and he did not seem to be joking.

“But Dr. Jones–”

“I said, I will bear all the consequences.” Finn enunciated each word.

Before the doctor could say anything, Finn instructed, “Go in and try your best to stabilize Monica’s condition as much as possible. I’ll come over as soon as I get changed.”

The doctor hesitated for a second.

However, that was the only way. If they did not deal with it effectively now, Monica would die.

Finn went to the doctor’s changing room and changed into his surgical gown. He then put on a pair of transparent surgical gloves on his bloody and ferocious-looking hands.

The nurse could feel the pain just by looking at it, yet Finn did not even frown.

With his clothes changed, he walked into the operating theatre.

He glanced at Monica’s pulse rate on the monitor and said calmly, “We’ll start the craniotomy for the patient now.”

Everyone in the operating theater listened to all his instructions.

It was extremely quiet inside the operating theatre. Only Finn’s instructions could be heard from time to time.

“Dr. Jones,” the assistant doctor suddenly called out to him.

He only saw after opening the head that there was a large blood clot in Monica’s brain and that blood clot was threatening Monica’s life. However, that blood clot was pressing on the central nervous system of her brain, so the risk of the operation was very high. If they were not careful, she could die in the operation.

Moreover, at that moment, it was obvious that Dr. Jones’s hand, which was holding the scalpel, was trembling uncontrollably.

The assistant doctor could not help but call out to him because of his trembling.

Finn put down the scalpel.

Everyone was looking at him.

If he gave up now, the patient in front of him would die without a doubt. However, no one dared to ask Dr. Jones to do it.

Even the highest-ranking surgeon in Harken would not dare to easily treat that blood clot, let alone Finn.

In such a quiet operating theater, Monica’s breath was getting weaker and weaker.
