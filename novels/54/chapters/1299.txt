1300 Candice and Monica’s Day Out

Monica was so nervous that her heart was about to explode.

The car soon arrived at the Nicholsons’ residence.

A woman stood at the door. She seemed to have been waiting for them for a while.

Sometimes, Monica felt that Candice was quite pitiful. To be precise, as long as a woman was in a relationship with Edward, she would be quite pitiful. She could only accommodate him at all times.

The car pulled up and Edward got out of the car. Monica followed suit.

Candice was a little surprised when she saw Monica. She had received notice early today that she was going to see Edward in the morning. She was surprised that she needed to see his friend so early—but now, she saw Monica.

Could it be that Edward and Monica had a good relationship?!

“Yesterday, you mentioned you weren’t familiar with South Hampton, so I got Monica to bring you around today,” Edward said bluntly.

So that was the reason. It was just a casual remark from her though.

“Monica will bring you around the city today,” Edward continued.

“Isn’t it too troublesome? I heard that Ms. Cardellini is actually a busy woman.”

Monica quickly shook her head. “No, no, I’m not. It’s my honor to be able to share the Chief’s burden. I’ll let go of anything. It’s fine.”

She seemed very enthusiastic, but her words were laced with sarcasm. It was obvious that she was unwillingly doing this.

Everyone could hear what she said but no one saw through it.

Edward could still say shamelessly while keeping his usual expression, “Monica, I’ll leave Candice to you.”

“Okay.”

“I have something to do, so I’ll leave first.”

“Take care.”

Edward returned to the car and left in a grandiose manner along with his entourage.

Monica cursed under her breath as she watched the car disappear.

She turned around and smiled at Candice. “Ms. Nicholson, where do you want to go?”

“Actually, I don’t really want to go anywhere.” Candice said, “How about I get out of your hair? You don’t have to accompany me. I can go around by myself. When the Chief asks, I’ll just say that you’re with me.”

“No, no. You’d better not lie to him. He has eagle eyes. Maybe he’ll be watching you everywhere.” Monica refused. “I’ll stroll around South Hampton with you today.”

Candice wanted to say something else.

Monica said directly, “Let me take you shopping first.”

“Huh?” Candice was surprised. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Don’t women like spending the most?” Monica asked seriously.

There was an evil thought in her heart. She wanted to bankrupt that Sc*mbag Swan’s family fortune.

“Oh, okay.” Candice nodded.

Might as well, even though she was not interested in anything but just going along with Monica.

Monica brought Candice to the most luxurious mall in the city.

Because she was too busy with work, she had not been shopping for a long time. When she saw the sparkling jewelry and beautiful clothes, she could not help but feel a little excited.

She took Candice to a high-end jewelry store and asked the shop assistant to take the most luxurious necklace inside. She asked Candice, “Do you like it?”

Candice shook her head.

“Don’t have to be frugal for the Chief. He has plenty of money.”

“I really don’t like it.”

“What about these?”

“There’s nothing I particularly like.”

“What about this one, this one, that one over there?”

Candice felt that if she did not satisfy Monica’s shopping needs, she would not be able to leave.

For some reason, this was clearly a little forceful on her but she did not hate it at all.

Instead, she felt an inexplicable sense of closeness to Monica.

“This one.” Candice pointed at one randomly.

“Alright, I’ll take this one. I’ll swipe my card.” Monica was afraid that Candice would go back on her word, so she quickly asked the shop assistant to settle the bill.

Then, the two of them went to the clothing section upstairs.

A dazzling array of clothes could be seen everywhere.

Candice felt that Monica was not here to buy clothes but to stock up a whole inventory of hers.

She did not pay more than a glance at the clothes but simply took one of each design of different colors.

Candice had a feeling that Monica was deliberately taking revenge on Edward.

At the thought of this, she could not help but giggle. For some reason, she felt that Monica’s mood was very likable.

After a round of sweeping and just as Monica was about to bring Candice to buy a bag, Candice suddenly stopped in her tracks. “Monica.”

She blurted out to Monica by her first name. It felt really natural too when she said it.

“What’s the matter?” Monica noticed how Candice addressed her.

She did not like this woman initially because at the thought of this woman snatching Jeanne’s man, she was instinctively repulsed.

...

However, after some interaction with her, she did not seem to be able to hate Candice.

She was also irritated by this fact. With so much internal struggle, retail therapy was her outlet. And it was a very satisfying one too.

“I want to take a look at the children’s clothes over there,” Candice said.

“Children’s clothes?”

“Doesn’t the Chief have two children?” Candice asked.

Monica pursed her lips. She looked at Candice and walked into a children’s clothing store nearby. She followed slowly.

Candice was choosing the clothes carefully. It was completely different from how she just looked like a tycoon just now. Candice’s serious attitude suddenly touched Monica for some reason.

It was just that… George had not had a mother for so many years. Would he want one now?

“Does this look good?” Candice chose a boy’s jacket.

With just one glance, Monica felt that it was a perfect fit for George.

She nodded. “It looks pretty good.”

...

“This one then. Wrap up the underwear, pants, and shoes,” Candice said to the shop assistant.

“Alright,” the assistant said respectfully.

“Let’s go see the girls again.” Candice walked to the girls’ section.

Little girl’s clothes were especially cute.

Candice was dazzled by the pink and chubby outfits, beautiful hair clips, shoes, handbags, and so on.

“Are you willing to be a stepmother?” Monica suddenly asked.

It was when she saw Candice choosing the clothes that she inexplicably felt that she had a natural maternal aura.

Did they not say that she grew up in the army?!

Should she not be valiant?!

“When you know you have no choice, you can only accept it.” Candice smiled.

She was not displeased by Monica’s unpleasant tone.
