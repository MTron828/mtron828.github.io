Chapter 1554: Monica Gives In to Finn (They Make Up)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Very well, sir.”

Monica looked at how excited Finn was… She admitted that she had acted on impulse.

After settling in, the hotel’s dedicated butler brought the three of them to their presidential suites.

Brandon watched helplessly as Finn and Monica walked into a room. He even wondered whether he was here to be a third wheel or to assist! He was furious!

In the suite, Monica was really tired. After such a long flight, she lay on the bed the moment she returned to her room, not wanting to move. On the contrary, Finn started to unpack his luggage as soon as he walked into the room.

Finn only had a few pieces of clothing in his suitcase, and they took up very little space. The rest of his huge suitcase was filled with professional medical equipment, which was clearly prepared for her.

Monica closed her eyes to rest, pretending not to see it.

After Finn unpacked his luggage, he asked Monica, “What’s the passcode for your luggage?”

“What’s wrong?”

“I’ll get your pajamas out for you while you go take a shower.”

“There’s no need. You can go take a shower. I can do it myself.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Monica was speechless.

Finn knew that Monica would only set the simplest password, and that had not changed for many years.

He opened the suitcase, took out all of Monica’s clothes, and put them neatly into the cabinet. He even put her undergarments into a drawer.

Coincidentally, Monica propped herself up and got up, intending to take her clothes to take a shower. The earlier she took a shower, the earlier she could go to bed and rest. After all, they were going to discuss a collaboration tomorrow.

As soon as she walked into the cloakroom, she saw Finn staring at her undergarments in a daze. Feeling a little embarrassed, Monica went forward and took a pair of underwear and a set of pajamas.

Finn pursed his lips in response, but he also took a pair of shorts and a set of pajamas.

Monica took a shower first, and after she came out of the shower, she went to lie on the bed. It was only then that Finn walked into the bathroom to take a shower.

By the time he was done with his shower, Monica had already fallen asleep. She had been sleeping especially well recently.

Finn hesitated for a few seconds before he lay down on the big bed in the room. Upon noticing him, Monica’s body tensed up a little. In fact, she was just pretending to be asleep. At that moment, she felt Finn approach her and pull her into his embrace.

Before Monica could tell him not to hug her, she heard Finn say in her ear,

“Monica, I love you.”

That one sentence made her hold her tongue for the entire night. When she woke up the next day, it was already 9 a.m. in the morning. The appointment was at 10.?30 a.m. in the morning, so it was almost time to get up.

Monica tried to twist her body out of Finn’s embrace. Finn was hugging her too tightly, but her resistance only made the person behind her hug her even tighter.

His entire body was pressed against hers. She could even feel…

With her face blushing, she said, “Let go of me. I have a meeting to go to later.” “Yes,” Finn replied. However, he did not move.

“Finn, if you keep acting like this, we won’t stay in the same room for the rest of this trip.”

A certain someone quickly let go of her, and Monica found it funny. Since when did Finn become so easily threatened by her?

Monica lifted the blanket and got out of bed. Finn naturally got out of bed with her, and the two of them walked into the bathroom one after the other.

When Monica stopped in her tracks, Finn also did the same. “I need to go to the toilet.” Monica turned around and glared at him.

“I’ll accompany you.”

Monica was at a loss for words.

“I’ll wait for you outside.” Finn hurriedly corrected himself. Then, he walked out of the bathroom.

Monica watched as the bathroom door was closed. She thought, ‘Will it be like this from now on?’

From taking the initiative to “invite” him to Casterbridge to tacitly allowing him to stay in the same room, Monica had, in fact, given in to Finn..
