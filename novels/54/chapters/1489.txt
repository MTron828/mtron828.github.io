“Ow!” Paige screamed and said, “Mom, it hurts here too.”

Then, she pulled Candice’s hand and moved it to the side. “Do you want to go to the toilet, Paige?” Candice asked.

“I will take you to the toilet.”

“No, it hurts.”

“Be good.” Candice hugged Paige.

Paige was in so much pain that tears streamed down her face.

Chloe quickly pulled Candice back and asked anxiously, “Sis, should we send

Paige to the hospital?”

“No need. I think she just ate something bad and needs to go to the toilet.”

“You didn’t even take her to see a doctor. How do you know she just has a stomachache?”

“Because I know you gave Paige ice cream early in the morning before she had breakfast. It must’ve caused a reaction in her stomach.”

“What if it’s not? How can you be so hasty to decide? Do you not love Paige? Is your relationship with Paige superficial? You’re not a doctor. If something happens to Paige-”

Candice ignored Chloe’s nonsense and pushed her away. As her push was quite strong, Chloe was pushed a few steps back. It stunned the tutor and the others, but no one dared to say a word. Candice simply carried Paige to the washroom without caring about Chloe.

Chloe looked at Candice with an ugly expression. She thought about it for a moment before she walked to the side and picked up the phone to make a call.

It was a call to Edward. She had seen the number on her father’s phone once and had secretly saved it.

After a while, the call went through.

Chloe said agitatedly, “Edward, come back quickly. Paige’s stomach hurts. It’s very serious. You should come back now to take a look.”

“Where’s Candice?”

“She’s with Paige. Come back quickly.” She sounded so anxious. It was as if

something big had happened. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The other party hung up the phone abruptly.

When Chloe saw the words “call ended”, she smiled wickedly. She refused to believe that Edward did not care about Candice’s arbitrary way of treating Paige.

Inside the toilet, Candice put Paige on the small toilet and said to Paige, “Paige, you have to be brave. Try to poop. Just poop it out.” “Mom, I don’t need to poop. I just have a stomachache.”

“Will you listen to me?”

“No. You’re horrible, Mommy.”

“Be good. I will accompany you to poop.” Candice comforted Paige.

Seeing that she could not be willful, Paige could only listen to her mother and try to poop.

“Mom, my stomach hurts.”

“That’s because there are bugs in your stomach. Paige, you just have to poop out the bugs—”

“Boohoo…” Paige was sobbing uncontrollably.

Actually, Candice’s heart was aching too, but she had just done a basic checkup on Paige.

It was not appendicitis, nor was it gastric. It was just a simple stomachache, and it was a sudden, acute pain. Coupled with the ice cream that Paige ate early in the morning, she could basically conclude that Paige had eaten something bad. The fastest way to solve the stomachache was to go to the toilet. Once Paige pooped, there would not be much of a problem. Of course, if she continued to have diarrhea, she would have to be sent to the hospital, but not now.

She accompanied Paige in the bathroom and guided her to poop.

Actually, Paige was resistant to pooping, and she could tell that the little girl had never suffered any pain since she was young. At that moment, the pain in her stomach was unbearable.

“Mom, I don’t want to poop. I want to see a doctor. I want Uncle Finn to come and see me…” Paige started making a scene again.

“Peggy, be good. If you poop now, I’ll get Uncle Finn to come and see you.”

“Mommy, you’re horrible.”

“Be good.”

“I want Daddy.” Paige cried aggrievedly.

“Paige, if you keep doing this, Mom really won’t like it.”

Paige looked at Candice with tears in her eyes.

“You have to be a brave and strong child. You can’t cry so easily. Look at how serious your brother’s injury was, and he didn’t cry. If you can’t be brave and you only have a stomachache… I don’t think I like children like that.” Paige’s big eyes were teary, and she looked extremely pitiful.

“Be good. You must poop now,” Candice said sternly to Paige.

There was no room for negotiation, and Paige knew she could not dissuade Candice. Although she was against pooping at the start, she seemed to be trying now..
