Mo Fan did not hover above the sea for too long. It was not like he didn’t want to contribute to the battle anymore, but he might have caught the attention of some powerful sea monsters after using such a strong Shadow Spell.

The horde of sea monsters obviously had quite a number of Commander-level sea monsters. There might even be more Ruler-level creatures there. His Lightning Magic had already depleted, and his Shadow Element had just had a breakthrough. He had not learned how to draw the Shadow Star Palace, so it was unlikely he would stand a chance against a Ruler-level sea monster!

The Dark Execution Ground had beheaded at least nine hundred Scarlet Soaring Demons. The spell had greatly reduced the size of the army of sea monsters and lifted the pressure from the shoulders of the military at Gaoqi Airport.

“Let’s go back to the library,” Mo Fan said.

“Alright...” Biling maintained her altitude as she followed Mo Fan back to the library.

Fierce waves were still rolling below them. They looked like sand dunes moving forward rapidly. Mo Fan did not have the chance to familiarize himself with his potential new spell after his Shadow Element reached the Super Level. The Dark Execution Ground was actually just a variation of the Plaza of Death, established with the energy of the Dark Moon Crystal. It was not actually a Super Spell!

“Strange, I keep feeling like something is watching us!” Mo Fan looked behind them anxiously.

He purposely glanced in Qiu Zi’s direction. The creature was far away from him. Mo Fan was a little confused. Why was he feeling so uneasy?

It felt extremely strange. It was not like he had sensed something was hiding nearby, nor were his instincts telling him that he was being preyed on based on his experience. He did not notice anything out of ordinary, either. Mo Fan had never felt like this before. He was unsure where the feeling had come from.

A gray shadow suddenly burst out from the water below. It sprang up like a phantom and almost instantly reached Mo Fan’s altitude.

Mo Fan was taken by surprise. Even though he was already on alert in case some powerful sea monsters showed up, being on alert was not necessarily enough to guarantee his safety. He could not even see the shadow clearly because of its incredible speed.

“Shadow Partition!”

The thought suddenly came out of nowhere when Mo Fan was in danger.

Mo Fan spread his arms apart like he was acting subconsciously. He somehow disappeared as he sank into a dark layer of shadow!

The sea monster slammed into the dim screen. It was just a thin layer of shadow, but to Mo Fan’s surprise, the sea monster simply went right through it. He was just like a mere reflection in the sky, and the sea monster had gone right through his body, but it did not harm him in the slightest.

Mo Fan turned around and saw the Ruler-level creature behind him.

He managed to get a close look at the Ruler-level sea monster. It was the same species as the Scarlet Soaring Demons, but the difference was that it had a metallic dark green skin. Its back was covered in extended coral-like crests. It was standing upright, but its upper limbs were like blades, while its lower limbs were built like the legs of a frog!

The creature did not have a very outstanding appearance. It was just as ugly as the Scarlet Rending Demons, but the coral-like crests on its back were astonishing. They clearly displayed how dangerous the creature was, as they corresponded to its noble status in its tribe!

“Mo Fan, are you alright?” Biling was terrified. She initially thought the creature had shredded Mo Fan to pieces.

Mo Fan looked at Biling and realized the danger she was in. He quickly yelled to warn her, “Go now, this thing is a Ruler-level creature!”

Biling had stopped because she wanted to help. To their surprise, the Ruler-level creature with coral reef fins immediately switched targets. It was supposed to be falling in the air, yet it managed to propel itself in a new direction with its powerful lower limbs!

Its kick slammed against the air, forcing a strong gust of wind at the sea. The force launched the Ruler-level creature higher into the air, like a menacing ray of light!

Biling immediately realized she was in danger. She quickly beat her wings to fly higher.

Mo Fan felt like his heart was on fire as he watched this.

He had used an ability he had learned out of nowhere to dodge the deadly strike from the Coral Fins Ruler, but Biling did not have the chance to dodge it. The Ruler-level creature was extremely cunning. It had switched targets as soon as it failed to kill Mo Fan first!

Fresh blood squirted like a fountain, dying the rain red.

Mo Fan was on the other side of the Dark Partition, like he was separated from reality. There was nothing he could do, as he could not even use his other Elements.

Mo Fan was infuriated by the scene before him when he returned from the Dark Partition.

A pair of legs covered in blood fell from the sky. They were cut off around fifteen centimeters above the knees, and belonged to Biling.

Biling’s legs had been severed. Her cry amid the rain was heart-wrenching. Her blood mixed with the rain was pouring down right in front of Mo Fan.

“Die!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Mo Fan was enraged. The meridians of the dark magic scattered across his body were activated suddenly!

A bolt of white lightning flashed across the dim sky and lit up the raindrops. The light it produced reflected Mo Fan’s shadow.

The shadow was oddly visible in the curtain of rain. It spread together with Mo Fan’s Dark Magic and went from the length of a normal human being to the size of the clouds!

The shadow caught up to the Coral Fins Ruler, which was still trying to attack the woman, and transformed into an elder of the Shadow Tribe!

A Shadow Tribe Elder was a rank higher than a Dark Swordmaster. Mo Fan did not just summon a weak rebelling shadow like he normally did. This was a true dominating entity from the Dark Plane!

The Shadow Tribe Elder was just like most phantoms. Its lower body was like a puff of smoke, but its upper body was a dozen times thicker. The Shadow Tribe Elder waved its hands at one another after sensing Mo Fan’s wrath.

The Coral Fins Ruler tried to escape after it became aware of the approaching danger. However, when it looked around it, it noticed the Shadow Tribe Elder’s hands were as enormous as the sky. It had no chance of escaping the hands, no matter how quick it was!

BANG!

The force was utterly terrifying. The Coral Fins Ruler was smashed between the hands. It began screaming an unpleasant cry in pain!
