2983 The Archangel of Murder

Shalitha was an Angel of Force. He was a killing angel!

He had to kill Mo Fan today! The heretic had to be put to death by Shalitha inside the Twin Guardian Towers. So, he had to blow up the towers!

Shalitha did not want to give Mo Fan more time!

Mo Fan had just become the Wicked God. Shalitha still considered Mo Fan an infant in terms of power.

But the moment Mo Fan digested all the evil energy, the magic elements inside his body would break through the Forbidden Curse. By then, he would truly become the king of the Wicked God and would be powerful enough to kill an Archangel!

“Are you sure you’re not playing with fire?” Mo Fan stared at the furious Shalitha. He sneered. “Thank you for helping me become who I am today. Since you regard me so highly and even used the Red Demon Kazuaki to set me up, I won’t let you down.”

“It has to be Gabriel! It must be Gabriel! She’s a stupid and ignorant woman!” It was only then that Shalitha came to understand how Mo Fan had learned of the oath.

“How can you say that about her? You’re the one who told her about the Red Demon and hinted to her to reveal the information to me. Sharjah did everything according to your order. I also did everything as you had arranged. What else are you still dissatisfied with?” said Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue was exiled. Xinxia’s election path was obstructed.

Mo Fan also never believed he could be secure. In fact, someone set up a trap for him shortly after he concluded his cultivation behind the locked door.

The truth was, when he stepped into the Holy City and met Sharjah, he had never suspected her to set him up.

It was not until the appearance of the Archangel Shalitha that Mo Fan believed he had most likely been betrayed by Sharjah. She was in cahoots with other Archangels and wanted to send him to his death.

Before he departed, Sharjah told him something in a foreign language. Mo Fan had not understood the intent of that language at first. At this moment, Mo Fan finally understood. He had run out of options a long time ago.

The Holy City rejected a Demon Element Mage. They would not allow a demon to summon the Sacred Totem Azure Dragon.

Even Commander Hua and Chairman Shao Zheng had repeatedly warned him to not appear on the east coastline or get involved with the Ocean Demons’ battle.

Still, Mo Fan could not bear to leave the Magic City alone in its crisis. He became the savior of the city and was in the limelight for a while. He transformed into a demon in front of the entire crowd. As a result, the Holy City had already decided to target him.

The Holy City gave an absolute death order.

Even Sharjah had to cooperate with them, and she became a stepping stone for the killing angel—Shalitha.

Mo Fan knew he would dabble into the realm of the Forbidden Curse sooner or later. But he had not expected the people from the Holy City to eagerly look forward to his progress. They could not even wait to help Mo Fan to gain the Forbidden Curse so that they could kill him!

They wanted to see Mo Fan fight back. If he did, they could claim that he was a rogue demon who had gone insane and attacked the angels of the Holy City. By then, everyone would be convinced that he was against the Holy City.

‘Fine!’ Mo Fan would agree to go to the Holy City with them. He was willing to oblige with their plans because he needed time.

He needed more time to allow the demonic Wicked God inside his body to become stronger. He had become very powerful. But the survival of the Twin Guardian Towers still depended on him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

If he decided to fight with Shalitha, the tower would be destroyed instantly.

Shalitha would make a big deal out of the fact that he was the Wicked God and that the Red Demon Kazuaki’s sins would be transferred to him even if he managed to escape the death angel.

Many times, people did not care about the truth.

The moment they were told that the Red Demon Kazuaki “worked” for Mo Fan, his reputation would be tainted. His country might still side with him, but the rest of the countries in the world would be against him.

If Mo Fan were to fight Shalitha, he would not show him any mercy. But this was not the right time to fight Shalitha.

‘Just like Ozawa…,’ thought Mo Fan.

Although Ozawa knew the truth and had a strong urge to fight all the Blood Demons in the court, he still held back. He knew that his anger and recklessness would jeopardize everyone.

Mo Fan was ready for battle. He needed to be as calm as Ozawa. He needed the help of the public. If he could reveal the truth to them, he would not have to face the war alone. He still had faith in those who trusted him.

Therefore, Mo Fan gave up on fighting back.

He still trusted Sharjah.

She had not been able to tell him everything. Although Mo Fan was seemingly at a dead end, she had tried very hard to allow him a route of escape until the end.

…

Mo Fan’s surrender infuriated Shalitha.

Mo Fan’s decision to submit to the Holy City’s judgment proved that, despite appearances, he was not hostile to the Holy City. He respected the Holy City, and he agreed to its summons of judgment.

Under this situation, the Holy City had to consider a lot of factors, especially the public opinion and the truth.

If Mo Fan could prove that the Red Demon Kazuaki’s crime had nothing to do with him, then he would not be considered a heretic that had to be exterminated.

If China wanted to recover from the Ocean Demons’ damage, they would not allow Mo Fan to be mistreated. If the people from the Holy City could not find something to convict Mo Fan, they had to release him.

It was easy for the Holy City to convict him. Even the Holy Saint, Wen Tai, had been executed. Still, they did not want to drag the issue for long. After all, they had personally sent Mo Fan to the path of becoming a powerful Wicked God!

‘Playing with fire…’

Shalitha finally understood.

“Hmph! Do you really think you can escape just like that?! When you reach the Holy City, you will most certainly be put to death!” Shalitha’s tone changed. He no longer sounded as cold as before. His tone conveyed some feelings.

Shalitha had never expected Mo Fan to pull this trick. ‘Was the demonic Wicked God truly an infant?’

The “infant” was born with divine power. The world would be in danger if he continued to exist.

“I believe the people from the Holy City would judge me fairly,” said Mo Fan calmly.

The corners of Shalitha’s lips twitched. It was clear that he was suppressing his inner fury.

“A fair judgment? My judgment means justice!” Shalitha’s tone was strange.

He vehemently objected to any adjustments being made. He wouldn’t let anything get in the way of his plan. Even if Mo Fan agreed to accompany him without a struggle, he wouldn’t accept the result!

Shalitha’s face changed. His emotions changed from irritation to indifference. His indifference was tinged with arrogance. It was as if the world was nothing to him. He could choose whatever he wanted to do!

His iris turned golden.

It appeared as though the additional dimension in the sky had evolved into a Space Mutated Beast. It raised its claw, which had the power to obliterate both heaven and earth. Its claw was bigger than a cloudy mass. The Twin Guardian Towers were in its line of sight.

It was the Dimensional Destructive Claw! How could mortals stand against such strength?

“What are you doing?!” Mo Fan shouted.
