Chapter 1527 Mistaking the Shadow of a Bow in a Cup as a Snake

Translated by XephiZ

The group of people sat in the hall of the hotel, grim looks on their faces.

Ferrero still wanted to accuse Mo Fan and the others, but Mentor Vani knew it was meaningless to argue any further. He said, “It’s no use blaming one another here. We should find a way to get rid of the Curse as soon as possible. Chad, you’re more familiar with things around here, you should know more about the Medusae than us. You’re our hope in getting rid of the Curse.”

“I don’t really know much about it,” Chad sighed.

The Medusae were too mysterious. There were even rumors about how the Medusae could speak the human tongue. Their intelligence was on par with humans. The Curse of the eyes of the snakes was a great power that no human had probed into before.

“Tell us what you know. I’m afraid the Curse is only going to worsen from here,” Zoey urged him.

“The Mother of Snakes, Medusa, is the mother of every snake in Egypt. Apparently, she was a Curse Mage, but during her time, the Curse Element was not accepted by the public yet. People claimed that the Curse Mages would bring misfortunes upon them, so they offered Medusa to the God of Snakes, Nehebkau. To their surprise, Nehebkau did not kill Medusa, but mated with her instead, giving birth to the Medusae that are stronger than the snake demons and are capable of using magic. The Medusae treated Medusa as their leader, and the God of Snakes became her subordinate instead. Medusa has a strong hatred of humans, and it combined with her ancient Curse Magic, granting her the scariest eyes in the world... it is known as the strongest Psychic Power, the Medusa’s Stare!

“Every high-level female snake has inherited the Medusa’s eyes. Their vengeful stare possesses Medusa’s great power. Once we are marked by it, even killing the creature that placed us under the Curse won’t get rid of it! It is why I keep telling you, it’s unlikely for anyone to survive the Curse,” Chad finished, telling them everything he knew.

“What did you say? Even killing that creature that placed us under the Curse won’t get rid of it?” Ferrero started yelling again. It grabbed the attention of the people in the hall.

Mo Fan was stunned too.

Normally, killing the creature responsible for the Curse was enough to lift it. He did not expect the Eyes of Vengeance to be a Curse applied by the whole species. Wouldn’t that mean they were forever under the Curse unless they killed the Mother of Snakes, Medusas?

-The Mother of Snakes, Medusa?-

Mo Fan recalled how he had stumbled into a Scorpion Lord Medusa when he was fighting the undead from the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Wasn’t the Scorpion Lord Medusa still a level lower than the Mother of Snakes Medusa?

Medusae were snake women, but the Scorpion Lord Medusa from the Gorgons had the lineage of the Scorpion Queen. It should be a level lower than the real Snake Lord Medusae or the Mother of Snakes Medusa.

Either way, Mo Fan did not see the Mother of Snakes Medusa among the undead from the Great Pyramid of Giza. Perhaps Khufu could not even command the Mother of Snakes Medusa, as she might be on the same level as him!

If the Curse originated from the Mother of Snakes Medusa, wasn’t that the same as injecting them with a poison that had no antidote, and there was nothing they could do but to wait for their death as the poison fully spread inside their bodies?

“I don’t know the way of getting rid of the Curse, but I do know that killing the big female Medusa isn’t going to work,” Chad stated confidently.

“So we are just waiting to die now?” Vani said helplessly.

“There must be a way, just stay at the hotel for now and don’t go anywhere. I heard that someone knows how to deal with the Eyes of Vengeance. I’m not sure if the old man is still alive, but he’s here in Cairo,” Chad said.

“What are we waiting for then? Go find him now!” Ferrero urged.

“Wait here, I’ll go ask,” Chad said.

Chad left with his brother Benz. The rest of the group sat on the couch in the hall with grim looks. They all remained silent.

“I didn’t expect to be stuck on the same boat as these guys. I seriously don’t want to see them around,” Zhao Manyan grumbled. It sounded like he was more disgusted by them than the Curse.

“Do you really think we want to see you guys either!?” Galba retorted angrily.

They went from traveling together happily to being disgusted at one another, and now finding themselves like ants stuck on the same robe because of the Eyes of Vengeance...

“I’ll get some water for you all,” the manager of the hotel came over with a smile and placed some cups on the table. He bent forward and poured some water for Vani.

Vani did not care to stop him, and happened to feel a little thirsty, too. He picked up the cup to drink the water, but he was shocked to see something wriggling in the water like a worm!

“Snake, snake, there’s a snake in it!” Vani tossed the cup away as he surged to his feet. He was going to slap the manager in the face.

However, his hand froze in the air. He stared at the water and the broken cup on the ground...

Everyone stared at Vani in shock. Vani shook his head and picked up the broken pieces of the cup.

“There’s nothing at all, what the hell are you screaming for?” Zhao Manyan said angrily.

“I swear I saw it... maybe I imagined it. I’m sorry,” Mentor Vani slumped into the couch and rubbed his face to wake himself.

“It must be the Curse. We’ll imagine stuff and spook ourselves once we lack focus,” Mo Fan noted after seeing Vani’s reaction.

“This goddamned Curse!”

It was obvious that the symptoms were not restricted to when they closed their eyes to sleep or meditate. As time passed, the Curse would spread to the things around them. Even the grass and the trees would look like snakes to them. They had nowhere to run to...

“Heidi, can you tie your hair up?” Zhao Manyan suddenly asked in a soft voice.

Heidi did not get it at first. However, she helplessly tied her hair up with a rubber band when she saw the terrified and pleading look on Zhao Manyan’s face, and held it in place with a hairpin.

“Zhao Manyan, at this rate, you won’t even dare to look down when you pee,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Bullshit, my thing is like a cannon, there’s no way I’ll make a mistake of it!” Zhao Manyan immediately retorted.

Even when everyone was sitting together in a circle without moving, they still did not feel safe. It was the weirdest and most torturous Curse that Mo Fan had ever encountered!
