Dunhuang City...

To the north of the city was the Dunhuang City’s military headquarters. As a strange heat wave surged across the place, the higher-ups in the headquarters immediately held an emergency meeting.

The authorities immediately gathered at the round table. A tanned man with a huge army cap stood in the middle, holding some fresh information he had just received.

“According to my men’s report, a huge Fire Calamity has just occurred in the North Burning Valley, eliminating countless creatures residing in the valley...” said the tanned Commander.

Upon hearing this, the rest of the Commanders in the meeting were filled with joy.

How could they possibly not know about the North Burning Valley, after spending such a long time at Dunhuang? Although the biggest threat to Dunhuang City was the Dunhuang Demon Tigers, even the Hunters who were not stationed here for a long time knew that the North Burning Valley separated by the Drifting Sand River was a mysterious barren land, with countless unimaginable resources and treasure.

Due to the difficulty of crossing the Drifting Sand River, the North Burning Valley was unspoiled, with many resources waiting to be retrieved.

In addition to that, it was said that the North Burning Valley had a unique event, occurring after a Fire Calamity took place. The baptism of fire would trigger the growth of resources, like sprouting bamboo shoots after a rain. Not only would it increase the value of any existing resources, it would also produce new valuable materials...

The Fire Calamity was a symbol of death, considered the most terrifying wrath of nature, yet to those who had survived the calamity, what awaited them in the North Burning Valley was a grand feast for them to enjoy thoroughly!

“Why are we wasting our time here? I’ll move out at once with my men!” An impatient Commander slammed his hand on the table and rose to his feet like a spring.

No one knew more about how profitable the North Burning Valley was than them.

“What men? Who’s going to defend the city? Allow me to explore the place. After all, I’m more familiar with the place than you old men who have stayed indoors for a very long time,” said a male Commander in his thirties, who seemed to have a wild temperament.

“Enough, I’ll decide who we’re sending, there’s no point of fighting over it. Besides, it’s obvious that the Magic Association will be sending someone over too, not to mention the old elite Hunters from the Hunter Union. Perhaps they have already packed their bags and are now figuring out how they will cross the Drifting Sand River while we’re still discussing who to send here...” said the tanned Commander.

Everyone calmed down when the Drifting Sand River was mentioned.

The Drifting Sand River was a strange place. When the presence of the invaders was higher, it was easier to wake up more and stronger White Sand Demons, and having more people would not necessarily solve the issue...

Throughout history, no one had dared to fight the Drifting Sand River with numbers. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Therefore, those who were sent to the North Burning Valley had to be fairly outstanding, their strength only the secondary factor. Most importantly, they had to be able to protect themselves in the North Burning Valley.

The ones who arrived at the North Burning Valley earlier would find more resources. Time was gold!

The Dunhuang City’s headquarters was different from the other headquarters. They did not have any Heavenly Eagles Battlemages, as the Heavenly Eagles were unfit to survive in this environment. They would have to shed all their feathers in the heat.

The absence of Heavenly Eagles also meant that they were no Beastmasters, which further meant that there were no Magicians with the Psychic Element. They would have to spend a fortune to hire a Psychic Magician now...

The experienced Hunters in the Hunter Union were able to get the latest information fairly quickly. Every Psychic Magician in the entire Dunhuang City was most likely reserved by now. The military could not afford to wait any further. If they were left with no choice, they could only drive their way across the Drifting Sand River with brute force!

Either way, they could not let the other factions get a head start, as all the good stuff would be taken away!

—————

“I heard that this Fire Calamity only appears once every few years in the North Burning Valley, and the scale of those in the past wasn’t as big as this one. Now that we’ve managed to escape from the Fire Calamity, it should be very safe for us to head into the North Burning Valley. Most importantly, the Fire Calamity is like a baptism for the North Burning Valley, which either kills or drives away the creatures without pure fire lineages. As a result, the North Burning Valley would be filled with lots of valuable resources after the baptism,” said Chen Yi.

It seemed like Chen Yi was hoping that the party would not give up here.

Mo Fan and Lingling quickly fixed their eyes on Chen Yi with a suspicious look.

Mo Fan had only learned about the North Burning Valley from the Secret Tipping Scrolls. Not many people knew the details of the place.

Meanwhile, Lingling was like a library herself. She could easily find lots of information from her laptop. Lingling had the ambition of collecting the most complete information about demon beasts and forbidden lands, hence she would always record her new findings in her laptop.

Even Lingling had never heard about the Fire Calamity of the North Burning Valley. Why would Chen Yi, who had suddenly decided to join the team, know about it in detail?

“Why are you looking at me like that... I’ve done some homework before coming here,” Chen Yi was obviously not very good at scheming, as her tone weakened after realizing how they were looking at her.

“Someone from my family must have visited this place before,” Zhao Manyan justified his cousin’s explanation.

“You mentioned that more treasure will be produced after the place has received the baptism of the Fire Calamity. Is that true?” Lingling asked sternly.

Chen Yi nodded after a moment of hesitation.

“The Fire Calamity turns the North Burning Valley into a fertile land, and it goes without saying that once the outside world knows the North Burning Valley has just gone through a huge Fire Calamity, those who know the secret will come here to hunt for the treasure. Therefore, most people are unwilling to share the secret of the fire tribulation,” said Chen Yi.

The Fire Calamity indeed felt like the wrath of God toward mankind. Not only did the spectacular fire produced by nature have a strong scent of death, but its overwhelming energy was also pouring into this brazier-shaped land...

Many unique plants, magic ores, Soul Seeds, and so forth were produced by nature after it had absorbed energy. Perhaps the Fire Calamity was seen as a terrifying disaster to creatures who were not purely Fire-Elemental, but it was definitely irrigation to some of the unique existences!

Magic Resources were extremely valuable, so it was not exaggerating to describe the North Burning Valley after going through the Fire Calamity as a land full of gold!
