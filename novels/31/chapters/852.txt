Rules, of course there must be rules!

Sayed was not familiar with the character of these Chinese. What if they didn’t admit their defeat after he beat five of their representatives? Didn’t that mean he had to take on everyone else? Even though he wasn’t afraid of being tired out if that was his opponents’ tactic, he still found it annoying!

“You’re definitely the most annoying foreigner I have ever met,” said Bai Dongwei blatantly.

“Oh, thanks,” Sayed was not bothered at all by the remark. He actually returned the favor.

“You can set the rules,” said Bai Dongwei.

“Do your words count?” asked Sayed.

“Nonsense, I’m the instructor here. If you apologize for your arrogant behavior and bring the rest of your team here to challenge us, I will consider giving you the badge based on your sincerity. I, Bai Dongwei, am in charge here!” snapped Bai Dongwei furiously.

“No chance I’m apologizing. I didn’t do anything wrong. If I can set the rules, say, how about I hold the stage, and you can send three people to challenge me. They can fight me at the same time, or take turns to fight me. If I lose to any of them, it means I’ve failed the challenge. Otherwise, you will give me the stamp immediately. I’m really in a rush here,” claimed Sayed.

“How smug of you!” Bai Dongwei was so furious that he almost started cursing the man’s ancestors.

However, before he could speak, Mu Nujiao immediately stopped him, “Instructor Bai, don’t sweat it. If he’s so confident, it might imply that his abilities are useful when fighting multiple people or in prolonged fights. If those are the rules he asked for, we are willing to accept them.”

“How is that acceptable? If we win, he will accuse us of abusing our numbers. I’m not a fan of unfair duels. It doesn’t even feel good if we win. The challenges should be fair and just. If we can’t maintain our integrity, it will destroy our national team’s morale when they are competing with other countries!” replied Bai Dongwei.

“Instructor Bai, Mu Nujiao is right, we shouldn’t take the bait. He might be provoking us. If we simply let Dongfang Lie fight him, we might be giving the challenging stamp away too easily once again if Dongfang Lie loses the duel,” said another defender of the National Training Hall.

Bai Dongwei calmed down after hearing the student’s advice.

If the guy was indeed provoking them, he might have some weird capabilities to guarantee his victory over Dongfang Lie. Not only would they give the challenging stamp away, they would feel utterly sulky from the loss, too.

However, a group fight would greatly limit his advantages. A one-on-one duel was too unpredictable. For example, a Psychic Magician was basically unbeatable among Magicians at the same level. It was common for people to lose against a Psychic Magician without even casting a single spell.

“If you think it’s unacceptable, how about four... or five, you can have five people. It will waste too much of my time if it’s over five, and it won’t be a glorious win for you either, right?” Sayed grinned.

“Three, three is enough. If you can defeat them, I’ll hand over the stamp immediately!” said Bai Dongwei, while clenching his teeth.

Bai Dongwei agreed with Mu Nujiao as he calmed down. Their opponent must have something up his sleeves if he was acting so confidently. Dongfang Lie and the others were not weak, but their fighting style was too predictable, so they would easily be outsmarted in a duel. They were the ones that would suffer if they ended up giving the challenge stamps away too easily.

The challenges of the National Training Hall were not too strict. Every country was told to decide on the format themselves. The Halls could also suggest how the challenges would take place, as long as both sides reached an agreement.

“Fine, I hope you will keep your word,” Sayed grinned. His smile was rather charming, but none of the girls thought the man was handsome, since he was too full of himself!

Dongfang Lie’s primary Element was Fire. He was easily ranked in the top five in the Pearl Institute.

During the preliminaries, Dongfang Lie had lost to Li Kaifeng. Li Kaifeng managed to overcome all the challenges and defeated every student at Pearl Institute. He was representing Pearl Institute on the national team.

Mo Fan and Li Kaifeng were unaware that they were actually schoolmates!

“You can start now. I believe everyone is aware of the rules of an official duel. I’m too lazy to explain them. Just get on with the fight!” Bai Dongwei stood at the spot of a judge and wasted no time.

His only desire was to see Dongfang Lie beat the crap out of Sayed until he dropped to his knees and licked the ground of their country!

After hearing the signal, the cautious Dongfang Lie did not make his move immediately.

Normally, he would immediately cast a spell to kickstart the fight. As a purely offensive Fire Magician, securing the edge during a one-on-one duel would secure half his victory. Dongfang Lie’s casting speed was not as quick as Dongfang Ming due to Ming’s outstanding talent, but the strength of his spells was a lot higher than Dongfang Ming’s!

“Idiot, what is he thinking? Just throw a Fiery Fist at the opponent before he reacts, why didn’t he abuse his advantages during such a crucial fight instead of being so tactical. Playing a mind game? Waiting for his opponent to strike first? How stupid!” Bai Dongwei immediately murmured.

It was important for a Magician to understand their strengths and weaknesses in a duel. It was unnecessary for someone like Dongfang Lie to use his brain...

Unfortunately, he had started using his brain because of how important the duel was.

What’s the point of using his brain if he had never used it before? He would simply give his opponent an edge!

As Bai Dongwei thought, Sayed finished channeling his spell while Dongfang Lie was waiting patiently.

It was a basic Star Orbit, but it unleashed a strong presence of death and evil, as if a tomb had just been torn open. The foul odor of a tomb immediately suffused the air!

“What is that...” Dongfang Lie was startled. He had never seen anything like it in his entire life.

It felt similar to Black Magic, yet both the Shadow Element and Curse Element were nothing like what he was seeing!

“Undead Element!” Bai Dongwei recognized Sayed’s magic with a single glance. He was completely in shock.

He had to admit that the Undead Element was incredibly rare, especially in China. Searching for Undead Magicians was harder than ascending the Heavens.

Without Undead Magicians, it was difficult to produce equipment like the Stardust Magic Tools, Nebula Tools, and the Galaxy Tools. Most of the tools in their country were obtained as imports. In some ways, it greatly hindered the rate of improvement of their country’s standards.

Undead Magicians were extremely rare, but important. As for their capabilities, even Bai Dongwei had never seen one in a real fight before...

He remembered an old professor telling him that the Undead Element was similar to the Summoning Element in a fight, but it was more troublesome to deal with!

A cloud of muddy air was circling around Sayed, like countless ghosts dancing to the wind. A hole had opened up under it, like a pitch-black well with the lid removed, a tunnel leading to the filthy, dark underworld...

Eerie shrieks were coming out from the hole, bone-chilling cries of agony!𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
