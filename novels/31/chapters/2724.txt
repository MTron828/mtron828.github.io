Chapter 2725: Mighty Cliff Demon King

At the walkway next to the woods, the Thundercat statue had already been loaded on the back of the huge, golden mammoth-like beast. Boss Jin and his men were about four or five hundred meters ahead of them.

But the golden mammoth-like beast had reached its limit. After walking a distance of four or five hundred meters, it slumped down on the ground with all the force of a crashing mountain.

“Boss Jin, the Thundercat statue is too heavy. It cannot carry the statue anymore,” said one of the hunters.

“It has to! Do you even know how much the statue is worth? It has taken us so much effort and energy to find the route to this city! Many of our men have perished! We can’t give up and return empty-handed now,” Boss Jin said in anger.

Boss Jin took out a long flaming whip and lashed at the golden mammoth-like beast’s head. It screamed in pain, struggling to get up.

It managed to barely stand when it fell down on the ground again. It fell down with such a force that its kneecaps shattered and blood gushed out. It was impossible for the golden mammoth-like beast to carry the statue.

“Worthless trash! Who can summon a stronger beast?” Boss Jin shouted at his men. “I will reward him with a tenth of the honorarium.”

“Let me try.” Mo Fan smiled and walked up to them.

“Are you a Summoning Element mage?” Boss Jin raised one of his eyebrows at Mo Fan.

“Yes. I’ve achieved Super Level,” said Mo Fan.

“Great! There is no point in working for those ladies. Come and work for me! I can make sure you get your share of ladies all year round,” said Boss Jin, roaring with laughter.

“This is my first time using the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower since I advanced to the Super Level. I am not sure what kind of beast might appear,” said Mo Fan, squaring his shoulders.

The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower was one of the summoning ancient magic portals in Super Level. A Super Level Summoning Element mage could summon from a pick of the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower, Wan Dragon Valley, and Mound of the Dead Beast.

......

There were many summoning vessels sold in the market. These vessels contained magical medium power and could be used to open special summoning ancient magic portals which helped to summon any ruler-level beasts from the ancient magic portal.

Regardless of whether the creatures were from the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower, Wan Dragon Valley, or Mound of the Dead Beast, they were all ruler-level. They would be different in temperament to Old wolf who came from a humble background and experienced so many hardships.

Mo Fan focused on opening the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower. He established a spiritual connection with the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower before deciding on summoning a ruler-level beast to fight for him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Kid, stop teasing me. I’ve seen many powerful mages before. How can you open an ancient magic portal without relying on any auxiliary means?” Boss Jin’s lips twitched.

“If you never try, you will never know,” said Mo Fan.

“Fine,” said Boss Jin, not really taking him seriously. “Go to that corner and try as much as you can.” He looked at another of his hunters. “Hey, you there! You are a Chaos Elemental mage, aren’t you? Find a way to make that damned statue lighter, will you?”

Boss Jin turned to yet another man. “Hey you! You are a Plant Element mage, aren’t you? Use some vines to hang the…”

While Boss Jin instructed his men, Mo Fan went to the side and began to experiment. Super-level Summoning Element Star Palace was not complicated. The most complicated part was to use his own spiritual force to open the ancient magic portal through the summoning beast plane.

Fortunately, Mo Fan had a black dragon horn helmet which increased his dragon senses in the spiritual realm by leaps and bounds. Otherwise, it would be a fool’s errand to open the ancient magic portal through the seven realms without experience.

...

The ancient magic portal – The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower!

Mo Fan took his own sweet time with the process. Star Palace itself was an extremely complicated casting process. If it had not been for the fact that he was a Super Level mage and had mastered many Super Level profound elements, it would have been extremely difficult for him to accurately articulate two thousand four hundred one star sons through ordinary mental faculty.

The process of controlling the star son itself was like arranging dominoes which required extremely powerful mental strength and long-term experience.

The methods of articulating, tracing, framing, and constructing Star Palace were not same every time. However, once the person strengthened his mental state, he would not be so helpless when creating the Star Palace from different elements. When advancing to Super Level, the first element Star Palace was the hardest to build. Skill came with practice.

The spirit summoning beast plane soon appeared before Mo Fan. The green mountains unfolded

before him layer by layer. The mountains stood in a vast expanse of primeval ancient forest. They were not scattered, but clustered together.

The outermost layer was surrounded by green mountains. The mountains joined together to form a ring that stood in the plain of dense forest.

Within the ring of green mountain range were purple-green mountains which were taller than the mountains at the outermost layer. These mountains joined together in a ring once more.

Within the inner ring, stood another batch of green mountains higher than the layer before them. The purple mountains were tall and rose above the clouds. The purple giant mountains were a thousand meters taller compared to the outermost layer of green mountains and purple-green mountain ranges.

On top of the purple giant mountain was a black-purple godly mountain. The godly mountain

consisted of many towering peaks. The cliff ridges blocked the view of the sky. Many formidable creatures hovered at the peaks.

The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower was made up of thousands of mountain peaks that joined together and formed a breathtaking view. The majestic and magnificent view was incomparable to anything found in the human world.

When Mo Fan opened the portal to the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower, he saw a dancing small dot on the cliff of the black-purple godly mountain with the help of his dragon sense. That small dot was a ruler-level creature.

Thousands of meters tall vines drooped on the cliff. The vines swayed in the strong breeze. When the clouds drifted by, a few elves with crystal wings glowed in the holy light. They flew with incredible speed. The jumping light faded from Mo Fan’s eyes.

‘I have to look for a beast with a sturdy body to move the Thundercat statue,’ thought Mo Fan.

Suddenly, a pair of eyes opened on the cliff. It seemed to notice Mo Fan and recognized him to be from another world. It fixed its gaze on him.

Mo Fan was taken aback. He looked carefully to find a Mighty Cliff Demon King with skin the color of the cliff looking back at him. It looked like a bare-handed rock-climbing extreme sportsman climbing higher towards the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower!

‘It is the king of the cliff, the elf of the rock! Perfect!’ thought Mo Fan.

“It’s you! Go, elfball!” he said.
