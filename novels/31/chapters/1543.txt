Chapter 1545 Raising the Enemy

Translated by XephiZ

The group kept running in the same direction in the Bargo Land, leaving the army further behind.

It was difficult to pin down a Space Mage that had mastered Blink, let alone how Mo Fan and Heidi were able to join hands and cast Blink consecutively. A third-tier Blink was already enough to move a great distance away from an enemy, even if many soldiers in the troop could fly.

The greatest threat to Mo Fan and his crew was the Super Mage, Saks. They had no idea where Saks and Vani were fighting at. They only knew that Vani had been a great help by keeping Saks busy.

After half an hour, the soldiers that were chasing after them in the air had lost sight of them.

It did not necessarily mean the soldiers with Wind Wings and Wing Magical Equipment were slow, but when the soldiers split up and chased after Mo Fan and his crew, Mo Fan could easily pulverize them with a single bolt of lightning. After a few examples, the soldiers no longer dared to stay too close to them.

Both Mo Fan and Heidi were able to use Blink. If the soldiers could not constantly keep an eye on them, they would eventually lose sight of them. The Bargo Land was not just all sandy surfaces. They were rises, falls, dunes, and some plants too... it was not difficult to find a hiding spot.

After they were out of the Battlemage’s sight for an hour, Mu Bai noticed a figure approaching them rapidly from a kilometer away. The person’s speed was quite shocking.

“It’s Mentor Vani, he managed to escape too!” Mo Fan recognized the person.

Vani soon caught up to them. He had lost his handsome appearance. His clothes were ragged, and his back, chest, legs, and shoulders had all kinds of injuries that were inflicted by burns, scorching rays, and frost.

“How could you do such a thing to me!?” Vani blurted out angrily.

“We are all going to be taken out if we didn’t run in time. It wouldn’t do us any good. We only have a chance by holding this guy as a hostage,” Mo Fan replied.

“I wasn’t referring to that, you should have told me that you were retreating. I almost died to those enraged soldiers!” Vani said.

“Oh, oh, I thought you saw us leaving. Besides, you are a Super Mage. You shouldn’t have any trouble running away from them despite their numbers,” Mo Fan replied guilelessly.

Vani was infuriated, yet he knew now was not the time to argue. His students were still being held captive by the Egyptian soldiers. He was all alone and helpless in the wild. He was unsure of what to do!

“Heal up first, you might die if the injuries worsen any further,” Heidi reminded him.

Vani sat down while panting heavily. He was about to take some medicine from his backpack, but he noticed that his backpack had been destroyed during the battle.

Not only was his backpack destroyed, but all his belongings were, too! He did not even have a valid proof of identity left! Even the people at the embassy would not bother to help him...

“Here, I can see that you’ve tried your best to help, but try not to use too much of it at once. It’s very expensive!” Mo Fan gave Vani an Elemental Potion.

The Elemental Potions were products of the Parthenon Temple. They were useful for treating the long-lasting effects of Elements like Fire, Light, and Ice. The Parthenon Temple would only sell these Potions when they were running short on funds, quickly replenishing their cash reserves when they did so!

Xinxia had prepared a whole bag of Potions for Mo Fan. Vani had been a great help keeping Saks busy, or they might have struggled to capture the general. It was important for the man to recover his strength quickly!

“Thank, thank you so much.” Mentor Vani’s anger dissipated when he saw Mo Fan offering him such an expensive medicine.

“Why do I feel like you have a lot of medicines from the Parthenon Temple?” Heidi asked with a confused face.

Only people that were close to someone from the Parthenon Temple would have access to these medicines, and the person had to be from the Hall of the Goddess, too!

Heidi did not have a good impression of the Parthenon Temple. She treated the Parthenon Temple that kept picking on the Alps Institute as an enemy just like every other Mage from the Alps Institute!

“His child bride is...” Mu Bai was just about to spill the beans when he saw Mo Fan glaring at him.

“Child bride? What’s a child bride?” Heidi was unfamiliar with the term.

“Let’s focus on the matters on hand first. It seems the Egyptian army is feeding the young Medusa. I wonder if some general is responsible for it, or if his superiors know about it,” Mo Fan interrupted.

He initially thought only the Black Vatican would collude with the demon creatures to persecute humans, yet people like these soldiers kept widening his view of the world!

“Aren’t they still fighting a war against the snake and scorpion demons? The outskirts of Cairo are full of them. Why would they be feeding the rulers of the demon creatures they are fighting against!? Wouldn’t they be raising the enemy instead?” Heidi was struggling to understand the reasoning behind it!

Raising the enemy? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

A young Medusa might be a Ruler-level creature in the future. A Ruler-level creature could easily bring a great disaster upon a city, not to mention the enormous horde of demon creatures that a Ruler-level creature had control over!

“Apas, what else do you know? Did they tell you the reason why they were feeding you to the young Medusa?” Mo Fan asked.

Apas shook her head. She did not know much. The soldiers around the young Medusa never said anything.

“Could it be related to some conflict between political factions?” Vani proposed.

“Colluding with demon creatures? If Cairo lost the war, I don’t think any party would benefit from it,” Mo Fan disagreed.

If they had done it for a mere political conflict, they would be no different than the Black Vatican. They were meant to serve the people, not to be detested by them!

“The young Medusa has fallen into the army’s hands, too. We won’t be able to get rid of the Curse,” Mu Bai sighed.

They had worked so hard to capture the young Medusa, but they were set up by the army instead. It turned out that demon creatures were truly not the scariest thing in the world...

“We should find a way to enter the city and contact Fenna,” Mo Fan said.

“Humph, that woman might be siding with those scum too!” Vani scoffed.

“I doubt it, I believe she had no idea about it. We need her help if we want to save Old Zhao and the others,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had fought side by side with Fenna. He trusted her; she would never collude with soldiers that were feeding little girls to the young Medusa!

“Can’t we wait for this guy to wake up and interrogate him instead?” Heidi said, pointing at Gangma that was lying still on the ground.

Mo Fan and Mu Bai were startled.

That’s right! Why would they bother guessing what the reason was? They still had an important hostage in their hands still. They found it hard to believe that the man would insist on keeping his mouth shut...
