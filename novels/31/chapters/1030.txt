Asha’ruiya had many sides to her. She was currently dressed in black and brown tight clothes that were convenient for movement, with her hair tied up.

Mo Fan remembered the last time he felt aroused by camouflage clothing and traveler clothes was at Xizhao Valley of Dongting Lake. It was the poisoned female general he had stumbled into. He could barely remember her name.

In her current clothes, Asha’ruiya’s temperament was completely different than the noble aura possessed by a woman from Western Europe that she had displayed in the long display corridor. Mo Fan could tell that Asha’ruiya was an experienced Hunter from her cautious, calm approach...

Mo Fan was also an experienced Hunter, and could easily tell the difference between a Hunter who spent most of their time in peaceful environments, and an experienced Hunter who was used to placing their life at risk. The details that Asha’ruiya managed to pick up along the journey obviously hinted that she was quite used to traveling in the territories of demon creatures.

-This Asha’ruiya can be a saintess, a businesswoman, a Huntress... it must be quite exciting when she cosplays a policewoman, a nurse, a teacher, a wife, etc!...-, Mo Fan exclaimed to himself.

——

There were lots of different species of demon creatures on Mount Tyrant, with relatively high density, too. As a result, the old Hunters were not particularly fond of coming here.

When the species of demon creatures varied by too much, it meant there were different kinds of danger scattered across the place. Nests, poison mists, traps, illusions, territories, extreme levels of certain Elements... It was a great challenge for a Hunter to react and respond to the different environments. It was even trickier when the dangerous conditions stacked on top of one another as they ventured deeper into the place.

At such a perilous place, it was extremely difficult to stay out of danger, let alone search for a Soul-grade Seed!

Mo Fan followed behind Asha’ruiya. In the rapid-changing environment of Mount Tyrant, the only drive that kept Mo Fan motivated was Asha’ruiya’s alluring body, her slender legs, her bouncy bottom, and her slim waist that he could easily wrap around with a single hand. It was quite an enjoyable view for him.

“We’ll soon reach the main section of Mount Tyrant, where the big guys live,” Asha’ruiya turned around and said to Mo Fan.

“Mmm, I’ve been keeping an eye around. There was one footprint that grabbed my attention,” Mo Fan quickly moved his gaze away from Asha’ruiya’s waist and looked around him.

Saying this, Mo Fan could not help but feel how useless he was. He could not even fully focus on peeking at a woman, as he still noticed some strange footsteps on the ground!

Taking a closer look, Mo Fan immediately realized that it was not like he was lacking focus, but the footstep was simply too huge. Asha’ruiya initially thought it was a small pool, thus she directly jumped to the other side. Mo Fan was slightly behind her, thus he was able to take a clearer look...

Asha’ruiya finally had the chance to turn around, and realized that the little pool was actually a footprint. She curled her index finger and placed it below her lips as if she was in deep thought. A few seconds later, she mumbled to herself, “Does that mean the blast from before wasn’t a thunderclap?”

BANG!

As soon as Asha’ruiya finished her sentence, a giant steel foot came down from the sky and landed right on her.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened. He saw the giant foot land on the ground, leaving a deep footprint. Asha’ruiya had been stomped flat beneath it!

“F**k me!” Mo Fan cursed and immediately went forward.

The owner of the footprint was above the canopy. Mo Fan’s vision was completely blocked off by the trees, and he couldn’t see the creature’s appearance. The huge creature seemed to be unaware that it had just stepped on a woman. It continued moving forward, heading for Mount Tyrant’s peak.

The creature had moved a few hundred meters away with a single stride. Mo Fan went to the hole and felt oddly infuriated. Such a perfect, sexy woman had just turned into a pile of minced meat, and he happened to witness it all!

“Asha’ruiya!” Mo Fan looked into the hole.

“I’m here,” Asha’ruiya’s voice came from beside him.

Mo Fan quickly turned around and saw Asha’ruiya moving out from behind a tree.

“I thought you were dead!” Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh.

The terrifying giant had appeared too suddenly. If the foot had landed on him, he doubted if he could actually react in time.

“Almost! The Tyrant Titan always shows up unpredictably. I’m glad that you warned me about its footprint,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan raised his head and looked further into the distance, but the giant was already long gone.

Mo Fan was even more confused. Normally, it would be extremely easy to spot such a gigantic creature, but it had simply vanished into the mountain in the blink of an eye.

“It’s pretty dangerous here,” Mo Fan said.

“Which is why you shouldn’t keep looking at me,” Asha’ruiya said with a smile.

“Ugh... was it really that obvious?” Mo Fan blushed.

“Very.”

“Should I walk in front then?”

“Sure.”

“What was that creature?” Mo Fan had to ask.

“The Tyrant Titans, a giant-type species from ancient times. Rumors say that giants were mystical beings in Europe’s past, but when the Greek mythology slowly took over, these ancient mystical beings gradually turned into terrifying monsters and man-eating beasts. The truth is, these ancient titans actually feed on humans. They are incredibly strong, and in the past, people actually thought they were actually trying to preserve mankind by eating only a certain number of humans every now and then...” Asha’ruiya said.

“So, Tyrant actually refers to these mountain titans?” Mo Fan conjectured.

“Exactly, the Parthenon Temple has its current status only because they defeated these demigods and established their civilization and the beliefs of mankind. Their leader was a woman, referred to as the Goddess, and is usually referred to in many movies and animes as Goddess Athena,” Asha’ruiya informed him.

“Oh, I thought Athena was only a myth,” Mo Fan said.

“Myths originated from history. Humans like to turn some remarkable people into myths, to establish strong ideas which eventually turn into beliefs. The power of these beliefs is as destructive as a tsunami. Athena was only a name, anyone can call themselves Athena, but the most important thing is whether the person has contributed enough to bear the name,” Asha’ruiya said.

“I’ve heard similar sayings before. I mean, the second half of it.” Mo Fan’s gaze suddenly sharpened as he stared at Asha’ruiya.

Asha’ruiya did not understand why Mo Fan’s attitude had completely switched all of a sudden. She saw the hostility and wariness in Mo Fan’s eyes and giggled, “You must have misunderstood something.”

Mo Fan looked straight into the woman’s eyes, trying to peek into her mind.

However, Mo Fan soon shook his head. Even though Asha’ruiya was at the Ancient Capital, she was not among the group of authorities held captive that had included Salan. It was unlikely that she was Salan.

However, what Asha’ruiya said perfectly fit how Salan had described her name. It was unlikely that an ordinary person would share the same thought.

“I must have misunderstood,” Mo Fan withdrew his hostile gaze.

“I must have stepped on a mine to set you off. What person are you so sensitive and wary of?” Asha’ruiya asked with a calmer voice.

“It’s better if you don’t know,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m quite informed about what happened at the Ancient Capital, since I was trapped there too,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan hesitated, but decided to spill the beans. “The leader of the Black Vatican said the same thing to me.”

“Are you referring to Salan? I understand now; Salan’s name is actually similar to Athena’s name, but one represents evil, and the other represents justice. Currently, the name of the Goddess has not found its successor, but the name Salan has brought fear to the world,” Asha’ruiya said.

“You really know a lot,” Mo Fan murmured.

“Have you forgotten? It’s a part of my business.” Asha’ruiya had a playful grin, as if she was trying to liven up the mood.

“Luckily you have a perfect alibi; otherwise, I would have made my move,” Mo Fan shook his head with a wry smile when he saw the grin on Asha’ruiya’s face.

“Salan is an old woman, I’m sure of that.”

“How do you know it’s a she?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened.

“I already said it, I know more than you can ever imagine. If you are willing to pay the money, I can dig up more information about her, including who she was before she became Salan,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan opened his mouth wide. He was lost for words for a moment.

-How capable is this Asha’ruiya? Is she really able to dig up information about Salan?-

“I don’t think I can afford it, but you can try discussing it with China’s Enforcement Union,” Mo Fan said.

The Enforcement Union was pretty loaded. They were willing to pay hundreds of millions for Salan’s bounty.

“I rarely work with officials. Besides, my sources of information aren’t perfectly legal, either,” Asha’ruiya said blatantly. “Oh, if you still don’t trust me, in order to ensure that we can work together better, I can make it an exemption and tell you the reason why I was at the Ancient Capital.”

“I’m not suspicious of you,” Mo Fan said.

“Just in case you are. One of the reasons I was at the Ancient Capital was because someone was buying Salan’s information from me. The person was wrapped in gray-white cloth, I don’t know who he was, but I bet he’s a spy that the Chinese Enforcement Union placed in the dark for a long time,” Asha’ruiya told him.

“Gray-white cloth?” Mo Fan was startled. He immediately recalled the mysterious person who stuck closely to President Han Ji. He remembered that the person was the one that suggested they keep the ten authorities in custody!

“What I gave him was something that existed a long time ago, it’s some kind of proof. I believe the Enforcement Union had quite an accurate speculation, but they needed ironclad proof before they were willing to take the risk, and I brought that proof from other countries to yours,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Ironclad proof... what is it?” Mo Fan asked.

“I can’t tell you.”
