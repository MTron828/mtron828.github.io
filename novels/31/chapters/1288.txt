A desert was scary because it was hard to tell if anything was hiding in the sand, resulting in people entering the territories of demon creatures unknowingly and being wiped out. It also meant there was no place in a desert that was perfectly safe.

Likewise, the valley of tall grass was incredibly dangerous, too. The grass grew taller than their heads. The sky that a person standing in the grass could see was only the size of a palm. They had to spread the dense grass to move forward too, and since they were surrounded by grass, they were unlikely to notice if something was approaching them...

“Let’s hope none of the other groups are here.” Chen Yi felt uneasier the more she thought about Lingling’s analysis.

“Considering how cunning the Hillmen are, I believe they will try their very best to lure the Hunters here. It’s the perfect slaughtering ground,” Zhao Manyan said.

“If I was a Hillman...” Mo Fan murmured. However, he immediately had an uneasy feeling as soon as he said it. He turned to Lingling.

Lingling was initially confused, but she soon realized what Mo Fan was worried about seeing the look in his eyes.

“Lingling, why were you so sure that there’s a Giant Purple Linden here?” Mo Fan asked.

“First, the Yu Grass. There’s no other plant that can grow near a Giant Purple Linden, apart from this kind of grass. This grassland mainly consists of the Yu Grass, the same kind that we saw growing around the Giant Purple Lindens that we’ve discovered so far!”

“But why is this Yu Grass so tall?” Zhao Manyan had to ask.

“I’m not sure, perhaps some kind of mutation?” Lingling answered.

“Is that so?” Mo Fan wondered.

The Yu Grass was everywhere. Mo Fan was worried if it would attract the other Hunters here.

“There’s another important reason too; didn’t I already explain before?” Lingling said.

Mo Fan was struggling to recall it. He was about to ask when he noticed something white floating past in the blue sky.

The cobs of the grass had blocked off their vision. Even when they lifted their heads, their vision was still limited. Mo Fan initially thought it was just a white cloud, but when he looked up, he immediately realized he had seen it before!

The white flossy things were like little fairies flying under the blue sky. Mo Fan stared at the endless white dandelions drifting past in the air...

“The Dandelion Grass, I mentioned it before. Their seedheads are attracted to the Giant Purple Linden. I noticed quite a few of them heading toward this place before we even entered the valley,” Lingling stated, looking up into the sky.

Mo Fan frowned and said to Zhao Manyan, “Something doesn’t feel right. Old Zhao, lift me up into the sky!”

Zhao Manyan was overjoyed. He finally had a reasonable excuse to show off his flashy wings.

He summoned his golden wings. The spectacular Wing Magical Equipment stunned Guan Xixi and Lan Luo immediately. They had rarely met any Mage that could afford Wing Magical Equipment!

“Stop being a show-off. Hurry and lift me up. Something bad is going to happen!” Mo Fan said.

Zhao Manyan soared into the sky bringing Mo Fan with him. The grassland gradually became smaller below them. To Zhao Manyan’s astonishment, the valley was even more spacious than he had imagined. He still could not see its end even after reaching a height of five hundred meters!

“This place is so huge!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Zhao Manyan noticed something floating in the sky. They were white like clouds, but not as huge. They were a lot thinner, and were only visible with the blue sky as the background...

“Go higher,” Mo Fan said.

They continued to rise, reaching a height of a thousand meters, but they still could not see the end of the valley. However, they were incredibly shocked when they saw countless white seedheads drifting in the wind...their numbers kept increasing!

The white seedheads were coming from all directions. They could even see them being lifted up into the sky before heading toward the valley!

“What’s going on here? Why are there so many Dandelion Grass puffs...” Zhao Manyan was confused.

“Can’t you see they are all heading in the same direction?” Mo Fan said.

“I think so; it’s the same direction we’re heading into, somewhere deep in the valley!” Zhao Manyan said.

“Do you think the Hunters on the outside of Mount Kunyu can see what we are seeing?” Mo Fan said.

“Of course they can, there are so many of them. They are definitely going to see it unless they are blind,” Zhao Manyan replied. He realized something after finishing the sentence. He looked at Mo Fan with wide eyes...

Mo Fan could not find any words. It seemed like nature had really placed them at the bottom of the food chain this time!

—

The white Dandelion Grass floated in the sky above Mount Kunyu despite the absence of wind. They were like a pack of white birds migrating slowly...

The sky above Mount Kunyu was clear and blue. As more and more white seedheads rose into the sky and headed in the same direction, as if something was summoning them, they made a stunning magical scene, a view that was only possible in a place brimming with a primordial aura like the outer slopes of Mount Kunyu!

However, the danger concealed by the spectacular view was sending a great chill down Mo Fan’s spine!

Many Hunters were not experienced enough to identify the Dandelion Grass, but even the most inexperienced Hunters on Mount Kunyu knew they should follow any white seedheads they saw drifting in the air. These white puffballs were like adorable little fairies guiding them to the treasure they were searching for. They could not afford to miss out on the opportunity!

Lots of Dandelion Grass kept flying into the Valley of Yu Grass. It was quite obvious that every Hunter in the outer Mount Kunyu would immediately make their way to the valley following the Dandelion Grass...

Mo Fan had followed the Seal of Darkness he had tagged the Bronze-Fang Hillman with here. The Commander-level creature was most likely making its way back to the Hillmen’s den.

Zhao Manyan was ambushed by a Hillman not long ago. Even though there was only one of them, who could possibly tell how many Hillmen there were in this spacious valley, which was as complicated as a maze?

The stunning view was not a blessing from Heavens to the Hunters, it was the white flowers displayed at a giant cemetery!
