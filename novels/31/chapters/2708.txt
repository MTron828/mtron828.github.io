Chapter 2709: Young Gullible Women

Mo Fan fell into the category of those despicable men. He was deceitful and he needed to get to the Mingwu Ancient City. He pondered for a while and returned to the office to post another message.

Within half an hour, the two girls, who had previously chatted beside him, walked in his direction. Mo fan crossed his arms and pretended to look cool and unaffected in every way.

“Why is the person a man?” Big Sister Ying immediately expressed her dissatisfaction when she saw Mo Fan. She turned around, ready to walk away.

But the active young girl looked happy. “Are you really the Seven-star Hunter Master? I heard from my Big Sister that the Seven-star Hunter Master is very powerful. He can slaughter Commander-level Ocean Demons by himself.”

“Perhaps there’s some error in the message. But trust me, I’m the Seven-star Hunter Master. Look at my badge.” Mo Fan showed a seemingly genuine badge.

The young girl must have never seen a Seven-star Hunter Master badge before. She took it from Mo Fan excitedly and flipped it over to study it. She even took her phone out and snapped a photo of it.

“Shu Xiaohua, what are you doing? Why aren’t you following the things that our mentor had warned us about?” Big Sister Ying pulled the young girl away.

“Big Sister Ying, he’s a genuine Seven-star Hunter Master. He’s been verified. If we continue to drag this out, I don’t know how much longer we will have to wait,” Shu Xiaohua said.

“We need a female hunter,” Big Sister Ying replied.

“He’s a Seven-star Hunter Master. How can he possibly harm us? His badge is worth a trunk of ladies like us,” Shu Xiaohua insisted.

“Shu Xiaohua, what are you talking about?! Why are you comparing us to the commercial items that can be traded off?!” Big Sister Ying was so angry that her entire body trembled in rage.

“Are you going to Mingwu Ancient City, too? I’m heading there to look for some clues about an ancient living creature. But I’m not familiar with that place, so I’m hoping I can join a team which can guide me. It’s best if the team has a good understanding about that place. As a reward, I can ensure your safety throughout the journey.” Mo Fan gave them a gentle smile. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“So, that’s how it is! Big Sister Ying, we’ve found a winner!” Shu Xiaohua said in excitement.

“Don’t trust a stranger so readily!” Big Sister Ying rebuked her.

“The World’s Hunter Association has verified my message. If you think I’m an imposter, you may seek verification from Hunter Hall. But if you insist on a female hunter, I regret to say that I have to search for another team soon,” Mo Fan said.

“Big Sister Ying, it’s him! Time waits for no man. If we miss the lightning storm once again, we don’t know how much longer we have to wait for the next trip. I heard that a large group of Ocean Demons are already in the sea. We don’t know how much longer the fortress can hold them back, and who knows how soon Mingwu Ancient City will become the Ocean Demons’ habitat. By that time, we will never find it…” Shu Xiaohua rambled. She trailed off as Big Sister Ying glared at her.

Big Sister Ying hesitated. They had stayed in the fortress for many days now. There were not many independent female hunters present. Besides, even if there were, the female hunters rarely accepted the job to be someone else’s guardian, unless the pay was high.

Big Sister Ying looked up at the humid and foggy sky. “I will have to discuss it with others.”

“I’m sorry. I received invitations from other teams as well. After all, with my strength and cultivation, it’s fairly simple for me to follow a team to Mingwu Ancient City. If not for the fact that the person at office registered my gender wrongly, we wouldn’t even be taking up each other’s time. If you’re willing, I’ll tag along with you because you seem to understand Mingwu Ancient City well. If not, I can accept another team’s invitation.” Mo Fan smiled at them politely as he relayed his decision to them.

Big Sister Ying was reluctant. But Shu Xiaohua was anxious. They didn’t dare say anything more for fear of forcing the expert away.

“We have some special requests. If you’re willing to obey our team’s instructions, perhaps we can come to an agreement,” said Big Sister Ying. She was not very good at negotiation. She felt like she would give in any minute.

“Of course,” said Mo Fan. “I am a hunter, after all. Once I receive a mission, I strictly execute it. Don’t worry about it.”

“Good. We’ll see you at the fortress entrance tomorrow morning,” Big Sister Ying nodded her approval. She still felt doubtful letting this man join their team.

“Great. The Hunter Hall will take over the procedure in a while. I have other things to take care of for now. See you tomorrow.” Mo Fan bid them farewell.

As he turned around, his smile turned into a smirk. He thought that these young women were truly gullible. If not for him, some other cunning hunter would have taken advantage of them…

...

Mo Fan had nothing to take care of. He was idle. He had said that to appear profound and busy. Since he was going to depart tomorrow, he settled in a decent hunter’s inn and stayed there for the night.

After Mo Fan cultivated through the night, he felt his Summoning Element was about to break through the barrier of cultivation. He concentrated Little Loach’s special pushing force on his Summoning Element.

“Eh, it’s a breakthrough! I’m not used to being so relaxed.” Mo Fan opened his eyes in the middle of the night, delighted, as if he had bumped into a fair aristocratic lady in the middle of the wilderness.

“Why is my head filled with these weird thoughts whenever I am alone?” Mo Fan reflected on his thoughts and actions and recalled the vision he had seen in the Divine Wood Well last time.

Mo Fan’s Summoning Element had achieved a breakthrough. His Galaxia had transformed into Star Sea. He wondered how much his magical energy had increased.

Mo Fan remembered breaking through Advanced Level and Super Level for the first time with the help of a rare totem power. As his overall realm was advanced, his Summoning Element became unequal to the rest of the elements, hence a strong urge to break through without expending much energy.

Of course, Mo Fan was aware that most of the credit went to Little Loach.

Little Loach’s standard continued to improve and cast a significant warming effect on his Star Sea and of course, Galaxia, too. It felt like the flow of a mountain stream that continued to converge and expand. Even if it met the dam, it could still rush through it and continue to run wild…
