“Growth of All Things!” Mu Nujiao flung her sleeves, scattering countless green seeds across the broken ground that Zhao Manyan had produced.

Demon trees with sharp blades emerged rapidly from the ground. It only took them a few seconds to grow from a sprout to a six-meter-tall tree!

“Dancing Leaves!” The trees swayed under Mu Nujiao’s control. The blade-like leaves immediately danced wildly in the fierce wind that she had summoned.

The leaves were incredibly sharp, shredding the cloth wrapping the Dark Red Mummies with ease and further penetrating their sturdy skin. The Dark Red Mummies leading the charge were shredded in an instant...

The leaves were dyed red after killing a score of the Dark Red Mummies leading the charge.

“I’ll trap them all, Mo Fan, just take them all out!” Zhao Manyan said.

“Got it!” Zhao Manyan squinted. He slammed his hands on the ground had when he saw the rest of the Dark Red Mummies were still trying to get over the hills.

A powerful Earth Wave surged toward the hills. Four huge walls rose into the sky and rose around the Dark Red Mummies like a sturdy cage!

The Dark Red Mummies reached out with their claws, trying to climb up the walls. However, they had only climbed a few meters up when a Meteorite Fist came down from above and smashed several Dark Red Mummies into pieces...

More burning fists were thrown into the cage, cleaning up the undead trapped inside Zhao Manyan’s cage. The Dark Red Mummies were soon crushed and burned to pieces...

The undead were still able to move when their bones were broken, but their heads, arms, lower limbs, and bodies were being burned by the strong flames. The impact of the raining fists was deadly enough, but they still had to endure the flames. Not a single Dark Red Mummy managed to survive, the squad was completely wiped out!

“I should be the one counting on you instead!” Mu Nujiao smiled.

Mo Fan’s destructive Spells were absolutely insane. She had eliminated around twenty undead when she had using both her Wind Element and Plant Element, and yet a single Rain of Burning Fists from Mo Fan had wiped out the whole army of Dark Red Mummies!

The dust slowly cleared up. The team was relieved, as the Dark Red Mummies were not as tricky to deal with as they initially thought. It did not take them much effort to kill them.

However, green eyes like glowing stars vaguely appeared amid the flying dust, as rows of the same mummies showed up once again. The smiles on the Chinese team’s faces soon disappeared.

“No f**king way!” Zhao Manyan started cursing.

When the team was busy eliminating the first batch of Dark Red Mummies, the five members of the Egyptian team had Summoned an even bigger army of undead. There were a lot more of them this time, around two hundred!

A giant mummy as tall as a three-story building stood out among the bobbing heads of the Dark Red Mummies. It was also wrapped in dark red shrouds, but its arms were replaced with two huge axes. Its deathly aura reached a height of a hundred meters in the air!

“Death Axes Mummy, that guy is going to be a pain!” Mo Fan said.

“Take care of the little shrimps, I’ll deal with the big one!” Guan Yu said.

—

More than two hundred Dark Red Mummies were charging at the Chinese team. They were starving and ferocious, just like demon creatures in the wilderness. What if the students were overwhelmed by the undead, and the assistant judges were unable to lend a hand in time? Would the students be eaten alive by the undead then?

“Rock Golem General, crush them!” Jiang Yu summoned his Summoned Beast.

The Rock Golem General was incredibly huge. It stomped its foot and killed a few clueless Dark Red Mummies.

The Dark Red Mummies were not slow. They immediately pounced on the Rock Golem General after realizing that it was stopping them from pushing ahead.

Many of the Dark Red Mummies were hanging onto the Rock Golem General. Their claws and teeth were extraordinarily sharp, enough to tear the Rock Golem General’s rock-solid armor apart!

“Rock Impale!” Jiang Yu ordered.

The Rock Golem General let out a roar. Long rock spikes suddenly burst out from its body and impaled the Dark Red Mummies that were hanging on it, blood splattered through the air...

The impaled mummies were still able to move. They could not feel pain at all. They continued to tear and scratch at the Rock Golem General. Realizing the danger it was in, the Rock Golem General tried to shake the Dark Red Mummies off it.

“Set up the area with your Ice and Plant,” Mo Fan told Mu Nujiao.

“Sure!” Mu Nujiao knew how important it was to secure the area. They had to hold their ground when the tide of undead came. It would be troublesome if the members of the team were split up.

“Damn it, the World College Tournament has suddenly turned into a tower defense game; we’re forced to defend ourselves passively, just like the English team and the Greek team!” Zhao Manyan cursed in displeasure.

The undead just kept coming. The Chinese team had no choice but to defend themselves in order to stay in formation. However, the undead would just keep coming if they stayed in one spot, and they would eventually be overwhelmed. Mo Fan had to admit that the Egyptian team’s strategy was pretty shameless. It was supposed to be a showdown between the students representing their countries!

“I’ll find a way to take them out,” Mo Fan said.

“Mo Fan, they are summoning more undead... holy crap, can such a small place really fit so many undead!?” Jiang Yu screamed.

It went without saying that the undead were not underground to begin with. It was similar to Summoning Magic, as the undead were Summoned to the battle from the Land of the Undead.

The Egyptian team continued to cast spells, Summoning endless undead from the ground. The numbers were shocking. They had yet to eliminate the Dark Red Mummies surrounding them when they saw a new tide of Dark Red Mummies charging at them. It was simply disgusting!

“Jiang Yu, Summon your beasts, we have to take this batch out first,” Mo Fan said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Sure!” Jiang Yu started drawing the Star Constellation of the Summoning Element. He opened a gap to the Summoned Beast Plane, and summoned a herd of Iron Hoof Beasts. The Iron Hoof Beasts were a lot stronger than the Dark Red Mummies. They trampled the Dark Red Mummies into minced meat!

Unfortunately, the Advanced Spell of the Summoning Element did not last very long. The Iron Hoof Beasts soon disappeared back through the gap and returned to the Summoned Beast Plane. Jiang Yu would have to cast another Advanced Spell to Summon them again.

Jiang Yu did not have an endless supply of energy, but the undead of the Egyptian team were actually endless. The old batch of undead had just died when a new tide of undead showed up. It even had two Death Axes Mummies, along with the Dark Red Mummies!

“What the f**k, two of them?” Guan Yu had just taken out the one before when he saw two of the same giant mummies approaching the team. Even he could not help but curse.

“Cover me, I’ll see if I can clear a path!” Mo Fan said to the others.

“Allow me to blind them first!” Zhao Manyan said.

Zhao Manyan suddenly saw Mo Fan looking back at him as if he was a retard. The man initially had no idea what he said wrong. It only took him a while to realize it, as he said with an awkward face “Hehe, I forgot that my light would expose you when you’re using the Shadow Element.”

“I’m off!” Mo Fan put on the Dark Noble Mantle and vanished into thin air. One had to look closely to barely see a faint shadow weaving through the undead like the shadow of a sparrow. It was silent and untraceable.

A new batch of the Dark Red Mummies was already within a hundred meters of the Chinese team. Jiang Yu’s Rock Golem General was no longer able to hold the mummies off. The Dark Red Mummies moved past it like two strong currents. Mu Nujiao had no choice but to activate her Plant Spell to trap the Dark Red Mummies...

Mo Fan wove through the chaotic battlefield and slowly approached the five members of the Egyptian team standing close together.

If the Egyptian team was careless, Mo Fan could easily get himself an ace with a single Sky Lightning Claw, but Mo Fan did not believe it would be that easy. {TL Note: ‘Ace’ = a League of Legends reference; the announcer will say ‘ace!’ when an entire team is wiped out.}

Mo Fan did not dare move any closer. He observed the magic that his opponents were using, and realized that they were indeed casting Undead Spells. They did not break any rule, and were not using any forbidden magic, either. The only strange thing was they kept dripping their blood to conduct some kind of ritual...

“How do they Summon the undead so endlessly?” Mo Fan was curious.

If they could promote the ability to Summon endless undead to the world, wouldn’t the Undead Element be unbeatable? They no longer had to worry about the overwhelming numbers of the demon creatures in the wilderness, as they could simply Summon hundreds of thousands of undead to raze the kingdom of demon creatures to the ground. If they were Summoning the undead at the cost of their blood, they just needed to recruit more people. Besides, didn’t the experts say donating blood was actually good for people?

“What is that magic Curse?” Mo Fan took a closer look and realized that a magic Curse would appear whenever the members of the Egyptian team were offering their blood, but it also disappeared very quickly.

If Mo Fan could learn more about the magic Curse, perhaps he could find a way to overcome the situation!

Mo Fan was busy observing the ritual when he felt a great chill ran down his spine. A sinister-white claw was reaching for the back of his neck, as if it was aiming to take his life!

Mo Fan broke out in cold sweat. He immediately ran for his life.

He turned around and saw a long robe floating within inches of him. There were no legs under the cloth, but he could see a ghastly pair of long, rotten claws half a meter long!

“Mo Fan, I knew you are going to show up eventually, so I specifically brought the Specter Priest to play with you. Aren’t your destructive Spells impressive? Go ahead and see if you can kill the Specter Priest!” Meos called out in a mocking tone.

“Specter?” Even with Mo Fan’s outstanding mental strength, he did not sense the danger coming from behind him. On top of it, the creature did not seem to have a body. Only an empty, long robe was hovering in front of him. It was quite obvious that it was the specter Meos was referring to!

They were different kinds of undead. Mummies and zombies were the most common ones, followed by skeletons, and then the phantoms. Specters were the least common.

The phantoms were placed between the mummies and the specters. They had flesh, but it was disposable. Their spirits were their true form.

Meanwhile, specters did not have bodies. They were the trickiest creature to deal with in the world, as they were immune to every Element apart from the Light Element!

Since the creature did not have a body, none of his destructive spells were going to work against it. It was obvious that Meos had specifically summoned the specter to deal with him!

“Everyone seems to enjoy picking on me,” Mo Fan put on an indifferent grin.

“Your magic is so powerful. If we don’t pick on you, how are we supposed to win the match?” Meos replied.
