Mo Fan knew the risk of getting his shoes wet if he kept walking close to the river. As such, he had been splitting the loot evenly between the three members. It was the same reason why it was better not to put all eggs in the same basket, to prevent something like this.

If he was caught, the people would mostly beat him up. They would not dare to kill him, since the treasure hunt was under the surveillance of the Observer Eagles. However, he would surely have to surrender his possessions, but he only had a third of the loot. In the end, they still made a profit!

Mo Fan was not naive to think that the group that had set up the barrier just to apprehend him only consisted of a few people. As he thought, around eight people were approaching from the distance, too.

The water cage was not sturdy. Mo Fan only needed some time to break it down, but the enemy had already surrounded him at the spacious ground.

Mo Fan finally realized why they had set up the tents at such a spacious spot. It was to ensure that he had nowhere to run to!

“I’m going to kill this bastard!” Meos was lunging at Mo Fan like a lioness.

The Water Mage, Pinole stopped her. He said with a calm smile, “Mo Fan, I bet you didn’t expect this to happen. We actually used a real Soul-grade Seed in order to lure you out... give us the Soul-grade Seed, and the loot you’ve been plundering so far, and we might consider going easy on you.”

Pinole seemed to have a gentle demeanor as a member of Spain’s royal family, but the look in his narrow eyes clearly implied that he was a vengeful person. Mo Fan had almost disqualified their team during the knockout round, and Pinole, whom the Spanish team had purposely arranged as their trump card, ended up taking the supporting role in the match against the Chinese team.

As for the Egyptian team, Meos, Shreev, and Sayed were old enemies of Mo Fan. Their eyes were burning with rage!

“So you are the one that prepared the barrier for me. I bet it cost you quite a number of magic ores? Sorry for wasting your money!” Mo Fan glanced at the barrier. He did not seem very afraid.

Pinole smiled when he saw that Mo Fan was not planning to hand his loot over, “Aren’t you going to take a look around? You might find more of your old acquaintances, too.”

“HAHAHA, we finally got you this time, you cunning, slippery mudfish, don’t tell me you’re so naive to think that we had no idea that you and the Ice Maga were robbing us. We’ve all come together to set up a trap for you, yet you were really bold enough to come rob us when we have such a huge group!” Jack walked closer while laughing out loud.

“Humph, my teammates have left me behind after I lost the Heart of Stone. You have no idea how miserable I felt! I even took an oath that I would hunt you down, even if I won’t have time to look for other treasure during the treasure hunt!” Angelo of the Italian team snapped.

Among the people that came with Jack and Angelo were Hannah with the Lightning Element, and five other students from Canada, England, and France. Mo Fan noted that he had robbed two of them!

The group of people from different countries had quite a shocking strength. Jack, Hannah, Angelo, and the others did not really have a common language with the Spanish and Egyptian teams, but they had a common enemy: Mo Fan, the robber, the shameless, detestable jerk from China!

Speaking of which, only a mad man like Mo Fan who dared to rob any team he stumbled into could inspire such an alliance to hunt him down!

In the stadium where the teleportation portal was, the authorities of each country were seated in their respective areas, their eyes fixed on the screen.

The incident taking place at the lower reaches of the river was soon displayed on the main screen. It was showing how Mo Fan had been intercepted to hundreds of millions of people across the world.

They were many Observer Eagles circling in the sky, so the spectators already knew about the Fan Xue Bandit Group. The truth was, the Chinese team had suddenly become every country’s enemy all of a sudden, with spectators all over the world cursing them. Meanwhile, the officials were utterly speechless. The three participants did not break any rules, so they did not really have an excuse to condemn them. As a matter of fact, the other countries were also robbing the groups that they stumbled into, but none of the groups were as blatant as that trio!

Luckily, Ayleen was part of the trio too, meaning that England had taken some of the attention away. The well-mannered British people felt rather awkward watching the treasure hunt.

As the saying went, one would take on the color of their company. How did their Princess Ayleen end up with the Chinese? Even though they were quite excited whenever they saw Princess Ayleen successfully rob some other groups, it was not really morally acceptable!

Meanwhile, the supporters of the Chinese team were cheering loudly.

Both Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue had already had an outstanding performance in the knockout round, earning them lots of fans. Their supporters were even more impressed by their achievements during the treasure hunt, as the two were able to rob several teams successfully with their outstanding skills. The name of the Fan Xue Bandit Group spread wildly across China. Go and rob those foreigners! Everyone was incredibly pleased by what the two were doing...

China had an overwhelming population, thus when it came to cheering for the teams, the Chinese team still had more votes than most of the teams on various social platforms. The votes cast by people from all of Europe were less than the votes from China!

As a matter of fact, the team that Ai Jiangtu was leading had been outstanding too, but the spectators were already feeling bored watching the teams sticking to conventions. They liked watching Mo Fan’s approach, as it was intense, exhilarating, and thrilling, like someone was having an affair behind their partner. It was quite rare for the spectators to be so excited when watching the tournament!

However, Mo Fan had been caught by the alliance. The hundreds of millions of spectators in China were extremely worried, and proceeded to curse the students of the other countries for their shamelessness!

“I’m really impressed. How detestable is Mo Fan, that the students have to team up and hunt him down like an Eight-Nation Alliance!” The Royal Guards’ chief, Pang Lai let out a sigh as he watched the screen.

Feng Li, Song He, and Han Ji were seated with some great authorities of their country as they watched the tournament. The truth was, they were feeling extremely nervous, too.

The Chinese national team had always been well-behaved; where did they even find someone like Mo Fan, who simply focused on robbing the other countries. Was that really something a normal person would think of!?

“(Cough cough), this Mo Fan is a self-made genius, so he might come up with some mischievous ideas at times, please don’t...” Feng Li had always been confident in front of the authorities, but he had lost half his confidence because of Mo Fan. He tried to explain the situation in a soft voice.

To his surprise, before he could finish his sentence, Chairman Shao Zheng frowned and uttered something surprising.

“How is Mo Fan going to escape now that he’s trapped?!”

“Yeah, this is bad, he should have stayed low after their last attempt. As I thought, they have fallen into a trap!” sighed another.

Han Ji, Pang Lai, Song He, Feng Li, and the others were left speechless. They did not expect that the authorities, including Chairman Shao Zheng, were extremely concerned for Mo Fan’s wellbeing, and that even they were very nervous...

“I hope the two girls are fine,” another woman said.

“It’s likely that Mo Fan has already warned them... huh, look, is that the smart girl? Why have they shown themselves?” Shao Zheng poked his head forward and asked, pointing at the screen.

The main screen still showed Mo Fan being surrounded by more than ten people, but another Observer Eagle had found Mu Ningxue and Ayleen, too.

The two of them had come out of their hiding spot, and were heading in Mo Fan’s direction.

“Impressive, they aren’t willing to abandon their teammate.”

“But that also means the group is going to be wiped out, and they are going to lose all their loot. Those people really hate Mo Fan, they are surely going to teach him a lesson!”

Back at the lower reaches of the river, Mo Fan saw Mu Ningxue and Ayleen running at him. He was touched, but felt speechless at the same time too.

All their efforts were in vain. If they had come out, the enemy was going to take all their loot!

The loot was merely some worldly possessions, so he did not really care much about it. However, it was obvious that the enemy would not just let them go after getting their hands on the loot. They were surely going to vent their anger on them. Besides, it was unlikely that they would go easy on the girls, especially Hannah and Meos. They were more than willing to make a name for themselves by using Mu Ningxue and Ayleen as their stepping stones!

Jack, Angelo, and the others were extremely pleased that the two women had decided to walk right into their trap. They did not stop the two women from regrouping with Mo Fan. They simply looked at the trio that had been met with misfortune with strange smirks on their face!

“How touching, I didn’t know bandits could be this touching too,” Hannah mocked.

“Ayleen, why are you with them?” Herbert of the English team looked at Ayleen in astonishment.

“Herbert, we’ll give you back what you lost. Can you not meddle in the matter?” Ayleen said.

Herbert had fought against Mo Fan at the Training Hall. Herbert was extremely dissatisfied with the outcome, as they had lost to China at the Training Hall. In addition to that, his team had also fallen victim to Mo Fan’s bandit group. Herbert was looking forward to getting his revenge.

“Ayleen, I can’t do that, this man is too detestable! We have to teach him a lesson. Otherwise, we’re going to be a disgrace to Great Britain!” Herbert replied furiously.

Herbert turned to the others and said, “Ayleen is our duchess, I believe she was forced to collude with the shameless bandits. Please don’t pick on her!”

“I find it hard to believe that she didn’t take part in the robberies,” a female Canadian student, Belle immediately countered.

Belle was not really known by the others, and she was one of the weakest members of the Canadian team. Meanwhile, Ayleen was strong, elegant, and gentle, with a formidable background. She was the perfect woman to most people. If Belle could defeat Ayleen here, she would surely enter the limelight. Even though she would be cursed by Ayleen’s supporters, it was better than being a nobody. She was tired of not being treated seriously by everyone!
