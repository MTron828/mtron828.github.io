The group continued to ascend the stairs. To their surprise, they managed to reach the entrance before the stone figures came alive.

The unexpected outcome simply gave Mo Fan a loud slap to the face. The man could not help but explain himself, “It’s most likely that the bloodline of the villages has stopped them from coming alive...I’m guessing that some monster is going to jump out from the mirror,” said Mo Fan.

The mirror that Mo Fan was referring to was hanging right on the entrance of the palace tomb. The doors were tightly shut. The architecture consisted of perfect squares and rectangles, with some white cauldrons on the sides.

“I was given a fright as soon as I reached the top of the stairs. I thought the mirror was watching us, as if it were the palace’s eye,” Su Xiaoluo blurted out.

Mo Fan took a closer look and immediately sensed the feeling of being watched as Su Xiaoluo had mentioned, goosebumps rising all over him.

“It does feel like an eye...by the way, Su Xiaoluo, do you think the stairs look familiar to the drawings in the well when we are looking down from here?” Fang Gu asked Su Xiaoluo grimly as a thought crossed his mind.

“The drawing in the well?” Su Xiaoluo was stunned. She immediately turned around and glanced down at the long stairs. Her confused look was gradually replaced with astonishment, “You’re right, it’s the drawing in the well. No wonder I was feeling the stairs were familiar!”

Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, and Liu Ru had no clue what the drawing in the well that Fang Gu and Su Xiaoluo were discussing meant. Did that mean the villages were already in possession of the drawings of the imperial tomb?

“The Kun Well in our village is rather special. During a specific time every night, if you look into the well, you’ll see a life-like drawing at its bottom. No, it feels more like the bottom is connected to somewhere else. It’s like seeing a different world through the well. I can only remember seeing white jade stones in the shape of stairs. Aren’t they the stairs we just climbed?” said Su Xiaoluo.

Mo Fan fell speechless for a while. Didn’t that mean the Kun Wells that the villages had protected for generations were the white palace tomb entrances?

The strange drawing they saw at the bottom of the well was the imperial tomb!

“It’s that Wicked Eye Copper Mirror. I believe the image it’s reflecting is actually what we saw at the bottom of the well. You mentioned that it felt like an eye; it is an eye!” Fang Gu pointing at the mirror.

Su Xiaoluo came to a realization too, and her eyes glittered. “That means the drawing we saw at the bottom of the well is real. It’s the scene of our old ancestor’s tomb!”

Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou exchanged glances with one another as the other two in their group learned the meaning behind the teachings of their ancestors. They could see the disbelief in one another’s eyes!

A long-distance surveillance camera from two thousand years ago!

The villagers were entrusted to protect the Ancient King’s tomb.

It was likely that the emperor had spent more time and effort on constructing his tomb than he had invested in conquering the six nations. Otherwise, how did he manage to construct such a remarkable kingdom of death in the old times, one that had not been disturbed for over two thousand years?

“I don’t know if this works, but let’s try,” Fang Gu murmured to himself as he took out an old copper mirror out of nowhere.

The copper mirror was only around the size of a palm. Its shape was similar to the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror hanging on the entrance. Fang Gu raised the mirror in his hand and directed it at the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror...

The Wicked Eye Copper Mirror blinked like a huge eye. Its gaze locked onto Fang Gu, Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, Liu Ru and Su Xiaolu!

The white doors started opening slowly all of a sudden, like something was pulling the heavy doors apart. The moment the entrance opened, a strong gust of wind burst out with a howl, almost sending the group flying down the stairs.

It was obvious that the entrance had never been opened since it was shut. The difference in air pressure on both sides was immense!

“Let’s go, the stone figures we saw are moving,” said Fang Gu.

After learning the truth of the drawing in the well, Fang Gu seemed to recall more information about the place.

Mo Fan reflexively turned around as he heard noises coming from the stairs. He glanced back and down, and saw the stone figures coming to life. It was hard to tell how many years they had been asleep for, as they even forgot how to walk properly, and were staggering around like infants.

However, it was not a funny scene at all. Mo Fan could sense the overwhelming auras from the stone figures that were now moving. Each was stronger than the White Sand Giants they had encountered at the Drifting Sand River!

“They are very strong. If we couldn’t open the door, it’s likely that we’d all die to them,” said Fang Gu.

Mo Fan nodded. He could at most handle two or three of the stone figures, but there was a whole bunch of them coming toward the group. They were as many as a pack of zombies!

The group of five did not dare waste any more time. They quickly entered the white palace tomb.

The group followed as Fang Gu led the way. He would come to a stop, trying to recall information about the place now and then. It was obvious that the information that their ancestors had passed down was related to the white palace tomb. With the clues, it would be easier for them to locate the Ancient King.

They found themselves in a long corridor filled with art. The carvings hanging on the walls on both sides seemed to be the Ancient King’s personal collection.

“Remember, try not to look at the art. They might be traps set up with the Psychic Element. If you somehow trigger the traps, you will fall into an illusion, a dream, and find yourself trapped within it,” Fang Gu reminded the others, as if he had been here before.

Liu Ru was from the Blood Tribe, thus she was familiar with bewitchment and illusions, yet even her soul was almost hooked away by the carvings. She broke out in cold sweat when she heard Fang Gu’s warning.

“Such a strong bewitching power, and the whole corridor is full of this art. Even a Super Magician would be lost in the art if they aren’t careful enough, trapping them forever in illusions...” said Liu Ru in lingering fear.

She clearly realized how terrifying the power was, as she was familiar with bewitchment and illusions herself. It was a trap set up by the Qin Emperor Ying Zheng to stop outsiders from disturbing his tomb.

He had fallen into a deep sleep for over two thousand years. Apart from the stone figures at the entrance that had existed until today, no other life forms were able to protect his tomb. As such, his tomb would surely be filled with all kinds of traps. The trespassers who were caught in them would lose their way and die eventually...

“By the way, why aren’t we at the end yet, we’ve been walking for quite a while now...” Zhang Xiaohou raised a question that prompted everyone to realize that something did not feel right.
