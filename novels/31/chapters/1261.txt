{TL Note:

If you’re interested in what the actual reference of the creature is, it’s the Chinese moon moth with the scientific name Actias Ningpoana.}

“Who were these people?” Mu Ningxue asked.

The moths that survived finally had a chance to catch their breath after Mu Ningxue put out the fire. Mu Ningxue observed the dried remains of the moths scattered across the mountain. She could not understand why the group of people would do such a cruel act to Yu Shishi.

“They are from the Research Union. They have been stalking Yu Shishi for some time. They want to use her for their experiments,” Mo Fan answered.

“How bad is the situation?” Mu Ningxue observed her surroundings.

“Not great. Many moths have died, but some still managed to survive. Let’s check on her,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue went up to Yu Shishi and saw her cautiously holding the youngest moths in her arms. She was comforting the little creatures in a soft voice. It seemed the little moths that had survived were greatly scared by the flames!

Yu Shishi turned around and saw Mu Ningxue and Mo Fan. She forced a pitiful smile and said, “Is it true that someone like me doesn’t deserve to live peacefully in this world?”

“Don’t you say that. You’re welcome to stay here, but I believe you haven’t told us everything about you. Are you sure they are the people of the Research Union?” Mu Ningxue asked calmly.

The Research Union was still under the Magic Association, but the behavior of Zeng Guanglie and Houndman clearly did not represent the Magic Association. It was likely that someone else was after Yu Shishi!

“I...” Yu Shishi looked away. She was clearly hiding something.

“We won’t force you if you don’t feel like telling us your secret, but if you are serious about staying here and want us to protect you and your moths, you should at least tell us the reason why they are so eager to get their hands on you, so we can think of a way to get rid of them,” Mu Ningxue stated firmly.

Yu Shishi remained silent for some time. She glanced around the woods, now burned beyond recognition.

She let out a heavy sigh and said, “I’m afraid they are after a Totem Beast.”

“A Totem Beast!” Mo Fan was startled.

They were after a Totem Beast?!

A Totem Beast was incredibly powerful. If they could find traces of one’s whereabouts from some ancient ruins and utilize it, they would be invincible!

The safety that the Black Totem Snake provided Hangzhou was remarkable.

It turned out that there were still people looking for Totem Beasts out there , but did they really exist?

“What Totem Beast is it?” Mo Fan asked.

“The Moon Moth Phoenix!” Yu Shishi said.

—

“I hope you’ll keep everything I’m about to tell you a secret at all costs, as it might bring danger to the Moon Moth Phoenix. The Totem Beasts are powerful, but they are extremely vulnerable in this era too. Compared to other demon creatures that continue to reproduce and evolve, the Totem Beasts are easier to kill off due to man-made disasters,” Yu Shishi began earnestly while sitting on a boulder.

“I’ve heard a thing or two about the Moon Moth Phoenix. I remember that it was the Totem Beast of the Yueli Tribe to the south of Huang He (the Yellow River). It used to rule over the south of Huang He in the past, a well-developed human tribe, but I heard they were defeated and annexed by a stronger tribe. Its Totem Beast, the Moon Moth Phoenix went missing, too. Rumors say the Moon Moth Phoenix was the descendant of the most authoritative Totem Beast in history...” Mo Fan quickly explained what he knew about the Moon Moth Phoenix.

Professor Shi had told Mo Fan a lot of information about the Totem Beasts. Among the stories was information about the Moon Moth Phoenix, so he recognized it when Yu Shishi mentioned its name.

Yu Shishi never expected Mo Fan to know about the Moon Moth Phoenix. She added, “The Moon Moth Phoenix is hibernating most of the time. As its life approaches the end, it will turn into a cocoon and be reborn after a prolonged period to refresh its lifespan.”

“So you’re implying the Moon Moth Phoenix is currently in its cocoon phase, and you know where it is?” Mo Fan said.

Yu Shishi nodded. It was the Moon Moth Phoenix that had granted her the unique scent. The people of the Research Union must have noticed traces of the Moon Moth Phoenix after observing her. They were after the Moon Moth Phoenix, not her.

“I won’t tell anyone where the Moon Moth Phoenix is,” Yu Shishi said firmly.

“How did you become a moth woman?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“I was gravely ill when I was young. My family gave up on me, and abandoned me in a forest. I knew I won’t be able to live for long, so I kept wandering aimlessly. I ended up fainting on some warm moist grass... I thought I was dead when I was wrapped up inside a white thing that I thought was a coffin, but I later realized it was actually a cocoon. I was inside it asleep for many years. When the cocoon broke apart, I was reborn like the Moon Moth Phoenix. I was no longer sick, nor was my body weak, but I suddenly had wings and fangs. My body is no longer human, apart from my appearance,” Yu Shishi explained.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue finally understood why Yu Shishi was trying so hard to protect the moths. It was the moths that had saved her when she had lost all hope. It was the moths that cured her and granted her power.

The moths had saved her, while her family had abandoned her. The great contrast further convinced her that the moths were more like family to her. She was willing to risk everything just to protect the moths!

“Is the Moon Moth Phoenix really still alive?” Mo Fan asked.

Yu Shishi nodded and said, “The Moon Moth Phoenix isn’t the only Totem Beast that’s still alive. Humans no longer need the Totem Beasts, so they have been living deep in the mountains and forests. They have turned untamed and wild. Some died and are lost to history. Some are deeply asleep and have no intention to wake up no matter what happens. The Moon Moth Phoenix belongs to the past. She only wants to live peacefully and observe the changes in the world until her death. I don’t understand why those people keep trying to hunt her down. Are they thinking of taming her so she would fight for them like their Summoned Beast? There’s no way the Moon Moth Phoenix would be enslaved by them!”

“Humans were more like slaves to the Totem Beasts in the past...” Mo Fan explained calmly.
