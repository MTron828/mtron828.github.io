As the people were lost in their thoughts, someone blurted out fiercely, “I would rather die trying than wait for my death here!”

“Yeah, it’s better to die fighting than fall into the Dark Abyss!” said Lu Xu.

Even though their efforts might be in vain, if they were given a choice, they would rather charge out of the golden barrier and fight the undead until the end!

“Count me in,” exclaimed Li Yujian.

Feeling depressed and hopeless was not something a Super Magician should do. They should be dying gloriously on the battlefield instead, dragging a few Corpse Officials and Phantom Generals with them, or even kill a Ruler Undead. It would be their glory!

“Everyone, let’s calm down first!” said the mysterious man.

“We’re not calming down! Even if we’re about to die, we are going to die a glorious death! If Salan is really among us putting up an act, we’ll drag him out there with us, and we’ll see whether the asshole or us is going to die first!” cursed the Elder of the Hunter Union.

“Let’s fight our way out of here, but we’re not simply trying to get ourselves killed. We’ve just received some information from a reliable source. The Dark Abyss might be deadly, so deadly that even Lu Huan and the Nether Bone Ruler could not escape from it, yet it doesn’t mean we can’t go into it!” the mysterious man told the people on the clock tower.

The words immediately caught everyone’s attention, and their eyes began to flicker.

-It’s possible to go into the Dark Abyss?

-There’s actually a way to enter the Dark Abyss?-

Even a strong Magician like Lu Huan was sucked into it! They could not even tell if he was still alive. No one was stronger than Lu Huan among them, they would most likely die if they were to jump into the Dark Abyss!

“We can now confirm that the Dark Abyss is the Ancient King’s imperial tomb. He created the pit of death two thousand years ago when he fell into an eternal sleep, just so no one would disturb his peace,” said the mysterious man.

The person who had sent him the letter had verified the piece of information. The fact that the Ancient King’s imperial tomb was located under the Dark Abyss was incredibly shocking. It explained why no one had managed to locate the tomb after so many years!

The ancestor of the undead, Ying Zheng, was the emperor with the greatest ambition ever in the thousands of years old Magic Civilization. His talent in the Earth Element was incredibly shocking. The perfect condition of the Great Wall of China that was still holding the demon creatures off in the north was one of his greatest achievements. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A great talent when alive, but a terrifying ghost when dead. It was the perfect description for the Emperor of the Qin Dynasty, Ying Zheng!

The ability to place his imperial tomb under the Dark Abyss was still shocking to the Magicians from the current era!

“No one, including the strongest Magician, is allowed to step into the imperial tomb, yet there is a group of people that the Dark Abyss won’t reject. They are the people of the villages!” said the mysterious man excitedly, while pointing at Fang Gu.

Everyone quickly shifted their attention to Fang Gu, who was also quite surprised himself. He glanced at the mysterious man with a confused look.

“The undead will not attack the people from the dangerous villages, as they are the descendants of the Ancient King. The Dark Abyss will destroy everything, stopping every living thing that tries to invade the imperial tomb. However, the door of the imperial tomb is always open to the people from the villages,” said the mysterious man.

If they were able to capture a glimpse of light when they completely lost hope, it felt like they suddenly had something to look forward to. It was worth the try, at least it was better than waiting for their death helplessly!

“Are you saying that the people from the villages can enter the Dark Abyss?”

“Is that true? Are you sure about that?”

“How can you be sure of that?” Zhu Meng quickly went forward with a stern look.

“The person who gave me the information is very reliable. It’s true that we can’t verify the information whether the people from the villages are safe to enter the Dark Abyss, but we have to try,” said the mysterious man grimly.

Fang Gu fell silent when he suddenly became everyone’s hope. He finally spoke with a not so confident voice, “Our villages strictly follow our ancestors’ teachings. Everyone from the villages knows about it, but the chiefs are also told to hold on to some secret information. It does mention that we are protected by the Gods, that even if we fell into the kingdom of death, we will still be treated as the most honorable guests. I can’t tell if it’s referring to the Dark Abyss.”

The villages had existed for thousands of years. It was a miracle that they were still holding onto their traditions. It was expected that the things passed down generations after generations would not be perfectly preserved. In the case of Bo City, without the Underground Holy Spring and the people protecting it, no one would even know that Bo City was related to the villages, nor would they realize that they were the descendants of the Ancient King. People would only refer to themselves as children of the Yellow Emperor. It was impressive if anyone actually passed on their bloodline for a few hundred years.

As for two thousand years, it was almost impossible to say for sure!

“But, if you really want me to go down into the Dark Abyss, I can try. I’m already a sinner that has murdered my own tribe. I’m willing to sacrifice my life if it can give the millions of people in this city a chance,” said Fang Gu.

“I’m glad to hear that,” said Han Ji.

“President, I’ll go too,” said Su Xiaoluo.

Su Xiaoluo was also from the villages. If Fang Gu could enter the Dark Abyss safely, she would be safe too.

“The Dark Abyss is far from a safe place, you should just stay in the inner city,” Fang Gu shook his head.

“Fang Gu, can I ask you something?” asked Zhang Xiaohou.

“Go ahead,” said Fang Gu.

“The Ash Plum I saw outside of the houses when I was at the Sunny Goat Village...” Zhang Xiaohou did not finish his sentence.

“The Ash Plum is actually one of our village’s traditions. It means that someone in the household has passed away,” answered Fang Gu calmly.

“Every house has it, does that mean the whole village is dead?” asked Zhang Xiaohou.

“Mm, what you saw were living dead. I just wanted them to make it back to the city and stay there for seven days, before I will cremate them together with the houses. You Battlemages just happened to visit the village during that time... I had no choice but to control the living dead and interact with you, asking you to leave the village as soon as possible. The Ash Plum in front of every house does mean that they were all dead. So you already noticed that?” replied Fang Gu.

“I remember when my grandfather passed away, my family placed it in front of the house, so I felt it was familiar when I was at your village,” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“So, you think you too have the lineage of the villages, and you too want to go to the Dark Abyss?” said Fang Gu.

Zhang Xiaohou said with a nod, “If you can go down there, I should be able to go too. Since it’s an imperial tomb, it’s going to be dangerous in there still. We can look after one another.”

“What if you aren’t one of them?” blurted out Zhou Ming.
