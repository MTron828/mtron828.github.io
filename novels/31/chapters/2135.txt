Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan felt like they were stuck between a dozen interconnected volcanoes. The combined ash had formed a terrifying black mushroom cloud. The scorching lava kept surging at them, leaving them with no place to stand.

“My Earth Element won’t be able to stop it. Mo Fan, I don’t think the two of us can defeat it!” Zhao Manyan called out.

The layer of protection he had applied to them with the Earth Element would melt in seconds because of the lava. No matter how quickly Zhao Manyan was producing the rock, he still could not match the speed of the lava melting it.

“Why don’t you try using your Earth Element?” Zhao Manyan taunted Mo Fan.

“Damn it, are you really trying to pick a fight with me at a time like this? My Circle of Crystal Teeth: Heavenly Gate needs to accumulate shards first. I can only set up a pig pen at most. Just focus, I’ll show him what I’ve got!” Mo Fan snapped back.

Zhao Manyan’s pride must have suffered a huge blow recently. He was acting strangely.

Mo Fan knew Zhao Manyan had yet to show his true strength. If he did not treat the fight seriously, they could turn into mincemeat at any second!

“It’s jumping up. That thing is jumping at us!” Zhao Manyan suddenly pointed down and yelled.

Mo Fan lowered his head and saw the creature’s lava-covered head was less than a hundred meters from him. It was not a big deal since they could easily dodge it with the reaction speed of a Mage, but the magical silver light it was emitting would be a problem.

The silver magical light had significantly magnified the area of its power. Mo Fan could sense a powerful force approaching from the vast sea below. Even Blink was not enough to get him to a safe distance!

The Tyrant Titan’s attacks had insane areas of effect. It was trying to destroy the little humans, together with the whole area!

“Old Zhao, it’s all you now!” Mo Fan decisively stood behind Zhao Manyan.

“Up to me my ass, why didn’t you just let it go in the first place?!” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

A Silver Moon Tyrant Titan...

Any Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was at least at the Ruler-level, not to mention an adult Silver Moon Tyrant Titan! Zhao Manyan had almost died when he tried to save the people in Athens, and now they were fighting one that was even stronger! No matter how diligent he was, he would never catch up to Mo Fan’s speed at trying to get himself killed!

A silver light sprang at the moon. Its overwhelming energy left white cracks across the sky. It looked as if rays of light were pouring down from the gaps between the clouds, yet it was actually the space being distorted by waves of energy!

Space was like a calm surface of water. Any energy that landed on it would only result in a slight ripple, which would return to calm eventually. However, when the energy was too strong, it would create a hole, resulting in a maelstrom as the hole was being filled!

Zhao Manyan had watched the fight between Baxia and Qiu Chi. Every time they had collided with one another, the space would crack apart and produce these same little vortexes!

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was already strong enough to break the space around it. If they could not gather enough elemental energy to defend themselves, they would be shredded to pieces!

“Mo Fan, we can’t beat it, prepare to run!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“Even you can’t withstand its attacks?” Mo Fan was surprised.

“Just tag him with your Shadow Element. I’ll explain it to you once we retreat!” Zhao Manyan said.

“The tag doesn’t guarantee we can find it again. It’s a pity if we let it go now!” Mo Fan complained.

“Brother, I’m more than happy to do that if it will save our lives!” Zhao Manyan replied to that.

Mo Fan looked at Zhao Manyan and noticed his face was pale. He must have sustained internal injuries from the impact.

If Zhao Manyan’s defenses were not effective against the Tyrant Titan, he would not last for long either!

“Let’s go!” Mo Fan did not hesitate any further. He grabbed Zhao Manyan and fled into the shadows.

The Tyrant Titan was not willing to give up when it saw the two humans running away.

After chasing them for a few kilometers, it noticed some lights approaching from the north, flying over like meteors. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Tyrant Titan decisively gave up its pursuit when it realized the humans’ backup had arrived. It swung its arms to the sides and split the sea in half. The huge waves rolled fiercely as the line extended into the horizon.

The waves completely blocked everyone’s view. Water fell from the sky like it was raining. The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was quite gone by the time the lights arrived.

“Damn it, it ran away again!” Lucas shouted angrily.

“We didn’t arrange for our men to guard this area. A Hunter Group did request they be allowed to watch this place, but they didn’t notify us when the Tyrant Titan appeared. I wonder if...”

“Track it down, don’t let it escape!” Lucas interrupted.

The Mages immediately split up into groups to search for the Tyrant Titan, but the sea creatures were better at concealing their presence than creatures on land. Their efforts were in vain.

Tuis arrived around ten minutes later. His mount was a flying horse in dark golden barding.

The knights of the Parthenon Temple were very concerned about their appearance, but Tuis’ Golden Armor Flying Horse was obviously a few levels higher than the Golden Sun Knights’ mounts. If anyone were to compare him to Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan, it was like the difference between beggars and an emperor.

“Mo Fan, can you please buy your own Wing Magical Equipment? It’s not like you can’t afford it,” Zhao Manyan grumbled while carrying Mo Fan in the air.

“I haven’t found anything that suits me. I don’t want to waste my money!” Mo Fan sniffed.

Tuis pulled in on his flying horse and strutted proudly beside them. The grin on his face clearly indicated his disdain for their style of transportation tool.

It was like someone who was driving a sports car stumbling into a high school classmate riding an old bicycle, not to mention he was also carrying another person on the bicycle!

“You two are more useless than I thought. You’ve let the Tyrant Titan escape!” Tuis sneered.

“Aren’t you the Tyrant Titan expert? Why didn’t you come here earlier than us?” Mo Fan shot right back.

“It’s because I know that thing isn’t the culprit that destroyed Green Sprouts City. Capturing it will only calm the people’s resentment temporarily!” Tuis sniffed.

“I knew that too, so I didn’t want to waste my time!” Mo Fan promptly agreed with him.
