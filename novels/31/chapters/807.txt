Jiang Shaoxu had short legs and no movement spells. The Psychic Magician would surely be left behind when the team was running.

Zu Jiming was beside her, and totally lacked the demeanor of a gentleman. He was running away with Earth Wave, yet he did not even bother helping Jiang Shaoxu with the same spell. Soon, Jiang Shaoxu was left behind on her own.

“Assholes, you bunch of assholes! Come back here and save me!” cursed Jiang Shaoxu, running for her life.

She quickly summoned her Magic Boots, yet the magic equipment could barely outrun a Warrior-level creature. It was nowhere enough to help her run away from the Commander-level Blue Valley Ferocious Beasts.

A giant shadow loomed over Jiang Shaoxu. She could already smell the briny stench of the creature behind her.

“Jiang Shaoxu, behind you!” yelled Nanyu.

“Only one of them is following us?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“Yeah, just one.”

“Prepare for battle!” Ai Jiangtu was quite the reckless type, too. He stopped running when he realized only one Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was chasing after them.

Ai Jiangtu turned around. A silver Star Constellation had already appeared under his feet.

His speed at channeling Advanced Spells was a lot more fluent and faster than a dabbler like Mo Fan. Ai Jiangtu vanished as soon as he finished constructing the Star Constellation.

The next moment, Ai Jiangtu was at the back of the team, right beside Jiang Shaoxu.

Jiang Shaoxu was hugging her boobs, which were bouncing wildly as she was running. She was surprised when she saw a man appearing beside her out of nowhere...

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast did not swing its spiked arms. It lifted one of its pointy legs with a hint of disdain, before slashing it down like a sharp knife, trying to nail Jiang Shaoxu with its leg!

“Telekinesis!” Ai Jiangtu lifted his ferocious gaze and fearlessly stared at the creature’s leg, which was powerful enough to penetrate the concrete.

His stare applied a great resistance to the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s leg. The limb halted halfway in the air, as if the creature was having trouble pushing it down any further. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Does the captain have to be so reckless!?”

The team turned around and saw Ai Jiangtu standing before the creature. His relatively minuscule figure was firm and imperious, as if he was having a showdown with the Commander-level creature!

Jiang Shaoxu knew she was not ideal to fight in close-quarters combat. She immediately ran to the middle of the team without hesitation.

The others immediately switched into battle mode when they saw their captain engaging, especially when they remembered that Ai Jiangtu was the one allocating the resources among the team members. They quickly turned around and fought the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast.

The brilliance of a dozen Star Patterns combined as spells of different Elements poured down on the creature, including burning pillars, ice chains, lightning strikes, tornado gusts, and demon vines...

Teamwork was incredibly important when a team was fighting a demon creature. By combining spells of different Elements on the same target, the effects were outstanding. Most demon creatures would find their heads spinning when being blasted by spells from all directions!

That being said, it was not easy to inflict damage on the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast. Even though all the spells had landed on the creature, they merely knocked it back without dealing much damage. The spells mostly left some dents on the creature’s scales and armor.

“Whoever has the Poison Element, use it to corrode that annoying armor of the creature first, or else we won’t deal any damage to the creature even if we expend all our energy!” yelled Li Kaifeng when he noticed that their spells only had minimal effects.

Zu Jiming was the Poison Magician on the team. He was standing at the back of the team. He opened his hand, revealing the Poison Cavity on his palm. Tiny poisonous wasps flew out of the Poison Cavity like smoke.

The movement of the poisonous wasps was rather slow. They finally reached the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast, but the creature was extremely alert. It opened its mouth and roared.

The roar produced a strong and humid gust with a high level of humidity. It immediately shattered the dark cloud of poisonous wasps.

“That thing is quite intelligent; it’s very experienced with fights against Magicians,” noted Zu Jiming.

Most creatures would simply ignore the tiny wasps, allowing the Poison Element to take down its target by surprise. To their surprise, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast did not bother dodging the Intermediate Spells, yet it immediately shattered the swarm of poisonous wasps when it came close. It was obvious that someone had used the same trick on the creature before, so it realized that the Poison Element was able to penetrate its sturdy scales!

“It’s charging toward us, back off!”

Ai Jiangtu had reached his limit. He quickly blinked away when he saw the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast lunging once again.

Ai Jiangtu blinked to the roof of a building that was around twenty meters high. He was able to get a clear view of Blue Valley Ferocious Beast from this angle...

He did not notice it at first, but on second thought, he realized that the Commander-level creature was fully covered in thick armor, except for its head, which was fully exposed!

A weak point!

Ai Jiangtu was overwhelmed with joy. He did not expect to discover the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s weakness when he moved to a higher spot...

“Its head is not covered by scales!” Ai Jiangtu immediately relayed the information to the rest of the team.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was smashing its way forward. The others immediately escaped to the narrow alleyways nearby. The layout of the buildings in the East Maritime Fortress looked simple on the surface, but actually favored the Magicians. The huge buildings and the alleyways between them prevented the creatures from easily pursuing Magicians,and provided great cover for those that were not suitable for close-distance combat.

“Brother, none of us can fly, it doesn’t make any difference even if we know where its weakness is, there’s no way we can attack its head!” Jiang Yu yelled at Ai Jiangtu from where he was taking cover in one of the alleyways.

However, as soon as he finished the sentence, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast blocked off the entrance of the alleyway. Its eyestalk was looking right down the narrow path.

The creature completely blocked off the light coming into the alleyway where Jiang Yu had entered. The man was soaked in cold sweat and no longer dared to stay around any longer.

In the creature’s eyes, Jiang Yu was like a little mouse who had escaped into a tiny gap. Luckily, the buildings were rather solid. Even a Commander-level creature would need some time to destroy them!

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was losing its temper. It slammed its four arms into the building, trying to force its way down the narrow path. Jiang Yu immediately took off and ran toward the other end of the alleyway.

“Damn, such remarkable design!” Jiang Yu was impressed by the Japanese’s intelligence when he saw that the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was greatly hindered by the buildings!

“Jiang Yu, Jiang Yu, not that way!” Jiang Yu heard someone scream amid the loud noises produced by the collapsing buildings.

“Are you telling me to run into the creature’s mouth? I will if I don’t run this way!” cursed Jiang Yu, who was obviously in a panic.
