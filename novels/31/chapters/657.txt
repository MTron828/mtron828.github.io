Mo Fan’s mind was inundated with hatred. It felt like thousands of ghosts were whispering, crying and murmuring into his ears gently, asking if he was interested in listening to their stories.

When you heard it the first time, you might feel pitiful toward the ‘girl’ who had fallen into the Dark Abyss. The second time, you might feel she did not deserve to bear the pain, but after hearing it for the third, fourth and fifth times...

She never stopped talking. She would even forcibly insert the sorrowful memory into your mind, just so you could experience the pain and torture, too. However, if you showed any hint of impatience, the ghost would instantly turn into a roaring black figure, completely destroying its previous appearance of a pitiful woman!

“Feel my pain!”

“Come and feel my pain!”

“I’ve spent a long time here. I have many things to say, are you willing to hear them... oh, no, you’re not willing, you’re not willing! How dare you! Do you have any idea how torturing it is!?”

Mo Fan felt like he had entered a messy dream as he was falling into the Dark Abyss. He continuously experienced the past of these ghosts, each so torturing that he simply had the urge to bite his tongue and end his life!

It was a very lengthy process. More than ten thousand ghosts were surrounding him. Each was expressing their pain to him, and even placing him into their nightmares. Endless repetitions of being hung and dying, drowning, beaten to death, or buried alive in their coffins...

Mo Fan felt like he was no longer himself. His past was being overwritten by the ghosts. His memories were being devoured by them, as if he was involved in an endless repetition of some scenes from various horror movies. Even though there were different kinds of experience, he somehow felt each of them to be quite familiar!

The light had protected him from the chill wind, yet his mind was on the verge of crumbling. The faint glow emitted by the Focus necklace was completely useless. The hatred from the ghosts was strong enough to overwhelm everything!

The Dark Abyss was not deep, but its hatred was. It simply felt like a bottomless hole of pain!

——

After endless times of going through the process, going through thousands of years, Mo Fan had no idea how much of his own experience and memory over the past twenty years were left. The moment his eyes sprang open, he doubted it was real!

Gradually, the things that belonged to him slowly came back. However, he simply sat there for a very long time, as he was extremely worn out from the situation before.

A dream...

A lengthy dream...

To his relief, the things that did not belong to his memory slowly dissipated.

“Mo Fan?” asked a gentle voice beside him.

Mo Fan slowly recovered. He glanced at Liu Ru, whose clothes were in disarray. Her attractive face was worried, like a weeping beauty, except there were no tears.

“Liu Ru... you look fine?” Mo Fan was confused when he saw the clear look in Liu Ru’s eyes.

“You were hugging me all along, it has only been seconds since we landed, but you acted strangely just now. You didn’t even react when I called you a few times,” said Liu Ru.

“A few seconds?” Mo Fan smiled wryly...

“The others were feeling dizzy too, but we actually made it to the bottom safely. I thought we were going to be torn into pieces by those creatures and devoured by the zombies. It turns out that there’s a pit at the bottom of the abyss. The zombies did not attack us, so we ended up rolling into the pit, and wound up here...” Liu Ru told him in relief.

Mo Fan finally started checking his surroundings. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He could now tell that the Dark Abyss actually consisted of different layers.

The first layer was the Dark Abyss full of phantoms and mountains of zombies. Most of the time, any living creatures that fell into it would be torn into pieces and turned into one of them. It was a terrifying abyss that even the Nether Bone Ruler and Lu Huan had no chance of surviving...

Meanwhile, below the Dark Abyss, there was another space!

This place was fairly spacious, to the extent that it felt like they had arrived in another world.

Mo Fan was quite confused as he studied his surroundings, but after he calmed down, the place somehow resembled the Summoned Beast Plane, which he entered in the past after casting Dimensional Summoning.

That being said, the space he was in was not as vast as the Summoned Beast Plane. The gray land under his feet looked like a flat hilltop. Glancing into the distance, he saw the whole place was surrounded by a dim sky.

“There’s a white imperial palace there, it must be the imperial tomb we’re looking for,” said Liu Ru as she pointed at something not far away.

Mo Fan immediately looked in that direction. The white palace was rather eye-catching. It was completely made of white jade stones. Its surface was so smooth that they could see the reflection of the sky on it.

Although the white of the palace should make it feel noble and sacred, it looked more like the white decorating a place for the deceased, resulting in an eerie atmosphere. The smooth structure was covered in the strong smell of death.

“Where...where am I?” asked Zhang Xiaohou.

Mo Fan’s attention was so attracted by the white palace tomb that he did not even notice Zhang Xiaohou recovering from the same nightmare he’d had. Mo Fan could easily tell that Zhang Xiaohou had also gone through the same painful experience when he saw the empty look in his eyes.

As a matter of fact, if the memories they shared during the torturing repetition of deaths did not go away, the overwhelming hatred and memories would simply replace their own experience and beliefs, and they would most likely suffer from schizophrenia!

“The Ancient King is remarkably talented with the Space Element. I learned that a small place can actually conceal an enormous space inside it when I first visited the Three Step Tower. That’s only achievable by compressing the space, yet to create a world like this in an abyss that continuously drifts to different places... this is nothing that the world has ever seen before!” While being utterly relieved to be alive, Mo Fan could not help but exclaim his astonishment at discovering the Ancient King’s incredible capabilities at utilizing the Space Element!

The intelligence and capabilities that the Ancient King possessed to place his tomb here somehow made the Magic Civilization two thousand years later seemed petty.

Zhang Xiaohou gasped when he too saw the white palace tomb.

The tomb of the Ancient King!

The imperial tomb really was under the Dark Abyss!

And the person that was buried inside was regarded as the most ambitious emperor of the past five thousand years!
