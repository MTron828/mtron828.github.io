Chapter 2728: Ancient Raiju

The Golden Sea Hunter Group looked strangely at Hai Huodao. He had made such a sudden change in his approach. Didn’t he say that he wanted to shred Mo Fan from limb to limb and throw him in the sea for the sharks?

Hai Huodao had called this kid ‘spirited’ and called him a dragon among men. Everyone wondered how Hai Huodao, a cold-blooded executioner, had become so cunning. Wasn’t Boss Jin the shrewd and calculative one?

Hai Huodao’s hunters forced an amiable smile when they saw Mo Fan. The same kind of polite and embarrassed smile that appeared on someone’s face when their parents forced them to get acquainted with a distant relative.

“Oh? If I didn’t know better, I would have assumed you gathered your men to take me on. A little disappointing. I wanted to test the ability of this ancient elf.” Mo Fan sighed.

“Brother, I am also a Summoning element mage! I know I am not in a position to advise you but I must say that I understand the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower very well indeed. If Raiju is placed in a superior environment, its strength is not inferior to an average ruler. Hehe!” Hai Huodao smiled.

Boss Jin’s expression changed after hearing Hai Huodao’s words as did the hunters who came with them. They tried to appear sheepish and innocent.

“I always thought that lightning storms were common in this area. There should be a very strong Lightning element around here. Are you saying that Raiju can demonstrate the power of an average ruler?” Mo Fan asked.

Hai Huodao had broken out in cold sweat which slid down all the way to his spine. “That’s right, that’s right. It’s our pleasure to meet with such a young, handsome, and talented man like you. Brother, should you need any help in the future, just let me know. If there’s nothing else, we’ll leave now…”

Mo Fan glanced at Hai Huodao and then at Boss Jin. He sighed. ‘Since they are being so polite and well-mannered, I can’t possibly insist on fighting them,’ thought Mo Fan. ‘Such a waste.’

“Of course,” said Mo Fan. “Go on, then. It’s very nice to meet you all.” He waved at them.

The Golden Sea Hunter Group was relieved. They smiled and waved as they neared the woods. They were relieved and they never wanted to show their faces here again.

After they left, Shu Xiaohua walked to Mo Fan. “So, the hunters are actually nice people,” she said. “I thought they were here to cause trouble. Big Sister Ying is right. You should never judge a book by its cover. Boss Jin and Boss Hai looked so intimidating, but they were so nice and polite.”

Mo Fan nodded. “Indeed,” he said, “There are many nice people in the world.”

......

Mo Fan glanced at the pope-like elf flashing with lightning from its head to toe. He felt mixed emotions looking at it. He wanted to keep a low profile and yet he wasn’t able to control himself.

Mo Fan sighed. If this went on, he would never get around to perfecting his other elements. He rubbed his temple. Maybe it was time to return to Dean Xiao for another round of intense training. Dean Xiao could seal his major elements leaving him with no choice but to improve the ones which weren’t sealed.

“Howl! Howl!”

The Royal Pattern Wolf returned to Mo Fan and howled incessantly.

“Have you found the creature that killed the Copper-horned Yak?” Mo Fan’s eyes lit up.

“Howl!” The Royal Pattern Wolf howled in affirmation.

“Go after it! I’m going to slaughter it and offer its head to the Copper-horned Yak!” Mo Fan said furiously.

Mo Fan was irritated that he could not find a suitable enemy to test Raiju’s abilities. He thought the Royal Pattern Wolf had returned to its mother. But here he was! It hadn’t forgotten the murder of Copper-horned Yak.

...

Mo Fan followed Old Wolf and chased after the predator. Raiju floated after them.

The Royal Pattern Wolf led Mo Fan to the seaside. It was actually half of the ancient city which had become submerged. The houses and streets were visible below the water, covered with seaweed and water ferns.

The Royal Pattern Wolf became more cautious. Mo Fan also became more vigilant. Their opponent was extremely evasive so they must take care not to alert it. It would be very difficult to find it again if they scared it away.

As the water receded in waves, the roof of some of the houses came into view. The roof was covered in green muck. Mo Fan wondered about their past inhabitants.

A sea-lion was lying on the roof. Its claws were long like a leopard’s. Its tail curved into a weapon which looked very sharp. It moved its tail back and forth leisurely.

Mo Fan recalled the slash on Copper-horned Yak’s stomach. He thought that it had been gnashed by claws. But he now realized that Copper-horned Yak’s stomach was sliced open by that anchor-like sharp tail.

“That accursed creature is sunbathing and enjoying itself!” Mo Fan scowled.

A sea beast’s carcass lay near the creature. Fresh blood gushed out of it. The creature faced the sea. It occasionally leaned down to take a fresh bite out of the carcass.

“Buzz!” The air vibrated with heavy electromagnetism as Raiju floated behind Mo Fan. Apparently, the creature could not disguise itself or remain quiet, for that matter.

Raiju sensed Mo Fan’s murderous intent. The lightning cloak, draped from its shoulder to toe, opened slightly, as if the pope was enlightened by God’s words.

Its impassive eyes flashed. The clear sky turned cloudy. Raiju’s ancient elf magical cloak shaded the afternoon sun. The light dimmed.

A crack of lightning arched across the dim sky and lit it up with a thunderous roar.

The anchor-tailed sea lion raised its head. It often came to this place and lightning in this place was common. It didn’t pay much attention to the crackling lightning. But when the lightning struck the sea and snaked towards it, the anchor-tailed sea lion finally realized that the lightning was after him. It fled so fast that it was almost a blur.

“Stop it!” Mo Fan hissed at Raiju.

Raiju did not stop. It manipulated the lightning into a fence which blocked the anchor-tailed sea lion’s escape, forcing it to retreat to where it had run from.

Whenever it tried to turn and escape from the other side, the lightning stopped it in its tracks.
