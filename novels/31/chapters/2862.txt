Chapter 2863: The Totem Beasts Gathered Together

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Pyrim!

There was a long cry in the sky. A green eagle-like silhouette dived down before spreading its wings and hovering above the Azure Dragon’s head.

The Green East Sea God flapped its wings and brought up a strong wind. The wind then turned into a muddy storm and covered the areas near the Bund. The air was rife with holiness and savagery.

Mo Fan thought the encounter between the Black Totem Snake and the Black Totem Turtle had inspired them to unleash their totem beast power. However, he noticed the Green East Sea God’s feathers were gleaming, too. It radiated an aura different from before!

Mo Fan turned around and realized the seal of the sacred totem beast was still there on the Azure Dragon’s body. The curvy and densely packed symbols spread all over its body.

The three greatest totem beasts—The Black Totem Snake, the Black Totem Turtle, and the Green East Sea God—had similar symbols glowing faintly on their bodies.

The Black Totem Snake had symbols that resembled snake scales. The Black Totem Turtle had symbols that resembled turtle shell curse. Meanwhile, the Green East Sea God had symbols that resembled feathers.

The symbols that resembled the snake scales and feathers were parts of the Azure Dragon’s seal of the sacred totem beast. After the Azure Dragon awakened, it stimulated the ancient totem beasts’ true potential.

Roar!

The Azure Dragon illuminated and summoned the totem beasts’ source of power. A holy beast covered in snow-white fur charged at them from the west.

As it sped, the gushing water turned into thick ice.

Frosts rained. Heaven and Earth froze. The creature displayed a strong aura of divinity. It made it look as if it had descended from the divine realm and was only momentarily dabbling into this filthy earth.

“It’s the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger!” The chief of the Eastern Mage cried out in awe.

Tianshan Mountain was a holy place, and many Mages had visited and lived there. But the legend of the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger had remained something of a myth which sounded fascinating but was far from reality.

Tianshan Mountain was very far from the Magic City. They wondered why the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger appeared in the city!

The Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger could inflict enormous destruction on the Ocean Demons. The Ocean Demons had taken great pains in summoning the waves, but the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger froze a large part of the waves so easily.

The high-level Ocean Demons could summon the waves and rains. But the little demons were stranded on the beach like lonesome sharks. Even though these little demons had sharp fangs and were strong, they could no longer pose threats to the Mages.

Swoosh!

A flying creature, that usually only appeared under the moonlight, advanced towards the Magic City from the same direction as the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger.

Its wings were almost transparent, but they had a dreamy luster. It was different from the powerful Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger that could freeze the lands. It gave off an air of holiness like a nymph under the moon at night. It granted people a sense of peace and tranquility.

The Ocean Demons were rampant, and their demonic auras filled the city. The citizens lived in fear and trepidation. But when they stared at the Moon Moth Phoenix, they felt an unprecedented calmness.

It was the Black Totem Turtle, the Black Totem Snake, the Green East Sea God, the White Tiger, and the Moon Moth Phoenix!

The five great totem beasts appeared all at once. They surrounded the Azure Dragon’s head. The totem beasts responded to each other. Hence, their totem holy power reached a pinnacle. They glowed in radiant holy light. This was especially so for the Azure Dragon.

The Azure Dragon was green in color. It was barely visible in the dark sky. After the arrival of the five great totem beasts, the seal of the sacred totem beast that covered the Azure Dragon’s body glowed brightly.

The totem beasts responded to each other. At that moment, each of them underwent a metamorphosis.

Even Mo Fan was astonished. He was very familiar with each totem beast. But today, he finally saw their true forms. They were glowing with holy symbols. Before this, the totem beasts were always in their beastly form which was no different than demons. However, today, the totem beasts had transformed into their true form. They had ancient gods with the holy seal of a totem beast!

The little demon army had been hissing all over the city. Upon sensing the imposing and holy aura, they fell silent.

Meanwhile, the Ocean Demons surrounding the Demon Lord panicked. They had to confront their greatest enemies.

The Forbidden Mages from the Forbidden Curse Association were so shocked that they were rendered speechless. They had never expected the totem beasts, which had disappeared long ago, to be the ones to stand up for them and protect the Magic City.

Gawk!

The Demon Lord made a strange sound. It seemed to be telling the Ocean Demons that they had nothing to be afraid of with those very few totem beasts.

The place was not filled with the totem beasts. There were only five of them, after all.

Many totem beasts had become extinct, and some of them still remained unknown. The totem beasts before them were the remnants from the Holy War. Meanwhile, there were four Emperor-level Ocean Demons and many Ruler-level, Super-level, Supreme-Ruler, Semi-emperor level Ocean Demons among the horde.

With such power in their group, the Ocean Demons had no worries about not being able to destroy the small city!

“President Hong Wu, with the help of the five great totem beasts and the Azure Dragon, is a glimmer of hope in this war?” asked a Mage in plain clothes floating in midair.

Hong Wu looked up and saw the mage was none other than the Water Element Forbidden Mage, Dean Xiao.

Dean Xiao landed. He stood on the ruined Bund where he could get a full view of the city below. The Huangpu River was filled with Dragon Demons. When he arrived at the river, the river became calm and still. The river and sea water flowed quietly. Even though there were many powerful Ocean Demons on the other side of the river, Dean Xiao had it under control.

Dean Xiao alone suppressed the Ocean Demons’ demonic auras. The Demon Lord fixed its scary gaze on him. Its gaze was filled with hostility and hatred.

“The Magic City will not be destroyed! We’ll fight the Ocean Demons to the end!” President Hong Wu summoned his courage and shouted at the sky.

‘Was it true that the Magic City was already in a hopeless state?’

The arrival of the sacred totem beast and the five great totem beasts were still no match for the swarm of Ocean Demons.

‘But the Magic City belonged to the humans!’ resolved President Hong Wu. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The humans consisted of the Forbidden Curse Association, Super-level Union, and an army made up of endless Intermediate and Basic-level Mages!

“Listen to my instructions. Forbidden Mages, gather at the Bund!” President Hong Wu shouted again. He hoisted a flag emanating purple electric light into the sky.

It was the Magic Association’s rally flag!

Mo Fan had seen the same rally flag back when he was at the Ancient Capital. He had never guessed how many Forbidden Mages and experts resided in the Magic City. Today, he finally had his eyes open.

“Listen to my instructions. Super-level Union, gather at the Bund!” The chief of the Eastern Mage raised a blue electric banner. His banner glowed, just like the purple flag.
