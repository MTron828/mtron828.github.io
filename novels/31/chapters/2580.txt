Mo Fan’s chest had a hole blown through it.

It was unlikely anyone could survive the wound, let alone the deadly poison on the stinger.

Su Lu was glad Mo Fan was dead.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa was supposed to be stronger with the advantages she had over Mo Fan, who was also a bishop, but Su Lu knew the man who had mastered Magic Fusion was not going to be simple, either. Everything was worth it as long as he was dead!

The flames were still burning. The lice were indeed the perfect fuel. The fire had not stopped burning across the tile. It was blazing red, just like a volcanic crater.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s stinger fell to the ground. It had surprisingly remained intact in the flames.

Mo Fan chest was blown open, but he was still alive. He bent forward and picked up the stinger like it was something valuable.

Su Lu was baffled. He could not help but think there was something wrong with the man. Why did he still care about the loot when he was about to die?

The flames suddenly swayed as a special golden light appeared amid them.

The light grew stronger and changed the color of the flames around it.

Mo Fan stood in the golden Phoenix Flame like he was bathing in a healing light. His chest was closing up rapidly.

The self-rejuvenating ability of the Phoenix Flame!

Mo Fan had to thank the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s lice for providing him with a perfect ‘bath’. He could not have healed up his wounds and come back alive with his own flames.

The burning lice were strong enough to activate the Phoenix Flame’s ability!

The power of the Phoenix Flame!

Mo Fan put the Medusa’s stinger away and smiled at Su Lu.

Su Lu watched Mo Fan’s resurrection with wide eyes. He so wished he could go over and kill him right now!

“The Four-Eyed Bird!...” Su Lu snarled, realizing something.

Su Lu was familiar with the Totem Beasts too, so he recognized the Four-Eyed Bird’s power in no time.

Why would Mo Fan have a Totem Beast’s ability?

Can humans inherit a Totem Beast’s power?

How did he do it?

The Four-Eyed Bird’s ability was definitely one of the strongest among the Totem Beasts. If a Forbidden Mage had the ability to be revived, would they even be afraid of the Emperors?

Disaster! That man is a true disaster!

Double Innate Elements, the Demon Element, the Magic Fusion, and the undying flesh of the Four-Eyed Bird. He could already slay a powerful Ruler like the Crimson Scorpion Medusa, even though he was only a Super Mage. If he became a Forbidden Mage, even the Angels would struggle to take him down!

The thought gave Su Lu a huge fright.

He initially thought the Archangel was his greatest enemy. Once he killed Sharjah, he would be able to rule over the world, yet it turned out there were even more threats to his ambitions.

Su Lu had not known the Demon Element existed before the battle in Dubai City. He had never witnessed Mo Fan’s extraordinary strength before, either.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa had died, despite the advantages she had.

If the guy reached the peak of the Super Level with all his Elements, he could easily wipe out an army of Super Mages by himself, without even relying on a Forbidden Curse!

“Well done!” Mu Bai raised his thumb at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was as strong as usual. Even the Lord of Darkness had underestimated his strength!

The Lord of Darkness had already removed one of Mo Fan’s Contracted Beasts. If Apas was allowed to participate in the fights, he might?even?be able to take on the enemy queen!

“Lord of Darkness, are you going to give me the Spring of Darkness too?” Mo Fan had fully recovered from his injuries. His smile was oddly wild in the dancing flames.

“Of course!” the Lord of Darkness nodded. His face looked calm, but the Lord of Darkness was actually panicking inside.

He seemed to have made a terrible mistake! However, he still had to try his best to take out as many enemy pieces as possible.

The Spring of Darkness blessing increased Mo Fan’s strength by fifty percent.

The Spring of Darkness could strengthen every ability, except for White Magic. It was like a booster that would awaken a person’s full potential, similar to the Blessing Element.

Naturally enough, the Lord of Darkness’s Spring of Darkness was a lot more effective here than the Blessing Element. After all, the Lord of Darkness was the origin of Dark Magic!

It did not matter which generation the current Lord of Darkness was. He was still the primogenitor of Dark Magic, ruling over the Dark Plane whose existence was comparable to the living world. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

If gods existed, then the Lord of Darkness would be one of them!

“I feel pretty good!” Mo Fan felt energized after being blessed by the Spring of Darkness.

“It’s our turn now!” Mu Bai agreed.

Mo Fan’s strength had already increased by fifty percent, and he was also the attacker now. He could easily take on anyone as he pleased!

“I’ll leave Su Lu’s accomplices to you,” Mu Bai said to Mo Fan, pointing at the nearest enemy rook.

“My pleasure,” Mo Fan grinned when he saw the Skybound Mages.

Hadn’t they tried to hide their filthy crimes by using the Skybound Cloud Battlefield?

They were dressed in white robes, had stayed in the Dubai Magician Tower, and were praised and respected by countless people throughout Asia, yet they could no longer distinguish between good and evil.

Mo Fan would be amused if any among them dared to claim they were innocent.

The Skybound Mages were merely Su Lu’s pawns. Mo Fan had not had the chance to purge them in Dubai City. It was time to finish his business from there!

“Stay calm, we have the numbers advantage. We are the elites among Super Mages. There’s no reason for us to be afraid of one guy,” the leader of the Skybound Mages spoke up.

He was the chief of the Skybound Mages. He had the face of an Asian, but the color of his eyes was not common for an Asian. He was most likely a mixed-blood.

The chief of the Skybound Mages was trying his best to motivate the Skybound Mages. The only problem was that the other Skybound Mages were not blind. They had seen Mo Fan taking out the experts of the Magic Association, and the Crimson Scorpion Medusa just now.

Could they really think of him as just a normal Mage?

“Don’t panic, his ability to self-rejuvenate requires a natural source of fire, or an extremely strong fire. You won’t have any problem killing him by restricting his flames!” Su Lu called out to them.

“Thank you for your warning!” the chief of the Skybound Mages replied quickly.

“Rest assured, you all have been with me for a long time. I, Su Lu, will lead you and trample everything in our path. Nothing can stop us!” Su Lu proclaimed.

The Lord of Darkness coughed.

Su Lu immediately felt anxious. How did something like the Lord of Darkness even exist in the world?!
