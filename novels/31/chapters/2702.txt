Chapter 2703: At the Stage of Being Ripped Apart

??

The Monstrous Claw Emperor was the mastermind who controlled the ocean King Skeleton and took three apex-grade mages from the Oriental Pearl Tower. Mo Fan still remembered that powerful strike. If the Monstrous Claw Emperor appeared again, it would wipe out everyone in the Pudong ocean area.

Mo Fan was terrified as he remembered there were creatures in this world which could easily kill him. However, his terror was also his source of motivation to keep moving forward. The world, the country, and the city were not as peaceful as they appeared to be. His greatest source of comfort would always come from his own strength.

“Are you ready to take down the monster?” Zhao Manyan asked excitedly.

“Take down? I’m not strong enough to do that yet. I want to force it to reveal itself and gauge its strength. Taking on the emperor is not the same as taking on other demons. It requires a meticulous plan. The emperor is extremely cautious. It sends the prophets of the Godly Horde to hide among humans in order to acquire the mages’ reserves and find out the number of Forbidden Mages that are present. Meanwhile, it uses Ruler-level Ocean Demons as vanguards to lure out all the powerful mages and wipe them out. It slowly kills all powerful mages…

“Once they learn that we are no longer capable of defeating the Ocean Demons and Godly Horde, they will take the initiative to launch their attack.”

“They’re like a school of sharks; they will not swarm toward their prey when they see it. The ocean contains a variety of venomous creatures, stingers, and electric monsters. Although their victory is certain, their prey will fight back ferociously. The prey then deals a fatal blow to the sharks in its struggle.”

“Therefore, the sharks will opt for the most secure method. They surround and wander around their prey. They look for opportunities to take a bite before swimming away. They exhaust their prey and then swarm up to attack.”

“We’re at that stage now. We are surrounded and ripped apart one by one.”

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai ate the squid skewers while listening attentively.

“So that means, the Ocean Demons’ real attack hasn’t started yet?” asked Mo Fan.

Base City was the only livable city within 20,000 km. The Ocean Demons had forced the humans into a corner, but it seemed as if that wasn’t their strongest offense yet. How long had the Ocean Demons been plotting this for? How much strength did they keep hidden?

“We have to drag this stage out,” said Commander Hua.

“How do we do that?”

“By killing one of the emperors of the Ocean Demons so that the Ocean Godly Horde is aware of the humans’ power in launching counterattacks,” explained Commander Hua.

“So, you have to kill Eastern Ocean’s Monstrous Claw Emperor?” Mo Fan asked.

“Not exactly. If we go out into the ocean and find the demon stronger than expected, we will need to find another target. Unfortunately, we haven’t received any information about the Emperor of the South Ocean. The Ocean Demons are highly intelligent. I suspect that there is a hidden civilization under the ocean that is comparable to humans. I’ve never been this frustrated when fighting other emperors in the past.” Commander Hua nibbled on a squid, as if venting his dissatisfaction out on this poor delicacy.

“Ha… if only all ocean creatures were as harmless as squids, crayfishes, and hairy crabs, we’d be able to eat them all to extinction, considering the large population in our country.” Mo Fan heaved a sigh.

The situation was dire. According to Commander Hua’s description, people were forced into a corner in those areas. Some had to migrate to the west.

But the west was freezing cold. The supply of food and heat was a serious issue. The South King of Ocean was actually cutting off the humans’ last resort and forcing them to fight the Ocean Demons.

“I believe we won’t be of any help, will we, Commander Hua?” asked Zhao Manyan cautiously. “What made you reveal such information to us today?”

Zhao Manyan had a hunch that Commander Hua was going to ask them to fulfill a secret mission related to testing the waters for the emperor of the Ocean Demons. If that was true, Zhao Manyan was reluctant to join in. He did not even have children! He didn’t want to die so soon!

“Based on your progress in your respective cultivations, I believe all will fully master your powers in a couple of years. By then, you will be facing Forbidden Curse Tianhong. The Earth Fire Pistil is the key to unlock the Forbidden Curse Tianhong, and you are the ones who stand a chance to enter the realm of the Forbidden Curse. When you need this key, the Forbidden Curse Association will figure out how to get it for you, just like how I acquired the Earth Fire Pistil for the Fire Element mage who assisted me. You will also be given a Tianhong certificate,” Commander Hua said.

“Do you mean that if we donate an Earth Fire Pistil, our country will help us collect the Earth Fire Pistil when we need it to advance to the level of Forbidden Curse? The Tianhong certificate is equivalent to a blood donation certificate, if I am not mistaken. It is the sacred oath that if we help others, we will be given priority when we need help in the suture. Am I right?” asked Mo Fan.

“That’s right. The Forbidden Curse involves many parties. The government won’t disappoint you.” Commander Hua nodded.

“What a relief! In fact, I used to think of plundering it.” Mo Fan breathed out a sigh of relief.

“The squid skewers taste really good. I will definitely try this again if I visit here.”

“Commander Hua, people who say that don’t actually get to eat the squids from here again! There’s a possibility that we might have to grill the squid skewer before your tomb,” said Mo Fan.

Commander Hua smiled. “There’s no way I’m going to die that soon. Don’t worry.”

“You can’t be so sure about it.”

Commander Hua kept smiling. He stood up.

The trio quickly rose to their feet, too.No matter how easy-going Commander Hua was, he was still the most respectable soldier in the country. And he was going to face the most terrifying enemy in the Ocean Godly Horde. If he fell, the coastal defense would collapse…

After the trio bid farewell to Commander Hua, they finally heaved a sigh of relief. There was always a feeling of pressure especially when talking to such an infamous superior, especially when talking about life and death situations.

Commander Hua’s strength and support was the reason everyone lived a life of peace in the city, after all.

...

When they returned to Fanxue Mountain, they were greeted by a corpse as big as a mountain. The body hadn’t decayed yet so there was no stench. It looked so majestic that it would wake up any minute and devour the Xuexin City.

It was the Chief Shark!

Its zircon shark skin was exceptional. It was as solid and tough as alloy. It contained indefinite power to overturn the vast ocean itself.

Zhao Jing was afraid of the Chief Shark. Mo Fan and the rest of his group were no match for it either.

The huge body of the Chief Shark sank behind Fanxue Mountain. It was dead. Commander Hua had killed it alone. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was unimaginable how powerful he must be! Yet, someone as powerful as him had an enemy that he felt he could not subdue alone.
