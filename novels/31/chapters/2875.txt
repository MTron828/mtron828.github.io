Chapter 2877: The Azure Dragon’s Might

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Cold Moon Demon Lord had not expected the Azure Dragon to be so hot-tempered.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord moved back a little. Just then, the Ocean Queen stood up and glared at the sacred totem Azure Dragon with its red-amber eyes.

The Azure Dragon’s body was majestic and towering. It moved in the sky and almost covered it. Meanwhile, the Royal Skeleton Queen was the size of a human. The Azure Dragon saw it only as a small red grain of sand!

The Ocean Queen sneered. It raised its red head and let out a long shrill, like a woman singing in a high-pitched voice.

Bam!

One hundred thousand of Undead on the land disintegrated. They transformed into razor-sharp and terrifying weapons made of bones under the Ocean Queen’s chant. They formed an evil skeletal domain of a two-kilometer radius around the Ocean Queen!

The appearance of one hundred thousand bones was frightening. They floated above the Magic City like a red storm of disaster. The Ocean Queen used half of them to form a Red Bone Palace to protect itself, then transformed the other half into sharp weapons and aimed at the sacred totem Azure Dragon!

Striking a target with ten thousand arrows was a bloodcurdling sight. Having razor-sharp bones made up of fifty thousand Ocean Undead aimed at the target was unimaginable. If the razor-sharp weapons were aimed at a large city, the buildings, skyscrapers, and streets in that city would be riddled with holes.

The Super-level Union trembled in horror upon witnessing its incredible demonic power. The members of the Forbidden Curse Association broke out in cold sweat. This was just one of the Ocean Queen’s random undead spells!

The Azure Dragon was in the sky. The razor-sharp bones swarmed it. While everyone thought the Azure Dragon was bound to be injured, it charged headfirst toward the rain of scary red bones.

The red rain of bones swallowed its green silhouette. Even so, it still glowed in sacred totem light. The bone spears, bone spikes, and spinal bone tips of evil spirits shattered into pieces or were turned into dust the moment they clashed with the Azure Dragon.

The Azure Dragon was fearless. It continued to charge toward the Ocean Queen and the Cold Moon Demon Lord. It stretched out its front claws and lunged at the Red Bone Palace which held the Ocean Queen!

The Azure Dragon crushed the Red Bone Palace into pieces in a single claw. The shocking and terrifying claw mark lingered in the space. The Ocean Queen’s palace made up of bones collapsed.

The Ocean Queen unleashed one hundred thousand Undead bones to attack the Azure Dragon again. Half of them shattered into pieces the moment they met the Azure Dragon’s divine light while the other half collapsed with a single swing from its claw. While the humans suffered with hopelessness, the Azure Dragon beat the demons effortlessly.

The humans felt hopeful. Fury flashed in the Ocean Queen’s red-amber eyes.

It slowly raised its hand. Its long palm looked like a withered branch, and it pulled the clouds from the sky.

The clouds changed color. They turned as black as ink. Flashes of red lightning struck the earth. A withered bone claw gradually appeared from the sky under the terrifying light and grabbed the Azure Dragon by its neck.

The sacred totem Azure Dragon sensed it. It moved and dodged the scary withered bone claw.

The Ocean Queen continued to transfer its evil power to the clouds. Multiple withered bone claws appeared in the sky. In the middle of the red lightning storm, the withered bone claws were so large that it could crush a huge mountain range! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Azure Dragon moved its body. It swung its tail at the pitch-black sky at an incredible angle. When it struck with its tail, ripples appeared in the sky. The dark clouds scattered, and the multiple withered bone claws disappeared.

The Azure Dragon coiled up in the sky. It drew the Ocean Queen and the Cold Moon Demon Lord into its coil. When the people looked up, they saw that the Azure Dragon’s body resembled a sacred dragon palace in midair. Under the sacred totem light, it appeared divine!

The Cold Moon Demon Lord and the Ocean Queen were trapped within the sacred dragon palace. They were the leaders of two greatest hordes. As a result, many kingdoms and hordes were affected. The demonic auras in the city because of the Ocean Demons and evil spirits gradually diminished.

“The divinity of the Azure Dragon!” someone shouted. The Mages along the river cheered.

No matter how dark and violent the storm was, there was always a trace of light. The sacred totem Azure Dragon’s light was the Magic City’s ray of hope to continue with their fight!

The Ocean Queen’s Undead chant was no longer audible. The Undead army lost its order and crashed onto one another. There was a pause in their attack.

“Most of the Undead don’t have their own thoughts.” Councilman Gu’s eyes lit up.

Councilman Gu was a Soul Element mage. Even though he had not reached Super-level, he had an exceptionally good understanding about the Soul Element creatures. He noticed the subtle difference in the Undead groups.

“These Undead were born not long ago. Some were forced to grow mature through certain undead demonic spells. Regardless of their levels, they don’t have minds of their own. They are like puppets. They will act only when someone pulls their strings,” Dean Xiao affirmed.

“Does this mean the Undead will scatter and lose their direction if we sever their mental connection with the Ocean Queen?” asked the chief of the Eastern Mage.

“It’s possible. The Ocean Undead live in the depth of the ocean. They can hardly survive on land and shallow sea areas. Most of the Undead army here are recent byproducts from the Pacific Ocean near China continental shelf. Most of them are still newborn. This type of Undead are simple-minded and can be manipulated with ease. This is why the Ocean Queen barged into our territory without hesitation.”

The Mages from the Forbidden Curse Association were knowledgeable. They had a wealth of experience, and they were aware of the powerful hordes’ many weaknesses.

If the mages made clever use of their weaknesses, they might be able to significantly reduce the pressure before them!

“Do we have Psychic Element or Soul Element Forbidden Mages in the country?” asked Dean Xiao.

President Hong Wu frowned. They did not have a Psychic Element or Soul Element Forbidden Mage. Those Forbidden Mages were available only in foreign countries.

‘But would they be willing to be involved in this battle?’ President Hong Wu wondered. They might not risk their lives for the sake of another country.

“President Hong Wu, Lingyin Monk is a Psychic Forbidden Mage,” said Councilman Gu. A thought sprang up in his mind as he spoke with a deep sense of urgency.

The crowd’s eyes lit up. They had unexpectedly summoned two powerful Forbidden Mages through the rally order. The old lady and the old monk were Forbidden Mages.

They came out of nowhere. It was as if they had disappeared and were long forgotten. However, this time, they came forward to help during the Magic City’s calamity!
