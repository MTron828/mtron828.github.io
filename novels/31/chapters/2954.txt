Lingling was not surprised by this. The moonless night was coming soon. It would be weird if there were still peace here.

“Someone deliberately released Ki Kurokawa to prevent everyone in the Twin Guardian Towers from entering, leaving, and communicating with the outside world,” Lingling said.

“Could it be that someone is going to implement a dreadful plan?” Officer Ozawa asked.

“What actions will the Chief of the Towers take if a prisoner escapes from the East Guardian Towers?” Lingling asked.

“Lockdown, of course. In fact, there are two prohibitions in the Twin Guardian Towers. The first is to lock down the East Guardian Towers. Outsiders can’t break in, and the prisoners inside can’t escape. The second is a safety measure. If a prisoner accidentally leaves the East Guardian Towers, the prohibition on the West Guardian Towers will also be activated. Then, the entire Twin Guardian Towers will be on lockdown to prevent prisoners from escaping into society,” Officer Ozawa said.

The system of the Twin Guardian Towers was simple.

The East Guardian Towers and the West Guardian Towers used to be prisons for a very long time. The sole entry and escape, if the inmates were held prisoner on a cliff, similar to the East Guardian Towers, would be the suspension bridge.

In this fashion, if inmates managed to scale the East Guardian Towers’ cliff and escape, they would have to cross the suspension bridge and enter the West Guardian Towers. The convicts would be unable to flee if the West Guardian Towers were placed on lockdown.

In the past, the East Guardian Towers provided some assurance.

The strictness of the East Guardian Towers, however, eventually rendered the West Guardian Towers essentially worthless. The West Guardian Towers were initially transformed into a military facility by the army. The West Guardian Towers eventually developed into a location with educational, military, and tourist services.

If Ki Kurokawa had not escaped, many people who lived in the West Guardian Towers for a long time would not even be aware of the second level of safety measures.

“The Chief of the Towers is very sure that Ki Kurokawa has not left the West Guardian Towers. Every prisoner has a prisoner’s mark after being imprisoned. This mark is related to the prohibition of the West Guardian Towers. Once he tries to leave the Twin Guardian Towers, the second-level prohibition will be automatically triggered. Ki Kurokawa knows this, so he does not dare provoke this second-level prohibition,” Officer Ozawa said.

“The manslayer fled into the West Guardian Towers and mingled among its occupants, blending into their social circle. People continue to die in strange ways, but the reasons are not clear. Since the Evil Gang has returned, everyone is wary of those around them. The Twin Guardian Towers are on lockdown and don’t have contact with the outside world creating an environment for panic,” said Lingling.

“Master Lingling, you found out about the escape of Ki Kurokawa. Now that so many days have passed, did you find anything else? If we can catch him, everyone won’t be so anxious,” Officer Ozawa said.

“Let’s handle it one at a time,” Lingling said.

“Huh? Do you already know where Ki Kurokawa is hiding?” Officer Ozawa asked.

“Well, sort of.”

…

Officer Ozawa called the higher-ups of the Twin Guardian Towers.

The Chief of the Towers, Katana Mochizuki, Tegami Fujikata, and General Takuichi were the four chiefs of the Twin Guardian Towers.

The Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo, was in charge of the defense of the East Guardian Towers. All the guards had to obey his orders, and all the prisoners were under his management.

In the Mochizuki family, Katana Mochizuki played an important role. This family built the Twin Guardian Towers. They were the earliest residents of the Twin Guardian Towers, and their family members held many positions in the entire Twin Guardian Towers.

Tegami Fujikata was in charge of the State House and the Academy. All the teachers and students were under her management.

General Takuichi was the leader of the military fortress. In addition to Ocean Demons, he dealt with other threats to the city, such as prisoners who might escape from the East Guardian Towers.

Officer Ozawa had no idea that all four chiefs would show up at once, and he had no idea why they would show up to support a Chief Military Officer like him.

Officer Ozawa entered the hallway and saw that the four chiefs had been invited to an emergency meeting by an unidentified person. A wide range of professionals were also in attendance.

“Ozawa, you told me a long time ago that you hired a Seven-Star Hunter Master to handle the strange incident in the Twin Guardian Towers. Where is the Seven-Star Hunter Master now?” the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo, asked.

“A woman named Lingling is the Seven-Star Hunter Master. She has some major discoveries and seeks to report to all of you,” Officer Ozawa said.

There were a lot of people there, and they were all staring at Lingling.

To be honest, it was hard to believe that a young girl could be a Seven-Star Hunter Master, yet no one expressed any skepticism.

“Okay. Young master, what are the reasons for all the troublesome things happening in the Twin Guardian Towers? Also, how did you find Ki Kurokawa’s name on the Sacrificial Mountain’s visitor list? Why were you at the Sacrificial Mountain?” The Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo, took charge of the overall situation.

Lingling found a place to sit down. She needed to tell them everything one by one.

“First of all, let’s talk about what happened to the Mochizuki family a while ago. According to my investigation—”

“I don’t care about that matter! I hope you could talk about Ki Kurokawa. It is the most urgent thing we need to know right now,” the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo, interrupted Lingling.

Lingling glanced at the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo. However, she ignored him and continued, “According to my investigation, the scandal of the Mochizuki family was deliberately committed by someone. Akematsu has a daughter who is studying in the academy, and she loves Kaede Takahashi. She knew that Kaede Takahashi wanted to join the National Institute’s team, so she used Psychic Element Magic to force Sinchino Mochizuki to sleepwalk and do some terrible things, forcing Sinchino Mochizuki to lose his position in the National Institute.”

Sinchino Mochizuki was also present. When he heard Lingling’s words, he trembled and stared at Kaede Takahashi in horror.

Everyone in the conference room abruptly stopped speaking.

“Erm, we actually checked it out. It’s just as Miss Lingling said,” Katana Mochizuki said slowly.

“Although the Mochizuki family did not take disciplinary action against Akematsu’s daughter, she still blamed herself and chose to end her life the day after Kaede Takahashi rejected her confession,” Lingling said.

“Kaede Takahashi sleepwalked and almost died. At that time, his junior was already dead. It won’t make sense unless we assume that the spirit of his junior controlled him,” Nagayama said hurriedly.

“You can ask Kaede Takahashi. He knew what was going on.” Lingling looked at Kaede Takahashi.

Kaede Takahashi suddenly panicked. Under everyone’s attention, he was obviously under pressure.

After hesitating for a while, Kaede Takahashi lowered his head and said, “Miss Lingling, you’re really smart. It was true that I pretended to sleepwalk. Sinchino lost the qualification of the National Institute because of me. When my junior confessed, she told me the truth. I hoped to return the quota to Sinchino, so I violated the prohibition late at night and hurt myself.”
