The surroundings were completely empty, without any traces nearby. It implied that the incident had taken place quite some time ago. The Fiery Sorceress must have lost consciousness due to the ice poison, and happened to wake up when he arrived, thus she almost vented her anger on an innocent group of people.

Mo Fan had spent almost a day in the Fire Cloud Woods. He did not expect someone would manage to steal the Fire Calamity Fruit and inflict serious damage to the Fiery Sorceress while he was gone.

The icy spike penetrated deep into her flesh. If the spike were pulled out, the Fiery Sorceress’ life might be in danger. Mo Fan was unsure how she managed to hold back the poison to protect her life.

How cruel, such a vicious move!

The person who had stolen the Fire Calamity Fruit must be rather familiar with the Fiery Sorceress, and specifically prepared the equipment to harm her!

Who would abuse the Fiery Sorceress’ kindness toward humans?

The Fiery Sorceress was kind, but she was far from stupid. The person who managed to thrust the deadly spike into her back was probably someone she was willing to let her guard down in front of.

“What should we do now?” Nanyu finally trusted Mo Fan’s words when she saw the terrifying Fiery Sorceress leaving the place.

Luckily they were not the first to arrive to steal the Fire Calamity Fruit. The Fiery Sorceress was indeed too powerful.

“What could we do? We’ll have to find the way out ourselves. Look how angry she is, I bet the creatures in the Fire Cloud Woods no longer dare to show themselves,” said Mo Fan with a wry smile.

Mo Fan was extremely worried for Xinxia and the others. He was clueless about their whereabouts. He was hoping that they would not stumble into the infuriated Fiery Sorceress...

“Mm? The Swift Star Wolf has returned to his dimension?”

Mo Fan was too busy handling the Fiery Sorceress. He did not realize that the Swift Star Wolf had returned.

It was most likely that the Swift Star Wolf had run out of energy, and was forced to return to his world. Mo Fan immediately communicated with the Swift Star Wolf and asked him about the group’s whereabouts.

The Swift Star Wolf was utterly worn out. Before he fell asleep, he told Mo Fan that the group was rushing back to Dunhuang City with another group of people.

Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh, knowing they were safe. However, Mo Fan was confused about why they were in a panic to go back to Dunhuang City. Besides, the Swift Star Wolf also mentioned something about another group of people. Who would they be?

They were in a rush to go back without waiting for him, could it be...

This goddamned Swift Star Wolf, why is he sleeping now, he still hasn’t told me if they were the ones who stole the Fire Calamity Fruit!

Inside the Drifting Sand River, Zhao Yulin’s crew was well-prepared and able to cross the Drifting Sand River safely without the help of a Psychic Magician.

“Luckily I’ve made some precautions. Otherwise, we would have troubles crossing the Drifting Sand River... the Fiery Sorceress has to cross the Drifting Sand River when she leaves the Burning Valley. The ruler of the Drifting Sand River will buy us some time, we should make use of the chance to escape,” the person wrapped in white cloth said with a hint of joy.

“Chen Yi, you’ve done well. The liquid of the Fire Calamity Fruit is able to cure your mother, and the rest of it has other uses too...” Zhao Yulin led the group with a joyful expression.

He did not expect their plan of stealing the Fire Calamity Fruit to be executed so smoothly. Was the Fiery Sorceress really intelligent? Why did he feel like she was fairly stupid to trust them so easily?

“I...” Chen Yi tried to say something, but she could not find the words.

On the other Desert Fire Horse, Lingling sat closer to the front on the saddle while Xinxia sat in the middle of it.

They had witnessed the entire sequence, and they still found it extremely unbelievable.

According to Chen Yi’s explanation, the Fiery Sorceress had saved Chen Yi’s mother before. On top of that, her mother had lived a few years with the Fiery Sorceress. Therefore, when they arrived at the Fire Cloud Woods. it was reasonable for the Fiery Sorceress to welcome them warmly.

However, they never knew the Fiery Sorceress was the Fire Calamity Fruit’s guardian, and they did not expect Chen Yi’s mother would ask Chen Yi to sneakily attack the Fiery Sorceress...

As a matter of fact, Xinxia and Lingling found it hard to agree with the ungrateful act.

However, it was possible that Chen Yi’s mother had a twisted personality because of her despair after her face was destroyed by the burns. She completely ignored the fact that the Fiery Sorceress had saved her life in order to gain a chance at a new life, and planned a trap for the Fiery Sorceress.

“Lingling, what do you think?” whispered Xinxia.

“Something feels strange, I don’t think the whole thing is simple as it seems. However, the Fiery Sorceress is trying to hunt us down. We have to leave this place first,” answered Lingling.

“Mmm,” Xinxia nodded.

The group kept fleeing. Zhao Yulin and Chen Yi’s mother, Jiang Feng let out relieved sighs when they finally crossed the Drifting Sand River. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

No one dared to oppose the Fiery Sorceress in the North Burning Valley. She was the ruler of the place, with an unmatched strength.

However, things were different after they crossed the Drifting Sand River. The Drifting Sand River had become restless for some unknown reason, thus the Fiery Sorceress would have to consider if she would stand a chance against the Drifting Sand Bone Dragon while she was severely injured!

The presence of the Fiery Sorceress was rather outstanding. Once she came close to the Drifting Sand River, she would awaken the ruler of the Drifting Sand River, the Drifting Sand Bone Dragon, which would buy the group enough time to return to Shanghai!

Upon arriving at Dunhuang, Zhao Yulin knew it was unwise to stay any longer. He immediately boarded his private jet, which he had long prepared to leave the place.

The flight path was inside the safe zone. Normally, most flight paths would avoid the demon beasts’ territories, and the flight companies would hire powerful Magicians to eliminate the potential threat along the flight paths. As such, even when the planes were crossing demon beasts’ territories, the plane was still safe as long as it maintained a certain altitude and concealed the energy of the plane’s engines.

To prevent the Fiery Sorceress from tracking their whereabouts via the scent of the Fire Calamity Fruit, Zhao Yulin and Jiang Feng purposely flew towards the south, and stopped at Xiamen for a while, before heading back to Shanghai...

Although the Fiery Sorceress was able to fly, she would have to cross lots of other demon beasts’ territories along the way. The rulers in those territories were not easy to deal with, thus it was impossible for her to make it that far.

If she decided to take the same flight path as the planes in the safe zone, the Magic Associations and the flight companies would be aware of her presence, and would send Super Magicians after her. As such, the group was considered themselves safe when they left Dunhuang.

Zhao Manyan, Lingling, Xinxia and Zhang Xiaohou initially planned to stay and wait for Mo Fan, but Zhao Yulin gave them no room for negotiation and forced them to go with him.

Zhao Yulin’s strength was fairly outstanding, so it was useless for them to try and fight back. They had no choice but to go back to Shanghai.

In simple words, since the husband and wife had infuriated the ruler of the Burning Valley, everyone in the group was forced to leave Dunhuang if they were planning to stay alive, as Dunhuang’s army was probably not strong enough to stop the Fiery Sorceress...
