Chapter 2226: Can You Please Work Harder?

Zhao Manyan was stammering like a little girl.

“How much did you bet?” Mu Bai asked in a low voice.

“Ugh, well, I’ll handle it,” Zhao Manyan asked awkwardly.

“Old Zhao, if Mo Fan finds out about it, he will definitely throw you off a building so you can keep Ritchie company!”

“I didn’t know that Nelson was so useless, despite his reputation!”

Both Chief Green and the Dean rose to their feet and clapped their hands.

The rest of the teachers immediately gave Mo Fan a round of applause too. The outcome of the duel had surprised them all!

The guest lecturers from China were so impressive, yet they had not even treated them seriously before...

“You still think Ritchie is wasting his talents by joining us?” Mo Fan taunted Nelson.

“Your Elements happen to restrain mine. Besides, do you really think you could beat me if it weren’t for the rules? Your cultivation is weaker than mine!” Nelson was unwilling to admit his defeat.

Nelson had three Elements at the Super Level. His Wind and Lightning Elements had even reached the second-tier of the Super Level. Every tier in the Super Level was a huge gap, so Nelson had assumed Mo Fan had no chance of beating him if they were fighting with Super Spells.

“It doesn’t matter, I won the duel,” Mo Fan replied cheerfully.

“Ritchie is the only talented student your team has. Make sure your students are ready to suffer in the tournament. I will ask Herr Casa to show no mercy!” Nelson said in a soft voice that only the two of them could hear.

“So you’re going to get your revenge by hurting my students?” Mo Fan asked for clarity.

“I don’t care. You’ve embarrassed me in front of everyone today. I swear I’ll cripple your students in the tournament. Make sure you have enough stretchers to carry them!” Nelson promised.

“I guess I couldn’t stop you, but make sure you have a stretcher for yourself too. I only taught you a lesson for hurting one of my students, but if you dare hurt all my students, I won’t let you off the hook so easily like today!” Mo Fan was not afraid of Nelson’s threats.

“HAHAHA, are you sure you can make me pay?” Nelson laughed, yet he almost vomited blood because of the pain from his ribs as he was laughing.

Mo Fan was too lazy to answer Nelson’s question. The injuries Nelson had sustained were already answering his question, yet the man still did not realize it! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Fan felt extremely pleased with himself as he left under the admiring gaze of the students.

Keeping a low profile was definitely not his style. So many arrogant people were waiting for him to step on their faces. He had a hard time turning their offers down!

“Lecturer Mo Yifan, is your team full? I’m interested in joining your team. I’m a high achiever in the school. I’ve won thirteen duels in a row in the past. Can you please accept me?”

“Lecturer, when is your next class?”

“Remember to set the price higher. I’m not short on gold, but if the class is too cheap, everyone can register for it. Only brilliant students like me are fit to be in your class,” one of the students called out.

Mo Fan was left speechless. He had only won a duel. How realistic were these students? They were already asking about his classes, while Nelson’s public class had not yet ended. How ashamed would Nelson be?

“Pay attention to the class. Lecturer Nelson is a good teacher, too. I’m just a teacher of magic theory,” Mo Fan called back.

Mo Fan was talking very loudly. Nelson almost vomited blood when he heard the words.

That son of a b**ch kept emphasizing he was only a teacher of magic theory after winning the duel!

Brianca’s eyes were fixed on Mo Fan as he passed her by.

Mo Fan fondled his chin. He looked a little vulgar.

“Miss Brianca, don’t tell me you have fallen in love with me?” Mo Fan asked with a smile.

“The Chaos Element and Earth Element aren’t your strongest Elements. I’m surprised by how much stronger you’ve become,” Brianca complimented him softly.

“I’m still no match for you!” Mo Fan might have sounded humble, but he was obviously pleased with himself. The only thing he lacked was a banner with I’m the best! on his back!

Brianca was amused by Mo Fan’s reaction, but did not speak to him any further, or people might realize they knew one another.

Mo Fan remained the focus wherever he went. The students would greet him when they saw him on the campus, even though most had ignored him in the previous weeks... except for Sharjah, who was utterly respectful to him. Even those who had attended his classes were only there for padding the numbers!

“Lecturer, I’m begging you to give me a high distinction. I watched the duel between you and Lecturer Nelson. You were so cool...” The woman who had bullied Lily, Bulma, purposely came to Mo Fan’s office.

Mo Fan was preparing for his next class in the office. He was going to visit Lily in the afternoon.

Apas’ ability to help someone recall their past through a dream put the person under a lot of stress. They had to wait for a good half a month for Lily to recover before they could learn more clues from her. If not, Lily might suffer from schizophrenia from the stress of Apas’ Psychic Magic.

Mo Fan was just on his way when Bulma, who had slapped Lily heavily in the face, came. She was wearing her usual makeup, and her heels were setting off her alluring figure.

“You’re asking for a high distinction when your results aren’t even that good? I’m busy. Get out of my way,” Mo Fan said impatiently.

“Lecturer, I can do anything you want if you’re willing to give me a high distinction,” Bulma lowered her voice. She was giving Mo Fan a strong hint.

Mo Fan observed Bulma carefully. “Whatever I want?” he asked.

“Mm,” Bulma lowered her head.

Bulma’s heart was pounding heavily. She had never done anything like this, but when she recalled how cool Mo Fan was in the duel, she was willing to give it a try.

“Then can you please work harder?”

Mo Fan left the office after saying those words, leaving Bulma alone in the cold wind.

What is wrong with the students nowadays? Do they assume every teacher is a dressed-up animal? Mo Fan sincerely wanted to be an honorable teacher after coming to the Aorus Sacred Institute. He had never studied for his classes when he was a student, yet he was actually working diligently to prepare for his classes now!
