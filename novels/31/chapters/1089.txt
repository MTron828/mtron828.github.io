“Wolf, go help Mu Ningxue!” After Mo Fan learned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was only able to utilize the Ice Soul in the presence of ice, he decisively sent the creature to help Mu Ningxue out.

The strength of the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was quite obvious. Since he was a lot stronger in Mu Ningxue’s Nirvana Ice Domain, if he helped Mu Ningxue defeat the enemies bothering her, it would help him to lift the pressure on his shoulders, too!

After sending the Flying Creek Snow Wolf away, Mo Fan glanced at Teenage Flame Belle not far from him.

Little Flame Belle was occupied with the fight against Meos. Mo Fan had to admit that Meos had grown a lot stronger after their last encounter. Not only was Little Flame Belle unable to get the upper hand when fighting Meos alone, Meos was slowly securing an advantageous position instead. Mo Fan believed it was no longer necessary to let Little Flame Belle fight on her own!

“Possess!” Mo Fan ordered Little Flame Belle.

Teenage Flame Belle rode a tide of flames and rammed into Mo Fan’s chest like a sparrow returning to its nest. Mo Fan was immediately engulfed in flames, an overwhelming aura arising from the combination of the Rose Flame and the Calamity Fire!

The flames were burning like a carpet across the ground, and the stormy clouds of the Lightning Tyrant were hovering above the place. As the energy of the two most destructive Elements combined together, the pressure was so overwhelming that the people that were flanking Mo Fan subconsciously took a few steps back!

“I’ll start with you first, since I find your undead very annoying!” Mo Fan fixed his eyes on Shreev. He sprang forward in a threatening manner, as if he was loaded with kilograms of gunpowder!

Shreev’s strongest Element was obviously the Undead Element. He was able to Summon different kinds of undead, including the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummies with outstanding defense, the deadly Death Saber Mummies, or the Underground Mummies that liked to hide under the surface and immobilize their target by grabbing their feet. The undead had proven to be quite a nuisance to Mo Fan. Most of the lightning spells he cast were not directed at the Mages, but the undead that posed a greater threat to him.

“You’re done for!” Mo Fan’s fists were filled with energy about to erupt like volcanoes. He calmly chased after Shreev when he saw the man running away.

Mo Fan landed and slammed his fists on the ground. Fiery dragons rose in the pattern of the Nine Halls, covering an area of a few hundred meters. The stunning fiery pillars almost reached the clouds, the sight of the flames was absolutely shocking!

Shreev was fleeing for his life, yet he did not anticipate the huge coverage area of Mo Fan’s Nine Halls Fiery Fist. He felt like he had fallen into Purgatory, suffering tremendous pain from the burns.

“And you, don’t you dare try to save him!” Mo Fan glanced at the Mage with the Psychic Element coldly!

Luckily, the Psychic Element was not the Mage’s Primary Element. Otherwise, Mo Fan clearly had no chance of winning the fight. That being said, the Mage had also been very annoying in the battle...

Mo Fan was known as the magic cannon since he was able to cast destructive spells continuously, without repeating the same spells. His firepower was equivalent to a small troop of Battlemages, but he was struggling to hold his ground, and his body was covered in wounds and bruises, mainly because of how disturbing the Psychic Mage had been.

Luckily, Ayleen was able to construct a Spirit Wall to protect Mo Fan, or cast a Spirit Focus on him at times. On top of that, his cultivation was also relatively stronger than the opponents. Otherwise, he would never have had the chance to fight back.

The truth was, Mo Fan’s weakness was facing a Psychic Mage. If he fought against a strong Psychic Mage, all his destructive spells were completely useless!

Luckily, Ayleen seemed to have taken care of the two opponents she was up against, and was finally able to protect Mo Fan from Psychic Spells. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Without that disturbance, Mo Fan was able to let Little Flame Belle Possess him. With Little Flame Belle’s power, and his Lightning Tyrant Domain, what difference would the enemy’s numbers make?

“Psychic Spike!” the Psychic Mage totally panicked when he saw Mo Fan approaching fiercely.

The effects of the Lightning Tyrant Domain were obvious. Under the pressure of the lightning and Mo Fan’s overwhelming strength, the Psychic Mage started to lose confidence. As a result, the Psychic Spike only inflicted temporary pain on Mo Fan, it did not prevent Mo Fan from casting his spells!

“Into the ground, you go!” Mo Fan was totally reckless. He had just knocked Shreev into the air, and before the man had fallen from the sky, Mo Fan had already diverted his attention to the Psychic Mage.

The Psychic Mage broke out in cold sweat. He had never seen a Mage like Mo Fan before, who was such an absolute monster. He was just a Mage like everyone else; why was he able to fight at a close distance?

“Sky Lightning Claw!” Mo Fan unleashed the power of the Lightning Tyrant and grabbed at the Psychic Mage.The Lightning Tyrant immediately summoned a black lightning claw, tearing through the pitiful defense of the Psychic Mage.

“Tyrant Call!” The Lightning Tyrant Scars gathered and formed thick bolts of judgment, striking down at the Psychic Mage.

The yellow arcs penetrated the ground deeply, slamming the Psychic Mage into a huge pit. Mo Fan meant it when he said that he was going to knock the guy into the ground!

In terms of strength, Jack was the only worthy opponent on the enemy team. After taking Jack out, and receiving the protection from the Psychic Spells, it was Mo Fan’s time to launch his fierce counterattack!

The combined Rose Flame and the Calamity Fire, and the Lightning Tyrant, were a lot more powerful than ordinary Soul-grade Seeds. In the World College Tournament, having a Soul-grade Seed alone was quite impressive. Meanwhile, Shreev and the Psychic Mage were obviously not so talented. Once Mo Fan was able to establish his Domain, the gap between their strengths was simply too huge, and Mo Fan soon took care of them...

“Damn it!” Meos was grim when she saw Mo Fan taking out three of her teammates.

Only Jack and his Summoned Beast were able to stand a chance against Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant. Once Jack was defeated, the others were like lambs waiting to be slaughtered by Mo Fan...

“Me...Meos, shouldn’t we think twice before provoking this guy?” the Mage that fought the Flying Creek Snow Wolf before asked softly.

The man was so relieved that he did not enter Mu Ningxue’s Domain when he was fighting against the creature. Otherwise, he was sure he would have died several times over when he looked at what happened to Jack and his Summoned Beast.

“We have a great advantage in numbers, yet we still couldn’t defeat the three of them...” Meos looked like she was having a hard time accepting the truth.

However, Meos no longer had the same pride she possessed at the start of the fight. As she had mentioned, their group of a dozen people had lost to the trio. It basically meant the three of them were able to take on an entire national team! There was no way Meos could feel proud of herself after considering the difference in their strengths!

Meos felt lost at the strong sense of failure, not knowing if she should continue fighting or just give up and crush her scroll to leave the match. She could not even imagine what the Egyptians were going to think of her!

“You won... you can deal with us however you want!” Meos lowered her head and said, facing the unstoppable Mo Fan.

Meos was clearly aware that even if they had double or triple the number of people in their group, they would still struggle to defeat Mo Fan, a man with outstanding Lightning and Fire Elements, and a strong Domain!

“Deal with you?” Mo Fan glanced around him. He looked at Angelo that was in bad shape; Jack, who was feeling extremely down after losing; Shreev who was hiding like a coward; and the scorched black Psychic Mage crawling out of the pit, “I’m already done, the rest of you should just leave while you still can!”

Meos felt even more humiliated when she heard his words. She snapped, “So we aren’t even worthy for you to get your revenge?”

“Meos, please don’t judge everyone the same way you’re judging yourself. Let’s be real; if they don’t try to take revenge, I can still preserve my strength to secure more resources from the other groups. There are too many resources that I need in this treasure hunt, yet they have to force me to knock them out of the match!” Mo Fan said.

“Haven’t you stolen enough?” Meos was infuriated.

Leaving the loot that Mo Fan had robbed aside, the Soul-grade Seed that he had taken from her was quite valuable! They were trying to lure Mo Fan just so he would right into the trap, but to their surprise, the little trap they set up was nowhere enough to contain the beast. In the end, they were the ones that had suffered a tremendous loss!

“I don’t believe that such a grand tournament only has so few resources. Besides, there’s no such a thing as having enough resources for me... I won’t be wasting my time further. You all should just crush the teleportation scroll and leave. I’m too lazy to waste any more of my energy on you... and you, the guy that keeps Summoning the undead, can you please bring that Italian with you!? I’m afraid that I’m going to change my mind again after seeing his disgusting face, and blast him with more lightning!” Mo Fan pointed at Shreev.

Shreev was suffering from his burns. He no longer had any intention to stay in the match, even though he still had the fighting capacity to do so. Mo Fan was simply a demon, one that they could not afford to provoke!

“Asshole, why did you stop attacking!?” Hannah of the Canadian team screamed.

Pinole was standing still with a Water Spell in his hand, yet he did not dare to toss the spell at his target, as a pair of sharp claws were hanging less than half a meter away, with the icy eyes of a demon wolf glaring at him!

Pinole wanted to fight, too. He was supposed to be the ace of the Spanish team, yet when they finally were about to beat Mu Ningxue, a terrifying Flying Creek Snow Wolf appeared out of nowhere. Pinole suffered greatly facing the Flying Creek Snow Wolf, as his ability to fight at a close distance was too weak to handle the creature. He was slapped around like a ball, and his Water Element defense was struggling to keep up!
