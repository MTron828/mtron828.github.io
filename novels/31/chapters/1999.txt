“Mo Fan, are you seriously juggling them now?” Zhao Manyan asked when he saw Mo Fan using Space and Chaos Magic in such a fancy way.

“It’s me being wise and farsighted. It’s a form of art, or should I wrap myself in armor and charge at them like a retard, like you?” Mo Fan shot back.

Magic of different Elements was interweaving on Mo Fan’s palms. The Basic and Intermediate Spells he had strengthened multiple times were surprisingly effective in this chaotic battle.

However, the beasts of the horde were not gentle animals. Even as many demon creatures were fleeing from the Valley of Glaciers, more demon creatures had shown up in front of Mo Fan. His weaker spells were no longer enough to resolve the situation.

“Make way, I’m going to use a Beast Tide!” Lu Xiu yelled.

Lu Xiu opened a Summoning Gate. A bunch of wild boars with thick fur and long tusks charged out of the gate while uttering loud cries.

They were around forty to fifty boars, each around the size of a jeep. The ice began to crack as the boars stomped on it.

However, the Steel Spike Bulls and Tianshan Howling Bears did not treat the boars seriously, and continued to charge ahead. The stampeding creatures soon trampled the boars and knocked them flying. The boars were not on the same level as the demon creatures!

“Damn it, their numbers are too much for us!” Lu Xiu cursed.

“Back away, let me handle it,” Mo Fan told Lu Xiu.

“You?” Lu Xiu twisted his lips disdainfully. “Do you think your Beast Tide is stronger than mine? You should just focus on using your Lightning Element. It’s your only chance!”

“Can you move aside now?” Mo Fan replied evenly.

Lu Xiu glared at Mo Fan, then noticed Mo Fan was emitting a lunar-white light. The Star Patterns combined into a spectacular Gate on the ice, opening in the direction of the beast horde.

Roars burst out of the Gate, carried on a formidable Aura, and were followed by massive figures rushing out of it from a different world.

The creatures were as restless as bulls provoked by a red cape. Rock Beasts covered in dark golden armor extended their limbs and charged at the beast hordes fearlessly!

The endless streams of Rock Beasts pouring out of the Gate were like dragons with spikes on their back. Their heads were as deadly as the lances of knights as they charged at the enemy. The group of Rock Beasts pouring out of the Gate was just as menacing as the beast hordes that were charging down the mountain!

Bang!

Bang!

The Rock Beasts had an ultimate showdown of brute strength with the Steel Spike Bulls and Tianshan Howling Bears. Their armor, blood, and flesh scattered in the air amid the simplest and purest form of strength. The ones with sturdier flesh were the winners, there were no techniques or skills involved. The creatures with the slightest drop in confidence were crushed to pieces in the collision.

The stampede of the Dark Golden Rock Beasts!

Mo Fan’s Beast Tide was not limited to Summoning his demon wolves. He kept Summoning the demon wolves mainly because their overall strength and discipline were better than other species that were randomly Summoned from the Summoned Beast Plane.

Each activation of the Summoning Gate was able to Summon a different species. Mo Fan knew his demon wolves would suffer great losses in a battle like this. They could also end up as the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ food supply, so it was better to Summon the Dark Golden Rock Beasts!

The Rock Beasts used a simple yet violent approach. The beast hordes were confused when they saw the Rock Beasts. Were they out of their mind? They were clearly charging in the wrong direction!

They had to keep an eye on the Frosty Ancient Eagles that could pluck them off the ground even if they were running at full speed. The beast hordes crashed horribly when obstacles suddenly appeared in their path. Huge creatures were rolling and flipping across the surface of the frozen lake!

“Mo Fan, your Beast Tide is pretty impressive. Those creatures are avoiding us!” Jiang Yu exclaimed, his eyes glittering.

Jiang Yu was also a Summoner. He knew a Beast Tide was a clear indicator of a Summoner’s strength. The Beast Tide of a strong Summoner was like hundreds of beasts charging down a mountain, or dragons crossing a lake. On the other hand, the Beast Tide of those who did not put much attention into their Summoning Element would feel like a bunch of ducks crossing a river!

Lu Xiu’s boars were obviously the latter. It was important to compare spells in a practical setting. If they did not have to fight the powerful creatures of Tianshan Mountain, would they even realize how petty their magic was?

“He’s just relying on his magic Equipment to increase the scale of his Beast Tide. It’s not that impressive!” Lu Xiu’s Beast Tide was obviously inferior in comparison. However, he blamed it all on Mo Fan’s Ring.

Lu Xiu was sharp enough to notice that the Magic Medium Ring was the main reason why Mo Fan was able to Summon so many creatures. However, the Magic Medium Ring was only so effective because Mo Fan had been feeding Soul Essences to it!

However, Mo Fan considered it meaningless to be fussy about someone who was never going to admit defeat. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mo Fan’s Beast Tide had eased the pressure on the Mailong Private Military Group, which meant the other groups were intercepted by the beast hordes. They were trapped in the middle of the lake while the Frosty Ancient Eagles circling in the sky continued to pick them off one by one.

A huge group of Frosty Ancient Eagles suddenly appeared above the Mailong Private Military Group, their wings beating wildly at different altitudes. Some were so quick that the people could only see their afterimages. The cunning Frosty Ancient Eagles would mix up their attacks by probing their enemies. A pair of sharp talons would stab through their ribs from behind once they lowered their guard!

“What’s going on? Why are the creatures focusing on us all of a sudden?” Zhao Manyan was under great pressure. The Frosty Ancient Eagles had broken through a few of his Barriers.

Jiang Shaoxu frowned. She fixed her eyes on a woman in thick makeup and a black and red outfit in the Inverse Hawk Hunter Group. She snarled, “That b**ch, she’s using the Psychic Element to direct the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ anger toward us, to ease the burden on her group!”
