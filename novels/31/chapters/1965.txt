“Are you going to blame me for distracting you if you are having trouble pooping too?” Mo Fan asked the Judicator sincerely.

“Watch your tongue!” the Judicator snapped.

“Why don’t you mind your own tongue first? Let’s put aside the question of why I still have a Marking left by the Heresy Judgment Court for now. Even if I do have a Mark, have I done anything that breaks the rules of the Heresy Judgment Court!?” Mo Fan demanded in return.

“Having a Marking makes you suspicious, so it’s necessary to question you! Who exactly are you? Reveal your identity at once, and stop wasting my time!” the Judicator demanded sternly.

“Oh? That’s the last thing I’m going to do!” Mo Fan declared stubbornly.

The Judicator’s face immediately darkened.

Seeing this, Muse Pelina came over. She explained when she saw the tension between the two, “Judicator, this is Mo Fan, a family member of one of our Candidates.”

“You’re Mo Fan?” The Judicator had a weird expression, like a doubtful bailiff who had stumbled into a repented criminal.

The Judicator did not interrogate Mo Fan any further after learning his identity.

It was obvious that the Judicator was after the real heretic. If the Judicator had been polite, Mo Fan might have considered pointing him in the right direction. He believed they were after the man in the monk’s robe. However, after witnessing their attitude, Mo Fan was suddenly unsure of which side was the real heretic now.

After Judicator Maule left, Muse Pelina inspected Mo Fan with glittering eyes.

“Judicator Maule mentioned there was someone who was blatantly walking around and another who was hiding in the dark. It turns out that you were the one blatantly walking around. You are truly a problematic guy,” Pelina said in an unfriendly tone.

“Is the wind stronger for those in a higher position? Why do I feel like none of you up there has a sound mind?” Mo Fan responded promptly.

Pelina ignored Mo Fan’s sneer.

Priest Dowell was worried the conflict would escalate further at this rate. He quickly switched the topic, “Muse Pelina, did something serious happen? Why is a Judicator of the Heresy Judgment Court here? Mo Fan has been with us all the time. I don’t think he has done anything that has crossed the line?”

Pelina slowly shifted her gaze away from Mo Fan. If the Heresy Judgment Court was keeping an eye on Mo Fan, she believed it was no longer necessary to keep everything a secret, and stopped avoiding the topic. She explained, “Do you know how the Heresy Judgment Court judges whether a person is a heretic?”

“I’m not familiar with the process. Please enlighten me,” Priest Dowell said respectfully.

“The power that humans use is referred to as magic. Since the beginning of the Magic Civilization a few thousand years ago, we have developed our own system, consisting of the White Magic, Dimensional Magic, Elemental Magic, Dark Magic...” Pelina went on.

These were common schools of magic. Every person who studied for nine years in magic schools would know that.

“We are aware of that,” Priest Dowell nodded.

“I suppose you also know there is power beyond the scope of the Magic Compendium after you reach the Super Level. They are usually described as the Forbidden Arts,” Pelina said.

“I have heard a little about that,” Dowell said cautiously.

“The category of the Forbidden Arts has the highest classification. The Magic Associations and various organizations are experimenting with Forbidden Spells to make them a new magic tier in the Magic Compendium, or a new Element in simpler words. There’s also another category in the Forbidden Arts, called the Evil Arts. The Heresy Judgment Court goes after every Mage who practices the Evil Arts,” Pelina informed them.

Mo Fan understood Pelina’s explanation. The Heresy Judgment Court had been after him because of the Demon Element. Luckily, Old Bao and some mysterious people on his side had fended off the pressure. Otherwise, it would not have been as simple as tagging him as a suspicious person.

There were Mages who were maintaining peace in this world. Mo Fan was obviously at the edge of destroying the world’s peace!

“There’s another category above the Evil Arts, called the Disastrous Arts. The Magic Association and Holy Judgment Court usually handle people who practice the Evil Arts, but the Heresy Judgment Court will arrest and purge those who practice the Disastrous Arts. Not only are the Disastrous Arts not included in the Magic Compendium, those arts are so powerful that they might threaten the peace of society and result in great casualties. People who practice the Disastrous Arts are like devils blending into the crowd. We can’t predict when they will reveal their true form. It might be in the wild or the middle of a crowd... if it’s the latter, it will definitely be a bloodbath,” Pelina continued.

Disastrous Arts!

They had never heard of them before. Even Priest Dowell only knew about the Evil Arts.

“I’ve come to the Sacred Palace to help the Heresy Judgment Court and the Sacred Palace Mages purge a heretic. The Disastrous Art in the heretic’s body is already out of control. A village in the Tibetan Plateau already fell victim to it; the whole village was wiped out. The heretic tried to take his revenge on a branch of the Asia Magic Association, but the Sacred Palace Mages stopped him in time. He is now taking his anger out on the Sacred Palace and has been active around here lately,” Pelina finished.

“Taking revenge on a branch of the Asia Magic Association and threatening the Sacred Palace... That heretic is out of his mind!” Dowell exclaimed.

“Otherwise, why would they be treated as heretics?” Pelina purposely glanced at Mo Fan as she was talking. It made Mo Fan extremely uncomfortable.

“What about Mister Mo Fan?” Dowell could not help but worry.

“He only has a Mark that makes him a suspect, but Judicator Maule ended up wasting his time on him because of the Mark. It prevented the Judicator from locating the heretic. There are so many people in this city, so finding him is going to be difficult,” Pelina explained.

“No wonder Judicator Maule was picking on Mo Fan, but it’s not entirely his fault,” Dowell murmured.

Mo Fan’s lips twisted. It seemed like he had gone too easy on the Holy Judgment Court and the Heresy Judgment Court. He would not bother handing them half a member of the Black Vatican again even if they were kneeling before him!

They had taken all the credit for his achievements to help stabilize their authority and earning the compliments of every magic organization. Meanwhile, Mo Fan remained a potential heretic. What in the world!?
