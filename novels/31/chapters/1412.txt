Ganyu Mountain was located in the Huangshi Mountain Range.

The sentry tower for Feihuang City was on top of Ganyu Mountain. It had been around for a long time, keeping an eye on the Beijiang Desolate Beasts.

Bin Wei, the Prophet, Zhao Manyan, Zhang Xiaohou, Lingling, Ye Hong, and the defenders of the Great Wall had all gathered here. The three commanders in charge of Feihuang City were watching from the tower, too.

The three commanders panicked when they saw the army of the Underworld rolling toward them like a dark cloud from the mountains in the distance. There was no way a city could possibly withstand an army of the scale of the Underworld’s.

However, an unbelievable scene soon took place. They saw an army of skeletons and zombies appear out of nowhere and charge at the Underworld creatures ferociously. They gaped as they watched the undead of the Ancient Capital driving the Underworld army back!

“Can anyone tell me what’s going on here?” General Zhou Li of Feihuang City asked in disbelief.

The undead of the Ancient Capital had appeared like heavenly soldiers and driven the Underworld army back. They were utterly confused about why the undead of the Ancient Capital had suddenly sided with the living. Didn’t they almost destroy the Ancient Capital not long ago!?

Zhang Xiaohou was trembling in excitement. He did not expect the Chief Military Instructor to listen to him!

Mo Fan was going to live! Feihuang City and the North Valley were going to survive!

“Is this the only power that can match the Great Pyramid of Giza that you mentioned before?” Zhao Manyan stared at Zhang Xiaohou with a blank face.

Zhao Manyan would never have believed it if he did not witness it in person. The reinforcements that Zhang Xiaohou requested were the Ancient King and his massive Kingdom of Undead, who had almost overrun the Ancient Capital!

The Kingdom of Undead was the death-sworn army of ancient China. The invasion of Egypt’s undead had clearly infuriated them. The battle between the two armies of undead was nothing like the living could imagine. Somehow, all the epic battles that had once taken place in North Valley were like children playing compared to the clash between the two undead kingdoms!

A real battle against a kingdom of demon creatures would not have the scale of the battle they were currently witnessing, covering several hundred kilometers, a mountain range, extending beyond four valleys and three cities... words could no longer describe how epic it was. Even when they were observing the battle from a great height, the intense battle covering the whole valley before them was in fact just the tip of an iceberg!

“Does this mean that Zhan Kong is still alive?” the Prophet blurted out after a long time.

It was difficult to tell the truth.

Perhaps the King of Undead was infuriated when the Great Pyramid of Giza invaded his territory. The Great Pyramid of Giza had made a serious mistake, choosing China as its first target!

“Either way, we are done with the evacuation,” General Bin Wei was not observing the battle. She was looking at the last group of civilians being escorted into the city.

These people were from Lucheng, the furthest city from Feihuang City. When the people saw the gates of Feihuang City were still open for them even after such a long time, they burst into tears of joy and relief.

They were aware of the trouble they had given the army for taking so long to be evacuated to Feihuang City. They almost gave up halfway, but they still made it to Feihuang City. They immediately thanked the soldiers guarding the city. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The soldiers immediately felt awkward. They had yet to do anything. They were just holding their positions. They knew that the evacuees should be thanking the people who had fought to their deaths at Northguard Fortress and the Great Wall to hold the Underworld army back. They were the real heroes in the battle, but not all of them had returned in one piece!

“Is everyone evacuated to the city?” General Zhou Li asked.

“Mm, we’ve asked the Hunter Union to take care of the people of the remote villages. They have also forcibly evacuated the old folks who are unwilling to leave their villages. We have yet to hear of any civilians being attacked by the Underworld creatures,” General Bin Wei said confidently.

“I don’t believe it...” General Zhou Li murmured.

“Yeah, I’m still having a hard time believing that the Great Pyramid of Giza has shown up in our land with such a massive army of undead,” Ye Hong said.

“No no, I was referring to you people.” General Zhou Li stared at the terrifying Underworld creatures in the distance and added, “It was supposed to turn into an unforgettable tragedy after seeing how massive the army of undead is. Countless people were going to die, leaving the whole country in sorrow and grief, but a small army in Northguard Fortress, a few groups of people from the Preventive Committee and the Enforcement Union managed to buy us two whole days to evacuate seven cities, more than forty towns, and a few hundred villages in the North Valley without suffering any casualties. I was amazed by your achievements, it’s just unbelievable! I thank you on behalf of the people of the North Valley!”

General Zhou Li knew how much of a disaster it was when a horde of demon creatures invaded the North Valley, let alone a massive undead army brought by the Great Pyramid of Giza. On top of that, the scum of the Black Vatican were pulling the strings behind! It felt impossible to put a stop to the tragedy, and yet they had done it!

The hearts of the defenders were pounding heavily after hearing his words. Even they were struggling to believe that they had actually stopped the invading Great Pyramid of Giza’s army!

“The person we should be thanking is Mo Fan. He had the strongest resolve among us, right from the beginning when he found out the Black Vatican was up to something. He even infiltrated the Black Vatican alone after alerting us about their conspiracy. He helped us retreat from Northguard Fortress and stayed back to hold the army of undead back alone until the undead of the Ancient Capital showed up...” the Prophet replied, staring at the battle in the distance.

For some reason, the Prophet could sense that Mo Fan was still fighting. The inextinguishable flame was still burning in a corner of the battlefield. It was his flames that kept them going, not giving up on defending their land.

He was only a petty young man desperately trying to survive during the Calamity of Bo City. He had no choice but to step forward during the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, but now, he was standing firmly in the front line; he had inherited the true spirit of the Great Wall. He would not yield, fall, or be extinguished. The Prophet had watched Mo Fan grow. He had witnessed the birth of a reliable soon-to-be Supreme Mage. Most importantly, he was still so young. He had unlimited potential!

The debris of the Great Wall at Squaretrek Plain...

“I’ll take care of the dead, but you’ll have to deal with the living yourself,” the King of Undead said before Mo Fan could speak, as if he could read Mo Fan’s mind.

“Sure!” Mo Fan nodded.

The effects of the Demon Element were slowly wearing off, but luckily, Mo Fan was still able to control it. Even though the power of the Demon Element had weakened significantly, Mo Fan was still a capable fighter, and his energy was preserved. The Cold Prince could no longer transform into the Demon-Horned God, and the Cold Prince might even be in a worse condition than him!

Mo Fan moved along the fallen wall. He did not have a problem tracking down the Cold Prince among the army of undead using the Fiendish Night!

Mo Fan soon found the blood-covered culprit on an Underworld Monarch Frog; the Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican, the Cold Prince!

Mo Fan had changed his mind. He had decided to capture the Cold Prince alive!

It would be a waste to kill the Cold Prince; dead men told no tales!

Capturing the Cold Prince alive would be a serious blow to the Black Vatican. The world would be able to see the true nature of the Red Cardinal, and how filthy his heart was. They would witness the Red Cardinal being sentenced to death and executed amid loud cheers!
