“You know who’s behind it?” Mo Fan eyed Mu Xumian curiously.

“Let’s discuss it somewhere else,” Mu Xumian said.

“Sure, pick a place,” Mo Fan nodded.

Mu Xumian was not much bothered by the scene Mo Fan had caused, and left the mountain with Mo Fan. It stunned everyone from the Dali Clan.

What was going on? Mu Xumian was from the Mu Clan, so she was the biggest person the Dali Clan was relying on. How could they possibly forget this humiliation so easily?

“Master, it’s fine for us to pick on the people of Fanxue Mountain, but we really shouldn’t mess with that Mo Fan. Didn’t you hear? A Councilman was killed because of him!” Li Dong advised his master carefully.

The others from Fanxue Mountain might focus on the general situation and behave more like a renowned clan should. They would not go all out with anyone very easily, and would only pull the strings behind the scenes when competing for resources. They would not settle the dispute with mere violence.

But Mo Fan?

He might be from Fanxue Mountain, but he was utterly reckless! He had to make both sides suffer instead!

They should avoid messing with people like him, since they would normally suffer greater losses as a result.

“How did he even cultivate? I thought Mu Ningxue was the strongest person from Fanxue Mountain!” Li Kuang snarled angrily.

Their youth gave them unlimited possibilities, unlike an old man like him. He could no longer improve any further, even with the best resources and environment to cultivate in.

If the Mu Clan did not send some real experts over soon, the Dali Clan would no longer be able to keep Fanxue Mountain at bay!

However, Li Kuang had a feeling that was not going to happen, judging from Mu Xumian’s reaction just now.

Forget it, the dispute between them and Fanxue Mountain was mainly because of the Mu Clan. The Dali Clan was only the Mu Clan’s lackey. If the Mu Clan was not fussed over it, why should he care so much?

The two went down the mountain. The Dali Clan’s mansion was not too far from Feiniao Headquarters City. The center of Feiniao City had already been relocated inland. It now had a lot of new buildings and streets, and felt like a second Magic City.

They walked along the main road toward the harbor. Mu Xumian was acting like a different person. She was actually more pleasing to the eye when she was not acting coquettishly.

“How did you know Mu Bai was being targeted?” Mo Fan asked with a puzzled look.

“Didn’t anyone tell you I was placed under an Undead Spell?” Mu Xumian answered.

“I did hear about it...” Mo Fan confirmed.

“Humph, I was unlucky that I happened to stumble into it... but the guy is unlucky too, to stumble into me!” Mu Xumian snarled.

“I don’t understand,” Mo Fan said.

“I have to say that you were pretty lucky when we met in the little town in the other dimension. My Queen Bee of Revenge was hibernating back then. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have stood a chance at all!” Mu Xumian declared.

“Can’t we talk about Mu Bai first?” Mo Fan said.

“I almost died to that Undead Spell! I only recovered recently. My other Element is the Poison Element. There’s a Queen Bee living inside me after merging with my soul. It won’t fight for me, but it will avenge me if I die by killing the person who killed me, unless the person is a lot stronger than me. If they aren’t, my Queen Bee of Revenge will kill that person before it perishes!” Mu Xumian said.

“But aren’t you alive now?” Mo Fan said.

“I am, but he must pay the price after trying to kill me!” Mu Xumian stated emphatically.

“Oh? You mean your Queen Bee of Revenge already has its eyes on the guy who is targeting Mu Bai?” Mo Fan said.

Previously, after Mu Xumian had almost died, they had already suspected the culprit was after Mu Bai. Mu Xumian only got herself in trouble by staying at Mu Bai’s place for a few days. She must have been placed under the spell during that time through things like the food, the presence of magic, and other stuff in the house.

“Yeah, I’ve now recovered. Once I Summon the Queen Bee of Revenge, I’ll be able to find the person who tried to kill Mu Bai,” Mu Xumian declared.

“But he went missing in Xiamen...” Mo Fan said.

“It must have something to do with the guy who tried to kill him. Judging from the spell I was placed under, it’s obvious that the person wants Mu Bai dead at all costs. I overheard the conversation between you and the Dali Clan. Do you think the Viscera Hunters or Li Kai could possibly hurt Mu Bai now that he’s a Super Mage? Who could make him vanish without a trace, other than the person that tried to set him up last time?” Mu Xumian said.

Mo Fan nodded. He totally agreed with Mu Xumian’s assessment.

Lingling had arrived at the same conclusion. Mo Fan had only been confused about one thing. If their enemy was coming after himself, why did they not set him up in Xiamen during the battle against the sea monsters? Why did they pick on Mu Bai instead?

Therefore, Mo Fan also believed the person was after Mu Bai after hearing Mu Xumian’s explanation.

“The culprit is very strong. You better bring one or two capable Mages with you. He should still be in the country. My Queen Bee of Revenge will track him down. Let’s hope Mu Bai is still alive,” Mu Xumian said.

“Got it!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Don’t find someone who’s too far away. We are running short on time. My Queen Bee is telling me that the culprit is already on the move,” Mu Xumian said.

“I’ll ask Mu Ningxue to go with me.”

“That won’t be enough, the three of us will still struggle against the culprit,” Mu Xumian said.

“You’re going too?” Mo Fan was surprised.

“Humph, even though I almost died because of Mu Bai, he did save my life! I don’t like owing anyone!” Mu Xumian sniffed.

—

Mo Fan did not think Mu Xumian was lying to him. From her description, the culprit was unusually strong.

Mo Fan could only bring Zhao Manyan or Liu Ru with him. The others might die instantly when fighting the culprit.

Unfortunately, they were currently in the season when the days were longer, so it was not a suitable time for Bola to go with him. He had been forced to rest for a long time after he went to Dawn Island before. It would have been a lot safer if the elder vampire was around.

Mo Fan could only ask Zhao Manyan and Mu Ningxue for help. They were both Super Mages.

Mu Xumian was tagging along too, meaning they had four Super Mages, including himself. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was time for them to face the person who was hiding in the dark!
