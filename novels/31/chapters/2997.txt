2998 The Person In Charge of Zhao Group

“You’re still a novice. We can guide you closely for the sake of Mr. Zhao. Regarding the contract between our royal family and Zhao Group that disallowed the merchants from selling silver jewelry in the Indian Ocean, could you nullify it from today onward?” snorted Prince Beny from the Spanish royal family.

The Spanish royal family was an old guest of the Business Summit in Venice. They were one of the most important members within the Chambers of Commerce. Their main business activity was noble silver and rare pearls.

“Of course, I can nullify the contract. After all, the value of your trinket productions pales in comparison to the small crafts from Yiwu, China that are exported worldwide. You can trade in the Indian Ocean. Sign the contract and you will no longer be on the list of the Chambers of Commerce of Venice,” replied Zhao Manyan calmly.

The members from the Spanish royal family turned pale upon hearing his words.

Did the young man have God with him? Even Mr. Zhao dared not strike their names off from the Chambers of Commerce of Venice!

“Chambers of Commerce of Andeas will take over your place. Prince Beny, instead of spending time chatting with your female seniors and juniors in Ojos Holy School, you should spend more time supervising the processing chain of your noble silver jewelry. See for yourself the number of complaints and criticisms from European countries.” As Zhao Manyan was speaking, he shot a glance at the lady next to him.

The lady placed a stack of documents before the Spanish royal family and Prince Beny.

Under the crowd’s stare, Prince Beny did not have the courage to flip through the documents. He was well aware of the contents inside the documents. Before this, Zhao Youqian was in charge of the Chambers Of Commerce, and he had helped Prince Beny handle the issue in silence. However, the new heir had exposed the issue.

“The Zhao family has two more years as the president of Chambers of Commerce, and I’ll be running the show for these two years. Regardless of our titles or statuses, we are all businessmen at heart. Even a fruit vendor can pick out rotten fruits from a pile of fruits, so why can’t you, especially in luxurious goods trades? How disappointing!”

“Does anyone here have any comments on the change of quota?” Zhao Manyan looked around the room.

Some of them had business dealings with the Spanish royal family. Before they could raise objections, Zhao Manyan went on to say, “If you have any opinions, you don’t have to talk to me. You can talk to the Chambers of Commerce of Andeas Alliance.”

Right after he said that most of them decided not to speak up for the Spanish Royal family.

The Chambers of Commerce of Andeas Alliance was a bold, new country.

Their National Chambers of Commerce practiced the same culture. They would fight to death with anyone who stopped them from gaining wealth. Most of the attendees in the Business Summit traded internationally, and they were well aware of the situation in South America.

The Spanish royal family did not have much power. Meanwhile, the Chambers of Commerce of Andeas Alliance was different. The Chambers of Commerce was tied to the union countries.

It was clear that the new president had obtained the Chambers of Commerce of Andeas Alliance’s full support. Otherwise, the countries in South America would not show their interests in the Chambers of Commerce of Venice.

Zhao Manyan had just joined the Chambers of Commerce of Venice, and he had already struck the Spanish royal family off the list and replaced it with a new Chamber of Commerce. Many, in the beginning, wanted to show their dissatisfaction. But they kept quiet.

The Chamber of Commerce was not as simple as it appeared to be.

Not only were members of the Chambers of Commerce scheming and fighting against one another, but Zhao Group itself was riddled with flaws. Despite Zhao Youqian’s efforts, his influence was far less than that of his father.

Even if Zhao Youqian was the one who came to power, he, too, would be questioned in many ways. He might even be requested to step down on the spot to give way to someone else who had more power to take over the presidency of the Chambers of Commerce of Venice.

Zhao Youqian’s purpose was not to daunt the business tycoons. All he had to do was to keep Zhao Group’s two-year appointment as the president of Chambers of Commerce.

“I am a suspicious person by nature. Regardless of which country, which field, or which forces you serve, I have never heard of your name before. Your understanding about the Chambers of Commerce may be even lesser than that of my servant. May I know how you intend to lead us to glory? Since Mr. Zhao has passed away, we should hold a general election soon. After all, your auctions have been noticeably empty in recent years, at least in Europe. I don’t care much about it in other regions,” said Nozankasa of the Kasa family.

“From now on, things will change,” said Zhao Manyan.

“How are you going to make the change? I don’t want to listen to your empty and childish development plan. I need to see something practical. If none, please return to your seat in the Chambers of Commerce, and I’ll be the host today. After all, we have basically confirmed the Kasa family as the next president to serve. It’s not a bad thing to serve the Chambers of Commerce two years earlier,” Nozankasa said provocatively.

When the Kasa family took the lead, many European consortia and royal families expressed their dissatisfaction and requested to immediately hold a general election.

“Everyone. Silence, please.” said Zhao Manyan.

However, the arguments continued. It was clear that the crowd refused to listen to Zhao Manyan. Just then, Nozankasa raised his hand and clenched his fist.

Within a moment, the crowd fell silent. They showed their respect to Nozankasa, as if he was their leader. They waited for him to make his speech.

“Please show us that your family’s auction and magic bazaar continue to occupy the largest share of the Chambers of Commerce among all of the countries.” Nozankasa extended an inviting hand. The gesture made him look like a gentleman, but he was, in fact, being aggressive.

“Does that mean that we will continue to preside over the Chambers of Commerce over the next two years if I manage to show you the proof?” asked Zhao Manyan.

“At least I won’t have any refuting opinions on that,” said Nozankasa with a smile.

The European Kasa family was involved in a wide array of activities, one of which was close to Zhao Group’s main business activities, auction and magic bazaar. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They were aware that Zhao Group’s operation of auction in various countries was no longer as profitable as it used to be.

Without Mr. Zhao, Zhao Group was still able to stand firm in the international arena, but they lacked the qualification to preside over the Chambers of Commerce of Venice.

“This is our contract with the Victorian Dragon Taming family. We will be in charge of all the dragon-related auctions in Europe, Asia, and America in the future.” Zhao Manyan snapped his fingers.

A blonde, blue-eyed Italian woman dressed in a professional suit walked up to Nozankasa and passed him a copy of the documents.

Nozankasa was stunned. He quickly flipped through the copy of the documents. The contents were lengthy. He did not read everything in detail, but he noticed Duke Ayleen’s signature at the end of the contract!

Duke Ayleen was the first heir of the Victorian Dragon Taming family. They were told that the title of “heir” could be removed now because Ayleen had already taken the reins of the Victorian Dragon Taming family.

The Victorian Dragon Taming family was at their height of power. They were the only great family that surpassed the Kasa family in Europe!
