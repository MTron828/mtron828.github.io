The journey back was smooth. Many of the native creatures were hiding in their dens after the snowstorm arrived. They might fail to find their way back home if they continued to roam around outside.

The group did not have to follow the Rift of Tianshan Mountain to leave the mountain, they just needed to go downhill most of the time. Their first priority was to escape the snowstorm.

The higher the altitude, the deadlier a storm was. It was like a slow-moving avalanche. It turned the whole mountain white, including the Meadow and the Barren Ground which they had passed first. Even species with an outstanding cold resistance would struggle to survive the cold, let alone outsiders with not much cold resistance, such as humans!

Mo Fan could not help but turn around to look over the true land of ice and snow one last time after they reached a safe distance. The vast whiteness had devoured the blue sky and the mountain.

Even without the Rift of Tianshan Mountain, their journey to the Scar of Tianshan Mountain had been challenging. It would have been a lot worse if they had searched aimlessly for the way up in the Meadow, the Alpine, and the Valley of Glaciers. Their chance of survival would have dropped significantly; there were too many unknown factors, and situations that human Mages had never encountered before. The old folks were right. It did not matter what cultivation one possessed, they had to pay enough respect to the mountain!

The group finally made it back to Wanggui Town. Normally, everyone would have taken a nice hot shower and had a delicious meal, before enjoying a comfortable sleep after returning from an adventure.

However, they could not afford to make any contact with water after leaving Tianshan Mountain, not even hot water. Their skin had almost cracked apart from the cold. There was still ice that had not melted inside their skin and flesh. They had lost feeling in many body parts, like they had been injected with anesthetic. Many of the survivors were terrified when they discovered their bodies were like seriously damaged old machines that might stop operating at any second. It was the reason some Mages never woke up after falling unconscious on the mountain!

Mo Fan recovered rapidly. He was already enjoying the hot spring while the others were using traditional methods to drive the cold out of their bodies.

The wooden door swung open before Mu Mu Ningxue walked in with a basket containing her bathrobe, bath scent, and clothes. Her alluring silver-white hair was already tied up, revealing her flawless face and neck. Most importantly, she was only wearing a sling skirt since she was going to change into the bathrobe. The thin skirt was unable to conceal her bust.

Mu Ningxue was startled when she saw Mo Fan lying in the hot water.

“I’m sorry, I took the wrong door,” Mu Ningxue turned around and was going to close the door.

“No, it’s the right one, it’s your bath. I was just testing the water temperature for you. Mm... the temperature is just right. You should come inside,” Mo Fan smiled. He was getting restless.

“Well... you can enjoy the bath first. I’ll come later,” Mu Ningxue still insisted on closing the door.

“Xuexue, come here, I have something to discuss with you too. We have been together for so long. Why are you feeling embarrassed? We can finally relax. Let’s enjoy the bath together, drink some tea, and have a heart-to-heart chat and do something, uh, something meaningful,” Mo Fan said.

While Mu Ningxue was hesitating, Mo Fan already left the bath and came over shamelessly to drag her into the water.

“Just lie still, I’ll go down myself...” Mu Ningxue was still a little embarrassed. She quickly stopped the shameless man’s reckless act.

“Oh, sure, I’ll lie still, you can climb on me yourself,” Mo Fan immediately understood. He went back into the comfortable water and lied with his face upward, resting his head on a hot stone. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Mu Ningxue blushed after hearing the words from this man who was constantly filled with evil thoughts. She slowly put the bucket on the side and prepared her hair before going into the water...

“Xuexue, no one wears their sleepwear when enjoying a hot bath. It’s very cold here, so it’s difficult for clothes to dry even under sunlight. You shouldn’t soak your sleepwear. Here, I’ll lend you a hand,” Mo Fan went closer to Mu Ningxue.

“I just want to take a bath. Don’t...” Mu Ningxue said.

Every woman had a great ability to predict danger, especially when a man was blatantly showing his intentions. It meant she would struggle to get anything done for a long time. While they were trying to study properly, the molesting hands would strike. When they were taking a nap, they would be hugged from behind. They even had to lock the door after going into the bathroom.

Mo Fan’s passionate gaze could easily melt the ice of Tianshan Mountain. Mu Ningxue decisively covered herself with her towel after realizing something was fishy and quickly went back to her room.

“Seriously?” Mo Fan was left speechless.

He was being too impatient with things. Taking a bath together was a little challenging, unlike doing it on the couch, in the kitchen, or on the balcony.

Mo Fan rubbed his chin and lay there comfortably. He was figuring out a way to make steady progress. There were so many places and postures he had not unlocked. The days ahead were long. He could not possibly use the standard missionary posture every time. It would be a waste of Mu Ningxue’s flexible body and his outstanding abs.

Mo Fan was just letting out a long sigh when he suddenly heard a comfortable sound beside him. He turned around and saw a little creature lying in the shallow area of the hot spring with its limbs upward and a pleasant expression on its face!

“Damn it, why are you still here?” Mo Fan almost jumped out of the water in shock.

He had prepared the bath for his wife, instead of this dirty little cub who kept drooling!

The little cub ignored Mo Fan’s shout. She waved her limbs around as if she had never enjoyed such a comfortable bath before.

“Should I serve you a plate of marinated beef too?” Mo Fan asked her.

The little cub nodded immediately!

“Piss off! I’m telling you, my Contracts are full, and I won’t take you in even if I have a vacant spot. What can you possibly do except for eating, drinking, tricking girls to hold you in their arms, and bringing me trouble?” Mo Fan snarled.
