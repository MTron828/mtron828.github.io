Chapter 2587: The Lord of Darkness’ Identity

Translated by XephiZ

“Yucay, you have talked too much today,” the Lord of Darkness interrupted Yucay.

The Saintess of Darkness suddenly turned around and looked at the Lord of Darkness. “Do you feel scared, too?”

“I have no fear,” the Lord of Darkness refuted her.

“But you don’t want me to tell these people who are about to leave the Dark Plane certain things. You never want the world to know your ambitions, even when countless people are still praying to you and grieving over your death,” the Saintess of Darkness said. She seemed to be accusing the Lord of Darkness.

“Your words won’t reach my inner being. I’m just a chess player,” the Lord of Darkness said calmly.

“You have countless clones, each representing a part of your nature. You might be able to control your clones in the living world, but the rest of them are galloping everywhere in the Dark Plane like wild horses!” the Saintess of Darkness rebuked him.

Mo Fan was utterly confused. The Saintess of Darkness was probably not in her right mind.

She had been treating Mo Fan like an enemy because of what had happened to the Cold Prince just a moment ago, but she was now accusing the Lord of Darkness, as if she was familiar with him.

The Saintess of Darkness suddenly pointed at Su Lu. “That guy is an ambitious zealot who thinks he can rule over everything!”

Su Lu frowned.

What is the mad woman doing? Just hurry up and kill Mo Fan so I can leave the Dark Plane. Why is she talking nonsense?

“But compared to you, he’s just like a three-year-old. His ambition, conspiracy, and wisdom are nothing compared to you,” the Saintess of Darkness went on.

Su Lu’s face darkened.

Did she just say he was like a three-year-old? He was the Chairman of the Asia Magic Association. He had even subdued the Black Dragon Emperor!

Once he left this place, he would defeat the Sacred City and its Angels to take over the world!

“Madam, can you please give me a name?” Mo Fan asked impatiently.

The woman had said so much to accuse the Lord of Darkness. She even claimed Su Lu’s ambition was naive. Who exactly was she comparing Su Lu to?

The Supreme Pontiff?

Izisha?

Salan?

Or was it someone who had remained in the dark while controlling their world, like the Lord of Darkness who was controlling the match while staying hidden under his robe?

She should just give them a name!

“Wen Tai.

“Wen Tai!

“His name is Weeeen Taaaai!”

The Saintess of Darkness surprisingly agreed to his request and gave Mo Fan a name.

She even repeated the name thrice, each louder than the previous time. She even dragged her tone during the third time, uttering it in a trembling voice!

Wen Tai? Holy Saint Wen Tai?

What about him? Wasn’t he already dead and dragged to the deepest part of the Dark Plane where no one could ever see him? He was exiled to a vast and empty dark cage!

Su Lu burst out laughing. “Why do you bother comparing me with a man who couldn’t even save himself?”

He thought the woman was going to say a name that would baffle him. He thought she was going to reveal a great secret, but she was merely referring to Wen Tai in the end.

Wen Tai could not even outsmart his own sister Izisha. He was dragged into Hell in the end.

His wife went mad and was killing innocent people while searching for his murderers.

His daughter almost became a sacrifice to Izisha’s resurrection. She was almost sent to Hell too!

How could a failure like him be comparable to the Chairman of the Asia Magic Association? He only had an undeserved reputation!

It was hilarious that the woman had compared him to Wen Tai!

“What are you laughing at?” the Saintess of Darkness asked Su Lu coldly.

“I’m still alive at least. What about him? You should just die. I can kill them all by myself,” Su Lu said.

“HAHAHAHAHA,” Yucay burst out laughing. Her body even leaned backward because she was laughing too hard.

“I thought you were impressive, but you are just a mad woman,” Su Lu scoffed.

“You idiots. In the end, you still have no idea who’s trying to take away your freedom, even after you are dead. How stupid can you all be…” the Saintess of Darkness said.

Asha’ruiya seemed to realize something. She stared at the Lord of Darkness.

The Lord of Darkness stayed as silent as a dark icy mountain. She could not sense any emotions from him.

“The one who’s controlling your lives and trying to trap your souls is the same person who’s worshiped as a saint in your world! The old Lord of Darkness has already retired from the scene. A man who tricked the whole world has come to the Dark Plane to rule over it!

“You all thought he was willing to accept the terrible punishment, like Jesus who died willingly just to awaken the world’s conscience, but do you really know his real ambition?

“He did not even bother to rule over the living world. His ambition was to rule over the Dark Plane, which is countless times stronger than the living world!”

“People’s mourning and worship have given him the power to rule over the Dark Plane. He was not dragged into the Dark Plane by force. He opened the gate to the Dark Plane himself!

“The fight between me and Izisha was only part of his conspiracy.

“The more heartless and cold-blooded Izisha became, the more she set off his nobility.

“He resurrected Izisha so she would continue to mess up the living world.

“He has earned the respect of the whole world, but it was not enough to satisfy him. Now, he has achieved his goal of ruling over the Dark Plane. He has made you idiots into chess pieces to entertain himself!

“Think about it! If he can make you travelers into his chess pieces, why couldn’t he control the demon creatures of your world, too? Why couldn’t he turn your world into Hell, too?”

“Wouldn’t he become the ruler of both planes?”

“How stupid are all of you!

“How stupid are all of you!!

“How stupid are all of you!!!”

Yucay yelled frantically, like she was venting all the hatred and grudges in her heart.

When she was still a Saintess and had the upper hand over Izisha, Wen Tai had been hiding and watching them fight. He had ended up becoming the Holy Saint.

After coming to the Dark Plane, she had done everything to gain power through the Evil Faith.

In the end, all her efforts had benefited someone else.

She could not escape the man’s control, no matter where she went. She had even ended up as a mere chess piece, just to entertain one of his clones!

Why would she be afraid of being tortured endlessly after everything she had been through?

Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya were stunned.

Was the Lord of Darkness Wen Tai? nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Wen Tai was the Lord of Darkness?

Was the Saintess of Darkness telling the truth?
