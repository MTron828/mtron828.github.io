The Blue Deacon shoved his palm forward indifferently when he saw the fiery dragon lunging at him. An extremely thick wall of ice materialized in front of him.

The fierce Meteorite Fist dissipated instantly after ramming into the wall of ice. It was nowhere strong enough to penetrate it!

“Silent Deadly Bolt!”

Mo Fan proceeded to cast his Lightning Spell. The black death bolt struck the wall of ice fiercely.

The blurred figure behind the wall suddenly moved away. The death bolt only landed on an afterimage, failing to hit the detestable Blue Deacon.

The guy’s unpleasant, sharp laughter was still lingering in the air. Mo Fan glanced around him and immediately saw a few walls of ice appearing in his surroundings. The reflective surfaces of the walls were like mirrors. Mo Fan saw over ten reflections of the man in a blue hoodie moving toward him with a cruel, eerie grin on his pointy face!

Mo Fan slammed a Fiery Fist into the ground. Nine fiery pillars emerged from the ground and smashed the ice mirrors around him into pieces.

However, Mo Fan soon discovered his Fire Spells were a lot weaker than usual. It felt like the damage multiplier from his Soul Seed had been halved. The fiery pillars were actually having trouble breaking the ice!

“A Domain?” Mo Fan frowned.

The man’s powerful Ice Domain had weakened Mo Fan’s Fire Spells to a quarter normal. It explained why his Meteorite Fist was unable to penetrate the simple wall of ice that the man had summoned with a random wave.

The Blue Deacon was moving closer, his deeply sunken pupils holding a mocking look. The eyes surrounding Mo Fan were actually giving him huge pressure!

“Nyx Regime!” Mo Fan immediately cast the Shadow Spell when he realized that the man might be a Psychic Mage.

The eyes staring at him had greatly enlarged the fear in his heart. The best way to avoid the eyes was by covering the area with darkness. He could then hide in the darkness, preventing the enemy from knowing where he was.

“Such a little trick is useless against me...”

The Blue Deacon appeared behind Mo Fan. Several ice chains with spikes close to the tips sprang at Mo Fan, trying to lock him down!

The ice chains were incredibly fast. They flashed ahead, stabbing at Mo Fan!

However, the Mo Fan that the ice chains landed on turned into a broken shadow and dispersed like a wisp of black smoke.

“Interesting, nice dodge!” the Blue Deacon grinned, revealing his yellow teeth. As he was speaking, he quickly turned sideways and stared into the darkness, right into Mo Fan’s eyes!

A sudden flash came from the direction he was looking in. The long lightning arc danced wildly through the air and struck the Blue Deacon like a striking snake!

Ice armor appeared in front of the Blue Deacon, shielding him from the lightning whip. “Come out here!” the Blue Deacon snapped furiously.

A few ice blades circled the Blue Deacon. More ice blades appeared around him as his focus grew stronger.

The area covered by the ice blades gradually increased with every spin. The vehicles that were destroyed previously were now shredded into pieces of junk.

The ice blades started from a tiny tornado and eventually grew into an entire whirlwind of ice blades. The area covered by the Nyx Regime was soon filled by the blades of ice. If any living creature stood inside the spell for just a few seconds, not even their corpse would be left behind!

Mo Fan sensed a strong danger from the wild storm. He did not dare to stay in his zone of darkness any longer.

He quickly fled the zone, but the area of the dancing ice blades was still growing while they were chasing after him...

The ice blades completely destroyed everything they came into contact with. Nothing was left whole within its coverage. The vehicles on the street were turned into metal shreds. The buildings on both sides were shredded into tiny sand. If most people had not evacuated because of the hail, hundreds of people would have died instantly to the terrifying spell!

Mo Fan used both the Blood Tabi and Fleeing Shadow to barely escape the grasp of the ice blades.

Mo Fan turned around, and was surprised to see that the whole street had disappeared. All that was left was dust and broken pieces. He could not help but gasp.

This Blue Deacon that came to take his life was incredibly scary!

“Mo Fan, let’s run! We don’t stand a chance against him!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

The man was simply too strong for them. The Advanced Mages had no clue how to help him out. This man had forced them to withdraw with a random spell. The difference between their strengths was simply too great. It was more important to stay alive for now!

Mo Fan was not an idiot ignorant of the present situation. It turned out that Salan seriously wanted him dead; the assassin she had sent was incredibly strong. If his cultivation had not improved a lot recently, the Blue Deacon would have killed him within minutes!

“Who’s there? How dare you try to kill someone on the streets in New York!” a middle-aged man shouted furiously in the distance.

The man was wearing a black and gold outfit, with a pair of Magic Wings on his back. He was floating above the debris of the fallen buildings, his eyes locked onto the Blue Deacon.

A black and gold outfit, the symbolic colors of the Sacred Hall Mages!

Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, Jiang Yu, and the others were relieved when they saw the Sacred Hall Mage appearing in time.

If the Sacred Hall Mage had arrived just a bit later, the entire team could not possibly survive. The Ice Mage was just too terrifying!

“Such a busybody, die!” the Blue Deacon uttered disdainfully. His eyes emitted a strange glow, forming a spiritual wave he fired at the Sacred Hall Mage in the distance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Sacred Hall Mage was astounded. He was just about to react when his mind fell into chaos, preventing him from casting the simplest spell.

The Blue Deacon raised his hand. A block of giant ice the size of a hill came falling down onto the Sacred Hall Mage from the hail!

The enormous ice was the size of a building. The Sacred Hall Mage had no chance of resisting it if it simply fell onto his head like that...

“Telekinesis!” In the nick of time, Mo Fan grabbed the Sacred Hall Mage and dragged the dumbfounded man away.

With a huge crash, the ice slammed into the ground and drove in more than ten meters deep, leaving countless cracks down the long street!

It took the Sacred Hall Mage a long time to recover from his astonishment. He shivered in fear when he saw the terrifying sight behind him.

If the Space Element force had not hauled him away, he would be buried deep in the ground by now. He did not expect the person bringing chaos to the street would be so strong!

A purple gust approached from an alleyway on the other side and stopped in front of Mo Fan.

Mo Fan glanced at the person’s clothes. He was also dressed in a black and gold outfit. He seemed to be a Wind Mage with a purple Wind Seed. Judging from his aura, he was a lot stronger than the Mage who almost died just a moment ago.

“It’s your first time patrolling the area as an intern, and you’ve already stumbled into such a strong enemy... I’ll handle it, just take care of the innocent people,” the Sacred Hall Mage with the purple wind ordered.

Saying that, the Purple Wind Sacred Hall Mage stepped forward and fixed his eyes on the Blue Deacon.

The purple wind continued to circle him. It looked disordered at first glance, but it was gradually growing stronger, the wind from each loop was pushing the winds from the previous revolution. More tracks began to appear, with clearer outlines...

“Purple Wind Domain... humph!” the Blue Deacon harrumphed coldly.

The Sacred Hall Mages had arrived a lot quicker than he expected, especially the guy who was able to control the purple wind.

It was not like the Blue Deacon was scared of the slightly reputable Sacred Hall Mage, but considering he was currently in the Sacred Hall of Liberty’s territory, if a Super Mage happened to pass by the area, he would have trouble leaving this place in one piece!

“I don’t feel too good, since I haven’t killed anyone today. Next time, I’ll make up for the joy I’ve missed out on today!” The Blue Deacon did not seem worried at all.

The purple wind had surrounded him, but huge hailstones started pouring down from the sky suddenly.

The hailstones were falling densely. The Blue Deacon’s outline gradually turned faint. The Purple Wind Sacred Hall Mage was just about to launch his attack, but the Blue Deacon had already disappeared...

The hail stopped at once as the temperature slowly recovered. The Purple Wind Mage glanced around him. When he confirmed that the man had left, he took out a communication device and mumbled softly into it.

He needed to report the incident to the Sacred Hall of Liberty immediately. The street was heavily damaged, and the number of people that were injured remained unknown.

“Advisor, why didn’t you stop him?” the Sacred Hall Mage with Magic Wings asked.

“I couldn’t!” The Purple Wind Sacred Hall Mage turned around and looked at Mo Fan, who was covered in blood.

It was obvious that the attacker was here for the young man. To the Purple Wind Mage’s surprise, despite the attacker’s great strength and Domain, he had failed to kill the young man quickly enough. It implied that the young man was quite talented!

“Are you a member of the Chinese national team?” the Purple Wind Mage asked.

“Mmm,” Mo Fan nodded.

“I watched your fight at the Training Hall this afternoon. Who was that guy? Why did he want you dead?” the Purple Wind Mage asked.

“The Black Vatican! Unfortunately, I’m starting to become too much of a trouble to them. Let’s discuss it later; can you hurry up and get her to the hospital?” Mo Fan asked when he saw the both of them had the ability to fly.

“You are seriously injured too!”

“I’m fine,” Mo Fan’s body was special. Injuries of this level were nowhere enough to threaten his life.

“The Sacred Hall Mages will investigate the matter. However, I believe that guy will find another chance to attack you again. Be careful,” the Purple Wind Sacred Hall Mage warned him.

“If he dares to show up less than five kilometers away from the Sacred Hall of Liberty, I believe it’s useless no matter how careful I am,” Mo Fan answered fatalistically.
