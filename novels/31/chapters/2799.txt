“If Commander Hua dies, the coastline will be wiped out, right?” Jiang Yu stared at the frightening terrain filled with darkness.

Pang Lai, too, was staring at the darkness that was entirely filled with the Black Dragon King Ants.

“If the Black Claw Emperor dies, the East Coastline is safe, right?” asked Song Feiyao.

The sight before them was too shocking to behold. Even though they had achieved Super level in their cultivation, their power was insignificant compared to the battle that was raging now. They were like a small canoe in the middle of a rainstorm.

Pang Lai shook his head. He did not answer Jiang Yu’s question. His silence was answer enough.

If Commander Hua died, the East Coastline could not last for long. Not many Forbidden Mages could unleash the perfect Forbidden Curse like Commander Hua. He fought the Emperor-level Ocean Demon on his own. No one was capable of fighting their way into the Pacific Ocean and killing the leader of the Ocean Demon like Commander Hua.

Commander Hua was not only the soul of the Battlemage, but he was also the country’s pillar. Without him, they would lose a leader who brought them hope in the middle of such a chaotic environment. Losing Commander Hua meant the mages would lose their soul.

How could a team of soulless mages fight the Ocean Demon army that were many times stronger than they were?

Pang Lai shook his head. He disagreed with Song Feiyao.

There was more than one Emperor-level Ocean Demon on the East Coastline. It was clear that the Black Claw Emperor was not the main culprit behind the Ocean Demon attack. Which Emperor-level Ocean Demon had started the war? Which Emperor-level Ocean Demon had manipulated all the Emperor-level Ocean Demon in the Pacific Ocean? All of these remained a mystery…

The only thing that was of certainty was that the Emperor-level Ocean Demon which had started the ocean battle was as powerful as the South Emperor.

Although Commander Hua had taken a huge risk, it would not improve the situation by very much. The East Coastline would still be in crisis. Many hordes, kingdoms, and Emperor-level Ocean Demons had yet to reveal themselves. The Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother was just one of the many.

They had gained victory and weakened the Ocean Demon force. Still, they had only preserved 20,000 kilometers of the coastline seawall protection plan that was under Shao Zheng’s ruling in the past. The gnawing Dragon King Ants in transparent form under the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother’s command could easily turn a building into powder with their strength.

......

Humans were at a disadvantage right from the beginning.

All Commander Hua could do was to slightly even the odds. He tried to offer some hope and a fighting chance to the humans. But there was still a very long way to go.

…

Mo Fan closed his eyes. He prayed in his heart.

When he opened them, he was greeted by the sight of endless Dragon King Ants. After Commander Hua ambushed them, the sky around that area turned black. The mountains, rivers, lands, and blue sky disappeared out of sight.

The Black Dragon King Ant army sometimes resembled a great rainstorm, other times they resembled huge mountains. They were all black and made one’s skin tingle.

Mo Fan noticed a trace of substance that did not belong to the Dragon King Ant’s demonic aura. The substance was a sort of powerful burning power. Yet the flame was not visible to the eyes…

A faint white light cut through the dark sky like a meteor. It flew towards Mo Fan and the rest of the group.

There was a change in the Dragon King Ants. They seemed to have been stirred up by something. They formed a whirlpool. The Dragon King Ant whirlpool attempted to devour the faint white light. But the white light slowed down the terrifying pulling force.

The white meteor slowly moved forward. Time seemed to have slowed down.

Mo Fan was anxious. He knew it was Commander Hua. He was trying to break free from the Dragon King Ant’s whirlpool.

“Don’t,” said Pang Lai to Mo Fan, stopping him from rushing to help. “Trust him.”

That was not an ordinary Ocean Demon. Even if Mo Fan brought along the three greatest totem beasts, all of them would be swallowed by the Black Dragon King Ants. Their rescue mission would have been in vain!

Therefore, Mo Fan stood there and watched them. He wished he could cast a downpour of fire meteors from the sky and wipe out all the disgusting Black Dragon King Ants. However, without the help of Demon element magical power, Mo Fan could not do much with his fire magical power.

“He escaped!” Jiang Yu cried out in delight.

“Meow!”

The beam of white meteor slowed and broke free of the whirlpool made up of Black Dragon King Ants. The familiar figure grew closer to them.

When the white meteor arrived before Mo Fan and his group, his clothes were unkempt, and he was wounded. He looked like someone who had barely survived the encounter. However, his eyes still shone with brilliance. Even wounded, he looked as powerful and majestic as before.

“What’s the escape plan? I-I’ll have to listen to all of your arrangements…,” Commander Hua blurted out.

“Zhang Xiaohou used to burrow into the tunnel under the river. The Ocean Demons have abandoned it. We can go back to Bo Sea through it,” Mo Fan said.

“Hmm…” Commander Hua nodded. “Okay.”

“Commander Hua, how is the Black Claw Emperor…?”

“It’s dead.” Commander Hua smiled proudly at them.

The crowd was shocked and happy! Commander Hua had killed the Black Claw Emperor. It had made Bo Sea dangerous and killed many Apex-grade Mages on the East Coastline. It had finally died!

Mo Fan still remembered the fear he felt when it attacked Magic City with its monstrous claws, as if slapping and awakening to powerful mages from their dreams. Finally, the enormous ghostly spirit which had loomed over the East Coastline and other base cities had died!

Mo Fan felt inexplicably happy!

It meant the supreme Emperor-level Ocean Demon could be defeated, provided they were as powerful as Commander Hua!

…

Mo Fan’s plan was a success. There was no trace of the Dragon King Ants under the abandoned sea tunnel, including the transparent Dragon King Ants.

The Black Dragon King Ant army did not continue to chase after them. Unlike the other Ocean Demons, the moment the Dragon King Ants lost their Ant Mother, they were crippled. What mattered most to those creatures was to appoint a new Ant Mother rather than to follow them for revenge.
