Chapter 2412: Turning Over a New Leaf

Translated by XephiZ

The Wolf Queen’s fallen head howled.

A weird sight followed, as the Wolf Queen’s body reacted like it was being summoned. It suddenly lunged at her head and picked it up.

The Wolf Queen carried her head awkwardly and fled from the basin, even though the flames were still burning her flesh and fur.

A Ruler-level creature was terrifyingly tenacious!

On top of that, the Blood Flies under the Wolf Queen’s fur would soon be reborn. She would heal up in no time if she managed to escape with her head!

“Do you think you can run away? It’s time to end this!”

Mo Fan spread his arms. He took a step forward and slammed his hands into one another.

“Fiery Emperor’s Fan!”

The flames in the basin were swept up by the winds, like they were being fanned. The fiery blaze chased after the fleeing Wolf Queen.

The pyroclasm caught up to the Wolf Queen before she could run very far, and the area was soon covered in flames. It was blazing as red as a blast furnace.

The Wolf Queen failed to escape the flames, although she put up a fierce struggle. She was already at her limit, and no longer had a chance to survive.

Her head was crying out in agony, but her cries were soon covered by the loud roar of the flames. Her body stopped moving and fell to the ground.

Waves of fire swept over the creature numerous times, burning her fur into ashes and scorching her flesh and blood.

General Nan and Zhou Yuan drew closer, the light of the flames dying their faces red. Their eyes kept flickering as they stared.

They were having a hard time believing the Wolf Queen was dead. They had actually killed the powerful creature!

“Do you know how to retrieve its soul?” Mo Fan asked Zhou Yuan.

“Of…of course!” Zhou Yuan replied quickly.

Although the Wizard Bird Hunter Group had managed to kill the male Ruler-level Wolf and obtained its soul, it did not meet the requirements of their job.

The soul needed for a Summoned Beast to evolve had to be complete. If the soul was damaged by Dark Magic, it was difficult for a Summoned Beast to evolve.

“Claim the soul and deliver it to me,” Mo Fan ordered him.

“Does that mean you are…?” Zhou Yuan was stunned.

“I’m your client. I didn’t expect the Wizard Bird Hunter Group to be so unreliable,” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly.

Every Hunter should have known the importance of not leaving any threats behind when they were hunting down demon creatures. Mo Fan was extremely disappointed in the Wizard Bird Hunter Group!

Mo Fan would have taught them a lesson if he had not seen their resolve to risk their lives and keep Bo City safe up on the fortress.

“I’m sorry, we…we did let you down…” Zhou Yuan lowered his head in shame.

The Hunters had their rules. They were obliged to not leave any threats behind when they signed up for a quest.

Their mistake had caused the Wolf Queen to show up. It had almost turned into a huge tragedy!

“Senior, thanks for your help. How can the military ever thank you?” General Nan came limping over with a forced smile. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“That won’t be necessary, Bo City is my hometown,” Mo Fan told him.

“What?” General Nan was puzzled. Since when did Bo City have such a powerful Mage?!

The two Super Mages had really not helped much in the fight, they were merely playing supporting roles. They had the feeling this young man could have slain the Wolf Queen without their help!

“I’m Mo Fan.”

General Nan immediately realized who he was.

So this was Mo Fan! His strength was simply ridiculous! He could easily be the leading expert in many major cities, let alone the tiny Bo City!

“I’m glad that every general who has been in charge of Bo City has had an unyielding spirit!” Mo Fan’s tone was different when he was speaking to General Nan.

“I’m just doing my job. I’m ashamed that I’m not strong enough to fight a real Ruler-level creature,” General Nan answered humbly.

Several thousand soldiers were staring at the canyon from atop the Bo City fortress as Mo Fan and the two Super Mages returned.

They were left speechless when they saw Mo Fan, General Nan, and Zhou Yuan dragging the enormous burned carcass behind them.

Did they really kill the creature?

It was the Ruler of the Nanling Mountains, yet they had dragged its dead body back!

“The Wolf Queen is dead!”

“The Wolf Queen is dead!”

Someone started yelling after a moment. The whole fortress repeated the same words. Everyone was cheering like they had just won a battle.

If they had not experienced the strength of a Ruler-level creature in person, they would never have understood how precious and motivating this victory was!

Even a creature as strong as the Wolf Queen, who had been acting so arrogantly in front of them, was unable to escape from a true human expert.

Humans were not puny. Their Mages were superior to the demon creatures!

At Fanxue Mountain…

The guards had all gathered at the entrance and had their heads together, just to catch a glimpse of someone’s phone.

“What are you all doing? Aren’t you supposed to be doing your jobs?” Mu Linsheng yelled when he saw the guards were slacking.

“Ah, chief, look at this livestream. It’s f**king awesome, I’m so proud of Fanxue Mountain!” one of the guards exclaimed.

Mu Linsheng was puzzled. He stepped forward to look at the phone with them.

Mu Linsheng was stunned after he saw what was on the livestream. He snatched up the phone and ran to the main building in Fanxue Mountain.

“Hey, chief, don’t you have your own phone? Why are you taking mine!?” the guard yelled after him.

Mu Linsheng ignored the guard and ran straight to Mu Ningxue. “Ningxue, Ningxue!…”

He passed the phone to Mu Ningxue. Mu Ningxue had been resting her head on the table, dozing off from feeling tired, but she immediately became energetic after seeing the clip on the phone.

“Our boss is so cool!” Mu Linsheng was excited now too.

The clip was taken from a livestream that a Hunter had broadcast to the whole nation. Not only had it captured the arrogant behavior of the Wolf Queen, it also included the scene where Mo Fan had lifted up a whole mountain and thrown it at the Wolf Queen!

“So you’re the Wolf Queen? I’m going to slaughter you today!”?Those words alone were enough to make Mu Linsheng’s blood boil!

The event had taken place not long ago, since the clip was from a recent broadcast.

Even more shockingly, another clip was spreading on the web. It had recorded the scene where Mo Fan, General Nan, and Zhou Yuan had dragged the Wolf Queen’s carcass back to the fortress.

They had actually killed it. Mo Fan had killed a real Ruler-level creature, one which had ruled over the Nanling Mountains for dozens of years!

Mu Ningxue suddenly had trouble recognizing the man.

He had to work so hard just to survive the Calamity of Bo City, but now he had slain the Wolf Queen and protected the city all by himself. He had completely turned over a new leaf!
