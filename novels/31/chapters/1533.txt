“What should we do then? Should we go up there and cover up the eye?” Sofia asked.

“Yeah, but there should be some powerful creatures around here. You two will lure them away, I’ll head up there and see if I can turn it off,” Mo Fan said.

Heidi and Sofia nodded, heading off separate ways.

Sofia used her Shadow Element to move closer to the pitch-black tower, but before she reached it, she heard a loud snort, followed by a strong black gust surging across the area.

“A Great Commander-level creature is here!” Sofia blurted out.

She was indeed a high-achiever from the European University Institute. She quickly cast the Nyx Regime to extend the reach of her Fleeing Shadow. In the Nyx Regime, the speed of Fleeing Shadow was comparable to Blink. Furthermore, it was difficult to track a Shadow Mage in the Nyx Regime.

Mo Fan was too far away to see the Great Commander-level creature that Sofia had encountered. He only saw the creature extending its oddly-shaped wings and lunging out from an ancient structure that was still intact.

The creature was obviously a Shadow Element creature, too. Sofia had made a careless mistake. The Nyx Regime would strengthen the Shadow Element of both ally and enemy! Heidi quickly entered the Nyx Regime to defend Sofia from the creature with oddly-shaped wings after seeing the pinch she was in.

“It seems to be a Nyx Blood Bat. I was wondering why there weren’t one or two guards looking after a piece of treasure like this!” Mo Fan went a little closer and was finally able to catch a glimpse of the creature.

The creature was extremely ugly. Bat demons were among the ugliest of all species. The bats that people normally saw were extremely small. A Nyx Blood Bat that was over ten meters long was easily every normal person’s nightmare. A single glance was enough to make them faint.

The Nyx Blood Bat’s speed was insanely high in the Nyx Regime. Sofia had forgotten about that possibility in her panic. Luckily, Heidi made it in time. They slowly nullified the danger by working together.

Mo Fan did not put too much attention on them. Heidi needed more experience. If she had been constantly at the brink of death like him, her strength would easily be on par with his. Mo Fan did not want to disturb her training.

Mo Fan sneaked over to the pitch-black tower and easily made his way to the top using the irregular spots along its walls.

“Ouch, that hurts!” Mo Fan was thinking of removing the Burning Evil Eye with his hand, but he noticed his arm rotting ten times quicker than before. The skin was already beyond recognition.

“The closer I am, the deadlier the burning is. That being said, I will gladly claim this abandoned piece of treasure!” Mo Fan could not care less about the danger.

His demon flesh was extremely handy at times. If it was a weaker Mage trying to do this, their whole body would have rotted before they could even reach the top.

Mo Fan clenched his teeth and forcibly snatched up the Burning Evil Eye!

The Burning Evil Eye was just like a defense mechanism. Once it was shut off, it would no longer emit the poisonous light. Mo Fan was familiar with its nature, so he was daring enough to snatch it right away!

The Burning Evil Eye was as big as a basin. Mo Fan’s face was almost rotted before he finally removed the eye from its socket. Luckily, it was only set inside the socket and guarded by a Nyx Blood Bat. Otherwise, they would have had to flee from the place immediately!

“I should bring it back to New Fanxue City and aim it at the shallow waters. It will burn any sea monster that comes close... hehe, perfect!” Mo Fan immediately tossed the Burning Evil Eye into his Space Ring.

The evil light was gone when he made it back to the ground. Sofia and Heidi were still fighting the Nyx Blood Bat.

“It seems like Mu Ningxue was right, it’s important to read books!” Mo Fan mumbled to himself.

The two girls had not had a clue what the Burning Evil Eye was. They were frightened by the powerful ancient artifact, but Mo Fan was overjoyed when he realized what it was! He did not expect to find such a valuable piece of treasure at the dilapidated shrine so quickly!

Mo Fan had sneakily had Sofia and Heidi leave by asking them to lure the demon creature guarding the Burning Evil Eye away, just so he could snatch the treasure for himself!

“The evil light has disappeared!”

“Let’s go, this Nyx Blood Bat is too hard to kill. We’ll only attract the attention of other demon creatures at this rate,” Sofia said.

“Mm, time to go!”

“Did you destroy the Burning Evil Eye?” Heidi asked while running.

“Yeah, it was better to destroy it considering how harmful it is. Otherwise, some other Hunters might die to it again,” Mo Fan replied without blinking.

“That’s great!”

—

After they had regrouped with the others, the Nyx Blood Bat was still pursuing them relentlessly. Mo Fan had stolen its treasure. How could it possibly give up the chase so easily?

However, it was obvious that the Nyx Blood Bat was not friendly with the snake demons. The snake demons were not stirred up by the antics of the enraged Nyx Blood Bat. It seemed the snake demons were not the only species residing at the Sunset Shrine...

The Nyx Blood Bat kept chasing after the three, but they had a whole group to back them up, including the Super Mage, Mentor Vani. They did not have any trouble taking out the Nyx Blood Bat.

They did not attract too much attention, either; Heidi suppressed the Nyx Blood Bat with her Space Element, giving the people of the European University Institute the chance to prove themselves. After a series of powerful spells that did not produce too much noise, the Great Commander-level creature was brutally killed.

“Is anyone’s body rotting still?” Mo Fan asked.

“Not anymore! Mo Fan, you’re so impressive! How did you know it was the cause?” Chad had to ask.

“It’s nothing really, many strange incidents have a reason behind them. You will learn the truth once you find the key to it. With that thought, nothing is scary anymore,” Mo Fan replied loftily.

“Look at you, aren’t you just lucky for discovering it?” Ferrero harrumphed coldly.

“Sure, I’ll let you handle it if we find ourselves in any trouble again. Otherwise, can you automatically shut your mouth up for five minutes while I’m talking?” Mo Fan immediately riposted. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Mo Fan had a strange habit: he had zero tolerance for half-wits!

“I can handle it, I’ll show you how capable the students of the European University Institute are!” Ferrero declared.

“Let’s hope you won’t put our lives in danger,” Mo Fan immediately shot him down.

“Are you treating me like a three-year-old!?”

“Alright, that’s enough, we should be working together in a time like this. Now is not the time to argue between ourselves,” Mentor Vani cut in.

Mo Fan was in a good mood after finding a valuable artifact. He did not want to waste further time on the idiot.
