Professor Luo Cast a special spell on everyone in the group. It attached to them like a thin raincoat made from crystals.

‘An Undead Ruler whose backbone was covered under a shell was standing on the roof of a building. It generally resembled a huge crab, but its mouth and throat made up its entire body.

It felt like its back and its stomach were its upper and lower jaws, while its stomach was its throat!

‘The monster could swallow a twenty-story building with a single bite!

‘An Undead Cuttlefish was on top of another building. Its strange-looking soft body and its eerily long tentacles were made up of white bones. The magnificent building was struggling to support its weight.

Its head was at the top of the building, but its tentacles were dangling halfway down the sides. The building was around three hundred meters tall. If the buildings had not been protected by the magic barrier, the creatures could knock them down as easily as toy blocks!

‘The two Undead Rulers were obviously the strongest among the Undead. There were other Rulers too, but they were looking at the other side of the river restlessly. They were waiting for the altar to be taken down, and the order of their leader on the overhead walkway!

Mo Fan’s group approached the overhead bridge. It was built in the shape of a ring. They could see the flowers that had been planted under the bridge.

The strange thing was, even though the place was brimming with the presence of death, the flowers under the bridge did not wilt, nor were they destroyed by the Undead. They were purposely avoiding the flowers so the person on the bridge could admire them.

“Ding Yumian.”

Dean Xiao, Professor Shi, Professor Luo, the teacher with white brows, Wei Rong, and Mo Fan all landed on the bridge.

The Undead woman had obviously seen them too. She put on a weird smile.

She had inherited Ding Yumian’s memories, but her heart was filled with hatred and vengeance. If the spirit they had found on the island was Ding Yumian’s Soul of Kindness, the monster in front of them had Ding Yumian’s Soul of Vengeance in control!

“You’re not dead? How did you survive!?” the Undead asked Mo Fan directly.

She sounded eager to learn the answer. It seemed like the vengeful spirit had a strong urge to live, even though she had turned into an Undead!

Mo Fan’s head hurt.

The Soul of Kindness and Soul of Vengeance were completely different. The Soul of Kindness was relieved to see him alive.

On the other hand, the Soul of Vengeance wanted to tear his head open and learn the secrets of how he had come back to life.

Mo Fan looked at the Undead around him and asked, “I’m curious, too. How did you turn the sea monsters that had died with you into your soldiers?”

‘These Undead were the elite soldiers of the Sea Gods. They were the assault troops that were assigned to break through the Magic City’s defense, but they had turned into Ding Yumian’s soldiers.

“We’ve already found out the truth about your death. Dean Lee has paid the price for his actions…” Dean Xiao said.

“Did you come to change my mind?” Ding Yumian smiled eerily. She looked at the Soul of Kindness and asked, “Do you think you have leamed the truth because you found her? Do you think you can comfort me?”

Ding Yumian pointed at the Soul of Kindness and said, “When people are alive, they are used to presenting their fake sides to everyone. The truth is, my heart was already full of hatred for a long time. Otherwise, why is she only a spirit, while I became an Undead?”

Ding Yumian was mocking their ignorance.

The Soul of Kindness and Soul of Vengeance. Ding Yumian’s kindness was only a disguise! The truth was, she had long accumulated anger and hatred in her heart, which had turned her into an Undead. Her death had provided her with the conditions she needed!

How could she never think of opposing the detestable and filthy humans after being abandoned, hunted, and trapped in the Pearl Institute for so many years?

She was not trying to avenge her death. She did not have the thoughts to destroy the city and everything with it after she turned into an Undead!

Dean Xiao was too naive if he thought he could stop her revenge so easily.

“You are in control, so you can say whatever you want.” Mo Fan did not agree with Ding Yumian’s Soul of Vengeance.

It did not matter if a person was only acting kind as a disguise. If she managed to suppress her hatred and anger when she was still alive, she was already a kind person!

Everyone would have some degree of hatred in their hearts. However, they were still innocent before they took any action.

They could not accuse someone of being a murderer because they had an urge to kill another person in a heated argument. Only those who put the thought into action were truly guilty!

Even if Ding Yumian was faking her kindness, she had done good things for the people around her, including her willingness to take Zhuang Yue and Dean Lee’s advice to sacrifice herself for the city. It meant she was not controlled by her hatred.

If she had truly wanted to destroy the city, she would not have killed herself on the island. She would have done it in the city and killed everyone in it, too! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I like these flowers, the Pearl Institute, and the magic city. I wouldn’t mind accepting my death if the whole city could be buried with me!” Ding Yumian looked at the other side of the river and smiled.

“There are at least two Forbidden Curse Mages on that side. You will perish as soon as you cross the river,” Mo Fan warned her.

Ding Yumian’s expression turned sinister as soon as she heard his words.

Cough cough! “Mo Fan, we are here to resolve the conflict, not to make it worse. Don’t you agree?” Ding Yumian turned to the Soul of Kindness.

The Soul of Kindness immediately nodded. She stood behind the Undead woman, but she was not emitting the same aura.

However, it seemed like the Soul of Vengeance wanted to swallow the Soul of Kindness and make herself whole. Without the Soul of Kindness, she could not have turned the sea monsters that had died earlier in the war into her soldiers.

Professor Shi rolled his eyes at Mo Fan, too.

Mo Fan was supposed to be the mediator, not pour more oil on the fire!
