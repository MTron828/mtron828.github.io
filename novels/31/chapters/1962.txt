Chapter 1963: Flirting

Translated by XephiZ

No wonder so many people admired the knights of the Parthenon Temple. It was not so obvious when they were at the Parthenon Temple, but when they went somewhere else, they looked completely different from the ordinary people, as if they had come from the heavens.

If the knights were already so outstanding, the Servants and Muses whom the knights escorted were basically like angels. Mo Fan could not help but reevaluate his impression of Muse Pelina, who was walking up the stairs leading to the Palace while holding her skirt in one hand.

“Mo Fan, I finally know why people keep looking down at us. We look no different from street thugs. We aren’t giving people a good first impression! We don’t have a bunch of well-trained lackeys in bright outfits beside us to set off our brilliance. Everything needs something to set off their brilliance through comparison. We should start gathering our followers so we can attract attention wherever we go,” Zhao Manyan observed while fondling his chin.

Mo Fan strongly agreed. They were used to being free and going places on their own. No one really treated them seriously.

Meanwhile, the Muse of the Parthenon Temple was accompanied by her own knights and a Priest! She would stand out even if her looks were ordinary.

Mo Fan glanced at his phone and saw a message from Lingling. “Lingling told us to wait for them at the plaza.”

“We can examine the problem with our appearance while waiting for them!” Zhao Manyan believed it was a priority they needed to address.

There were many tourists at the plaza, chattering among themselves. A few knowledgeable ones realized the knights were from the Parthenon Temple.

“They are knights from the Parthenon Temple, no wonder they look so noble!”

“Perhaps some authority has just gone up the mountain. I saw a woman just now.”

“Maybe she is the person they are escorting!” The Hunters were discussing things right beside Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan. They immediately stared after Pelina, who was fading into the distance.

“There are Silver Moon Knights. She must be at least a Muse!”

“Silver Moon Knights... are they strong?”

“Our Hunter Group wouldn’t be able to defeat a single Silver Moon Knight,” an old Hunter with a beard declared firmly.

There were fewer clouds in the mountains, and the sky looked oddly blue as a result. It was as bright as a sapphire. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were bored of waiting. They went from examining the problem with their appearances to flirting with the female tourists on the plaza.

It was easy to tell the difference between locals and tourists in Lhasa at a glance. The people could easily tell Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were different from the members of the Parthenon Temple. They soon blended into the group of tourists.

“We just came here. We aren’t sure where to go yet, so we came to visit the Potala Palace first. However, it seems like something happened recently, as they are not letting visitors go inside. What a letdown,” a lady with short hair complained.

“You just graduated?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Yeah, this is our graduation trip. How about you two?” another cheerful girl who had tied her hair up asked.

“What a coincidence, we are here for our graduation trip too,” Mo Fan said.

“Ah? such a coincidence indeed. Which school are you from?” the short-haired girl asked.

“We are from Pearl Institute.”

“Pearl Institute? That’s a famous school!”

“It’s alright.”

“Speaking of which, you remind me of someone.”

“Are you referring to the winner of the World College Tournament, Mo Fan?”

“Yeah, you two are so alike.”

“Many people told me the same thing. I’m quite frustrated actually. I’m stuck under his brilliance,” Mo Fan said with a wry smile.

“Aren’t your boyfriends worried about you? You’ve come so far for your trip,” Zhao Manyan asked. It was one of his little tricks.

As he thought, the girls giggled embarrassedly and said, “We don’t have a boyfriend, except for her, but we don’t really like her boyfriend, including her.”

Zhao Manyan nodded. He glanced at the girl who had a boyfriend and noticed she was the fairest, most mature, and the best-looking among the girls. To Zhao Manyan’s surprise, Mo Fan had long set his eyes on her. The girl was already laughing after being teased by him.

Zhao Manyan twisted his lips. Mo Fan was no longer adhering to his bounds. He was already quicker at making his moves!

Since Mo Fan had already selected his prey, the rest of the girls were all his. It had been a while since he last had a 4P.

Zhao Manyan always followed a certain routine when picking up chicks. However, as he was planning to have a deeper conversation with the girls, he noticed a few familiar figures approaching them.

“Mo Fan, Lingling and the others are here,” Zhao Manyan warned Mo Fan.

“Got it,” Mo Fan did not treat it seriously. He had already learned where the girl was staying. He just needed to get the girl’s room number. “Oh, don’t you misunderstand, she’s my little sister. Where was I? Oh, if a man keeps suspecting what you are up to all the time, he is obviously insecure and lacks confidence. It’s tiring to have a relationship with someone like him, so you’ve made a smart choice by coming to Lhasa even though he was against the idea. You will enjoy yourself more here...”

“You sound quite experienced?” the girl giggled.

“A little...” Mo Fan chuckled.

“Mo Fan, Lingling and the others are here,” Zhao Manyan warned him again.

“Oh, Lingling, you and Jiang Shaoxu should head to the Hunter Union to collect some information first...” Mo Fan finally turned around to make Lingling leave.

Collecting information had always been Lingling’s job. Even though Tianshan Mountain was located in Xinjiang, Lhasa was still the place where the most information in the Western Regions was gathered.

Mo Fan’s smile froze as soon as he noticed a gorgeous, pale-skinned woman standing beside Lingling.

“Let’s go collect some information,” Mu Ningxue was like her usual self. The icy aura around her prevented anyone from going closer to her.

—

They already planned this trip when Mo Fan was still at the Parthenon Temple. Only Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu would join them on the adventure.

To Mo Fan’s surprise, Mu Ningxue had come too!

Besides, judging from her tone, she had obviously seen Mo Fan flirting with the girl after they arrived at the plaza.

Mo Fan wondered if kneeling on a washboard would convince Mu Ningxue to forgive him. Either way, Mu Ningxue did not say a single word to Mo Fan that day. Their relationship had gone back to the first step.

Mo Fan was helpless. Not only did he fail to get the girl’s room number, even Mu Ningxue was not letting him into her room. He had no choice but to cultivate in the cold night by himself until the next day.
