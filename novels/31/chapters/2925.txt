The courtyard was planted with laurels, and the fragrance filled the air. It had been a long time since Tao Jing smelled the flowers. She hung around for a while enjoying the fragrance.

The sweet scent lifted her mood. Tao Jing then walked into the house.

She had grown accustomed to serving him lunch at this hour daily over the past one year. The man gave an impression of being lackadaisical. Who would have thought he was such a hard worker. In today’s hustle and bustle in the city, only a few young people could focus on their cultivation for a long period of time.

Tao Jing placed the tray by the side. She was about to take away the utensils from the day before when she realized that yesterday’s food was untouched.

‘Didn’t Mo Fan take his meal yesterday?’

Mo Fan ate his lunch every day. He did not eat anything else except his lunch. He basically finished all the food he had for his lunch regardless of the type of food served.

Tao Jing personally prepared the dishes. She had to prepare the dishes daily. Mo Fan was her savior. Hence, she prepared his portion with care. She felt happy whenever Mo Fan ate up all the food.

‘He hasn’t even opened the lunchbox cover. Does he not like the food? Or, has he gone off the rails in his cultivation?’ Tao Jing was worried about him.

He had been eating the lunch she served for the past year. However, today was an exception. Something must have happened. ‘What if Mo Fan had died inside?’

Tao Jing pushed open the door and entered the house. She noticed that the isolation formation inside the house was torn apart.

There was not even a bed inside the empty cultivation room. It had very little ventilation for air. It looked so simple, like a rich man’s prison. It was hard to believe one would have the perseverance to cultivate under such adversity in this era.

‘Where is he?’ Tao Jing was shocked.

She did not see Mo Fan. She even wanted to lift the mat on the floor to look for him.

Truth was, Tao Jing had not seen Mo Fan over the past one year. The only way to confirm that he was still alive was through the food he ate. When she didn’t find Mo Fan inside, she felt confused and disappointed.

It was as if the pig she had been feeding for over a year had run out from its pen in the middle of the night.

…

The seawater in the Magic City receded slowly. There were still many low-lying urban areas soaked underwater. The sewer ponds were connected to the city sewers. As a result, the area became frightening and smelly.

The Magic City underground fortress was built nearby the Rainbow Station. The Ocean Demons at ten kilometers radius from the station had been wiped out. Most of the Ocean Demons gathered at Pudong that was connected to the sea, followed by the two prosperous cities, Xu Hui and Jing An.

A few Mages went in and out of the broken steel door. They had been stationed in the Magic City underground fortress for a very long time. They knew the city’s current state very well.

“No matter what, we have to wipe out the White Ocean Demons in the campus area today,’ said a bearded man.

“Captain, there are only a few of us here. I think it will be a difficult task. How about we join forces with the Bronze Lion Hunter Group? We’ll agree to their 4-6 split. It’s much better than being wiped out,” said a potbellied Mage.

“Fatso, they want sixty percent from the reward, don’t you get it?!”

“Darn it! Why are they so greedy?! We have fought the White Ocean Demons for several months. The Lan Spider White Ocean Demon is the only one left that we can’t handle by ourselves. Do they have to demand such an exorbitant rate?!” the pot-bellied Mage cried out furiously.

“We won’t let them despise us even if it means losing our lives! After we take down the Ocean Demons in the campus area, we won’t let them ride on our coattails even if they wish to!”

“That’s right! The top management promised to promote the team, that can wipe out the Ocean Demons in the campus area, to generals. After we become generals, even people like the Bronze Lion Hunter Group will have to drop their money and their respect at our doorstep!” said the bearded man.

“Let’s depart now!”

“Let’s go now!”

The Summit Brigade were once hunters. They had worked as mercenaries overseas and served in the military for small countries. Thus, they had gained quite a name in the country.

After they returned to the country, they formed the Summit Brigade with the purpose to kill demons. They responded to their country’s call and stayed around in the Magic City to clear up the Ocean Demons’ nests. The city was both filled with danger and challenges. Likewise, lucrative rewards and bright futures awaited them.

The Summit Brigade skirted around the underground pond and arrived at Jing An efficiently.

The Pearl Institute was their destination. The Ocean Demons had occupied the campus area for a long period of time. Over the past one year, the White Ocean Demons had reproduced exponentially. The speed of reproduction increased after they obtained the land resources and source of energy from the cities.

Some of the Ocean Demon hordes turned the factories and enterprises into a scary nest within a few months’ time.

Furthermore, a large number of demons stayed around the Pudong area. The underground sewer in Shanghai was massive. The Ocean Demons roamed about the various parts in the city through the underground sewer. They continued to grow and form trap holes. If it had not been for the execution of the fortress plan that allowed humans to continue fighting the Ocean Demons, the number of Ocean Demons in the Magic City would grow and turn the city into an enormous Ocean Demon empire city.

The White Ocean Demons were the type that reproduced rapidly and were also very powerful. Over the last few months, the Summit Brigade fought them on a large-scale basis. They sent people to scout the area and finally targeted the Lan Spider White Ocean Demon. It was the key. It was like a queen in a beehive. It continued to lay eggs and reproduce rapidly. Meanwhile, the White Ocean Demons were like hard working bees. They plundered and collected energy to provide nourishment for their queen!

The fortress commander classified the White Ocean Demons as A-grade Ocean Demon group. It was difficult for the army to skirt around the black pond and enter the White Ocean Demon’s territory. They had to hand over the task to the civilian group.

Of course, the civilian group wasn’t made up of just anybody. The White Ocean Demons were very powerful. It was basically a suicidal mission for the less famous civilian groups in the country to take on the task. Even the non-elite army would get themselves killed if they fought the White Ocean Demons.

…

“What’s going on?!” The bearded captain cried out angrily. “You are the scouts. How the hell are you doing your job?! Why are the carcasses everywhere?!”

“W-we… We scouted this place yesterday. It’s impossible for this to happen. Could the Bronze Lion Hunter Group have gone ahead of us? This is way too much! How can they barge into the A-grade Ocean Demon group area without the fortress commander’s approval?! They cannot handle the issue in this way! They may trigger a riot by the Ocean Demon hordes!” said the pot-bellied Mage.

“Captain! Captain! There are many White Ocean Demons carcasses ahead of us! It looks like an expert is inside this area.” A scout came running to him.
