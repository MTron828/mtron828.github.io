“What do you mean? Are they saying we are the reason why the disasters happen and why the demon creatures are on a rampage?” Zhao Manyan scoffed.

“Yes, Mages are the root of the problem. Mages have been taking a lot of the limited natural resources. They have also killed and captured the younglings of the gods and the demons for their own benefit. They might have obtained a lot of power, but the common folks who never practice magic end up as the victims,” Harper went on.

Mo Fan was shocked. It was his first time hearing anything like this. “What kind of bullsh** is that?” he blurted out.

“It doesn’t matter if the idea is crap or not, many people actually believe it. They assume the Mages are the reason why the demon creatures are so hostile toward us. They also believe the ways of Mages are against the will of the gods, so the wars between humans and demon creatures have never stopped. Most importantly, the Black Church had a lot of believers in the past, and after the rise of the sea, more people have joined their campaign to protest against Mages!” Harper went on.

It was Mo Fan’s first time hearing such a ridiculous claim. Humans would have long become the demon creatures’ livestock if there were no Mages, yet there were people who opposed their existence and accused them of being the root of the problem!?

“Apparently, the Black Church’s origin is in America, but there are a lot of members in Europe, too,” Mu Bai said. “As a matter of fact, their members are in our homeland too, but they aren’t able to convince a lot of people to join them, so they aren’t well-known to the public.”

“Some countries have too much freedom, and their people have already mastered the art of being total assh****. They are the ones hiding behind the comfort of the walls because they are not Mages while wasting our resources, yet they are accusing Mages of being the culprits. What genius, these foreign countries have so many geniuses!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Mo Fan totally agreed with Zhao Manyan. Certain people thought their ridiculous ideas were right because of some petty support.

Leaving aside whether the ancient gods actually protected humans or not, it could not alter the fact that their offspring had turned into the biggest threats to mankind. The demon creatures had originated from the ancient gods. Perhaps they had also inherited their bloodthirsty and savage nature from the ancient gods! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The Tyrant Titans must be the most symbolic demons from ancient times. Does that mean the reason why some strangers spat in our food is because we have provoked the ancient gods, so they destroyed Green Sprouts City as a warning?” Mo Fan theorized.

“Something like that. It’s obvious that the Black Church will use the opportunity to proclaim their faith after such a terrifying incident,” Harper nodded.

“Why are you so familiar with them? Didn’t you only survive the incident?” Mu Bai asked sharply.

Harper pointed at a table with a photo on it. It was of a woman in her forties. She was wearing the same crimson outfit as the strangers they had bumped into at the restaurant.

“My grandmother was a loyal follower of the Black Church. She kept telling me that Mages are the root of evil in this world, but no matter what she said, I’m still envious of them. I love the feeling of being above nature, but I didn’t even make it into high school,” Harper explained.

“Considering the number of people in this world, there are going to be some retards. When these retards who appreciate one another gather together, they might stir up a little trouble, but it doesn’t really bother us. Just let them be. Shouldn’t you tell us more about the Tyrant Titan? We are trying to find the culprit that destroyed Green Sprouts City!” Mo Fan waved it off.

The Parthenon Temple did not mention it clearly, but Mo Fan knew his competition with Tuis would most likely depend on who could find the culprit first.

The Tyrant Titan had destroyed an island and made the whole of Greece to feel uneasy. Fear had spread throughout the Aegean Sea. If they did not kill the culprit in time, there would be serious consequences.

“To be honest, I thought I was dead for sure when it happened. I only saw its back because I was blinded by the light it was reflecting. I couldn’t even tell if it’s a Blue Star Tyrant Titan or a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan. I can only remember that it had a scorched mark in the shape of a cross on its back. It was burning like lava,” Harper said.

“Every Tyrant Titan has different markings. They are unique, like our fingerprints. It seems we have found our target!” Mu Bai smiled.

“You sound like you have done a lot of homework,” Zhao Manyan teased him.

“I told you I’m here to be your brain,” Mu Bai replied blandly.

“A cross on its back. Mm, there are so many Tyrant Titans in the mountains, forests, abyss, and oceans... I wonder which kind it is,” Mo Fan muttered.

Each of the Tyrant Titans stayed in one kind of environment. The mountains and forests would have the Tyrant Titans’ footprints and other clues, but it would be too difficult to search for Tyrant Titans in the oceans and abyss. If it did not show itself again, they would have no chance of finding it, even if they sent out all Senior Hunters in the world.

“It’s from the ocean,” Harper said confidently.

“How do you know?” asked Mo Fan.

“My grandmother worshipped the Tyrant Titans... don’t look at me like that, the members of the Black Church each worship an ancient god. Oh, I heard those in China worship something like the Totem Beasts. My grandmother kept telling me about the Tyrant Titans, so I’m familiar with them, at least better than those so-called experts. The Tyrant Titan that attacked us is from the ocean, and lives around ten thousand meters deep,” Harper said confidently.

“If it’s from the ocean, we won’t be able to find it even if we try for the rest of our life,” Zhao Manyan said with a wry smile.

“Don’t act like you can do anything to it even if you found it. The government can’t do anything about it, even if they sent an army after it, let alone you three. I’ve told you everything you want. You can stay here or leave. I’m going to rest for a month or two until it’s summer...” Harper said.

Zhao Manyan looked around and said, “Let’s stay here for the night. Mo Fan, I think there is a lot of information about Tyrant Titans here too.”

“Sure, it has great scenery,” Mo Fan nodded.

“I can give you a thirty percent discount, so it’s seven hundred for a person every night,” Harper said while lying back on the hay.

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai’s eyes widened.

“Screw you, we saved your life!”

“I already thanked you by giving you the information you want. How can you not pay if you want to stay here? I need to save up before summer! Otherwise, how can I pretend to be a rich young lad so I can hook up with those lonely women who come to the Aegean Sea? It’s the only reason I stay on this island!”
