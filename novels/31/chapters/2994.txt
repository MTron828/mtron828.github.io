2995 Zhao Manyan’s Lies

Bai Miaoying eagerness was still too much to handle after a while. Perhaps, it was because she had suppressed her emotions for a very long time. She wanted to burst out in tears, but her eyes were so dry that she felt pain.

“Let’s go in and talk,” said Bai Miaoying to Zhao Manyan as she tried to calm herself.

“It’s okay. Let’s chat here. I know what you’re worried about,” said Zhao Manyan.

“Let me take a good look at you.” Bai Miaoying looked at Zhao Manyan. She reached out to touch his face.

Zhao Manyan was no longer as fair as he was, and his skin was not as soft and supple anymore. He had been maintaining his good looks for a very long time. He had dyed his hair a vibrant color. It made him look pompous and overly fashionable.

Today, the outline of his face seemed to show his character. He looked more regal and bold. He used to have a pair of innocent-looking eyes, but at that moment, they looked deep and full of complicated emotions. Even though he looked as frivolous as before, Bai Miaoying noticed this was just his outer appearance, a state of mind that he had been maintaining for a very long time.

He had gone through a lot. He had changed a lot. He had experienced sadness and torment. Still, he had not lost himself. He had grown into himself. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Perhaps, he had become more mature. But Bai Miaoying believed Zhao Manyan was more than just a mature man.

“You look more like your father now.” Bai Miaoying let go of his face. She looked relieved.

“Maybe.” Zhao Manyan tried to recall his father’s face.

“You and your brothers are very different in terms of your personalities. Youqian obeyed your father since he was young. He did everything according to your father’s orders. He seldom went against him. After he grew up, he wanted to take over the family business. As for you, you don’t really show any interest in the family business. You did the opposite of what your father told you. But now, Youqian has changed. And you, you grew up to be like your father.” Bai Miaoying sighed.

Zhao Manyan did not say anything. He sat by her side and listened attentively to her.

Bai Miaoying could talk endlessly. Back then, she often nagged Zhao Manyan. He played games while listening to her nagging. In fact, he did not really pay attention to her words.

This time, it was surprising to see Zhao Manyan sitting there quietly and listening to his mother. He listened attentively to every word she spoke.

In the past, he would become impatient. But at that moment, he found that he enjoyed listening to her talk endlessly.

“There’s something I have to tell you.” Bai Miaoying’s face changed. She looked bitter.

“What is it?”

“Your father could have lived longer, but Youqian…” Bai Miaoying felt as if something was stuck in her chest.

She had no intention of telling Zhao Manyan about it. She had just gotten him back. However, considering her younger son’s safety as well as Zhao Youqian’s change of character over the years, she had to warn Zhao Manyan to be wary of his older brother.

Now that Zhao Manyan was alive, the family succession, that had been dragged out for a very long time, would fall into his hands. She could not guarantee that Zhao Youqian would not do something reckless.

Bai Miaoying told her younger son about what she had learnt from the old caregiver. Zhao Youqian was the one who had unplugged his father’s medical equipment so that his father passed away earlier.

“Mother, how can you simply listen to the old caregiver’s words? No matter how much of a scum Zhao Youqian is, he would never use Father’s life as a bargaining chip for the family competition. Don’t be absurd, Mother.” Zhao Manyan refused to believe it.

“Youqian has been lost these years. I feel that I no longer know him anymore. He loses control of his emotions. Xiao Manman, even though he’s your older brother, we’re a large family, and there are many things that cannot be maintained solely through family relationships. No matter what, you must be careful!” Bai Miaoying trusted the old caregiver.

“There’s something I haven’t told you,” said Zhao Manyan. “I was inside the ward when my father passed away.” Zhao Manyan told Bai Miaoying part of the story when he had sneaked into the ward.

Zhao Manyan only told her the part that his mother would be able to accept and be at peace. He didn’t tell her about his brother giving the orders to unplug the medical equipment.

“Is it true?” Bai Miaoying cried out in shock.

Zhao Manyan spoke in detail. Bai Miaoying wanted to believe him, but she was still worried.

“Of course, it’s true. The Black Vatican laid their eyes on me. I didn’t show up all this while because I don’t want to get you into trouble. Mother, don’t worry. Youqian is not as bad as you think. Perhaps, the people from other clans deliberately wanted to crush us after knowing about such a big change in our family. So, they simply made up stories,” said Zhao Manyan.

“T-That’s great! I almost believed them! Do you know how sad I was when I heard it? I even felt like killing myself. Our family was doing fine. I was shocked to see it turn into something like this.” Bai Miaoying’s tears streamed down her face.

She heaved a long, relieved sigh.

After learning the “truth” from Zhao Manyan, Bai Miaoying felt as if she had finally gotten rid of the despair and pain. The air was fresher, even the night in Venice looked more breathtaking.

Bai Miaoying could not quite accept the fact of Zhao Manyan’s death. She knew he was terribly sick, and she knew he wouldn’t have survived for long. His illness had triggered internal strife in the family. As a result, Bai Miaoying was so dejected that she did not even have the courage to live on.

Finally, Bai Miaoying could rest assured that both of her sons were well and good!

“Stop thinking about unnecessary stuff. Take good care of your health. Eat well. Who knows, maybe you will live long enough to see your own grandchildren in a couple of years. By then, we may need your help to take care of the children. If you aren’t here, I don’t want to have a child,” said Zhao Manyan with a warm smile.

Bai Miaoying slapped Zhao Manyan’s head playfully. “Don’t simply spew nonsense! You must have at least seven or eight children and contribute to growing our family. Otherwise, you will be sorry for the young girls you’ve flirted with!”
