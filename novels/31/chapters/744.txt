Zhao Manyan felt something surging inside his chest when he saw how Mo Fan desperately tried to protect the boy when he was being attacked by the Scarlet Rending Demon.

The truth was, he wanted to stay, to fight the Scarlet Rending Demon together with Mo Fan, like true men!

No one would back off just because the enemy was strong. It was the unyielding spirit that a man should have!

Luckily, the reef was not too far away from the safe zone. It was likely that the Scarlet Rending Demon was only resting there to recover from its injuries, so it could seek revenge when the time came.

The Scarlet Rending Demon must be in bad shape since the Sea Monkey had appeared in human territory without being stealthy, and forcibly stole an infant from its mother.

Zhao Manyan used his clothes to wrap around the fragile kid while flying in the sky. He would look at the kid every now and then, as he was afraid that the kid would die suddenly. He was only one year old! Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan always thought themselves to be cold-blooded, they could not care less if someone died, yet they had a hard time staying calm when the life of a child was at stake!

“Little guy, hang in there, we’re almost there...” said Zhao Manyan to the babe whose nose was still bleeding.

—

Finally, when the safe zone was right ahead, Zhao Manyan quickened his pace and flew straight toward Feiniao City.

“Nan Rongni, where are you? Where is Nan Rongni? Tell me now!” Zhao Manyan yelled at the communication device as soon as it regained signal.

“I’m at the port,” blurted out Nan Rongni when she heard Zhao Manyan’s panicking voice.

“Send me a signal, I’ll be there in two minutes. Prepare to save someone, it’s the kid Xiao Di who was kidnapped. He’s suffering from concussion, his life is in danger!” said Zhao Manyan.

“Did you two manage to find him?”

“Yes!”

—

The team had immediately made their way to the port when they received news about the kid from Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan descended from the sky and landed right in front of Nan Rongni. Jiang Shaoxu realized that a crowd had started to gather around them, thus she quickly used Spirit Wall to keep the gawkers away, and to stop them from disturbing Nan Rongni as she treated the kid.

The little boy was in serious condition, judging from Zhao Manyan’s tone!

Nan Rongni and Jiang Shaoxu took off their jackets and placed them on the ground as a temporary cushion. Zhao Manyan slowly placed the infant on the jackets. However, the kid’s face had already turned from pale to blue. Viscous liquid kept on flowing out of his tiny nose, it was heart-aching just to look at him!

“He’s injured on the inside, the Healing Spirit won’t work...” Nan Rongni frowned when she learned the infant’s condition.

It was likely that the kid’s inner organs were damaged. The Healing Spirit was more efficient at treating external injuries or damage to bones. The Basic and Intermediate Healing Spells were not as efficient when treating an internal injury.

Nan Rongni placed her hand on Xiao Di’s chest and slowly moved it around. She had to find out what was injured before treating it.

Jiang Shaoxu was no longer smiling under the current circumstances.

Even though she was not a Healer, she was familiar with its principles. The Healing Element was actually boosting the target’s recovery speed, which meant that the Healing Element worked better when the target had great recovery ability.

Xiao Di was only a child. He did not even have strong immunity against diseases. His ability to recover was definitely the weakest at his age. Even a talented Healer like Nan Rongni was helpless, unless she was an Advanced Magician.

There were only a few Advanced Healers, even in the biggest cities. There was no way they could find one in Feiniao City. Nan Rongni was their only hope to save Xiao Di’s life.

Nan Rongni’s hand suddenly stopped close to Xiao Di’s lungs. When she found where the injury was, she quickly took off a round pendant she was wearing on her neck and placed it close to Xiao Di’s lungs!

The little pendant emitted a gentle glow that gathered above the infant’s lungs. Drops of liquid came out from the pendant and permeated in the infant’s body through his skin...

Nan Rongni closed her eyes and used her senses to treat the wound in Xiao Di’s lungs. The process demanded great focus, like a surgeon operating on a patient. Which part needed the healing liquid, which blood vessels must be unblocked, which part had bled that had to be cleared at once...

“What happened? What’s going on? Didn’t we ask you to save the kid, how did he end up like this...”

Zhao Manyan’s heart was burning with anxiety when an annoying voice spoke up. Zhao Manyan immediately knew the unpleasant voice belonged to Gong Yu without turning around!

Zhao Manyan was pissed. That son of a bitch was still saying unpleasant words under the circumstances. Did he think that his smart remarks were more important than saving the kid’s life? He and Mo Fan had risked their lives to save the kid from the Scarlet Rending Demon, yet he still had to hear Gong Yu’s nonsense!

“Can you piss off, Gong Yu?” Zhao Manyan had no intention to show the idiot any respect. He cursed without mercy.

“You’re asking me to piss off? A mere substitute who only managed to secure the position with money dares to ask me to piss off?” Gong Yu was infuriated.

“Enough, Nan Rongni needs to focus!” Jiang Shaoxu glared at the two.

Zhao Manyan immediately withheld his anger, yet Gong Yu was obviously trying to pick a fight still.

“What happened?” Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, Mu Ningxue, Li Kaifeng and the others asked after they arrived and saw Nan Rongni healing the boy.

“We stumbled into the Scarlet Rending Demon; the creature wanted to eat infants, so the Sea Monkey went and kidnapped Xiao Di. We intercepted the Sea Monkey at a reef island, yet as soon as Mo Fan recovered Xiao Di, he was immediately ambushed by the Scarlet Rending Demon...” said Zhao Manyan.

“Scarlet Rending Demon... you two stumbled into the creature?” Nanyu was astounded.

Among them, apart from Ai Jiangtu, who still stood a chance against the Scarlet Rending Demon, most people would most likely die if they fought the creature!

And now, according to Zhao Manyan’s description, Mo Fan was ambushed by the Scarlet Rending Demon! It was fortunate that the kid was still alive after what happened!

“How about Mo Fan, is he alright?” asked Mu Ningxue.

Anyone else in the team would die instantly after being ambushed by a Commander-level creature. Mu Ningxue began to panic when she realized that only Zhao Manyan had returned.

“Mo Fan was severely injured trying to protect the little kid. He asked me to bring the dying kid back,” said Zhao Manyan.

“You’re telling me that Mo Fan is there all by himself?”

“My God, he’s going to die for sure! That’s a Commander-level creature!” exclaimed Jiang Shaoxu.

“Quick, go help him!” said Nanyu.

“Humph, I bet we can only retrieve his corpse by the time we reach there,” murmured Gong Yu.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
