Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan landed heavily on the deck, almost breaking holes in the deck’s floor.

Nanyu immediately criticized the two, yet they ignored her and went over to the railing and stared into the water.

The sea water was very clear, allowing them to see quite deep into it. The black shadow was still under the ship. They finally realized how enormous the thing was when they were back on the ship. It felt like the whole ship had entered a black area. A great terror filled their hearts when they saw the black shadow extending into the distance!

“Holy shit, what the heck is that!?” screamed Jiang Yu.

His scream immediately attracted everyone’s attention. They quickly gathered at the railings and discovered an enormous shadow in the water. It looked like a huge abyss that could suck the whole ship into it at any second!

Cold sweat slid down their necks. Even though they did not sense any aura from the thing in the water, they still felt a great pressure, as if their lives were completely under its control!

No one was talking. Their eyes widened as their bodies stiffened.

None of them dared to take a closer look at the thing in the water, as they were worried that it would turn out to be a giant mouth devouring them or an enormous claw smashing their ship into pieces. It was not mere imagination; they strongly believed the creature in the water could do it!

“What...what the hell is that thing?” asked Zhao Manyan, his face stiff.

Mo Fan took a deep breath and slowly shook his head, “It looks like it’s diving deeper into the water.”

The shadow in the water gradually blurred. The fear looming in everyone’s heart slowly dissipated. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Sometime later, the water finally returned to normal. Glancing into the distance, it was the same dark blue everywhere.

However, for some reason, whenever they looked at the sea water or tried to look deeper into it, the fear would return out of nowhere. They could not stop thinking about the giant shadow!

On the ship, everyone was exhausted from tension. Jiang Yu even collapsed on the deck!

The ship continued to move forward, yet the people aboard remained silent for a long time. Sometime later, Jiang Yu finally rose to his feet and glanced at the people around him.

“For some reason, I suddenly felt like a frog at the bottom of a well,” said Jiang Yu.

There were too many things that were still unexplored in this world. Jiang Yu thought he had learned about most of the demon creatures, and he could easily identify their kind just by looking at their shadows.

However, he had no clue what the shadow was. He could not even see its whole appearance...

He did not know what the creature was, apart from the fact that it was not recorded, and it was right here in the Yellow Sea!

“I’m afraid it’s one of the reasons the advisors sent us here for training, but... a creature of that size, it’s at least... at least Ruler-level, right?” asked Nanyu.

“It’s hard to say; we don’t even know if it’s a living creature. Strange, a Ruler-level creature should have a strong presence, yet I didn’t feel anything from it,” said Mo Fan.

Gong Yu sneered at Mo Fan’s words and said disdainfully, “You’re talking as if you’ve seen a Ruler-level creature before. Based on what I know, it’s easy for a Ruler-level creature to conceal its presence.”

Gong Yu was simply asking to be humiliated. Not only had Mo Fan seen a Ruler-level creature, he had even fought more than one before.

For example, the Black Totem Snake in Hangzhou was just like his guardian beast. If Mo Fan poked his finger in Hangzhou’s territory, the creature would immediately show up and tear at the thistle. Judging from the fight between the Black Totem Snake and the Silver Skyruler, the Black Totem Snake was one of the strongest at the Ruler-level.

Leaving the Black Totem Snake aside, it time to talk about the Mountain Zombie...

The Mountain Zombie was the leader of the eight Ruler-level creatures of the Ancient Capital, yet didn’t Mo Fan still beat the crap out of it?

Of course Mo Fan knew what Ruler-level creatures were! The shadow in the water was incredibly huge, thus it was reasonable to describe it as a Ruler-level creature, yet Mo Fan was confused by its living presence...

“Either way, it’s gone now. I almost shit my pants!” said Zhao Manyan.

Mo Fan nodded. Regardless of what it was, it had indeed disappeared. It did not show any hint of hostility to them, yet the terrifying encounter served as a great lesson to Mo Fan and the others. The vast world was full of unknown things, and they could not help but wonder how many enormous and powerful life forms and unknown places were yet to be discovered...

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan had already seen the shoreline when they were flying. After the team had their frightening experience, the ship somehow sailed slightly off course, so it took longer to reach the harbor.

Since the ship was already registered and even had its name written in Japanese, it successfully entered Japan’s maritime space.

They immediately saw some fishing boats after entering the safe zone. There were two types; one was modern fishing vessels that relied on machinery to catch thousands of fish and deliver them into a freezer. The other kind was the primitive boats that each had one or two fishermen and some simple tools. There were lots of similar fishing boats back at Feiniao City.

Japan had primitive fishing boats too, yet the majority of them were the modern ones. The place was well known for its seafood, so the fishing industry was quite developed.

The area inside the safe zone was full of fishing boats. The boats were mostly painted gray, so the white ship from China was fairly eye-catching when it entered the area.

After the team arrived at the port and stepped onto land, Mo Fan immediately felt relieved.

For some reason, he did not feel safe at sea. Their recent encounter with the unknown creature proved that the sea was extremely dangerous. He had almost wet his pants. Also, the land did not shake continuously, unlike the ocean, and it was easier to identify directions!

As they were on the ship for too long, they were all walking as if they were drunk.

“Does anyone know how to speak Japanese?” Mo Fan soon asked.

“I do, I like to watch Japanese dramas,” Jiang Shaoxu smiled.

“Oh, me too,” said Mo Fan.

Jiang Shaoxu was not a naive girl either. She immediately rolled her eyes and snapped when she saw Mo Fan’s evil grin, “Pervert!”

Mo Fan rubbed his nose. What was wrong with liking Detective Conan?
