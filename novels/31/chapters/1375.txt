Chapter 1377 The Great Pyramid of Giza

The night suddenly fell silent. The weather was not cold, yet it felt like they were all standing in ice.

The four people inside the room had stopped breathing. Their pupils were hollow, as if they were stuck in a nightmare.

They had completely lost their ability to think under the feeling of suffocation and mental impact that conclusion had brought them!

The Underworld Monarch Frog was pulling the Great Pyramid of Giza...

The Great Pyramid of Giza!

It was the huge kingdom of undead that could easily devour half of Egypt, the most magnificent of the Underworld Palaces. If the pyramid appeared in their land, what would happen to Beijiang once the pyramid started covering the land with its deathlight!?

“I don’t think we are only having a nightmare...” someone finally spoke in the silent room. Ye Hong was the first to break the silence, “A nightmare is normally something bad that a person was imagining during the day, but I’ve never, ever, imagined anything like this! I would never think such a thing!”

The discovery completely exceeded Ye Hong’s understanding of how terrible a situation could be. Only the cruelest truth would continue to throw punches at them when they could not even endure them!

Similarly, as a Super Mage and the commander of almost ten thousand elite Mages of the Northguard Fortress, Bin Wei felt so tiny after hearing that conclusion. A single gust of undead that the Great Pyramid of Giza stirred up could easily tear a Super Mage like her to pieces!

The Underworld Monarch Frog...

The Northguard Fortress had used everything they had to barely stop the invasion of a single Underworld Monarch Frog. They were even so proud of their achievement. Little did they know, the Underworld Monarch Frog was nothing but an insignificant slave with the appearance of a frog before the Great Pyramid of Giza!

“What... what should we do?” Zhao Manyan asked after staring at the others for some time.

What could they possibly do? Bin Wei did not know, nor did Ye Hong. It felt like there was nothing they could do, apart from being trampled entirely!

Lingling suddenly recovered from her dispirited state and said, “We have to look for Mo Fan!”

“Right, look for Mo Fan, he must have some way...” Zhao Manyan said.

Lingling shook her head and said, “Find Mo Fan, tell him the truth, and we’ll leave this place at once.”

Zhao Manyan was startled. He did not expect those words from Lingling.

On second thought, her decision was clearly the most rational choice! What could they possibly do against the Great Pyramid of Giza, apart from getting themselves killed?

Since the stars were constantly moving, and the Great Pyramid of Giza was temporarily moved here by the Triangle Dimensional Mirror, it would only last for a few days. Their only chance was to evacuate the land. They were going to die for sure if they tried to resist...

“Alright, I’ll go look for Mo Fan now... damn it, I don’t even know where he is, he didn’t bring the badge of the national team with him,” Zhao Manyan cursed in a panic.

“I think I know where Brother Fan is,” a voice entered the room.

The group turned around and saw a skinny but energetic young man in the uniform of a general walking in.

His expression alone had indicated that he had heard everything too, but he had been standing at the entrance, struggling to collect his thoughts.

“Zhang Xiaohou!” Zhao Manyan was overjoyed.

He had shown up just in time. It would be a lot easier for them to look for Mo Fan with his help. They could not afford to give up on Mo Fan. He was trying so hard to stop the Black Vatican, but it turned out all their efforts were in vain. Beijiang’s fate was now in the hands of the Heavens, but they would not allow Mo Fan to die. They had to find him at all costs. They had to stop him from going any further and leave this place at once!

“Lingling, is it true?” Zhang Xiaohou looked at Lingling with a helpless wry smile.

“It’s just my speculation. I didn’t have any proof, and I know it’s not enough to convince the government, the military, and the Magic Association, but trust me, it’s the truth. It will happen. It’s useless to do or say anything now. We have to find Mo Fan and leave at once!” Lingling had never reacted like this. She might sound calm, but her heart was clearly on the verge of collapsing.

The room fell silent again. The last glimpse of hope in Zhang Xiaohou’s eyes disappeared.

General Bin Wei and Commander Ye Hong stared at one another in silence.

Zhao Manyan looked at them and snapped, “What are you two waiting for? Hurry up and tell everyone to evacuate the fortress! You are all Mages, there’s still time if you start running now. It’s too late once the Underworld Monarch Frogs move the Great Pyramid of Giza here!”

“We have sworn an oath to protect the Northguard Fortress!” Commander Ye Hong said.

“How the hell could you possibly protect it? The fortress has already ended up like this when we were only up against an Underworld Monarch Frog. Do you have any idea how terrifying the undead in Egypt are? I was there when they were fighting a mirage. The undead in the outer area of a pyramid were already troublesome to deal with, due to their insane numbers. The Northguard Fortress wouldn’t stand a chance against even a small pyramid, let alone the Great Pyramid of Giza. Any entity in the Great Pyramid of Giza could easily raze this Northguard Fortress to the ground!” Zhao Manyan swore.

The Northguard Fortress was nothing but a little wooden fence to the Great Pyramid of Giza. It could not even withstand the force of a wild beast crashing into it, not to mention the whole tide of wild beasts was coming. Why would they even bother staying? Were they really going to let thousands of people die just to buy a few minutes?

“Hunters may leave, the businessmen and magic students may leave, the civilians may leave, but how can we soldiers abandon our posts?” Commander Ye Hong said.

“Unless we receive the order to retreat from our superiors,” General Bin Wei said.

“Your superiors? Are you out of your mind? Your superiors even dispatched the best troop you have elsewhere when you were under attack by the Underworld Monarch Frog! I would be damned if they believed the speculation of a little girl around the age of ten. Why do you think Mo Fan has taken so many risks just to infiltrate the Black Vatican? Isn’t it obvious that he’s trying to collect evidence? But does it even matter? Did the authorities even say a word?” Zhao Manyan was on the verge of losing his temper.

What the heck was happening in their country? Could the problem in the East be more serious than what they were facing now!?

“I’ll try and convince our superiors, but we won’t be able to leave without an order to retreat,” Bin Wei replied. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I’ll ask the people that aren’t from the military to evacuate at once,” Ye Hong said. Ye Hong believed in Lingling’s speculation. Everything that happened so far was enough proof that the worst had yet to come!

“My Heavens, I don’t even care anymore. Lingling, Zhang Xiaohou, let’s go. We have to find Mo Fan as soon as possible!” Zhao Manyan believed they were completely out of their minds.

To hell with the duty of a soldier; if they chose to wait for their deaths just because it was an order, instead of sizing up the situation when necessary, what would they even need living humans for? Why didn’t they just join the army of undead that was already on their way!?
