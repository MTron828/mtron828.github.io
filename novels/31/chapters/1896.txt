Zhang Xiaohou brought Mo Fan to the shore after breaking out of the surrounding Viscera Hunters. The shore was now submerged in deep water, as the tide had risen because of the Magical Sea Beasts. There were not many good spots to set their feet on nearby.

Zhang Xiaohou looked around him and realized there was not a single place for Mo Fan to stand on. He cast a Wind Spell that Mo Fan had never seen before.

“Wind Wheel!”

Two Wind Wheels formed under Mo Fan’s feet. They could support him easily, as if Mo Fan had put on a pair of shoes that were able to hover in the air while maintaining his balance. He was able to walk in the air now!

Most Wind Mages could only use the spell on themselves, and it was rare to see anyone able to cast it on someone else like Zhang Xiaohou just did. It was likely that the man had never stopped training diligently since they last met. He had also had his own special encounters, which had provided him with great benefits.

“Hehe, it was the Fruit of the Vow. Not only did my Wind Element improve significantly after consuming it, I also learned some unexpected skills! The spell that I Cast to bring you out of there and the Wind Wheels are from my Feathers of the Wind Spirits. I only discovered that I could Cast them on someone else recently. Brother Fan, you should be able to familiarize yourself with the Wind Wheels after some practice.” Zhang Xiaohou had indeed been Mo Fan’s friend for a very long time. He knew exactly what Mo Fan was thinking!

“These Wind Wheels are perfect for me,” Mo Fan nodded. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The tide had risen in the bay. There had been some abandoned tires and broken trees floating around before, but there was nothing but water now. It was a troublesome sight for Mo Fan.

“Brother Fan, I rarely see you injured like this. However, I did notice that the sea monsters are a lot stronger than the demon creatures on the land. I almost messed up when I first encountered them!” Zhang Xiaohou sighed.

“Some of my Elements are greatly hindered by the environment... Houzi, do you see those circles of bony scum in the bay?” Mo Fan stood in the air with the help of Zhang Xiaohou’s Wind Wheels and pointed at a nearby area.

Zhang Xiaohou followed Mo Fan’s gaze and noticed the area Mo Fan was referring to was already submerged in fierce waves. The waves had reached ten to twenty meters high, like moving mountains.

Zhang Xiaohou saw the creatures Mo Fan had mentioned between the waves. They were a group of Viscera Hunters half-submerged in the water. Some were spreading their limbs out like spiders to float or glide above the surface of the water.

“But we aren’t done with those in front of us,” Zhang Xiaohou said with a wry smile.

“Shen Qing should have told you what those things are. If the tide reaches the third level, we will all end up as floating bodies soon,” Mo Fan said.

“Brother Fan, I understand... so, do you have any good plans?” Zhang Xiaohou asked.

“Plan my ass, let’s screw them up!”

“...”

Mo Fan did not have time to come up with a plan. Even if they had a strategy, they had to adapt to the situation on hand during a battle. Mo Fan was not the kind to worry about coming up with a plan first; his strategy was always taking on the enemy head-on before worrying about the rest!

“I’ll lure these creatures away first. Brother Fan, you should give the Viscera Hunters around the second Magical Sea Beast some trouble. I’ll sneak up on it later,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Zhang Xiaohou had no idea whether Mo Fan had heard him. However, there was no need to state everything clearly with the synergy they had developed over the years.

Mo Fan no longer had to worry about finding himself solid ground to stand on after being given the Wind Wheels. They made Mo Fan a lot more comfortable. Besides, he could also use his Fire Element in the air. His Soul-grade flames could easily evaporate the petty raindrops!

Mo Fan rode the Wind Wheels and approached the circle of Viscera Hunters around the second Magical Sea Beast recklessly. The Viscera Hunters were like tigers and leopards accumulating their strength. They were tensing their bodies and limbs taut while glaring at Mo Fan up in the air. They were surely going to pounce at him once he was within their reach!

“Flame Sword!”

Mo Fan despised these Viscera Hunters a great deal now. He straight away used the strongest spells of his Fire Element.

He unleashed the three Soul-grade Flames while being Possessed by Little Flame Belle. Several Swords made of scorching lava appeared around Mo Fan. They plunged forward like meteors at the Viscera Hunters when Mo Fan pointed at them with a strong killing intent!

Mo Fan might have many Elements, but he had to admit that he was favoring his main Elements too much. The Viscera Hunters might be strong, but they were nowhere strong enough to inflict so many injuries on him and trap him. He was merely relying too heavily on the Fire Element and Little Flame Belle’s Possess. His Fire Element was the main reason he was capable of defending himself when fighting against huge numbers. The Flame Belle’s Domain would inflict serious damage on enemies that were too close to him, giving Mo Fan a safe environment to cast his destructive spells.

However, whenever he was up against sea monsters, especially when he had no choice but to fight in the waves, he would lose the game-breaking ability from being Possessed by Flame Belle. In addition, this environment was not perfect for his Lightning Element either, making him far more passive in the battle!

Mo Fan was relying too much on his Fire and Lightning Elements. If his Space, Summoning, Shadow, Chaos, and Earth Elements were as strong as his Lightning and Fire Elements, why would he struggle so much against these Viscera Hunters?

It was not like Mo Fan’s other Elements were not as useful as the Lightning and Fire Elements. This was all because Mo Fan had been taking on difficult challenges by fighting Ruler-level creatures or groups of Commander-level creatures. Therefore, the other Elements that were significantly weaker did not feel as useful to him.

In the end, his cultivation was still lacking!

His Fire and Lightning Elements were indeed strong enough to pose a threat to a Ruler-level creature.

Unfortunately, his other Elements could only inflict serious injuries on Commander-level creatures. They would struggle to hurt a Ruler-level creature.

Mo Fan tossed the Flame Swords at the Viscera Hunters while hovering in the air. He was not so brainless as to not know the Fire Element would be weakened by the water. It was merely because his Fire Element’s attacks were still stronger than other Elements, even when the environment was not favorable for him. As for his Lightning Element, he had used a lot of it previously. His energy would be depleted soon if he did not conserve it!

The Viscera Hunters were sea monsters, and so they were fond of wet and chilly environments. They greatly despised the Fire Element. Yet these cunning phantoms were surprisingly loyal in front of the Magical Sea Beast. They held their claws together and formed a huge shield with their backbones above the Magical Sea Beast to block the Flame Swords!

White vapor blew into the sky above the bay, but soon dispersed beneath the heavy rain.
