The old stairs were drenched from the rain, muddy footsteps were left over them as several people hurried their way down.

Not only was the inner city completely surrounded by the undead army, it was also shrouded in the cold rain and darkness. The people were looking forward to sunlight, but in the meantime, they were afraid to look out and see.

No one knew how much time had passed. The clock on the tower was purposely hidden. No one was willing to look at the death timer.

A pair of fiery wings flew toward the clock tower unevenly. The figure under the wings almost missed the platform. Zuo Feng and Yao Nan immediately went up and lent the person a hand.

“Councilman Zuo Feng, are you alright?” asked Zuo Feng.

“We lost,” Zhu Meng had a grim look, and spoke with a deep, decrepit voice.

“The Mountain Zombie...even you all failed to defeat it?” Zuo Feng glanced into the distance, yet he could not see anything in the dark. He could only hear an intimidating roar coming from the direction.

Zhu Meng half-knelt on the floor. The wound on his leg made it difficult for him to stand properly. The fiery wings on his back were torn. The lightning armor was destroyed beyond recognition. A potent Councilman had turned into a defeated general, his eyes completely lacked the will to fight.

“How...how are they doing?” asked Zhu Meng.

Zhu Meng was more concerned about Mo Fan and his crew. Many people had gone out to the battle, but only less than half managed to return in one piece. Zhu Meng witnessed the strongest Magician in their troop, Commander Yao Ting, get crushed to death by the Mountain Zombie.

Zhu Meng was in the last batch that made it back to the city. However, even he had no clue how many people had survived the battle against the Mountain Zombie.

The Mountain Zombie was stronger than they had imagined. Even if the Dark Abyss was not shifting toward the inner city, the Mountain Zombie would still raze the city to the ground!

“I’ll help you over, you can take a look yourself.” Zuo Feng helped Zhu Meng over to the mirror.

Zhu Meng was slightly confused. Yao Nan pointed at Xie Sang and explained to Zhu Meng about the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror.

“HAHAHAHA~ You guys are ridiculous, placing all your hope on a bunch of kids!” a burst of ear-piercing laughter came from above.

Zhu Meng raised his head and glared at Great Deacon Hu Jin, or Mu He, who was still tied under the clock.

Mu He was laughing wildly, like a devil who had enjoyed a feast of tears of sorrow. His evil, twisted face was filled with his deranged passion for the Black Vatican.

In Mu He’s eyes, death was nothing significant. He had waited so long for this festival. Once it came to an end, even if he died, it was only his flesh being destroyed. His soul would ascend to the Black Vatican’s Eternal Courtyard for his contributions. He would soon enjoy things like the gods in Heaven!

Mu He had killed many people, including those that had died in Bo City. Their souls would also end up at the Black Vatican’s Eternal Courtyard as his slaves. His contribution to the Black Vatican would make him a king in the Eternal Courtyard. The others would have to submit to him!

There was no need for him to do anything. He was simply waiting for his death, as he would soon ascend to his reward!

“This maniac, killing him isn’t enough to vent my anger!” snapped Yao Nan, glaring at Mu He.

Zhu Meng totally ignored the guy. He shifted his attention to the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror.

A bolt of purple-black lightning flashed across the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror, generating a giant web as arcs of lightning spread across the ground. In the middle of the lightning stood Mo Fan, who was like a lonely raft in a white storm, being tossed around by the strong currents. The hull was severely damaged, meaning that the raft would sink at any second.

Zhu Meng’s grim eyes were filled with shock upon seeing this!

“Did...did he kill all of those?” Zhu Meng asked in a trembling voice.

“Mm, they ended up in the Space of Death,” said Zuo Feng.

“He killed so many... just by himself?”

The bones spread across the ground, forming a long carpet of white extending into the distance.

On top of that, at the center of the carpet sprawled a hill of bones made up of the skulls, limbs, spines, ribs, breastbones, tibias, toes, and jaws of the skeletons... The bones were all messily piled up into a heaping white hill of bones, a macabre sight!

Mo Fan was engulfed in flames as he stood above the mountain of bones. His precious Black Snake Armor was severely damaged now. A fresh line of blood flowed down from the side of his head, across his face, and dripped to the ground...

He was like an arrow at the end of its flight. Even a soft breeze could easily blow him down from the mountain of bones.

Any other Magician would have closed their eyes and lunged into the pile of bones, seeking an eternal slumber.

But Mo Fan was still standing, his eyes, although overwhelmed by fatigue, were forcing themselves to focus.

“Zhu Meng, it’s good to see you back here...”

Several footsteps came from behind them. The other authorities who had gone to make preparations for the escape plan regrouped at the tower, including Han Ji and the mysterious man.

Ling Xi, Chu Jia, Lu Xu, Fei Jiao, and the others had recovered slightly. They were the main firepower for the escape plan. They would bring a small group of people and escape from the city.

The mysterious man realized Zhu Meng’s feelings when he saw him standing in front of the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror with a blank face. He walked up to Zhu Meng and patted his shoulder before sighing, “They have done a lot for us, and the city. Their names should be on the list of people whom we are escaping with, but we sent them to die in the imperial tomb that is over two thousand years old...”

“Yeah, Zhu Meng, gather yourself together. It’s important to look forward,” Fei Jiao walked up to comfort Zhu Meng, too.

“Being trapped by an army of skeletons, sigh...”

“They...they are not dead yet.” It took Zhu Meng a while to utter the words.

Zhu Meng’s words immediately stunned them.

-Not dead yet?-

That’s impossible, it had been a long time since they left. Even Advanced Magicians would have died a few times in their situation, let alone a few Intermediate Magicians!

“Take a look yourselves!” said Zhu Meng, pointing at the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror.

The people quickly went up to the mirror and saw the mountain of bones that left Zhu Meng in astonishment!

Mo Fan stood on the mountain of bones, flames burning on his hands. Countless skeletons were climbing up the mountain toward him, yet they were blasted into pieces by Mo Fan’s fire.

Anyone could tell that Mo Fan was already at his limit, yet when they saw the mountain of bones under his feet, their eyes began to tear up.

-He’s not dead yet!

-He’s actually not dead yet!-

The people had long given up on Mo Fan and the young magicians, their last glimpse of hope; yet to everyone’s surprise, he was still alive in the Space of Death!

The countless corpses and mountain of bones thoroughly portrayed the unyielding and proud spirit in his heart!
