Chapter 2344: Heavenly Flames on a Rampage

Translated by XephiZ

Mo Fan had already changed his position. Ice Tiger did not notice, as he was too busy dodging Mo Fan’s lava blast.

As a result, the angle of the second Lava Fist left Ice Tiger with no room to dodge, since the first lava river was still burning in that direction.

Ice Tiger’s face turned pale when he saw the second Lava Fist. It was obviously too late to dodge. He rolled toward the first lava river in the nick of time.

Flame tongues were still rising occasionally from the river of lava. It would take at least a few hours for the lava to cool down. Ice Tiger had no choice but to dive into the first lava flow to dodge the eruption of the second.

It did not feel great being burned at high temperatures even through his Sturdy Bone Armor. It felt like he was being fried in a pot of oil while he was rolling in the lava!

Ice Tiger cried out in agony. Anything that fell into the lava river caused huge flames to erupt from it. The slowly cooling lava burst into flames again, like the skeleton of a dragon coming back to life after being engulfed in flames.

Ice Tiger thought he could avoid the impact of the new Lava Fist by diving into the first river of lava. To his surprise, the lava river had not weakened by much.

The rain was evaporating rapidly from the heat.

There was only one river of lava at first, but there were now two of them crossing paths at Ice Tiger’s position. Ice Tiger had no clue where he should run. He was stuck between the two lava rivers!

“These…these are Fist Scars!”

The watching Advanced Mages totally lost their minds.

The fact that the Fist Scars were able to prevent the lava flowing in them from cooling down for hours was already insane, not to mention the lava erupting like a beam of light from Mo Fan’s fist!

If Mo Fan used it on a crowded spot on a battlefield, it would burn countless people to ashes and even cut the battlefield in half!

“Extreme Frost!”

The Mage in a silver-white robe could not wait any longer, since Ice Tiger had almost been cooked by the flames.

He used an Ice Spell. His silver-white robe seemed to symbolize his identity as an Ice Mage.

The temperature of the surroundings dropped rapidly. The raindrops which had evaporated above the rivers of lava turned into huge blocks of ice falling to the ground.

Mo Fan’s Fist Scars had forced the Brown Rebels to the opposite side and stopped them from coming any closer to him. Advanced Mages without Magic Wings or the ability to fly would not pose any threat to Mo Fan.

The priority of the Ice Mage White Leopard was to get rid of the lava rivers. Unfortunately, even an experienced Super Ice Mage like him was unable to cool off the Fist Scars in a short amount of time.

White Leopard frowned.

In terms of cultivation level, Mo Fan’s Fire Element had not reached the peak of the Super Level. Why was his Ice Magic so ineffective against the Fire Magic? At this rate, it would take at least another half an hour for his Ice Magic to cool down the lava!

The intruder had plenty of time to fight his way to the Heavenly Sensei!

White Leopard had no choice but to drag his brother Ice Tiger out of the lava first.

His face darkened when he saw his brother was badly burned by look and smell.

Even Ice Tiger was no match for the young man. The Federation Army had really sent a formidable foe to ambush their rear while the Eagle Horse Skyriders were distracting them.

“Bro..brother, why couldn’t my armor… stop his flames?” Ice Tiger was in a terrible state. He no longer had the guts to hop around and throw fists in front of Mo Fan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In the past, the Elemental Magic of enemy Super Mages had struggled to break through the defense of his Sturdy Bone Armor, but this time he was almost crippled by his enemy’s flames, even though he had only rolled around in the mage’s Fist Scars.

How were those flames so powerful?

“Could it be a Heaven-grade Flame?” White Leopard suddenly realized, staring at the still-scorching lava.

The Fist Scars were as long and wide as rivers. They might be tiny compared to the Scorching River, but wouldn’t the guy be a god if he could create more of them just by throwing a few punches around?

“Heaven-grade Flame?” Ice Tiger blurted out in surprise, but the scorched skin on his face almost fell off as he screamed. He did not dare say another word due to the immense pain!

“If he has a Heaven-grade Flame, your Sturdy Bone Armor wouldn’t stand a chance against it. I already told you you shouldn’t specialize only in one Element. You placed all your focus on refining your Bone Armor. Even if you did Awaken a Super Power, your chance of winning is slim if you are going up against a Fire Mage with a Heaven-grade Flame,” White Leopard scolded him.

“Brother, weren’t you the one who taught me to focus on one Element and derive my own style of fighting? Humph, I don’t think that young man is really that impressive! Brother, you have already Awakened the Super Power of your Ice Element. Your Ice Element has also reached the third tier. You have no reason to be scared of him!” Ice Tiger declared.

White Leopard shook his head.

“My Ice Magic is nowhere close to the power of a Heaven-grade Seed. Even though the Ice Element is effective against the Fire Element, and the heavy rain and the environment here make it difficult to unleash the full potential of the Fire Element, these factors are almost negligible if the enemy has a Heaven-grade Flame,” White Leopard replied.

“Why is that?” Ice Tiger was confused.

“Lava can flow in the sea because of how high its temperature is. Even the water at the bottom of the ocean can’t cool it down. A Heaven-grade Flame is just like lava. Nothing can suppress it unless they have the same level of Ice Magic or Water Magic,” White Leopard answered.

As an Ice Mage who had already reached the third tier of the Super Level, White Leopard was not too afraid of a first-tier Super Fire Mage with a Heaven-grade Flame…

But, he was still jealous!

A Heaven-grade Seed was only something that one could come across by luck!

He had long achieved the Super Level and Awakened a Super Power. He would be admired greatly across all of South America if he owned a Heaven-grade Ice Seed.

Unfortunately, he could not find one!

He only joined the Brown Rebels because of his personal grudge against a leader of the Federation who had competed for a Heaven-grade Ice Seed with him a year ago.

“Brother, you can’t beat him?” Ice Tiger asked in disbelief.

White Leopard burst out laughing. “A Heaven-grade Seed might be strong, but his cultivation level is two tiers lower than mine. He doesn’t have a Super Power for his Fire Element, either. He’s clearly no match for me,” White Leopard declared.

“What are you waiting for, then?” Ice Tiger said.

“Be patient, doesn’t the Heavenly Sensei have strong Mages protecting him too? That young man is clearly going after him. Why should I waste my energy? Let’s wait until he’s worn out,” White Leopard smiled cunningly.
