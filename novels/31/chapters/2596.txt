Asha’ruiya noticed Mo Fan’s passionate gaze on her. Normally, she would not think much of it, but Mo Fan was staring at her longer than usual, like he was unwilling to shift his gaze away.

Asha’ruiya moved her gaze away and asked him pointedly, “Why are you looking at me? Isn’t this Equipment more attractive than me?”

“Come, as long as you don’t have any weird fetishes, I can do everything for you!” Mo Fan sounded like he had no regard for his life anymore.

He had worked hard for the things he had wanted for so many years. He finally found a rich gorgeous woman who was willing to provide for him. He no longer had to work so hard!

“I think you have misunderstood. I’m only thanking you for helping the Black Dragon Emperor,” Asha’ruiya blinked at him.

“That simple? You sure you don’t have any other thoughts?” Mo Fan asked regretfully.

He was hesitant at first, but when he thought about the perfect set of Black Dragon Magic Equipment and Asha’ruiya’s alluring body, he immediately sent the little imp that was trying to change his mind away with a slap.

“Mmm,” Asha’ruiya nodded. She giggled when she saw the look on Mo Fan’s face, “We are purely sworn sisters.”

“...”

—

Mo Fan cut his thumb and used his blood to claim ownership of the magic Equipment as part of the usual procedure. Every piece of magic Equipment needed to be bound to their owner’s soul. Other people would not be able to steal and store them away in their Spiritual Worlds.

The Black Dragon Helmet was forged from the Black Dragon’s horns. The lines on it were spectacular. When Mo Fan put on the helmet, the vivid lines made him look like a real dragon with impressive horns.

“The Black Dragon Helmet can improve your mental strength. Try it out,” Asha’ruiya informed him when she saw Mo Fan trying on his new Equipment.

Mo Fan nodded, and gathered his Will.

He suddenly felt his eyes turning into some incredible devices, like he was able to analyze and see through everything. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He could immediately picture the library’s layout in his mind, including some details that were usually unnoticeable by the naked eye.

He was also able to see every single detail of the woman in front of him.

Normally, Mo Fan would focus his attention on a woman’s face and body, but he now noticed Asha’ruiya’s hair was not perfectly straight. There was a tiny braid on the back of her head, tied up in a bow.

Her earrings were made of pearls, and were giving off an unusual reflection. When Mo Fan focused on them, he realized the earrings were giving off a special mist that encapsulated Asha’ruiya.

They were a cultivation tool!

That explained why Asha’ruiya always wore the same earrings. They were a high-level cultivation Tool, one that was almost on par with the Little Loach Pendant!

No wonder her cultivation had improved so fast!

Asha’ruiya had put on a slight amount of makeup. Her eyebrows were delicately drawn. She had also put on a little mascara. To Mo Fan’s surprise, she did not wear any lipstick. He always found the color of her lips attractive, but it was actually the original color of her lips!

He finally knew why he always thought Asha’ruiya was seductive. Her red lips gave her a naturally sexy look.

Mo Fan was even more surprised when he noticed something else.

There was no padding! She was not wearing any falsies!

Her cup size was real! Mo Fan was dumbfounded.

Nowadays, a lot of women looked completely different when they were naked. Mo Fan was even more excited when he realized Asha’ruiya’s bust was natural.

Maybe he should ask Asha’ruiya to consider again? He would not mind if she had some weird fetishes!

“Can’t you look at something further away?” Asha’ruiya snarled.

Couldn’t this man be a little more reliable for once?

The Black Dragon Helmet had the ability to increase a Mage’s mental strength significantly. In simple words, it would greatly improve Mo Fan’s Dimensional Magic. Shouldn’t he focus on feeling out his new power?

The first thing he did was to examine a woman’s bust. Asha’ruiya almost had an urge to slice the pervert in half with her sword!

“It’s fine, it’s not like I can see through you. I’m just doing an experiment. Asha’ruiya, it turns out that the Shadow Element isn’t your strongest Element! You sure have a lot of secrets,” Mo Fan said with a mocking grin.

Asha’ruiya rolled her eyes and replied, “I can still take them back!”

“If you become the Goddess one day, please go easy on my woman Xinxia,” Mo Fan answered cheerfully.

“I can’t give you my promise. Women who are close in age can never treat one another peacefully. It has nothing to do with their personality. Besides, the thoughts of a Saintess who aims to become the Goddess will change over time. Do you really think she’s still the same Ye Xinxia whose only goal is to learn magic?” Asha’ruiya grinned like a noble white vixen.

“People change,” Mo Fan agreed.

For some reason, Mo Fan still felt Asha’ruiya acted extremely cautious around Xinxia.

He thought Asha’ruiya should be worried about Izisha instead, since she had the highest chance of becoming the Goddess.

Did Xinxia already have the upper hand in the election? Mo Fan had deduced this through his interactions with Asha’ruiya lately.

People change…

Mo Fan was not too bothered by Asha’ruiya’s obvious intention to incite disharmony between him and Xinxia. He knew that if Asha’ruiya truly wanted to separate him and Xinxia, she would not use such an ineffective method.

Zhang Xiaohou was a good example of change. He used to be timid and hesitant, and had always lacked the resolve to do things. But he was different now, decisive and stubborn. He would do anything to achieve his goals once his mind was set.

However, Mo Fan could also feel that the old pure and simple-minded Zhang Xiaohou had not vanished completely.

People always changed, but there was nothing to worry about as long as they did not lose themselves in an abyss, where even their family and friends could not convince them to turn around.

The people who did not change were somewhat lost, too, since they could not find the way forward.

Mo Fan respected Xinxia’s decision to stay at the Parthenon Temple. It also meant Mo Fan needed to accept the changes that were necessary for her to adapt to her role.

Mo Fan was supportive of Xinxia, but he did hope she would lose the election.

Every couple was selfish. They wanted their other halves to be forever by their sides.

However, even while they were still at school, Xinxia had never bound Mo Fan to her side, despite her inconvenience.. She had allowed Mo Fan to go on his adventures, and had respected Mo Fan’s passion. Why couldn’t Mo Fan respect her decisions, too?
