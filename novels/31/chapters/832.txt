The explosion of the fiery feathers produced a blinding light once again. Even other teams stationed in the nineteenth zone could hear the loud blast.

The flames burned fiercely. The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was caught in the burning debris. Its scales were not as effective this time, and it kept rolling on the ground, desperately trying to find water.

However, the creature kept slamming into buildings the more it panicked. It finally found a spot where the ice had melted and dove into the water head-first.

The depth of the water was ten meters, but the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was around fifteen meters tall. Somehow the creature had managed to shrink its body and disappeared after jumping into the water.

“Did it run away?” asked Hirose in lingering fear.

“I don’t think so, it’s only a minor injury,” said Mu Ningxue.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was not that weak. It had only dived into the water to put out the flames. Mu Ningxue strongly believed it would return soon.

As she predicted, a bloody flicker struck the ice where Mo Fan was standing on. It cut through the thick ice and hit Mo Fan while he was totally unprepared for it, leaving a deep cut on his waist!

He still had the Black Snake Armor protecting him. He was fortunate its time had not run out, or the slash would have cut him in half!

“That son of a bitch is still trying to ambush me after diving into the water!” Mo Fan held his side and repositioned himself to a spot with thicker ice.

The cut was even more painful than the previous one across his chest. Mo Fan could feel his waist tearing whenever he took a deep breath. He could not tell if the cut had reached his inner organs!

“Nan Rongni is still waiting for us to deliver the antidote. Let’s hurry up!” demanded Mu Ningxue in a serious tone.

It was impractical to kill the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast. Since the creature was able to counterattack in such a short period of time, it simply meant the damage Mo Fan dealt to it was not enough to threaten its life.

However, the creature did not dare to show itself again. It was a great chance for them to return to the twentieth zone.

“Mm, let’s go,” Mo Fan nodded.

“Are you alright?” Mu Ningxue was surprised to see Mo Fan finishing a sentence with just three words. It turned out that his injuries were rather serious.

“Not sure, the cut might have reached my inner organs...” Mo Fan’s face turned pale as he spoke.

He was fighting a Commander-level creature after all. The creature had surprised him with a counterattack before he could celebrate after landing his attack. It was obvious that he was still too weak to fight a Commander-level creature. He still had lots of room to improve before he could take on a Commander-level creature!

“We need to stop the bleeding first,” said Mu Ningxue.

“By the way, is the kidney on the left or the right?” Mo Fan asked seriously.

Mu Ningxue frowned. She once again thought there was something wrong with the man’s brain! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Is the kidney on the left or the right? There was a kidney on both the left and the right! Everyone had two kidneys!

“Answer me quick... if my kidney is damaged, please don’t give me the cold shoulder.”

“Can you be quiet for once!” snapped Mu Ningxue impatiently.

Mo Fan believed anyone would feel uneasy when a creature was applying its saliva on their wound, no matter how adorable the creature was. Too bad, Mu Ningxue insisted on it, thus Mo Fan had no choice but to accept the black cat demon’s saliva.

That being said, it actually worked like a charm. The bleeding stopped in no time, although it was still giving him a dull pain, probably because something inside was damaged. It better not be his kidney! The others could exchange their kidney for an iPhone, but his kidney was worth at least a top-spec Macbook!

Mo Fan was praying along the journey.

If Nan Rongni was not injured, she could easily treat his injuries. However, Nan Rongni’s life was currently in danger. If his precious kidney was injured, it would be a burden for Xinxia and Mu Ningxue...

The journey back was a lot safer. The little cat fully displayed her outstanding fighting power by dealing with the sea monsters they stumbled into on their way back. She basically killed them all instantly.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue saw lots of corpses still intact or torn into pieces floating on the water as they arrived in the twentieth zone, all belonging to the Jagged-Paw Green Demons!

“Why are there so many of them?!” Mo Fan was shocked on seeing the corpses. The number of Jagged-Paw Green Demons was twice the number he had imagined!

Luckily, Mochizuki Chihaya was an Advanced Magician. Otherwise, the team would have had trouble staying alive.

Nanyu, Zhao Manyan, and Jiang Shaoxu were overjoyed when they saw Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue’s return. However, when they saw the blood on their clothes, they knew they had gone through a lot.

The Night Rakshasa handed the antidote to Jiang Shaoxu. Jiang Shaoxu immediately tore the cloth off Nan Rongni’s leg and applied the antidote to the wound.

Nan Rongni had already lost consciousness. Her face was incredibly pale. It seemed her breathing had stopped, too.

The antidote was working very slowly, possibly because it had slightly solidified on the way back. There was nothing they could do but wait.

“You will get what you want if you come back a bit later,” mocked Mu Tingying with a hollow laugh.

Mu Ningxue glanced at Nan Rongni, whose life was in danger, and felt her chest burning with anger.

It was true that she wanted to stay on the team, yet she would never trade her friend’s life for it. She was already furious when she was provoked by the strange voice in her mind, and now Mu Tingying still tried to mock her. She could not hold it any longer...

“Meow!” the Night Rakshasa cried out and swiped her claws at Mu Tingying’s neck!

Mu Tingying screamed and immediately ran to the side.

“Feifei, what are you doing!” Jiang Yu immediately stopped the creature.

“Meow...” The Night Rakshasa licked her paws.

“You dumb cat, I’m going to skin you!” Mu Tingying rose to her feet miserably and discovered a few scratch marks on her neck. It had only hit the surface of her skin. She was not bleeding.

“Enough! You know how difficult it is to hunt the White Sobbing Demon; you better not say that again!” scolded Nanyu. She could not stand Mu Tingying’s sharp tongue either.

Mu Ningxue was going to take Mu Tingying down herself, but decided it was not the time to stir troubles since everyone was injured from the fighting. She immediately suppressed her anger.

“Humph, doesn’t matter, she will be leaving the team soon,” said Mu Tingying, before glaring at Jiang Yu. “You better watch your filthy cat!”

The others simply ignored Mu Tingying. Jiang Shaoxu was surprised when she saw Mo Fan sitting in a corner silently.

Jiang Shaoxu was confused. Normally, the guy would turn into a rascal when Mu Tingying dared to provoke Mu Ningxue. He would scold Mu Tingying until she could not keep her legs together. Why isn’t he reacting this time...

“Hey, you, are you alright?” Jiang Shaoxu nudged him.

Mo Fan raised his head with a pale face.

Jiang Shaoxu was stunned at the sight. She quickly covered her mouth.
