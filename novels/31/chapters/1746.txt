“What did I say? I told you I’m the best when it comes to Awakening new Elements. Even though you didn’t Awaken the Light Element you wanted, your Earth Element turns out to have an additional effect at the Super Level. Normally, you would have to spend more than ten times the price I offered if you did this somewhere else!” Guo Liyu proclaimed smugly.

The additional effect granted to a new Element had a very low chance of happening while a Mage was Awakening new Elements after reaching the Super Level. It normally depended on the Mage’s cultivation. The more impressive their cultivation, the higher the odds of having additional effects. Similar to using Guiding Stones, it was possible to increase the odds by using certain special substances during the Awakening process. Mo Fan had read some information on it all before.

However, the odds of having additional effects were higher when the Mage was not Awakening the new Element with the help of Guiding Stones. Besides, the more Stars the Mage enhanced, the higher the chance that the new Element would have additional effects!

Mo Fan had read many different opinions on how to acquire additional effects, but he had not expected his Earth Element to be so lucky!

An Enhanced Earth Element was definitely a lot better than the Light Element he had hoped for. Almost ninety-five percent of the Mages in society used their abilities the same way, following the same standard methods of casting their spells, more or less products of the same template. Only those with outstanding control and creativity could manipulate their spells as they pleased. Therefore, things like Innate Talents and Soul Seeds became very important for making a person stand out from others!

This additional effect was like having an extra Innate Talent. It would obviously grant him a great advantage in fights!

A strange glow suddenly lit up in his mind while he was filled with such great joy.

How could he not know what it was after being through the same process for the fourth time?

It was the Awakening of his second new Element!

His second new Element would appear shortly after the first new Element was Awakened. Mo Fan was looking forward to seeing what his eighth Element was after Awakening the Earth Element!

“Strange, where did it go?”

Mo Fan searched in his Spiritual World, but failed to locate his eighth Element.

He had definitely seen the light which indicated the birth of his eighth Element, but now he was having trouble finding the new Stardust. Did the Awakening fail?

He had never heard of anyone above the Basic Level failing an Awakening!

Mo Fan was puzzled. He was about to leave the Spiritual World when he suddenly noticed something glittering in a dark corner.

If the Spiritual World was like a dimly-lit swamp, Mo Fan was now staring at a little whirlpool in the swamp. It was spinning very slowly, and was easy to miss it without looking at it closely!

“So this is where the new Element is? Why do I feel like it has merged into the background? What Element is this? Why is it so vague and mysterious?” Mo Fan was both confused and excited.

Was it the Curse Element, or a Dark Element?

Mo Fan had a feeling that the Element was of the Dark Magic, but it did not seem like the Poison Element, since it resembled the Curse Element more.

He directed his will closer to his eighth Element to communicate with it.

“It’s not the Curse Element!” Mo Fan concluded the moment he made contact with the Stars!

The Stars were colorless, or to be more precise, they were changing colors according to their surroundings. When they were surrounded by void, they were empty, too. However, if he moved them closer to the other Elements, they soon acquired the same color!

“Chaos, it’s the Chaos Element!”

Mo Fan was absolutely dumbfounded!

He actually had one Element that he hoped to Awaken the most. It was the most mysterious Element among the Dimensional Magicks, the Chaos Element! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had first seen how ridiculous the Chaos Element was during the World College Tournament. Zorro’s unmatched Chaos Element allowed him to take on an entire team by himself. If he had not outsmarted Zorro back then, it was hard to tell who would have been the winner in the end!

He then used Heidi’s Chaos Element to stack up his Lightning and amplify its damage in the Pyramid, all in order to defeat a Ruler-level creature that was a lot stronger than them. Ever since then, he had been thinking about how having the Chaos Element would greatly increase his strength. He might be able to defeat certain creatures that were stronger than him!

To his amazement, he had managed to Awaken the Chaos Element as his eighth Element. It would further help him pursue the path of being a violent Mage!

Guo Liyu smacked himself on the head when he saw Mo Fan closing his eyes again. “I almost forgot that this kid can Awaken two Elements at every level. Seriously, how is such an insane Innate Talent even a thing!?”

Mo Fan opened his eyes. His pupils reflected the lights nearby before slowly reclaiming their usual color.

“How was it? What Element did you Awaken?” Guo Liyu quickly asked. It was naturally his first time dealing with a customer who was able to Awaken two Elements at once. He seemed even more excited than Mo Fan!

“The Chaos Element,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Oh, that’s a very difficult Element to master!” Guo Liyu exclaimed.

“It’s fine, I already have two Dimensional Magicks. I will practice the Chaos Element until it’s strong enough to handle fights alone, no matter how difficult it is!” Mo Fan swore.

“The Chaos Element is indeed a very powerful Element, but it’s more useful when it’s combined with other Elements. For example, you can play your enemy like a fiddle if you use it with the Shadow Element,” Guo Liyu advised him.

“Shadow Element? I have that, too!” Mo Fan raised his brows.

“Damn it, I totally forgot you are full of Elements! That’s great, the combination of Shadow Element and Chaos Element is pretty insane!” Guo Liyu told him.

Mo Fan’s lips curled upward. He believed the combination of his Chaos Element and Lightning Element was even more unstoppable...

Speaking of which, he remembered stumbling into someone who had both the Shadow Element and the Chaos Element... Bei Jiang!

Didn’t the assassin from the Assassin Palace have both Shadow and Chaos Elements? Mo Fan had even claimed the Darkness Contract from him!

If he had the Chaos Element, wouldn’t his shadow clones be even more unpredictable, allowing him to assassinate his enemy in numerous ways!?

“That’s great, the Chaos Element is the most ideal Element for a Mage with so many Elements like you. Not only is it useful on its own, you can combine it with other Elements in many ways!” Guo Liyu nattered on.

“You are really my lucky star. I always have surprises when I Awaken new Elements here,” Mo Fan said.

The Earth Element with an additional effect! The Chaos Element that could be used simultaneously with other spells!

Mo Fan was very satisfied with his two new Elements!

Lightning, Fire, Shadow, Summoning, Space, Demon, Earth, and Chaos... once he perfected all these Elements, he would truly be unbeatable!
