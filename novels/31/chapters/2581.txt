“What benefits did you receive from the human?” the Red Spider Lily Queen suddenly asked the Shadow Tribe Elder.

She was standing in shrubs made of red spider lilies. She would only move when she was attacking an enemy. She had remained unmoving and remained silent most of the time, so it was quite a surprise to hear her speak.

She was obviously talking to the Elder of the Shadow Tribe, who had a considerable status in the Dark Plane, judging from the Lord of Darkness and the Red Spider Lily Queen’s reactions.

It was reluctant to intervene with the battle in front of its superior, but it could not afford to be a bystander, either. After all, Mo Fan was going up against a team of Super Mages. The Elder was the core of Mo Fan’s Shadow Magic. If it did not lend Mo Fan a hand, he would struggle to beat his opponents!

“I could have a lot of fun!” the Elder of the Shadow Tribe answered. It sounded like an old man this time.

“Then… I guess it’s worth it.” The Red Spider Lily Queen fell silent again, like the statue of an empress.

—

The Elder of the Shadow Tribe also stopped talking, as if it was worried that its intervention might displease the Lord of Darkness. It did not fight at its own will. It had turned into Mo Fan’s shadow to lend him a hand, instead!

The Aura of Darkness continued to spread, making Mo Fan’s movements even more unpredictable. He sank into the Sea of Darkness again when he saw the Wind Mages trying to bind him with the Wind Kites.

“They enjoy hanging the kites on me. I should give them a piece of that, too!” Mo Fan grinned when he sensed the power of the Elder of the Shadow Tribe.

A dark mist boiled across the entire area. A pitch-black tower emerged from beneath the Dark Swamp.

The tower had a dozen floors. Sinister chains reached out from the ledges of each floor.

The chains had long scythes on their ends, which the Elder of the Shadow Tribe often used.

The scythes flew out of the tower and chased after the seven Wind Mages who were trying to pull the same trick on Mo Fan again.

The Skybound Mages were very agile. They were trying to evade the scythes, but the tower suddenly grew even larger. They found themselves still under the ledges, no matter how quickly they flew away.

The chains hooked onto their chests. They stuck to the Mages’ shadows instead of slicing their chests open. The Mages could not leave the reach of the tower!

“Should we kill them first?” Mo Fan spoke to his own shadow.

The Wind Mages among the Skybound Mages were as slimy as loaches. Even if Mo Fan transformed into the King of Hell, they just had to stay a safe distance away from him. Fighting demon creatures and fighting humans were two different things.

However, the Wind Mages were currently bound to the tower. Their souls would sustain a serious blow if they tried to break free from the chains by force.

It was up to them to decide their fate, but they had no choice but to fight Mo Fan while the tower was around!

Mo Fan was able to control the tower freely. He could even tighten the chains to drag the Wind Mages closer!

The seven Wind Mages began to panic. They had tried everything they could, but they still could not break free from the chains.

They would not last for more than five minutes if they had to fight Mo Fan head-on!

“Lightning Dragon Tail!”

Dense lightning intertwined up in the sky and turned into a lightning dragon. The lightning dragon vanished and hid above the clouds. Only its long tail was poking through them.

The Lightning Dragon Tail slammed down on the ground and split it in half. The huge ravine was more spectacular than the Loess Plateau. The Lightning Dragon Tail was terrifying after Mo Fan’s strength had been increased by fifty percent!

The Skybound Mage targeted by the Lightning Dragon Tail used everything he could to defend himself. He had even Summoned his Magic Armor.

The Skybound Mage struggled back to his feet in the scorched area.

His clothes were ragged and his body was covered in wounds, but the Lightning Dragon Tail had not killed him. He lifted his gaze and glared at Mo Fan, “Is that all you got?” he shouted defiantly.

“Aren’t you celebrating a little too early?” Mo Fan was amused.

When were these people going to learn? Were they still not treating him seriously after he had demonstrated Magic Fusion at the Dubai Tower?

“Chaos Cross Formation! Nine Lightning Dragon Tails!”

Mo Fan waved his other hand and established the Chaos Cross Formation in the sky.

Another destructive Lightning Dragon Tail appeared before the lightning flickers that had been left by the first one had even dissipated.

BANG!

The Lightning Dragon Tail slammed into the ground and deepened the ravine. Lightning arcs spread dazzlingly across the ground, like brilliant writhing snakes!

BANG!

The third Lightning Dragon Tail landed on the same spot, slamming the proud Skybound Mage to the ground.

BANG!

The Skybound Mage’s body was beyond recognition.

BANG!

His body was already smashed into several segments, but the Lightning Dragon Tails kept going!

The rest of the Lightning Dragon Tails were literally lashing a dead body!

The Spring of Darkness had boosted Mo Fan’s strength by fifty percent. His Lightning and Chaos Elements were also stronger with Magic Fusion.

Mo Fan had no idea where the Skybound Mage had gotten his attitude from. Was he proud of himself just because he had survived the first Lightning Dragon Tail?

Only the Skybound Mage’s skin was left on the ground. The other six Wind Mages who were locked down by the tower were terrified!

Were any of them able to survive all nine Lightning Dragon Tails?

“Don’t panic! If we lose, our souls will be stuck forever in the Dark Plane! Do you think dying is worse than having your souls tortured endlessly in this place? We can beat him if we work together!” the chief of the Skybound Mages cried out.

“We can’t go inside the tower!” the Wind Mages said.

“Focus on driving the Sea of Darkness away. It will stop him from using his Shadow Magic,” the chief said after thinking quickly.

The thought of being tortured for eternity was scarier than death. They were not willing to give up their freedom after they died!

“Transform the Dark Magic into some other Elements!” the chief ordered.

“What Element should we turn it into?” a Skybound Mage behind him promptly asked.

“Something that will give us an edge.”

“Many of us are Fire Mages!” a Skybound Mage with a fiery brooch on his chest spoke up.

“Are you retarded?” the chief cursed him instantly.

The Fire Element? They would be pushing themselves toward a furnace if they allowed their enemy to be reborn in fire! Besides, their enemy’s Fire Element was crazy strong, too!

“The Wind Element would be our best choice, but our Wind Mages are currently trapped by the tower. What about the Light Element?” the Fire Mage asked.

The chief shook his head. None of those left were particularly strong with the Light Element.

The Water Element was their best option, but few of them were Water Mages, since Dubai was a country of sand!

“The Earth Element. Change it into the Earth Element.”

Their country had a lot of Earth Mages since the desert had always been their battlefield.

However, Mo Fan also had the Earth Element…

They were aware of that, but they did not have a choice.. They had to transform the energy of the Dark Swamp into something that was beneficial for them. They did not have many options left if they tried to avoid all seven of Mo Fan’s Elements!
