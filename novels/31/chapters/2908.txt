Chapter 2910: Extreme South Graves

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

They had to admit that certain people were so powerfully gifted in the field of magic that they made others jealous.

The team had to confront the terrible weather. Those who had little leisure time did not bother to improve their own strengths.

But Mu Ningxue was different. She observed the situation. She changed her cultivation path with a new mindset that no one else bothered to try.

In fact, she had surpassed her peers. This was because she never stopped practicing her cultivation!

The crowd envied Mu Ningxue’s new ability. Her ability made her undefeatable before the Ice Element Mages. Before the Ice Element Mages cast their spells, they had to obtain her approval first, otherwise the Ice Element would rebel!

“Unfortunately, this ability is still far inferior to God’s gift. It can indeed suppress the spell below the Forbidden Curse, but it’s just a very ordinary ability in Forbidden Curse level,” said Wei Guang, shaking his head.

“Wei Guang, not everyone can become a Forbidden Mage. It’s considered rare to have someone of Mu Ningxue’s age achieve apex-grade in Ice Element, as well as possessing such a mystical Ice Element ability.” Wang Shuo chuckled.

The Forbidden Curse was bound by the Forbidden Curse Convention. It dictated that the Forbidden Mages would not involve or take part in any secular matters. The ability Mu Ningxue had mastered was supreme. They could not always measure her power from a Forbidden Mage’s point of view.

“Extreme South Land is a forbidden land. Even Forbidden Mages have difficulty surviving in such an environment. You are aware that the world is in the middle of various disasters, and the Forbidden Curse is the only spell that can truly make a difference in this world. Who are you to say that you can control your own destiny, unless the disaster directly befalls you. Are you seriously thinking that we’re living in a peaceful era? Do you think you can still sleep in peace in the city and organize some useless magic academic debate?” Wei Guang snorted at Wang Shuo.

“You’re right. We’re just a few grains among the sand. The waves can easily sweep us away. Meanwhile, you’re the boulder that can stand firmly in the middle of the flowing stream and can even split the stream water,” said Wang Shuo sarcastically.

…

After they passed by the Great Rift, Wang Shuo looked uneasy.

The previous areas were just the edge of the South Pole. This time, they had come to the real forbidden land.

After traveling for a few kilometers, the Ice Wheel Flying Boat had faced a serious issue. All the parts and machinery were frozen to the point that they could not operate anymore. Several Mages had to cast spells at the same time for the Ice Wheel Flying Boat to move on the thick ice surface.

The ice surface was uneven and jagged. The wind from the Great Rift swept over to them again. The wind filled the place and blended in with the terrifying ice and snow. They formed a frightening ice thunderstorm. Wei Guang and his group found themselves unable to move even an inch forward.

The Ice Wheel Flying Boat was their only refuge. It did not take long before the Ice Wheel Flying Boat was frozen in place and turned into a stone statue. It became a part of the surrounding glaciers.

The speed at which everything froze was faster than their ability to break free from it. Just when they thought they had finally avoided the “cleansing” of the ice field thunderstorm, they were terrified to find themselves frozen in the middle of the ice range of such thickness.

“Hurry up! We have to break the ice. Otherwise, we’ll be trapped inside here forever!” Wang Shuo cried out.

The cabin was filled with frost. Several Mages curled up under the quilt. No matter how the rest tried to wake them up, the Mages slept like a log

This was very dangerous. Sleeping like a log in the icy cold land was no different from death. Wei Guang and his group had to wake the mages up before their vital organs stopped functioning.

“How’s the Clear Fire Formation?!” asked Wei Guang.

“It’s not working. It’s difficult to break the Ice Wheel Flying Boat free. Call the rest. We must try to break the ice together!” shouted Li Wenbin.

“Damn it! Without the Clear Fire Formation, all of us will die in agony!” Wei Guang said in annoyance.

“After breaking the ice, we’ll return,” said Wang Shuo.

“Impossible. We have to continue moving forward until we arrive at South Pole Station,” said Wei Guang firmly. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They woke everyone up and started to break the ice.

The ice was extremely thick. It was much harder than the rocks under the ocean. Everyone took turns to cast spells. Even so, they were exhausted.

“Transform into dust!

Mu Ningxue cast the Absolute Forbidden Realm spell and transformed the solid ice into white ice dust. The next moment, a lengthy crack appeared on the massive frozen mountain range. They even saw the light of dusk from afar.

However, the speed of the condensation of the ice field thunderstorm was terrifying. The crack regenerated within a few seconds. Before the Ice Wheel Flying Boat could travel even a little, it was covered by thick ice and snow. The area where the Ice Wheel Flying Boat had been a while back had condensed into an ice mountain range!

Icebound!

If the scary Icebound was a type of magic, the power of the Icebound Coffin in the Extreme South Land had increased more than a thousand-fold. The magic could create iceberg graves on the land and bury Mu Ningxue and her group alive!

The graves continued to pile up and expand. The people trapped inside had to keep running and digging, or else, they would be trapped under the graves forever. They would not be able to see daylight again.

There were too many ancient experts trapped in the Extreme South Land. Some of them had been ruler-level experts. Even so, they could not escape from the clutches of these glacial grim reapers!

The wind blew the snow toward them. The strong wind solidified the snow. As a result, it hardened in the middle of the cold weather. If one were to look down from the sky, one could see the swift bulging of the ice mountain range on the land.

It was a glacial mountain range. It had been created miraculously in just a few hours. It meant a true disaster to the creatures on the ice land.

The Ice Wolf horde lived outside the Great Rift. They had been preserved in the newly risen ice veins, like fossilized specimens.

Likewise, a flock of flying Aurora Snow Birds was as still as a painting. They had been carved on a cliff several meters in height.

A Giant Ice Beast struggled furiously in the middle of the glacial thunderstorm. It was very strong and powerful. Whenever it charged at the ice rock that was several hundred meters thick, it shattered the ice rock into powder. Still, the glacier graves slowly engulfed its powerful body and made it a part of the ice vein…

Regardless of whether it was a living being or the snow land, those that did not condense into ocean water would freeze, including the space!

It had been a very spacious plain before. But now, the arrival of the ice field thunderstorm had created several terrifying glaciers. Frozen graves that spanned up to hundreds of kilometers rose from the ground!
