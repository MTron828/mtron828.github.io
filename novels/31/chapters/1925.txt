Mo Fan already had the Flogging Curse and Fiendish Night in his body. He initially thought the Dark Material would absorb the pieces in no time, yet he noticed the energy flowing to different parts of his body, like they were trying to activate different acupuncture points across his body!

There were a few dozen pieces of crystal. A strange flow of energy circulated inside Mo Fan’s body under their influence, following the path which the pieces were lined up in.

Mo Fan felt like he suddenly had extra blood vessels inside himself. The difference was that his blood vessels contained blood, but these meridians had a pure dark energy flowing in them!

The Dark Material in his body suddenly reacted like a bunch of little elves who had found a stream after coming out of a desert. They immediately dove into the dark energy meridians!

A huge area around Mo Fan was suddenly covered by darkness, as if a lunar eclipse was happening, only the dark energy meridian that were transparent on Mo Fan’s body were emitting a strange light!

Lin Du, Deng Yongchuan, and Biling were startled. They had no idea what to do upon witnessing Mo Fan’s transformation, nor did they know what was going on.

“Did the Dark Moon Crystal expire after so long? Why do I feel like he’s going to melt at any second?” Deng Yongchuan said with a worried look.

“Err... let’s observe it for a little longer. There shouldn’t be any problem. The Dark Moon Crystal was refined during the month with the strongest exposure to the moonlight around ten years ago. We have no clue how pure the dark energy in it is,” Lin Du said.

“Professor Lin, aren’t you worried that the dark energy will overwhelm him instead? Why did you let him absorb the energy just like that?” Biling said with a concerned look.

Everyone knew that the Dark Magic was like a double-edged sword. It would have great consequences for the person absorbing it if it was not controlled properly. Many Mages who practiced the Curse and Undead Elements had died from the serious injuries their souls had suffered from practicing Dark Magic!

A while later, the phenomenon resembling an eclipse finally came to a stop, but the light Mo Fan was emitting previously had gathered in his eyes instead. His eyes were now like the cold moon hanging in the night sky. They would catch people’s attention without them knowing!

“Brother Mo Fan, how was it? Are you alright?” Lin Du asked with a worried face.

“I’m great, I’m perfectly fine!” Mo Fan assured the man. Even though his expression was not telling much, his lips had curled upward slightly. It was a sign that he was brimming with confidence!

“Are you able to kill the sea monsters?” Deng Yongchuan asked.

A few waves of the Scarlet Soaring Demons had already reached Gaoqi Airport after Mo Fan stopped using his Lightning Spells. Even though the military was defending the airport, the soldiers struggled to stop every Scarlet Soaring Demon, as the creatures were invading the city from different points. There were also still a great many civilians in the city. Deng Yongchuan had begun to panic. If it had been possible to transfer energy to others like a blood transfusion, he was more than willing to share all his energy with Mo Fan!

“Yes, I can kill many of them!” Mo Fan declared confidently.

“How?” Biling asked.

“The same old way. Try to gather the sea monsters in the same area and I’ll take them all out!” Mo Fan’s tone had changed too.

“Is it fine if they are underwater?” Lin Du asked. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“That’s fine, the water won’t hinder my Shadow Element, but I’ll have to get closer,” Mo Fan said.

“You sure? It’s very dangerous, those sea monsters can still attack you even if you’re in the air,” Deng Yongchuan said.

“I’ll give you a ride,” Biling did not ask too many questions. They had already witnessed Mo Fan’s strength. They were willing to help Mo Fan as much as they could if he was able to kill the sea monsters.

Biling quickly drew a blue pattern of the Summoning Contract in front of her. It resembled a gate, from which a mystical blue spirit quickly appeared.

The mystical spirit’s appearance was rather unique. They could only see a pair of wings and not its body and head from a certain distance away.

Mo Fan was astounded when he saw the creature.

“It’s a Magic Feather Imp. It can wrap its body around an enemy like a tentacle and lift them into the sky if they can’t fly. It will then drop the enemy and let them fall to their death... These imps aren’t too friendly, but they can be used as a flying tool,” Biling explained.

The mystical creature had already wrapped itself around Mo Fan like an octopus while they were talking. Its wings happened to be on Mo Fan’s back...

It felt like he was wearing a backpack with wings, but the backpack was actually a rare creature!

Mo Fan was quite surprised. He had never seen this kind of creature before. It must be a unique species among the Winged Beasts.

“It’s a mischievous creature, so I’ll have to stick close to you in case it doesn’t want to behave itself. I’ll go with you,” Biling said.

Biling cast a Wind Spell and Summoned a pair of Wind Wings onto her back.

Biling had the Wind Element, so the Magic Feather Imp was not that useful for her. She had almost forgot she had a second Contracted Beast.

“Alright, we’ll go together. We’ll stick to the plan...” Mo Fan nodded.

The Magic Feather Imp was in high spirits. It beat its wings and took off into the sky before Mo Fan could finish the sentence.

Normally, a flying creature would have great coordination between its body and wings to maintain its balance, but when Mo Fan took off with the Demon Feather Imp, it felt like the wings were separating from him. Well, the wings were not attached to him in the first place. As a result, it felt more like an eagle was holding a little chick in its claws, and Mo Fan was the chick!

—

Mo Fan finally recovered his balance after he was up in the sky. He glanced resentfully at the Magic Feather Imp lying on his back!

“Damn it, I was trying to act cool after having a breakthrough, but this idiot ruins it all!” Mo Fan held a strong grudge against the creature for embarrassing him in front of the others. The Magic Feather Imp was truly a problematic beast. He actually thought the creature was special and useful at first.

“Senior, we are almost there,” Biling said.

Mo Fan grinned once again.

It was time to satisfy the thirst of his Super Level Shadow Element!
