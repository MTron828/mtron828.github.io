“That Maga is so strong!”

“Who is she? Does anyone know her name?” Some old Mages among the spectators sitting close to the stage had started whispering to one another.

“She must be Mu Ningxue, a very famous Ice Mage from the Imperial College. I heard her name a couple of times from the Mu Clan, but I didn’t expect her to be this talented!”

Akira Matsuki was knocked out from the stage, meaning that the Japanese team had lost an important member. They basically had no hope of securing an advantage in the match.

He had been the key person needed to secure the Japanese victory!

The crowd immediately burst into an uproar, and soon, many people had learned Mu Ningxue’s name. The fact that she could overpower her opponents easily showed how overwhelming her strength was!

—

“Goddess Mu’s strength is a lot scarier than before!” Zhao Manyan’s eyes almost popped out from their sockets.

“This student is impressive,” Pang Lai, the Royal Guards’ chief, fondled his beard with a gratified look.

“She is finally displaying her true strength. To be honest, even I didn’t expect her to take out such a troublesome opponent so easily,” Feng Li said with a hint of surprise.

The team knew Mu Ningxue was strong. In terms of strength, she was right behind Ai Jiangtu and Mo Fan on the team. However, it seemed like Mu Ningxue had improved dramatically, enough to easily defeat one of the main representatives of the Japanese team!

“I thought the match was going to last for quite a while. I didn’t expect Mu Ningxue to be able to turn the tables so quickly. Victory is within our grasp, as long as we take it slowly and steadily!”

The team continued to compliment Mu Ningxue’s performance. Meanwhile, Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni only had twisted expressions.

They had tried so hard to trample Mu Ningxue, yet even so, she had immediately entered the limelight in the opening match. Most importantly, it would be even more difficult for them to pick on her if her reputation kept growing!

They clenched their teeth furiously when they saw their enemy grabbing all the attention. However, there was nothing they could do, apart from watching how Mu Ningxue was stirring an uproar among the crowd!

Mu Ningxue’s attack did not stop after taking out Akira Matsuki. As a matter of fact, her real expertise was asserting control over the stage with her Ice Magic.

The ice was already a meter thick. The Ice Magic drifted across the stage in the wind. The Japanese team was suppressed by the Ice Domain. Not only were their movements slowing down, even their channeling speed and the damage of their spells had been dramatically reduced!

“Icebound Coffin!” Mu Ningxue completed the Star Constellation of the Advanced Spell. She had finally launched her attack as the main attacker on her team!

The enormous amount of ice in the sky left a shadow on the ground. The Japanese team raised their eyes and were shocked to see five Icebound Coffins falling from the sky right on top of where they were standing. Each Icebound Coffin covered the area within several hundred meters in a strong, terrifying chill. Even though the Japanese team managed to dodge the direct impact of the Icebound Coffins, the freezing power of the Icebound Coffins as they landed on the ground also posed a great threat to them!

A white mist surged across the place. The five enormous Icebound Coffins stood as firmly as mountains, a spectacular sight!.

The Japanese team was split up by the enormous impacts. Some had to put on their magic armor just so they could resist the cold from the spell. None of them were at ease. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Her Domain is way too terrifying! How can we possibly stand a chance against five Icebound Coffins falling at the same time?”

“We have lost thirty percent of our damage because of it, and her Domain is still able to amplify the damage of her own spells! We can’t afford to let her cast another spell!” the plump man on the Japanese team shivered.

Someone on their team had already put on their magic armor, meaning that if the attacks kept on coming, someone on their team would soon be disqualified again!

“I’ll deal with her; find a chance to take out those that are weaker on their team,” Shou Watani said with a dark expression.

He could no longer afford to preserve his strength. Shou Watani stuck closely to the ground as he moved forward rapidly.

He had to find a way to keep the Ice Maga at bay. Otherwise, his team would be wiped out in a few rounds!

Shou Watani arrived in the forest, gradually approaching the hovering, winged Mu Ningxue.

“Rock Serpent!” Shou Watani stomped the ground. The thick layer of ice cracked open as a Rock Serpent burst out from the ground and wove through the forest quickly.

Shou Watani stood on the head of the Rock Serpent as it slowly rose into the air. His eyes slowly turned into the color of a Rock Demon, planning to stop Mu Ningxue with Petrify.

However, before he could make his move, a man in a jacket suddenly appeared on the back of the Rock Serpent in a silver flash.

“Ai Jiangtu!” Shou Watani turned to the man.

Ai Jiangtu was an expert at moving around with Blink. He was able to move instantly onto the Rock Serpent’s back. It was obvious that he was planning to confront his opponent directly.

“Mu Ningxue, you, Guan Yu, Jiang Yu, and Jiang Shaoxu will handle the remaining three. Leave this guy to me,” Ai Jiangtu ordered.

The Chinese team had secured an advantage with their numbers. They only needed to keep the strongest member on the Japanese team, Shou Watani, busy while the others focused on knocking out the remaining members.

Mu Ningxue nodded. The Wind Wings on her back beat as she sprang forward like an ice fairy. She flew over above the Japanese team, and softly chanted the curse of Wind and Ice!

“Ice Wind Storm!”

Snow the size of goose feathers fell rapidly, gradually turning into a terrifying storm as a strong wind blew, dragging the members of the Japanese team that were scattered across the place toward the center of it.

—

The snow poured down fiercely. A tall mountain of snow stacked up in the Japanese team’s territory without them knowing, and the remaining members of the Japanese team were unwillingly gathered together. They were starting to lose their focus after suffering continuous impacts from the snow.

“Damn it, my Fire isn’t working!” Yosuke snapped furiously.

In Mu Ningxue’s Domain, even casting a single Fire Spell was extremely difficult, let alone trying to use Fire to set up a safe zone for the team. The Star Orbits kept breaking as Yosuke was trying to connect them. It was driving the man crazy!

When Yosuke was feeling anxious, a shadow in the storm moved past him quickly. A brown claw gauntlet stabbed into his leg...

“AHHH, you son of a b**ch!” Yosuke burst out screaming, feeling the pain from his leg.

Lots of poisonous bugs immediately flew out of his body and chased after the shadow.

“Where do you think you’re running to!?” Yosuke yelled out angrily.

The poisonous bugs were called the Vengeful Flies. It was a unique passive ability that an Intermediate Poison Mage had. Whenever the Mage was hurt, the Vengeful Flies would appear and chase after the person that had hurt the Mage relentlessly!

As such, even though Yosuke was injured, he was grinning coldly. The Vengeful Flies carried a deadly poison. He firmly believed that the person that had stabbed him had no chance of escaping.

Lots of Vengeful Flies were flying in the air. They did not have eyes, but they were able to locate the attacker precisely. Despite the snowy storm that was blocking everyone’s sight, they were still able to lock on Guan Yu!

Yosuke tried to treat his wound with some medicine when he saw the Vengeful Flies chasing the shadow into the distance.

If their team was still complete, a drop of Healing Liquid was enough to help him recover. However, he was having trouble finding his own teammates in the storm!

“Ah, ahhh, damn it!” Yosuke was about to treat his wound when he saw it get covered in a layer of frost.

Normally, freezing a wound would reduce the pain to a certain degree and stop the blood loss. However, the enemy’s frost was able to penetrate his body through the cut to freeze his blood. In just a few minutes, he would lose control of his leg, and there might be a chance that his whole body would stop moving!

He had stayed in the Ice Domain for too long. Even though he did not suffer any direct hits from the spells, he was slowly losing his ability to fight!

“Did...did we really underestimate the Chinese team...” a girl with a cute appearance on the Japanese team asked numbly.

Fujikata Tegami was utterly speechless. Standing next to her was Mochizuki Chihaya. Even though she was not an instructor of the national team, she still had the right to observe the battle with the team.

“I initially thought Mo Fan was the trickiest to deal with. Who knew their team actually had a bunch of similarly tricky opponents,” Mochizuki Chihaya sighed.

“Yeah, that Space Mage is able to keep Captain Shou Watani busy while the Ice Maga simply crushes the rest of the team. She’s completely unstoppable. Our team would be unlikely to win even if Miss Ranko was in the match...”

“I believe that Ice Maga is not any weaker than our captain, either. Her overpowering Ice Magic is simply too terrifying. Other teams will have a hard time stopping her, too. Since when is the Chinese team so strong?” a Japanese instructor wondered.

“It’s only a matter of time until our team loses.”

“I thought we were going to win our first match, but we ended up losing so terribly,” the members of the Japanese team all had grim expressions.

—

The seats where the Egyptian team was sitting...

“Sayed, do you still remember her?”

“How could I forget her? Holy crap, since when is she so powerful!?” Sayed cried out in amazement.

In the past, Sayed had dominated the team at Shanghai’s Training Hall with the Death Saber Mummy. Even though he was beaten up by Mu Ningxue in the end, he believed a Mage of her standard would surely join the national team in the end. As such, he had been waiting for the chance to earn his dignity back at the World College Tournament.

However, it seemed like he would never win his dignity back after witnessing the woman’s strength...

She was too ridiculously strong!
