“Taking pictures as souvenirs? What the hell?” Zhao Manyan furrowed.

Not only did Major General Jessica greet them impatiently, but she even sounded like they were three good-for-nothing sons of rich families here on a vacation?

It was true that some rich second generations lacked capabilities and insisted on coming to the front line just so they could boast to others after they returned to their cities. It was like studying abroad to improve their resume!

Jessica had met a lot of young people like that, so she did not treat Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai, who looked nothing like soldiers, seriously.

The situation was already so bad, yet the officials were still adding trouble on top!

“Hold it right there!” Mo Fan was displeased by General Jessica’s attitude when he saw her about to leave. “Didn’t your superior tell you why we are here?”

General Jessica turned around and answered impatiently, “He did, but does it matter? Can you really kill the Evil Duo of the Mediterranean Sea? He’s just giving you a challenging task so you can write it in your resume that you’ve taken part in such a difficult mission. Am I right?”

“Can you please make your decision after you have spent five minutes hearing us out? Your superior asked you to assist us, yet you are leaving after greeting us. What the Hell are you thinking?” Mo Fan demanded.

“Hear you out? I just came from the battlefield and waited ten minutes for you to arrive. I have wasted another five minutes talking to you and will waste ten minutes getting back to the battlefield, and yet you are telling me I should waste another five minutes to hear you talk about your impressive background? Do you know how many of my men are going to die in that period?” General Jessica snarled.

Her eyes were red as she was speaking. She was obviously forced to be here.

They had assigned her to do such a meaningless task just because she was a woman. She was a warrior fighting at the front line too! The number of demon creatures she had killed was higher than any of the other Major Generals!

Yet her superior kept treating her as a secretary and assigning her to do petty tasks like this!

Jessica left after finishing her sentence. She was afraid that she could not hold back her urge to kill these men!

Why could not they just stay in the city and enjoy their lives? Why did they come to the front line and trouble her? She had enough of these assh**** and their formidable backgrounds!

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai were speechless as they watched her leave.

“Seriously, why did we have to stumble into a resentful woman?” Zhao Manyan complained.

“Forget it, she must have been annoyed by some rich second generations. She already gave us the information. Let’s find them ourselves,” Mu Bai sighed.

“By the way, isn’t this place a little too close to the front line? Look at the mist and the clouds. They are like a black storm!” Zhao Manyan pointed at the water two kilometers away.

The whole fortress was shrouded by a mist. It wasn’t because it was raining, but because the waves of the battlefield that was only a few kilometers away were rolling fiercely in this direction under the influence of the strong wind. Even the helicopter had been shaking violently when it was trying to land.

The fortress was very simple. The soldiers were soaked and in a hurry. Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai felt a little awkward, as they had no idea what to do.

“Tyrant Titan!”

“It’s a Tyrant Titan!”

The soldiers in the fortress started screaming in fear. The wind and the storm grew fiercer. The light that the soldiers’ magic was emitting dimmed all of a sudden, like the light of a fishing boat surrounded by huge waves.

“Fall back, fall back at once! Everyone, withdraw from the Three Leaves Island Defensive Perimeter and retreat to the bay!”

“Move!”

The soldiers in the fortress were constantly moving around. They were even more nervous after the Tyrant Titan showed up, and immediately went to secure their positions.

—

Around ten minutes later, Major General Jessica came back into the fortress. The bloodstains on her were being washed away by the mist as more blood seeped out from her wounds, dying her military outfit red.

“Why are you still here? We are going to lose the Three Leaves Island Defensive Perimeter soon!” General Jessica yelled at them.

“Is it because of the Tyrant Titan?” Mo Fan studied the chaotic sea in the distance. He could see a faint silhouette approaching the fortress.

Most magic was effective against the Sea Demon Snakes, but it was a different story when a Tyrant Titan showed up.

The Tyrant Titan was like a mountain as it stepped forward to protect the demon snakes. Every spell that landed on it was like mere fireworks without any damage. The Tyrant Titan could easily press forward with an army of demon creatures. They did not have enough Advanced and Super Mages to stop its progress!

“We are here to take out the Tyrant Titan,” Zhao Manyan declared.

“Idiots!” General Jessica shouted at them.

“We’ve killed two seventy-meters Tyrant Titans this week,” Mu Bai said.

“You are nothing but fools!” General Jessica yelled.

Mo Fan kept staring at the sea, noticing the tyrant’s head alone was around the height of the fortress. Mu Bai estimated the height of its head to be around forty meters.

Could it be a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan?

That was not possible. If it was a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan, General Jessica would not have come back alive. There would be no reason to retreat, since no one could possibly survive.

The figure in the mist rose as Mo Fan was still having his doubts. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was rising as if it was climbing up a flight of stairs. It was more than a hundred meters high when it was less than a kilometer away from the fortress!

The fortress was currently at the Tyrant Titan’s waist, which meant the Tyrant Titan was around two hundred meters tall!

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai raised their heads. They were confident that it was a Blue Star Tyrant Titan, but they had never seen one so tall before!

The tallest Blue Star Tyrant Titan they had encountered so far was only ninety meters tall. They had never seen a Blue Star Tyrant Titan above one hundred meters, let alone two hundred meters!

A two-hundred-meter-tall Tyrant Titan was still a city destroyer, even if it was only a Blue Star Tyrant Titan. No wonder the defensive perimeter had collapsed so easily!

“The Blue Star Tyrant Titans we killed so far were like children in kindergarten compared to this guy...” Zhao Manyan swallowed hard.

“Ye...yeah!” Mo Fan nodded in awe.

Its size alone was enough to scare the crap out of people. The pressure it gave Mo Fan was stronger than the Volcano Titan!
