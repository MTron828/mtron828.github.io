Mo Fan had barely come up with an explanation for Xinxia. He had not come up with an explanation for Mu Ningxue yet. The speech he had prepared for Xinxia was useless on Mu Ningxue!

He was not mentally prepared at all. He did not even realize that the girl who made his heart race as he slowly approached the table was Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue was dressed differently than normal, wearing a black evening gown. She was incredibly sexy, especially how her shoulders were exposed. Mo Fan believed he could kiss her shoulders for a year without getting enough of them. She looked so different that he did not even recognize her from the side, especially with how her hair was tied up with a headscarf.

Mo Fan had never seen Mu Ningxue dressed up like that. She was young but mature, sexy but composed. She no longer had her normal unapproachable demeanor. Mo Fan was already used to her icy bearing, and was completely enticed by her charm. He simply had the urge to carry her into a room, onto a huge bed...

“My Great Castellan, aren’t you amusing? Weren’t you supposed to know if Ningxue is here? Why should I tell you?” Mui Nuxin giggled, especially amused after seeing Mo Fan’s reaction.

“It’s hard to explain it in a few words. Xuexue, why didn’t you tell me you were coming? Seriously, you’re so gorgeous today, I couldn’t even recognize you. It’s such a relief that it was you. I initially thought I was such a scum that I would be so easily allured by any woman, but it turned out to be you, hahaha, HAHAHA! That’s great!” Mo Fan sat down beside Mu Ningxue and quickly blurted out some comforting words.

Apas and Heidi took their seats, too. They were rather surprised.

Mo Fan had always been fearless. He even dared to intimidate the Scorpion Lord Medusa, yet was there really someone he was afraid of?

“Mu Bai, who is she?” Heidi whispered curiously.

The new woman was extremely good-looking. Heidi was always confident in her appearance, but somehow, she was a little ashamed when facing this woman with an unusual bearing.

“Someone that Mo Fan likes,” Mu Bai said. He was not too sure how to explain their relationship.

Mu Ningxue had never clarified that she was going to marry Mo Fan. It had been a long time since Mu Bai had last contacted anyone from Mu Ningxue’s family. He had no idea if Mo Fan had succeeded in winning her affection. He only knew the relationship between them was a little ambiguous, especially since they had established Fanxue Mountain together...

“He likes every good-looking woman. Isn’t that what he said?” Apas piped up with a gloating grin.

“You’re right. In that case, you can think of her as Mo Fan’s goddess,” Mu Bai said.

“Oh, I think I understand now,” Heidi nodded. She could not wait to enjoy the show...

If Mo Fan had known Mu Ningxue was here, he would never have brought Apas along. He would have tossed her into the Contract Space instead, but it was too late now.

“Let’s eat first,” Mui Ningxue told Mui Nuxin. She was not in the mood to listen to Mo Fan’s explanation.

“Mm,” Mui Nuxin nodded.

“Ah, I have something to tell you, it’s about Mu Bai. He’s close to reaching the Super Level. I was thinking that since he’s one of us, we should help him collect the resources he might need,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m not in a rush,” Mu Bai said.

“Of course you are, having a Super Mage means having another reliable helper...” Mo Fan said.

“I’ll stick to Mu Ningxue’s decision. She’s in charge of Fanxue Mountain, you only have a title with no obligations,” Mu Bai said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The invitation was both shocking and exciting for Mo Fan.

He was planning to go back to Fanxue Mountain after paying Xinxia a visit. It had been so long since he last saw Mu Ningxue, considering he had spent almost half a year at the Alps and in Egypt.

Imagine if a couple had not met for half a year, yet the wife saw her husband walking closely with a gorgeous young girl as soon as they met. Mo Fan was seriously worried that Mu Ningxue would end his life once and for all with her Ice Crystal Bow.

“Mu Ningxue, did you come to Athens for something urgent?” Mu Bai believed he had gloated enough. He sensibly changed the topic.

“Mm, we found an island with quartz reefs in the East China Sea. We are planning to export the ores to Europe, most likely to Athens. Mui Nuxin happened to have enough resources here. We also plan to buy a batch of defensive Equipment. Our Mages stationed on the Quartz Reef Island had a lot of casualties recently,” Mu Ningxue said.

“What creatures are there on the island?” Mo Fan asked.

“A bunch of Tyrannical Demon Shellfish. They are fond of the ores, too. Before we found the island, the Tyrannical Demon Shellfish that reached the Warrior-level would cultivate on the island to evolve into Golden Demon Shellfish. These Golden Demon Shellfish have been quite a nuisance for us,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Speaking of which, Mo Fan, this was the reason why I went with Zu Xiangtian to meet Rosie. She’s our first option for reaching a deal with,” Mui Nuxin chimed in.

Mui Nuxin explained everything that had happened to Mu Ningxue.

“If that’s her attitude toward the incident, it shows us that she doesn’t have any principles. She’s not a reliable business partner,” Mu Ningxue stated.

Mu Ningxue was extremely strict about the personalities of her business partners. Mo Fan was quite surprised. He was actually worried that Mu Ningxue would blame him for ruining her plan.

Mo Fan did not have a positive first impression of Rosie, either. She was reluctant to tell them the truth about the young Tyrant Titan’s heart, even though Leng Qing had already explained how much of a threat the Tyrant Titan would be to the people.

“Perhaps I have already gotten used to it after staying in this circle for a long time... but it’s good that you only choose to work with people who can stick to their principles. At least it won’t give Fanxue Mountain a bad name,” Mui Nuxin admitted.

When it came to Fanxue Mountain’s growth, its safety was Mu Ningxue’s priority, followed by its reputation.

If she did not care about principles, like how Rosie had disregarded the safety of the people in Athens, how could a little clan in Athens possibly outgrow Fanxue Mountain?

“We have another problem. If we want to sell the high-quality ore in Europe, we’ll need approval from Europe’s Magic Ores Association, and their appraisal. Unfortunately, the person in charge is from the Zu Clan,” Mui Nuxin said.

“...” Mo Fan was left speechless.

Why did the bad things always come bundled up together?
