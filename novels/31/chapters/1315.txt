“Who is this woman? Her looks definitely suit my taste!” Li Ling grinned when he saw Shao Yu walking onto the stage.

“They are huge!” One of Li Ling’s men stared at Shao Yu covetously.

Shao Yu’s waist and shoulders were very slim, yet her bust was unusually large. They could even tell when watching her from behind. Li Ling was an infamous playboy. Shao Yu earned his attention as soon as he set his eyes on her.

It turned out that the duel would not be as boring as he first thought. Fanxue Mountain did have a lot of gorgeous women!

“So you are the one that wants to fight me?” Li Ling went forward and observed Shao Yu closely. He was even more aroused after seeing how good-looking the woman was up close.

Her slightly cold temperament, as if no man was allowed to stand close to her, was particularly tempting. He enjoyed turning cold women like her into a slutty b****es...

Shao Yu stood on the stage and glanced at the representatives of the renowned clans.

Not many people had come to the meeting. Each renowned clan had only sent their representatives and a few young Mages. The rest were the people of the Donghai Magic Association. They were all looking at Shao Yu curiously with faint grins. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Fanxue Mountain only has a bunch of scrubs. Why would a young and beautiful girl like you stay at a little clan that is about to meet its end? Come to our Dali Clan, I can give you everything you want; the respect of people, your family will feel proud of you. There are endless resources and luxurious magic Equipment...” Li Ling was recruiting Shao Yu before the fight even started.

“How do you know I’m qualified to join your Dali Clan before I even cast a single spell?” Shao Yu asked in amusement.

“It doesn’t matter, all it matters is that I’m strong enough. I can recruit whoever I want, and no one will say a single word. Our Dali Clan has everything you can hope for,” Li Ling declared confidently.

“I don’t know how the Dali Clan is like, but after seeing what an idiot you are, I can imagine that the Dali Clan won’t be far from its destruction,” Shao Yu replied a calm voice.

However, the calmer she sounded, the angrier Li Ling felt, as if his chest was about to explode!

“How dare you underestimate me! Didn’t you see how they have all lost to me in a single round!?” Li Ling snapped.

“I did, which is why I’m convinced that you are a self-righteous retard!” Shao Yu retorted.

Li Ling’s expression sank. He started to look vicious.

He was initially thinking of going easy on the woman, since she was his type. However, it turned out he would have to make her feel pain so she would take back her pride!

“Soaring Wild Wave!” Li Ling summoned a fierce tide to let loose the rage in his heart.

His Spirit-grade Seed amplified the Rolling Wave. It was an Intermediate Spell, yet its aura was greater than some Advanced Spells!

“Sound Disturbance!”

Shao Yu reacted swiftly. She plucked the air like there was an invisible string!

The sound of the string did not spread. The crowd only heard a soft buzz, yet it was far from a harmonious chord in Li Ling’s brain. It felt like his Spiritual World was going to collapse under the piercing screech!

The rolling waves began to dissipate after Li Ling lost control over them. He was unable to focus on controlling the Water Star Pattern. He covered his ears, yet the noise kept echoing in his skull. He had no clue how to stop it.

“Swallow Blossom!”

Shao Yu immediately cast an Advanced Plant Spell. It was a dark red flower resembling a morning glory instead of the usual Demon Tree Hand. The huge flower grabbed Li Ling’s leg and swallowed him before he could react!

Li Ling was drowned in a corrosive liquid inside the walls of the flower. The man was in incredible pain, yet was unable to scream for help. It felt like he had fallen into a deep swamp from which there was no escape!

“Stop it!” Li Hongmei from the Dali Clan yelled furiously in a panic.

Shao Yu did not stop her attack. She was purposely controlling the damage output of the plant to teach the arrogant man a lesson.

However, Li Hongmei was infuriated. She turned into a black shadow and suddenly showed up behind Shao Yu.

Shao Yu immediately cast a Rampart to protect herself after sensing the danger from behind. To everyone’s surprise, Li Ling’s mother, Li Hongmei, furiously used her magic to summon a stone pillar, ramming it into Shao Yu’s back.

The stone pillar was incredibly powerful. It broke Shao Yu’s Rampart into pieces and knocked her flying. She spat out some blood after taking the hit.

“How shameless!” Mu Ningxue was infuriated.

These people of a renowned clan were showing no respect to the people of Fanxue Mountain. It was meant to be a duel, so the participants were clearly not in any danger, yet Li Hongmei still intervened and even hurt Shao Yu!

Mu Ningxue could no longer stand the detestable woman. The temperature began to drop rapidly as countless ice crystals in the shape of cones appeared around her. She fired the ice spikes at Li Hongmei with a wave!

“Mu Ningxue, are you trying to break the rules!?” Elder Lin Ze snapped. His Psychic Impact surged forward like a wave, nullifying Mu Ningxue’s magic.

Mu Ningxue did not force it. She stared at Lin Ze coldly.

“Very well, you didn’t stop Li Hongmei when she hurt my friend, but you’re stopping me when I’m trying to get even with her!” Mu Ningxue realized that the meeting had been purposely held just to pick on Fanxue Mountain!

“Li Hongmei was just worried about her son, yet you are breaking the rules since you’re trying to provoke her!” Lin Ze said.

Li Hongmei had freed Li Ling from the Swallow Blossom. Li Ling was drenched wet in the sticky stuff. His hair and clothes were ragged. He looked completely different from his previous imposing appearance. Some among the crowd even chuckled after seeing his miserable state.

Li Ling trembled in anger. He never thought he would be defeated by a woman so easily!

“Are you alright? Mum will teach her a lesson for you!” Li Hongmei said.

Shao Yu was only minorly injured. She rose to her feet and wiped off the blood by her lips. She giggled and said, “So you’re only a kid who still needs his mother’s protection. No wonder you’re acting so tough even when you’re so useless.”

Li Ling was enraged as soon as he heard the words!

He knocked Li Hongmei’s hand away and snapped, “Again, I was only taken by surprise by your Sound Element!”

“You will be no match for me even after a thousand attempts!” Shao Yu retorted disdainfully.
