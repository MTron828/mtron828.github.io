Chapter 2577: Sent to Death

The White Widow could sense her surroundings through ripples, but that did not include her own body.

The White Widow’s body was a perfect blind spot. Asha’ruiya hid on her back and waited for the perfect opportunity to stab the spider with her rain of swords!

The creature’s body fell into the lake. Her human face and half of its body were still intact.

She swam to the shore and gave the Lord of Darkness a pleading look.

The Lord of Darkness was her only hope. She was hoping the Lord of Darkness would give her another chance, since she had served him for so many years.

“Either way, it’s just a game,” the Lord of Darkness spoke up.

A smile blossomed on the White Widow’s ugly face.

“Therefore, the characters in the game don’t deserve any pity,” the Lord of Darkness added.

The White Widow’s expression immediately shifted.

It would have been better if the Lord of Darkness had kept a cold face.

The Lord of Darkness had to humiliate the White Widow right before her death. She completely lost her mind in despair. She was going to take Asha’ruiya down with her!

Asha’ruiya abruptly stabbed the White Widow through her forehead. The Widow’s body twitched while her face was full of hatred. However, she still could not escape her death.

Asha’ruiya drew out her sword and took a deep breath before looking at the Lord of Darkness.

The Lord of Darkness laughed.

“It seems like I evaluated your strength wrongly. You are more than just a knight,” the Lord of Darkness conceded.

Asha’ruiya bowed deeply to the Lord of Darkness. She said, “You can’t be right all the time!”

“I’ve always made mistakes. I often regret it as soon as I lift my hand off a piece, but I enjoy the game. Every mistake is helping me realize my shortcomings,” the Lord of Darkness said. It was strange to hear a philosophical statement from the Lord of Darkness.

The White Widow was dead!

Asha’ruiya had taken it down!

Mo Fan suddenly recalled the mysterious dark power bursting out of Asha’ruiya’s body during the World College Tournament when she had faced Mu Ningxue.

In the end, she conceded instead of lifting the Seal on her terrifying power.

Mo Fan had no idea what her secret power was, but he was sure that her abilities and her strength had improved significantly after she became a Super Mage and Awakened her Super Power. She was no longer just a Mage. She was more like an unpredictable assassin!

Asha’ruiya stood beside the Black Dragon Emperor. She turned around and looked at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan could see the smug look on her face. Even though she did not open her mouth, he could imagine her saying, “Do you now realize how strong I am?”

Mo Fan generously raised his thumb to Asha’ruiya.

As expected of the woman who had fought Mu Ningxue to a draw! Mu Ningxue had become a powerful Mage, but Asha’ruiya was not to be underestimated, either!

“Lord of Darkness, a lower-level piece has won. I hope you didn’t forget the rule,” Mu Bai reminded him.

“Of course, I shall grant her the Spring of Darkness that will temporarily boost her strength,” the Lord of Darkness agreed.

It would increase Asha’ruiya’s strength by fifty percent, which would give Asha’ruiya a better chance of winning against the enemy knights and bishops.

Most importantly, Asha’ruiya had gone from being in a dangerous position to becoming a sharp sword stabbing at the enemy’s backline by the Black Dragon Emperor’s side. If Mu Bai could move Sharjah deeper into the enemy’s territory, he might be able to take down the enemy queen!

The queen was an important piece in a game of chess. The king’s movements were extremely limited, but the queen could move freely across the board.

While the pieces on the left side of the board were in a stare-down, the Red Spider Lily Queen had taken out three enemy pieces.

“Bishop, cross the border and attack the enemy bishop!” Mu Bai ordered the European man.

The man was a bishop, like Mo Fan. He was on the right side of the board, close to the Red Spider Lily Queen.

Mu Bai was a better player than the Lord of Darkness. He was not going to waste any of his pieces, nor was he going to send others to death just to save himself.

His goal was to save every piece!

Mo Fan was still on standby, but he had a feeling Mu Bai was planning to send him after an important enemy piece soon.

The European was soon fighting the Crimson Scorpion Medusa. As the defender, the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s strength was reduced by thirty percent, giving the European an advantage.

Unfortunately, the outcome was undesirable.

The Lord of Darkness’ restraints on the defending piece slowly wore away over time. The Crimson Scorpion Medusa managed to buy itself enough time with its Petrifying magic and its hypnotizing eyes.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa won the fight in the end. It also grew stronger from the Spring of Darkness.

The Lord of Darkness immediately launched his counterattack. He ended up taking out a few of Mu Bai’s pieces, including Asha’ruiya’s Dark Swordmaster.

Asha’ruiya stared at her Dark Swordmaster’s dead body expressionlessly.

Sacrifices were inevitable in the match. Asha’ruiya did not blame Mu Bai for using her Dark Swordmaster to stop the enemy queen’s attack. She directed all her hatred at Su Lu.

The crazy man was the one that had dragged all of them into this mess. He deserved to die the most in this battle!

“Mo Fan, Su Lu is targeting you,” Mu Bai told him.

“Let me fight him fair and square, since running away isn’t an option,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m very sorry that not everything goes according to plan...” Mu Bai said.

Mu Bai moved the only pawn he had left to the tile in front of Mo Fan to block Su Lu’s path.

The group of a thousand Mages was forced to face Su Lu!

“Are you crazy?”

“You son of a b**ch!”

“Why did you send us to die!?”

The Mages immediately cursed Mu Bai.

Su Lu was able to move diagonally. He was amused when he saw Mu Bai using his pawn to protect Mo Fan.

It was part of human nature. The Mages had completely forgotten who was responsible for dragging them into Hell in the first place. However, they would surely remember the person who had taken away their hope!

“Mu Bai, I never wanted to be a Saint. I can choose to run away myself!” Mo Fan watched the Mages being massacred by Su Lu helplessly.

“Where there is light, there are always shadows.. I always thought I was the light and you were the shadow, but I now realize you are more suitable to be the light,” Mu Bai answered.
