Mo Fan casually strolled through the mansion. Mu Ningxue finally came back from Feiniao City late that night.

Mo Fan took pity on Mu Ningxue when he noticed how worn out she looked. The evil thoughts in his mind were cut down by almost half.

“I have something to give you, but I completely forgot about it last night,” Mo Fan admitted.

“Mm?” Mu Ningxue recalled that Mo Fan did say he had something to give her.

Mo Fan took out the Ward Rock and placed it on Mu Ningxue’s palm.

Mu Ningxue lowered her head. She glanced at the object and asked with a confused look, “Are you pulling a prank on me?”

“What prank... huh, why is this thing here? I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I took the wrong thing!” Mo Fan blurted out awkwardly.

The object on Mu Ningxue’s palm was not the Ward Rock. It was a round eyeball, and to make things worse, the eyeball was spinning around oddly in her hand. Luckily, Mu Ningxue was not that easy to frighten. If it were almost any other woman, they would immediately slap Mo Fan in the face after receiving such a terrifying eyeball.

“I can feel the magic inside it. Where did you find this eyeball?” Mu Ningxue asked him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I almost forgot about it! This is the Burning Evil Eye. I found it at the Sunset Shrine in Cairo. It’s a treasure, too. It can emit a special glow over an area that applies a burning effect to intruders. I haven’t figured out how to use it, but I believe it might be useful if we place it at a crucial spot of our Fanxue Mountain,” Mo Fan declared.

“How about its power?” Mu Ningxue asked, intrigued.

“It’s very powerful. Even a Commander-level creature or an Advanced Mage will be injured by the burn of the evil light if they stay in it for too long,” Mo Fan stated firmly.

“We have a few islands nearby that are rich in resources and materials. Those islands are one of our primary sources of income, but they aren’t located within the safe zone. Sea monsters will invade them at times, so we have to invest a lot of funds into protecting cargo. If this Burning Evil Eye is really that effective, we might be able to use it to drive away the invaders!” Mu Ningxue conjectured.

There was no end to the numbers of sea monsters. They would show up whenever the tide rose, and due to the rising sea level, many islands were now further away from the safe zone, making them more dangerous and more prone to being raided by the sea monsters. It wasn’t just Fanxue Mountain; the other renowned clans were investing a lot of funds into protecting their islands too!

“Are you referring to the Gold Reefs Island?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, the Gold Reefs are extremely important to us. Half of our fighters are stationed at the island in rotations, but not only are the casualties high, we are expending a lot of resources too,” Mu Ningxue told him.

Guarding a mineral-rich island was a strenuous task, especially when it was located in the demon creatures’ territory. Exterminating the demon creatures nearby did not necessarily guarantee the safety of the island. The sea monsters would eventually return in waves, so the defenders had to stay on alert twenty-four hours. Not only was it important to arrange the rotations appropriately, they had to worry about compensation for the casualties too!

The demon creatures were naturally fond of exotic materials, so Gold Reefs Island was more like a miniature battlefield, where battles between the defenders and the demon creatures were constantly taking place.

“I’ll ask Apas if she has any ideas how to deal with the sea monsters,” Mo Fan said.

“If we can free up the men on the Gold Reefs Island, we might be able to clear the woods close to the West Ridge,” Mu Ningxue said.

“You seem very busy,” Mo Fan scratched his head. He was completely unaware of Fanxue Mountain’s situation.

“Mm, I have had a lot of things to do lately. I’m a little worried that my cultivation will lag behind,” Mu Ningxue said.

“I wanted to give you this...” Mo Fan put the Burning Evil Eye away and took out the real Ward Rock.

Mu Ningxue stared at the orb Mo Fan was holding. She had never seen such a special thing before.

The Burning Evil Eye contained the magic of the Curse Element, so she could sense its power when she was close to it, even though it was inactive. It was already a huge surprise for Mu Ningxue, as it might resolve the tricky problem the Gold Reefs Island was facing...

However, the second object that Mo Fan took out was even more reserved. The orb clearly contained a strong energy tightly related to nature within it. She could easily tell it was something extraordinary!

“Do you remember the Earth Pistil?” Mo Fan smiled. He could see Mu Ningxue had no clue what the thing was.

“Mm!” Mu Ningxue would never forget the Earth Pistil. Without its power, there would be no Fanxue Mountain. This land used to be a gray area, since the Magic Association had deemed it unsafe to be inhabited.

No matter how much potential the land had, no one would bother coming here if their safety was not guaranteed. Mu Ningxue obviously remembered the Earth Pistil, the sacred stone with the power to look after a city!

“It might not be as powerful as the Earth Pistil, but it can establish a defense along the coastline, just like the East Maritime Fortress in Japan. Didn’t you want to turn Fanxue Mountain into the safest small city? I believe this thing is going to be very useful,” Mo Fan told her.

Mu Ningxue was stunned. Where exactly did Mo Fan find so many precious and rare artifacts? The Burning Evil Eye was already a huge surprise to her, let alone a Ward Rock!

Both artifacts were considered priceless!

Mu Ningxue lifted her gaze slightly and stared at Mo Fan. Even though she was not filled with joy like she had been pampered, she was still touched by the gifts. At least she knew that the man was sincerely concerned about her.

Mo Fan was waiting for Mu Ningxue to tip her toes and kiss him, but she was simply standing still without shifting her gaze away. Mo Fan ended up running out of patience first.

Oh my, look at her beautiful face! He could play with it for a few lifetimes. He had an urge to press her to the wall and kiss her!

For some reason, he felt a great sense of achievement when smearing his saliva all over that beautiful face. Mo Fan took the impulse to act first. He had completely tossed his pity for Mu Ningxue beyond the topmost clouds. He insisted on not leaving bed until daybreak!

Mu Ningxue was utterly helpless too. She was doing nothing apart from looking at him. Why did he suddenly turn into a beast? How did he even manage to keep his calm in the past?

Mo Fan initially planned to stay at Fanxue Mountain for a while and keep Mu Ningxue company. He was thinking of setting out for the Qinling Mountains the next month, but after breaking through his goddess’ defense, he now had an urge to place an order for his coffin here. He would never leave Fanxue Mountain until the day he had to lie inside it!

Another great dawn came as Mo Fan was lying on the bed. He watched Mu Ningxue put on her clothes and leave. His heart was brimming with satisfaction and a sense of achievement. It had been over ten days since his dream came true, yet his passion and excitement showed no sign of fading away.

Unfortunately, his plan of indulging in his desires every night still came to an end when Mu Ningxue needed to go somewhere else. She had to leave to take care of some matters related to Fanxue Mountain while searching for the remaining pieces of the Ice Crystal Bow.

The Ice Crystal Bow was Mu Ningxue’s chance to achieve the Super Level. The Ice Crystal Bow used to be an icy demon, whipping her and forcing her to pursue higher levels of cultivation. When Mu Ningxue obtained the fragments of the Ice Crystal Bow and acquired Ice Fundamental Crystals for the Ice Crystal Bow, she managed to lift off the seal on the Ice Crystal Bow’s power, greatly improving her cultivation.

As Fanxue Mountain continued to grow, granting her access to the higher levels, she realized how important it was to achieve the Super Level. If she was not strong enough as a leader, Fanxue Mountain would only be treated disdainfully and picked on by others. Too many people were jealous of them. They were waiting for the opportunity to raze it to the ground!

——

Mo Fan had been indulging in his desires for half a month. It was time for him to focus on his breakthrough to the next level, so he decided to set out for the Qinling Mountains early.

The Qinling Mountains had rather complicated terrain. The place was infamous throughout the country because of how dangerous it was. Mo Fan was bringing Lingling, Apas, and Yu Shishi along. He did not feel secure at all.

Yu Shishi’s strength was not particularly outstanding. She could only look after herself if there was any danger. Lingling might have some life-preserving gadgets and tricks to avoid danger, but her safety was not guaranteed in the demon creatures’ territory.

Apas might be strong, but Mo Fan was worried that they might encounter demon creatures who would not fall for her tricks...

Speaking of which, am I really that popular among women? Why am I surrounded by women when I’m out on an adventure... mm, mm, if only they were somewhat stronger. Mo Fan looked at Apas, Yu Shishi, and Lingling while fondling his chin.

Since he was looking for a Totem Beast, he had to ask Zhao Manyan to tag along, too. The two of them had chosen a similar path. If he did not want to achieve the Super Level, he could indulge his secular desires in Magic City for as long as he pleased!

As Mo Fan thought, Zhao Manyan did not hesitate to come along. He arrived at Fanxue Mountain with a strong grudge.

He grunted in displeasure when he saw Mo Fan’s face brimming with bliss. “What the hell are you so happy for?”

“Am I? I’m perfectly normal,” Mo Fan rubbed his forehead.

“Isn’t it obvious? Look at your face, did you actually do something to the little gorgeous snake? Mo Fan, do you seriously have such a strong fetish... well, was it exciting?” Zhao Manyan asked.

Zhao Manyan was just being himself. He could easily tell that Mo Fan’s sexual needs had been well satisfied lately!
