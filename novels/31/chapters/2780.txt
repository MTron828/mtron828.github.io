Chapter 2781: The Goddess of Death—The Black Beauty

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Guards of the Four Directions were drenched in both dried and freshly spilled blood. When the four paved the path by killing the Ocean Demons, they kept their quadrilateral formation. If the other three mates held onto the formation, they would be okay.

Finally, the number of Lizard Demon Dragons ahead of them reduced significantly. They were in a dense tropical rainforest that had not been damaged or developed by humans. Its thick canopy and vines spread toward the sky.

“Where are the others?” The four turned their heads. Even though they had paved a path, most of their teammates had fallen behind.

“Go back and find them!” Bei Shou said as he wiped off the blood stains from his face.

The other three were already on to it. They were severely wounded and had exhausted tremendous mental energy. They thought of catching some breath once they arrived at the rainforest. But before they could celebrate their success, they had to return to the vast Ocean Demon troops once more and find their teammates. They might not come back alive if they went back.

The four briefly made some arrangements. Bei Shou led the team. He held two different colors of Frost Breath. When he fired the blue Frost Breath, it quickly froze a large number of Lizard Demon Dragons. When he fired the white Frost Breath, it crushed the frozen demons.

The other three followed him. They returned to fight the Lizard Demon Dragons Legion.

They did not realize most of the Lizard Demon Dragons had reduced in numbers and were exhausted so soon.

The Lizard Demon Dragons’ cried miserably.There were many Dark Demon Spirits dancing in the sky above the Lizard Demon Dragon Legion.

The Dark Demon Spirits navigated through the Lizard Demon Dragon Legion like a breeze. Whenever the Dark Demon Spirits pierced the Ocean Demons with their claws, the Lizard Demon Dragons’ skins turned pale.

They were sea creatures that lived under the sea. However, their skins turned pale, flaccid, and lost their elasticity as if they could not stand soaking in the water.

There were thousands of Dark Demon Spirits. They shrieked like banshees and swarmed the Ocean Demons like hungry wolves. They were ferocious predators.

Another batch of Lizard Demon Dragons dropped dead. Thousands of carcasses were strewn on the cold ground before strange vines burrowed into their carcasses and sucked them dry.

The ground seemed to have received nourishment from the carcasses as it turned more radiantly red.

“What’s going on?” The Guards of the Four Direction were shocked. They wondered what kind of powerful creature could use the Lizard Demon Dragons as nourishment like this.

A woman in a cloud of dark mist slowly moved on the bewitching land. The areas she passed by were covered with flowers of death. The land lacked life force, and the Dark Demon Spirits had taken over. The land was filled with an air of death. Even so, the Lycoris Sorceress Queen appeared as gorgeous and radiant as ever.

“Deputy Chief!” When Bei Shou saw Ye Mei and the rest of the team, he was delighted.

“Go get them,” said Nan Shou.

No one could stop the Lycoris Sorceress Queen. She killed more Lizard Demon Dragons than the Black Totem Snake. She was born to fight in the war. Her strength continued to advance as the battle progressed, and she enjoyed the sight of the blood-splattered place.

Ye Mei, Jiang Yu, Li Que, Wang Ping, and the rest of the Royal Mages followed behind the Lycoris Sorceress Queen. The Guards of the Four Directions were joyous to see their teammates all safe and sound.

All of them were not dead yet. They had assumed they were going to die here and would never return to the palace. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Go to the tropical rainforest and hide,” Ye Mei said to the crowd as she turned to look behind her. She noticed that the Lizard Demon Dragon Legion no longer had the guts to chase after them.

The Lycoris Sorceress Queen did not follow them. She was like a standalone black beauty in the middle of the radiant red sea flower. The Dark Demon Spirits danced around her like moths.

The Lizard Demon Dragon Legion combined with several Blue-haired Female Demons once again. They worked together to form a strong tidal wave of destruction against the humans. However, they lost the courage to chase after them in the face of the Lycoris Sorceress Queen whose crimson flowers blossomed endlessly.

The Ocean Demons watched wide-eyed as the humans disappeared into the tropical rainforest.

...

When they entered the rainforest, the lush greenery was so dense that it provided them with a natural coverage. Several of them were Plant Element experts, hence they were very familiar with the floras. The moment they escaped into the rainforest; they had entered into a natural kingdom devoid of demons. Even if the Ocean Demons caught up with them, they could use the natural force to counterattack the Ocean Demons.

“Ming Zhu, Guan Dong, and Tang Liqing haven’t come yet,” said Ye Mei.

“Even while the Chief battles the Eight-headed Serpent, he finds time to summon a Dark Elf Queen to pave the path for us. I wonder if the Chief…” Bei Shou heaved a long sigh. His eyes were filled with sadness.

“We have to find Commander Hua. We can’t let the Chief down…” Ye Mei clenched her fists.

Everyone was silent, as if they were mourning for Pang Lai. The atmosphere was heavy.

Jiang Yu looked at the crowd. “Master Pang Lai isn’t dead yet. Besides, he’s not the one who summoned the Lycoris Sorceress Queen.”

The crowd turned to Jiang Yu.

“How is that possible?”

“That’s right. The Chief is the most powerful Summoning Element mage in this country. Who else can summon the Lycoris Sorceress Queen from the Dark Plane, if not him?” Ye Mei was puzzled.

Ye Mei had been following the Guard of the Four Directions. When she noticed someone had fallen behind the team, she returned to them to help. They had separated from the Guard of the Four Directions, unfortunately.

By the time she reunited with Jiang Yu, Wang Ping, Li Que, and the rest of the Royal Mages, the Lycoris Sorceress Queen was on a killing spree. Ye Mei had assumed that Pang Lai had summoned the powerful creature.

Pang Lai was the Chief Royal Guard, and he was known for his powerful Summoning Element magical power. Only Pang Lai and a few Apex-grade mages could summon the Lycoris Sorceress Queen in the country.

“Mo Fan is the one who summoned it,” said Li Que. He was severely wounded and was in agony. He never wanted to burden his teammates. He had expected that he would end up dead and yet, he had survived.

It hadn’t been luck. It was Mo Fan. He had granted him a chance at survival.

“Mo Fan is the one who summoned her?”

“How did he summon the Lycoris Sorceress Queen?”

The crowd was shocked. They stared at Li Que and Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu nodded. “Yes, he’s the one who summoned her.”

“Where is he now?” Ye Mei asked anxiously.
