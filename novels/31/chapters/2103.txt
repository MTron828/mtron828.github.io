Chapter 2106: The Same Blessing of the God’s Seal

The Shadow Element mainly focused on a single target to overwhelm it with pressure and fear. The crowd would only see the target being devoured by darkness, but have no idea what was going on inside it.

The Lightning Element was different. It danced blatantly above the crowd. Their eardrums almost burst from the lightning’s deafening rumbles as it descended from the sky. It would produce terrifying sparks whenever it came into contact with bigger particles in the air and leave behind a burnt odor. Even Mages with weaker cultivation felt threatened, let alone ordinary people!

Mo Fan’s earlier speech had indeed angered the crowd. Anyone with a rational mind would not antagonize the public, but the crowd now received a dangerous signal when they looked at Mo Fan.

They had to stay as far away from him as possible!

The Vice Mayor had made the necessary arrangements, placing a Barrier between the battlefield and the spectators. The Barrier would only activate if the energy of the duel had gone out of control to protect the spectators. After all, the cost of activating the Barrier was counted by the second!

As Mo Fan’s Lightning continued to grow stronger, the Barrier, which was capable of assessing the danger level automatically, began emitting a faint green light to protect the crowd, rising over them like a transparent umbrella!

“This is insane! I feel like the Lightning is going to blast us into pieces if there wasn’t a Barrier in front of us!” a student Intermediate Mage yelped.

He was also a Lightning Mage, but Mo Fan’s Lightning was the true definition of lightning striking. Their Lightning was only the scale of static charges in comparison! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Leaving aside what he said, I think it’s fair to call him the strongest Lightning Mage!” someone exclaimed.

Mo Fan was indeed worthy to be called the strongest Lightning Mage after the Blessing of the God’s Seal. Zu Xiangtian was wary of Mo Fan’s Lightning Element, too!

“Frame of Wind Shield!”

Zu Xiangtian began controlling the Blazing White Gusts when he sensed a strong Lightning Magic accumulating above him.

The solid winds combined into shields in the form of whirlwinds. They were around the size of a handheld shield, but there were over a hundred of them, orbiting around Zu Xiangtian while picking up speed. They gradually formed a huge white Barrier Dome around Zu Xiangtian!

“Any defense is mere decoration before me. Stop wasting your energy, Zu Xiangtian!” Mo Fan called out proudly.

“Enough talking, show me your real strength!” Zu Xiangtian sneered back.

Mo Fan grinned.

Defense? Did Zu Xiangtian seriously choose to just defend himself?

He must have hit his head on a wall!

“Didn’t the person who gave you my information tell you the only way to win against me was not giving me any chance to use my magic? It would be the end if I used my spells?” Mo Fan called out smugly.

“Perhaps you are treating this as a fight between primary school kids! Your Lightning Tyrant is no match for my Blazing White Gusts!” Zu Xiangtian declared confidently.

“Now that you reminded me, it’s been a long time since I found a nice punching bag!” Mo Fan grinned.

Mo Fan had plenty of time to accumulate his magic after his opponent chose a defensive approach. The Lightning Element’s biggest weakness was that it needed time to accumulate its energy, like charging a piece of machinery.

“Lightning Crow!”

Mo Fan constructed a full Star Palace with Star Constellations. The spell he was Channeling needed the energy provided by a Star Palace. His Lightning Magic was even scarier once the Lightning Palace was constructed!

Dark lightning fell from the stormy clouds like crows, which spread their wings like lightning forking. More lightning appeared, as if a flock of birds was migrating below the clouds.

These lightning crows were made up of thousands of lightning bolts. Their brilliance washed the clouds white. The gloomy fortress and sea were both lit up by the blinding light!

As Mo Fan waved his hand, the lightning crows plunged at Zu Xiangtian like they had finally found meat after starving for a long time!

These lightning crows did not possess any intelligence. Mo Fan was treating them as a flock of suicide bombers, each one delivering a destructive blow!

When the first lightning crow hit its target, the voltage spread through the air like a spiderweb. As more lightning crows came down, the lightning web grew big enough to cover half the fortress!

The water had already disappeared, leaving a huge hole in the surface of the sea. The buildings were scorched and razed to the ground. The whole area from the Floating Reefs Battleground to the buildings, including an area a hundred meters across in the sea, was scattered by destructive lightning feathers!

Zu Xiangtian’s eyes widened when he saw his shields dissipating. He felt like a castle covered in steel, yet still failing to withstand the blows from his enemy’s suicide squad. Even the strongest defense he could muster was slowly being peeled away by the continuous blasts!

“Your Lightning...” Zu Xiangtian skidded backwards. The Blazing White Gusts had endured through a lot of damage from the lightning, but black smoke was now rising from wounds on his chest, arms, and legs!

“How is it possible for your Lightning to be so powerful!?” Zu Xiangtian’s hair was disheveled too, and he was coughing out black smoke as he swore.

“My Blazing White Gusts isn’t any weaker than your Lightning Tyrant! My cultivation is stronger too, so how did your Lightning break through my defense!?” Zu Xiangtian exclaimed in disbelief.

Zu Xiangtian had chosen a defensive approach because he was confident in his Blazing White Gusts!

The Frame of Wind Shield was Zu Xiangtian’s strongest defensive spell. He had compared it to the spells of many Earth Mages and Light Mages, and it turned out that his defense was sturdier!

Even though the Lightning Element was known for its ability to penetrate defenses, that only applied to metal and solid objects. His whirling shields could not be penetrated, so they did not have any weaknesses!

What exactly was the reason that Mo Fan’s Lightning had broken through the defensive spell that he was so proud of?

“Don’t you already know the reason? Both your Wind Magic and my Lightning Magic have received the Blessing of the God’s Seal!” Mo Fan was not in a rush to attack. He patiently explained to Zu Xiangtian, “But the Blessing of the God’s Seal is also based on how good-looking a person is. A righteous and handsome man like me will receive a stronger Blessing. The Blessing of the God’s Seal I received is twice as strong as yours!”

Mo Fan blatantly told Zu Xiangtian the multiplier of his Lightning Magic’s base damage. It was not really a secret.

He was basically saying, My Lightning is stronger than your Wind. How do you feel about that!?
