“Similarly, it’s just a matter of a thought if I want you and your moths dead. There’s really no need to think there’s a purpose behind everything. You and your moths are weak and petty, like a bunch of annoying bugs. If you really want to survive in this world, you should stop doing stupid stuff and overestimating yourself. It will only speed up your destruction!” Houndman said.

Houndman’s eyes glittered after finishing the sentence. The Dreadful Curse Hell Hound that was in tune with his thoughts immediately let out a deadly breath at the moths blocking its path!

The deadly breath landed on the blue moths and soon corroded them away while applying a foul stench to them. They slowly fell onto the surface of the pond like nasal mucus...

The moth’s limited numbers could not hold their place any longer facing both the golden flames and the deadly breath at the same time. A part of the Moon Moth Phoenix’s cocoon was soon exposed.

Houndman and Zeng Guanglie grinned disdainfully. They immediately ordered their men to break the remaining silk strands so they could take the cocoon away!

An icy wind blew from the woods and swept right at Zeng Guanglie and Houndman. The trunks of the trees nearby that were cut in half and fell on them!

Houndman’s Dreadful Curse Hell Hound reacted quickly. It jumped in front of them and used its body to resist the deadly gust of wind.

Lots of trees fell to the ground, while the droplets of water scattered across the air. Houndman looked up at the shadow in the canopy and saw a woman with silver-hair shining under the moonlight descending slowly. She was wearing an ivory dress down to her knees, revealing her smooth and tender shins, as she was not wearing stockings. They were slim, but not overly skinny!

“It’s you again!” Houndman’s face was filled with rage when he saw Mu Ningxue. One of his Dreadful Curse Hell Hounds had died at the hands of this woman and Mo Fan not long ago!

Zeng Guanglie glared at Mu Ningxue, too. The woman was no weaker than him, and her Nirvana Ice Domain was incredibly powerful. The water on the ground slowly froze. Even Zeng Guanglie’s golden flames were put out by the ice and the snow!

“It looks like she’s alone...” Ke Lingxi quickly noticed that Mo Fan was not around. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Houndman also noticed that. He harrumphed coldly and said, “We are no longer in your territory! If you dare to intervene with our business again, you better watch out for the paltry reputation you’ve finally earned after putting in so much work. The person behind us can destroy it with just a few words, and you’ll have no choice but to go back to your Mu Clan like a petty b**ch!”

Mu Ningxue’s expression did not change much after hearing the words. She had gotten used to being humiliated verbally. She was not Mo Fan, who could always come up with words that sounded ten times worse than what people were saying to him before beating the crap out of them.

Mu Ningxue was used to only doing the last part of it, beating the crap out of them!

“Sticky Ice Freezing Aura!”

The frost in the air gradually grew thicker. Not only did the water of the pond turn into ice, the whole woods had turned into an icy forest. A visible frosty aura was rising around Zeng Guanglie and Houndman under the overwhelming presence of the Nirvana Ice Domain!

The frosty aura formed clingy pieces of ice. They rapidly flew at their targets, attaching themselves to the other ice pieces to thicken the rime further and increase the pace of freezing everything around them.

The Dreadful Curse Hell Hound was soon covered by the frost. Both Zeng Guanglie and Houndman immediately fled for their lives, worried they would turn into ice statues in the frosty aura. They simply left the Dreadful Curse Hell Hound to resist the frosty aura alone.

“Absolute Kingdom of Ice!” Mu Ningxue cast. Her outstanding control of the Ice Element allowed her to cast Ice Magic in any form as she wished. She no longer needed to draw Magic Patterns just to cast her spells.

White snow fell rapidly from a sky fully filled with Ice Magic. The Sticky Ice Freezing Aura was pulling the snow toward it like magnets. The ice that Mu Ningxue’s Ice Domain had just produced immediately piled on the frosty aura. The Dreadful Curse Hell Hound covered in clinging rime soon turned into a giant ball of ice!

Mu Ningxue was not just freezing the Dreadful Curse Hell Hound. The rime also flew at the giant cocoon and formed a layer of protection around the moths and the giant cocoon.

Mu Ningxue could easily tell that Yu Shishi’s heart was bleeding when she witnessed the deaths of each moth. It was her turn to save the woman from her sense of helplessness!

“Damn it, do you really think I’m just a little underling you can crush as you please!? If my ritual wasn’t on cooldown last time, there’s no way you and that kid would stand a chance against me. Since you keep asking for it, I’ll show you the true strength of the Dreadful Curse Hell Hound!” Houndman proclaimed furiously.

The woman had shown up before he even took the initiative to get his revenge on her. This time, not only was Houndman going to get his revenge, he would let the woman know that he was not someone she wanted to mess with!

Houndman started drawing a strange Star Pattern that had an odd color to it, as if it was the combination of the colors of a few different Elements. It soon formed strange runes and patterns on the ice to conduct a Summoning ritual!

The pattern was completed in no time. A strong sense of death burst out from it. Even the presence of Mu Ningxue’s Nirvana Ice Domain weakened slightly under it.

“Hell Forge!” Houndman shrieked and withdrew the frozen Dreadful Curse Hell Hound back into the ritual.

If they looked down from high above, they would have noticed that the pattern of the ritual actually resembled the opening of a furnace. The Dreadful Curse Hell Hound was being tossed right into it.

Zeng Guanglie gasped when he saw two other Dreadful Curse Hell Hounds inside the forge. The creatures were being torn into pieces, but their heads, limbs, bodies, organs, and fangs were slowly joining together!

Three heads were connected to a single sturdy neck. The Dreadful Curse Hell Hounds had turned into a three-headed hellish creature! The cruel process gave the creature a painful, hateful, and murderous aura even before its form was completed!
