“Who is this guy?” a sharp voice asked from behind the monument.

“Damn it, why is he here? He’s Mo Fan, that idiot’s friend. I suggest we take him down first. If Fang Gu realizes that we’re setting up an ambush here for him, we’ll have trouble tracking him down again,” replied another voice.

“Just kill him, I don’t have time to waste on a little shrimp who lost his way,” said the sharp voice coldly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What about the girl beside him?”

“I’ll leave her to you, but focus on the matter on hand first!”

“Thanks!” the man was restless from the excitement.

——

Su Xiaoluo and Zhang Xiaohou both saw Mo Fan and Liu Ru walking toward them. It went without saying that they knew the two were walking right into a trap. They tried their very best to warn them, yet they could not utter a single word, as their minds were sealed off.

Finally, as the two reached the monument, Chief Xie Sang received them with a smile.

Liu Ru felt disgusted when she saw Xie Sang’s expression. She had no idea where the guy got his courage from to still smile at her like that. She was suspicious that he was an underling of the Black Vatican.

“So it’s you, that scared us. Fang Gu has been trying to hunt us down...” said Xie Sang.

“Chief, you’re not a good man,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Not a good man, what do you mean?” The chief was startled.

“You’ve been hiding something from us all along. If it weren’t for my brother, I wouldn’t even bother saving your village, yet not only weren’t you grateful, you even colluded with those assholes...” Mo Fan’s smile gradually turned into a cold grin.

Xie Sang’s face was blank, before he spoke after a slight hesitation, “I...I had no other choice.”

“Do it!” a sharp voice commanded from the dense shrubs. The atmosphere turned murderous, as an icy breeze swept past!

A pungent smell assailed their nostrils, like the breeze coming out of a cave that was stacked with rotten meat, feces and corpses; it was utterly disgusting.

A pack of Dark Beast Monsters crawled out from both sides. There were between seventy to eighty of them. They had odd shapes, with only skin and bones. Their tongues were eerily red and long, while their eyes were filled with greed and hatred, like devils from Hell. These Dark Beast Monsters were most likely related to the undead by blood, judging from their ghastly appearance!

“How disgusting,” Liu Ru twisted her lips, her face utterly disgusted.

Many kinds of demon creatures were already ugly and savage, yet they were relatively adorable compared to these Dark Beast Monsters, especially in a situation where they were crawling out in such huge numbers. If she were still the little girl of the past, she would have instantly fainted upon seeing this!

“They used to be humans, but now they were only a bunch of fallen spirits willing to be ordered around like dogs, doing evil things together with their asshole masters,” explained Mo Fan to Liu Ru calmly.

“We should just cleanse something like these together with their souls,” said Liu Ru.

“Kekeke, very precise, it seems like you’re quite familiar with our Black Vatican. Now, if you know how we do things, you should stop resisting so we can tie you up, just so you won’t scare our fish away. If everything goes successfully, maybe I will spare your lives?” the sharp voice spoke once again.

Behind the monument, a woman in dark red mink coat walked out. The coat was so long that it had almost reached the ground.

Despite the cold weather, the mink coat was fairly exposed, revealing long legs covered in red stockings. The heels she was wearing were so sharp that they could almost poke a hole in the tiles of the monument!

The woman was wearing a veil to cover her face.

However, Mo Fan learned something when he saw the woman in the veil. Not every woman wearing a veil was a goddess. Compared to the mixed-blooded angel Ye Meng’e whom he shared a journey together with for a few days, this woman in the dark red mink coat was actually made of a pile of ostrich poop.

“Hey, uncle from the countryside, can you stop playing a transgender role, luckily you have the veil on your face, or else I think I would be vomiting now... I think you should stop being the Black Vatican’s underling. You can start streaming and earn a living by fooling some idiots online,” said Mo Fan.

As soon as his words were spoken, it felt like the air had frozen!

Frost began to cover the thick layer of foundation on the woman’s face, which could easily poke Mo Fan to death when it was scraped off!

The woman in the mink coat had seven Black Clergy standing close to her. They were all wearing black outfits, each wearing a Curse mark that looked like it was crawling with cockroaches and centipedes. The marks were fairly deep; it was obvious that these Cursed Beasts were stronger than the ones Mo Fan had stumbled into in the past!

As the woman unleashed her murderous aura, the seven Cursed Beasts subconsciously moved further away from her. It was clear that they were utterly terrified of the woman.

“Kid, you’re going to use the rest of your life to regret what you’ve just said!” the icy voice of the woman in the mink coat spat. Even the raindrops were turning into ice.

“The truth is always unbearable, you just need some time to get used to it. I bet your men have already gotten used to your appearance after vomiting a few times,” said Mo Fan.

“Take him down, I want him alive, and try not to make a mess here!” demanded the woman murderously.

Mo Fan said to Liu Ru in a similarly disdainful tone when he saw the female deacon giving the order, “Kill’em all, help their souls to find peace. We should accumulate some merit for our next life, so we won’t have a ghastly appearance like hers.”

The woman’s heels stumbled slightly. She almost could not resist the urge to tear Mo Fan to pieces with her own hands.

This reckless idiot; she was promoted to Blue Deacon just recently because of how vicious and cruel she was!

She stared at Mo Fan coldly, yet she did not attack.

The seven Black Clergy and the huge number of Dark Beasts were more than enough to take care of the kid!

Mo Fan did not move either. His eyes stared right into the woman’s eyes. The slight grin on his face was clearly showing his disgust and hatred toward the ugly woman, who looked like a skinny old man playing a transgender role.

Chief Xie Sang was in a total panic. He spoke to Mo Fan in a trembling voice, “How reckless are you, she’s a Blue Deacon of the Black Vatican! ...you have no business here, why did you have to barge in, you’re going to place my villagers in danger!

“Yeah, you should just listen to her. We are all dragged into the mess now. She’s trying to catch Fang Gu, and Fang Gu is trying to kill us...she’s helping us!” blurted out Li Kai.

“Don’t make it worse for us, just leave!”

Mo Fan was not angry when he heard the scoldings from the villagers.

They were nothing but a bunch of idiots. Based on the Black Vatican’s usual behavior, once they captured Fang Gu, the villagers who were lucky would be killed on the spot, while the unlucky ones would be turned into more of the Dark Beasts that were crawling on the ground!

However, Mo Fan was indeed quite surprised. This ugly, old woman turned out to be a Blue Deacon, a subordinate under Salan’s command!

Mo Fan was tired of killing only the useless people of the Black Vatican.

The Black Vatican had treated Bo City like a city of white mice, so Mo Fan did not see them as humans, either.

Right on time, the deceased of the Calamity of Bo City needed a sacrifice...

A Blue Deacon was worthy enough to be slain as a sacrificial pig or lamb!
