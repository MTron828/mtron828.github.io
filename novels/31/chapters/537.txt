“Hey, I have just arrived, but I saw that girl crying; do you mind telling me what happened?”

Ding Yumian was focused on the match when a polite yet deep voice spoke up behind her. Ding Yumian initially thought it was someone trying to start a conversation with her using the topic. She always found herself in similar situations, yet when she turned around, she did not see any hint of what she had assumed from the person’s eyes, so she proceeded to tell him what had gone on.

Ding Yumian knew if a man was trying to pick her up, yet the man talking to her had a weird gaze... it had a determination and coldness that did not belong to someone of his age.

“I see, thanks.” The man fell silent after listening to Ding Yumian’s rough explanation.

As he placed his attention on the match, Ding Yumian no longer felt his existence, as if he had turned into a black statue.

Ding Yumian ignored him and focused on the match.

Mo Fan was still facing a problem, which was the Giant Shadow Spikes hiding somewhere in the dueling ground...

The Giant Shadow Spike could be deadly. It was the strongest imprisoning Spell among all Intermediate Spells, but it was tricky to land the attack accurately. Many experienced people would avoid the places covered in shadows, giving them enough time to dodge the Giant Shadow Spikes when they showed up.

However, Ding Yumian was clearly aware that a true expert would not rely on the Giant Shadow Spike to overwhelm their opponent, but would use it more to pin them down...

Now!

—

Mo Fan was surrounded by flickers of lightning; the sound they made was enough to send a chill down his opponent’s spine.

Since he wielded the Lightning Seed Qianjun, if Mo Fan was given a chance to cast the third-tier Thunderbolt, Wild Strikes, Xu Mingcong’s team would suffer severe damage, as on top of defensive Spells, they would be forced to use their defensive equipment too!

After all, the Spell was the strongest destructive Spell in the Intermediate Level; no one would dare to underestimate its power.

However, as Mo Fan was close to finishing the Star Pattern under his teammates’ cover, a sharp spike burst out from the shadow under the frost and flew right at him!

“The Water Barrier won’t be able to stop it, watch out!” said Li Jie to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan knew Ai Tutu had already used Light Protection on Liu Xing to protect her from the Ice Lock. He seemed well prepared for the attack, who instantly withdrawing the half-completed Star Pattern and hopping back nimbly, dodging the rather obvious Giant Shadow Spike.

“Running out of patience already?” Mo Fan asked with a mocking smile.

A Giant Shadow Spike was different than other Spells. It was not readily available after completing the Star Pattern. Therefore, once he dodged all three of the spikes, the threat that Xu Mingcong posed to him would be cut in half.

“It’s not a waste if it stopped your Lightning Star Pattern!” Xu Mingcong burst into laughter too. However, the smile on his face did not seem relaxed; he had just discovered that Mo Fan’s attack was a level higher than Gu Jian!

Following that thought, Xu Mingcong’s eyes glittered in the middle of his words!

The second spike was fired as soon as Mo Fan dodged the first one.

Even though the Giant Shadow Spike was effective when used to pin down an enemy, it would basically put an end to the battle if he managed to land it. Xu Mingcong was hoping to defeat Mo Fan as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, Mo Fan was already keeping an eye out for the second spike, while Xu Mingcong thought he had fired at the perfect time. Mo Fan had described his opponent as impatient not because he was in a rush to disrupt his Lightning Star Pattern, but for the fact that he was expending two of the spikes in a row!

As a Shadow Magician, Mo Fan’s familiarity with using the shadows around him was not any weaker than Xu Mingcong. He knew that his opponent was not only trying to interrupt his channeling...

A burst of flame ignited on Mo Fan’s palm, which he threw straight into the air.

The light from the fire quickly exposed the shadow spike that was flying at him rapidly, significantly weakening its power

Once Mo Fan was able to see its path, it was fairly easy to dodge it. He simply stepped aside and let the second spike fly past him!

“You’ve got your final spike left. Do use it wisely... of course, I’ll be quite speechless if you use it to disrupt my next Spell,” Mo Fan backed off slightly, allowing Li Jie to cover him with both Water and Ice Elements.

New stars began to appear around Mo Fan’s figure, which began to glow in the color of the moon with a presence that did not originate from this world.

The stars were aligned rapidly, tearing the space apart...

“That guy is trying to Summon!” said the slightly plump woman.

“Crap, I totally forgot his Double Innate Elements!” cursed Xu Mingcong.

After learning that their opponent was Mo Fan, they were not too surprised by his Double Innate Elements, yet when they actually fought against him, they were extremely irritated by it.

Xu Mingcong only had the last shadow spike left. Using it to interrupt the channeling of a Basic Spell would be overkilling it, yet even if he succeeded, Mo Fan could simply cast the Spell again, since it was only a Basic Spell!

Despite the Spell being only at the Basic Level, Mo Fan had Summoned the Swift Star Wolf, a Summoned Beast whose strength was just below an average Warrior-level creature!

Close combat had always been most Magicians’ weakness. The Swift Star Wolf was not strong enough to dominate among Warrior-level creatures, yet he was more than enough to keep a student in the top twenty busy! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“My Swift Star Wolf is proud of his speed, too! You can have some fun with him,” Mo Fan said from in the middle of the team. He fondled the Swift Star Wolf’s hair with a smile.

The Swift Star Wolf was very excited. As long as he was not Summoned to fight the Flame Belle, he was still his usual ferocious self.

The Swift Star Wolf had spent a long time with Mo Fan, so he had also become as cunning as a fox. He knew that his master was fighting against strong opponents, and each had the ability to face a Warrior-level creature on their own, so he did not make a move impatiently. He ran to the side with his outstanding speed, waiting to strike when his targets lowered their guard!

Just a moment ago, Xu Mingcong’s Giant Shadow Spike was targeting Mo Fan’s team in the dark, forcing them to be alert at all times.

Now, the tables had turned. Duels usually consisted of nullifying the Spells between opponents, yet a Warrior-level creature had suddenly joined the battle. His presence was a lot more intimidating than a Giant Shadow Spike. As soon as their defense crumbled, or they lowered their guard slightly, the Swift Star Wolf would lunge at them instantly!

“I’ve always hated the Summoning Element!” swore the muscular student with the Earth Element.

Not only was the guy’s Basic Spell half as powerful as an Intermediate Spell, and he possessed the destructive Lightning Element, he had even Summoned a wolf out to secure the upper hand by abusing their numbers!
