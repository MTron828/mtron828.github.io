Mo Fan was not familiar with the incident, but after seeing how thrilled Zhao Manyan was while explaining the incident to him, he believed it must have shocked the world.

Every Red Cardinal was guilty of monstrous crimes. If not, they would not be wanted by every organization in the world!

“That’s good news then! Isn’t it awesome that they caught the Red Cardinal of Brazil!?” Mo Fan asked.

“That’s right! Brazil is celebrating like they are having a festival. I bet the hatred in the Cursed Rainforest might finally dissipate by half,” Zhao Manyan agreed.

“It’s a pity that it wasn’t Salan. Otherwise, it would be like New Years in China!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“Either way, it’s still a huge breakthrough! Two Red Cardinals have fallen into our hands. I bet even Salan has her tail between her legs now. She wouldn’t dare to do anything reckless,” Zhao Manyan proclaimed.

Mo Fan nodded. It was indeed great news for them. He wondered who the person that had caught the Red Cardinal of Brazil was!

“By the way, Jiang Shaoxu says she’s almost ready. She will be looking for the Totem Beasts together with us!” Zhao Manyan said.

“That fast?” Mo Fan murmured in amazement.

“Quick my ass, both you and Mu Bai have already achieved the Super Level! You will soon learn how to cast a Super Spell, but I’m still stuck with these useless spells like a bumpkin! How am I supposed to live like this!?” Zhao Manyan complained.

Zhao Manyan was obviously very eager, especially since Mu Bai had achieved the Super Level faster than him. He still could not let it go.

“Fine, we’ll set out after they are ready...” Mo Fan had just finished when someone else knocked on the door.

He bet Apas had leaked the news that he had returned to the Magic City. He would not even have a chance to catch his breath if people kept visiting him!

The door opened. A little beauty with ponytails stood there. Her head only reached Mo Fan’s jaw. Her petite figure gave him the urge to pick her up and pinch her face.

“Little Lingling!” Mo Fan opened his arms to give her a passionate hug.

Lingling already knew Mo Fan was going to take advantage of her. She nimbly crouched and deftly swept past under Mo Fan arms to go inside the room. Her adorable face had an indifferent look, as if she had been through all the vicissitudes of life.

“Hehe, you knew I had come back already?” Mo Fan smiled.

“Something serious happened, but the two of you don’t seem to have any clues yet?” Lingling looked at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Oh, we do, Zhao Manyan just told me about it. Are you referring to the Red Cardinal of Brazil, Asura, being arrested? It’s definitely something worth celebrating. Should we pay our respect to the Holy Judgment Court by exterminating five kilograms of lobsters tonight?” Mo Fan was a little starved.

“That was three days ago,” Lingling said.

“So what happened today?” Mo Fan was surprised.

“I just heard it from my grandfather, the old Clergyman. Around five in the morning today, the Cold Prince escaped from the Holy Judgment Court’s dungeon!” Lingling said.

“The Cold Prince?” Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were startled.

“He escaped!” Lingling repeated.

“F**k me, you’re telling me that little androgynous demon has escaped? Are the brains of the people from the Holy Judgment Court filled with pig dung? Didn’t they say they had the sturdiest prison in the world? That’s a Red Cardinal, the Cold Prince we worked so damn hard to catch, and now they let him escape? Screw the Holy Judgment Court!” Zhao Manyan cursed continuously. He almost smashed everything in front of him to the ground.

Zhao Manyan had been through the whole incident at Beijiang. Not only did the people who stayed at the Northguard Fortress fight against a Red Cardinal, they had fended off an entire kingdom of undead without any backup. They risked their lives to defend Beijiang and capture the Cold Prince alive. The Holy Judgment Court was shameless enough to demand China hand the Cold Prince over so they could claim the merits, but now the criminal had escaped!

“Lingling, can you explain what actually happened? I bet the Holy Judgment Court hasn’t disclosed the Cold Prince’s escape to the public yet, right?” Mo Fan frowned harshly.

“Correct, the Holy Court Mages haven’t disclosed it. I only heard something about it from my grandfather. I believe he wanted me to inform you. Around three days ago, the Red Cardinal of Brazil, Asura, was caught. On the same day, the Holy Court Mages sent more than half of their Holy Court Mages to escort Asura to the Holy Judgment Court in case something happened along the way. After all, the Black Vatican has infiltrated almost every organization. The journey was quite smooth, so they were able to escort the Red Cardinal into the Holy Judgment Court’s dungeon with ease,” Lingling said.

“What does that have anything to do with the Cold Prince’s escape?” Mo Fan was confused.

“That’s where the problem started. The trick that the Black Vatican used to help the Cold Prince escape was simply to... I don’t even know how to describe it. The truth is, the dungeon in which the Cold Prince was locked has seven layers of magic Formations. It’s easily the sturdiest cell in the dungeon. There’s no way to open it while it’s holding a criminal like the Cold Prince in custody. Only the Holy Judgment Court can open it,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan frowned. He instantly noticed where something could go wrong. He blurted out before Lingling could finish, “There’s another time when the cell will open: when they catch another Red Cardinal!”

“Exactly!” Lingling nodded. “The people of the Holy Judgment Court were only able to find Asura because the Cold Prince exposed his identity and whereabouts. The Seven-Layered Cell was the only safe place to lock up a Red Cardinal!”

“So Asura is still inside?” Mo Fan asked.

“He is, but the Cold Prince has escaped!”

“Trading one Red Cardinal for the other... is the Black Vatican out of their mind?” Zhao Manyan wondered.

Mo Fan shook his head and swore, “Unless the Cold Prince is a lot more important than the Red Cardinal of Brazil.”

“That’s true!” Zhao Manyan admitted.

“Why would they do that?” Mo Fan looked at Lingling. The girl must have noticed something.

“The Black Vatican was worried that the Cold Prince might leak some important information to the Holy Judgment Court when he was being interrogated. If they are willing to trade a Red Cardinal for the Cold Prince, it means the Cold Prince is extremely important to them... or perhaps, the Cold Prince might know who the mysterious Supreme Pontiff is!” Lingling said.

“The Black Vatican’s Supreme Pontiff!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed. The title itself was enough to send chills down a person’s spine.

The mastermind of the Black Vatican, above and behind the seven Red Cardinals: the Supreme Pontiff!

Even now, the Holy Judgment Court was still unsure the Supreme Pontiff actually existed!
