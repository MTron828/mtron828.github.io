How inhumane was that Wen Xia? How could she ask a female student to do something so dangerous?

Mo Fan let out a sigh. If Tao Jing was going to risk her life, chances were she was going to die because of it. After all, she was only an Intermediate Mage. Her physical traits and ability to react according to circumstances were inferior to his.

“I’m f**king doing everything for my country!” Mo Fan cursed. He decided to turn back in the end.

Wen Xia was overjoyed when she saw Mo Fan. “You changed your mind!”

“You’re seriously crossing the line. How could you ask that girl to sacrifice herself?” Mo Fan said angrily.

“I don’t know her. She was bringing a group of people to the clock tower to seek shelter, but the Black-Silver Rock Demon found her. Everyone began to flee for their lives, but she was caught by the Black-Silver Rock Demon after being cornered,” Wen Xia immediately refuted him.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was extremely greedy. It was planning to capture a few more Mages before feasting on them, giving Tao Jing some extra time.

“Save the woman, I’ll be the bait,” Mo Fan said.

“Not a problem, you’re acting more like a man now!” Wen Xia agreed happily.

Wen Xia did not waste any more time, and quickly jumped onto a building, a brown Star Constellation rapidly forming around her. From the strange glow of her magic and the unique aura of rocks circling her, Mo Fan could tell that she had a Soul-grade Earth Seed, one with a powerful Domain.

Her eyes glowed brilliantly, increasing the number of rocks circling her. These jagged rocks sprang at the Black-Silver Rock Demon after Wen Xia waved her hand!

Wen Xia was targeting the arm that was holding Tao Jing. A huge area on the arm began to crack apart. Tao Jing was also sent flying like a leaf drifting in the wind.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon completely ignored the little prey it had lost. Its glittering eyes stared at Wen Xia.

The strength of the Mud Morphing Monsters not only increased with the number of humans they absorbed, but the energy level of the Mages, too! Their strength would improve greatly after absorbing high-level Mages. The Research Union did conclude that these Mud Morphing Monsters were draining the energy inside the Mages’ bodies.

The energy of an Advanced Mage was obviously greater than that of an Intermediate Mage. This Black-Silver Rock Demon was born after a Mud Morphing Monster absorbed an Advanced Mage. Therefore, it could only grow stronger and bigger by devouring Mages at the Advanced Level or higher.

A Mage like Wen Xia was the real main dish for the Black-Silver Rock Demon. An Intermediate Mage like Tao Jing was less filling than an entree!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was capable of using Earth Magic. It lifted its other arm and swung it at Wen Xia fiercely, despite the distance between them.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon’s arm grew longer and thicker in the process. Its body had a black luster, and was sturdier than metal. Its extending arm was strong enough to smash a building into dust!

Wen Xia did not stay to fight the creature. She withdrew from the scene and hid among the buildings. To her surprise, the creature kept smashing through the buildings with its arm. Several buildings nearby had already collapsed, like some toy building blocks.

On the other hand, Mo Fan carefully caught the half-conscious Tao Jing as she was falling from the sky.

Mo Fan woke her and roughly checked her injuries. Her condition was not too serious, with only some bruises and cuts from splinters. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fan Mo?” Tao Jing exclaimed in disbelief when she saw Mo Fan.

“Yeah, it’s me, I’ve saved your life once again. If I didn’t already have two wives, I’m afraid you would have to marry me to repay me,” Mo Fan answered promptly.

Tao Jing was a little confused. What did he mean by he has two wives?

“Find somewhere safe, I’m about to be bait,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Al...alright, I can still walk.” Tao Jing was a tough girl.

Mo Fan turned to look at the Black-Silver Rock Demon. The creature was as tall as a building, and its width was quite shocking. Even if he had his Elements, it would not be as easy for him to defeat an Elemental creature with such an outstanding defense as he had boasted.

The Lightning Element was weak against the Earth Element. Mo Fan was not really fond of these creatures, since his strongest Element was not as effective against them.

Since he had agreed to be the bait, however, he would do his best. Mo Fan chased after the Black-Silver Rock Demon that was trampling the buildings. He jumped between the remains of the buildings that were still standing to reach the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s height...

“Falling Rock!”

Mo Fan completed a Star Pattern and Summoned a huge rock the size of a room above the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s head. The rock fell and hit the Black-Silver Rock Demon right on the head!

As Mo Fan thought, the Falling Rock was completely useless against the massive creature. It was like a kid throwing a pebble at the back of a heavyweight boxer’s head.

—

The Black-Silver Rock Demon turned its head around and fixed its eyes on Mo Fan, who was standing there on a broken-down building.

The tiny Mo Fan gave the huge creature a middle finger.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon might not know what the gesture meant, but it could sense a strong provocation from the human.

Super Level!

Even though Mo Fan’s other Elements were Sealed away, it did not change the fact that he was a Super Mage. Besides, Mo Fan had eight Elements in total, which meant his body had a lot more energy stored up than normal Mages!

Mo Fan was like a fine delicacy in the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s eyes!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was very straightforward. It immediately gave up on pursuing Wen Xia, who had provoked it first. Its eyes were staring at Mo Fan like a pair of spotlights.

It might evolve into a Rock Tyrant after absorbing the human!

—

Mo Fan was not in a rush to run away when he saw the Black-Silver Rock Demon charging at him.

He was planning to be caught by the creature, after all. He could resist a little to put up a better act, or he could just stand still and let the creature catch him.

Forget it, why did he even bother to make it look real? The Black-Silver Rock Demon did not look smart at all.

He glanced at Wen Xia and saw her signaling him that she was ready. He immediately stopped moving and let the Black-Silver Rock Demon grab him. It even saved him the part of having to get injured.

These Rock Monsters were after the energy of the Mages. Only Mages who were alive could provide them with energy, hence these creatures would not kill the Mages before absorbing them. They would only break their legs or arms at most...
