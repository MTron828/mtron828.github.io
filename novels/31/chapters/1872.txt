BANG!

The sea monster raised its pincers and smashed the other side of the toll bridge into pieces. Broken steel rebar was exposed to the air, while shattered cement fell into the water. The young woman failed to stand firm this time, and fell together with the other half of the toll bridge. However, she was quite agile. She noticed a metal sheet roof that happened to be near her. She quickly used it as a stepping stone before it fell and jumped to a large billboard around a pole.

She was able to get her footing on the billboard. After stabilizing herself, she pulled the hood of the raincoat back as if it was hindering her vision, revealing a rather attractive face. Her wet short hair dangling by the side of her ears was clean, and more than enough to set off her beauty!

“Tell me where it is!” the young woman’s eyes sharpened. The menacing look was out of place on her face.

The young teenager could barely stand properly on the remnants of the toll bridge. His trembling legs were losing strength. He climbed miserably toward the rails after hearing the young woman’s order, gathering his courage before looking into the water.

“It’s...it’s on the other side of the street. It’s heading toward you!” the young teenager shouted when he noticed the shadow moving quickly underwater.

The young woman quickly fixed her eyes in the direction the young teenager had mentioned.

“Run, it’s charging at you, you’re going to die!” the young teenager yelled in fear.

Mo Fan glanced at the ripples on the water. He noticed the sea monster was indeed speeding up, as the young teenager had mentioned. The creature was several times stronger than normal Servant-class creatures. If it had a chance to gather its strength, a blow from it was even comparable to the attack of a Warrior-level creature. The force would crush the young woman to pieces! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan clenched his left hand. He had formed a lightning orb and was ready to strike at any moment!

“Glacier Zipline!” the young woman uttered firmly.

Rings of frost appeared half a meter behind her. As she pointed forward, several icy zip lines as sturdy as metal sprang forward. Unlike the Ice Lock of most Ice Mages, the tip of the woman’s Glacier Zipline was as sharp as a spear!

The Huge-Pincered Sea Monster jumped out of the water. Its dark green body resembled an armored tank. It was rather terrifying when it was charging at its target with such great momentum!

The Glacier Zipline shot at the sea monster as it was pouncing forward. The icy sharp Glacier Zipline had remarkable penetrating force. It easily punched right through the sea monster’s thick armor.

Four of the eight ice zip lines punctured the creature and nailed it to a supporting pillar of the highway.

The Huge-Pincered Sea Monster’s attack halted in mid-air. The Glacier Zipline was thin, yet it was still strong enough to support the creature’s weight. The sea monster suddenly resembled an Alaskan crab that had been placed on a barbecue grill. It was struggling to break free despite waving its huge pincers around.

The young woman on the billboard stared at the Huge-Pincered Sea Monster coldly. The Glacier Zipline had most likely damaged its vital organs. Its life was draining away rapidly as light green blood leaked out from its wounds and dripped into the water.

A moment later, the young woman flipped in the air and landed on the ice zip lines. She approached the Huge-Pincered Sea Monster steadily.

The Huge-Pincered Sea Monster planned to murder the woman with its huge pincers, yet it could no longer swing them at the right angle. The woman stepped on the Huge-Pincered Sea Monster’s head and walked over its back to the zip line behind it.

The young woman soon returned to the highway by following the zip line. A huge crowd was watching her from the awning of the highway. They cheered excitedly when they saw the enormous sea monster slain by a seemingly feeble young woman!

The young teenager stared at the young woman blankly. His mind was empty for some time. In his eyes, the Huge-Pincered Sea Monster was incredibly strong. It would easily kill everyone on the highway, and even destroy the bridge that would decide their fate. However, it was actually possible to kill such a terrifying creature, not to mention it was a seemingly weak young woman who killed it. She was stronger than the sea monster!

“You did well.” The young woman helped the young teenager who was struggling to stand properly up.

The young teenager’s eyes glittered passionately after he overcame his fear. “Can a Mage be so strong?”

“There are many who are stronger than me.” The young woman did not smile because of the compliment.

She gave Mo Fan a quick glance while they were passing him by and said coldly, “Too scared to move your feet? If not, you should go up there now.”

Mo Fan rubbed his forehead and withdrew the lightning spell in his left hand. He said with an awkward smile, “I was going to help you, but you took care of it yourself. You are stronger than I thought.”

A Battlemage was different from a salaried Mage. A Battlemage’s ability to remain calm when facing demon creatures was something that Mages who normally worked in offices lacked. The young woman was obviously trained and experienced. The Intermediate Ice Spell was the result of countless improvements through experience in battles!

The Intermediate Ice Spell: Ice Lock was more of a utility spell that was mostly used to bind and impair an enemy’s movement, but it had become a powerful offensive spell in the young woman’s hands. She had turned the ice chains into zip lines to maximize their penetrating power!

—

The others’ attitude toward the young woman shifted when they returned to the highway. They were hoping to get closer to her.

Mo Fan glanced at the communication device on his wrist. The screen was displaying the coordinates of the place where everyone would be regrouping at.

“We can climb to that building from here.” The young teenager pointed at a nearby building after realizing something.

“There should be food, clothes, and medicine in the building. It’s better than staying out here in the rain.”

“Yeah, let’s take shelter in the building!”

The ice zip lines that the young woman summoned had become a bridge for them, but the catch was they had to pass by the dead body of the huge sea monster. However, they had no choice but to climb over it to find themselves a safer spot.

The group began to climb along the Glacier Zipline. Meanwhile, the young woman was staring in a different direction.

“Sister, aren’t you going to come with us?” the young teenager asked.
