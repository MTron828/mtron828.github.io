Xinxia’s face was still red when they headed back. There was nothing more embarrassing than what they did. Meanwhile, Mo Fan was brimming with excitement, like he was extremely proud of himself.

Zhao Manyan was murmuring beside Mu Bai’s coffin. It was surprising how he could keep talking to a person in a vegetative state on his own.

“I...I’ll be going back first, Brother Mo Fan,” Xinxia said softly.

“Sure,” Mo Fan nodded. He glanced at the stern-faced Guardian Knight standing at the door. Tata was most likely going to show up soon.

Zhao Manyan stared at Mo Fan in a strange way as soon as Xinxia left. Mo Fan rubbed his nose with a puzzled look. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhao Manyan went up to Mo Fan and sniffed like a dog.

“What are you doing?” Mo Fan snapped.

“You assh***, Mu Bai’s corpse isn’t cold yet, but you’re already having outdoor sex. Did you even consider his feelings as a virgin!?” Zhao Manyan snarled.

“Those are two different things!”

“How was it?”

“It was f**king awesome!”

Lingling needed time to collect and filter the information given her. There was nothing Mo Fan could do to help her, so he could only wait patiently. To their relief, Mu Bai’s condition was not going to worsen anytime soon. They were at the Parthenon Temple’s Mountain of the Goddess, which had the tightest security. Their safety was guaranteed for the time being.

However, things were quite complicated in the Parthenon Temple. To make sure Mu Bai was safe, Mo Fan purposely found Kris and asked him to keep an eye on Mu Bai while he was away looking for the Night Amethyst.

“Kris, where are you bringing me to?” Mo Fan had only asked Kris to keep an eye on Mu Bai, yet he seemed to be planning something. He was bringing him toward the Hall of Knights.

The Hall of Knights was Haylon’s territory, but there were many other authority figures in the Hall of Knights. Haylon did not necessarily have a say in everything. Mo Fan was not sure if it had someone who had been around for a long time and was no different from a malignant tumor.

“Did you see any knights on your way to the Parthenon Temple? A Blue Star Combat Officer mentioned you when we were training in the morning yesterday. He said that you have the highest potential among the young Mages that are ranked internationally,” Kris said.

“He’s very insightful!” Mo Fan nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, he admires you, so he wants to meet you in person. I’m thinking of introducing you to him,” Kris said.

“Sure thing. By the way, is this the training ground for the Blue Star Knights? It’s fascinating!” Mo Fan agreed readily.

“Of course, as the knights of the Parthenon Temple, we have the best facilities to practice our magic. The training ground here is actually a mountain with great scenery. Haylon believes the Blue Star Knights are the fresh blood of the Hall of Knights, so the training ground and dueling ground have to be good enough. He asked people to turn the mountain into this training ground. The Blue Star Knights and Silver Moon Knights both normally practice here. The air quality and presence of magic here are wonderful. In addition to the Hall of Knights, the people from the other Halls, including the Hall of the Goddess will come here too,” Kris explained to Mo Fan.

Kris was currently one of the probationary knights being trained to serve the Candidates. He was still a long way away from becoming a real Guardian Knight, but the title of a probationary Guardian Knight was already insanely good for a Blue Star Knight!

The knights of the Parthenon Temple served the members of the Hall of the Goddess. In addition to having a greater allocation of resources, the servants, Muses, and Candidates whom they served would provide them with their greatest support. After all, the members of the Hall of the Goddess were the core of the Parthenon Temple, and the resources were mostly gathered in their hands. If the knights wanted to stand out, they had to serve the right person, in addition to showing their talents!

The Parthenon Temple had always been an organization of women’s rights. It was the only powerful organization focused on the Blessing Element!

“Kris, did you bring your friend over for a visit?”

“Kris, haven’t seen you in a while, you look a lot fatter. Have you been eating nice food ever since you were chosen as a probationary knight?”

“Kris, please send my greetings to the Goddess.”

“The result of the election isn’t out yet.”

“Does it even matter? There’s only one goddess in my heart!”

When they entered the spacious training ground, Mo Fan noticed most of the people were greeting Kris warmly. Kris responded with a smile too. Many were scoffing at him, yet he did not seem to be bothered.

They were mostly talking in English, but some were talking in Greek. Mo Fan could guess what they were saying from their expressions and body language.

“See that guy over there? He’s the Blue Star Combat Officer, Lido,” Kris pointed out for Mo Fan.

Mo Fan glanced at the circle set up in the training area. He saw a knight wearing a Blue Star uniform with golden embroidery along the edges standing in front of a group. He was rebuking the Blue Star Knights, as if he was not too pleased with their training. He was going to deprive them of their rest day as punishment!

Kris went up to Combat Officer Lido and said with a smile, “Combat Officer Lido, look who I brought!”

Lido turned around. He had a dark expression at first, yet his eyes glittered when he saw Mo Fan.

“Mo Fan!” Lido exclaimed.

Mo Fan noticed how enthusiastic the man sounded. He had to say, he had no idea who the fellow was.

“I’m well aware of the things you’ve done, including your outstanding performance during the World College Tournament... I’m so jealous of your Double Innate Elements. Many people once argued that Zorro’s Innate Talent is the strongest, but I disagreed. They will never understand how powerful a person with Double Innate Elements is when they reach the Super Level!” Lido exclaimed.

“Ugh... you’re pretty insightful,” Mo Fan said after a pause.

“Therefore, if I can defeat you, I’ll be considered one of the strongest young Mages too! I have been waiting for this day for a long time!”
