Dean Xiao started to set up the Medium Formation. A dark red Soul Line connected Dean Xiao’s index finger and Mo Fan’s back.

Mo Fan turned to look at it. He found that the Soul Line did not affect his movement. In contrast, Dean Xiao stood there and was motionless. Dean Xiao concentrated, and a dark red giant pattern appeared on the ground like a huge drawing.

Energy flowed in the giant pattern like water. Some dark places began to light up. When a part of the pattern was lit up, the Soul Line between Mo Fan and Dean Xiao became brighter and more visible.

The Medium Formation was desolate yet magnificent. Dean Xiao stood in the formation and felt a large amount of energy flow from the dark pattern. Sometimes, a strong dark red airflow would become a storm and move in every direction.

Dean Xiao chanted and set up this Medium Formation with the help of Mo Fan’s Fusion Magic. It was a Forbidden Formation that could destroy the Prime Waves Fortress of the Cold Moon Demon Lord!

“President, I’ve set up the formation. I’ll leave the rest in your hands,” said Dean Xiao.

A light arc surrounded and protected him. Dean Xiao closed his eyes and ignored everything that happened around him. The process of the Forbidden Curse was long, but he needed to complete it.

At that moment, the Cold Moon Demon Lord looked at them. When it stared at Mo Fan, he felt as though he was trapped in an abyss. He felt goosebumps prickle all over his skin.

“This guy…” Mo Fan suddenly realized something.

It was the Ocean Demon Head Apas saw before. He could never forget the pull of that gaze.

This creature was indeed the real leader of the Ocean Godly Horde. It was an evil being that controlled every Ocean Prophet and used the Ocean Prophets to control the whole Ocean Horde!

“Mo Fan!” President Hong Wu shouted.

Mo Fan was lost in his thoughts for a while. When he came back to his senses, he realized that the Cold Moon Demon Lord had summoned a group of powerful Ocean Demons from the Pudong ocean area again.

The Ocean Demons’ eyes flickered and became triangular. Every Ocean Demon that had rushed toward Mo Fan and the others madly had a similar imprint of mind-control in their eyes.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord had controlled them all.

They might have been Ocean Demons and Ocean Beasts with no interest in human territory. Yet, they rushed toward Mo Fan and the others desperately, as if they hated humans.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord let out a strange cry again. More demons targeted Mo Fan and Dean Xiao. After the Ocean Demons heard the cry, they became aggressive and rushed toward the Medium Formation immediately.

“What’s going on? It seems to know that we’ll use the Medium Formation to deal with it.” President Hong Wu was surprised.

“The Demon Lord’s reaction shows that Dean Xiao’s method might actually work!” said the Chief Eastern Mage.

“That’s why we should protect Dean Xiao and Mo Fan.”

…

The Ocean Demons passed by the Huangpu River and rushed toward Mo Fan and Dean Xiao. Some Forbidden Magic could not really block the Ocean Demons. It was terrifying.

The Azure Dragon also seemed to know the Medium Formation between Mo Fan and Dean Xiao was important. Its tail slowly formed a circle, which protected Dean Xiao’s Medium Formation.

The tail of the Azure Dragon was huge, so it circled around the formation like an ancient city wall.

The Azure Dragon raised its head and roared when the Ocean Demons rushed at them. Suddenly, multiple blue meteorites hit the Huangpu River and killed many Ocean Demons in an instant.

The Salamander Emperor stepped into the river. Its mountain-like back bulged and covered the Ocean Demons from the blue meteorites of the Azure Dragon. The Ocean Demons passed through the river. Their target was Dean Xiao’s Medium Formation.

The Cold Moon Demon Lord issued another order.

Suddenly, all the Ocean Demons stared at Mo Fan. Some octopus monsters had hundreds of eyes, and they were all directed at Mo Fan.

“What’s going on?” Mo Fan was shocked.

It was difficult to kill Dean Xiao, who had the protection of the Forbidden Curse Association. However, Mo Fan was an easy target.

“Mo Fan, they want to kill you!” Mr. Feng rushed over with the members of the Enforcement Union.

“I know.” Mo Fan was anxious.

Both sides of the Huangpu River were full of Ruler-level demons. It was even more critical than the war he had fought before. Many Forbidden Mages had been killed, let alone Super Level Mages.

More than half of the Ocean Demons rushed toward Mo Fan to kill him. The Cold Moon Demon Lord must have known that the Medium Formation was important, so it wanted to kill either Dean Xiao or Mo Fan to stop it.

It was easier to kill Mo Fan as he was not a Forbidden mage.

Little White Tiger roared. Mo Fan saw the white figure speed on the Azure Dragon’s tail and body. Its cold breath froze a few Ocean Demons that wanted to jump over the tail of the Azure Dragon.

The Azure Dragon turned around and saw many Ocean Demons trying to pass through a blind spot in its vision to kill Mo Fan.

The Lan Dragon Demon and the Lord of the Shark Men hit the Azure Dragon’s neck and chest. Azure Dragon’s scales cracked because of the force.

The Lan Dragon Demon and the Lord of the Shark Men were both emperor-level creatures and were more powerful than the Multicolored Demon King and the Demonic Ruins White Spider Emperor.

“Azure Dragon, you take care of those emperor-level creatures. I can take care of myself since I have Little White Tiger, Moon Moth Phoenix, and Black Totem Snake with me,” said Mo Fan.

The tail of the Azure Dragon had formed a sturdy wall that blocked the Ocean Demons. However, there were too many of them. Despite the Meteorite Rain, some Ocean Demons with special abilities could still break in through the barrier.
