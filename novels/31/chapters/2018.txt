The Tianshan Scar White Tiger was leaping into the air when the area was Petrified by the Medusa’s Gaze. Its amber white hair was instantly covered in a thick layer of mud. The mud flowed over the Tianshan Scar White Tiger and gradually hardened.

As a result of their encounter with the Mud Morphing Monsters, harvesting the special crystals they possessed had strengthened Apas’ Petrify. She was not able to use the Petrifying Skygaze when Mo Fan kidnapped her. It was one of the reasons why she did not stand a chance against her sisters.

The Petrifying Curse of the Medusae was one of the strongest magicks in the world. The Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s strength was several levels higher than Apas, so it was the only power she could use against it.

Apas came down from the peak when she saw the Tianshan Scar White Tiger turning into a rock.

She grinned and naughtily knocked the Tianshan Scar White Tiger on the head.

“I told you, if we wanted to hurt your little cub, you wouldn’t have had a chance to see her. Why must you attack us so recklessly? We aren’t some brainless creatures,” Apas told the petrified Tianshan Scar White Tiger.

Even though that assh*** Mo Fan had forced her to use her full strength, she was satisfied with the outcome. It meant she was able to defend herself if she had to face her sisters in the future. The Petrifying Skygaze was the symbolic ability of those with the purest lineage, and a sign that she had matured!

Cracks surfaced on the Tianshan Scar White Tiger while Apas was enjoying the pleasure of using the power for the first time. The cracks were thin as hairs at first, but they soon grew wider. The satisfied grin on Apas’ face froze.

“How are you breaking it so quickly...” Apas did not expect her magic to reach its limit so soon!

Normally the Petrifying Skygaze would turn a Ruler-level creature’s organs and blood into rocks too. Even if the spell was lifted, the creature would be as good as dead. As for creatures like the Tianshan Scar White Tiger, the Petrifying Gaze would temporarily seal them in stone and stop them from moving while inflicting serious damage on their skin, hair, and shell. However, the duration was shorter than Apas had imagined!

“It’s because of the limits of the Contract again!” Apas soon realized she was still unable to use her full strength.

Mo Fan might have reached the Super Level, but he was still a long way from matching Apas’ natural strength. Differences at the Ruler level were huge, and were clearly reflected here in Tianshan Mountain. The Valley of Glaciers was just one boundary; there were mountains and peaks of different altitudes. Some of the peaks were several thousand meters taller than the shorter peaks.

Mo Fan had only reached the Super Level, so their Contract was still limiting Apas’ power.

It also showed how strong the Tianshan Scar White Tiger was. Even Apas’ Petrify could not buy her much time.

Apas knew there was no need to have a showdown with the Tianshan Scar White Tiger now. She quickly turned into a mist and left the area by flitting along the ice when she noticed the situation was not in her favor.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger broke through the hardened mud on its body. They were closely attached to its skin and hair, meaning that it had to shed its fur too!

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger was soon covered in blood. When its blood fell onto the ice, it produced white steam as the ice melted rapidly.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger let out a roar. The glaciers nearby shook, and some even shattered and collapsed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The huge pieces of ice floated in the air and shattered into smaller pieces after a second roar from the Tianshan Scar White Tiger.

The pieces of ice circled the Tianshan Scar White Tiger like a tornado under its control.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger gradually absorbed the pieces to regenerate its damaged skin and hair at a visible rate.

As the pieces completely melted inside its powerful aura, the Tianshan Scar White Tiger reclaimed its previous magnificent appearance and its crystalline white hair!

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger began searching around, trying to track down Apas.

The truth was, it was difficult for humans to escape the Tianshan Scar White Tigers when they were hunting. The Tianshan Demon Tigers had an outstanding ability to track. It was their innate ability, and the Tianshan Scar White Tiger had the purest lineage among them. How could the humans possibly run away from it?

The Mailong Private Military Group had experienced the ability first hand. No matter how far they went, the demon tiger could still track them down.

A strange sound came from deep within the Scar of Tianshan Mountain as the Tianshan Scar White Tiger was about to pursue the reckless humans. It was like a howling breeze over a creek, but it also sounded like the cry of a living creature if one was listening carefully.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger lifted its head and stared deeper into the Scar of Tianshan Mountain.

Its rage-filled eyes immediately calmed down, as if it had just received an order. It glanced in the direction the humans had escaped to, yet it did not chase after them. It turned around and climbed back to the higher altitudes instead.

Apas kept setting down illusions along the way. The Tianshan Scar White Tiger had an outstanding tracking ability, just like how the Medusae were able to locate their enemies by tracking their scent. Apas was hoping that Mo Fan would quickly trick the little cub into giving him the Night Amethyst and let the little creature go, just so the Tianshan Scar White Tiger would give up on the chase.

Apas knew she would struggle to defeat the Tianshan Scar White Tiger with her current strength.

“It stopped chasing?” Apas suddenly turned around and looked in the direction she had come from.

Apas was capable of sensing danger. She could tell if the Tianshan Scar White Tiger was still chasing her.

The sense of danger had just disappeared! Did the creature let them go, just like that?

But its little cub was still in Mo Fan’s hands!

It was unbelievable. There was no way the Tianshan Scar White Tiger would believe they were not going to harm the little cub at all...
