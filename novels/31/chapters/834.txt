“Are...are you alright?” asked Jiang Shaoxu worriedly.

“I’m fine... I won’t die, do you have any water?” asked Mo Fan.

Jiang Shaoxu handed him a water pouch. Mo Fan quickly gulped it down.

His lips felt extremely dry. He finally looked better after drinking the water.

“Is there more?” asked Mo Fan.

“Mm, you’re heavily dehydrated. What happened?” asked Jiang Shaoxu.

“Nothing serious, just being too careless and I let the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast hit me. Commander-level creatures are indeed tough to deal with,” said Mo Fan, after he was feeling better.

“Lie down and take some rest. Blood serums aren’t really effective for wounds inflicted by the sea monsters,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“Give me more water.”

“How are you so dehydrated?”

Jiang Shaoxu let out a relieved sigh after seeing Mo Fan’s condition improving.

She took the first-aid kit and helped Mo Fan treat his wounds to prevent them from worsening. She then gave Mo Fan an injection, some kind of rapid energy boost for Magicians, just so he could recover faster.

On the other hand, Nan Rongni’s condition was finally improving too. The antidote was working like a charm. The poison in her body gradually disappeared.

Nan Rongni regained consciousness, but she looked extremely weak. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the tide was still around, and the battle in the East Maritime Fortress was still going on. It was likely that the sea monsters would show up again.

There was nothing Mo Fan and Nan Rongni could do due to their injuries. Luckily, the density of sea monsters in the area had reduced. Otherwise, the team would have had a hard time holding the creatures off.

“The tide is falling!” Jiang Yu exclaimed excitedly.

Mo Fan leapt up in surprise, too. He quickly rose to his feet and poked his head over the edge of the building.

It did seem like the water was lower. The parts of the building that were previously underwater were now exposed. The water had dropped around three meters.

The sea monsters’ area of activity would shrink gradually, meaning that the battle would soon come to an end.

“Who would have thought, the East Maritime Fortress was such a thrilling place,” Mo Fan murmured as he laid back down.

Nan Rongni was lying beside him. She looked dull, as if she had just escaped death.

“You should be happy that you’re still alive. Why do you look so down?” asked Mo Fan with a confused face.

“Someone will be leaving the team after the training,” Nan Rongni said softly.

So it turned out that Nan Rongni was worrying about Mu Ningxue. Mo Fan soon fell into deep thought.

“She saved your life. Why don’t you quit the team voluntarily and give her your spot?” Mo Fan asked reasonably.

Nan Rongni was stunned, as if she did not expect it from him.

“I was thinking the same thing too, but it’s unlikely to happen. Anyone else can easily do that, but I’m the only Healer on the team. The advisors won’t let me quit, even if I want to. If I insist, they would simply choose another Healer to join the team instead of giving the spot to Mu Ningxue,” said Nan Rongni.

Mo Fan nodded. Nan Rongni was stating the truth. A Healer was a must for the national team. Nan Rongni would not be able to give Mu Ningxue her spot even if she wanted to.

As for Zhao Manyan who was also a substitute, he was obviously the weakest on the team, yet it was unlikely that he would be disqualified, either. He already mentioned the financial group supporting him. They would simply invest as much as needed to help him become an Advanced Magician, just so he could stay on the team.

Zhao Manyan would soon break through after the training. The person leaving the team would still be Mu Ningxue, unless Mo Fan strangled Zhao Manyan to death now.

It was indeed a troublesome question!

If Mu Ningxue left, Mo Fan felt it was meaningless to stay on the national team.

The tide fell gradually, revealing the debris of the buildings scattered across the streets.

No one knew how many sea monsters remained. There were countless numbers of them, yet they had all retreated with the tide falling. Without the water as their shield, their casualties would increase significantly as their strength weakened. It was unnecessary for them to stay any longer.

The drainage system of the East Maritime Fortress was shockingly impressive. Normally, it would take a flooded town a few days to recover. However, when the tide fell back to the height of the shorter dam, all that was left on the streets of the East Maritime Fortress were mere puddles. It felt like the fortress had just experienced a rain, instead of a flood with the water reaching ten meters!

The streets had been quickly destroyed, but were rebuilt in no time, too. Whenever the tide fell, the shorter dam would be filled with Battlemages, preventing the sea monsters from launching a sneak attack. The cleaning squad would carry out their tasks efficiently and clean up the debris and the corpses of the sea monsters before nighttime.

The corpses of the sea monsters were the resources of the fortress. After all, most territories outside the cities were occupied by demon creatures. The resources they controlled were a lot greater than humans had, which they used to strengthen their flesh. As such, their corpses would be rich in useful resources too!

Like magic ores, demon creatures also served as a type of resource that drove the Magic Civilization forward, since each of them was a portable quarry full of resources!

The zone masters were in charge of collecting the corpses. There were people in charge of counting the demon creatures that each team had slain.

However, it was far from the concern of the team. Their only thought was to return to their living quarters, take a nice hot bath, and enjoy themselves a good night’s sleep on the cozy beds.

They had just participated in a true battle between humans and demon creatures. However, the national team basically consisted of a bunch of students. Their talents and capabilities might have surpassed most experienced Magicians in society, but they lacked patience and experience.

How much were the corpses worth? They could not care less about it. The factions that supported them to secure a spot on the national team could easily provide them with ten times the resources they had earned from the battle with a few words.

That being said, that was only the case for most members of the national team.

To someone like Mu Ningxue who had lost her backer, money was extremely important to her!

“Jiang Shaoxu and Nan Rongni’s portions are yours, as you saved both their lives. However, even with three portions, you only get twelve million,” Nanyu was in charge of handling the money for the team. She gave Mu Ningxue her split.

Mu Ningxue happily accepted it. She needed money more than anyone else, as money could buy her the resources she desperately needed!
