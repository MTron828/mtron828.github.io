“Little Flame Belle, possess!”

“Ying~” Little Flame Belle cried out like a little demoness, blowing her flute joyfully.

Little Flame Belle slammed into Mo Fan’s chest and immediately set his skin on fire. Even his hair was standing up in energy from the flames.

The Calamity Fire formed into a graceful armor plate, turning Mo Fan into a flame devil. Even his pupils were burning with fire!

“Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons!”

With a magnificent aura and raging flames, Mo Fan’s punch launched nine savage fiery dragons forward. The dragons were quick and blazing hot, turning the Servant-class undead they crossed into nothing...

When the nine fiery dragons landed on a Corpse General simultaneously, the Warrior-level undead with hundreds of zombies under its command was burned into ashes and disappeared too. Its enormous figure only left a pile of dust that was blown away by the blast produced from the impact, scattering in the air above the rocky land.

The Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons swept the place. Apart from killing the Corpse General instantly, it even annihilated a hundred more undead. The Super Magicians watching the fight through the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror stared at the ash and dust scattering across the place in disbelief...

-Was that really an Intermediate Spell?-

They never knew the Fiery Fist could possess such remarkable strength!

Killing a Corpse General instantly and burning a hundred undead to death. That was clearly the power of an Advanced Spell!

Zuo Feng subconsciously grinned when he saw the punch. He was astounded just like these power figures when he first saw the super Fiery Fist. This Mo Fan was indeed no ordinary person!

“Only around a thousand undead left; it won’t be a problem if the four Magicians work together,” observed Yao Nan.

Yao Nan was the most familiar with Mo Fan’s strength, although the power of the Fiery Fist did shock him greatly. It was likely that the punch would inflict serious damage to a Commander-level creature. As expected of this violent Magician, no ordinary Magicians could cultivate the Fire Element to his level!

“His Contracted Beast is very special; it’s a rare elemental life form with the ability to possess someone. The Flame Belle is able to grant her master her fire and her ability to control fire. As such, it significantly strengthens the Fire Spells of a Fire Magician...” said Han Ji, who was knowledgeable about the Summoning Element.

Flame Belle!

The others might be unaware, but Han knew the unique creature only existed in the North Burning Valley. Han Ji did not expect that Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast was a Flame Belle, which even Super Magicians desired!

The unique elemental life form brought huge benefits to a Fire Magician. Han Ji could not help but admit that Mo Fan, who everyone had only assumed to be an Intermediate Magician, had greatly surpassed their expectations.

“Yeah, he even improved his Fiery Fist to the fourth-tier. It seems like all his Basic Spells were in the fourth-tier too. I don’t understand how the kid got his hands on so many Soul Essences... the strengthened spells and the fact that he has four Elements, I’m afraid he’s as strong as an Advanced Magician!” said Lu Xu.

“Who would have thought, it seems like we still have hope. There’s still hope!” said a leader of the Imperial Magicians.

“Our sacrifices were worth it!”

Glancing down through the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror, they clearly saw Mo Fan weaving through the pack of undead. His strength was comparable to an elite squad of Intermediate Magicians. He managed to clear a path despite the overwhelming numbers of undead!

The surprise did not stop at Mo Fan’s outstanding strength. As Zhang Xiaohou and Liu Ru joined the fight, the former’s outstanding control of Wind and Earth Elements left the undead with no chance of attacking them. He was able to corral a huge number of undead on his own...

The delegation of tasks was extremely important. For a pure brute force Magician like Mo Fan, if he was given the opportunity to use his Magic at will, he could eliminate hundreds, or even thousands of undead. What Zhang Xiaohou did simply gave Mo Fan the chance to do so!

Initially, they thought Liu Ru was also an ordinary Magician from Bo City, yet they were overjoyed when they saw the incredible strength of the Blood Tribe. The strength and speed that the slender girl displayed were comparable to those of a Corpse General, and together with the unique abilities of the Blood Tribe, she could easily massacre the undead even when she was surrounded by hundreds of them!

Mo Fan was simply a violent cannon. Each of his spells would kill a bunch of undead. Zhang Xiaohou focused on crowd-controlling the undead and luring the Warrior-level creatures away. His occasional attack using Wind Disc and the defense provided by Rock Barrier were extremely effective. Liu Ru had been in close combat all along. Her strength was equivalent to a Warrior-level creature in the Advancing Period. She would rip the heads off the lesser undead off with every swipe of her claws!

The bodies of undead scattered across the place. The ground was covered in broken pieces of undead crystals. They initially thought the two thousand undead were more than enough to shred the group, but the situation was hugely in their favor instead. The number of undead was decreasing rapidly, from one thousand to eight hundred, and further down to five hundred...

——

“Thunderbolt: Wild Strikes!”

Mo Fan pointed at the sky, summoning purple-black wild lightning bolts to descend rapidly. The lightning strikes split into forks halfway in the air and landed on the ground consecutively, producing lightning flashes across the land!

Countless undead were disintegrated instantly by the lightning, others were merely blasted to death...

The lightning strikes left many holes around. The number of undead suddenly seemed a lot fewer. The swaying zombies scattered across the place no longer posed any threat to the group!

Swift Star Wolf realized that it was his turn to shine. The handsome wolf revealed his fangs as the glowing runes on his body produced giant fangs, tearing at the zombies as the Swift Star Wolf snapped his jaws everywhere. The zombies were instantly torn into pieces, their flesh and blood splattering everywhere.

Little Flame Belle puffed her cheeks and breathed out fiercely. In addition to the blazing flames she exhaled, she even produced a huge tornado sweeping forward. As the flames and tornado combined, the damage they caused was no weaker than Mo Fan’s Fiery Fist: Nine Halls. The wind basically dragged the undead into the center of the tornado, where they were burned by the Calamity Fire!

Only a few undead were left. The authorities watching from afar definitely did not expect this to be the outcome.

Since the Space of Death was under the effect of Chaos Element, Mo Fan might actually make it out from the Space of Death with his outstanding strength, and find the altar!
