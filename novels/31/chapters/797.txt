“You two...” The guard called Yamaji was a Light Magician, after all. The others had trouble moving their eyeballs, but he could still speak.

Yamaji tried to catch a glimpse Mo Fan and Mochizuki Chihaya as they appeared, but Mo Fan was not foolish enough to expose his face. He had already covered his handsome face, that no one could possibly forget after catching a glimpse of, with a black mist. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Take a nap!” Mo Fan walked up to the Light Magician and knocked him unconscious.

The whole tower was covered in a strong aura of darkness, which significantly increased the effects of Mo Fan’s Giant Shadow Spikes. The other two guards were covered by a black aura, saving him the need to knock them unconscious. They had no chance of breaking free for a short period of time.

“Time to hurry,” said Mo Fan, glancing at Mochizuki Chihaya behind him.

Mochizuki Chihaya looked at Mo Fan. Her eyes flickered gently as she spoke, “Mmm...you have my thanks.”

“It’s nothing, I’m a fan of exhilarating adventures,” replied Mo Fan.

He was not lying; he always liked excitement, for example sneaking into a Japanese teacher’s room to see her naked. That was f**king insane!

Mochizuki Chihaya quickly walked to the narrow door. She was well aware that the guards did not have the key to unlock the door. She leaned against the heavy door and spoke to the person inside.

Mochizuki Chihaya was speaking Japanese, so Mo Fan was unable to understand her.

Some time later, Mochizuki Chihaya turned around and looked at Mo Fan. He could easily tell that the person locked inside the cell was truly her brother Iwata just from the expression in her eyes.

“Why did they lock you here? Aren’t you one of the guards?” Mochizuki Chihaya’s emotion was slightly unstable. Her eyes were already bloodshot.

Iwata had been missing for a long time. She almost thought her brother had simply vanished from the world. To her surprise, he had been kept in the tower just a drawbridge away all this time. As someone from the West Guardian Tower, it went without saying that Mochizuki Chihaya knew clearly how terrifying the prison was!

“I found an Essence Orb. I was going to report the finding to Osaka’s government, but I was intercepted by Commander Takagi. He was planning to keep the orb to himself, so he locked me up. I did not tell him where the orb is, so he imprisoned me here...” the voice inside the cell was extremely weak. It sounded like the person had suffered greatly.

“Let’s talk later, how can I save you? I can’t let you die here,” interrupted Mochizuki Chihaya.

The two chatted for quite a long time. Mo Fan purposely gave the guards a few more shadow spikes.

“Is there a way to open up the Nightmare Cell?” asked Mo Fan.

Mochizuki Chihaya shook her head with a lost expression. It seemed like what Iwata had told her had given her quite a huge blow.

“What exactly is going on?” asked Mo Fan.

“Apart from the Formation of Darkness, the East Guardian Tower also has a huge curse, which will draw away the energy of human souls from criminals. I initially thought that was the only effect of the curse, yet it turns out that it does not only draw away the energy of human souls, but it also stores the energy inside an orb...” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

“An orb that stores the energy of human souls collected from these criminals? That’s going to be remarkable!” said Mo Fan.

“Exactly, that asshole Takagi has gone so far just so his Sky Ridge Beast can evolve to the Ruler-level... bringing harm to people’s lives just for his personal gain, despite his identity as the commander in charge of the West Guardian Tower. How detestable!” snapped Mochizuki Chihaya furiously.

“The orb is seriously able to raise a Summoned Beast to the Ruler-level? Anyone with the slightest selfish desire would surely go for it. I always felt something fishy about that Commander Takagi. He looks like the kind that would pursue power more than anyone else. I bet he’s tired of his role as the warden of the prison, but he discovered the treasure, and will do anything just to secure it,” analyzed Mo Fan.

It was common for people to be greedy, especially those with high positions!

“We’ll be taking the Essence Orb. Otherwise, if Commander Takagi found it, he will surely kill my brother to silence him,” said Mochizuki Chihaya.

“Mm, you’re right. Considering how evil the thing is, maybe I should be the one keeping it. I wouldn’t want the Twin Guardian Towers to be involved in a disaster,” said Mo Fan.

Judging from Mochizuki Chihaya’s description, the Essence Orb was clearly useful for powering up the soul of a beast. It would be extremely useful for his Summoned Beast. Mo Fan knew that refining the soul was an important requirement for a Summoned Beast to evolve. Only with a stronger soul would the beast be able to surpass its limits and grow stronger.

Frankly speaking, Mo Fan was interested in the orb. His Swift Star Wolf had been stuck at the current level for quite some time, and it was most likely due to the level of his soul. If he could help the creature refine a stronger soul, perhaps the Swift Star Wolf could improve to a higher level.

A piece of treasure that could level a Commander-level creature in the Advancing Period to a Ruler-level creature. He was definitely not asking too much if he was planning to use it so the Warrior-level Swift Star Wolf could level up to the Commander-level, right?

“You better not think about trying to keep it to yourself,” Mochizuki Chihaya’s eyes chilled.

“Hehe, I was just saying,” Mo Fan shrugged.

Following Iwata’s instructions, Mo Fan and Mochizuki Chihaya headed deeper into the East Guardian Tower. It seemed like the Essence Orb was hidden on the bottom floor of the tower. Since the structure of the tower was rather complicated, it was almost impossible to locate the place where the energy collected from the criminals’ soul was stored without guidance.

Luckily, Iwata had told Mochizuki Chihaya the directions through the maze of darkness. Mo Fan and Mochizuki Chihaya successfully arrived at the spot that Iwata mentioned.

The place did not have any guards. It was most likely that Iwata had found the place coincidentally, and so discovered the existence of the Essence Orb.

Iwata was quite an honest man. Most people would simply keep the orb to themselves in secret, yet the man insisted on writing a report to his superior, and was found out by someone who was harboring evil intentions, ending up placing himself in great danger. If Mo Fan was in his shoes, he would surely have taken it, and even if the orb was useless to him, he would have sold it instead!

The eye of the formation was inside an insignificant spot, surrounded by walls. The only entrance was a little gap above the place.

There was nothing else in the room. It looked just like an ordinary underground storeroom, but a gleaming orb with a weak, evil presence was floating in the center.

In Mo Fan’s eyes, the orb was not attractive at all. It simply looked like an eyeball floating in the air, which actually looked rather scary.

“This thing is rather evil!” Mo Fan kept on his toes.
