Chapter 1543 Enormous Lightning Explosion!

Translated by XephiZ

“Ahhhh~!”

Cries of agony arose. Mo Fan glanced at the enemy and saw some of the Battlemages had been caught by the White-Marked Wolves. The White-Marked Wolves knew how to work together, and kept attacking the Mages that were isolated. Each tear and bite would dye the sand red.

“Damn it, kill that Summoner!” a Mage with a brown afro resembling a lion shouted angrily.

The Enormous White Wolves’ defense was outstanding, and a few among them were almost as strong as Commander-level creatures. The rest were all in the Advancing Period of the Warrior-level. It was difficult to kill them without a group of Mages constantly attacking them with spells.

The White-Marked Wolves were extremely cunning, too. They never stayed at the front, but would move around the edges and target the Mages that were isolated after they were knocked flying by the Enormous White Wolves. Almost every Mage that was stranded was heavily injured by the White-Marked Wolves!

The wolf pack was inflicting serious damage on the troop. The Mage with an afro had realized who they should be taking out first.

Many talented Mages were able to take on an entire army. The deaths of the Summoned Beasts were not really a loss for the Summoner. As such, the hairy commander immediately ordered the Battlemages to target Mo Fan with their destructive spells.

The Ice Mages were the core of the troop. These Battlemages whose safety was secured soon summoned a great blizzard down on Mo Fan.

Snow on the scale of an avalanche came down from above. It was further mixed with Icebound Coffins and chains of ice!

Mo Fan raised his head. He felt as if the entire space above him was covered, he could not see the sky at all. The shocking amount of ice had left him with no escape!

“Mo Fan!”

Heidi was around five hundred meters behind Mo Fan. She yelled in panic after seeing Mo Fan was not casting Blink to run away.

“Don’t come close!” Mo Fan stood still. The shadow of the blizzard had completely devoured his minuscule figure.

“Hand of Silent Thunder!” Mo Fan crossed his arms above him, emitting a dark purple light. The light attached to Mo Fan and formed a barrier with a radius of three meters around him!

The purple light within the barrier became restless when the Ice Magic collided with it. The energy spun rapidly within it, like a dynamo powered by lightning!

The Ice Magic was being transformed; it felt like the Ice Magic was replenishing the machine’s energy!

Mo Fan fully extended his arms. The zone of the Hand of Silent Thunder enlarged significantly, further increasing the capacity of the energy it could hold.

The Ice Magic was transformed into lightning. It turned into thick bolts of lightning after passing through the zone and striking Mo Fan continuously.

The lightning flickered wildly. Mo Fan’s hair stood up like an enraged demon while his eyes emitted a terrifying glow.

The soldiers stared at Mo Fan in the middle of the chaotic storm in astonishment. Was that guy really a human!? It felt like he had absorbed all the Ice Spells!

Most terrifyingly, the more he was blasted by the spells, the scarier the lightning surrounding him grew!

Arcs of lightning over a few hundred meters long burst out of Mo Fan’s body uncontrollably, leaving scorched marks on the ground.

The lightning arcs were insanely quick. A Shadow Mage was planning to ambush Mo Fan, but he was knocked to the ground by the spraying lightning arcs. He fell to the ground and started convulsing!

More lightning arcs swept forward, like high voltage power lines that had suddenly snapped in half. The lightning arcs knocked quite a number of soldiers to the ground. They were knocked out almost instantly by the slightest contact!

Apart from the terrifying lightning bolts that were being flung at the people nearby randomly, Mo Fan was basically a lightning cloud that had accumulated an enormous amount of energy!

“Enormous Lightning Explosion!”

The lightning of the Hand of Silent Thunder flew towards the area with the highest density of soldiers. The lightning bolts brought with them more forking deadly lightning arcs over a few hundred meters long. They swept fiercely through the ground and air, and explosions ripped out across the areas they covered.

A piercing screech echoed in the air. The area ahead was suddenly devoured by white lightning. It felt as if the entire world had turned white all of a sudden...

The piercing screech soon disappeared. It was oddly quiet!

The blinding light lasted for a few moments, and then forking bolts of lightning over six hundred meters long danced wildly; a few seconds later, a huge explosion with a deafening blast went off! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The enormous lightning explosion produced strong shockwaves surging out almost a kilometer away in all directions, shattering the barrier and the defense protecting the Ice Mages. The Ice Mages hiding behind the barrier were all knocked into the air like stalks of grass drifting in the wind...

Captain Saks was stunned when he saw his men being devoured by the lightning!

The damage was already comparable to a Super Spell! How could an Advanced Spell possibly generate such a shocking damage?

If he knew the Summoner was so strong, why would he even bother wasting his time on Vani!?

Heidi was standing behind Mo Fan, staring at the smoking ravines left behind by the explosion. It took her some time to recover from the shock.

Mo Fan had yet to reach the Super Level, yet he already had the strength of a Super Mage. Heidi thought the Fiery Swamp Serpent was his strongest destructive spell, since it required a long Channeling time. However, it was obvious that he had more than one destructive spell that surpassed the level of an Advanced Spell!

It was difficult to imagine such an elite troop losing miserably to a single person, but the lightning explosion killed countless soldiers in the troop. Most importantly, their formations were entirely disrupted!

“Heidi, take that guy down!” Mo Fan said, while panting heavily.

“Which one?” Heidi asked with a confused look.

“Follow the shadow I sent out,” Mo Fan was a little worn out, but he still managed to summon a shadow with the Fiendish Night.

The shadow left Mo Fan’s body and floated in a certain direction like a phantom. Heidi quickly followed the pitch-black shadow.

“What now... your face is really pale, are you alright?” Mu Bai quickly came over to lend Mo Fan a hand. He would be done for if someone ambushed him now.

“Their numbers are too overwhelming. They will recover very soon. We must seize their commander while they are still panicking to guarantee our escape!” Mo Fan told him.
