The Calamity Fire was like a lotus blossoming in the sky above the ancient castle. However, the lotus immediately expanded to a shocking diameter of three hundred meters. It felt like the whole sky above the team had been set on fire!

The blossoming fire lotus was Flame Belle Empress’ Domain. Thousands of bird monsters were burned into ashes in less than a second, leaving pieces of colorful crests behind.

“Holy crap, she killed a thousand of them with just a single wave of her hand!” Jiang Yu’s jaw dropped.

The fiery lotus appeared without needing any lengthy process, nor did it need channeling like some kind of ultimate move. It felt like Flame Belle Empress was waving her hand randomly in the air and a destructive fiery lotus would explode among the creatures, immediately blasting a hole in the sky filled with feathers and claws...

“Ning~!”

Like reciting a verse, the single tone echoed in the air. Flame Belle Empress did not use the power of her Fire Element, but the power of the Space Element instead!

The whole area suddenly felt incredibly heavy. The flying creatures were having trouble beating their wings. Not long after, a huge lot of them suddenly fell from the sky...

Gravity!

Little Flame Belle was using gravitational force to crush the flying birds!

The strange birds crashed onto the rocks, and blood splattered across the place. In order to make sure that the creatures would not rise into the sky again, Flame Belle Empress blew at the rocks...

A strong, scorching gust instantly set the rocks ablaze, like a giant burning whirlpool. The strange birds were dragged into the whirlpool like grains being collected in a large wicker basket!

A giant bird among the army of monster birds uttered a cry of alarm.

Its feathers were brighter than most of the monster birds. The spectacular crest on its head implied that it was one of the leaders of the army!

The leader of the monster birds was not affected by the gravitational force. When it spread its wings, it was as huge as an airplane. It was slightly bigger than the strange bird that had chased the plane that Mo Fan was on!

“Commander-level creature!”

Everyone immediately noticed the giant bird that stood out within the horde of monster birds. They subconsciously took deep breaths.

Everyone could tell from the creature’s presence that it was a lot stronger than the Commander-level creatures the team had encountered before. The team would have crumbled if the creature had attacked them earlier.

Flame Belle Empress fixed her burning gaze on the leader of the monster birds. She crossed her hands in front of her chest and started chanting a Fire Spell without waiting for the creature to get closer.

“Ning!~”

The chant summoned red symbols to densely surround the Flame Belle Empress.

Suddenly, the symbols were ignited. The flames combined into a heavenly bird with wings!

Flame Belle Empress had turned herself into an enormous fiery bird! Her pride and nobility greatly suppressed the leader of the monster birds, like the difference between a phoenix and a rooster!

The fiery, heavenly bird beat her wings and launched countless fiery feathers into the sky. She soared into the sky filled with monster birds and left a spectacular, burning trail behind her, like a bridge in the sky!

Everything along the trail the fiery bird swept past was burned into ashes. Hundreds, and even thousands of strange birds were turned into drifting ash before they could even touch her.

Meanwhile, the leader of the monster birds totally panicked when it saw the fiery bird flying toward it with such formidable strength. It quickly beat its wings and fled into the distance.

However, its speed was no match for the Flame Belle Empress. As the purest flame surged across the sky, the leader of the monster birds cried out in agony as it was set aflame.

“They aren’t even on the same level!”

“How...how strong!”

The team could not find any words to describe their feelings when they watched the Flame Belle Empress bullying the leader of the monster birds.

When they looked at Mo Fan again, it was like they were looking at their savior. When everyone thought they were about to die, their savior Mo Fan surprisingly summoned a fiery goddess to punish the unreasonable and disdainful monster birds!

Flames spread wildly across the sky. The Flame Belle Empress was incredibly furious. Her elegant figure spun in the sky, producing a ring of flames that spread rapidly around her, killing a few thousand more monster birds.

In comparison, the whole team had only killed around eight thousand monster birds in total after giving their all, and most of them were just Servant-class creatures!

The Flame Belle Empress had already killed the same number of monster birds by tossing three to four abilities out randomly. Her strength was unbelievably outstanding. They could not help but wonder whether Mo Fan’s Contracted Beast was actually a Ruler-level creature!

Killing a Commander-level creature sadistically, butchering Warrior-level creatures within an instant, massacring Servant-class creatures like they were just numbers. Only a Ruler-level creature could look down at the lower-level creatures so disdainfully!

Even though the members on the national team were a talented bunch, only a maniac like Mo Fan had the chance to encounter Ruler-level creatures like the Silver Skyruler, the Phantom Tyrant Emperor, the Black Totem Snake, and the Mountain Zombie. Commander-level creatures were already terrifyingly strong in the eyes of the national team, none of the others had ever seen a Ruler-level creature before!

Flame Belle Empress fended off the army of a hundred thousand monster birds with ease. Only a Ruler-level creature was strong enough to do that!

“Little Flame Belle is much stronger than her mother. This is the real Flame Belle, the blessed creature of the North Burning Valley!” Even Nanyu was greatly shocked.

Nanyu had witnessed the Fiery Sorceress, Jiang Feng, sacrificing her life to protect Little Flame Belle when she was born. The strength that the Fiery Sorceress displayed at the villa back then was already quite terrifying. To her surprise, Little Flame Belle was even stronger in her mature phase. -A Ruler-level creature, she must be a Ruler-level creature!-

Nanyu could not help but fix her eyes on Mo Fan.

She had to admit that Mo Fan’s bravery to pursue justice without second thoughts had earned him a gift bestowed by Heaven!

Guan Yu and Zu Jiming, who totally disliked Mo Fan, were not only astounded, but their chests were about to explode in jealousy!

How come the person they hated the most had such a strong Contracted Beast, so strong that she could take on a horde of monster beasts alone! It felt extremely terrible, even worse than dying!

“General, look, the castle!”

“What...what’s happening?” General Mott glanced into the distance across the shoreline in astonishment.

Blazing red, the whole sky was blazing red! The army of blue and green strange birds was devoured by the redness. The scorching heat reached them even though they were ten kilometers away. Even the ocean was dyed red by the flames!

The size of the army of monster birds decreased rapidly, as if the presence that was dominating the sky was no longer their feathers and claws, but the blazing red flames!

“Such a strong and pure Fire energy... what exactly is going on there?” asked Ariosto in shock.

Could it be that the students from China possessed some power unknown to them? But wasn’t this a bit too powerful to be true!?

“The monster birds are retreating! My God, what just happened that they have to flee for their lives?!” the female advisor exclaimed.

General Mott and Ariosto watched the monster birds fleeing in all directions! They would never have believed it if they did not witness it with their own eyes...

-Running away, the entire horde of monster birds is running away...

-What kind of terrifying existence did they encounter that they had to flee for their lives?-

“What is it? What exactly is it?” General Mott started to feel uneasy. If it was able to drive the army of strange birds away... it was surely nothing ordinary!

——

The dilapidated castle was scattered with corpses of monster birds. Fresh blood smeared the cliff and the walls of the castle. It too had dyed the ocean and the rocks red.

However, the disorder was not as bad after the mess was cleaned up by the flames.

“Little Flame Belle, stop chasing, come back, come back!” Mo Fan yelled into the sky when he realized something.

Flame Belle Empress’s temper was exactly the same as Mo Fan’s. The army of monster birds was already withdrawing, yet she still chased over ten kilometers after them. It was likely she had eliminated a few thousand more of them.

When the strange birds were clustered together, it was quicker to kill them. However, once they started spreading and fleeing in different directions, it was tricky to eliminate them!

Little Flame Belle came back and landed beside Mo Fan gracefully. The flames around her looked sacred and out-of-the-world. The members of the national team were staring at her in disbelief.

-Is this empress of flames really the little creature that always stays in Mo Fan’s arms and keeps asking for hugs?-

The disparity was just shocking, and wasn’t her strength a bit too ridiculous...!

“Mo Fan, what...what the heck happened? Why did your daughter... grow all of a sudden?” asked Zhao Manyan, who was taking quite some time to collect his thoughts.

“I don’t know either. I only used something known as the Time Liquid. Apparently, it’s like a temporary growth hormone, and she ended up like this,” replied Mo Fan.

“Growth hormone... anyway, you’re a lucky bastard. The real Flame Belle is crazy!” Zhao Manyan had no idea what else to say.

“The effects are only temporary. She will soon turn back to her original form,” said Mo Fan.

Little Flame Belle needed a long time to grow. Mo Fan did not believe there existed such a ridiculous thing that could let Little Flame Belle skip her Youth Stage and reach her Mature Phase in an instant.

If the strength that Flame Belle Empress displayed was permanent, how shocking would the energy in the Time Liquid have to be? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Did...did we survive?” asked Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu’s words immediately reminded the team. They were too caught up in the shock of watching Flame Belle Empress that they totally forgot they had survived the attack of the horde of monster birds!

The sense of joy urged the team to hug one another!

“It’s all thanks to Mo Fan, and Little Flame Belle... oh, Flame Belle Empress!”

“Flame Belle Empress!”

“HAHA, this little creature is my empress from today onward!”
