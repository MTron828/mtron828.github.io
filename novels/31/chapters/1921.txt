Chapter 1923: Wolf Army vs Scarlet Soaring Demons

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Thirteen Commander-level Moon-Devouring White Wolves led the way as the army of wolves charged at the Scarlet Soaring Demons. The water nearby had been drawn away constantly by Deng Yongchuan and other Water Mages. It looked just like the tide was falling rapidly away from the beach.

Shallow water was not much of a problem for the Moon-Devouring White Wolves and the White-Marked Wolves. The remaining puddles splashed everywhere as the Moon-Devouring White Wolves lunged at the Scarlet Soaring Demons, their claws tearing around and ripping at the sea monsters’ throats with their fangs. The Scarlet Soaring Demons were just like ordinary Warrior-level creatures when there was no water around. The Commander-level Moon-Devouring White Wolves could easily massacre them all!

The Moon-Devouring White Wolves attacked multiple Scarlet Soaring Demons at once. Their fangs tore at the vulnerable parts of one Scarlet Soaring Demon, causing blood to splatter everywhere, while their claws crushed the bones of another Scarlet Soaring Demon to pieces. They promptly pounced at other Scarlet Soaring Demons nearby without having to confirm the deaths of the previous two. They wove through the Scarlet Soaring Demons, rending with their claws at every step, killing the Scarlet Soaring Demons in a straight line. Almost every Moon-Devouring White Wolf was capable of doing the same!

“Awooo!”

The Warrior-level Scarlet Soaring Demons were never Big Wolf’s target. He had set his eyes on the three Scarlet Rending Demons, who were about the same color as lava.

Big Wolf let out a provoking cry. He was basically telling them, “Come at me, the three of you!”

The leader of the Moon-Devouring White Wolves was extremely proud, yet he did have the right to be full of himself, as he was now a Great Commander, and his strength significantly surpassed the rest of the Moon-Devouring White Wolves. Meanwhile, the three Scarlet Rending Demons were only Lesser Commanders. They were a lot weaker than the Scarlet Rending Demon that Mo Fan had bumped into at Wuyuan Bay.

Big Wolf had a hot temper. When he saw the Scarlet Rending Demons standing still, he simply cleared a path by shoving the Scarlet Soaring Demons in his way aside and took the initiative to attack them!

The three Scarlet Rending Demons were surrounded by over a hundred Scarlet Soaring Demons. They assumed they were safe, but the Aura of the Moon-Devouring White Wolf gave them a huge fright when it charged at them.

Second Wolf and Third Wolf did not have good tempers, either. As the second and third leaders of the wolf den, they clearly did not want to fall too far behind Big Wolf, so they also targeted the Commander-level Scarlet Rending Demons. As the Scarlet Soaring Demons were shoved away by Big Wolf, they also managed to clear paths toward the Scarlet Rending Demons!

“Awooo!”

Mo Fan’s Beast Tide had not Summoned just the thirteen ferocious Moon-Devouring White Wolves; there were around three hundred White-Marked Wolves too! The lesser wolves sprinted down the hill toward the beach. Those watching felt like they had outnumbered the Scarlet Soaring Demons several times over, even though the Scarlet Soaring Demons still had an advantage in numbers. They were ready to reap a harvest!

The wolves charged ahead. The morale of the White-Marked Wolves peaked as their commanders were clearing paths ahead. They dove in and began to tear the Scarlet Soaring Demons to pieces!

A beast covered in blood and wounds slowly limped its way out of the pack of wolves amid the chaos.

Biling had returned to the beach. She burst into tears of joy when she saw her Sea Gong Fighter had survived.

The Sea Gong Fighter was very tenacious. Many of its bones were exposed after the Scarlet Soaring Demons tore its flesh apart, but it was still alive. However, if it weren’t for the hot-tempered Big Wolf, Second Wolf, and Third Wolf, the Sea Gong Fighter basically had no chance of surviving. The three reckless creatures had traumatized the entire troop of Scarlet Soaring Demons so much that they had completely forgotten to deal the final blow to the Sea Gong Fighter.

“Where did so many Summoned Beasts come from?” the student representative blurted out in disbelief.

It was unbelievable! The ferocious wolves were like heavenly soldiers. The library that was going to fall had instead turned into a bloodbath for the Scarlet Soaring Demons. The escape routes of the Scarlet Soaring Demons had been removed by Water Magic, and now they were no longer able to retreat to the strait!

The Scarlet Soaring Demons totally lost their sense of security after the water in the area was drawn away, and were like a sheet of loose sand when the army of wolves charged in at them. It served as a great contrast to the wolves, who were becoming braver the longer they fought.

“These...these are all your Summoned Beasts?” Biling went back to the library. She was no longer able to shift her teary eyes away from Mo Fan.

Biling was a Summoner, with the Summoning Element as her primary Element. Her Beast Tide could only Summon fifty demon rhinos at most to trample the enemy within a certain area. Such numbers were limited in use against the Scarlet Soaring Demons, as the fifty demon rhinos would soon lose their momentum against the overwhelming numbers of the Scarlet Soaring Demons.

Meanwhile, this commander’s Beast Tide was not only Summoning a bunch of creatures to clear a path, but he had simply moved a whole den of wolves from the Summoned Beast Plane over to their world. These well-trained wolves seemed to have all come from the same tribe. They were massacring the sea monsters!

“Why can you Summon so many of them at once? How did you do it?” Biling knew now was not the best time to ask it, yet she could not hold the urge back.

Three hundred Summoned Beasts! It was impossible for a normal Summoner to Summon so many creatures at once. It was not even a Super Spell!

Mo Fan did not answer her. He looked like he was very focused.

The truth was, he was not really doing much, since he had let Apas control the wolves. He could just answer the woman, yet he believed he should be reserved at times so he would be more mysterious to others. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This Miss Biling had basically taken the bait!

“We’ll discuss it in private once we are done here.” Mo Fan grasped the situation perfectly. He gave Biling a glimpse of hope just when she was about to feel disappointed.

“Oh... Sure, either way, you’ve saved my Sea Gong Fighter. Thank you so much,” Biling told him.

“I understand the precious relationship between a Summoner and their Contract Beast,” Mo Fan said.

Biling nodded solemnly.

She looked at the wolves and suddenly thought of something. If this was only his Beast Tide, what about his Contracted Beast? He had yet to Summon his Contracted Beast!
