Chapter 1410 Kill Without Mercy

Translated by XephiZ

Mo Fan rose to his feet.

When he finally stood up, with someone holding his shoulder, he realized that the pressure from the Pyramid was not as heavy as he thought. It was just that he had lost his will and strength.

He looked around. He was still in the debris of the fortress. The undead army did not disappear like scattering ashes, as if he had just woken up from a nightmare.

The Pyramid was still emitting its deathlight in the distance. Its army was trampling everywhere the deathlight could reach.

Behind him was a range of mountains. Feihuang City was within reach once the army crossed the mountains.

“Undead from Egypt?” the King of the Undead asked.

“That’s the Great Pyramid of Giza, Khufu’s mausoleum. Khufu is still alive; he’s the Lord of the Underworld now,” Mo Fan confirmed.

The King of Undead turned around and looked at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had no idea what he had said wrong, to make the man glare at him so...

“He dares to call himself the Lord of Underworld with such nonsense...” the King of Undead snapped disdainfully.

Mo Fan’s face went blank. He had no clue how the rulers of the undead divided up their territories...

BANG!

The King of Undead stomped the ground heavily. A black wave surged forward in a cone, heading straight for the magnificent Pyramid.

The Pyramid’s deathlight suddenly became unstable. There were now holes the deathlight was no longer shining upon.

The undead from Egypt could only move within the deathlight. When the holes appeared, the undead within them evaporated in just a breath or two...

The Undead Ripple the Ancient King had produced was a direct provocation to the Pyramid. It had severely restrained the pyramid’s Deathlight!

“Who dares disrupt my sacred light!?” the thunderous voice in the Pyramid demanded. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Mo Fan shivered every time he heard the voice. He was sure that the person that was talking had greatly surpassed the strongest level he was aware of. He felt a distinct urge to drop to his knees and end his own life under its enormous pressure!

“You have half a day to move your grave and your undead out of my land,” the King of Undead responded in a similarly powerful voice. It echoed across the land.

The voices were talking in two different languages, but the language used did not really matter in their conversation; it was the idea that mattered!

“Sphinx, tell him whose territory this land is going to be!” Osiris’ voice came from the Pyramid once again.

The Sphinx was lying on the ground, and finally rose to his feet. His enormous body moved forward like a formidable mountain. His eyes, now engulfed by ghastly flames, were staring at Mo Fan and the King of Undead.

The Sphinx started running. He was even quicker than before. His strength had improved significantly after he was supported by Osiris. He was emitting a golden light as he charged ferociously at his enemy!

The King of Undead did not even bother looking at the Sphinx. He was staring at the Pyramid, as if he could see the person inside it.

Khufu, an ancient existence, who was also the earliest ancestor of the undead!

The Sphinx dashed forward; even the sky and the ground were trembling before his formidable power!

A strange but powerful roar came from under the ground. A mountain suddenly emerged and soared into the sky. It reached out its huge arm and slammed it into the Sphinx that was charging so ferociously!

A strong presence of death lingered in the air. How could Mo Fan not recognize the mountain that had appeared out of nowhere? It was none other than the creature that had covered the entire Ancient Capital in fear: the Mountain Zombie!

The Mountain Zombie rose from the ground, even more impressive in size than the Sphinx. The Mountain Zombie took a few steps back when the Sphinx rammed into his hand, before lifting the Sphinx up into the air.

The Sphinx did not expect such a terrifying creature to rise from the ground out of nowhere. With shocking might, the Mountain Zombie hurled the Sphinx into the distance before he could react...

The Sphinx slammed heavily to the ground and slid a long distance, crushing countless creatures of the Underworld beneath him, leaving a carpet of pulp and bones behind.

The Mountain Zombie clearly held a strong grudge against the Sphinx that had dared to disrespect the Ancient King. He dashed forward, trampling the tiny Underworld creatures under his feet, and threw a huge punch at the Sphinx’s face.

The Sphinx’s face cracked slightly as he was knocked flying once again. The two hits in a row had left him light-headed.

Several Underworld Monarch Frogs nearby curled up into meatballs in terror when they saw their commander being beaten up.

The Mountain Zombie happened to be searching for any usable weapons. He kicked one of the Underworld Monarch Frogs and fired it at the Sphinx like a cannonball.

The Sphinx might have obdurate skin and flesh, but that clearly did not apply to the Underworld Monarch Frog. Even though they were both Ruler-level creatures, the Underworld Monarch Frog did not have the slightest chance to endure the overwhelming strength of the blow. Its body bent out of shape from the kick. The Yoked that were bound to it died a gruesome death with it, splattering onto the Underworld Monarch Frog like mosquitoes that had been slapped to death.

“Who are you!?” The voice in the Great Pyramid of Giza sounded surprised.

“Kill anyone that dares to disrupt the peace of my land without mercy!” the King of Undead ordered.

The King of Undead stomped the ground once again. A greater black ripple surged across the mountains, valleys, and loesses. The sky covered in the deathlight was shrouded by darkness as a great storm arose!

“Kill without mercy!”

“Kill without mercy!”

“Kill without mercy!”

Chants like chimes from Hell echoed across the North Valley.

Deathly figures rose from the ground between Yulin City and Feihuang City!

—

Mo Fan was unable to see what the black and red figures were from the distance. He only saw the figures spreading rapidly across the mountains, the stone mounds and sands, the rocky hills to the north, and the valleys!

The army of the Egyptian Underworld was mainly black, glowing an eerie cold blue under the deathlight.

The army that appeared after the King of Undead stomped the ground was mostly gray and red. Their auras of death lingered in the air. The glowing eyes of the army of the Ancient Capital’s undead were as dense as the stars in the night sky. Even the sun and the moon had lost their brilliance!
