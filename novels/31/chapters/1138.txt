The substitute member of the Egyptian team soon entered the match. As everyone expected, he immediately began to Summon the undead endlessly. It felt like he was quicker at Summoning the undead, as the island was soon filled up with the mummies. It even felt like the island could sink at any moment.

Mo Fan was still a few Soul Essences short, so his eyes gleamed excitedly when he saw how diligent the new member of the Egyptian team was!

-Fifth-tier Thunderbolt, here I come!-

Most people would want to stay as far away from the undead as possible, but Mo Fan was pouncing on them greedily, like he had just seen a bunch of naked ladies...

“Damn it, he doesn’t even treat me seriously!” Meos’s face darkened.

It took her great effort to summon a Commander-level undead, yet Mo Fan simply disregarded it and charged at the army of undead to continue his massacre.

The rest of the Egyptian team was dumbfounded.

-This Mo Fan, is there something wrong with his brain?-

“Eat him!” Meos snapped furiously.

A pitch-black, centipede-like skeletal demon shrouded in a Cursed aura dug its way out of the ground, shrieking a ghastly cry!

The skeletal centipede was around sixteen meters long, with a pointy tail. Its neck and head resembled that of a human, but it had two huge skulls. Its four eyes were glaring at its target menacingly. It was like a demon that had climbed out of Hell, incompatible with the living creatures in this world!

—

“It’s the Tactile Centipede Demon!”

“How could they Summon a creature like that? It’s difficult to control a creature that has such a strong lust to kill. People might even die in this match!”

“What can we do about it? The Undead Element has always been difficult to control. It’s currently listed as a Dark Magic, but we all know something bad is going to happen if it’s used in a battle between Mages!”

—

“We’ve neglected the risks involved,” the governor of Venice sighed.

It was impossible to stop the match now. Even if there were casualties, it was necessary to decide the winner between the Chinese team and the Egyptian team. The outcome of the match was extremely important to the countries involved, as the prize for the first place was a lot better than the prize for second place!

“Let’s just hope the participants stay safe. I bet the world won’t approve of the Egyptian team’s method even if they win the match. There are quite a lot of Evil or Forbidden Magicks that can grant a Mage extraordinary power for a short period, but the people that pursue them always bring doom upon themselves, resulting in great disasters to mankind. Only orthodox Magic can guarantee our future,” the representative of the Holy Judgment Court said disdainfully.

The Holy Judgment Court was an organization that the Magic Associations of the Five Continents had established. They were not responsible for punishing Mages that committed crimes, but those that practiced Evil Magic!

Magic was derived for all kinds of uses, and humans had invented all kinds of magic in the past. However, the only magic that was suitable for humans to practice and pass down was the magic included in the Four Main Magic Types.

Those that were not deemed orthodox were considered Forbidden Magic!

Among the Forbidden Magicks, those that could endanger people’s lives, influence their consciousness, or bring massacre upon living creatures were counted as Evil Magic!

The magic that the Black Vatican used to turn people into Cursed Beasts was a typical Evil Magic.

Turning living people into Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts, giving normal people the power to Summon undead or use the Undead Element; anyone that practiced these Evil arts was a target of the Holy Judgment Court. Unfortunately, the Black Vatican had infiltrated society, making it extremely difficult to identify them. It had grown into a powerful organization, so governments, associations, renowned clans, alliances, and militaries had to work together against it.

The magic that the Egyptian team used was still under the Undead Element, so the Holy Judgment Court did not have a valid reason to forbid it. As a result, the organizer had no reason to forbid its usage in the tournament...

However, even though the Egyptian team did not break the rules, the people could still tell if they were crossing the line.

Their actions were the same as athletes consuming a kind of drug to boost their performance, and because the drug was newly invented, it was not yet listed among the forbidden drugs!

The Tactile Centipede Demon summoned a Cursed wind that looked like a puff of black smoke. It was going after Mo Fan. It raised its spear-like legs and lunged at Mo Fan!

Mo Fan harrumphed coldly when he noticed the creature.

The creature might look intimidating, but it did not necessarily mean the creature was strong. It wanted to scare him with its horrible appearance, yet it had forgotten to ask his demon blood for approval!

“Be gone!” Mo Fan kicked the shoulder of a Death Axes Mummy and launched himself at the heads of the Tactile Centipede Demon!

Gathering his will in the form of a fist, Mo Fan threw a punch at the left head of the Tactile Centipede Demon!

There was a powerful impact. The Tactile Centipede Demon rocked backward after receiving the hit. A huge part of its skull broke into pieces!

The Tactile Centipede Demon skidded a few dozen meters back. When it finally recovered from the strong hit, its eyes emitted a terrifying, bloody glow!

The Tactile Centipede Demon opened its mouth. Surprisingly, the Tactile Centipede Demon’s throat was not located in its two heads, but between its two brains...

Its two brains were hanging out the nasty opening; it looked incredibly strange and hideous!

“Trying to spit something out?” Mo Fan chuckled coldly. He raised his hands as he was wrapped by a mysterious silver light. The Star Orbits of the Space Element vanished seconds after they were drawn, granting Mo Fan the power to control everything!

“Have a taste of rotten flesh!” Mo Fan unleashed his will and directed it at the Dark Red Mummies below him.

The Dark Red Mummies were lifted into the air like little chicks, before they were unceremoniously shoved right into the open mouth of the Tactile Centipede Demon!

The Tactile Centipede Demon was about to spit out a cursed wind, yet its mouth was stuffed full of Dark Red Mummies. The cursed wind was stuck in its throat, leaving the creature in terrible pain!

“Have some more! The giant centipede I saw at Dongting Lake was a lot healthier than you. Look how skinny you are, the people might think that Egypt is suffering from famine, since they can’t even feed you well!” Mo Fan calmly grabbed another bunch of Dark Red Mummies.

These little undead had no chance of escaping Mo Fan’s control. They were lifted into the air and were shoved into the Tactile Centipede Demon’s mouth like rice.

“What are you doing, just stuffing them in your mouth? Swallow them!” Mo Fan was utterly impatient. He threw another punch, and knocked the cluster of Dark Red Mummies deeper into the Tactile Centipede Demon’s throat.

A part of the Tactile Centipede Demon’s body swelled up when the Dark Red Mummies were forcibly knocked down its throat into its body. They had most likely reached its stomach!

“Explode!” Mo Fan clenched his fist, detonating the Dark Red Mummies inside the Tactile Centipede Demon’s stomach. The flames surged wildly in the creature’s stomach, further expanding it. It skeletal body could not endure the overwhelming force, and the creature soon exploded into pieces!

Broken bones scattered across the place. The Tactile Centipede Demon’s upper body slammed into the ground not far away from Mo Fan, while its lower body and tail stuck into the ground like a giant sword, right in front of Meos. Her face immediately paled!

“It’s pretty nasty to look at, too bad it didn’t manage to take many of my hits!” Mo Fan chuckled. Meos felt her chest throbbing after seeing Mo Fan’s smug attitude, and almost had an urge to vomit blood.

“I can Summon as many creatures like it as I want!” Meos insisted. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Sayed could no longer stand it. He said in a low voice, “This Mo Fan is very experienced at fighting against undead, and he has lots of Elements with powerful Basic and Intermediate Spells too! The undead strategy isn’t as effective against the Chinese team as it was against the other teams! We’ll need to work together to Summon a strong undead. If we don’t take him out soon, our Pharaoh Spring is going to run out!”

“That just means we’ll all the Pharaoh Spring even quicker. Be patient, let’s try and wear him out!” Neferu said.

It did not matter how discontented Meos was. The truth was, she was unable to Summon a Commander-level creature like the Tactile Centipede Demon for a short period...

“Meos, your Tactile Centipede Demon was torn to pieces.”

“This Mo Fan knows the undead can regenerate! Damn it!”

“Stop wasting the Pharaoh Spring, just keep Summoning the Dark Red Mummies. I don’t believe the mummies won’t overrun them!”

Meos was almost spitting flames out of her eyes, but she could not do anything to Mo Fan. Even a high-level creature like the Tactile Centipede Demon was defeated within moments!

The Tactile Centipede Demon’s bones were scattered across the place. However, Mo Fan still managed to locate its undead crystal accurately. He crushed it into pieces, not giving the Tactile Centipede Demon any chance to regenerate!

The Tactile Centipede Demon was weaker than it seemed. Its only strength was its ability to regenerate after it was shattered into pieces.

However, Mo Fan was well aware of its ability. He was way more experienced than the other participants. The Egyptian team could not stop him without Summoning five or six Tactile Centipede Demons to keep him busy!

—

“More of these things? Awesome!” Mo Fan seemed annoyed when he saw the undead charging at him, but he was actually overjoyed inside.

They are giving him money again!

Although Mo Fan had yet to discover how the Egyptian team was able to Summon so many undead so endlessly, he noticed that the odds of these undead dropping a Soul Essence were a lot higher, at least twice or thrice the odds of the undead at the Ancient Capital! It was likely that the Egyptian team was expending some energy to Summon the undead, and since the energy that remained after the undead were killed was still abundant, the chance of them dropping a Soul Essence was higher!

A Servant-class Soul Essence was around five million, and a Warrior-level Soul Essence was around twenty million. Mo Fan was earning a fortune by just casting Basic and Intermediate Spells. He was hoping that the match would drag on longer, so he could strengthen all then Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Spells of his five Elements. He would then be unbeatable!

To prevent the Egyptian team from noticing that he was actually earning a fortune from their undead, Mo Fan had to pretend that he was struggling a little too, just so the Egyptian team would assume that they might be able to take him out by Summoning more undead!

“Forty-nine Warrior-level Soul Essences, hehe, that’s the fifth-tier Thunderbolt!” Mo Fan mumbled with a cunning grin. By his rough estimate, the Soul Essences that the Egyptian team had given him were worth around eight hundred million!
