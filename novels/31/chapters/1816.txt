Mu Bai arrived early in the morning on the second day. He was casually taking the high-speed rail. When he heard Zhao Manyan was poisoned, he immediately shook off his worn-out look and became intent.

“I happened to have come up with a new way to get rid of poison!” Mu Bai’s eyes were smiling like a cunning fox who had finally found its prey.

“Piss off, don’t you dare try and put something strange into my body again!” Zhao Manyan cursed after he recalled how Mu Bai had mended his broken bones in the past. However, he sounded a little feeble due to the poison in his body.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened when he heard the exchange between the two. “I have been wondering why the two of you either have no girlfriend or keep changing your girlfriend. I suppose you two already have intimate contacts with one another?”

“Here is a silkworm I discovered behind Fanxue Mountain. The species specifically nurtures itself with poison. If you want to recover as soon as possible, you should swallow the silkworm. It will absorb the poisonous substances in your body,” Mu Bai said sternly.

It was a great discovery that Mu Bai had made while he was cultivating in seclusion recently. He had asked Yu Shishi to raise a few of the species he had found. Antidotes were always in short supply, and even the best Healer would struggle to heal a few kinds of poison. By bringing a few of the Antidote Silkworms with him, he would be able to guarantee his own safety!

Mu Bai would definitely open a store if he could figure out a way to mass breed the Antidote Silkworms. He would be able to earn some funds to buy himself some Magic Equipment!

Zhao Manyan was struggling to make up his mind. He eventually ate the silkworm when he remembered his goal was to look for the Totem Beasts and achieve the Super Level.

The Antidote Silkworm was very effective. Zhao Manyan regained his vigor as the rest of the group had their meal. He was back to normal only an hour later!

“Time to go, those sons of b**ches, we’ll force our way onto Dawn Island and get our revenge!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

“By the way, Old Zhao, have you taken a dump?” Mu Bai asked him.

“What dump?” Zhao Manyan was puzzled.

“You have to get rid of the silkworm first, or do you want it to climb out of your throat after crawling through your intestines? I don’t really mind either way,” Mu Bai informed him.

“Ugh, screw you!” Zhao Manyan cursed in dismay.

——

Zhao Manyan had learned two important things when he tried to scout the island. First, there were a huge number of highly aggressive creatures hiding around Dawn Island. These creatures would attack anything that tried to reach Dawn Island from the air. Defensive spells were not enough to hold the creatures off for a long time. Second, the creatures were poisonous, and the poison would drain away its victim’s focus and energy. The victims would lose their ability to fight and escape after an hour or two. Therefore, they had to be extremely careful not to get injured.

“Our problem is that we can’t reach the island,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan’s fighting ability would be reduced greatly if he was not on land. He needed somewhere to stand, be it flying or traveling on a boat. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“What if we ask Mu Bai to freeze the water, the same thing we did when we were on the national team?” Jiang Shaoxu suggested.

Zhao Manyan immediately shook his head, “Those boomerangs were destroyers. They would instantly smash the ice to pieces!”

“My Ice Magic’s freezing is pretty normal too. Mu Ningxue can easily freeze a huge area with her Innate Ice Domain, but it’s a strenuous task for me, and would cost me a huge amount of energy, too,” Mu Bai agreed, shaking his head.

Mu Ningxue was able to freeze the surface of an ocean, but that did not mean he could do it too. It was not about his cultivation, but his capabilities!

“I hated fighting on water the most,” Mo Fan shrugged, considering the ocean his greatest nemesis.

“Why don’t you ask your teacher if she has any ideas?” Jiang Shaoxu proposed.

“Yeah, she has been here for quite some time. She should know what the creatures in the water are and how to deal with them,” Zhao Manyan said.

“What teacher?” Mu Bai had to ask.

The group found Tangyue and the others, who were watching the sea from the cliff.

This time, it was not just Li Dong and Zhu Min with her; another nine members of the Enforcement Union were standing behind her too. They seemed to be taking orders from Tangyue. The two Enforcers who were patrolling the cliff while smoking last night were among them. They seemed to be worn out, whether it was because they had been working overnight, or they had gone to enjoy themselves somewhere in town.

“These Enforcers seriously lack some discipline,” Lingling murmured after observing Tangyue’s men from a distance.

“Mm, I bet they are a bunch of seniors who aren’t really controlled by their superiors,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had often crossed paths with the Enforcement Union. Most Enforcers had a stern aura, but judging from the attitudes of the two who were patrolling the cliff last night and the behaviors of the others today, it was very likely that Tangyue was leading a bunch of useless Enforcers.

The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union had been around for a long time, and had been reluctant to obey the Lingyin Enforcement Union’s orders for many years. Tangyue was like an ambitious general assigned to a camp of unambitious soldiers. It explained why the case was not yet resolved. How was it possible to resolve such a tricky situation without an elite squad?

“Vice Chief, please don’t treat our lives as a joke. How can we even make it to Dawn Island with our numbers? Even if we did, how are we going to make it back alive? The lives of a hundred townsfolk that were poisoned are precious, but ours aren’t?” a middle-aged man who had been patrolling the cliff last night said. He was even holding a cigarette between his fingers, as if he was going to light it at any second.

“Vice Chief, we want to save their lives too, but if you are only planning to bring the few of us along, there’s no way we can make it alive according to the information we’ve gathered. If we all die, Wanggui Town is seriously in deep trouble,” another Enforcer added.

Tangyue’s chest was rising with her angry breathing. These Enforcers of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union were beyond unreliable!

It had already been a month, but they had failed to find any useful clues, nor had they come up with a plan to resolve the situation. They did not even investigate the island. She could not help but wonder why the Magic Association and the country even bothered feeding these people!

Every job given to the Enforcement Union was supposed to be dangerous for normal Mages. Otherwise, why would they call themselves Enforcers?

“You’re dismissed!” Tangyue knew there was no point venting her anger on these people. They had no intention of risking their lives.

The people were relieved as soon as they heard the word. They all quickly went on their way, leaving Tangyue behind alone.
