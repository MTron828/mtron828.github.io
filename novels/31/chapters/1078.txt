The American team was incredibly strong. The madwoman with the Lightning Element would obviously be a tough opponent to fight.

The reason they fled was not because they did not dare to fight Jack and his crew, but because there were still lots of treasures waiting to be discovered. Only idiots would waste their time on some meaningless battles!

Both Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were in need of resources. Despite their urge to fight other participants, their current priority was to pillage as many resources as they could!

“I guess there’s no need to look for the others. It’s fine if we find Jiang Shaoxu or Jiang Yu, but the thought of finding Mu Tingying, Li Kaifeng, Nanrong Ni, and the others disgusts me,” Mo Fan told Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue nodded. It was true that the two of them would have an easier time searching the place on their own, as they could easily engage or flee from a battle as they pleased.

“I saw a number of people gathering at that mountain when I was flying in the air just then,” Mu Ningxue pointed at a tall mountain, half-shrouded by black clouds.

“More people means there must be something fascinating there!” Mo Fan’s eyes glittered instantly.

“So we’re going there? I already saw more than four groups of people moving toward it,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Don’t worry, speaking of which, what Jack tried to do gave me an idea,” Mo Fan said.

“What idea?” Mu Ningxue was confused. The man was trying to rob them. What idea could he possibly give Mo Fan?

“The two of us are currently in deep trouble. Once the World College Tournament comes to an end, Lu Yilin’s clan will be hunting me, and you will have to fight the Mu Clan, too. If we aren’t able to improve significantly in the World College Tournament, we are surely going to have a hard time later. Besides, you need lots of resources, and so do I... if we keep searching around like headless flies, and wasting our time with the people trying to rob us, we won’t be able to secure enough resources to achieve our goals,” Mo Fan said.

“What are you trying to say?” Mu Ningxue could see a cunning look in Mo Fan’s eyes, yet she was struggling to read Mo Fan’s mind.

Wasn’t the situation obvious enough? The participants were searching for the resources scattered across the space. The treasure hunt was held to test the students’ ability to observe, and survive in the wild, while provoking the students to compete for the resources. Was there any other way that could possibly get them lots of resources?

Mo Fan looked at Mu Ningxue and said with a serious face, “Robbing is faster than finding.”

Mu Ningxue opened her mouth wide. She was lost for words all of a sudden.

“Think about it. If we try searching for the loot, most of them are being guarded by demon creatures. It’s obvious that the organizer has placed the treasure inside the nests or caves of demon creatures. It’s tricky enough to deal with the demon creatures, and even when we finally get our hands on the treasure, someone else might be waiting for us just so they can rob us when we have done most of the hard work. If we’re unlucky enough to get robbed, we’re only going to lose all our loot! Instead of wasting our time, it’s better if we focus on robbing the others. It’s a lot easier too; we just need to find the right target, take away their loot, and run away. If we’re lucky enough, we can steal their loot without fighting them!” Mo Fan said with glittering eyes.

Mu Ningxue was stunned for a while. It took her some time to collect her thoughts, “But...but that doesn’t sound right!”

“But do you agree that it’s a better idea?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mmm...” Mu Ningxue hesitated.

To be honest, she did not expect Mo Fan to come up with such a wicked idea. On second thought, he was seriously crossing the line. It was surely going to offend lots of people!

“I assume that you’ve agreed if you kept quiet!” Mo Fan dragged Mu Ningxue over to his side without giving her time to think about it.

It was unlikely that Mo Fan could do it on his own. The sixteen teams that were left in the tournament were all worthy opponents, and each member would possess remarkable strength. It was unwise for Mo Fan to try robbing others by himself.

However, it was different with Mu Ningxue on his team. Mu Ningxue was now strong enough to take on an entire team, and with his multiple Elements, he could take on four to five people at once. Besides, they were not going to fight the others to death. They would flee as soon as they got their hands on the loot, and even if they failed their attempt, they could still run away!

“We can wear masks or change our outfits too. Although it doesn’t really guarantee that the others won’t know who we are, at least they won’t realize our identities so easily,” Mu Ningxue proposed.

It was Mo Fan’s turn to be left speechless. He looked at Mu Ningxue with a blank face.

Mu Ningxue was slightly embarrassed when she noticed Mo Fan’s gaze. She said softly, “Did I say something wrong?”

“No, I just didn’t expect you to come up with such a brilliant plan. Xuexue, you really are talented at this!” Mo Fan exclaimed with a smile.

Mu Ningxue simply ignored the comment.

If Mu Ningxue was not in her current situation, she really did not feel like doing something that would damage her reputation. However, when she recalled her situation, bearing the shame of a close relative being a member of the Black Vatican, and how the Mu Clan was picking on her, she felt like she had no choice but to follow Mo Fan in doing evil deeds!

At the foothill of the Gray Python Mountain, a few students activated their Boots Equipment and were running rapidly toward the mountain ridge in the distance.

The students were incredibly fast. They were able to travel more hundreds of meters in the blink of an eye. Moments later, they were already a kilometer away.

“Let’s split up, we’ll regroup again once we escape from those French!” an Italian contestant named Angelo said.

The others nodded. They immediately left while providing cover for Angelo.

The five split up and ran in different directions. Shortly afterwards, a few other groups showed up. They looked in the directions of the five students, and were clueless about who they were supposed to go after.

“Damn it, we don’t know who took the Heart of Stone. That’s the most valuable loot we have found. It took almost twenty people just to defeat the Rock Golem on the mountain, and our French team obviously contributed the most! How dare they take away the Heart of Stone!” a French student snapped furiously.

“Chase after them, they won’t be too far away. We can’t let them get away!” a Japanese contestant said angrily. The Japanese team had contributed a lot too, and one of their members was severely injured because of it. If they could not find their Healer soon, the student would be disqualified from the treasure hunt!

“You guys, take that way; we’ll go this way, and the few of you, go after that woman!” Lyon, a French Mage, directed them.

Not long after they arrived in the space, they had discovered a rare Rock Demon on the top of the mountain. The Rock Demon was incredibly valuable, as its heart was like an energy core of the Earth Element, enough to support a small city. The Constructors desperately needed them for their work.

Since the demon creature was quite an obvious target, more teams started to make their way toward it. In addition, the Rock Golem was fairly strong, so the teams had to work together to defeat it. However, even though they had reached a deal on how to distribute the resources, the Italian team simply took the Heart of Stone and fled. The others realized that there was no such thing as allies in the treasure hunt, since the team with the most resources was most likely going to win in the upcoming matches!

“HAHAHA, what a bunch of idiots, they seriously think they could lead the team and split the loot evenly like a group of Hunters. We’re no Hunters, we’re meant to be competitors!” Angelo burst out laughing when he saw that he had shaken off his pursuers.

They had surely earned a fortune. A Heart of Stone was usually sold for four hundred million, and if its quality was higher than average, he could even sell it for five hundred million. There were so many people that had fought against the Rock Demon. If they were to split the profit among twenty people, each of them would only receive a small portion of the profit.

But everything was fine now, since the Heart of Stone now belonged to him!

He was almost at the mountain ridge. Angelo no longer had to worry about the French and the Japanese. He could easily play a whole searching team like a fiddle in the ridge!

“Strange, why is the sky so dark all of a sudden?” Angelo lifted his gaze and saw a pitch-black curtain looming over him. It looked rather spooky.

Crap! Angelo was stunned for a moment, then realized that he had stepped into a trap.

However, as he was about to run away, he was suddenly surrounded by sharp ice cylinders that sealed off his escape routes.

“Who’s there?!” Angelo demanded furiously.

The darkness with Giant Shadow Spikes fell down, constructing the powerful confining formation and forcibly entrapped Angelo within it.

It did not matter how quick Angelo reacted. It was extremely difficult for anyone to break free once they stepped into a trap set up with the Shadow Element. They could only stand and watch the shadowy swords penetrating their body, which further sealed off their mind, making it impossible for them to move or use their thoughts.

“We kindly accept your generous offering...” a masked man appeared and said in a hoarse voice that was obviously fake.

“Asshole, you shameless prick dares to rob the Italian team, you’re going to pay for it!” Angelo cursed furiously.

“So you can still talk, it turns out that your cultivation is quite impressive. You accuse us of being shameless, yet your team isn’t any good, either! You’re trying to keep the loot to yourself when you agreed to split the profit evenly in the first place. We’re only serving justice on behalf of the Heavens,” Mo Fan said piously.

Mo Fan walked up to Angelo and calmly took the expensive Heart of Stone from him.

“Let’s go!” Mu Ningxue urged Mo Fan. She did not want to waste time.

Mo Fan was too lazy to fool around with the Italia. He purposely said to Mu Ningxue, “How smart was Jack, he knew the guy was going to come this way, so he asked us to intercept him here...”

Angelo almost lost his mind when he saw Mo Fan leaving with the valuable loot, yet there was nothing he could do when he was restrained both physically and mentally. He could only keep the name Jack in mind!
