2992 The Mourning of The Holy City

Shlick!

Shalitha’s head was finally separated from his body. Mo Fan picked up his head like a melon from a farm. He looked at it and thought there was nothing special about it. He then casually flung it to the side.

Shalitha’s body twitched.

Mo Fan crouched down by the side. He observed the body for a while in case the archangel had any supernatural abilities that would have allowed him to be resurrected from the dead.

It was only after Mo Fan confirmed that Shalitha was truly dead that he left in satisfaction.

Mo Fan walked to Lingling. He noticed that her hands had turned purple as a result of frostbite.

He took her hands into his. A gush of gentleness and warmth spread and gradually removed the chill in her body.

Lingling looked pale. It took a few minutes before her cheeks turned pinkish again.

Mo Fan’s heart was full of conflicting emotions as he looked at Lingling.

Lingling was indeed not an ordinary girl. Even the Forbidden Mages from Osaka dared not approach this place, and yet, she did. She also saved him from the valley of death in front of Shalitha.

“What if Shalitha still had some energy left in him and killed you with a snap of his finger? Promise me. No more of such foolishness in the future,” said Mo Fan. His heart ached for her.

Lingling was truly fearless. She saved him from the Archangel of Murder. Even the newly promoted Wicked God almost died in that archangel’s hands.

“Instead of waiting for an uncertain outcome like a fool, I might as well take the risk,” said Lingling.

“You’re right. We picked the right bet, but we didn’t win. What should we do next?” Mo Fan breathed out a long sigh. It was not a sigh of relief of having survived this dangerous encounter. It was because he knew that the real horror had just begun.

“We don’t have a way out of this anymore,” said Lingling.

“We?” Upon hearing Lingling’s words, he could not help but reach out to hold her face. “It’s not us, this time. It’s me. Girl, are you really sure you want to join me in overthrowing the Holy City?”

“Don’t you even think about leaving me behind,” said Lingling fiercely as she slapped Mo Fan’s hand away.

“I don’t intend to leave anyone behind, but I have my own plans. You should go back to school and study hard. I now find that magic can’t change the world, but knowledge can,” said Mo Fan to Lingling.

“What’s your plan?” Lingling panicked. She could somewhat guess what he was thinking.

“I need more time. I can’t start a war with the Holy City now, so I’ve decided to go to the Holy City and let them hold me for trial. With that, I can stall for time,” said Mo Fan.

“If you go to them now, they won’t treat you fairly!” said Lingling furiously.

Mo Fan tried to persuade Lingling that things were not that bad. “Lingling, don’t be so quick to judge everything negatively because of that scum of an angel. How sure are you to say that the Holy City and its entire ruling class are hopeless? Even if they are, I’ll still fight till the end. At the end of the day—”

“You don’t want to get us involved in the situation. That is what you are planning! I am not a child!” retorted Lingling.

“I know you aren’t a child anymore. You’ve always been smarter than most people, and you’re better at judging a situation than anyone else,” said Mo Fan.

“You chose to face judgment in the Holy City because you want to protect others. But you have to know that those people whom you want to protect are willing to go to hell and back with you if you face a life-or-death situation!” Lingling shouted at Mo Fan.

‘Those people whom you want to protect are willing to go to hell and back with you…’

Mo fan felt a gush of warmth in his heart after hearing those words.

“If that’s the case, I think I’ve lived a good life.” Mo Fan did not expect Lingling to say such touching words. He hugged her.

“So, are you still going to surrender yourself?” Lingling buried her head in his arms.

“I’m not surrendering myself. We all need more time,” said Mo Fan.

“But…”

Lingling’s words were on the tip of her tongue when she felt slightly suffocated because her heart was full. Mo Fan hugged her tightly, as if just a simple hug wouldn’t be enough to make an impact on his memories.

Lingling, though, saw it as another goodbye. She remained silent. She cherished the moment. At least she was prepared for it. Lingling finally let go of her restlessness.

“I like—”

“You’re still young. Don’t say things like that.”

“I liked the days when we used to catch demons together.”

“Oh, okay—”

...

The foothill on the east of the Alps Mountain was the world’s cleanest wilderness nourished by snow and ice. It was a vast and endless land. A magnificent and ancient city was built on the land.

Stepping into the land felt like returning to Europe’s prosperous era. There were tall city walls and an ancient gate. It was surrounded by crystal-clear ice and snow.

The architecture of the city was exquisite. The streets were spotless. The colorful magical barriers were like sheer veils. They were formed to protect the noble lady—the Holy City. The barriers enhanced the beauty of the city.

This was a city where miracles happened. Its distinctive style attracted numerous tourists every year. The city had a strong religious presence. It was the Mages’ supreme religion. The magical cultivation path was long and difficult. It was tedious and painful. The thought of being able to occupy a place in the Holy City filled them with hope and power.

The Holy City was full of colors, especially with the gold that represented holiness. The rose gold represented femininity, the white gold represented purity, and the brownish gold represented majesty.

However, the Holy City had another color today. It was shrouded in black. Black signified mourning. Black symbols were seen everywhere.

Black feathers filled up the corners of the streets.

Black flags were everywhere.

Devotees of the Holy City strolled slowly through the streets while dressed in monk-style black clothing. They held a black chalice filled with clean water with a willow branch dipped in it. They sprinkled the water onto the roads.

This was a ritual of sorts.

It was a custom of mourning in the Holy City. If one of the Archangels passed away in Holy City, they would hold this ritual to mourn for them. It was a solemn sight.

“He died for us.”

“Shalitha’s name will be engraved on the majestic monument on the sacred peak of Alps Mountain.”

“We’ll remember him in our hearts. We’ll bring that demon to justice!”

“We’ll search for him even to the ends of the world. We’ll trace his demonic aura. We won’t rest until we catch him and put him to death. We pray this in the name of the Archangel Shalitha!”

The foghorn-like voice of the Archangel Ramiel swore to heaven over the city gates.

People used the bridge to enter and exit the city. They lowered their heads and dared not even utter a word or bring up the subject.

Three days ago, sensational news spread around the world. One of the archangels who monitored the world, the Archangel Shalitha, was tragically beheaded in Japan. And the murderer was Mo Fan!

Today, the Holy City mourned for the death of the Archangel Shalitha. The Mages who entered the city felt its wrath. The supreme, divine right of the Holy City had never been trampled this way before in the past!

“You don’t have to pursue me to the ends of the world. I’m right here.”

The Archangel Ramiel’s shout resounded throughout the city when a man in front of the city gate removed his hood. The man had his hands in his pockets and stood before the priesthood of the Holy City.

“M-Mo Fan!”

“Mo Fan!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“He’s the Wicked God!”

“No, he’s a demon!”

The crowd was so scared that they fled everywhere. Meanwhile, the priests and Archangels mourning for Shalitha’s death looked confused.
