“Mo Fan, you’ve always been the hero. It’s my turn to put on a show this time!” Zhao Manyan declared proudly.

With the Totem Beast Baxia’s help, he was going to change the situation in a city that was currently fighting disaster. There was nothing more satisfying than this, especially when he heard Xiamen had a lot of beautiful women. After he saved the city, many beauties were going to take the initiative to climb into his bed. He could change his partner every day, or perhaps enjoy the company of a few of them every day...

“Alright, Baxia, show those two idiots the strength of the Totem Beast!” Zhao Manyan was extremely excited.

As a matter of fact, he never imagined the defense of a huge number of Mages was inferior to the power he possessed. The sense of being superior to everything felt more pleasant than women!

Zhao Manyan pointed forward and unleashed the unruliness and passion he had long withheld as he gave Baxia a command!

“Charge!” Zhao Manyan shouted once again.

The enormous Baxia stood in the strait, a watery valley between island and shore.

He did not move, but the eyes hidden under his thick skin were staring at Qiu Chi and Qiu Zi. He completely treated Zhao Manyan’s excited cry as some insignificant breeze.

Zhao Manyan immediately felt awkward when the creature totally ignored his order.

“Old Zhao, stop acting like he’s going to listen to you,” Mo Fan helpfully added another blow.

“Damn it, this old tortoise, he never listens to me. Why does he keep looking down on me? I’m a Super Mage now!” Zhao Manyan blushed.

“Can Baxia handle them? Those two creatures aren’t easy to deal with!” Mo Fan said with a worried face.

“It’s going to be a little tricky, but I can ask the advisors to lend Baxia a hand,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

Baxia was concentrating intently. He was currently in his focused stance.

He could not afford to charge recklessly. Qiu Chi was one of the few creatures in the East China Sea that could match his strength. If he seriously followed Zhao Manyan’s rather dumb order, he would lose in just a few rounds.

However, Qiu Chi was even more anxious!

They were so close to destroying the Jimei Bridge. Once the rest of the sea monsters arrived, the city would turn into their hunting ground and festival grounds.

Baxia’s intervention had completely ruined their plan!

More humans were being evacuated from the city. Qiu Chi was losing its patience as the prey creatures of the hunting ground it had carefully planned were sneaking away!

Qiu Chi was the first to move. Its back was like a sea dragon with a jagged spine. It completely exposed its jagged bones as it uttered a furious roar. The jagged bones turned into countless terrifying swords.

Qiu Chi curled its body and dug its head into its chest, like a rhinoceros with horns on its back, pointing its weapons at the enemy!

Everyone thought Qiu Chi was going to gather its momentum while charging at its target, yet the enormous creature suddenly lunged forward at a terrifying pace.

The seawater and the island nearby were shattered into pieces by the sudden burst of speed. Qiu Chi had turned into a meteorite covered in sharp weapons. It swept through the strait and headed right at Baxia!

The shockwave from the collision between the two enormous creatures could easily sweep a few kilometers away. Qiu Chi rammed into Baxia with its sharp bones. However, the latter was utterly reckless. He simply withstood the blow with his flesh.

His enormous body was continuously forced backward by Qiu Chi. He was initially two kilometers away from the bridge, but he almost destroyed the bridge when he was knocked back by the force of the impact.

“Don’t let them collide into the bridge!” Zhao Manyan yelled after he realized what the Disastrous Duo were up to. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Baxia’s body began to emit a brown light. His weight increased rapidly under the special Totem glow. His body sank slightly into the water as he turned into an immovable boulder.

The remaining shockwave swept at the bridge. Many Mages were still protecting it with Magic Formations, or the force could easily have knocked the bridge down.

“Be careful of Qiu Zi!” Zhao Manyan reminded Baxia.

Qiu Zi was an extremely cunning creature. It immediately dove into the sea, its body was releasing a lot of steam as soon as Qiu Chi rammed into Baxia. It quickly followed behind Qiu Chi and snuck up to Baxia while the two enormous creatures were brawling!

Qiu Zi’s head bore a pointed reptilian muzzle. Its head was not particularly huge, but when it opened its mouth, it could extend its bite a huge margin. The fangs exposed under its upper jaw were brimming with heat!

The scorching bite was effective against many creatures with thick skin. Qiu Chi was holding Baxia’s neck and head firmly. The Disastrous Duo had a certain level of synergy. Qiu Chi was preventing Baxia from withdrawing his neck and head into his shell so Qiu Zi could bite his neck!

The brown light around Baxia intensified. It quickly Summoned a shield of brown energy above him. Qiu Zi ended up biting the shield, resulting in a thunderous clanking sound.

Fresh blood jetted out of Qiu Zi’s fangs. It had set itself up by trying to defeat Baxia with its first attempt. It quickly dove back into the water.

Qiu Zi did not dare to compete with Baxia in terms of strength. If Baxia had a chance to get his hands on it, he could easily break its bones!

Qiu Chi had parasites both on its skin and inside its body. Countless demon leeches were crawling onto Baxia’s skin while they were in a standoff.

The demon leeches had no chance of harming Baxia, yet they contained a strong acid in their bodies. If they climbed onto Baxia and detonated themselves, they would splatter the acid all over Baxia’s skin. The acid would corrode his thick skin!

“Those leeches are Baxia’s weakness!” Zhao Manyan blurted out when he saw the blisters forming on Baxia’s skin.

“We can’t just stand here and watch. Old Zhao, tell Baxia to focus on those two. We’ll handle the parasites!” Mo Fan said.
