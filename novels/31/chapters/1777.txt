“Reporting, a few Granite Beasts are blocking the path ahead! They are staying close to the Black-Silver Rock Demon. We can only engage the Black-Silver Rock Demon after taking them out,” Vice Captain Jin said.

Wen Xia glanced at Mo Fan. He asked, “How long will it take for you and your men to deal with them?”

“Ten minutes at most!” Wen Xia was very confident in her men.

“Alright, you will engage the Granite Beasts to distract the Black-Silver Rock Demon while I find a way to its back to deliver a serious blow to it. This Black-Silver Rock Demon is the weakest among them, so we shouldn’t waste too much time on it,” Mo Fan said.

The most annoying thing about these monsters was their ability to absorb humans, so if they were unable to eliminate the monsters quicker than they were absorbing humans, the city was done for. Therefore, they had to pick up their pace of eliminating the creatures. They could not allow these creatures to keep evolving by absorbing the Mages in the city!

“Alright, we’ll engage it from the front ten minutes from now. Please inflict some serious damage on it,” Wen Xia nodded.

Wen Xia had yet to witness Mo Fan’s true strength, but she still had lingering fear of almost being injured by Mo Fan’s magic when she was Sealing his Elements. This Mo Fan might be stronger than the rumors had mentioned!

Mo Fan took a different route and left. Deputy Lieutenant Hou harrumphed and said, “He indeed ran away when the situation didn’t favor us. We can never rely on these young Mages.”

“It’s not like we are relying on him in the first place. Come, let’s not waste our time here.”

Mo Fan followed the stairs down and crossed a street that was at a lower level to find his way to the back of the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

A figure suddenly appeared as soon as he entered the debris-covered street while trying to find a way to avoid the Rock Generals and Granite Beasts. The figure immediately dragged him into an alley.

“Fan Mo, I finally found you. Did you manage to save Tao Jing? How are the others?” Lin Qihui was so nervous that he was speaking incoherently.

“Senior...Senior Lin?” It took Mo Fan a while to recognize Lin Qihui’s face.

“Shhh!” Lin Qihui immediately told him to keep his voice down with a gesture. He quickly scanned the surroundings and said, “I...I barely escaped from a Granite Beast. Don’t you set me up!”

“Oh, where are the others?” Mo Fan asked.

Lin Qihui briefly explained what happened to the group after they returned to the city. They were able to help at first by taking out one or two Rock Monsters, but the numbers of the creatures kept increasing rapidly. The students had no choice but to hide and run for their lives.

However, Lin Qihui did not expect the Granite Beasts to have the ability to pick up slight movements from vibrations on the ground, enabling them to hunt down the Mages that were hiding.

“You’re saying that the Granite Beasts are able to locate where the Mages are hiding by sensing the vibrations from the ground?” Mo Fan was surprised.

“Yeah, it’s so terrifying! These creatures are deadlier than we thought. I was lucky enough to sneak into an underground passage, or else I would have been eaten by now too. The others...I’m such a coward, I abandoned them and ran away on my own!” Lin Qihui started to get emotional as he spoke. Tears were running down his cheeks.

“Senior, you shouldn’t blame yourself too hard. You should be relieved that you were able to save yourself in that situation,” Mo Fan consoled him.

If the Granite Beasts had the ability to pick up movements from the ground, the Black-Silver Rock Demon most likely had the same ability. Therefore, his plan to ambush the Black-Silver Rock Demon from behind was definitely not going to work! Luckily, he had stumbled into Lin Qihui. Otherwise, he would waste his time, and might even give the Black-Silver Rock Demon an opening to attack him.

Heavy footsteps were audible as Lin Qihui burst into tears. He quickly covered his mouth, not daring to make a sound, but his eyes were filled with fear!

“It’s coming for me, it’s looking for the fish that has escaped the net!” Lin Qihui blurted out.

“Don’t be scared,” Mo Fan said.

Lin Qihui gathered his courage and said, “Fan Mo, Fan Mo, I’ve already let the others down. You should run, now, it will soon feel your footsteps, but I can still buy some time for you. Just go, and help me take care of the rest of the group...” He realized he had no chance of successfully running away because of the Granite Beasts’ ability.

Mo Fan patted Lin Qihui on the shoulder, seeing his unusual behavior. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lin Qihui was going to ask Mo Fan to leave again when a figure taller than a ten-story building showed up at the entrance of the alley. Lin Qihui could not even see the whole creature at the first glance. He had to lift his head to do so!

“Be...behind... you...” Lin Qihui pointed at the creature with a trembling hand. He was struggling to speak properly.

The Granite Beast grinned. It was scornful of how weak and tiny the humans were.

The Granite Beast reached its hand into the alley. It was going to lift Mo Fan and Lin Qihui up like they were just some tiny mice...

“Behind you, run!” Lin Qihui finally blurted out in fear, but his legs were shaking so much that he could not move at all.

Mo Fan finally withdrew his hand and said, “I know, it should be the one running.”

The creature’s hand was within inches.

Mo Fan suddenly turned around. His right hand, which had been patting Lin Qihui on the shoulder, suddenly burst into flames, unleashing a strong wave of heat for a few hundred meters as he threw a punch.

He merely turned around and threw a punch, and a ferocious dragon appeared in the dark alley. Its bones were made of high-temperature lava, with tongues of fire erupting from its skin. The huge creature seemed tiny compared to the fiery dragon!

The Granite Beast’s arm was burned into ashes, and its huge and sturdy body was knocked to the ground by the wave of flames. Its body cracked rapidly, and eventually broke into pieces.

Lin Qihui stood still. He was already on the edge, worried a Granite Beast would show up at any second, but the creature traumatizing him was already gone, leaving just his junior, whose fist had left scorched trails in the shape of a fan across the street!

It...it was a Granite Beast, ten times stronger than a Rock General!

Yet... it had died to a single Fiery Fist?
