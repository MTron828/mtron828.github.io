Chapter 2031: The Desolate Ice Field

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Psychic Mages, Healers, and Blessers could only improve their cultivation through situations that forced them to exceed their limits, so their progress was slower. Nanyu and Jiang Shaoxu were great examples. They were not slackers; their Primary Element was the main reason why they still had not achieved the Super Level!

Nanyu’s Sound Element was most useful for observing enemies, assisting her allies, and controlling situations. Her situation was similar to those whose Primary Element was the Psychic, Healing, or Blessing Element.

Those Elements required great patience, so Zhao Manyan knew he could not handle them, even though these Elements were very useful and would be a lot of help to a team!

That being said, most teams could not hope to find a high-level Mage with the Sound, Psychic, Healing, or Blessing Elements. Even an Intermediate Healer or Blesser could give a Super Mage great help!

The cold wind they had endured previously was like a spring breeze compared to the one now. The wind was as sharp as a cold saber, continuously draining their lives away. They could no longer feel their own bodies. As they walked, their vision would suddenly darken, like they had fallen into an abyss. Their body would temporarily be free of pain until someone shook them vigorously and transmitted some energy into their bodies to wake them up. They would then realize they were at the brink of death!

If no one was around to keep them awake, they would simply fall asleep after being overwhelmed by fatigue, and would never wake up again.

The Super Mages took turns expending their energy and maintained the barrier that was keeping the others safe. However, the frost continued to penetrate their bodies.

Everyone was dazzled by the Scar of Tianshan Mountain’s beauty when they first arrived. However, they now realized it was as white as a devil’s fang. They were tired of seeing the same whiteness. Their hearts were filled with hatred for it now!

“The Desolate Ice Field is just ahead. The ice there has been around for tens of thousand years. Even Super Spells will struggle to break it,” Yassen informed every, pointing at the cracks that were hard to notice in the ice field, “Be careful of where you step, especially those cracks that are hard to see.”

“We aren’t blind. Are you saying that we might fall into them?” Zhao Kang challenged him.

“Is that right? You can try it yourself,” Yassen replied calmly.

Zhao Kang felt Yassen was being overly cautious. He started walking toward a crack that was over thirty meters wide about a hundred meters away.

The Desolate Ice Field was full of cracks that resembled claw marks. It felt like devils had left their markings across the place. These cracks were only visible when the people were within three hundred meters from them because the ground and the glaciers were reflecting the sunlight like a mirror. They had to look closely to see the cracks!

Zhao Kang did not treat the warning seriously because he believed he could easily tell where the cracks were.

“I can easily jump across them...” Zhao Kang jumped into the air to cross the rift in the ice.

However, something strange happened. Zhao Kang suddenly stopped in the air as if something was grabbing him. His clothes and hair were being pulled down!

“Wind suction!” Zhao Kang realized abruptly. He immediately cast a Wind Spell to break free from the air pressure that was pulling him into the split below him.

Zhao Kang had released his Wind Wings. The Star Constellation of his Wind Element was established rapidly. However, the connection shattered as the last Star Pattern was being added to the structure.

The Wind Wings disappeared at the last second. Zhao Kang was dragged into the crack by a powerful force.

“Damn it!” Zhao Kang cursed, casting the same spell again.

It had the same outcome. His Star Constellation broke in the process as a stronger force pulled Zhao Kang deeper into the split.

He was currently eight meters inside the rift now. The frost inside it wrapped around him like some kind of white silk.

The silk gradually hardened and attached to Zhao Kang’s body like an icy armor.

Zhao Kang was terrified when he could no longer move his body. To make things worse, he was unable to use his magic. Every Star Constellation he tried to construct would shatter before the strange wind that was pulling him down!

Zhao Kang finally realized the rifts were not as simple as they seemed, and screamed at the top of his lungs, “Help, help me!”

The rift looked bright and simple when he was on the surface, but it felt like an endless abyss after he fell into it. He could only see a narrow crack above him. Not only was he wrapped in the deadly frost, his heart was filled with despair now!

A dark vine fell into the crack and wrapped around Zhao Kang’s body. The vine tightened and dragged him out of the crack.

The wind was unwilling to let Zhao Kang go, even when an external force was pulling him up. It almost broke the vine helping him as Zhao Kang was lifted higher. Kuma had no choice but to use a few more vines to drag him out of the crack.

Zhao Kang was already covered in a layer of solid ice when he exited the rift. Klope had to use his Fire Element to melt it. Only then was Zhao Kang safe!

“It was so frightening!” Zhao Kang had a pale face. He kept staring at the split in the ice nervously after managing to focus. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“These cracks in the ice have the Desolate Wind of Death and the Icy Silk of Death. The Desolate Wind of Death will pull in everything close to it and convert the energy their target is releasing into a stronger pulling force. Once the target is in the rift, the Icy Silk of Death will wrap around them like a mummy. When the layer of ice takes form, even the strongest Mage will be stuck forever in the rift and become a part of the ice that has been around for tens of thousand years!” Yassen declared solemnly.
