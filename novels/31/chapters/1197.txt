After getting rid of the resistance, Mo Fan slowly walked toward Yu Ang. His eyes looked like they were going to spit fire at any second, yet they were scarily calm too.

Yu Ang was still bound in handcuffs. His confidence and sneering expression had long disappeared.

They’d had a Leader of the Enforcement Union, a Super Mage, and around twenty Enforcers on their side. Yu Ang believed he could provoke Mo Fan and make him mad enough to use violence here at Beiyu Mountain, giving him an excuse to end Mo Fan’s life. Lu Zhantian would then take the matter into his own hands.

Their plan might not be perfect, yet it would have guaranteed Mo Fan’s death, and that alone was enough!

To their surprise, Mo Fan had brought a vampire who was strong enough to beat the crap out of a Super Mage easily, nor did they know Mo Fan’s own strength would be so terrifying. The Advanced Mage Enforcers did not stand a chance at all!

“Mo Fan... I’m considered to be working for the Enforcement Union... I can promise you that your father is perfectly fine, Lu Zhantian was just trying to scare you, but if you kill me, the Enforcement Union won’t forgive you easily...” Yu Ang immediately begged for his life when he sensed the strong murderous intent coming from Mo Fan.

Who else would Mo Fan not dare to kill, if he was bold enough to kill Lu Bingfeng?

“Yu Ang, you have to know that you are second only to Salan on my to-kill list, so don’t you try and convince me with those petty words! Just prepare to face death!” Mo Fan took another step forward.

When a person only had a single thought in their mind, their focus would be far stronger than normal. Mo Fan’s will had completely surrounded Yu Ang. He let out a furious roar with bloodshot eyes.

“Die!” Mo Fan’s voice was deafening. His strong murderous will penetrated Yu Ang’s body wildly.

It was like countless blades that could easily dismember an enemy, or a vengeful hammer, or a wild storm! Mo Fan’s will disintegrated Yu Ang as soon as he let out the roar!

Yu Ang’s body exploded, including his head. The second before it exploded, Yu Ang’s face was filled with terror. He had lingered on with his last breath until today. He wanted to live more than anyone else, but he ended up presenting himself to the demon. He very much regretted his decisions, but it no longer made any difference!

His eyeballs, hands, bones, and organs scattered across the place. Thick blood splattered in the air and slowly fell, some landing on Mo Fan.

After smelling Yu Ang’s filthy blood after ripping him to pieces, Mo Fan was finally able to vent the hatred that he had hidden deep inside his heart. At least he could finally stop recalling how Xu Zhaoting begged to be burned to ashes!

How the bastard died showed all of Mo Fan’s hatred toward him!

“Who was the Councilman that allowed Yu Ang to join the Enforcement Union?” Mo Fan looked at Feng Jinglan, who did not take part in the battle, nor make a single noise.

If a sinful person like Yu Ang was allowed to live, it was simply an utter humiliation to Xu Zhaoting, who had risked all he had just to get the names of the Blue Deacons. If even an unforgivable person like him was not punished for his sins, Mo Fan would rather stand on the opposite side of the Enforcement Union!

“Master, I have broken every single bone in his body, including those in his fingers. I have also drawn his tendons out. I have cast a spell on him just so he would not faint, so he can clearly sense the pain coming from every inch of his body!” Bola landed on the ground and dropped Lu Zhantian right before Mo Fan’s feet.

Lu Zhantian’s face had contorted, mostly because of pain, but also because of his anger at Mo Fan!

He was a Leader of the Enforcement Union, the person-in-charge of the Beiyu Enforcement Union! Even a Councilman was not allowed to do such a thing to him!

His bones had all been broken. His sinews were all drawn out. He would never forget the pain he had felt, and he swore that he would make Mo Fan suffer ten times, or even a hundred times what he went through!

“Mo Fan, spare his life, I went to check on your father. He’s fine; he isn’t injured, he’s just a little shocked...” Nighthawk informed him.

“Bring me to him,” Mo Fan said.

“Can...can you ask your friend to let Lu Zhantian go? He’s going to die at this rate,” Nighthawk said.

Mo Fan did not answer Nighthawk. Bola smiled and carried Lu Zhantian away with him. He had no intention to give the man to anyone.

Bola would not let the man go without Mo Fan’s permission. As for what was going to happen to him, it basically depended on Mo Jiaxin’s condition. Lu Zhantian better hoped he had not done anything to Mo Jiaxin. Otherwise, he would surely infuriate Mo Fan again!

As a matter of fact, even Bola was quite intimidated by Mo Fan when he was angry. The man even tore Hayla, the Greek’s God of Death, to pieces! Why did these imbeciles challenge the demon sleeping inside Mo Fan? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Oh, perhaps these fools still had no idea that the young man was responsible for the chaos at the Parthenon Temple!

—

Mo Fan went into the headquarters of the Enforcement Union. He saw Nighthawk’s man helping Mo Jiaxin come out as soon as he went into the main hall.

Mo Jiaxin looked a lot healthier than he used to be, but he was very haggard. His lips were dry, and he had heavy eyebags.

His eyes were wide, and he looked confused and a little panicked. He was just an ordinary man who had not learned any magic. Even though he was not injured physically, Mo Fan believed Lu Zhantian had tortured him mentally!

Mo Jiaxin finally calmed down a little when he saw Mo Fan.

He quickly went up to Mo Fan and said, “They told me you are in big trouble, that you have killed someone. It’s great to see that you’re fine.”

The anger in Mo Fan’s heart immediately dissipated as soon as he heard those words. He smiled wryly.

“Dad, you should be worried about yourself instead. I’m fine, but someone has got to pay the price!” Mo Fan said. He had no intention of letting things go so easily!

“Mo Fan, I’m fine too. That Yu Ang just came and scared me a few times. They didn’t do any harm to me. Let’s forget it, let’s not make the matters worse,” Mo Jiaxin did not want Mo Fan to do anything extreme. Nighthawk had already told him how serious the situation was. Mo Fan had already killed an Enforcer and reduced a Leader of the Enforcement Union into a cripple.

He had dealt with those responsible for abducting his old man. There was no need to escalate the situation further!

“Dad, to be honest, I have done many things for the army, the Magic Association, the government, and the country. I have risked my life many times, and I have never asked for anything from them. I just wanted them to take care of you when I was away, so the Black Vatican and my enemies won’t do any harm to you...but they can’t even keep their word! The military, the Lu Clan, the Enforcement Union; I won’t forgive every person that’s related to this!” Killing a few people was far from enough for Mo Fan to vent his anger.

“Mo Fan...” Mo Jiaxin sighed. Those who deserved to die were already dead. Mo Jiaxin really did not want Mo Fan to go any further.

However, judging from Mo Fan’s attitude, he knew he could not change his son’s mind.

“Dad, there are things that we shouldn’t endure. The more we endure, the greater the disappointment. If they could already do such a thing to me, what about those people that have devoted their whole lives to taking down the Black Vatican because they lost their loved ones?” Mo Fan said to Mo Jiaxin.

Mo Fan was well aware of Mo Jiaxin’s personality. Mo Fan did not mind enduring a little, but he could not stand it any longer when he learned that the people of the Enforcement Union could take his father from the military using such a lousy excuse and lock him up in a place without him knowing. They even allowed a member of the Black Vatican to get close to his father, who was just an ordinary man!

—

Mo Fan left the Beiyu Enforcement Union with Mo Jiaxin and brought him back to the Clearsky Hunter Agency. The Clearsky Hunter Agency was well fortified. It was the only place that Mo Fan felt was safe for now...

“Is Uncle Mo alright?” Lingling asked.

“He’s fine, but...” Mo Fan looked at Lingling and said, “Where is the Lu Clan located?”

“Head west, there’s a place called Manye Town. Half of the people there are from the Lu Clan. Their mansion is there, too,” Lingling said.

“Bola, bring that prick along. It’s time we pay Manye Town a visit,” Mo Fan stated.

—

Mo Fan Summoned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. He was not in a rush this time. He passed through the bustling streets of the Magic City and headed toward the town that was mostly occupied by the renowned clans.

“The news has already spread, are you sure you want to do this?” Lingling said worriedly, sitting behind him.

“I’m going to be fine with Bola around. Besides, if anything really happens, the Black Totem Snake will show up as soon as possible, too. Don’t worry; I promise you, I won’t use the Demon Element,” Mo Fan said.

“Mm,” Lingling nodded. There was nothing else that she had to worry about after Mo Fan gave his promise.

Mo Fan was taking his time because he was waiting for those that were supposed to be there to arrive, as they knew he was on his way to demand an explanation!

It was unlikely that the Lu Clan had not realized what was going on, since he had already killed one of their people. He did not care what kind of feast they were organizing for him. Bola could easily guarantee his safety, and even if things went south, Mo Fan would not mind Summoning the Black Totem Snake over to repeat the incident at the Parthenon Temple.

The Parthenon Temple might be able to take the Black Totem Snake on, but the Lu Clan? The Black Totem Snake could easily wipe their clan out!
