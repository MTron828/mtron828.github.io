Linging’s fingers typed quickly on her laptop and brought up several blurred images.

“I was wondering why their deaths felt so familiar! Check this out, this is the incident about someone being poisoned that the manor is trying to hide. Don’t you remember? The City Hunters even came to investigate it, but that perverted captain was easily taken care of by Carly!” said Lingling with excitement.

“What does this have anything to do with the tea?” said Mo Fan in confusion.

“I’m starting to put the pieces together. Just give me some time, and I should be able to find out more about the poison, and come up with an antidote to temporarily suppress it,” Lingling rose to her feet and headed for her room with her laptop.

“Where are you going?” asked Mo Fan worriedly.

“I stored information related to all kinds of poison on the cloud. The signal is totally blocked off by the Black Vatican. I’ll need to build a tool to bypass the signal to retrieve the information I need. This might take some time,” said Lingling.

“It’s unsafe for you to be alone,” said Mu Ningxue.

“The Black Vatican is mainly focusing on the Golden Battle Hunters. They won’t have time to care about us, as long as we don’t expose ourselves. Even if they found out there are Hunters among the guests, they won’t be suspicious of a first-schooler. You two better start moving and find the members of the Black Vatican. Otherwise, even if we managed to deal with the poison, they will still escape in the end!” said Lingling.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue nodded.

They decided to let Lingling handle the poison, since they could not provide her with any assistance. The Black Vatican was indeed impressive when it came to using all kinds of strange methods to achieve their goals. Luckily, they had brought the genius Lingling along. Otherwise, they would have no choice but to wait for rescue.

After Lingling left, Mo Fan nudged Mu Ningxue on her elbow and said, “You’re pretty observant. I almost forgot about the tea.”

“It only crossed my mind for a second. I never thought it would actually be the case. Now when I recall it, it did seem like everyone here at the ranches was received by the manor, and everyone was served with the special black tea. Carly and the butler would watch them drink the tea, and even those that did not drink it during the day, a maid would bring the tea over at night and explain that it could possibly help with sleep, or even serve the tea during breakfast. In simpler terms, you can find their special black tea everywhere...” said Mu Ningxue.

Now that Mu Ningxue had mentioned it, Mo Fan somehow recalled that the manor did not really provide them with drinking water, but their special tea...

“There must be people that didn’t drink the tea, but only a few, I assume. Almost everyone, including me, you, and Lingling, were poisoned by the tea. The poison stays inside the body, and will only relapse under certain conditions. The victim will then vomit black blood and turn into the black stuff... damn it, I believe I drank almost a whole bucket of the tea during our stay here!” exclaimed Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue was too embarrassed to even mention it. When Mo Fan was told that the tea was their specialty and was provided for free, he had been drinking the tea like a bull. If the poison worked according to the amount consumed, Mo Fan would be among the first ten people to die of the poison.

Luckily, the few hundred corpses outside the manor had implied that drinking more of the tea did not necessarily make the poison stronger.

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue did not share their discovery with the others, since they had yet to find the solution. It would only invoke fear among them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The poison was on standby in everyone’s body. They were still unsure of how to control the poison. Standing out too much would only make them easy targets.

“Mo Fan, I beg you...” Guo Wenyi suddenly appeared beside Mo Fan.

Mo Fan looked at the tearful Guo Wenyi. It was obvious that Guo Wenyi thought Wang Xuxu was in great trouble.

“Please help me find her, Xuxu is my best friend. If I didn’t recommend she come, she wouldn’t even be here, since she was preparing for exams. If anything happened to her...” Guo Wenyi was totally blaming herself.

“I don’t know where she is either, this place is so big!” rejected Mo Fan.

Mo Fan simply had no time to waste on searching for a missing person. The Black Vatican was still waiting to strike behind the scenes. If they could not find a cure to the poison, everyone would die eventually, including Mu Ningxue and Lingling!

Mo Fan could understand Guo Wenyi’s feelings, since the two girls would not be in this mess if he actually decided not to take the job. He had to remain calm, yet he was running out of time. Even now, he had yet to find any trace of the Black Vatican!

“The others are not willing to help us look for her...it’s only me and Rong Sheng...” Guo Wenyi continued to plead. It seemed like since Guo Wenyi managed to overcome her fear, she had been overly reliant on Mo Fan.

“Come, let’s go look for Wang Xuxu,” Mu Ningxue rose to her feet. Mo Fan was fairly surprised. “We won’t find any clues if we keep sitting here,” Mu Ningxue told him.

Mo Fan agreed. Instead of staying here like sitting ducks, it was better for them to search around the place, and see if they could also find the missing Wang Xuxu. Saving an extra life was always better.

“Thank you, thank you so much!” Guo Wenyi was incredibly touched.

Rong Sheng’s eyes were filled with gratitude, too.

Their classmates were too scared to leave the hall. They did not dare to take even a step out of the building. None of them seemed to care about Wang Xuxu’s well-being, yet to their surprise, these two people who they only met less than a week ago were willing to risk their lives for them!

“A piece of advice, it’s better if you don’t go anywhere. If the poison is still spreading out there... you won’t be able to come back here.”

“Yeah, you heard what the Golden Battle Hunters said. We should just stay indoors and wait for help. Going out there is only going to make things worse,” advised Wang Bing.

The four ignored their advice and opened the door to start looking for the missing Wang Xuxu.

Since Mo Fan had agreed to help, he would surely do his best. After all, Mo Fan was officially a Hunter Master. He had done lots of similar jobs, looking for missing people. As long as he was paid good money, he did not mind working as a private detective. A Hunter was pretty much an enhanced version of a private detective.

“When did you last see her?” asked Mo Fan seriously.

“In her room, after dinner, she said she was feeling uncomfortable, so she was staying in her room. I did go and knock on her door, but she didn’t respond. I thought she went somewhere else with Zhao Pinlin... oh, Rong Sheng, I didn’t mean to say that,” said Guo Wenyi.

“That asshole Zhao Pinlin, how dare he not look after Wang Xuxu!” Rong Sheng was still enraged.

“Let’s check her room out first. Maybe we can find some clues there. By the way, why did you think that she had left with Zhao Pinlin?”

“It’s because I went to look for Zhao Pinlin, too. He wasn’t in his room, either. Since they had already declared their relationship, I assumed they would be together if both of them weren’t in their rooms!” admitted Guo Wenyi.
