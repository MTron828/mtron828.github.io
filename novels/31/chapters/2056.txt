“I’m not familiar with this place. Do you have any idea?” Mo Fan asked calmly.

“I have some old friends in the Sacred City. They might be able to help, but master, I don’t recommend you meeting them,” Bola said.

“Bola, you’re being dishonest. Did you go hunting for women while you were a statue in the Parthenon Temple?” Mo Fan smiled.

Bola had been a statue in the Parthenon Temple for so long. How could he possibly have any old friends?

“My master, even the youngest among my friends have lived for more than three hundred years,” Bola said.

“Ugh... were you all born in the year of the tortoise?” Mo Fan was left speechless.

“Some of them are mutants, like the little moth girl. They share the same habits as humans. They have to hide in places supervised by the Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgment Court to guarantee their safety,” Bola said.

“The most dangerous place is the safest place, right?” Mo Fan had to say.

“Not necessarily. They are threatened by different factions, organizations, people, and demon creatures in the wild, but in the Sacred City, they just need to play hide-and-seek with the Holy Court Mages. Those who manage to survive here are capable of concealing their presence, or they have some old agreements with the Holy Judgment Court,” Bola explained.

“Old agreements? Must be some dirty business!” Mo Fan snarled when he recalled the Queen of the Netherworld’s words.

Bola’s expression shifted. He coughed awkwardly and spoke with a soft voice, “My master, I am one of them. Even if my identity is exposed and I am brought to the Sacred City, they won’t put me on trial unless they have forgotten their ancestors’ commandments.”

Bola proceeded to explain when he saw Mo Fan staring at him with a confused face, “You already know I’m an honest member of the Blood Tribe. I was a guardian statue of the Parthenon Temple when you saw me. However, I used to be a City Designer before that.”

“What’s a City Designer?” Mo Fan asked.

“Just like a building has its architect, a city has its designer too,” Bola pointed out.

“Damn, you designed the Sacred City?” Mo Fan blurted out, eyes wide.

“That’s a little exaggerated. My master did, I was only part of it, and it was the old Sacred City. The Sacred City has been around for a few hundred years. It has changed a lot,” Bola replied.

“No wonder you insisted on coming along when you heard I was visiting the Sacred City,” Mo Fan realized.

“My master, I would like to lend you a hand. After all, the Sacred City is a dangerous place. Even the slightest offense is unforgivable. I made a mistake by joining the Blood Tribe. They would have purged me if my name wasn’t on the monument written with the names of those who first built the city,” Bola said.

“We’ll talk about your past later. What else do you know about Euryale?” Mo Fan asked.

“She moved into the city not long after it was built. I heard a lot about her from my friends. She’s different from the mutants who are content with having a safe environment to live in, acting extremely bold. She has been kidnapping foreign tourists for hundreds of years. Rumors say she’s doing it to retain her good looks,” Bola said.

“A few hundred years... doesn’t that mean she has killed thousands of people?” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“A few hundred at most. No matter how bold she is, she will only kidnap one every year in the Sacred City if she doesn’t want to arouse suspicion,” Bola replied.

“One victim every year, that’s a lot better than most human traffickers,” Mo Fan had to admit.

“The Heresy Judgment Court has already noticed Euryale’s crimes, but they haven’t confirmed she was the culprit. She’s being too reckless,” Bola went on.

“Do you have a way to deal with her?” Mo Fan asked.

Bola might not be as strong as Euryale, but he had been around for a long time. His intelligence and connections were unmatched, links he built over a thousand years.

Mo Fan did have a feeling Bola was familiar with the Sacred City. After all, there were only a few formidable European countries in the early days, and most of them were located close to the Mediterranean Sea. The Sacred City was the symbol of magic civilization in Europe. How could Bola not be familiar with it? However, Mo Fan did not expect Bola to be one of the designers!

“You might need Euryale’s help if you are planning to sneak into the Sacred Residence,” Bola said.

“Why is that?” Mo Fan was confused.

Mo Fan only came to find out the reason why Apas was so overwhelmed by grief and anger. It turned out that her sister was the reason.

“Euryale is called the Deceiving Demoness. She possesses the lineage of the Eagle Demoness on top of her lineage of the Medusae.”

“Isn’t Euryale a pure Medusa?” Mo Fan asked curiously.

“Euryale is a descendant of the Medusa Queen and the Eagle Demoness Queen,” Bola said.

“Hang on, the Medusa Queen and the Eagle Demoness Queen? Aren’t they both females?” Mo Fan was struggling to keep up.

“My master, many corrupted species in Europe do not need males to reproduce. Cessna, Apas’ eldest sister, isn’t a pure Medusa, either. Cessna is a descendant of the Medusa Queen and the Scorpion Queen. The snakes and the scorpions are the strongest species in Egypt, thus Cessna is most likely the next ruler of the demon creatures in Egypt,” Bola said.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

A question suddenly crossed Mo Fan’s mind. “What about Apas?”

“It’s pretty obvious. Apas is an offspring between the Medusa Queen and a human,” Bola said.

“Ugh... so the human was a woman?” Mo Fan asked, thoughts going in certain unspoken directions.

“That’s right, Apas has two mothers. One is the Medusa Queen, and the other is from the Island of Flowers in the Mediterranean Sea... oh, you should know that by now,” Bola did not speak any further.

The Medusa Queen’s affairs were not a secret among the old demon creatures.

“That makes a lot of sense,” Mo Fan nodded.

It seemed like he had found the source of Apas’ anger and sorrow. It explained why Apas had such a strong intention to kill. It was very likely that Euryale had done something horrible to Apas’ human mother!

“Euryale is the descendant of the Medusa Queen and the Eagle Demoness Queen. She has the strongest ability to deceive in the world. She can transform into anyone, with the same appearance, voice, and presence,” Bola said.

“That’s insane!” Mo Fan said.

“Yes, and it’s not a kind of illusion. Even the Eye of the Golden Dragon can’t see through it. Therefore, if you can acquire Euryale’s Eye of Deception, you can disguise yourself as a Holy Court Mage or a Judicator and sneak into the Sacred Residence!”
