“Bow!”

Mu Ningxue did not wait any further. Death was already knocking on the door. If she allowed the creatures to strike first, they would be hanging in the air like some spoils of war before they could react!

The sharp frost of her Nirvana Ice Domain spread wildly in the deep abyss of the dragon pond. Snowflakes fell like plum blossoms from the air as the Ice Magic began to accumulate!

“So...so cold!” Tony rubbed his hands against his arms. The other three immediately felt uncomfortable due to the cold.

The Nirvana Ice Domain that Mu Ningxue had unleashed this time was a lot stronger than usual. Every time the Ice Crystal Bow was Summoned, it felt like it was going to cover the whole place in white snow, and not allow even the slightest difference in color!

The Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon hanging on the weaving silk immediately realized something did not seem right. Its little head sprang open, revealing several mouths, each with sharp fangs like the teeth of a saw. It was quite an eerie sight!

The Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon did not have eyes, but they could feel the creature staring at them with murderous greed. The creature suddenly scuttled in Mu Ningxue’s direction!

Its speed was absolutely insane. It was moving freely in the air despite the lack of a solid path. It would move like a spider on a web, dash like a scorpion, or slither like a snake at times...

It did not attack Mu Ningxue boldly, as it seemed to be afraid of her. It kept changing its position above the group.

Mo Fan saw a faint shadow flickering past rapidly. The creature was so quick that he could not even see its movements clearly. It was incredibly dangerous if they could not predict the creature’s whereabouts!

“It’s moving too fast, what should we do? We’re all going to die!” Tony screamed.

The deadly creature kept pacing back and forth above the group. Everyone could tell that the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was clearly a lot stronger than them. A single Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon could butcher them like livestock, not to mention that there was another one standing by on the wall!

“We must strike preemptively!” Mo Fan said to Mu Ningxue when he started to have a bad feeling.

The frost danced in the air as her sleeves rustled. Mu Ningxue fiercely extended her arms, now slightly floating in the air!

The crystalline dust gathered in front of Mu Ningxue and outlined the Ice Crystal Bow. A long crystalline arrow appeared between Mu Ningxue’s fingers!

The Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon finally realized that this group of humans was no harmless prey like those they had murdered as they pleased. Its movements were as unpredictable as a phantom as it lunged at Mu Ningxue from a tricky angle. Its front claws were aiming for Mu Ningxue’s throat!

“Pulverizing Arrow!”

Mu Ningxue’s aura reached its limit. Everything froze at that instant, apart from an icy, deadly arrow that tore through the frozen time and swept forth with an astonishing, pulverizing storm...

The Pulverizing Arrow flew right at the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon, and the strong tide of poison preceding it!

The poison tide formed a great contrast with Mu Ningxue’s sacred storm of frost, each filling up half of the dragon pond. The whole place shook vigorously when the two crashed into one another!

The arrow struck the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon in mid-air. It was like the commanders of two armies charging at one another, but the arrow managed to land a hit on the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon!

The Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon’s body was almost instantly covered in ice, turning it into a smooth, ice statue! In less than half a second, the ice statue broke into pieces and shattered in the air, becoming crystalline powder!

The poison tide was devoured by the raging storm. The Pulverizing Arrow broke into dust, taking the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon with it, as it too turned into tiny, white particles...

Tony’s eyes widened, dropping his jaw as if it had somehow dislocated!

Even though the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was not as strong as a Ruler-level creature, it was definitely one of the strongest Commander-level creatures he knew, yet Mu Ningxue had killed it with a single arrow. Tony suddenly felt that the Goddess of Ice was even more terrifying than the creature!

“Is...is it dead?” Ayleen was struggling to believe it too. The magic equipment that Mu Ningxue had brought out was unbelievably powerful; it had killed the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon that they did not think they could stand a chance against!

“It’s dead, but...” Mu Ningxue’s breathing intensified. She turned to the other Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon that was still on the wall.

The two Heart-Devouring Hellish Demons had lived in the poisonous swamp for a long time, and had killed countless creatures. Mu Ningxue had locked her arrow onto the female Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon that was stronger of the two, and killed it with a single blow!

If she did not attack decisively, they would be the ones that died instead!

The male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon uttered thunderous cries. It was only standing by on the wall, planning to watch how its mate was going to torture the humans to death, but its mate had simply died all of a sudden.

It cried out madly; the four felt like the sharp screech was going to pierce through their brains!

“Let’s go,” Mu Ningxue said with a pale face.

“Why don’t you just fire another arrow at it?” Tony said.

Mo Fan stared at the man, who immediately shut his mouth.

The four immediately took their leave. They were unsure if the death of the female Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was enough to break the spell that kept bringing them back to the same place. However, they knew it was too dangerous to stay behind.

The male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon kept screeching, but it did not launch an attack, either. Clearly, the creature had a certain level of intelligence. It had just witnessed how the stronger female Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon had died in an instant, so it was worried it would share the same fate...

However, the intelligence of the remaining Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon had actually bought the four some time. It was not like Mu Ningxue was reluctant to fire another arrow at the male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon, but her energy was already depleted after firing the first one.

She was weak, very weak! Her cultivation was still not strong enough to fully master the Ice Crystal Bow, resulting in a great burden to her.

However, Mu Ningxue did not faint straight away. She was trying her best to stay conscious. If the male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon realized that she had lost all her energy, it would surely be a great disaster when the creature proceeded to avenge his partner!

Mo Fan did not dare to support Mu Ningxue, even though he could tell that she was desperately trying to hold herself together.

“Let’s go, we can only hope that the creature is afraid to die!” Mo Fan said grimly.

Even though the female Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was dead, they still had no chance of taking on the male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon. They had to leave the place while the creature was still too afraid to attack them!

It turned out that the female Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was responsible for the illusion that kept bringing them back to the Seven Serpents Dragon Pond, as they no longer ended up back in the same place.

Ayleen kept casting Brilliant Light to show the path. Their surroundings started to look familiar to them.

They had managed to escape the illusion. They only needed to make their way to the entrance where the layer of poison miasma was the thickest, and they would soon leave this horrible place.

“Is that creature... still following us?” Tony looked behind worriedly.

The area lit up by the Brilliant Light was fairly limited. The place behind them was covered in pitch-black darkness. However, Tony was still able to catch a glimpse of some legs crawling along the wall, a long tail like a snake’s, and the eerie fangs sticking out of the numerous mouths on the creature’s head.

The creature clearly had no eyes, yet Tony felt like it was able to see through him with its vicious gaze. Tony shuddered, he could even hear his heart pounding.

“That...that creature is still following us!” Tony cried out.

“The creature will attack the moment Mu Ningxue reaches her limit...” Mo Fan said.

The male Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was smart; it had only followed the group because it was suspicious of Mu Ningxue’s condition. They were still within its territory. It had great patience, like a wild wolf that was not good at overwhelming its enemy through brawling, but its unwillingness to give up and its patience. It would continue to apply pressure to its prey until it was finally worn out both mentally and physically. Its prey would simply give up, allowing the wolf to feast as it pleased!

“Aren’t we there yet?” Ayleen said in a panic.

The weaker Mu Ningxue was, the heavier everyone’s heart was pounding. They could feel that the Heart-Devouring Hellish Demon was very tempted to make its move.

“We’re almost there, it’s just after the junction with ten paths,” Tony said.

“I...I...” Mu Ningxue was finally at her limit. She closed her eyes as she was overwhelmed by fatigue. Her body immediately fell feebly.

Mo Fan quickly caught her in his arms. The moment he felt the exhilarating sensation of holding the beautiful woman, he also felt a strong murderous aura charging at them like an army of soldiers on horses!

“Ayleen, take care of her!” Mo Fan placed Mu Ningxue against a boulder nearby and asked Ayleen to stay close to her.

“Fatty, if there’s anything useful, just use it now. Don’t you dare preserve your strength when we’re all going to die here!” Mo Fan yelled at Tony.

“I...I...I can set up a barrier, but I’ll need some time. It should be able to hold the creature off for some time!” Tony said in a trembling voice.

“Be quick, I’ll hold it off first!” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan did not dare waste his time further. He summoned Teenage Flame Belle to merge with his soul.

The Calamity Fire erupted and lit up their dark and sinister surroundings. The blazing flame formed a giant sword that Mo Fan was holding tightly in his hand...

“Lightning Tyrant!”

Fire alone was nowhere enough. Mo Fan proceeded to unleash his Lightning Tyrant Domain while he was possessed by Little Flame Belle. He was wearing lightning as his armor, with fire engulfing him and spreading more than a hundred meters away from him!

As Mo Fan unleashed two of his strongest magicks, he finally felt a little confident of taking on the vicious creature!
