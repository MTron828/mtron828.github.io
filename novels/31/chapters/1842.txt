The Manta Ray Evil Birds were circling the building with the rhombus-shaped roof, like a plague of locusts. Most of them had come out from the water around the island. They had regrouped on the island after someone had invaded their territory. Not a single drop of water would trickle past them.

Zhu Qi was obviously very familiar with the island. He knew which building to hide in at the emergency outpost that morning to keep the Manta Ray Evil Birds away. He had gathered everyone together in the building.

“Chief, there’s actually a simpler way. We’ll just use these girls as bait. We’re not going to endanger their lives. We’ll just make them suffer a little, like losing a limb or a leg. I bet the other two will show themselves,” Li Dong suggested softly.

“Go ahead and kill us if you’re so capable, or else it’s going to mess up your career,” Tangyue harrumphed coldly. She was clearly not afraid of Chief Zhu Qi.

“Kill you? I’m not a vicious criminal. I just want to do us good. Don’t you forget, I have suffered the greatest loss here. Who’s going to pay for my son’s death? Tangyue, I’m not going to waste my time with you. Call your two friends back, and I will swear on my soul that I’ll bring you all back to safety. However, if you insist on telling everyone about it, I won’t be showing any mercy. We’ll both go down together!” Chief Zhu Qi promised.

“Miss Tangyue, I think the chief is being reasonable here. If we can just stay on good terms and avoid any unnecessary casualties, there’s no need to be fussy about it. Let’s each take a step back and settle the conflict between us. As for something like losing a limb, why should we act like savages when we are all civilized people? Let’s sit down and discuss this peacefully,” Zhao Manyan blurted out.

Losing a limb? Zhao Manyan assumed Zhu Qi and his men would not dare to harm Tangyue since she was one of the Enforcement Union too. As for Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling, it was unlikely Zhu Qi’s men would lay their hands on them for ethical reasons. Therefore, they were definitely going to punish him as a warning to Mo Fan and Mu Bai!

Besides, Zhao Manyan knew even if they broke his legs or cut off his arms, Mo Fan and Mu Bai would not bother showing up. How could he not know what kind of people they were!?

“Chief, things aren’t that complicated, either. It was Zhu Min’s fault that the accident happened to him. We shouldn’t worsen the situation because of it. Mr. Nan already told us to settle the dispute peacefully if possible,” a man with a hint of whiteness in his hair spoke up.

The man was only in his thirties. He had been against Zhu Qi’s plan from the very beginning.

They could not afford to harm Tangyue. If the Lingyin Enforcement Union learned Tangyue was in trouble at the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union, those old guys, including Tang Zhong, were going to turn the Nanxi Mountain upside down, regardless of who was responsible for the incident. Besides, there were too many enforcers and senior enforcers here. It was impossible to make sure they would keep their lips sealed. Even the most loyal subordinate might look forward to overthrowing their superior, so they could take over their position.

“We’ll wait here then!” Zhu Qi’s emotions were clearly unstable, mainly because of how horribly his son had died. He was struggling to handle the situation rationally.

His son might have been a little dumb, but to die like that all of a sudden? How could he not lose his mind? Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Right, let’s wait here. Once things are done on Mr. Nan’s side, we’ll be able to sort everything out. It’s only a matter of a few days!” Wu Jiao said.

“My son has died because of this! I hope Mr. Nan’s arrangements can make up for it! Humph!” Zhu Qi spat coldly.

“Don’t worry, you’ve served Mr. Nan for so many years. He definitely has a nice vacant position for you. That’s a juicy piece of meat. As for Zhu Min, you can treat it as a belated punishment, considering what you all did back then...” Wu Jiao replied.

A senior enforcer quickly came up to Zhu Qi before Wu Jiao could finish his sentence. The senior enforcer said, “Chief, someone who claims to be Mo Fan is outside. He says he will truly make you the last of your family line if you don’t let his friends go.”

The anger that Zhu Qi had managed to suppress just a moment ago exploded instantly. He totally tossed the need to remain rational and withhold his anger until Mr. Nan was done with the election to the back of his mind. His thoughts were full of the images of his son’s horrible death!

His son would not have ended up in such a tragedy if these people had not come to stir up trouble in the first place!

Wu Jiao wanted to warn Zhu Qi against this, but he knew nothing was going to change Zhu Qi’s mind when he saw the twisted expression on the man’s face.

Zhao Manyan’s expression was just as grim as Wu Jiao’s expression.

Wasn’t Mo Fan f**king pouring oil on the fire now? They could have settled the conflict peacefully. Zhu Qi was only trying to cover up some of the deeds he had done in the past. They could just pretend they did not see anything and follow Zhu Qi’s instructions. The chief of the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union had no reason to bring them all down with him!

But now, Mo Fan had to bring up the topic, and even promised the man he’d be the last of his family line. It was going to make him the last of the Zhao Family instead!

“Keep an eye on them!” The chief did not lose his mind. He knew there were two people missing. It was obvious the guy outside was trying to lure him away.

“Chief, calm down, our goal is to help Mr. Nan win the election. We’ve been preparing for it for so long. We shouldn’t complicate matters further because of this incident. We just need to make sure these people don’t leave the island for five days,” Wu Jiao blurted out.

“It was not your son who died! Step aside, I’m going to beat the kid half to death and let him beg for mercy at my feet!” Chief Zhu Qi snarled and strode away.

“Guys, please advise your friend to mind his temper. It’s not like we are going to harm you. We will only keep you here for a few days. It’s normal for someone in office to make a few mistakes. I can promise you on behalf of Councilman Nan that he will immediately deal with the island once he’s successful in the election!” Wu Jiao felt like bursting into tears. How did they stumble into people with such hot tempers? What had happened to the young men nowadays? Couldn’t they be a little slicker and more sly?

“Humph! Councilman Nan, it’s really him! He abandoned this island to protect his own reputation and career twenty years ago. Who’s going to guarantee he won’t do anything worse after he’s elected a Great Councilman?” Tangyue harrumphed coldly. She obviously had no intention of backing down.
