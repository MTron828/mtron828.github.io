Jiang Shaoxu’s first instinct was to immediately call for backup.

Ai Jiangtu and the others were obviously not too far away. They could make it in time if they turned around now. The problem was, the villagers were being kept prisoners by the bandits. If the bandits used them as hostages, things would be rather tricky.

Jiang Shaoxu tried using the communication device and was not surprised to discover that it was not working. There seemed to be some sort of device blocking the signal.

“We’ll head down the mountain now and find a place with a signal,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“We won’t make it in time, take a look yourself,” Mo Fan said, pointing at the crowd.

Xi Ge’s men seemed to be running out of patience. They were staring at the young, energetic women among the villagers in excitement.

The women in the villages seemed to be more attractive than those in other villages, perhaps because they were nurtured by the beautiful sweetgrass. The bandits were not just here for the money. If time allowed, they would go from bad to worse and commit shameless acts. The villagers could not possibly hope the bandits could withhold the lust awakened by the chain reaction of the greed deep inside them!

“See, I’m actually trying my best to do business with you. Hand over the money, so my brothers can afford to hire whores. That way, they won’t bother the ladies here. Everything has a cause and effect; if the men in your village aren’t willing to pay the money, I can only take the women with us. Perhaps I can sell them at a good price. You have fifteen minutes to decide, as I can only hold these sons of bitches back for that long. I can’t imagine what they will do in fifteen minutes!” Xi Ge said unhurriedly.

Xi Ge was acting like a king, as if he could make any decision he wanted. He was only giving the villagers time as a veneer of mercy and righteousness.

The villagers clenched their teeth. Since when were bandits so full of themselves?

“Just give them the money,” a villager said with a sigh.

“Yeah, we can’t win against them. Let’s give them our money before they do anything to us,” a woman trembled.

“Madam, even if we were to do anything, I bet my brothers aren’t interested in you considering how ugly and how wrinkled your skin is, so don’t be afraid, hahaha!” Xi Ge burst out laughing.

The Magicians with red ornaments burst into laughter too. They began to share who they were interested in among themselves.

The woman’s face blushed and darkened after being humiliated verbally. It felt like her obese body was about to explode.

“We can’t give them the money. The season is changing soon. If we give them the money, we won’t have enough to hire Magicians to drive the sea monsters away. Even more of us will die by then,” a middle-aged, muscular man immediately spoke up.

Their village had once paid a great price after being raided by sea monsters. Giving the money away was simply placing their village in danger of repeating the same tragedy.

“Asshole, are you implying that we’re more merciful than the sea monsters of the Caribbean Sea!” Xi Ge was enraged as soon as he heard the words!

He grabbed the middle-aged man out from the crowd. A cursed red string appeared between his fingers.

Xi Ge wrapped the cursed string around the man rapidly, drawing the energy of his soul out from his body and feeding it to the sinister blood-red spider above him!

The man was well alive just a minute ago, but now, his body had turned gray like rotten wood. His eyes were hollow, and his mouth was wide open. He had died a horrible death!

Many villagers fainted after seeing Xi Ge killing one of them with the curse. A man had died just because his words sounded unpleasant to the leader of the bandits! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Stop challenging my patience, I can tell you responsibly that if I don’t get a deal today, I’ll turn your village into Hell, much more worse than being attacked by the sea monsters! It’s you that forced the righteous Xi Ge to do so!” Xi Ge yelled furiously.

The villagers no longer dared to disagree with the bandits. The sea monsters would only attack their village during the next season, but the bandits could slaughter them right now!

“Humph, he really got on my nerves there, I’m regretting it now, you must now pay me double the price!” said Xi Ge harrumphed coldly.

“Where...where could we possibly get enough money?!”

“Very simple, I’ll come back for the money again next year. We’ll take your women for now, and hopefully, you’ll fulfill your end next year. Otherwise, you can use their corpses as fertilizers for the sweetgrass. Perhaps it will make the sweetgrass grow better, and you can sell them for a higher price!” said Xi Ge.

“Didn’t...didn’t you say you won’t bother them if we buy our stuff back?” protested the chief.

“I’ve changed my mind!”

“Boss, that’s brilliant!”

“HAHA, to be honest, I really like the women here!” Xi Ge’s men burst out laughing.

“These bandits are so full of themselves in broad daylight. Are the authorities of these countries really that useless? Mo Fan, let’s kill them all!” Jiang Shaoxu was at her limit.

“Miss, can you please calm down[ if we show up now, they are going to hold the villagers as hostages. I have a better plan, but it only works if we are good at acting,” said Mo Fan.

“What plan?”

“We’ll need a name first, the Male and Female Bandits, how does that sound?”

“What the heck?”

—

Xi Ge was grinning cruelly. He would sometimes treat his victims mercifully, as he realized that it was boring if he mentally destroyed them straightaway. He quite enjoyed pressuring his prey with fear gradually, as he enjoyed watching them vowing to die rather than obey him at the start, and then going to their knees begging him to stick to what he had promised in the first place.

Unfortunately, Xi Ge would not be taking back his words today.

These idiots seriously thought the sea monsters were scarier than the Red Ornaments Guild, even when the sea monsters would only appear next season?! He had the responsibility to teach them that the Red Ornaments Guild was actually ten times, or even a hundred times scarier than the sea monsters! Even the government could not do anything about them!

“Hey, you two...” Xi Ge was immersed in pleasant thoughts when he saw two Asians walking out from the shrub.

The two Asians directly walked past the bandits and went up to Xi Ge as if his men were invisible.

Xi Ge’s men were startled. They had no idea where the two young Asians came from.

“Yellow-skinned monkeys, you must be visitors to this country. Consider yourself unlucky to stumble into us Red Ornaments Guild when we are in the middle of a job. That chick beside you isn’t bad; I’ll give you a chance to offer me a satisfying price to redeem her back,” Xi Ge stared at the two Asians that appeared out of nowhere. However, he did not seem too surprised.

“Her? She’s only worth these much in my eyes,” Mo Fan glanced at Jiang Shaoxu before taking out two coins from his pocket and tossing them at Xi Ge.

Xi Ge did not catch them. The coins hit his body and fell to the ground...

His face fell dark, as the two coins were of the lowest value locally!

“You asshole!” Jiang Shaoxu was infuriated. She had the urge to slap Mo Fan in the face.

-Am I seriously worth that little? The two coins aren’t enough to even buy a cucumber in China! How cheap does Mo Fan think I am?!-

“Can you not be so serious about it?” said Mo Fan speechlessly.

“You’re humiliating me.”

“...” Mo Fan was at a loss for words.

Xi Ge’s face grew darker. Were these two mentally retarded? Didn’t they see he had fifty men standing right beside him? Didn’t they know the leader of the Red Ornaments Guild was in the midst of robbing people?

“Tell me, how you are planning to die? I will fulfill your wish!” said Xi Ge coldly.

“To die of old age in my bedroom on a bed of money...” replied Mo Fan.

Xi Ge’s joints started to crack loudly. Where did this yellow-skinned monkey come from? He swore he would skin the man alive and use his skin to make himself a pair of leather shoes!

“I’ve changed my mind,” Xi Ge followed the same pattern. He talked slowly even when he was filled with rage.

“Enough with your boring mental torture bullshit, I set my eyes on this village earlier than your Red Ornaments Guild, so their money is supposed to be in my pocket. Besides, I’m going to give you a chance, each of your men is worth four hundred thousand, so if you pay me...if you pay...”

“Twenty-eight million,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“Right, let’s round it up and make it thirty million. If you pay me thirty million, I’ll let you leave,” said Mo Fan.

Xi Ge and his men were stunned for a few seconds.

The villagers were even more dumbfounded.

What the hell was going on? Were they trying to rob the bandits with just the two of them?

“Did...did you come to save us?” asked a villager softly.

“I’m sorry, we didn’t!” Mo Fan waved his hand and summoned a powerful lightning bolt that landed in front of the villager that spoke.

The villager was just an ordinary human. There was no chance he could brace himself against the impact. The powerful lightning knocked him into the air and off the cliff like a kite with a broken string. He fell into the trees under the cliff. He was dead for sure, falling from that height!

However, no one noticed Mo Fan’s left hand emitting a silver flicker as he waved it in the direction of the cliff.

The villagers screamed out in panic after witnessing the sequence. Just a moment ago, Xi Ge had killed a villager with a Curse Spell as an example to the others, and now, two other bandits that had appeared out of nowhere had tossed a villager down the cliff, even though he did not offend them in any way. They were heartless murderers!

Xi Ge was stunned upon witnessing the murder.

As a matter of fact, he initially thought the two Asians were Magicians that had come to save the villagers. However, when he saw the man killing the villager even more callously than he did, he immediately eliminated the possibility!

“Which guild are you from?” Xi Ge could tell that Mo Fan was no ordinary Magician from his spell. Judging from how he spoke, he was likely someone of the same profession.

The truth was, Xi Ge had heard rumors that many bandits were setting eyes on this village that was wealthier than the other villages.

“A ransom of thirty million for you and your men, my patience is worse than yours,” said Mo Fan calmly. He then turned to the villagers and said, “Chief, ask your villagers to prepare the money too. Otherwise, I’ll toss one of you down the cliff every second.”

Asking money from both sides!

How savage!

Both the bandits and the villagers felt they were about to go crazy.

The villagers were in a better spot, as being robbed once or twice would not make any difference. They only had so much money.

Meanwhile, the Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild were losing their minds.

What kind of crazy joke is this? It was usually them robbing other people along the Caribbean Sea. No one had ever dared to rob them!
