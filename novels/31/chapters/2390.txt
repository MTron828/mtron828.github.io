Mo Fan did not have time to waste on the young man. He used Blink to relocate himself, and reappeared in the air. The silver light of the Space Magic gave him a clear outline in the dark.

“Double Blink!” the captain of the City Hunters at the end of the street exclaimed.

Everything had happened in the wink of an eye. Mo Fan was clearly on the street just a second ago, but he immediately went to the roof to stop the young man, before promptly reappearing in the air beside the Wind Mage and the vampire!

The Duke of Syam was about to stick his fangs through Zhou Li’s neck when Mo Fan grabbed his hair from behind.

Mo Fan pulled the vampire’s hair to prevent him from killing the Wind Mage. He flung his arm with great force and threw the vampire away!

The vampire slammed into the ground, smashing the concrete to pieces. Even the windows of the nearby cars were shattered into pieces. It dramatically displayed how shocking Mo Fan’s strength was after imbuing his arm with Space Magic!

“Every time I want to enjoy something delicious, there’s always someone like you around to disturb me!” the Duke of Syam roared like an enraged lion. His hair and beard were drifting wildly in the air.

A black mist spread from him, countless wings beating wildly inside it.

Sets of sinister green glowing eyes appeared in the mist. Mo Fan wanted to get closer to the vampire, but the black mist drove him back.

The bats in the mist shrieked. They were not only flying at Mo Fan in a huge swarm, but toward the people in the houses too!

They broke in through the windows, the door cracks, and the ventilation. The vampire desperately needed more fresh blood. He was no longer satisfied with the rate of transmission from the threads of blood alone. He had ordered the bats to feed on the people directly!

There were shocking numbers of the bats. Mo Fan only managed to eliminate half of them using a few Fire Spells. The other half broke into a nearby apartment.

Mo Fan was feeling restricted. After all, his Super Magic could easily raze the whole street to the ground, but he would endanger many innocent lives if he used a Super Spell.

The disgusting vampire was using it to his advantage. He was blatantly feeding on the residents!

Mo Fan glanced at the temporary settlement three hundred meters away. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It was exactly where the little girl lived. There were too many bats for Mo Fan to handle by himself.

The greedy bats were not going to spare even a single drop of blood in their prey. They were going to reap all the citizen’s lives!

“What...what kind of monster is that!?” the young man blurted out in astonishment. It felt like the whole town was being swarmed by the dangerous bats!

“It’s a Ruler-level creature,” Mo Fan responded. “Go protect the people!”

“There are too many of them. We won’t be able to handle them all!” the middle-aged captain protested.

The City Hunters had thought it was just a little disturbance. It was not their first day of work, and they thought they could handle the disturbance with ease.

To their surprise, they had stumbled into a Ruler-level member of the Blood Tribe!

The City Hunters were well aware of the existence of the Blood Tribe. The Blood Tribe was responsible for many cases with missing leads, but the City Hunters always had trouble arresting them.

However, they had only encountered the weaker members of the Blood Tribe. The Commander-level Blood Tribesmen that had been around for more than a hundred years were already terrifying to them. They never thought they would encounter a Ruler-level Blood Tribesman who had been around for a thousand years.

If they went too close, they were simply presenting themselves as food, just like Zhou Li!

“Blood Cage!” a pleasant voice uttered imperiously.

The noisy town suddenly fell silent after the words. A huge cage formed from veins of blood emerged in the center of the town.

The bats shrieked in agony as they exploded into pieces.

They were so close to reaching their prey. Most of the residents were standing there in their sleep, just waiting to be fed on!

However, the bats had died in a strange way before they could take a bite.

“Who is it!? Who is it!? Who dares to challenge my authority!?” the Duke of Syam snarled.

That Blood Cage was obviously a power of the Blood Tribe! Another member of the Blood Tribe had appeared and killed all his bats!

An alluring figure slowly descended from the blood-red sky. A pair of wings like those belonging to a dark elf stood upright behind her. Even her ears and eyes were brimming with extraordinary charm.

She did not have the disgusting appearance of a primordial vampire like the Duke of Syam. She had a unique beauty instead!

“It’s you again! Why are you behaving like a slave to the humans, despite having our noble blood?” the Duke of Syam scowled.

“Old monster, this time you won’t have the chance to climb out of your coffin again. I’m going to smash your soul into pieces!” Liu Ru walked down a tall building.

She was not taking the stairs. She was walking casually along the wall of the building!

“You’ve fought him before?” Mo Fan asked in surprise.

“Mm, he’s one of the mutants that doesn’t obey the rules. I only learned about his existence in recent years. He murders people and breeds living humans in captivity. He has also done a lot of disgusting things. I’ve tried asking the Enforcement Union for help, but for some reason, the Enforcement Union isn’t too concerned about him,” Liu Ru spat.

“It seems like the Magic City has a lot of filth and darkness we aren’t aware of,” Mo Fan mused aloud.

An existence like the Duke of Syam would never behave himself as a human and drink only a mouthful of blood without harming his prey. His fangs had torn open countless victims’ necks.

But the Magic City was just too big!

Its population was easily over ten million, not to mention it had been upgraded to a headquarters city. As more people moved to the city, it was difficult to keep track of the missing people. Mo Fan would not be surprised if the Duke of Syam had fed on thousands of people!

“There’s someone even more terrifying behind him,” Liu Ru noted.

“I think we have a rough idea who it is,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“They mainly target people who have recently moved to the Magic City. They use their influence to disguise it as a proper enterprise and hide their crimes,” Liu Ru went on.

Liu Ru had heard rumors from the mutant races, but had never had the chance to find out the truth.

The leaders among the mutant races were similar to the old demons in the Sacred City. They either had minimal differences from humans, or it was almost impossible to track down their whereabouts.

Liu Ru had only confirmed the Duke of Syam’s existence after seeing him today.

“Your control over the mutant races is like child’s play in our eyes. Why would we ever allow ourselves to be controlled?” the Duke of Syam shouted.

“Controlled?” A red demonic figure appeared behind the Duke of Syam. Its aura outlined a ghastly bulky figure, like an emperor’s throne!

“We are the ones who make the rules!” the red figure proclaimed.
