“Strange, isn’t it supposed to be summer soon? Why is Venice getting colder?” Mo Fan zipped past a bridge with Fleeing Shadow. He was heading toward the training ground where the team had been asked to gather.

As soon as he arrived at the grassy training ground, he stumbled into Zhao Manyan.

“Holy crap, where the heck did you go?!” Zhao Manyan screamed as soon as he saw Mo Fan.

“Didn’t I tell you I’d be away for some time? What’s with the surprised look? Did something happen?” Mo Fan asked in confusion.

“Of course something happened! Come here, I’ll explain it to you slowly,” Zhao Manyan pulled Mo Fan aside.

Zhao Manyan had his own sources of information. He definitely had learned about the incident with the Mu Clan. Besides, it was something to do with Mu Ningxue. He told Mo Fan everything he knew.

——

The training ground had the style of ancient Rome. It was surrounded by stone pillars, with a grassy field at the center, and resembled a luxurious soccer field.

The students were training by having friendly duels against one another. The tournament was just around the corner, so they would use every second to prepare themselves for it.

At the front of the training ground, Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni were dueling absent-mindedly. Their spells were flying back and forth, yet none actually posed any threat to the other person.

Mu Tingying controlled her ice chains. They were supposed to be attacking Nanrong Ni, yet they landed on the edge of the barrier nearby and disappeared immediately.

Nanrong Ni could tell that Mu Tingying was unfocused. She said, “You’re still thinking about it?”

“How can I possibly forget about it? That b**ch dares to challenge our Mu Clan! I’m pretty sure that she’s tired of living!” Mu Tingying snapped anxiously.

They initially wanted to humiliate Mu Ningxue, but she was still able to use the Ice Crystal Bow on them and freeze them on the bridge for twelve hours straight. Even their souls were frozen by the powerful frost!

Most terrifyingly, she had taken the remaining pieces from Pan Xi!

Pan Xi had collected all the pieces. He only needed to collect the incomplete bow from Mu Ningxue and hand Nanrong Ni the full set, but he did not expect it to turn out like this. Mu Ningxue would soon have the complete Ice Crystal Bow!

They could only ask the powerful Super Mages for help. Otherwise, they would not be able to touch Mu Ningxue at all!

The problem was, they were currently in Venice! The experts of the Mu Clan were not around. Even if someone was here, it was unlikely they would be willing to lend a hand for a matter like this! Even worse, not everyone in the Mu Clan agreed with the decision to take Mu Ningxue out!

They initially thought they could turn Mu Ningxue into a lowly tramp, yet things suddenly got so much more complicated!

“If she takes our advice and disappears, she can still live a normal life. But now, she can’t even live like an ordinary human. Don’t worry, she is going to suffer badly since she decided to fight back. I’m pretty sure the Mu Clan won’t allow anyone to disrespect its rules?” Nanrong Ni said.

“Even so, we still need some way to gather the attention of the authorities in the clan. I’m just worried that some of the old folks will go easy on her,” Mu Tingying said.

“It’s very simple. If it’s only between you two, those old folks will only think of it as infighting and get over it, but if Mu Ningxue actually hurts me, it meant she was disrespecting the close relationship between your clan and the Nanrong Clan. Wouldn’t she be in great trouble if I ask the people of my Nanrong Clan to approach the authorities of your clan?” Nanrong Ni proposed.

“But she didn’t hurt you, her arrow only froze everyone...” Mu Tingying saw the strange glitter in Nanrong Ni’s eyes as she was speaking. The cunning look in her eyes was completely different than how she appeared normally, so even Mu Tingying was stunned when she saw it.

“You mean...” Mu Tingying looked at Nanrong Ni.

“Use your ice chains to hurt me, and everything will go according to plan!” Nanrong Ni said.

“You are truly the smarter one. The Mu Clan is very concerned about your clan’s opinion of us, just so we could maintain a good relationship between the two clans. If you go on and complain about her, the higher-ups of my clan will be infuriated, and they will demand we arrest Mu Ningxue as soon as possible. They might even send disciplinary elders after her!” Mu Tingying smiled. It was such a brilliant idea!

Nanrong Ni had a faint smile, too. She was better at hiding her thoughts than Mu Tingying. No one could possibly think that she had such evil thoughts under her gentle appearance!

As the two were talking, a scorching wave of heat appeared at the other end of the training ground.

The two girls turned around and saw a man engulfed in wild flames walking toward them. His eyes were full of lava on the verge of spurting out!

“It’s Mo Fan!” For some reason, Mu Tingying was frightened whenever she saw Mo Fan around. It had been like that since she had witnessed how Mo Fan had killed Lu Yilin without hesitation. Mu Tingying was not afraid of strong Mages, as she had an enormous clan supporting her. She did not need to be scared of people just because they were stronger than her.

However, Mu Tingying was scared of maniacs like Mo Fan, who did not seem to care about the overall situation. It was like he was clueless about how powerful a renowned clan was. He would only rush up and kill the person that had infuriated him, without thinking about the consequences!

“Don’t be afraid, he is mostly here to vent his anger. We’ll ask those two to lend us a hand,” Nanrong Ni seemed a lot calmer.

The flames were growing hotter as the carpet of fire reached Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying’s feet.

BANG! A pillar of lava erupted from the ground, powered by Mo Fan’s wrath!

When Mo Fan arrived in front of Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying, his eyes were glaring at them, and his hair was also standing on its end due to overwhelming anger!

“You two shameful b**ches! If anything happens to Mu Ningxue, I’m going to burn you two into ashes!” snapped Mo Fan.

“Mu Ningxue is a disciple of our clan, meaning that she has to obey the decisions of the clan. We didn’t decide her fate!” Nanrong Ni retorted calmly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I had enough of your bullshit!” Mo Fan had no intention to waste his time further talking to the two b**ches. “Sky-Flame Funeral!”

He held the flames up and tossed them into the air. They turned into a huge fiery cloud looming over Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying.

Fierce flames stared pouring down, forming waves. An ocean of fire surrounded Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni. The Sky-Flame Funeral kept falling continuously, like the imperishable rage in Mo Fan’s heart!

What was there to talk about to these two evil women? Weren’t they thinking about shining on the stage of the World College Tournament? Mo Fan would not mind crippling them right now!

“Mo Fan, what are you doing? Are you seriously trying to hurt your own teammates!?” Ai Jiangtu immediately yelled to stop Mo Fan.

The spell that Mo Fan cast was unacceptable within the boundaries of a friendly duel. He was simply trying to burn the two to death, as the flames were lunging at them like a fiery demon!

“It’s none of your business! If I don’t turn them into cripples today, my surname won’t be Mo anymore!” Mo Fan swore furiously.

Ai Jiangtu was startled. He did not know what to say for a moment.

He had heard about Mu Ningxue, and he was well aware of who was in the right and wrong, yet Mo Fan was crossing the line if he continued to attack Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni with his magic!

“Don’t provoke him, he’s basically a mad man now,” Nanyu shook her head at Ai Jiangtu, telling him to stay out of the conflict.

Mo Fan was indeed a maniac, just as Nanyu had mentioned. He would see anyone that tried to stop him as an enemy, as he was extremely stubborn when it came to doing something he had decided!

“You crazy asshole, do you really think you are superior to us?!” Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni were surrounded by ice glaciers within the flames, protecting them from the scorching heat. The frost seemed to be putting out the flames slowly.

As the frost grew further, Mo Fan’s Sky-Flame Funeral slowly weakened. The frost gradually dominated the heat from Mo Fan.

“A country hick like you who only has an advantage because of mere luck, do you really think you’re unstoppable on the team, so you can do whatever you want?” Mu Tingying stomped the ground and spread the frost further. She had turned the grassy training ground into an ice mirror within a short time.

“I’m telling you, this is a Soul-grade Ice Seed! Your flames are nothing against me!” Mu Tingying’s aura grew stronger as the icy wind turned into a storm surging across the place. The others were forced to back away a great distance.

The crowd stared at Mu Tingying in astonishment.

Even though most people on the team had been concealing their true strength, none of them thought that Mu Tingying had already acquired a Soul-grade Ice Seed. The Mu Clan had seriously invested a lot in her, just so she could stand out during the World College Tournament!

Nanrong Ni stood behind Mu Tingying and was murmuring something under her breath. The chant seemed to possess the power of the Parthenon Temple, the Blessing Element.

She was strengthening Mu Tingying’s magic, allowing her frost to grow stronger and suppress Mo Fan’s flames!

“Mo Fan, you’ve overdone it this time. We are going to teach you a lesson!” Zu Jiming stepped forward. It was obvious that he was on Mu Tingying’s side.

“Humph, I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time!” Li Kaifeng stood beside Nanrong Ni, as if he had sworn to protect the woman if Mo Fan dared to harm her.

Everyone knew how strong Mo Fan was, especially with the powerful Little Flame Belle as his Contracted Beast. Even though Mu Tingying had grown a lot stronger, she was still no match for Mo Fan.

However, with the four teaming up, they were surely able to take down the maniac!
