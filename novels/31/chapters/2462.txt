Zhang Xiaohou was waiting.

The phone booth in the garden where Zhang Xiaohou was waiting started ringing after the sky turned colors as the sun was on the horizon.

Zhang Xiaohou took the call and nodded. He quickly wrote down some numbers on the ground with his Wind Magic.

“I’ve confirmed the location of the Induction. Let’s go!” Zhang Xiaohou told Zhao Manyan. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Fan and Mu Bai were already riding the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon to Qinghuangdao.

Zhang Xiaohou had to wait until a place was chosen for the Induction. He had just received the information he needed.

Zhang Xiaohou rode the Flying Dragon with Zhao Manyan. They soared directly into the sky and flew toward the Bohai Sea, even though the Flying Dragon might cause some panic in Hawaii.

——

The Flying Dragon was well-rested. It flew to its destination at its quickest speed.

The sun that was falling below the horizon was directly ahead of them. The Flying Dragon was shockingly fast, and almost caught up to the setting sun’s speed. They had been flying for several hours, but the sun was still hanging on the horizon!

(Ed. Note: It’s traveling almost 1000 mph)

They finally reached the Bohai Sea. The sun had completely disappeared under the horizon, allowing the darkness to fall across the sea.

“Brother Zhao, I must say you have a high notion of your duty when it really matters, even though you normally treasure your life!” Zhang Xiaohou complimented him.

“What do you mean?” Zhang Xiaohou was confused. Why was Zhang Xiaohou looking at him like that?

“Weren’t you listening when we were discussing our plan?” Zhang Xiaohou asked.

“What are you referring to?” Zhao Manyan was clueless.

“Once the Induction Seal appears, it means the Forbidden Curse is close to being completed. It covers a truly massive area, and it might even trigger a Gravitational Vortex to prevent living creatures within the Forbidden Curse’s coverage from escaping to safety...” Zhang Xiaohou explained.

Zhao Manyan reacted like a startled cat after hearing those words. If he was covered in fur, it would instantly have stood on its end.

“Holy crap, are you saying if Mo Fan and Mu Bai fail to stop the Induction, the Forbidden Curse is going to land on us!?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Zhang Xiaohou nodded. It was the reason why he had chosen to check the Forbidden Curse’s target point. He had to do the dangerous job himself!

To Zhang Xiaohou’s surprise, Zhao Manyan had the courage to come with him. Zhang Xiaohou was very impressed!

Zhao Manyan dropped his jaw! He never thought he was going to the area where the Forbidden Curse was targeting.

He was not na?ve enough to think he could survive the Forbidden Curse, even with his defenses. In other words, if Mo Fan and Mu Bai failed their mission, he and Zhang Xiaohou would have to face the Forbidden Curse!

For God’s sake, did he lose his mind? Why did he choose to go with Zhang Xiaohou? It was worse than trying to interrupt the Forbidden Curse!

“Is it too late to change groups now?” As soon as Zhao Manyan finished the sentence, thin yet visible rays of light descended from the sky.

They split up the sea and the sky into different parts, like geometrical lines.

It was already dark, but a strange light was shining upon the area, like a thin illusion. The surroundings turned a little blurry, like they were heading into a mirage.

“What’s happening now!?” Zhao Manyan blurted out in shock.

Zhang Xiaohou said with a wry smile, “Didn’t I mention it? The Forbidden Curse might trigger a Gravitational Vortex.”

“I’m not good with my studies. Can you please explain what a Gravitational Vortex is?” Zhao Manyan was starting to feel uneasy.

The sight was too shocking. It was not exaggerating to say the world was changing. Zhao Manyan might have believed that everything within view would be dragged into a deep abyss in the next second!

“It’s similar to the gravity of the Earth, which we can only escape by traveling at a certain speed. Otherwise, we won’t be able to reach other planets.

“The Forbidden Curse has a gravitational field, so unless our speed and momentum is enough to exceed its force, we won’t be able to escape to safety!

“It takes a long time to Cast a Forbidden Curse, but it obviously won’t allow its target to escape easily. The Gravitational Vortex is the first sign of a Forbidden Curse!” Zhang Xiaohou patiently explained to Zhao Manyan.

“You don’t have to explain the details. Just tell me, is it too late for me to make a run?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Yes, the Gravitational Vortex covers dozens of kilometers. If the Forbidden Curse is the God of Death, every creature within its area now has their names written in the Book of Life and Death,” Zhang Xiaohou informed him.

Different Forbidden Curses had different levels of Gravitational Vortexes. Zhang Xiaohou had only learned about some of the Forbidden Curses’ powers from the military.

If using the Earth’s gravity to describe the Gravitational Vortex was not clear enough, one could treat the Gravitational Vortex as invisible chains.

Creatures as small as flies to as large as Ruler-level sea monsters within the area covered by the rays of light were tied to the chains.

They would need to exceed the restraining force of the chains to break free from them, or the chains would eventually drag them back!

Zhang Xiaohou could not reach the required speed needed to escape a Forbidden Curse.

Most Super Mages could not reach it, either. Even the Flying Dragon, Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon, and the powerful sea monsters could not reach it.

The only thing they could do was to look up at the lights and wait for the Forbidden Curse to be stopped prior to its Induction, or watch it fall on them!

Zhang Xiaohou knew there was no backing away from his decision. He had placed his life in Mo Fan and Mu Bai’s hands.

“So if we want to live, first, it must be a trap the sea monsters have set, and second, Mo Fan and Mu Bai must stop the Forbidden Curse successfully?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Yes.”

“But what if it isn’t a trap? Mo Fan and Mu Bai won’t stop the Forbidden Curse, which means it will happen according to the plan. As for the two of us who are stuck in the Gravitational Vortex...”

“That’s why I’m impressed by your resolve,” Zhang Xiaohou smiled, like he was not going to feel lonely even if he died here.

Zhao Manyan’s face paled.. He had completely lost the will to live.
