Captain Pan soon arrived.

“Is that... Madam Mu Xumian?” it took Captain Pan some time to recognize the person in a terrible condition to be Mu Xumian. She looked like she was being nibbled away by some parasite instead of her usual seductive appearance.

“Enough talking, we’re running out of time to save her!” Mu Bai snapped.

“Oh, but is the Sacred Chant really going to work?” Captain Pan asked. He still walked up to Mu Xumian despite being doubtful. He placed his hand on Mu Xumian’s face and murmured the Sacred Chant to cast the spell Purify.

Sacred Chant: Purify was an advanced version of the Basic Light Spell. The spell Brilliant Light had a lot of variations, and one of them was especially effective against undead and corrupted existences. The Sacred Chant further improved its purifying ability. Captain Pan was using the Sacred Chant, which Zhao Manyan had yet to master.

The chant was incomprehensible, similar to the chants which monks uttered during religious ceremonies in the east, or the prayer uttered before graves in the west. Every civilization had its way of putting the dead to rest. Unfortunately, the creatures in this world would not necessarily stay in their graves and behave themselves, and the religious chants and prayers had evolved into the Sacred Chant of the Light Element, designed to put the corrupted spirits that were harboring malicious intentions to the world back to their rest!

The graduate was utterly confused. She did not understand why Mu Xumian would use the Sacred Chant on someone who was still alive. Did he assume Mu Xumian was going to die, and the pain and torture she was going through would make her rise from the dead to get her revenge?

The Sacred Chant was still taking effect. Golden sparkles were visible rising from Mu Xumian’s body. They were coming out of her skin, and turned into some kind of glowing words and notes after being exposed to the air. They continued to float into the air and dissipate slowly.

However, the graduate soon noticed wisps of ghastly aura rising from the glowing notes. She could even see a pair of ghostly eyes when she was staring at them.

“AH!!”

Mu Xumian suddenly sat upright and opened her mouth, as if she was trying to use all her might to spit something out. A darker substance poured out of her mouth like a cloud of thick black smoke and lingered in the room, followed by a burst of strange and piercing laughter.

“This...” Captain Pan was astounded. He finally realized what was going on. He focused on uttering the Sacred Chant, just in case the strange black smoke ended up Possessing him!

Mu Xumian fell onto the bed feebly after spitting out the black smoke. Her eyelids remained open with rolling eyes.

Mu Bai let out a relieved sigh, and told the graduate, “You may use the Healing Magic now.”

“Oh, got it!” The graduate felt like she had just been knocked unconscious by something unknown. She suddenly had no clue what Healing Spell she should use. Mu Bai actually had to remind her that a basic spell that would help Mu Xumian regenerate blood was sufficient.

Mu Xumian was still in bad condition. Some time later, Li Kai led an Advanced Healer into the room. The older Healer was roughly in his sixties.

The graduate sensibly stepped aside when she saw the old man. She roughly explained the situation to him.

The old man inspected Mu Xumian and cast a Healing Spell to help her regenerate blood. Mu Xumian finally showed some signs of recovery.

“She’s no longer in danger,” the old man declared.

Li Kai went up to Mu Bai and snarled, “Tell me what happened to her!”

“She was Possessed by some corrupted existence. Why don’t you recall what wicked things your Dali Clan has been up to recently, where someone would Summon such a terrifying Spirit to Possess her?!” Mu Bai spat back.

Mu Bai had to admit that Mu Xumian was extremely lucky. Not even one out of a hundred Light Mages would know how to use the Sacred Chant: Purify. Mu Bai happened to have read the dossiers on the members of the South Wing Platoon, and remembered someone was capable of using the spell. Otherwise, even if they had figured out the reason, there would have been nothing they could do, apart from watching Mu Xumian get tortured to death!

“Humph, I’ll make you pay once she’s awake!” Li Kai declared.

“She’s fine now, I’ll leave the rest to you.” Mu Bai had never expected the people of the Dali Clan to be grateful to him.

Mu Xumian had always been Fanxue Mountain’s enemy, not to mention what the woman had done to them personally. Mu Bai would not feel guilty at all if he simply left her for dead. He even wondered why he bothered saving her. Perhaps he might have had trouble proving that he was innocent if the woman died in his house, which might have ended up bringing a lot of trouble to Fanxue Mountain.

“Li Kai, don’t say that, you clearly saw how terrible Madam Mu’s condition was. If the chief hadn’t figured out the reason, she might already be dead by now!” Captain Pan admonished him.

If Captain Pan had been handling the situation, he would most likely have assumed Mu Xumian was poisoned or placed under a Curse. There was no way he would have used the Sacred Chant on a living human. Little did they know, she was Possessed by a terrifying existence. They only had half an hour to save her life. It was already a miracle that they managed to bring Mu Xumian back from the Gates of Hell!

Mu Bai walked down the street thoughtfully after he left the headquarters of the South Wing Platoon. He knew the incident was not as simple as it seemed.

Mu Xumian was a Super Mage. It was very unlikely that someone could harm her with poison, Curse, or some strange magic so easily. Wouldn’t the whole world be in disorder if an Intermediate or Advanced Mage with the Poison or Curse Elements could simply murder a Super Mage?

“It almost killed her in just half an hour! Just how is that possible?” Mu Bai murmured. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

During the long time he had spent in the Ancient Capital, he had stumbled into corrupted existences that were able to Possess their victims, but there were usually bad omens beforehand. The torture would usually last for a few hours before killing even a Mage without impressive cultivation. It was terrifying to think that the thing was able to kill a Super Mage like Mu Xumian in just half an hour!

In other words, if he had not figured out it was Undead Magic, or if no one in the South Wing Platoon had been able to use the Sacred Chant, Mu Xumian would surely have died!

“These things usually take time to settle down. It must be somewhere Mu Xumian always went to...(sigh) Forget it, why should I worry so much about her?” Mu Bai shook his head, feeling that he had been caring too much.
