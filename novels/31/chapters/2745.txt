Chapter 2746: Let Raiju Take Over

Seventh Granny’s dark green pant legs tore open. Several drops of blood spilled out.

She reacted fast and moved backwards in a flash. Otherwise, the Royal Pattern Wolf would have ripped her stomach open.

“Savage beast! How dare you hurt me?!” Seventh Granny cried in rage. She laced her hands together. Countless thick roots erupted upwards from the lychee orchard surrounding them.

The lychee roots grew rapidly and covered the entire courtyard. It was now a fortress made up of roots entirely trapping Royal Pattern Wolf inside.

“Howl!” The Royal Pattern Wolf howled. Its hackles rose. Countless blazing star bugs flew everywhere from under its smooth fur.

The blazing star bugs stuck on the lychee roots. The crimson star bugs then released a blazing-hot light energy. The red-light energy surrounded the lychee roots and devoured them.

The thick and sturdy roots withered easily. They were turned to ash as the crimson star bugs sucked out their vitality instantly.

Puff! Puff! Puff!

After the crimson star bugs sucked all the vitality, they became blazing hot, and returned under the Royal Pattern Wolf’s fur. The Royal Pattern Wolf’s fur glowed. The Royal Pattern Wolf looked as if it was armored with scorching patterns. Its limbs grew stronger.

Swish! Swish!

The Royal Pattern Wolf slashed the roots with its claws as if they were just weeds. The lychee roots were sent flying in the air. The Royal Pattern Wolf then split into nine afterimage and moved at a breakneck speed.

Nine Shadow Slitting Throat!

Nine Shadow Slitting Throat was the Royal Pattern Wolf’s killing move. It could only perform such explosive power and aggression under the reinforcement of destructive scorching patterns.

......

Seventh Granny was so terrified that her face turned pale. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The Royal Pattern Wolf was an orthodox ruler-level beast. When its star bugs performed at their best and all its wolf patterns revealed themselves, the Royal Pattern Wolf’s combat power improved by multiple folds. Even though Seventh Granny had a high level of cultivation, she found it difficult to take on the ever-changing Royal Pattern Wolf on her own.

Seventh Granny tried to keep as far away as possible from the Royal Pattern Wolf. It was necessary to keep a distance when confronting a ruler-level beast as dangerous as this. However, the Royal Pattern Wolf moved as quickly as lightning under the nine afterimages. It slashed at Seventh Granny’s throat with its terrifying claws.

Seventh Granny hurriedly summoned her magical shield mountain equipment. Although the magical shield mountain equipment was huge and strong, the Royal Pattern shattered it in a single swipe. Seventh Granny spat blood and fell onto the ground with her shattered pieces of magical shield mountain equipment.

“Granny!” Le Nan cried out in shock. She quickly dashed forward to stop the Royal Pattern Wolf from biting Seventh Granny. A wolf shadow light appeared surrounding the Royal Pattern Wolf and Le Nan was sent flying.

“Savage beast!” An icy cold voice thundered.

A dark blue figure flashed by. It was the middle-aged woman who was always clad in dark blue. She glowed with a bronze liquid. The liquid transformed into a heavy bell.

The bronze water bell flashed. When the Royal Pattern Wolf banged against it, it made a loud resounding noise. A small part of the Royal Pattern Wolf’s sharp claws broke.

Even though the woman in dark blue clothes was just using Water element magical power, the bell was as hard as bronze. Her power was rare. Mo Fan’s mouth twitched. He stood at the side and watched the match.

Although the Royal Pattern Wolf’s claws broke, it had not lost its combat power.The star bugs danced around once again. The star bugs flew to the surrounding pine grove and bamboo. The plants instantly withered. Even the animals around were reduced to their bones.

The Royal Pattern Wolf’s bleeding claws fell off and regrew at an impossible speed. The bruises and scratches on its body healed. After sucking the life force, the Royal Pattern Wolf’s combat efficiency increased once again.

The Royal Pattern Wolf was in a situation where it would only grow stronger as the battle progressed. This would grant him sufficient time to accumulate destructive scorching patterns, unyielding star patterns, and vitality-sucking patterns before advancing from ruler-level category.

Of course, the Royal Pattern Wolf’s biggest weakness was ambush and direct destructive power.

“Get behind me and treat your wounds. I’ll fight it,” said Granny Lan to Seventh Granny.

“You have to rip him apart. Redeem our holy spring essence!” Seventh Granny screamed.

“Don’t worry. No one can leave this island alive with our holy spring essence,” said Granny Lan.

Her body was still covered with bronze liquid, like an invertebrate creature that had thousands of lives. The liquid could transform into whatever shape Granny Lan wanted.

It was Granny Lan’s turn to counterattack the Royal Pattern Wolf. The bronze liquid transformed into a long whip covered with thorns.

“Howl! Howl! Howl!”

Granny Lan swung her bronze water whip skillfully.She sometimes made it spin above her head and swung it like a snake. She turned the whip on Royal Pattern Wolf and struck it.

‘Her supernatural power looks interesting.’ Mo Fan watched her attentively.

The bronze liquid was part of the Water element supernatural power. It had several special effects including transformation power, solidification, and the ability to become as hard as bronze and stone. If the power was fully mastered and combined with other elements, it would have a strong effect.

It was clear that Granny Lan was an expert. She was a Wind element mage, too. With such powerful magical equipment in her hand, she wasn’t concerned even if something as strong as Royal Pattern Wolf was near her.

Granny Lan used her bronze water whip to attack and defend herself. Regardless of how fast the Royal Pattern Wolf was, it could not escape her ubiquitous ruthless whip.

Snap!

A loud snapping sound cut across the air. It was louder than firecrackers. Granny Lan stored her power before she struck. Her bronze water whip unwound with tremendous force, causing an explosive blast in the air.

The Royal Pattern Wolf was sent flying a few hundred meters away and fell next to Mo Fan. Its forehead was injured. The blood flowed down to its ears and eyes.

“You’re no match for her. Let Raiju take over it,” said Mo Fan to Royal Pattern Wolf.

Granny Lan’s strength was many times stronger than Seventh Granny. Mo Fan could not underestimate her.
