“Wait!” Lingling shouted once again.

Song Feiyao turned to Mo Fan. He nodded.

Lingling was smart. She was someone who considered the bigger picture. She wasn’t a coward nor was she reckless without reason. Her sense of morality was more accurate and reliable than Mo Fan in his opinion.

Song Feiyao asked the Green East Sea God to come to a halt. The Green East Sea God spread its wings and slanted slightly. Its feathers were blown upright because of the air, and it hovered in the air.

“Zhang Xiaohou is that Northern Xinjiang down there?” asked Lingling.

!!

Zhang Xiaohou looked down. It was difficult to know for sure from such a high altitude. But he was all too familiar with the land in Northern Xinjiang because he had fought in a war there a long time ago.

“It’s Northern Xinjiang,” Zhang Xiaohou said with great conviction.

“How high can the Green East Sea God fly?” Lingling asked Song Feiyao.

“As high as the space above this sky. What do you want to do?” Song Feiyao asked in confusion.

“I want it to fly as high as possible. Besides, the weather must be clear at higher altitude,” Lingling said with great urgency.

No one knew what Lingling was up to. But she looked like she had a plan and could not explain everything to them right now.

“The Green East Sea God can manipulate the clouds and wind. However, it will have to stay in the troposphere. It cannot take you to the space above the sky,” said Song Feiyao.

“I’ll take her to the space above the sky. Meanwhile, you let the Green East Sea God manipulate the clouds and wind.” Mo Fan walked to Lingling’s side. The Wings of Dusk and Dawn on his back spread open. His Black Dragon Wings glowed like black alloy and blocked the bright sunshine, making him look like a dark angel.

Zhao Manyan was puzzled. “Seriously, why do you have the mood to admire the scenery in China right now?”

“Perhaps we won’t have a chance anymore in the future. Come, Lingling.” Mo Fan stretched out his hand.

Lingling wrapped her arms around Mo Fan’s neck without hesitation, allowing Mo Fan to lift her up into the sky.

Swoosh!

An enormous black figure soared up towards the highest point of the sky. Mo Fan’s Black Dragon Wings were not inferior to the Green East Sea God’s. He could fly as high as it could.

They flew toward the space above the sky. Even though Mo Fan did not understand why Lingling wanted to reach such a high altitude, he trusted her. She must have discovered something.

When Mo Fan reached the space above the sky, the Green East Sea God below them began manipulating the wind and clouds.

They could see a large expanse of land when they looked down from the space above the sky. This meant that the Green East Sea God had to make a large area of clouds scatter, and that area spanned hundreds and thousands of kilometers. Fortunately, the low altitude of the sky had only a few clouds condensed, and the weather was clear. The Green East Sea God only had to send the thin clouds away so that Mo Fan and Lingling could see the lands from the space above the sky.

This was exactly what Lingling had wanted. She wanted to see the large piece of land from the space above the sky. She wanted to look at the vast land of China!

...

The light shining from the space above the sky was splendid and not too glaring. It was simply breathtaking. This was Lingling’s first time reaching the space above the sky, and she could not take her eyes off the beautiful scenery.

However, she did not forget about the things she had to do.

She closed her eyes. All the geographical locations appeared in her mind. Then she recalled Helan Mountain, the monument at the Yellow River, the Ancient City Gate, Beiguan Town, Shenmu City, Jiayu City, the Ancient Capital, the Imperial Capital, Emperor Qin Island...

“What are you doing?” Mo Fan asked in confusion.

Lingling opened her eyes. The light from the space above the sky reflected in her eyes, and she looked even more ethereal. A hint of delight appeared in her eyes, too.

“I know where the divine walls from Sky Observing City are!” Lingling sounded thrilled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Even though this was not what Mo Fan had wanted to know about the most, he asked, “Where are they?”

“They are the Ancient Great Walls. Do you still remember them? When the beacon at Beiguan Town lit up, the Ancient Great Walls rose from the ground at Beiguan Town and stretched all the way to Divine Wood City. Regardless of whether they are still well preserved or buried under the loess, the divine power from the Ancient Great Walls of Beiguan Town is most likely a part of the divine walls of Sky Observing City!” Lingling could not contain her excitement.

The Ancient Great Walls at Beiguan Town...

When they fought Khufu, the Undead had covered the entire plain. The walls that rose from the ground and served as the watchtowers had blocked the Undead outside Northern Xinjiang. Mo Fan still vividly remembered that spectacular and majestic incident.

If not for the Ancient City Wall summoning the divine walls and serving as an ancient defense line, Mo Fan and his group would not have been able to stall for time and wait for Zhan Kong and his Undead army’s arrival.

‘Indeed, it was all because of the Ancient City Wall and the divine walls! Did this not fit perfectly with the divine power of the Ancient Great Wall?!’

“The divine walls at Sky Observing City are split into great walls to safeguard the country. The great walls were built during the Ancient King’s era. The Ancient King has achieved Apex level in his Earth element magical power. He was the one who destroyed Sky Observing City and expanded the divine walls. The divine walls then served as the defense line on the north of China and continued to expand in the following dynasties because the emperors of those dynasties were able to find similar building materials to the divine walls...” Lingling continued.

“Look at the seal of the sacred totem beast before turning to the great walls again.”

Lingling pointed at a piece of large land that had shrunk into a curved slab.

Mo Fan possessed a dragon sense so he could see very far. However, Lingling did not see the land. All she saw was a painting plate with a mixture of yellow, brown, black, and green colors.

Mo Fan used his dragon sense to see things within ten thousand miles. He saw the incomplete great wall relics. It was difficult to zoom in and see all the relics at such a high altitude. Still, Mo Fan tried his best to make up for the missing pieces!

“It’s not high enough. We must fly higher,” said Mo Fan.

They crossed a historic relic in a province. Mo Fan wanted to combine the great walls near Ningxia and Helan Mountain with the Ancient City Gate and Ancient City Wall at Beiguan Town. To gain an overall view of this, they had to reach the highest point of the sky and had to have incredible eyesight.

“It must be it! It must be it! Mo Fan, my deduction must be right!” Lingling said in excitement. However, her face had turned slightly blue.

“Lingling, it’s too cold up here. You could...,” began Mo Fan.

“It’s okay. I’m fine,” said Lingling weakly.

Suddenly, a cloud of bright flame flared up. Mo Fan’s hair and skin was ablaze.

The flames danced wildly. They were sacred and solemn. Mo Fan had transformed into the Chongming Divine Flame man and was flying toward the highest point of the space above the sky. Even meteors and stars were inferior to Mo Fan’s supreme divine flames!

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Mo Fan held Lingling close to him and continued flying toward the space above the sky. He was not aiming for a mountain or geographical area. He was looking for the great walls of China that spanned for thousands of miles!
