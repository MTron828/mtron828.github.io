“So we are back to square one now with no idea what to do? Is our fate really in Heaven’s hands?” Han Ji raised his head and glanced outside of the golden barrier.

His eye sockets covered in wrinkles suddenly contracted. His eyeballs almost fell right through them.

The Mountain Zombie...

The Mountain Zombie was already in the City North. Its gigantic figure, which poked straight into the dark clouds, was too strong of a visual impact. Its eyes emitted the glow of death, already sentencing the whole place to death!

“Great Deacon Hu Jin, right, Mu Bai, weren’t you suspicious of someone?!” said Zhou Ming suddenly to Mu Bai as she recalled something.

“Why do you know the name of Salan’s right-hand man?” blurted out the mysterious man in surprise.

As Zhang Xiaohou explained what he had witnessed in the Xianchi area, the mysterious man suddenly came to a realization.

It turned out that him watching over Hua Village had somehow saved Zhang Xiaohou’s life, as it prevented the Black Vatican from doing anything reckless.

“It’s not me being suspicious, I just want to tell you something that my mum unintentionally told me a while ago,” spoke up Mu Bai.

“Then tell us quick, the lives of millions of people are at stake! The slightest clue might be the key to stopping the disaster!” said Mo Fan.

Mu Bai nodded and said with a deep voice, “Yu Ang, I believe you still remember him?”

“Mm, the Black Vatican’s lackey; what about him?” asked Zhou Ming.

“My mum only learned that Yu Ang was a member of the Black Vatican recently. She immediately followed up with a sigh and said, if it wasn’t for my uncle, who provided for him and recommended him to Mu Zhuoyun, he wouldn’t even have had the chance to live a comfortable life,” said Mu Bai.

“It’s true that the Mu Family was the one that brought in Yu Ang, before Mu Zhuoyun adopted him. It’s so frustrating to learn that he was actually serving the Black Vatican!” said Zhao Kunsan, while clenching his teeth.

“Yu Ang was already with the Black Vatican before joining the Mu Family. Mu Bai, are you implying that your uncle was actually the one who brought Yu Ang into your family?” Mo Fan confirmed as he caught the important piece of information.

“I...I don’t know, but I must tell you that the person who relocated the survivors of Bo City to the Ancient Capital was my uncle. He was responsible for it,” emphasized Mu Bai.

“Isn’t your uncle Mu He?” blurted out Zhao Kunsan.

As soon as the name was mentioned, Zhang Xiaohou palpitated with terror, as he suffered a sharp pain that felt like his head was about to explode!

President Han Ji’s eyes flickered. His face was filled with shock when he saw Zhang Xiaohou suddenly in pain.

Han Ji walked up to Zhang Xiaohou and grabbed his wrist. He quickly tore his sleeves open!

A black mark like a centipede was under Zhang Xiaohou’s skin on his arm. It looked like it was trying to dig deeper into his flesh, an extremely terrifying sight.

“Amnesia Bug!” Han Ji exclaimed in shock!

Su Xiaoluo and Mo Fan were stunned too. They were totally unaware of the black centipede inside Zhang Xiaohou’s body. It was difficult to tell how long the black centipede had stayed in his body. It was already as thick as a thumb. The thought of something like it inside someone’s body was incredibly gruesome!

Zhang Xiaohou seemed to be in extreme pain. His lips almost started bleeding as he bit his lips trying to endure the pain.

Han Ji’s body unleashed a milky-white glow, as a Healing Spirit Butterfly with huge wings danced on his fingertips. As Han Ji lifted his finger softly, the Healing Spirit floated into Zhang Xiaohou’s body and collided with the scary black poisonous centipede.

Zhang Xiaohou’s skin nearly turned transparent. A line of poison extended all the way from his wrist to his shoulder, then to the back of his neck, before disappearing into the back of his head...

“It’s the Amnesia Bug, no wonder he couldn’t remember what happened or who the person was. The Amnesia Bug is an eerie Psychic Element creature. It can eat the most important memory hidden deep inside one’s heart. If the person somehow remembers what happened during the day, it also means their life has come to an end!” explained the mysterious man.

“So that means the more memory he recovers...” Su Xiaoluo looked at the mysterious man in astonishment.

“The more he recovered, the closer he was to death! The medicine you’ve treated him with has most likely slowed down the Amnesia Bug’s growth. Otherwise, the poisonous creature would have killed him earlier. It’s a vicious art invented with the combination of the Psychic Element and Curse Element!” Han Ji gasped.

Zhang Xiaohou was in incredible pain, his body soaked in cold sweat. Even his veins were about to burst out from his skin.

The scariest thing was, the Amnesia Bug that looked like a centipede seemed to notice that its life was in danger. It followed the black line and climbed all the way to the back of Zhang Xiaohou’s head after killing the Healing Spirit!

“The Amnesia Bug has already grown into its adult phase. It’s extremely difficult to kill it now. It seems like not only did your friend hear Great Deacon Hu Jin’s voice, he must have learned their secret, too. However, he couldn’t remember it, he only remembered the man’s voice,” said the mysterious man in a deep voice.

Mo Fan and Su Xiaoluo’s hearts flinched when they saw Zhang Xiaohou suffering.

They initially thought Zhang Xiaohou had already fully recovered, he was only pretending to suffer from amnesia in order to protect himself from the Black Vatican. Even Zhang Xiaohou himself had no clue that he had actually forgotten the most important secret he was hiding in his heart. If the deepest memory surged into his mind, it would bring death upon him!

“Mu He, it’s Mu He!” screamed Zhang Xiaohou at the top of his lungs in the midst of the incredible pain, “And...and...”

“Stop it now, or you’re going to die!” yelled Han Ji.

The memory after Zhang Xiaohou encountered the Hatchet Corpse General surged into his mind, like a dream that he had forgotten for a long time. However, the more he thought about it, the stronger the sensation he felt as if his brain was about to explode!

Suddenly, the mysterious man made his move, hitting the back of Zhang Xiaohou’s neck with a hard blow to knock him out.

Zhang Xiaohou fell unconscious. He stopped searching for the lost memory. Meanwhile, the vein filled with the terrifying black poison slowly vanished too.

His body was pale white. Not a trace of blood could be seen on his face. Everyone gasped when they saw the Amnesia Bug!

Suffering from amnesia was not scary, but what was scarier was when you thought you remembered everything, yet you were completely unaware that you had already forgotten the most important part of your life in the past!

“We’re lucky that the president is here, as his third Element is the Healing Element. He only managed to save his life with his Super Level cultivation. Otherwise, Zhang Xiaohou would have died when the poison was triggered.” The mysterious man glanced at the fainted Zhang Xiaohou with huge relief. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan’s face was twitching. The Black Vatican was so vicious that there was nothing they would not do.

Zhang Xiaohou managed to save his life once with his wisdom, yet little did everyone know, he was already a dead man. If they had not been summoned here because of Fang Gu, he would be a dead man now.

“Mu He, it’s really you!” Mo Fan clenched his fists as his chest heaved in anger.
