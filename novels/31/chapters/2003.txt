Zhao Kang’s group had almost reached the mountain. He frowned after glancing at the Mailong Private Military Group.

“Black Spade, they don’t seem to have suffered great losses,” Zhao Kang told the woman with the Psychic Element.

“There seem to be experts among them. The Liden Royal Family must have spent a fortune on them to acquire the Sacred Lotus,” Black Spade replied.

“Yassen and the others are quite close with the Liden Royal Family, too. If they do find the Sacred Lotus, it’s very likely they will sell it to the Liden Royal Family,” Zhao Kang commented.

“We shouldn’t mess with Senior Hunter Yassen. His team is very strong,” Black Spade said softly.

“Let’s focus on the Mailong Private Military Group then,” Zhao Kang agreed viciously.

“Brother Kang, I don’t understand. Why must we pick on those who serve the Liden Royal Family?” Black Spade was confused.

“Brother Zhao Youqian and Liden’s eldest grandson are close friends. Liden’s eldest grandson asked him to get rid of the mercenaries that were hired by the Liden Royal Family. Once the queen is dead, Brother Zhao Youqian will be able to secure a lot of business opportunities from the Liden Royal Family. Black Spade, have you lived in a royal palace before? After everything is done, I’ll bring you along and let you stay in the palace for half a month so you can enjoy how it feels to be a member of the royal family,” Zhao Kang told her.

Black Spade’s eyes glittered. The palace of a royal family with carpets covered in fresh flowers and valuable ornaments embroidered on the walls... they also had maids serving while they were having breakfast.

“Brother Kang, it’s not that difficult to take out the Mailong Private Military Group, but it’s going to be tricky to take out Yassen and his team... it’s a difficult job, and we’ve lost quite a few men already,” Black Spade told him.

“Don’t you worry, if it doesn’t work out on our end, Brother Zhao Youqian has another plan in mind. Hehehe, Brother Youqian always has a backup plan... it’s just who he is,” Zhao Kang replied with a vicious look in his eyes.

Apas was able to hear every single word of the conversation. She relayed the information to Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

“So the Liden Royal Family is involved... I was wondering why Zhao Youqian would bother sending his men here. It’s not like he needs the loot on Tianshan Mountain for his own business,” Zhao Manyan muttered.

He should have long figured it out. Zhao Youqian had been close to the people in the Liden Royal Family for some time. He had a lot of business in the Middle East, too. Queen Liden’s eldest grandson was definitely a good entry point!

“Zhao Youqian has a backup plan; what would it be?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“Isn’t it obvious? He’s going to kill the woman who’s pregnant with the successor to the throne,” Apas said indifferently.

Zhao Manyan was startled. He did not even realize it, but he trembled when Apas mentioned it.

How insane had Zhao Youqian become?

Sending men to stop the Mailong Private Military Group from acquiring the Sacred Lotus was still acceptable in Zhao Manyan’s eyes. After all, it was never peaceful between factions that were competing with one another. They would use all kinds of dirty tricks to achieve their goals, but it was inhumane to target the mother of the queen’s youngest grandson!

“Your brother is seriously out of his mind!” Mo Fan stated.

“Damn it, the Zhao Family is seriously screwed at this rate! The Heavens know what we did. I can’t believe that Zhao Youqian has managed to wash his hands clean all the time. I should really send him to the most reputable psychiatric hospital in the world as soon as possible!” Zhao Manyan snarled.

“I don’t think he has gone mad. He’s just a little twisted,” Mo Fan commented.

“Who cares whether he’s still thinking straight or not, don’t you know it’s common for the loser of a family or clan’s infighting to be sent to a psychiatric hospital? As long as you behave yourself by eating and sleeping obediently, you can still live comfortably as a useless person. However, if you are up to something, the psychiatric hospitals have instruments that will teach you to behave properly. Do you really think the doctors in the psychiatric hospitals are clueless that you are not normal? You’re just not allowed to live a normal life anymore,” Zhao Manyan informed him.

“...” Mo Fan was left speechless. So that’s how it was in the renowned clans. He had definitely learned a lot!

“Because of that, the psychiatric hospitals charge insane fees. I’ll have to spend over a hundred thousand every year if I send Zhao Youqian to one. Wouldn’t it be better if I used the money to provide for a mistress instead?” Zhao Manyan had to say.

“You think you can send your brother into a psychiatric hospital with your current strength? I believe the psychiatric hospitals suit YOU better,” Mo Fan refuted.

“Being rich doesn’t mean anything.”

“Yeah, being rich doesn’t mean he can hire Forbidden Mages as bodyguards, but he can still invite Forbidden Mages to his functions. I wonder if that old turtle of yours can beat a Forbidden Mage?” Mo Fan challenged him.

Zhao Manyan fell silent, glaring at Zhao Kang and Black Spade for a while, “Those assh****, how dare they mess with the national team? Let’s deal with them first. They even think they can enjoy living in a royal palace. I should send them to Tianshan Mountain’s Lake of Corpses!”

“You’re finally being practical...” MO Fan agreed.

BANG!

The freezing lake ahead exploded. Ice splinters flew at the groups like a rain of swords.

An enormous demon leech with several layers of flesh appeared from the hole. It felt like its body was able to expand infinitely. It went from a dozen meters tall to the height of a skyscraper in a moment, swallowing a bunch of Frosty Ancient Eagles with a single bite!

The Savage Raptor Hunter Group froze as soon as the white demon leech appeared.

“Luc...luckily it wasn’t after us,” a Hunter Master in the group gasped.

“What kind of monster is that!?”

“Everyone, stay calm, don’t provoke it,” Zhao Kang told the others.

Black Spade stepped forward. Her hair floated as her eyes transmitted the energy of a Spirit Ripple to the white demon leech that was hunting the Frosty Ancient Eagles.

“Black Spade, don’t be reckless, you will get its attention,” Zhao Kang told her.

Black Spade did not listen to him. She kept using the Psychic Spell.

“Black Spade, what the f**k are you doing? I told you not to mess with it!...” Zhao Kang yelled.

The demon leech suddenly bent forward and faced the people of the Savage Raptor Hunter Group, as if it had been provoked by the Psychic Spell.

Zhao Kang’s expression shifted.

Black Spade finally managed to recollect herself. She was dumbfounded when the huge creature started focusing its anger at them.

What just happened? What was she doing? Why did she provoke the creature with her Psychic Spell?𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
