On the way to Cairo, everyone started doubting their intelligence when they heard Zhao Manyan speak up. “Since all the flights are canceled, we won’t be able to fly to Cairo, so why did we waste five days in New Suez?” Zhao Manyan wondered aloud, currently sitting on a Camel Beast on the way to Cairo.

Camel Beasts were very common in Egypt, similar to the Gondolas in Venice; a special local transportation. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Unlike the Gondolas, the Camel Beasts were normally used for long journeys. In Egypt, where battles happened more frequently than rain, planes, trains, and highways would frequently come to a standstill. However, the Camel Beasts were different. They could travel anywhere! They could run across wild, mountainous areas or the spacious lands to the east. Still, people traveling on Camel Beasts had to be accompanied by Mages. Their lives would be at risk if they were intercepted by demon creatures.

Camel Beasts were not slow, their speed comparable to a jeep. As a matter of fact, the speed of ground vehicles was nothing worth mentioning to the Mages, but it was very important for them to preserve their energy if possible. They could not afford to waste their energy for travel. Besides, a well-fed Camel Beasts could travel at the speed of a jeep for a whole day; it was unlikely a Mage could keep the same speed!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was a muscular creature, but Mo Fan rarely rode him due to his stamina. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf would have no trouble running for an hour or two, but it would never be able to run for a day and a night!

Thus, they were currently riding Camel Beasts along the Nile. There were a few groups on the way to Cairo, so around forty Camel Beasts were currently traveling across the spacious land, sweeping dust into the air...

Many places in Egypt were extremely open. The deserts felt extremely close, even when they were not far from the Nile. The deserts here were a lot friendlier, unlike the true Sahara Desert. If they accidentally stumbled into an illusion in the Sahara Desert, they would have no chance of making it out alive.

It was Heidi’s first time riding a beast that was racing along at full speed. She surprisingly had a wide smile as her ash-brown hair drifted in the wind. Her posture was elegant and proper. The people that were journeying together enjoyed following behind her so they could admire her great curves...

Unfortunately, Brianca was not around. Otherwise, her mature appearance would surely have added even more color to the journey!

Mo Fan had started to miss Brianca after she left. His impression of her had greatly improved, as she had been acting like a gentle big sister to him. Unfortunately, she had to leave to attend to some matters. Otherwise, the days that Mo Fan no longer had to rely on aphrodisiacs would be just around the corner...

As for Heidi, she might be very beautiful, with skin as tender as jade, but she was acting too full of herself... perhaps she was only behaving like this because he had seen her naked before. It was not fun flirting with her, since she considered him a pervert even when he was discussing a serious topic with her!

“Heidi, I must make it clear first. We have some proper business to attend to in Cairo. You won’t have to follow us around. Feel free to travel around Cairo alone,” Mo Fan said.

“I don’t need you to look after me,” Heidi grunted, as if Mo Fan had poured a bucket of cold water down on her when she was in the middle of enjoying herself.

“I just wanted to remind you first.”

“Are you students? Which school are you from?” an exuberant man with a mustache approached them, continuing, “Allow me to introduce myself! I’m an intern mentor from the Earth School of the European University Institute. Those behind me are my students; we are pleased to meet you!”

“European University Institute?” Heidi looked at the mustached man in surprise.

The man immediately grinned proudly, but he was good at concealing it. It looked more like a modest smile on the surface.

The European University Institute was ranked first in the world. The school had gathered the most brilliant students across all of Europe, thus its students were either grass-root Mages with outstanding talents, or the future pillars of reputable clans. Almost every graduate of the school would end up an authority in Europe somewhere.

The European University Institute’s name was a lot more prestigious compared to the secluded Alps Institute. Even though they were currently in Egypt, its name was still influential. When the mustached man named Vani mentioned his identity, it immediately attracted the attention of the Hunters, Mages, and tourists in the same group.

The European University Institute represented the continent of Europe as a whole, instead of a single country, so it was not invited to participate in the World College Tournament. Similarly, the Alps Institute was an international organization too, so it was also not included in the list of schools participating in the World College Tournament.

Mo Fan had noticed that when he was visiting a school in his country, most people would recognize him with or without him mentioning his name. They immediately recognized the most handsome man in the World College Tournament, but the people from other countries did not really care about him. They even treated him disdainfully when he mentioned he had come in first in the Wold College Tournament. The looks they had clearly stated that Mo Fan would have had no chance of winning the World College Tournament if they took part in it.

Vani did not lack emotional awareness. Even though his target was clearly Heidi, he still greeted Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan in a friendly manner. However, it was obvious that he did not recognize Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan, nor did the students behind him.

“You’re pretty bold to be going to Cairo at a time like this. Where is your teacher?” Vani asked.

“She’s busy, she will regroup with us later,” Heidi said.

“Oh, I’m a qualified teacher too. You can come with us instead. It’s a long journey ahead, and the few of you are going to feel lonely on your own. Wouldn’t it be better if we traveled together?” the man said.

“Oh, sure!” Zhao Manyan replied.

Mo Fan turned around and looked at the betrayer.

The intern mentor most likely had his eyes on Heidi. It was very obvious; Heidi was as gorgeous as an angel materialized from a drawing. Her otherworldly demeanor from spending most of her time cultivating in the Alps was very attractive to others, too.

However, Mo Fan preferred to keep the fertile water in his own field. Despite the awkward relationship between him and Heidi, he did not want someone else to show up and insist on traveling together with the beauty in their group.

“We’re just sharing the resources, take a look at his students...” Zhao Manyan raised his brows, signaling Mo Fan to look at the mentor’s students.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened after a quick glance.

-My my, there are indeed a few beauties among them!-

“Sure, the journey will be a lot more interesting indeed if we travel together,” Mo Fan quickly agreed.

Mu Bai was well aware of what the two were thinking. He could not help but scoff in derision. -Did they really betray Heidi, just like that?-

The two female students from the European University Institute were not as gorgeous as Heidi, but they were still beautiful in their own way. Either way, Mu Bai still thought Heidi was prettier. The gains clearly did not make up for the losses.

“Hi there, I’m Zhao Xiaotian, a student from the Pearl Institute. Are you here to be evaluated for your graduation?” Zhao Manyan promptly went over to chat with one of the girls.

Zhao Manyan was the aggressive kind. He would directly approach any woman he was interested in. He would never chat with an entire group to hide his true intentions.

As a result, before the female student with a huge bust could respond, the male student beside her said disdainfully, “Pearl Institute? Never heard of it before.”

Zhao Manyan continued without even turning his head, “I bet it has been a very boring journey for you to be accompanied by such a narrow-minded guy.”

“You assh***, who are you calling narrow-minded!?” the man grunted.

“Pearl Institute, isn’t that the school that came in first during the World College Tournament?” the girl spoke in turn. She sized Zhao Manyan up again, and realized he was actually quite good-looking.

“Yes, that’s us!” Zhao Manyan nodded.

“We are indeed being evaluated for our graduation,” the girl, Sofia, told him.

“It’s graduating with excellence, to be precise!” the man beside her added.

“Oh, I was in the same spot last year, but our evaluation was a lot simpler than yours. This must be quite special if it requires you to come all the way to Egypt,” Zhao Manyan said.

“How can you compare that little school of yours to our European University Institute?” the man rebutted.

Zhao Manyan automatically filtered away and ignored every word the guy spoke. Sofia was already conversing with him, meaning that he had accomplished the first step.

Zhao Manyan purposely glanced at Mo Fan after he successfully initiated the conversation with the girl. He wanted to check out Mo Fan’s progress. Whenever they started flirting with girls, they would automatically start a bet between themselves to see who would hook up with their target first. The loser would give the winner a broken piece of Soul-grade Seed!

However, Zhao Manyan was utterly shocked when he saw Mo Fan already holding the girl’s hand and fondling her palm!

Impossible!

His cultivation might be weaker than Mo Fan, but how could he possibly lose to Mo Fan when it came to flirting with girls!?

Zhao Manyan’s pride suffered a great blow. He must hurry and reach the second base to turn the tables around and secure the victory!

“This one here is the Life Line, the Fortune Line, the Love Line, and these little wrinkles have their own meanings, too. It means you will encounter some ripples in these areas. Some wrinkles might be favorable for you, but others might be misfortunes. It’s quite inconvenient here. I’ll explain it to you in detail when we find a quieter spot next time,” Mo Fan said.

“Such a magical nation in the east! I assumed these lines didn’t really mean anything for more than twenty years,” the woman said with a natural smile.

“You are from France, right?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes, how do you know?”

“Your name is Zoey, am I right?” Mo Fan added.

“Wow, my god, how did you know?” Zoey stared at Mo Fan in astonishment.

“You are a Scorpius,” Mo Fan kept going.

“This is unbelievable, you are a genius!” Zoey was struggling to believe it.

Zoey was a very cheerful girl. She did not mind Mo Fan flirting with her. She had agreed to let Mo Fan read her palm with a smile, mainly because she was intrigued. However, she now believed that Mo Fan was really good at fortune-telling!

“How did you do it?” Zoey could not help but ask.

“It’s not difficult... you haven’t taken off the badge on your luggage, it’s written all over it,” Mo Fan informed her loftily.

Zoey was stunned for a moment, before giggling and giving Mo Fan a little punch in the chest.
