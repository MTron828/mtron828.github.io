Energy conversion!

Mo Fan had a similar piece of magic Equipment that he had received from Dean Xiao. He did not use it often, but it had always come in handy when it mattered the most.

The Skybound Mages were establishing a magic Formation with similar effects, but they were not transforming the energy of the spells that were attacking them. The Formation was transforming all the energy within its coverage area.

The darkness, flames, and the lightning all turned into rocks after the magic Formation was established.

The rocks were as dense as certain minerals. Many metals might even break after colliding with them.

The magic Formation was accumulating and compressing the Earth Magic. It was not just normal sand and rocks!

Mo Fan’s Sea of Darkness was swiftly transformed into a sea of rocks and sand. The rolling sand was as loud as several hundred waterfalls combined.

The waves of sand swept forward.

The Skybound Mages were targeting Mo Fan’s tower, trying to rescue their comrades who were trapped beneath it.

However, Mo Fan and the Elder of the Shadow Tribe decisively killed four of the Wind Mages before the tower was knocked to the ground.

The waves of sand swept the remaining three Wind Mages away, but it did not matter much, as their souls had sustained severe injuries after the chains were forcibly broken. They were no longer a threat to Mo Fan.

The sand made noises of grass cracking into pieces whenever someone stepped on it.

The sand particles were gritty and sharp. They could easily turn into deadly weapons if a strong wind started spinning them around like a sandstorm.

Mo Fan suddenly felt a strong chill running down his spine. His Dark Vein was throbbing!

Mo Fan turned around and saw a huge hand made of sand heading his way!

Mo Fan turned into a ray of black light and bounced several times to escape the hand.

The strange hand was oddly powerful. It had appeared out of nowhere. Mo Fan would have had a hard time dodging it if the Dark Vein had not warned him in time.

Mo Fan was constantly forced backward. He realized the Skybound Mages were not as weak as he thought. Their mastery of magic Formations was higher than that of most Super Mages.

“Tsk tsk!” the Elder of the Shadow Tribe chuckled.

Mo Fan was relieved. It seemed like the Elder of the Shadow Tribe was about to do something. Mo Fan looked at his shadow.

He noticed the Elder of the Shadow Tribe was holding a dagger in its hand. To his surprise, it suddenly stabbed Mo Fan’s palm with the dagger!

Mo Fan immediately felt a burning pain from his hand!

He was anxious. Was the Elder of the Shadow Tribe trying to show its loyalty to the Lord of Darkness? Why was it attacking him for no reason?

“Stop wasting time and use your strongest ability… are you only going to use it after the enemy beats you up badly? You should use it as soon as possible!” the Elder of the Shadow Tribe said cunningly.

Mo Fan looked at his palm.

Blood was oozing out of the cut. It dripped down onto the sea of sand like a thin red string.

Damn it, couldn’t it let me do it myself?

Other people’s servants from the Shadow Tribe could instantly tear the enemy into pieces, like ferocious tigers. Meanwhile, his Elder of the Shadow Tribe had a problem with its mind.

The blood continued to drip onto the sand. The whole sea of sand reddened when the blood touched it, as if Mo Fan’s Demon Blood had not faded away completely. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The sand started to give off a strong heat.

It felt like a blazing red desert. The Earth Magic seemed to have found its king, and was gathering rapidly toward Mo Fan’s position.

Blood Pact of the Earth!

It was the strongest ability of Mo Fan’s Heaven-grade Earth Seed. Mo Fan had used the same ability to injure the Black Dragon Emperor and wake up his soul!

“It’s stronger than usual, too!” Mo Fan was excited when he saw the blood-red sand.

The sand wrapped around Mo Fan and formed a layer of red armor. Even though Mo Fan did not grow into a giant like he did in his demon form, it was more than enough for him to take out the Skybound Mages.

Blood Pact of the Earth: Heavy Armored Stance!

Mo Fan raised his right hand. The sea of sand became restless again, and?formed into a sword in Mo Fan’s hand. He pointed the sword at the sky.

The rest of the sand hovered above the tip of the sword like a huge sandstorm. Most importantly, the sandstorm was imbued with fire and lightning!

The Sandstorm Sword was now mixed with Mo Fan’s lightning and fire. He looked like a destructive deity in red armor when he stood atop the red sea of sand. The ground and mountains were already cracking apart, while the sky became dark and gloomy even before he swung the sword!

“Great Land Slash!”

The sandstorm had gathered all the sand up. The fine sand particles had become Mo Fan’s deadly weapon, instead of the Skybound Mages’ tool. The ground ruptured into segments as Mo Fan slashed forward. The sandstorm shredded the Skybound Mages who had escaped from the tower in passing. The lightning and fire dealt a serious blow to the rest of the Skybound Mages who were maintaining the magic Formation.

The damage was greater than Mo Fan’s expectations. He felt like he was still in his demon form. The power of the destructive sword could even match the Black Dragon Emperor’s strength!

The Skybound Mages suffered a humiliating defeat beneath Mo Fan’s Great Land Slash. The battle would not have ended so quickly if they had not turned the Sea of Darkness into the sea of sand in the first place.

Mo Fan was almost unbeatable in his Heavy Armored Stance. He was also holding the same shield with fiery lines on it, so he was not afraid of his enemies’ attacks.

He bashed the shield down upon the chief of the Skybound Mages. The sand immediately sank several dozen meters deep in the shape of the shield. The chief was right in the middle of the sunken ground. His face was covered in blood, and his eyes were filled with fear.

It felt like they were doomed to be sacrifices of the battle right from the beginning. The chief of the Skybound Mages turned around and looked at Su Lu in despair.

Su Lu remained silent.

If they were truly able to do anything they pleased just by following Su Lu’s orders, why was Su Lu currently a prisoner of the Lord of Darkness, turned into a mere chess piece for the Lord’s little game?

Even the most powerful kingdom would be taken out for its arrogance, let alone Su Lu, who was nowhere powerful enough to challenge the entire world!
