3051 Holy Shadow Hunt

The silver-gray forest spanned more than one hundred hectares. The violent lake destroyed these silver-gray cedar forests completely, and the Evil Lake Dragon swept thousands of tall cedar trees into its terrifying body.

Mu Ningxue kept a distance from the fangs of the Evil Lake Dragon so that the lake water could not touch her.

She could instantly disappear in this forest and shake off the attack of the Evil Lake Dragon. The reason why she stayed on purpose was to find the caster.

Someone was attacking her in this place.

Judging from the power of that person’s spellcasting, he should have just arrived and had not had time to prepare for a more powerful spell. Otherwise, the large lake she passed by before would turn into an Evil Water Dragon and rush toward her. The submerged forests would be much larger, and the nearby silver-gray mountains would not be spared.

Mu Ningxue sensed a strong magic aura. It came from the end of the lake and river, where there was a highway bridge.

The highway bridge was still far away from Mu Ningxue. From where she stood, she could see several station wagons moving in panic. Apparently, the drivers bumped into this Evil Lake Dragon and fled along the curved white mountain road at high speed.

On the highway bridge, a man wearing a casual sweatshirt stood by the bridge with big and shocking Star Palaces surrounding his body. These palaces composed of Star Sons were brilliant. They made this ordinary-looking man look like the beloved one of nature, who could manipulate everything in nature and use their power!

After locking on to the attacker, Mu Ningxue was about to fight back when a big cage formed by a cyclone suddenly appeared above her head. It shrouded Mu Ningxue and covered the vast primitive forest with cedar trees in the surroundings.

Mu Ningxue looked up and found that the entire sky was twisting, as if trying to swallow all the mountains, forests, lakes, and rocks on the ground.

“A Forbidden Cage?”

Mu Ningxue frowned. Since a Forbidden Curse appeared, this was obviously not a misunderstanding.

Mu Ningxue wondered how those who wanted to kill her knew her position.

No one knew Mu Ningxue had walked out of the Eternal Night. She did not even call or send a message to anyone she knew.

After she left Ushuaia, she traveled to Tinoaia and then to Europe without telling anyone. How did these people know she had left the Extreme South and would pass by here?

“Light Forbidden Curse.”

The sky began to crack. In the cracks, an incandescent light slashed at the world like a blade that could pierce the sky and ground.

In the glaring light, Mu Ningxue noticed that the mountains she passed by were cut open by the light, the lake she loved was divided into turbulent rivers, and the forest ground cracked, revealing rock formations underground. While everything was in a mess, the large lake, which no longer had any place in the area, flooded over, forming various mountain torrents and mudslides.

Mu Ningxue knew clearly that the destroyed area was only a precursor to the true power of the Light Forbidden Curse, and the real target of the light blades falling from the crack in the sky was her.

It was too late for her to escape.

The Forbidden Cage was a terrifying shackle that would lock the human body tightly in the Forbidden Curse area. Unless she cast a spell several times stronger than the Forbidden Curse, she could only die in the Forbidden Curse.

Mu Ningxue’s eyes were clear, and she did not show a trace of panic on her face. She had seen scenes in the Extreme South Land that were even more catastrophic than this. She was still looking for the person who cast the Light Forbidden Curse.

The man in the sweatshirt manipulating the lake on the highway bridge was not the same as the one who released the Forbidden Cage.

Mu Ningxue soon discovered incandescent light wings in the twisting sky, which brought an incredible visual impact like the legendary holy angel. That person with the incandescent wings was calling for the Forbidden Curse to befall on this forest and lake.

The Forbidden Curse had a destructive effect that could not be fixed. Although nature could repair most of the damage caused by humans, the Forbidden Curse left it unable to be repaired. The area would be like a cursed place, and no vitality would be found for decades.

Strangely, Mu Ningxue was angrier that person wanted to destroy this wonderful area than that person wanted to kill her!

Because of the boring and lifeless scenery in the Eternal Night at the Extreme South, Mu Ningxue found such a charming forest lake more fascinating.

“Mu Ningxue, I’ll cut off your hands and feet before giving you a chance to confess your sins to the Holy Shadow willingly!” the man with incandescent wings shouted in the sky.

“Holy Shadow Clark?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“It seems that I have left a deep impression on you.” Holy Shadow Clark smiled

It was difficult for Mu Ningxue to forget. After all, Holy Shadow Clark killed many people in front of her. Those people were compatriots who escorted Mu Ningxue to the Extreme South. Unfortunately, Wei Guang and another woman escaped.

“Who’s on that bridge?” Mu Ningxue pointed to the highway bridge far away.

“My colleague, Holy Shadow Simmons,” Holy Shadow Clark replied without hesitation.

The light blade tore the sky, and more shocking rips appeared in the sky. The giant blade fell to the boundary of the Forbidden Cage, as if it wanted to dig out this silver-gray cedar forest from the world.

Mu Ningxue stood in the terrifying area where the light blade fell and could be torn apart at any moment. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Speaking of which, you really surprised all of us. I can’t help but wonder how you survived the Eternal Night.” Seeing Mu Ningxue, who was like a sitting duck, Holy Shadow Clark was not so anxious.

“Tell me how you found me, and I’ll tell you what you want to know,” said Mu Ningxue.

“Deal.” Holy Shadow Clark was willing to make this small deal. After all, Mu Ningxue’s special ability to not be affected by the ice invasion in the Extreme South was very valuable. The Extreme South was a place that the Forbidden Curse Alliance could not conquer.

Mu Ningxue also needed to know how the Holy Shadow found her.

If the Holy Shadow were powerful enough to find a person in such a big world and predict her itinerary, then Mu Ningxue would not be safe no matter where she went. She had to know how he found her, which would affect every decision she made.

“Have you ever seen such a thing?” Holy Shadow Clark took out the National Institute Badge and showed it to Mu Ningxue from a distance.

He had already found Mu Ningxue and locked her in the Forbidden Cage, so this National Institute Badge was useless to him. It did not matter if he showed it to Mu Ningxue.

Holy Shadow Clark did not mind telling Mu Ningxue one more thing.
