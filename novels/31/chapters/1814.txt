Lingling opened her electronic map and noticed Dawn Island was still marked as a domestication ranch.

that meant the information about the location had not been updated for more than ten years. The Featherless Birds that no one was looking after had taken over Dawn Island and turned it into their breeding ground.

“Trying to establish a private huge-scale domestication ranch is extremely dangerous,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

Jiang Shaoxu’s family had a military background, so she was very familiar with the difficulty of domesticating demon creatures.

If there were any huge-scale domestication ranches in their country, it was most likely the Heavenly Eagles Domestication Program. Other domestication ranches were set up outside the safe zones in case something disastrous happened.

Domesticating demon creatures was an extremely profitable business. After all, there were only a limited number of Summoners in the world, and their Summoned Beasts were their private possessions. Some demon creatures were very suitable as mounts for Battlemages, and for assisting them in battles. However, even the gentlest demon creature would bring a bloodbath to human territories if they were untamed.

The military’s system of domesticating Heavenly Eagles was very developed, yet they still turned against their riders during the invasion of the White Magic Falcons. The soldiers had been forced to kill them all right away. Otherwise, they would have been fighting demon creatures instead!

“Twenty years ago, some leaders of Wanggui Town invested in Dawn Island. They were planning to rely on Dawn Island to develop the town into a reputable city along the east coastline. When the foreign merchant left after the bankruptcy, the government which had greatly supported him faced a financial crisis. They hid the truth to prevent the Councilmen above them from discovering it, and abandoned Dawn Island!” Tangyue informed them.

“These authorities, seriously...” Zhao Manyan felt an urge to curse, yet he withheld after seeing there were so many girls around him.

“Were those officials punished?” Mo Fan asked.

“How do you even punish them? Those officials were not dumb. It has been ten years. They have long been reassigned to somewhere else and continue to ride roughshod over people. Why would they even care about this town’s wellbeing? The new mayor has only been around for two years. He initially thought Dawn Island was just an abandoned island, but when he sent a team to survey it, the whole team was killed. The mayor was utterly dumbfounded!” Tangyue sighed.

“This mayor is very unlucky,” Mo Fan had to say.

The officials of Wanggui Town ten years ago had left such a huge mess. They concealed the truth so it would not affect their careers, and arranged for themselves to be reassigned somewhere else during that period. When new officials came to replace them, they realized the mess had now turned into an island of demon creatures!

The Featherless Birds could easily reproduce many times within ten years. The abandoned ranch was obviously a suitable environment for the creatures. Dawn Island was basically a hotbed for Featherless Birds now. They might just be a bunch of younglings ten years ago, but they were a tribe or a horde now!

“The breed of Featherless Birds that the merchant chose had the highest reproduction and growth rate. Dawn Island was enclosed and rich in resources, allowing the Featherless Birds to form a tribe on their own,” Tangyue went on.

“The real threat that Wanggui Town is facing isn’t the poisonous creature, but these Featherless Birds instead?” Lingling asked. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Tangyue nodded. There were other people in the restaurant, so she had not had the chance to tell them the truth.

“Actually, we discovered the problem around a month ago. Unfortunately, it’s troublesome for the Enforcement Union to handle it on our own. We have no choice but to observe the island for now. The poisonous creature is only a small problem that arose from the mass reproduction of the Featherless Birds. We really should deal with it as soon as possible,” Tangyue said.

“No wonder an elder like you is going after a little poisonous creature. It turns out that Dawn Island is posing such a huge threat to this town,” Mo Fan observed.

“Mm, I have to keep an eye on Dawn Island at all times, but my men can’t even deal with the minor problems. It’s giving me a huge headache!” Tangyue rubbed her temples.

“HAHA, I was wondering why you were so mad!” Mo Fan laughed.

“I already did some investigation. The number of Featherless Birds wasn’t so crazy before the rise of the sea level, but ever since the sea level rose, they have grown at an insane rate, like they were given some kind of growth hormone,” Tangyue said.

“Perhaps the seawater has washed up a certain resource that they were lacking to them,” Lingling said.

“I think so, too. If I can’t resolve it, I’ll have to report it to Zhu Meng,” Tangyue sighed.

Zhu Meng was the Councilman in charge of the Threat-Elimination Strategy. He was the most suitable person to deal with the situation. However, the Enforcement Union was not performing its duty by having the busy Councilman take over something they had failed to handle properly. Tangyue could not figure out any way to resolve the problem. If she still could not think of a better plan in the next couple of weeks, she would have no choice but to report it. She could not drag it out any longer.

That being said, once she reported it, she would be demoted as a result!

Tangyue was not like the officials that purposely hid the truth. She was fine with a demotion. She did not want the Featherless Birds on Dawn Island to keep growing.

“You just became a Vice Chief not long ago. It will be a pity if you are demoted,” Lingling said.

“It’s better than letting the situation go out of control,” Tangyue pointed out.

“We were planning to visit Dawn Island to look for a Seal of the Totem Beasts. It sounds like our plan is stuck because of the issue too.” Lingling glanced at Jiang Shaoxu, who looked quite helpless too.

They had initially tried to stay out of trouble, yet little did they know that Dawn Island was no longer the same place as before. It was already occupied by the Featherless Birds that had failed to be domesticated!

“Miss Tangyue, your problem is my problem. Leave it to us,” Mo Fan said as he patted himself on the chest.

“Thank you, but I don’t think it’s going to be an easy task. I only shared it with you all because I’ve been under great pressure recently. I just want to vent it out. I feel a lot better now,” Tangyue said.

Tangyue soon left, as she had other matters to attend to.

Mo Fan could tell that Tangyue had been bothered by this matter for a long time. Her temper and mental state were obviously affected. Mo Fan was very concerned for her.

After watching Tangyue leave, Jiang Shaoxu nudged Mo Fan and snarled, “Your thoughts are filled with her bust. You gave your promise to look for the Totem Beasts before we set out for the trip, but you’ve completely lost focus after stumbling into her. Is there something between you two?”

“She was my magic instructor back in high school. You had no idea how much I admired her when I first learned magic. I can also guarantee you that every male student of our batch had a wet dream about her. She’s not just a magic instructor to us... As her student, I should help her with her problem!” Mo Fan said righteously.

“Mm, Mo Fan’s is right about that,” Zhao Manyan nodded in agreement.

Zhao Manyan also wanted to have a teacher like her. He would not have to rely on magazines, images, or the computer to satisfy his sexual desires!
