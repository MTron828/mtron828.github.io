A tall figure in a red outfit stood in the waterfall mist. She had an earring upon her left ear, and a voice was coming out of it.

“Executioner Philip is dead,” said a deep voice on the other end.

“Oh, that’s very disappointing!” the red figure replied calmly.

“The thing we wanted is being delivered to the destination.”

“Mmm, well done,” the red figure said.

“Should we send someone else to take out that guy?” the deep voice asked.

“It’s fine, we can’t really touch him for now, let’s wait for another chance,” the red figure replied.

“But his strength has improved a bit too fast. Even Philip failed to take him out. I’m worried that he’s going to grow stronger and become a greater threat to us. After all, he has Double Innate Elements. Once he reaches the Super Level, he will be almost unstoppable,” the deep voice said.

“Don’t worry, I won’t let him live until the Super Level!” Salan answered.

“Your words are a relief, you’re just like Jörmungandr!”

“Jörmungandr? Maybe!”

The Atlantic Ocean seemed bluer than the Pacific. The water was like an ice mirror, clear and reflecting the sky and the white clouds when its surface was calm.

Tinuoaya was the prettiest, most mysterious city of Portugal. It was also the place where the Sea Hunters gathered. Almost every Hunter that was interested in exploring the Atlantic Ocean to search for treasure would gather here. Most of them would also spend all their fortunes here within a single night.

Be it the bars at the beach with lots of glamorous women, the noisy casinos, or the dueling grounds of the Mages, the place had all kinds of unending enjoyment!

It was only afternoon, the gentle sunlight shone down elegantly upon the surface of the ocean. The gentle waves were undulating like the edge of a dress...

A drunk old Mage sat on a wooden path leading off towards the ocean. It was like a wooden bridge, where many people would come at night just to cool off with the sea breeze.

The old Mage’s face blushed as he kept mumbling to his friend, as if he was not satisfied with his friend’s performance when they went out to the sea.

“I already told him, he has to hold the Water Barrier on his hand. If he wasn’t so arrogant and actually listened to me, the Lightning Demon Fish won’t have been able to escape!” the old Mage grumbled.

The man beside him was his comrade. He was middle-aged, with a thick beard. He did not drink much. Trying to comfort his friend, he replied, “But you shouldn’t kick him off the team like that. You know how difficult it is for us to get a team together. We are all here to hunt Sea Monsters for the money, don’t be so hard on yourself.”

The old Mage, Kanter, clenched his teeth furiously. He was about to say something when he saw a huge ivory ship on the water.

He was very drunk, he was able to see multiple ships stacked on top of one another as they slowly approached the city.

“How big is that ship!? I thought Tinuoaya City didn’t allow huge ships to dock at its port?” the man with a beard blurted out.

“Humph! Once I hunt a Commander-level creature, I’ll buy a ship like this too, and invite the ladies in Tinuoaya City on a tour around the Atlantic Ocean with me. Once I return to Tinuoaya City, the population on my ship will have doubled!” The old Mage burst out laughing vulgarly.

The man with a beard clearly knew what the old man meant. He burst out laughing too, and glanced at the fairly imperious-looking ivory ship...

As the huge, ivory ship got closer, the bearded-Mage’s expression stiffened. It felt like his eyes were about to fall out!

“Kanter, that...that isn’t a ship...” the middle-aged Mage said in a shocked voice.

“How is that not a ship? Is there something else that’s this big and can float on the sea in this world? Are you telling me it’s a gigantic sea monster?” Old Kanter said.

“It’s...it’s really not a ship!” The middle-aged Mage raised his voice when he realized that something did not seem right.

A gigantic, ivory creature slowly approached the harbor, gliding across the surface of the sea. Its size was even more shocking than when it first appeared. It felt like it was taking up their entire field of view.

Kanter rubbed his eyes. He slowly became sober as the sea breeze swept his face. He lifted his gaze and stared ahead.

Following his glance, Old Kanter immediately felt his scalp exploding. He fell to the ground from the shock! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Cold sweat poured down like rain. Old Kanter was an experienced Hunter. He was about to rank up to a Hunter Master, but he had never seen anything this terrifying!

A skeleton!

It was not an ivory ship cruising on the water. It was an enormous skeleton being pushed toward the beach by the waves!

The skeleton was perfectly preserved. They could imagine how imperious the creature once was just by looking at its bones. The creature was most likely a Ruler of the ocean!

But now, the creature had turned into a skeleton, like a rubbish bottle, can, or a piece of wood, floating along on the ocean. Even an experienced Mage would be trembling in fear upon seeing it, as the pressure from just looking at the corpse was dumbfounding. Its fierce skull that one had to lift their head to look at, and its enormous bones... Most importantly... how terrifying was the thing that had turned this Ruler of the ocean into a skeleton!?

Some time later, the Mage with a beard finally collected his thoughts and stammered, “I...I...I’ll alert the Alliance...”

“Al...alright!” The old Mage was still sitting on the wooden path. His legs were weak, and he was having trouble standing up.

The giant skeleton looked like it was still alive. The old Mage had roamed the ocean for many years, yet he had never heard of such a shocking creature...

As the two Mages were overwhelmed by shock, a plane in the sky above them slowly landed at the seashore city of Tinuoaya.

Up on the plane, Mo Fan was seated at the window, and happened to be glancing down at the beautiful city when he caught a glimpse of the sight.

“What are you looking at?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“There’s a strange, white ship down there. It feels too big to dock at the port,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s normal for a ship.”

“I just feel like it’s surprisingly big.”

“I’ve seen bigger ships before. The ships at a small city like this are nothing to be surprised about,” Zhao Manyan said proudly.
