Chapter 2880: Reassemble and Trample

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

People were surprised.

It was not a brilliance that an ordinary Mage could radiate. A red sun seemed to have fallen and dyed the river red. Even the Ocean Demons, on the other side of the river, were stunned.

The divine fire was getting more intense and formed a magnificent soul shadow comparable to a god behind Mo Fan’s tiny back. The Divine Flaming Snake King followed Mo Fan and moved forward majestically. Its terrifying divine fire and divine body rushed toward the demons on the other side of the river.

The demons had trampled on ashes, dust, ruins, and flowery skyscrapers. As Mo Fan stepped on the shore, the ashes, dust, and ruins fluttered like yellow sand. They rearranged, recondensed, and recast over Lu Family’s Mouth. Soon, a golden palace made of sand appeared in that spot. It was spectacular and unbelievable, like an incredible mirage.

However, the golden sand palace was not an illusion. It floated in the sky and moved synchronously with Mo Fan.

The Kingdom of Sand in the air was not a real place, it was the huge Earth Element power contained in Mo Fan’s demon bloodline. When Mo Fan did not need it, it became a palace and floated in the air.

The demons rushed forward, and a dozen giant Ocean Beasts blocked Mo Fan’s way. The Cold Moon Demon Lord had controlled them, so they could not sense danger.

Mo Fan looked at the Kingdom of Sand in the air and slowly raised his hand. The golden Kingdom of Sand Palace instantly transformed into an Ash Sword.

The sword was comparable to the Oriental Pearl Tower, but it was in Mo Fan’s hand this time.

“Die!” The Ash Sword immediately slashed down.

The Ash Sword of the Kingdom of Sand had divided the overflowing sea water, vast land, and infinite demons into two.

It was almost as if the Ash Sword had divided a deep black river. The river was parallel to the Huangpu River and converged on the Bund!

Most people who gathered on the riverbank were Super Level Mages, but they could not believe what they saw.

‘Was that person really the Mo Fan they knew? How did his power instantly surpass all the powerful demons? How could the Earth Element magic he cast achieve such a shocking effect?’

“Even an Earth Element Forbidden Mage couldn’t do that.” The Fire God of the Forbidden Curse Association was shocked.

“Dean Xiao, your student is… ” President Hong Wu said eagerly.

Although Dean Xiao knew Mo Fan had this ability, this was his first time seeing it in reality. The Demon Element was a research area that the Magic Association had abolished. The experimental subjects had all become demons and monsters with infinite power, short lifespans, and always caused trouble.

However, Mo Fan did not have these traits, as if the demon’s power was born within him. He was neither devoured nor manipulated by the demons but gained their powers instead.

Dean Xiao could not answer President Hong Wu. Now that the Magic City had the Azure Dragon, five Sacred Totem Beast, and a real demon to protect this precarious territory, people could finally stop despairing.

When Mo Fan killed King Skeleton in the past, many Mages in the Magic City had acknowledged him. It was even more shocking now that he had crossed the river alone and shown his demon form to others.

It turned out that the power of a person might be able to make a difference!

…

The deep black river was full of the corpses of the demons, and it took some time for the water to fill the river.

The Ash Sword disintegrated into countless minute ash particles and condensed into larger golden stones.

The stones were like armor, and they gathered in front of Mo Fan. At first, it formed a big yellow sand armor. Then, it slowly became an ancient warrior that stood among the demons.

This Yellow Sand Giant Warrior stepped forward in step with Mo Fan.

However, Mo Fan’s speed was faster than the Yellow Sand Giant’s. When the demons gathered, Mo Fan’s small figure overlapped with the Yellow Sand Giant.

“The earth equipment of the Kingdom of Sand!”

Unlike Dubai, Magic City did not have deserts. However, the city had countless ruins of buildings destroyed by the demons.

Every stone, every inch of soil, and every tile at the ruins had turned into the power of Mo Fan’s Kingdom of Sand. The ruins in the Magic City had been summoned by the earth and reassembled to fuel its power.

The reassembled demon that walked in the ruins of the city could even compete with the Black Dragon. The ocean overlords, rulers, and heroes in front of them became weak and vulnerable and died under Mo Fan’s attacks.

Mo Fan wore the earth equipment and threw the Ash Sword far away to a quagmire filled with Undead and Ocean Demons.

The sword was as straight as a skyscraper. The sword trembled slightly, and the blazing sand suddenly swept in all directions. The yellow shock waves of hundreds of meters high swallowed countless evil spirits like a sandstorm.

Sandstorm Sword!

The attack made the area full of demons an empty and barren land. Mo Fan’s reassembled body, which was five or six kilometers away, suddenly crumbled into dust.

The sands and dust surrounded the upright sword, and a powerful arm quickly condensed at the hilt.

More sand and dust assembled to form arms, shoulders, chest, and head. A tall figure appeared where the sword was. Mo Fan, who had reassembled with the sand and dust, towered as if the Ash Sword was his real soul.

On the other side of the river was the nest of demons. The place was full of demons, and it was difficult for Forbidden Mages to move.

Helping the Azure Dragon was supposedly an impossible task, but Mo Fan had already crossed nearly ten kilometers.

He was getting closer to the Azure Dragon.

The Azure Dragon was indeed huge. Even though the Undead Army was as huge and boundless as the red desert, the Azure Dragon was like a lonely blue mountain among them. Its claws, tail, and body were killing evil spirits without a stop.

The Azure Dragon turned around and saw Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was in the terrifying quagmire formed by the evil spirit armies. However, he walked forward even then.

The Azure Dragon roared angrily. Tens and thousands of undead were shaken into the sky like rain.

“Little Loach, here I come!”
