Chapter 2160: Strange Ice Spell

Translated by XephiZ

“How naive of you to be using the Fire Element against me!” Secretary Richard sneered, pointing at Mo Fan.

Secretary Richard took a step forward. He suddenly raised his right foot when he was around two hundred meters away from Mo Fan. He kept his foot in the air for more than a second, like he was accumulating his power.

He glared at Mo Fan like he was an ant under his foot before stomping down on the ground!

Mo Fan thought Secretary Richard was going to use an Earth Spell and was going to cause an earthquake with that stomp, but the ground did not shake, nor were there any terrifying cracks. He felt a strange iciness above him instead!

“Holy crap!”

Mo Fan looked up and saw a boot made of thick ice plunging down at him. From Mo Fan’s angle, he felt like he was currently under a huge falling iceberg!

Luckily, Mo Fan had already spread the aura of the Dark Vein beforehand, allowing him to move around freely with the Fleeing Shadow.

Mo Fan sank into the ground and turned into a shadow sparrow, gliding easily to the other side of the training ground.

BANG!

A boot of ice bigger than a building landed at the center of the training ground, like the crushing stomp of a Tyrant Titan.

Mo Fan was not really prepared for it, as he had no idea what special abilities Secretary Richard had. Luckily, the Shadow Element was one of Mo Fan’s trump cards. Otherwise, he would have had no chance of escaping in such a short time.

The ice boot appeared very quickly, and fell to the ground even faster. It was different from the Advanced Ice Spell Icebound Coffin, which would fall from a great height, giving its target some time to react. The ice boot had been right above Mo Fan’s head. It was strange and frightening!

“Do you think you are unbeatable after defeating the Steel Mountain Tyrant Titan? How naive of you!” Secretary Richard shouted disdainfully.

He pulled his right arm back as he was talking.

He clenched his fist and accumulated his strength for around a second. An icy flow of energy began spiraling around his arm.

Secretary Richard threw his right fist at Mo Fan!

They were around three hundred meters apart. There was no sign of Elemental Energy on Secretary Richard’s fist except for the strange swirling flow of icy energy, but when he threw a punch at Mo Fan, an ice fist the size of a building appeared in front of him!

It was a fist made of sturdy ice the size of a building, yet Mo Fan could not even see its path until it appeared in front of him!

BANG!

Mo Fan formed a wall with his Will despite his astonishment, shielding himself from the ice fist that had come out of nowhere.

The Wall of Will was Mo Fan’s fastest defensive move. The Circle of Crystal Teeth was only effective once there were a certain number of Shards built up.

Mo Fan’s Wall of Will was already quite strong when he fought Zu Xiangtian in their duel, but Secretary Richard’s ice fist was shockingly powerful. Not only did it smash through Mo Fan’s defense, it also knocked him a great distance away.

Mo Fan had to use the Earth Element to keep himself on the ground. However, the strike had sent him sliding like he was skiing on ice. He finally stopped as he reached the entrance of the military academy.

Mo Fan’s arm was a little numb. He looked at his hands and chest, which were now covered in ice. A strong chill was penetrating his bones!

“I tried to ask you to leave, but you wouldn’t listen! You’re forcing me to do it the hard way!” Secretary Richard jeered him.

“Secretary, you are truly impressive. You must teach that kid a lesson!” Babbitt exclaimed in joy. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Babbitt had already warned Mo Fan he was going to regret it. The person he was seeking shelter from was one of the strongest people in Crete!

The Black Ornaments were not just messing around. Politicians, the military, and powerful Mages were willing to step forward to protect him. This was the true power of the Guild of the Wicked!

“What did you do to provoke such an annoying guy?” Secretary Richardson demanded of him.

“I...I’m not too sure either!”

“Forget it, I’ll take care of him first. We should clean this mess before the Parthenon Temple shows up. Otherwise, it will be troublesome to kill him!” Secretary Richard muttered.

“Yeah, we should take care of him as soon as possible, just like how we-”

“Shut your mouth!” Secretary Richard did not waste any more time talking to Babbitt. He moved to the center of the training ground, heading toward Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was staring at Secretary Richard, struggling to see through his attacks. His magic seemed different from that of other people.

However, it was not much of a surprise to him. Every Mage would have their unique abilities upon reaching the Super Level once they had a better control of their magic. The Secretary was clearly different from those who had only achieved the Super Level recently, and had obviously been at the Super Level for a long time, learning a unique way of using his spells.

“What is it? Are you confused by my power?” Secretary Richard grinned, approaching Mo Fan with his hands clasped behind him.

He spoke with authority while showing his power, like he was teaching a disobedient rookie a lesson, “I already knew you were just a kid in the Super Level when you used your first spell. Star Orbits, Star Patterns, Star Constellations, and Star Palaces... they are simply drawing a dipper with a gourd as the model. Your spells might have changed a little, but I can still see the framework of textbooks from them. Mages of my level are extremely familiar with our spells. You are no different from a frog under the well if you think you can beat me with your petty tricks!”

Secretary Richard did not give Mo Fan any time to catch his breath even as he was mocking him. Mo Fan had already noticed the same strange flow circling his elbow.

An elbow strike!

Secretary Richard attacked Mo Fan from around the same distance of two hundred-some meters!

Mo Fan was well-prepared this time. He constructed a silver Star Constellation and Blinked right up next to Secretary Richard.

Mo Fan had decided to attack!

“Do you think I can’t sense those energy ripples? Idiot!” Secretary Richard scoffed.

Mo Fan was about to make his move when he saw another ice elbow flying at him from the side!
