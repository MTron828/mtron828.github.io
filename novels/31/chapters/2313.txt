Chapter 2316: Temporary Withdrawal

Translated by XephiZ

“You don’t have to wear a disguise anymore, captain,” Lt. Colonel Mason said, blocking Mo Fan’s path.

Mo Fan frowned and stared grimly at the guy.

“I’m not an idiot. I can tell that you are far stronger than a normal soldier of the Federation Army,” Mason huffed.

“I think everyone can see that as long as they are not blind,” Mo Fan replied.

“Who exactly are you?” Mason demanded nervously.

Mo Fan did not expect Mason to ask him the question right now. He might be a little slow, but he was not a complete retard.

Mason had provided them with a great cover. The conductor and Wolf Chief had yet to find them again.

However, Mason should have realized something by now, after Mo Fan and the others kept revealing their strength.

“I can guess it even if you don’t say. You said that you were students of the Aorus Sacred Institute’s branch. It’s impossible to forge the badge,” Mason finally deduced.

“Just say what’s on your mind,” Mo Fan said impatiently.

“People have been saying that the Federation has obtained the Aorus Sacred Institute’s support, so some of its students must have joined the war,” Mason went on.

Mo Fan was a little surprised. He did not think Mason would figure it out.

It was true that they had joined the army on behalf of the Aorus Sacred Institute, at least on the surface.

“Therefore, you are not from its branch, but the main campus of the Aorus Sacred Institute, am I right?” Mason said confidently.

Only the students of the Aorus Sacred Institute’s main campus would possess such strength!

“I always thought you looked like a black chimpanzee even though your intelligence is nowhere close to one, but it turns out that isn’t the case,” Mo Fan answered.

“HAHAHA! I’ve guessed right!” Mason burst out laughing.

“Take the Windstorm Shaman’s head back to our base. Tell them you killed him,” Mo Fan said.

Since Mason already knew the truth, there was no point for Mo Fan to keep hiding his identity.

“The Brown Rebels will send someone stronger to deal with us,” Mason warned him.

“It’s fine, they are all going to die anyway,” Mo Fan declared grimly.

“That’s exactly what I want to hear!” Mason had a lot of faith in Mo Fan.

Mo Fan looked into the distance and saw the watchtower that had been Summoning the fierce tornadoes had already collapsed.

Zhao Manyan had done a great job leading the remaining two hundred Savage Bull Riders to accomplish his mission.

“By the way, what did you offer to the gods? Do you really tie the Hillmen to trees at the foot of the Andes Mountain Range?” Mason asked Mo Fan. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“What do you mean?” Mo Fan was confused.

“I heard the Aorus Sacred Institute has a secret magic that can Summon the spirits of the gods to be Possessed by them. Their famous Shamans can use magic similar to being Possessed by Insect Gods to strengthen their flesh. Didn’t you get your power from Forneus? Otherwise, how could you Summon such a powerful Commander-level Wolf Beast with your Dimensional Summoning?” Mason asked him.

Mason’s voice gradually fell off when he saw the strange expression on Mo Fan’s face.

How should he describe it? It was like Mo Fan had swallowed a bomb, yet it did not explode.

“Screw your gods, can you stop bringing up gods all the time? It’s f**king annoying!” Mo Fan yelled at him, completely fed up now.

——

Mo Fan and Mason left the battlefield. Zhao Manyan and the Savage Bull Riders returned at the same time.

A series of deafening noises suddenly erupted. The woods and the swamps were shaking vigorously.

“The Crusaders are pushing forward. It looks like we’ve won the battle on the outskirts!” Lt. Colonel Mason blurted out in excitement.

Since they had won the battle, he would be rewarded again, especially since he was still holding the head of the Brown’s General Zonah!

Soldiers in blue military uniforms marched past them. They had such great numbers that they were moving past the area like two endless streams.

They were crossing the battlefield, intending to confront the enemy around three kilometers away from the woods.

Lt. Colonel Mason’s regiment of volunteer Mages and Savage Bull Riders had suffered great casualties, but they had accomplished their mission. The assault phase was over. It was time for them to withdraw from the battlefield and treat the wounded.

——-

When they withdrew from the battlefield, the proud regiment of a thousand volunteer Mages and four hundred Savage Bull Riders only had around two hundred Mages and two hundred Riders left. There were less than five hundred people left!

“Did the guy with the nose stud make it?” Mo Fan asked after looking around.

“He died under a watchtower. His remains were too squashed, so we couldn’t bring them back. I do have his nose piercing. Do you want it?” one of the soldiers spoke up.

“Oh, bury it under the ground. I was just asking,” Mo Fan waved it away.

The man with the nose stud, Lieutenant Cory, was not that strong, only a tier-three Basic Mage.

The chances of survival for someone like him was extremely low. Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai might have outstanding strength, but it was impossible for them to look after everyone amid the chaos.

The soldiers’ lives were in the hands of the Heavens!

Captain Benson had survived. He recovered rapidly after Mu Bai treated him with his insects.

“Colonel Mason, remember to share the merits with the captain. He almost died,” Mo Fan reminded him.

“Of course, I won’t hog it!” Lt. Colonel Mason patted his chest.

The two armies were still fighting. It would be stupid to ask for a reward for the time being. Mason had to wait until the battle ended.

——

The sky darkened, but the rain was still pouring down heavily.

The magic blasts in the distance never stopped. Their lights flickered in the sky above the woods like fireworks, colorful and dazzling.

“What are you all doing here? Don’t you know we are short on men at the front line?” a man in a general’s uniform yelled as he stalked past the tents.

Lt. Colonel Mason was shocked. He did not expect to see a general here!

“General, we just came back from the front line after the assault! We are treating the injured and recovering our energy!” Mason declared.

“Assault? Which regiment are you from?” the general asked.

“The regiment with volunteer Mages and the Savage Bull Riders I’m in charge of! I’m Lt. Colonel Mason!” Mason straightened his back.

“Oh, it’s you… Well done!” the general said after a brief pause.

The general went to the next set of tents. They belonged to another assault regiment that had also suffered heavy casualties.

However, the general forced the soldiers who had just returned to go back to the front line immediately!
