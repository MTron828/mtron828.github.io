Somewhere among the debris, Councilman Zhu Meng stared at the Black Totem Snake in disbelief. For many years, he had been trying to eliminate this ‘threat’ from Hangzhou, yet to his surprise, the Black Totem Snake was the one protecting the city in a pinch.

He finally understood why the Totem Tribe had worshiped him like a god. The astonishing strength he had displayed was indeed like a guardian of the city. It was totally unbelievable!

The White Magic Falcons were unable to break through the poisonous barrier, and the Silver Skyruler was so beaten up that it remained outside of the city, not daring to trespass any further. Despite both being Ruler-level, the Black Totem Snake was clearly stronger than the Silver Skyruler.

A highway extended from the city west into the distance. It continued beyond the valley and onward to other cities inland. The Silver Skyruler finally rose to a height of over a few hundred meters, but the Black Totem Snake could easily reach him by straightening his body.

The Black Totem Snake stood a few kilometers away from the Silver Skyruler. He had let the demon beast fly back into the sky. His eyes were staring at it coldly.

The Silver Skyruler was now a thousand meters up. Its speed of ascent was fairly impressive. It could finally return to a height where it could fully unleash its power.

The Black Totem Snake was still on the ground, but his silhouette became blurry, like a reflection on the surface of water which became faint under the presence of a ripple.

He had disappeared!

His gigantic figure had vanished into thin air!

The Silver Skyruler kept an eye out at the Black Totem Snake’s movement as it was rising into the sky. It was rather intimidated by the giant snake. His disappearance did not bring any comfort to it.

As it thought, a black mist suddenly appeared above the demon beast out of nowhere, with the Black Totem Snake inside it!

He could easily move between places with the mist, as if he were swimming freely in the ocean!

The snake was moving in a circular motion with a wide radius, leaving a trail of black mist along the path he took.

The trail was huge enough to cover the entire area within one kilometer of the Silver Skyruler. The outline had markings, runes, and ancient symbols densely covering its surface. From afar, it resembled a pattern full of trigrams looming above the Silver Skyruler!

The illusionary outline began to materialize into numerous stone tablets!

Each of the stone tablets was ten meters long. They held the markings, runes, and symbols from before. The previously glowing Totem Pattern had transformed into a stunning imprint in the sky!

The imprint fell rapidly from the layer of clouds to the space between the sky and the ground. It was extremely striking, and even people at a great distance could still see it clearly.

The imprint struck the Silver Skyruler’s back accurately, like a meteor that had accidentally dropped from the Heaven to the mundane world. The power it contained was unbelievable!

The Silver Skyruler slammed back into the ground. The imprint was strengthened with powerful Earth Element Magic. Its size was already shocking, but the Earth Element Magic had further multiplied its weight!

The ground sank down in a circular shape!

A great pit formed in between two sections of the highway. The road was stained with the Silver Skyruler’s blood.

The demon bird was pressed down to the bottom of the pit!

The Black Totem Snake did not give the Silver Skyruler a chance to fly into the sky. He had actually planned to suppress it to the ground!

“Such a remarkable skill, is this a totem beast’s special attack?” asked Mo Fan with astonishment, staring at the deep pit from atop the Black Totem Snake’s head.

No wonder Tangyue was so confident that the Councilmen would stand no chance against the Black Totem Snake after he was done with his ecdysis. His strength was enough to place him at the apex of the biotic pyramid of the world. With such a totem beast looking after Hangzhou City, who would dare threaten it?

The imprint finally broke into pieces in the pit. The Silver Skyruler climbed out from the pit in a devastated state. Its head, back, and wings were covered in blood. Even many of its sturdy feathers had fallen off. Half of the feathers were destroyed by Councilman Zhu Meng’s bold move. After fighting against the Black Totem Snake that was stronger than it, it was badly injured with cuts and bruises all over its body!

Many people in the city saw the Silver Skyruler’s miserable appearance.

The people were shocked and afraid of the army of white demon birds for a very long time. When they saw their ruler, the Silver Skyruler, suffering severe injuries, they could not help but cheer loudly.

“He is indeed protecting us. The Skyscraping Snake is protecting us!” someone in the city yelled.

“That’s right, we’ve accused him falsely!” said an old man who had witnessed how the Black Totem Snake was being tortured at West Lake.

Back then, the old man and the rest of the crowd had acknowledged Councilman Zhu Meng’s proposal to eliminate the threat of the city. Now, they all realized how stupid they were. If Councilman Zhu Meng had happened to execute the snake, they would most likely be dying at the claws of the White Magic Falcons now.

Tangyue, who was protecting the civilians, glanced at the Black Totem Snake excitedly. Her eyes were filled with tears.

He did not cause the plague, nor did he kill a single human. He might be gigantic, and his powerful presence might be terrifying to a lot of people, but he had hidden under West Lake and secretly protected the city.

The Black Totem Snake had proven himself, and the humans had altered their view of him. This was the best outcome she could hope for!

——

It was obvious that the morale of the army of White Magic Falcons was falling dramatically. The demon beasts knew they had no chance of breaking through the poisonous barrier, thus they were unwilling to continue sacrificing themselves in vain. The corpses of White Magic Falcons had stacked up in piles, resulting in a spectacular scene.

The heavily injured Silver Skyruler no longer dared to invade the city, despite how furious it was. It let out a cry, ordering the army of White Magic Falcons to escort it away.

It soared into the sky and headed west...

“Is it running away?” asked Lingling.

“Of course, its pawns could not even get close to the Black Totem Snake, and the battle with the Black Totem Snake was so one-sided. What else could it do, apart from running away?” replied Mo Fan.
