Chapter 2754: The Green East Sea God And The Black Phoenix

“Most dazzling star ever in Historical Long River, my foot! I’ll burn the Licheng Afterglow Island for three days and three nights consecutively so that your future generations will always remember this.”

“You don’t bother to help each other in times of crisis. This will only make you a bunch of dirty rats even if you stay alive. You’re expecting your future generations to bring glory to you, huh? You must be kidding me! You’re all a bunch of wicked people who refuse to repent from your ways. Your future generation will end up as rotten as you anyway.”

Mo Fan was floating above the lava waterfall. His Chongming Divine Fire was a great Heaven Seed that could burn everything in its path, even make liquids evaporate.

The Wooden Armor Tree Man stood in the middle of the flying lava and burned quickly. The seemingly strong wooden armor soon turned into ordinary black charcoal.

The bizarre tails protected the Wooden Armor Tree Man’s chest area where Grandpa Queyi was seated. But the hot lava was gradually burning those tails, too.

“Taste my lightning fire!” Mo Fan said viciously.

The fusion gloves appeared on Mo Fan’s hand. On the first half of the punching gloves were two distinctly different Elements. When Mo Fan held these two in his hand, his Lightning and Fire Elements fused together. The power grew as Mo Fan continued rubbing his palms.

“Now I shall deliver God’s condemnation on you!”

Mo Fan fused his Lightning and Fire Elements together. There was a change of color in heaven and earth. Mo Fan set a clear boundary with his figure. Half of the sky behind him had transformed into a purple color, while the other half turned red.

The purple and red sky gradually fused to form an enormous celestial diagram, covering the sky above Licheng Afterglow Island.

Mo Fan’s Fire Element had a great Heaven Seed, and the level of cultivation was at the second grade of the Super Level.

Even though his Lightning Element did not have a Heaven Seed, the Blessing of the God’s Seal and Darkness Source had pushed the power of the Lightning Tyrant to the level of a Heaven Seed, multiplying the effect of mortal lightning by a massive amount!

The increase in power of a Heaven Seed was more than tenfold than that of a Mortal Seed.

......

The Lightning Tyrant was a Soul Seed. Although it did not have the additional effects of the heaven-level or the Absolute Forbidden Realm and other strengthening fields, its direct destructive power was equivalent to that of heaven-level lightning. Moreover, Mo Fan had achieved the third grade of the Super Level in his Lightning Element.

Right then, he fused his Lightning Element with the Chongming Divine Fire all while possessing the Darkness Source. He wondered what kind of destructive power would come out of the fusion of the two.

It was not an exaggeration for Mo Fan to call it God’s condemnation. He believed his super destructive power was almost on par with the lightning pillar that had nearly destroyed the entire city.

Mo Fan roared. He had finished accumulating power for the Tyrant Divine Fire Diagram. Thousands of purple-red lightning and firestorms befell the island. The sight was terrifyingly beautiful and destructive.

Meanwhile, even though Grandpa Queyi was covered in wooden armor, he could not evade the lightning firestorm. Mo Fan’s Tyrant Divine Fire Diagram was enormous. If not for Grandpa Queyi blocking the lightning firestorm, it would have crushed the entire mountain villa!

But Grandpa Queyi could not hold back the lightning firestorm forever. The soil, mountains, and rocks surrounding him were evaporating. Although his Magical Wooden Armor was as broad as a mountain, it was burning in the lightning firestorm.His bizarre tails had turned into ash before he could use their power.

Grandpa Queyi fell in a cloud of ash and dust. He looked up in disbelief at the tiny figure in the sky.

The tiny figure was glowing as bright as a sun and exuded an imposing aura. Grandpa Queyi, on the other hand, had been an ignorant fly who struggled up the sky because he thought he could fight against Mo Fan.

Grandpa Queyi suffered in agony and was humiliated. He even found it hard to help himself up. He had never expected such a young outsider to overthrow the entire Licheng Licheng Afterglow Island in an instant. He felt it had been worthless to guard the Underground Holy Spring for generations if they couldn’t even fight against one outsider. What was the point of treating the Underground Holy Spring as the most supreme of all spiritual treasures if they were so easily defeated by a lone man?

“God’s condemnation…”

“Is it true that God is condemning the island?”

“He is God’s condemnation. He defeated all the elders by himself…”

The islanders stared at the once beautiful forest that had been burnt beyond recognition.

Not long ago, Licheng Afterglow Island had been as gorgeous and holy as a paradise. But the island was now devoured by a blazing fire and the earth was filled with charcoal. They were aware that Mo Fan had no intention of slaughtering all the people on the island. Otherwise, Mo Fan would have cast his terrifying spells to wipe them out long ago.

Licheng Afterglow Island was gone. The hidden clan on the island had perished. Ruan Feiyan, Shu Xiaohua, Du Mei, Pu Ling, and the rest were in tears. Their pride had been crushed.

They grew up on the island and rarely interacted with anyone from outside. They had lived here their whole lives. They had never even thought that perhaps they were the ignorant ones.

What they had been told was fake. Licheng Afterglow Island was not superior. Even when they had owned and used the Underground Holy Spring for so long and lived in such lush land, they were weak when compared to the outsiders.

…

Soon, Little Flame Belle finished her war with the other elders. Although seven elders worked hand-in-hand to fight Little Flame Belle, they were no match for her. They were all burned and bruised.

Just like Mo Fan, Little Flame Belle had shown mercy and spared their lives.

“Don’t worry, we still have the Green East Sea God. He can’t possibly defeat it,” Seventh Granny said ruthlessly.

The moment she brought up the Green East Sea God, the elders felt a gleam of home where there was only despair.

Licheng Afterglow Island was not a place where Mo Fan could do as he pleased! Even if what he said was true and this was just a bubble, they preferred to live inside their own dream bubble, unbothered by anyone else!

“Green East Sea God! Green East Sea God!” Grandpa Queyi shouted at the top of his lungs. He lay paralyzed on the ground.

A domineering eagle’s cry rang throughout the sky in the direction of Licheng Afterglow Island. Its voice echoed across the island, reigniting the islanders’ hope and fighting spirit.

“Mo Fan, call Little Flame Belle back,” Apas’s expression changed.

She then quickly returned to Mo Fan’s side. Mo Fan had to face the Green East Sea God in the form of Flame Demon King.

Even so, Mo Fan might not win the fight. Even if the Green East Sea God was not a supreme ruler, it was at the same level as Black Totem Snake and Mountain Zombie. Mo Fan sucked in a deep breath. He cast a glance at the people whose confidence had been completely crushed.

He noticed something. There were only eight elders in front of him. One granny was missing.

Strong wind blew. The Green East Sea God with lightning chains appeared. Mo Fan stood on top of the bare mountain and watched it appar. A woman was standing on the Green East Sea God’s massive wing bow.

She wore black conical hat, black slanted placket crop top, black headscarf, and black long pants. She radiated an icy-cold aura in elegance. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
