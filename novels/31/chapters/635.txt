“I’m not entirely sure, but I think someone else is watching Hua Village apart from the people of the Black Vatican. It’s the reason why they didn’t get too aggressive on me. Otherwise, I would have been dead now,” Zhang Xiaohou admitted sternly.

Mo Fan was stunned, he immediately looked at Liu Ru.

Liu Ru softly nodded and said, “It must be the same person who gave me the blood serums.”

“Then you’ve made the right choice to pretend that you were suffering from amnesia. The Black Vatican would have to send out Blue Deacons to kill you, but since the plan related to the rain is their first priority, the Blue Deacons would not show up so easily, as they had to be even more cautious...” Mo Fan nodded.

That being said, Mo Fan almost broke into a sweat after reevaluating the situation.

Mo Fan did speculate that Zhang Xiaohou was putting up an act as a disguise, but he never thought so many people were actually watching him!

“So what did you see?” Su Xiaoluo finally ran out of patience.

Now that they had gotten rid of the spy Hong Jun, Zhang Xiaohou could finally tell them the truth.

“Mm, what did you see?” Mo Fan’s voice sank.

Zhang Xiaohou had endured such hardships just to protect the information. It must be extremely important, and might be related to this huge conspiracy looming over the city!

“He was wearing a mask, I couldn’t recognize him, but the people of Black Vatican called him Great Deacon Hu Jin,” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“Great Deacon Hu Jin?” Mo Fan was confused.

“He’s in charge of all the Blue Deacons of Black Vatican, Salan’s right-hand man. He must have played an extremely important role in this conspiracy...” Fang Gu slowly walked out from the shadows and glanced at the trembling villagers coldly.

“How do you know?” asked Liu Ru.

“I had contact with the Black Vatican before. I purposely left one of their people alive, to learn who was trying to hunt me down. The man was a tough one, so I had no choice but to threaten him with the Undeath, forcing him to spill the beans,” replied Fang Gu.

“But the Black Vatican is very strict about keeping their identities a secret. If that woman was still alive, we might be able to learn more information,” said Liu Ru.

“Forget it, for something as huge as this, the Blue Deacons are only in charge of a small part of the whole thing. They won’t know the details. If we really want to know what their next move is, we’ll have to find this Great Deacon Hu Jin,” said Fang Gu confidently.

“Houzi, why were they trying to kill you? You didn’t even see his face,” said Mo Fan in confusion.

“I heard his voice, and somehow it felt slightly familiar, but I can’t remember who the person is...” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“Familiar?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty sure that I’ve heard the voice in Bo City. It was raining quite heavily that day, but if I can surely identify the person if I can hear his voice again!” said Zhang Xiaohou in a serious tone.

Mo Fan frowned as his breathing intensified.

It turned out that someone from the Black Vatican was right around them!

“I believe he knows me, too. He must be worried that I would recognize his voice, thus he immediately sent his men to silence me. Even after I reached Hua Village, he still asked Hong Jun to spy on me. If I did something that would pose the slightest threat of revealing his identity, he would eliminate me and the people around me at once...” said Zhang Xiaohou.

“So you’ve pretended to stay with me like a retard, just so the spy wouldn’t feel suspicious?” said Su Xiaoluo.

“Well... that’s not it,” Zhang Xiaohou’s face blushed.

“What is it then?” Su Xiaoluo pursued further.

“To repay your kindness for saving his life! We’ll talk about the romance between you two later. Houzi, can’t you remember whose voice it was? If we can learn his identity... you mentioned that he’s from Bo City?” blurted out Mo Fan.

“Yeah, he must be someone from Bo City. Maybe he’s someone we both saw before,” said Zhang Xiaohou confidently.

“But, there were many people that were allocated here to the Ancient Capital. How can we find this Great Deacon Hu Jin?” said Liu Ru.

Liu Ru and Mo Fan had already paid a visit to Bo City Street. Only a small group of people from Bo City were living there, while the others were scattered across the Ancient Capital. The information Zhang Xiaohou had brought back was crucial, yet it was too vague!

“Come, let’s look for Mu Bai, Zhou Ming, and the others. They have spent a longer time in the Ancient Capital. Maybe they can help us find this Great Deacon Hu Jin. On top of that, we should tell Zhu Meng about it, too...” said Mo Fan.

“I’ll come with you, I’ll help too,” said Fang Gu. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Oh, I thought you were going to kill the rest of them. As the saying goes, drop the butcher’s knife and immediately become a Buddha...” Mo Fan looked at Fang Gu in surprise.

“I’ve already avenged my people. I’ll turn myself in to the Enforcement Union when we reach the inner city, if we managed to survive,” Fang Gu turned his head around for a glance behind them.

A dense mass of black moving figures!

A shocking sight!

The ocean of undead was already less then kilometer away. When the noise from the shaking ground reached a certain level, it felt like the whole place had fallen into dead silence!

When everyone turned around after they were done with the Black Vatican, they could smell the approaching death, darkness, and fear, the sense of being caught in an ocean of despair that could overwhelm their souls!

It felt like their hearts were close to exploding from their fear of the approaching calamity!

The shocking undead tide was strong enough to crush the buildings, parks, streets and schools... and humans were incredibly tiny!

On the other hand, the inner city was covered in a golden barrier. The inner walls had stood tall for over a thousand years, but could it survive this calamity of undead?

——

Everything behind them was turned into nothing.

The army of undead did not need to do anything. They were simply advancing forward, bringing darkness upon the city. It felt like both the sky and the ground were filled with them.

The inner city under the protection of the golden barrier had turned into an isolated island surrounded by a black ocean with no visible end. The tide surged fiercely, shrouding the sky and the sun. The inner city quaked vigorously, and felt like it would be devoured at any second!

The soldiers stood in lines on the walls. Their eyes were full of terror, regardless of their ranks.

The time had come after all!

The undead had overrun the outer city and devoured half of the city. Those who did not escape to the inner city in time were all dead, as there was zero chance for them to survive.

The cries of the undead were so loud that the inner city was shaking constantly, but the world was immersed in dead silence. As the ocean of undead pitch-black flesh, hills of skeletons, and tides of phantoms came closer, the people almost felt their hearts shattering to pieces from the overwhelming shock!
