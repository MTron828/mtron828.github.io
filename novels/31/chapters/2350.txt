Gray-blue feathers scattered in the air before falling from the sky like heavy stones!

Zhao Manyan had used the magic artifact his father left him. It was protecting the Eagle Horse Skyriders from the raging fierce storm like it was their father!

Lieutenant General Dutch’s death was not a surprise, as he had been fighting alone, like an orphan.

Meanwhile, Zhao Manyan had become the core of the Eagle Horse Skyriders, acting as their shield!

The Eagle Horse Skyriders had outstanding mobility, but their greatest weakness was their lack of defense. They would easily take casualties whenever the enemy fought back.

Zhao Manyan had helped the Eagle Horse Skyriders to overcome their weakness. Their strength had increased significantly as a result.

The troops of Brown Rebels which used to be a nuisance could no longer pose a threat to them. The Eagle Horse Skyriders could now slaughter them with ease!

They were too scared to charge too far into the enemy lines previously, but now they had no trouble taking out the enemy when their safety was no longer a concern.

The Eagle Horse Skyriders had been forced to relocate themselves quickly after harassing the enemy because of how vulnerable they were, but they were now able to engage the enemy in a direct magic brawl.

They began their massacre close to the enemy’s command center. The sudden attack at the main camp took the Brown Rebels by surprise.

The problem was that the Eagle Horse Skyriders razed the command center to the ground by the time the Brown Rebel reinforcements arrived from the main camp. The Eagle Horse Skyriders had all returned to the sky by then.

“This is incredible!”

“This is incredible!”

Eagle Eyes could not believe his eyes. The Eagle Horse Skyriders had changed completely because of a simple layer of protection.

They were able to fight, withstand enemy spells, and move around swiftly. How dangerous was it to fight a group of riders like them now?

Zhao Manyan did not expect that the effects of his defensive magic would be so outstanding, either.

He just wanted the Eagle Horse Skyriders to put up a last fight and intimidate the enemy, but the Eagle Horse Skyriders had become unstoppable with his protection!

“The enemy’s resistance has weakened significantly,” Eagle Eyes pointed out.

Zhao Manyan was having a great time stomping the enemy. He had not known the defensive magic he specialized in could make so much difference to a powerful army!

Zhao Manyan was only trying to light a match, but the flames had grown beyond his expectation!

“They have lost their will to fight...” Zhao Manyan looked at the sky.

“That’s right, the rain has stopped falling!”

The rain had stopped for some time. Zhao Manyan had not noticed it, as he was preoccupied with the battle.

The Brown Rebels had only come together because the Black Vatican’s Frenzy Liquid had driven them to violence and made them rebellious.

They had started to calm down and were wondering why they had involved themselves in the political conflict after the rain stopped.

Meanwhile, the Eagle Horse Skyriders suddenly charged into their midst and massacred them, making the conflicted thoughts in their minds grow stronger.

They were starting to get afraid, and realize that their lives were more important than winning the war!

All these factors combined made the Eagle Horse Skyriders even more unstoppable!

The Eagle Horse Skyriders had gotten themselves together again. White Leopard began to regret his decision of calling Wilted Phoenix back to the main camp, since it did not matter if they allowed Mo Fan to live a little longer.

“I knew we couldn’t count on those people we recruited!” White Leopard snarled.

“They will turn into your most loyal hounds again once the rain returns!” Wu Ku promised calmly.

The Frenzy Liquid played an important role in the war.

If the Frenzy Liquid was not involved, the Brown Rebels might end up settling the conflict peacefully by asking the Federation for a piece of land so they could establish their own little kingdom, even if they did plan a coup from the beginning.

The leader of the Brown Rebels thought overthrowing the Federation and claiming its land was his goal, but the truth was, the Brown Rebels would be mindful of leaving a way out for themselves.

Wu Ku could not have cared less about the Brown Rebels’ casualties. Even if the Brown Rebels were wiped out, other areas would have upheavals as long as the Frenzy Rain fell!

“Kill him, there’s no one you can’t kill in this world! Isn’t that right, Wilted Phoenix?” White Leopard blurted out.

“Mm, there’s no one I can’t kill, as long as I want to kill them,” the person called Wilted Phoenix agreed with a cold voice.

Wilted Phoenix was a woman.

She was very young. She had curly hair the color of lavender, which set off her pale and attractive face. If she was not wearing a military outfit, she could easily be a character from an ancient elf kingdom, brimming with a sacred aura!

“He’s a guy you want to kill!” Wu Ku stated with certainty.

Mo Fan stared at the enemy who had been sent here to kill him in disbelief.

She was just a top student indulged in pursuing magic knowledge before the war broke out. Even though she seemed indifferent toward everything most of the time, she was extremely adorable whenever she found something she was interested in.

Who would have thought that she would become the enemy’s most dangerous secret weapon the next time they met!

“Sharjah...” Mo Fan was still doubtful as he looked at the woman with purple hair.

He thought the woman was Sharjah’s identical twin sister at first glance. However, the look in her eyes had revealed her identity.

She was the president of the Aorus Sacred Institute’s student union!

But now, she was with the Brown Rebels. She had helped them to take out many powerful Mages of the Federation Army. She had become the Brown Rebels’ secret weapon, using the codename Wilted Phoenix!

She had now come to take out Mo Fan too!

“Teacher,” Sharjah greeted him in her usual calm voice.

“Sharjah, are you a Brown Rebel too?” Mo Fan took a deep breath.

“One of my brothers started this war,” Sharjah confirmed honestly.

Mo Fan was stunned.

Her brother started the war? In other words, Sharjah is the sister of the Brown Rebels’ leader?

Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh after hearing her answer. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As long as she was not related to the Black Vatican. Otherwise, Mo Fan would feel sorry if he had to kill a girl like Sharjah.

“The Black Vatican started the war, not your brother,” Mo Fan pointed at Wu Ku.

“I don’t care,” Sharjah replied.

“Wilted Phoenix, stop wasting our time. You can easily kill him, knowing your strength!” White Leopard urged her.

“I told you, he’s not someone I want to kill,” Sharjah said coldly.

White Leopard’s face darkened.

Why was she treating him like a stranger, while she was talking to this man respectfully? He was a childhood friend of hers!
