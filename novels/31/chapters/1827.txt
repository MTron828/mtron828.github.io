Chapter 1828: The Umbrella of Coconut Trees in the Sky

Mo Fan was willing to go along with Chen Shuo’s plan if there was no other way.

The truth was, Mo Fan had never tamed a demon creature before. He simply treated it as a learning opportunity. If he really could tame these Manta Ray Evil Birds, it might significantly increase his homeland’s firepower along the coastline!

Taming was not really related to the Summoning Element. It was actually an ability of the Psychic Element, as it relied on Psychic Magic to communicate with a demon creature and slowly rid it of its savage nature and convert it into something positive. The creature would gradually submit to humans, and become a pet or a comrade in battle.

Most tamed creatures could only obey simple instructions. For example, the Heavenly Eagles were mainly responsible for carrying their masters around, protecting them, and assisting them in battles. Their minds were not linked like the connections between a Summoned Beast or a Contracted Beast and their Summoners were. Their relationship was not as close, nor would they have such outstanding synergy. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Most tamed creatures were only treated as mounts. It was quite difficult to convince tamed creatures to fight other demon creatures!

“My father wanted me to become a Tamer and serve in the military when I was younger, but I kind of strayed away from the path somehow. To be honest, I’m under huge pressure knowing the burden is currently on my shoulders, considering they failed the attempt ten years ago,” Jiang Shaoxu admitted.

The group was now heading toward the Sky Coconut Grove through a secret passage from the emergency outpost. It was where the Great Featherless Birds and the Featherless Bird Emperor lived. The old devices for taming purposes were stored there, too.

“Such pressure you are under, but why the hell do I have to take on the Manta Ray Evil Birds’ Emperor alone!?” Mo Fan grumbled immediately.

Mo Fan thought Chen Shuo meant he just had to fight the Bird Emperor with all his strength to defeat it, but he just realized he was going to take on the Bird Emperor alone, since it was the only way to earn the creature’s approval.

Mo Fan could not care less about getting the creature’s approval. Why couldn’t they just take on the Bird Emperor together and beat the crap out of it? If it was not convinced of their strength, they could just beat it up a few more times! However, they had to turn it into a fair duel where others were not allowed to intervene. Were they crazy? Did they seriously want him to fight the creature fair and square? Mo Fan never bothered fighting anyone fair and square!

“Mo Fan, think about it; if you manage to tame the Bird Emperor, you can make it your mount. If I were you, I would feel very ashamed in front of other Super Mages and Summoners considering how bad you are with water. After all, you can only ride your second Contracted Beast at night.. uh, what I’m trying to say is, this is a great opportunity for you. It’s the prologue to you dominating the Pacific Ocean!” Zhao Manyan cheered him on.

Mo Fan gave it serious thought and realized Zhao Manyan was not being totally unreasonable.

Mo Fan had initially planned to get himself a flying beast as his second Contracted Beast, but he ended up with a little snake demoness instead. Any Wing Magical Equipment was extremely expensive, too. There was no way he could get one that was fit for his level with the money he had.

Therefore, finding a mount was indeed the perfect solution!

Magical Wings were extremely costly. Those that cost only one or two hundred million were too slow for his current level, so he did not bother wasting his money on them.

“Jiang Shaoxu, your main focus on the Psychic Element is the Illusionary Branch, right?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yeah, so I don’t feel too confident. I only know a little about how to tame a creature,” Jiang Shaoxu confirmed.

“I’ll ask someone to give you a hand later, but make sure you keep the Greater Featherless Birds and the Manta Ray Evil Birds at bay while I’m fighting the Bird Emperor. I seriously don’t want to die here!” Mo Fan told her.

“Don’t you worry, we’ll be keeping an eye for you!” Chen Shuo let out a relieved sigh when Mo Fan finally agreed to the plan.

“How long until we reach the Sky Coconut Grove? It’ll be daybreak soon.”

“We are almost there.”

Wanggui Town...

Zhu Min and Li Dong staggered out of a bar, each with a hand around the waist of a woman with heavy makeup. Tangyue had finally considered giving up on the operation today. They no longer had to put on an act before her, and could finally relax.

A few bulky figures slowly approached them as they reached the junction. A man in a huge coat was leading them. He had a stern face as he cast an aloof gaze at Zhu Min and Li Dong.

“Is this what you should be doing when you’re on duty?” the man harrumphed coldly.

“Fa...father!” Zhu Min’s legs trembled as soon as he saw the man.

“Chief!” Li Dong collected his thoughts quickly. He rapidly pushed the woman in his arm away.

The woman immediately cursed in the local dialect when Li Dong’s attitude changed so suddenly.

The chief of the Enforcement Union squinted, as if he was observing some filthy wild hens, a disdainful and heartless look in his eyes. The faces of the two women turned pale, as if their thick makeup was about to fall off their faces. They immediately ran away, not daring to say a word further.

“Where’s the Vice Chief?” Chief Zhu Qi said.

“I...I think she went home,” Li Dong said.

“Humph, why did a Senior Enforcer tell me she had gone to Dawn Island with a few people, then?” Zhu Qi asked.

“No way, we clearly saw her...” Zhu Min began.

“I told you two to keep an eye on her, yet you couldn’t even do such a simple task. I know better than anyone else how dangerous Dawn Island is. I asked you to keep an eye on her not only to be wary of her, but to stop her from doing anything reckless, too. After all, she was assigned here by the Lingyin Enforcement Union. If she dies on the island, it will bring us a lot of trouble,” Zhu Qi said.

“That woman must be out of her mind!” Li Dong swore.

“Go take a look around, and make sure she’s still alive,” Zhu Qi ordered them.

Dawn Island, the Sky Coconut Grove...

The Sky Coconut Grove was made up of coconut trees that had been growing on a tall hill for more than a hundred years. Their dense leaves were bundled up together. The top of the trees bent slightly too, making them look like an enormous umbrella. It was quite a spectacular sight.

The main training and breeding ranch was located in the Sky Coconut Grove. There were iron nets all over the trees, looming over them like a sky. Together, they resembled a huge dome protecting the island!
