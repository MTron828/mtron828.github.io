Mo Fan found the imperious figure with a slight hint of an evil Aura quite familiar. He remembered the same type of cold-blooded Undead Ruler riding a dark horse and holding a greatsword when he encountered the mirages in Egypt.

“A Dark Swordmaster!” Mo Fan blurted out in surprise.

The Dark Swordmaster was not holding its greatsword, it was still in its sheath on its back. Its steed was leaving a dark icy trail behind it.

The horse it was riding was unusual. It was fully covered in dark icy armor, including its hooves. The ashes and bones it stepped on were covered in frost.

It was obvious that the Dark Swordmaster was a loyal servant of the Lord of Darkness, with great status and strength. The Dark Swordmasters had lofty stations in the Dark Plane.

The Dark Swordmasters that had appeared in Egypt and the Great Pyramid of Giza were roughly as strong as Lesser Rulers or Ruler-inferior creatures, but Dark Swordmasters were stronger in the Dark Plane. There were different levels between the Dark Swordmasters, too!

Mo Fan did not dare lower his guard. After all, he no longer had the Demon Element active or available, and he was extremely tired, too. The Dark Plane was not a friendly place at all. They had even stumbled into such a powerful creature after they had just arrived!

“What are you doing!?” Asha’ruiya asked when she saw Mo Fan’s reaction.

“I’m going to beat him. I can’t let him hurt you,” Mo Fan replied.

Asha’ruiya was amused. She looked quite adorable when she giggled. Her reactions were always more expressive than Asian women, as she always showed her true feelings instead of acting reservedly.

“He’s my servant, don’t you remember?” Asha’ruiya reminded him.

“Your servant?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

The Dark Swordmaster stopped fifty meters away and came down off his horse. He walked up to Asha’ruiya?slowly.

He approached Asha’ruiya and knelt on the ground. He took off his helmet… head, and put it on his waist as he bowed!

Mo Fan almost dropped his jaw.

Normally, a knight would take his helmet off. Was he trying to spook them by taking his head off instead?!

“Put your head back on,” Asha’ruiya directed the Dark Swordmaster.

“Yes, master.” The Dark Ice Swordmaster respectfully put his head back, but he accidentally put it on in the wrong direction. His helm was looking backward, while his body was facing forward.

Mo Fan almost burst out laughing.

It was that Dark Knight!

Mo Fan remembered Asha’ruiya did indeed have a Dark Knight she Summoned from the Dark Plane, but she was using some ancient Contract instead of the Summoning Element. It had given her a guardian from the Dark Plane.

The Dark Knight had been quite reliable when they were visiting the villages around the Ancient Capital, back when they were not very strong.

To his surprise, the Dark Knight had ranked up to a Dark Swordmaster, but he was just as clumsy as he used to be.

“Does that mean we have a local to guide us around?” Mo Fan wondered aloud.

“Mm, Hamura is familiar with this place. We could avoid some traps with him guiding us. However, we still have to follow rules of the Lord of Darkness’ game,” Asha’ruiya nodded.

“Game rules? What kind of rules?!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“The Lord of Darkness is a weird Emperor. He’s as generous as a heavenly deity sometimes, but he can also be as cruel and merciless as a devil. However, he’s more like a playful kid most of the time. He establishes strange rules for outsiders and grants them special powers in exchange for their souls,” Asha’ruiya informed him.

Mo Fan immediately recalled he had made a deal with the Lord of Darkness before, but it was only one of the being’s little clones back then.

They had gone to Tianshan Mountain to find the Night Amethyst to trade to get Mu Bai’s soul back from the Lord of Darkness. Apparently, the Night Amethyst was one of the Lord of Darkness’ favorite gems.

Was the Night Amethyst of any use to the Lord of Darkness? Mo Fan doubted it. He could easily obtain plenty of them with his power, but the rumors of the ability to trade a soul from the Lord of Darkness with a Night Amethyst continued to spread out from Greece.

“The Dark Plane is powerful and rich in resources, thus many creatures from other planes want to borrow its power, including the Shadow Mages of our world. We are offering our energy in exchange for the Dark Plane’s power. Meanwhile, the Dark Plane is closely connected to many planes, thus living creatures occasionally end up here, including living humans like us. These creatures are referred to as travelers.

“The Lord of Darkness could trap travelers in the Dark Plane forever, but he enjoys playing games with travelers and giving them a chance to return to their own worlds on the condition that we must obey the rules he comes up with for the game. If the travelers win, they can leave the Dark Plane freely. If they lose, they will be stuck here forever, their flesh and souls will belong to the Lord of Darkness. They won’t be alive, but they can still have a colorful life here,” Asha’ruiya said.

She was more familiar with the Dark Plane than most people. Greece had conducted a great deal of research on the Dark Plane. Many ancient records had information about it, and the Greeks could also communicate directly with Darkness Creatures.

The Dark Plane was not just a kingdom of a different world. As a matter of fact, the Dark Plane might be bigger than the human world!

The Dark Magic of humanity, such as the Curse, Shadow, Undead, and Poison Elements, had all originated from the Lord of Darkness.

In simple words, if one day the Lord of Darkness was in a bad mood and decided to sever his connection with humans, they would lose access to four Elements!

The Lord of Darkness was easily the strongest existence anyone had come upon. So far, humans had yet to find anything that was superior to the Lord of Darkness.

“What are the rules, then? Will all the travelers be playing the game?” Mo Fan asked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Many of the surviving civilians of Dubai City were wandering hopelessly nearby. They were dressed in professional attire and beautiful clothes. However, their lives were now in the hands of the mysterious ruler of the Dark Plane after they were forcibly dragged here.

“They are travelers too, so they have to follow the rules,” Asha’ruiya sighed.

“Su Lu is such an assh****.. I wonder how many of them are going to make it back alive…” Mo Fan wondered helplessly.
