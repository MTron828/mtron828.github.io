“The Clearsky Hunter Agency, the one with a long-established reputation in the Magic City! Don’t people always complain about their attitude? They always despise employers that go to ask them for a favor. I also heard that their agency is unmanned most of the time. They are known for their irresponsible attitude!” The big-nosed Mage was pretty familiar with the Hunter Agencies. He was surprised when he heard the name of the Hunter Agency involved.

The Clearsky Hunter Agency was considered outlandish by other Hunters. Most Hunters in the Hunter Union and the reputable Hunter Agencies were concerned about their image and reputation. After all, it was the key to earning money!

The Clearsky Hunter Agency was special. If the private Hunter Agencies were ranked according to the number of complaints they received, the Clearsky Hunter Agency was high on the ranking because they kept turning down their customers! Asking their Hunters for a favor was more difficult than recruiting Zhuge Liang!

{TL Note: Zhuge Liang was a famous character in history. In the Romance of Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei only managed to recruit him after paying him three personal visits.}

However, the Clearsky Hunter Agency was still well-respected among the Hunters, mainly because the Clearsky Hunter Agency had a one hundred percent completion rate of the quests they accepted, even today!

When it came to difficult and tricky quests, many people would recommend that people try their luck at the Clearsky Hunter Agency. If Clearsky was willing to accept the quest, it was already half-completed!

“I just received some news,” the Hunter Mistress said.

Gu Ying immediately tensed up in worry. After all, her Foehn Hunter Squad did not have an impressive reputation, unlike Li Yumei’s Panshan Hunter Squad, which had connections with many Hunter Masters.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The other members were nervous, too. A quest worth twenty-four million as the reward was at stake. They could enjoy a long vacation after they were done with the quest!

“The infant of the Lizard Demons that your group caught meets the Hunter Master’s requirements. She has agreed to hire you. You can give me the details of your members. I will go ahead with the procedures. Once they are done, you will be officially hired by the Hunter Master. You must fulfill your duty,” the Hunter Mistress informed them.

“Wow, that’s great!” Zhong Li jumped up in joy.

The rest of the team embraced one another in excitement. They were rich, they were being paid twenty-four million! Each person was going to get four million, and it would only take a month!

Gu Ying stood still. Tears almost rolled down her cheeks.

If Li Yumei had not provoked her, she could only throw a tantrum and beat the crap out of her teammates to vent her frustration if she did not get the quest. She could suddenly see the sunlight poking out of the thick stormy clouds!

“Make sure you seize the opportunity. I hope you don’t disappoint the Seven Star Hunter Masters,” the Hunter Mistress encouraged them with a smile.

“Will do, we promise to give it our best!”

If their employer was really a Seven Star Hunter Master, the opportunity was clearly worth more than twenty-four million. Li Yumei’s squad had been pressuring them for a long time. They always ended up with the better employers and easier quests with higher rewards. Meanwhile, the Foehn Squad had worked harder to earn less money. Some employers even picked on them on purpose, just because the Panshan Hunter Squad was tied to a Three Star Hunter Master.

A connection to a Three Star Hunter Master was not to be underestimated. There were many Hunter Squads in China, and many Hunters waiting to earn a fortune. There were a lot of competent Hunter Groups, too. Since everyone was an Intermediate Mage, it was difficult to showcase their strength just by casting a few spells in front of their employers. How were they supposed to stand out among the Hunter Groups?

An employer would thus usually choose a Hunter Squad that was recommended by a Hunter Master!

Even though the strength of a Hunter Squad mattered the most, it was unlikely that the strength of the Hunter Squads differed by much at their current level. Even if the Hunter Squad did not complete the quests as requested, as long as the Panshan Hunter Squad had access to the easier quests with higher pay, the members could afford better magic equipment and resources to improve their cultivation. They would eventually get stronger, widening the gap between them and the Foehn Hunter Squad. Even the smallest advantage would eventually grow into a huge gap!

Therefore, when Gu Ying learned the quest was from a Seven Star Hunter Master, she was even more desperate to claim it. It might be the opportunity she had been looking for to resolve the difficulties that the Foehn Hunter Squad was currently facing!

At the inn in Minghu Outpost, Li Yumei was sitting on a wooden chair. She pulled a long face when she considered the quest worth twenty-four million escaping from her grasp.

“What is it, my little baby? Who’s making you mad?” A man with long hair came over and sat down beside Li Yumei. The man slipped his hand into Li Yumei’s clothes, seeing no one was around them.

“Humph, it’s because of the goddamned quest that is hiring a Hunter Squad. That Seven Star Hunter Master didn’t even bother giving you any face. They ended up choosing that b**ch Gu Ying’s group. Idiots!” Li Yumei swore angrily.

“Twenty-four million is a lot indeed, but you’re already an Advanced Mage. You shouldn’t let such a trivial matter bother you,” Lu Zhuo said.

“I just don’t feel good because she got the quest. I will soon leave the Panshan Hunter Squad, so I wanted to secure some benefits for them before I go,” Li Yumei said haughtily.

“Well, they did specify they were looking for an infant of the Lizard Demons captured from the wild. They aren’t that stupid to fall for your little tricks. Oh, I forgot to tell you, my team just accepted a new quest. It’s an A-Rank Quest,” Lu Zhuo said.

“An A-Rank Quest? Can’t you bring me along?” Li Yumei asked immediately.

She was now an Advanced Mage, yet she had yet to attempt an A-Rank Quest!

As a matter of fact, they had only completed a few B-Rank Quests so far. The quest given by the Seven Star Hunter Master with twenty-four million as the reward was considered a B-Rank Quest. The quest before it which had paid a million was only a D-Rank Quest.

Hunters needed reputation. The Hunter Union would reward Hunters with Contribution Points based on the number and the rank of the quests they completed, how satisfied the employers were, and their completion rate. The Hunter Union would then rank the Hunters based on their reputation and the Contribution Points they had collected.

A-Rank Quests were only available to Hunter Masters. If no one in a Hunter Group was a Hunter Master, they did not even have the right to see the details of the quest!

Li Yumei was now an Advanced Mage, yet her Contribution Points were still at the rank of an Advanced Hunter. If she participated in an A-Rank Quest and completed it, she would soon become a Hunter Master from the Contribution Points rewarded to her!

“I’m afraid not. After all, my team is pretty serious about it,” Lu Zhuo said after a slight hesitation.

Li Yumei might be an Advanced Mage, but she still had not learned how to use the Advanced Spells. She was not much stronger than an Intermediate Mage. Besides, Lu Zhuo was well aware of Li Yumei’s strength... she was only skillful in bed!
