3000 You’re The Supreme Pontiff

As the old saying went, he who was able to go through the hardest hardships would stand out from other men.

In the past, Zhao Manyan was a playboy who lacked ambitions.

Today, despite his playboy appearance, those who had a good sense of judgment because of their wealth of experience from their lives could see that Zhao Manyan showed his open-mindedness through his seemingly lackadaisical behavior, because he had seen the beauty, ugliness, goodness and evil of the world.

Not every young heirs was open-minded. However, most successful people were open-minded.

While the experienced businessmen were good at careful planning and budget-conscious, Zhao Manyan had to be the one to conquer the arrogant European consortia, European ancient, great families, and European royal families.

Zhao Group was not short of money, but they lacked the respect from the world!

...

After the meeting was over, Zhao Manyan sat alone at the top of the chambers of commerce tower. Behind him was an ancient bell engraved with dragons and mountains.

He could enjoy the full view of Venice. He still remembered the day he was forced to the valley of death by Zhao Youqian.

How could he possibly not feel dejected?

Whenever he recalled his father at the time of his death, his father did not look angry or resentful. Instead, his father looked regretful. Zhao Manyan finally understood why father looked so.

For a very long time, Zhao Manyan hated his older brother so much that he wanted to kill him…

Zhao Manyan could not wait to tell their mother how scum Zhao Youqian actually was. Zhao Manyan did everything he could to make himself stronger so that he had the resources to take revenge.

However, by the time he had the ability to take revenge, Zhao Manyan was reluctant to speak out the truth when he saw his mother looking at a loss, as if someone had sucked away her soul. He could not afford to set off a bloody revenge.

So, he decided to cripple Zhao Youqian’s most powerful weapon. Zhao Manyan did not stop Zhao Youqian from being a businessman. As long as Zhao Youqian took good care of their mother and family business, Zhao Manyan would not hold a grudge against him. After all, his father did not show any resentment toward Zhao Youqian. Whenever Zhao Youqian had a few screws loose in his head, Zhao Manyan would send him to the mental hospital and let him stay there for a couple of days.

“There you are! Have you finished the meeting? Why don’t you take a rest?” A soft voice rose.

“Mother, why are you here?” Zhao Manyan turned his head around. He was surprised to see Bai Miaoying. Her complexion improved a lot compared to last time.

“I learned from Old Dong that you did a great job today. If your father is here, he’ll be very happy about it.” Bai Miaoying took her seat.

“I’ve asked the ladies to record the video. I’ll send him the video later. I suppose there’s internet down there,” said Zhao Manyan.

Bai Miaoying rolled her eyes at Zhao Manyan.

“I don’t understand. How did you make the Victorian Dragon Taming family sign the contract? Even if you have a close relationship with Duke Ayleen, she can’t possibly agree to sign such an important contract with you.” Bai Miaoying asked in puzzlement.

“Mother, what is my greatest talent?” asked Zhao Manyan.

“Magic?”

Zhao Manyan shook his head.

“Doing business?”

Zhao Manyan shook his head again.

“Then, what is it?” Bai Miaoying could not think of anything else.

“Courting girls!” Zhao Manyan said proudly.

Bai Miaoying was stunned. It took her a while before she recovered her senses.

“Really?” she cried out in surprise.

“It’s true. There was once I went for a vacation in the Victorian Dragon Taming family’s house with two friends. Initially, I intend to shamelessly ask for a flying dragon from Ayleen. Two of my friends only had their eyes on dragons, and they racked their brains to conquer the dragons. However, I’m smart enough to realize that as long as I’m able to conquer Ayleen, I’ll be able to get all the dragons,” said Zhao Manyan.

Bai Miaoying could not help but let her jaw-dropped upon hearing his words.

He was a talented man.

His son was truly a talent!

“I’ve seen that girl before. She is a nice girl. Despite coming from a distinguished family, she can adapt to any environment. Bring her over for a meal if there’s a chance,” said Bai Miaoying.

“Ahem, actually, I’m still courting her. This is by far the most difficult girl I can get my hands on,” said Zhao Manyan embarrassedly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Then you have to work harder and show her your true feelings. Stop using those lousy tricks,” said Bai Miaoying.

“Okay. Mother, there’s something I might need your help with,” said Zhao Manyan.

“What is it?” Zhao Manyan looked solemn. It was clear that he had something serious to talk to her about.

“We must have the final say in Venice. I need to whitewash someone.”

“Whitewash someone. Are you referring to the Holy City’s case…?” Bai Miaoying widened her eyes.

“Yes.”

...

...

After the heavy rain, the olives outside Athens City bloomed flawlessly. Unique fragrance came from the clusters of pale yellow stamens, and it made the city look like an enchanting woman.

The Parthenon Temple Goddess election that had been postponed numerous times finally took place this year. People in Athens City felt as if they had been through a long war, and that the days of darkness finally came to an end.

Inside the city stood two sculptures. The sculptures represented the candidates of the goddess who had reached the final stage.

One of them was Ye Xinxia, the other was Izisha.

Izisha’s sculpture had a long spear in her hand and was covered in magnificent armor. She made her sculpture a symbol of victory and gave off the aura of a fighting saintess.

Meanwhile, Ye Xinxia’s sculpture was unarmed. The sculpture perfectly depicted her aura of gentleness and meekness. Her sculpture held a long olive branch, with the other hand resting on her chest. Her sculpture looked serene and elegant, which represented peace and wisdom.

The two saintess portrayed two different styles. It was difficult to conclude which of the two the people preferred.

But one thing for sure, the one who failed would have her sculpture knocked down on the spot. According to the final stage of the previous goddess election, most of the losers ended up poorly. After all, this was not a beauty pageant contest. The Greek government was closely-related to the Parthenon Temple election. They were all about fighting and competing for personal interests.

After the two saintess finished giving their speeches, the Athens City stirred up. The crowd could not wait to salute and give their allegiance to their goddess in advance.

The speech was the final public canvassing. It would then be followed by the Flower Festival before the final election results.

They returned to the Parthenon Mountain. The path was neither too narrow or wide. The other female attendants had left, leaving only Izisha and Ye Xinxia. They would return to their respective Saintess’ Hall at the intersection in front of them.

Izisha stopped at the intersection and turned around.

“All this time, I’ve been mistaken about one thing. Probably this was also the reason why you can grow to become so strong within a short period of time,” said Izisha to Ye Xinxia.

Ye Xinxia turned around and looked at Izisha in puzzlement.

“I admitted that I’m the one who plotted everything. I’m the one who set you up to become the Red Cardinal Salan. I know your blood relationship with Salan,” said Izisha bluntly.

“Everyone knows about it.” said Ye Xinxia coolly.

“But I didn’t accuse you. It’s just that I’ve always been wrong about one thing.” Izisha never took her eyes off Ye Xinxia.

“What is it?” Ye Xinxia asked nonchalantly.

“You’re not the Red Cardinal. You’re the Supreme Pontiff Ye Xinxia!” said Izisha with great conviction.
