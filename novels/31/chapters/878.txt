Zhao Pinlin had his arm around Wang Xuxu’s waist as they entered the restaurant. He was hugging the woman tightly. Judging from how intimate they were, it felt like they had been together for quite a while, their relationship had escalated further... The confident grin on Zhao Pinlin’s face seemed to be telling everyone that the woman beside him was his!

Mo Fan looked at Rong Sheng, then at Zhao Pinlin, and finally at Wang Xuxu who seemed rather unnatural.

-What the heck is going on!-

“Oh~you two...you two are...”

“Damn, weren’t you two still referring to one another as classmates yesterday? You are already showing up like this today! Did we miss something last night?”

The others immediately made a great fuss about it, asking the details of what happened last night.

Meanwhile, Rong Sheng looked like he was having a nightmare. Mo Fan felt extremely sorry for the guy looking at his expression. Judging from his joyful reaction before, he must have assumed himself to be a toad who had no chance of tasting a swan’s meat, but he actually succeeded last night...

He was only sharing his joy a moment ago before witnessing the scene. He must be thunderstruck.

Mo Fan did not think that Rong Sheng was lying. After all, it was obvious that something must have happened judging from Wang Xuxu’s unnatural expression, and the way she tried to avoid Rong Sheng’s gaze.

Rong Sheng rose to his feet. His gaze never left Wang Xuxu as soon as she stepped into the restaurant.

“Xuxu, can you give me an explanation? Why are you with him when you already accepted me last night?” Rong Sheng was pretty straightforward. He only wanted an answer.

The others were shocked when they heard the words. Who would have thought!?

“Rong Sheng, can we talk later?” Wang Xuxu replied in a soft voice, to stop him from asking when there were so many people around.

Zhao Pinlin burst out laughing. He completely disregarded their feelings, “Oh Rong Sheng, she was only joking with you. Xuxu, isn’t that the case?”

“Joking? How could she be joking!?” said Rong Sheng.

Wang Xuxu felt sorry when she saw Rong Sheng’s reaction, yet she was left with no choice when she saw Zhao Pinlin’s gaze, “Rong Sheng, it’s like this, you suddenly expressed your feelings to me last night. I was reluctant to hurt you as I saw how sincere you were, so I wasn’t being clear when I turned you down. I didn’t think you would misunderstand me, but I didn’t want to hurt you, so I went with the flow...as for Zhao Pinlin and I...you should understand.”

Rong Sheng was dumbfounded!

Wang Xuxu’s words were like a hammer smashing his wonderful memories he had last night into pieces. It continued to stab his heart. It was so painful that he could not find any word.

Went with the flow... She was only going with the flow last night?

He thought he would be the luckiest man starting this morning. He even had trouble falling asleep last night. He was already planning for their future. He even made up his mind to work harder, so he could bring her to the luxurious places she liked...

To his surprise, a bucket of icy, bone-chilling water was poured right on his face in the morning!

“Rong Sheng, were you drinking last night? What did I say to you? You shouldn’t have pushed your luck. Did you really go find her last night...” Wang Bing let out a sigh.

Someone else also sighed. “We are all classmates. It’s normal for us to develop feelings for one another. Come, let’s have breakfast.”

“Yeah, Rong Sheng, just think of last night as a dream. We are still going to see one another for quite some time. Don’t make it too awkward. Wang Xuxu was being considerate of your feelings too. She obviously cared how you felt. If it was someone else, she might have scolded them out of the room. Why would she bother explaining the situation to you?”

Rong Sheng went back to his seat. Zhao Pinlin felt incredibly proud when he saw Rong Sheng’s helpless expression!

The atmosphere at breakfast felt very strange after the incident. Mo Fan spent the whole time comforting Rong Sheng.

The honest Rong Sheng reminded Mo Fan of Zhang Xiaohou. He felt extremely sorry for what happened.

“Brother, I really didn’t...didn’t lie to you. She really...accepted me last night.” Tears almost ran down Rong Sheng’s cheeks. The pain was a hundred times worse than being rejected directly by Wang Xuxu.

It felt like he had fallen from Heaven to Hell...

He really had nursed an affection for Wang Xuxu for a long time!

“Alright, come, let’s eat something,” said Mo Fan.

——

Everyone quickly finished breakfast. Most people went with Zhao Pinlin to enjoy the facilities. Rong Sheng had most likely gone back to his room in tears.

Mo Fan was on his way to Lingling’s room. The love and hatred between the group of students were little of his concern, since the Black Vatican was still his priority as a Hunter. When his life was at stake, anything else did not feel as important.

“What are you doing here? Didn’t you go with the others?” Mo Fan was just about to find Lingling when he saw Guo Wenyi following behind him. She seemed to have something to say.

“Err... to be honest, I couldn’t really understand what happened just then. I wasn’t sure if I should talk to Wang Xuxu; she’s acting really strange,” said Guo Wenyi.

Mo Fan was confused. He took the girl’s phone and saw the text that Wang Xuxu sent to Guo Wenyi last night. She was telling Guo Wenyi that she and Rong Sheng were in a relationship.

Guo Wenyi and Wang Xuxu were quite close to one another. The two even had a long chat last night. Clearly, Wang Xuxu was more interested in an honest man like Rong Sheng. She even mentioned that she would not feel secure being around Zhao Pinlin. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Mo Fan was even more confused. Wasn’t Wang Xuxu a bit too fickle?

“It was her own decision. Telling me won’t help at all,” Mo Fan returned the phone to Guo Wenyi.

Did she really think of him as a relationship expert? He had other businesses to attend to. He seriously did not have time to care about someone’s relationship.

“I just thought...thought she’s acting really strange. It felt like she had turned into a different person. I’ve known her for some time, but I rarely see her like that. It feels like... she’s terrified,” said Guo Wenyi.

Guo Wenyi did not know who to talk to. She recalled how Mo Fan had helped her overcome her fear last night, so she decided to share it with Mo Fan.

“She’s terrified?” Mo Fan was intrigued.

“Yeah, she used to be very timid, and whenever she’s afraid, she holds onto her sleeves. When she was around Zhao Pinlin, she kept holding her sleeves. She did not let go even once. She’s really terrified, but I can’t tell what she’s afraid of. I feel like something isn’t right. I was hoping that you could help her. Wang Xuxu isn’t a fickle person. She already shared her thoughts with me, she thinks Rong Sheng is better than Zhao Pinlin... she was chatting happily with me last night, but it somehow ended up like this today. I am afraid that she’s...she’s being blackmailed,” said Guo Wenyi in a soft voice.

Mo Fan did not say anything. However, he decided to keep the incident in mind.
