“Sir, the powder of the blue moths seems to have a hypnotizing effect. I’ll go with you,” Cao Qinqin said.

Cao Qinqin was a Poison Mage. She could easily drive the powder away using Poison Cavity.

“You will go find a way to wake the City Hunters up. Ask them to evacuate the townsfolk to somewhere safe,” Mo Fan told Cao Qinqin.

“Will you be fine taking her on by yourself? She seems to be quite powerful,” Cao Qinqin asked, concerned.

“I will be fine,” Mo Fan replied.

Mo Fan glanced at Bai Hongfei, who still had a blank face. He frowned and said, “Come with me. Do you really want the people of the town to die in Yu Shishi’s hands?”

Bai Hongfei nodded stiffly. He followed Mo Fan absent-mindedly.

It was a relief that the number of moths under Yu Shishi’s control was nowhere as terrifying as the Sandstorm Demon Locusts had been. However, the moths still posed a huge threat to the town.

“Ardent Sunset!” Flames like the clouds during sunset burst out of Mo Fan’s body and circled him. The strong flames surged at the moths and cleared a path with fire.

However, with so many moths around, the fire was like a torch in complete darkness. It was only able to provide them with limited visibility.

“She’s there!” The sense of defeat and astonishment in Bai Hongfei’s heart gradually turned into anger. He disregarded the moths that were flying around him and jumped straight onto the black tiles of a roof. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He went straight toward where Yu Shishi was. The moths did not try to stop him.

—

Yu Shishi was floating in the sky as if she was riding a flying blue raft. The intimidating glimmer of her eyes made her beautiful face oddly terrifying!

“Why did you lie to me!?” Bai Hongfei shouted at her from the roof.

Yu Shishi looked down at Bai Hongfei and giggled, “Didn’t you see how they were treating me in the day? I’m just paying back the favor!”

“The Carnelian Head Spider is already dead. Your moths are free too! Please don’t hurt the people in the town,” Bai Hongfei soon lost his rage.

“Are you seriously treating me like a woman? HAHAHA!” Yu Shishi burst out laughing. Her even teeth slowly turned into fangs.

Her beautiful face was shifting, too. Her skin began to glitter blue as a giant pair of wings grew out of the flesh on her back in a spray of pus.

Bai Hongfei’s eyes widened upon witnessing Yu Shishi’s changes.

Was this Yu Shishi human or a demon creature? Why was she able to transform into such a ghastly creature even though she looked completely human just a second ago?

“You’re such a naive little boy. Since you’ve done such a huge favor for me, I can let you leave unharmed. As for the people in this town... hehe, do you really think they are kind and pure? I’ve been living in this town for many years. I have seen how evil they are!” Yu Shishi laughed hollowly.

“But...but what about the kids? They didn’t do anything wrong,” Bai Hongfei said.

Yu Shishi did not answer. The number of moths around her kept increasing.

A bright flame swept past the cloudy night sky and went straight at Yu Shishi.

The moths around her were burned into ashes. Even the thickest wall of moths stood no chance against the fire.

Yu Shishi beat her wings in the direction of the fire as soon as she saw it. The fire initially heading for Yu Shishi ended up missing and flew off into the distance after it was deflected!

Another scorching Fiery Fist soon followed the first!

More Fiery Fists began to sweep past the night sky like a rain of meteorites. They were all heading toward Yu Shishi.

Yu Shishi continued to deflect the flames. However, she soon realized the flames were not only after her. She could see her moths turning into ashes by the Meteorite Fists. The cloud of moths around her shrank rapidly in just a few moments!

“Why did you even bother wasting your time talking to this b**ch!?” Mo Fan appeared on top of a building. The flames of Ardent Sunset were coiling around his arms, their ripples preventing the moths from coming any closer. The flames were oddly bright within the cloudy tornado of moths and darkness!

Yu Shishi stared at Mo Fan angrily.

Mo Fan’s Rain of Flames had killed many of her moths. She was only able to produce the moths with the energy she had acquired from the townsfolk. She used to be extremely cautious. To avoid exposing herself, she would try her best not to absorb the energy from the same person, nor did she kill anyone...

“I swear I’m going to absorb all your energy!” Yu Shishi cursed at him.

“Is that so? I doubt your skinny body would even let me break a sweat,” Mo Fan mocked her back.

Yu Shishi shuddered. How dare the Mage underestimate her!?

The moths covering the people of the town quickly rose into the sky. Their thin wings turned into sharp blades, sweeping in Mo Fan’s direction wildly.

The wings were shockingly powerful. The wind was strong enough to blow wooden structures into the air before shredding the tiles, planks, and ceilings into pieces.

“Bai Hongfei, save the people!” Mo Fan ordered Bai Hongfei sternly.

Bai Hongfei naively thought Yu Shishi would spare the lives of the townsfolk. To his surprise, Yu Shishi had lost it all after her identity was exposed. She was more than willing to destroy everything in her abhorrence of their evil!

“Yes...got it, sir!” Bai Hongfei did not dare to waste any time. He quickly went to the buildings that were in danger and dragged the unconscious townsfolk out of them.

Bai Hongfei was an Advanced Mage, after all. He had no trouble saving the people while Mo Fan was keeping Yu Shishi occupied.

3Yu Shishi could not care less about the townsfolk, either. Her hatred of Mo Fan was the greatest after all the moths he had killed. If she absorbed the energy of a strong Mage like him, she could easily produce a huge bunch of powerful moths!

A few houses were razed to the ground. Mo Fan landed on an arching bridge. When the wind blades followed after him, he quickly moved to the roof of another building with a flicker of silver light.

Yu Shishi was struggling to keep track of him. When she finally realized where he was, Mo Fan had already Summoned a pair of wings made of the flames of the Ardent Sunset to propel himself at her.

Yu Shishi reacted quickly, beating her wings to dodge Mo Fan’s attack. However, Mo Fan was not trying to attack Yu Shishi. He fired his burning feathers into every direction. The feathers exploded as soon as they made contact with the moths!

The night sky was suddenly lit up by explosions that looked like fireworks. The blue moths had turned into scorched pieces falling from the sky after the brilliant explosions.

“Damn it, damn it!” Yu Shishi trembled in rage.

Mo Fan was abusing the flames of his Ardent Sunset to massacre her moths. It was costing her all the effort that she had put in for countless nights!

“Die!” Yu Shishi charged at Mo Fan in hate, quick as a gust of wind. The wind was carrying her poisonous powder with her!

“Little Flame Belle, Possess!” Mo Fan yelled. It felt like he had long been waiting for Yu Shishi to lose her calm.

1The Ardent Sunset and the Calamity Fire erupted below Mo Fan’s feet. The wild flames shrouded him like invincible armor. His aura skyrocketed as the Domain of the two fires spread rapidly, burning the moths into ashes.

Yu Shishi was right in front of Mo Fan. She began to panic when she saw how formidable Mo Fan’s flames were.

Fire had always been a moth’s weakness. Yu Shishi never thought the ordinary-looking Mage would possess such overwhelming power. Her skin was blistering from the scorching heat of the flames!

1“You have a new natural enemy from today on, and that’s me!”

1The God of Flames descended from the sky, covered in flames. The flames spread recklessly under Mo Fan’s control, setting the moths in their path on fire and turning the sky into an ocean of flames!

Mo Fan dashed toward Yu Shishi with a blazing sword formed with both flames!

Mo Fan swept the sword down. The heat surged forward like a tide; Yu Shishi was unable to dodge it in time. Moths quickly gathered in front of her like walls to defend her!

The flames surged wildly, their force knocked Yu Shishi flying. It was impossible to tell how many moths had just died to the flames. Mo Fan was completely unstoppable against insects by abusing the flames of the Ardent Sunset. Even the spiderwebs of the Carnelian-Head Spider were not as effective as his flames!

Yu Shishi was not too strong on her own. She was swaying wildly in the air and had to rely on the moths for support.

“Since you didn’t kill the townsfolk, if you are willing to give the energy back to the kids, I’ll consider sparing your life!” Mo Fan lifted the fiery sword and pointed it at Yu Shishi. His flames showed no sign of dissipating, forcing the moths away from him!
