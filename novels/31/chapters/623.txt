When Liu Ru mentioned that she could help him with the recovery, Mo Fan subconsciously recalled the scenes of man and woman cultivating together by utilizing the balance of Yin and Yang from both sides in Wuxia or Xianxia stories. Since the Blood Tribe had originated from the west, it was likely that they had their own secret arts too.

Mo Fan seemed fairly collected on the surface, but he was actually overjoyed inside, with an expression saying, “I’m going to lie down. You can do whatever you want, I don’t really understand the details.”

“I’ll go and catch a few phantoms back. I can draw the energy of their souls and replenish the energy of your Spiritual World. You should be able to recover fairly quickly,” said Liu Ru.

“Oh, is your body alright now?” said Mo Fan, raising his brows.

“Yeah, it’s fine now,” replied Liu Ru, showing Mo Fan the scar on her arm. The arm that was obviously burned before was now tender and smooth as jade!

Mo Fan kept hearing how extraordinary the Blood Tribe’s recuperative ability was, and now he finally believed it. The woman who looked weak just a moment ago suddenly became as strong and healthy as a cat, and nimbly flew out of the house.

Mo Fan was indeed tired. Although his mind was occupied with lewd thoughts still, his sleepiness grew stronger with the warmth. He laid down on the bed and fell deeply asleep.

Normally, Mo Fan would be slightly more alert, since the city was no longer safe. However, his only thought after being spiritually worn out was to get himself a good sleep. He completely forgot about the heavy rain and chilly rain outside, the zombies roaming on the streets, and the Nether Bone Ruler!

——

Dark clouds invaded the Ancient Capital, bringing utter destruction to the city.

Cold rain poured down like arrows, corroding the foundation of the Ancient Capital.

Most terrifyingly, the undead climbing out from the tombs, cemeteries, burial grounds, and barrows were not willing to leave, filling the land that was soaking wet from the rain. The previously magnificent outer walls were like a fragile dam, standing no chance against the fierce tide of undead!

The outer walls were thoroughly destroyed. The thick walls stacked up with bricks collapsed, the tall towers fell tumbling to the ground, not to mention the buildings on the streets...

When observing from the inner walls, the area over ten kilometers from the Ancient Capital was completely covered by the black ocean. The tide of undead burst through the buildings, streets, public squares, parks, schools, hospitals to the ground, and not a single corpse was left!

The undead finally invaded the city from all directions. The scariest thing was not the pace at which the ocean of undead was devouring the city, but the fact that after the black tide had entered the city, the whole land was still covered in black moving figures with no visible ends. One could not help but doubt if humans were the actual invaders of this land...

“Pack, horde, kingdom...an undead kingdom. An undead kingdom,” an aged voice mumbled softly on the observation tower, sounding more like a prayer of death uttered for the city’s sake.

Could it be that the Ancient Capital, which had existed for thousands of years, was finally going to be erased from history on this rainy day?

The undead extending all the way into the horizon had already overrun the city. Was this golden barrier really able to stop the invasion of the countless undead?

Besides, what exactly had awakened every undead from up to over a thousand years ago, resulting in this undead calamity that had brought so much despair to the living?

“Being able to control so many undead... was the king of this undead kingdom awakened?” asked Councilman Zhu Meng with an extremely pale face.

“What matters is which era is this king of the undead kingdom from, I hope it’s not that,” replied the president of the Clock Tower Magic Association, Han Ji, with a sigh.

“President, are you referring to...” asked Commander Lu Xu with a frown.

“Something with the same age as this city,” Han Ji did not answer the question, as he was extremely reluctant to believe his speculation.

“It’s impossible to kill all the undead. The barrier of the inner city won’t last for long either, especially when the Ruler-level undead are attacking it... The strongest undead we have seen so far is the Mountain Zombie. It keeps pitching the Flesh Mound Corpse Officials into the city from the north,” said the elder of the Hunter Union, Ling Xi.

Ling Xi was still an attractive Battlemaga despite her age. Her fair skin implied that she had put in a great effort in skin care, yet the crow’s feet at the corner of her eyes were obvious, as if all her age and experience had settled there. She did not show any fear like other Battlemagas, nor did she act calm and collected like an authority figure. She was simply stating the facts expressionlessly.

“We’ll leave the Mountain Zombie to the captain of the Imperial Magicians. He’s the strongest among us. I believe even the Mountain Zombie is intimidated by him, since they have fought each other in the past,” said Han Ji.

“My people will deal with the Demon Horns Phantom Lord in the south,” said Ling Xi.

“What about the west? Has the creature showed itself?” asked Zhu Meng.

“It must be some phantom that excels at staying hidden. We haven’t seen its true appearance, but the whole place was overrun by phantoms, Phantom Generals, and Phantom Officials. We couldn’t see anything at all, but the place was already covered in corpses,” reported the patriarch of the Li Clan, Li Yujian.

It was common for the factions to compete with one another, but in times like this, every faction would stand together to share both the honor and disgrace.

A pharmacist in a white coat came up hurriedly, and spoke out without being called on, “Councilman Zhu Meng, your speculation is right, there’s something wrong with the rain! Our pharmaceutical experts have detected something known as the Dew of Nine Serenities. If the undead were active in the day, there must be a strong presence of death allowing them to breathe normally, but when the rain pours down, the Dew of Nine Serenities is providing them energy!...”.

“It’s really the rain?” Zhu Meng was astounded.

“The rain is causing it?” Han Ji glanced at the rain in disbelief.

The whole Ancient Capital was the least alert at dawn. If the army of undead had launched the attack at night instead, the city would not have crumbled so quickly.

The rain had allowed the undead to move in the day. How vicious was the person behind the scheme, to use the rain just after the outer walls had gone through an exhaustive battle the night before!

“It’s really the same as the Calamity of Bo City.” Zhu Meng’s voice sank.

-The Black Vatican, it must be them!-

“It’s not the same...” an unfamiliar voice joined the conversation between the authorities.

The crowd turned around and saw a man wrapped in tight clothes slowly walking towards them. His glittering eyes seemed to know the truth to everything.

“Who are you?” asked Han Ji with an indifferent glance.

The man obviously did not plan to reveal his identity. He glanced at the people in the tower without answering Han Ji’s question and continued, “Bo City was only Salan’s experimental ground.”

The man paused briefly. He added after seeing the confusion on everyone’s face, “It was only a test run for this cautiously planned disaster here at the Ancient Capital!”

A test run!

The Calamity of Bo City was only a test run!
