There was plenty of magic on the chessboard, allowing everyone to use their spells.

However, those whom the black strings were attached to were weakened. Their spells, both for offensive and defensive purposes were affected. Even their Casting speed had slowed down too.

Normally, a thousand Mages would still stand a chance against a dozen Dreadful Curse Cerberi, but the restraints had made it easier for the Dreadful Curse Cerberi to tear through the wall of humans and break through their defense.

Blood, broken limbs, and organs were scattered across the tile. The Dreadful Curse Cerberi were extremely savage. They had a natural drive to tear their prey into pieces. Their three heads fought fiercely to claim their targets.

Some people’s heads were on one side while their bodies were stuck under the Dreadful Curse Cerberi’s claws. The heads of the Dreadful Curse Cerberi were munching the broken limbs. It was a terrifying sight.

The one-eyed old man’s face turned pale. He had done everything he could to motivate the people. They were doing their best to fend off the Dreadful Curse Cerberi, but their defense was overwhelmed so easily.

It had turned into a one-sided massacre!

The mentality of humans was inferior to the Darkness Creatures, not to mention the restraint that had weakened the humans by thirty percent. The Dreadful Curse Cerberi could easily break through their defense and crush their morale by charging at them fiercely.

The restraint basically meant the defender was going to lose the battle. It was terrible.

The pawn did not have many people left, but only three Dreadful Curse Cerberi had died.

The other pawns began to lose their confidence. The Dreadful Curse Cerberi seemed a lot stronger than them!

In just a few rounds, Mu Bai lost two pawns. Both battles were close to a slaughter.

Two thousand corpses were littered across the ground. The strong smell of blood further set off the hellish sight.

“Knights, attack!” Mu Bai yelled. He was using his knights.

His knights were Asha’ruiya and her Dark Swordmaster.

The knights were the attackers. Asha’ruiya entered the tile that was littered with dead bodies.

The black strings soon stuck to the Dreadful Curse Cerberi. Their ferocious Aura after the bloodbath was weakened.

Counterattack!

Asha’ruiya drew out a black sword. A dark light wrapped around her alluring body and formed a suit of tight-fitting armor!

“One-Word Slash!”

Asha’ruiya was like an elegant but fierce sword empress. An icy flicker swept at a Dreadful Curse Cerberus as she took a step forward.

The arrogant Dreadful Curse Cerberus pounced at Asha’ruiya.

The slash went right through the creature’s forehead. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It went from the Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ neck to its tail and split it perfectly in half.

“That’s...that’s incredible, she killed it with a single slash!” The watching Mages were dumbfounded.

The Mages only realized how terrifying the Dreadful Curse Cerberi were after fighting them. A single Dreadful Curse Cerberus could easily slaughter a hundred Mages. Even the Advanced Mages among them had failed to survive.

However, the woman who was chosen to be a knight had killed a Dreadful Curse Cerberus with a single move!

“Shadow Moon Sword!”

The sword Asha’ruiya was using was no ordinary weapon. Mo Fan had already had a taste of it during the World College Tournament.

However, her skills had improved significantly over the years. It felt like her attacks were stronger than her Dark Swordmaster’s.

She sliced off the heads of three Dreadful Curse Cerberi with ease. Nine heads rolled to the edge of the tile, close to another pawn.

The Mages were excited.

It turned out they had strong allies on their side, too! A dozen Dreadful Curse Cerberi did not live for more than a few minutes against Asha’ruiya’s sword.

The Dark Ice Swordmaster was also slaughtering the Dreadful Curse Cerberi on the other side. He had also overwhelmed the Dreadful Curse Cerberi. His sword was not as elegant and thin as Asha’ruiya’s, as he was using a heavy broadsword.

The broadsword slammed on the ground. It cracked open as a dark Aura surged at the Dreadful Curse Cerberi in ferocious waves.

The dark Aura soon turned into a tornado and blew six of the Dreadful Curse Cerberi into the air. The strong winds shredded them to pieces. Blood poured down from the sky like rain.

Both Asha’ruiya and the Dark Ice Swordmaster brutally slaughtered the Dreadful Curse Cerberi.

After all, knights were supposed to be stronger than pawns, especially when the Dreadful Curse Cerberi’s strength was weakened by thirty percent while they were under attack.

The knights had a bigger range of movement, and were not limited to only moving forward.

Mu Bai had not sacrificed the two pawns so Asha’ruiya and the Dark Ice Swordmaster could take out the enemy pawns. He had already moved his pieces to the best spots, where they were protected by other pieces.

However, the unpredictable Lord of Darkness had insisted on attacking with the Dreadful Curse Cerberi, even though he already knew the risks. Both sides had suffered casualties as a result.

“I might need to use you aggressively for us to win the game,” Mu Bai told his knights.

“Just move me as you please. You don’t have to worry too much,” Asha’ruiya responded.

“Alright, keep attacking. I want you to take out an enemy knight,” Mu Bai said.

Knights were special among the pieces because of their special movement pattern. They were more useful than rooks and queens in certain situations, if they were used properly.

Mu Bai knew the Lord of Darkness would continue to trade pieces with him if he kept playing defense. It would be meaningless if he won the game while losing too many of the pieces.

It was not a fair game of chess. Not only did Mu Bai have to win the match, he also had to preserve as many pieces as he could!

He had to dominate the game, and outsmart his opponent.

Asha’ruiya and the Dark Ice Swordmaster might be orioles to the enemy pawns, but Mu Bai had also calculated his next move. He had moved the knights to advantageous positions after killing the enemy pawns.

Asha’ruiya and the Dark Swordmaster were out of range of the enemy’s pieces, but they were still able to attack the enemy.

The Lord of Darkness was going to suffer the consequences of his reckless playstyle!

“I’m right behind you!” Sharjah told Asha’ruiya.

“Mm, I’ll clear a path for you all,” Asha’ruiya said.

She had regrouped with the Dark Swordmaster on the left side of the board. The two knights were taking care of one another with Sharjah, a rook, protecting their rear.

Mu Bai had to think carefully before making a move, and he had to predict the enemy’s moves as well….
