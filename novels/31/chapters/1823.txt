Zhao Manyan was very adept at powering the boat along with his Water Magic. The waves were fierce, but the boat was moving steadily ahead. Therefore, Jiang Shaoxu and Mo Fan could still cast some of their spells.

The sapphire-eyed Manta Ray Evil Birds were not just some low-intelligence creatures. They did not all follow Tangyue blindly. Around three hundred of them stayed behind and circled above the boat and the water ahead of it. Their cries resembled the sound of a door knock, and were coming at a high frequency. The group was extremely annoyed by them.

Zhao Manyan pointed at the Manta Ray Evil Birds in the sky and shouted, “They are spinning!”

The Manta Ray Evil Birds started to spin in the sky. Their wings were just like blades when they were extended. The creatures seemed to be experts at controlling the wind. They would produce a strong wind when they were spinning at a high speed, which further increased the area covered by their attacks!

Some time later, the terrifying sound of a helicopter’s propellers was audible. The whole group of Manta Ray Evil Birds was making the same noise. The strength of the winds was like a hurricane on the sea, reversing the direction of the waves that were initially heading toward the island.

The Manta Ray Evil Birds maintained their distance from one another, as if they had undergone training. They positioned themselves in a V-shaped formation.

The Manta Ray Evil Birds were not small. They were able to form a whirling blade wind with a diameter of around ten meters when they were spinning. When a few dozen Manta Ray Evil Birds formed a V-shaped formation like a fleet of jets, the people on the swaying little boat had a feeling that they were done for!

“Old Zhao, Old Zhao, dodge it, quick!” Jiang Shaoxu screamed.

It felt like axes were hanging right above their necks on a scaffold. The Manta Ray Evil Birds’ cooperation was utterly shocking. They seemed to possess some of the traits of migratory birds. They were superb at positioning themselves in a formation and flying in groups.

Mo Fan finally understood why Zhao Manyan was in such a miserable state when he was attacked by the Manta Ray Evil Birds. A few Manta Ray Evil Birds would not pose any threat to them, but when there were a few dozen or a hundred of them attacking at the same time, they could even slice through a mountain and leave it with a flat top!

“How am I supposed to dodge it!?” Zhao Manyan yelled.

Could they stop relying on him for everything? There were three f**king Super Mages among them!

The super V-shaped formation was huge enough to cover the whole surface of the ocean ahead. It was not something he could dodge as he pleased!

“Plummeting Rays!” Zhao Manyan kept charging forward, now pointing his finger at the sky!

A brilliant light fell from the night sky and scattered like pieces in front of the boat. The pieces stacked together and eventually formed a web encapsulating the boat.

The Plummeting Rays kept falling. Every time a piece was added, the barrier would get stronger. Zhao Manyan’s protection thoroughly covered the boat as the Manta Ray Evil Birds were approaching!

The Manta Ray Evil Birds landed their blows on Zhao Manyan’s Plummeting Rays, producing screeching noises, like the sound of something cutting through metal. Golden sprinkles were sparking from the barrier!

The Manta Ray Evil Birds dove into the water in a V-shaped formation after their first round of attacks. An enormous hole was driven into the surface of the sea!

They dove deep into the water at an instant. When the water filled up the hole, the Manta Ray Evil Birds were nowhere to be seen.

However, the people on the boat were not relieved. Jiang Shaoxu suddenly yelled, “Under the boat, you have to protect its bottom too!”

“It’s too late!” Mo Fan immediately drew silver Star Patterns when he realized something did not feel right. The gorgeous Star Patterns circled him and eventually combined into a brilliant Star Constellation.

Following a shudder, Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, Lingling, Jiang Shaoxu, Mu Bai, and Chen Shuo vanished following a silver flicker, leaving the boat swaying on the violent waves.

A second later, the sound of propellers came from under the water.

BANG!

The waves were still rolling without any splashes. The blast of wind produced by the fleet of Manta Ray Evil Birds shredded the boat into pieces. Not only was the boat destroyed, its remains were shredded into tiny dust!

The Manta Ray Evil Birds sprang into the sky. It felt like they were going to tear the night sky in half. When they reached their highest point, they immediately locked onto Mo Fan and the others, who were floating above the water.

Mo Fan had brought the group a few hundred meters away with Blink. However, he still needed some time for the energy around him to calm down before he could cast Blink again. He was unable to stabilize the energy of the space he arrived in right away.

“They are coming again!” Lingling automatically climbed onto Mo Fan’s back while pointing at the spinning axes diving from the sky.

“Lightning chains!” Mo Fan emitted lightning arcs, gathering the Lightning Magic in the sky, forming chains that intertwined with one another as they spread across the sky. The chains were randomly attacking the Manta Ray Evil Birds along their path!

When the Manta Ray Evil Birds were going through Mo Fan’s lightning, they suddenly dispersed in order to avoid the area where the lightning was densest.

The V-shaped formation had broken, but that did not stop the Manta Ray Evil Birds from attacking. They began to attack the invaders irregularly. Those who failed their attempts would dive into the water and use it as cover while preparing for their next attempt.

The attacks coming from different angles and directions were exactly what Zhao Manyan had described before. The endless boomerangs felt like a rain of arrows!

“How far are we from the island?” Mo Fan asked. He was unable to use his full strength.

“Just a kilometer, but even if we can fly, we will still be shredded into mincemeat. These creatures are just too violent,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“AHHHH, don’t let me get my hands on them, or I’m going to turn them all into a stew!” Zhao Manyan snarled. He had enough of these Manta Ray Evil Birds!
