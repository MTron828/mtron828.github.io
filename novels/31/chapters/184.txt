Chapter 186 - Take Them Down in One Swoop!

Mo Fan ran very quickly, he didn’t properly hear what Lingling’s last few words were.

After going into the indoor basketball court, Mo Fan opened the door and heard the sounds of balls bouncing in the court.

“Damn, there are actually girls playing basketball here! I can have them help me fight the three green demoness!” Mo Fan increased his speed as he ran toward the middle of the basketball court.

The floor was so clean that it could be used as a mirror. After Mo Fan ran into the basketball court, he realized there were a group of girls in the middle of a game. It looked relatively fierce.

Mo Fan was bursting with joy. Even as he was shouting, he heard a collision coming from the place he had passed through just moments ago. He reckoned it must be a couple of green demoness who had knocked over the large garbage can!

“Ladies, please stop playing basketball for now. There are three Magical Beasts coming this way, we must join hands to defeat them!” Mo Fan ran to the middle of the basketball and shouted to the group of girls playing basketball.

After saying this, he turned around with a slight smile as he looked at the three arrogant green demoness.

Do you really think I’d be scared of you with your numbers? I have even more helpers here!

The three green demoness had charged in, their triangular eyes fixed on Mo Fan, who was standing in the middle of the basketball court looking very pleased with himself.

They opened their mouths, but they did not advance.

“Ssssss~~!!”

“SSSSSSS!!!!!!!”

They let out some weird noises in Mo Fan’s direction.

At this moment, everyone who was still playing basketball stopped, staring at the three demoness in shock. It was clear that they did not expect this place to have actual Magical Beasts appearing.

However, before they could even react to this, they looked as though they had been hit by some magic spell. Every single one of them fell down to the floor in pain while letting out some strange noises.

“Fan Mo, didn’t I tell you? The basketball court… is filled with red dots!” At this moment, Lingling’s voice came through at the worst time.

What? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It’s filled with red dots?

That means the girls who are practicing basketball next to me…

Sh*t!

Mo Fan hastily turned around, an expression which couldn’t be described by words on his face.

The girls playing basketball had all fallen to the floor. They began to painfully twist their bodies under the cries of the three demonesses.

Their nails grew longer, and they used them to tear open their delicate skin!

As their skin were torn, green scales were visible beneath!

Mo Fan was dumbstruck when he saw this scene. This feeling was similar to having a couple of antagonists finally revealing themselves in front of him. The scene was incredibly frightening, even his scalp had started to feel numb!

Every single one of them had been turned!

Just now, it had been ten or so heroes surrounding the three demon creatures. In an instant, the white chess pieces had turned to black. Mo Fan became the single white piece, completely surrounded by the black pieces!

These creatures shed their skin very quickly. Mo Fan didn’t have time to cut open their thumbs.

All of the people playing basketball here were girls. He should’ve known that one of the girls would’ve been infected, and then infected the others.

He had thought he could use the students’ help to fight against the demons, but they all ended up turning into one of them instead.

If they all came for him, then he’d be torn to pieces!

“Fan Mo, are you able to fight against them?!” Lingling shouted in his ear.

“Definitely not!”

“What are you gonna do then?”

“I’ll run first!”

Mo Fan wasn’t stupid, he wasn’t gonna wait for all of the basketball girls to finish shedding and become demons!

He activated the Blood Beast Boots without hesitation. A layer of blood-colored light was clearly visible covering Mo Fan’s legs.

Mo Fan ran so fast that you could see smoke following him. Fortunately, the basketball court had another exit, or it would have become really troublesome.

The Blood Beast Boots saved Mo Fan’s life once more. The lights in the basketball court were too strong, finding a place with shadows was easier said than done. If it wasn’t for the Blood Beast Boots, then he would’ve lost his life right there, even if he used Intermediate Magic.

Furthermore, to use Intermediate Magic, it would take several seconds. By the time he finished, he would’ve been swallowed by the demonesses on the basketball court!

Mo Fan charged to the other exit. The exit seemed to be the passage for the athletes, leading to the resting area in the back.

The passage was relatively long and narrow. Just as Mo Fan ran inside, the green demoness had finished shedding. They didn’t act like basketball players, but more like rugby players who charged straight in!

Mo Fan ran straight to the end of the passage. When he saw the green demoness had followed him inside, his mouth perked up in a smile.

“Good, I’ll finish them in one swoop!

Mo Fan smiled madly, gazing these avaricious yet clearly dumb green demonesses.

“Rose Flame, Fiery Punch, Exploding Heavens!”

His body was instantly covered by captivating rose-colored flames. Mo Fan had turned into a human torch, emitted extreme heat from the flames around him.

After shouting loudly, all of the Fiery Punch had gathered within his right hand!

“One, two, three, four, five… go die for me!”

Mo Fan threw the Fiery Punch out fiercely. The rather dark passage was instantly filled with the rose-flames as the gigantic Fiery Fist exploded forth and the entire passage seemed like it would collapse.

The two demonesses at the very front were engulfed in the flames as they let out miserable shrieks, they couldn’t dodge it even if they tried!

Mo Fan had slightly decreased the power of Fiery Fist, or else the two demoness in the front would’ve turned into ashes from the heat.

The force of the Fiery Fist pushed through, all five demoness who had entered the passage had all been scorched black as they were blasted far away.

The entire basketball court was lit up, and the reinforced glass within it displayed signs of cracking. The rumbling sound of the aftershock echoed inside.

“Amazing!” Lingling exclaimed, clearly pleased by this development.

“What did you say?!” Mo Fan’s ears were still buzzing, he couldn’t hear what Lingling said.

This Fiery Fist had directly blasted away five green demonesses. The offensive power behind it was naturally one of the highest of the Intermediate spells!

The thing was, there were two more demonesses who hadn’t entered the passage. However, because the power of Fiery Fist was simply too tyrannical, not only did it destroy the passage, it had even turned into a gigantic fire wave as it burst forth from the hallway. It had swept the other two demonesses up and and scorched them black as well.

“The strength and wisdom of these green demonesses are definitely not on par with the two we had encountered in that private garden. Especially the demoness that shed from the wife, not only was she fast, but she was incredibly sly,” Lingling said loudly to Mo Fan.

“These are at most Minion class. If there were more of them, then even I couldn’t do anything. The situation before was actually very dangerous!” Mo Fan replied calmly.
