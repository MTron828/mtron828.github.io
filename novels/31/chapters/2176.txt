A hundred-and-ten meter tall Silver Moon Tyrant Titan had arrived at Crete’s dock. Tuis purposely stood on the deck to be praised by the people of Crete.

However, he was in disbelief when the ship came to a stop. There were only a few white seagulls at the dock. It did not feel like they had just returned from a victorious battle. He felt stupid and awkward!

“Didn’t you tell them we are here?” Tuis demanded of Golden Sun Knight Lucas, who was standing beside him.

“Well, Mr. Tuis, I was told they found the culprit who destroyed Green Sprouts Island. It was a two-hundred-meter tall Cross Mark Demon Titan...” Lucas said.

“They found it? That’s not possible, there’s no one who could find it quicker than me. Did the Tyrant Titan lose its mind and confess to the military?” Tuis was surprised and flustered.

“I think it was... Mo Fan and his friends who found it. The Mages of Faith are already on their way to Crete. Even Great Muse Valentine will be here in person,” Lucas answered.

“Them? Those Asian monkeys who never stop talking?!” Tuis could not believe it.

“Either way, we should head back to the command center as soon as possible.”

Lucas was dumbfounded when he saw that no one had come to receive them after they had slain a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan, but that was before he learned someone had found the culprit for Green Sprouts Island. The whole of Crete must be in great shock!

“Mr. Mo Fan, we were a little suspicious when they said you had captured the Cold Prince, but you have settled such a complicated matter in a short period of time and found the culprit. Even I am impressed by you!” Great Muse Valentine complimented Mo Fan greatly.

“It’s not really complicated, but you should really look after your own lands while you are busy spreading your gospel across the world, to see if the roots have rotten,” Mo Fan replied casually.

Many people frowned when they heard Mo Fan’s words. Why was he scolding the Great Muse all of a sudden? The Saints might be more powerful than the Great Muse, but she was considered the teacher and senior of the Saints. None of them dared to speak to the Great Muse like that!

“It’s something the Parthenon Temple also feels helpless about, since we don’t interfere with the government or the military... Of course, it might sound like we are neglecting our responsibilities. After all, its our fault for lowering our guard against the Guild of the Wicked, which resulted in this tragedy. I, Valentine, promise everyone that I won’t allow any organization like the Guild of the Wicked to exist in Greece. Mo Fan, please be my supervisor. If I, Valentine, allow a tragedy like that to happen again, I am willing to accept any kind of punishment!” Great Muse Valentine declared.

Great Muse Valentine was being absolutely serious to say such a thing during the meeting at the command center. It was quite shocking that she had allowed someone who did not hold a significant role in the Parthenon Temple to be her supervisor. Wouldn’t that make Mo Fan a superior to the Hall Mother?

“We are a little tired. We are heading back to the Parthenon Temple first. I’ve already passed the evidence and information we have gathered to you. I’ll let you decide how to release it to the public,” Mo Fan said.

Tuis’ group happened to arrive after Mo Fan finished talking. He demanded an answer from Valentine with a sulking face.

Tuis turned into an unreasonable shrew after he received his reply. He insisted on looking into the matter himself, to see if Mo Fan was telling the truth!

“Tuis!” Valentine suddenly raised her voice.

Everyone was lenient toward Tuis most of the time. Even Valentine had sounded like a gentle senior in the past.

However, they had only let Tuis be because he had the potential to crack the case of Green Sprouts Island. The Parthenon Temple needed the people’s trust after the tragedy. If they could not resolve the case as soon as possible, they would only ruin their reputation, which they had built up painstakingly for many years!

The Parthenon Temple was furious after learning the truth from Mo Fan, but at the same time, they were relieved it was over!

The people who were demanding an answer from the Parthenon Temple would soon turn on the Guild of the Wicked. The Parthenon Temple only had to organize a group to take down the Guild of the Wicked by asking Mages across the world to join their cause.

As a result, the Parthenon Temple would no longer be considered unreliable. They would reclaim their reputation after taking out the branches of the Guild of the Wicked in Greece.

Mo Fan had helped the Parthenon Temple overcome a difficult situation.

What had Tuis managed to accomplish?

He had only killed two Silver Moon Tyrant Titans. They could just send a dozen Knights to kill Silver Moon Tyrant Titans if needed. Killing two Silver Moon Tyrant Titans was not going to do them any good!

Most importantly, Mo Fan had let the Parthenon Temple take the credit. It was going to restore trust in the Parthenon Temple among the people in Crete. The Temple would retain its status in Greece!

“Tuis, you should mind your words when you talk to Mo Fan from now on. You should be humble as a member of an ancient clan of the Parthenon Temple and respect those whom we are grateful to. After considering what you did to the Saint during the feast of the Snow Festival, I think it’s better for you to stay in Crete and reflect on your actions. You should also do something practical to build up your profile. Poseidon!” Great Muse Valentine called out.

“I’m here!” Poseidon saluted her.

“Keep an eye on your nephew. I hope he’s as impressive and humble as Mo Fan when I see him again,” Great Muse Valentine told him.

Tuis was ready to go crazy after hearing her words.

Everyone was fawning upon him when he first came to the Parthenon Temple. What were they thinking now, sending him to the borderland to prove his worth?

Tuis was about to lose his temper when Poseidon pressed his hand down on his shoulder. He said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “If you dare offend Great Muse Valentine here, you and our whole Tuis Clan will forever lose their place in the Parthenon Temple. Valentine didn’t take over Mellaura’s role because Mellaura made a mistake. She only took the risk because she knew she was going to lose her position!”
