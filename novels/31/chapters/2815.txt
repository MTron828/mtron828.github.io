Chapter 2817: Overeagerness Ruins The Growth

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

While not everyone could take the Underground Holy Spring and digest it, Mo Fan was the exception.

The intense warmth from the Underground Holy Spring attracted many demons to fight for it. Only the guardians of the Underground Holy Spring knew how to keep its energy well-hidden to prevent trouble.

Mo Fan took the Underground Holy Spring and prevented the spread of its energy. On top of that, he could use the Underground Holy Spring energy to accelerate his growth of cultivation instead of going through a long, arduous cultivation journey.

Did this not show that the Underground Holy Spring belonged to him?

Regardless of whether Mo Fan was a perfect match for the Underground Holy Spring and could absorb the spring energy through his physique, or there was something on him that enabled him to absorb the spring energy and possess the spring, it showed that Mo Fan was the one the guardians of the Underground Holy Spring had been waiting for.

Even if Mo Fan was not that person, so what?

The guardians of the Underground Holy Spring could not possibly continue to stand guard over the spring forever until it dried-up.

If that was the case, the Underground Holy Spring’s guardians might as well give the spring to the person they believed was the one to end the curse placed on them over thousands of years.

The guardians’ mission was accomplished when that person arrived and took the Underground Holy Spring. They no longer had to hide or fight among themselves because of the mysterious treasure. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Mo Fan, you don’t have to feel pressured. You came from Bo City. Uncle Zhuoyun is the person in charge of the Underground Holy Spring at Bo City. He will pass the spring down to Mu Ningxue sooner or later, and she is part of your family. It will eventually fall into your hands. The guardians of the Underground Holy Spring have assimilated, split, and disappeared over the years. So, it’s only normal that you be the one to protect the remaining Underground Holy Spring. You don’t have to care too much if you are truly the one they’ve been waiting for. If some day there comes that person who truly is for the spring, he will defeat you.” Mu Bai patted Mo Fan’s shoulder and tried to comfort him.

Mu Bai noticed that Mo Fan did not look pressured. In fact, Mo Fan was more than willing to take the place of the chosen one.

‘Why do I even need to comfort him?’ thought Mu Bai. He sighed. ‘It’s obvious he is enjoying the attention and the assumption. Even if he isn’t the right person, he will strive to become one.’

“Since you’ve said so, I’ll force myself to accept it, then!” Mo Fan smiled.

Song Feiyao did not know Mo Fan as well as Mu Bai. She nodded. “Hopefully we can find the remaining long-lost Underground Holy Springs so that you can dabble into the realm of Forbidden Curse.”

“Forbidden Curse?!” Mo Fan could not help but cry out loud.

“Isn’t the Earth Pistil required for the Forbidden Curse?” Mu Bai asked in confusion.

“The genuine Underground Holy Spring energy is as powerful as the Earth Pistil. In fact, Eldest Grandpa and Eldest Granny strongly believed that if I continue to cultivate in the Underground Holy Spring at Licheng Afterglow Island, I might be able to dabble into the realm of Forbidden Curse within ten years. However, I didn’t think so. Instead, I believe undue haste will only spoil the growth of my cultivation. I find my cultivation to be different compared to those who work hard to build their foundations and are familiar with magical skills, just like you two,” said Song Feiyao.

“Makes sense.”

Both Mo Fan and Mu Bai had experienced various fights to sharpen their skills. They continued to break through their cultivation in the middle of a crisis and stimulated their spiritual potential. Although they were young, they had a wealth of experience in combat compared to many old mages who lived in comfort.

Most people were selfish, lazy, and waited for others to provide for them. They strove hard in the beginning of their cultivation but when they had a decent life, they slacked off. Many people cultivated in their own backyards, or they relied on their own network, social status, and wealth to accumulate resources for their cultivation.

Even if they always secluded themselves from others to cultivate, they were always inferior to the mages who risked their lives in the battlefield. Cultivation based on resources would only ruin their growth.

Cultivation did not represent one’s real strength.

Even Mu Bai could defeat the so-called mages who had completed their cultivation, let alone Mo Fan with his large amount of Heaven Seeds.

By the time Mo Fan and Mu Bai completed their cultivation, their peers would be no match for them.

The reason Zhao Jing was a strong opponent was because his strength was on par with Mo Fan and Mu Bai.

They possessed Heaven Seeds, something that many third-grade Super Level mages desired!

While they could spend money to buy Soul Seeds, they could not do the same for Heaven Seeds. Sub-heaven Seeds alone were priceless, let alone the Great Heaven Seeds!

Besides, Song Feiyao had not achieved Super level for several of her elements.

Even though both Song Feiyao and Mo Fan were third grade Super Level mages, Mo Fan could inflict direct damage to a Supreme Ruler with his Fire element. Song Feiyao, on the other hand, could only peel off a layer of the Supreme Ruler’s skin.

The reason Song Feiyao agreed to follow Mo Fan and Mu Bai was not only to search for the Underground Holy Spring and totem beast, but also to gain some experience for herself.

She had a high level of cultivation, but she needed to strengthen herself by gaining more experience by venturing outside. She believed she still had a large room for improvement. Without practical experience, she could not reach the realm of Forbidden Curse even if she was provided with ten Underground Holy Springs.

Resting on one’s laurels was Licheng Afterglow Islanders’ biggest weakness. Song Feiyao knew this would only lead them to a dead end soon. They placed all their hope on the Underground Holy Spring. But the Underground Holy Spring would only bring them death. The moment the Ocean Demons arrived at their island, all of them would be wiped out and nobody would actually be able to fight.

Song Feiyao had never betrayed her people. All she did was find a way of survival for the islanders. Even though the road would be tough, at least they would be alive. She didn’t mind if none of them understood her purpose. It did not matter that they continued to misunderstand and blame her. She was fine with anything if Licheng Afterglow Islanders had a shot at survival.

…

“Mu Bai, did you go to Helan Mountain just to enjoy the scenery?” Mo Fan recalled.

“Actually, I heard about a type of bug in the valley of Helan Mountain. Its scientific name is…”

“Stop talking about the strange bug. Do you plan to find it during this trip?” asked Mo Fan.

“The valley at Helan Mountain is complicated. There are many fault valleys. It will consume a lot of time to find the bug. Moreover, we have something else to do,” said Mu Bai.

“Zhang Xiaohou hasn’t given us any clear clues. I don’t think we can help much even if we go to him. Let us go to the Bug Valley with you,” said Mo Fan.

“Will this…”

“We can’t find the totem beast in a day or two. What matters most is that our strengths have increased compared to the past. You were still too weak to go to the Bug Valley back then. But you’re different now. If your purpose is clear, with our current strengths, we won’t have to spend a lot of time in finding the bug,” said Mo Fan.

“Makes sense. Let’s go, then. There’s an entrance to the Bug Valley at the east of the Helan Mountain foothill.” Mu Bai nodded.

Song Feiyao had no qualms about it. After all, her purpose of venturing outside was to gain experience.
