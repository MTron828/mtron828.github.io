Tianshan Mountain liked the quiet. She seemed to be expressing her anger toward the outsiders who were making so much noise through the growing snowstorm. However, not everyone was showing enough respect to her. They were still going after their personal gains recklessly.

The alliance and the Heresy Judgment Court were not the only people in the Valley of Glaciers. Around two thousand people who had entered Tianshan Mountain at the same time as Mo Fan and his crew, not to mention those who came earlier or later. The snowstorm was just the first warning. The people at lower altitudes might not sense the mountain’s wrath yet, as they could only see the vast whiteness at the top of the mountain. However, it would be too late if they had just started to turn around when they felt the cold of the coming storm!

All of the old folks living close to Tianshan Mountain would tell outsiders to be respectful toward her. They had to leave without any hesitation when the storms came!

—

The storm was deadlier than any of them had imagined. Not only was it blocking the Mages’ vision, it had also blocked the path the alliance took to reach the top. It made the surface as deadly as the rifts!

The icy wind of the Valley of Glaciers was everyone’s main concern. They had to keep expending their energy to protect themselves, but the wind was like a spring breeze compared to the Desolate Wind of Death and the Icy Silk of Death in the rifts.

The Desolate Winds of Death had a strange pulling force that would interrupt any spell being Cast above a Star Pattern. It would then convert the energy of the spells into a stronger force, making it impossible for those who fell into the rifts to save themselves.

The Icy Silk of Death that would then wrap someone up like a frozen mummy in a brief period was even more merciless. It was like a pair of gentle yet merciless hands that put a spectacular suit of armor on outsiders, at the price of them staying behind forever.

Everyone’s life in the Desolate Ice Field was in danger because of the storm. The Mages rebelled when they learned the Nine Lights Formation was trapping them, and used everything they had to break down the magic Formation.

The Nine Lights Formation had been going for quite some time, all the while enduring the wrath of the storm, and was a lot weaker than when it was first established. The people of the alliance might not possess outstanding cultivation, but many of them were experts in magic Formations. Such Formations had always been a field of study open to the public. Constructing a powerful Formation was difficult, but breaking one down was a lot easier!

“The Formation has been broken! That was quicker than I thought!” Zhao Manyan blurted out excitedly.

“Who said an alliance with a common goal is the most reliable? The people are cooperating better when they are all in danger!” Mo Fan exclaimed. He had to admit that humans were a wonderful species. The Heresy Judgment Court’s Nine Lights Formation was specifically used to catch heretics, so breaking it down would have been as difficult as acquiring the Tianshan Sacred Lotus from the Nine Great Rifts.

“What about the Tianshan Sacred Lotus? We tried so hard to get here. How could we leave without a few of them so we can nurture our bodies once we are back?” Jiang Yu said.

“Do you think now is the time to worry about that? We should hurry and leave the mountain before it’s too late!” Zhao Manyan answered quickly.

“It’s indeed a pity if we leave empty-handedly... Huh, where did the little white rice dumpling go?” Mo Fan immediately recalled the little cub as soon as a greedy thought crossed his mind.

He had not seen the little cub for some time. He had no clue where she ran off to.

The little cub’s speed was comparable to the Night Rakshasa, so Mo Fan was not too worried about her safety. He was more concerned about the Night Amethyst that was crucial to saving Mu Bai’s life!

“Did her mother finally call her home for dinner? Damn it! We are screwed!” Mo Fan began to panic.

Mo Fan seriously did not want to see the Tianshan Scar White Tiger again. He had kidnapped its child right in front of it. It would still tear him into pieces and make a hand lotion with his remains, even though it had been kind to humans!

“Meow!~” the Night Rakshasa cried impatiently, signaling Mo Fan to look behind him.

Mo Fan turned around and saw a chubby round figure running toward him. The terrifying Desolate Wind of Death had no effect on it, as if its elegant white fur was immune to the wind.

The little cub shook her head while springing on her short limbs. She tripped and rolled on the ground before arriving before Mo Fan’s feet like a ball.

“You naughty little kid, can you stop running around? I’m more worried about you than your parents. You had your fun, isn’t it time to... huh, what do you have in your mouth there?” Mo Fan picked up the little cub and was about to scold her when he saw her holding a crystalline plant in her mouth like a handsome dancer holding a rose between his lips.

The plant was around the size of a rose. It was thoroughly white, including its stem. Its petals had an attractive gleam to them, and were packed closely together in an orderly fashion.

Guan Yu stuck his face closer and blurted out in astonishment, “It is said the Tianshan Sacred Lotus only grows a full petal every one hundred years. Hurry up and count the petals!”

“One...two...three...four...five...six...seven! Holy crap, isn’t this the seven-hundred-year-old Tianshan Sacred Lotus everyone is looking for!?” Mo Fan opened his eyes so wide that they almost fell out of the sockets.

The others were dumbfounded too!

A seven-hundred-year-old Tianshan Sacred Lotus was the biggest reward that the Heresy Judgment Court had promised the alliance. Where did the little cub find it?

“She seems to be immune to the Desolate Wind of Death and the Icy Silk of Death. She’s blessed by Tianshan Sacred Lotus! She can easily pluck up the Tianshan Sacred Lotuses, just like plucking cabbages in her backyard!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

Mo Fan turned restless after hearing those words. He suddenly proposed, “I have a crazy idea.”

“Are you sure we shouldn’t leave the mountain as soon as possible?” Ai Jiangtu asked hesitantly.

“Sure, you may leave first,” Mo Fan agreed.

“I’ll stay around for a little longer,” Ai Jiangtu thought it over quickly.

Mo Fan might have a bold idea, but the little cub was reluctant to cooperate. From the way she was waving her limbs around, she was saying that it took her a great effort just to pluck the beautiful flower. Mo Fan had to bring her to somewhere more entertaining if he wanted her help.

“Mo Fan, I have a question,” Zhao Manyan suddenly thought of something. He interrupted while Mo Fan was imagining himself carrying a sack of Tianshan Sacred Lotus on his back.

“Nothing is more important right now. Let’s figure out a way to convince her,” Mo Fan said.

“Wait, did you not realize the little cub can only hold one thing in her mouth at a time. If she took the Tianshan Sacred Lotus, what about the Night Amethyst she was carrying initially?” Zhao Manyan pointed out.

Mo Fan shuddered after hearing the words!
