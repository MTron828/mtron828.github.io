“Was that bald man suspicious of us?” Mo Fan asked Apas when they were going up the stairs.

“He’s cursing you to suffer from impotence. He’s also imagining who he would choose if Sister Mu Ningxue and I were standing in front of him,” Apas replied.

“How filthy...” Mo Fan sniffed.

What about you?” Apas smiled, thoroughly unleashing her coquettish aura. Mo Fan suddenly felt like he was in a colorful hut where a naked snake demon was rubbing herself against his body.

“Of course I’m going to choose Mu Ningxue. I prefer mature women,” Mo Fan replied without any hesitation.

“Is that so? Why is it different from the imagination I saw in your mind? Mm, I like the thrill you are after too, as long as you can convince Sister Mu...” Apas stuck her face closer to Mo Fan’s ear and whispered into it. Mo Fan could feel the moistness of her hot breath.

Mo Fan felt a surge of electricity running amok in his body before gathering at a specific part.

“(Cough cough), that’s enough, we are here for some serious business. Stop hugging me, it’s bad if Mu Ningxue sees us!” Mo Fan ordered her quickly.

“I want to go for a walk, on my own,” Apas exclaimed.

“It’s not happening,” Mo Fan replied.

“Then I’ll keep hugging you then. I always hugged you like this before you two became a couple. Why can’t I do it now?” Apas complained.

“Just go, but you must be back here when I call for you!” Mo Fan was left with no choice.

“Mm, I know my master is the best!” Apas stood on her toes. She purposely waited until Mu Ningxue turned the corner before kissing Mo Fan on the cheek. She then blushed and ran away, as if she had accidentally let Mu Ningxue see it.

Mo Fan’s eyes widened. Apas had still managed to set him up in the end!

Mu Ningxue came up to him like nothing had happened.

Mo Fan looked at her. She always wore an icy and expressionless face, whether she was angry or not. Mo Fan could not help but feel like there was no point explaining himself, not to mention he was guilty all along!

“She did it on purpose. Don’t mind it,” Mo Fan said awkwardly, scratching his head.

“I know,” Mu Ningxue said calmly.

As expected of his first wife, she was not fussed about the fighting and scheming among his concubines. Mo Fan let out a relieved sigh. He was about to follow Mu Ningxue into her room and discuss their plan of sneaking into the residence of a high-ranking official when the door slammed right in his face after Mu Ningxue went inside!

“S**t!” Mo Fan had almost knocked his nose on the door!

The owner’s eyes glittered when Apas came downstairs.

He had decided to pick Apas after a long hesitation. He had begun to have wild thoughts about gorgeous Western women after living in Europe for a long time.

“My honored mistress, if you need a guide... I’m more than willing to serve you for free,” the owner offered to her.

“That won’t be necessary, thank you for making a wise choice,” Apas giggled.

The owner was stunned. The seductive young girl was already gone, even though her giggles were still echoing in his ears... ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Not every beauty was the kind that would dazzle a person and trigger a strong reaction in them. Most people would only take a quick glimpse of them, leaving a nice impression in their mind. However, they would recall the person’s good looks in the following days, months, or even years. The more times they recalled, the deeper they would sink, before they finally lost themselves.

Apas was obviously the second kind of beauty!

——

Apas left the inn, which was very close to the Sacred Residence. She wove adeptly through the complicated alleys.

She stopped in front of a shop selling delicate wigs and cosmetics. The bell on the door rang as she went inside.

A few female tourists were looking around in the shop. The female owner was sitting in front of the cashier, wearing thick makeup and a fake smile. She kept watching the women who were browsing the products in the store, as if her customers were the real products on sale.

The owner immediately shifted her attention to Apas when she came inside. Her calm but invasive eyes began to glow, as if she had finally found some satisfying prey.

“Oh my, you’re the rarest customer I have had in the past fifty years. How did you know I have a shop here? Is there something you are after in my shop? That doesn’t make any sense. The things I sell are nowhere as real and pretty as the ones you have. Do you have any idea how much I desire to put you on so every woman in the Sacred City will be jealous of me and every man will fall for me?” the woman said with great joy.

“You’ve been doing this for a few hundred years. It’s a little difficult not to know where your shops are.” Apas had lost her usual appearance of an innocent and lively girl, and her face was cold and hard.

“Hehe, you are familiar with your elder sister’s business, indeed. Quick, help me choose: that girl in a blue shirt; I like her innocent-looking eyes, but unfortunately, she isn’t a blondie... and the one at the back there, her legs are slim and long. I can easily dazzle a lot of men in my swimsuits.” The woman was smiling so much that her eyes were no longer visible.

“You can consider paying a visit to Korea. You will most likely find something better there. You can also murder fewer people, since you won’t have to be suspicious of people all the time,” Apas answered.

“I will miss a lot of fun there. I doubt you are here because you missed me. By the way, did something happen to you? Why does your presence feel like a crossbred lascivious snake? I even sent the Cruel Ocean Serpent to take care of you, but you beat up my favorite Friday night lover instead!” the woman said in mock sincerity.

“My safety doesn’t concern you!” Apas snapped back.

“How can I not be worried? You’re my most favorite younger sister. I will be mad if our eldest sister takes away your beautiful skin!” the woman exclaimed.

Apas did not respond. She glared at the woman with her sparkling golden eyes.

The woman’s eyes also transformed after she sensed Apas’ hostility. They went from dark brown to golden with a frightening light!

“I know what you want to ask me... our mother’s corpse is already cold, so she won’t be able to protect you any longer. You can roam around the world like a pitiful cat as you please, but there’s nowhere safe for you in Europe, except for the Sacred City!” The golden sparkles in the woman’s eyes slowly faded away.

“Euryale, I’m going to kill you and Cessna, just like you killed my godmother!” Apas snarled back at her.
