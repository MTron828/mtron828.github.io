“Let’s visit the Magic City,” Mo Fan proposed.

“Sure, I have to see someone from the Mui Clan, too,” Xinxia nodded in agreement.

Mo Fan was a little lost after hearing about the sudden changes. For now, he just wanted to meet his friends and let them know he was still alive.

Hangzhou and the Magic City had been connected as a Headquarters City. The railways between the two cities greatly shortened the journey between them.

Mo Fan could reach the Pearl Institute quickly with his Space Magic, but he was going to take a look around the city after hearing what Xinxia had said.

——

The city was still standing. It seemed like the plan of establishing Headquarters Cities was a success. The tall dam guarded by the military and Mages was preventing the sea monsters from invading their territory.

Mo Fan was a little relieved. The food stalls and restaurants he fancied were still operating!

“It’s very close to the battlefield,” Mo Fan said after checking out the dam.

“Mm, the sea monsters have brought us resources that are scarce on land, helping the Research Union invent stronger barriers and magic Formations. It’s a relief that more innocent people did not have to die in the war,” Xinxia sighed.

“Your Grace, someone has recognized you,” the female knight with a straight face whispered to her.

Mo Fan looked around the cabin and saw a few women looking in their direction occasionally. They were also searching for information on their phones. They seemed shocked and excited.

“Perhaps they recognized me. I’m quite popular in the country too...” Mo Fan smiled.

A tall woman in the group came over to their seats nervously before Mo Fan could finish his sentence.

“Excuse me, are you... Ye Xinxia?” the woman stared at Xinxia. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Mo Fan was left speechless.

Did he have a common face or something? The things he had done had shocked the whole world, yet most people that came up to him were only looking for trouble instead of asking for his signature!

“Mm, can I help you?” Xinxia nodded calmly.

“I... my friends and I are thinking of enrolling in the Parthenon Temple.”

“You will have to work hard, then. You have a solid foundation. You should be able to pass the test if you are able to handle it calmly.”

“Thank you, can I take a picture with you?”

“I’m afraid I can’t do that for now.”

“Then...”

The female knight, Waris, took a step forward like a bodyguard stopping fans from disturbing a celebrity’s privacy.

The woman smiled apologetically. She asked for a signature instead and went back to her seat to share her achievement with her friends.

“Have you ever met some fans whose faces would change instantly?” Mo Fan asked her.

“She hates me, even though she seemed quite friendly,” Xinxia sighed.

“Huh? Oh!”

Mo Fan had almost forgotten Xinxia was a talented Psychic Mage. She could easily read someone’s mind through their fake expressions, even when she was not using magic.

“She mentioned she wants to enroll in the Parthenon Temple. Is the Parthenon Temple Institute open to the public? How come I never heard of that before?” Mo Fan asked quietly.

Xinxia was able to join the Parthenon Temple because someone had planned it on purpose. In reality, the conditions to enroll in the Parthenon Temple were stricter than most institutes in Europe. It recruited most of its members among the locals in Greece. It never opened the registration to other countries!

“The Parthenon Temple Institute is indeed restructuring. We referred to the Alps Institute’s structure and decided to take in brilliant students from different countries through our branches across the world,” answered Tata, who’d had her eyes closed throughout the ride. She added arrogantly, “But a lot of people are too narrow-minded. Her Grace has put in a lot of work to open the door of the Parthenon Temple Institute to people of other nationalities, but some people still complain that the spots are too limited.”

“You can never please everyone,” Xinxia could only agree.

“It seems like the relationship between the Parthenon Temple and the Alps Institute has improved while I was away!” Mo Fan was pleased to hear that.

The Alps Institute and the Parthenon Temple shared the same purpose. They both aimed to deliver the world from suffering. It was unnecessary for them to remain hostile to one another.

After arriving at the Pearl Institute, Mo Fan was glad that his apartment was still in perfect condition. It had been his first home in the Magic City, and he had purposely chosen an area he liked. It was away from the busy streets, but close to the bustling Jing’An District.

Since the apartment was located on the school grounds, it was common to see young students in fashionable and exposing clothes. Mo Fan enjoyed meditating on the balcony. He would look around to see if he could find any surprises whenever he was taking a break.

“The Mui Clan has a wedding tonight. Brother Mo Fan, are you going? I’m invited,” Xinxia asked.

“Huh? She’s getting married?” Mo Fan exclaimed in surprise.

No wonder the two golden sparrows in his unit were gone. They had taken all their belongings, so they must have moved out.

Mo Fan had to admit he was a little sad about it.

Mo Fan had preserved his integrity and avoided being devoured by the two women’s charms, but he was feeling a little down when he realized he would no longer hear their voices.

In the end, she was going to marry someone else!

“It’s Mui Nuxin’s wedding,” Xinxia pouted when she saw Mo Fan’s reaction.

“It doesn’t matter whose wedding it is. The Mui Clan has been working together with Fanxue Mountain for a long time. I should congratulate them,” Mo Fan regained his smile.

“Ningxue is going too. Does she know you are back?” Xinxia inquired.

“I...I didn’t dare to tell her,” Mo Fan replied awkwardly.

Mo Fan had not let Lingling tell anyone about his trip to Dubai.

Xinxia and Little Flame Belle were sharing a heart, thus she was able to learn how Mo Fan was doing through her, but Mu Ningxue was completely clueless about his whereabouts.

Mu Ningxue must have learned he had left the Dark Plane from Mu Bai. He was wondering how he should explain why he had left without saying a word. He did not think he could explain it clearly on the phone.

“But I already told Ningxue!” Xinxia waved her phone.

Mo Fan’s face twisted.

Great, he had committed another serious offense in not giving Mu Ningxue a call as soon as he came back!

“When will she be there?” Mo Fan asked, resigned.

“She’s already at the Mui Clan.”

“Fine, we should be going now.”

“The others should be there, too.. Brother Mo Fan, it’s the perfect time for you to reunite with them,” Xinxia said.
