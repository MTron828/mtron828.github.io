Chapter 2700: Scolding

“Lord Mo, just ask if you’re curious about anything. The Half-Moon Tide is coming soon. We’re busy with official affairs. It’s not convenient for us to spend so much time here.” Great General Li Shou looked a little impatient.

“Why didn’t Mu Ningxue come? Who is this new person?” Nanrong Xishan said rudely.

“You’re from the Nanrong Family?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes,” Nanrong Xishan said proudly.

“Oh! Please wait a moment. I need to make a quick call.” Mo Fan took out his phone and dialed Xinxia. “Xinxia, you don’t need to treat Nanrong Xu anymore. Just let him die.”

Nanrong Xishan’s face turned ashen at Mo Fan’s words. “How dare you?” he thundered.

“Old man, don’t act so pretentious here after what your family has done. If it was up to me, I would slaughter every member of the Nanrong family!” said Mo Fan.

“Did you hear that?!” exclaimed Nanrong Xishan. “This devil just said something so vile…”

Nanrong Xishan was Deputy Mayor of the Flying Bird Base City and Mo Fan had threatened his whole family! Mo Fan was lawless.

“Xishan, let’s put the grievances aside for now,” Old He interrupted. “Since Lord Mo is in charge today and he invited us all for tea, it means that he is sincere about resolving this dispute. Don’t stir up more trouble. Winter is approaching soon in the Flying Bird Base City. If this battle prolongs, everyone will be prey to the Ocean Demons.”

“The way I see it, the Nanrong family is at fault for inciting a battle on other people’s land. You should make an apology,” Jiang Shuihan said.

“Make an apology?!” Nanrong Xishan and Mo Fan exclaimed at the same time.

Nanrong Xishan stared at Jiang Shuihan in disbelief. He couldn’t be expected to apologize to this kid who had just threatened his whole family! If the other officials hadn’t been present, he would have slapped Mo Fan right there.

Mo Fan felt even more skeptical. This old man had been involved in ordering the Nanrong family to slaughter everyone on the Fanxue Mountain. If an apology was expected to solve everything, Mo Fan would definitely kill everyone in the Nanrong family. If the Nanrong Family was not destroyed, Fanxue Mountain would never have peace in Flying Bird Base City.

“It seems that you are not sincere about this talk. Since you are all busy, you can just get lost.” Mo Fan gestured to Mu Linsheng to show the guests the door.

“You brat! You’re so rude. Do you even know who we are?” Great General Li Shou said angrily.

“Who do you think you are? What right do you have to yell in front of us? The one who should get lost is you!” Councilman Tang could no longer bear it.

Mu Linshen sweated profusely at the whole debacle. He wondered if Mo Fan was really here to negotiate. It seemed as if he just wanted to scold these officials. They were all bigwigs from the Flying Bird Base City. Even if they weren’t the most powerful, they still held the lifeline of the whole of Flying Bird Base City. If he offended them, it would be a disaster.

“When I first came to Flying Bird Base City, it was just a small town that was harassed by a monster called Scarlet Demon. Many children were stolen by the sea monkeys and offered to the Scarlet Demon as food,” said Mo Fan. “I later learned that someone had bribed the officials of Flying Bird Base City to cover up the crime. One of them was the Deputy Mayor at that time.”

“When I arrived at the Flying Bird Base City again, I vowed to make it a bit more peaceful. I got a piece of wasteland in the north of this city. There were no residents there. Many demons rampaged the area. I borrowed the Earth Pistil from the west and drew a safe zone there. I named this place Fanxue Mountain and built Fan Xuexin City. It was only then that Flying Bird Base City along with North City were officially established. The whole North City was almost built around the boundaries of Fan Xuexin City. There was a free line of defense, transportation, and open land that could be used. Without Fanxue Mountain, North City would not exist. It would still be a wasteland,” continued Mo Fan.

“I’m the Honorary Councilor of Ding City. Due to respect for me, the seller sold those elemental stones at original price, and the Ding City Army escorted them here for free. We built the seawall of Fanxue Mountain, as well as a dam on one third of Flying Bird Base City’s coastline.”

“I was there when the Flying Bird Base City was born. You officials dispatched here from other places are not even worthy of talking to me, much less of expecting me to grovel at your feet. I have given you more than enough honor by inviting you and personally joining you today.”

“You united to destroy Fanxue Mountain! You stood by and watched while Fanxue Mountain was being torn apart so that you could feast on the remnants. If that b*stard Lin Kang didn’t have your consent, he wouldn’t have dared to send troops to Fanxue Mountain.” Mo Fan addressed each of the five officials and chastised them.

The face of these officials was flushed. They were angry and annoyed. They wanted to refute but didn’t know how. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mu Linsheng, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai sat there dumbfounded.

They had been discussing how to entrap the leaders to offer compensation for the damage just a moment ago. But now, all they could do was stand by and watch as Mo Fan scolded the officials like children. Mo Fan couldn’t care less.

“Clap! Clap! Clap!” A few crisp applause sounded from the door.

A middle-aged man with black hair, glossy black beard, and even blacker eyes entered. His angular face looked majestic. It was not the kind of magnificence that came from the arrogance of being in an authoritative position, but the kind that was earned by leading and struggling with his army on the battlefield.

“Commander Hua…” The five officials stared wide-eyed at the figure. It was none other than Commander Hua Zhanhong.

He was a person who was feared even among the Forbidden Saints. His existence was formidable. Thanks to him, their area wasn’t as fragmented as South America by the Ocean Demons.

“Please sit down,” said Commander Hua, pointing to the chairs. “The talk has just started. Why are you in a hurry to leave?”

Councilman Tang, Great General Li Shou, Jiang Shuihan, Nanrong Xishan, and Old He’s faces darkened. If they sat down now, they would have to hear more of Mo Fan’s insolent scolding.

The five of them certainly would have taught Mo Fan and Fanxue Mountain a lesson the moment they stepped out of the door. But they had never expected Commander Hua to arrive here on his own.

The situation at the shoreline was grave. There were more than one emperor-level Ocean Demon to deal with. Commander Hua Zhanhong was in charge of fighting these demons. If he was present here personally, it meant that the situation was serious.

Although the battle of Fanxue Mountain had alerted the whole capital, it was not worth it for him to travel all this way for the talks.

“Commander Hua, you must have heard the arrogant words just now. The head of Fanxue Mountain places himself above all. He doesn’t show any respect for the important personnel of the city at all. I think someone like him should be punished!” said Great General Li Shou
