A strange wind spiraled down from the sky, bearing dense ice petals within it.

The ice petals kept increasing in number and filled up the area ahead. They would gather together and turn into a flower to protect Qin Yu’er from the destructive spells of the four Judicators, or turn into sharp weapons to attack those within three kilometers of her.

The ice petals scattered across the sky like snow, nullifying the attacks of the four Judicators and forcing them to back away.

The ice petals accumulated rapidly, turning into a vortex close to Qin Yu’er with the help of a rising airflow.

The ice petals inside were dancing wildly. The slender figure within the vortex was extremely blurred.

The ice petals inside the vortex suddenly stopped. They were like little elves dancing around a campfire just a moment ago, but they suddenly fell to the ground and piled up like wilted flowers.

“Where did she go?”

“Damn it, aren’t you supposed to keep a close eye on her? Why did you back away?” Judicator Maule asked angrily.

“What the heck? You know how powerful that wicked woman is! If I hadn’t backed away, I would be a pile of shredded meat by now!” a Judicator with light blue hair shot back.

“She escaped again. It took us great effort just to trap her here... but it doesn’t matter, we’ve already set up the Nine Lights Formation. She can only find a place to hide, and she won’t escape our grasp. We can’t let her escape and pose a threat to society again!”

The seven people regrouped before they realized others had arrived on the field, and looked over at them.

“Who are they?” Judicator Maule frowned.

“Should be a bunch of explorers. The Rift Valley gave them a chance to reach the deeper regions of Tianshan Mountain,” Mu Feiluan said after a quick glance at the group.

“Great Chief!” Xing Hui was overjoyed when he saw Mu Feiluan.

Mu Feiluan looked at Xing Hui expressionlessly. “Where are the others?” Mu Feiluan asked.

The clan would occasionally send a team of disciples to Tianshan Mountain to search for valuables. The Scar of Tianshan Mountain was full of glaciers, so the resources here were very attractive for a clan using the Ice Element. However, it was not something Mu Feiluan was in charge of, so he did not bother to intervene with it.

“The others didn’t survive...” Xing Hui admitted softly.

“That’s not a surprise, I have long wanted to get rid of the incompetent ones. Tianshan Mountain happened to do us the favor. Otherwise, they were going to blame me for being merciless again, hehe,” Mu Yinfeng smiled.

She was pleased with the casualties on Xing Hui’s team! Xing Hui looked quite awkward. He had no idea how to respond to that.

Xing Hui suddenly thought of something. He glanced at Mu Ningxue before whispering to Mu Feiluan and Mu Yinfeng.

The two immediately stared at Mu Ningxue, who had the same silver hair as their target, sharply.

“She’s over there!” the Judicator with light blue hair suddenly yelled when he noticed Mu Ningxue.

The other Judicators quickly surrounded Mu Ningxue, like they were about to apprehend her by force.

“Are you blind?” Mo Fan stood in front of Mu Ningxue and glared at Judicator Maule.

Judicator Maule also realized Mu Ningxue was not Qin Yu’er. He struggled to keep a straight face.

“You Asians all look the same. Why are you here? Are you the Ice Witch’s accomplice too?” Maule pointed at Mo Fan.

“I’m seriously impressed by how retarded you can be! I finally understand why the Heresy Judgment Court managed to lose the Cold Prince after learning that someone like you can be a Judicator,” Mo Fan scoffed right back.

“You disrespectful scum, you do know Judicators have the right to execute you on the spot if you insult us, according to the supreme law of the Magic Association?” Maule snarled at him.

Maule was not in a great mood after Qin Yu’er escaped, and now he had stumbled into the man with a filthy mouth. How dare he provoke a Judicator when he was still a suspected heretic?

“He has always been like this, acting arrogantly just because he earned a slight reputation for himself. We have long wanted to teach him a lesson, but the Pearl Oriental Tower and Pearl Institute might accuse us of bullying him. However...” Mu Yinfeng’s eyes were filled with disdain toward Mo Fan.

Mu Yinfeng purposely dragged out her tone. She glanced at Mu Ningxue and said, “Mu Ningxue, as a sinner of the clan, you have disobeyed us several times. You even used the resources of the clan to establish a petty faction called Fanxue Mountain to oppose us. I’m afraid I won’t overlook your treacherous acts since you happen to be here today!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Mu Ningxue calmly listened to Mu Yinfeng’s lies. She already knew a cracked bell could not sound well, but she did not expect one of the highest authorities of the Mu Clan to be so shameless.

The tears she had shed in Venice were too precious. They had allowed her to see the real nature of the Mu Clan.

The icy wind that had calmed down started blowing again. Mu Ningxue’s clothes and silver hair drifted in the wind.

Frost suddenly appeared in the air. It turned into an icy aura around Mu Ningxue’s position.

Mu Yinfeng was startled. She subconsciously took a step back after seeing the aggression in Mu Ningxue’s eyes.

Mo Fan was dumbfounded too!

Why was his first wife more hot-tempered than him? No one had expected her to start a fight right away!

Star Patterns shifted rapidly to establish Star Constellations, which further constructed a Star Palace. Mu Ningxue had no intention of arguing with Mu Yinfeng. It was time to settle the dispute once and for all since they had met on Tianshan Mountain!

“Humph, you dare attack your benefactor? Don’t forget that you are only strong now because of our generosity!” Mu Yinfeng blurted out. Her eyes were brimming with anger as she continued, “Do you really think you can take me on? You are still a pitiful insect in my eyes!”

Countless ice feathers suddenly appeared around Mu Yinfeng. The scattered ice feathers combined into the spectacular pattern of an ice phoenix, displaying the strength and imperiousness of her Ice Domain!
