Chapter 1542 Super Wind Elemen

Translated by XephiZ

The enormous wolves charged at the Battlemages that were approaching from the front. They were a squad of Fire Mages. They had just summoned huge flames, intending to suppress their enemies by firing destructive spells from range, but they were forced to change the direction of their spells.

Fiery Fists like meteorites swept past right above the sand, heading right at the Enormous White Wolves. The Summoned Beasts had sturdy and thick skin, and only suffered minor injuries after being hit by one or two Fire Spells. They were nowhere enough to stop the beasts from charging forward!

The biggest Enormous White Wolf among the army of Summoned Beasts was like a tank of flesh and bone. The dozen Fiery Fists that landed on it barely slowed it down a little. The rest of the Enormous White Wolves reached the Fire Mages first. They slammed into the Fire Mages recklessly, and soon disrupted their formation!

The White-Marked Wolves joined the battle from both sides. Their sharp fangs were quick and accurate, hitting the Battlemages in their vulnerable spots before they were able to complete their spells, throwing their formation into chaos!

“Damn it, did that guy bring a whole pack of wolves with him? Why are there so many wolves!?” Captain Saks grunted.

His men were struggling to fend off so many Enormous White Wolves at once. They were forced to set up a barrier to prevent the fierce Summoned Beasts from pressing in any further.

The army was indeed very strong. The Earth Mages set up the perimeter with walls like a fortress after the wolves briefly disrupted their formation. The Water Mages proceeded to set up a defense with the Water Curtains, making it difficult for the speedy White-Marked Wolves to ambush the Mages from behind!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s howl was the loudest. He made his move as soon as he noticed the Water Curtains.

His attacks were a lot stronger than the others; he tore a gap on the barrier, allowing a dozen Enormous White Wolves to penetrate the enemy’s defenses. The beasts proceeded to trample the Battlemages that were hiding inside the barrier!

“I’ll deal with the Great Commander-level creature!” Saks immediately set his eyes on the Flying Creek Snow Wolf when he saw the barrier being torn apart.

Saks was a Wind Mage. Six Wind Wings emerged from his back and soon propelled him into the air in a spiral. He went after the Flying Creek Snow Wolf that was constantly running along the perimeter and striking it.

Saks looked down from above. No Summoned Beast could disrupt his Channeling. A gray-white wind started blowing through the air, and from the trails of the dust, it was quite obvious that all the wind within a kilometer was rapidly gathering toward him like a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean!

“Thousand Leaves Saber!” Saks uttered the name of the Wind Spell coldly.

A gray-white wind saber over a hundred meters long dove from the sky and slashed at the spot that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was running towards at shocking speed.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf reacted swiftly, turning and leaping into the air. He barely dodged the wind slash, but some of his long white fur drifted in the air nearby.

Wolf species had a strong sense of danger, and his senses had continued to sharpen as his rank increased. He knew that the wind slash was only the beginning!

The space trembled noisily from the rapid-spinning wind sabers. When they landed on the ground, the ground was sliced open with ease as if it was a piece of tofu!

A few dozen deadly wind sabers chased after the Flying Creek Snow Wolf that was sprinting at his full speed. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was already at his limit. He was so quick that the others could barely see a blurred shadow, but there were not many openings for the Flying Creek Snow Wolf to dodge thru when they were all going after him at the same time.

Most terrifyingly, the wind sabers kept coming, wave after wave. There were almost a thousand of them, and they were all targeting the Flying Creek Snow Wolf!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was soon covered in deep wounds. A huge chunk of meat connecting his body and his back leg on the left was sliced off. Fresh blood scattered in the air in a shocking display!

It was the Super Wind Spell, the Thousand Leaves Saber!

Luckily, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was very sensitive to danger, and had already moved away from Saks while he was Channeling the spell. Otherwise, the Super Spell would have killed the Flying Creek Snow Wolf instantly!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf fled for his life. By the time he reached safety, he was already covered in shocking wounds.

It was very impressive that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf managed to survive the Super Wind Spell. Mo Fan sent him back to the Summoning Plane so he could recover from his injuries.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf had attracted the highest level of firepower from the soldiers. On the other side, the Enormous White Wolves and the White-Marked Wolves had completely disrupted the Battlemage’s formation. There was blood everywhere.

The Battlemages’ formations posed the greatest threat to Mo Fan and the others. The formations of the Ice Mages and Fire Mages allowed them to combine their magic into a giant web. Someone like Mo Fan, who had zero ability to defend himself, would have no chance against them!

The messy situation was exactly what Mo Fan was hoping for. However, he was surprised that there was a Super Mage leading the Battlemages!

A Super Mage was clearly no minor character in Cairo; Mo Fan was even more infuriated by the discovery!

“I’ll handle the captain!” Vani said. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Vani’s Super Earth Spell posed a great threat to the Wind Mages, Earth Mages, and the Shadow Mages, forcing them to back away. Vani did not expect the enemy to have a Super Mage. The two Super Mages would have to face one another in a situation like this...

“Mo Fan, these people aren’t weak... I’m afraid we won’t be able to rescue them,” Mu Bai said.

“I know, but we can’t leave Old Zhao behind!” Mo Fan glanced at the frozen area. He was getting a headache because of it.

Mo Fan could not afford to get close to the area, since he might end up being frozen. There were so many Ice Mages casting spells together! Even his Fire Element would not stand a chance...

The wolves had disrupted a few of the enemy’s formations, but the strongest formation of the Ice Mages was still untouched. It was too dangerous for Mo Fan to try and save the hostages.
