Chapter 822: Relapse of the Deadly Poison

Mu Ningxue did not come up with the idea of using the Wind Disc as a trap herself. She saw Okamoto using it during the duel between him and Guan Yu at the West Guardian Tower.

However, Guan Yu was just too fast. He managed to stab Okamoto before he could activate the trap. Okamoto lost the duel, yet Mu Ningxue was intrigued by his move.

Not every person or demon creature was as fast as Guan Yu; the Wind Disc trap was a very practical way to use the Wind Spell without a doubt. Since then, Mu Ningxue had spent some time figuring out how Okamoto had done it, and discovered that she could cast a Wind Disc beforehand and suppress it to right below the point of release. When something moved closer to the trap, disrupting the airflow, it would trigger the Wind Disc, producing a strong wind surrounding Mu Ningxue like a wall and blowing the creatures that tried to approach her away!

The Jagged-Paw Green Demons were ocean creatures. They were sensitive to moisture, but they were unable to sense any strange airflows. They assumed they could easily cut the female Magician into pieces by flanking her simultaneously, but to their surprise, Mu Ningxue stayed still and used the Wind Disc trap perfectly!

The strong wind howled fiercely and formed a tornado with Mu Ningxue at its center.

Both the leaping Jagged-Paw Green Demons leaping and those attacking her on the ground were tossed into the air by the strong wind barrier. Two of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons slammed into one another and stabbed each other’s faces with the spikes on their heads.

The paralyzing effect soon took hold, the two Jagged-Paw Green Demons suffering facial nerve paralysis. The flesh on their faces hung loosely, as if they had turned into two extremely aged demon creatures. They looked rather comical.

The leader of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons was infuriated. Its four idiotic subordinates had missed a great opportunity, wasting the effort that it had put in!

It had no choice but to settle the fight itself. The Jagged-Paw Green Demon broke free from the ice entrapping its legs. Its throat shuddered, seeing Mu Ningxue had her back to it.

The creature fired a long, thin water beam at Mu Ningxue’s slender back.

Mu Ningxue had her ice chain wrap around her waist. It dragged her to the side, barely dodging the surprise attack. The water beam struck a balcony and punctured it!

The leader of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons had perfectly demonstrated that it was possible to puncture rock with water. Unfortunately for it, Mu Ningxue would never lower her guard in a fight!

“I’m here to help!” Guan Yu glided across the sky with a Wind Track and landed beside Mu Ningxue.

Guan Yu’s offensive capabilities were quite outstanding, especially the unique arm gauntlet he was wearing. If he was given the chance, he basically could kill Warrior-level creatures like the Jagged-Paw Green Demons with a single blow.

The truth was, even if Guan Yu did not show up, Mu Ningxue had no problem looking after herself. She was an Ice Magician. The Ice Element was not known for its ability to end fights in a short period of time, but for the advantages it had in a prolonged fight.

Mu Ningxue’s frost never stopped spreading. The Jagged-Paw Green Demons felt their skin turning numb and their bones turning stiff. They did not realize that they were actually getting slower.

The frost would fully penetrate the creatures’ muscles, bones, hearts, and blood with enough time. As such, in just a few more minutes, Mu Ningxue would not even need to waste her energy on the Jagged-Paw Green Demons; they would simply lose their ability to fight due to the frost, and be shattered by Mu Ningxue’s ice chains!

Guan Yu basically enjoyed the fruits of Mu Ningxue’s work. Using his agility and speed, his claw gauntlet rapidly stabbed the weak points of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons slowed down by the frost and took two of them out in an instant.

The leader of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons decisively turned around and ran away. It was obvious that the creature had finally realized it was slowing down.

The leader and the two Jagged-Paw Green Demons split up and fled for their lives, escaping into the warm sea water. However, Mu Ningxue managed to intercept one of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons that had suffered facial paralysis.

Guan Yu broke the lower half of the Jagged-Paw Green Demon’s body into ice cubes with a kick, and stabbed its heart with the claw gauntlet...

It turned out that most of the creature’s body was already frozen. Guan Yu did not see any blood flowing out when he stabbed the creature.

“Stay with me, you haven’t fully recovered yet. I’m worried that something might happen to you.” Guan Yu was an arrogant young master of a renowned family in front of the others, yet he would somehow turn into a considerate man around Mu Ningxue. Even his tone was a lot gentler.

Mu Ningxue hated to be interrupted during her fighting. If Guan Yu had not shown up, there was no chance she would have let the leader of the Jagged-Paw Green Demons escape.

However, she knew it was useless to reject the man’s offer. Guan Yu had realized how effective the shameless tactic was from Mo Fan, so he began to use the same method to stay close to her!

“Stay closer to where Nanyu is, I’m worried about Nan Rongni still,” said Mu Ningxue.

“Err... alright, I will definitely protect your friend,” Guan Yu hesitated for a moment before nodding. He believed it was reasonable to win the favor of Mu Ningxue’s bestie to earn her affection.

After Mu Ningxue intelligently drove Guan Yu away, she stared at the surging currents around the building.

The current had risen by another meter, and seemed like it was still rising. It was not a good sign for the team. The rising water would significantly limit the space available to the Magicians. Even Magicians who were experts at fighting underwater would not dare to jump into the water now!

The loud cry of an infant came from below. Mu Ningxue looked into the direction of the cry and recognized the White Sobbing Demon that had severely injured Nan Rongni. It was still alive, and currently floating on the surface of the water with one of its tentacles raised high into the air. Half of the other tentacle had already regrown even though it was chopped off not long ago. It seemed like a new stinger would soon reform from the severed end.

“Such remarkable regeneration!” Mu Ningxue exclaimed in surprise.

Mu Ningxue had a strong feeling that the White Sobbing Demon was a tougher opponent than the team had assumed. Otherwise, Nan Rongni would have easily recovered from the injuries she suffered with a few drops of Healing Liquid, yet she still had trouble standing on her own.

“Crap!” Nanyu’s voice shouted in the communication device. Everyone panicked slightly after hearing her voice, as it was rare to see her in shock.

“What happened?” Ai Jiangtu’s deep voice spoke into the communication device.

“Nan Rongni is poisoned, and it looks deadly!”

“Not only didn’t the wound on her leg recover, it has begun to fester... the veins on her leg are visible, and they have all turned white!” Her voice had more than a hint of anxiety.
