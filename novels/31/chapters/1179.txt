“AHHHH!!!” The Holy Court Mage on Dulanc’s right was just about to use his magic when Demon Mo Fan set his body on fire.

The flames were inextinguishable, but the man was a Super Water Mage. He immediately Summoned a strong tide. The waves splashed across the streets and flooded the roads, but still failed to put out the fire that was growing on him rapidly!

The fire burned through his defensive magic and destroyed his Magic Equipment. It then burned through the skin and turned the Holy Court Mage into a blackened corpse...

“A...a demon like you shouldn’t exist in this world. The Five Magic Associations and the Holy Judgment Court are going to send you back into Hell!” Dulanc yelled when he saw his men dying horribly.

In addition to bringing the authorities and the strongest Mages in the world to judgment, the Holy Judgment Court was also responsible for exterminating and forbidding evil magic!

The power that Mo Fan possessed was clearly unacceptable. Dulanc believed the Heresy Judgment Mages could easily eliminate the demon in front of him!

“I have only used my power against the people of the Black Vatican, but compared to them, you actually deserve to die more!” Mo Fan retorted.

The Holy Judgment Court was meant to serve justice and eliminate evil forces, but what did their Great Magistrate Dulanc do?

If the Holy Judgment Court was controlling the fate of the human race, he would not mind destroying it instead!

A deafening roar came from the spacious Dark Execution Ground.

The buildings and streets inside it had turned into a giant, black pool. A ghastly head wearing a horned helmet slowly rose from the muddy water. Black flying insects spread into the surroundings like thick clouds of smoke outlining a serpent.

Under the horned helmet was a face half-covered in tentacles. Its entire jaw was covered by long black beetles!

A pair of metallic, black horns curled to the back of its head. Its forehead was protected by the helmet, and its hollow eyes had a ghastly, crimson-red glow. It was glaring at Xinxia, who was bound to the Dark Execution Ground by the Stones of Guilt.

It felt like the woman would be completely destroyed by a single breath from the creature. Countless black insects were circling Xinxia, as if they could not wait to feast on her!

These Insects of Death rarely had a chance to taste such a tender sacrifice! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

——

“It’s...it’s Hayla!”

“It’s over...”

Pang Lai and Song Qiming both saw the creature Summoned by the Stones of Guilt in the Dark Execution Ground.

The God of Death of Greece was one of the strongest creatures in the world. It had even killed Wen Tai, who was extremely close to becoming a Forbidden Mage. Even the strongest Mage would stand no chance against it!

Hayla was similar in size to the Black Totem Snake. Its shadow loomed over the Citadel of Athens. The creature could easily trample the city into ashes with a single stomp.

The people could see the enormous creature of darkness from every location on the sacred mountain. If the Dark Execution Ground was not cut off by the barrier, the flying insects and the overwhelming aura of death would surely have caused an unimaginable disaster to the Citadel of Athens.

The people of Athens hid behind the city’s barrier, yet they could not feel any sense of security. Humans were just too minuscule compared to the majestic creature!

——-

“HAHAHA, Hayla is here! There’s no way you can save her!” Great Magistrate Dulanc burst out laughing as soon as he saw Hayla’s appearance.

Mo Fan’s gaze was icy. He could sense how strong Hayla was. Its aura was even stronger than the Black Totem Snake!

The Mountain Zombie and the Black Totem Snake were the strongest creatures that Mo Fan had ever seen, but to his surprise, Hayla was even stronger than either Supreme Ruler.

The flames of fury inside Mo Fan’s heart burned higher as the thought of Xinxia being trapped with the creature crossed his mind.

The flames surged wildly and spread across the city, surrounding the entire Dark Execution Ground.

Dulanc and the last Holy Court Mage were devoured by the flames. Mo Fan could not care less if they were dead or alive. He tried to use his flames to tear a gap in the barrier of the Dark Execution Ground!

The Dark Execution Ground was similar to the Dark Dueling Ground. It had a barrier that would stop anyone apart from Ye Xinxia from entering. The only existences that were allowed in the Dark Dueling Ground were the target and the executioner, Hayla!

If Hayla was hostile toward the Citadel of Athens, it could easily raze the city to the ground, let alone killing Xinxia, who basically had no way of defending herself.

Mo Fan almost lost his mind when he saw Hayla slowly approaching Xinxia. His flames had already spread to the other areas, including the sacred mountain of the Parthenon Temple!

The people under the sacred mountain could only see the demon flames and the Dark Execution Ground...

The flames clashed with the dark energy. Even the Super Mages did not dare go any closer.

The civilians and the Mages on the sacred mountain were dumbfounded by the spectacular sight.

Pang Lai flew into the sky and yelled at Mo Fan, “Mo Fan! You’re too close to the Citadel of Athens. Control your flames, or else they are going to burn the innocent people to ashes. There are hundreds of thousand people behind the city’s barrier!”

Mo Fan took a quick glance in the direction of the city and saw that his flames were inches away from the city’s barrier. The Parthenon Temple had long evacuated the people into the barrier, but if he did not suppress the flames, they would devour thousands of people in an instant!

“We’ll help you to tear a gap on the barrier, but Hayla is very powerful, don’t force yourself!” Song Qiming said to Mo Fan.

Song Qiming and Pang Lai were worried that once Xinxia died after her soul was dragged into the Realm of Death. Mo Fan would totally lose control of himself and bring total destruction upon the Citadel of Athens!

They were the strongest Mages in China. Mo Fan’s demon flames were struggling to break through the barrier of the Dark Execution Ground, but Song Qiming was once the Clergyman of the Holy Judgment Court. He was quite familiar with the Dark Execution Ground.

He asked Pang Lai to lend him a hand, and they forcibly tore a gap open on the barrier of the Dark Execution Ground with the power of the Chaos Element!

Mo Fan turned into a meteorite and flew right at Hayla as soon as the gap was big enough for him to enter, leaving a trail of flames behind him. “Don’t you touch her!” he roared.

The flames were like a bright sun falling from the sky, slamming into the ground in front of Hayla.

Hayla was just about to reach out its claw and drag Xinxia into its territory. To its surprise, an intruder had barged in. The explosion forced Hayla to dodge sideways, but the flames had burned every flying insect they contacted to ashes!

Hayla was a real Supreme Ruler, a deity of darkness, no one had ever dared to provoke it like that.

It used its claws to put out the demon flames burning it. It took a heavy step forward and swung its claw at Mo Fan!

Hayla’s claws were enormous. A dark magic claw immediately surrounded Mo Fan. It was big enough to hold an entire mountain.

A silver flicker burst out of Mo Fan’s body, before he vanished into thin air with a shudder. The giant claw missed, but Hayla was able to sense the ripple of the Space Element. It Summoned a black pitchfork to its hand and hurled it at the spot Mo Fan was moving to!

Mo Fan had blinked continuously to move at least a kilometer away, but the dark pitchfork seemed to have locked onto him, able to track Mo Fan down still.

The dark pitchfork struck Mo Fan. He smashed through the walls of five buildings before he was nailed to the ground before a water fountain by the pitchfork.

The dark pitchfork was huge. Mo Fan was extremely tiny compared to it. He was struggling to break free from it.

Hayla easily leapt across the distance of one kilometer.

He landed beside the water fountain and grabbed the dark pitchfork that was nailing Mo Fan to the ground, before stabbing at the place Mo Fan was lying on repeatedly!

Each time the pitchfork landed on the ground, it would produce a tremendous shockwave, razing the structures nearby to the ground. Mo Fan gathered his demon flames in front of him to reduce the damage being inflicted on him.

Hayla’s strength was utterly terrifying. The Super Mages had barely left a single scratch on Mo Fan with their spells, but Hayla had already inflicted serious damage to Mo Fan with its attacks!

As Hayla was indulging in the violent attack, a lightning bolt came down out of nowhere. A normal lightning bolt was like a little sparkle to Hayla, but this bolt of lightning actually consisted of a few hundred lightning strikes. The creature cried out in agony when the lightning landed on its head!

The lightning kept hitting Hayla. The creature seemed to be afraid of lightning. It immediately backed away. The arcs of lightning scattered across the place and lasted for a long time...
