“Are you sure?” Zhao Manyan was doubting Jiang Shaoxu’s words.

Even if they assumed the legend of the Four-Eyed Bird was real and its remains were buried in the deep sea for several thousand years, it would be almost impossible to burn the Sea Skeleton King’s backbone when its entire body was covered in a thick layer of black seawater.

Its spine was perfectly intact. It had remained standing after being blasted by so many Super Mages, proving how outstanding and durable it was.

Mo Fan chose to believe Jiang Shaoxu. “You guys figure out a way to expose its back. I’ll blast open its shell and pour lava into it!”

“I’ll freeze its legs!” Mu Ningxue stated, backing away slightly and hovering above the sea. Her body looked as weightless as a feather.

She summoned the Ice Crystal Bow. Its brilliance instantly lit up the dim sky.

Her hair drifted wildly in the wind and brushed the side of her dazzling face and her pale neck, further setting off her elegant curves!

“Heavens Ice and Earth Crystals!”

The arrow was launched with a loud howl, stirring up ripples of icy dust between the sea and the sky. The ice completely surrounded the arrow which was flying straight at the Sea Skeleton King.

The sea and the rocks froze. The damp breeze looked like streams of white silk.

The Sea Skeleton King reacted quickly. It tried to jump away from the area that was freezing solid, but Zhang Xiaohou created a huge net made up of wind strings to foil the Sea Skeleton King in the nick of time.

The wind net could not match the Sea Skeleton King in strength, but it only had to slow the creature down enough. Mu Ningxue’s Ice Crystal Bow would quickly freeze the Sea Skeleton King’s lower body.

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Magic was close to the peak of the Ice Element with the help of a unique magic artifact like the Ice Crystal Bow. The arrow also consumed a huge amount of Mu Ningxue’s mental energy.

The Sea Skeleton King’s lower body was frozen solid. It was not just covered in a layer of frost, but icy crystals that were as sturdy as steel. Even powerful spells would struggle to leave scratches on them.

Mo Fan immediately circled around to the Sea Skeleton King’s back after Mu Ningxue successfully trapped the Sea Skeleton King, creeping closer with Fleeing Shadow.

The Sea Skeleton King was extremely cautious. It began twisting its body vigorously when it noticed Mo Fan closing on its backbone.

It swung its hand at the sky. Mo Fan instantly felt an enormous force rushing at him, forcing him to back away and reveal himself!

The force had formed a spreading barrier around the Sea Skeleton King to keep Mo Fan away from its back. He was unable to touch the Sea Skeleton King’s skin, let alone its backbone!

“Brother Fan, I’ll keep it busy!” Zhang Xiaohou declared.

“How are you going to do that?...”

Mo Fan saw Zhang Xiaohou turn into a wind drill and start digging into the Sea Skeleton King’s chest.

The Sea Skeleton King was the size of a mountain. The holes in its body left from the previous battle were like caves punched into it. Zhang Xiaohou boldly went right inside the Sea Skeleton King’s chest like a parasite.

The Sea Skeleton King was still afraid of other creatures going inside its body. Its backbone might be its first priority, but it also had organs in its chest!

Its destructive Aura began to shift inwards. It was trying to drive Zhang Xiaohou out from its torso.

Zhang Xiaohou was utterly reckless. Not only was he reluctant to leave, he drove deeper into the Sea Skeleton King’s chest and took cover behind its ribs.

The Sea Skeleton King started to panic. A human Mage had run inside its own chest. If the human’s spells were as powerful as Mo Fan’s lightning, it was no different from planting a bomb inside its chest!

It could not allow Zhang Xiaohou to go any deeper. It released all of the destructive Aura into its body, even if it might end up damaging itself!

Zhang Xiaohou’s actions worked as intended. Mo Fan was able to see the bone with the Totem Seal!

“Little Flame Belle!” Mo Fan shouted.

Little Flame Belle had long been on standby and immediately appeared. She was as dazzling as the sun as she hovered above Mo Fan. Mo Fan erupted into blazing flames as he was bathed in the scorching light coming from her.

His blood vessels, bones, muscles, and skin were made of scorching lava, like a child of the sun. He was radiating imperious flames!

As Mo Fan transformed into the King of Hell, the Totem Seal on the Sea Skeleton King’s backbone started glowing and heating up.

The Sea Skeleton King was made of water and possessed a demonic Aura. Even its bones were brimming with the presence of the Undead Magic.

However, a particular bone on its back was blazing red, like a piece of metal that had just been taken out of a furnace.

It proved Jiang Shaoxu was telling the truth!

Mo Fan did not hesitate any longer. He dove into the Sea Skeleton King’s body just like Zhang Xiaohou had!

The Heavenly Flames would normally be unable to melt through the Sea Skeleton King, but Mo Fan had transformed into a scorching spear, forcing his way into the Sea Skeleton King’s body. The creature was unable to resist the heat in its weakened state.

The Sea Skeleton King could feel its back burning. It tried to grab Mo Fan.

Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan decisively made their moves and blocked the Sea Skeleton King’s arm, buying Mo Fan more time.

Mo Fan finally broke through the thick black seawater. He felt like his own Heavenly Flames were going to burn him into ashes. He had rarely engulfed himself in such hot flames in the past. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Lava Fist River!”

Mo Fan threw a punch at the bone with the Totem Seal. Thick black water swirled to block the flames.

Mo Fan did not give up. He threw another punch at the same location.

A third punch!

A fourth punch! The lava was splashing everywhere and had set the whole place on fire.

Mo Fan failed to blast open a hole after throwing four punches. He took a deep breath and kept attacking.

The bone with the Totem Seal was getting hotter. It had been just a normal bone before, without any sense of life.

However, as its temperature rose, the reddened bone started releasing its own burning heat!

The massive Sea Skeleton King had over a thousand bones, but only the bone with the Totem Seal was burning. It was about to separate itself from the cold and undead creature, and be reborn!
