Chapter 2907: Who Is The Leader

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“All sorts of strange things can happen in the Land of the Antarctic. As long as there’s no issue with our route, we’ll keep moving!” said Wang Shuo.

Due to the existence of areas that refracted light, even if they record every terrain and landmark, changes were likely to occur.

Many times, Wang Shuo had noticed that the Extreme South Land was not a straight path. It was more like an organic world. The glacial plate, the snow mountain rift valley, and the white shoot continent were like dormant, massive beings. It would inadvertently appear in front of them and behind them and catch them unaware.

Wang Shuo would not find it surprising if strange things happened here.

Moreover, there were many creatures here that were so powerful that their strength exceeded imagination. If these creatures wanted to move the mountains and the seas, they would!

After they went along the designated route, the Black Panther Summoner continued to explore the place.

This time, he came back wounded. He was bleeding. He was frozen and looked as white as a ghost. He was also in excruciating pain.

Fortunately, they had a Healing Mage in Yan Lan’s team who treated the Black Panther Summoner’s wounds in time.

At that moment, Wei Guang came out of the Clear Fire Formation. When he saw the wounded Black Panther Summoner, he frowned. “What happened?”

“I encountered a Giant Ice Beast. It stood before me, but its aura was just as difficult to detect as a glacier. If it had not been for the fact that my Dark Star sensed danger, I wouldn’t have made it back alive,” said the Black Panther Summoner, wincing in pain.

“You have a relatively high level of cultivation. Why weren’t you able to take on the Giant Ice Beast?” asked Wei Guang.

“I don’t know what species it is. It shattered an entire glacier that spanned up to several kilometers with a single swipe. It is at least a ruler-level creature,” said the Black Panther Summoner.

“We haven’t even cme far, and you already met a ruler-level creature?!” Yan Lan cried out in surprise.

“Anyway, we have to be careful as we continue. Let your younger brother scout ahead. We don’t have much time left.” Wei Guang glanced at the sky. He used the orientation of the sun to tell time.

Mu Ningxue had been paying close attention to the orientation of the sun. The sun had been circling around the sky for several days now. Its position in the sky had dipped a little over the past few days, and it was showing signs of sinking below the horizon.

The moment the sun sank into the horizon, it would not rise again. They would be enveloped in a terrifying state of eternal darkness. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s too dangerous for him to go alone. After all, we’ve already entered the Giant Ice Beast’s territory. Send a few more people so that they can protect one another,” said Mu Ningxue.

When the White Panther Summoner heard her words, he turned to her.

The White Panther Summoner’s level of cultivation was not as high as his elder brother. He might not return alive if he explored alone.

“Li Wenbin, send two of your people with him,” said Wei Guang.

Li Wenbin nodded. He selected a Shadow Element Mage and a Wind Element Mage from his team.

“Before they go, let them warm up in the Clear Fire Formation so that they won’t freeze to death out there,” the Black Panther Summoner suggested.

“They are still in good shape. There’s no need for them to go into the formation. Mu Ningxue can go in and take a rest.” Wei Guang disagreed with the Black Panther Summoner.

Wei Guang disliked discussing things with others. He expected everyone to obey his words.

…

Mu Ningxue entered the Clear Fire Formation. It was indeed warmer inside.

She only stayed inside for a while before letting Yan Lan into the formation. The cold could not harm her, so there was no need for her to keep on occupying the formation.

“Are you really fine with it? If anything happens to you, I can’t afford to bear the consequences,” Yan Lan whispered to Mu Ningxue.

“It could be due to my physique. I’m always in good shape,” said Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue did not plan to tell Yan Lan about the fact that the cold could do no harm to her. Mu Ningxue did not have the habit of sharing everything with others. The trip itself remained a mystery, so it was necessary to keep certain things to herself.

Yan Lan did not doubt her words and entered the Clear Fire Formation gratefully.

Mu Ningxue did not leave the Clear Fire Formation cabin. She closed her eyes and took a rest outside the formation.

Yan Lan’s lips had turned purple because of the cold. Her skin was pale. The ice had invaded her skin, muscles, and blood. Even her bones had turned stiff due to the freezing temperature. Fortunately, the Clear Fire Formation could gradually eliminate the poison of the cold.

After two hours, Yan Lan recovered. Her cheeks had turned red. The effects of the cold were gone.

She opened her eyes and found Mu Ningxue was still outside the formation.

Mu Ningxue sat in a dignified posture. Yan Lan stared at her focused demeanor.

She had to admit that Mu Ningxue was impeccably beautiful. Even a woman would fall for Mu Ningxue’s beauty.

‘She’s truly perfect. Why can’t I look as gorgeous as her?’ Yan Lan thought to herself.

Suddenly, there was an argument outside the formation cabin.

Mu Ningxue opened her eyes. There was not even the slightest trace of change in her complexion. Her skin was still as white as snow. Even though she was in the middle of the icy cold world, she did not look pale or weak.

Yan Lan was confused. She wondered why Mu Ningxue was not affected by the cold. Yan Lan had stayed inside the Clear Fire Formation for a long time. Most people would have frozen to death without recuperating in the Clear Fire Formation.

“Something is happening outside,” said Yan Lan.

“Let’s go check it out.”

The two ladies left the cabin. They saw the Black Panther Summoner and Li Wenbin at the deck. They were quarreling with Wei Guang.

“We don’t have much time left. If they lose their way, they can surely catch up with us soon based on the trails we’ve left behind. If something were to happen to them, it’s pointless to go and look for them. We’re not inside a sunny garden. Every extra day spent here will only endanger everyone’s lives even more,” Wei Guang said solemnly.

They were in the middle of an argument. Wei Guang showed no room of negotiation.

Yan Lan whispered to Mu Ningxue, “The trio who went out to explore the route haven’t returned yet. Wei Guang sent another person to find the route. He doesn’t intend to wait for the three to return.”

“Let’s go over there,” said Mu Ningxue.

When the Black Panther Summoner saw Mu Ningxue walking toward them, he looked at her as though she could save him. He explained the entire situation.

“I’m the leader. I’ll decide how to go there. You don’t have to seek advice from her,” Wei Guang said coldly.

“The Magic Association is the one that recruited me. If you don’t want to become the leader of this team, you may go back now. I’ll finish the remaining route by myself.” Mu Ningxue refuted.
