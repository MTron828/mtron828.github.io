Chapter 2350: It Seems to have Left

Wu Ku was almost out of his mind!

He immediately put the blame on White Leopard. “Why did you withdraw the Absolute Zero Seal?”

If White Leopard was not so full of himself, Mo Fan would never have had the chance to steal the Fundamental Water Crystals.

“You were the one that asked me to throw them at you!” White Leopard was displeased at Wu Ku’s reaction, instantly putting all the blame on him.

He was also speechless at how cunning Mo Fan was.

He had long withdrawn the Absolute Zero Seal. If Mo Fan was unharmed, he could have made his way out earlier and surprised Damon, potentially inflicting serious injuries on him.

However, Mo Fan chose to remain idle and let Damon and his disciples attack him at will, just so he could take away the Fundamental Crystals when they were passed to Wu Ku!

Life had to be a b**ch sometimes. Accidents that should not happen ended up occurring because of the slightest mistake, resulting in unimaginable consequences!

“He can’t destroy the Fundamental Water Crystals with his Heaven-grade Flame, either. Just calm down for now,” Ice Tiger spoke up.

Destroy them? Mo Fan had never planned to destroy the Fundamental Water Crystals.

If he failed to take down Wu Ku, who was under heavy protection, he could just leave with the Fundamental Water Crystals and find another way to intercept the Scorching River and the streams up in the Andes Mountain Range to stop the rain in a few days.

Wu Ku might run away in the end, but the people of this country would come to their senses and realize they should be worrying about the sea monsters and the Black Vatican instead of their own people.

“Then kill him and take back the Fundamental Water Crystals!” Wu Ku snarled.

Wu Ku was seriously going to lose his mind! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He had always heard how his superiors described Mo Fan as a bearer of misfortune for the Black Vatican. He had been causing a lot of trouble for the Black Vatican, and most importantly, he was as tough as a cockroach!

Wu Ku used to shun their words. He had been able to destroy all of Bo City. Wouldn’t it be easy for him to kill a single person, too?

But now, he finally realized how disgusting Mo Fan was!

He could no longer care about the rain. He just wanted Mo Fan to die immediately!

“Brother, how did he manage to survive the attacks?” Ice Tiger asked with a confused face.

White Leopard’s face darkened. He initially had the patience to slowly wear out Mo Fan, but he was starting to feel a little annoyed after Wu Ku put all the blame on him!

“If Damon’s Light Element did not have any effect on him, it must be the Super Power of his Shadow Magic!” White Leopard tried his best to remain calm and analyze the situation.

Despite his anger, he could not help but feel that he had underestimated his opponent!

“Is his Super Power that impressive?” Ice Tiger’s eyes widened.

“Didn’t you see how strong my Absolute Zero Seal was?!” White Leopard raged.

The Ice Element naturally had an outstanding ability to trap a target, but the problem was that the Ice Magic would also hinder the offense of other Elements. It would provide the enemy with strong protection even while trapping them in the ice.

White Leopard had managed to find a solution to that after awakening his Super Power. It was also the reason he was chased after by many powerful factions.

“However, just like my Absolute Zero Seal, he couldn’t use the ability over a long period,” White Leopard went on.

Those with a Super Power would be unbeatable if they did not have any time restrictions. Even ten thousand Mages under the Super Level had no chance of beating a Super Mage with a Super Power!

“Brother, I’m feeling a lot better now. I can attack him together with Damon while you suppress him from a distance. We can’t let him keep doing whatever he pleases in our territory,” Ice Tiger waved his arm around.

He had gotten rid of the burns from the Heaven-grade Flame. The lingering pain would not affect his strength.

“Bring Wolf Chief along too; the three of you will keep him busy while I assign more groups of soldiers here to take him down!” White Leopard said sternly.

Their leader would be angry if they did not bring back the rain soon!

Unfortunately, Cook had died right at the beginning. If he was around, the young man would not be able to use his abilities freely. Most of their men with special abilities had been sent out to fend off the Eagle Horse Skyriders or the enemy on the main battlefield. There were not many Psychic Mages or Sound Mages left in their camp!

Even if there were Psychic Mages or Sound Mages, those below the Super Level would soon be targeted and killed by the enemy’s outstanding Shadow Magic!

“Call Wilted Phoenix back!” Wu Ku ordered.

“She’s busy with the Eagle Horse Skyriders’ key figures,” White Leopard said.

Now that Wu Ku mentioned it, Wilted Phoenix usually did not spend such a long time to take down the enemy’s strong Mages, but she seemed to be struggling this time. Did she encounter a formidable opponent too?

“Which one do you think is more important to us? Fending off the Eagle Horses that are nothing but flies to us, or bringing back the rain?” Wu Ku challenged him.

White Leopard frowned in thought.

Wu Ku was right. Without the rain, many people would hesitate to keep fighting. The battle was too important to the Brown Rebels. They would be forced to retreat to the other side of the Scorching River and left with no choice but to defend Half-Ridge Mountain City as their only base. It would only be a matter of time before the Federation Army reclaimed it.

The Eagle Horse Skyriders might be a little annoying, but they were not a threat that would decide the outcome of the battle!

“Fine, I’ll call Wilted Phoenix back,” White Leopard agreed.

White Leopard thought it was overkill to call Wilted Phoenix back to take care of Mo Fan. They would be able to kill Mo Fan given enough time.

However, they desperately needed to resume the rain. The Eagle Horse Skyriders should be relieved they could live another day!

The sky was in a complete mess. The clouds had reclaimed their grayness after the storm of Elemental Magic dissipated, yet the Lightning Spells soon dyed them white!

The Eagle Horse Skyriders were weaving through the clouds. They had sustained serious casualties, especially the high-ranked officers who were in charge.

Every time they were focusing on other enemies, the pitch-black claw would appear out of nowhere and claim their lives.

They had lost a few captains to the claw, but they still had no idea where it was coming from.

Was it Dark Magic, or did it belong to a terrifying creature?

Zhao Manyan was covered in a cold sweat above a stormy cloud. He took a deep breath, but all he could smell was blood. The captain of the Shadow Mages who had been escorting him and Mo Fan had been smashed into pieces not long ago.

“I can only hold on for one or two more rounds at most!” Zhao Manyan told Eagle Eyes.

“It…it seems to have left,” Eagle Eyes said with a hint of relief.
