It never occurred to Mo Fan that Zhao Pinlin would actually be one of the Black Vatican.

It seemed like Wang Xuxu did agree to date Rong Sheng, but the enraged Zhao Pinlin thought he was being humiliated, and abused the power given by the Black Vatican to force Wang Xuxu to obey him. The girl did not even dare to tell anyone even when she was being tortured.

“How bold of him, to dare do such a thing when I, the Anti-Darkness Little Prince, is around!” harrumphed Mo Fan coldly.

It was too easy for the Black Vatican to force a woman without any background or power to obey them. As a matter of fact, anyone with some background or power was able to achieve that, let alone a member of the Black Vatican. One had to admit that the world was very unfair. It was too easy for a girl like Wang Xuxu to be manipulated. Similarly, it was not like the world was absolutely unjust, as they were lots of people like Mo Fan, who, once they learned the evil deeds that the Black Vatican was up to, would do everything to erase them from the world!

“A disciple is worth five hundred thousand, a priest is worth around nine million, half the price of a Soul Seed, which is basically half a tin of milk powder for my beloved daughter... Zhao Pinlin, you better not disappoint me!” Mo Fan snuck past a dark corridor. He had basically merged with the shadows as he moved past a few Dark Beast Monsters on patrol. The creatures were completely unaware of his presence.

Mo Fan headed for the garden close to the building and noticed some sounds coming from a path made of pebbles leading through some statues and garden art. He quickly hid on a dense tree and observed silently.

He saw three people approaching his direction rapidly. They were all service staff with red bowties.

In addition to them, there were another five people a little further into the garden, and more than ten Dark Beast Monsters crawling on the ground.

These Dark Beast Monsters seemed to have surrounded the group of five people, who looked like tourists. They were crying out for help, facing the main building in fear. Unfortunately, the main building was quite a distance away. It was impossible for anyone to hear them.

“Priest, what shall we do with them?” asked a woman softly. She sounded slightly familiar. She seemed to be one of the staff responsible for receiving the guests at the main building. Mo Fan remembered her rather unique voice. It was so soothing that he could not help but have some wild thoughts.

“Get rid of them; those beasts happen to be hungry, too,” Mo Fan was relatively unfamiliar with the priest’s voice. He had no mercy for the trespassers.

While Mo Fan was still hesitating if he should save the group of innocent people, he immediately heard cries of agony. The tourists who were fleeing for their lives were now lying still in pools of blood. They stood no chance against the deadly creatures.

Human lives were extremely cheap in the eyes of the Black Vatican. Mo Fan let out a sigh as he took a glance at the unfortunate victims.

“Alright, the threat has been dealt with, back to your posts... Yang Qiao, you stay behind and get rid of the corpses. Don’t let the Golden Battle Hunters see them,” ordered the Gray Priest.

“Affirmative, senior!” acknowledged the woman quickly.

Mo Fan could not help but admit that those trespassers were actually a great help. The people of the Black Vatican must have been alerted when Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, Rong Sheng, and Guo Wenyi were snooping around the place. As such, the group of tourists that had been spotted here actually served as a cover for Mo Fan and his crew.

The Dark Beast Monsters quickly vanished. The Gray Priest and a disciple of the Black Clergy had left. The female disciple with the name Yang Qiao was the only one left to clean up the place. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Qiao stayed in the garden. Mo Fan was still hiding on the tree, and watched Yang Qiao, still in her heels, slowly approach a tourist whose face was covered by bloody gashes. She was humming a rather spritely melody.

“You would all have been fine as long as you stayed in the main building, yet you just had to come and get yourselves killed.” Yang Qiao’s voice sounded slightly naughty.

“Let...let me go... I’m begging you, let me go,” begged a young man covered in wounds, grabbing at Yang Qiao’s ankle.

“Mmm? You’re still alive?” Yang Qiao’s lips curled up, as if she was quite astounded.

She walked a few circles around the young man lying in a pool of blood and realized that he was barely injured, as the two adults had desperately tried to protect him. The blood smeared on the young man was actually from the other two dead adults.

“However, you are really out of luck. If had you died just then, you wouldn’t have to suffer again!” Yang Qiao smiled.

She took out a bottle as she was talking. She slowly opened the lid and poured the black, thick liquid onto one of the corpses lying beside the young man.

As soon as the black liquid made contact with the corpse covered in blood, it rotted quickly and evaporated. The gas rose into the air. The skin and flesh turned into a pool of black water, while the bones melted into dust...

In less than ten seconds, the corpse had thoroughly turned into a pile of black goo.

The young man’s eyes widened in shock and fear!

“Here, I’ll pour it slower onto you, so you can enjoy it longer!” Yang Qiao slowly moved the bottle toward the young man and slowly poured the liquid onto him.

The young man’s back festered as a single drop of the liquid touched it. Already covered in wounds, the young man cried out in pain immediately. He sounded extremely eerie in the silent night.

“Hehehe!... I haven’t poured much yet, but you’re already screaming so loudly!” exclaimed Yang Qiao wickedly. Her voice was extremely cold-blooded!

The young man never thought a woman with such an attractive face and soothing voice would be so cruel. She was nothing but a demoness!

Yang Qiao started pouring faster. The smile on her face grew wider.

However, she suddenly felt a strong force grabbing her wrist. She could not even move her fingers.

When Yang Qiao collected her thoughts, the bottle in her hand was snatched away by a man a head taller than her. She immediately turned around, assuming that the clergy did not want her to make too much noise. Instead, she immediately felt a strong slap to her face. Her little face was almost broken from the force. The incredible pain even stopped her from making any sound.

“You are...”

PA! Mo Fan did not give the vicious woman any chance to speak. He simply gave her another heavy slap to the face.

“Ass...” Yang Qiao was about to curse when Mo Fan waved his hand and thrust the Giant Shadow Spike: Twins into the woman’s chest to seal off her movement and mind, preventing her from alerting her associates.

“Who...who exactly are you?” Yang Qiao immediately lost all her strength. It took her quite some effort to utter the words.

“Beautiful like a flower, but with the heart of a poisonous scorpion. The Enforcement Union seriously offered too little a reward for a disciple like you. That being said, even if there’s no reward, I won’t hesitate to kill scum like you!” Mo Fan said from behind Yang Qiao. His voice was extremely cold; he was merciless when treating evil people like this woman!
