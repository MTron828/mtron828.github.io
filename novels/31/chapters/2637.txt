Zhao Manyan had a terrible headache.

It was normal for his Contract Beast to eat the fleshy insects, Lance Spine Bears, and Sharkmen since they were full of protein and nutrients that were useful for its growth.

But how was it going to digest the stones that it had just swallowed?

And yet, the silver-blue creature was enjoying itself. The floating pebbles were arranged in a perfectly straight line. The creature was swallowing the pebbles one at a time, like the video game Snake, without even having to change its direction.

Zhao Manyan was wondering what the pebbles were when a bigger pebble close to him suddenly cracked open.

A claw reached out of the crack and swiftly broke the hard shell open!

An ugly head with deep wrinkles poked out of the crack after the claw made it bigger. It opened its mouth and used its sharp teeth to bite the shell into pieces.

Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, Mu Bai, and Xinxia were left in awe.

“Did an ugly fish just pop out of the rock?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Those aren’t rocks. They are Sharkmen’s eggs!” Mu Bai blurted out.

“The Sharkmen have laid their eggs here and are using the heat of the mysterious feathers to incubate them. No wonder their numbers have suddenly increased. They are treating the Lanyang Earth Core as their reproduction factory!” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

‘The eggs were hard as stone. No one would expect the floating rocks to be the Sharkmen’s eggs. Their numbers were as great as the stones on a mountain, How terrifying would it be if every stone hatched into a Sharkman or a Sharkman Beast?

‘The Sharkmen had treated the city’s sacred cultivation ground as their breeding ground. It had to be why the Sharkmen had insisted on taking over Lanyang. It was rare to find such a perfect and suitable environment in the dark and cold sea. The Sharkmen might be cold-blooded, but they also needed a

source of heat to incubate their eggs!

“Normally, a Sharkman will only grow its teeth after three days, but not only did that Sharkman Infant already grow out its teeth, it is also bigger than normal Sharkman Infants. However, judging by its fins and its head, its lineage isn’t that impressive,” Jiang Shaoxu said as she observed the little

Sharkman.

“These eggs are absorbing the Lanyang Earth Core’s energy!” Xinxia hissed in alarm.

‘The Lanyang Earth Core was ideal for nourishing young creatures. Humans had used it to increase their rate of cultivation, while the Sharkmen were using it as their hotbed to incubate their eggs and make the newborns stronger than usual.

It was the most likely reason why the mysterious feathers had taken the initiative to merge with Mo Fan’s flames and granted their energy to Little Flame Belle. They did not want the power of the Totem Beast to be abused by the Sharkmen!

A crisp sound came from the spacious area of the lake above the group. More sounds followed, like the heavy clanking of a harvester’s blades!

Zhao Manyan looked up and saw hideous figures approaching from the darkness above. They had long gathered to surround the pond where the mysterious feathers had gathered.

The figures moved closer like a net that was slowly contracting, leaving their prey with no escape!

“We are done for. We are going to die!” Guang Songdi screamed as shrilly as a woman. If he had known so many Sharkmen and Sharkman Beasts would appear out of nowhere, he would rather have stayed with the survivors on the surface.

“We have poked the beehive. A battle is inevitable,” Mu Bai said calmly.

He reached out his hand and grabbed at the water in front of him. The water around his hand froze rapidly, turning into an Ice Brush in less than a second.

He swung his other hand around, and the water within his reach began to thicken! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He dipped the Ice Brush into the thickened water and drew a long stroke above him. A white sheet immediately spread outward, taking the shape of a magnificent mountain!

The mountain blocked the Sharkmen who were closing in on them. They tried to ram through the mountain with their strong bodies, but the mountain Mu Bai had drawn was made up of Silver Marrow Ice Amber. Mu Bai’s strength had greatly improved over the last year when Mo Fan was not around!

Guan Songdi was stunned when he saw the mountain suddenly appear in the water. These people were only around his age, yet they were as powerful as gods. The mountain had stopped hundreds of Sharkmen instantly. He had thought the Sharkmen were going to tear all of them into pieces in mere

seconds!

A huge rumble came from the mountain. The group saw two enormous Sharkman Beasts slamming into the mountain Mu Bai had drawn.

The sturdy mountain began to crack. The Sharkmen and Sharkman Beasts were attacking the mountain madly!

After all, the Sharkman Beasts were Ruler-level creatures, not to mention adding in the combined attacks from around a thousand Sharkmen. The mountain began to fracture.

“Mo Fan, you have stolen the source of energy of their breeding ground and driven them crazy. You should lure them away so we can escape through the pipes!” Zhao Manyan called out.

They could not be trapped down here. They were deep in the Sharkmen’s territory. Only a small portion of the Sharkmen had gathered here. If they were pinned down here, more Sharkmen would come soon. They would have no chance of leaving this place alive!

“Sure, T’l go this way,” Mo Fan nodded. He was a Super Space Mage. If he wanted to run away, the Sharkmen would not be able to stop him!

‘Mo Fan purposely unleashed the Phoenix Flame to attract the Sharkmen’s attention.

However, Mo Fan soon noticed the Sharkmen that had broken through the mountain were completely ignoring him. They were heading toward Zhao Manyan instead!

“Holy crap, why are they coming after me? I didn’t steal…” Zhao Manyan abruptly realized that the silver-blue creature had grown round and plump after enjoying a delicious meal was right beside him. It was still carrying several dozen eggs that were about to hatch on its fins.

For Heavens’ sake!

This thing is taking away the food since it didn’t have time to finish them all!

Is taking away even allowed during a buffet?
