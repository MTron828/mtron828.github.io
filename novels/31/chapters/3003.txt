3004 Memory Seal

There was no such sort of burial ritual in Greece, and she had never even heard of using soil from burying a loved one’s cremains to nourish a seed.

But Izisha thought that this method was good. It was better than finding a random place to bury dead people and never getting close to the area within a radius of one kilometer outside this land in her life.

Izisha found a fruit. Fragrant fruit trees were everywhere on the Goddess Peak. The female believers would pick them up regularly, wash them, and send them to the Saintess’ Hall.

“A pear?”

“Yeah, a pear.” Izisha handed it to the middle-aged man.

“Eat it and give me the core.” The middle-aged man glanced at Izisha and felt that she was a little dull-witted.

Izisha hesitated. She was indeed a little hungry as she had not eaten anything since the public speech in the morning.

“I’m going to scatter the cremains.” The middle-aged man opened the urn.

Izisha nodded and took a bite of the pear.

“Why are there so many cremains? I thought it was your relative or something, but it turns out to be a large pet. Is it a Griffin? I often see people here riding griffins.” The middle-aged man immediately made this inference when he saw the huge pile of cremains.

Izisha took a small bite, but she could not swallow it. ‘Forget it. He is not a member, so I don’t have to explain things to him.’

“Yeah, it’s a big Griffin,” said Izisha.

The middle-aged man scattered all the cremains into the pit and then walked to the mountain spring to wash his hands.

Izisha wanted to stop him as the mountain spring was not for washing dirty hands, but he had already put his hands in it. She could only pretend not to see.

After Izisha finished eating the pear, she walked to the edge of the pit full of cremains and threw the core down.

“Alas, why did I wash my hands?” The middle-aged man walked over helplessly. He picked up the soil on the ground to fill the pit, which dirtied his hands again.

Izisha smiled.

The middle-aged man went to the mountain spring to wash his hands for the second time. After that, he bid farewell to Izisha.

Seeing the freshly dug soil on the ground, Izisha remembered what the middle-aged man had said. “Don’t use magic. I know there is a kind of magic that can make trees grow, but don’t use it for this. Just let it grow naturally.”

...

When Ye Xinxia looked up at the mysterious starry sky in the middle of the night, she could not help but think of the past.

Ye Xinxia remembered that when she was a student, the students around her would always be anxious when the exam was approaching. However, she never felt that way because she never relaxed.

She had been in the Parthenon Temple for many years. Just like in the past, she never rested for a second. She knew that working in the Parthenon Temple was not like learning magic. It would be possible for her to take the time to make up for the chapters she missed and ask other people if she was not sure about an area of knowledge. Her decisions and intentions were related to the Parthenon Temple, Greece, and many places that needed the help of the Parthenon Temple.

She had to take responsibility for many things. One thing that made her want to give up the most was that rain of blessings could only fall on one field, while disease in another area would quickly destroy the townspeople.

The town’s survivors would eventually ask her why she let the disease torture them to death. Could it be that the Parthenon Temple was biased?

It was only willing to save those people who were of benefit to them and the wealthy areas that could support the Parthenon Temple with a lot of money.

She had witnessed too many people die over the years. She thought the suffering in Bo City would be the most shocking death she would ever see, but she never thought it was just the beginning. In the Parthenon Temple, she witnessed such things happening all over the world almost every month.

The Divine Soul bestowed upon Ye Xinxia the Resurrection Divine Art.

But the Resurrection Divine Art could only save one person, and hundreds and thousands of others would die.

Diseases, plagues, curses, darkness, wars, monsters, natural catastrophes…

The Parthenon Temple was powerless against these frequent outbreaks of disaster. The real purpose of the Parthenon Temple was no longer to relieve suffering. Everyone was focused on electing and cultivating the next goddess and trying to form a relationship with her power.

Ye Xinxia kept telling herself not to forget why she started. However, she had a problem, which forced her to gather all the power like the previous goddesses and win the position of the goddess at all costs.

If she wanted to execute her plan, she had to change the Parthenon Temple and let it focus on its original purpose.

But how could she change the Parthenon Temple? The only way was to be the goddess.

In a situation where she could not even survive, it was impossible to execute her original plan unless her plan coincided with Izisha’s.

Only by giving up her original plan and gaining supreme divine power could she have the chance to execute her original plan.

There was also another important reason she could not lose to Izisha!

A black stone. The goddess had a black stone.

The gear of fate had returned to its original position, but Xinxia could not let the tragedy repeat!

“Your Highness, the Hall of Knights has been fully controlled, so it is impossible for them to renegade. There are two high priests in the Hall of Faith who will support you unconditionally, but Izisha still has control over the Hall of Judgment,” Tata said in a low voice.

“The situation is clear,” said Xinxia.

“The Hall of Judgment has a close relationship with the Holy City, and what we are most worried about right now is the interference of the Holy City. The quasi-priest you asked me to drive away asked me to tell you that there will be no one in the holy city to vote for you, and they will support Izisha unconditionally,” said Tata.

“Got it.” Xinxia nodded.

“Why are you not worried? You must know that the votes of the Holy City are important. If they all support Izisha, you have no chance of winning. If there’s no other way, you should agree to their conditions. After all, we can’t rely on that person. Everyone in the Holy City wants him to die. Your decision will not affect his final judgment. It is better to make a more sensible choice so that your position as a goddess will be guaranteed,” Tata said anxiously.

Xinxia stared at Tata. Tata did not dare to speak anymore.

“Don’t say such things in the future. When I was young, I faced many such situations. I was powerless at that time,” Xinxia said to Tata in a softer tone.

“Huh? You remember?” Tata was surprised.

Tata had met Xinxia a long time ago. At that time, she was still held in Wen Tai’s arms, illuminating the surroundings like a bright pearl which lit up Wen Tai’s smile all the time.

Tata had taken care of Xinxia from when she was younger than four years old. At that time, Ye Xinxia was the little princess of the Parthenon Temple, but it did not take long for that to change.

“I don’t know why, but I have been remembering memories from the past frequently, as if some sort of memory seal had opened. Some of them are so vivid in my mind,” said Xinxia.
