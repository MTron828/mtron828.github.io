The fiery figure’s height and size were similar to a human’s, or more precisely, its physique was similar to a woman, one that was quite elegant...

Her appearance was very different compared to Mo Fan’s when his figure was engulfed in flames, such as when he cast the Fiery Fist. His flames were only burning on the outside of Mo Fan’s body like a Super Saiyan mode, but the fiery figure was made of fire herself. Even her face was burning in flames. She did have faint facial features, but they were not as detailed as a human’s.

“Can you understand our language?” exclaimed Mo Fan, staring at the Fiery Sorceress.

The Fiery Sorceress floated beside him with an expression that Mo Fan failed to understand.

“Either way, thanks for saving my life...” Mo Fan laughed.

It was true that one who survived a great disaster was destined to good fortune afterwards. Mo Fan never thought the Fiery Sorceress which saved Chen Yi’s mother in the past would save him too, and brought him to the top of the hill.

The Fiery Sorceress looked at Mo Fan, her lips slightly open, as if she were smiling...

Mo Fan glanced at it, and somehow felt her to be a kind woman, even her smile felt so gentle.

“Right, my friends are still trapped in the cave,” Mo Fan recalled something important.

The Fiery Sorceress shook her head, and communicated with Mo Fan using hand gestures, telling him that the lava would not last for long, thus they would have left long ago. He would not find anyone there now. Most importantly, Mo Fan had broken most of his bones, he would need to rest up with the Fire Cloud Fruit for some time.

Mo Fan knew he could not do anything in his current state. He let out a wry smile, and began to converse with the Fiery Sorceress who understood human language.

The Black Totem Snake understood human speech, too. Therefore, when he stumbled into the extraordinary Fiery Sorceress of the North Burning Valley, he was not unprepared at all.

“Can I ask, are you the Flame Belle?” Mo Fan asked firmly, as he took a closer look at the Fiery Sorceress.

The books had mentioned that the Flame Belle looked similar to a woman, and from afar, her appearance was like a glamorous lady standing in a fire, with a hint of sacred air and authority.

Even though the Fiery Sorceress was slightly different from how the books had described, Mo Fan had a strong feeling that she was the Flame Belle.

The people who had seen the Flame Belle had described her as a terrifying creature. Even though the creature would not chase after humans relentlessly, those who infuriated her and trespassed into her territory would suffer the consequences of her wrath.

If this Fiery Sorceress was actually the Flame Belle, she was in fact quite friendly. She had saved Chen Yi’s mother over ten years ago, and also saved him too.

The Fiery Sorceress shook her head, implying that she was not the Flame Belle.

“Oh, you’re asking me what I’m doing here?” Mo Fan understood the Fiery Sorceress’ question from her gestures and replied honestly, “I’m looking for the Flame Belle. I’m a Summoner, I would like to sign a Flame Belle to be my Contract Beast.”

The Fiery Sorceress shook her head, telling Mo Fan that was not a great idea.

“I’m just trying my luck, it’s fine if I really can’t find her,” said Mo Fan.

The night came like dark curtains, while the stars embellished the night sky like shiny jewels. Lying on top of the hill, Mo Fan felt like he was surrounded by the night sky. Even when he was looking into the distance, he could still see the beautiful starry sky...

It was Mo Fan’s first time having such a unique experience, lying on the top of a mountain while chatting with a fiery creature.

However, the Fiery Sorceress seemed to have some matters to attend to. She let Mo Fan had his rest, so she soon left the mountain...

Mo Fan felt it to be a pity, as he could tell that the Fiery Sorceress was no ordinary creature. He could only wait until her next appearance before he could ask her more questions. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suddenly, a chilly gust swept past, followed by an intimidating groan.

Mo Fan had not recovered yet, thus he could barely walk. He quickly glanced at his surroundings, to see if there as anything hiding nearby.

The Fiery Sorceress was aware of the intruder earlier than Mo Fan. She scanned the top of the hill with a sharp gaze...

Suddenly, the red leaves were swept away, like something was crawling rapidly through them.

As the leaves drifted into the air, Mo Fan saw a serpentine creature with fiery lines on it crawling toward them rapidly. Although its size was tiny compared to the Black Totem Snake, it was still around fifteen meters long.

Most shockingly, the creature had three heads. The joint under the heads was fairly thick, branching off into three sections!

As the three heads rose into the air, they turned out to have different colors!

The head on the left was dark brown, with skin like thick armor; it was simply a head made of rock!

The head on the middle was fiery red. Its scales had obvious fiery marks, so detailed that one could simply see the lines on them. Its eyes were blazing red, the gaze from them enough to bring fear to its prey!

The head on the right was a mix of blue and green. The dull color was a clear sign of its poisonous nature, with its fangs exposed in the air, posing a great threat!

Mo Fan was shocked when he saw the three-headed snake.

Although the creature was not as huge as the Commander-level demon beasts he had seen before, its three heads with three different Elements clearly implied that it was no ordinary creature, either!

Mo Fan was not smart enough to identify the creature’s level from its rock head and the poisonous head, but according to Huo Tuo’s apprentice, Li Junnan, he did mention that snakes with higher lineage would have detailed lines on them. The fiery head in the middle had outstanding snake lines on it, which was a clear sign of its level!

The three-headed snake had captured the scent of a human. A creature like this posed the greatest threat to humans, and was also considered the most bloodthirsty.

Councilman Zhu Meng was well aware of the danger of snake-type creatures, hence the reason he had considered the Black Totem Snake at the highest potential threat level.

Mo Fan did not think that the fact that he was close with the Black Totem Snake was enough to scare the fairly strong three-headed creature away. He could sense a chill down his spine when the eyes on the three heads stared at him.

He was also unable to protect himself with Magic due to the severe injuries he was suffering from. Yet, even at his peak, he could easily tell that he was no match for the creature, judging by its overwhelming presence!

At that instant, a pleasant but furious cry was heard not far away.
