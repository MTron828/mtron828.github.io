“If she used to be on the national team, her strength should be on par with Lu Yilin’s!”

“It feels like even if Lu Yilin is still around, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat that Egyptian. Didn’t you see how strong the mummy carrying a giant saber was? The force it unleashed by waving the saber from a hundred meters away was strong enough to penetrate Yue Tangxin’s armor. Do you have any idea how strong it has to be?” the students began to talk among themselves.

Mu Ningxue was quite famous indeed, but everyone could not help but worry after they witnessed what had happened to Yue Tangxin.

“You want to fight him?” Bai Dongwei asked seriously.

“Mmm!” Mu Ningxue nodded.

Since she had become a defender, she could only return to the national team by performing outstandingly and stopping other countries from winning the challenge stamps. Therefore, she would not allow the Egypt team to earn the challenge stamp from the National Training Hall she was defending so easily, especially since it was her first day here!

Normally, Mu Ningxue would respond after considering her opponent’s capabilities. However, her only thought now was to fight her way back to the national team. She was determined to participate in the finals at Venice at all costs. She would not let any country that set foot in China’s National Training Hall go so easily!

“Are you sure? That guy is stronger than most members on the national team,” Bai Dongwei told Mu Ningxue truthfully.

“I wasn’t any weaker than the others even when I left the team,” said Mu Ningxue immodestly, aware that Bai Dongwei and the others were worried about her.

Now was not the time for Mu Ningxue to be modest and reserved, but the time to prove herself!

“Alright, but if there’s any danger, you must back off immediately. I don’t want to see anyone seriously injured like her again,” agreed Bai Dongwei. The instructor had a bad temper, but he actually cared for his students.

“Mu Nujiao, be careful, that Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy is very heavy, and its strength is shocking, too. The Death Saber Mummy is very close to the strength of a Commander-level creature too; it’s going to be a tough fight,” Mu Nujiao cautioned her.

“Mmm,” Mu Ningxue nodded.

She walked toward the stage, followed by a trail of frost. As she set her foot on the steps, they froze suddenly.

Sayed was observing Mu Ningxue. His proud gaze seemed to be intrigued by Mu Ningxue. The beautiful women from eastern countries had their own unique temperament, calm and elegant. They were rather conservative, unlike the women in Egypt, but at the same time, their appearance was very eye-catching.

“Are you seriously sending another girl to the fight? Are you telling me your National Training Hall is lacking men worthy enough to be my opponent? I will make it clear; my undead are extremely violent! If your flower is hurt, I shall not be condemned again!” Even though Sayed was admiring the woman’s beauty, he did not lower his proud stance.

He had seen lots of gorgeous women, and he would not easily surrender because of the silver-haired eastern beauty!

“Are you sure you can represent your team?” asked Mu Ningxue calmly.

“Do you take me as a smartass that came alone to challenge you without the team’s permission? Even if that’s the case, you should still be embarrassed about how weak your team is!” Sayed continued to look down on them. The moment he set foot in this country, he had assumed it was an underdeveloped, traditionalist and weak country. There was nothing worth mentioning about the country, apart from its size.

Humid air, heavy smog from air pollution, and pampered Magicians who could not accept their defeat. In Egypt, even if someone died in an official duel, the family of the deceased had no right to condemn the winner. Losers would just bury their heads and run away!

“Let’s begin,” Mu Ningxue reminded Bai Dongwei.

Bai Dongwei was still hesitant. He had only heard Mu Ningxue’s name before, but he was not too sure about her actual capabilities. As an instructor, he could sense that Mu Ningxue was only an Intermediate Magician. It was almost impossible for an Intermediate Magician to defeat Sayed’s undead!

“The duel... starts now!” Bai Dongwei finally declared the start of the fight.

Sayed was grinning. He was annoyed by the crowd’s nonsense. He could not wait to defeat the woman so he could regroup with his team.

He would not mind going easier on the woman as a way of appreciating her beauty and attractive physique. After all, he was still a true man who would react normally to a beautiful woman!

“Attack!” Sayed ordered. His pupils emitted a flicker of eerie light. The command was immediately transmitted to the minds of his undead.

His undead were actually dead puppets and extremely obedient to their master. The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy dashed forward as soon as it received the order.

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy was surrounded by a cloud of turbid air. It started roiling as the undead lunged forward like the engine of a train blowing out black smoke.

Mu Ningxue’s lips murmured softly, like an icy goddess summoning the icy fairies nearby.

The Ice Element gathered around Mu Ningxue rapidly. The particles were very tiny. Even the combined size of a hundred particles was smaller than a single dust particle. They were like formless air, invisible, but they truly existed.

“Ice Domain!” Mu Ningxue’s eyes glittered. The temperature of the air dropped rapidly. Her feet slowly lifted off the ground as her Domain was established, and she started floating!

The air had turned into ice, filling the area within a hundred meters of Mu Ningxue. The frost filling the area was unnoticeable at the start, but the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy’s speed significantly reduced in the process.

Every step it took would produce cracking sounds from the ground, covering the sound made by its stiffening joints.

“Wind Track!” Mu Ningxue controlled the wind. A strong gust of wind spiraled under her feet as the frost lingering in the air showed the wind’s motion...

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy dashed forward and threw a strong punch, blowing the slowly falling frost away like sharp knives.

Mu Ningxue glided back. She nimbly dodged aside with an easy kick when she sensed the strong force approaching her!

Her hair drifted wildly in the wind. However, the force was unable to damage her winding locks. It only left an aftertrail as it went by, implying that it had traveled past Mu Ningxue’s ear.

The Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy continued to chase after Mu Ningxue, yet it kept missing its punches. It only broke the frost in the air and ice covering the ground.

“Such quick reactions...” Bai Dongwei’s eyes glittered when he saw Mu Ningxue’s outstanding evasive ability.

Bai Dongwei could easily tell that Mu Ningxue was incredibly experienced in fights just by looking at her control of the Wind Element. She was already one of the strongest students among the defenders!
