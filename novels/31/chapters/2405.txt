Mo Fan was not an expert at tracking down demon creatures.

It would be difficult to track down a Ruler-level Magic Wolf in the mountains. It might take a whole month.

The Hunters doing the live stream were not trying to hunt a Ruler-level wolf. Their job was to track it down.

Normally, an entire Hunter Group would be involved in an S-rank quest. It would have professionals look for traces of their target. It would also have specialized fighters and hire experts on the wolf species.

The reward for the quest was ten figures in size. It made sense to send out a huge group for the job when they did not have a Senior Hunter among them.

The Wizard Bird Hunter Group had accepted the job. The Hunter Group had made a reputation for itself in recent years. It had managed to kill Ruler-level creatures before, and since it was active in the mountains in the south, it was familiar with the demon wolves there.

They were also Lu Qingyao and the vendor’s main source of demon wolf lineages and bones!

Mo Fan stayed in Bo City for a few days. He waited until Tomb Sweeping Day before bringing a bag full of body ash over to the cemetery.

He also decided to cultivate in Bo City after he was done.

He now had a Universe Vein, a great resource to break through to the Super Level. His Summoning Element, Space Element, Chaos Element, and Earth Element were still at the Advanced Level. It was time to improve his cultivation!

He went into seclusion to cultivate. His goal was to improve the Space Element to the Super Level!

——

Time passed very quickly. Mo Fan always lost track of time whenever he was cultivating.

His Mental State had already reached the sixth level. It was considered stable and powerful.

The Space Element did not have Soul Seeds, as they were replaced by the Mental State.

Some academics had outlined comparisons between them. The sixth level of the Mental State was comparable to a Soul-grade Seed. The seventh level was comparable to a Lesser Heaven Seed.

A Mage’s cultivation was the foundation, while the level of the Mental State was amplification!

Diligent training was essential to improve one’s Mental State. Improvement in cultivation would also make the Space Element stronger!

——

The Universe Vein was as effective as expected. Mo Fan almost thought he did not have enough luck, as the odds of failing to break through with a Universe Vein were between thirty to forty percent, but he successfully broke through the barrier around his Space Element’s Galaxy in the end.

The silver light spread and expanded into a bigger zone. It contained a glowing liquid that was slowly orbiting around the Stars like celestial rivers.

“It’s a blessing from Bo City,” Mo Fan murmured after opening his eyes.

Perhaps the souls of Bo City had blessed him for giving them peace on this last Tomb Sweeping Day!

Mo Fan’s attempt to improve the Space Element to the Super Level was a great success. Mysterious silver energy filled up his mind. As he shifted his gaze to the objects around him, he could even see a string connecting them.

He could turn them into his weapons with but a single thought!

“My Mental State has improved too, but I’m still some distance away from reaching the seventh level,” he mumbled to himself.

A lot of abilities were different after reaching the Super Level.

Telekinesis still worked the same way, but in the past, Mo Fan had to focus his attention on a specific object to control it.

Now, he felt like he was carrying a magnetic field around with him. Every object within the field was on standby!

——

Mo Fan went for a walk.

Things as tiny as a rolling can on the ground or as big as a commercial building had silver frames around them in Mo Fan’s eyes. They showed that Mo Fan could move them with his Space Element if he wanted to.

“What date is it today?” Mo Fan asked a little kid on the side of the road.

“It’s the third,” the little boy stared at Mo Fan suspiciously.

“Oh, does that mean it has only been two days?” Mo Fan murmured. He had started cultivating in seclusion on the first. “Don’t you have school today?” Mo Fan followed up curiously.

“We have three days of holiday from the first of May. Are you stupid?” the little boy shot back.

The boy’s mother came out of a shop and scolded him, “Xiao Dong, why are you talking like that?”

Mo Fan had an awkward expression. Why were the kids so mean nowadays?

It was already past the first of May? Holy crap, he had been cultivating in seclusion for an entire month!

At his current level, the process of meditation would place his body in stasis, and he would not grow a beard. He would not feel hungry, as his body’s metabolism slowed down. It was like having a long dream. He had no idea how much time had passed after he woke up.

A loud alarm went off.

Mo Fan shuddered when he heard the alarm, especially on Bo City’s streets. Bo City had turned blood-red after the same alarm went off in the past!

“It’s so annoying. Why did it go off again?” the little boy called Xiao Dong yelled out.

“Why aren’t you treating it seriously? It’s a military drill. The alarm is telling us to evacuate to safety. If you hear three consecutive alarms, you must immediately run to the underground shelter. Do you understand?” Xiao Dong’s mother warned him.

As soon as she finished the sentence, the third alarm went off.

It lasted for quite some time. The pedestrians were very calm at first. After all, it was common for military drills to happen after Bo City had turned into a fortress city, but they had never heard the third alarm sounded before.

The military drills only involved the first and second alarms. The third alarm meant it was a real alert!

“Mother?” Xiao Dong pulled at his mother’s shirt.

“Quick, let’s find a place to hide!” Xiao Dong’s mother grabbed her son up in her arms. She looked a little lost, but subconsciously searched for the closest shelter among the signs.

The atmosphere on the street had changed instantly.

Mo Fan remained standing there with a blank face.

What is going on?

The people were obviously used to the drills. They might be in a panic, but they were moving to the shelters in perfect order.

Battlemages appeared on the street to maintain order and guide the people to the emergency shelters. They were well-trained.

The street was emptied in no time, leaving only a few Mages who were searching the buildings and houses to make sure no one was left behind.

The whole process was done very quickly!

If the people of the old Bo City had such awareness when the Red Alert was sounded back then, the casualties would not have reached five figures!

“Sir, I’m a Hunter. May I ask what’s happening? Why was the alarm sounded?” Mo Fan asked a skinny soldier passing by.

“Humph, it’s all the Hunters’ fault! Recently, a Hunter Group killed a male Ruler-level wolf. They did help us eliminate a huge threat, but they didn’t tell us they also took the five pups of the Ruler-level wolf. It drove the female Ruler-level wolf crazy.. It has come to seek revenge!” the soldier huffed at him.
