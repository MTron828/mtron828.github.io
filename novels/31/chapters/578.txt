“A Senior Hunter!”

“Oh, Senior Hunter, when did you come to the Ancient Capital?”

“Who’s this? Why are you calling him a Senior Hunter?” Someone from the Magic Association nudged a Hunter beside him.

“You don’t know Senior Hunter Du Xiao? He’s an expert on the Xuan Ranking...” replied the Hunter, with a hint of admiration.

Mo Fan did know who the person was. When the Mother Scale Skin Phantom was stirring up chaos in Pearl Institute’s auditorium, this guy was the one who descended from the sky riding a blue creature with large horns. He totally remembered how imperious the sight was.

Meanwhile, his subordinate was a feminine man wearing a leather jacket, who was somehow related to the Clearsky Hunter Agency. Lingling always referred to him as Yao Nan.

( Boxno vel. co m ) Mo Fan glanced around and saw Yao Nan, who was as skinny as a woman, and wearing a faint blue jacket. He did not step forward into the limelight after Senior Hunter Du Xiao, but went up to Mo Fan instead and smiled, “So, tired of killing demon beasts, so you came to try killing undead instead?”

Mo Fan shrugged and said, “I didn’t expect to stumble into so many familiar faces here in the Ancient Capital.”

“Well, since the undead are stirring up chaos here, didn’t you think that us few who like to poke our noses into other people’s business would also be here?” laughed Yao Nan.

Mo Fan did not chat with Yao Nan, but fixed his eyes on Senior Hunter Du Xiao instead. He had met this respected Senior Hunter a long time ago, yet he had never witnessed his true strength. He most likely would have the chance to do so in this upcoming battle to protect the walls.

As expected, Senior Hunter Du Xiao was very influential. Advisor Zhu, who had firmly insisted on not putting the lives of the leaders here at risk, felt at ease when he saw the guy.

“HAHAHAHA, you came at the right time!” Zhu Meng went up to greet Du Xiao.

“If I knew a Gathering Signal would summon the famous Senior Hunter Du Xiao here, I would simply give up on my Plant Element and focus on my Light Element instead!” the instructor smiled.

“Advisor Zhu, I can’t guarantee that everyone will be unharmed during the battle against the Undead Ruler, but at least our chance of winning is higher now. At the very least, I will bring some of them back alive. The Dark Abyss has appeared, and the Phantom Tyrant Emperor is commanding the undead inside the Dark Abyss. If we don’t kill it immediately, more Warrior-level and Commander-level undead will be awakened. It will simply break a huge hole open in the Northern Walls!” Senior Hunter Du Xiao cut straight to the topic with a stern look.

“With you here...” Advisor Zhu compromised in the end. It was true that he could not find another way to resolve the situation within an hour. He had no choice but to proceed with the strategy that they had prepared earlier!

“Alright, we have enough Super Magicians here. It’s time to allocate the men!” said Fei Jiao.

“The Phantom Tyrant Emperor has a bunch of Skeleton Generals, Zombie Generals, and Phantom Generals protecting it. The Skeleton Generals and Zombie Generals are not a big deal for us. We can easily stomp our way through, but the White Serene Ghosts led by the Commander-level Ghost Officials will be huge trouble to us if their numbers are too overwhelming. If I’m not mistaken, I don’t think any of us here have control over the Psychic Element?” said Lu Xu.

“That’s our biggest threat in eliminating the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. Either way, we still have to eliminate the creature. In our original plan, it’s the most difficult part of the plan, but...” said Zhu Meng, while stroking his beard.

Councilman Zhu Meng turned around and glanced at the forty-some Magicians who had expressed their willingness to participate in the battle.

“Everyone, I’m sorry, but the situation is much worse than we described earlier. We’ll need your help to eliminate the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. Of course, us Super Magicians will handle the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. We only need you to get rid of the biggest threat: the White Serene Ghost Officials and the White Serene Ghosts under their command!” said Councilman Zhu Meng.

The group remained silent. The truth was, they had clearly heard the conversation between the leaders. However, going out of the city and fighting against the undead was a whole different story than defending the walls. It would most likely be a one-way trip!

“Everyone, our operation here is precisely planned. If it weren’t for the fact that every soldier available was allocated to protect the walls, we wouldn’t be gathering everyone here with four Gathering Signals. Don’t worry, you won’t be fighting the Commander-level creatures, nor are you being asked to fight packs of Warrior-level creatures. You just need to keep an eye on the Light Formations and make sure they work, so we can defend ourselves from the Psychic disturbances of the White Serene Ghosts...” the Commander explained in detail when he saw the hesitation among the Magicians.

“Councilman Zhu Meng is going out there fighting in the front line, how can we back off now?” a retired Battlemage stepped forward.

“The city lies behind the city walls, where my parents and family are... so, please count me in. I don’t feel like leaving such an important task in someone else’s hands,” a Hunter with scars on his face stepped forward boldly, too.

The students were the most passionate, as fighting side by side with Super Magicians was considered a huge glory for them. Several of them quickly signed up. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m joining too!”

“If I want to back away, I would have done so when I saw the signal. Count me in.”

Zhong Zishan glanced at the students under his lead. He was about to ask their opinions when Jiang Li, who wanted to contribute, and Zhou Ming, who was fairly righteous, volunteered for the battle.

Mu Bai hesitated for a while before deciding to join, too.

The handsome student, on th eother hand, did not speak. He seemed to have no intention of putting his life at risk.

It was something they could not force anyone to take part in. Zhong Zishan did not say anything. He patted the man’s shoulder, signaling him to leave the place if he did not want to join the operation.

“Zhong Zishan, how about you?” asked Zhou Ming.

“I promised your teacher to look after you. I’ll go for sure,” Zhong Zishan smiled.

“How diligent, but I feel like our teacher won’t be fond of you still!” mocked Jiang Li.

“It doesn’t matter. I’m a man of my words.” Zhong Zishan glanced at Mo Fan instead.

Mo Fan shrugged and said, “I’m here on vacation, so I wish you all good luck.”

“Seriously, Mo Fan?” said Zhou Ming disappointedly.

Mo Fan did not explain further. He was not obliged to save the world. Besides, even though the walls were guarded by Magicians, they would still need more help here. It was enough for him to fulfill his role as a Magician. He would leave the risky operation to those who were passionate enough to contribute and protect their nation while putting their lives at risk.

“Humph, I thought you’re impressive, but you’re still a coward nonetheless! You’re not worthy to be called a Magician!” said Jiang Li, as if he had suddenly become superior to Mo Fan.

“Asshole, if you say another word, I don’t mind hanging your head out on the walls to drive evil away before the undead dig your intestines out!” Mo Fan spat at Jiang Li coldly.

“Alright, everyone can make their own choices!” Zhong Zishan quickly interfered.

Meanwhile, Yao Nan, who was standing aside uttered a weird chuckle.

“What are you laughing at!?” snapped Jiang Li, his face colorful.

Yao Nan remained laughing. After a while, he finally said to Jiang Li, “Hey fatty, if everyone who the man you just scolded as a coward has saved simply spit at you, it would be enough to roll you away like a Rolling Wave spell!”
