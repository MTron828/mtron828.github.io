“You little piece of shit, take this!”

Ferrero’s voice suddenly came from the other side of the lake as Mo Fan and Mu Bai were still discussing their escape route. They immediately saw sturdy rocks rising up from the water and forming a cage to trap the young Medusa!

“F**k me, why did that idiot act now!?” Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai blurted out at the same time.

How stupid was that guy? Not only was he trying to get himself killed, he was dragging everyone else into the mess, too! Mo Fan was seriously regretting his decision of joining hands with these unreliable teammates who were as stupid as pigs!

“I’ve trapped her!” Ferrero smiled, as if he had achieved an impressive act that could possibly save mankind. He was only waiting for flowers to be thrown at him and rounds of applause!

It turned out that a person could really be influenced by the people they hung around with for a long time. Mo Fan was seriously impressed by how smart Ferrero was!

What did he think a Medusa was?

The Eyes of the Rock Demon was actually a spell that mimicked the Medusa’s stare! Did he seriously think the Advanced Earth Spell was going to trap a snake demon with the ability to control the soil and the ground?

The young Medusa’s angry screech echoed throughout the Sunset Shrine. In just a few seconds, similar cries returned from all directions. It was like all the fireworks and firecrackers when the clock hit twelve at the New Year. There were only a few cracks at the start, but they were soon followed by a series of deafening blasts!

“Quick, do it now, we can’t let her run away!” Mo Fan decisively jumped out of the bush. He flew across the lake while the Dark Material in the vicinity swiftly gathered toward the young Medusa. The entire lake had turned into Mo Fan’s Dark Swamp Domain!

“Damn it, why did it turn into mud!?” Ferrero grumbled anxiously.

His Earth Element was naturally ineffective against the Medusa! With a single glance from the young Medusa, his sturdy cage of rocks had turned into a pile of silt. The cage collapsed and scattered on the ground!

Luckily, Mo Fan had established his Dark Swamp Domain. It completely sealed the young Medusa in a maze of darkness before she could flee into the bushes. She had completely lost her sense of direction!

“Don’t use the Light Element. My Nyx Regime can trap her for now! Quick, use any powerful spell that can suppress her. We only have a little over a minute left!” Mo Fan yelled at the others.

The Light Element would drive Mo Fan’s Nyx Regime away. Even the slightest gap would allow the young Medusa to flee!

“I’ll seal her off!” Mentor Vani finally made his move. However, he did not cast a Super Spell.

Vani was a Super Earth Mage, but his Super Earth Spell was not going to do anything to the young Medusa, either. He cast an Ice Spell instead. An icy coffin appeared above the young Medusa, who was running around wildly in the darkness in panic. The strong energy froze the young Medusa and the whole area she was in!

“Ice Lock: Chain Formation!” Mu Bai immediately summoned icy chains after seeing someone had already cast the Icebound Coffin.

The thick chains of ice wrapped around the Icebound Coffin and formed two walls to trap the young Medusa as soon as she forced her way out of the Icebound Coffin.

The frost of the Icebound Coffin spread continuously, leaving the young Medusa no way to escape. Her tail was already covered in layers of ice!

“Will Cannon...” Heidi spread her arms and focused her Will on the young Medusa.

“Don’t kill her, we need her alive!” Mo Fan quickly stopped Heidi when he noticed she was trying to use a powerful attack.

Mo Fan had witnessed the strength of Heidi’s Will Cannon. Even the Giant Snake Demoness had almost died to it in a single blow. The young Medusa was clearly weaker than the Giant Snake Demoness. There was no way she would survive the hit!

Heidi obediently followed his instructions. She quickly withdrew her Will and focused on the noises in the surroundings.

“We are going to be surrounded soon!” Heidi said.

“She’s still resisting, does anyone have other spells to suppress her? Use it now!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“Man-Eating Plant!” Zoey finished Channeling her Plant Magic.

A Man-Eating Plant covering an area over a hundred meters square rose up from the dark swamp close to the walls of ice chains. Its rows of sharp teeth resembled the jaws of a great shark, and it swallowed the chains, the Icebound Coffin, and the young Medusa with a single bite!

“Let’s go!” Zoey said decisively.

“You got her?” Mo Fan was startled.

“Yes, my Man-Eating Plant will put her to sleep. Don’t worry, I won’t kill her!” Zoey said.

Mo Fan glanced after the enormous Man-Eating Plant that had swiftly sunk into the ground in shock. It turned out that Zoey was the real ace of the European University Institute. The enormous Man-Eating Plant could even swallow some Great Commander-level creatures!

“Time to go, follow the fluorescent light on the ground. Someone clear a path ahead!” Mo Fan said.

“I’ll do it!” Mentor Vani agreed promptly.

The environment was not suitable for Earth Magic, thus the Super Earth Mage was not any stronger than the students when his Earth Element was not available.

“Apas, climb onto my back,” Mo Fan squatted down. Apas, who was hiding behind a rock, quickly grabbed the jacket that she had wrapped around herself like a dress and jumped onto Mo Fan’s back, wrapping her arms tightly around his neck.

“Big brother, are we going to die? There are so many snake men out there!” Apas asked worriedly.

“Don’t worry, I’m very strong, we won’t die! Besides, I’m going to find the scumbags that kidnapped you, too! They must be punished!” Mo Fan turned around and smiled.

Apas felt a lot more relieved, staring at Mo Fan’s face from the side. She dug her head into Mo Fan’s back.

“Mo Fan, should I carry her instead?” Zhao Manyan asked while they were running.

“Piss off!” Mo Fan snapped. What was ZHao Manyan even thinking in a situation like this? He was the one that had stumbled onto the little beauty. How could he possibly allow Zhao Manyan to harm her?

“Zoey has the young Medusa...” Mu Bai said thoughtfully.

“I know, we’ll worry about it after we’ve found a safe place. We’ll have to decide if we are going to join hands to fall out with them according to the situation...” Mo Fan said.

“What falling out?” Heidi was slightly behind Mo Fan as she asked quietly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Keep an eye on our rear!” Mo Fan told Heidi.

Heidi frowned. She had a feeling that Mo Fan was hiding something from her...

“Our operation will be quite successful if we can make it out of here,” Zhao Manyan suddenly said.

“You better not say something like that in the wild,” Mu Bai said superstitiously.

“I agree!” Mo Fan swore aloud...
