Chapter 1768: Dingcheng Is Under Attack

Translated by XephiZ

“Ambush of the Rock Shark!”

Mo Fan was able to complete the Star Pattern more quickly every time he cast the spell. He no longer had to wait until the Rock Monster was close enough before Summoning his powerful Bright Rock. A golden-brown rock sprang out of the wall fiercely and intercepted the Rock Monster in mid-jump.

The golden-brown Bright Rock’s penetrating power had obviously improved. A Rock General was already struggling against it, let alone a Rock Monster. The Rock Monster’s body immediately broke into pieces in midair after it was struck by the spell.

An instant kill!

Normally, when two heavy objects collided with one another, the sturdier one would remain while the other would break. Mo Fan might struggle against the Rock Monsters without the Bright Rock, but the Rock Monsters were no longer a threat with the combined power of the Bright Rock and his Intermediate Earth Spell!

A feeble man appeared amid the falling rocks. Mo Fan had been expecting it. He quickly jumped down after defeating the Rock Monster to catch the young man who was covered in ash.

“It’s Senior Kang!” Tao Jing exclaimed in joy.

“Time to go, the rest of them will soon catch up to us,” Mo Fan held the guy with the surname Kang with one arm while cursing in his heart.

Damn it, why the hell is this guy so heavy? He’s almost a hundred kilograms. What if I happen to loosen my grip?

He shouldn’t bother going on a dangerous adventure if he’s so fat. He couldn’t even outrun the demon creatures if anything happens! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Mo Fan was panting heavily after carrying the man to the surface. Lin Qihui and the others had obviously left. It was indeed quite infuriating, indeed; why couldn’t there be a little more trust between people? He had only asked them to leave after ten minutes as a rough estimation. Couldn’t they stay for another five minutes? Who was going to carry the fatty who weighed almost a hundred kilograms back?

Mo Fan dragged the fatty along the ground. The guy happened to be covered in ash, which acted as a layer of protection around him.

Dusk had come, and the lights of the city were visible in the distance. Mo Fan, Tao Jing, and Zhou Donghao descended the mountain tiredly, dragging the fatty with them.

“How long is it going to take them to set up the goddamned Barrier Core!?” Mo Fan grumbled.

Mo Fan was so annoyed by the fact that he could not use his other Elements. Even dragging a man down the mountain was so tiring for him!

“They should be done pretty soon... did you hear the noise?” Tao Jing listened carefully.

“No, what noise?”

“It seems to be coming from the city!”

—

The land between the ravine and the city wall was covered in clouds of dust. Thunderous roars were echoing in the sky.

Countless huge rocks were being tossed at the rampart like there were a few hundred catapults at work. The rampart was an important part of the city’s defense, yet it was already in ruins from the damage dealt by the rocks!

“Where did so many Rock Monsters come from? Didn’t we already send people to investigate the ravine? Where’s our troop? Why haven’t they returned yet?” Lu Bin of the Magic Association asked, perplexed.

They had expected the Barrier Core to attract demon creatures to it. After all, the Barrier Core contained a ridiculous amount of the energy the demon creatures were fond of. On the other hand, they also would not want humans to set up a defensive perimeter in their territory.

The Magic Association and the military had already taken all this into account. They had checked thoroughly and remained on alert throughout the process, yet the city was still invaded by a strange type of creature. They were caught unprepared by this catapult strategy!

“It’s the Rock Monsters that have been showing up recently,” Wen Xia said.

“I know that, these cunning creatures are staying out of our soldiers’ range. They just kept tossing boulders at us to destroy our defenses! They must be after the Barrier Core, we can’t let them come any closer!” Lu Bin shouted.

Behind Lu Bin stood a group of Mages in light brown outfits who seemed well-trained. They emitted a strong presence of the Earth Element even when they were not casting any spells.

They were the Brown Rock Mages of the city’s Magic Association, whose primary Element was the Earth Element. They were the people whom Mo Fan and the students were planning to learn from, yet a tricky species had shown up before the students even had a chance to learn from them!

The roars were suddenly coming in sync, like rolling drums. The Rock Monsters finally lost their patience, giving up on the catapult strategy. They began to charge at the city like tanks!

There were around three hundred of the creatures. The defenders were put under great pressure when they saw the bulky creatures sprinting across the land. The Battlemages and the Brown Rock Mages holding their positions on the rampart subconsciously took a step back.

“Don’t be intimidated by their aura. The city is about to become the greatest inland capital of the Earth Element. It’s going to provide your family and future generations the safest home ever! When the city achieves greatness in the future, the people will be praising your names. Everyone is going to remember your names!” Lu Bin stood on the command post on the rampart and motivated the Battlemages with a loud voice.

The battle was too important. An Elemental Capital was at stake, and its destiny was tied to even more few headquarters cities along the coast. It was supplying the coastline with stones, so if the city were successfully constructed, it would guarantee the coastline a stronger defense.

“Prepare to engage the enemy, no retreat!” Wen Xia was the person in charge of the military. The Battlemages straightened up after receiving his order. They showed no signs of fear when facing the Rock Monsters that were charging at them.

“Prepare the Rock Barriers!” Wen Xia lifted her arm and swung it when the Rock Monsters reached a certain distance.

The Battlemages on different levels of the ramparts cast Intermediate Earth Spells simultaneously. Brown lights began to spread across the rampart like fireworks.

The Star Patterns gathered their energy at the sunken land in front of the rampart. The ground underwent tremendous changes under the influence of over a hundred Earth Mages. Huge ravines appeared together with tall emerging walls. Powerful spikes also stuck out from the ground and stabbed at the Earth Monsters!

The ground shook vigorously. Mo Fan, who just descended from the mountain happened to witness the spectacular sight. He could feel the strong impact as the magic and the Elemental creatures crashed into one another, even though the land was covered in darkness.
