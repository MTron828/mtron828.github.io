Chapter 2439: Crossbreed Dragon or Pseudo-Dragon?

Translated by XephiZ

The little cub suddenly remembered something. She bit Mo Fan’s pants and tried to pull him in another direction.

“What now? Are you regretting it?” Mo Fan asked helplessly.

The little cub had a thick coat of fur. Things started falling to the ground and clanking loudly as she shook herself. It was surprising how many things she was hiding under her fur!

The little cub growled and waved her paws around.

“Little Flame Belle, can you translate for me? What surprise is she trying to give me?”

The little cub lowered her head and picked up a small jade bracelet, before running into Mu Ningxue’s room. She cautiously placed the special bracelet in front of Mu Ningxue’s door before running back to Mo Fan.

“What? You followed us to Mu Clan Mountain?” Mo Fan opened his eyes wide. “You took all of this from their treasure vault?”

The little cub put on an embarrassed face.

She told Mo Fan she was secretly following Mu Ningxue so she could lend her a hand if anything went wrong. She could at least help Mu Ningxue escape!

However, Mu Ningxue was unstoppable after she took out the Ice Crystal Bow. The little cub had decided to sneak into the Clan Hall and take some valuables since she had nothing else to do.

If the Mage there at the doorstep of the Forbidden Level had not sensed her presence, she would have robbed the entire treasure vault!

Mo Fan was left speechless.

Aren’t you supposed to be the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain? Why do you keep stealing other people’s stuff?

“I bet that Ice Jade Bracelet will be useful for her recovery. Are you giving the rest of the loot to me to thank me?” Mo Fan said.

The little cub nodded. She finally had a valid purpose to stay on Fanxue Mountain thanks to Mo Fan. She was willing to offer up her possessions! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“No wonder your mother keeps asking you to come home. She’s likely worried that you might be beaten to death if you were caught!” Mo Fan had to say.

The little cub had unique tastes. She would only take things that were extremely valuable!

The other four items might not be as valuable as the Ice Jade Bracelet, but each of them was worth a decent ongoing business.

Mo Fan just so happened to be running short on funds, too!

The little cub told Mo Fan that there was a rare Sacred Lotus in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. It would be a thousand years old after the next winter. She promised to pluck it and give it to Mu Ningxue to extend her lifespan and help her retain her youth!

Mo Fan was greatly pleased. The little cub had been a huge help in solving his biggest problems!

Mo Fan headed back to the Magic City after staying at Fanxue Mountain for a few days.

The Clearsky Hunter Agency was in the Magic City. He was planning to accept a few jobs to fill up the black hole that had sucked away all his money.

He had always thought he would be rich after becoming a Mage, but he later realized that he still needed money for everything after reaching the Super Level, and it was huge sums every single time!

“Mo Fan, I found something great. Are you interested?” Zhao Manyan called him as soon as Mo Fan reached the Magic City.

He had finally come out of seclusion. It seemed he had almost mastered Wu Ku’s Water Praying Beads!

Mu Bai was in the Magic City, too, acting as a member of the South Wing Platoon. He had spent most of his time at its headquarters in the Magic City lately, but Mo Fan was not sure what he was busy with.

“Don’t tell me it’s some special show of human body art again?” Mo Fan asked righteously.

“Of course not!” Zhao Manyan replied forthrightly.

“Then I’m not interested,” Mo Fan immediately switched tacts.

“…” Zhao Manyan just shook his head. “Just call Mu Bai and come with me.”

Zhao Manyan had a lot of connections in the Magic City. Whenever he said he found something, he usually meant women, but Mo Fan was quite surprised when it was not the case this time.

The pedestrians shouted out in glee when a group of Heavenly Eagles swept past the sky. After all, unlike helicopters, the Mages who were permitted to fly their Heavenly Eagles in the city were not only well-respected, but had high statuses in the military.

The magnificent Heavenly Eagles’ feathers were white as snow. The silver feathers on their crowns were long enough to reach their backs, giving them a sleek dignity.

The Eagles flew across the Magic City in an orderly fashion and landed on a nearby island. A few men and women in suits and formal attire greeted them on the landing pad.

“You must be General Zhang! This way, please,” the tuxedo-wearing man in front said respectfully to a middle-aged man, the oldest of the soldiers there.

“You’ve misunderstood. This is our general!” the middle-aged soldier smiled and pointed at a younger tanned man.

The man did not have a handsome face, but he gave off a heroic temperament. His tanned skin further set off his demeanor.

The man in a tuxedo was shocked. This general looked so young!

Based on the information he had reviewed, this general had been in charge of the safety of along the Qinling Mountains and Beijiang for a long time. Both places were infamously dangerous, but the demon creatures had not invaded their territory even once after this general was placed in charge.

“General Zhang, we have heard that you are very interested in our tamed beasts. I’m here to receive you on behalf of the Bai Clan. May I know if you are representing the military, or you’ve come in your own interest?” the man asked him courteously.

“We will soon join the Violet Imperial Battalion. Every member needs a mount more powerful than the Heavenly Eagles, so we are interested in what your exhibition has to offer,” General Zhang answered with a friendly smile. He was not as aloof and expressionless as were most generals.

“The Violet Imperial Battalion…” The Bai clansman was surprised. They were a special force that was only sent out for important missions, even though it did not have many members.

“Please come with me, a few of our honorable guests haven’t arrived yet. I hope you won’t mind waiting a little longer. After all, our exhibition isn’t just a small project. It’s open to famous people from across the world,” the representative of the Bai Clan told him.

“That’s fine, we have not rested for a long time. Please arrange a few rooms for my men and myself.”

“Of course!” The man immediately signaled a woman in a cheongsam.

The woman greeted them with a smile and asked the other women present to lead the way.

“General, please feel free to tell us if you need anything. It’s rare to have a reputable guest like you,” the woman in a cheongsam told him. Her eyes were very attractive, reminding him of a flowing stream.

“Oh, I heard dragons will be auctioned this time. Is that true?” General Zhang asked her.

The woman blinked. It turned out that the general was not that experienced, and did not notice her obvious hint.

“Yes, we are working together with a renowned clan of dragon tamers in England. They have new tamed dragons to offer.”

“Are they crossbreeds or Pseudo-Dragons?” General Zhang inquired.

The woman smiled. She placed her finger in front of her sexy lips and answered after a brief pause, “That is confidential.”
