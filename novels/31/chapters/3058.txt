3060 The Holy Judgement Court

In order to ensure thousands of years of peace in the human world, the “great” archangel killed an emperor-level Undead as soon as he returned to the city. He also used despicable means to force Zhan Kong to show up. He was the one who drove Zhan Kong and Qin Yu’Er over the edge and made them unable to survive in the world.

It was Archangel Michael…

Mo Fan highly suspected Michael was the one who gave the order to Shalitha to come up with a devious trick to force him to become the Wicked God and to make him show up under Holy City’s searchlight.

If not for the fact that Sharjah had taught Mo Fan the divine oath and proposed he surrender himself so that he could buy some time with the rise of public opinion, the Holy City army would have controlled everyone around Mo Fan the second day after he became the Wicked God. Holy City would also have stripped Mo Fan of his right to survive in the world, just like Zhan Kong.

!!

Michael was ruthless enough to do anything. Qin Yu’Er was the best example.

As such, Mo Fan could not put himself in an absolutely passive situation, especially if the Holy City army laid its hands on other people in the name of investigation.

…

Mo Fan put on clean clothes.

He was handsome and dashing. Despite wearing an ordinary shirt, he was able to bring out an air of luxury.

Today was the day of Mo Fan’s court appearance. He was unsure of the specific stage of the trial. Everything was under Holy City’s manipulation. Holy City had controlled public opinion in the direction they wanted. Besides, Sharjah’s controlling power had been stripped. Mo Fan was basically at the mercy of Holy City.

As he walked up to the Holy Judgement Court, Mo Fan stood in the center, like a colorful finch inside a large, luxurious cage. Those around him saw him and criticized him. He would face the divine magistrates who heard the case.

The divine magistrates came from the Holy Judgment Court.

Under normal circumstances, the divine magistrates could determine the crime of the accused. The divine magistrates were the ones who decided most of the criminals’ crimes. Mo Fan finally knew that the divine magistrates from the Holy Judgment Court were no more than small fries. It was the people who held the Black and White Stones that could decide if he was acquitted or being cast into the dark abyss.

“Leng Lingling, you have represented the Hunter Union and spoken about the bounty events. Those could not serve as evidence to show how Mo Fan does things. Everyone is aware that the hunters are profit-seekers. They are willing to take up dangerous tasks for the sake of the high bounty. The countries along the coast faced many terrifying situations, and the Drowning Curse has brought those countries a lot of benefits. However, we knew Mo Fan did it for the sake of the bounty and not purely a good deed,” said Ramiel who was the Chief Divine Magistrate.

“Regarding the plague that happened in Croatia, we didn’t receive any monetary reward,” said Lingling.

“It was caused by the Red Demon’s doppelganger. We took it that Mo Fan was the one who set everything up,” said Ramiel.

“You have to show evidence of his crimes. If you can’t prove that it was Mo Fan who set everything up himself, that meant he didn’t do it,” said Lingling.

“We don’t have any evidence, so we’re not going to talk about it. Well, Leng Lingling, today we’re here to hear about the murder case of Parade Angel Shalitha. According to our investigation, you were present at the scene of the murder. Therefore, we won’t accept any evidence from your investigation,” said Ramiel without hesitation.

“Shalitha has destroyed the Twin Guardian Towers. No one survived his mass destruction. I’m the only witness. If I can’t be the witness, who else will testify?” refuted Lingling.

“Based on our investigation, it’s true that Shalitha was the one who destroyed the Twin Guardian Towers with his magic. However, according to some white parrots’ feedback before Shalitha’s death, the Red Demon had taken over the Twin Guardian Towers. As a result, everyone became its parasite. If the Red Demon was the one who set up the plague in Croatia, then Mo Fan could be the one setting everything up in the Twin Guardian Towers as well. Shalitha noticed that things were about to get out of hand in Twin Guardian Towers. In order to prevent the criminals in the East Guardian Towers from escaping to society, Shalitha decided to destroy the Twin Guardian Towers that had been under the Red Demon’s control.” Ramiel continued to read from the book.

Lingling sucked in a deep breath. She tried to control herself from exploding in the Holy Judgement Court.

The Holy Judgement Court was truly shameless!

They insisted on the version they wanted and ignored all the clues and evidence.

Lingling found the people from the Ancient Capital, Northern Xinjiang, the Magic City, Egypt, Alps Mountain, St. Ojos Institute, and so on and so forth. There were a total of more than a thousand witnesses who had witnessed Mo Fan saving the citizens and their cities many times. Moreover, the people were representatives from their organizations. They wanted to prove to Holy City that Mo Fan’s Demon Element would not threaten their safety. Instead, his power allowed him to help more people.

After more than a month of recording and deposition, Holy City did not bother about their personal statements.

Holy City overturned everything that Mo Fan had previously done on the ground of his atrocities in Dubai.

Furthermore, they ruled that Mo Fan’s soul had been contaminated with dark creatures when he entered the Dark Plane.

It was true that Mo Fan had killed many people in Dubai Mage Tower at that time. Most of the people were Su Lu’s lackeys. They were also orthodox members of the Magic Association. Mo Fan’s act of violence rendered his massive witnesses to lose their credibility.

“Mo Fan, even though you have various reasons for killing Shalita, you should hand those who have violated the magic conventions over to us. You cannot execute them privately. Otherwise, we won’t even have the chance to find out the truth. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Take you as an example. Can we execute you as soon as we see you in Holy City? If that’s the case, you won’t even have a chance to stand here. Similarly, we have to figure out the truth and remain impartial. You should give those people a chance to stand here and be judged. You can’t execute them on the spot!

“Do you agree with me, Divine Magistrate Zu?”

After he finished speaking, Archangel Ramiel deliberately turned to Divine Magistrate Zu Huanyao.

Zu Huanyao was a Chinese representative divine magistrate. Since the court trial started, he had not spoken a word.

At that moment, Lingling felt extremely annoyed. Zu Huanyao was a douchebag. He was no more than a high-class lapdog of Holy City. He had not done anything favorable to Mo Fan thus far.

“I disagree with you,” said Zu Huanyao.

Archangel Ramiel looked puzzled. Still, he made an inviting gesture, signaling Zu Huanyao to continue his words.

“Isn’t Archangel Sharjah always the one who handles the issues in Dubai? Mo Fan and Sharjah are the students of the Chief of China Magic Research Association, Feng Zhoulong. They attended a conference in Dubai. Feng Zhoulong and the other scholars from various magic research associations were brutally killed. At that moment, Parade Angel Sharjah also faced a life-threatening situation. Shouldn’t Archangel Shalitha be called to clarify the matter?” said Zu Huanyao.

“Archangel Sharjah has other matters to deal with right now. She cannot appear in court for the time being,” said Ramiel.

“It doesn’t matter whether Sharjah can appear in court. What matters was Mo Fan was defending Holy City by killing the people in Dubai,” said Zu Huanyao.

“How was he defending Holy City?!”

“He killed the people who had victimized Sharjah. He protected the Parade Angel. Isn’t protecting a Parade Angel tantamount to defending Holy City? If the Parade Angel cannot represent Holy City, then the strife between Mo Fan and Parade Angel Shalitha has nothing to do with Holy City. Mo Fan didn’t declare war on Holy City. We can transfer the case to the Asian Magic Association to do the trial,” said Zu Huanyao calmly.

Ramiel and the other divine magistrates were stunned upon hearing his words.

Zu Huanyao remained silent for a very long time, but the moment he spoke, things turned out differently.

Hand the case over to the Asian Magic Association?

What a joke! The Asian Magic Association was the only Magic Association that discouraged Holy City from giving a trial to Mo Fan. Handing Mo Fan over to the Asian Magic Association was no different from acquitting him!

It looked like Zu Huanyao had been waiting for that moment all the while.

“The Parade Angel represents Holy City. We can’t hand Mo Fan over to the Magic Association,” said Ramiel decisively.

“Then, Mo Fan’s atrocities in Dubai are also invalid. We can judge that Mo Fan can control his Demon Element Magic. Moreover, thousands of representatives swore to Holy City that Mo Fan is an absolutely righteous and kind person.

“A righteous and kind person can cast a controlled forbidden spell. Hence, we can’t deem that person as the ultimate disaster maker. We can at most sentence him for abusing the forbidden spell.” Zu Huanyao skillfully articulated his logic.

Upon hearing his words, the rest of the divine magistrates, juries, and the crowd in the Holy Judgement Court fell silent.

Who would have thought the divine magistrate who represented Asia and China would take Mo Fan’s side? He even spoke with such reasoning that rendered everyone speechless!

Lingling stared at Zu Huanyao in puzzlement.

‘This fellow turns out to be one of our own!’
