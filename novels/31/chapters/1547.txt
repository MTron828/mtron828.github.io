Mo Fan closed his eyes and set up a circle with the Dark Material as a defensive perimeter. If anything came close to the perimeter, the Dark Material would alert Mo Fan right away.

Mo Fan needed to rest peacefully.

Mu Bai and Heidi leaned against some rocks and soon fell asleep. Vani too was worn out, too. He lay on a pile of sand, snoring heavily.

Apas leaned against Mo Fan and breathed softly, like a little stray cat.

Their hostage Gangma no longer had any energy left, and was unable to pose any threat to the group. They did not have to worry too much about him.

The reign of the deathlight began as the evening came to an end. The serene light emitted by the Great Pyramid of Giza over a hundred kilometers away shone down upon the Bargo Land and the city. Eerie cries came out of the ground, which was surprisingly quieter than the demon creatures during the day. However, it was just the calm before the storm, a sign that the undead and the demon creatures were gathering their forces. A huge battle would erupt in less than three days. When the time came, Cairo and even the entire Bargo Land would be trembling from the marching of the enemy troops!

——

Mo Fan was able to fall into a deep sleep without the Curse of Vengeful Eyes disturbing him.

He sensed an emptiness in his heart while he was asleep. He had an urge to wake himself up a few times.

However, he was just too tired. His instincts failed to wake his worn-out body.

The temperature dropped significantly past midnight. Mo Fan realized that not everyone had sturdy flesh like him. Apas might die to the cold...

He woke up and instinctively tugged the little stray cat closer to him to help her survive the icy night.

He soon realized there was nothing on his arm!

That immediately woke Mo Fan up. He took a closer look beside him and realized that Apas was no longer there!

Apas had been sticking close to him for the past few days. She was constantly hiding in his arms, as if it was the only safe spot for her, even when she was sleeping.

However, she was no longer there. Mo Fan immediately had a bad feeling!

Mo Fan rose to his feet and looked around him.

Strong anger burned in his chest. He had purposely set up a perimeter with the Dark Material to prevent any outsiders from coming closer when they were asleep, yet he had forgotten something very important. Someone on their team had been a coward since day one!

“Vani, if anything happens to Apas, I swear I’ll seize you from the European University Institute and crush your skull by trampling on it!” Mo Fan was furious. The Dark Material gathered around him like cunning soldiers, forming a terrifying shadow around him.

Mu Bai and Heidi were awakened by Mo Fan’s angry words.

“What’s going on? What happened?” Mu Bai was given a great fright by Mo Fan’s icy appearance.

“Apas, Vani, and Gangma are missing!” Heidi exclaimed.

Mu Bai looked around him and finally saw the three were missing.

He was utterly confused; everyone might be asleep, but they never dropped their guard. Who was capable of kidnapping them without alerting anyone?

Hang on, that wasn’t it!

If the guy was that capable, why didn’t he take them out instead? Mu Bai did not believe that the army would be so nice as to spare their lives after they discovered what the soldiers were up to!

“It’s Vani... he took the others?” Mu Bai asked in astonishment.

“Why would he do that... isn’t he a mentor of the European University Institute!?” Heidi struggled to believe it.

“His identity doesn’t stop him from being a jerk!” Mo Fan’s chest heaved with rage.

Mo Fan knew Vani was not trustworthy, yet he did not expect the man to believe Gangma’s words so easily!

If the man did not want to stir up any trouble and provoke the army further, Mo Fan would not be so angry. Everyone had the right to make their own choices. However, Mo Fan could not tolerate his action of taking Apas away too!

How could Vani not know that the army was more concerned about Apas than them?

If Apas survived, their ugly doings would be exposed to the world. They would be condemned by their people and the world. If the truth was disclosed to the public, it did not matter how powerful the person responsible for it was, he would lose all his power and status in an instant, and would have nowhere to hide!

The army could spare Vani and his students’ life, as long as they did not mention a word about what they had done.

The army could also let Mo Fan and his crew go, as long as they promised to forget what they saw.

But there was one person they could not spare, even if it meant eliminating the people of the European University Institute, Mo Fan, and his crew, regardless of their identity. They could not afford to let her live!

Her being alive was the best evidence to prove them guilty. Without her, no matter how the European University Institute, Mo Fan, and the others accused them, no one would believe them... but if Apas told the world what she had gone through...

The army was after Apas; she was even more important than the young Medusa!

Cairo was currently at war with the Pyramid of Khafre. The army was the city and the country’s only hope. If the military found out that one of their leaders was responsible for the despicable act, they would still consider making Apas disappear for their own sake!

Therefore, Mo Fan would never have handed Apas over to the army. Even if Fenna personally asked him, Mo Fan would not agree to it. Even if Fenna was an honest person, it was part of her job to prevent Apas from influencing the morale of the army.

The assh*** Vani had compromised by handing Apas over to the army. She was most likely as good as dead!

It was the reason why Mo Fan was so furious!

“Mu Bai, Heidi, find a spot and hide, wait for Brianca,” Mo Fan said.

“What do you mean?” Heidi asked with a confused look.

“She might already be dead now, but I can’t just let it go,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not afraid of trouble, but he was not naive enough to go up against an entire army. If Apas was still alive, he might still have a chance to save her, but if Apas was dead, Mo Fan would never forgive the soldiers that were involved!

Soldiers that committed any crime were usually tried in a military court. Other factions or people had no right to accuse them!

Mo Fan would rather kill himself than be told not to kill anyone. There was no such thing as compromise in his beliefs. However, killing people like Gangma and Saks was surely going to infuriate the Egyptian army. The army would never forgive Mo Fan!

Things were about to get serious. Mo Fan did not want to involve Mu Bai and Heidi.

“Mo Fan, you’re not the only person with a pounding heart. I’m not Zhao Manyan, I’m not afraid of death!” Mu Bai said.

“If I do nothing, I’ll be living in guilt for the rest of my life!” Heidi agreed firmly.
