Zhou Donghao did not dare behave recklessly in front of Tao Jing, but he kept glaring at Mo Fan, hinting that Mo Fan should give up on the seat.

Mo Fan completely ignored him. The guy responded with a menacing look, clearly waiting to get some revenge. He sat on the back seat in a bad mood.

The bus began to move. Mo Fan focused on practicing his control of the Earth Element’s Star Orbits. He was finally able to complete the Star Orbit with ease after practicing it for more than a week. His casting speed had improved greatly, too.

However, Mo Fan was not satisfied with just the Basic Spell of the Earth Element. He used the abundant energy hoarded by Little Loach from its recent upgrade in an attempt to break through to the Intermediate Level of the Earth Element.

His Earth Element would be a lot stronger after reaching the Intermediate Level!

It was different from cultivating the Element slowly, like he had in the past. He was confident that his Earth Element could reach the Intermediate Level if he was diligent enough. He worked on it during the time the journey to Dingcheng was going to take.

The people on the coach began chatting not long after Mo Fan closed his eyes. Mo Fan could hear them, but it did not distract him.

“I heard Dingcheng always has rich resources of the Earth Element. If I’m lucky enough to find an Earth Soul Seed there, I will be able to make a name for myself at school!”

“Yeah, the place is rich in resources, but they are all hiding in the Forest of Rocks, which has terrain as complicated as a maze. There’s no way we can find a Soul Seed, unless we have an experienced mentor with the Earth Element guiding us. Finding a Soul Seed isn’t as easy as plucking wild mushrooms by the side of the road,” a relatively older student replied.

He was the organizer of the trip to Dingcheng, having gathered a bunch of students with the Earth Element for the trip. He had introduced himself prior to the departure; his name was Lin Qihui, and he was Tao Jing’s senior.

“So none of you has a Soul Seed, haha!” Zhou Donghao laughed proudly.

“Brother, what Soul Seed do you have?”

“Silt Rock!” Zhou Donghao subconsciously raised his voice as he answered proudly. “It will turn the ground under my target’s feet into a swamp that is difficult to break free from whenever I cast my spells!”

“Impressive, doesn’t that mean your opponent will struggle to move around!?”

“Of course! I would have a higher rank if my other Element wasn’t so useless,” Zhou Donghao declared.

“Speaking of which, Lin Qihui, aren’t there rumors about some terrifying creatures showing up in Dingcheng? Are you sure it’s safe for us to go there?” someone asked.

“Don’t worry, a few mentors with the Earth Element from the Magic Association will be around. It will only take them seconds to take care of the creatures. There’s nothing to worry about. We will benefit a great deal just from observing and learning from them!” Lin Qihui answered firmly.

The students chatted continuously on the coach. Mo Fan filtered out the useless information and took in the bits related to the Earth Element that he found useful from their discussion while he was meditating.

Everyone’s path of cultivation was different, but it was not so obvious when they had only learned the Earth Element at the Basic Level. However, the way people used their Earth Element greatly differed once they reached the Advanced Level.

Mo Fan remembered one of the gatekeepers from the Sacred Hall of Liberty in the United States of America was an Earth Mage. He had imbued his muscles with the magic of the Earth Element to turn himself into a brown Hulk. He was unmatched in close combat. Mo Fan could not remember his name, but his way of using the Earth Element was quite unique, suprising his opponents in fights!

Mo Fan was not planning to use his Earth Element solely for defensive purposes. No matter how hard he worked, the defense of his Earth Element would never compare to a turtle-shell Mage like Zhao Manyan. The defensive ability of Manyan’s Earth Element was ridiculous!

However, the Earth Element could be used to attack, and it could be very strong, too!

Mo Fan was planning to look for a suitable Earth Soul Seed during the trip to the famous Dingcheng, to start on his own path of the Earth Element!

“Speaking of which, how did Vani of the European University Institute even do that?” Mo Fan fell into deep thought.

Mo Fan remembered when he snuck into the military town in Cairo and fought Vani, who was a very strong Earth Mage. The Hillock Whale he had cast had taken Mo Fan by surprise.

The enormous rock whale that sprang out from the ground like the soil was water was big enough to devour an entire building. Its massive and sturdy body possessed great destructive strength. Not only could it smash anything into pieces, it could even slam down on its target like a moving mountain!

Mo Fan had a strong first impression of Vani’s spell. He was wondering how to Summon a super rock whale from the ground and make his enemy tremble before its formidable presence!

“I will need at least the energy of the Star Constellation at the Advanced Level to Summon such an enormous whale...” Mo Fan was still thinking as he got down from the bus.

They had yet to arrive at their destination. They were only getting a breather at a rest stop along the journey.

Mo Fan was not going to take a piss. He went to a spot with solid ground, covered in grains of sand, and began to draw a Star Orbit! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The seven Stars of the Earth Element were connected with a single thought. It was a big improvement from his slow casting speed before. If he took too long to cast his spells, an enemy could easily dodge them, or even interrupt them!

“Hillock...”

Mo Fan pointed his finger at the ground his Earth Magic had covered.

The ground cracked open quickly. A rock creature resembling a fish leapt out from the gap!

Mo Fan was going to yell Hillock Whale imperiously, but he was lost for words when he saw the rock-fish leap into the air... and break into dust after falling to the ground.

That was no Hillock Whale, it was only a golden-brown carp! He wondered if he should take a picture of it and post it on his news feed to wish people good luck!

“Ugh, is the difference really that huge?” Mo Fan rubbed the back of his head.

Mo Fan was struggling to accept how big the difference was. Not only was the rock carp too small to fit on a plate, it had only reached a height of two meters with its leap. Its appearance was not that intimidating, either, and it had even failed to dive back into the ground. It had smashed itself into pieces instead!

He needed more practice!

Seriously, he needed a LOT more practice!

He had to reach the Intermediate Level! The Rock Carp he could Summon then would be a lot bigger and stronger. Otherwise, people who knew him might call him an Earth Mage, but people who were clueless might think he was an entertainer!
