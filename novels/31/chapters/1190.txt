Mo Fan looked at the girl. Xinxia had always been gentle and soft in front of him. She would obey every decision that he made for her.

However, judging from Xinxia’s stern face, Mo Fan could tell that she was trying to tell him something very serious. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You don’t need to say it; I already knew,” Mo Fan interrupted her.

He knew what Xinxia was trying to say. It was not difficult to come to the conclusion. Even if Asha’ruiya had not spilled the beans before, Mo Fan already knew the truth.

However, Xinxia was Xinxia, Salan was Salan. No one knew better than Mo Fan that despite the two being bonded by blood, they were completely different people!

“Xinxia, I understand what you think, but none of it is your fault. No child can choose who their parents are. Even if you have the blood of a Cardinal of the Black Vatican, it’s fine as long as you still have a clear conscience. Besides, if anyone really wants to argue that, you are Wen Tai’s daughter. The contributions he made easily override the sins that Salan has committed. To be fair, you were never in the limelight like Asha’ruiya, hence they had no right to put the blame on you just because you are Salan’s daughter. You are who you are!” Mo Fan declared.

Mo Fan knew it was something both he and Xinxia had to face.

Xinxia was able to activate Salan’s blood stone because she was Salan’s daughter. Mo Fan seriously had no idea that Salan was actually so close to him. He even saw her when he was still a kid. The woman had abandoned her daughter and left her in the hands of his father, and had never checked up on her...

Tangyue also told him that Salan had only shown up in Bo City because she was seeking assistance from Great Deacon Hu Jin, Mu He!.

Perhaps even Mu He had no idea that Salan had a daughter who had settled down in an ordinary family close to the Mu Family’s villa.

Without that incident, the truth would never have been revealed. Mo Fan was utterly astounded when he first learned the truth, but he did not mention it to Xinxia. Mo Fan hoped Xinxia would never learn the truth, Her mother was a woman who could not bear the loss of her husband; her mother was cruel enough to abandon her daughter who could not walk; her mother was the sinful, vicious Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican!...

Xinxia was obviously a lot smarter than Mo Fan thought. Perhaps she had always concealed her wisdom under her gentle expression, standing aloof from worldly affairs.

“Brother Mo Fan, I understand, but I have made up my mind after thinking about it for many days. I want to stay here and take the role of the Goddess from Izisha.” Xinxia’s eyes were not soft as they normally were.

Mo Fan rarely saw such strong determination from her. He believed she had indeed made up her mind.

However, how could Mo Fan not worry about leaving her in such a dangerous place?

Haylon was startled too. He asked curiously, “You want to compete with Izisha?”

Xinxia was simply too young and weak. If it wasn’t for the Hall Mother’s support, Xinxia would never have become a Saintess. She did not have many supporters, she did not have a strong influence; having a pure and kind heart was nowhere enough to be the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple!

The Soul of the Parthenon Temple might have chosen her, but it did not mean she was the Goddess. The Goddess had to have the ability to lead the Parthenon Temple and adapt to whatever situation she found herself in.

In Haylon’s eyes, Ye Xinxia was far from qualified to be the Goddess!

Xinxia looked at Haylon and asked seriously, “Knight Haylon, do you seriously believe Izisha isn’t behind all this?”

“I believe it’s her doing, as I never believed she would die so easily to some sickness,” Haylon admitted blatantly.

“Brother Mo Fan, my parents are still related to me. I can easily put the matter aside using the excuse that they are them, and I am who I am, but instead of being a bystander and watching even worse things happen, I want to learn how to be strong and take care of myself. I want to learn how I can face these inevitable conflicts... I can’t just let Izisha claim the role of the Goddess, and I can’t watch my mother take innocent lives without feeling any sense of guilt.

Xinxia slowly lowered her head, “I know Brother Mo Fan won’t agree, but I’m sorry, Brother Mo Fan, I’m going to stay, even if you don’t agree. It’s the right choice for me, and something I want to do from the bottom of my heart.

“I’m sorry, Brother Mo Fan, you have tried so hard to save my life, but I didn’t listen to your arrangements... I’m sorry...”

Xinxia’s eyes were filling with tears. She had made the decision so that she could face her complicated identity and herself, yet she could not afford to face Mo Fan. He had gone into Hell to drag her out of misery... but in just a few days, she had jumped right into it again. She was surely going to let Mo Fan down.

Mo Fan fondled her face and wiped away the tears. He chuckled, “You say you want to be stronger, yet you keep crying so easily...”

“Brother Mo Fan, I was worried that you were going to be angry,” Xinxia sobbed.

“Why would I be angry with you?” Mo Fan consoled her.

Mo Fan looked at Haylon and asked, “Fatty, is there any rule forbidding the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple from marrying someone?”

“Who are you calling a fatty!?... The Parthenon Temple is sacred and free. Every member of the Hall of the Goddess, from the Probationary Servants to the Goddess, are free to engage in relationships as they wish. However, the Goddess is usually too busy to care about relationships. Most Goddesses have been single,” Haylon snapped back furiously.

“Oh, good then,” Mo Fan nodded, and said to Xinxia, “I agree that the Parthenon Temple can’t afford to have a Goddess who doesn’t have the Soul of the Parthenon Temple.”

The Spell of Resurrection was just too important in this world, which was always in danger.

Xinxia was willing to stay at the Parthenon Temple despite everything that had happened. It showed how determined she was.

Izisha had already sworn that she would not harm Xinxia. The Dark Contract was currently in Old Bao’s hands, so Mo Fan did not need to worry if Izisha was trying to set Xinxia up. Meanwhile, the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights was appointed to be Xinxia’s Guardian Knight.

Haylon was more than worthy to take on the role. Mo Fan was relieved after learning that the fatty was looking after Xinxia’s safety. After all, Mo Fan was quite worried that Salan would try to do something to her after learning her true identity. Xinxia was just a nobody before, but she now had the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. If she continued to stay at the Parthenon Temple and fully mastered the Spell of Resurrection, Mo Fan strongly believed that Salan would find a way to abuse Xinxia’s power!

“Haylon, you better take good care of her. If she is missing a single strand of her hair, I will tear your Parthenon Temple down!” Mo Fan said.

“Humph!” Haylon harrumphed coldly, yet he did not say a word.

Haylon was well aware of Mo Fan’s capabilities. The Parthenon Temple could still handle Mo Fan on his own, but the man was able to bring the Black Totem Snake with him too! The demon and the Black Totem Snake could really raze the Parthenon Temple to the ground!

“Then... I’ll be going. I’ll come visit you if I miss you, and if you’re not comfortable here, I can come pick you up anytime. too,” Mo Fan said as he entered the teleportation portal.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan understood the Parthenon Temple was where Xinxia belonged ...both her temperament and her character had seemed to merge with the Soul of the Parthenon Temple. Perhaps she could inherit Wen Tai’s will and become the Goddess respected by the whole world!

“Knight Haylon, are you willing to support me?” Xinxia watched Mo Fan leave. She hesitated for a moment before asking Haylon with a serious face.

Haylon was startled. Wasn’t this Goddess a bit too straightforward?

“I...I’m willing! Even though you don’t have the traits of the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple, you have the heart of a Goddess that thinks about the people of the world. It’s our honor that you are willing to stay behind and compete with Izisha. You will beat her one day! Their cunning and dirty tricks will only triumph temporarily, but mercy and kindness is the true spirit of the Parthenon Temple, and I believe it’s the reason why the Soul of the Parthenon Temple has forsaken Izisha!” Haylon declared firmly.

Haylon was relived that Mo Fan did not bring Xinxia away with him.

Xinxia was easily the worst candidate in history for the role of the Goddess, but she was currently the Parthenon Temple’s only hope. Izisha’s cold-bloodedness would eventually lead the Parthenon Temple to destruction. As the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights, Haylon was far more willing to support Xinxia!

Izisha soon learned that Ye Xinxia did not leave.

The Great Muse serving Izisha clearly saw the calm smile on her face disappearing as her face began to twist!

“She wants to compete with me for the role of the Goddess...” Izisha’s voice was icy. “She wants to compete with me for the role of the Goddess!” Her voice turned sharper.

Slowly, Izisha burst out laughing, her body shaking vigorously. She kept repeating the same phrase. “She wants to compete with me for the role of the Goddess?! HAHAHAHA!”
