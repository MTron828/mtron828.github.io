Chapter 1027: Mo Fan’s Set-up

___Translated by XephiZ___

Edited by Aelryinth

Even though Mo Fan had used his remaining Time Liquid to secure the victory, he did not feel it was a waste, as he had earned quite a lot from looting the Dark Swordmaster!

The Dark Swordmaster did not give him a Soul Essence. If it actually had coughed up a Soul Essence, Mo Fan would be rich instantly, as a Ruler-level creature’s Soul Essence was normally sold for billions!

But even the Ruler-level Soul Remnant it did have was extremely valuable. After the Little Loach Pendant took it away, it immediately refined ten Warrior-level Soul Essences for Mo Fan. If he could actually have sold them all, it would have been worth a total of two hundred million.

Unfortunately, Mo Fan could only use them to strengthen his Stars. The project he initially thought was going to be a lengthy one was suddenly shortened by half. As a matter of fact, Mo Fan always ended up the biggest winner in a huge-scale battle like this. Even if the undead did not give him any loot, their Soul Remnants alone were of great value to him!

Apart from the Dark Swordmaster’s Soul Remnant, Mo Fan had also managed to preserve its Undead Crystal perfectly.

A complete Undead Crystal was extremely valuable, since it was able to replenish a Mage’s energy. The Ruler-level Undead Crystal was most likely worth a hundred million if he was to auction it.

He handed it to Zhao Manyan since he knew Zhao Manyan could help him sell it at a good price. With this, it seemed like he finally might have enough money to buy a Soul-grade Lightning Seed with a Domain!

“Mo Fan, give me the Undead Crystal, the Ruler-level creature’s armor and sword, and I’ll sell them for two hundred million for you! How’s that?” Zhao Manyan decisively proposed.

“Two hundred million? Is that even possible?” Mo Fan asked in astonishment.

The Dark Swordmaster did not drop any rare loot, nor did it drop a Soul Essence or some other valuable parts. Mo Fan thought it was impressive if he could sell the loot he acquired for a hundred million.

“Why not? It’s still a Ruler-level creature; many rich people across the world are interested in collecting the corpses of these Ruler-level creature, especially something like the Dark Swordmaster! Those rich merchants with huge houses like to collect them to intimidate their business competitors.

“On the other hand, they can also scare some demon creatures off. If you can forge a statue of the phantom horse, and fill up the armor to resemble a figure with the sword in its hand, the villa’s level would immediately skyrocket! There are lots of rich people, but not all of them are able to use the corpse of a Ruler-level creature as a decoration. Besides, the Dark Swordmaster’s armor fits the tastes of the Westerners; I can easily help you sell it at a good price in Europe, and it might actually be worth more than two hundred million!” Zhao Manyan said confidently.

Zhao Manyan was born into a business family. He knew the things that rich people were willing to invest in.

The Ruler-level Dark Swordmaster was a bodyguard of a Pharaoh, not to mention the imperious-looking armor and giant sword would easily attract many people that wanted to find something to decorate their mansion. It was common for collectors to spend hundreds of millions on a few art pieces, let alone a guardian statue refined with a Ruler-level creature’s corpse!

“Doesn’t that mean I can finally get a Soul-grade Lightning Seed?” Mo Fan was excited when he saw how confident Zhao Manyan was.

It seemed like he had enough money to get himself a Soul-grade Lightning Seed. Once he had one, he would no longer feel helpless when fighting against an Executioner of the Black Vatican like Philip!

“You’re almost there. I’ve got the connections; when we arrive in Italy or Paris, I promise I’ll get you a sick Soul-grade Lightning Seed. Say, I’m confident enough to say that I’m the disciple of the richest renowned family in China, but even my family isn’t ambitious enough to get me a Soul-grade Seed. When you get yours, I bet even the members of the American team will be reluctant to fight you,” Zhao Manyan said.

It was true that every powerful Mage walked the path on their own.

A grass-roots Mage probably would not have access to an abundant supply of resources in the range of ten million, let alone anything over a hundred million. However, whenever these grass-root Mages reached a certain height, they could easily earn lots of resources by themselves, and their growth after being self-reliant was usually more impressive than disciples of renowned families who were too reliant on the resources provided.

A Mage’s cultivation was not something that could be obtained with just mere resources. Any resource would simply be a waste for someone untalented, but Mages who had reached their current heights by their own hard work had learned the secret of becoming stronger by probing the way ahead themselves, and they also knew how to break through by fighting endlessly. Even when they were covered in bruises, they would break through the cocoon and be reborn again. Over time, they would leave Mages of a similar age who over-relied on their families far behind!

Zhao Manyan was starting to believe it when he looked at Mo Fan.

The man had outstanding talents, yet he had decided to take the difficult approach by clearing the path with his bare hands. It would not be long until he finally broke out of the cocoon. By then, he would be so far ahead that others would no longer have a chance to catch up to him.

The presence of the undead completely dissipated after a huge rain. There was not a hint of strange odors in the air.

Even Heaven was paying its respects, sending rain to Puccini City to celebrate. A country like Egypt usually would not see a single drop of rain for half a year.

Pushing Xinxia’s wheelchair, Mo Fan walked slowly forward. Every step he took, he could pick up Xinxia’s alluring scent as the breeze swept past.

-How can her smell be so pleasant?- Mo Fan had the urge to lead her deep into a deserted alleyway where no one could respond to a person’s cry for help. He could not help it; as a man who usually ate meat, the vegetables he cooked himself felt almost tasteless.

Lots of flowers blossomed after the rain. It was not a common sight, since they were in a desert country.

There were not many people in the garden. The people had gathered in the square to celebrate the victory with dancing, singing, wine, beautiful women, and delicious food.

Sitting on a bench, two hundred seventy degrees blocked off by trees, Mo Fan gently carried Xinxia over. However, he immediately frowned as he noticed something, “Why are you even lighter now? Did you not eat well in the Parthenon Temple?”

It was unacceptable for her to be any lighter, as some parts would no longer be as bouncy when he fondled them!

“It’s not that, maybe I’ve been training too hard,” Xinxia replied softly.

“Training hard means you should be eating more. Look at me, my physique and my muscles are energetic, and are able to provide you with a sense of security,” Mo Fan carried Xinxia and placed her on his leg to display his strength.

Xinxia was unable to walk, thus she was like a little lamb without the wheelchair. She immediately became a prey of the pervert trying to take advantage of her.

For some reason, Xinxia’s legs were particularly attractive, perhaps because they were well protected since she could not walk. The tender, milky-white sheen, combined with the soft, but bouncy touch of her slender legs... they were simply perfect!

Mo Fan placed his hands on Xinxia’s legs. The man was obviously going to take advantage of the woman when no one was around.

Mo Fan knew it was important to pick the right place for a date. A bench three-quarters blocked off, and a giant sandcastle with rarely anyone passing by, it was almost like a room with no escape...

Someone might ask, why didn’t he pick a room if he was trying to do something evil?

Mo Fan would simply look at the person disdainfully. How naive, even women who normally behaved like dudes would immediately know what a man was up to if he invited them to his room to talk, let alone a shy girl like Xinxia. The mission was doomed to fail, unless the woman was as desperate as the man was!

On the other hand, a park with a good environment, fresh air, and not many people was the perfect place for him to commit his crime. With just a little teasing, the shy woman would instantly submit to his will!

Xinxia was totally unaware that she had been set up by Mo Fan. Her mind was still occupied with the battle they were involved in not long ago.

As a matter of fact, Xinxia was terrified when Mo Fan was fighting the duel of the Dark Contract.

She thought she had finally caught up to Mo Fan, but it turned out that he was still way ahead of her. There was nothing she could do to help, apart from feeling worried!

“By the way, I’m actually curious about something,” Mo Fan said in a serious voice while fondling Xinxia’s legs.

“Mmm?”

“Aren’t your legs pretty sensitive?” Mo Fan said.

Xinxia blushed instantly. -What is this bad guy thinking? If he keeps moving his hands up, she...she would...-

“If you can still feel your legs, why don’t you have the strength to walk?” Mo Fan asked.

It was not like Xinxia could not stand or move her legs, but whenever she tried to move them, she would suddenly lose her strength and feel pain. It was quite dumbfounding, since if it was some kind of sickness, why couldn’t the Parthenon Temple heal her and allow her to walk like a normal person, if they could even resurrect dead people?

“I don’t know,” Xinxia lowered her head. She would normally feel down when she thought about her legs, but Mo Fan was crossing the line. It was no longer as simple as fondling her legs!

“Don’t...” Xinxia could feel her ears burning. Why would someone act so recklessly in public?

“Perhaps, it’s not a sickness, but there’s some other reason to it,” Mo Fan deduced.

“May...maybe, mm, mm, Brother Mo Fan, let’s take a walk instead,” Xinxia could feel herself heating up. If she continued to stay, who knew what the man would do to her!

“I’m feeling tired from the walk, why don’t we go back and take a rest? It’s been a long time since I talked to you, come to my room,” Mo Fan replied.

Xinxia’s face was so red it looked like one could squeeze some water out of it. If she rejected the suggestion, Mo Fan would simply continue with his shameless acts in the park. She would rather go to his room, at least she would not be worried about being spotted then! Xinxia was so worried that someone would stumble into them when Mo Fan was fondling her, as it would be utterly embarrassing.

A little lamb was no match against an experienced driver. Mo Fan burst out laughing on the inside when he saw Xinxia nodding softly.

On the way back, Mo Fan had the urge to give himself a slap to the face. Why hadn’t he learned the Advanced Space Spell yet? It would be so cool if he could Blink right back to his roomlated by XephiZ___
