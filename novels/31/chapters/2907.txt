Chapter 2908: Revolted Wind Element

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When the others heard her words, they stared at her. Even Wei Guang was stunned.

Mu Ningxue had not spoken much throughout the journey. Wei Guang had assumed that she was willing to leave everything to him so that he could complete his recruitment task assigned by the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance.

Nobody had thought that she would refute him in such a straightforward manner.

‘Is this how young people communicate as a team?’ Wang Shuo shook his head in resignation.

Wei Guang made all the decisions by himself without discussing things with others. Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue’s words were equivalent to telling him to get lost if he wasn’t willing to do the job he was supposed to do.

Wei Guang was a Forbidden Mage. The way Mu Ningxue talked to him did not show the slightest hint of respect. It was as if this Forbidden Mage was no different from others who had gone against her.

Wei Guang looked troubled. He was arrogant, so he naturally felt embarrassed when she put him on the spot before the crowd.

“Senior, I believe what Mu Ningxue meant was that we should work together in Extreme South Forbidden Land. We are in the same boat, and we are a team. We can’t simply leave behind team members.” Yan Lan quickly tried to ease the atmosphere.

“I’ll send someone to look for them. You have to go forward with the Ice Wheel Flying Boat. We must delay no more!” Wei Guang held his anger back.

“I want to wait for them,” said Mu Ningxue.

“As I mentioned earlier, I’ll assign someone to search for them. I’ll either bring them back alive, or carry their corpses back, will you be satisfied with that?” snapped Wei Guang.

…

A mass of twilight clouds condensed behind them. The twilight was different from usual. It was so dark as if an invisible hand gradually pressed against them from behind.

The sun shone brightly on the road ahead of them. The sunshine spread across the white glacier world. It looked holy and solemn. The sight was majestic and magnificent.

The mass of twilight clouds slowly caught up with them. Danger crept in. One could tell that Wei Guang was very particular about time.

Before departure, he had not expected the Extreme South Land to be so much worse than his expectations. As they progressed, he realized the journey was much more challenging and consumed more time than he had anticipated.

The shortcut was a crack in the glacial mountain range. The crack started from the Byzantine Mountains all the way to their destination. The glacial crack was so huge and wide that it spanned more than ten kilometers. It resembled a small plain or valley. It was the narrowest area. It was dark, deep, and gloomy like a cave.

The Ice Wheel Flying Boat would most likely get struck halfway and would not march forward. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After they entered through the crack, there was a green river. The water flowed very slowly. There were hardly any ripples on the surface.

Some of the shattered pieces floated on the river. They were curious as to why the water did not freeze. ‘Could it have a higher freezing point?’

The Ice Wheel Flying Boat sped up and soon traveled another five or six kilometers. The river was not as calm as it appeared to be. Some translucent figures gathered near the Ice Wheel Flying Boat. They moved like ghosts. Mu Ningxue and her group could not see their true form clearly as they swam under the water. However, they sensed an intense bone-chilling coldness surrounding the Ice Wheel Flying Boat.

“It’s the Phantom Demons!” Wang Shuo was shocked and shouted at others with a great sense of urgency.

Wei Guang had noticed the Phantom Demons under the water long ago. A reddish-brown fire pattern appeared between his brows. His gaze turned razor-sharp. A dark-purple Holy Flame appeared on the river.

The Holy Flame resembled a monster with an enormous mouth. It engulfed the Phantom Demons hidden under the water. The Phantom Demons were so scared that they fled. Many of them rushed out of the ice water and crashed against the surrounding ice cliffs. Most of them were destroyed by the Holy Flame and reduced to ashes.

“Trash!” Wei Guang snorted disdainfully at those creatures.

Normally, Fire Element magic power would be suppressed under such an icy environment. However, Wei Guang could melt the glacial river by casting a random spell.

The Ice Wheel Flying Boat continued to move forward and reached a narrow place inside the crack.

The sunlight shone on the ice wall that was a hundred meters above the land. The rays refracted and reflected on the ice wall opposite it. It repeatedly refracted and reflected until it rested on the river inside the cracks. The light was no longer incandescent but turned into something strange and dark green.

The air inside the dark green crack was dirty, making one struggle for breath. The icy cold wind blew from the front. The river water stirred up. The Ice Wheel Flying Boat did not move forward. Instead, it slowly moved backward.

Wei Guang’s assistants were Wind Element Mages. They tried to manipulate the direction of the wind. The moment they cast a spell, the terrifying wind struck them back and smashed them against the crack.

The crowd was shocked. ‘What sort of strange wind was that? It was so powerful that it forbade the Wind Element Mages from casting their spells!’

Even though Wei Guang was a Forbidden Mage, he could not do anything in this situation. All he could do was to recover the Mages who had been swept away by the wind.

Mu Ningxue was also a Wind Element Mage. She sensed the weirdness within the icy wind inside the crack. She closed her eyes and tried to communicate with the restless wind elements.

The Wind Element inside the crack was very strong. If they cast Wind Element magic spells under such an environment, the effect of the strength would increase by multiple folds. ‘But why did the Wind Element Mages suffer a backlash?’ Although the Wind Element was pure and strong, it was amiable.

Mu Ningxue framed a constellation inside her mental state. She tried to shape Wings of Sail for the Ice Wheel Flying Boat with the Wind Element. However, when she drew the Wind Element to her side, all of the Wind Element attacked her.

She reacted swiftly. She glided backward. When she left the deck, Mu Ningxue noticed the outline of a strong arm made up of gale in the middle of the strong icy wind. It struck the deck ruthlessly!

Everyone was stunned. They did not know what creature was attacking them. Just when they were about to fight back, the wind arm turned into a wisp of breeze and blew past the Ice Wheel Flying Boat.

“What’s going on? Did you see the thing that attacked you?” Wei Guang asked urgently.

“There are demon spirits inside the wind. They controlled the Wind Element. When the Wind Element Mages cast the spells, the demon spirits transformed the Wind Element into a violent spirit and attacked the Wind Element Mages,” explained Mu Ningxue.

The Wind Element was not neutral anymore. It had an aggressive side!

“Is that possible? Can’t we share the elements? Can someone actually cause the elements to revolt?” Li Wenbin asked in surprise.

“When you reach the Forbidden Curse level, you’ll find out that the elements cannot be shared,” said Wei Guang.
