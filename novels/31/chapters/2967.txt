Chapter 2968: Swagger

“So, the Red Demon has caused suffering for everyone. I have faith in you and your partner, Mr. Mo Fan.” Ozawa gave a solemn nod.

He also wished there was a perfect answer to the problem, rather than seeing the Twin Guardian Towers turn into an enormous grave.

“It’s dawn. Take a rest. Tonight’s our last chance.” Mo Fan glanced at the dawning light outside the towers.

When the moonless night arrived, it would be the Red Demon’s ascension time. Mo Fan could not wait until that moment to strike. Hence, the critical moment was just before the last of the crescent moon’s tip disappeared. They hoped the moon could illuminate the Red Demon’s ghostly shadow.

Ozawa did not dwell on the issue. He was aware that a great battle was about to occur. Furthermore, he had no way of knowing how many of the Twin Guardian Towers’ residents were still rational. He would fight until the very end, even if he was the only person left.

He lay on the couch with a blanket over his body. Ozawa hadn’t slept for the previous two nights. When fatigue overcame him, he dozed off.

Mo Fan also needed to recuperate. He sat on the floor. He noticed Lingling examining the data in the notebook when he turned to face her.

Lingling had the final say in the situation. She had never disappointed him. She must have learned something. Otherwise, she wouldn’t work this hard to figure out the secret.

…

They occasionally heard military boots outside the house making rhythmic marches and fast footfalls. The army appeared to be heading in their direction and could barge in at any moment.

They were taken into hiding by Ozawa. Strangely enough, despite the Patrol Mages repeatedly pacing back and forth close by, they failed to locate the dwelling. It’s possible that only individuals who were familiar with the Twin Guardian Towers’ layout would be aware of such a hiding area.

…

In the late afternoon, Mo Fan awoke. Ozawa, meanwhile, dozed off on the couch like a log. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I’m a little hungry,” said Lingling.

“We’ll go to the restaurant and eat something. I’m hungry too. As for Ozawa, let him sleep. After all, he has done his best,” said Mo Fan.

Ozawa had done them a great favor by summoning the courage to take them into the East Guardian Towers. Mo Fan and Lingling would handle the rest.

They left the house and made their way along the forest’s winding paths to the restaurant.

Despite the tragedy that occurred, it seemed unusual to see the restaurant open as normal. Numerous students ate in the restaurant. They conversed joyfully, acting as if nothing had occurred. It’s possible that they were unconcerned with the mayhem that erupted inside the West Guardian Towers or the rebellion in the East Guardian Towers. They were exempt from having to consider these matters. They only needed to do their individual tasks.

Mo Fan ordered two bowls of ramen. He split the disposable chopsticks before passing them to Lingling.

Mo Fan ate his food faster than Lingling. He added some chili powder to the ramen, took a spoonful of the soup, and then swallowed the noodles. Soon, he finished half of the bowl. Meanwhile, Lingling had eaten only a few pieces of nori and sipped some broth.

The restaurant still operated as usual. But for some reason, the number of people slowly reduced.

At a single glance, they left as usual after taking their food. However, several students ordered large meals, and they left suddenly after only having a few bites.

Mo Fan looked at his watch. It was peak hour for lunch. The restaurant was left with very few people. The students did not enter the restaurant again.

After five minutes, Tegami Fujikata, Chihaya Mochizuki, Shao Watani, and the rest of the group walked into the restaurant. Behind them were the students from the State House. They were here for a meal after finishing the classes.

“Mr. Mo Fan, Ms. Lingling!” Nagayama was the first to discover them.

“Weren’t they on the wanted list yesterday?” Shao Watani asked in confusion.

He approached Lingling and Mo Fan. The others did likewise.

“You two, why did you spend last night within the East Guardian Towers? There are no-go zones in the East Guardian Towers. If anyone enters the towers without authorization, even those who serve there, they will be charged. Despite knowing this, why did you still violate the law? You’re making life challenging for us.” Shao Watani sat down. He did not treat Mo Fan and Lingling as if they were wanted criminals.

At that moment, Tegami Fujikata walked into the restaurant. She stared at Mo Fan. Mo Fan looked up. He gave her a chilly look and went back to his ramen.

He had to fill up his stomach so that he had the energy to fight with the impersonators.

“It’s a long story. I suppose everyone is starving. Sit down. Let’s talk slowly,” said Mo Fan to the crowd.

The communal table in the restaurant was large enough to accommodate everyone.

“Let us listen to what Mo Fan has to say. Perhaps, he has his own reasons.” Chihaya Mochizuki suggested everyone to sit down.

Tegami Fujikata nodded. She wondered what kind of tricks Mo Fan was going to pull.

…

The rest did not order their meals. Outside the restaurant, they could hear loud footsteps. Additionally, they picked up a tiny vibration created by the military boots on the stone steps. Although the short fence had blocked the view, Mo Fan and Lingling were aware that the army had surrounded the restaurant.

“The army is outside the restaurant. Mr. Mo Fan, Ms. Lingling, please give us a reasonable explanation,” Tegami Fujikata said with a straight face. She looked fearless.

She was not afraid of Mo Fan and Lingling exposing their lies. After all, the Twin Guardian Towers were under their control. Even if a minority of people heard Mo Fan’s theory, they would not believe him.

Mo Fan was aware of Tegami Fujikata’s intentions. But he was not in a hurry. He finished eating his noodles first. Lingling was hungry, so she slowly finished her food.

“It’s true that we barged into the East Guardian Towers last night. What we saw inside the towers opened our eyes. You don’t have to believe my words. You can just go in and see it for yourself. You will then realize you are actually living in a terrifying reality,” said Mo Fan to the crowd.

Tegami Fujikata and Ikuko Ishida were certainly the Blood Demons. But Mo Fan was unsure about the identities of Chihaya Mochizuki, Sinchino Mochizuki, Nagayama, Kaede Takahashi, Shao Watani, and the rest of the group.

It was a little complicated inside the Twin Guardian Towers. The Evil Gang, in addition to those in positions of authority who had been supplanted by the Blood Demons, was there to brainwash the populace. The mob would misidentify the inmates in the East Guardian Towers as the actual monsters and demons even if they were visible to them.

“Rules are rules. We don’t simply break the rules. We hope you haven’t caused anything bad. I hope the Chief will be merciful to you,” said Ikuko Ishida.

Mo Fan chuckled. “I can’t be stopped by any of you! “To put it arrogantly, none of you can stop me. It’s up to me to decide whether or not I wish to extend you my mercy rather than you doing so!”
