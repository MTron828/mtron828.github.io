“Time to go!” Yassen clearly had enough of a reputation among the experts from all across the world that the others were willing to follow his commands.

The lake was shrouded by a red mist. There were not many dead bodies, as such had been brought away to the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nest to be stored as food.

The Hunter Group under Yassen’s lead was leading the way. Its members were very strong. Even though they had not used any Super Spells, it was obvious there were Super Mages among them, judging from their control over their magic.

It was obvious why the top organizations’ members were following Yassen’s lead. The strength of his Hunter Group said it all. They were calm and collected despite facing the powerful Frosty Ancient Eagles that were coming down from the sky. Their ability to utilize their Elements and their teamwork were impressive!

“Charge!”

“Dying on Tianshan Mountain is better than dying on a sickbed, charge!”

“There’s no place we can’t conquer. Tianshan Mountain is no exception!”

There were four other mercenary groups, in addition to the Mailong Private Military Group. Their numbers were greater than the Mailong Private Military Group. They seemed to be a lot luckier too, as they had not lost many members along the way.

Both mercenaries and Hunters had joined hands temporarily to tackle the Valley of Glaciers. The teams pushed forward after Yassen and his group cleared a path. They operated like a team of elites on a mission.

The Wind Mages built a wind raft and sped up the Hunters and mercenaries, allowing those who did not have reliable spells to boost their speed to stay up with the others.

The Mailong Private Military Group was moving with them. Its members were mostly on the left wing, responsible for covering fire.

“Follow the markings of my Brilliant Light!” Lu Xiu called out.

Lu Xiu was the third Super Mage of the Mailong Private Military Group. He had only become a Super Mage a year ago, yet he was a lot stronger than the unreliable Gavin had been.

His main Element was Light, and his Brilliant Light was quite special. When he used it on the Frosty Ancient Eagles, the strength they glowed at corresponded to the strength of the demon creatures.

The battle was expected to be chaotic. It was important to focus their spells on the stronger demon creatures and kill them first, or these creatures could easily break the teams’ formation. Lu Xiu’s Brilliant Light was able to tag the Great Commander-level Frosty Ancient Eagles. Those creatures could easily kill a lot of their members instantly if they broke through their formation.

A Great Commander-level Frosty Ancient Eagle dove at the group after being hit by the Light Spell. Its icy aura could inflict unimaginable destruction along the ground when it was plunging like a meteorite. It took the destructive Mages of the Mailong Private Military Group three rounds of spells to finally kill the Great Commander-level creature when it reached around thirty meters from the ground. Everyone was relieved when they saw the creature was dead.

“Don’t lower your guard. Petrify the enemies that are tagged by the Brilliant Light!” Lu Xiu ordered.

Their Earth Mages were closer to the center of the formation. They soon noticed more than ten Frosty Ancient Eagles were approaching from a lower altitude!

These Frosty Ancient Eagles had been hiding in the blood mist. Nobody noticed them when they first ran toward the lake. Luckily, Lu Xiu’s Brilliant Light had tagged them in time. Otherwise, their sharp wings could have easily sliced the people of the Mailong Private Military Group in half!

“Eyes of the Rock Demon: Petrify!”

Seven Earth Mages fixed their eyes on the Frosty Ancient Eagles. Their pupils turned brown and with an eerie gray flicker of light, the energy of the Petrify spells spread like a fan toward the Frosty Ancient Eagles!

The Frosty Ancient Eagles were very alert. They quickly beat their wings and flew higher into the sky when they noticed the Earth Magic.

The Petrify spells obviously had their limits. Lu Xiu frowned when he realized the Frosty Ancient Eagles were only probing them. He cursed in a different language.

A voice appeared behind Lu Xiu as the Frosty Ancient Eagles were about to leave the range of the Petrify spells. “Eyes of the Rock Demon: Area of Gravity!”

Lu Xiu turned around and saw the young man who had killed Gavin. His eyes had turned golden-brown. A strong Earth Magic loomed over the area like an invisible mountain.

The Frosty Ancient Eagles had just risen into the sky and were picking up their pace, but when the Area of Gravity was established, they struggled to beat their wings properly.

The Frosty Ancient Eagles were not crushed by the gravitational force, but it still held them back. The energy of the Petrify spells swept across their bodies and hardened them. They suddenly stopped moving in midair.

A moment later, the Frosty Ancient Eagles that had turned into stone fell heavily onto the lake and were smashed into pieces!

“Not bad, but you shouldn’t intervene with other teams’ matters without my permission,” Lu Xiu told Mo Fan.

“That’s not going to hold me back,” Mo Fan replied indifferently.

It was Mo Fan’s first time using the Advanced Spell of the Earth Element in a practical situation. The Eyes of the Rock Demon was able to greatly increase an Earth Mage’s control over their Earth Magic. Mo Fan had learned the Area of Gravity a long time ago. He could suppress the Frosty Ancient Eagles up to around a hundred and fifty meters from the ground with the Eyes of the Rock Demon. It gave Mo Fan an effective way to fight flying creatures.

He could also use it together with the Space Element and the Chaos Element. Even a Ruler-level creature would struggle to move freely under the pressure of his magic!

“A Ruler-level creature!” someone at the front suddenly yelled. It sounded like one of the experts in Yassen’s group.

The Frosty Ancient Eagles were at the top of the food chain in the Valley of Glaciers. The Tianshan Demon Tigers and the Frosty Ancient Eagles were the symbolic species of Tianshan Mountain. There were obviously Ruler-level creatures among them since Commander-level creatures were so common here!

Mo Fan looked up, trying to find the Ruler-level Frosty Ancient Eagle. However, he only saw the bright sun. There was no Ruler-level Frosty Ancient Eagle in his view.
