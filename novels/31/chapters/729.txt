“Come here you little...” Mo Fan fixed his eyes on the three-meter-tall Scarlet Soaring Demon. His pupils were emitting an eerie silver light.

Using the Space Element required great concentration, as drawing the Star Orbit was not the only requirement to cast the Spell. Most importantly, he needed to lock onto his target and manipulate space with his will to achieve his goal!

It was an extremely complicated process that required lots of practice. Therefore, for some time, Mo Fan had tried using Telekinesis to flip some girls’ skirts up. It might sound easy since a little breeze was enough to do the job, but to use the invisible claw and lift the skirt up to a height that only he could see required a certain level of skill!

Mo Fan was currently using Telekinesis: Invisible Claw. It was highly focused on quickness, accuracy, and the strength of the grip!

Mo Fan had no problem with accuracy, but it was obvious that the strength of the grip was nowhere near enough.

As Mo Fan thought, when he cast the Telekinesis: Invisible Claw, the three-meter-tall Scarlet Soaring Demon that was sprinting simply shuddered. It continued to run as if it was hardly affected by the Spell, despite the confused look on its face as it wondered if it had just run into some invisible spider web.

“Bro, it’s not working?” Zhao Manyan had a strange look.

“I can only grab around fifty kilograms now. The three-meter-tall Scarlet Soaring Demon is at least two hundred kilograms. On top of that, it was running at such an incredible speed. It’s too hard for me to drag it back here!” Mo Fan smiled awkwardly.

“Then why did you even bother trying? The Scarlet Soaring Demons are running away!” said Zhao Manyan in displeasure.

“Wasn’t I just practicing diligently? Forget it, I’ll just go and catch those Sea Monkeys, I was pretty good at grabbing them!” said Mo Fan.

“Say, aren’t those Scarlet Soaring Demons heading toward your big wife? Are you sure you have time to fool around with the Sea Monkey Monsters?” said Zhao Manyan.

“Say, why are you still talking nonsense here, hurry up and follow me, we’re going to kill them all!”

Zhao Manyan had finally witnessed Mo Fan’s Space Element. He was unsure if he should be laughing or crying.

That being said, Zhao Manyan knew that the Space Element was one of the hardest Elements to master. In addition to that, it was an Element that could only be Awakened in the Advanced Level, which basically implied that the Magician could only Awaken it and practice it with a certain level of mental strength.

If Mo Fan was willing to spend a great amount of effort on mastering the Space Element, even Basic Telekinesis could be used in countless ways!

“It’s so cold!”

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan proceeded to regroup with the team. However, they soon realized the meaning of freezing a place three feet deep!

{TL Note: Freezing a place three feet deep is taken from a proverb. The actual version is, a single day’s frost is not enough to freeze a place three feet deep. It has the same meaning as the idiom ‘Rome was not built in a day’.}

The whole place was covered in ice. Large snowflakes were drifting in the sky. The water between the islands was completely frozen over. The waves on the surface of the ocean had frozen in place, too. It simply looked as if time was frozen, but would resume in the next second.

A wild roar came from the direction of the nest. A scarlet gust of wind swept forward and shattered everything that was frozen into pieces!

Mo Fan glanced in the direction and frowned.

The aura of the Scarlet Soaring Demon was rather formidable. It was clearly not a mere Warrior-level creature!

“There’s a Commander-level creature here, it’s the Scarlet Rending Demon!” someone screamed from not far away.

The situation had escalated into a messy fight. Lots of Scarlet Soaring Demons were spotted on the island of ice. Nanyu was the one who discovered the Commander-level creature, since she was the closest to the nest.

“Nanyu is in danger!” Zhao Manyan ran toward the scream.

Unfortunately, he had already used his magic boots. His running speed was too slow.

Mo Fan headed toward the scream, too. His speed was a lot quicker. He cast Fleeing Shadow a few times when no one was looking. It was more important to save the girl!

The scarlet gust of wind approached rapidly. Nanyu was being kept busy by three Scarlet Soaring Demons over four meters tall. When she saw the fierce gust of wind, she decisively summoned her Shield Equipment to protect her from the Scarlet Rending Demon’s attack!

Nanyu’s Shield of Lustrous Wood stood firmly in front of her, but the Scarlet Rending Demon rammed into the shield without hesitation.

The Shield of Lustrous Wood was instantly shattered into pieces. The collision knocked Nanyu flying.

Nanyu remained calm as she was knocked into the air, landing nimbly on the ice. Her semi-long hair was a little disheveled.

There was a woosh of motion, and Nanyu saw a man appear beside her: it was Ai Jiangtu!

“Are you alright?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“I’m fine, can you handle this creature?” asked Nanyu.

“I’ll try,” said Ai Jiangtu.

Nanyu did not push herself. She immediately backed off to the side. However, the Scarlet Soaring Demons had no intention of letting her go, and immediately surrounded her. There were around eight of them, each taller than four meters!

Luckily, Mo Fan came to the rescue in time. He demanded the attention of the creatures with his wild lightning and fierce flames. Each of his Spells was too deadly to ignore!

“Zhao Manyan, cast your defensive Spells on me!” Ai Jiangtu immediately called Zhao Manyan over when he arrived.

“Are you trying to take on the Scarlet Rending Demon?” Zhao Manyan was slightly hesitant. The Commander-level creature would easily break his Intermediate Spells. The Shield of Lustrous Wood that Nanyu was using was considered powerful for Intermediate Magic Equipment, yet it was shattered into pieces by the Scarlet Rending Demon with a single attack!

Ai Jiangtu did not respond. He gathered his focus and used his mental energy to control the giant frozen boulder in front of him.

The boulder was lifted off the ground. The snow covering it fell off as it hovered above the ground.

As a silver glow burst out from Jiangtu’s pupils, the hovering boulder immediately flew at the Scarlet Rending Demon at incredible speed!

The Scarlet Rending Demon did not dodge. It cut with its sharp claws, and swiftly slashed the boulder into pieces!

The Scarlet Rending Demon dashed forward and leapt into the air. It extended its muscular limbs in the air before driving out its arms with great force, aiming its claws at Ai Jiangtu’s head!

Its speed was incredible. It simply turned into a scarlet blur which briefly appeared in the air before it immediately landed on the ground. Its terrifying claws produced a ten-meters-long afterglow that could rend everything they came into contact with.

Ai Jiangtu did not dodge preemptively. The moment the Scarlet Rending Demon landed on the ground, the space he was standing on became blurry. In the next second, he had vanished from the spot and relocated himself onto an ice boulder fifty meters away!Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
