Black lice were falling off the Crimson Scorpion Louse King’s body like dead skin. More of them fell out of its mouth whenever it was opened. Mo Fan’s scalp tingled when he saw the lice.

The waves of lice kept knocking Mo Fan into the air. He could not afford to fight the Crimson Scorpion Louse King directly.

He had to admit that the combination of the thirty percent reduction of his strength and the fifty percent increase to the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s strength after she killed the European had made the battle extremely difficult.

He had to avoid the territory she’d taken over. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan moved toward the edge of the tile. The barren land that had previously been covered in rocks and sand had turned into a nest of lice.

Mo Fan frowned when he noticed the space getting smaller.

How did the Crimson Scorpion Medusa store so many lice in her hair? If the lice were able to multiply endlessly through fragmentation, wouldn’t the Crimson Scorpion Medusa be carrying an army with her?

Mo Fan tried to recall the battle in Bejiang. There was a Crimson Scorpion Medusa in the battle between the armies of Undead there, but Mo Fan had never seen it use such a powerful ability.

Mo Fan used his Will to form a defensive wall, but the Crimson Scorpion Louse King simply broke through it with brute force.

The Ardent Sunset was supposed to be effective against swarming insects, too, but it was not proving that useful against the lice.

Is the Crimson Scorpion Medusa really this powerful?

Mo Fan was forced to the edge of the tile. The army of lice was everywhere. Mo Fan could not even see his surroundings.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa stood above the waves of lice, like she was surfing on them. Her eyes were constantly fixed on Mo Fan, as if she was keen to see Mo Fan being smashed into mincemeat by the Crimson Scorpion Louse King.

“That monster, she could have stayed behind the lice in safety… Her eyes, that’s right, she’s a Medusa!” Mo Fan felt an urge to hit himself on the head.

Apas was worried sick in the Contracted Space.

Mo Fan was pretty smart most of the time. How could he screw up in a situation like this?

He was going up against a Medusa!

Wasn’t a Medusa’s eyes their strongest ability? Not only were they able to petrify their enemy, they were also good at tricking their enemies with illusions!

The Lord of Darkness had forbidden Apas from taking part in the battle. He had also blocked the connection between her and Mo Fan, thus she was unable to warn him of this.

Luckily, Mo Fan had realized the truth before it was too late!

The Crimson Scorpion Louse King and the fireproof lice that were multiplying endlessly… They were only part of the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s illusion!

Her eyes had never left Mo Fan.

She was indeed releasing black lice from her hair, but their numbers were nowhere close to what Mo Fan was seeing.

The Crimson Scorpion Louse King was only scary when Mo Fan was being tricked by the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s eyes.

The Crimson Scorpion Medusa was targeting Mo Fan’s mind while sending out her lice. She was going to break down Mo Fan’s mind and then take him out with the lice.

Mo Fan eventually calmed down.

He had already strengthened his Will after fighting several Medusae in the past. He did not have trouble waking himself up from the illusion. He just had to find its weak point!

Mo Fan stopped moving backward.

The Ardent Sunset was spiraling under his feet, but the lice quickly lunged at the flames to put them out.

However, Mo Fan did not stop gathering the flames this time. After all, it was just an illusion!

The Ardent Sunset was not put out. The enemy had only been stamping out the will to fight in his heart.

Mo Fan kept releasing the flames. The furnace burning in his body was receiving endless fuel, filling the area with scorching flames.

The Ardent Sunset grew rapidly and swiftly burned the black lice to ashes.

It was like a little spark carried by a gust of wind to a dry paddy field. The whole field would be consumed by fire, as long as the wind did not put out the embers!

The Medusa’s eyes were the strong wind that had made Mo Fan believe his fire could not ignite the paddy field!

The Ardent Sunset was naturally still effective after Mo Fan broke free from the illusion. The flames were spreading even?quicker than he thought. They had already reached the Crimson Scorpion Louse King.

The hill-sized Crimson Scorpion Louse King was set aflame. It burned into ashes before it even had a chance to attack Mo Fan.

The fire was unstoppable, the lice had now become its fuel. The Ardent Sunset soon spread to the Crimson Scorpion Medusa.

Not only did the Crimson Scorpion Medusa’s plan fail, it had even provided Mo Fan with a perfect environment!

The stronger the fire was, the stronger Mo Fan was in his King of Hell form. On top of that, Mo Fan was basically unkillable in the fire because of the Phoenix Flame. His wounds had healed in mere seconds.

He was grateful to the Crimson Scorpion Medusa for providing his flames with the cleanest fuel. Otherwise, he would not have been able to recover from his injuries!

Not only did he recover his strength, the fire had made him stronger! On the other hand, the Crimson Scorpion Medusa was now fleeing for her life. She was searching for a spot where the fire was weaker, but Mo Fan had already caught up to her.

“There’s no way you can beat me!” The Crimson Scorpion Medusa lunged at Mo Fan after she realized she had nowhere to go.

She had turned herself into a stinger. It was the deadliest attack that she would only use as a last resort. The stinger hidden between her stomach and tail was actually part of her organs!

Mo Fan was fearless. He dove at his enemy like a blazing sun and burned everything into ashes!

Whoosh!

The stinger went right through Mo Fan’s chest.

At the same time, blazing lava burst out of Mo Fan’s chest and sprayed over the Crimson Scorpion Medusa.

“Ahhhhh!” the Crimson Scorpion Medusa screamed in agony as the lava covered her. Her scales, body, blood, and organs were melting rapidly in the merciless flames.

The King of Hell’s flames were incredibly powerful. Even the Crimson Scorpion Medusa could not survive them!

Su Lu burst out laughing. “HAHAHA, well done, she has taken him down with her! It’s a satisfactory outcome!”

It was a pity that he could not kill Mo Fan himself, but he was pleased to see Mo Fan was dead.

He would not be here in the first place if Mo Fan had not ruined his plans. Su Lu wanted Mo Fan to die the most!

Mo Fan’s fire had burned the Crimson Scorpion Medusa to death, but the Crimson Scorpion Medusa had also stabbed Mo Fan through the chest with her deadliest move!
