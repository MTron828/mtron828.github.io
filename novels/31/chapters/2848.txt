Chapter 2850: Terrifying Serpent Demon

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everything felt eerie. It was almost as if the prey assumed that it had outrun the predator, but the predator was still sneakily observing the prey. When the prey let its guard down in relief, then the predator would lunge.

Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, Jiang Shaoxu, Song Feiyao, and Bai Mei were the preys, and the hunter was the Ocean Serpent Demon between the two buildings.

The Ocean Serpent Demon was lazy, quiet and in no hurry. It patrolled its territory with patience. Little movements didn’t escape its sight. It had discovered the five sneaky humans long ago.

It was different from the other unruly and testy sea beasts that roared and attacked the moment they saw a human.

It silently stared at the five people who thought they were smart enough to avoid its sight by weaving through the buildings below.

The group of stupid, narrow-minded humans seemed to have forgotten that noble beings did not require eyes to keep track of their surroundings.

The deep-sea cold pond scales on the Ocean Serpent Demon were sensitive to all temperature changes in its surroundings. When it opened its eyes, it could see the slow process of those flying insects flapping their wings. When it closed its eyes, it could visualize the five-kilometer radius around it as a temperature map.

The temperature of humans was too easy to identify, so these five humans fell into its trap from the start. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Boom!

As the building collapsed, glass shattered all over the floor. Some desks and chairs slid out of the broken wall in piles and fell on the street.

On the messy street, a golden diamond shield appeared around Zhao Manyan. Jiang Shaoxu and Mr. Bai Mei were within the shield as well.

The head of the Ocean Serpent Demon was still hanging above the high-rise building. Part of its body wrapped around the fallen golden brown office building, and the other part filled the wide street. Its weight cracked the asphalt road.

The golden diamond shield was Zhao Manyan’s trump card. However, his defense could only last a few minutes when facing such a terrifying ruler-level demon.

Mu Bai was in the smashed shop at the end of the street, his chest was covered in blood.

He struggled to push himself off the floor. As his body swayed, his legs and limbs trembled violently.

The trembling was not because of fear, but because of the fierce attack by the Ocean Serpent Demon. Some of his bones were already broken.

The Ocean Serpent Demon was still looking in their direction from its position above them. It looked away from Zhao Manyan’s golden diamond shield and looked at Mu Bai, who was still alive, with interest.

“Mu Bai, let’s run in different directions. We can’t all die here!” Zhao Manyan shouted urgently.

Mu Bai turned his palms. Many silkworms appeared on it. They burrowed into Mu Bai’s skin and bones and repaired his broken body.

Mu Bai could finally stand on steady feet. His limbs stopped trembling.

The ice pen and snow inkstone had rolled down into the sewer. Mu Bai wanted to summon them, but a long tail stood between Mu Bai and his magical equipment.

The ice pen and snow inkstone could not return because of its terrifying aura. Mu Bai’s ice magic would be severely affected if he did not have these two powerful magical equipment.

“You guys run. I’ll deal with it.” Mu Bai wiped off his blood.

Song Feiyao was unconscious at a distance from Mu Bai. She was the second person the Ocean Serpent Demon had attacked. She had avoided it just in time with her magic shield, but the powerful attack had sent her flying. It would take time for her to regain her consciousness.

“Are you crazy? How can you fight it alone?” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“Nothing is impossible.” Mu Bai breathed heavily.

Some strange bee holes appeared all over his body. Those bizarre Star Bugs that once appeared in the Helan Mountain Bug Valley flew out one after another and quickly formed a cloud of bugs.

These bizarre Star Bugs could absorb the power of the soul. It could weaken the powerful creature’s magic.

Mu Bai had deliberately brought some worm eggs and cultivated them in the last few days. Unfortunately, he hadn’t had enough time to cultivate more of them. If Mu Bai had a month, he could double the number of the Star Bugs. It allowed him to achieve the terrifying suppressing and weakening ability of the Bug Valley.

The bizarre Star Bugs flew. They were small, but they had a strange power of evasion. Soon, these Star Bugs were attached to the tail and body of the Ocean Serpent Demon, and their wings lit up.

The Ocean Serpent Demon tried to drive them away but failed. However, the Ocean Serpent Demon did not panic. It even found Mu Bai’s trick very funny.

After all, these Star Bugs were useless if it killed Mu Bai. The Star Bugs feed at a very slow speed. Before they could feed on it enough to weaken its power, the Ocean Serpent Demon would already have killed Mu Bai and the others.

The eyes of the Ocean Serpent Demon revealed its murderous intent. It found the humans boring and wanted to kill them all.

…

In mid-air, a winged shadow passed by very quickly.

The Ocean Serpent Demon shifted its attention to the shadow, and the scales on its whole body shrank. Its aura suddenly became frightening.

The Ocean Serpent Demon lost its cool and became angry and sensitive.

The winged man was Shaoli, who was instructed to look for the person who possessed fusion magic. He happened to pass by and saw the Ocean Serpent Demon attacking the humans.

Eagle-winged Shaoli was helpless. He had a matter of utmost importance to attend to. If he fought the Ocean Serpent Demon, he would be greatly delayed.

He had to make a choice, no matter how cruel it was. He felt sorry for the young Mages on the street.

Eagle-winged Shaoli glanced at the golden diamond shield that surrounded and protected the Mages. In the end, he chose to leave them. He swallowed the helplessness and humiliation he felt.

However, something caught his eyes and stopped him. He flew down avoiding the Ocean Serpent Demon’s attacks.

“Shaoxu, what’re you doing here?” Eagle-winged Shaoli landed in front of Zhao Manyan.

Jiang Shaoxu was stunned.

“Shaoli.” Jiang Shaoxu was so happy that she almost cried.

She had not expected to meet her cousin, Jiang Shaoli here.

“D*rn it!” Eagle-winged Shaoli was about to scold her, but the Ocean Serpent Demon was venting all its killing intent on him.

Eagle-winged Shaoli had not wanted to get involved in this fight.

This place was very close to The Bund and had many powerful Godly Hordes, which surrounded the Demon Lord. It was not a place common people would approach. Jiang Shaoli wondered why Shaoxu was here.
