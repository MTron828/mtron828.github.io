“Everyone is here.” The advisor with tiger stripes slowly walked forward and glanced at the thirteen people in the line.

The team had thirteen candidates: ten official candidates and three substitutes; Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Ningxue.

“Actually, we should have departed earlier. It wasn’t necessary to wait for a mere substitute,” said Gong Yu indifferently, yet it was obvious that he was referring to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan smiled without refuting it. They would be going on a long training trip as a team. The training was said to last more than a year. Didn’t that simply mean he has plenty of time to deal with this little shit named Gong Yu?

“I strongly advise that no one make any noise once I start to speak!” snapped the advisor.

Gong Yu immediately shut his mouth.

“Your final goal is to compete with the national teams from other countries at the City of Canals, Venice, during what is known as the World College Tournament. The training isn’t just so you can get enough real combat experience and knowledge to prepare yourself for the tournament. You will also need to secure the entry ticket for the World College Tournament. There are almost two hundred countries participating in the World College Tournament, but not every country is qualified to appear on the dueling grounds in the City of Canals...” said Feng Li in a firm tone.

The five advisors took turns to give their advice. Everyone listened to their words very seriously.

There was no grand ceremony to send off the team on their trip. The truth was, no one knew when the team was departing for the training, nor would they know the list of students who were on the team. The candidates would only show themselves in public during the opening ceremony of the World College Tournament at Venice!

——

The sky was blue and clear, the water was flowing freely...

Tides of white waves splashed on the successive coast reefs. It felt like the waves were teasing the rocks softly, instead of hitting them with great force.

Beside the jagged rocks was a little beach where a few fairly aged fisherman boats were floating.

The boats were extremely important to the fishing village nearby. The few families in the village relied on the boats to feed themselves. The waves would misbehave at times, hence they had to tie the boats down firmly, with lots of ropes!

“F**k, f**k, f**k!” an inharmonious voice echoed between the peaceful village and the beach.

“Mo Fan, calm down!” said Zhao Manyan.

“As the national team, they didn’t give us a single cent as the allowance, no private jet, no private coach, no hotel, they even froze our bank accounts. On top of that, they even forbade us from riding planes. What the heck! We’re meant to travel to Japan, are they seriously asking us to swim there?” Mo Fan yelled at the sky and the sea like a grumbling bitter woman!

Didn’t they promise him that food, accommodation, and entertainment would be provided? What about going on a vacation across different countries, enjoying delicacies and picking up chicks?

What did they mean by they are on their own!

They initially thought a luxurious cruise would be picking them up when they were brought to this remote fishing village. They would soon be dancing and drinking on the cruise on their way to Japan. However, after waiting for a day, the only boats by the shore were the wooden fishing boats!

Trying to cross the Pacific Ocean with a wooden boat, are you f**king kidding me!

They didn’t even have oars to row the boat!

“How typical for mediocre people to complain,” the woman with the beauty spot giggled. She was acting like she was above the common populace.

“Alright, Miss Jiang Shaoxu, can you please teach me how we’re going to Japan!” said Mo Fan.

“It’s obviously a test! We’re prohibited from taking a plane, nor are we allowed to take any transport that would require us to reveal our identity. But, we are Magicians, we should be able to find a way when we’re left here in a fishing village...”

“So, how do we go to Japan?” asked Mo Fan.

“A ship, if there’s a fishing village, there must be a port nearby. If there’s a port, there might be a ship heading to Japan. If I’m not mistaken, this part of the country is one of the common stops for ships that sail for Japan...” said Jiang Shaoxu smiled.

The woman really liked to smile. Each of her actions would display her charming personality of being friendly to everyone, yet her voice was filled with a hint of disdain.

Whenever she spoke, it was like she was referring to the others as mere commoners...

“Jiang Shaoxu is right, there should be a port nearby. Either way, we should try and get a map to pinpoint our location,” said Nanyu.

“Oh God, we don’t even have a map?” Mo Fan was on the verge of losing himself.

“There’s nothing we could do, the advisors have set us all up. They told us to leave everything behind, including our mobile phones. They told us that they are sending us to some special training, yet the helicopter brought us to this shitty place instead. No food, no clean clothes, no mobile phones, no computers, not even our identity cards!” said Zhao Manyan with a wry smile.

All their identities had been frozen. Most modern transportation in the country now required identification. They were basically the same as illegal immigrants. They had to avoid the police too, since if they were caught, the police would summon the people responsible for the national team to free them. However, it would also imply that they had failed the training.

Failure would mean serious consequences to the candidates, as they were not the only ones chosen for the national team. There were other backup teams. If their team failed the training, the people in the backup teams would replace them.

In other words, there were plenty of substitutes for the national team!

The only place they could reveal their identity was the Chinese ambassador in Japan... it was their first destination.

This explained why Mo Fan was screaming furiously to vent his grudge. This was no training, this was the path of cultivation for a monk. It was nowhere close to the adventure that he had expected!

“By the way, even if we found a ship heading to Japan, doesn’t that mean we’ll have to smuggle ourselves in?” said Gong Yu. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah, so we better not get caught. If we got busted, we’ll have to reveal our identities, which means failing the training. Some of us are going to get replaced... and normally they would start from the substitutes,” Jiang Shaoxu looked at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan cheerfully. Of course, she did not forget to glance at Mu Ningxue, too.

“Enough with the nonsense, let’s head over to the fishing village to collect some information,” said Ai Jiangtu.

Ai Jiangtu was appointed the team’s captain by the advisors, hence everyone was obliged to listen to him.

The group immediately stopped talking when Ai Jiangtu gave the order. They immediately headed to the fishing village.

This training did catch Mo Fan by surprise, as he was totally unprepared for it. However, they were all Magicians, they should not have any problem finding a way.

Speaking of which, no one had even a single cent on them. Even finding their next meal was a problem, let alone sneaking into Japan...
