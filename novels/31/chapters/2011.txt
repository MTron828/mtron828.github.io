Everyone had their eyes open wide. Their hearts froze when they imagined themselves in the same shoes as the men who had fallen victim to the eagles!

Mo Fan looked around and caught a glimpse of a female Frosty Ancient Eagle flapping its wings and hovering in front of a small crack.

It was a tunnel leading down out of sight. The eagle kept crying out softly, like a mother calling her kids in from the balcony now that it was time for dinner.

As he wondered, a small eagle still growing its feathers flew out of the crack. There was some strange fur attached to it. He could not tell which creature it belonged to.

It flew over to the back of the female eagle and sat down there.

The female eagle dug out some frozen meat and flew out of the cave. They were obviously going to enjoy their meal together as a family.

Why was there a little eagle inside the crack? Mo Fan was confused.

——

The Frosty Ancient Eagles finally left the cave half an hour later, done shopping for dinner.

The Frosty Ancient Eagles enjoyed staying at high altitudes and enjoyed the blue sky too, so the food storage was not guarded at all times. Not many species in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain would dare to steal their food!

“We almost died!”

“I feel sorry for Hayes. They dragged him away like that...”

Many people had already regretted intruding on the sacred mountain, but they had no choice but to keep going now.

“We should be safe for now. We’ll leave when they are asleep,” Yassen said solemnly.

The alliance tried to rest even though they were all on edge. It was not like they could go anywhere.

Mo Fan was very concerned about the tunnel the little eagle came from. He stepped closer to it.

“What’s wrong?” Mu Ningxue asked when she saw Mo Fan acting suspiciously.

“I’m thinking of taking a look down there,” Mo Fan answered.

“It’s so dark. Will it be dangerous?” Mu Ningxue was worried.

“It’s fine. I’m a Shadow Mage. Why would I be afraid of the dark? It’s actually my best camouflage,” Mo Fan reassured her.

“Be careful...” Mu Ningxue said.

The tunnel was narrow and Mu Ningxue could not use Fleeing Shadow. She could not follow Mo Fan down, even if she wanted to.

Unfortunately, there had been some problem when forging the Reefgold Magic Armor. Otherwise, Mu Ningxue would not have worried so much about Mo Fan’s safety.

Mu Ningxue had long wanted to gift Mo Fan some nice magic Armor, but Mo Fan’s cultivation had improved too quickly. Most of his enemies were either Ruler-level creatures or Super Mages now, so ordinary armor was useless for him.

He had been using the Black Snake Armor for a long time. Its defenses and resistances might not be useful for Mo Fan in the fights of his current level, but its other attributes were unmatched, such as its ability to resist all kinds of poison.

“Apas, come with me.”

Mo Fan drew Apas into his Contracted Space without waiting for her consent. He then turned into a black shadow and flowed down the tunnel, which was only big enough to fit an eagle fledgling.

Certain parts of the tunnel were too narrow for an adult. The Frosty Ancient Eagles obviously could not fit in the tunnel, either. It was strange that a tunnel like it existed in the food storage area.

The tunnel was quite long, and it took Mo Fan some time before he reached an opening.

It looked like an ice cellar. A ray of sunlight had been reflected countless times by the ice, serving as the only source of light in the cellar.

The cellar had a high ceiling. Mo Fan could see tiny figures flying around, all of them screeching in joy.

Mo Fan took a closer look and realized they were all fledglings that had yet to grow their feathers. Even though they were flying around, they were staggering like kids that had only learned to walk.

Their size was smaller than the one that had been brought home for a meal. Some were so chubby that they could merely stand on tiptoe despite beating their wings with all their might. It looked somewhat hilarious.

“I think we’ve found their kindergarten,” Mo Fan murmured.

“These naughty and gluttonous younglings must have dug the tunnel,” Apas observed.

“Apas, look down there; are those eagle eggs?” Mo Fan looked deeper and saw a thin layer of ice.

“They are!” Apas exclaimed with glittering eyes.

Mo Fan was overjoyed.

Luckily, he had been observant enough to notice the fledgling that had been called out for a meal.

The ceiling of the ice cellar was partially exposed to sunlight. There must be an area that was connected to the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nest. Some powerful male eagles were probably guarding the real entrance. The adult Frosty Ancient Eagles did not expect anyone to break into their kitchen and sneak into the place where they kept their eggs through a tunnel that had been dug out by the kids.

Unlike the hatched fledglings, the rest of the eggs were placed in an orderly manner inside a hole filled with dirty water, then sealed with a thin layer of ice. The eggs were like pebbles at the bottom of a frozen lake.

Nanyu mentioned the place where the eggs of the Frosty Ancient Eagles were stored would be dark and icy. Only the top of the cellar was exposed to sunlight. The pond where the eggs were stored was quite far away from it.

“Strange, there’s an unusual presence here,” Apas noticed.

“You shouldn’t invade their mothers’ privacy. We should hurry. Let’s see if the thing we are looking for is here. The adult Frosty Ancient Eagles are most likely going to check on their younglings when it’s time to vaccinate them or feed them medicine!” Mo Fan was still surprised by his unexpected discovery.

Apas suddenly noticed something as they approached the pond. She blurted out, “Did you see something shiny over there, something like a stone?”

Mo Fan followed the direction Apas was pointing to and saw a stone moving around at a fast pace.

The shiny stone seemed to have noticed Mo Fan and Apas’ existence. It suddenly jumped toward them, giving Mo Fan a huge fright.

Mo Fan finally saw what it was when it was they were close enough.

The stone was not moving on its own, a little creature was holding it with its mouth. They could not see it at first due to the lack of light!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
