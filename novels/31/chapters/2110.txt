The rocks kept getting hotter. The water on the reefs evaporated in seconds, white steam rising into the air. Even the seawater within a certain distance was boiling!

—

“That jerk Mo Fan, the little fish hasn’t gone that far yet!” Ai Tutu screamed. She almost had an urge to beat the crap out of Mo Fan.

—

As Mo Fan’s blood continued to fall, the temperature of the rocks increased until the reef beneath him was blazing red.

Zu Xiangtian had to start hopping between his feet while he was standing on the reef.

“Are you finally going to use your Fire Element? I’ve been waiting for it!” Zu Xiangtian looked at Mo Fan with a proud grin.

Fire? Zu Xiangtian was not afraid of Mo Fan’s Fire Element, since it had yet to reach the Super Level. Even if Mo Fan was Possessed by Little Flame Belle, he would still be no match for him!

Mo Fan’s strongest Lightning Element was already used up. Even if he still had other tricks up in his sleeves, he would eventually lose the duel as he was bleeding excessively!

“Don’t force it, admitting your defeat isn’t as difficult as you thought. You just need to lower your head and say two words!” Zu Xiangtian smiled arrogantly.

Zu Xiangtian was obviously not trying to convince Mo Fan to surrender. He knew what he said would only provoke Mo Fan to stay in the fight!

It would be the most ideal outcome if Mo Fan kept fighting until he bled to death. He would not offend the people who were grateful toward Mo Fan if that happened, and he would be able to get rid of the eyesore too!

“Why are you acting like you’ve won the duel?” Mo Fan smiled. The blood all over him made his smile look savage and twisted!

“Three minutes! In three minutes, you won’t have a single drop of blood left. Even the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple won’t be able to save you!” Zu Xiangtian sneered.

“That’s more than enough!” Mo Fan replied.

“What is!?” Zu Xiangtian was getting impatient with Mo Fan’s illogical words.

“I just need half a minute to talk with you, a minute and a half to defeat you, and half a minute to walk away elegantly and greet the people of our country passionately,” Mo Fan scoffed.

Zu Xiangtian immediately pulled a long face.

Was this Mo Fan always so reluctant to admit his defeat? Beating him in just a minute and a half?

Not many old Mages across the country would dare to say something like that, let alone among the young Mages!

Besides, he was already severely injured. The injuries would greatly hinder his strength. Where did he even get his confidence from?

“Fine, I would like to see how you are going to beat me in a minute and a half!” Zu Xiangtian laughed.

The outcome had already been decided. There was no way Mo Fan could turn the tables around! If he was not injured, he might have a glimpse of hope to win, but it was completely impossible now!

“Did you drink enough?” Mo Fan suddenly piped up.

“What drink enough? What the hell are you talking about?” Zu Xiangtian was annoyed.

What the heck was Mo Fan going on about now?

“You seem to mind every word I say. I think you are starting to be afraid of me,” Mo Fan added.

“Nonsense! I just don’t like it when someone keeps babbling in front of me!” Zu Xiangtian refuted immediately.

“It’s the right reaction. You should be afraid. I was asking the rocks under my feet if they had drunk enough,” Mo Fan told him graciously.

“You’re f**king insane to let the rocks drink your blood. Do you think those rocks can come to life and beat me after drinking your blood? You are seriously the most retarded opponent I have ever faced!” Zu Xiangtian burst out laughing.

“Your information is finally accurate for once!” Mo Fan laughed.

Blood was still pouring out from his wounds. It went from bright red to dark red.

When the drops of dark red blood landed on the reefs, they were no longer glowing with heat.

It was just as Zu Xiangtian had mentioned; the rocks were drinking Mo Fan’s blood greedily. The lifeless rocks had come to life like a devil after obtaining fresh blood. The entire surface was shaking hard, as it was trying to break free from the chains that were tying it down!

“It’s dark red...” Mo Fan murmured, staring at the blood that was flowing out of his body.

The dark red blood was most likely the power of the demon inside him.

Even the demon in him was bleeding. The injuries he had sustained were more serious than he thought!

If the bright red blood previously was only providing energy for the devil to come to life, the dark red blood of the demon had allowed the devil to evolve completely!

The Floating Reefs Battleground was a symbol of the old fortress. It underwent an astonishing change after Mo Fan fed it his blood and the demon’s blood.

The internal structure of the reef was being reassembled. The surface was vibrating with great energy. A terrifying roar that sounded like it had originated from Hell rose up, as if a demon ten thousand feet under the sea had awoken, unleashing its wrath across the sea to bring destruction upon the cities!

Half of the old fortress was shaking now. The dilapidated buildings collapsed to the ground as the reef rose up like it had been granted life!

The Floating Reefs Battleground was moving. It had turned into a Raging Reef Demon!

Its shoulders were like mountains. Its huge arms were engulfed in burning lava. Its chest was as magnificent as a dam.

The sea was spacious and the city was huge, yet everything felt incredibly tiny when the enormous demon rose up. The humans were literally ants in the eyes of the demon spirit summoned by the Blood Pact of the Earth.

—

“Oh...oh mama!”

“I want to go home and do my homework. I will never watch a duel again!”

“Mo Fan! We are sorry! We are sorry!”

The smell of piss lingered among the crowd. Many of them had seen enormous beings before, but they had never heard of a power that could turn the entire Floating Reefs Battleground into a towering rock demon. Ordinary people would not be able to control their bladder after seeing something like it!

—

Mo Fan stood on the Raging Reefs Demon, like a deity looking down at the living.

Zu Xiangtian was as insignificant as a kitten in Mo Fan’s eyes. What about the Kunlun Inferior Ancestral Tiger? Its yellow fur was already standing on its end. It was spooked out of its mind!

“What...what kind of magic is that?” Zu Xiangtian bleated out in a trembling voice.

The Summoning Element? No way, there wasn’t any presence of its energy!

My informer did not mention anything about this!

“It seems like I’ve overestimated you being able to last for a minute and a half. Where do you want to go to treat your injuries for the rest of your life? I’ll give you a ride there!” Mo Fan was planning to offer Zu Xiangtian a free ticket to anywhere in the world. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Raging Reef Demon was tied to Mo Fan by blood. It stomped the ground fiercely when it felt Mo Fan’s anger!

The Vice Mayor of Feiniao City should be extremely grateful to him, as the stomp completely razed the remaining buildings that were going to be demolished to the ground. Every single building of the four blocks had turned into dust, regardless of its condition. Most importantly, the Raging Reef Demon had only stomped the ground to gather its strength!
