The Poisonous Golden Mummies were fast asleep. However, they were soon woken up by Mo Fan and the others, who had trespassed into their resting grounds.

Their cries were as ear-piercing as demon infants, with a strong evil presence. Their eyes suddenly turned red, as an overwhelming aura of hatred filled with the presence of death swept at the team like a strong wind as soon as the demon creatures woke up.

“What do we do now?” Zhao Manyan started to tremble while staring at the Poisonous Golden Mummies.

“What is there to discuss? Engage them directly!” Mo Fan did not hesitate. He immediately approached the poisonous mummies.

It was exactly what General Fenna had warned them about: the Poisonous Golden Mummies were extremely cunning and agile, and would always avoid fighting Mages directly. Even when their numbers significantly exceeded the Chinese team, they still remained standing on the high ground and spat out a tide of poisonous mist! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The poisonous tide was golden-green, like a veil of smoke. It surged forward like a tide. Everyone on the national team tried to stop it, yet they were struggling to resist the fierce tide of poison.

“Retreat, back off!” Nanyu screamed at the others when she realized the danger the team was in.

The poisonous tide was incredibly powerful, and its poison was extremely deadly. No one would dare to joke with their lives. If the poisonous tide was to sweep through some woods or mountains, every plant would wilt instantly and every living thing would suffocate!

“What did I say? Those guys aren’t reliable at all!” Captain Wankos snapped furiously.

Currently, the main army was advancing to the high ground. Countless undead were flanking them from all directions, leaving the army in quite a pinch.

However, Wankos happened to see the students withdrawing from the poisonous tide miserably. He immediately lost his calm.

They were already struggling to hold their ground. If the Poisonous Golden Mummies joined the battle, their casualties would multiply instantly!

“I’ll go with my own men!” Captain Wankos ran out of patience. He disregarded the general’s order and led a group of soldiers for the other side of the hill.

No matter how overwhelming the numbers of hardened undead were, they still stood no chance against the continuous blasts of destructive spells. However, if the poison reached the army, the casualties would be immeasurable!

Captain Wankos soon reached the side of the hill. He brought his men and flanked the Poisonous Golden Mummies from the side. There were some Undead Mages among his men, who were controlling their own undead to fight against the Poisonous Golden Mummies!

“Damn it, why are they so impatient?” Zhao Manyan yelled when he saw another team engaging the Poisonous Golden Mummies.

“They don’t trust us,” Mu Tingying said discontentedly. She did not like being looked down on by the others.

“If these Poisonous Golden Mummies spat out the poisonous smoke at the same time, we won’t be able to get closer to them at all. The poison... crap, those guys are about to be surrounded by the poisonous smoke? How do they not know how deadly the poison is?” Jiang Yu said.

The team soon realized that the Poisonous Golden Mummies were targeting the squad of Battlemages that had just arrived.

“Look up there; there’s a Poisonous Golden Mummy with three eyes!” Jiang Shaoxu pointed to the high ground.

“It’s most likely the Commander of the Poisonous Golden Mummies. I told you we should take out their leader first. Just keep the Poisonous Golden Mummies occupied, Li Kaifeng and I will take out their Commander!” Guan Yu said.

Before Nanyu could make the decision, Guan Yu and Li Kaifeng both shot away. They must have gone to find a way to get closer to the Three-Eyed Poisonous Golden Mummy.

“I guess this is the only way to do it,” Mo Fan suddenly murmured.

Saying this, Mo Fan activated the soul imprint to summon the Black Snake Armor. The blue-black scales wrapped tightly around his body. He looked rather imperious under the sunlight.

However, the others were confused about what Mo Fan was up to.

“Why are you putting on the magic armor when we haven’t even engaged the enemy?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“It’s my biochemical suit! Friends, my hands are itching; I’ll be going first!” Mo Fan replied.

Mo Fan charged directly at the Poisonous Golden Mummies in his blue-black Black Snake Armor.

The poison was like a destructive, black tide rolling forward. It was extremely corrosive; any living creature that was exposed to it for a few minutes would be covered in spots, which would soon boil and bleed seriously...

Clad in his Black Snake Armor, Mo Fan moved freely in the poisonous tide without any trouble!

Mo Fan was not afraid of poison, as he had a special answer to it: the Black Snake Armor!

The Black Totem Snake was the ancestor of poison; no creature was comparable to it in terms of toxicity. Mo Fan would never forget how the Black Totem Snake had stopped the horde of White Magic Falcons from the Nanling Mountains from advancing further by using its Poison Domain. Not a single White Magic Falcon that entered its Domain had survived!

As such, not only was the magic armor made of the Black Totem Snake’s scales extremely sturdy, it also had a strong resistance to poison. Mo Fan was basically immune to poison when he was wearing the Black Snake Armor!

The Poisonous Golden Mummies might be extremely terrifying to the Egyptians, but in Mo Fan’s eyes, they were just a bunch of feeble, Warrior-level undead. Since their poison could no longer pose any threat to him, he could easily charge right into them and massacre the whole bunch!

Flames surged fiercely. The Poisonous Golden Mummies were extremely scared of fire, especially the scorching Calamity Fire and Rose Flame. Even the Poisonous Golden Mummies seemingly-strong skin was unable to resist Mo Fan’s flames!

It was not exaggerating to say that every puff of flame was enough to kill a Poisonous Golden Mummy!

Mo Fan did not aim for the Three-Eyed Poisonous Golden Mummy. In Mo Fan’s eyes, these Warrior-level Poisonous Golden Mummies were more valuable to him, not only because of their undead crystals, but because of their Warrior-level Soul Remnants!

Back in the Sahara Desert, the Little Loach Pendant had refined the Soul Remnants of the Poison Fire Scorpions and Sandfear Foxes into five Warrior-level Soul Essences. However, it seemed like the Soul Remnants of the Poisonous Golden Mummies were more valuable, meaning that he could refine more Soul Essences by collecting their Soul Remnants. He would soon acquire the fifth-tier Lightning Strike!

That being said, the fifth-tier Lightning Strike was only Mo Fan’s first goal. What he needed was the fifth-tier Thunderbolt, as its damage would surely match that of his Advanced Lightning Spell!
