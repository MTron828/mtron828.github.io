“Zu Xiangtian,” the man with thick brows said. He sounded like the others would immediately know who he was as soon as he mentioned his name.

Unfortunately, Mo Fan had never really cared about the renowned clans and their prominent figures. He was about to ask the man who he was when Leng Qing tugged his sleeve, hinting to him that there was no need to complicate the matter any further.

“How ignorant can you be? You should know who Zu Jiming is, right?” the proud handsome man spoke up.

“Zu Jiming... it sounds a little familiar,” Mo Fan recalled. The name sounded familiar, but he was struggling to remember who the person was.

“He was a member of the national team!” the handsome man snapped.

“Oh, that guy. Are you two from the same clan as him?” Mo Fan finally realized.

So it was that idiot Zu Jiming, the guy that did nothing apart from sneering and trying to set them up? Even Guan Yu was less of an eyesore than Zu Jiming. That Zu Jiming was nothing but a retard!

Zu Jiming was replaced in the last match during the World College Tournament, Mui Nujiao taking his spot. Zu Jiming had visited many countries during the training that had lasted for more than a year, yet his contributions were inferior to Mui Nujiao, who only took part in the last match during the World College Tournament.

That being said, Zu Jiming was only a side character. The one who was influential back then was the chairman’s secretary, Zu Huiyin. She was a powerful government official, yet she had lost her job under pressure from the people of the Ancient Capital because of her inappropriate remarks!

The chairman’s secretary was comparable to the role of a Councilman, and their status was slightly higher than one. However, not only had the Zu Clan failed to earn any recognition during the World College Tournament and lost an important government position, they were greatly condemned by the people, too!

It was obvious why the people of the Zu Clan hated Mo Fan so much.

The Zu Clan was famous in China. The Mu Clan was known for their Mages, the Zhao Clan was known for their wealth, while the Zu Clan was said to be the country’s pride...

The Zu Clan was extremely resourceful, with a massive network of connections. Many of their people were appointed officials, and Zu Huiyin was one of the future leaders that the clan had high hopes for.

The clan needed to hold a certain power in the country to be able to be well-received internationally. It was the key to extending their influence, so Zu Huiyin had been playing an important role in the clan. She had always behaved herself and worked diligently. Even though Councilman Shao Zheng was not too fond of her, he never had a reasonable excuse to stop her from climbing higher.

To her surprise, she fell so miserably due to some insignificant remarks, paying a great price for her words. Fortunately, the Zu Clan’s main assets and influence leaned toward the international level, or the clan would have been severely impacted after their reputation was ruined in China.

Zu Xiangtian was Zu Jiming’s elder brother. He had been a member of the national team during the previous World College Tournament. He was quite famous at the international level, on par with someone like Herr Casa!

As a matter of fact, those that had managed to earn a reputation during the World College Tournament in the past had often secured great fame and status from their achievements. The greatest factor in their success was their ability to achieve the Super Level at a young age!

The reputation they earned during the World College Tournament...

Strength in the Super Level at a young age...

Their formidable backgrounds...

Any of the three criteria above was enough for a person to shine brightly, let alone someone that had met all three criteria at a young age!

It explained why Rosie had delicately prepared the dinner to receive them. She was receiving Zu Xiangtian, who was on the same level as Herr Casa...

That being said, Rosie did not expect Mo Fan to ruin it all!

“By the way, I almost forgot to ask, Leng Qing, it was a surprise that you came to visit me all of a sudden. Was there something urgent?” Rosie attempted to switch the topic after noticing how tense the atmosphere was.

Mo Fan had no idea who Zu Xiangtian was, but Leng Qing was well aware of the man’s identity, hence she had signaled Mo Fan not to make the situation worse. Leng Qing could not have cared less if he was just an ordinary disciple of a renowned clan, but Zu Xiangtian was no ordinary person!

“Oh, we only came to ask something. Did you buy the heart of a young Tyrant Titan from an auction recently? We noticed a potential threat that might endanger the lives of the folk in Athens, so we came to ask where the heart of the young Tyrant Titan was from and who the seller was?” Leng Qing said.

“Well...” Rosie did not know how to answer that.

“Humph, our subsidiary clan in Greece got it. What about it? Do you want it?” the handsome man grinned coldly.

“Basically, we were looking for a Tyrant Titan’s heart, and the Luba Clan happened to find one. They were planning to sell it at a later date, but since we needed it urgently, we asked the Luba Clan to auction it off, and we’d bid for it at the highest price. The Luba Clan has done us a favor, therefore, I’ve invited their person-in-charge here to express my gratitude. I also hope that we can have more cooperation in the future,” Rosie explained.

Rosie was feeling troubled now. She was trying to switch the topic, yet it somehow pointed back at the same issue.

In other words, the Zu Clan was the one that had provided her with the Tyrant Titan’s heart. The Luba Clan in Greece was a subsidiary to the Zu Clan! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You guys took the heart from a young Tyrant Titan recently, right?” Mo Fan asked blatantly.

“How is that your concern?” Zu Kuangli said.

“Are you seriously telling me that you didn’t know a mature Silver Moon Tyrant Titan is roaming on the outskirts of the city!?” Mo Fan retorted.

“Is that true?” Zu Xiangtian looked at Rosie.

Rosie nodded silently.

“Even so, it’s the Parthenon Temple’s concern. You’re not from the Parthenon Temple. What right do you have to criticize us?” Zu Kuangli said.

“Yes, I believe the Hall of Knights will handle it appropriately. Let’s not worry about it,” Rosie said.

“We noticed that the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan might turn hostile from despair, but the Hall of Knights claims it’s not going to do anything crazy. We are afraid that it’s going to be a threat, so we came to find out the truth. We hope you will tell us if you obtained the Tyrant Titan’s heart from the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan’s kin. If so, we have to let the Hall of Knights know, and they will treat the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan more seriously,” Leng Qing explained calmly.
