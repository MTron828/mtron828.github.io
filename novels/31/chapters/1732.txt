Little Moon Moth Phoenix was now able to fly higher without having to worry about the Mountain Crusher Ruler.

Only three mountains were left at their current height. Mo Fan glanced at them and noticed a strange ancient tree.

Astonishingly enough, the tree was growing right on top of the clouds. Its roots were intertwined throughout the clouds, its twisting trunk having branches extending out from the mountain or meandering upwards.

“That’s the Tree of Vows!” Lingling declared confidently.

“Are we almost at the Skycloud Realm already?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, the Skycloud Realm is just ahead, but apparently, we must rely on the special tall trees to move around. Otherwise, the Wind of Sorrow will freeze everything in the Skycloud Realm,” Lingling said.

The greater the altitude, the lower the temperature, especially when the strange Wind of Sorrow was around. The temperature was enough to stop a living creature’s blood from flowing, hence even the Ruler-level creatures struggled to fly at this height.

Mo Fan soon noticed a few Ruler-level winged beasts heading toward the towering trees. They circled the splayed branches, using them as a cover from the fierce Wind of Sorrow.

“Let’s head over, too. I think we should also be able to find what we have come for,” Zhao Manyan said.

The Tree of Vows was their goal. They could not care less about anything else.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix approached the Tree of Vows and landed on a huge colorful leaf. The leaf directly prevented the icy Wind of Sorrow from striking Little Moon Moth Phoenix and the others.

“Is there really a Deer God here?” Mo Fan looked around, but did not find any trace of the Deer God.

“Speaking of which, don’t you think the tree looks a little familiar?” Lingling wondered aloud.

Mo Fan looked up and studied the tree. He did recognize the tree from somewhere after taking a closer look. He soon realized something after thinking about it.

“This thing... it looks just like the demon tree, apart from the difference in color!” Mo Fan exclaimed. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Giant Purple Linden!

The Tree of Vows’ appearance was extremely similar to the Giant Purple Linden. If Lingling hadn’t pointed it out, he would not have noticed it at all!

“What’s going on here?” Zhao Manyan was terrified too.

“Stay calm,” Yu Shishi broke in. “Little Moon Moth Phoenix has explained to me from what she can recall. The Tree of Vows and the Giant Purple Linden used to be a single tree with two trunks that existed between the Ashwood Wind Layer and the Skycloud Realm. However, the Giant Purple Linden was cursed by some powerful magic, forcing it to feed on blood and flesh just to survive, thus turning it into the demon tree you stumbled into...”

“The Tree of Vows and the demon tree were twins?” Zhao Manyan was shocked.

“Mm, that might be true! The Tree of Vows is empowered by the Psychic and Blessing Elements. Anyone who swears a vow under the Tree of Vows will imprint it in their soul,” Lingling informed them.

“Will it attack us, then?”

“No, don’t worry. The Tree of Vows doesn’t have any power to attack,” Yu Shishi told them.

“Why does Little Moon Moth Phoenix know all this?” Mo Fan asked, confused again.

“She used to live on the Tree of Vows a long time ago!” Yu Shishi said.

“I see.”

“Can you ask Little Moon Moth Phoenix about the Deer God? Take a look at this,” Mo Fan took out the Horn of the Deer God and showed it to Little Moon Moth Phoenix.

The Little Moon Moth Phoenix beat her wings and glided down to the roots of the Tree of Vows. Its roots were dangling from the cliffs of the mountain, as if they were growing inside the clouds to acquire nutrients from them.

The Little Moon Moth Phoenix flew into the clouds, and soon returned with something like a piece of coral.

“What is that? It’s the God Deer we are looking for. Don’t tell me it has already gone and died?” Mo Fan protested.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix went up to the disappointed Mo Fan and placed the object she had found in front of him.

Mo Fan took a closer look at the strange object. He had no clue how it was related to the Deer God.

Little Moon Moth Phoenix began to emit a purifying light. It shone upon the object and the outer surface began to peel off!

The surface fell off and revealed a yellow horn. When the stuff that had attached to it had fallen off, Mo Fan was surprised to see that it was indeed a beautiful horn of a deer!

The horn had a unique luster, the same as the colorful leaves of the Tree of Vows. The horn was also a lot bigger than the part Mo Fan was holding!

“Mo Fan, your horn is actually a broken piece from the horn here!” Zhao Manyan blurted out after noticing something.

The purifying light Little Moon Moth Phoenix was emitting washed across the horn Mo Fan was holding, revealing its true colors. Mo Fan followed Zhao Manyan’s instructions and attached the Horn of the Deer God he had bought in Greece to the larger horn. He was shocked to see that the Horn of the Deer God he had accidentally stumbled into at an auction was actually only a part of the real horn, and only around a fifth of it, at that!

After the missing piece was added to the horn, it instantly unleashed a strong aura. Mo Fan felt like a Totem Beast with five different Elements was standing before him!

“Little Moon Moth Phoenix says the God Deer has long since passed away, but the real Horn of the Deer God might provide you with some help,” Yu Shishi informed him.

Mo Fan observed Little Loach’s reaction. The little pendant was blatantly broadcasting its urge to devour the whole thing!

It was more than just some help for him; it was exactly the Totem Power Little Loach was desperately looking for. Mo Fan could even feel an overwhelming mysterious force rising from the Horn when the missing piece was reattached to it!

“Wait, my wooden clapper isn’t reacting. Goddamnit!” Zhao Manyan suddenly yelled.

He had followed Mo Fan through depths of sorrows to look for the Totem Beasts, but it turned out that his wooden clapper was not even interested in the Totem Power of the Deer God. He was about to suffer a mental breakdown.

He had a feeling that he had been tricked by Mo Fan!

“Old Zhao, don’t be like that. Once I reach the Super Level, I can figure out a way to help you overcome your difficulties too,” Mo Fan comforted Zhao Manyan.

Mo Fan was overjoyed. This should be enough for him to achieve the Super Level!

He would worry about Old Zhao’s advancement later. If worse came to worst, he could just accompany Zhao Manyan until he found the way to achieve the Super Level!
