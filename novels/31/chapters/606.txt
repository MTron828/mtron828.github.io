The purple of death loomed over every corner in the city. Some old folk who had just woken up at dawn rubbed their eyes and said with a smile to his neighbor, “Hey Old Xu, I don’t think I have many days left, my eyes are going nuts early in the morning...”

However, seeing that the old man next door also had a terrified look, the old man that had just woken up immediately realized something!

The kids who had yet to reach the age to go to school were crying. The adults simply ignored their cries and carried on with their routines. However, they discovered that the street just two blocks away had completely vanished. Not long afterwards, a purple glow descended from the sky. Their faces were completely blank, like never before!

The teenagers who had gone to bed late rolled over in their beds, trying to get back to sleep. In the end, they finally ran out of patience and opened their windows to check on what was going on out there. They simply saw purple and people running in its light. Cars jammed the streets. People abandoned their cars and ran on foot. Officials in uniforms were evacuating the civilians. Their first reaction was wondering whether they were having a dream, but when countless calls started ringing on their phones, they were thunderstruck...

Purple, the alert that even the old folks who had spent half a century living in the Ancient Capital had never seen before!

A new day was being welcomed with a boundless aura of death.

Up on the tower, Mo Fan heard cries of the undead in the distance. They were more shocking than those emitted that night!

Beside him, Shorty, who had finally calmed down, dropped to his knees. Tears ran down his cheek as he cried in grief.

He was sobbing and mumbling, like he was seeking Mo Fan’s comfort. “I was at the hospital last night, I heard that it was the best hospital for women in childbirth... I saw the gathering signal from the window, that’s why I’m here. Normally, I wouldn’t come, but...but I thought that when it all comes to an end, I can tell my son that on the day he was born, his dad was so brave... but now... it’s all gone...”

“He might be a daughter,” said Mo Fan, who was the worst when it came to comforting people.

“Shut the f**k up!” yelled Shorty.

“Maybe they are not dead, maybe she had premature labor, and they went home earlier, since we were fighting for such a long time...” added Mo Fan.

The words barely calmed Shorty down.

The whole tower was exhausted. Everyone had just gone through a great victorious fight that they assumed would surely be recorded in the history of mankind. However, what followed it was despair crashing down on them like a tsunami. No one knew what they should do, be it protecting the walls that were already blasted open, or leaving with the civilians that were clumped together like porridge in a pot. Beyond them, the undead outnumbered the living several times over. They were no longer roaming aimlessly, but advancing like an ocean.

A massive skeletal creature with bone wings was circling around in the sky, glancing down at the city that it could easily annihilate like ants. Humans were too petty in its eyes, it could even eliminate Magicians with ease...

It let out a roar from high in the sky, commanding the undead to rise from their graves. Their sinister white bones were everywhere!

In the far distance, an enormous zombie like a mountain appeared out of nowhere among the sea of undead. The quake produced from each step it took spread all the way to the city. The city walls that were as sturdy as a steel barrel were trembling under its footsteps!

The Mountain Zombie was responding to the Nether Bone Ruler’s cry. Its figure was like a towering banner, millions of zombies crowding around it. The numbers of those crawling out from the ground and coming from the distance in the north was enough to fill the horizon...

The drizzle had become heavier, forming a gray curtain between the Heaven and Earth. Together with the endless undead, a giant web was formin, slowly drawing in toward the city!

“Du Xiao, don’t be ridiculous...” Advisor Zhu hauled Senior Hunter Du Xiao back.

The three leaders – Zhu Meng, Fei Jiao, and Lu Xu – were in a bad shape, like all the others. They did not even have the chance to treat their injuries. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Phantom Tyrant Emperor was only a small ruler among the undead, yet it took four of them to barely kill it, at the cost of severe injuries. Meanwhile, the Nether Bone Ruler was a lot stronger than the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. Even at full strength, they had little chance of defeating it, let alone when they were all worn out and injured...

Now the Mountain Zombie around fifty kilometers away too; that was the real big ruler!

“That guy is most likely from the same era as the Black Totem Snake. Listen to the orders from higher up: immediately retreat to the barrier inside the city. Any of us dying here will result in ten times the casualties in the future!” Zhu Meng displayed his calm as a Councilman.

However, the veins on his fist were knotted. He was the initiator of the Threat-Elimination Strategy, yet he was totally unaware of this disaster before it had happened.

How was this possible?

Why were the undead able to move freely in the daytime, and there are more of them than at night!

So many undead have appeared out of nowhere; does this mean the king of the Kingdom of Undead has risen, the thing that has been asleep for thousands of years just happened to rise today...

“Zhu Meng...” Mo Fan called out to Councilman Zhu Meng with a stern face.

“You should run too, leave the walls. Let’s hope that the barrier is enough to protect us this time...” Zhu Meng let out a sigh. He seemed very old all of a sudden.

It had been so long since so many undead appeared close to the Ancient Capital. They should have expected this to happen when the undead had been misbehaving lately, yet they were hoping it was only a coincidence.

Where could the people run to during a purple alert?

What chance did they have to survive?

Even the Magicians had trouble staying alive with the God of Death hunting them down, let alone the commoners...

Even if he wanted to step forward bravely to save the residents on the streets, he sometimes did not even have the right to die a martyr’s death, because of his position. He had to stay alive, or the people would lose all hope.

“I know I should be running, but I have to tell you what I feel..” Mo Fan lowered his voice. His face was harder than ever before.

“Go ahead,” said Zhu Meng with a deep look.

“Bo City, you must know I come from Bo City... I don’t care if you believe me or not, but I can smell the Black Vatican!” Mo Fan said coldly.

“The Black Vatican! Why so?” Zhu Meng was astounded.

“The rain!” said Mo Fan.

Zhu Meng was startled.

The rain?

Was he saying that the undead were only able to remain active in the sunlight because of the rain that had just started not long ago?

The Ancient Capital had been drenched in rain before, yet he never heard the undead would turn so wild...
