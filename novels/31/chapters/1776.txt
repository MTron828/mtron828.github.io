Chapter 1777: I’ll Eliminate Them!

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The moon was cold, like frost hanging above the mountain and the city.

As midnight approached, Mo Fan looked around the city. It was initially surrounded by buildings of different heights, and it looked more or less the same now, but the tall figures standing in the city were no longer buildings, but huge rock demons whose eyes were scanning the destroyed city like spotlights, searching for the food that would make them stronger.

The Mages were shivering in fear in hiding places between the buildings. They did not dare even breathe heavily. The only advantage they had was that the huge rock demons were struggling to spot them when they were in cover.

“Luckily, they didn’t have any magical ways to pick up our presence. If it was any other Warrior-level beast or demon, they could easily pick up our scent!” Lin Qihui was hidden behind a half-collapsed market. The beams of the building had happened to form a cave.

Lin Qihui and the other members of the group were hiding there, waiting for the Rock Generals nearby to leave.

Huge blasts were approaching. Dust and tiny pieces of rocks began to fall inside the cave.

“Don’t make a sound!” Lin Qihui signaled the others.

Only a massive creature could possibly make such a huge noise when moving!

Lin Qihui peeked at the opening through the crack. A thirty-meter-tall creature veined with lines of ore stood there and scanned its surroundings. It was obviously searching for weaker Mages!

Lin Qihui’s face went pale. The Rock Generals were already troublesome to deal with for them, let alone the Granite Beasts.

It was so close to him that his heart almost stopped beating.

It can’t see us, it can’t see us, it can’t see us!, Lin Qihui chanted in his heart. These elemental creatures did not have sharp senses, hence they would be safe as long as they avoided stepping into view. Their spot was secured. They had managed to hide from a few groups of Rock Monsters!

“Se...senior!” Cao Juan suddenly cried out softly.

“Be quiet!” Lin Qihui hissed.

“Look below you,” Cao Juan whispered.

Lin Qihui finally lowered his head and saw ripples surfacing on the ground covered in ash under his feet.

The ripples were like wind blowing at the dust. It was difficult to notice them without taking a closer look. However, it was obviously magic, since it was impossible for the dust to be rippling when there was no wind!

The Granite Beast initially had its back to the market, but it suddenly turned around and glanced down at the half-collapsed building.

BANG!

The Granite Beast swung its arm and knocked the debris away. The people underneath were staring at the Granite Beast in fear, like a bunch of dwarves when the roof of their house was flung open!

“How...how could this be...” Lin Qihui gasped in a trembling voice.

The Granite Beast grinned as if it was mocking them.

It did not grab the humans. It simply turned around and left. It was obvious that these weak Mages had no place in its eyes.

However, a few Rock Generals immediately surrounded them as soon as the Granite Beast left. The Rock Generals were clearly going to split the food among themselves!

Lin Qihui and the others were no longer able to fight. The Rock Generals grabbed them like majestic demon eagles hunting chicks, and absorbed the humans one-by-one into their bodies.

“The Granite Beast is able to use Earth Magic. They can use tiny ripples across surfaces to sense the Mages hiding across the city. The number of Rock Generals has increased significantly, and the number of Granite Beasts has tripled, too,” Wen Xia came and whispered to Mo Fan.

“Do you think the soldiers and the Magic Association can eliminate them all once their Seals are lifted?” Mo Fan asked.

There were only twenty minutes left until the Barrier Core was activated, yet no one was feeling optimistic about it.

The fire was already too strong to be put out!

“I’m afraid not,” Wen Xia said.

“Get rid of my Seal first,” Mo Fan said.

“Well...” Wen Xia hesitated for a moment. She glanced at Xie Qinghua and Lu Bin on the other side and whispered, “Come with me.”

Wen Xia brought Mo Fan to the side after agreeing to lift the Seal for him.

“I can get rid of the Seal for you, but you must promise me that you won’t use other Elements until the barrier is activated,” Wen Xia said seriously.

“Don’t worry, you guys have sacrificed so much. I won’t ruin it unless the worst happens,” Mo Fan promised.

The Seal was like a lock on Mo Fan’s soul. Mo Fan would have no problem breaking it forcibly with his current cultivation and mental strength; it would only injure his soul slightly. But there was no reason for him to take the blame for obstructing the plan to establish the Elemental Capital for nothing.

A deafening roar came from the ravine. A shocking figure, which made the signal towers look like little kids, began heading toward the city center. They could already feel its terrifying presence from a fair distance away!

“Another Black-Silver Rock Demon has shown up, and it’s such a huge one!” Mo Fan muttered.

Wen Xia’s face turned pale.

The Black-Silver Rock Demons were their biggest threat. The barrier might be able to stop the Rock Monsters, Rock Generals, and the Granite Beasts, but it was nowhere strong enough to stop the Black-Silver Rock Demons!

“There are four Black-Silver Rock Demons now. They are going to break the barrier down...” Wen Xia said in low spirits.

“You guys have underestimated these evil Elemental Spirits,” Mo Fan agreed.

Wen Xia clenched her fists, staring at the Black-Silver Rock Demons.

“Either way, we are fighting until the very end!” Wen Xia said. She looked at Mo Fan and begged sincerely, “You are strong, I know that, so I ask you to lend me a hand and help me kill another Black-Silver Rock Demon, please!”

Mo Fan shook his head.

Wen Xia was still staring at Mo Fan. She was not willing to move her gaze away. Her face was trembling slightly.

Just one! Wen Xia had an urge to do everything she could to kill a Black-Silver Rock Demon. It was all she could do for the city!

Mo Fan rose to his feet and dusted off his shoulders.

“You’ll be helping me this time... I’m going to eliminate the four Black-Silver Rock Demons!” Mo Fan said.

Killing the four Black-Silver Rock Demons would not necessarily turn the tide around, but... it would not stop Mo Fan from killing them all!
