Chapter 3102 Companion Totem RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

There were two Sixteen-Winged Blazing Angels in the Holy City. Uri had returned to the Holy City before Michael, which meant that he had reached the Sixteen-Winged realm earlier than Michael!

Uri seldom spoke out in the Holy City and was willing to stay under Michael’s shadow. Who would have thought that he was also a Sixteen-Winged Blazing Angel?

The seven archangels were indeed extraordinary!

“He can execute me, but I can’t execute him? What kind of rule is that?” said Mo Fan. “If you respect the unknown and the new magic element, you should have shown up and helped me when I was thrown into hell by him instead of… instead of…”

Mo Fan took a deep breath. The man with the rotten face in the swamp appeared in his mind.

The one who had saved him was not from among these Blazing Angels but a Fallen Angel from the Dark Plane.

Mo Fan would not let Michael go just because two Blazing Angels requested it. He did not need to prove anything to the world. All he wanted was to make Michael pay the price for killing people unnecessarily.

“We have our reasons. If you insist on going your way, we can only end this matter with a war,” said Uri.

Uri signaled at Ramiel. Ramiel nodded. He raised his right hand high and clenched it tightly. An aura flew toward Sky Holy City, and pieces of gorgeous golden meteors soon fell into the ruins of the Holy City.

More golden meteors appeared and turned into a shocking rainstorm of olden light. These were the armed forces of the Holy City. Their numbers were more than what was expected. Even those people who looked like ordinary residents of the Holy City held hidden positions. Under Ramiel’s order, they all flew into the ruined battlefield of the Holy City.

Suddenly, the ruins of the Holy City shone golden. The Holy City guards appeared along the avenues. Looking down from the sky, it looked like a galaxy shining with golden light. The aura emitted was unprecedentedly strong!

The real foundation of the Holy City was also fully revealed at this time. The three Blazing Angels, Ramiel, Rafael, and Uri would not easily compromise with Mo Fan, even if Mo Fan had reached the realm of a semi-omnipotent Magic God!

“Ramiel!” Ye Xinxia walked to him with a cold and angry face.

All the Knights of the Seal had returned to her side, including the enslaved Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. It stood behind Ye Xinxia and the other Knights of the Seal.

The Light Dragon roared. It flapped its wings and landed behind Archangel Ramiel. It was almost as big as the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. The two ancient creatures faced each other hostilely across a broken wall.

“You want to violate the agreement?” Ye Xinxia asked.

Before she finished speaking, the battle song rang on the plain of the Holy City, and the female attendants of the Goddess Peak sang the bloody battle song of the Parthenon Temple from a distance. The melody full of fighting spirit echoed in the Holy City as if a fearless iron-blooded army was ready to attack.

The mighty army of the Parthenon Temple finally arrived. They marched quickly and reached outside the Holy City!

The walls of the Holy City looked like mere decorations. The two main legions were full of sacred aura. One side was golden, while the other was gold, silver, and blue!

“We won’t allow Mo Fan to kill another archangel. That is non-negotiable. We won’t retreat even if it means war!” Ramiel said righteously.

“We want you to let Michael live. This is not for his sake but for the Holy City,” Uri said solemnly.

…

As the snow fell, Mu Ningxue rescued Zhao Manyan from Michael’s green army. Black Totem Snake, Black Totem Turtle, and Moon Moth Phoenix flew together with Mu Ningxue and landed on the Holy City grounds.

Mu Ningxue stood on the same side as Mo Fan and pointed her sword at Archangel Rafael.

Although Mu Ningxue did not say a word, her fighting spirit was obvious. If they dared to attack Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue would kill Rafael, the Fourteen-Winged Blazing Angel!

“Brother Fan!”

Suddenly, someone shouted from high up in the sky. The Green East Sea God flew over with a young man on its back. The man jumped down and landed safely beside Mo Fan.

Mo Fan frowned. He did not want this particular person to get involved.

It was not because of their relationship but because Zhang Xiaohou was different from other people. He had a military rank in China.

“Chinese military? Haha. Does China want to get involved in this magic dispute?” Ramiel glanced at Zhang Xiaohou.

Although Zhang Xiaohou was not in a military uniform, Ramiel knew very well about the people who were around Mo Fan.

Zhang Xiaohou was a soldier and represented his country.

In any case, the country could not interfere with the battle arising in the magic convention. Even if it was a huge deal, the country could not participate in any shape or form, let alone the country’s military!

The country’s governance and magic were entirely different matters. Mo Fan’s contribution to the country was only just that. It was separate from the Holy City or the Magic Association.

“It seems like China wants to violate the national treaty because of Mo Fan. Very well. Holy City and other EU countries will wait for it!” Rafael said icily.

“Xiaohou, don’t step in. This is a war between us. It has nothing to do with the country.” Mo Fan stopped Zhang Xiaohou.

Once it rose to the level of a national war, the people involved would not only be from magic organizations. Ordinary people would also be affected. Mo Fan knew this very well.

“Brother Fan, don’t worry. I didn’t come to start a war. The country can’t interfere, and the country’s army will not get involved. However, we won’t stand by and let you be bullied by these people in Europe. This is for you!” Zhang Xiaohou passed something to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was a little puzzled. When he stretched his hand out to accept it, he felt a steady stream of energy pouring into his palm. The energy quickly moved from his palm to his forehead!

A blue mark suddenly appeared on his forehead!

It was a dragon pattern. The slender body twisted into the shape of a pendant. As Mo Fan absorbed the spring water from the vessel that Zhang Xiaohou handed him, the pattern on his forehead became clearer. It now blazed!

It was a familiar feeling. It was the nutrient that nurtured his soul. It was equivalent to the other him that existed.

“Little Loach…”

Mo Fan could not hold back his joy.

Since the battle in Magic City, Little Loach had gone into a deep sleep. Although it still provided Mo Fan with nutrients for cultivation, he could not feel the soul of Little Loach. Ever since he cultivated magic, he had never felt such a sense of loss. When he was imprisoned in the Holy City, he felt lonelier, mainly because of the silence of Little Loach.

Little Loach was recovering. It was on his forehead, and he could feel its emotions. Little Loach was the best friend Mo Fan had had since his childhood. It was angry because of the situation Mo Fan had been forced into, and it was flying toward him from very far away.

“The country can’t interfere, and the national army can’t take any action. However, the National Beast is not bound by such rules. Brother Fan, these are the Underground Holy Spring scattered all over the country that Chairman Shao Zheng and Commander Hua have collected for you. Although it is not all, it should be able to awaken your Companion Totem one more time,” Zhang Xiaohou said.
