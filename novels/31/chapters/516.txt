Mo Fan had overdone it this time!

He finally knew how dumb it was not to research his opponent before the battle. However, even if he knew about her Psychic Element, he would only be less surprised and miserable. Either way, he was totally clueless about how to fight against a Psychic Magician!

Ding Yumian’s casting speed was extremely fast, almost instantaneous. Mo Fan could not even draw the Star Orbits, let alone the Star Patterns!

No wonder the girl was able to roughly read his mind, the Psychic Element made her almost unbeatable in most duels.

“Fiery Fist!”

Ding Yumian did not give Mo Fan any chance to cast his Fire Spells. Meanwhile, she took hold of the opportunity to finish a Fire Element Star Pattern while Mo Fan was still affected by the Soul Impact.

Her fringes drifted in the wind before her forehead as a surge of heat energy spread out from the center of the dueling ground to the edges of the boundary. A huge fiery bracelet appeared on her wrist following a groan.

As the Fiery Fist approached Mo Fan, the Spell somehow covered a greater surface area than usual, looming over an area a few tens of meters wide across from where Mo Fan was standing.

“How is her Fiery Fist covering such a huge area?” Mo Fan cried out in astonishment.

He was around a hundred meters away from Ding Yumian. Normally, a Fiery Fist could mostly cover an area with a diameter of twenty meters from a hundred meters away. However, Mo Fan discovered that even though the diameter of the Fiery Fist was not as crazy as forty meters across, the area it covered was still significantly bigger!

It was impossible for him to escape from the Fiery Fist’s range with his bare feet.

Mo Fan, who had no chance of casting any Spell, was forced to activate the Blood Tabi. Despite that, the flames still managed to reach Mo Fan, who just made it out of the range of the Spell, as he clenched his teeth from the pain of the burn!

He managed to dodge the attack, yet his forehead was covered in sweat when he looked back and saw the burning pit with a diameter of close to forty meters.

“Is this her innate talent? The area of her Fire Spell was almost double that of any ordinary Magician!”

Mo Fan was astounded. He did not dare to underestimate his opponent any further.

That being said, him being serious did not make any difference at all. Ding Yumian’s fighting style was invincible...

Mo Fan was able to dodge the attacks while his Blood Tabi was still effective, but once it was on cooldown, he would have a hard time dodging her Fiery Fist.

“Fiery Fist: Nine Halls!”

Normally, Ding Yumian was like a fragile water lily, but her temperament when fighting was imposing and aggressive, not giving Mo Fan any chance to catch his breath. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She had begun to draw a Star Pattern once again. The outline of the Star Pattern was already completed under her feet. With only a few more strokes to finish the remaining Star Orbits, she would awaken the formidable power of the Nine Halls!

The effect of the Soul Impact finally wore off. However, when Mo Fan was finally able to cast a Spell, Ding Yumian would be less than seconds away from completing her channeling. The time was nowhere enough for him to cast an Intermediate Spell...

Mo Fan only had a chance to cast a Basic Spell. When he saw Ding Yumian on the verge of completing the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls, Mo Fan almost lost his calm and used his Shadow Element.

The Fleeing Shadow was his only chance to escape to somewhere safe...

“No way, I won’t use my trump card even if I lose the battle!” Mo Fan forfeited the thought of using his Shadow Element in front of the crowd. He drew the Star Pattern of the Summoning Element at his fastest speed.

“Dimensional Summoning: Swift Star Wolf!”

Seven lunar-white Stars appeared before Mo Fan. A gap was torn apart as the Stars were joined together in orbits.

A magnificent wolf leapt out from the gap. His starry blue hair drifted elegantly in the heat wave.

“Stop howling, start running!” Mo Fan yelled at the Swift Star Wolf who was still trying to declare his presence.

The just-arrived Swift Star Wolf was totally clueless about the situation. However, when he saw a woman not far away slamming her Fiery Fist full of energy onto the ground, and he sensed the overwhelming energy below the ground, he immediately fled into the distance!

The Fire Pillars were twice as thick of the normal Fiery Fist: Nine Halls. The fiery flames surged ferociously as the Fire Pillars rose into the air from the ground!

The Fiery Fist: Nine Halls was a destructive Spell with a huge area-of-effect to begin with, hence the flames produced by the Fire Pillars devoured almost half of the dueling ground instantly...

Together with Ding Yumian’s innate talent, the crowd simply saw the dueling ground covered in a blazing red burst of flames; it was impossible to find a safe spot!

The Swift Star Wolf carried Mo Fan away, fleeing like a coward. The beast groaned in pain as he suffered damage from the fierce flames.

Fortunately, the Swift Star Wolf was a very agile creature. He barely found the gaps between the Fire Pillars and rolling flames. Mo Fan was wise to Summon the Swift Star Wolf when he only had the chance of casting a Basic Spell. Otherwise, he would never have been able to escape from a Nine Halls with twice the area!

“Humph, if it weren’t for his Double Innate Elements, he would have lost by now!” Huang Xingli blurted out in dissatisfaction from up among the spectators.

Without the Summoning Element, Mo Fan would have lost the duel after being forced into a corner.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan, who was crying out in pain because of the flames, had finally experienced the strength of those in the top ten. The mountain-like pressure had not given him have a chance to catch a breath yet.

“The Focus necklace is able to protect me from her Soul Impact once. Ding Yumian won’t know this... I have only one chance to win this battle!” Despite the position Mo Fan was in, his experience in battle kept him from losing his calm.

It was difficult to utilize all his Elements when fighting against Ding Yumian. Luckily, the Focus necklace which Dean Xiao had given him was able to resist a Psychic attack once.

It was Mo Fan’s greatest defense. He had to plan his attack carefully to win the duel with it. Otherwise, if he failed to inflict serious damage to Ding Yumian with the opportunity given by the Focus necklace, it was better for him to concede!

– I have no choice but to let the duel drag on, and wait until Ding Yumian begins to panic...The Swift Star Wolf can lift the burden off for the time being ...- thought Mo Fan.

The Swift Star Wolf was already injured from the burns, which severely impacted his speed.

However, the Swift Star Wolf was still able to provide assistance. After all, Ding Yumian’s Soul Impact was not so effective against him!

“Swift Star Wolf, keep her busy!” Mo Fanordered.

The Swift Star Wolf sprinted forward. He seemed fairly agitated after being burned, and was planning to get his revenge on Ding Yumian...

Ding Yumian remained calm facing the ferocious wolf. She suddenly closed her eyes and drew a Star Pattern rapidly under her feet.

“Spirit Ripple: Pacify!”

Ding Yumian’s eyes sprang open, her pupils clear like water, and a gentle ripple slowly spread into the eyes of the angry Swift Star Wolf.
