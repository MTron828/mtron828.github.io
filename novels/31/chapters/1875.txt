“Can you please explain to us how you are planning to evacuate the city? Not only is the city surrounded by the seawater, the streets are all submerged too!” Chu Mingxi of the Hongling Division spoke up.

Zhuang Hong placed a waterproof map on the table. “Take a look at this map. There are three main paths from Xiamen to the land: the three main bridges in Haicang, Xinglin, and Jimei. The three highways which these bridges are a part of branch off further inside the city. The Haicang Highway goes from the west to the east across Xiamen Island, while Xinglin and Jimei Highways go around the island from the north to the south...”

The map was huge. The highways on it were highlighted with an obvious green.

Mo Fan stuck his head closer to take a glance at it. He noticed the highways of the rapid transit route formed a horizontal route and two vertical routes across the city. The routes did not necessarily cover the whole city, but they reasonably covered most of the districts. Every street was at a reasonable distance from a bus rapid transit station.

“These three routes are our lifelines. We will move the civilians trapped in the buildings in different corners of the city onto the highways,” Zhuang Hong continued.

Mo Fan took a closer look. In other words, the civilians only needed to follow the highways to the three bridges. Once they crossed the bridges, they would reach safety once they reached the mainland.

“It seems like the authorities managed to keep their heads clear. I was wondering if we could use the highways to relocate the civilians too,” Lingling whispered into Mo Fan’s ear.

“Mm, those roads are the best choices we have. The rapid transit highways are over twenty meters high. The bridges are very sturdy, too. Normal sea monsters won’t be able to destroy them. If the routes remain clear, we should be able to evacuate the city in eight hours,” Mo Fan nodded.

“I’ve already assigned our men to stay in positions along the routes where the civilians will be escorted to the highways. Therefore, you must make sure the operation is a success by reporting to us the species, locations, and numbers of the sea monsters! You will have to clear the obstacles that show up on the three routes in time and eliminate the powerful sea monsters that might threaten any of the three lifelines!” Zhuang Hong finished sternly.

The South Wing Platoon, Hongling Division, and Qinling Division were clear about their mission. The three leaders – Mu Bai, Chu Mingxi, and Zhang Xiaohou – had serious faces now. They had now realized how difficult the mission was!

“We will handle the Haicang Route,” Chu Mingxi of the Hongling Division stated. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Then we’ll take the Xinglin Route,” Mu Bai declared on behalf of the South Wing Platoon.

“The Qinling Division will take the Jimei Route,” Zhang Xiaohou finished.

The three leaders confirmed the routes they were in charge of respectively and immediately proceeded to make the necessary arrangements. The three routes connected the mainland and Xiamen through the three main bridges, so they each covered a distance of more than ten kilometers. It was impossible to ensure the roads would be clear at all times without preparing in advance.

They could not afford to waste any more time. The three leaders immediately carried out their tasks.

“Hey, what about me?” Mo Fan was at a loss after everyone was dismissed. He did not necessarily represent any organizations, even though he had come with Mu Bai and Zhang Xiaohou, who had now received their orders. Mo Fan suddenly had no idea what he should be doing.

Zhuang Hong was putting the map away, and asked Shen Qing with a puzzled look, “Who is he?”

“A freelance Hunter, I think,” Shen Qing answered.

“If you want to help, you can go with Shen Qing. Her job is to rescue the civilians who are stranded in secluded areas...” Zhuang Hong did not know who Mo Fan was. He indifferently assigned Mo Fan to Shen Qing and left with his men.

Mo Fan stared at the others who had left in a hurry with a blank face.

“Green Tea, Houzi, you can ask me for help if you are in some kind of trouble,” Mo Fan yelled.

“Got it.”

“Sure, Brother Fan!”

The two were leaders of their troops. They could not bother wasting their time like Mo Fan.

Mo Fan looked at Lingling, who was just staring back at him.

“We have no clue where Jiang Shaoxu and Bai Hongfei are, either... forget it, they should be able to handle the sea monsters that have just invaded the city for now,” Mo Fan murmured.

“Why don’t you two come with me? We can rescue the civilians while collecting information about the sea monsters around the city. Someone has to gather the information and report to the authorities,” Shen Qing told Mo Fan.

“Wouldn’t it be overkill?” Mo Fan rubbed his temples. When he saw the others having a race with the God of Death, he too felt an urge to roll up his sleeves and contribute for the sake of the city. However, he felt his balls hurting when he heard Shen Qing’s arrangement. Wasn’t this like dispatching a general as a scout?

“Intel is more important than strength most of the time. Mo Fan, it’s not like we have anything else to do. We might as well follow Shen Qing around,” Lingling chided him.

Mo Fan hesitated for a moment.

Lingling added, “We will surely bump into some dangerous creatures roaming in the city. We can take them out if that happens.”

“A form of entrapment! Mmm, that’s not a bad idea!” Mo Fan gladly accepted it.

Shen Qing looked at Mo Fan. She could not help but wonder how her way of saying things was any different from the little girl’s version...

When they reached the main hall, the teenage girl named Fang Xiaoxue ran up to Shen Qing.

“My mother isn’t here. I’ve searched the whole building and asked the workers. She must be at home still. Sister, please help me save my mother. She...she’s blind, if no one helps her...” Fang Xiaoxue blurted out in tears.

Most of the residents nearby had been moved to the hotel, but there were still people out there who failed to gather at the hotel for different reasons.

“Where is your mother? Will she be at home?” Shen Qing asked patiently.

“Maybe, my home is in Tiancheng Garden,” Fang Xiaoxue said.

“I just received an order to gather everyone around SM City Xiamen to the Xinglin Route. Your home is very close to SM City Xiamen, but you will have to bring your mother to the plaza yourself so I can bring you both to safety,” Shen Qing said.

“Mm, I got it!” Fang Xiaoxue’s eyes flickered with hope.

Shen Qing glanced at Mo Fan. She was about to set off for the shopping center when she saw Mo Fan standing still.

“Aren’t you coming?”

“Does the shopping center you just said sell candles, whips... hey, Lingling, why did you step on my foot!?” Mo Fan yelled.

“It’s time to save some lives,” Lingling said expressionlessly.
