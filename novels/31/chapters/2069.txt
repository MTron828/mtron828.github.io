The gates of the Sacred City were open, and people were walking along the main street. It looked rather like old times, as there were no vehicles on it.

Countless people had gathered on the street, like a festival was going on. Everyone was staring at the sky in disbelief. There was an identical Sacred City mirrored up in the sky, a breathtaking sight. Their souls could not help but shiver in astonishment!

The mirrored Sacred City in the sky was exactly the same as the Sacred City on the ground. Someone had smashed a window on a building before the spell was cast, and the same window in the mirrored Sacred City was smashed, too!

However, the people of the Sacred City were not reflected. The mirrored Sacred City was empty.

The Sacred City on the ground was bustling with noise, but the mirrored Sacred City was silent. They were emitting the same lights in the dark, yet it felt like they were from two different worlds!

Mo Fan stood silently in the Sacred Residence as he watched the sudden changes take place. He kept staring at the sky, his heart pounding heavily!

Mo Fan had just witnessed the power of the Domain of Mirrored Space yesterday. They had defeated Euryale inside it!. When the battle ended, Mo Fan thought the Holy Judgment Court would punish them for destroying the streets. To his surprise, the streets were undamaged and crowded with people.

Bola told Mo Fan that they were fighting in the unique Domain of Mirrored Space in the Sacred City. It was able to create an illusionary area with the exact same appearance as their surroundings, so that innocent people would not be involved when the Judicators and Holy Court Mages were carrying out their missions.

The Chaos Element was capable of setting up a Domain of Mirrored Space, but Mo Fan had not mastered it. Therefore, Mo Fan was only a little surprised when he first saw it in action.

However, he did not expect the Angel who was about to disclose his identity to mirror the whole Sacred City and create an illusion of it like a mirage above them.

“Into the battlefield!”

“Into the battlefield!”

The order from the Angel Raphael echoed above the city.

Many Heresy Judgment Mages and Judicators were on standby in the city. They turned into rays of light and flew to the city in the sky after receiving the order!

The Mages of the Sacred City who had prepared for the battle fell onto the mirrored Sacred City like a rain of lights. The empty city soon had many Mages with stern Auras glowing stationed at every street corner.

There were hundreds of streets in the Sacred City. The people had no idea how many Mages were stationed across the city in the crowded streets, but when they all flew to the city in the sky, they realized the city was already on high alert!

The city was upside-down, and so were the people in it. However, the people within it felt like they were on normal ground. The place was no different from the Sacred City, yet they could still see the real Sacred City and the crowd above them.

Clear footsteps echoed out, followed by pleasant chimes, like the intro of a war song.

Mo Fan turned around and saw a Lesser Ki-Rin, sometimes called a dragon deer, emanating a crystalline light as it ran through the sky toward the mirrored Sacred City.

On the back of the ki-rin was a well-dressed woman. Her black dress covered the back of the dragon deer, drifting in the wind of the night sky. It was like seeing the Night Goddess on her way back to her palace on the moon.

Mo Fan only managed to get a quick glance at the dragon deer as it ran past him. He recognized the person on the back of the ki-rin was Qin Yu’er.

Her hands were bound by silver cuffs tied to the ki-rin’s horn. Powerful magic was flowing from the horn to Qin Yu’er’s wrists, prevent her from using her power. She could only sit on the dragon deer like a delicate sacrifice, ready to be offered on the altar in the mirrored city!

Mo Fan tried to chase after it, but the dragon deer was so quick that he did not have time to react at all. It quickly reached the stairs of the Sacred Residence in the mirrored Sacred City.

The entrance of the Sacred City was wide open to welcome their guest.

There was only one guest, yet the mages were preparing like they were about to face an army of millions!

“I am Michael.” A man with blond hair and a blond beard was standing on a simple tower. His voice spread across the city. “I am the Head Angel of the Sacred City!”

Michael’s beard was slightly unkempt, obviously the kind of person who did not care much about his image. No one would even remember his face among a crowd.

However, the moment he pronounced his kingly identity to the city, his looks, height, and skin tone were no longer important. He was the Head Angel of the Sacred City, a person who examined every country and organization like an envoy of God!

“I can’t convince you to agree with our decision today with perfect logic and beautiful words, but a hundred years or a thousand years from now, your descendants will surely remember tonight; the night when I, Michael the Seventh, eliminate the Undead Emperor who might possibly inherit the throne of the God of Darkness in the future. If we humans are no longer threatened and suppressed by the darkness a thousand years from now, I will have no regrets even if I have to fight to my death today.”

“Blessed be to God! Blessed be to God!” the Mages in the mirrored Sacred City yelled. Their high-spirited chants roused the people of the Sacred City.

People fought for their personal gains, reputation, and glory, but who had ever fought for the peace a hundred or a thousand years from now?

The Head Angel’s announcing his identity had lit the flames in every Mage’s heart.

They were not fighting the battle for the present or their future, but the future of their descendants. That was the significance of the battle tonight! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Mo Fan was still at the Sacred Residence, still disguised as another person.

The moment he saw Qin Yu’er, he had the urge to intercept the dragon deer and stop the battle from happening.

However, he could sense a pair of eyes staring at him as the thought crossed his mind.

The gaze was coming from the top of the mountain. They belonged to Chief Military Instructor Zhan Kong!

He had instantly suppressed Mo Fan’s ability to move with his powerful presence alone, and spoke to him in a muffled voice, “Michael is right. I’m slowly losing my memories, and my existence is slowly being erased. Even if I could still live for a few dozen years more, in a hundred years or a thousand, the ancient king will become a terrifying demon,” Zhan Kong told him.

“That’s something to worry about after a hundred or a thousand years!” Mo Fan replied urgently.

“I’m not willing to leave this world yet because someone is waiting for me. This battle is mine, I shall face it alone.”
