Exactly my ass!

Zu Xiangtian could not wait until the Vice Mayor declared the start of the duel. He wanted to trample Mo Fan over and over again, until he was no longer able to speak, after seeing this reaction.

The young Mages who came to watch the duel initially thought they were drinking a sip of harmless chicken soup for the soul, but they felt disgusted, as if they were being forced to drink a mouthful of wee!

Oh Heavens, why did such a shameless person exist?

Could Mo Fan be more shameless, calling himself the strongest Mage in the world?

The crowd was mainly split into three groups at first: those who were scolding Mo Fan, those who came to enjoy the duel, and those who were supporting Mo Fan. But now, Mo Fan’s supporters were dumbfounded by his speech, and the people who were scolding Mo Fan were angrier, now joined by those who only came to watch the duel!

Mo Fan stood in the limelight. He was relieved when he saw so many people were despising him.

It was reasonable to be scolded by people after what he had said, but he would just prove them all wrong with his strength, an indication of how confident he was!

Zu Xiangtian was just a nobody. He was going to defeat people who were a dozen times stronger than him!

“I know many of you don’t believe me.”

“(Cough cough), Mo Fan, thank you for such a motivational speech. Let us proceed with the duel. I believe everyone is looking forward to seeing how strong these two talented young men are,” the Vice Mayor quickly interrupted in case Mo Fan intended to say something even worse to stir up the crowd!

The Vice Mayor glared at Mo Fan after finishing.

Mo Fan responded with a helpless expression. It was you who asked me to say a few words. Why did you bother with such a meaningless step? Just focus on the real fight. Bring it on!

“Ready!” The Vice Mayor had no intention to talk to the leader of Fanxue Mountain. Seeing was indeed believing. He realized that Mo Fan was even more unreliable than the rumors had mentioned!

“There must be something wrong with your brain!” Zu Xiangtian went up to Mo Fan and performed the etiquette prior to a duel dishonestly.

The etiquette was more common in Italy. Italians had to perform the etiquette when they were being challenged to a duel, no matter how terrible the relationship between both sides was.

The seemingly noble and elegant etiquette, on top of the custom-tailored western battle outfit Zu Xiangtian was wearing, perfectly set off his appearance. Most people agreed he was a fine standard of an Eastern man.

On the other hand, Mo Fan was dressed normally. He was wearing a shirt when it was in the middle of winter. The top buttons were purposely undone. There was nothing wrong with the way he dressed, but he looked like a freshly dug-up relic compared to Zu Xiangtian’s rich attire.

“The last person who fought me in a duel was as annoying as you. I believe the weeds on his grave should be around your height by now,” Mo Fan replied carelessly.

“I think it’s meaningless to be talking to you, as you will be seeing a psychiatrist after the duel, but I don’t think it’s going to make any difference. I will become your worst fear for the rest of your life. I’m going to trample your arrogance and pride today!” Zu Xiangtian proclaimed.

“Can I ask you something?” Mo Fan said.

Zu Xiangtian was about to make his move when Mo Fan interrupted with a stern tone. He suddenly had no idea what to do.

“Just hurry up. Stop wasting my time!” Zu Xiangtian said impatiently.

“Did you hire people to impersonate me and do those shameless acts?” Mo Fan asked directly.

Zu Xiangtian was amused. There was indeed something wrong with this idiot’s brain!

“So what if I did? However, I feel like it’s unnecessary for me to help you enrage the crowd. The things you said just then are more effective than what I did!” Zu Xiangtian did not mind admitting to what he had done.

“As long as you admit it... by the way, during the night when the Sacred City was involved in a battle, did you feel uncomfortable after you woke up? I heard from a friend who wants to remain anonymous that you were having trouble walking properly?” Mo Fan asked.

Zu Xiangtian’s face almost ruptured like his anus had back then!

“You won’t walk away alive today!” Zu Xiangtian declared coldly.

Mo Fan just grinned.

Zu Xiangtian felt like his lungs were about to explode. He charged at Mo Fan like a madman, his body beginning to emit a blood-red glow like a demon creature. The light took the shape of a red demon bull with horns over seven meters long!

BANG!

Zu Xiangtian rammed into Mo Fan with the Blood Bull Armor. The water under his feet evaporated instantly, revealing the true colors of the Floating Reefs Battleground!

Mo Fan moved rapidly over the reef. He had no idea what kind of ability Zu Xiangtian was using, charging at Mo Fan like he was possessed by a demon bull. His speed and strength were comparable to a Ruler-level creature. Mo Fan soon lost his chances to use Blink. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Mo Fan had relocated twice with Blink, but Zu Xiangtian quickly caught up to him again. Mo Fan only saw a huge red flicker before Zu Xiangtian, who was emitting a scorching aura, appeared in front of him and rammed him with his head. The overwhelming force instantly sent him flying.

Mo Fan went from the Floating Reefs Battleground into a nearby building. The building collapsed instantly from the impact.

The crowd stared at Zu Xiangtian, who had suddenly displayed his remarkable prowess, with wide eyes. They did not understand what kind of ability he had just used, but they could feel his formidable strength from a great distance away. He was like an unstoppable bull in a bullfight. The petty fences separating the fight from the crowd might not withstand a single blow from him.

“Was he only boasting about his strength? He was already sent flying in the first round.”

“Zu Xiangtian’s ability feels like he’s Possessed by a Ruler-level creature!”

Zu Xiangtian had impressed the crowd with his first move. Even the Councilmen of the Magic Association could not do what he did. He was truly the brightest talent of the Zu Clan!

On the other hand, Mo Fan knocked the debris on himself away and patted the dust off his shirt.

His hair was a little disheveled, but he did not look injured. However, his image had definitely taken a huge blow!
