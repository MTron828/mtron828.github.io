Mo Fan was immediately sent to receive treatment after he returned to the stage.

The poison was shocking; half of Mo Fan’s body had turned dark blue. Han Ji personally helped treat Mo Fan’s injuries. It took him quite some time just to drive the poison out of the young man’s body!

After getting rid of the poison, Han Ji proceeded to reattach Mo Fan’s arm. Han Ji’s Healing Magic was impressive, indeed! Mo Fan’s arm was back to normal in no time...

Normally, if a person’s arm was severed, as long as the person was able to retrieve the severed limb and reattach it back to their body with the Healing Element, the person would recover quite speedily. However, if the arm was smashed into pulp, the Healer would have to regenerate the cells and tissues, meaning that the process would take a longer time, and the injured would have to spend months recovering!

——

“So you’re saying that was the place where the grand treasure of the treasure hunt was hidden thirty-two years ago?” Mo Fan asked Han Ji with wide eyes.

“Yes. No one had expected your team would go there,” Han Ji wrapped the cut on Mo Fan’s arm with a golden-blue bandage, warning Mo Fan not to do any vigorous exercise for the next two days.

“Damn it, that Swedish idiot almost set us up!” Mo Fan cursed instantly.

They should not have believed the cunning, plump man in the first place. They almost lost their lives down there, and Mu Ningxue was forced to use the Ice Crystal Bow. She would be weak for quite some time, and they were unsure if it would affect the upcoming matches. Mu Ningxue had waited for a long time to make a name in the World College Tournament!

“It’s such a pity, if only you guys could have retrieved the treasure, too. If I’m not mistaken, it should be a Stone of Will, a unique stone that can significantly increase the mental strength of a Mage, and is extremely useful for anyone with the Psychic, Curse, or Space Elements,” Han Ji sighed.

“A Stone of Will... is it valuable?” Mo Fan asked.

“It used to be, back in the days. They found an ore vein full of Stones of Will in Iceland. These Stones of Will used to be available everywhere across the world, so there were quite a lot of outstanding Space Mages and Psychic Mages during that time. These Mages were able to achieve greatness with the Stones of Will, but eventually, the vein was mined out. Many Hunters tried finding another ore vein, but they could not, even until today. As a result, these Stones of Will are as valuable as antiques in the current era...” Han Ji said.

Mo Fan saw Han Ji recalling the glory of the past. He took out the box with a bloody handprint on it. He opened the box and showed it to Han Ji, “Is this the stone you’re referring to?”

Han Ji took a quick glance and nodded subconsciously. The Stones of Will were fairly unique, limpid with a silver glow, and had runes like the orbits of stars on the surface.

Han Ji soon realized something. His eyes widened as he blurted out, “You...you found it!” He was so loud that he gave Mo Fan a fright.

“I happened to stumble upon it. I think Kelly and his group found it, but they did not make it out. I found it, so I just brought it along. I didn’t expect it to be the grand treasure from thirty-two years ago!” Mo Fan was overjoyed.

A stone able to improve a Mage’s mental strength; wasn’t it something that he was searching for desperately? He needed a huge upgrade to his Space Element. Otherwise, his Space Element was pretty much useless in a battle. With this Stone of Will, his Space Element would soon be able to shine, too!

“This is great! Well done! You have always been bold yet scrupulous... it’s really a great item!” Han Ji burst out laughing.

It seemed like Mo Fan did not suffer his injuries for nothing. He had brought back the old grand treasure that was easily more valuable than the grand treasure prepared for this treasure hunt. Han Ji believed that if the Stone of Will was auctioned, it would surely be sold for a higher price than the highest-quality Soul-grade Seeds out there!

“Tell me how I should use it, hehe! It better help me improve greatly within a short period. That way, I’ll be more confident in the finals!” Mo Fan smiled.

“The Space Element is classified into nine levels. The first, second, and third levels are referred to as the basic stage. Your control of your Space Element is currently in the second level, so it’s pretty much in the middle of the basic stage. It will allow you to move objects lighter than ten tons, and you can also form a wall, or knock enemies back with your will. However, you know that you’re still quite a distance away from reaching Ai Jiangtu’s level,” Han Ji said patiently.

“Ugh... I never learned the details of the Space Element. I basically feel my way around it,” Mo Fan admitted awkwardly.

“Ai Jiangtu is currently in the intermediate stage, I’m guessing that he has achieved the fourth level, but the difference between the two stages is immeasurably huge. In your case, the Space Element can mostly provide you with some support when fighting against Advanced Mages. However, once you’ve reached the intermediate stage, if you gather all your focus and expend energy equivalent to casting an Advanced Spell, your Telekinesis can deal the same damage as an Advanced Spell. You can even move a mountain and slam it down at your enemy,” Han Ji informed him.

“No wonder! I have always wondered why both Ai Jiangtu and I were casting the same Basic and Intermediate Spells, yet the effects of the spells differed by so much. It turned out that the Space Element has its own levels,” Mo Fan realized.

“Any magic that is closely related to a Mage’s mental strength is the same. After all, there are no Seeds for the Space, Psychic, and Curse Elements, and their potency solely depends on the Mage’s mental strength. It has nothing to do with the Star Patterns or Star Constellations. Therefore, as long as your mental strength keeps growing, it’s going to strengthen your will too, meaning that you can endure attacks directed at your mind better. For example, if your mental strength has reached the intermediate stage, a Psychic Mage in the basic stage is unlikely going to be able to affect you with their Psychic Spells,” Han Ji informed him.

Mo Fan’s eyes flickered upon hearing Han Ji’s explanation.

He never thought the improvement of his mental strength could also improve his resistance to the Psychic Element. It was definitely a piece of good news!

Currently, Mo Fan’s greatest weakness was a Psychic Mage, as they could easily prevent him from casting his destructive spells. If it was as Han Ji had mentioned, there was no need for him to be afraid of Psychic Mages as long as his mental strength was higher. He still stood a chance, even if he stumbled into a powerful Psychic Mage!

“So this Stone of Will...” Mo Fan looked at the silver stone. He was fondling the stone admiringly, as if it were his own son.

“Just place it somewhere close when you’re meditating. It will emit a glow similar to Magic Equipment specifically used to strengthen a person’s soul, to improve your mental strength. It doesn’t take long, either, so I’m sure that your mental strength will improve dramatically before the finals!” Han Ji said.

Han Ji was looking forward to seeing the result, too. When he first met Mo Fan in the Ancient Capital, the young man already stood out among the Mages of his age. Now he had achieved the Advanced Level, granting him access to six Elements! His Fire, Lightning, and Summoning Elements had been very impressive throughout the tournament, and if his Space Element could also improve dramatically, he was surely going to enter the limelight during the finals and shock the world!

—

Han Ji’s explanation clarified the details of the Space Element to Mo Fan.

Han Ji was right. Mo Fan’s mental strength was currently at the second level. It did improve significantly when Mo Fan was fighting against Jack’s scorpion beast, but it did not break through straightaway. It was currently between the second and third levels.

The Stone of Will was a rare item, containing overwhelming energy. Mo Fan could not wait to go into seclusion and start meditating.

However, before that, Mo Fan had to split the loot first.

If it was someone else, Mo Fan would obviously not mention the Stone of Will and claim possession secretly. There was nothing to be ashamed about, yet Mo Fan was well aware of how shameless he was!

However, Mo Fan was not so stingy when it came to Mu Ningxue and Ayleen.

The two had used all they had just so the group could make it out alive, especially Mu Ningxue, who was still in a weak and feeble state. Mo Fan was extremely worried that she would not recover before the next round of the tournament...

Mo Fan desperately needed the Stone of Will, so it was obvious that he would be taking it. Apart from that, the loot they had robbed from the other teams, together with the Soul-grade Seed they had acquired from Meos and her group, summed up to a total value of more than two billion.

Ayleen and Mu Ningxue split the profit in a ratio of four to six. What they took was comparable to the value of the Stone of Will that Mo Fan had claimed.

As for Tony, who was also on the team...

That son of a b**ch, Mo Fan was merciful enough that he did not skin the plump man alive, just to maintain the Chinese team’s image, let alone split the loot with him!

Tony of the Swedish team felt wronged. He did admit that his misinformation almost cost everyone’s life, but he was still heartbroken when he did not earn any profit after what he had gone through, yet there was nothing he could say.

Ayleen was quite embarrassed to take so much profit. She ended up giving two hundred million back to Mo Fan in order to stick to the promise she gave, that she would only be taking two-tenths of the spoils.

Mo Fan gladly accepted the money. He paid off the debt he owed to Pang Lai, and used the leftover to buy some snacks for Little Flame Belle and the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. The resources would slowly improve their attributes, preparing them for their next evolution in advance.

Even though Mo Fan was not left with many resources in the end, he was still quite satisfied with the outcome...

Both the surprise that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf had given him, and the chance to strengthen his Space Element had given Mo Fan the confidence that he could easily dominate the tournament with only four of his Elements!

He would have struggled to take on a Commander-level creature before, but he could easily take on two or three at the same time now!
