The first Dark Beast that was eager to make a big impression sprang forward. Its long claws emitted an icy flicker in the cold rain, while hooks sharp enough to sever a human’s arteries was hidden under the sharp claws!

Mo Fan remained stationary, while Liu Ru suddenly appeared in front of him.

Liu Ru had also clenched her hands into claws and waved them in the air. Five deep glowing slashes the color of blood swept forward, tearing the impatient Dark Beast into a few segments...

The Dark Beast was still in the air when its body split into several pieces, falling before Liu Ru’s feet. Its filthy blood and organs splattered across the ground!

“Go, all of you!” yelled one of the Black Clergy.

The commands from Black Clergy were infused with a curse. The Dark Beasts who were unwilling to obey them would suffer an enormous pain inflicted on their soul.

Black shadows moved rapidly in the surrounding area. The Dark Beasts who preferred to attack their targets sneakily would make use of the opportunities given to them through the sacrifices of their comrades.

Their speed was like leopards to humans. Both their movements or attacks were too fast for humans to react, but Liu Ru’s agility significantly surpassed that of these Dark Beasts. To her, these Dark Beasts were like mechanical puppets. Not only was their speed when jumping, crawling, pouncing, and scratching extremely slow and stiff, but their approaches when attacking were also too predictable, with similar patterns!

Each time they were going to attack, they would first jump from one spot to another, before pouncing on their target.

Liu Ru easily predicted their movements as they were crawling and leaping. She simply killed each of the creatures instantly before they could do inflict a single scratch!

The Dark Beasts were completely useless despite their numbers. Liu Ru had easily killed a dozen of them with ease.

Suddenly, a quick shadow swept by and appeared when Liu Ru was distracted by four Dark Beasts flanking her from different directions!

The shadow was followed by a Curse Mark, which emitted an evil glow as the figure swept past like a flash of lightning. The mark further increased the creature’s speed.

Liu Ru was unable to dodge in time. Her pale neck was sliced open with a deep cut. Some girl among the villagers immediately screamed.

The woman in the mink coat said to someone beside her with a hollow laugh, “It seems like you can only enjoy her without her body temperature...”

However, the words were still lingering when she shockingly discovered that the girl whose throat was sliced open suddenly exerted great might, grabbing the ankle of the Cursed Beast that ambushed her.

Liu Ru totally ignored the wound on her throat. She grabbed the Cursed Beast in mid-air and slammed it down on the cement road.

The road was cratered. Half of the Cursed Beast’s skull was broken, and brains flowed out.

The Cursed Beast was as tough as a cockroach. It was still alive even after its skull was blown open. However, Liu Ru did not give the cunning creature any chance to escape. A crescent saber made of blood appeared in her hand, and she swung it at the Cursed Beast’s neck!

The blood saber immediately beheaded the Cursed Beast, and Liu Ru kicked the head away like a soccer ball, hitting another Cursed Beast that was planning to attack her.

Following her actions, the cut on Liu Ru’s throat had already healed magically. Not a single drop of blood was seen, and on top of that, the skin was as white and tender as it was before!

The other few Black Clergy were dumbfounded. They had never seen a woman whose throat was sliced open fight like her! Besides, the woman was not even using Magic! Her blood claws, strength, crescent saber, and wind lashes were some impossible power that did not belong to a human!

“Blood...Blood Tribe!” The deacon was fairly knowledgeable. She immediately deduced Liu Ru’s identity, and her eyes widened as she snapped, “Don’t just stand there, attack and kill them at once!”

The Dark Beasts were simply a bunch of flies and mosquitoes harassing a fierce tiger. There was no way they could harm her, so it was only a matter of time until Liu Ru wiped them all out. The Cursed Beasts were the real threats. If Liu Ru was a tiger, those Cursed Beasts would be fierce wolves.

Liu Ru was already aware of the Cursed Beast that had tried to ambush her. She had purposely exposed an opening so that she could eliminate one of the Cursed Beasts!

“Why do I feel like you’ve grown stronger again?” Mo Fan was astounded when he saw Liu Ru killing a Warrior-level Cursed Beast instantly.

“Mm, your blood is rather special. It can help me evolve every once in a while. In order to guarantee the purity of my blood and strength, I decide to only drink your blood...” replied Liu Ru.

“The right milk formula, the kind that you can drink without worrying?” blurted out Mo Fan.

Liu Ru did not have a chance to respond to Mo Fan’s remark, as the other six Cursed Beasts attacked her simultaneously. They were indeed cunning, as they intentionally hid their Cursed marks so they would look the same as ordinary Dark Beasts. They would only trigger the power of the Curses when they were attacking!

“Little Flame Belle, come out and help your Aunt Liu,” said Mo Fan, casting the Contract Summoning.

As he thought, he was only halfway through drawing the Star Pattern when little Flame Belle came out from the Contracted Space on her own. Mo Fan had already anticipated it, thus he simply interrupted the channeling when the fifth Star Orbit was completed. Otherwise, the others would think that he was an unqualified Summoner!

Little Flame Belle hopped out of the Contracted Space with high anticipation, just so she could see the speechless expression on Mo Fan’s face. Unfortunately, Mo Fan was too smart to be tricked. She immediately puffed her cheeks, her eyes saying, “I am very not happy!”

However, little Flame Belle was a very obedient kid, after all. She was only angry for a brief while, as she knew that the bad guys had made her father not happy too... like, extremely not happy!

“Don’t show any mercy,” Mo Fan said to the little Flame Belle.

Little Flame Belle was basically an evil demoness. As soon as she heard the restriction was lifted, the Calamity Fire in the form of fiery storms immediately swept through the surroundings, devouring the restless Dark Beasts within ten meters.

Liu Ru was killing the creatures one after another elegantly, allowing her to perfectly preserve her strength.

Meanwhile, little Flame Belle was being completely unreasonable. She simply had the urge to fully unleash all the flames inside her body, producing a destructive festival of fire similar to the Fire Calamity!

Luckily, Liu Ru had already experienced this before. She immediately leapt into the air when she saw little Flame Belle preparing her attack, just so she was high enough to avoid the flames.

The little Flame Belle had never turned off her friendly fire mode!
