“Ling!~”

Little Flame Belle snuck out of the Contracted Space after waking up from sleep while Mo Fan and Xinxia were having a heavy conversation. She flew straight into Xinxia’s gentle arms instead of staying on Mo Fan’s spacious shoulders.

Xinxia giggled when she saw the adorable little creature.

Xinxia and Little Flame Belle shared the same heart, so they were as close as mother and daughter.

As a matter of fact, the reason Mo Fan did not dare to accept Asha’ruiya’s offer the other night was because he was worried that Little Flame Belle might tell her mother about it!

Any way he looked at it, he had to make sure he was out of the range of their telepathy before doing anything mischievous. He definitely could not do anything in the Citadel of Athens!

The tension eased after Little Flame Belle showed up. Mo Fan pushed Xinxia’s wheelchair into the woods on the sacred mountain. He was purposely heading toward a remote corner.

“(Cough cough) Time for kids to go to bed,” Mo Fan noticed the environment was perfect. There was the moon, the lights in the distance, and enough cover and shadows in the area.

Little Flame Belle had a displeased look. The sun had only set less than an hour ago!

“Off you go. If you don’t sleep now, I won’t be giving you any snacks,” Mo Fan said.

Little Flame Belle knew she had to stick to Mo Fan most of the time as he had full control over the supply of her snacks. She had no choice but to go back to her Contracted Space unwillingly.

“Little Flame Belle’s flames don’t seem to be stable,” Xinxia told Mo Fan, having noticed something.

“Mm, she must be close to evolving, but I’m not sure why she has stayed like this for such a long time. She has yet to evolve fully,” Mo Fan agreed.

Mo Fan clearly remembered that whenever Little Flame Belle had a ‘fever’, meaning that her temperature was unstable, she was on the verge of evolving into the next stage. It had been the same when she went from the Infant Stage to her Youth Stage, then from the Youth Stage to the Adolescent Stage.

However, it had been almost half a year since she started having trouble controlling her temperature, yet she still had not evolved into a Flame Belle Empress.

She would evolve into a Flame Belle Empress in her next stage. Little Flame Belle had transformed into a Flame Belle Empress temporarily under the influence of the Time Liquid, defeating thousands of Nazca Monster Birds back then. Mo Fan would never forget how unstoppable she was!

The Flame Belle’s true form was her Mature Phase. She was so strong that he had an urge to drop to his knees and worship her!

“Brother Mo Fan, why don’t you let Little Flame Belle stay with me for some time?” Xinxia asked.

“Ah?” Mo Fan was taken by surprise.

“Little Flame Belle’s condition isn’t necessarily a good thing. If she is stuck in it for too long, it might affect her growth. Brother Mo Fan, being a candidate for the role of the Goddess isn’t entirely a bad thing. I have a lot of resources that ordinary Mages and factions would struggle to get their hands on,” Xinxia said.

“Oh Xinxia, you’re corrupted too...” Despite what Mo Fan said, he still raised his brows excitedly, as if that was exactly what he was hoping to hear.

His Lightning Element was at the Super Level, and it was the same with his Shadow Element. Although his Fire Element had always been his greatest fallback, it was indeed necessary to deal with Little Flame Belle’s strange condition first.

Besides, he usually did not have the time to supervise Little Flame Belle’s cultivation. He could just leave Little Flame Belle at the Parthenon Temple for a while and let Xinxia discipline the lazy bum. Perhaps she would already be a Flame Belle Empress when he came to take her back next time!

Mo Fan felt a surge of excitement inside when he recalled the power he could feel when the Flame Belle Empress Possessed him.

Mo Fan had defeated a Dark Swordmaster when he was Possessed by the Flame Belle Empress in Egypt. He was only an Advanced Mage back then!

“By the way, I brought the fruit of the Tree of Vows for you. This thing is a rare valuable of the Blessing Element. I thought it might come in handy for you, so I’ve been saving it until now,” Mo Fan finally remembered.

The Parthenon Temple might have plenty of resources, but they would not have the fruit of the Tree of Vows! Mo Fan had purposely kept it so Xinxia could grow stronger too!.

“Brother Mo Fan, that is something that the Tree of Vows has given you. It’s dedicated to you, similar to the Blessing of the God’s Seal. I can’t use it,” Xinxia shook her head.

“Ah? I thought I could give you a little surprise,” Mo Fan scratched his head awkwardly.

They arrived at a remote corner. The time when hormones were easily stimulated had arrived too. There was no sign of other people around. Most importantly, the annoying Tata was not around! Mo Fan initially planned to give Xinxia a little present to make her happy so he could conveniently place his hand on the butterfly knot on the back of her dress and undo it, allowing his hand to slip into her smooth waist and make its way toward her butt easily.

To his surprise, he already failed to carry out the first step. His hand froze in the air, defeated.

The fruit of the Tree of Vows was exclusive to him?

He should have consumed it right away! The others had obtained great benefits from it, especially the Feathers of the Wind Spirits that Zhang Xiaohou had acquired. They were insanely strong!

“Xinxia, don’t you think the moon is beautiful tonight?” Mo Fan suddenly changed the topic.

“The moon hasn’t shown up... Brother Mo Fan!” Xinxia immediately noticed a scorching hand slipping into an embarrassing spot before Xinxia could finish. She instantly blushed, “We are still outside...”

“That Tata is going to show up again once we go back,” Mo Fan said.

“But a place like this...” Xinxia blushed even further. Who the heck would even want to do it here? Anyone might visit the woods on the Mountain of the Goddess at any time. What if a few probationary servants stumbled into them as they came to take a stroll? How could she possibly stay in the Parthenon Temple any longer?

“It’s fine, I’ll set up a Realm of Shadow. No one is going to come. I’m just going to caress you a little,” Mo Fan said. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Caress her a little?

As if Xinxia had no idea what kind of a person Mo Fan was. There was no way he was going to stop at just caressing!

Mo Fan had a stern face, like he was in deep thought when they started going for a walk. She actually thought something was troubling him, yet he was having dirty thoughts all along! The problem was, to do it in a place like this... she could still see the mountain opposite the woods. The bushes of flowers were right beside them. There was also a comfortable bench nearby!

Mo Fan could not care less about all that.

Troubling thoughts? Little surprise? The woods on the Mountain of the Goddess?

So what if they were on a sacred mountain, everywhere could be a thrilling deserted garden as long as they were bold enough!

Xinxia was unable to walk. Her legs would lose their strength after taking a few steps, yet they were not much of a nuisance when carrying out certain activities.

They had always done it on a bed. They were too embarrassed to make it work before, but the environment here was perfect for them. They might even unlock some new postures...

“You don’t have to take it all off. Just roll it down to your knees. Like this, yeah, and face the other way. Sit on me slowly... I’ll carry you...” an evil voice instigated gently.
