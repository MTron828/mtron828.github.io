3003 Buried Seed

It was only dusk, but Izisha already felt tired and sleepy. She got up from the recliner and saw a girl hurrying by while holding a big urn.

“Is this the cremains you cleaned?” Izisha stopped the girl.

The girl was afraid of Izisha. She did not dare to raise her head and speak. She just nodded and hid her hand that was cut while cleaning those broken urns behind her.

Izisha had already seen it. “Give it to me.”

The girl nervously handed the urn containing all the cremains to Izisha.

“Put that down and give me your hand,” Izisha ordered.

The girl did as she was told. When she extended her hand, she still dared not raise her head for fear that Izisha would scold her.

Izisha often lectured people, including Great Sages and female believers like them.

Suddenly, the female believer’s cut palm and finger felt warm. She secretly glanced at her palm and was surprised to find that Izisha’s hand was covering it. Izisha’s hand transmitted a warm light which healed the wound of the female believer.

The female believer opened her mouth wide in surprise. ‘Izisha healed me! Even the Combat Knights don’t have this honor!’

“Is there any place with a better view suitable for burying this urn?” Izisha pointed to the urn of cremains on the ground.

“There is a quieter place behind El Mountain Spring to the east,” said the female believer bravely without fear.

“Got it.” Izisha nodded. She picked up the funerary urn and walked toward the east. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The female believer was puzzled.

She did not know what Izisha was going to do. Moreover, word of the funerary urn incident had already spread in Saintess’ Hall two hours earlier. The female believers, who were here to serve members of Goddess Peak, were also aware that these were the cremains of some of Izisha’s relatives, friends, and subordinates.

...

El Mountain Spring was in a relatively remote location on Goddess Peak. Goddess Peak was large, and a part of it had a virgin forest. When Izisha was in charge of the Parthenon Temple, she often buried some female attendants of Goddess Peak who opposed her on a mountain in Goddess Peak.

Every Greek regarded the magnificent and sacred Parthenon Temple as a holy place and a paradise on Earth. Izisha, however, viewed it as a luxurious cemetery. All those who died in the Parthenon Temple battle were buried there.

Izisha arrived at El Mountain Spring and saw a person loitering near it.

There were very few men who could step into Goddess Peak. At least in the past, Izisha prohibited all men from entering Goddess Peak except Combat Knights of the Hall of Knights. However, Ye Xinxia gradually changed the rule, making it less strict.

“I’m sorry. I seem to have lost my way. This place is huge, and I lost my way while strolling around. Do you know how to get to Saintess’ Hall?” The middle-aged man looked very ordinary, and his clothes were extremely plain. He smiled gently, which made him look like a person with a particularly optimistic attitude.

“Ma’am?” It was the first time Izisha heard someone address her in such a way.

This was Greece, and they were at Goddess Peak of Parthenon Temple, yet there was someone who did not know her?

“This is the first time I’ve been here, and I came to visit my daughter. I heard that there are many rules here, so please forgive me if I said something wrong.” The middle-aged man scratched his head. His dark brown eyes made him look innocent.

“You have said nothing wrong so far. If you walk in the direction I came from, you’ll reach Saintess’ Hall.” Izisha deliberately stared into his eyes for a second. She was a Psychic Mage, so it was difficult for someone with a low cultivation level to deceive her.

“I got it. Thank you. The scenery here is so pretty. It’s the first time I’ve seen such a fairy-like place. However, I’m a bit bored since my daughter is very busy. I don’t want to disturb her, so I can only go out and wander around. I can’t even talk to anyone,” said the middle-aged man.

“You’re indeed very talkative,” said Izisha.

“Hahaha, I admit it. I think I’m talkative too. If you find me noisy, I can stop talking. Why are you carrying a jar? Are you here to get some spring water? Do you need my help?” The middle-aged man smiled.

“This is an urn. You can help me bury it. I don’t want to get my hands dirty.” Izisha glanced at the soil around her. It was all soil formed from decaying leaves. Ever since she had been cursed, she had developed a fear of soil.

“Sure, but why do you want to bury it? Are there pickled mustard greens inside?”

“There are cremains inside,” Izisha said coldly.

“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t know that your relative passed away. Why is your relative… so heavy?” When the middle-aged man took it, he almost dropped it.

Izisha did not answer. The middle-aged man kept quiet. He found a place with dry soil and quickly dug a hole.

“We do the same in our hometown. When our loved ones pass away, we put them in a small box and bury them in the mountains or near rivers to symbolize their passage back to their homeland. All dead people have to be buried, so you don’t have to be sad. Sometimes living in the world is like entering a casino. The rules, benefits, and various things of the casino attract us to bet and fight for chips. It’s always in our heads that we should stop gambling and live a quiet and comfortable life in the countryside, but it’s only when we die that we can do so,” said the middle-aged man.

He shoveled away the soft soil with a branch. His movements were swift, as if he often did similar things. Izisha stood at the side and watched calmly.

It was true that the cremains of people Izisha was familiar with were here in the mountains. Though she only felt anger and barely any sadness, she felt a little emotional listening to this man’s nonsense.

Their faces appeared in front of Izisha. Many of them had tried their best to please Izisha, and she often felt disgusted. However, they might have really thought of her as an important person.

“Please go and pick a fruit.” The middle-aged man had a lot of dirt on his hands, but he did not seem to mind it.

“Fruit?” Izisha asked in confusion.

“At the core of fruit is a seed. Instead of burying the jar, why not scatter the cremains here and plant a seed? There’s also a spring next to it. A good thing to do instead of mourning for a loved one and watching the cold tombstone weeping is to watch a new sprout grow, blossom, bear fruit, and become a towering tree. In this way, you won’t feel that they have left you. When you’re in pain, you can lie quietly under the tree, and feel guarded by them, and your heart will find peace,” said the middle-aged man.
