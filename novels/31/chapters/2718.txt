Chapter 2719: Something Scarier

The stamens flew around. There were thorns on the stamens and the poison on them had a paralytic effect.

“I can’t lift my arms,” said Big Sister Ying anxiously.

If she could not swing her arm to cast a Fiery Fist, how was she going to attack her target?

Shu Xiaohua went to help her but the worm-like rhizomes entangled on her feet. There were very small thorns on the ends of the rhizomes. They were invisible to the naked eye, but when they came into contact with human skin, they could pierce into human flesh as easily as a mosquito.

Shu Xiaohua did not notice it. Her ankle only felt a little itchy. The itchiness turned to numbness after a while. Her legs felt as though there were a million ants biting on it. She felt little pin-pricks all over and was horrified to find out that he couldn’t move her legs.

“They have paralytic poison. Don’t let them pierce your skin!!” Shu Xiaohua warned.

The warning came a little too late. Most of them were already paralyzed. They fought slower than before, and Sea Anemone Dandelions rushed in.

“Be careful!” Big Sister Ying screamed.

A Sea Anemone Dandelion Demon came out of the soil and bit Pu Ling on her thigh. A part of the flesh fell off and her bones were almost broken. Her leg seemed as though it was barely held together by what remained of her skin.

Pu Ling almost fainted because of the pain. Her face became as pale as a paper.

“Please help!” Du Mei cried out to Mo Fan. She thought that as a Seven-star Hunter mage, it won’t be difficult for him to get rid of these demons.

Pu Ling was dying. If he didn’t do something, everyone here would die painfully.

But Mo Fan appeared indifferent. He was being vigilant towards another powerful creature which was much more dangerous than what they had encountered so far.

Du Mei mistook his wariness for fear. “Liar! He is a liar! He has no ability to protect us all. He lied to us!” shouted Du Mei angrily.

Mo Fan did not help them even then.Big Sister Ying could only move one of her arms. She had tried to buy Pu Ling some more time for her to escape and in the process, had gotten injured. But her effort had bought Le Nan enough time to draw a Three-level Star Constellation.

“Seven-Color Water Curtain!” The Seven-Color Water Curtain passed by like neon light. It shrouded and protected Du Mei, Shu Xiaohua, Big Sister Ying, Pu Ling, and several other female Mages. It had been a close call!

Big Sister Ying, who was the most powerful in combat, had her arms paralyzed. Shu Xiaohua could not move her lower body. Du Mei’s cultivation was not as high, and Pu Ling was severely injured. If the four of them did not get any help, the Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons that had trapped them would be able to kill them all in the next second.

Du Mei was furious. She saw that the b*stard wasn’t making a move at all. The one who saved them was Le Nan, who had done so at the risk of her own death.

“Why did you hire this male hunter? He is useless! If we die here, it will be your fault!” shouted Du Mei.

When they had fought in the Fengyi Centipede Herb Forest, Du Mei had been injured because of Mo Fan’s slow action. She had doubted him from that moment on. She was now certain that this man had lied. He did not possess the strength and power of a Seven-star Hunter Mage.

“Are you all okay?” asked Le Nan panting with the effort of having cast her magic.

“Pu Ling has lost too much blood,” Big Sister Ying said worriedly. “She is unconscious.”

“We are too tied up to nurse her right now.”

“Will she die?”

“No one will die. Hang in there!” Le Nan tried to encourage the others.

“You can’t hold on for too long with your Water Curtain Barrier. Big Sister Ruan is injured as well.”

Outside the Seven-Color Water Curtain Barrier, the fangs of Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons were ferocious and terrifying. The worm-like rhizomes under them squirmed. They sprayed a corrosive venom toward the Water Curtain Barrier!

They usually used this venom to degrade corpses so that the dead could be used as nourishment. It was very corrosive. It could even corrode through many magical protections.

There were a lot of Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons. Several demons sprayed the venom and the Seven-Color Water Curtain Barrier dissolved.

Le Nan was dumbfounded. She had not prepared for this. She had at least expected to buy some time till the other girls could remove the poison from their bodies. She had not known that these Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons had so many abilities.

Were these Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons really Warlord-level? While their combat power and physical strength were not at Commander-level, they had so many other abilities and methods that clearly exceeded the Warlord-level!

Le Nan looked at Mo Fan pleadingly, hoping he would finally do something. But Mo Fan still stared in the opposite direction.

Le Nan bit her lip in frustration. The Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons had already entered the barrier. They had exhausted their magical skills and abilities. This time, it really felt like they would die…. ‘Are we really that weak?’ wondered Le Nan miserably.

After leaving Licheng Afterglow Island and Northguard Fortress, they had come here only to be food for the demons.

“Why did they stop moving?” Shu Xiaohua suddenly asked.

Le Nan also noticed that Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons did not pounce on them. They looked like they were wary, too. Something more dangerous was nearby.

Suddenly, the Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons twisted their fangs and moved worm-like rhizomes and left. They slowly retreated.

The Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons had torn their barrier and injured them severely. They were about to devour them. So, what happened? This was unbelievable!

It did not take long for the Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons to retreat outside the giant reed bushes. The noises subsided as they retreated further.

Their crisis was over. The girls of Licheng Afterglow Island felt disbelief and relief as they looked at the now empty sinkhole.

“Are we safe?” Big Sister Ying asked in confusion.

“Don’t let your guard down!” Big Sister Ruan said sharply in everyone’s mind.

Big Sister Ruan never used that sharp tone of voice if it wasn’t urgent. Could it be that something scarier was approaching them? The girls were confused.

Those Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons had fled because they had sensed something far more dangerous.

What could scare away so many Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons with just its aura?
