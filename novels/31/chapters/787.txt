“Mochizuki Chihaya conceded!” Fujikata Tegami rose to her feet and glanced at Mochizuki Chihaya in disbelief.

Similarly, Mochizuki Ken, the Japanese commander, and the members of the Japanese team were staring at Mochizuki Chihaya with blank faces.

It was unbelievable that an instructor would lose a duel against a student.

Even though the Chinese student was quite impressive, the people of the West Guardian Tower clearly knew how strong Mochizuki Chihaya actually was.

“She hasn’t even used her Domain yet, why did she concede...” said the Japanese commander.

“It’s overkilling it if she uses her Domain in a duel against a student, but I believe Mochizuki Chihaya has her reasons if she did not want to continue the duel,” said Mochizuki Ken.

The leaders were dumbfounded, let alone the students of the West Guardian Tower, who almost dropped their jaws to the ground. They never thought Mochizuki Chihaya would actually lose the duel!

“Can anyone tell me what’s going on?”

“There’s no way Miss Chihaya would lose the duel. She must be unwilling to continue!” said the captain with spiky hair.

“Even so, that Chinese student called Mo Fan is very strong. I don’t think anyone on our team is able to fight Miss Chihaya like that!”

“Yeah, yeah, I wonder if the captain could face him.”

The captain with spiky hair immediately straightened his figure and insisted, “How am I not worthy to be his opponent? Didn’t I beat many representatives of other countries who tried to win approval from us?”

“But, you never forced Miss Chihaya to use the Advanced Spells of two different Elements.”

“That’s because the situation is different!”

“Mo Fan is such a maniac, able to fight an instructor like that!” Jiang Yu gave Mo Fan a thumbs up.

“Humph, didn’t you see that his opponent conceded on purpose?” huffed Zu Jiming.

“I’m more curious as to why he is standing there doing nothing, same with the Mochizuki Chihaya. She seems to be explaining something to him.”

“I bet he’s still feeling the joy of winning the duel.”

The others could not sense the presence of the Domain. Only the Magician could sense their Domain when it was first Awakened. Mochizuki Chihaya only discovered Mo Fan’s Domain when she felt her Element being suppressed.

Mochizuki Chihaya was an instructor. She subconsciously gave Mo Fan a piece of advice after learning that he had just probed his Domain. It was her responsibility as a teacher. Besides, things like Domains were extremely rare and precious for Magicians. She would not allow Mo Fan to miss such a great opportunity just because she had a grudge against him!

The area held all kinds of Elements that were invisible to the naked eye. Only Magicians could use their senses to probe for their presence and discover them.

A place with an abundant supply of the Fire Element would be dry and scorching. A place with a stronger presence of the Water Element would be wet and damp.

A Domain referred to a Magicians’ ability to accumulate the Element particles within a certain range and gather them within a specific radius, with themselves at the center.

If the mind of the Magician was strong enough and the Element particles accumulated by them reached a certain level, the area was called the Magician’s Domain.

The Domain would improve the strength, form, recovery, control, and channeling of the Magician’s Element, granting them a higher level of mastery of the specific Element.

In addition to that, the Domain could also suppress the strength of an opponent. After all, if a certain area had a strong presence of a certain Element, it meant the presence of other Elements would be weakened.

Therefore, Domains always played an important part in a duel between high-level Magicians. Being able to construct a Domain would result in huge differences in power!

Mo Fan realized that he had truly embarked on the path of magic after reaching the Advanced Level. His spells were no longer confined by their form. With enough control, he could even alter the form of his spells. Fights between Magicians were no longer as predictable and stiff!

Upon reaching the Advanced Level, a Magician’s physical attributes would also improve tremendously. Spells from three different Elements and their own mastery of them would make them completely different from Intermediate and Basic Magicians!

On second thought, the Commander-level creatures usually had dominating abilities. If Magicians were only able to stand still and toss their spells at the demon creatures, how would they stand a chance against the cunning, savage, and enormous Commander-level creatures?

Domains were most likely the deciding factor for Magicians. Those without a Domain could only follow the same routine when casting their spells, regardless of their level. However, those who had awakened their Domain would be able to utilize their magic as they wished. The spells would merge perfectly with their thoughts, allowing them to cast the spells in the form they wished. Even when they were experiencing great pressure, they would still be able to cast spells to defend themselves...

Mo Fan’s view toward Mochizuki Chihaya had changed, considering how she was trying her best to guide him in grasping his Domain.

The truth was, not every Advanced Magician would Awaken their Domain. There were many who had not even realized what Domains were. His cultivation was still too weak to directly Awaken it, he had only probed it because of his synchronization with little Flame Belle, granting him a better control over the Fire Element. In other words, it was mainly because of little Flame Belle’s ability. In terms of control, nothing had better control over the Fire Element than a spirit that was born in a Fire Calamity.

“Little Flame Belle, we’ve just probed our Domain, let’s keep it up!” Mo Fan told his beloved daughter.

Little Flame Belle was extremely focused. Mo Fan was quite touched by her dedication to improve after they had escaped death in the Space of Death at the Ancient Capital. She had seriously placed her playful heart down and focused on improving her strength. The talents granted by her noble lineage was absolutely stunning. She had almost awakened her Domain just from putting in some effort!

“According to what she said, we should try our best to accumulate the Fire particles within a kilometer from us!” said Mo Fan to little Flame Belle.

Both Mo Fan and little Flame Belle had to work together in the process. If they succeeded, they would be able to form the Domain. If they failed, the heavens knew how long they would have to wait to receive another opportunity. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Fire particles could be treated like Fire Fairies lingering in the space. A high Elemental compatibility was a must if they were to move closer to the Magician voluntarily. The fighting spirit that Mo Fan had displayed in his duel against Mochizuki Chihaya was something that the Fire Fairies were quite fond of!
