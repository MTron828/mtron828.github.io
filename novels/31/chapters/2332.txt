The infantry was struggling to break through the Venomous Insect Shamans’ line of defense. It had to face the enemy’s watchtowers and sturdy walls of trees next. It was impossible to tell how long it would take the infantry to reach the Scorching River.

Mo Fan was even more worried after seeing the enemy’s defenses from the sky. The Eagle Horse Skyriders had gone deep into the enemy’s territory, but the infantry had to overcome three more layers of the enemy’s defenses to reach them. If the infantry failed to break through the enemy’s defenses, the Eagle Horse Skyriders would be wiped out entirely. It was unlikely they would make it out alive after attacking so deep into the enemy’s territory!

“Use the angelim trees as cover from the enemy’s Elemental Magic!” Dutch’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

Dutch would give an order every time the soldiers were at a loss. The lieutenant general was calm at all times.

He was indeed an experienced commander!

The Brown Rebels had set up a trap using the taller angelim trees. They were planning to trap the Federation’s infantry inside walls of tall and sturdy trees, but they ended up as a temporary cover for the Eagle Horse Skyriders.

The Eagle Horse Skyriders dove from the sky and landed on the canopy.

Elemental Magic spread in the sky above them like watercolor, dyeing the gray clouds with different colors. The energy of the exploding spells turned into strong gusts of wind regardless of their initial forms.

The strong gusts weakened by the time they reached the canopy. The Eagle Horse Skyriders did not even have to set up a defensive barrier, they just had to wait until the blasts of the enemy’s Elemental Magic faded away.

“Fourth squad, bait the enemy’s attack!” Dutch ordered.

The Eagle Horse Skyriders with tattoos of a stalk of grain on their arms took off and charged at the enemy’s camp!

A new wave of destructive spells rose into the sky. It was deadlier than the first wave!

The fourth squad turned around halfway the instant the enemy fired their spells.

Lieutenant General Dutch had ordered them to bait out the enemy’s attacks. As he had expected, the enemy was ready to fire an even deadlier wave of spells at them as soon as they took off from the trees.

Lieutenant General Dutch was an impressive tactician. He had sent the fastest troop of the Eagle Horse Skyriders to bait out the enemy’s attack, while the rest of the troops were on standby.

The fourth squad managed to retreat in time by abusing its speed. The enemy’s second wave of spells completely missed their targets and posed zero threat to the Eagle Horse Skyriders.

“Well done!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The fourth squad had perfectly baited out the attacks of a few thousand enemy Mages.

Basic Mages were extremely slow at constructing their Star Orbits. The Eagle Horses could easily travel a few hundred meters by the time they were ready to fire a new wave of spells.

Lieutenant General Dutch immediately ordered his men to attack after baiting out the enemy’s spells.

“Line formation, Eagle Cries!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Eagle Horses stood in lines and opened their mouths!

The Eagle Horses screeched loudly, like the sound made by scratching a piece of glass. The Star Orbits of the Brown Rebels broke after they were disrupted by the Eagle Horses’ screams.

“Shadow Troopers, charge!”

The Eagle Horse Skyriders were split into squads based on their Elements. Most members of the third squad were Shadow Mages.

The Shadow Mages drew a dark curtain in the sky with Nyx Regime, allowing them to cover a great distance using Fleeing Shadow while traveling in the darkness.

The Brown Rebels were shocked to see the Eagle Horse Skyriders already in front of them, as they had no idea what just happened!

“Fear of Shadow!”

The Shadow Mages Cast another Shadow Spell with a huge area of effect. It loomed over the Brown Rebels and fell on them like an enormous hand.

The Brown Rebels were blinded and shivering. The fear in their hearts expanded rapidly, preventing them from using magic.

The Advanced Shadow Spell: Nyx Regime was very effective in a battle. Even though it was not able to threaten the enemy physically, it could suppress a huge number of Basic and Intermediate Mages with its darkness.

Mages who were unable to use their magic due to fear were no different from ordinary people!

“Use Cleanse to drive away the darkness!” a captain of the Brown Rebels yelled.

Light Mages were not afraid of darkness. They immediately drew Star Orbits and Cast Brilliant Light amid the darkness to drive away the fear plaguing the Brown Rebels.

Unfortunately, the Eagle Horse Skyriders had already closed the distance between them!

The Brown Rebels were stunned to see the ferocious Eagle Horses right in front of them after their vision was restored.

These Warrior-level creatures had no trouble killing the Brown Rebels, even when the riders were not using any magic!

The Eagle Horses kicked at the Brown Rebels and trampled them into the ground. Blood splattered across the soil, which was quickly littered with broken corpses!

“Rise into the sky and maintain your distance from the enemy!” Lieutenant General Dutch’s voice sounded in everyone’s ears. “Rise into the sky! Maintain your distance from the enemy!” Dutch repeated after a few more seconds.

The lieutenant general did not want his men to overstay their welcome. They had to rely on the Nyx Regime’s protection to attack the Brown Rebels at will.

The Eagle Horses were able to move swiftly on the ground, too. They picked up their pace while trampling the corpses as they rode the wind into the sky.

As soon as the Eagle Horses took off, a few dozen Advanced Mages came out of the enemy’s camp and headed straight for the area that was covered in darkness!

Zhao Manyan turned around and glanced at the magic explosions behind them. He blurted out, “How ruthless can they be? They are bombarding the areas where their own people are!”

Sky-Flame Funeral, Icebound Coffin, Wind Wings, Flash Strikes, and Plummeting Rays...

The Advanced Spells instantly brought great destruction to the area. The Brown Rebels who were trapped in the darkness quickly perished, scattered to ashes.

Luckily, the Eagle Horse Skyriders had left decisively. Otherwise, they would have suffered great casualties, too!

“It’s obviously worth trading the lives of Basic Mages for us Eagle Horse Skyriders,” the captain of the troop of Shadow Mages spoke up.

Mo Fan had never thought about it.

He had assumed the enemy’s Advanced Mages would hesitate to use their destructive spells after the Eagle Horse Skyriders charged into their camp, but the Advanced Mages had shown little hesitation!

“The leader of the Brown Rebels has already declared that he will reward those who kill an Eagle Horse Skyrider with a piece of land in their new country!” the captain went on.

The Brown Rebels had always found the Eagle Horse Skyriders an eyesore!
