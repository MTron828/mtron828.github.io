“I’m sorry to tell you all that the military is still busy at the coasts and the estuary. We are only people of the Pearl Institute,” the student explained.

“The Pearl Institute will do. It has a lot of talented Mages. How many did you bring?” the middle-aged man said.

“Six.”

“...”

Only six?

The people of the town were disappointed, and started complaining anxiously.

The middle-aged man lost his calm. “We were stuck here for so long. Why is it taking so long for help to arrive? Why aren’t they taking our lives seriously?”

“Yeah, we didn’t bring any resources with us. Everyone is starving. We have been drinking unfiltered water. If help doesn’t arrive soon, we are going to starve to death, even if we aren’t eaten by the sea monsters!”

“Did the government give up on us?”

The people inside the bunker started panicking. They had persevered through the situation because they had hope, but there was no hope for them right now after all.

“Everyone, please stay calm and listen to me!” Captain Ma Yong stood on a higher spot and shouted.

Fear and panic were contagious in an enclosed space with over ten thousand people. It was not easy to pacify them.

However, Ma Yong stubbornly repeated the same words even though his voice was drowned out by the noises. He kept shouting to calm the people down.

His voice started to go hoarse, but his shouts were effective, and the people eventually calmed down. Even though they were desperate and crying, they tried their best to lower their voices.

“My friends, it’s too early to give up now. The government hasn’t given up on us. Think about it, the people of other towns were all eaten by the sea monsters, but we are still alive. It’s a blessing from the Heavens, so that is all the more the reason for us to stay calm and figure out a way to leave this place in one piece. We should cooperate with the people who came here to save us!” Ma Yong said.

“Captain Ma, you have done a lot for us. Without you and your men...” The people were ashamed of themselves after seeing the captain’s willingness to fulfill his job to the end.

“At least we are safe for now. The sea monsters won’t find us here. The whole river is crawling with sea monsters, and the Pearl Institute is sacrificing itself to annihilate them. We should wait patiently. We can leave once the sea monsters are dealt with,” Ma Yong went on.

“It’s true, Senior Mo Fan here is a Super Mage! He and Senior Sister Ding killed a Ruler-level sea monster recently. The dead bodies of the sea monsters are piled up at the river bay! Just give us more time, and we’ll make sure you leave here safely!” the student exclaimed.

The rest of the City Hunters looked at Mo Fan curiously. The man was equivalent to an army if he was capable of killing a Ruler-level sea monster!

“We have a Super Mage with us!”

“A Super Mage who can kill thousands of sea monsters...”

“That’s such a relief.”

The people immediately calmed down. Was there anything more comforting than knowing there was a Super Mage with them?

“Everyone, there’s no need to be nervous. This bunker is extremely safe. The sea monsters will never find you. As a matter of fact, even if the government sent an army to rescue you, the sea monsters are hiding around this area. The army would only attract the attention of more sea monsters, resulting in huge casualties. The army won’t guarantee everyone’s safety, so the best option for you is to stay here and wait until the sea monsters are exterminated. You will all be able to leave here safely,” Mo Fan told them.

The words of a Super Mage were extremely reliable. The people stopped complaining. They knew how well-hidden the bunker was.

No one was willing to face the brutal sea monsters. They were satisfied with staying in the safe bunker!

Captain Ma Yong and his men had a discussion with Mo Fan after they calmed the people down.

“Our greatest worry is the shortage of food. Otherwise, we are fine by ourselves,” Ma Yong said.

“That should be easy to solve,” Mo Fan said.

“The air vent is too small, and we can’t open the door. I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult to bring in enough food to feed ten thousand people,” Ma Yong frowned.

“Don’t worry, that’s easy to solve, too!”

Mo Fan and the student returned to the woods after leaving the bunker.

They roughly explained the situation to the others. Wei Rong looked relieved. He immediately contacted the Hunter Union to request food supplies.

“It’s good to hear so many people are still alive,” Ding Yumian smiled.

She knew how miraculous it was for an entire town to survive in their current situation, especially after seeing the river littered with corpses.

Mo Fan continued to meditate as he waited.

It was important to save up energy. He had to recover his energy and wipe out every sea monster in the river. Mo Fan could not afford to waste a single second.

Mo Fan was startled by Wei Rong’s angry voice. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Unacceptable, that Elder Yao didn’t show up to kill the sea monsters. He was late to save the people, and when I asked them to send us some food, he rejected it because he claimed they would be feeding the sea monsters instead!” Wei Rong cursed loudly.

He had never met anyone worse than the elder of the Hunter Union, who acted like such a scumbag when the people of China were in a pinch.

“We don’t have enough people to transport the food. How are we going to gather enough food for the bunker in a limited time?” the student with the Shadow Element, named Zhang Zhuo, spoke up angrily.

Mo Fan opened his eyes and asked Wei Rong for the reason why the Hunter Union was reluctant to help.

“A group of Deep Sea Bass Demons have occupied a sector of the river. The Hunters do not dare cross paths with them,” Wei Rong informed him.

“Oh, Deep Sea Bass Monsters? So they are the same as normal bass?” Mo Fan asked him.

“More or less, but their average length is roughly seven meters, and their scales are as thick as armor. They are like heavy trucks at full speed when they are swimming in the water. Nothing can stop them,” Wei Rong said.

“Perfect... it’s time to treat the people to a buffet!” Mo Fan seemed to have an idea.

The others did not understand what he meant.

They had no way of transporting enough food to feed ten thousand people.. It was difficult just to satisfy their hunger. How were they going to prepare a buffet for the people in the bunker?
