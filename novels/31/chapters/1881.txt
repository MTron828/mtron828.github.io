Chapter 1882: The Crisis on the Bridge

Translated by XephiZ

“I’ll go check it out,” Chu Mingxi of the Hongling Division said.

Liu Xi immediately watched the Mage make a move. He saw the man fly closer to the water. He was about to cheer for the man’s valiant appearance when he suddenly noticed an enormous shadow with suffocating pressure under the water.

Liu Xi initially thought it was the silhouette of the Huoshao Islet below the Haicang Bridge. It was currently submerged due to the rise of the sea level, but he soon noticed the shadow moving around!

“Look out, there’s something in the water!”

Liu Xi’s vision was outstanding compared to a normal person’s vision. He could see further than Mages in the pouring rain. Even Chu Mingxi was unaware of the huge creature hiding under the water when he was so close to the surface.

Unfortunately, Liu Xi was only an ordinary teenager. Chu Mingxi was too far from him. His yell had no chance of reaching the captain.

“There’s a huge monster in the water! Get everyone to leave the bridge now. There’s a huge monster in the water!” Liu Xi quickly ran toward the Battlemages nearby when he realized his voice could not reach Chu Mingxi.

“Stay in the queue, kid, we’ll handle everything,” the Battlemage of the Hongling Division said.

“It’s right under the Haicang Bridge! The thing is huge. It’s speeding up too!” Liu Xi yelled in the rain, hoping that someone would believe him.

“I told you to stay in the queue!” the Battlemage grunted.

Liu Xi was astounded. The Battlemages did not believe him at all!

“Say it to him, he seems pretty impressive,” Fang Xiaoxue said, pointing at a Mage in a silver outfit who was hovering in the air.

Liu Xi looked down at the bridge again. He noticed the huge monster was picking up speed...

Its speed was slightly hindered, possibly because the strait was too shallow for it. It was unable to use the depth of the water to accelerate further. It could only swim back and forth continuously to pick up its speed. Its movement was causing unusual waves to start rolling in the strait!

The Battlemage with the name Chu Mingxi was too close to the sea monster. Most importantly, he still had not spotted the monster due to the heavy rain and fierce waves!

A blasting roar exploded above the ocean. A strong wind swept the seawater and the storm before lashing at the bridge!

The wind was disastrous. It went straight at the cable tower of the Haicang Bridge. The bridge, supported by the steel cables, began to shake hard. The bridge was held up by the steel cables, so when the cable tower was under attack, the whole bridge started shaking with it!

The wind was not just threatening the bridge. It also knocked the people crossing it into the air like leaves.

The storm swept through fiercely while the bridge shook vigorously. Civilians were knocked into the air and away from the bridge. Some were even tossed into the sea. The people who were still stuck at the bridgehead froze in place with their eyes wide, staring at the astonishing sight in disbelief. It looked like the apocalypse to them!

It was not just a few people, but hundreds or even thousands of people were being swept into the air like grain. Cries of agony were mixed with the howling wind, which soon fell down together with the rain.

The people who had yet to cross the bridge were not sure whether they should be feeling relieved or desperate. The sudden wind was not just merciless, it was like the wrath of the Heavens!

“Sea monster! A Ruler-level creature!”

The Mages finally noticed something. Someone had spotted an enormous mouth emerging from the sea, followed by the fierce gust of wind that struck the bridge and knocked the people into the air. The mist was preventing the Mages from seeing the monster clearly!

“Back off! Back off! Everyone, back to the bus transit!” the Battlemages yelled. The single gust of wind had completely toppled the order they had put in so much effort to maintain.

The truth was, the Mages were just like ordinary people against a high-level sea monster. They were as tiny as dust particles against a Ruler-level creature.

The bridgehead was now in complete chaos. Many people were still heading for the transit station from the mountains on both sides, hoping to cross the sea as soon as possible. They were a fair distance away, thus they were unaware of what was happening on the bridge. As for the people that were drifting in the wind, they simply assumed they were blowing debris. They kept moving toward the bridgehead, while the people on the bridge were backing away desperately. It further delayed the evacuation of the bridge.

Panic and chaos; the steady operation had encountered a huge crisis out of nowhere. The Battlemages and members of the Magic Association were at a loss now. The situation clearly displayed how terrifying the sea’s unpredictable nature was. No one knew exactly what was hiding in the water!

As a matter of fact, they already arranged for a troop of Water Mages to keep an eye on the water, but the sea monster somehow snuck past their watch. Not many could see and sense its presence despite its enormous size, and even the few Super Mages watching over the strait were unaware of it!

Many sea monsters had unknown abilities, so the Mages of various organizations were unsettled and lost under the circumstances.

“It’s still moving around! It’s going to ram into the bridge!”

Liu Xi was constantly pushed back by the crowd, but he tried his best to stand in places where he could see the water. His screams almost tore his throat apart. He only hoped that someone was able to hear him!

The wind swept a curtain of mist into the air. It was not like the Mages were slow and dumb, but they could not see a thing at all. The white mist was constantly circling the bridge. They could only see a few dozen meters away at most, let alone the shadow in the water under the bridge! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

There was a buzz, and the Mage in a silver outfit vanished into thin air, leaving silver sprinkles behind to disappear into nothing.

A second later, the Mage reappeared on the cable tower over five hundred meters away. The tower was shaking vigorously. Many steel cables had already snapped in half after terrifying screeches.

The snapping steel cables were extremely deadly to the people on the bridge. Their force would leave a gory mess along the path they were swinging through!
