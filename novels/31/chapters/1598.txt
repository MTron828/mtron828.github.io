Chapter 1599 No Backing Off, Confronting with Fury!

The power of the sword knocked Mo Fan flying. He tumbled back through the air.

The Dark Swordmaster’s attacks were not that simple. It suddenly pointed its sword at Mo Fan. One of the sword shadows sprang at Mo Fan before he could regain his balance!

“This guy is really strong!” Mo Fan murmured.

He tried to figure out a way to dodge the attack of the shadow approaching when he noticed a silver Star Constellation forming behind him. It activated as soon as he fell onto it.

“Oh my!” Mo Fan reappeared three hundred meters away, facing the ground.

Mo Fan fell to the ground on his face. His nose was swollen for sure!

That being said, he would rather fall on his face than be hit by the sword shadows. He did not really have much defense to protect himself...

“Don’t be so reckless, you still have us as your teammates!” Heidi called out.

The silver Star Constellation was obviously from her. She had lent Mo Fan a hand to dodge the Dark Swordmaster’s attack!

Mo Fan rose to his feet and called back with a wry smile, “I’m just taking the lead. Someone has to show some courage against a Ruler-level creature. If there’s not someone like me who dares to initiate the fight first, the others would just stand there and wait for their deaths!”

Mo Fan’s way of motivating the others was quite effective. Meos and Shreev had already Summoned their undead.

They both summoned an enormous Great Commander-level Mummy each. The two huge Mummies immediately engaged the Dark Swordmaster after Mo Fan was knocked into the air.

The Dark Swordmaster backed away slightly and pulled on the reins. The black horse neighed and lifted its front limbs!

“Vertical Slash!”

The Dark Swordmaster lifted its sword up high and waited until the horse was almost perpendicular to the ground. As the horse fell back to the ground, the Dark Swordmaster used the momentum to cut down with its sword!

A black wave struck the sturdy body of Meos’ black Mummy like a curtain of water. To everyone’s surprise, it instantly sliced the black Mummy in half, despite its sturdiness!

A single slash! The Dark Swordmaster had sliced Meos’ Mummy in half with a single slash!

Even Meos was shocked. The black Mummy might only be a Commander-level creature, yet she had refined it with all kinds of resources. Its defense greatly surpassed that of an average Commander-level creature, but it was still sliced in half so easily!

Luckily, it was possible to Summon her undead again. Otherwise, this would be a painful loss to her!

Shreev’s Mummy was the same kind. It was meant to be a tank he mainly used to defend himself and stop powerful demon creatures from advancing on him.

Just like Meos’ Mummy, Shreev’s Mummy also died to a single slash. The two huge Mummies could not withstand even a single blow from the Dark Swordmaster!

Meos and Shreev did not have just the one Mummy. They knew they had reached the final stage, so they decisively brought out everything they had, Summoning a bunch of undead.

These undead might not be as strong as the Mummies, but they had no trouble delaying the Dark Swordmaster. They just needed to buy Mo Fan some time, since he was the only person strong enough to inflict damage on the Dark Swordmaster!

“Fiery Dragon Roar!”

Mo Fan was engulfed in flames once again. He was like a burning train, heading straight at the Dark Swordmaster.

The Dark Swordmaster saw Mo Fan charging at it as soon as it killed off the undead. It quickly thrust its sword at the ground!

The huge sword struck the ground in front of the horse, and formed a black barrier encapsulating the Dark Swordmaster and its horse. Mo Fan slammed heavily into the barrier while screaming the cry of a fiery dragon!

The sword in the ground skidded back from the enormous impact. Both the Dark Swordmaster and its horse were knocked back by the collision!

Sparkles scattered across the place. The power of Mo Fan’s charge lasted for a long time, and managed to leave some cracks on the barrier.

The barrier finally broke as the flaming charge was coming to an end. The remaining flames lunged at the Dark Swordmaster and its horse. Their armor reddened in the scorching heat!

The Dark Swordmaster took the initiative to back away. It did not pick up the sword still stuck in the ground. It rode its horse and escaped from the flames instead!

“It didn’t really do much to it...” Meos stared at the Dark Swordmaster. She did not see any sign of its armor breaking.

“Its defense is pretty crazy, too...”

It was extremely difficult to injure a Ruler-level creature. After all, even a Super Spell could only inflict minor injuries on a Ruler-level creature, and Mo Fan’s spells had yet to reach the Super Level!

“You’re asking for your death!” the Dark Swordmaster uttered coldly, staring at the flaming Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was extremely close to the Dark Swordmaster. When it raised its hand, the huge sword stuck to the ground immediately shuddered.

The sword clanked like a hammer had struck it. It shot out of the ground on its own and flew toward the Dark Swordmaster.

The Dark Swordmaster, Mo Fan, and the sword happened to be on a straight line. The sword was heading right at Mo Fan’s back as it was flying back to the Dark Swordmaster.

Mo Fan turned around and quickly dodged to the side when he saw the huge sword, but the sword surprisingly split into several shadows to seal off his escape! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Two sword shadows swept past Mo Fan’s arms. Blood poured out from cuts that were close to reaching the bone!

“Damn it, I can’t dodge them at all!” Mo Fan knew the direction and angle the sword was coming from, but he had still failed to dodge it.

The attacks were too quick; Mo Fan did not have time to use Blink. On top of that, the attacks were sealing off his escape by approaching from certain angles, so he could not use the Fleeing Shadow, either. He tried his best to land in a safe spot, yet he was still injured!

The cuts did not just bleed. A black substance was rising from them, too.

Mo Fan knew it was the darkness corruption. It would nullify all Healing Magic and worsen the injuries over time.

It was important to treat the wounds right away. If the darkness infiltrated his body, his organs would fail rapidly. Unfortunately, Mo Fan did not have time to deal with the deadly injuries. He turned into a lightning ray and forcibly approached the Dark Swordmaster!

Mo Fan was tiny compared to the Dark Swordmaster. However, he knew backing away was not an option. The massive sword that could move on its own had already sealed off his escape. He would be sliced to pieces if he took even a step back!

Since withdrawing was not an option, he had no choice but to attack. The Dark Swordmaster did not expect such a bold move from a human!.

“Take this!” Mo Fan accumulated the power of the three Soul-grade Flames and threw a fist forward with a raging roar!

Not only did lava erupt from the fist, it even triggered a terrifying explosion when it landed on the horse!

Mo Fan knew his punch might not be strong enough to injure the Dark Swordmaster, but its horse did not necessarily have the defense of a Ruler-level creature. Taking out its mount was equivalent to breaking its leg!

Unfortunately, it was not easy to trick the Dark Swordmaster. It tightened its legs around the horse as a substance like mercury quickly spread across the horse, significantly strengthening its defense!

Clang!

The fist landed right on the horse’s chest, yet it felt like it had hit a thick metal sheet. The horse remained standing even though it skidded quite a distance away from the impact.

Mo Fan’s attack failed to leave a scratch on the horse. Even the flames had no effect on it...

Mo Fan was stunned when he saw his attack fail to injure the horse. He looked at the Dark Swordmaster, whose eyes once again flickered with a hint of disdain. However, there was an extra hint of murderous intent this time.

“Imbecile!” the Dark Swordmaster grunted.

The huge sword had returned to its hand. It was pointing straight at Mo Fan!

Mo Fan was less than twenty meters from the Dark Swordmaster. It was no different than standing right under the Ruler-level creature’s sword.

“Mo Fan, you should back away for now!” Shreev yelled.

Mo Fan obviously wanted to back away. However, as soon as he turned around, the Dark Swordmaster could easily slice his head off, considering how quick its attacks were!

He could not back away now. He was going to die if he did!

Mo Fan quickly gathered the flames nearby into a Flame Sword before they dissipated. He took the initiative to swing the burning sword at the Dark Swordmaster’s head.

The Dark Swordmaster raised its sword, too. The black sword and the blazing red sword collided with one another. A strong black energy swept in Mo Fan’s direction like a fierce tornado. Opposite it, the flames charged forward like raging beasts. They were not willing to surrender to the black aura emitted by the sword!
