“Here is your Dark Noble Mantle. You did great, but don’t be so reckless and hurt the government soldiers again, do you understand?” Feng Li told Mo Fan seriously, particularly emphasizing the second half of the sentence.

“Why do I feel like you have no idea how to compliment a person? Couldn’t you leave out the second half?” Mo Fan replied.

“Don’t you talk back to me!” snapped Feng Li.

Mu Ningxue shrugged. He did not waste his time further with the bad-tempered advisor. He soon fixed his eyes on Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue was dressed in blue today. The trip to Tianshan Mountain seemed to have paid off a lot. Even her aura was a lot purer, like a lotus blossoming quietly at the top of a mountain.

Leaving her temperament aside, the main point was, her dress was actually wrapping her bust tightly. Mo Fan felt like he was going to faint when he saw her firm, bouncy boobs under the dress. He could play with them all day....

Mo Fan’s eyes were inches away from Mu Ningxue’s chest. He was completely unaware of her darkening expression.

– Why is there such a shameless man in this world? Couldn’t he be more like a gentleman? – Even if he was not ashamed at all, she still felt extremely awkward in the situation.

“Hehe, you managed to rejoin the team, that’s very impressive.” Mu Tingying glanced at Mu Ningxue, her insincere tone brimming with jealousy. Her actual words were supposed to be, A blue dress? Do you really think you’re a saint? Bitch!

After grumbling inside, Mu Tingying soon found most men’s attention was fixed on Mu Ningxue. She was utterly frustrated!

Did she trade her body in exchange for a chance to return to the national team? If not, how was it possible for her to come back? There was no way she could catch up to the rest of the team without the support of an enormous background!

“Let’s proceed with the duels.” The two advisors did not like to waste any time. They would be gone as soon as they were done with their job. Mo Fan seriously did not understand why the national team needed the advisors. They were merely barking orders at them.

Mo Fan initially wanted to watch the duels, but Mu Ningxue said she had something to tell him. The two left the place.

Bangersha City was pretty ordinary. It resembled an old cowboy town in North America, with Western-style bars in almost every corner.

The wind was dusty and strong. Mu Ningxue led Mo Fan to a deserted street. Mo Fan was rather confused about what Mu Ningxue wanted to discuss with him, that she had to come all the way here...

Perhaps she had finally realized that it was meaningless to maintain their current relationship that was full of ambiguities with him. It was better to make it clear and take off... and take the relationship seriously, and fall deeply in love with one another.

“I have something important to tell you,” Mu Ningxue said with a serious look.

Mo Fan nodded. He did not look excited at all, because every time he was excited about something, it would all be for nothing.

“I stumbled upon something at Tianshan Mountain, and I think it might be related to someone you know,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Oh man, not again!” Mo Fan looked utterly helpless.

Whenever he was excited, it was all for nothing, but even when he was calm, he was calm for nothing, either. Why couldn’t the scene just develop in the direction he wanted?

“What’s with that?” Mu Ningxue was confused.

“Nothing, I thought you were going to confess your love to me,” Mo Fan replied honestly.

“You’re retarded.”

“Tell me about it, Tianshan Mountain is so far away. I don’t think I have any friends there; did you mistake me for someone else?” Mo Fan went back to the topic.

“Do you know Qin Yu’er?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“I don’t think so... hang on, hang on a second... I think I’ve heard the name before.” The name suddenly sounded rather familiar to Mo Fan.

However, he just could not remember who the person was after thinking a while.

He knew he had never seen the person before. He only the name from someone that had mentioned it briefly!

“Tianshan Mountain... Qin Yu’er, I remember now, I heard the name from Zhang Xiaohou before!” Mo Fan finally remembered.

Zhang Xiaohou once mentioned that Zhan Kong had a knot in his heart. He once entered the chasm of Tianshan Mountain when he was young, and the woman he loved ended up being trapped inside the chasm. Even after many years, he was unable to rescue her from the chasm. He did not even know if she was still alive.

“Boss Zhan Kong trained extremely hard. He promised to go back to the chasm at Tianshan Mountain once he achieved the Super Level and take her out of there, whether she was alive or dead,” Mo Fan remembered Zhang Xiaohou saying.

Mo Fan was quite touched back then, as he only heard it after Zhan Kong had died. Mo Fan remembered he had mixed feelings when he learned that his instructor did not fulfill his last wish.

Someone was still waiting for him on Tianshan Mountain. When he decided to sacrifice his life and let the black armor consume him, he was surely thinking of Qin Yu’er...

As such, Mo Fan had decided that if he ever managed to achieve the Super Level, he would visit the chasm in Tianshan Mountain and find the frozen Qin Yu’er inside there, as his way of paying respects to Chief Military Instructor Zhan Kong.

“How did you learn the name?” Mo Fan asked.

“She told me herself,” replied Mu Ningxue.

“She told you? She’s alive?” Mo Fan blinked at Mu Ningxue in shock.

Mu Ningxue nodded and said, “She spent some time with me in the town below Tianshan Mountain. Her memories were stuck in the past, from around ten years ago. She was surprised that ten years had passed since she had been frozen in the ice.”

“How did she wake up? Did someone save her?” Mo Fan asked hurriedly.

Mo Fan was incredibly excited at the news. Zhan Kong had sacrificed his own life in the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, saving millions of lives. He even let the armor take over his body, just so he could use his remaining will to command the army of undead to retreat.

Back then, even after Mo Fan had transformed into a demon, he barely stood a chance against the Mountain Zombie, even after it was already injured after fighting against many Super Mages. The person that had saved the Ancient Capital was actually Zhan Kong, but only a few people knew the truth.

Mo Fan’s respect for Zhan Kong could not be described with words. He was determined to fulfill Zhan Kong’s last wish. He had kept it deep inside his heart while waiting to grow stronger.

However, Qin Yu’er had woken up, coming out from the chasm by Tianshan Mountain on her own...

“What happened?” asked Mo Fan.

“Qin Yu’er said that someone saved her, but she didn’t know who the person was. She only remembered seeing someone’s blurred back from the reflection on the broken ice. The person was wearing black armor, and had an otherworldly presence. That’s all she could remember,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Black armor...” Mo Fan gasped.

-Could it be him!?

-But how is that possible...-

According to Zhang Xiaohou’s description of the situation at the Blood Emperor Throne, the black armor most likely hosted the Ancient King’s soul. It would soon infiltrate the consciousness of the person whose body it took over.

The person able to control the Kingdom of Undead that had almost razed the Ancient Capital to the ground was probably just a trapped soul inside Zhan Kong’s body. It was impossible that it still had Zhan Kong’s consciousness inside...

Mo Fan once exchanged glances with the man standing on the Mountain Zombie. His eyes, his expression, his presence all implied that he was a total stranger to Mo Fan. Even though the dried face with cracks looked exactly like Zhan Kong, it was impossible that he was still the same person!

Mu Ningxue saw the tremendous change in Mo Fan’s expression and immediately realized that the truth was a lot more complicated than she knew.

She immediately pursued the matter in a serious voice. After all, Qin Yu’er was quite close to her now. They had spent a long time together at Tianshan Mountain. Qin Yu’er was determined to find the person that had saved her, so Mu Ningxue was following her around as she trained on Tianshan Mountain. “Do you know the person with the black armor?”

“Person... I don’t think he’s still human. He’s an emperor from two thousand years ago, the inventor of the Undead Element, the only person that could live for eternity.” Mo Fan was quite confident that the person who saved Qin Yu’er was the Dead Emperor.

Dead Emperor was the name that Han Ji and the others had given to the current ruler of the undead. With the Dead Emperor’s control over the undead, they had been behaving quite well recently. They were only active in their tombs and their underground palace.

Mu Ningxue studied Mo Fan. She felt like Mo Fan was talking about something unrealistic.

“It all happens during the Calamity of the Ancient Capital...”

Mo Fan explained what had happened in the Dark Abyss during the Calamity of the Ancient Capital to Mu Ningxue in detail. Many things that had happened during the calamity were unbelievable and shocking, be it the eight Undead Rulers attacking the city, the imperial tomb hidden in the Dark Abyss, or the space-shifting of the Dark Abyss.

Anyone would find it hard to believe when hearing about it for the first time.

Mu Ningxue was the kind of person who was collected most of the time. However, after hearing Mo Fan’s story, her mouth remained open for quite a long time. Her wide eyes showed her astonishment after hearing the details.

“I’m finally starting to believe that you’re the hero of the Ancient Capital’s Calamity,” Mu Ningxue said.

Mo Fan was able to explain everything in so much detail only because he had experienced it all himself. There was no way he could make it all up!

“Zhan Kong is the real hero; he was Qin Yu’er’s lover before she was frozen in the ice.” Mo Fan smiled wryly. Mo Fan could not afford to joke about the matter. As a matter of fact, Mo Fan seriously hoped that the person in the black armor was still Zhan Kong. However, he was now with the undead. His eyes no longer belonged to the human world. If the God of Death was real, he was most likely the one!

“So it was him who saved the Ancient Capital; the Commander of our Bo City, Zhan Kong!” Mu Ningxue was astounded.

She did remember Zhan Kong. Without him protecting Bo City, the city would simply have become a dead land during the calamity. Qin Yu’er did mention Zhan Kong many times, but Mu Ningxue never knew that Zhan Kong was already dead, nor did she know the things that he did in the Ancient Capital.

Mu Ningxue already felt tears in her eyes after hearing Mo Fan’s words.

Not only was she extremely respectful of Zhan Kong, she strongly felt the bond between Qin Yu’er and Zhan Kong when she spent time with the woman. It felt like the woman would go meet Zhan Kong straightaway after she expressed her gratitude to the man that had saved her life, and share her joy with Zhan Kong after finally uniting with him after ten years...

However, it seemed like Qin Yu’er was doomed to wash her face in tears when all her anticipation turned into despair, as Zhan Kong had already died from the Black Armor of Death during the Calamity of the Ancient Capital.
