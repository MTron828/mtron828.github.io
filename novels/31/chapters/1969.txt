“We’ve been searching high and low for clues and people who know where to find the Night Amethyst, but it turned out that you knew about it all along!” Mo Fan exclaimed, while smacking his forehead.

Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu looked at Mo Fan disdainfully. Since when had he spent time searching for information about the Night Amethyst?

“I don’t believe many people in our homeland know about the Night Amethyst. The person who told you to come to Tianshan Mountain to look for it must be an expert too,” Nanyu said.

“Can you help us find it? Someone’s life is at stake,” Zhao Manyan asked her.

“I can give it a try, but there’s no guarantee. In the past, many Mages used the Night Amethyst as a bargaining chip when dealing with the God of Darkness, in exchange for his power. The Night Amethyst is extremely rare now, since it takes over a hundred thousand years or even millions of years to form. It’s rare to find a place that has been well preserved for over a hundred thousand years. The Southernmost Land is one possibility, and Tianshan Mountain is the other,” Nanyu told him.

“The Southernmost Land...” Zhao Manyan twisted his lips. Did that mean they had to visit Antarctica if they could not find the Night Amethyst on Tianshan Mountain?

He would rather choke Mu Bai to death and force him to swallow his last breath. The Southernmost Land was worse than Tianshan Mountain!

“Next time, if you’re looking for something ancient, you can ask me first. How much have you spent on the information related to the Night Amethyst?” Nanyu said.

Mo Fan turned to Lingling.

Lingling was also Mo Fan’s treasurer. He had given her all his cards. Mo Fan had saved up some money lately. He should have at least a billion by now...

“One or two hundred million,” Lingling said calmly.

Mo Fan almost fell from his chair.

One or two hundred million was enough for him to buy a luxurious mansion with a sea view in a modern city, yet she had spent it on some unreliable information?

Could a piece of information be worth a hundred million?!

“I have bought information from more than a hundred sources, each of which cost around a million. Most of them were information on minerals and crystals, so we might be able to earn some back if we bother looking for them, but that’s largely a waste of time for us. I ended up re-selling the information, but most people were interested in the rare resources in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain instead of minerals, so I couldn’t cover the losses,” Lingling went on.

“Lingling... you shouldn’t treat my money as mere numbers. I come from a poor family. I had to think twice when I spent over ten yuan on two bottles of water!” Mo Fan winced.

“It’s fine, I received some unexpected information too. I’ll explain it some other time,” Lingling waved it off.

“You can cancel those which you haven’t paid for. I can guarantee you that most of the information they have is fake. The truth is, they can’t really differentiate between the real Night Amethyst and another thing called the Night Quartz,” Nanyu sniffed.

“Mm, you’re right; half of the information I received is actually related to the Night Quartz,” Lingling was impressed when she heard Nanyu’s words.

The fact that Nanyu knew about the difference between the Night Amethyst and Night Quartz indicated she was an expert. Lingling only learned the difference between the two after spending a fortune on the information.

“Lingling, does the money you spent include information on the Totem Beasts? Or is that only the amount you’ve spent on information about the Night Amethyst?” Mo Fan asked as he suddenly remembered something.

“Of course it was only about the Night Amethyst. The rarer the thing we are looking for, the more expensive its information is going to cost,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan began to regret all this. He had been too focused on enjoying his time with Xinxia at the Parthenon Temple. He did not even realize his treasury had blown a hole!

He was planning to buy some magic Equipment, but it seemed like he had to continue on his adventure naked!

Lingling did not seem too bothered about it.

With all the information she had gathered, they could easily earn back the losses from the valuable resources along the way, even if they did not find the Night Amethyst or the Totem Beast.

The next day, Ai Jiangtu introduced them to the group of mercenaries.

Mo Fan summoned Apas and asked her to keep Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu, who both had yet to reach the Super Level, safe.

Apas had spent a long time cultivating on her own. She no longer had a voracious desire for the human world. She was not willing to be Lingling’s caretaker at first, but when she heard they were heading to Tianshan Mountain, her eyes flickered with excitement!

She was very interested in this place!

The group of six joined the rest of the mercenaries. The Vice Leader of the mercenary group was an Indian woman. She was tanned and had a huge nose. She was physically fit and had the bearing of a leopardess.

When she saw Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were with so many women, and how young Lingling and Apas were, she looked quite displeased.

“Well, they have quite a lot of useful information. Don’t worry. If anything happens, we can guarantee their safety,” Ai Jiangtu told the Vice Leader, Kuma.

“I’m more worried about their well-being than safety. My men might obey my orders, but they are also like beasts that might lose their rationality at any second. After all, Tianshan Mountain is a world without discipline and rules,” Kuma did not mind spilling the beans as a woman. She also made it clear that she would not intervene if those kinds of things happened.

“You better remind your men to not court their death,” Mu Ningxue said coldly. She was not fond of Kuma’s attitude.

Kuma raised her brows and burst out laughing like a man. “Interesting, I will remind them!”

Most of the members of the Mailong Private Military Group were men. There were a few women, but they were similar to the Vice Leader. They were just as muscular and tough as the men. Nanyu usually wore neutral outfits and always wore men’s clothes when she was in the wild, but Mu Ningxue, Jiang Shaoxu, Apas, and Lingling were different. They looked just like typical delicate women from the cities. The men could feel their blood rushing after a few extra glances.

“I’ll make you the captain of the ninth team, then. Since there aren’t a lot of members on your team, I’ll assign a few rookies and freeloaders to your team to make it thirteen,” Kuma said.

“Can’t you assign some reliable teammates to our team instead?” Ai Jiangtu asked with a wry smile. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I can’t help it. We have already broken the rules by letting them join the group. The others won’t say a thing only if your team is mainly full of freeloaders and rookies,” Kuma said.

“Alright,” Ai Jiangtu agreed helplessly.

As everyone thought, the men of the Mailong Private Military Group became restless when Mu Ningxue, Jiang Shaoxu, Apas, and Lingling joined the group.

Some were whistling and uttering filthy words that made the women feel uncomfortable. However, they were not complaining since they had joined the group of mercenaries on a tight schedule. Besides, they could easily get rid of the discrimination and disturbance with their strength if they wanted to.
