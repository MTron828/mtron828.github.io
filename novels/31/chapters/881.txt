Fang Shaoli cut off the communication. She stared coldly at Wang Xuxu, who was struggling in the pond. After Wang Xuxu fell into the water, something was grabbing onto her legs. She could not break free no matter how hard she tried.

“Are we continuing?” asked Zhao Pinlin.

“We’ll need to handle the emergency first. It looks like our location has been compromised...is everyone you brought a classmate? Why is there a Magician among them?” said Fang Shaoli.

“Oh, are you referring to those three... I don’t think there’s any problem with them, since I was the one who invited them,” Zhao Pinlin explained the situation on the bus.

“They can easily fake their identities. Even though we can investigate them further, we will be wasting our time trying to do so. Since you’re now one of us, I’ll let you probe their identities. I’ll leave a Cursed Beast under your control. Remember, even if you did not learn anything useful, you must avoid exposing yourself at all costs. Once your identity is compromised, I believe you understand what you have to do, right?” said Fang Shaoli.

Zhao Pinlin was startled. He received a blue-red pill from Fang Shaoli.

“The death in this world is only the beginning to paradise. I know what I should do!” said Zhao Pinlin fanatically.

“Very well, you will become a brilliant member with enough resolution. You might even earn your chance to meet the Mater in person,” said Fang Shaoli.

“Really?” blurted out Zhao Pinlin passionately.

“Of course, I was the same as you a long time ago. I was her most brilliant student,” Fang Shaoli smiled.

Master Mintian’s talk had ended. The reputable academic had already left, after bringing the manor quite a handsome sum. After all, the place was even more luxurious than a five-star hotel. A meal alone would cost many workers a month’s wage.

A few hundred people stayed at the manor. They were enjoying the unique environment and the secluded lifestyle while reflecting on Master Mintian’s teachings.

However, the same night, when most people had fallen asleep, the sound of battle came from the spacious field in the manor. The clueless Mo Fan pushed the curtains open and immediately saw a red fireball flying at him!

“F**k me!” Mo Fan cursed as he ducked.

The fireball flew past above his head. He soon smelled burning hair. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He turned around and saw the fireball had landed on the wall, leaving a scorched mark on it. Luckily, the wall was not made of wood, or it would have been set on fire instantly.

Mo Fan was speechless. Why would someone try to attack him with a Fire Burst as he was about to go to bed? He looked toward the noise and saw quite a number of Magicians fighting in the hedge maze. Judging from the Star Patterns, it seemed like there were quite a few Intermediate Magicians involved!

“What’s going on?” Mu Ningxue came onto the balcony. She was wearing thin sleepwear. Her smooth, perfect skin was partly visible under the cloth.

“I don’t know either, they started fighting all of a sudden,” said Mo Fan.

“Should we go take a look?” asked Mu Ningxue.

“No, we aren’t Magicians. You are only a Basic Magician now. We’ll walk down there and stand far away so we won’t expose ourselves,” said Mo Fan firmly.

“Sure thing!”

The two woke Lingling up and saw many people attracted by the noise as they headed downstairs. They were heading toward the noise to see what was going on.

The hedge maze was lit up by flames and rolling smoke, with occasional flickers of lightning. The people who did not practice magic were greatly astonished.

Rong Sheng, Guo Wenyi, and the others were here too. They had no idea what was going on, either; they only knew the fight seemed quite intense.

“Humph, you can’t escape!”

“Why are you arresting me?” Carly glared at the group of people.

“Enough with your act, we already knew the deal between you and that useless captain. You’re trying to cover up your relationship with the Black Vatican using the disguise of the manager of this manor. Today, we, the Golden Battle Hunters will arrest you and bring you to the Enforcement Union!” said the man in a shirt and suit pants.

The man was dressed like a businessman, yet it was obvious that he was a rather strong Magician.

There were eight other people close to him. They were dressed in casual clothes, some even looked like they were here for a vacation, yet everyone was able to use magic!

“Damn, you can’t accuse me without any proof!” snapped Carly.

Lightning was spreading from her hands, preventing the Magicians from getting close to her. The rapid, purple lightning provided her with great protection that could kill anyone that came too close.

“You’re just a manager, yet you are able to cast such an advanced spell; do you take us as idiots?!”

“Enough talking to her, she is at least a priestess! Take her down, and find the rest of their people!”

The members who called themselves the Golden Battle Hunters made their moves. Carly’s cultivation was indeed powerful. She was almost comparable to some Advanced Magicians, yet she alone could not handle an elite team of Hunters. As a Giant Shadow Spike sneakily landed on her shadow, the spell immediately sealed off her movement and severely influenced her mind.

“Watch out, she might be able to summon Cursed Beasts!” shouted the leader.

“She can’t move any more!” Another Hunter with the Shadow Element launched a few more Giant Shadow Spikes, striking her in series to strengthen the force controlling her.

Carly could no longer move, dragged around by the Shadow Magician. Her eyes were filled with disdain and hatred.

“Alright, we’ve taken the clergy down!”

“HAHA, I thought the Black Vatican is stronger than this, so this is all they got?” boasted a rough-looking Magician with a thick beard.

“Don’t lower your guard! There must be more members of the Black Vatican around. Call the others in to arrest them!” said the leader through the communication channel.

As soon as the order was given, the manor covered in darkness was instantly lit up by the glow of spells.

Soon, the sound of people cursing, the noise of fighting, and cries of agony rose across the place, as if a raid was taking place.

The people who came for a vacation were trembling in fear. Somehow, the place had turned into a battlefield where lots of Magicians were fighting one another. The place was meant to have only rich people and reputable people; where did all these Magicians come from!?

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue stood at the entrance. Lingling was slowly jogging toward them.

When she saw the Hunters grabbing onto Carly, her eyes immediately flickered uneasily. “This is bad...” she said to Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue.
