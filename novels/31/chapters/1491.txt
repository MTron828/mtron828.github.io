1492 The Tricky Poison and Curse

Translated by XephiZ

“What is Herr Casa even thinking? Why is he still hesitating to cooperate with us? Isn’t he aware of the current situation!?” Headmistress Perry said.

Edith stood to the side after brewing a cup of tea for Headmistress Perry. She did not dare to make a sound.

Headmistress Perry walked back and forth irritably. Some time later, a student came and told Edith that dinner was ready. Edith nodded and washed the cup of tea. She was about to talk to Headmistress Perry when another person showed up in a hurry. It was Sheryl, who had been appointed to accompany the Casas.

Heidi was Ceylan’s student, while Edith was Headmistress Perry’s protege. Sheryl was Brianca’s student. They were the top three students of the school, and they all played an important role there. When the Pearl Institute came to visit the school as the winner of the World College Tournament, the three were in charge of receiving and accompanying their guests.

“What is it now?” Edith asked. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The... the young duke has fallen sick,” Sheryl said in a panicked tone.

“Sick? He grew up close to the Alps, it’s unlikely that he’s unaccustomed to the weather. Why would he fall sick all of a sudden?” Headmistress Perry began to panic.

Trouble just kept coming. They had yet to reach a deal regarding their cooperation, and now Herr Casa had fallen ill!

—

Headmistress Perry, Edith, Ceylan, Heidi, and the others immediately headed to Herr Casa’s room. When they arrived, the four henchmen of the Casas were guarding the entrance with hostile faces. They did not allow anyone to go inside, including Headmistress Perry!

“I’m a Healer, there’s no reason to stop me from taking a look at him, right?” Ceylan asked.

“Mm, come with me,” a henchman in a red outfit allowed. He was likely the strongest of the four, probably as strong as some of the reputable teachers at the Alps Institute!

The man had been standing with the other servants all along, so Headmistress Perry assumed he was just a normal henchman. She finally realized how strong the man was when he started to display some hostility toward them!

Ceylan went into Herr Casa’s room. The place was in a great mess. The expensive antiques were smashed on the floor. Even the bed that Herr Casa was lying on was messy. A woman in her thirties was slowly cleaning up the mess, not daring to make a sound.

Ceylan glanced at the unconscious Herr Casa. She was left speechless when she noticed the obvious black veins along Herr Casa’s neck.

“I’ve already notified the clan; our elder will be here soon. If the young duke is fine, the Casas will no longer have anything to do with the Alps Institute, but if anything happens to the young duke, the whole Alps Institute will be going down with him!” the henchman said angrily.

“Who did he come into contact with?” Ceylan asked sternly, totally ignoring the henchman’s threatening words.

“No one else, apart from your people,” the henchman said.

“How did you not notice anything if you are with him at all times?” Ceylan asked.

“What did you mean by that? Do you think we would hurt our young master?” the henchman grunted.

“It’s not something we would do, either! Besides, we need the young duke’s support! There’s no reason for us to set him up. It’s a very complicated combination of Poison and Curse magic! If you keep being suspicious of us and don’t tell us everything, it will be very difficult for me to save his life!” Ceylan stated.

“Humph!” the old henchman harrumphed coldly, but his rationality told him that he still needed the Healer’s help to ease Herr Casa’s pain...

—

Ceylan came out of the room with a grim face.

Headmistress Perry immediately asked about it, but Ceylan told her they should discuss it somewhere else. The group moved over to the meeting room.

“What exactly is going on?” Headmistress Perry asked.

“Someone has poisoned Herr Casa... and placed him under a Curse!” Ceylan stated flatly.

“How is that possible!?” Headmistress Perry shrieked in dismay.

“It’s serious; it might endanger his life,” Ceylan went on.

“Miss Ceylan, you can’t deal with the Poison and the Curse?” Heidi asked in disbelief.

Ceylan was a brilliant Healer, and very good at dealing with poisons and Curses, too. She should not have any problem treating Herr Casa!

“It wouldn’t be a trouble if the poison and the Curse were separate. The poison isn’t rare; I have a way to cure it, but the problem is, the poison and the Curse are chained... the Curse Magic controls the poison, while the poison keeps applying the Curse!” Ceylan explained.

“What does that mean?” Headmistress Perry asked, confused. She was totally clueless about such things.

“It means I have to make a choice; whether I should get rid of the Curse or cure him of the poison first!” Ceylan said.

“Does it make a difference?”

“If the order is right, the young duke will be fine. If the order is wrong, it will multiply the effects of the latter a hundred times!” Ceylan replied.

“A hundred times? Wouldn’t that kill him straight away!?”

Ceylan nodded.

The group was astounded. Who could put Herr Casa under such a terrifying Curse?

The group was surprised by some rapid footsteps. They realized someone was knocking on the door after a moment.

Their hearts were racing after hearing about the Curse and the poison. Their nerves had were taut.

“Miss Brianca, you’re finally here... why are you here too? Leave, we are discussing something important!” Sheryl saw Brianca at first, but her face darkened when she saw Mo Fan behind Brianca.

Li Yu’e was with them, too, but it felt like she did not exist when she was not speaking. The others would just ignore her existence.

“What happened? What’s with the look on everyone’s face?” Mo Fan asked indifferently after seeing their reaction.

“It’s none of your business,” Sheryl said angrily.

“Let him stay, I believe this has something to do with the strange incident that happened the other day.” Ceylan went to the entrance, and slowly closed the door, signaling Mo Fan and Li Yu’e to take a seat.

Headmistress Perry was annoyed just looking at Mo Fan, not to mention she was deeply troubled by the disastrous thing that had just happened. She looked completely like a hateful old witch at this point.

Ceylan explained what had happened to Herr Casa to Brianca. Both Brianca and Mo Fan were astounded.

“How dumb is that Herr Casa? Isn’t he a Super Mage? Did he seriously let someone poison him and place him under a Curse?” Mo Fan swore.

The others could not help but agree with Mo Fan. A person with a higher cultivation would be much more sensitive toward potential dangers. How was it possible for someone to poison him and place him under such a deadly Curse so easily?

“The Curse and the poison are extremely tricky. We have to find the person that did it. Otherwise, we won’t know the proper sequence. I’m pretty sure it’s related to the incident that happened before,” Ceylan said.

“Why is that? I can’t see how the two are related?” Edith asked.

“They shared the same goal: the culprit wants the Alps Institute to be destroyed! If Herr Casa dies here, the Casas will raze this place to the ground. Even though the school won’t necessarily be any weaker, it’s still going to end up as an epic battle!” Mo Fan stated.

“Why do you sound like you are gloating over it?” Sheryl said angrily.

“Why would I be gloating over it? I have no grudge against the Alps Institute except for you, you, and you. I will never hate an entire group of people because of a few shitheads among them. Besides, what would I even get if your school goes down? Miss Brianca and I have been searching for clues to find the culprit, but not only aren’t you grateful, you still treat me with such an attitude! If Li Yu’e wasn’t my friend, if it isn’t for Miss Brianca’s beauty and sincerity, why would I bother with your shitty business!?” Mo Fan shot right back.

Headmistress Perry was enraged. She was about to lose her temper when Ceylan stopped her. Ceylan signaled Headmistress Perry with her eyes that it was more important to resolve the problem than throw a tantrum!

“I already said that the culprit has a strong hatred toward the school. You should have dealt with the matter right away, instead of concealing the truth, but none of you listened. You now find yourself at the edge of the cliff after all the trouble... forget it, now is not the time to put the blame on anyone, let’s discuss the matter first,” Mo Fan went on.

“You sounded as if you can settle it, humph!” Headmistress Perry said coldly.

“I’ve made some progress, but I need to confirm something first,” Mo Fan looked at Ceylan.

Ceylan was confused. What did Mo Fan want to confirm, and why was he directing it at her?

“Miss Ceylan, did you have another disciple before you recruited Heidi? Did she want to become the best Healer, and successfully earn the attention of the Parthenon Temple, who tried to recruit her to join the Hall of the Goddess?” Mo Fan asked in a serious voice.

Ceylan was stunned for a moment. She seemed to be acting a little unnatural.

Headmistress Perry frowned, too.

Edith was infuriated by the question, too. She pointed at Mo Fan and snarled, “Why would you bring the matter up now? Where did you hear about it? If I knew you had some ulterior motives for coming here, there’s no way Sheryl and I would have let you enter the school!”

Ceylan took a deep breath and said, “Edith, let him finish!”

“It’s quite a coincidence, too. The student’s father used to be a Mage from the Sacred Hall of Liberty. After the student died, her father betrayed the Sacred Hall of Liberty and joined the Black Vatican. He tried to kill me when I was in New York. I heard about what happened to his daughter... her father’s name was Philip, right?” Mo Fan asked.
