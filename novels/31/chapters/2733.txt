Chapter 2734: The Strongest Man in Northguard Fortress

“Be on guard!” shouted a middle-aged man in a brown military uniform from the defensive wall of the Northguard Fortress. His beard shook with the effort.

“What happened? Is a large group of Ocean Demons approaching?”

“This is the land. The Ocean Demons may not be able to take advantage of it.”

“If the Ocean Demons seize the Northguard Fortress, Licheng Island won’t have a single piece of land for us to live in anymore. We stay here because we don’t want to live in a random resettlement house in a certain base city in degradation.”

There was an army stationed in Northguard Fortress. This army was originally stationed to guard Licheng City. But Licheng City was submerged in sea water. So, they built the Northguard Fortress on slightly higher ground. It was one of the remaining few habitable cities in the Fujian area. Only the mages were left here.

Licheng City had submerged about twenty kilometers away. If the Ocean Demons were to seize the last Northguard Fortress, the soldiers, who were unwilling to leave their homes, would fight with the Ocean Demons to their deaths.

“A thunderstorm is approaching us, and it’s a hundred times stronger than before!” the veteran general said.

Support our

Right then, a lightning bolt struck down from the sky. The lightning had hit the corner of the defensive wall. The wall which was built with hard rocks shattered into pieces. The gray-white dust spiraled in air and blew towards the Northguard Fortress

The Battlemages were stunned. They had been in Licheng City for many years now but had never seen such a fierce and damaging lightning bolt.

The people in the square panicked. Some people were peeved. They thought some Lightning Element Mage had broken the rules and was causing this havoc.

“It’s an emergency! We need to evacuate!” The veteran general realized that this was not an ordinary thunderstorm.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The sounds of the lightning bolts cracking overpowered the veteran general’s shout. Soil and stones scattered in the wasteland outside Northguard Fortress, and the Pale Wandering Dragon entered the jungle in the wasteland. Sparks from the lightning bolts ignited several hundred meters of plants and trees within seconds.

......

Outside the Northguard Fortress, more and more lightning bolts appeared. They struck the land in continuation. Plants, trees and rocks were struck down and burnt. The beasts ran away in panic. The lightning bolts were unrelenting and soon the beasts were reduced to ashes.

People in the Northguard Fortress shuddered when they saw it. Although Licheng City used to have a lot of thunderstorms, they had never struck this ferociously, especially where people lived.

The lightning bolts destroyed hundreds of kilometers of flat coastal soil. The bolts that struck left a large, black hole. If hundreds of lightning bolts struck together, they would heavily damage the mountains and forests.

Northguard Fortress had at least tens of thousands of people. Even though ninety percent of the residents were Mages, they were shocked when they saw such a scene.

The military had set up the Great Barrier Formation. It was a light purple cover. There was golden light rippling on it. In the past, such a barrier covering the Northguard Fortress gave people a sense of security when the Ocean Demons attacked.

But when facing God’s condemnation, the barrier looked too thin to withstand an attack.

“Boom!”

A lightning pillar like a beam in heaven fell to the earth unintentionally. Its incredible size made people feel like it could even support the sky.

It hit the center of the Northguard Fortress. The thin barrier was pierced through. The destructive lightning bolt seemed to crush everything and made the Northguard Fortress tremble. Some Mages who were close to it turned into ashes!

“Move away!” Someone shouted.

Amid the dazzling sparkles, people caught a glimpse of a black-winged figure. It was covered in black scales and looked majestic. It rushed towards the destructive lightning pillar.

The crowd moved away, but it was the force of the terrifying magnetic explosion that lifted them. The buildings, streets, and crowds in the city were flung aside. They were powerless.

...

The veteran general was stunned. He was one of the few people who was not blown away by this lightning pillar. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Facing the lingering thunderstorm energy, he bravely walked toward the city center.

In the center of the Northguard Fortress was a large hole of more than one kilometer in diameter. Its cracks extended even farther. They spread all over the Northguard Fortress, including the defensive wall. Through the cracks on the defensive wall, they could see the devastated wilderness outside.

The energy that had blown everything was because of the thunderstorm energy generated by the powerful lightning bolt. This energy was enough to overturn the Northguard Fortress, so the full power of the destructive lightning pillar must be even more powerful.

However, the veteran general was appalled that someone had managed to block such destructive energy. They had stopped the energy from wiping out Northguard Fortress. He wondered if the person was still alive.

The veteran general walked to the hole in the center. Behind him, some Battlemages and hunters followed. They all wanted to know who had rescued them.

The strong wind blew away the smoke of the bolt and dust to every corner of the Northguard Fortress. Things became clearer.

There was a black figure in the big hole He hunched over and slowly climbed up from the debris on the ground. It certainly seemed like he was having great difficulty in moving but he was still alive!

“Oh my god! Is he the son of the lightning god?” someone exclaimed.

As the dark figure had rushed to the lightning pillar, they were sure this was the person who had blocked the lightning and saved them. That lightning pillar was powerful enough to kill thousands of people and wipe out the entire land. The person who had blocked it couldn’t really be ordinary.

“Cough. Cough. Is there any water?” The man staggered.

“I-Isn’t he the person who blocked the...?” a burly man said. He was still wearing a pair of sunglasses shattered by the thunderstorm. His sunglasses did not have any lenses anymore.

The strongest in the Northguard Fortress! Fang Xiong remembered that a young man had arrogantly published a message about being the strongest hunter in the Northguard Fortress who was looking for a team. At that time, Fang Xiong had laughed it off. But...

When Fang Xiong saw that person staggering out of the hole, he rushed forward to take a good look at him. It was him!

“There’s no doubt that you are, indeed, the strongest man in the Northguard Fortress.Master, you weren’t bragging, after all!” Fan Xiong hurriedly went over.

He helped Mo Fan out of the crater and shouted at the others. “Water, quick! Where is the water? Didn’t you hear him ask for it?”

Someone handed a glass of clean water to Mo Fan. He gratefully accepted it and poured half of it on his body and drank the rest.
