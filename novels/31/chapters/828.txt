“This shitty orb is letting out an eerie glow, it better not stir some mess again.”

Mo Fan took out the Essence Orb wrapped inside the silver cloth. The bad feeling he had toward the orb grew stronger. He had the urge to get rid of it as quickly as possible.

After settling the matter on hand, he would immediately chuck it to Mochizuki Chihaya. She could get rid of it however she wanted. Bringing the orb around felt like he was carrying a time bomb. Maybe he would end up possessed by the orb and become violent, evil, and vicious...

“Strange, why is it so cold here!” Mo Fan mumbled to himself, before he realized the water vapor in the air had turned into snow and fallen to the ground.

Mo Fan jumped onto a higher building to locate the source of the cold. He discovered the area around five hundred meters away was now covered in frost. The snow was stacking up on the buildings, and falling into the water. As he took a closer look, he realized that the water had frozen too!

“It must be her!” Mo Fan was overjoyed, as he was familiar with the frosty aura.

It seemed like he had taken the right direction. Luckily, Mu Ningxue had used her Domain, turning the water vapor into snow and spreading a layer of frost across the place. Otherwise, he would have had trouble finding her in the chaotic battlefield.

Mo Fan headed for the area and saw the Fierce Shark Demons scattered on the ice. Some were hiding in the buildings and heading for the center of the Domain.

Mo Fan moved between the tall buildings. He finally saw some ice sabers circling a relatively spacious area like a tornado. The wind was blowing a few dozen meters into the sky. The ice sabers looked like some kind of broken ice chains, serving as deadly weapons as they spun around, slaughtering the Fierce Shark Demons...

The level of the Fierce Shark Demons here felt a bit lower, unlike those that he had stumbled into when he was asking for directions.

They were clustered around in the nearby buildings, layers of ice, and in the waves waiting for the perfect time to strike. However, they were least of Mo Fan’s concerns, as his attention was attracted by a creature over ten meters tall. It was waving its spiked arms, slamming at the center of the tornado as it tried to smash the Magician casting the spell. Its overwhelming presence was rather intimidating.

“Commander-level...” Mo Fan did not hesitate when he realized how bad the situation was. He sprinted across the rooftops!

“Mu Ningxue!”

Mo Fan finally saw her. Her silver hair was eye-catching as always when the whole area was covered in frost. More shockingly, her clothes were stained red, and a puddle of blood was on the ice nearby. Mo Fan felt like he was about to explode after seeing it!

“F**k off!”

Mo Fan jumped into the sky from the building. A scorching, purple-black lightning bolt burst out of his body as he reached the highest point!

The lightning bolt descended at an angle. The infuriated Mo Fan simply used his body as a conductor to direct the Thunderbolt right at the creature.

The lightning flickered in the air, followed by a resonating rumble. It landed directly on the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s sharp-tipped leg.

“Lightning Disaster!” Mo Fan roared. The wild lightning strikes intertwined and struck the ground rapidly, forming a lightning web in an instant. Each flash generated a thunderous explosion!

The power of the fourth-tier Thunderbolt easily outmatched the rest of the Elemental Magic around. Even a Commander-level creature would suffer a great shock at the center of a Lightning Disaster. Its thick scales were unable to protect it from the lightning fully! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Standing in the middle of the lightning strikes, Mo Fan felt the Lightning Nebula in his Spiritual World shaking hard, as if the little Nebula was unable to endure Mo Fan’s bold move of attracting lightning using his own body.

Mo Fan was too busy to notice the change of the Lightning Nebula. His only thought was to chop the creature in front of him into pieces!

“You are no match for it...” a strange voice spoke in Mo Fan’s mind. “If you don’t want the creature to hurt her, have a taste of my power. The sea monster is nothing worth mentioning against my power!”

The voice sounded enticing, and was particularly clear when a person’s emotions were at their limit.

“Piss off!” cursed Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was not in the mood to chat with the voice that appeared out of nowhere. He knew that the Lightning Disaster was nowhere enough to defeat the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast. He totally ignored the voice trying to entice him, as he clearly knew it was from the evil orb wrapped in the silver cloth, even if he was using his ass to think!

“Telekinesis!” Mo Fan’s eyes glowed silver. He clenched his hands into claws, grabbing at the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast paralyzed by the Lightning Disaster.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s temporarily unable to move. The illusionary claws forcibly lifted it into the air.

As Mo Fan shoved his hands, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was tossed away in a roll before slamming heavily into the buildings lined up nearby. The ice covering the buildings was completely shattered!

Not far away, the injured Hirose was dumbfounded as he watched.

-How violent is that Magician? Did he seriously throw the ten-meter-tall Blue Valley Ferocious Beast away with just his hands?

-No, that doesn’t sound right, that’s the power of the Space Element!-

It was impossible for a Magician to possess such strength, but it was possible for a Space Magician to cast Telekinesis on the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast and forcibly toss it!

Hirose was shocked. He had recently bumped into a Space Magician, and he had stumbled into one again today. That being said, the Space Magician in front of him was rather wild with his approach!

“Mo...Mo Fan?”

Mu Ningxue withdrew the wind around herself and stared at the man covered in lightning in bewilderment.

The Space Element!

The spell that Mo Fan cast was clearly the Space Element! Silver glow, it was the same move that Ai Jiangtu always used!

“Little Flame Belle!” Mo Fan was in a violent rage. He had no intention of concealing his strength. He immediately summoned Little Flame Belle to lend him a hand!

Little Flame Belle immediately engulfed her petite figure in fierce flames as she came out from the Contracted Space, turning herself into a giant fireball. She directly rammed into the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast before it managed to rise to its feet!

The fireball was at least four meters wide. Their collision resulted in a great explosion. Its light filled up the entire main street, and the ice began to melt from the overwhelming heat.

“Black Snake Armor! Blood Tabi!”

Mo Fan was clearly in a frenzy. He summoned his equipment and acted as if he was going to brawl with the monster!
