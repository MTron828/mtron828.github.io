Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I need help! Mu Bai! Mu Bai!” Zhao Manyan’s high-pitched rang out from the stadium.

Mu Bai glanced at the students. “Mages like us are exposed to higher risks compared to you. I might as well take care of our survival before yours first.”

The students were stunned. The next moment, Mu Bai had vanished out of their sight.

“The Ocean Demons target the mages, especially those with a high level of cultivation. They didn’t discover us for a very long time. This means that our method is effective,” said the boy who had spoken to Mu Bai before.

“But how long are we going to hide here?”

“We must find a way to leave this place. Black Alert means there’s no way out.”

…

It was clear that the stadium was the most dangerous place of all. The reason Mu Bai had abandoned the helpless students was because he would only be endangering them more if he had brought them with him.

After Mu Bai entered the stadium, it was only then that he found the stadium was covered by a layer of white membrane. When he saw the building from afar, he thought that was the stadium’s original architectural design. The distorted shape looked exactly like a huge white egg!

Mu Bai followed Zhao Manyan’s voice. The inner space of the stadium was extremely bright. When the light shone, the inner space of the stadium was glaring, as if sunlight emanated from that one person who was submerged in the water. It looked surreal.

“Old Zhao, I can hear you, but I can’t see you!” Mu Bai shouted.

“D*rn you! Go deeper into the stadium! Hurry up! I can’t hold the Ocean Demons back for much longer!” Zhao Manyan said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Mu Bai was relieved after hearing Zhao Manyan cursing him. But many Ocean Demons imitated human language to lure people into their trap. The Ocean Demons were much more intelligent than the demons on the dry lands.

Mu Bai was worried that the colossal white demon had deliberately set up this trap for him so that it could kill him when he reached the place…

As Mu Bai went deeper into the stadium, he was appalled. Every person was wrapped in white gooey thing, like pitiful insects stuck on a spider web. Their eyes were wide with fear. They were still alive, but it wouldn’t be long before they were swallowed whole.

They were hanging upside down all over the stadium. There were many of them. Countless tiny white maggots crawled around them. The maggots looked disgusting. Some of the maggots crawled into the people’s eyes and ears. When the maggots left their orifices, they became fatter. But the person became old.

There was a translucent white web above Mu Bai’s head that was dangling in mid-air. The web was filled with Ocean Maggots. The fattened maggots always crawled toward the same place, as orderly as ants. However, Mu Bai did not see their destination.

“May I know who Mr. Bai Mei is?” Mu Bai looked up and asked the human chrysalises in the stadium.

Coincidentally, a human chrysalis less than fifty meters from Mu Bai, dangling in mid-air, moved vigorously. It swung into an arc and almost hit the human chrysalis next to it.

Mu Bai approached the swinging human chrysalis without hesitation. The golden silkworms in his hand crawled toward the human chrysalis.

The white Ocean Maggots fled. They seemed to be afraid of the golden silkworms.

When the golden silkworms reached the human chrysalis, they bit the white gooey substance and released the trapped human. The person’s whole body was wet and sticky. He continued to vomit out the maggots and parasites.

“Let the golden silkworms go into your body. They can kill all the maggots,” said Mu Bai.

It was clear that Mr. Bai Mei was reluctant. After all, those disgusting maggots had just crawled all over him not too long ago.

“The Ocean Maggots suck organs’ vitality. I’m going to restore your organs so that you won’t grow old so rapidly. If you delay, you won’t be able to recover,” Mu Bai emphasized his words.

Mu Bai had learned a lot of skills from the shaman tribe at Andeas. He had once witnessed the type of bug that sucked human organs’ vitality. He recognized the white maggots at a glance.

Mr. Bai Mei nodded in resignation. Mu Bai gave him some clean water so that he could wash himself and clear his throat.

“Why the hell are you not here yet?!” Zhao Manyan shouted from above.

Mu Bai heard the sound of fighting as soon as he entered the stadium. However, he did not have the slightest sense of urgency about this.

Fortunately, Zhao Manyan was there to take on the Ocean Demons so that he could take the opportunity to find Dean Xiao’s whereabouts.

“We came to look for Dean Xiao. The Magic City is in a deep crisis. We can’t save anyone. We might not even be able to leave here safely. But if we find Dean Xiao, the Magic City still stands a chance to survive,” Mu Bai said straightforwardly, hoping that Mr. Bai Mei was an understanding person.

Mr. Bai Mei heaved a sigh, then looked at the stadium that was filled with human chrysalises. The human chrysalises were students and teachers from Pearl Institute. But he was powerless to save them at the moment.

“The Forbidden Curse Association summoned Dean Xiao, they should be somewhere near the Bund. I have a way to contact him. But what about the people here? How can I stand by while the Ocean Demons torture them?” Mr. Bai Mei was distraught. He did not know what he could do to save the students of Pearl Institute.

“The Ocean Demon is sucking those with a cultivation base to feed its unhatched eggs. The procedure will last about a week. You don’t have to worry about them right now. They won’t die. They will be well protected by the owner of the nest,” Mu Bai said calmly.

Still, Mr. Bai Mei looked restless. He did not find Mu Bai’s words to be a relief.

“What can I do for you?” asked Mr. Bai Mei.

“I need you to find Dean Xiao. It’s not entirely a bad thing for them to remain in this kind of situation. If they go outside the stadium, the Ocean Demons would most likely tear them to shreds,” said Mu Bai.

The moment Mu Bai entered the white lair, he had been thinking about the purpose of its existence. It was not until he saw the maggots that he was enlightened.

It was no wonder they had not seen even a single corpse on their way here. The colossal white demon that had woven the white lair and treated every living person as a resource. It needed living people as a source of vitality for its next generation of offspring!
