“Time to continue, I’m done resting. It’s time to give these things some wild blasts!” Mo Fan returned to the high ground on the library.

The students were still firing their spells at the strait from above the library. However, the damage inflicted by their Intermediate Spells was fairly limited. The number of Scarlet Soaring Demons they had killed until now was still less than what Mo Fan had killed with a single Super Lightning Spell!

Their eyes glittered when they saw Mo Fan had returned, especially Lin Du.

“Brother Mo Fan, you’re back,” Lin Du greeted warmly.

Mo Fan felt a little awkward when he heard how the man addressed him. Imagine a man in his sixties calling a young man in his twenties ‘brother’. How were the rest of the directors and teachers in their forties going to feel?

“Senior, we still need your help to hold the lines.” The teacher with the Wind Element sensibly changed the way he addressed Mo Fan.

They had around a hundred people, yet their damage could not even match a single spell from Mo Fan. His strength definitely deserved their respect, regardless of their age difference.

“Senior, do you already have two Elements at the Super Level? Are those wolves yours too?” a female student who was resting asked in admiration.

“You’ve truly embarrassed us all. Even with us all combined, we are still not as good as you. Your strength is comparable to a troop of soldiers!” Lin Du sincerely expressed how impressed he was.

When they were fighting the Number One Disastrous Beast, Super Mages like Lin Du felt like there was nothing they could do. They were unable to locate the enormous beast’s weaknesses, and they were afraid of dying to the beast. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, Mo Fan had managed to Seal one of its bone whips, or more Super Mages might have died in the battle.

Even now, Lin Du could not help but admit how strong Mo Fan was after witnessing his Lightning and Summoning Elements.

“Not really, my destructive spells could only do so much too if it weren’t for your help,” Mo Fan replied humbly.

Mo Fan’s Lightning Element was running out of enough energy for him to use the Super Spell. He could only Cast it twice more at most. Unfortunately, there was no one with the Blessing Element among them. If someone like Xinxia was around to replenish his energy, he might be able to fire a few more blasts at the sea monsters. He would be able to kill around three thousand Scarlet Soaring Demons before they even reached the island!

The number of sea monsters that were entering the island was currently at its highest. Mo Fan fired two Super Lightning Spells at the strait and eliminated around seven hundred more Scarlet Soaring Demons. The mouth of the strait was choked with the dead bodies of Scarlet Soaring Demons. Not only were the students dumbfounded, even the military and the members of the Magic Association at Gaoqi Airport and Jimei Bridge were astounded.

“The energy of my Lightning Element has depleted. I can only use my Fire Element from here on.” Mo Fan took a deep breath. His face was a little pale.

“You should get some rest. Even though different Elements have a different energy supply, you will still wear yourself out if you keep using your magic. I can see that you’re a little overdrawn,” Lin Du said.

“I’m fine, my Fire Element won’t consume a lot of my energy. Oh, can I ask you something? I keep detecting an unusual aura from the school. I believe it’s Dark Magic. Is there a special place brimming with its energy in the school?” Mo Fan asked.

Mo Fan had sensed a strong dark Aura after he arrived at Jimei University. It was not an evil presence, but a pure source of dark energy. It was coming from the hill behind the library.

“You’re very sharp. Our school does indeed have a Dark Moon Pavilion. An ancient scholar built it to collect the dark energy over time, thus our school’s Dark Magic is quite outstanding, especially the Shadow Element. Unfortunately, our Shadow Mages can’t really do much in a battle like this,” Lin Du said.

“My Fire Element is greatly hindered due to the environment. It won’t be as effective as the Lightning Element, but the sea monsters are still invading the island. If we don’t control their numbers, it will result in huge casualties, so I’m wondering if I should try using the Shadow Element...” Mo Fan said.

“The Shadow Element? It’s not a destructive Element, though?” Lin Du and Deng Yongchuan were confused by Mo Fan’s suggestion.

“I have a Dark Material that can attack the enemy, but it needs time to spread and grow...” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan’s Dark Material was similar to the Plant Element, which required the Mage to plant seeds under the ground and wait for them to sprout and their roots to grow. Mo Fan was unable to spread his Dark Material two kilometers away and form the Swamp of Darkness in the area where the sea monsters were.

“We haven’t seen a lot of offensive Dark Material before, but if you can do it, we are willing to provide you with the dark energy. It is possible to share the Dark Moon Pavilion’s energy. I will go and get the Dark Moon Crystal for you!” Lin Du immediately turned around.

“Director Lin, I don’t think that’s a good idea...” Deng Yongchuan was a little hesitant.

Deng Yongchuan was obviously going to hesitate since the Dark Moon Pavilion needed a long time just to refine a single Dark Moon Crystal. It was the most valuable possession of Jimei University. They would only use it on occasions when their school was being assessed!

How could they give away their treasure so easily?

“Now isn’t the time to keep it to ourselves! Brother Mo Fan isn’t obliged to help Xiamen in the first place, yet he’s willing to risk his life for us. Are we going to wait until the city is destroyed just because we want to hold on to the Dark Moon Crystal?” Lin Du said righteously.

Lin Du had obviously recognized Mo Fan. He knew Mo Fan was the student who had won the World College Tournament.

“Err, I’m only borrowing its energy. Why do you sound like I’m going to destroy it?” Mo Fan asked with a confused face.

“Brother Mo Fan, you might not know this, but the Dark Moon Pavilion is a tower that absorbs the energy of the moon. Normally, students can cultivate in it to boost their efficiency, but its greatest power is the ability to refine a Dark Moon Crystal when there’s sufficient moonlight. The crystal contains an enormous amount of pure dark energy, but the tower has only produced a single crystal over the past few years. Your Shadow Element will improve greatly if we give it to you! However, it’s more of a consumable, so it will be gone once you use it...However, we are willing to give it away if you can take out another wave of those sea monsters. Besides, you won the World College Tournament for our country. You have more right than anyone else to claim the Dark Moon Crystal!” Lin Du explained.
