BANG!

A Fiery Fist landed on the ground with an explosion, setting some of Third Wolf’s fur on fire.

Third Wolf jumped around in pain from the burn. He quickly rolled on the ground to put out the flames. He saw a lightning bolt coming at him as soon as he lifted his head.

Third Wolf quickly jumped to the side to dodge the Thunderbolt. To his surprise, the Thunderbolt suddenly changed its angle as it was coming in. It went right where Third Wolf was dodging to. It looked like Third Wolf was jumping right at the Thunderbolt. He might have been fine if he remained in his previous spot!

Third Wolf almost burst into tears. He was a Commander-level creature known for his agility and speed, yet why was he struggling to dodge these simple spells?

Did these spells have their own eyes? How were they following where he was going?

“That’s enough, you may return now.” Mo Fan had enough practice. He contentedly sent the Moon-Devouring White Wolves back to the Summoned Beast Plane.

Third Wolf was utterly relieved, and quickly went back to his den.

It was simply too terrifying. His master was just too powerful. Why did he choose him, when there were ten other Moon-Devouring White Wolves!?

“If even the Moon-Devouring White Wolves can’t dodge the spells, many Wind Mages will struggle to dodge them too!” Mo Fan mumbled to himself.

Mo Fan was very pleased with the outcome of the training. Not only did he discover how magical the Chaos Element was, he had even learned a little trick when practicing it on the White Wolf.

The Chaos Element was similar to the Shadow Element. He was able to tag his target with a Seal of Order!

A Shadow Element Seal was normally used to track down a target, while the Seal of Order was like adding a magnet to the enemy. Mo Fan was casting his Elemental Spells and enchanting them with magnetism; his spells would lock onto the target, even if the target had changed its position or tried to dodge the spells. The Seal of Order would still attract the spells to the target!

This ability was very important. If Mo Fan was purposely modifying a spell’s path, he would have to focus and figure out where the target might be dodging to before controlling the spell to chase down the target. However, with this ability, Mo Fan only needed two simple Seals to get his spells to chase the target on their own...

It was similar to the difference between automatic and manual transmission. The situation of a battle would change rapidly. A single mistake might end up costing him the fight. Therefore, Mo Fan did not necessarily have the time and energy to improve the accuracy of his spells. After all, he was unable to mind three things at once, unlike Heidi.

However, with the Seal of Order, Mo Fan believed he could instantly raise the accuracy of his spells to the maximum level. He no longer had to be wary of an enemy with outstanding agility.

“If it can manipulate the path of the spells, I wonder if it can manipulate them, too?” Mo Fan suddenly had a brilliant idea.

Mo Fan closed his eyes. His body began to emit the same strange glow. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Little Flame Belle was done eating her chicken wings, and feeling a little sleepy. She flew toward Mo Fan and was planning to take a nap on his shoulders. She had completely forgotten about how Mo Fan had asked her to practice diligently.

Little Flame Belle had the Space Element too, and her control of it was quite outstanding. She was very good at flying around.

When she flew over to Mo Fan, she happened to pass the zone of darkness around him, which resembled an eclipse. Little Flame Belle suddenly floated higher as she was flying toward him. She reached a height more than ten meters above Mo Fan before she realized it.

Little Flame Belle was puzzled. She only realized something was not right after reaching her current height. She tried to look for Mo Fan, and saw Mo Fan was right below her.

Little Flame Belle tried her best to descend, but ended up flying higher instead. Little Flame Belle was absolutely mad. The flames engulfing her were on the verge of exploding!

“You can come down now; I was doing an experiment!” Mo Fan was amused by Little Flame Belle’s reaction again.

Mo Fan reverted his manipulation on the order of space around Little Flame Belle. She quickly landed on Mo Fan’s shoulder after gravity was reapplied to her. Meanwhile, the dark ring of sand floating in the air around Mo Fan fell to the ground.

Little Flame Belle seemed extremely puzzled, and waited for Mo Fan’s explanation.

“I just reversed the order of gravity,” Mo Fan explained.

Little Flame Belle nodded like she only understood half of that.

Mo Fan did not think Little Flame Belle could understand it. It was no different from mumbling to himself.

Mo Fan had indeed reversed the force of gravity. There were many ways to manipulate the natural order, and Mo Fan would need time to slowly figure it out. As for practicality, when compared to the Projectile Slice and Projectile Seal, Gravity Reverse was quite powerful, too!

He now had two Elements to alter gravity. One was the Earth Element, which was able to accumulate the Earth Magic in its surroundings to modify the soil and strengthen gravity. The other was the Space Element: accumulating the force of gravity on a certain point through compression. It could strengthen gravity, too.

The Chaos Magic did not produce any energy. It could only manipulate the natural order of things.

For example, gravity was meant to be downward, but it could be reversed under the influence of the Chaos Magic and became upward instead. Everything under the influence of Order Manipulation: Gravity Reverse would be floating instead!

“Old wolf, come out here!”

Mo Fan finally Summoned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf thought he had dodged a bullet, but Mo Fan still ended up Summoning him to be his sandbag. Luckily, he had asked Third Wolf beforehand and learned the experiment was mostly about some Basic and Intermediate Spells that would not inflict too much damage on him.

“Ask some White-Marked Wolves to come out here too,” Mo Fan told the Flying Creek Snow Wolf. He proceeded to open the Summoning Gate.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf did as he was told. He Summoned around ten White-Marked Wolves to him. These White-Marked Wolves were very obedient. They would strictly do as they were told when their leader was around.

“Ask them to stand still in a circle around me,” Mo Fan commanded.

“Awoo!!”

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled and ordered the thirteen White-Marked Wolves to stand in their positions like a military instructor.

Mo Fan grinned when he saw them in position.

“Blink!”

Mo Fan cast the Advanced Space Spell, and was covered in a silver light.

As the silver Star Constellation drifted away like dust, Mo Fan vanished into thin air, too!

The White-Marked Wolves suddenly noticed Mo Fan’s outline appearing in a different spot between them before they could react. However, the area that Mo Fan had arrived in underwent some unexpected changes!

“Levitate!”

The White-Marked Wolves were lifted off the ground after losing their footing.

When someone lost their stability, they were supposed to fall to the ground, yet they were rising into the air instead. Mo Fan had brought a new order upon the area!

It felt like they were being pulled into the air by an enormous force. The White-Marked Wolves cried in alarm as they rose into the sky!
