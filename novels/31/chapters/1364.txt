“How are those things so strong!?” Chang Yi was astounded, staring at the dead Summoned Beasts. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In the past, the Warrior-level Beijiang Desolate Beasts had not stood a chance against their Summoner Troop. Didn’t that mean each of the Yoked was stronger than a Warrior-level creature?

If that was the case, how could they possibly defend the Northguard Fortress?

“They are coming!” the aide-de-camp said with a grim look. He was clueless about how they should continue the battle. They had no clue what their enemy was capable of, apart from their formidable strength.

“Fire Squads, the Fire Pool!” Commander Bin Wei said.

The order quickly spread among the soldiers. The Fire Mages of the Northguard Fortress quickly went forward and drew Star Patterns.

One Fiery Fist after another poured down from the walls of the fortress like small meteorites, slamming heavily onto the yellow land.

The Fiery Fists concentrated on a specific area where the density of the Yoked was higher. The flames blasted and burned the Yoked that were leading the way. The pits that the Fiery Fists produced soon combined into a huge scorching pool of flames!

The flames intertwined and burned vigorously within the huge pool. The Yoked were stuck in the pool. Their chains were blazing red from the heat. Their skin was like wilted trees, and began to crack open.

However, the Yoked continued forward like they did not feel any pain from the flames that were burning over them!

Many of the Yoked were engulfed in flames, but they did not seem to be bothered at all. Their eyes retained a terrifying glow, staring at the Northguard Fortress.

The flames actually made the Yoked look more ghastly, like demons crawling out of the furnace of Hell. The watchers trembled in fear upon witnessing the sight. They had been through countless battles, yet they never felt so helpless facing an enemy!

“It doesn’t work at all. Why aren’t the flames working?”

“What kind of monsters are they...”

The Yoked resumed their marching. The pressure on the soldiers intensified as the demon frog with the demeanor of a greedy tyrant approached. The soldiers began to shuffle uneasily.

“Fire at will!” Commander Bin Wei ordered.

Almost every Mage cast their spells, mostly Elemental Magic. There were rolling rocks and sand along the ground, burning fists flying across the sky, tornadoes, lightning, and fierce tides and icy chains that appeared out of nowhere lunged at the creatures murderously...

The clanking of the chains kept coming. The creatures were still moving forward, like they did not know what pain was. Even when their legs were broken, they would continue to crawl forward with their hands, like a bunch of fanatical death-sworn soldiers!

The Mages were clueless about what to do against these creatures. The Beijiang Desolate Beasts would end up as pieces of meat and pools of blood scattered across the ground, or flee for their lives. Meanwhile, these underworld creatures were still pushing forward. They would soon reach the fortress!

“It’s no use, we even tried using Advanced Spells against them, but we still couldn’t take them out!” Chang Yi began to panic.

“Two thousand creatures that are stronger than Warrior-level creatures, and a Ruler-level demon frog. I don’t think we stand a chance against them unless we have several Super Mages with us!” the aide-de-camp exclaimed.

The Battlemages had immediately cast their spells at the enemy after receiving the order. It was supposed to deal the highest damage to the enemy. After all, the Northguard Fortress had a lot of Intermediate Mages. The endless blasts were expected to kill a lot of Warrior-level creatures.

But the number of deaths among the Yoked was extremely low. Some did fall to their deaths, yet the overall size of their army still looked the same. One could easily tell which side had the upper hand in the battle!

The doubts and disdain that the soldiers had when they first received the order to enter red alert state were replaced by panic and fear. Some of them even made mistakes when casting their spells under the enormous pressure.

“Tell the cities to the south of Northguard Fortress to start the first-level evacuation!” Bin Wei said to the aide-de-camp.

“The first-level evacuation?” The aide-de-camp was stunned.

Was the order really necessary? Wouldn’t they only evacuate all the cities during a great calamity?

“Do as I say!” Bin Wei repeated sternly.

The aide-de-camp was shocked. He glanced at the Yoked that seemed to be unharmed...

She was right; if their Northguard Fortress, known to have the strongest defense in the north, was struggling to eliminate these underworld creatures, how could the rest of the cities stand a chance against them?

Once these creatures broke through Northguard Fortress, many cities would be destroyed, resulting in insane casualties!

The fact that the evacuation order was given when the battle had only started indicated that the attack the fortress was facing was no ordinary invasion. It was likely to be an unstoppable disaster!

“But even if we give the cities the order to evacuate, they still need time to evacuate the people!” Chang Yi said.

Chang Yi did not think the evacuation order was inappropriate. The Yoked were a lot stronger than they had imagined. Even an army ten times the size might struggle against the army of undead. It was very likely that Northguard Fortress would fall this time!

“If these foreign creatures of the underworld think they can overrun Northguard Fortress easily, they have made a huge mistake!” Bin Wei snapped coldly.

Her face showed no signs of defeat. The truth was, most of the soldiers had lost their confidence after seeing how tenacious the creatures were, but Commander Bin Wei never did.

She had asked the cities behind the fortress to evacuate because she had a feeling the invasion of these underworld creatures was not as simple as it seemed. She could not afford to endanger the cities and the civilians, but it did not mean she was left with no choice!

It was impossible for the Yoked to be so strong that their defense was comparable to half a Commander-level creature. If they were truly as strong as Commander-level creatures, how were they only slaves?

There must be some special power that granted these Yoked such abnormal tenacity...

“I won’t let you come any closer to my Northguard Fortress!” Bin Wei grabbed her military coat and flung it aside.

She rose into the air, her graceful figure springing into the sky above the fortress. An enormous devil lily blossomed in front of the fortress and grew to a height that was taller than the fortress in just a few seconds...

Bin Wei landed on the enormous lily. She briefly glanced at the Yoked before fixing her gaze on the ancient wall in front of the fortress!

The ancient wall was lying like the backbone of a mountain range. It was a magnificent mountain that suddenly erupted along the horizon, further extending a few kilometers into the distance. It was utterly spectacular.

As a matter of fact, the Yoked were able to climb over the ancient wall easily. It was just like Zhao Manyan mentioned, it was a mere decoration.

But was the Great Wall really just a decoration?

“Entrance-Sealing Formation!”

Bin Wei’s eyes gradually turned gray, the same color as the ancient wall. Meanwhile, the ancient wall began to rise rapidly!

The ancient wall suddenly rose thirty meters high within seconds, and continued to rise higher still...
