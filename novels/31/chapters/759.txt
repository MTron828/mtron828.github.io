She was asking him for names again! Mo Fan shivered when he heard the girl’s question.

Mo Fan’s lips twitched slightly. He was lost for words when he tried to respond to the seemingly innocent, harmless girl. He finally forced a smile after a few seconds and said, “Her name is quite complicated, I’m afraid you won’t remember it. By the way, I have a friend who suddenly fainted. His entire body turned extremely cold too. Since you have been around here for a long time, do you know the reason behind it?”

Mo Fan did not accuse her straightaway. The truth was, he was still unsure if she was responsible for what had happened to Zhao Manyan. Even if she was the culprit, Mo Fan believed there was no need for him to fall out with her straight away if she dared to show up again.

Of course, most importantly, Mo Fan still did not quite understand the situation. He had no idea how he could subdue her and how was she going to resolve Zhao Manyan’s situation.

“Your friend? Which one?” said Miyata, while blinking her eyes, as if she knew nothing about it.

“I don’t think you’ve met him. Golden hair, he’s quite handsome, but not as handsome as I am... (sigh) anyway, do you know what happened to him?” Mo Fan began to act dumb.

Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue was looking at Mo Fan having a monologue with a weird expression.

The truth was, Mo Fan totally looked like he was bewitched when he was talking and smiling like there was actually someone in front of him.

However, Mu Ningxue did not say anything.

Even though she had lots of question marks in her mind, she was used to figuring out things on her own. It was unnecessary to ask questions if she figured it out on her own, but even when she failed to comprehend it by herself, she still did not bother to ask questions.

It was obvious that Mo Fan had stumbled into the invisible girl he mentioned before. He was currently conversing with the girl, and from Mo Fan’s response, she was able to guess what the girl was saying.

-Why is he the only one that can see the girl?-

That was the biggest doubt that troubled Mu Ningxue the most.

“I have no idea, maybe your friend has caught a strange disease, I heard that someone else has caught the same disease before, and no one is able to find a cure for it...” said Miyata softly.

Mo Fan looked at her helplessly. It was difficult to link her innocent expression with his imagination of a harmful Soul Eater...

“I’ll be honest with you, I lied to you the other day. My name isn’t Zhao Manyan, it’s the name of my friend who fainted. I have heard rumors about a Soul Eater around here, and my friend seems to have lost his soul, not long after I told you his name,” Mo Fan probed further when he saw that the girl was still pretending to be innocent.

Miyata immediately realized what Mo Fan was hinting. She frowned and looked at Mo Fan with a complicated expression, “Are you implying that I have something to do with it?”

Mo Fan said while nodding, “I do hope that it has nothing to do with you. I’m hoping that you can help my friend recover.”

Miyata glanced at Mu Ningxue down the slope and said with a self-mocking grin, “Is that why you’re unwilling to tell me her name?”

“Well...” Mo Fan was lost for words. The upset look on the girl’s face was convincing Mo Fan that she was not the culprit, yet his instincts were telling him that she was somehow related because she was like a ghost haunting the temple.

“You didn’t trust me at the start, you’re afraid that I will hurt you, so you gave me a fake name, is that right?” said Miyata, as if her feelings were hurt.

“Nope,” responded Mo Fan.

“You’re afraid that I will hurt her, so you’re not willing to tell me her name, right?” said Miyata.

“That’s not it,” Mo Fan shook his head and said sternly, “First of all, there’s something strange about you. The reason I gave you my friend’s name is because I assumed it would not make a difference. If I thought you were dangerous from the start, I would give you my name instead. I’m not the kind that would put my friend in danger.”

The hurt look in Miyata’s eyes gradually disappeared after she heard Mo Fan’s explanation. She had captured a hint of sincerity from Mo Fan’s eyes. “How about this, I’ll help your friend to recover, but I won’t do a favor for someone who doesn’t trust me. To prove that you trust me, you must tell me her name.”

Miyata was very smart despite her innocent look.

She realized that Mo Fan was afraid to give her names, because the last time he gave her someone’s name, the person had fallen unconscious. Therefore, Mo Fan would have to give her another name to earn her trust.

Mo Fan was immediately troubled by the condition!

He looked at Mu Ningxue who was looking back at him with a confused look.

“You can ask her for her opinion,” said Miyata.

Mo Fan was indeed troubled. Normally, the hot-tempered Mo Fan would simply beat the crap out of Miyata instead of wasting his time talking to her. She was most likely responsible for Zhao Manyan’s situation...

However, he did try while talking to the girl. There was something strange about her. He was unsure if he could use his magic on her. Since he was left with no choice, he could only proceed with caution.

Mo Fan returned to Mu Ningxue and told her about Miyata’s request.

“She wants to know my name?” said Mu Ningxue.

“Mm, I think it’s better for us to leave this place. There’s something strange about the girl... we’ll deal with her again when we’ve thought of a way,” Mo Fan was tricked the first time. He would not put Mu Ningxue’s life in danger.

“Do you think she’s responsible?” asked Mu Ningxue in a serious voice.

“I believe so, she might be tricking me to tell her your name. For some reason, she might only be able to do the act after someone gives her the target’s name,” said Mo Fan.

“I think we can try,” said Mu Ningxue.

“Don’t do it, we still haven’t figured out what happened to Zhao Manyan, if the same thing happened to you...” said Mo Fan.

“I think the others won’t be able to find any useful information to save Zhao Manyan. Use my name as bait; if nothing happens to me, didn’t she promise that she will help us save Zhao Manyan? If something did happen to me, at least you’ll know who the culprit is. As for what the next step is... Nan Rongni already mentioned that the strange disease won’t kill us in a short time,” said Mu Ningxue.

They were indeed puzzled by the situation. It was obviously more effective to seek the answers from the girl than using other ways. As such, she agreed to put herself at risk to find out the truth!

“If that’s the case, I’ll give her my name instead!” said Mo Fan.

“No way, only you can see her and talk to her. In other words, if she’s really the one, only you can deal with her!” rebuked Mu Ningxue.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
