“One-Word Slash!”

The lotus of death blossomed silently under the woman’s foot. Asha’ruiya shuddered, before a sword glow sprang forward along the ground, aiming for Mu Ningxue’s weak point. It was as quick as lightning, and difficult to defend against.

A cut as thin as a string surfaced on Mu Ningxue’s body. The strange thing was, there was no blood jetting out from the cut. It had sliced her body in half instead...

With a closer look, one would realize that it was not Mu Ningxue, but an image on a mirror of ice. The slash had sliced the ice in half, and Mu Ningxue was standing on the other side.

Mu Ningxue wanted to trick Asha’ruiya so she could activate the ice chains she had buried under the ground to trap her opponent. Unfortunately, Asha’ruiya was just too quick. When the ice chains sprang up from the ground, Asha’ruiya was already on the other end. The ice chains did not even touch the corner of her clothes!

“Awoo!” The Flying Creek Snow Wolf no longer had an opponent. He charged at Asha’ruiya and waved his claws fiercely, summoning ice spikes to emerge from the ground. Even though he did not land his attack on her, the ice spikes continued to emerge across an area of two hundred meters. Asha’ruiya had no choice but to use Blink to dodge the ice spikes!

“Darkmoon Slash!”

Asha’ruiya stood in the distance like a black statue. As dark energy was accumulated, she flung the sword forward, firing several shadowy slashes off!

The shadowy crescents were sharp and icy as they approached the Flying Creek Snow Wolf and Mu Ningxue rapidly. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf smartly stood in front of Mu Ningxue, using his body to resist the attacks, just so Mu Ningxue did not need to bother with defending herself.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was knocked flying by the energy waves, leaving a few cuts on him.

A second after the slashes dissipated, the trees near the range of the attack fell to the ground simultaneously, opening up a spacious area.

“Telekinesis!”

Asha’ruiya continued to attack. Her eyes were fixed on the fallen trees, grabbing the thick trunks with her will.

The trunks hovered in front of Asha’ruiya. With a soft groan, the trunks immediately flew at Mu Ningxue and the Flying Creek Snow Wolf at a shocking pace!

“Wind Cut!”

Mu Ningxue formed a Wind Formation, slicing and dicing in front of her. The trunks were shredded into pieces by the winds and scattered in the air like white sand.

“Space Rhythm: Sword Scars!”

Asha’ruiya stabbed the ground heavily with the sword. She glowed silver. Invisible swords started falling rapidly from the sky...

It was impossible to see the swords with the naked eye. They could only determine where the swords were falling by the energy ripples emitted by the swords. Mu Ningxue agilely dodged the rain of swords. Deep pits kept appearing inches away from her feet as the swords plunged a few meters deep into the ground...

More holes appeared along the surface. The area close to Mu Ningxue was full of holes were produced by the swords, yet it was impossible to see the swords as they were falling, since they were summoned with the Space Element!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was not attacked by the Space Swords. He sprinted along the ice at incredible speed.

A bridge of ice extended in the air. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf sprinted across the bridge. He raised his head and let out a loud howl.

Ice cones formed a ring of ice spears. Initially, the ice spears only appeared around fifty metes away from where Asha’ruiya was standing. However, the blades kept poking out from the ground, and soon filled up the ice-covered area. The spears grew rapidly and spread further away. If there were demon creatures inside the ring of spears, they would surely be impaled and killed!

Asha’ruiya had finally secured a slight advantage in the fight, yet it was ruined by the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

Sensing that she was surrounded by the ice spears, Asha’ruiya cast Blink once again to escape from the ring of sharp points.

Asha’ruiya appeared on the other side, staring at the Flying Creek Snow Wolf that was sprinting along the razor-sharp ice.

It was meaningless for her to direct her hatred at a Summoned Beast. However, it was obvious that Asha’ruiya was treating the Flying Creek Snow Wolf like the asshole, Mo Fan!

“Little foxy, did you miss me?” an annoying voice came from the woods.

Asha’ruiya immediately looked at the voice and saw Mo Fan, his upper body bare, standing there. His face was scorched black like an African, yet he was wearing a grin that was urging Asha’ruiya to kick him in the face!

“Why can’t you just die!?” Asha’ruiya was enraged as soon as she saw Mo Fan.

Most importantly, the situation was unfavorable to Asha’ruiya. Mu Ningxue was a strong opponent. Even after so long, Asha’ruiya was unable to knock her out.

Mo Fan’s Flying Creek Snow Wolf was incredibly strong too, and the wolf demon was like a tiger with wings in Mu Ningxue’s Ice Domain. The beast was as strong as an average Commander-level creature!

And now, even Mo Fan had shown up. Asha’ruiya couldn’t help but have a bad feeling!

“I’ve always been hard to kill... Xuexue, you can fight her at will. I will handle her Space Element,” Mo Fan stood a great distance away. He was not in a rush to join the battle.

He no longer had any way to defend himself. He could only harass Asha’ruiya with his will.

Asha’ruiya had an advantage in the fight because of her outstanding Space Element. Mu Ningxue would surely have struggled against the combination of her Space Element and the Dark Contract’s power without the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s help...

However, the undying cockroach Mo Fan had arrived! He was covered in wounds and injuries, and surely could not face Asha’ruiya directly. However, that did not stop him from standing at the side and harassing Asha’ruiya with his Space Element, keeping her own Space Element at bay...

If Mo Fan’s mental strength had not received an upgrade recently, it would only be strong enough to scratch Asha’ruiya’s itch. However, his mental strength had reached the fourth-level with the Stone of Will, allowing him to challenge Asha’ruiya’s Space Element!

“I’ll kill you son of a b**ch first!” Asha’ruiya cast Blink rapidly. Her hatred of Mo Fan was off the charts.

Seeing the woman approaching him so fiercely, Mo Fan yelled, “Old wolf, protect your master!”

Mo Fan was standing quite far away, so he immediately snuck into the woods with his fifth-tier Fleeing Shadow. Asha’ruiya soon lost trace of him.

When Asha’ruiya finally noticed where Mo Fan was riding, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was already lunging at her, followed by Mu Ningxue’s ice chains, forcing her to back away.

“Telekinesis!” Asha’ruiya unleashed her will to crush the ice chains surrounding her.

“Telekinesis!” At the same time, a pair of silver eyes glittered somewhere in the woods. The two forces clashed in the air, and nullified Asha’ruiya’s will!

Asha’ruiya took a deep breath. It felt like her eyes were about to spit fire!

-Goddamned Mo Fan, that jerk, shameless asshole, why can’t he show himself and fight me like a man instead of hiding in the woods!?-

“Darkmoon Slash!” Asha’ruiya completely lost her calm. She raised her sword and slashed at the woods.

The trees fell to the ground, as if hundreds of lumbermen had just finished their work. However, the black shadow was not sliced in half like the rest of the trees. It was still hiding in the distance, and even though it was not making any sound, Asha’ruiya could imagine his annoying laughter ringing in her mind!

“Mo Fan, come out here. I will concede if I land my slash on you once!” Asha’ruiya desperately wanted to vent her anger.

“If your words are trustworthy, all men in this world are trustworthy too!” Mo Fan’s voice echoed from the woods.

“I didn’t want to use this power in the tournament, but you’ve left me with no choice!” Asha’ruiya’s voice gradually turned cold.

Asha’ruiya swung her sword rapidly, forming a layer of defense around herself.

She took the black necklace from around her neck and held it tightly in her hand. A black light descended from the clouds and landed right on her...

A dark aura was emerging, in the form of some black gaseous substance rising from the ground!

The dark energy rapidly filled up the space around Asha’ruiya and turned into an enormous black tornado, driving the Ice Magic away.

The advisors among the spectators frowned upon seeing the strong aura of dark energy. They could feel a dangerous sensation lingering in the air. Even though the energy seemed fairly calm on the surface, it was extremely dangerous!

“Isn’t this breaking the rules...” The Governor of Venice had a stern look.

Haylon, the Hall Master of the Hall of Knights representing Greece, fell silent for a moment when he noticed everyone looking at him, before he spoke, “She’s just using the power of her magic Equipment, how is that against the rules?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The power that Asha’ruiya is using is clearly breaking the rules of the tournament.”

“How about Egypt? Shouldn’t their magic be forbidden, too? If you aren’t going to punish Egypt, you shouldn’t complain about us either,” Haylon immediately justified Asha’ruiya’s actions.

“Since it’s a tournament, there are surely loopholes that we might miss out on. I’m just hoping that every country will compete fairly in the tournament. We can’t really judge Egyptian team, and we won’t be able to judge Asha’ruiya either, but will it really impress the world? As a Saintess, is it really worth it for Asha’ruiya to damage her reputation...”

The dark energy had clearly exceeded the level of the tournament. Any Super Mage watching the tournament could easily tell it. The main judge immediately gave the order to the assistant judges to set up a barrier. Otherwise, the dark energy would easily injure the spectators.
