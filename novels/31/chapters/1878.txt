“Brother! I never did anything wrong to you! Why are you doing this to me!?” the fatty almost wet his pants in fear, pleading in tears.

“It’s fine, it’s going to be fine,” Mo Fan comforted him calmly.

“Help! Help me!” the fatty began screaming at the top of his lungs. He was seriously screaming for help this time.

Mo Fan felt a little awkward when he heard the scream, yet he simply dug into his ears and pretended he did not hear it. He looked around him. As he thought, the demon leeches were brainless, and would go for the closest prey after picking up their scent. A huge group of them started moving toward the fatty, including those already on the second and third floors.

The whole shopping lot could hear the fatty’s screams. It was horrendous. The man was extremely desperate. He never knew there were such shameless Mages, who were even more terrifying than the demon creatures!

The water below was bubbling. The fatty could see the demon leeches rolling around like carp waiting to be fed in a pond.

“Help...help me!” The fatty’s voice was a little hoarse now.

Mo Fan immediately withdrew his playful attitude when he saw the demon leeches nearby had gathered toward them.

He could not afford to use his spells while the demon leeches were still some distance away from the fatty, as that would only scare the demon leeches away. These sea monsters would back out of an unfavorable situation. However, he could not attack when the demon leeches were too close to the fatty, either. Not only would that endanger the fatty’s life, his spells might hurt the man too!

The demon leeches in the water finally ran out of patience. They jumped out of the water with their mouths wide open. From the fatty’s angle, he could see the demon leeches’ deep throats and the teeth along them. The teeth were initially concealed inside their necks, but they were completely exposed now. The fatty was already running out of breath from the continuous screams. He rolled his eyes and fainted when he witnessed the ghastly sight!

“Air Catapults!”

Mo Fan squinted as he controlled the airflow nearby in the corridor, turning the air into a succession of bolts with a push of his Telekinesis.

The air bolts were extremely powerful under Mo Fan’s control. They howled while traveling through the air before puncturing the demon leeches that had jumped into the air and sending them flying with blood all over the place. The demon leeches were left full of holes before they had a chance to taste the fatty’s delicious blood!

The Lightning and Fire Elements were too destructive to be used in the shopping lot, but Mo Fan could easily control the Space Element as he pleased. His will was as sharp as a sword too, which he needed to hone and use so it would stay keen at all times!

The air kept buzzing like the sound of ballistae being fired. Mo Fan was like an angler waiting for the fish to take his bait, and continued to Summon more air bolts around him. As the number of demon leeches going after the fatty increased, the number of bolts hovering in the air at Mo Fan’s sides and behind him increased too!

“Order Manipulation!”

Mo Fan soon noticed the demon leeches were starting to dodge the air bolts. Some of them were even hiding behind walls and pillars, and Mo Fan’s air bolts ended up landing on the solid surfaces. But those smartass demon leeches had no idea that the air bolts did not necessarily need to travel in straight lines, and could turn corners too! They were more like a rain of homing arrows!

Mo Fan was Summoning the air bolts rapidly by splitting his will into tens of thousand wisps. The air bolts were even deadlier after being strengthened by Space Rhythm, and would not disappear immediately after hitting their targets. They would return to Mo Fan’s side with the help of the Chaos Element and await their next order!

As more air bolts were produced while the rest continued to return to Mo Fan, the air bolts eventually formed an aura as they were flying around Mo Fan. They were either circling Mo Fan, flying around randomly, or hovering nearby while accumulating their force for the next attack.

They were almost invisible, yet they were extremely sharp!

Mo Fan was extremely focused, as it was quite difficult to control so many air bolts at once. He could not afford to shift his attention, and needed to ensure every air bolt was ready to be fired.

Mo Fan was like a juggler. Every time he produced an air bolt, it was the same as adding another ball to the juggling. He would toss the balls quickly into the air with one hand while catching the balls with the other. He also had to transfer the ball he caught to the other hand to toss them back into the air again. The balls were like elves dancing in the air while holding hands. They would rise and fall in a regular pattern.

The air bolts close to Mo Fan were in a similar situation. Even though Mo Fan could control several air bolts simultaneously, Order Manipulation could only be applied to the air bolts sequentially. He would place a Seal on an air bolt so it would return to his side later; during its flight, he would have to repeat the same thing while relaying different orders to a dozen other bolts!

The trick was an idea had Mo Fan come up with while he was practicing the Space Element. He had never used it practically before. However, he was able to master it quickly while he was fighting the demon leeches!

The fatty let out a relieved sigh after he regained consciousness. He thought he would wake up on a comfortable bed with his handsome subordinate beside him, but he almost fainted again after witnessing the gory sight below him.

The hungry demon leeches kept jumping into the air, but they were being punctured as they got within a meter of him. The fatty could not see anything hitting them, he could only hear rapid whooshes.

The man patted himself and realized his flesh was still intact. He glanced at the bully Mage who was using him as bait. The Mage was walking from the corridor to the stairs with a stern face. The demon leeches were gathering toward him, as if they were returning to their nest. The furious demon leeches were not only going to drink the fatty’s blood, but they were flanking the Mage!
