The people of the European University Institute waited in a luxurious club. Mu Bai went to prepare the antidotes, while Heidi was busy collecting the information about the species of demon creatures they might encounter during the adventure. They had no clue what the people of the European University Institute were doing. Perhaps they too were collecting information through their own sources.

“This is a club managed by the Golden Rose Clan. You can find it in the main cities, with a network of reliable and capable Mages. I believe someone will soon deliver the information about the young Medusa to us.” Ferrero was seated on a leather couch, smoking a cigar.

The man preferred to behave calmly and nobly at a time like this.

A manager of the club in a tuxedo came with some information. “Young Master, we’ve obtained some news from the people of the Magic Association. Someone has spotted a mature Medusa with the young Medusa. They were last seen around the Bargo Land.”

“Ferrero is as impressive as usual. Having power can really save us a lot of trouble. Meanwhile, someone is going around like a headless fly without doing anything useful,” Galba chuckled.

Zhao Manyan opened the map and glanced at Bargo Land. He soon burst out laughing.

Chad said with a wry smile, “The Bargo Land covers over eighty kilometers. Where do we even start looking for the young Medusa? You can easily buy information like that at the Hunter Union.”

“Humph, it’s still better than you guys who don’t even know where to look at all!” Ferrero grumbled.

“What should we do now? I don’t even dare to drink water now. We are really going to be tortured to death if we don’t find any reliable news soon,” Zoey sighed.

Everyone had grim faces. They had only arrived in Cairo a short time ago, thus they were not familiar with the environment yet. They only had limited sources of information available to them.

“It’s at the Sunset Shrine,” Mo Fan blurted out as he came into the room. His face was brimming with confidence!

Everyone looked at him. Their first reaction was not bursting into joy about finding the right location, but they were filled with strong doubts instead.

Why was the Sunset Shrine necessarily the place they were looking for? Although the Sunset Shrine was located in Bargo Land, he could not just blindly point at a spot on the map, right?

“Humph, you don’t have to share the information that you’ve obtained from a random hooker in a run-down place with us. It’s going to get us killed instead!” Ferrero said disdainfully.

“I don’t really care if you believe it or not, Heidi, Old Zhao, Green... Mu Bai, we’re heading out now. We don’t have much time, we have to reach the Sunset Shrine in four days. There are a few nests of demon creatures nearby, so it won’t be easy sneaking into it,” Mo Fan ordered.

“Mo Fan, are you sure it’s at the Sunset Shrine?” Zoey looked at Mo Fan and asked seriously. “Where did you get the information from?”

“The Hunter Union, I’m a six-star Hunter Master,” Mo Fan said.

“Ha, boast all you want, how can you possibly be a six-star Hunter Master? My uncle is a Super Mage, yet he’s not even a six-star Hunter Master!” Zoey smiled. She assumed Mo Fan was joking.

Mo Fan had already taken out his badge while Zoey was still talking.

It was impossible to fake the Hunter Badge; the stars on it were the only proof he needed. Mentor Vani purposely went closer to see if Mo Fan truly was a six-star Hunter Master. His expression changed tremendously.

It was not difficult to become a Hunter Master with their current strength, but it was a completely different story to reach five stars and above. The points from completing a few quests were not enough; they had to have some other achievements that no one could lightly accomplish, too!

Mo Fan had gone from four stars to six stars after solving the mystery of the Drowning Curse. Otherwise, even five stars would be extremely difficult for him to reach!

“The information is approved by Cairo’s Hunter Union, it’s very credible!” the old manager in a tuxedo stated after glancing at the paper Mo Fan was holding.

Ferrero rolled his eyes at the old manager in a tuxedo. The man abruptly realized Mo Fan was not his Young Master’s friend, and found himself in an awkward position.

“If he’s a six-star Hunter Master, there shouldn’t be any problem. We’ll head out tomorrow morning, or... we should have everything we need,” Vani said.

“What ‘tomorrow’?! We are going now! The young Medusa isn’t a quest NPC, it won’t wait at the same spot waiting for us to form a party to take it out. The information we have is the latest too! It’s best if we go now and find it before it goes somewhere else!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

He was utterly speechless about these people’s attitudes. If the young Medusa ended up going back to its nest because they waited until tomorrow morning, they would lose their only chance of obtaining a Tear of Medusa!

“Mo Fan is right, we should head out as early as possible. The longer we are under the Curse, the more dangerous it will be,” Zoey agreed with him. That being said, she was still shocked that Mo Fan was a six-star Hunter Master. The rank of a Hunter Master was a clear representation of their capabilities!

“Let’s head out now!” Chad agreed.

Chad had already prepared the Camel Beasts. They were a must when traveling in the desert. Otherwise, the Lamias were going to be on their tail all the time! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

General Fenna provided them with some assistance, too. She had found a kind of medicine with cleistogenes as the main ingredient that could temporarily get rid of the effects of the Curse.

However, the medicine was a double-edged sword. It could provide a person temporary relief from the Curse of the Medusa’s Eyes, but once its effects wore off, the effects of the Curse would worsen significantly. It basically meant if they could not find the young Medusa before the end of the medicine’s effects, they might die or lose their minds in but a week!

It was a trip of no return, but luckily they had found the right direction. They now had a good shot at finding the young Medusa!

“Old Zhao, go buy some Roving Desert Beetles,” Mo Fan whispered to Zhao Manyan.

“What for?” Zhao Manyan asked with a confused look.

“Just do as I say, but don’t let the others know, especially the people of the European University Institute,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan had shared the location of the young Medusa, but there was no way he would tell them this other piece of information. The people of the European University Institute were clearly unreliable. It was better for him to hold back the secret!

It was not the first time Zhao Manyan had colluded with Mo Fan. He immediately knew Mo Fan had a backup plan in mind. He left for the market when the others were not paying attention to him.

Roving Desert Beetles were not that common. They were mostly dried and consumed as medicine. Zhao Manyan spent some money buying a box of them and secretly placed it in his storage ring!
