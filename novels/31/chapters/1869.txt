Everything was still normal after they arrived at Fanxue Mountain. The guy with the strange Undead Magic did not show up again, but everyone was tense and under a lot of pressure since they had to stay alert at all times.

Mo Fan sat in the garden. The roof extended out just enough to block the fierce rain. Cold breezes swept past continuously. As Mo Fan lifted his gaze, all he could see was the curtain of rain blocking the mountains in the west and the sea in the east. Everything was dark and gloomy.

Huge raindrops were falling like bullets, splashing as they reached the ground. Mo Fan had initially planned to go for a stroll, but was instead trapped at home for two days because of the rain. Mu Ningxue happened to be away too, so Mo Fan ended up extremely bored since he could only cultivate quietly in the garden.

“The storm is a little too big,” Lingling grabbed herself a chair and sat down beside Mo Fan. She was hugging the warm Little Flame Belle and fondling her like she was a kitten.

“Yeah, it’s been a while since I last saw a storm this big,” Mo Fan agreed with a nod.

“Something bad is going to happen,” Lingling said.

“You mean Feiniao City?” Mo Fan asked.

“I’m not sure, but it’s already the third day. Not only is the storm still going, it hasn’t shown any signs of weakening,” Lingling told him.

“Are you telling me you have a bad feeling about this?” Mo Fan queried promptly.

Lingling did not respond. She was staring at the entrance like a cat with sharp eyes. Someone in a white outfit and a huge black umbrella was approaching them.

“Mo Fan!” The man took the umbrella down, and was promptly drenched in the rain. He spoke immediately, “I’m afraid I’ll need to head south.”

“Oh? Is it urgent? We still haven’t found the guy with the Undead Magic. I don’t think it’s wise to leave Fanxue Mountain now,” Mo Fan answered.

“I don’t have a choice, something serious has happened. I am currently the chief of the South Wing Platoon, and I have to go,” Mu Bai stated.

“Tell us what’s going on first,” Mo Fan cajoled him.

“Is it Xiamen?” Lingling lifted her gaze and spoke as if she could predict the future.

Mu Bai gasped, seeming a little surprised. He did not understand how Lingling knew it was Xiamen, since the information was kept confidential.

“Yeah, it’s been raining for almost three days. The seawater has already drowned the bridges to Xiamen. The whole city is submerged in water now. The water is over a meter deep in most areas. The rain doesn’t seem like it’s going to stop, either. The whole island might be drowned eventually from the rain and the seawater...” Mu Bai confirmed.

The South Wing Platoon had only received a warning, but judging from the current state of things, Xiamen might become an important breakthrough point for the sea monsters. Many divisions were assigned to stand by at Xiamen. The South Wing Platoon was there to provide them with support!

“The city of Xiamen is located on a huge island, so it is also called Xiamen Island. It’s connected to the mainland by only a few bridges. The rising sea level has already had quite a huge impact on Xiamen. Luckily, the island’s terrain has a slightly higher altitude. It did not end up like the new district in Pudong, but if the storm keeps going...” Lingling explained. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I just feel like now isn’t the best time for us to go anywhere,” Mo Fan sighed.

“We can’t just hide forever if the guy doesn’t show himself, right? If he’s really after us, the trip to Xiamen might be a good opportunity to lure him out and get rid of him, so we won’t have to stay on our toes,” Mu Bai proposed.

“Mm, I do think we shouldn’t be so passive. I’ll go with you, too. Xiamen... I actually fought there once. Isn’t the Donghai Magic Association’s headquarters located on Xiamen’s Gulangyu?” Mo Fan recalled.

“The Donghai Magic Association is the one asking for help...” Mu Bai trailed off.

They heard footsteps approaching the entrance while they were talking. They sounded like some kind of heavy boots tapping loudly on the pavement.

The three looked toward the entrance and saw a man in a military outfit. He had a tanned face and bright eyes. He initially had a stern look on his face, but his expression shifted as soon as he saw the trio in the garden. It was replaced with an excited grin.

“Brother Fan!” Zhang Xiaohou’s voice pierced through the curtain of rain.

“Houzi, why are you here? Isn’t the situation at the Qinling Mountains getting serious?” Mo Fan was surprised when he saw Zhang Xiaohou hurrying toward him.

“It’s serious, but our troop just received a higher priority order, assigning us south to Xiamen! Our aircraft was surprised by the storm an hour ago. We were struggling to fly south any further, so we were forced to land in Feiniao City. I came to visit you since the plane won’t be taking off for another hour or so.

“By the way, Brother Fan, what were the demon birds you brought to the Qinling Mountains? They are strong and fierce, and are seriously picking a fight with the White Magic Falcons, which helped to lift the burden from our shoulders. The White Magic Falcons won’t be stirring up trouble anytime soon. I thought we finally had a chance to rest, but something has happened here in the south instead,” Zhang Xiaohou half-sighed in exasperation.

“They even called the division posted at the Qinling Mountains over?” Mo Fan blurted out in surprise.

“Perhaps they are really lacking manpower. Many cities along the coastline that are currently experiencing the storm have sounded a Blue Alert. I believe the whole military is busy dispatching troops to the right places. Our troop at the Qinling Mountains happened to be free for the time being,” Zhang Xiaohou answered.

“It seems like the situation in Xiamen is pretty serious. It’s most likely the sea monsters of the entire Donghai (East Sea) and Nanhai (South Sea) are planning to invade our country through Xiamen,” Lingling informed him.

Mo Fan thought Lingling was only speculating about the potential danger that the storm might bring when they were on the plane. To his surprise, a great disaster really was about to occur on the third day of the storm!

Rain, seawater, fierce winds, and stormy clouds... weren’t these the sea monsters’ favorite? With them, the sea monsters could finally extend their kingdom onto the land. They could finally conquer the human cities they had longed for!

“We are going to Xiamen too. Can you give us a ride? I think all the commercial flights have been canceled,” Mo Fan said.

“I can certainly give you a ride if you’re going too, but I’m seriously worried about it. It’s rare to receive such an urgent order from the authorities.” Zhang Xiaohou could feel how serious the situation was.
