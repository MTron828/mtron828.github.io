“It’s Earth Magic is so annoying, especially that Mountain Shield. I won’t be able to hurt it if it keeps using that Shield against my destructive spells,” Mo Fan fumed.

Mo Fan had always hated fighting tough creatures with sturdy defenses. Even if the Black-Silver Rock Demon stood there without defending itself, it would take Mo Fan some time to take it down, but if it was using the Earth Magic, he highly doubted he could kill it before the sun rose at dawn!

“I can help you create an Earth Element Vacuum Zone to weaken the presence of the Earth Element. That way, it will have difficulties using its Earth Magic,” Wen Xia said.

“Is it like a magic Formation?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes!” Wen Xia nodded.

“Great, without the Earth Magic, the fight should be a lot easier!” Mo Fan said enthusiastically

—

It was a Time-Lapse Formation, meaning it would take some time for the Formation to be established. Wen Xia was actually good at setting up magic Formations. Otherwise, she would not have been picked to implement the Magic Sealing Order.

However, the Earth Element Vacuum Zone was slightly different from the Magic Sealing Zone. She would be working with a few Earth Mages to set up a magical pentagram with her energy and some magic Tools to swiftly draw away the energy of a certain Element from the area!

The magic Formation was similar to an exhaust fan. It would draw the energy out of the air and turn it into a Vacuum Zone!

That being said, it was difficult to set up a perfect Vacuum Zone, but it was still possible for a few powerful Earth Mages to draw away the energy of a specific Element from an area.

Wen Xia happened to have four aides-de-camp still available. The Mage Fang Di had regrouped with them after he brought in the rescue team from the Magic Association to treat the victims whom they had rescued. The five of them stood at five different points of a pentagram.

Mo Fan was luring the Black-Silver Rock Demon into the Vacuum Zone inside the pentagram. It was a trap designed specifically for the creature!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon completely disregarded the humans nearby. It set its foot into the Vacuum Zone while trying to grab Mo Fan.

“Earth Element Vacuum Zone!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wen Xia led her aides-de-camp in empowering the magic Formation. A dark line extended from Wen Xia’s arms and connected with Deputy Lieutenant Hou and Fang Di.

The two spread their arms just like Wen Xia, forming vertices of the pentagon. When the ray reached them, it extended from their arms across to the other two soldiers.

When the last two soldier’s arms were connected by the light, like Star Orbits being combined into a Star Pattern, the pentagram began to emit a strange glow, isolating the area.

There was no wind, but it felt like they were stepping into the middle of a tornado. Mo Fan was an Earth Mage too, so he could feel the Earth Magic in the Zone thinning out!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon noticed something fishy, too. The Earth Magic was like a Domain under its control at all times, but it could feel its power plummeting!

“Mo Fan, the Vacuum Zone won’t last long. You must defeat it as quickly as possible... remember, don’t let it escape from the pentagram!” Wen Xia told Mo Fan.

“Don’t worry, I won’t give the vandal any chance!” Mo Fan assured her.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was not a stupid creature. It immediately turned around when it realized it had walked into a trap.

The Vacuum Zone in the pentagram did not restrict its movement; it was hard enough just weakening the presence of an Element in the area. The rest was up to Mo Fan now.

“You think you can run away?”

Mo Fan was long prepared for this. He had been releasing his Dark Material into the ground and the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s body throughout the battle.

“It has been a while since I last used my Dark Magic. It’s time to see how strong the Fiendish Night has grown!” Mo Fan murmured.

It was already late at night. The darkness helped the Fiendish Night spread even faster. As Mo Fan went around in a circle, the street that was already under his control was further encapsulated by a layer of dark energy.

The darkness continued to spread like a shadowy mist.

The ground turned into a huge black swamp. The pentagram had already drawn away the Earth Magic, and the ground the Black-Silver Rock Demon was standing on was replaced by a bottomless swamp. It had completely cut the Black-Silver Rock Demon off from the actual ground!

“Stop!” Mo Fan swung his arm.

A pair of shadowy enormous hands rose from the shadowy morass and grabbed onto the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s legs tightly.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon struggled fiercely, but it felt like its legs were nailed to the spot. When it turned around, it was shocked to see its legs being held by its own shadow.

The whole place was in complete darkness. Why were there still shadows!? Why did its shadow have the power to bind it down!?

Mere brute force was not enough to break free from the Fiendish Night. Mo Fan did recall some people mentioning that the Earth Element’s defense was vulnerable to the Shadow Element. Mo Fan had all the time he needed to cast a real Shadow Spell once the Black-Silver Rock Demon was unable to rely on its Earth Magic!

“Treason of the Rebelling Shadow!”

It would have been difficult for Mo Fan to Summon a shadow the same size as the massive creature with his Fiendish Night before. However, the improved version of the Fiendish Night did not let him down. A huge shadow demon resembling the Black-Silver Rock Demon rose from the Swamp of Darkness just a few seconds after the Black-Silver Rock Demon was unable to move!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon stiffened. Its eyes filled with fear when it saw the shadow demon with its own appearance rising before it...

The Rebelling Shadow was just as big as the Black-Silver Rock Demon; the only difference was, its body was made of the Dark Material. The shadow demon had a menacing aura. It took a step forward and stabbed the Black-Silver Rock Demon with a long shadow spear before Mo Fan even gave the order!

The Black-Silver Rock Demon started to panic instantly. It finally broke free from the binding on its feet. The shadow demon that looked exactly the same as it did had stabbed it in the chest. The Black-Silver Rock Demon did not suffer any physical injuries, but was staggering from the pain inflicted on its mind and soul!
