It was getting dark. The three of them, overwhelmed by fatigue, decided to find a peaceful village close to the Red Sea to stay for the night.

Asha’ruiya was going back to Greece. Mo Fan most likely had to go with her too, to comfort Xinxia after he had gone missing for a year. He had to tell her about his adventure.

Sharjah was going back to the Sacred City.

She had to return after her identity was exposed. She was no longer a student of the Aorus Sacred Institute, an intern at the Canton Tower, or the sister of the leader of a rebellion.

She could not escape her fate after she was chosen to be an Angel.

The village had a lot of coconut trees, as if it had just been through a rainy season. It was surrounded by trees, like an unexploited and beautiful tropical island.

Mo Fan lay behind a wooden hut by the white sandy beach. He could see the sea through the trees. He felt relaxed as he sniffed the soothing scents of the nearby plants.

It felt good to be alive. The Dark Plane was like a nightmare. The air was foul and brimming with death. His organs would slowly deteriorate and decay there, even if he was not killed by the ghastly creatures inside it.

“Here, have a taste!” The Saintess had prepared a plate of roasted chicken sprinkled with spices. Its pleasant aroma made Mo Fan drool even before it was served.

Every piece was cut evenly. The plate also had some raw vegetables to balance the oily main dish.

Mo Fan wrapped the meat with the raw vegetables and took a huge bite. He immediately cast away his thoughts of the terrible experience in the Dark Plane, overwhelmed by the joy of eating delicious food once again.

“Here, a toast for making out of Hell alive and taking out a malignant tumor in Asia!” Mo Fan raised his cup of fruit wine. It was a little strong, but Mo Fan emptied his cup in one go.

There was no refrigerator in the village. The wine was cooled with water collected from the river. It gave the wine a perfect taste, and was a great way to relieve their boredom.

“Cheers!”

The two women did not waste the wine either, and emptied their cups after Mo Fan. Their faces soon flushed redly. They regained their charm, their pale faces finally regaining some colors. It was an enjoyable sight for Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was soon a little drunk. He subconsciously wrapped his hands around Asha’ruiya and Sharjah’s shoulders.

Asha’ruiya and Sharjah both looked at him.

He had finally shown his true nature!

“Say, we have been through life and death together. Since there are three of us, why don’t we become sworn brothers and sisters?” Mo Fan proposed.

“...”

“What does that mean?” Sharjah was unfamiliar with the term, since she was a foreigner.

“Basically, we will kneel on our knees and… no that’s not it. Have you not heard about the Oath of the Peach Garden? Asha’ruiya, didn’t you read a lot of books? Explain what it is to her,” Mo Fan said.

“It’s similar to the oath sworn by a bride and a groom. No matter what he becomes, we will treat him like our husband, except we don’t have to sleep with him,” Asha’ruiya explained.

“There’s a ritual like that in your country? That’s interesting. Sure, I swear in the name of the Angel that from today onward, we will be sworn sisters,” Sharjah said.

“Brothers.”

“There are two women here,” Asha’ruiya smiled.

Sharjah nodded.

Mo Fan’s face darkened. He felt like he had just dug a hole for himself.

—

The majority won!

Mo Fan became one of the sworn sisters. He initially thought he could boast to the others that Archangel Gabriel of the Sacred City and a Saintess of the Parthenon Temple were his sworn brothers, but he somehow felt like a toyboy. It no longer sounded as impressive as what he had imagined.

Mo Fan felt a little dizzy as he crawled onto his bed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The room had a simple layout. It had a wooden bed with blankets, but it was comfortable. The bed was surprisingly soft despite its looks.

——

Early next morning, Mo Fan was woken up by two screams and two slaps to his face.

He went outside to wash his face. He looked in the mirror and turned his face. He realized he could not wash the handprints on his face away.

No wonder the bed was softer than he had imagined. How could he not have a comfortable rest on their sexy bodies and their soft chests?

Unfortunately, he had been too drunk to do anything. Otherwise, the trip had definitely been worth it!

“I should head back to the Sacred City,” Sharjah sighed in disappointment.

She did not want to be the Archangel Gabriel. She just wanted to be Sharjah, a student of the Aorus Sacred Institute, who just had to focus on the things she was interested in.

Unfortunately, she had her duties. She had returned to the Sacred City and fulfill her responsibilities as a guardian of the world.

“About Su Lu...” Mo Fan said.

“I’ll take care of it. You don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Sharjah assured him.

“That’s great. My country is in deep trouble. My people need me. My country needs me, too. I must go back as soon as possible,” Mo Fan told them.

“Aren’t you going to the Parthenon Temple with me?” Asha’ruiya asked him.

“Ye Xinxia has gone back to our homeland. Is there any reason for me to visit the Parthenon Temple?” Mo Fan said.

“Who knows. Maybe you are a responsible man who won’t disappoint any of his mistresses,” Asha’ruiya hinted at him.

Mo Fan reached out his hand and fondled Asha’ruiya’s head. He smiled, “Don’t worry, you are my only mistress in the Parthenon Temple. We have only spent a year in the Dark Plane together. It’s time for us to part ways.”

Asha’ruiya moved Mo Fan’s hand away and sniffed, “I have a lot of paramours waiting for me!”

“So I’ve?heard,” Mo Fan nodded.

Asha’ruiya frowned. “You should go with me to the Parthenon Temple first. I have something to give you,” Asha’ruiya smiled. It was impressive how she managed to change her expression so quickly every time.

“Can’t you tell me what it is?” Mo Fan said.

“You have already been away for a year. A few days won’t hurt you!” Asha’ruiya replied.

“Fine.”

“Then I will be going this way to the Sacred City.” Sharjah pointed at a path leading to a mountain range covered in snow.

The mountain range was white, like something out of a drawing, with a meandering path that lead to the Sacred City.

“Alright, goodbye, Sharjah,” Mo Fan waved his hand.

“Goodbye teacher; goodbye Asha’ruiya!” Sharjah was a little unwilling to leave.. She stood there for a long time.
