Chapter 2974: Battle

“Actually, in the East Guardian Towers…” Mo Fan was going to expose the Chief of the Towers. But Ozawa shook his head, signaling to Mo Fan that this was not the right timing.

He could not expose the Chief of the Towers.

The Chief of the Towers was one of the rulers of the Twin Guardian Towers. If Mo Fan provoked him, he would immediately order everyone in the Twin Guardian Towers to arrest Mo Fan. Ultimately, a battle would take place.

Mo Fan was capable. However, if that happened, they would be unable to help those under the grip of the Evil Gang and those with sober minds.

“Chief, the escape of Ki Kurokawa might be an accident, but I saw some people in the East Guardian Towers. I will point them out, so I hope you won’t neglect them anymore. The Twin Guardian Towers are at stake. We must deal with those dangerous people no matter the cost!” said Ozawa. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Point them out then.” The Chief of the Towers looked at Mo Fan.

Although Katana Mochizuki and Tegami Fujikata did not speak, they knew what to do.

“This is another list. I am sure that these people are all Blood Demons.” Ozawa handed them another list.

“Let me have a look first,” said General Takuichi.

After General Takuichi read it, he handed it to the other three people. “Should we let everyone take a look?” he said, indifferently.

The list that Ozawa handed over did not include all the Blood Demons. After all, Ozawa did not know how many people were still imprisoned in the cell.

He had walked to the cell at the end of the corridor. He had written down the names of all the people imprisoned in it from his memory, but the list had only a few names.

If he exposed too many Blood Demons, the Chief of the Towers Shigekyo, Tegami Fujikata, and Katana Mochizuki would fight back immediately. Once a large number of Blood Demons were cleared, they would lose control of the Twin Guardian Towers.

But for the moonless night, it was acceptable for them to sacrifice a small number of people. This was just a game to them.

Ozawa was aware of his current situation. Exposing them all would only lead to chaos. Due to their need to act, he could eliminate some Blood Demons and identify others of sober mind.

Katana Mochizuki, Tegami Fujikata, and the Chief of the Towers looked at the list and hesitated.

“Should we reveal our identities?” Tegami Fujikata asked in a low voice.

“That’s not worth it. It’s only a few people.” Katana Mochizuki shook his head.

“Don’t you think they are deliberately weakening our strength by reducing our numbers?” said the Chief of the Towers.

“Yes. If Ki Kurokawa hadn’t been so reckless, we wouldn’t have had to compromise. Take a look at your credibility in the court. If you don’t take care of these people, no one will trust you anymore. Do you want us to sacrifice you too?” Katana Mochizuki asked.

The Chief of the Towers gritted his teeth.

It was all Ki Kurokawa’s fault. If he had endured it a little longer, everyone would have a new life. Why did he have to expose himself? If Shigekyo had known earlier that Ki Kurokawa was this uncontrollable, he would have killed him with his own hands.

“Hmph! I have looked at the list. These people are trash,” said the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo.

Everyone was a prisoner, and they were all crazy people. He did not have to pity them.

If it were not for everyone having a common goal to escape from the East Guardian Towers, they would have killed all of them to avoid getting exposed.

…

After getting the approval of the Chief of the Towers, the list of Blood Demons compiled by Ozawa was made public.

“Catch them! Don’t give them a chance to escape!” The Chief of the Towers ordered the Mages of the Twin Guardian Towers to take action.

Thirty-seven people were caught in the pavilion, and they were all Blood Demons. They were tortured, after which they revealed their true appearances.

The Chief of the Towers was smart. To prevent these thirty-seven people from exposing other Blood Demons, he killed them all on the spot!

The court suddenly became an execution chamber. Even though there were only thirty-seven people, it nonetheless had a significant impact on others.

“As expected of the chief, we get to kill these parasites because of you!”

“You flatter me. You should thank Ozawa. Actually, I asked Ozawa to do this. Since Ozawa violated the commandment to carry out my order, he should only receive a light punishment. The unfortunate occurrence of the Twin Guardian Towers is indeed because of the negligence of every one of us, especially me. Let’s end the public trial and go back,” the Chief of the Towers Shigekyo said to the crowd.

This trial could not continue anymore. The Chief of the Towers could give up on some of his companions. However, the Red Demon would blame him if more were killed.

“Chief, don’t forget to save the people imprisoned in the East Guardian Towers. They have suffered a lot,” Ozawa reminded the Chief of the Towers.

“I’ll save them, of course.” The Chief of the Towers nodded.

…

Ozawa did not force them. If the Blood Demons revealed their identity, it would not benefit them. Therefore, they could only end this trial.

Ozawa had to deceive others by claiming that all of the Blood Demons had perished and that the Twin Guardian Towers would soon return to peace in order to make them feel better.

When he told them about it, Ozawa sobbed. As he cried, he was not sure whether he felt sad for the sorrowful Twin Guardian Towers or the torture and pain the dagger caused him.

Ozawa returned to his room after he was released.

Lingling helped Ozawa with his wound by wrapping some gauze around his abdomen. She felt a little sad to see him in pain.

Ozawa, who knew the truth, had to face a powerful opponent. He even had to force himself to accept those terrible facts and abandon some people.

“I still can’t save everyone,” Ozawa said regretfully.

“You have done better than anyone else.”

“Most people will choose to join and integrate with them when they find out that everything can’t be changed. Only you choose to fight. People who can make such a choice are amazing.” Lingling comforted Ozawa.

“But there are still many…” Ozawa still felt a little regretful. He was blaming himself for not exposing more people. Maybe those Blood Demons would agree as well.

“Are you mentally prepared to let me destroy the Twin Guardian Towers? You don’t have to worry about it anymore. It will at least be better now,” Mo Fan said.

“The number of people you exposed is good. If you choose more people, the Blood Demons might reveal their identity and kill the people imprisoned in the East Guardian Towers. Since your request was not too over the top, they didn’t kill the people in the East Guardian Towers,” said Lingling.

Ozawa nodded quietly. This was what he had been considering.

“A battle is not all about impulsivity. You can’t just run forward and kill the enemy. The enemy may be right in front of you, but you must still take each step thoughtfully, just as you did today. Sometimes, you even have to make compromises with the enemy.” Lingling was impressed by Ozawa’s decision.
