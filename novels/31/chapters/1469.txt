The Psychic Element and mental strength had always been one of Mo Fan’s weaknesses. If the Psychic Element, Sound Element, and Curse Element had not existed in this world, and everyone was just blasting one another with Elemental Magic, it was unlikely that anyone would stand a chance against a violent Mage like Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had found himself at a disadvantage because of an enemy’s mental strength before. Faerun Waterfall was not only a test of a Mage’s control over their Stars, but a test of their mental Will!

Even if it was something very common, if the environment was so noisy that it kept annoying a person, there was still a chance for a person to make a mistake. That was why the loud rumbling of the Faerun Waterfall was a training of Will!

“Wouldn’t my Space Element be a lot more powerful once it reaches the sixth stage?” Mo Fan took a heavy step forward.

The rumbling water was closer to Mo Fan after the step. The mental wall of his fifth stage Will was no longer strong enough to hold back the flow of the water!

Mo Fan clenched his teeth and moved forward. The water finally hit him like a savage beast trying to stomp on him. He solely relied on his Demon Element to keep moving!

The raw force of the water was enough to knock a Super Level Mage to the bottom of the lake!

Mo Fan uttered a huge roar, gathering his might and dashing forward. When he felt like he was about to be smashed to the bottom of the waterfall, the enormous force on him suddenly disappeared.

The curtain of water split apart, revealing a cave inside it. It was surprisingly dry. The smooth, pale blue rocks were a strange sight, as if he had arrived at some hidden utopia.

“Did I pass through it?” Mo Fan murmured in surprise.

If it was half a year ago, before a few of Mo Fan’s Elements had reached third-tier, he would have had no chance of passing through the Faerun Waterfall.

It turned out that the training he underwent to improve his Elements had also made his Will more outstanding than most Mages of the same level.

The cave was surprisingly spacious, and the temperature inside was higher too. Mo Fan followed the path and discovered the cave wound about a bit. It was difficult to tell where the cave was leading him.

After turning a corner, Mo Fan was surprised to see some obvious decorations inside the cave; a huge silver rug on the floor and two crystal lamps on the walls. Mo Fan stepped on the rug and was intrigued. “Is someone living in here?”

Speaking of which, the cave was indeed a great place for training. The loud noise was still around, but the water was no longer hitting him. He believed his mental strength would reach the next level if he practiced controlling his Will in this place!

Mo Fan was looking for an opportunity to improve his mental strength. He was considering asking Alps Institute to allow him to train here for some time. In return, he would promise that he would not trespass into the girls’ dormitory!

“Strange, why does it feel like someone is living here?” Mo Fan went forward and discovered a place that was decorated like a room.

As soon as the thought crossed Mo Fan’s mind, he noticed the statue of a woman with a perfect physique sitting at the center of the rug. Her long and curly ash-brown hair scattered over the top of the rug. Even though it was thick and beautiful, like silk, it still could not cover the round bottom that stood out because of her posture.

Mo Fan immediately felt his body heating up. Why did he keep stumbling into naked statues of women? He finally understood why some people had a fetish for statues. Only statues would have such sacred and perfect bodies...

Mo Fan walked closer to see if there was any reason why the statue was displayed in a place like this. However, he suddenly heard a soft voice, followed by a faint breathing.

Mo Fan was stunned. He fixed his eyes on the statue whose back was facing him.

The statue slowly turned around, exposing her naked body to Mo Fan. His blood began to boil.

So pretty, so big, so slim... hairless?

The gem-like blue woman’s eyes widened. Her attractive face filled with astonishment!

The astonishment gradually turned into anger. She swiped her hand, caught the corner of the silver rug and quickly wrapped it around herself. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She rose to her feet. Her eyes went from ashamed and angry to cold and fierce!

“Give me a reason not to kill you!” the woman grunted murderously. The air in the surroundings began to freeze. Mo Fan was utterly dumbfounded after sensing the overwhelming aura.

The woman was clearly around his age; how was her cultivation so outstanding?

“I didn’t know someone was in here, not to mention that the person would be naked!” Mo Fan donned a suitably awkward expression. He could not help but think in his heart, Is this the reward that Alps Institute prepared for me if I passed the trial? I’ve really misunderstood the school. Look at how friendly they are!

“You may die now!” The woman’s eyes suddenly emitted a sapphire blue glow. A strong crushing Will sprang at Mo Fan at lightning speed.

Mo Fan was still immersed in his lewd thoughts. He did not think the woman would execute a killing blow at him. The Will was extremely powerful. It would instantly crush him into bloodspray if he did not defend himself!

“Just calm down, will you?” Mo Fan reacted swiftly, jumping aside to dodge the woman’s attack.

“It’s either you die, or I die!” the woman said coldly.

The woman took a step forward after the sentence. She suddenly vanished into thin air, leaving blue crystalline dust sprinkling onto the silver rug.

Mo Fan immediately realized the woman had used Blink. Since she was nowhere to be seen within his range of vision, she was most likely behind him!

Mo Fan turned around and saw the woman’s cold blue eyes staring right at him. Several huge and sharp stalactites were already hovering above her head.

With a flicker, the stalactites darted at Mo Fan. They were obviously sped up by a special forcefield, granting them great speed. Mo Fan could not dodge them in time. He was forced to establish a wall of Will to defend himself!

The stalactites slammed into the wall of Will and turned into powder. However, Mo Fan was still knocked a few steps back by the impact!

“How unreasonable are you? It’s my fault that you are not wearing any clothes in public? You should be relieved that I didn’t call the police because you have such a good physique that didn’t damage my eyes, yet you still attacked me first! What the hell do you want?” Mo Fan cursed after securing a foothold.

“Who gave you permission to come in here!? You shameless prick!” the woman swore.

The woman had no intention to stop her attacks, even while she was talking.

She was clearly an expert of the Space Element. Her Will split rapidly into countless wisps, controlling every object she could see!
