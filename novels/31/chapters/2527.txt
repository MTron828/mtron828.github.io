The rising sea level had not impacted London much. The sea monsters were not as active in countries with colder temperatures as they were closer to the equator.

Pink roses blossomed like stars on the streets and alleys, showcasing the delicate gardens. A pleasant scent lingered in the air, soothing the minds of the pedestrians as they were strolling around.

“Let’s take a walk and get some fresh air. It’s good for your injuries,” Mo Jiaxin suggested.

It was rare for London to be sunny. The flowers were bright spots of color under the sun. Mo Jiaxin subconsciously took out his phone to take a photo of Ye Chang, but for some reason, he had a feeling Ye Chang was not a pure Asian, especially when she was wearing a knit hat. She looked more like a local woman from England.

“Don’t!”

“Oh, I’m sorry, I forgot that you didn’t like taking photos,” Mo Jiaxin quickly put his phone away.

They continued up the stairs and reached a kiosk with reinforced glass and a great view. They could see the busy streets from here.

“I’m feeling a little tired. Why don’t we rest for a while?” Ye Chang asked.

“Sure, what would you like to drink?”

“Tea.”

—

Mo Jiaxin sat opposite Ye Chang after making the order. His phone rang as soon as he sat down.

Mo Jiaxin was overjoyed to see the call was from Mo Fan.

The look in Ye Chang’s eyes changed. She stared at Mo Jiaxin coldly.

Mo Jiaxin smiled and said, “I know what you are thinking, but it’s my son, so I have to take it.”

“Dad, where are you enjoying yourself now?” Mo Fan asked over the phone.

“I’m having afternoon tea. Are you alright? I heard what is happening in our homeland,” Mo Jiaxin replied.

“Of course I’m fine, but you should enjoy your vacation in England for now since it’s free of sea monsters… By the way, I heard there are plenty of aged beauties in England. When are you going to find a partner? I don’t mind having a stepmother!” Mo Fan urged him.

“Nonsense! I’m perfectly fine here. I’m hanging up!” Mo Jiaxin moved to end the call.

“I can hear a woman laughing on your end. Dad, there’s no need to hide it!”

“It’s from the other table. I’m hanging up!”

—

Mo Jiaxin ended the call and looked at Ye Chang.

Ye Chang seemed normal again, with her usual gloomy face.

Mo Jiaxin knew she had lots of strange aversions. He also knew she did not want others to mention her. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

She always hid herself under a huge coat. Whenever he broke her rules, she would suddenly go missing without a trace.

Therefore, Mo Jiaxin had not mentioned her in the call. He was afraid that she might disappear again!

“This tea is pretty bad,” Ye Chang was having trouble swallowing the tea after taking a sip. “I can remember the jasmine tea you always served me. It was nice.”

“Huh? You remember that? Give me a second,” Mo Jiaxin smiled. He had not expected Ye Chang to remember such a minor detail.

As a matter of fact, the jasmine tea used to be Mo Fan’s mother’s favorite, but she had passed away at a relatively young age. Mo Jiaxin would occasionally make the tea for himself. To his surprise, Ye Chang had liked drinking it, too.

It had been so many years. Even Mo Jiaxin had forgotten that detail

A shadow appeared among the flowers.

A man stood in the shadows there, blending perfectly with the background. The people who were enjoying their tea time did not notice him.

“Did you call me?” the shadow uttered softly.

“Spread the news about the Supreme Pontiff’s death,” Ye Chang said.

“Got it.”

The shadow quickly disappeared. A cup of hot jasmine tea was placed in front of Ye Chang.

“Who were you talking to?” Mo Jiaxin asked.

“A stray cat. She ran away,” Ye Chang pointed at the flowers.

“It seems like you are starting to recall a lot of things, unlike the first day. You couldn’t even remember who you were,” Mo Jiaxin smiled.

“Many people are looking for me, but sometimes, I don’t even know who I am,” Ye Chang told him.

“You always say strange things. Even though I don’t know anything about your past since you never mentioned it to me, we shouldn’t dwell on the past. You should enjoy the great view and tea while fixing your eyes on the happy times. It’s a better way to spend your life,” Mo Jiaxin shared his optimistic way of living.

“I like the sound of that, too, but if I don’t finish certain things before enjoying my life, it feels like devils are clenching my heart and my throat to make me suffer,” Ye Chang took a sip of her tea. Her gaze sharpened.

“When are you going to finish them? Can I help?” Mo Jiaxin asked.

Ye Chang shook her head. As a matter of fact, Mo Jiaxin had been more of a hindrance than a help.

“I should be going. Thank you for your tea,” Ye Chang rose to her feet.

“Oh, sure, let’s head back. The wind is getting stronger. It’s easy to get a cold,” Mo Jiaxin nodded.

“I meant I’m leaving,” Ye Chang explained.

“Huh?”

“I have some unfinished business,” Ye Chang told him.

“But…we just met, and Xinxia has already grown up. I was going to bring you to her. She’s currently in Greece!” Mo Jiaxin said urgently.

“I have already seen her,” Ye Chang informed him.

Mo Jiaxin panicked. He was looking for any excuse to make the woman stay.

He thought he would never see her again, but he had miraculously stumbled into her in a foreign country. He thought they could finally be together after being apart for so long, but she was leaving again after it had been less than half a month.

He might not be able to wait for another dozen years to see her again!

“I know I’m just an ordinary man. I will never be a part of your world or understand it, but… I just want to say I won’t disturb you or go to places I shouldn’t be. If someday, you have nowhere to go, or when you forget things again, feel free to find me. I’ll always be waiting,” Mo Jiaxin offered quietly as Ye Chang left.

“Sure, I always have nowhere to go..”
