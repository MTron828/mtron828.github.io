Chapter 2898: The Totem Beasts’ Privilege

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Wen Xia Tao Jing and Zhou Donghao could not believe it.

The Little White Tiger was very playful. When the Green East Sea God did not pay attention to it, the Little White Tiger threw a handful of mud at its feathers.

The Green East Sea God stood on the wooden statue. It was more mature compared to the other totem beasts; hence it did not bother playing with them. It was furious after the others threw mud at it!

The high and mighty Green East Sea God would not bother to play with mud!

The Green East Sea God was stirred up. Its body expanded. Its green feathers glowed in holy light and occupied the entire courtyard.

!!

Within a few seconds, the Green East Sea God revealed its true form. Its terrifying green wings were so powerful that it could flap North Park away effortlessly.

Wen Xia, Tao Jing, and Zhou Donghao were speechless.

At the same time, the Little White Tiger glowed in holy blue light. It was shrouded in a bone-chilling aura and was covered in spotless white fur. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The playful Little White Tiger transformed into a magnificent Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger that glowed in holy light. It confronted the Green East Sea God in midair and exuded a terrifying aura.

The trio’s jaws dropped. It was only then that they realized Mo Fan wasn’t bluffing. These “little babies” were truly totem beasts. They had transformed into mini versions. After the three people saw their true forms, they were weak to their knees.

Many video clips had circulated on the internet, but most of the clips were taken from a distance away, including the image of the Azure Dragon coiling up in the sky above the Magic City. When they saw the totem beasts at a close range, it was only then that they realized how powerful they actually were!

“They’re going to fight each other! The Little White Tiger is going to fight the Green East Sea God!” Mo Fan shouted.

Several people ran out of the house.

Wen Xia thought that the Totem Beast Heroes came out to stop the totem beasts from fighting each other. She watched in disbelief when the young people sat on chairs in the courtyard and took out snacks from their pockets and waited for a good show!

The Moon Moth Phoenix flew between the two totem beasts. It quickly calmed the two with its serene and peaceful aura.

Mo Fan thought it was a pity that he could not witness the battle between the Green East Sea God and the Heavenly Scar Sacred Tiger. He wondered which would be more powerful.

“Are you the legendary Totem Beast Heroes?” Wen Xia asked incredulously.

“So, we are being called the Totem Beast Heroes, huh? Not bad. I like it!” Zhao Manyan was all smiles.

People admired and respected him from the bottom of their hearts. Zhao Manyan felt that his life was better now that people respected him for his actions and not for his massive wealth.

He would rather become a wealthy, handsome, and popular man with great achievements than just a rich, spoiled brat.

Aromatic smell wafted out from the kitchen. Yu Shishi and several young ladies had come over with several large plates of delicacies.

“Go wash up and eat your food,” said Yu Shishi. After that, she glared at Mo Fan. “Not you! The food is for them!”

“I’m covered in mud. What’s wrong if I go and wash up? Do you seriously think I’ll fight for food with the totem beasts?” Mo Fan said with a huff.

Yu Shishi smirked.

Mo Fan entered the house. He took a shower and changed his clothes.

Everyone chatted inside the courtyard. Mo Fan came out of the house and noticed that Wen Xia, Zhou Donghao, and Tao Jing looked at him differently now.

“Tell me, how did you summon the Azure Dragon? Everyone is discussing it fervently across the country. Oh, my god! I’m also a friend of the Azure Dragon Guardian. We’ve boarded the same bus and been to the dark cave together... I can’t wait to attend the annual classmate gathering and compare my achievements with theirs!” Zhou Donghao said excitedly.

“The Forbidden Curse Association has sealed the news for us. Don’t tell the rest that we’re the ones who shared the news with you. We haven’t found some of the missing totem beasts, so we’re worried that someone else will hinder our progress or harm us.” Jiang Shaoxu acted vigilantly and warned those who came to visit them.

“Understood. But I suppose those who have the intention of getting you into trouble are aware of the identities of the Totem Guardians, right?” asked Wen Xia.

“Indeed. But at the very least, they won’t recognize us at a single glance wherever we go. The identity of Totem Guardian has to be well-hidden. The totem beasts have to be well-protected,” said Song Feiyao.

“Anyway, we’re aware of the presence of Totem Beast Heroes. I heard that the Forbidden Curse Association will prepare a totem medal for us that will grant us certain power equivalent to that of a councilor. We can even request the military for assistance with that.” Jiang Shaoxu brought up the issue.

“Indeed. Ding City will prepare the totem medals for you. I came here to discuss the issue with you. Also, I would like to spend some time with your totem beasts so that I can create corresponding totem medals for all of you,” said Wen Xia.

“That’s great! The country only supported us from the shadows before,but now it’s supporting us openly!” Zhao Manyan smiled in satisfaction.

“Moreover, some of the researchers and archeological teams will cooperate with you unconditionally. They will provide you with any information, and documents that you need,” added Wen Xia.

“Great! Finally, we don’t have to do everything on our own. Can we find a place to camp and enjoy life while leaving the dirty work to others in our future search for the totem beast? We’ll just have to give them our orders,” Zhao Manyan said happily.

“Dream on! In fact, the country can’t help us much. It has only granted us certain privilege,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“Not really. President Hong Wu has issued some paperwork to us and helped us collect the legend of totem beasts from various places. I believe we’ll get a lot of important information from there,” said Mo Fan.

The totem beasts had done a remarkable job in the Magic City war. Countless people had witnessed the true totem beasts. The totem beasts had always been in the country. They acted as the guardians of the people. Summoning a vast number of mages could help find the remaining missing totem beast.

Furthermore, this could save the totem beast team some time.

“The Ocean Demons will make a comeback. By then, we won’t be heavily defeated like this time!” Mo Fan said solemnly.

Thankfully, they did not give up looking for the totem beasts’ traces. They were glad that their hard work had paid off. This was the reason why Jiang Shaojun had been willing to dedicate his life to search for the mysterious and ancient totem beasts.

The totem beasts were truly extraordinary Holy Spirits with unique powers!
