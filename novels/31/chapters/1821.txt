“How deep is the water?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“Around two hundred meters, it’s not too deep,” Mo Fan replied quickly.

“You can even use your Dark Material like a measuring device?” Zhao Manyan had to ask.

“Hehe, I improved it slightly at Guangzhou. I finally get to try it out!” Mo Fan smiled.

The water gradually turned colder. The chill began to penetrate their skin and bodies. The boat slowly reached the vicinity of Dawn Island with the waves pushing it. The irregular outline of the island began to fill their view.

The beach of the island had tall coconut trees lining it. The short ones were around twenty meters tall, and the tall ones could even reach a height of eighty meters. The treetops were spacious enough to contain a huge nest. Mo Fan was able to see further in the dark, and soon noticed there was a huge nest on every three trees he saw. The nest was delicately made, as if it was artificially woven for people to lie on while the leaves served as a natural sun umbrella. It felt like some kind of a resort.

“Why are their nests so delicate? If you put a man and a woman in them for a little honeymoon, they will soon give birth to a child, let alone the birds!” Zhao Manyan had also noticed the beautiful nests when he was close enough.

“The Featherless Bird Emperor always lived with its master. It learned a great deal from humans. It must have taught this to all its people,” Chen Shuo said awkwardly.

There were still two kilometers away from the island, the closest that Tangyue had gotten to when she came to inspect the island. However, she had been driven away by the Featherless Birds in the water back then.

The dense coconut trees gave the Featherless Birds the perfect environment to build their nests. One could easily lose their way among the trees.

A strange cry echoed above the island. The group on the boat went on alert immediately. They fixed their eyes on the tall cliffs nearby.

The island had some high terrain. The place they were planning to land at was around twenty meters above sea level, meaning that the island had been even taller before the seal level had risen. It served as a natural line of defense for the island, since the heights were an advantage for those defending the island and for keeping an eye out for any approaching enemy on it.

The coconut trees were swaying slightly in the wind. Many blue glowing objects like sapphires poked out from the gaps between the trees. They went from a few to a whole bunch!

The Sapphire Eyes were staring down at the little boat swaying on the waves. The cold looks in their eyes would send a chill down anyone’s spine!

“Damn, didn’t you say they are going to be asleep? Why are they staring at us with wide eyes instead!?” Zhao Manyan swore.

“The Featherless Birds on the island have a higher rank. They won’t be completely asleep,” Chen Shuo said indifferently.

“What should we do now? We are still two kilometers away from the island,” Zhao Manyan said.

“What else can we do? We are breaking through with force!” Tangyue said.

Tangyue was the first to react. She turned into a shadow sparrow, flying across the night sky elegantly.

Zhao Manyan raised his thumb when he saw Tangyue was already two hundred meters away. “Your teacher is pretty brave!”

Mo Fan was not able to fly. He could only glide like a bird, even though the place was in complete darkness. He would eventually land after traveling for a few hundred meters. On the other hand, Tangyue had completely turned into a night sparrow, similar to how the vampire Bola usually turned into a bat. She was able to fly freely in the dark.

“Time to go! It’s worse if we are stuck on the water,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan carried Lingling on his back and decided to abandon the boat. He followed Tangyue and made his way to the island rapidly in the form of a shadow.

Mo Fan had nowhere to land within two kilometers from him. He could only rely on the darkness to use his little tricks, but Mo Fan was unable to use his other Elements when he was in his shadow form. He was extremely vulnerable, too. Therefore, he needed Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, and Mu Bai to protect him.

Mu Bai was focusing on maintaining the temperature. He also needed protection from the others. Chen Shuo was only an average Advanced Mage. He could barely keep an eye on Mu Bai. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Wait, do all of you need my protection!?” Zhao Manyan grumbled as soon as he realized something was not right.

“Cut the crap, Miss Tangyue is already clearing the path ahead. Let’s go!” Mo Fan said.

“Don’t leave the boat then, come back to me!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

Zhao Manyan did not leave the boat. He summoned a huge wave over eight meters tall with the boat at the top of it. The boat started riding the wave straight toward the island like a surfer.

Zhao Manyan’s wave soon overtook Mo Fan. Mo Fan hesitated briefly before deciding to return to the boat. At least he would have somewhere to stand.

“You are seriously a retard,” Lingling rolled her eyes at Mo Fan’s decision to return to the boat.

Mo Fan had nothing to say.

The cries grew louder. The half-asleep Featherless Birds finally realized they were being invaded. More cries exploded across the island.

The Featherless Birds on the island were quite surprised. They did not expect the guards in the sea to be sleeping like rocks, and not react at all when the enemy had broken so far through their defenses.

Sapphire eyes flew into the sky, creating a spectacular sight among the coconut trees. It felt like a whole bunch of sapphire fireflies were taking off into the night sky after being startled by some unwanted guests!

Mo Fan knew that behind the glowing eyes were strong bodies with no feathers. Their skin had a dark color which had merged with the darkness, thus the only thing visible was their eyes!

“Why are there so many of them on the island!?” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

“They reproduced so much. Unbelievable!” Even Chen Shuo was dumbfounded.

According to his plan, there would only be some high-rank Sapphire Featherless Birds and Greater Featherless Birds left on the island after putting the Featherless Birds in the sea into hibernation. There should not be too many Sapphire Featherless Birds, since they were direct relatives of the Featherless Bird Emperor, and their reproduction ability was limited as well. Chen Shuo had estimated there were only around two hundred Sapphire Featherless Birds.

However, the sight before him obviously numbered more than two hundred Sapphire Featherless Birds. There were almost a thousand of them, several times greater than he had estimated!
