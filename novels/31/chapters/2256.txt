Winnie began to regret her decision. Why did she come here so recklessly, without finding out her opponent’s strength first?

Normally, she would only come if she was fully prepared. She would at least have had the confidence to take out her enemy after her identity was exposed!

She had seen the duel between Mo Fan and Nelson, so she was confident in her strength. However, she realized she was in a bad spot after Mo Fan Summoned the Flame Belle Empress.

A Ruler-level creature with a pure lineage!

Most terrifyingly, this Ruler-level creature’s Calamity Fire was comparable to a Heaven-grade Seed. Her Fire Element was greatly suppressed in the creature’s Domain!

Flame Belle Empress unleashed her flames. The dim sky lit up again. The dusk which had dyed the sky red reappeared.

The people in Banlo City were dazzled. They had all witnessed a blood-red sunset just a moment ago. Why did the sky turn such a bright red all of a sudden? Did the sun rise again, after falling below the horizon?

The red light shone upon the city in the distance and overwhelmed the lights in the city.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan was reading the files outside the run-down church. He had to make sure the information in the files was valid.

After all, Winnie was exchanging her files with the name list. The information on the files might be fake.

However, there was a great chance that the files were real.

Wolf Chief? He had to be an Executioner too!

His role was similar to Spectre, who had tried to kill Mu Bai; a hitman the Black Vatican normally used to get rid of threats.

Based on the information Winnie had provided, the Wolf Chief’s rank was higher than Spectre’s. He was a Super Mage with three Elements at the Super Level, a Chief Executioner!

The Wolf Chief was hidden in the Aorus Sacred Institute, and rarely showed himself. He only took orders from the Chief Extraditor and Salan.

It was the Wolf Chief who had executed the Red Cardinal, the Cold Prince!

“If I find this Wolf Chief, I might be able to find the Chief Extraditor...” Mo Fan flipped through the pages.

Winnie was a two-faced person. She might have worked for the Black Vatican, but she had also done a great job as a Field Enforcer.

Perhaps she had outperformed the rest of the Field Enforcers because she was working for the Black Vatican. The Chief Wolf was obviously an important breakthrough that might lead him to the Chief Extraditor.

The Chief Extraditor...

The Head Priest Wu Ku....

The Evil Herbalist...

These three were Salan’s most important henchmen!

The Evil Herbalist was an important asset to Salan because of the Frenzy Liquid, but Mo Fan had no idea what the Head Priest’s uses were.

Meanwhile, the Chief Extraditor’s rank was only slightly lower than Salan’s rank as a Red Cardinal.

The Chief Extraditor had information about every member of the Black Vatican, whether they were a Gray Priest, a Black Clergy, a Blue Deacon, an Executioner, a spy, or a Red Cardinal. The Chief Extraditor had it all!

Salan had also mentioned that ‘Salan’ was just a pseudonym. If she died, other people could take over her identity too, as long as they inherited her will.

The Chief Extraditor would be the main reason why Salan could pass on her title. Salan was a leader, while the Chief Extraditor was a commander-in-chief.

The death of a great leader would be a huge blow to the system, but it was not enough to take down the whole Black Vatican. The Chief Extraditor could jsut appoint a new leader to be in charge of the Black Vatican’s plans again.

Therefore, the Chief Extraditor was also Mo Fan’s number-one target, save for Salan!

“It turns out that the Chief Extraditor is someone who can contact the Supreme Pontiff directly,” Mo Fan exclaimed in surprise as he read the information in the files.

The Chief Extraditor did not take orders from a Red Cardinal, but only from the Supreme Pontiff.

“The election of Red Cardinals requires the Chief Extraditor’s approval...” Mo Fan murmured.

“When the Cold Prince was executed, the Chief Extraditor incorporated the Cold Prince’s faction into Salan’s faction...” Mo Fan was able to learn more about how the Black Vatican operated through the information in the files.

It turned out that Blue Bat did not backstab the Cold Prince because he had provoked Salan by targeting Xinxia with his plans, but because Salan was trying to expand her influence!

Salan had also killed another Red Cardinal in Brazil.

The Chief Extraditor had incorporated the Cold Prince’s faction into Salan’s faction after the Prince was executed.

In other words, Salan had taken out two of the twelve Red Cardinals, and it was very likely that she had done so to take over their factions!

Salan had established her faction in China, while the other Red Cardinals had been active in foreign countries for many years. However, Salan had managed to grow her influence rapidly in just a few years, likely because she had taken out two other Red Cardinals.

“What is that lunatic planning to achieve?” Mo Fan was getting more confused.

The black Stones of Guilt were one of Salan’s motivations.

She was taking out the Magistrates who had used the Stones of Guilt to sentence Wen Tai to death, one by one.

However, if killing the Magistrates was her only motive, there was no need for her to take out entire cities. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Perhaps it was just as Blue Bat had mentioned; getting revenge on the Magistrates was only part of the grudges Salan held in her past, but she was focused more on growing her influence as the God of Death in her current life.

Perhaps Salan was not just holding a grudge against the Magistrates who had used the Stones of Guilt and killed Wen Tai, but was directing her hatred toward the twisted world.

Wen Tai had died because people in the upper class had seen him as a nuisance. The Magistrates were not the only ones who used the Stones of Guilt. They were only representing the people who wanted Wen Tai dead!

“The nine disciples? So Salan has nine disciples who are learning her skills. They must earn her approval with an impressive graduation project.”

Mo Fan had a headache.

The Blue Deacons were already giving the Enforcement Union a difficult time, but Salan was raising her disciples too!

“I have no clue who the other eight disciples are yet...”

Blue Bat was already done for. Even if Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai failed to stop her, she would never escape the Field Enforcers after her identity was exposed.

Even so, Blue Bat was only one of the nine disciples!

Huge mushroom clouds exploded into the sky behind him, grabbing his attention.

“Leave her alive!” Mo Fan called out lazily.

Flame Belle Empress immediately stopped attacking. Winnie fell from the sky and slammed into the roof of the church.

She was completely exhausted, and even struggled to stand back up.

Her young and unblemished skin was as dry as the skin of a wilted old tree from her burns. Her two husbands might even ask for a divorce if they saw her now.

He could hear the sound of a helicopter’s propellers approaching from the distance. Small things scattered across the place were sent flying by a strong wind.

Mo Fan looked up. He did see a pair of propellers, but it was a Wind Mage instead of a helicopter. His Wind Wings were a little special.

“Who are you?” Mo Fan asked him directly.

“I’m from China’s Enforcement Union!”
