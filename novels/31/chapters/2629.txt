Wasn’t it just hatched from an egg recently? How did it kill a Warrior-level Lance Spine Bear?

Most importantly… How is it already so much bigger after I was gone for just a short while?

‘The Sharkman Beast Infant feasted on the Lance Spine Bear and devoured it in practically an instant.

Zhao Manyan had a strange face. Was the infant a monster? It was only around the size of an adult man. How did it fit the whole Lance Spine Bear, which was the size of a bulldozer, into its stomach?

Shouldn’t it burst its own body? How did it digest the Lance Spine Bear in such a short time?

“What did I say? You ate too much… holy crap!” Zhao Manyan was about to tease the creature when he saw it growing at a visible speed!

It was not bloated. It was growing!

Its bones, muscles, and skin were expanding. Even its head was bigger. The creature that had just hatched from its egg was now the size of a full-grown shark!

How incredible! It was true that most creatures had to take in a lot of food to grow, but they also needed some time to digest the food. He had never heard of a creature growing on the spot after it was done eating!

On second thought, it was not that unbelievable…

Perhaps it was normal for Sharkman Beasts to grow whenever they ate after they were born. Otherwise, how could they grow to the size of a stadium? Their size was not that out-of-place in the ocean. Baxia, who was now the size of an island, might also grow whenever it ate.

“Where are your parents?” Zhao Manyan asked it.

The creature did not understand him, but it did not leave, either.

“Don’t tell me you are thinking of eating me? I’m not that fleshy, so you won’t grow much even if you ate me,” Zhao Manyan reminded it.

The creature had no intention to eat Zhao Manyan. It stuck its head closer and sniffed Zhao Manyan, before rubbing its head on his hand.

Zhao Manyan was confused, but then he quickly took out the Contract Ring he had almost thrown away.

The Ring had turned bright red without him realizing it. He remembered it was dark red before.

Zhao Manyan put the Ring on the creature’s forehead again and discovered a similar mark was there.

“Holy crap, did it really work? Was it that easy?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

He had not seen any hints from the Ring, nor did he feel any change from his soul. Zhao Manyan had no idea what the Ring had done to establish a Contract with the Sharkman Beast Infant!

Don’t tell me…

Did I catch an insanely strong creature of the ocean, just like that? Shouldn’t the sea monsters have some pride? Did I really trick the sea monster with a colorful crystal ball?

Zhao Manyan was both happy and worried. He still had no idea about the creature’s situation.

After all, it was rare to find an unguarded egg, especially when it was about to hatch. Zhao Manyan did not have high expectations for the Contract Ring, either. To his surprise, it had worked!

It had successfully signed a Contract with the Sharkman Beast Infant!

Everything had gone so smoothly that Zhao Manyan could not help but be suspicious of it.

‘The Sharkman Beast Infant kept biting at the air and grinding its teeth. It also pointed at its mouth with its fins.

“are you hungry?” Zhao Manyan asked it.

‘The Sharkman Beast Infant waved its tail happily.

“You just ate a bear!” Zhao Manyan yelled at it.

The Lance Spine Bear had been five times the size of the Sharkman Beast Infant. Its remains were still lying to the side in its own blood. Some of its meat might still be stuck between the creature’s teeth, but it was already telling him it was hungry!

A disturbing noise came from above. Zhao Manyan looked up and immediately saw a Sharkman with muscles as thick as metal plates looking down at Zhao Manyan and the Sharkman Beast Infant.

Zhao Manyan’s head began to hurt.

It seemed like the infant’s parents were here. They were surely going to kill him to terminate the Contract!

The Dark Iron Sharkman jumped down from the building and landed heavily on the ground. Its knee slammed into the concrete and crushed a hole in it. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The Dark Iron Sharkman looked at the remains of the Lance Spine Bear and Zhao Manyan.

It walked toward Zhao Manyan while its jaws were opening and closing, making the sound of a grinder.

The Sharkman Beast Infant suddenly pounced at the Sharkman and bit at it. Judging by its excited expression, it was treating the Sharkman as food, not like a parent!

‘The Dark Iron Sharkman stepped aside suddenly to dodge the Sharkman Beast Infant’s attack. It grabbed the Sharkman Beast Infant’s tail and flung it to the ground!

The Sharkman Beast Infant cried out as its body twitched in pain.

Zhao Manyan was startled. He did not expect the two creatures to fight one another so fiercely. It had looked like they were of the same species!

The Dark Iron Sharkman was obviously a Commander-level creature, and a lot stronger than the Lance Spine Bear. Zhao Manyan flicked a golden bead at the Dark Iron Sharkman as it was about to slice into the Sharkman Beast Infant!

The golden bead contained great power. It hit the Dark Iron Sharkman like a truck.

‘The building behind the Dark Iron Sharkman collapsed. Its tough body was also broken in many places, its blood splattering all over the place.

It did not die. It let out an angry cry, like it was calling for help. However, the Sharkman Beast Infant crawled back to its feet. It lunged at the Dark Iron Sharkman fearlessly and bit its head off!

The Sharkman Beast Infant was having trouble biting into the Dark Iron Sharkman, but it kept munching and swallowing its flesh regardless.

“How did you even bite it?” Zhao Manyan asked helplessly.

The Dark Iron Sharkman’s skin was as tough as metal. Even an Advanced Spell could not break it, but the Sharkman Beast Infant was biting the thing into pieces and swallowing them.

The Sharkman Beast Infant seemed very hungry. It had eaten the whole Sharkman!

A magical sight took place once again. The Sharkman Beast Infant started growing once more.

It had grown to the size of a car, obviously having received a lot of energy from eating the Commander-level creature!
