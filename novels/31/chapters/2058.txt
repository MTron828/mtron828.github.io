Maggie’s golden hair suddenly moved around like snakes. Her face was shedding and falling to the ground in disgusting lumps.

“Deceptive Manifestation!” Bola exclaimed after realizing what was happening.

Maggie was wearing three-inch heels. Her slender legs had taken up two-thirds of her body ratio. The sharp heels were stuck firmly into the ground.

Maggie catwalked ahead. Her face was still transforming. Strange bones poked out from the back of her clothes before expanding like the wings of an eagle.

“Fielding, Fielding,” Bola murmured in disappointment after seeing Maggie’s transformation.

An old man slowly appeared behind Maggie. He stared at the pale-faced Bola and let out a sigh, “I’m sorry. You serve only the Demon, but I serve only my queen.”

“Bola, you must have been asleep for too long. You are as stupid as those humans!” Maggie smiled.

“I might not be the smartest, but it’s a relief that I’ve lived longer than any of you. I’ve learned that humans are the least reliable,” Bola said.

“It’s too late to regret it now. In two minutes, the Holy Court Mages will surround this place. Unfortunately, a young woman happened to die in the building over there after her blood was sucked dry. I believe the Holy Judgment Court will look into it,” Maggie announced smugly.

Mo Fan frowned when he saw Maggie’s transformation.

The woman whom Mu Ningxue had lured to the crossroad was a human. She was the real owner of the shop, who liked to put on thick makeup and color her lips red.

What surprised Mo Fan was the fact that Bola’s helper had already colluded with Euryale!

Most importantly, even the Holy Court Mage whom they were relying on was fake. She was Euryale’s disguise!

Deception!

Euryale was extremely good at deceiving people. She could claim a person’s voice, appearance, and demeanor, so that even the Eye of the Golden Dragon could not see through her disguise! It was indeed not easy to take out an old demon creature like her. They were unable to tell who was the real Euryale and who was her disguise.

“What now?” Mo Fan asked Bola. His head had begun to hurt.

“My master, I already told you that living a long life has its merits,” Bola replied.

“Merits my ass, even your loyal friend has betrayed you!” Mo Fan snapped.

“If you live long enough, you will understand that even the strongest friendships will fade away as time goes by. Many people keep calling my name and recalling the youth we shared, but ten years later, it would deteriorate. My first friend easily told others my name and location just so he could earn a position in the Magic Association. My second friend, when I told him I was about to die, dug up my grave and stole my beloved funerary objects just so he could buy some magic Equipment for his son. My eyes were closed while I listened to him complaining about how selfish I was. If I was able to shed tears, he would have realized that I was still alive. I was just in deep slumber...” Bola said like a grieving bard.

“Ugh... you can get your revenge on them before they set foot into their graves,” Mo Fan assured him.

“Fielding was my friend. Our friendship lasted for twenty years. That was already quite impressive. Humans are incomprehensible. Five years is enough for a person to change completely. Even the strongest relationship is no match for petty gains to them,” Bola went on.

Fielding blushed in shame after hearing the words.

However, Bola had said it all. Memories were only good for recollection, but it did not necessarily mean he was obliged to do anything. His only concern was to live a few years longer and retain his youth, like Euryale!

“Stop being emotional. This isn’t an anime where you can recall your past for a few episodes, yet only a few seconds have passed in reality. The Holy Court Mages will be here in thirty seconds!” Mo Fan said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I lied to you. I didn’t really just meet my old friends. The truth is, I had already had children back when I was still building the old Sacred City. My children worked extremely hard. Their family is now a reputable clan in the Sacred City. One of my great-great-grandchildren is a Great Judicator, and a righteous man. He came to the Parthenon Temple and went down on his knees to talk to me, so I gave him some useful advice. He promised me that he would do anything for me, as long as it wasn’t against the Sacred Constitution,” Bola went on calmly.

“So what?” Mo Fan said impatiently when he saw Bola still telling a story at his own pace.

“So the Holy Court Mages won’t be here. My great-great-grandchild has also established a Domain of Mirroring Space around us. It can protect every non-living thing in our surroundings and prevent any destructive magic from leaking out,” Bola informed Mo Fan.

“I still don’t understand!” Mo Fan rolled his eyes.

“It means you can do whatever you want, but the energy of your spells won’t leak outside. The Eye of the Golden Dragon won’t bother looking here either, nor will the Holy Court Mages show up...” Bola finished up.

“Why did you have to make it so complicated?” Mo Fan sighed.

It turned out Bola had a backup plan in mind. What a great relief! He had thought they were done for!

“Euryale is good at deceiving her enemies. You must find out which person is the real her if you are serious about taking her out. We have our answer now!” Bola looked at Maggie.

“Bola, did you visit me on purpose?” Fielding turned around. The Holy Court Mages had not shown up, exactly as Bola had said would happen.

It had already been three minutes. The Holy Court Mages were never late. Mu Ningxue had just used an Ice Spell above the Advanced Level. The Holy Court Mages should be here by now!

Maggie was dumbfounded too. She did not expect her plan to beat Bola at his own game had already been exposed. Bola had been trying to bait her out all along!

“You were the third person I visited,” Bola informed him blandly.

Fielding was struggling to breathe properly. The moment Bola left his shop, he had immediately informed the Eagle Demoness he had ties with about Bola’s plan. The Eagle Demoness relayed the information to their queen, Euryale.

Euryale had learned everything from Fielding and the real Maggie. She used her ability to take on Maggie’s appearance and pretended to take part in the operation in order to find out who was trying to take her out. She was planning to get rid of them all at once, but she did not expect Bola to be so cunning!

Bola was as spicy as old ginger!
