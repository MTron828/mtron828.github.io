The throat of the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was a lot thicker than the Tactile Centipede Demon’s from before. The creature fully digested the fiery phoenix before it could even reach the creature’s stomach. It seemed perfectly fine, apart from some remaining flames coming out of its mouth.

The fact that the flames were unable to burn through the undead’s stomach showed how extraordinary the undead was. The Chinese team would only have a chance after the Night Rakshasa figured out where its weakness was!

The Little Loach Pendant was extremely fond of the Pharaoh Spring. There was no way Mo Fan would give up on the great opportunity; he had to slay the giant undead creature!

The brains hanging beside the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s mouth turned toward Mo Fan, each spitting out a cloudy beam, the same move that it used to knock the Flying Creek Snow Wolf away.

Mo Fan had no chance of dodging the attack while in mid-air. He pushed his hand forward and summoned a shield with his will to defend himself.

The shield had a silver frame, and nothing but air within it. However, the cloudy beams were completely blocked off by the shield, unable to move any closer to him.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon gave up, knowing that its little tricks could not inflict any damage on Mo Fan. It slammed right into him with its enormous body, since it was definitely the most effective move against an ant-like human!

The creature felt like a pillar collapsing. Mo Fan basically saw a giant shadow looming over him, blocking the sunlight above him.

As its body moved closer, Mo Fan could see its legs swinging wildly, like gleaming axes!

Mo Fan was unable to dodge in time. The creature’s body slammed heavily onto him, knocking him into the ground of the island.

The whole island shook. Shattered rocks sank into the ocean. More seawater poured into the island from the cracks, and soon reached the surface!

Mo Fan barely prevented himself from being turned into minced meat by Summoning the Black Snake Armor in time. However, he was still stuck underground, and the seawater was coming right at him...

Mo Fan was stuck in the ravine. The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon seemed to know that Mo Fan was still alive. It raised its body high up in the air again before slamming down even stronger than before.

“Are you treating me like a fly!?” Mo Fan was infuriated. He quickly cast Fleeing Shadow, splitting his body into four shadows flying into different directions like shadows of sparrows.

A second later, the island trembled once again. An enormous ring of waves appeared on the ocean and spread away from the island. The ships nearby were pushed back by the strong waves!

Even the barrier was unable to resist the impact. The organizer could not help but worry about the participants’ safety!

“Mo Fan, I found it! Its weakness is in its brains. You just need to destroy all the brains!” Jiang Yu shouted.

Mo Fan lifted his gaze and saw a nimble, black figure lunging at one of the brains on the neck of the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon. The figure’s sharp claws severed the brain with a clean cut!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was extremely furious after losing its brain. It stared at the Night Rakshasa moving on its head. Its body suddenly emitted a poisonous mist, knocking the Night Rakshasa that was sneaking around into the air.

The Night Rakshasa fell away from the creature. Her black fur was dyed blue and red, and her sharp claws were falling off from the corrosion.

Jiang Yu felt his heart aching. He quickly withdrew the Night Rakshasa back into his Contracted Space.

The Night Rakshasa had done a great job severing one of the creature’s brains!

“Mo Fan, it’s all you now, there’s nothing we can do,” Jiang Yu said.

“Sure, leave it to me!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Humph, you might be useless, but not everyone is the same as you. I’ll take it out!” Guan Yu insisted.

Guan Yu immediately disappeared. A few seconds later, the team saw Guan Yu being driven by a strong wind as he sprinted along the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s body, currently almost perpendicular to the ground.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon quickly noticed Guan Yu. Its legs suddenly separated from its body and turned into strange-looking bugs with pointy heads, and chased after Guan Yu.

Guan Yu realized that the path ahead was no longer an option. He leapt into the air instead. “Wind Wings!”

Strong winds started blowing, turning into wings on Guan Yu’s back. As the wings beat, Guan Yu rose and almost reached the height of the creature’s brains.

Guan Yu was extremely quick on the attack. As a brown flicker swept past, one of the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s brains burst open, strange ichor pouring out of it.

Guan Yu was aiming for another brain, but the bugs with pointy heads flew at him and clustered onto him, dragging him back to the ground.

More bugs dived at Guan Yu, wrapping him up in layers. Jiang Yu immediately shook his head with a sigh and moved to save Guan Yu from the mess he was in.

“Six more to go!” Mo Fan said.

The Night Rakshasa had severed one, and Guan Yu had pierced through one. Mo Fan would have to deal with the rest.

Frost surged into the air on a sudden strong wind. Mo Fan was still figuring the most effective way to destroy the brains when the Flying Creek Snow Wolf took the initiative and made his way up the creature’s body to get his revenge!

“Wolf, come over here, bring me up!” Mo Fan stopped the Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf was already halfway up the creature. He had no choice but to turn back, as he knew he could not take on the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon alone.

Mo Fan did a flip and landed on the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s back.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled. An icy mountain popped up, extending toward the creature like a bridge.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf sprinted along the bridge as if he was running in the air, heading straight toward the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s head. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Dodge!” Mo Fan warned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf when he saw the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon swinging its tail.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf stomped and leapt into the air, dodging the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s tail. As the Flying Creek Snow Wolf started to fall, he howled again, Summoning an icy mountain with incredible speed so he could land safely.

“I’ll build a bridge for you!” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan’s eyes emitted a silver light. He snapped the icy mountains and rocks and lifted them into the air.

The rocks and ice seemed to scatter messily in the air, but each of them was actually the same distance apart.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf howled excitedly when he saw the floating stepping boards in the air. His jumping ability was outstanding to begin with, so all he needed was a few stepping stones.

“It’s coming again, dodge!” Mo Fan said.

With the stepping boards in the air, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf had no trouble dodging the attack. It moved like a flash of white lightning, leaping from the rock on the left to the right, before jumping up high and sprinting across the floating bridge to dodge the continuous attacks from the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon!

“Well done! Flame sword!”

With the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s help, Mo Fan had gotten very close to the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s brains. A burning sword appeared in his hand!

Ignoring the strong wind, Mo Fan stood on the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s back. He leapt forward decisively when the cloudy rays swept past them, heading to the right side of the creature.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf had great synergy with Mo Fan. Seeing Mo Fan was attacking from the right, he went to the left instead, utilizing the floating rocks that Mo Fan had prepared. He unleashed all his strength and speed and tore a brain on the left apart.

On the other hand, Mo Fan slashed with the fiery sword, destroying a brain on the right. The flames even spread to another brain!

The brain that was set aflame struggled fiercely. It looked like it was afraid of fire.

“Fiery Fist!” Mo Fan clenched his fists when the fiery sword disappeared, firing two fiery dragons at the throbbing brain. The dragons lunged at the brain and blasted it into ashes!

“That’s three!” Mo Fan said, signaling the Flying Creek Snow Wolf to catch him.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf headed toward Mo Fan, but the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s throat intercepted him. Luckily, the Flying Creek Snow Wolf managed to locate a flying rock that he could land on in time. Otherwise, he would be going straight down the Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s stomach!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon’s throat was impenetrable. The wolf would surely die if he ended up being eaten by the undead centipede!

Without the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s help, Mo Fan had little way to move in the air. He could not fly using the Fleeing Shadow. He could only stick closely to objects and move between shadows!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon was quite cunning, too. It knew Mo Fan was crippled when he was in the air. After driving the Flying Creek Snow Wolf away, it turned around. The seam down its chest opened suddenly, revealing many pairs of densely packed red eyes!

Mo Fan was startled. -So this is where the creature’s eyes are, hundreds of them!- Mo Fan felt his blood freezing the moment he was stared at!

“Mo Fan, have a taste of the Cursed Eyes! It’s no different than going to Hell!” Neferu said in a cold voice.

Mo Fan finally realized that the eyes were casting a Curse on him. His blood had stopped flowing, his skin and flesh had hardened, all because of the creature’s power.

Several hundred eyes were emitting Cursed lights, penetrating into Mo Fan’s Spiritual World. Despite his mental strength reaching the intermediate stage, he was struggling to resist!

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon opened its mouth and swallowed Mo Fan with a single bite as soon as he was placed under the Curse, as if it was worried that Mo Fan would run away again.

The Giant Tactile Centipede Demon did not have a tongue. Its mouth only had circles of fangs, only useful when the creature was eating something big. For something as small as Mo Fan, it would just swallow him. The man would turn into a pool of liquid half an hour after he was swallowed!
