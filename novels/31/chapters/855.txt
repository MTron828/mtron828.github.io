The bone saber was black, yet emitting an icy glow. The glossy surface even reflected Sayed’s evil grin!

The giant saber first appeared, followed by the undead’s body. Unlike the muscular appearance of the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy, the second undead was exceedingly fleshy, covered in layers of winding sheets...

White burial sheets was a symbolic feature of the mummies from Egypt. However, most mummies were dried corpses, and were expected to be skinny, yet this particular mummy was quite plump. Even its belly was popping out.

As a matter of fact, there were undead with fleshy bodies too, but the fat mummy was not clumsy as it seemed. Anyone would have trouble feeling at ease after seeing the black saber it was holding in his hand!

The mummy was around five meters tall. It was basically a chariot for the bone saber, which was around six meters long. Its size had a strong visual impact when compared to the average size of a human!

The mummy roared like an ox, but its cry was nothing like an animal. Everyone’s ears were buzzing from the loud rumble.

“This is my Death Saber Mummy; I hope you will enjoy the fight!” Sayed burst out laughing.

The Death Saber Mummy had an astonishing aura. It immediately swung the black saber wildly before Yue Tangxin could analyze its type...

The creature had remarkable strength. It was able to swing the heavy saber in a full circle!

“Are you kidding... it was so far away,” the students were dumbfounded.

The Death Saber Mummy was at least a hundred meters away from Yue Tangxin. Everyone thought she would be safe as long as she maintained the distance from the undead, not because there was no spell that could reach her, but because most Magicians were able to react in time at such a distance.

The black saber slashed fiercely. Everyone could see the Death Saber Mummy’s flesh twitching.

The saber sprang forward. It did not just cut through the air, it even slashed the ground in half...

An obvious shockwave flew rapidly across the air, followed by the ground rupturing as if an earthquake was taking place. The force tore a huge ravine along the ground!

The ravine was a hundred meters long. It slashed the magic vines and the Forest of Kun along the way in half. Pieces of wood scattered in the air as a strong gust of wind followed the slash...

Violent, imperious!

The slash had completely destroyed Yue Tangxin’s setup. The shockwave was still heading for Yue Tangxin, leaving a deep cut on her armor. It was inches away from cutting through her skin!

Yue Tangxin stood blankly. The vines were drifting wildly in the wind. She stared at the shocking ravine. The slash was clearly executed a hundred meters away, yet it felt like the bone saber was swung right in front of her. Her heart was pounding heavily!

Yue Tangxin was fully focused on the Death Saber Mummy. She totally forgot that the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy had broken free after the vines were destroyed. The creature was fairly close to her too.

Yue Tangxin was stunned. She knew she had lost the duel when she saw the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy approaching her.

“I concede... AH!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yue Tangxin raised her hand to signal to judge Bai Dongwei and Sayed that she forfeited the duel.

She did not want to get hurt, as it would stop her from participating in the training. She had only conceded when she knew she had no chance of dodging the Gray-Cloth Iron Mummy’s attack.

However, Yue Tangxin did not expect the attack to come so quickly. She could not even finish her sentence when she felt a strong force colliding into her. The thin layer of armor she was wearing failed to make any difference. Her body was slightly out of shape!

The sound of bones fracturing was loud and clear enough that the whole crowd of more than a hundred people in the hall fell silent.

Yue Tangxin’s body was heavily deformed as she was knocked into the air. The students watching the fight could clearly feel the pain she was suffering...

“Asshole, didn’t you see her surrender!?” cursed Bai Dongwei immediately.

Sayed was about to apologize, but his expression darkened when he heard Bai Dongwei’s curse. He said coldly, “First of all, she should have surrendered earlier! She didn’t really finish her sentence there! Second, even though the undead is following my orders, it’s not really me! They are violent in nature to begin with, so even if I tried to stop it, it wouldn’t necessarily stop its attack in time!”

Bai Dongwei was so furious that he simply had the urge to teach the proud Egyptian a lesson himself. However, he was not in the mood to waste his time with the man after seeing Yue Tangxin’s condition. He quickly went over to check on her.

“How is it? How is she doing?”

“How vicious; if the attack was slightly stronger, Yue Tangxin would be dead by now,” said the Healer, clenching his teeth.

“Just make sure she survives.”

“Help me out, hold her shoulders and legs in place, they are fully broken... Instructor, you should visit the Oriental Pearl Tower Magic Association and ask for a higher-level Healer. I...I can’t guarantee that I can save her,” said the Healer sternly.

“I’ll bring her over,” said Bai Dongwei.

“We can’t do that; we can’t let her bones fracture any further. The broken bones might puncture her arteries and organs. I’m afraid that her condition will worsen with even the slightest movement,” explained the Healer.

“What... seriously...” The watching students were stunned by the words.

How cruel was the Egyptian? Did he really have to go so far? It was only a duel, there was no need to inflict such serious damage to Yue Tangxin, regardless of how weak she was!

Everyone felt a chill running down their spine when they saw the Yue Tangxin’s distorted body.

Bai Dongwei quickly went to make the call. Luckily, the place was fairly close to the Magic Association. An Advanced Healer was readily available most of the time.

Not long after, a male Advanced Magician in casual clothes arrived. He immediately saw the seriously injured Yue Tangxin and cast an Advanced Healing Spell on her. A white Star Constellation appeared around him...

“Lend me a hand,” the plain-clothed Magician told the student Healer.

“Sure.”

“We have to move the broken bones at once. They are already stuck in her veins,” said the plain-clothed Healer.

“I...I...” the student was terrified. Her condition was a lot worse than he had imagined!

“Stop talking, focus on directing her blood flow. I’ll move the broken bones. Remember to unclog her blood as soon as I remove the bones.”

“Got it!” confirmed the student Healer.
