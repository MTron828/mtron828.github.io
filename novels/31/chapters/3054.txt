3055 A Charge That Is Hard to Prove Innocent

Archangel Ramiel snorted coldly, turned, and left the courtyard where Mo Fan was imprisoned.

After walking a few steps, he still turned around while feeling uneasy.

“Go and arrange for someone to come to the courtyard. Buy him whatever that he wants,” said Archangel Ramiel.

“Huh? Why do we need to please him? Are you still afraid of him?”

“Just do as I said and stop asking!” Archangel Ramiel glared at the ignorant Holy Judge Officer.

The Holy Judge Officer did not dare to talk back after being scolded. He could only nod his head non-stop.

Archangel Ramiel did not explain this to the Holy Judge Officer. After all, he did not know why he did this. It was probably because Mo Fan exuded an aura that made him feel uneasy. Everyone in the Holy City still had not figured out why he turned himself in.

It would be best if they could deal with this monster peacefully.

He would satisfy Mo Fan’s desire to go shopping, soak in hot springs, go karaoke, and eat pizza before the trial. It was just like fulfilling the last request of a death row prisoner before execution. It was all because of humanitarianism, not because he was afraid of Mo Fan!

What was there to be afraid of a person who had already been imprisoned in the Holy City?

With so many masters in the Holy City, how could it be impossible to subdue someone who had just become a demon?

…

There were many delicacies on Sixth Avenue. During mealtime, many famous restaurants were full of people who lined up to eat outside the windows.

The gourmet restaurants from all over the world on Sixth Avenue were also a major feature of Holy City, which had always been full of tourists. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

There was an Italian pizzeria on the street. The aroma of hot pizza could always bring people unlimited appetite. A man in a Holy Judge uniform was waiting outside with a look of displeasure. It was rare to see a Holy Judge on duty buying pizza, so a few tourists went over to take a group photo. However, they were all driven away impatiently by this person.

“Something must be wrong with the brains of the higher-ups. When did the Holy City have to be so polite to a prisoner?” Zu Xiangtian was so angry that he wanted to throw the pizza on the ground and step on it a few times before delivering it to that person’s mouth.

As a Holy Judge, a Holy Judge who was about to be promoted to the Chief Holy Judge, he thought that Archangel Ramiel was going to entrust him with an important task. Zu Xiangtian, who finally got a little favor, was filled with excitement at that moment.

It turned out that his task was to deliver food!

He could not even let the restaurant’s delivery staff deliver it to the Holy Palace. The Holy Judges had to go to the restaurants to buy it in person and deliver the food to the courtyard to prevent someone from disguising himself as a delivery staff to send important messages to Mo Fan!

‘Oh my god! Is that how we treat a prisoner? The leaders of Holy City even have to avoid arousing suspicion when they instruct their subordinates to do chores!’

Of course, even though Zu Xiangtian thought so, he did not dare do anything with the food. Mo Fan was not stupid. He could detect even a speck of dust that entered the food after sealing it, let alone his dirty shoe prints!

…

After half an hour, Zu Xiangtian arrived at the courtyard where Mo Fan was temporarily staying with pizza and iced cola. His face never brightened.

“Where’s the special hot sauce? I wanted two. It doesn’t taste good if it’s not spicy,” Mo Fan said to Zu Xiangtian.

Zu Xiangtian took out two packs of special hot sauce from the bottom of the bag and stood beside him with a lifeless look.

“Let’s eat together. We’re old acquaintances, so don’t be shy,” Mo Fan said to Zu Xiangtian.

“I don’t want to eat,” Zu Xiangtian said.

“If there’s poison in it, what should I do if I die in the courtyard? If you don’t eat it, I won’t eat it either. I’ll order something else.” Mo Fan handed Zu Xiangtian a plate.

Zu Xiangtian almost fainted from anger.

Not only did he have to deliver him food, but he also had to eat it to see if it was poisonous.

Was he an emperor?!

“Xiangtian, just do as he said. Archangel Ramiel has told you that as long as he doesn’t leave this yard, you can meet some of his needs,” Holy Shadow Brooke said to Zu Xiangtian.

Zu Xiangtian’s face darkened even more. He could only sit in the courtyard and eat pizza with Mo Fan. Zu Xiangtian could not handle spicy food, but Mo Fan put a lot of hot sauce on the pizza. After taking a bite, beads of sweat immediately covered his forehead.

“How is it? It tastes good, right?” Mo Fan asked with a smile.

“You don’t have much time left to be proud. You can make fun of me as much as you like, but I won’t care about you. In short, your death is coming, and I can still live a long life!” Zu Xiangtian did not want to be humiliated by Mo Fan, so he stopped contemplating and ate the spicy pizza.

“Don’t be like that. I didn’t ask you to serve me. It was your superiors who arranged it. I’m not taking a shot at you. Besides, it’s meaningless to take a shot at you.” Mo Fan took a piece of pizza. He spoke calmly while taking a bite of it.

“I thought you were strong, but in the end, you are relying on evil ways. You deserve to be a prisoner in Holy City!” Zu Xiangtian said.

“When magic was first discovered, it was also called strange magic and sorcery by the ancients. Many wizards and pioneers were burned to death in Europe,” Mo Fan replied.

“That’s not the same. You used the Red Demon to commit crimes for you all over the world. Why do you think your freedom is restricted? It’s because the priests have collected much evidence of the Red Demon’s crimes, each of which is shocking and outrageous! I thought people like me were already somewhat of a scumbag, but you are the real demon,” said Zu Xiangtian.

“Everyone knows that you are a scumbag, but whether I’m a demon is yet to be verified,” Mo Fan said.

All the priests in Holy City were concerned about a core issue.

The Red Demon worked for Mo Fan.

It was Mo Fan who was instigating the Red Demon to commit crimes all over the world to collect all kinds of evil energy for him.

It was difficult to prove that.

When a villain, who robbed everywhere, got a large amount of gold and silver treasures and gave them to Mo Fan, it was logical to say that Mo Fan was the main culprit behind the curtain.

More importantly, Mo Fan’s demon blood was closely related to the Sublimed Evil Bead, and the Demon Element was excellent proof that Mo Fan was the most powerful Red Demon in the world!

The Holy City used various methods to collect information about Mo Fan’s incarnation as a demon. From the first time he incarnated as a demon in the desolated city of Jinlin until the last time he killed the parade archangel as a demon, all the data had been gathered.

The Demon Element had always been a powerful and terrifying heresy ability in the eyes of the Holy Judgment Court. Mo Fan was regarded as a heretic before, which meant that there were already signs of chaos in the Holy City’s Holy Judgment Court.

The Red Demon, Kazuaki, and the Archangel, Shalitha, set up a difficult situation where Mo Fan could not exonerate himself from his crimes, thus making Mo Fan the most powerful Red Demon and Wicked God. In this way, Mo Fan would bear all the crimes that the Red Demon committed in the past.

Holy City had presented the first piece of evidence. Mo Fan was the most powerful Red Demon, and the Red Demon, Kazuaki, was his accomplice.

The source of the demon’s blood, those experimental products that failed to become demonized, the birth of the Sublimed Evil Bead, and the final promotion to the Eight Souls of the Wicked God were all closely related to Mo Fan.
