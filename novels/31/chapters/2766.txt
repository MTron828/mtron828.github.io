Chapter 2767: Aquarius Magic Formation

Strange sounds came from the mountains. At first, they were not so loud but the sound built on itself and rose to a crescendo.

Hunter Dirty Demons were coming from the direction of the mountain.

Hunter Dirty Demons were a special species among Ocean Demons. The smaller they were, the more vicious they appeared to be.

In the vast army of Hunter Dirty Demons, they could see some thin and fierce shadows moving at an impossible speed. They were only equivalent to large voles, but the aura they emitted was terrifying.

They surrounded the Silver-Blue Valley City, and many of them had already circled behind to attack directly from the heights of the valley and the steep terrain.

For Ocean Demons like Hunter Dirty Demons, even the lowest-level Hunter Dirty Demons had the strength of warlord-level creatures. Such terrain could not hinder their attacks as they could climb vertical rock walls with sharp claws like insects!

Mo Fan stared at the back and found that a group of Ice Claw Hunter Dirty Demons was getting closer. However, all the Royal Mages, including Pang Lai, did not seem to care much about the enemies coming from behind, and they all stared at Silver-Blue Valley City’s narrow entrance.

“What about the enemies coming from the back?” Mo Fan asked.

“Ignore them. They can’t come over,” Jiang Yu said.

‘Why could they not come over?’ Mo Fan felt the Ice Claw Hunter Dirty Demons had stepped into the city streets.

“Start the formation!” Pang Lai shouted.

A large group of dreamy and beautiful light like stardust suddenly shone from the three mountains where the mages had been moments before. If they looked closely, they could find countless zero crystals of different shapes embedded in the light. Their edges and corners refracted so many colors, and these visible lights shrouded the Silver-Blue Valley City entirely.

The lights were vivid. They were not transparent. They were constantly absorbing energy and gradually condensing into a solid porcelain form.

There were more and more zero crystals. They were arranged in a very tight structure in the light. The lights they released had also changed. From Mo Fan’s direction, it looked like huge translucent-colored porcelain that wrapped the entire second half of the Silver-Blue Valley City.

At the same time, the lights in the other two positions also refracted similar solid porcelain light. The two side lights formed were just hyperboloids that were asymptotically inward. Eventually, a huge ceramic bottle mouth formed at the narrow entrance of the Silver-Blue Valley City!

Song Feiyao anxiously looked down at the situation on the ground from the sky. It was too late for her to fly down to support them. The black stingrays formed a terrifying cloud over the city making it impossible for the Green East Sea God to fly down.

Before Song Feiyao’s vision was blocked, she saw a scene that surprised her. The entire Silver-Blue Valley City suddenly dazzled as thought seen inside a huge porcelain light bottle.

A bottle that could hold an entire city!

Song Fei Yao had never seen such magic before, but it made her feel a little more at ease. At least the Ocean Demons would not besiege Mo Fan and the others from all sides.

She had to think of other ways to rescue the group of people trapped inside instead of impulsively attacking the monsters.

...

Silver-Blue Valley City was in the bottle. The bottle was lying on the ground. The mouth overlapped with the entrance of the city and the bottom of the bottle covered the back of the city. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The bottom of the bottle was generally the thickest and most sturdy part. Mo Fan saw the Ice Claw Hunter Dirty Demons slamming into the colorful bottom of the huge bottle. Their claws broke but they couldn’t even scratch the surface of the bottle. Mo Fan understood why Pang Lai had told him to ignore the enemies at the back. With such an incomparably powerful Aquarius Magic Formation, they did not need to concern themselves with the enemies attacking from behind.

The curved surface of the bottle was the weakest part of the entire formation, but the Ocean Demons also needed to recuperate to smash the curved surface.

They seem to be in a solid bottle. No matter how large the number of enemies was and where they came from, they must pass through the narrow mouth of the bottle if they wanted to attack them.

What a good formation!Mo Fan could not help but admire Pang Lai even more.

He lamented his lack of knowledge. If he had learned this formation earlier, he would not have to worry about facing a large number of enemies.

The three Great Mages were already guarding the bottle mouth.

Aquarius Magic Formation was a tactical magic formation, not a protective barrier. Its purpose was to prevent a small team of Mages from being besieged from all sides. In this way, they could concentrate on dealing with enemies from only one direction.

The enemy could still come in through the mouth of the bottle, so fighting was inevitable.

The Ocean Demons would not retreat. They tried to break the bottle many times, but they could not even scratch it. They slowly found an opening at the entrance. But the entrance was small so not many Ocean Demons could enter at a time.

Bang!

Suddenly, there was a loud noise from the side. Many tentacles with strange lumps wrapped around the side of the bottle.

The strength of the tentacles was astonishing. Every attack of it would cause the surrounding mountains to tremble. The Silver-Blue Valley City also trembled slightly.

“It’s that creature again.” Mo Fan recognized the Strange Lump Squid King.

Strange Lump Squid King began to climb on the wall of the bottle. Its long and soft body quickly covered the top of the Hexagon Fountain Square. When it climbed to the top, many of its tentacles spread and tightly stuck to the lower half of the bottle.

Strange Lump Squid King began to use all its strength to crush the bottle!

“It’s wasting its energy.” Jiang Yu looked very calm and was not frightened by the monster above his head that was several times larger than a building.

Mo Fan had been paying attention to the lights of the bottle, and he found no cracks on the bottle yet.

Strange Lump Squid King used various means, including the venom that could melt steel, to attack the bottle but it could not even scratch the surface.

Strange Lump Squid King was furious. It stared at Mo Fan abgily.

“Puny human, do you think it’s safe to hide inside? I’ll strangle you when I climb in!”

A strange voice rang in Mo Fan’s mind. The voice was female and shrill. It sounded vicious and mad.
