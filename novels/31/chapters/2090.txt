A minute was not a long period of time. The leader of the mercenaries lit a cigarette. He was acting just like a judge, casually waiting for the ghost who had just entered Hell to confess their misdeeds so he could decide its punishment!

The foreman looked at Mo Fan.

“Kid, I’m really sorry,” The foreman was already tearing up. The tears became two lines of stain marks after mixing with the dust.

Mo Fan did not answer.

The foreman rose to his feet and cursed. “I just realized you aren’t from our mine. I’m sorry for getting you involved. I wasn’t able to protect you, but at least we can keep one another company in Hell. These assh**** will receive their karma eventually!”

“Who were you cursing, you fat pig? I’m pretty sure you are tired of living!” the mercenary with blue hair spat at him.

The leader of the mercenaries stopped smoking, and his face darkened further.

“I’m cursing you all, the Battle Beast Mercenary Group? You’re just a bunch of sons of b**ches. Do you seriously think I’m afraid of you? Just f**king do it if you want to bury us alive. I won’t forgive you even when I turn into a ghost. I’ll skin you all alive when I see you in Hell!” the foreman pointed at the leader of the mercenaries and vented.

The man was holding a lit cigarette with the tips of his fingers. He pinched the cigarette to put it out after only taking two puffs from it.

Hunters and mercenaries alike were overwhelmed by fear whenever they heard the name Fu Ying, yet a foreman of some lousy mine was cursing him instead?

“If you’re so impatient to die, I’m more than willing to do the honor. How courageous of you. Someone else here will bury the kid even if you don’t!” Fu Ying’s voice was piercing, and his glasses were slanting to one side. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The man seemed to have lost his temper!

As the man grew angrier, the Green-Skinned Beast under his legs roared too. It began swinging its heavy arm at the foreman’s head.

The foreman was still cursing. He was already doomed either way. He had to spit out the dirtiest word in his last moment!

BANG!

The heavy arm landed on the ground, the cement caving in and forming a pit twenty meters across.

The rest of the miners closed their eyes. They did not want to witness the gory sight.

Ashes were swept into the air. The Green-Skinned Beast stared at the ground. It lifted its leg and was about to stomp the spot where the foreman had been standing.

“Rock Fang Impale!”

Extremely sharp and sturdy rocks emerged from the ground as Mo Fan waved his hand.

There were sixteen of them, each with a golden-brown surface. They appeared just as the Green-Skinned Beast was stomping down.

The Rock Fangs drove up through the Green-Skinned Beast’s hooves, nailing it to the ground. Green blood immediately poured out. The creature screamed in agony, struggling to pull its hooves off of the spikes.

The Green-Skinned Beast had sturdy hooves, and would normally just break piercing objects Summoned by magic to pieces, but unfortunately for it, the first additional effect of Mo Fan’s Earth Element had come into play. The golden-brown rocks had insanely high density whenever they were used against sturdy objects!

The dust dissipated. The people looked ahead and realized the foreman was still alive and perfectly unharmed. On the other hand, the terrifying Green-Skinned Beast’s hooves were punctured. A few Rock Fangs had gone right through its knees and its legs!

“Karma never waits!” Mo Fan said, patting the foreman on the shoulder.

The foreman thought he was going to die, yet he was well alive. He did not understand why the kid was smiling at him when they were about to die. Did he not understand the situation? He might be able to defend them briefly, but he would not stand a chance against so many mercenaries!

“It seems like burying you alive is being too merciful toward you!” the leader of the mercenaries, Fu Ying, half-screamed.

“I was complaining how those Bright-Colored Beasts were too weak for me to test out my new ability, but you assh**** happened to be here...!” Mo Fan let out a dramatic sigh on their behalf.

“You seem to be good at putting up a front?” the leader of the mercenaries grinned. He flicked a finger in Mo Fan’s direction, and a screeching howl suddenly swept past Mo Fan.

Killing Tone: Bow!

Fu Ying was using the Intermediate Spell of the Sound Element. He was obviously an experienced Sound Mage. It was difficult to tell he was using his magic.

However, Mo Fan was completely aware of Fu Ying’s intentions with the help of the Circle of Crystal Teeth.

The Battle Beast Mercenary Group was not too weak. It would be impossible to defeat them with only the Circle of Crystal Teeth!

Mo Fan reached out his hand as he sensed the Sound Magic approach. He set up a defensive wall with his Will to nullify the attack.

The sound arrow was quite impressive. It ended up leaving a cut on Mo Fan’s palm!

The cut was a mere thread, and only started bleeding after some time, reddening the skin around the nick.

Fu Ying was a little surprised that his Sound Magic had not killed the young man.

Mo Fan was surprised too. He had underestimated the mercenary’s Sound Element. The enemy’s attack was slightly stronger than he had expected. He had failed to nullify it entirely.

However, it still did Mo Fan a favor, since he was now bleeding!

Mo Fan slowly clenched his hand into a fist, applying more pressure to the wound so more blood would come out.

A few drops of dark blood fell to the ground from the gap of his fist.

The soil was supposed to absorb the blood quickly, but instead quickly spread across the ground, like ink poured into a clear pond. The blood dyed the whole place red in an instant!

“Blood Pact of the Earth!”

Mo Fan tightened his fist. The blood-red ground began to shake vigorously and crack apart like mud.

When Mo Fan lifted his gaze and looked at Fu Ying, a bulky figure suddenly emerged from the blood-red soil!

A red rock demon steaming with heat rose from the ground. Its lower body remained buried, leaving its upper body exposed. However, its upper body alone was as intimidating as a red mountain!

The ferocious Green-Skinned Beasts were like little puppies with green fur before the rock demon. They almost fell to the ground in sudden fear!
