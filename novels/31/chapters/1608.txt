Would that really work?

Mo Fan was astounded. He never heard of anyone using the Contract Summoning as a form of mental attack!

However, he knew if he wasted any more time, things would get seriously out of control!

The lunar-white light reappeared as Mo Fan drew a Star Pattern on his palm. He looked at Apas, who was now covered in a layer of golden dust, and slammed the imprint hard on her forehead!

Apas’ face came alive the moment he placed his palm on her forehead. She glared at Mo Fan as if she was going to eat him alive.

“You’re only making me madder!” Apas declared coldly.

Mo Fan did not respond. He was focusing on inserting the imprint into Apas’ soul.

Mo Fan found Apas horrifying, but he had no other choice. He had to help the Queen of the Netherworld secure victory!

When Mo Fan entered Apas’ Spiritual World, he was surprised to see that Apas’ soul was nowhere near as scary as he thought.

When Mo Fan first tried to apply the imprint on Apas’ soul, it was like a petty human trying to tie a rope around the body of a huge dragon. He had zero chance of subduing the beast!

However, Apas’ soul had weakened significantly after the intense fight with the Queen of the Netherworld. She was alert and anxious, like a little snake. Mo Fan no longer felt such a suffocating pressure from her.

“I won’t go easy on you then!” Mo Fan immediately tied the rope around her!

Most demon creatures were reluctant to submit to a human, but if the Summoner was strong enough to overwhelm the creature and make it afraid, it was possible to establish the Contract forcibly. The creature’s soul would be permanently tied up by the Contract, forcing it to submit to the Summoner’s will.

Mo Fan did not like the idea of forcing someone else to submit to him. He believed a Contract should be signed on the basis of a mutual agreement, like what he did with Little Flame Belle. He had raised her since she was young. It was lovely...

Unfortunately, the situation did not give Mo Fan any chance to slowly reform this Medusa of unknown lineage with love. Mo Fan turned into a criminal as he forcibly tied Apas up!

There was no way Apas would allow Mo Fan to wrap the rope of slavery around her noble soul, and she resisted angrily. Even though she was still fending off the Queen of the Netherworld, her soul was still strong. She broke free from Mo Fan’s rope in an instant!

“Stop wasting your time!” Apas snapped.

How could the little imprint possibly overwhelm her soul? It was like she had just been felt up by a pervert who blatantly showed his private parts to her!

“It’s fine, I still have plenty of energy ,” Mo Fan smiled.

“Take down this little b**ch!” the Queen of the Netherworld burst out laughing.

“I’m going to tear you apart first so you can never be reincarnated!” Apas was enraged. Her calm Spiritual World was suddenly filled with wild and violent storms!

The Queen of the Netherworld’s power was still impressive, even though she was currently in Apas’ Spiritual World. Mo Fan saw a serene blue tsunami rising from the edge of the darkness.

Mo Fan knew the two women were about to fiercely clash with one another again. He quickly left the Spiritual World and waited until the psychic attacks faded away before making another move!

After half a minute, he could sense the attacks dispersing. He immediately drew another Star Pattern of the Contract Seal and slammed it on Apas’ forehead while she was trying to recover her energy.

The seal went right into Apas’ soul. She was obviously in a vulnerable state, but she still had to waste her energy on dealing with the enslaving spell!

The Contract Seal was quite an annoying spell. If the target did not resist it in time, it would keep going until the Contract was established! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It’s not going to happen!” Apas’ soul trembled in anger. She immediately shattered Mo Fan’s dream of enslaving her.

“Everyone has their first time. You will find it difficult to get used to it at first, but you’ll soon adapt to it once I enter your body a few times!” Mo Fan did not forget to provoke Apas verbally. He was acting boldly, knowing that the Queen of the Netherworld was looking after him.

“Your big sister is going to attack again. Can you hold your ground still, little girl?” The Queen of the Netherworld adroitly went along with Mo Fan’s remark. She even laughed sleazily, which greatly annoyed Apas.

The Queen of the Netherworld had managed to secure the upper hand in the fight. A greater storm surged into Apas’ Spiritual World while she was distracted, and rammed into Apas. Her soul swayed as she struggled to hold her ground from the impact!

“Damn it!” Apas had not expected such a powerful phantom to be hiding inside Mo Fan, and to make things worse, she had allowed the phantom to sneak into her own body. Her soul was seriously injured by the attacks, putting her in a very unfavorable position!

“Little b**ch, didn’t you say you were going to crush me? Let’s see who’s getting crushed in the end!” the Queen of the Netherworld harrumphed coldly. Apas’ soul trembled once more.

Mo Fan realized his Contract Seal had managed to distract Apas. Thank the Heavens the Queen of the Netherworld was able to suppress the beautiful snake lady in the end. He could feel his limbs turning cold when he recalled how he had lost himself in the stare of her dusty gold eyes.

“You cannot kill me. There’s no way you can kill me!” Apas screeched. Her face became slightly transparent. The blue veins under it were now visible.

“Is that so? You’ve truly underestimated me, considering that I’ve been around for over a thousand years!” The Queen of the Netherworld proceeded with her final attack. Her tone had changed completely now. It was no longer alluring, but held great power.

Perhaps this was the real Queen of the Netherworld. Even though she was only a phantom, she would not allow anyone to challenge her authority!

Her overwhelming power surged into Apas’ Spiritual World. Nine silver waterfalls poured down fiercely and drowned the area, the fierce waves striking Apas’ soul. If the Spiritual World was a direct reflection of her soul, it was clearly collapsing, like a world facing its own destruction!

“No... no... you can’t kill me... no... you will never kill me...I’m Medusa’s descendant, a petty phantom like you can never...never...” Apas sounded like a ghastly demon!

“You asked for it yourself!” The Queen of the Netherworld’s voice weakened slightly. She was severely drained after using that last attack. However, she had still won the fight with it. The soul claiming to be Medusa’s descendant was the one losing!

Apas had managed to disguise herself as an innocent little girl, but she never expected to be defeated at the hands of Mo Fan and the Queen of the Netherworld!

—

Apas’ Spiritual World was severely damaged, her soul was in bad shape. The Queen of the Netherworld did not show any mercy. She knew Apas could easily turn the tables around if she lowered her guard. She would then devour both her and Mo Fan; it was either her or them!

Mo Fan noticed the golden dust around Apas fading away. She suddenly looked like a seriously ill young girl with a pitiful face.

It was the law of the wild. The most beautiful creatures in the world were usually the deadliest. Apas was a typical snake woman. She looked no different than a normal human, but anyone that dared to touch her would find themselves eternally damned!

Mo Fan felt his heart wrenching, staring at Apas.

It was obvious that the military had fed little girls to the Medusae for temporary peace in return. Perhaps there had indeed been a little girl called Apas on an island in the Aegean Sea. She was just as gorgeous, but he had failed to save her in time. She had died long before he arrived at the Sunset Shrine. The young Medusa had eaten her to claim her youthful looks...

The faces that Apas had displayed must have belonged to the young girl, too. However, it was the vicious and cunning Medusa living inside her image, something that Mo Fan would not show any pity to!

Mo Fan closed his eyes. He did not want to see Apas dispersing like scattering ashes. He really hoped it was just a dream. He hoped that the little girl he rescued at the Sunset Shrine was just an innocent little girl that would keep calling him big brother. He missed the pure innocent smile that the little girl had, despite the tough situations she had been through. He had been willing to teach her magic, even if she was not that good at it.

Mo Fan suddenly felt a sharp pain in his heart!

He took a deep breath as he immediately broke out in a cold sweat. His face was extremely pale.

What had just happened? It felt like his soul had just been attacked. Was it a deathbed struggle from Apas? Did the Queen of the Netherworld fail to suppress her?

Mo Fan almost fell to the ground when he felt the pain again.

He grabbed his chest and quickly inspected his Spiritual World. He was dumbfounded when he saw his soul being torn by a force!

“Wait! Queen of the Netherworld, stop it!” Mo Fan yelled.

“Mo Fan, are you out of your mind? If I don’t kill her now, we are both going to die! She won’t spare our lives!” the Queen of the Netherworld said.

“If you crush her soul, I’ll die too!” Mo Fan said.

“What are you talking about?” the Queen of the Netherworld said impatiently.

Mo Fan was too weak to speak. He used all his remaining might and yelled, “Damn it, she...she accepted the Contract! It has bound our souls together!”
