Chapter 2916: Graft Innate Talent

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Well done! Thank you for your effort throughout the journey,” said the Ice Emperor. His voice echoed in the empty hall.

Wei Guang forced a smile.

Mu Ningxue thought Wei Guang would mention others who had sacrificed themselves in this journey, but he didn’t.Those who had died in the journey and were buried under the snow were forgotten. Their corpses would never leave the accursed demonic land.

In the eyes of the Forbidden Mages, people were born to serve them because of their high and mighty position. People’s lives were only considered worthy as long as they fulfilled their missions, but their names were not even worth a mention.

“You may take a seat there,” said the Ice Emperor to Wei Guang.

Even though the seats were simple, the arrangement had its special meaning. There were no other seats over the other side. It was only after Wei Guang went over to that side that he realized it. He felt embarrassed, still, he stood at the corner. He found that his position was worse than the Holy Rulers.

Mu Ningxue saw his humility.

For a moment, Mu Ningxue had mistakenly thought that the cold land had stripped Wei Guang of his soul. Truth was, he always behaved like that before the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance. This had nothing to do with his mental state.

“Mu Ningxue, do you possess a special physique of Natural Soul Seed?” asked the Ice Emperor.

Mu Ningxue stared at the old man and nodded.

Mu Rong was not a supporter. If the seats were arranged in a sequence according to their level of status and strength, the Ice Emperor belonged to the bottom of the list.

There were two rows of seats. The seats floated in midair along the two sides of ice clay walls. It resembled the VIP seats in an opera. The stone door stretched to the innermost ice rock wall.

Mu Ningxue stood opposite to the three seats floating in midair. She saw a familiar face in the person sitting in the center. That person had left a deep impression.

He was Archangel Michael from the Holy City.

He was the one who had forced Qin Yu’Er and Zhan Kong to leave the world. He looked stoic and majestic.

And he was the presiding officer this time!

The Forbidden Mages from the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance sat on both sides of the three high seats. They were the members of the alliance.

The Ice Emperor sat on the left and at a distance from Michael.

The arrangement of the seats basically determined his status among the world’s experts.

If it had not been for the fact that he was the only survivor from the team who explored the extreme south, he would not have been given such a high priority to speak.

“We need you to do us a favor. It’s related to…” Mu Rong tried to explain the details to Mu Ningxue.

At that moment, a lady in lavish clothes in one of the three presiding seats interrupted Mu Rong. She turned to Mu Rong, completely ignoring Mu Ningxue. “Just tell her how to do it. You don’t have to let her know why she needs to do it.”

The lady was draped in a lavish emerald-green robe. She was skinny with prominent facial features. She looked like a noble woman in an oil painting. Although she came from a noble and wealthy background, she looked picky and hard to please.

The Ice Emperor nodded. “Mu Ningxue, as you’re aware, the reason the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance recruited you is related to the world’s safety and security. We can’t simply reveal the information to you. All you need to know is that you’re contributing to the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance and the world,” said the Ice Emperor.

Mu Ningxue did not respond to him. In fact, she did not bother listening to his nonsense.

“Are you sure she has the physique of Natural Soul Seed?” asked the lady in emerald-green dress.

“Of course. You can see how she survives in the icy cold land when it spares no one.” The Ice Emperor chuckled.

“Okay. Michael, you’ll continue the discussion with fellow Mages. Meanwhile, I’ll take Mu Ningxue to the Ice Cave,” said the lady in emerald-green dress.

Archangel Michael nodded.

…

After Mu Ningxue left, someone in the hall raised a question.

“She’s a Forbidden Mage from Asian Magic Association,” the person said to Michael. “Archangel, what will happen to Mu Ningxue if she takes away her innate talent by using this means?”

“Chairman of Asia, are you aware of the issue we are facing now? We need Lady Karolina’s power. She’s the only one who can get us through the Avalanche River safe and sound,” said Michael coolly.

“But we still have to seek Mu Ningxue’s approval,” said the Chairman of Asia.

“Lady Karolina has taken her to the Ice Cave. Shewill naturally seek her approval. Let’s stop wasting so much time on this issue,” said Michael.

The Ice Cave was about thirty kilometers from the Extreme South Castle. Mu Ningxue did not understand why she was being led there. She remained on guard.

The Ice Emperor, Wei Guang, Yvette, and Lady Karolina accompanied her.

Lady Karolina had a special status. She seemed to be the key woman in the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance’s plan of fighting the Extreme South Emperor. Judging from her aura, Mu Ningxue sensed that she, too, was an Ice Element Mage.

When they entered the Ice Cave, it was almost a brand-new world. The cave was deep and long. It was covered with crystals. The crystals and diamond shimmered. It looked like a nest for a dragon that had a love for beauty.

“I have a right to know,” Mu Ningxue blurted out.

“I can explain to you now. We need your innate talent, which is the special physique of your Ice Element Soul Seed,” said Mu Rong.

Lady Karolina walked ahead of them and remained quiet.

“If this is all you’re telling me, I believe it’s time for me to go back,” said Mu Ningxue impatiently.

“No hurry. It’s only a simple matter. You came from the Mu family, right? Truth is, there’s a genius from the Mu family who once delved into various strange abilities. One of which is the ability to graft innate talents onto others. Lady Karolina is the key woman in our mission to fight the Extreme South Emperor. However, the moment the cold strikes her, she cannot cast her divine spell. Lady Karolina needs to “borrow” your innate talent,” said Mu Rong.

Wei Guang and Yvette followed behind them. They were stunned by this. ‘Can they actually “borrow” and “return” one’s innate talent?’

“Do you think I’m a three-year-old?” said Mu Ningxue coldly.

Mu Rong frowned. He looked solemn. Lady Karolina paused mid-stride. Still, she did not turn around. It was clear that she planned to leave the issue for Mu Rong to deal with.

“What do you mean? Do you think I’m lying to you? I’m an Ice Element Forbidden Mage. I’m a member of the International Forbidden Curse Association as well as a core member of the alliance…” The Ice Emperor sounded harsh.

“You intend to strip me of my innate talent. That’s not “borrowing”.” Mu Ningxue had had enough of their lies.

Mu Ningxue had been very close with Mu Qingluan and Mu Feifeng. However, their innate talents were suddenly found on Mu Fangzhou!

As soon as Mu Rong mentioned the strange ability about talent grafting, Mu Ningxue recalled Mu Fangzhou’s evil magic!

So, they were birds of the same feather!
