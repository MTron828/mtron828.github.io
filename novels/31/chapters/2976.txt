Chapter 2977: The Four Souls of Evil

“Any last words?” said Mo Fan to Kaede Takahashi.

Kaede Takahashi remained motionless. He smiled.

Mo Fan didn’t seem shocked despite discovering the Red Demon’s true form. Lingling sensed a bad omen when she saw Kaede Takahashi’s strange facial expression.

Even though they had found the Red Demon, she felt there was something strange about the Twin Guardian Towers. Had she overlooked something else?

“My last words are none other than my question I asked you moments ago. How do you judge things that are beautiful and ugly? How do you judge something to be good or evil in this world?” asked Kaede Takahashi, calmly.

Mo Fan and Lingling had found the right person. Kaede Takahashi was the Red Demon Kazuaki.

The moment he sacrificed himself, he was no longer the same Kaede Takahashi that they had met. He became the new host for the Red Demon Kazuaki. It possessed the body of the young man who had sacrificed his achievements for righteousness.

The Red Demon Kazuaki had not killed Kaede Takahashi. Instead, it saved him. Triggering the forbidden system could have reduced him to ashes. However, the Red Demon Kazuaki saved him and took over his life.

It was not surprised with Mo Fan either. It was ready to face him.

“You’re right. I judge based on my own values,” Mo Fan answered.

“If your values are distorted, everything you do is no different from committing a crime, just like the prisoners inside the East Guardian Towers. You’ll develop their level of perversion! Since you possess great power, few people in this world will dare to rise against you. If so, how do you judge yourself?” Kaede Takahashi interrogated Mo Fan.

“This is interesting. The head of the demon of a generation is interrogating someone’s soul.” Mo Fan could not stop himself from laughing.

“Can we stop with the nonsense now?” Mo Fan drew closer to Kaede Takahashi.

But Kaede Takahashi had no intention to fight him. “You respect violence, but I don’t,” he said.

“How should I put this? I asked you for your last words. I didn’t ask for you to prattle on endlessly!” Mo Fan put an end to his pointless discussion with Kaede Takahashi. Mo Fan blazed with firestone and lightning.

Bam!

Mo Fan struck without hesitation. Lightning danced, as if a group of savage lions were shredding their prey apart.

Kaede Takahashi did not dodge Mo Fan’s attack. He let the lightning strike him. Soon, Kaede Takahashi was covered in blood. He turned black.

Before the Red Demon completed its ascension, it did not possess an emperor-level power. Hence, Mo Fan’s Lightning Element magic was fatal to it.

However, the Red Demon did not avoid Mo Fan. It let him attack without any qualms.

The Red Demon was not immune to the Lightning Element magic and yet, it did not even dodge him.

Kaede Takahashi was injured. He was in agony, but he endured the pain.

Mo Fan was puzzled upon seeing the Red Demon not defending itself or fighting back.

Finding the Red Demon’s real form prior to its ascension was regarded as a success for Mo Fan and Lingling. They were shocked to see, though, that it did not retaliate.

“As I mentioned earlier, I don’t like violence.” The Red Demon Kazuaki grinned. It stumbled slightly, but it forced itself to stand upright. “Even if you destroy me, I won’t fight back.”

“Then you’ve already lost,” said Mo Fan.

“Of course, I’ve lost. Have you forgotten how I was born?” said the Red Demon Kazuaki.

“You were born from a mass of corrupted and evil energy before becoming a demon,” said Mo Fan disdainfully.

“You’re right. Most people find my birth to be disgusting. I don’t think I’m qualified to become the Wicked God,” said the Red Demon Kazuaki.

“Then why don’t you destroy yourself?” Mo Fan struck again.

This time, he cast Heaven Fire. This flame was powerful enough to reduce the Supreme Rulers such as the Eight-headed Serpent to ashes. Mo Fan did not believe that a demon hated violence. It would struggle and retaliate to avoid death. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Heaven Fire covered the Red Demon Kazuaki in an instant. It stood in the middle of the fire and allowed the flames to engulf it.

Even so, it did not fight back. It was in agony, but it did not cast any evil energy to fight back.

“W-What are you doing?!” Sinchino Mocizuki screamed.

“It’s not Kaede Takahashi,” Lingling answered indifferently.

“It’s not up to you to decide if he’s Kaede Takahashi or not. As his best friend, I’m the one who is in the best position to confirm his identity. He’s Kaede Takahashi. You’re trying to murder him!” Sinchino Mochizuki charged to stop them.

“Sinchino, she’s not lying. I’m not Kaede Takahashi…” The Red Demon Kazuaki gradually revealed its true form in the middle of the blazing flames.

It was a mound of liquid that was silvery black. A human form was created out of the liquid. Although it had no face, it had a pair of gooey eyes. Its eyes contained a wisp of red substance. Its soul appeared to be represented by the red substance.

Screams rang in the temple.

A monster that resembled a demon that had been imprisoned in the depths of their nightmares materialized in the middle of the flames, frightening the young people. It appeared disgusting and awful.

A moment ago, the monster was a living being. It was Kaede Takahashi. However, the flames seemed to have melted its skin and revealed its true form.

It was not Kaede Takahashi! It was a demon with crimson red eyes!

“I’m the Red Demon.” The Red Demon confirmed its identity in the middle of the blazing flames. It was as evil as hell!

Sinchino Mochizuki was dumbfounded. The truth was laid bare before his eyes. He could not doubt it. Kaede Takahashi was possessed by a demon!

“It’s time to end this today!” Mo Fan sucked in a deep breath. He glanced at Lingling.

Lingling’s breath was caught in her throat as he fixed her gaze at the Red Demon. It was the main culprit!

“It’s time to end this today. Most of the great demons tend to say it’s either your doomsday, or my doomsday. However, I won’t say that. I must perish today, because it’s my fate,” the Red Demon laughed madly in the middle of the flames.

It kept changing its voice. Sometimes it sounded like a male, and other times, like a female. It could be the Eight Souls’ voices.

“Show me what you’ve got!” Mo Fan sneered. He knew the demon would not allow itself to be destroyed without fighting back.

“Show you what I’ve got, huh? Don’t blink!” The Red Demon raised its hands high.

A red moon appeared in the pitch-black sky. Even though it was an eclipse, the moon appeared above the Sacrificial Mountain suddenly. The moon looked like an evil eye filled with blood veins, looking down at the tiny, pathetic world!

“It’s my destiny. The tribute is my grave, but the Red Demon will never disappear from this world. Mo Fan, you can’t kill the true Red Demon!” The Red Demon Kazuaki laughed. It looked as though it was already victorious.

“I’ll reduce you to ashes now!” said Mo Fan.

“I don’t need your help. I’ll do it on my own. The true master that rules the world is born today. I’m a slave and have served you for a long time.” The Red Demon Kazuaki stepped out of the flames.

It was liquid in human form. But every stride it took altered the way it looked. It changed into Eight Souls—Four Souls of Goodness and Four Souls of Evil.

Mo Fan knew the Four Souls of Goodness. They were Kazuaki, the Cold Hunting King, Yuna, and the Red Bird.

But he had never seen the …

Mo Fan was shocked when he recognized the faces of the Four Souls of Evil!
