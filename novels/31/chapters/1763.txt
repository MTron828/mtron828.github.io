Lin Qihui was confused when he saw Mo Fan jumping down from above them.

“Oh my, what is that?” Liang Junheng exclaimed, pointing at the cracks on the ground.

“Is there anything? Why can’t I see it?” Cao Juan looked behind him and failed to notice anything.

“Look out, it’s under your feet!” Liang Junheng yelled.

Cao Juan lowered her eyes and saw a pile of mud wriggling under her feet now. Cao Juan did not take it too seriously at first, but her face turned extremely pale when the strange mud revealed a pair of eyes.

The mud was obviously going after her! She was not able to escape in time. The strange mud suddenly leapt into the air and turned into a flexible and sticky mud man!

The mud man pounced at Cao Juan and covered her. She did not even have time to use her magic.

“Save her!” Lin Qihui said.

“How are we supposed to do that? Are we going to attack her?” Liang Junheng cried out.

The mud man was completely attached to Cao Juan. If they tried to attack it with their magic, they might kill Cao Juan too!

“Help...help...me!” Cao Juan struggled vigorously, but the mud soon entered her throat.

The mud had taken over in no time. Cao Juan was nowhere to be seen. She had been replaced by a mud monster!

The mud monster’s size expanded quickly after covering Cao Juan. It was impossible to tell where the mud had come from. The group did not dare use their magic as they were scared of harming Cao Juan. They had no choice but to watch the mud man grow stronger!

“AHHHHH!”

Another cry of agony came from behind while the group was starting to panic.

Lin Qihui turned around and noticed another student being attacked by the same mud monster now!

His situation was exactly the same as Cao Juan’s. The mud soon covered him entirely. His struggles were in vain, as he was eventually covered by the mud.

A furious roar was heard coming from the opposite direction. When Lin Qihui looked at where Cao Juan had been standing, he realized that the mud man who had devoured Cao Juan had transformed into a familiar creature! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“A Rock Monster!” Lin Qihui exclaimed.

“What...what exactly is going on?”

The Rock Monster’s eyes were filled with anger. It charged straight at the group while swinging its arms fiercely, knocking a few of the students into the air.

“Run to higher ground, quick!” Lin Qihui yelled.

The students were not very strong, and did not stand a chance against the surprise attack. They quickly fled to a higher spot.

Another Rock Monster began charging at them just as they created some distance between them and the first one. It had come from the direction of the male student who had been taken by the mud.

The two Rock Monsters chased the students relentlessly. A few of them were injured and covered in blood.

“Help me, anyone, my leg is broken!”

A young man had fallen into a crack and twisted his knee. His face was covered in sweat from the pain.

Luckily, the Rock Monsters were chasing after the rest of the group instead of targeting him. Otherwise, it was unlikely he would survive under the circumstances!

“Watch where you are going, keep an eye out for the mud monsters,” Lin Qihui quickly warned the others when he realized something.

“Don’t just keep running. Use your magic too! Do you really think you can outrun those Rock Monsters?” Liang Junheng said anxiously.

Liang Junheng was leading the others to fight the Rock Monsters. The group finally had some space to cast their spells under the protection of his Earth Magic. They cast their Intermediate Earth Spells simultaneously, stacking up a huge wall in front of the Rock Monsters.

“What should we do with Su Jindu?” Someone finally realized they had left one of their members behind.

The two Rock Monsters decided to go for the man named Su Jindu after they had trouble going after the group of students.

Su Jindu was terrified. He tried hobbling along on his other leg, and managed to hide behind a slope. To his surprise, the two Rock Monsters landed right in front of him after jumping around a few times, just like huge apes.

“Help me!” Su Jindu screamed for help from Mo Fan, who had finally come down from the mountain.

Mo Fan frowned, and immediately used his magic. Rock Fangs emerged from the ground and stabbed the Rock Monsters in the feet.

Luckily, Mo Fan’s Bright Rock was a lot harder than ordinary Earth Magic, or it would not have posed a threat to the Rock Monsters. The Rock Fangs emerging from the ground would have broken into pieces right away trying to stab the Rock monsters!

Mo Fan managed to stop one of the Rock Monsters with the Rock Fangs, but he could not do anything to the other Rock Monster. The four-meter-tall creature lifted Su Jindu up like he was a little chick.

Su Jindu was still struggling fiercely, but the Rock Monster simply smacked him into its chest.

The Rock Monster’s strength was outstanding. Mo Fan had experienced it first hand. Even if the force did not turn Su Jindu into mincemeat, it was still enough to kill an Intermediate Mage brutally. It was impossible for Su Jindu to survive it.

To Mo Fan’s surprise, Su Jindu was not smashed into pulp like he expected. The Rock Monster’s chest turned as soft as mud when it pressed Su Jindu into its chest. It looked like Su Jindu was being eaten by the mud. The Rock Monster slowly forced the man into its chest.

Mo Fan watched it all with a blank face.

What the heck was that thing? Did it just force a man into its body?

Is that how the Rock Monsters feed on humans?

He never heard of any Elemental creatures feeding on human flesh!

The Rock Monster that ate Su Jindu suddenly let out a roar. Its body was transforming at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was growing in size now.

The Rock Monster had grown from four meters to six meters in just a few seconds. Its rocky muscles were full of power. Mo Fan’s eyes widened once again.

The mud monster at the beginning had transformed into a Rock Monster after devouring the girl named Cao Juan, and now, the Rock Monster had grown further after absorbing another person!
