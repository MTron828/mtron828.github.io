Chapter 2356: Bearer of the Ice Brush, the Painter

Sharjah stared at her book.

The page that contained the Magic Sword Tyrfing was now in bad condition.

Sharjah suddenly took a few steps back as a dark light flashed. She held her chest like she was being punished by some kind of Contract she was under.

She began to breathe heavily. Half a minute later, she spat out a mouthful of blood onto the book as she failed to restrain the feedback from her power. Black steam was rising from her blood.

Mo Fan noticed Sharjah was injured.

It seemed like the book was bound to Sharjah’s spirit. If the demon being Summoned by the book was damaged, she would be injured as a result.

Even though Mo Fan felt sorry for Sharjah when he saw her biting her lips to endure the pain, he knew he did not have a choice. He had to defeat Sharjah and kill everyone blocking his path!

“Sharjah, stop using the dangerous magic. You should take a rest and catch your breath. I’ll deal with him!” White Leopard was sincerely concerned about Sharjah.

White Leopard moved forward and set his feet on Mo Fan’s hills. He immediately felt uncomfortable.

The Earth Element was very effective against the Ice Element. This time, Mo Fan had the advantage over White Leopard. He was struggling to gather his Ice Magic while he was surrounded by such a strong presence of Earth Magic, especially since the rocks were unusually hot, with scorching lava occasionally bursting out of them. It was the perfect combination of Mo Fan’s Fire and Earth Elements!

“Fire and Earth…” White Leopard realized the young man had more Elements than he was supposed to.

“My Ice Element has always dominated everything!” White Leopard shouted. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Despite the lack of Ice Energy, Ice Leopard managed to summon a wave of frost across the scorching black ridges. The frost was able to spread by defying the laws of nature with the absence of snowflakes.

The ice spread rapidly across the scorching dry rocks. It did not lower the temperature of the surroundings or the ground. It looked just like a street painter was casually splashing a new color onto their drawing!

It was Mo Fan’s first time encountering an Ice Magic with no sense of ‘pain’. It was completely different from Mu Ningxue’s Ice Magic, which had a strong urge to freeze everything in its path. Mo Fan might even think White Leopard was merely shouting to put on airs if half of the ridges protecting him had not turned blue-white.

A powerful Mage, whose Ice Element had reached the third tier of the Super Level!

Mo Fan could not afford to lower his guard. He had learned his lesson when he was almost trapped inside the Ice Mage’s crystal cubes.

Mo Fan had also learned something new. In the past when he fought against a human Mage, the outcome of the battle solely depended on whose magic was able to overwhelm the other, because their magic was merely following a set of principles. They might have their own special abilities, but their magic still adhered to the standard rules.

However, the battles he had fought recently were completely different. Every Mage’s magic was specifically tailored for themselves after certain factors like Domains, control, additional effects, and Super Powers were involved. Certain abilities could even decide the outcome of a battle, regardless of their strength!

Mo Fan did not feel cold even when everything around him had turned white like snow.

It felt strange to him. The calmer everything was, the uneasier he felt.

“He’s a painter. He draws with his Ice Magic,” Sharjah said. Her advice was just enough for Mo Fan to realize what was going on.

White Leopard turned around angrily.

What kind of teammate was she? How could she reveal the secret of his Super Power to their enemy?

“The Musician, the Preacher, and the Painter. I thought the Federation Army had sent one of their strong Mages who was extremely familiar with us to invade our base, yet you came all the way here without knowing anything about us!” Damon scoffed.

Damon was standing under the ridge Mo Fan was atop. He and his disciples had surrounded Mo Fan.

The Brown Rebels used to be a political party prior to the establishment of the Federation. Mo Fan was not interested in the country’s politics, so he was totally unaware of the three renowned specialists among the Brown Rebels.

The first was the Musician, Cook. He had obviously died an unjust death, perishing instantly to Mo Fan’s patiently accumulated Lightning Magic, mainly because he was not used to fighting his enemy directly.

If he was still alive, Mo Fan could only have used his Lightning and Shadow Elements.

Sharjah was the second specialist, known as the Preacher.

She used the sinister book as a medium to Summon ancient demons to fight for her. She had no idea how many ancient demons the book contained in total, as she could only turn half of its pages and read a limited number of the Curses within it.

The third specialist was White Leopard, known as the Painter. He was able to draw with his Ice Magic and render everything white.

Mo Fan only noticed a tiny brush between White Leopard’s fingers after Sharjah warned him.

White Leopard’s other hand was holding paint board made of ice with white ink on it!

A goose-feather brush in his left hand, and a white paint board in his right!

Taking a closer look, Mo Fan realized the guy did not look like a destructive Mage about to attack his enemy, but a painter who was ready to draw instead.

What about his drawing board? What was he going to draw on it?

The Musician had his choir.

Sharjah had her sinister book.

How was White Leopard going to materialize his magic?

White Leopard tapped the brush on the paint board and drew a huge stroke in the air while Mo Fan was still having doubts. The stroke left a thick line with a thin and sharp tip!

Mo Fan would assume the guy was just being a clown, but he realized the guy’s Ice Magic was able to work this way because of the same trick as he abruptly recalled the Seals that had trapped him like a caged beast!

The ice being drawn did not have any iciness, but it was brimming with murderous intent.

White Leopard had drawn an ice spear with a single stroke. It was thirty meters long. Not only did it appear out of nowhere in front of Mo Fan, it was flying at him at a shocking speed, too!

Rocks rose under Mo Fan’s feet before he even reacted. They quickly formed a wall and blocked the ice spear!

“Ice Bola!” White Leopard drew a new outline.

The ice spear was obviously just to probe Mo Fan’s defenses. Ice Leopard decided not to attack with force when he saw even the Magic Sword Tyrfing was unable to threaten Mo Fan’s throne.

The Ice Bola’s purpose was to suppress Mo Fan. White Leopard’s strength was restricting and controlling his enemy.

He drew a huge ice bola chained to Mo Fan’s feet to bind him to the ground.

The Earth Vein only reacted to magic that would threaten Mo Fan’s life. It did not react as quickly to the ice bola.

Most importantly, White Leopard was not unleashing any energy as he was drawing. There was no presence of Ice Magic around Mo fan, but he was able to draw the ice bola and tie it to Mo Fan’s feet with layers of chains to prevent him from breaking free!
