“A bunch of idiots, you’re all a bunch of idiots. At this rate, you can’t even win against developing countries from South-East Asia and Africa, let alone the strong countries like Russia, USA, and England! Did the whole team collapse just because Lu Yilin left? Do you seriously want other countries to think that the stamp that was supposed to be a challenge to them is actually just a simple attendance check!” a hoarse voice echoed in the National Training Hall, leaving awkward expressions on the faces of the students who had come to visit.

Meanwhile, the nine students of the National Training Hall looked utterly depressed. Their instructor Bai Dongwei had the worst temper, condemning them right in front of the students from other institutes.

Attendance check... it was true that many countries had successfully acquired the challenge stamp from them, but it was not like they were performing bad!

Besides, Lu Yilin’s departure from the team did place them in a little crisis. Due to their mistakes in the duels lately, they ended up not receiving as many resources as they had hoped. Meanwhile, every national team was improving rapidly, including their country’s national team. Everyone had already reached the Advanced Level. How could defenders like them, who were only Intermediate Magicians possibly win against the second wave of national teams?

“Instructor Bai, can you please ask the higher-ups to allocate the resources to us first? We are seriously going to be smashed by the national teams if we don’t improve,” said Dongfang Lie.

“Humph, do you think I’m not asking for more resources? Look at your results lately! How the heck did you even lose that bad against Thailand! I’m telling you, the team from Egypt is already here. If you lose again, I’m afraid you can’t even stay on the team any longer, let alone get more resources. I wouldn’t be this angry if you only lost because your cultivation is weaker, but you still lost when your opponent was also in the Intermediate Level!” scolded Bai Dongwei.

Dongfang Lie did not dare to speak again.

He was left with no choice, either. If he managed to win the preliminaries, things would be totally different for him. His Dongfang Clan would surely give him three Galaxy Veins to help him break through to the Advanced Level. Unfortunately, they only gave him one Galaxy Vein in the end, and he ended up failing the attempt. He was sent here to be a defender instead! When would his tough days come to an end?

“Excuse me...Instructor Bai, the team from Egypt is here,” Jun Ge walked up and awkwardly interrupted Bai Dongwei’s scolding.

“They are here? That quick? Where are they? You with the tanned face, please move aside, I don’t see them anywhere!” Bai Dongwei looked around for a while, yet he did not see the team from Egypt.

Jun Ge pointed at the tanned face Sayed and said softly, “He’s the one. They only sent a person here, apparently he said that one person is enough to challenge China’s National Training Hall.”

Jun Ge was speaking in Chinese. Bai Dongwei’s face immediately flushed with rage after hearing the words. He could feel the urge to scream at the top of his lungs.

“Is he seriously here on his own?” Bai Dongwei held his breath and confirmed it again.

“He’s the only one, he said that the team has other important business,” whispered Jun Ge.

“How dare they!” Bai Dongwei groaned. He almost lost control of himself and strangled the man to death!

What did they mean by a single person was enough to challenge China’s National Training Hall?

Every student he Bai Dongwei taught was incredibly brilliant. How dare the representatives from Egypt treated themselves as phoenixes visiting a chicken coop?

“Dongfang Lie!” Bai Dongwei was so furious that he almost stomped the ground. He completely forgot about treating their guests with courtesy and called for Dongfang Lie.

“I’m here,” Dongfang Lie was confused. He had no idea what his instructor wanted from him.

“Beat the crap out of him, if he can walk again in just a week, I swear I’ll let you rest in a sickbed for the entire month!” Bai Dongwei was almost screaming.

Dongfang Lie was stunned. -How is that even reasonable? Besides, why is the instructor so mad? Did this handsome foreigner kidnap his wife?

-That doesn’t make any sense. Bai Dongwei’s wife is as tough as he is. There’s no way the guy could kidnap her...-

Dongfang Lie walked up to the dueling ground in bewilderment. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Are we starting now? That’s a bit surprising, but I do like straightforward people,” Sayed smiled. He kept showing his confident dimples.

“Egyptian scum, you shouldn’t be so full of yourself!” cursed Bai Dongwei, glaring at Sayed’s back.

He was extremely furious. Recently, the team had lost a duel that they were not supposed to lose after Lu Yilin left the team. To their surprise, someone actually thought they were just a bunch of sick cats. If he did not cripple the man and feed him to the dead pigs in Huangpu River, he would be unfaithful to the bright red flag with five stars!

“Come here all of you, someone is here to challenge us. Your duels are like a quarrel between women,” Bai Dongwei cleared his throat and summoned everyone who was training elsewhere.

The students from different institutes were having friendly duels with one another. They immediately gathered after hearing the call, even though they were utterly confused and clueless about what was happening.

Dongfang Lie and Sayed were already on the stage. They had chatted briefly with one another.

Dongfang Lie never had a great temper, either. He almost spat out fire when he heard the man was representing the Egypt team and had come alone to challenge them.

Do they seriously think the challenge stamp was as simple as an attendance check? If the man seriously thought he could acquire the stamp by himself, Dongfang Lie would not mind stamping the man’s face with his fists first. Where the heck did he get his confidence from?

“Hey, Dongfang Lie, what’s happening?” asked a student under the stage.

“This black face is from Egypt’s national team. He has come alone to challenge us,” replied Dongfang Lie.

“F**k me, does he really think he is Chen Zhen, to challenge us by himself!” cursed the person too. { TL Note: Chen Zhen is the character in the movie Fist of Fury.}

The student soon spread the words among the crowd. Without any surprise, the students immediately glared at the foreigner. They all had the urge to replace Dongfang Lie and beat the crap out of the Egyptian!

Anyone from their country would be mad. They would not say anything if it was a reputable country doing it, but who said the team from Egypt could disrespect them like that?

“Dongfang Lie, show him what you got!”

“That’s right, you can only teach a person like him to be humble with your fists!”

Dongfang Lie was serious when he heard the students encouraging him. Despite the circumstances, every duel in the National Training Hall would directly influence his future and the glory of his country. He could not afford to let down his guard.

“Wait!” Sayed called out all of a sudden.

“It’s too late to be scared now, humph!” spat Dongfang Lie.

“I’m not scared. Your number will only waste my time... I just want to know what the conditions are before I can get the stamp? Every place has its own rules for the challenge. Since I’m here on my own... mmm, I don’t mind taking all of you at once, but I will only allow it on a few conditions. However, if it’s a one-on-one duel, or you’re taking turns to fight me, you should tell me how many people I have to defeat in order to earn the stamp,” Sayed said in English.
