The dust drifted into the air by the blasts swept at Mo Fan’s face.

Asha’ruiya’s heart skipped a beat after hearing Mo Fan’s words!

Until his heart stopped beating...

No one could really oppose the world, but it was enough as long as they were not left with any regrets!

Asha’ruiya slowly placed her hand on Mo Fan’s chest. She could feel the man’s heart pounding heavily. Many people were living like walking corpses, but the man before her was vivid and blazing like fire!

A blue light circled Asha’ruiya’s hand as energy kept pouring into Mo Fan’s body. Mo Fan could feel the energy in his Star Galaxies replenishing rapidly.

It was not only replenishing his energy. His wounds were recovering too, including his broken organs and bones. Mo Fan had no idea what magic Asha’ruiya was using, but he clearly felt himself recovering at an insane rate.

—

He fully recovered in just a short period of time. On the other hand, Asha’ruiya’s face was extremely pale, but she was still as gorgeous as usual.

“Hopefully the hidden power in your body is a lot stronger than I’ve imagined, as you are going to take on armed forces that can conquer half of the world!” Asha’ruiya had a faint smile, as if she was bidding him farewell.

The color of Mo Fan’s eyes shifted. An abnormal dark red filled his pupils. They were so dark that they could reflect the entire chaotic sky.

The demon blood that he had been withholding for a long time turned restless. They were like demons that had just been released from cages. They could not wait to descend upon the mundane world and unleash their wrath across the sacred mountain!

The Essence Orb was also emitting a brilliant and eerie light that soared into the clouds like a sword. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan had saved up the energy for a long time. He had promised Old Bao that he would not use the Demon Element until he had filled up the Essence Orb. However, even if the orb was not filled up, he had no intention of suppressing the power of the Demon Element anymore!

The Black Vatican was detestable; he wanted nothing more than to send them all to Hell with everything he had, as they were not worthy to live in this world.

However, he was totally disappointed after learning the ridiculous lie that the Parthenon Temple and the Holy Judgment Court had woven for their own greed. Humanity was constantly threatened by the demon creatures that ruled the world, but the leaders of the human race turned out to be unreliable, too!

Left with no choice, Mo Fan could only use violence to curb violence. Since they were willing to shed the blood of the innocent lives to acquire more power, Mo Fan was more than willing to shed their blood, too!

—

An enormous, white shadow stood firmly behind Mo Fan. It was a Demon Wolf Supreme that had been awakened from the deepest abyss in the Underworld. The wolf stared down at the sacred mountain. The savage light its eyes were emitting could easily tear these weaklings into pieces!

Mo Fan’s hair had turned white, the color that symbolized death. His long hair was like a coat of sharp spines on his back, and his body was covered in the runes that echoed with the enormous shadow of the Demon Wolf Supreme behind him. His enlarged muscles looked oddly terrifying!

{TL Note: White symbolizes death in certain countries, particularly Asian countries. White represents death, mourning, and bad luck, hence people normally wear white clothes during funerals.}

Asha’ruiya was so shocked that she could not find any words after seeing Mo Fan’s transformation.

Even though Mo Fan still retained his face, the strange runes had turned him into a demon from the Underworld. She felt extremely tiny before his icy aura. She believed that even if she was used the power of the Dark Contract, she would not stand a chance against Mo Fan at all!

The Black Totem Snake was already quite intimidating, yet Mo Fan’s presence was actually even more intimidating than it was!

The Black Totem Snake let out a cry. He had detected a bunch of Adjudicators casting powerful spells on a mountain not far away. The destructive aura spread through the woods and destroyed them!

Mo Fan lowered his gaze to the Black Totem Snake...

Fresh blood was flowing down his enormous body. His skin was dyed red too!

“Leave the rest to me,” Mo Fan gently petted the Black Totem Snake’s head.

He had done a lot; it was time for the Parthenon Temple and the Holy Judgment Court to experience how it felt when they were up against a real demon!

—

Mo Fan launched himself into the air from the Black Totem Snake’s head. He was not able to fly, but he easily leapt over the tall hill in front of him and landed on the mountain among the Adjudicators like a meteorite.

The Adjudicators were drawing a huge Star Constellation. Sixty Mages were working together to cast a Plant Spell, and once it was done, it would prevent the Black Totem Snake from moving.

The Plant Element was very effective against larger targets. The battle would be over once their Plant Spell was completed.

“Who...who’s there!?” the middle-aged man leading the Adjudicators snapped furiously. He turned around and saw a ghastly figure with an overwhelming aura standing there. It felt like he could easily devour the mountain with a single breath!

The demonized Mo Fan did not answer the question. He merely uttered coldly, “Blood Shadow Strike!”

The giant wolf shadow behind Mo Fan sprang forward. It split into countless wolf shadows sprinting wildly across the mountain!

Tearing, biting, trampling, it was like a horde of demon wolves conquered the mountain in the blink of an eye. The Adjudicators died horrible deaths, their bodies torn apart and eaten, their limbs were scattered across the place. It was a massacre!

Their blood was flowing down the mountain like streams.

Shawshank, who was commanding the battle up in the air, opened his eyes in disbelief as he watched his men die!

They were the elites among the Adjudicators, yet they were all wiped out in an instant... what exactly was the figure that was moving so fast? How did it possess such terrifying power!?

“Hall...Hall Master, the entire seventh squad has been wiped out!”

“Impossible!”

“Did anyone see what the thing was?”

“It jumped out from the Black Totem Snake. It’s too quick, it’s killing us like it is harvesting wheat!”

Shawshank was enraged. The Adjudicators played an important role in the armed forces of the Parthenon Temple. The Black Totem Snake had already killed many of them, but even more had died now. It was totally unacceptable!

“The Black Totem Snake is in its final struggle. Isn’t it normal for blood to be shed every time a new Goddess is being elected? How can we grow stronger without sacrifices?” Dulanc was not too bothered by the loss.

It was only a bunch of Adjudicators. Once they had the Spell of Resurrection, even Forbidden Mages would be willing to submit to them. Why would they care about the death of some Adjudicators?

Besides, the Adjudicators had sworn loyalty to Izisha. It was their honor to die for the sake of the Parthenon Temple!

Shawshank glanced at the woods now covered in blood and demanded, “Did you not see a human figure?”

“I didn’t, I’ll place you and Vice Hall Master Lanjin in charge, I suppose you know how to deal with Haylon,” Dulanc said.

They were finally at the most important part of their plan; claiming the Soul of the Parthenon Temple! Dulanc had to focus on the Dark Execution. He wanted to see Ye Xinxia being dragged into the Realm of the Dead just like Wen Tai and witness the Soul of the Parthenon Temple being granted to Izisha. These candidates or Saintesses were incomparable to Izisha!

Dulanc left and headed for the Dark Execution Ground.

Shawshank and Mellaura stayed to deal with the Black Totem Snake. Shawshank was still concerned about the thing that was massacring their men in the woods. It did not seem like a power of the Black Totem Snake...

“Mellaura, use your magic to find that guy...” Shawshank said.

“Mm... ugh...”

“Mellaura...” Shawshank turned to his back when he heard Mellaura stammering.

However, a great chill immediately ran down his spine as he took a quick glance!

A bloody hand had penetrated Mellaura’s back and come out her chest. The hand was holding her beating heart. Her eyes were wide in surprise, as she slowly turned and followed Shawshank’s gaze!

Behind Mellaura was a man shrouded by a demonic shadow with an evil, cold grin on his face. His bloody-red eyes had a strong aura of death, and did not look human at all!

“It’s...it’s him!” Shawshank was dumbfounded. He recognized the man’s face. He was none other than the young Mage that was trying to rescue Xinxia, Mo Fan!

However, his appearance had changed completely. He had transformed into a cold-blooded demon with a strong desire to kill.

“Great...Great Muse!”

“Mellaura!”

“You devil, let go of her!”

Five Golden Sun Knights were on standby close to Mellaura.

As the Great Muse, Mellaura’s Healing Magic and Blessing Elements were outstanding. Even though she was not a capable fighter, with her help, a Super Mage could easily take on three Super Mages of their level at the same time!

However, no one expected a demon to appear out of nowhere and drive his hand right through Mellaura’s back. None of the Golden Sun Knights had reacted in time. Even Mellaura herself could not use any of her magic equipment!

After all, no one expected they would die with so many protectors around them...
