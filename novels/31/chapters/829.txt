The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast lifted its leg once again. It was emitting the same eerie red glow.

The creature swiped its leg at remarkable speed. It was impossible to deduce the direction of the projectile by looking at its movement...

“Mu Ningxue!” Mo Fan yelled upon having a bad feeling.

Mu Ningxue had realized it too, and let out a soft groan. Walls of ice immediately rose between her and the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast! The spectacular stands of ice stood in front of Mu Ningxue in layered barriers.

However, as the creature’s Void Slash swept past, the ice walls were sliced in half in the middle.

The first ice wall had just cracked into pieces when the second one was sliced open, followed by the third. Mu Ningxue could only stare at the deadly slash in astonishment. She simply had no chance to react in time!

If a pedestrian was walking on the street and saw a truck coming right at them all of a sudden, most people would feel their mind going blank, as if their subconscious was telling them that it was meaningless to try and dodge!

Mu Ningxue was experiencing the same feeling now. The speed and strength of the creature’s attack were just too shocking. It sliced through the three layers of ice walls with ease. A strong gust of wind swept at her defenseless body...

A brief moment later, Mu Ningxue saw the red slash disappear after it sliced through half of the third ice wall. Her heart totally skipped a beat!

The slash had almost pierced through the third ice wall. She would be completely defenseless if it had kept going. She would have been beheaded by the creature’s attack without a doubt!

“This...this...” Hirose was speechless from shock. The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was a lot scarier than he had imagined!

“Mo Fan, run!” shouted Mu Ningxue decisively, knowing that they simply stood no chance against the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast.

Mo Fan did not force it either. He immediately retreated to Mu Ningxue’s side.

Luckily, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was only able to use the Void Slash two times in a short period of time. If it was able to fire another slash, someone among them would surely have died!

“We...we’re stuck here, the Fierce Shark Demons are everywhere!” Hirose glanced at his surroundings with a wry smile.

In the beginning, the Fierce Shark Demons were stuck outside of Mu Ningxue’s Domain. However, while they were busy attacking the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast, the Fierce Shark Demons had moved closer and surrounded them.

“This son of a bitch’s scales are too strong, we can’t defeat it!” cursed Mo Fan.

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was significantly stronger than the Scarlet Rending Demon. Mo Fan had basically used all he had, yet the creature was still unharmed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Mu Ningxue nodded. She was thinking of a way to escape when she suddenly recalled Ai Jiangtu mentioning the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s weakness. “It has a weakness!” she blurted out.

“You should have mentioned it earlier! Where is it?... I initially thought its back was its blind spot considering its size, yet to my surprise, it can twist its legs in the opposite direction!” exclaimed Mo Fan.

“On its head, there are no scales covering there!” answered Mu Ningxue.

Hirose was dumbfounded. Were they for real? Were they seriously thinking of killing the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast instead of running away under the circumstances?...

“I see, I’ve sealed its arms, that should last for quite a while still. Its legs can twist and reach its back, but I doubt they can reach its head. It looks like we still have a chance, but the Fierce Shark Demons are coming...” said Mo Fan.

“If you really want to do it, I can ask my comrades to hold the Fierce Shark Demons off. They are nearby, but they are too scared to engage the Commander-level creature,” offered Hirose.

“Splendid, I’ll leave the underlings to you!”

Since escaping was not an option, they had no choice but to fight!

Mu Ningxue continued to freeze the water and used a strong icy wind to keep the Fierce Shark Demons at bay.

The ice spread rapidly, forming across the place to serve as barricades against the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast, to hinder its movement temporarily...

“Meow!” The crisp cry came from a tall building. Mu Ningxue quickly turned around and saw the little Night Rakshasa standing on a half-destroyed balcony. Its pitch-black eyes had an intelligent glitter to them!

“Feifei!” Mu Ningxue was overjoyed. She did not expect Jiang Yu’s Contracted Beast to return at such crucial timing.

“Meow!” the Night Rakshasa responded with a cry, telling Mu Ningxue that she had slain the White Sobbing Demon.

The Night Rakshasa did not follow Mu Ningxue’s words of returning to the team with the antidote after killing the White Sobbing Demon. The little creature was concerned about Mu Ningxue’s safety, since her master had emphasized keeping Mu Ningxue safe.

“What is that?” Mo Fan saw the Night Rakshasa too.

“She’s Jiang Yu’s Contracted Beast, she’s good!” said Mu Ningxue.

“Good at acting cute?”

“Meow!” The Night Rakshasa jumped down from the building, yet she did not leave a scratch on the ice as she landed nimbly.

“I guess it’s easier with the help of a Contracted Beast. Little black cat, go and get the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s attention. Make sure it exposes its weakness on its head, so I can land my attack on it,” said Mo Fan.

The Night Rakshasa shook her head and pointed her paws at herself, before pointing at the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s head.

Mo Fan’s face turned dark. He had never seen a Contracted Beast ordering Magicians around instead. She was not cute at all, unlike his little Flame Belle!

“Mo Fan, she’s more agile than you, let her handle the attack! You get the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s attention!” said Mu Ningxue.

The Night Rakshasa was indeed a strong creature. Even when fighting the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast face-on, the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was not necessarily able to defeat the Night Rakshasa due to her outstanding agility.

On second thought, the Night Rakshasa must be an expert at giving her target a deadly blow sneakily. Her fighting style was more suitable to hit the creature’s weakness compared to Mo Fan’s violent combination of the Fire and Lightning Elements.

“Fine, you better not run up to its head and end up giving the creature a little scratch,” Mo Fan did not have high hopes for the little black cat.

“Little Flame Belle, possess!”

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was coming in his way. The only way to face it head-on was by having the father and daughter in sync!

Little Flame Belle was fully prepared too. Her porcelain doll figure rammed into Mo Fan’s chest and immediately set him on fire. The brown Calamity Fire spread into his surroundings explosively...

The fiery aura happened to be contradicting with Mu Ningxue’s Ice Domain, yet when Mo Fan tried to unleash the maximum potential of the flames, he somehow felt that his fire was not weakened by Mu Ningxue’s frost and the water vapor in the air. The flames were burning stronger than ever instead!
