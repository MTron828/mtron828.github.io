The rain lasted for one whole day. Professor Tong Zhouzheng gave them three days to split up and collect local information.

The truth was, Lingling obtained useful clues from a couple of outstanding hunters from the first day she joined the team. After she excluded the unimportant factors, she could confirm the location of the Pharaoh’s Source and the possible signs surrounding it.

As a freshman, Lingling planned to give them only the information about the Golden Cold Rain Rose.

“Everyone, well done! We can start now. Many hunters are already on their way. We can’t do anything about that. After all, we’re not familiar with Egypt.” Professor Tong Zhouzheng pushed back the rim of his glasses on his nose after reading their reports.

“Sir, Lingling and I agree that the Golden Cold Rain Rose is the key. Shall we start with this?” Jiang Bingming said excitedly.

‘While the other seniors could not find any intuitive clues, I found an important plant! That is called talent!’

Jiang Bingming snickered. He noticed that Professor Tong Zhouzheng was impressed with his proposition.

“Chen He, go to Hanta Sand City and buy the Golden Cold Rain Rose. When you purchase it, be sure to ask the herb dealer about the geographical location of each Golden Cold Rain Rose,” said Tong Zhouzheng. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Noted, Professor.”

“I’ll go with you.” Jiang Bingming’s eyes lit up. He was acknowledged by the professor! “Lingling, come with me.”

“No, thanks. I don’t like to travel. I’ll just wait for the result here,” said Lingling with a smile, showing her dimples.

“Okay, wait for our update. If we find any clues, you will be credited for it, too,” said Jiang Bingming.

“Lingling, since you came here to grow your knowledge, you shouldn’t complain about it. You should travel around with your seniors to learn more. If you’ve been brought up in a well-off family and school, it’s about time to change your attitude,” said Guan Yao as she approached Lingling.

“Never mind. The two of us can take the trip down to Hanta Sand City. Lingling has been working hard on the distribution of the desert plants for nights before finding this important clue. She hasn’t been resting well.” Jiang Bingming spoke up for Lingling.

“Lingling, I didn’t know that you’ve been working so hard.” Chen He fist-bumped Lingling.

Lingling could not help but laugh. Chen He surely looked tough, but he was always so adorable.

Lingling wondered what was wrong with Guan Yao. Guan Yao sometimes acted shy, but there was always some prejudice in the way she talked to Lingling.

Lingling looked at Guan Yao’s silhouette. She was confused. She shook her head and did not pay much attention to it.

“Professor Tong Zhouzheng, since the Golden Cold Rain Rose is a clear sense of direction for us, why don’t we go to Hanta Sand City together? It will be much better than waiting for the result over here. Most of the hunter teams have departed. We’re the only ones left in Orange Sand City,” asked Yuan Jun. He was an Earth Element graduate.

“I found a more reliable clue. We can only try our luck with the Golden Cold Rain Rose. After all, the Egyptian hunters and other hunters, who often traveled to Africa and the Sahara, certainly knew about the information that we obtained. They could have gone ahead of us,” Tong Zhouzheng said patiently.

“Oh… so that’s how it is. That’s why you asked Chen He and Jiang Bingming to try their luck over there,” said Yuan Jun.

Tong Zhouzheng nodded.

If not for the tournament and the high number of competitors, the clue, that Jiang Bingming and Leng Lingling found, would have been reliable. However, as experienced hunters, they had to consider various possible factors.

“Professor, where are we heading next?” asked Guan Yao softly.

“We will go to the land of Baige. We’re going to the Evil Temple on the Sunset Slope,” said Tong Zhouzheng.

“Evil Temple?” The crowd was shocked.

The Evil Temple was the female demons’ lair. The temple was not a place of gathering for small demons. It was a palace for the more powerful female demons. The mages who had been there were skinned alive.

“We’ll look around it. We won’t enter the Evil Temple,” said Tong Zhouzheng.

“It’s still dangerous!” If Yuan Jun had known that they would be heading to the Evil Temple, he would have followed Jiang Bingming and his group to Hanta Sand City.

“Get ready. Guan Yao, please check if we have a sufficient supply of medicine. If there’s no issue with it, we will depart tomorrow. I’ve hired a guide to ensure our safety,” said Tong Zhouzheng.

The rest looked bitter.

The female demons inside the Evil Temple were extremely brutal.

Weren’t they supposed to look for the Pharaoh’s Source? What did it have to do with the Evil Temple?!

Early the next morning, the crowd gathered in front of the city. Jiang Bingming and Chen He rushed back overnight. Both looked exhausted.

“Professor! Professor! We were late. Someone bought all the Golden Cold Rain Rose and used the rain pattern on the leaves to find the Pharaoh’s Source. We asked for the person’s identity, but all information has been erased.” Jiang Bingming sighed. “We didn’t expect someone to steal the fruit of our hard work.”

“It’s okay. We’re planning to go to the Evil Temple. You two came back just in time.” Tong Zhouzheng was not surprised by the outcome.

“Huh?! We barely even had time to rest…”

“Let’s go now!”

They were about to set out when Lingling’s phone rang. It was an unnamed number. Lingling was puzzled.

She answered the call.

Lingling heard a mature, female voice. The stranger’s voice sounded dignified. However, the person spoke seductively.

“Dear respected Hunter Master, I’m Anna, do you still remember me? We spent a short time together when you were in Egypt looking for Medusa’s Teardrop.”

Lingling snorted. Another seductress who used to flirt with MO Fan.

“I am sorry, but I’m his partner, Leng Lingling,” replied Lingling.

“Huh? I’m sorry. I’m the hunter girl. I saw a hunter whom I once worked with appear at the jurisdictional service level, and the hunter website automatically popped out the relevant information. Hence, I took the initiative to contact you. May I ask what kind of help you need? After all, I’ve lived in Egypt for more than twenty years.”

Lingling roughly understood the situation after hearing Anna’s explanation.

Anna was the same hunter girl whom MO Fan had contacted for help when he was looking for Medusa’s Teardrop. She seemed to have helped him find a lot of key information.

Lingling checked Anna’s background and found that she was a high-level professional hunter. She was qualified to serve the Senior Hunters.

She was also good at using eagles as messengers. Even if the hunters were in a place without any signal, they could still receive first-hand information because of the eagles.

Lingling was short of a team member like her.

“We’re heading to the Sacred Hall of Sunset. Are you available to travel now?” asked Lingling.

“Yes. As for my safety and reward…”

“I’m participating in the Hunter Tournament. As for your safety, can’t you trust a Seven-Star Hunter Master?” refuted Lingling.

“Oh, it’s the Hunter Tournament already?!” Anna’s tone got noticeably sharper. It was clear that she was willing to help. “Send me your location. I will arrive shortly..”
