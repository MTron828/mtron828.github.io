The rain had lasted for a few days straight. The people in the clock tower were already silent, overwhelmed by the sorrow of finding the group in the Space of Death, and now yet another devastating news had come...

“Half of the army is dead, only a few from the three Hunter squads are alive, the Imperial Magicians are trapped by the Mountain Zombie there...” an Imperial Magician came reporting.

“Sigh, so many are dead, but we still picked the Bridge of Death,” Ling Xi shook her head when she heard the news.

“We should have just fought with all we had, maybe we can still survive until the morning arrived. We still don’t know if the Dark Abyss is going to shift into the inner city. Maybe the Black Vatican is just trying to trick us. Now that we’ve lost so many people, we won’t have a chance to defend the inner city,” said Chu Jia.

“Don’t you think it’s meaningless to say something like that now? We’re only in this situation because we’ve underestimated the Black Vatican. You should say that if the Magic Association, Hunter Union, and all renowned clans had worked together to eliminate the Black Vatican, a disaster like this wouldn’t even happen! I don’t think the Black Vatican is fooling us; the Dark Abyss is going to drift into the city. We already know that the imperial tomb is under the Dark Abyss. It’s the fortunate among all unfortunates. I can already feel death closing in,” responded Du Xiao, who seemed to have a grudge against Chu Jia.

Chu Jia did not feel pleasant upon hearing the words. As he was about to respond, Du Xiao was already not in the mood to quarrel with him further.

He walked to the edge and summoned a pair of wings. The wings had an obvious tear on them. It was obvious that he had been injured before.

“What are you doing?” asked Chu Jia immediately.

“I’m well-rested. I’ll go and save more people,” Du Xiao beat his wings and leapt into the air.

He was extremely quick. The rain nearby was swept away as the wings beat. Not long after, Du Xiao had already vanished into the distance.

The Space of Death...

The silver vortex finally disappeared. No more undead were falling from the sky. However, the broad area was now crowded with lots of ugly creatures. Su Xiaoluo and Liu Ru both had extremely pale faces!

They had witnessed the enormous undead army up close, and even cleared a spectacular path to reach the Dark Abyss. However, they were escorted by an army of powerful Magicians, and now, there were only four of them in the space. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Four, just four...

Zhang Xiaohou was an Intermediate Magician, Mo Fan had just leveled up to the Advanced Level, but he still could not cast Advanced Spells as he had yet to learn how to construct a Star Constellation. The breakthrough had only granted him a greater supply of energy. There was no way they could handle so many undead!

“Brother Fan,” Zhang Xiaohou’s forehead was covered in sweat.

The number of undead had exceeded his imagination. It was a lot more than the number of undead he had encountered at Xianchi. The two thousand undead could easily combine into a great tide and devour the four of them.

“Swift Star Wolf, Little Flame Belle, come out here.” Mo Fan immediately drew the Star Orbits and Star Pattern of the Summoning Element.

Him summoning the two creatures instantly implied that he was in a grim situation. He had to try his very best!

The Swift Star Wolf soon appeared beside Mo Fan. His hair was drifting in the wind from the phantom gusts and undead breath. White fangs poked out from the wolf’s lips, almost reaching his lower jaw!

“Protect them,” Mo Fan told the Swift Star Wolf.

Liu Ru was fine on her own. Her close combat strength was a lot higher than the Swift Star Wolf, but Su Xiaoluo desperately needed protection. She was a Poison Magician, and her cultivation was not too high, either. She had spent most of her time on herbs and refining potions.

When Zhang Xiaohou saw that Mo Fan was not talking nonsense anymore, he knew his friend was being utterly serious.

The number of undead was too overwhelming. If anything, the only fortune they had was the fact that Mo Fan had just progressed into an Advanced Fire Magician.

“Little Flame Belle, stay close to Zhang Xiaohou,” said Mo Fan to the little Flame Belle floating beside him.

“Brother Fan, I...”

“Do as I say,” said Mo Fan in a deep voice.

Zhang Xiaohou opened his mouth, but he did not say a word.

“They are here!” Liu Ru lowered her voice too.

The space was not huge. The undead soon caught the smell of living humans. They let out ghastly starving cries and their stiff movements suddenly turned into sprinting, like refugees running toward food!

The zombies were the greediest, running at the front of the pack. The sturdy ground began to crack under their heavy steps!

Mo Fan took a deep breath. His right fist was already burning with a blazing red flame. The fang-shaped flame swayed slightly in the wind.

He stood there waiting for the zombies to enter the range of his Fiery Fist.

“This is the Space of Death, are we going to die here?...” Su Xiaoluo almost bit her lips. She blurted out cowardly.

Space of Death, they were in the Space of Death. There were so many undead, and only the four of them.

They were going to die. The people in the city were going to die, too. They still could not escape their fate. Everyone would die before dawn, their blood splashed across the ground would be that maniac Salan’s red carpet.

“The living path isn’t cleared by walking on it, but killing!” Mo Fan did not turn his head, directing the words at Su Xiaoluo, who had the urge to give up.

“Fiery Fist!!”

The light of the fire flickered. Mo Fan launched the flame on his fist with a blast. Nine fiery dragons flew across the gray land and rammed into the pack of zombies running at the front while wriggling their fiery bodies.

Around sixty zombies were running at the front of the pack, the fastest among the zombies.

The zombies agilely leapt aside when the fiery dragons lunged at them, dodging Mo Fan’s Fiery Fist.

However, the fiery dragons were not just dumbly flying forward. The flames emitted from their bodies were extremely hot. The little sparks alone were enough to set the zombies aflame once they made contact with their bodies!

The strength of the Fiery Fist: Nine Dragons was overwhelming, not to mention its wide coverage. The sixty agile zombies were completely devoured by the flames with no chance of escaping, burned into black ash and blown into the air!

Mo Fan stepped forward and drew the next Star Pattern...

The army of Magicians had cleared a path to the Dark Abyss in the ocean of undead. This time, it was his turn to clear a living path in this Space of Death!
