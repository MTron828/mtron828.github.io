3030 The Holy Soul

“Cut throat!” Norman wielded the Blade of Hiromi. He turned into a turbulent wave, like a flying sail breaking through the ocean.

Norman cut the Ancient God Apollo’s throat. His God Hunting Will was a life-threatening weapon to the emperor-level Tyrant Titan. The Ancient God Apollo cradled its neck with one of its hands. Still, its golden blood gushed out and covered its palm, then flowed down along its arm.

Three Knights of the Seal appeared behind the Ancient God Apollo’s head. They gathered one hundred of the Golden Sun Knights’ Seal of Bright Charm and formed the Wheel of Destruction, then crashed the Ancient God Apollo with it.

The Ancient God Apollo’s head was severely wounded. Moreover, its throat was fatally injured. For a moment, it could not stand still.

It staggered like a sun without sunlight. It fell in the middle of Aigaleo Mountain. Its golden blood spilled. It was as terrifying as if a massive furnace the size of a mountain had shattered. The raging black-striped flames spread and burned the mountains outside the city.

The sky was illuminated brightly. The blazing fire illuminated Athens. Even a giant that was as enormous as the Tyrant Titan could be defeated. The arrogant and unbeatable God of Sun fell into the mountains.

This was all because of the birth of the Goddess. She brought in a rain of light and infinite divine light. She also granted the knights with God Hunting Will!

Cheers rang throughout Athens. Not only did Athenians rejoice for being freed from the fear of the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, but Greece also finally emerged from the darkness and ushered a bright future.

They could defeat the emperor-level Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, so they had no need to fear the giant colony that would wreak havoc on Greece.

…

“My lady, the Twin Tyrant Titans are escaping to the north mountains. The Mountain Giants colony do not dare cross the Aigaleo Mountain!” said Hua Lisi in excitement.

The Mountain Giants in the west had brought Hua Lisi tremendous pressure. Athens was a very large city. If the Tyrant Titans barged into the city, they would cause great damage to Athenians.

Ye Xinxia’s analysis was correct.

The Tyrant Titans did not appear as brave as they expected. After the Ancient God Apollo fell, they cowered and dared not take another step into the city area.

Apparently, the Twin Tyrant Titans were aware that the Hall of Knights was no longer the same as before. The situation was unfavorable to them, so the Tyrant Titans fled.

“They want to escape, so let them be. Athenians need your presence to placate them. End the war as soon as possible,” said Hua Lisi.

“Our enemy’s blood is the best thing to placate our people.” Ye Xinxia had no intention of ending the war. She rested her gaze on one of the Knights of the Seal.

The Knight of the Seal was none other than the God of War, Ares.

“Ares, I grant you the Holy Soul of War, and I order you to cross Aigaleo Mountain and kill the Mountain Giants colony.” Ye Xinxia gave her orders. At that moment, her Divine Soul was no longer attached or coiled behind her. Instead, they both fused together perfectly.

Ye Xinxia was the Divine Soul, and the Divine Soul was her. Her aura was different from before. She no longer looked as gentle and soft-spoken as she used to. If she was clad in heavy armor, she would have looked like the Goddess of War, a high and mighty, unplaceable Goddess with absolute power!

The battle would not end just like that. In fact, it had just begun. She refused to end the battle hastily. If she showed her mercy to her enemy, it would only lead to greater danger to her people in the future.

Ye Xinxia did not just want to kill the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan, but she also wanted to eliminate all other giants outside Athens. She would not spare the culprit who provoked the war!

The Holy Soul of War represented the God of War Ares. In the past, the Knights of the Seal surpassed the Golden Sun Knights in terms of their magic. However, they were just at the level of a Semi-Forbidden Curse. They were still no match for the Forbidden Mages or emperor-level creatures.

The awakening of the Holy Soul made a huge difference. The Knights of the Seal granted with the Holy Soul would be called the true Holy War Knights!

After Ares was granted with the Holy Soul, he became a changed man. He became even more powerful than a Forbidden Mage!

Only the true Goddess could grant one a Holy Soul.

There were a total of twelve Holy Souls. Ares was the first Knight of the Seal granted with the Holy Soul. Ares’ eyes were filled with enthusiasm. He fell to his knees before Ye Xinxia. He even retreated a few steps back for fear of touching the Goddess’ train of the white dress.

The descendent of the Holy Soul was the will of war. When Ares stood up, his eyes looked fiery. He was covered with luxurious Holy Garments. The energy surging in his body increased by multiple times compared to before. He was no longer in the same realm.

Ares sensed the Holy Soul’s power. He felt as if he possessed the same level of life as the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan.

“I’ll wipe out the Mountain Giants colony.” Ares gained unprecedented power and was filled with fighting spirit.

Ares was the leader. He led seventy Golden Sun Knights, eight hundred Silver Moon Knights, and four thousand Blue Star Knights, and departed together. They refused to just passively defend the city. They wanted to cross the mountain and kill all the giants that threatened the Athenians!

Hundreds of Mountain Giants colonies hid in several countries. They had been assimilated by demons. Under the Mad Poppies and the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan’s encouragement, the Mountain Giants decided to make a comeback. They had to pay the price in blood!

“Norman, Haylon, I grant you Hestia Holy Soul and Poseidon Holy Soul, respectively. I order you to behead the Twin Tyrant Titans and use them as an offering as repayment for the innocents who died in this disaster.”

Ye Xinxia summoned two Holy Souls with even more powerful fighting spirits.

The Knights of the Seal, Fighting Magistrates, and the Lord of Hall of Knights were qualified to possess a Holy Soul. Ever since they joined the Hall of Knights, they had been working on their magic cultivation and physical training in preparation for receiving the Holy Soul and Holy Garments.

Without the Goddess, they could never obtain the Holy Soul and Holy Garments.

“My lady, I don’t need the Holy Soul. Please grant it to Hua Lisi. She has been loyal to you. The strife is chaotic. I hope you can have someone who can face the situation independently with you to ensure your safety,” said the Lord of the Hall of Knights, Haylon, earnestly as he bowed and knelt before the goddess.

Haylon did not need a Holy Soul. He had already dabbled in the realm of Forbidden Curse. Although the Holy Soul could increase his strength by leaps and bounds, Ye Xinxia found that his suggestion was wiser.

Once Norman, Haylon, and the other Knights of the Seal were assigned to kill the giants, she did not have many bodyguards left to protect her.

The Holy Soul descended. Norman and Hua Lisi obtained the Holy Soul of Water and the Holy Soul of Fire respectively. Norman was a Water Element Mage. After he combined his magic with his Holy Soul, he broke through his Semi-Forbidden Curse realm.

Norman was touched. He had thought he could become the Forbidden Mage by himself. He did not expect the Holy Soul and Holy Garments helped achieve his dream.

Of course, Norman was aware that the Holy Soul would only increase his current state. It was not his original ability. Once the Goddess withdrew their Holy Souls, they would go back to normal.

Haylon and Norman were the leaders. Three Knights of the Seal and one hundred and thirty Golden Sun Knights followed them. Together with one thousand and one hundred Silver Moon Knights, they formed a hunting team. The Twin Tyrant Titans were the culprits of the disaster, they could not escape from Parthenon Temple’s judgment by taking advantage of the chaotic situation!

The knights rose to hunt down the Tyrant Titans after suffering from devastation. Athens went from panic to peace, and the people were spirited again. Countless people rushed to the streets from the buildings they had hidden in and hugged one another.

There were many believers in Athens. In the past, they used to climb up the lengthy Parthenon Mountain staircase on special occasions just to receive a blessing from the Hall of Faith. Today, the rain of light healed the wounded people and comforted them. On top of that, they could witness the giants being killed!

Blood flowed like rivers outside Athens.

The giants’ blood kept flowing like a torrent. And the people cheered happily.

It was clear to see that those were the Tyrant Titans’ blood. The Tyrant Titans had plagued Greece for several thousands of years. On election day, the Tyrant Titans tried to stop them and slaughter the people. However, upon the Goddess’ order, the Tyrant Titans were beheaded.

Regardless of how many or how strong the Tyrant Titans were, there was no way they could trample Greece or simply kill the people as if they were puny, meaningless bugs anymore.

…

The people’s cheers rang throughout the city. The city once again regained its atmosphere that belonged to the Flower Festival. The continuous rain of light made Athens prosperous than ever before. The remains of the poppies were everywhere. They only added a few details to the historic city.

The people were no longer in fear. They returned to the streets. The White Finches Barrier above them remain untouched. Regardless of the change of color in the sky, the sound of mages casting a spell, or the giants’ roars, they had never felt this peaceful before.

The true serenity did not mean everything had to be perfect and flawless. Not everything or everyone had to necessarily be gentle and kind. Sometimes, a storm raged, lightning and thunder interlaced. As long as they were inside their own house, they still felt the warmth and tranquility.

“That’s truly outstanding. A Goddess like you is worthy of everyone’s praises. I’m almost tempted to kneel before you and offer my devotion.” said the Black Druggist with a grin on the election altar.

“Take him away and keep him under close guard!” Hall Mother, Pamise, had someone to gag the Black Druggist to shut him up.

Ye Xinxia returned to the election altar. She glanced at the Black Druggist who had been taken away. Then, she surveyed her surroundings.

The battle was not over.

Ye Xinxia knew in her mind that the internal and external problems of Parthenon Temple were not resolved yet.
