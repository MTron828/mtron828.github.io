Mo Fan’s words sounded ridiculous to everyone at the start, but after hearing his explanation, most people started to believe his speculation!

Ai Jiangtu in particular was convinced, as he had entered the illusion together with Mo Fan. They had both witnessed how Miyata had killed herself just to prove that she was innocent. Such a strong-willed woman would never speak such a ridiculous lie, which meant there was something fishy about the island!

“I’m thinking that maybe the night was misty, and the creature was simply too enormous, and so Miyata did not notice it was a living creature. Since she had only moved to Xixiong City quite recently, she wouldn’t think it was strange that there was an island there, so she went onto it... Although I don’t know why the creature would just sit there, but I think the only explanation as to why I saw the island was because it had reappeared in the same spot.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What exactly is it? How did it manage to sneak past into the safe zone with such ease, not to mention that it was big enough to disguise itself as an island...” Jiang Shaoxu was now utterly convinced that Mo Fan was speaking the truth.

If they had not seen the shadow in the Pacific Ocean, they would never have believed that there existed a creature huge enough to be mistaken as an island. Mo Fan’s speculation was indeed the only viable explanation for Miyata’s statement!

It was not an island, but a living creature, one that could enter human territory freely, a gigantic sea creature that was either harmless to humans, or believed that humans were simply unworthy of its attention!

“So the alarm at the Twin Guardian Towers last night went off because they detected the creature?” said Jiang Yu.

“Even though I have no clue what you all are talking about, there was indeed a gigantic creature present last night. It left soon after we detected its presence. It’s obvious that the creature did not wish to fight us,” Mochizuki Chihaya confirmed.

“But why is the creature following us? Osaka is around the middle of Japan; are you telling me that it had traveled half of Japan just to stalk us?” asked Nanyu.

None of it made any sense. If it was trying to harm them, it would have done so in the Pacific Ocean.

If it was harmless, there was simply no reason for it to be following them. If it weren’t for the tight security at the Twin Guardian Towers, it was likely that Mo Fan and his team would still be unaware that the creature was following them.

“I’m starting to feel uneasy; a creature of that level can easily swallow a river, destroy a mountain, and overturn the lakes and seas,” said Jiang Yu.

“What should we do now?” asked Jiang Shaoxu.

“We’ll proceed with caution. Maybe I was just oversensitive; it’s only a mere speculation. After all, we still haven’t seen the creature yet,” said Mo Fan.

“Mmm, it’s good enough that we are aware of its existence, it’s not like worrying about it will make any difference,” said Ai Jiangtu.

Mo Fan had made the whole group uneasy.

Luckily, they were currently inland, quite a distance away from the coast. There was no reason for them to panic now.

Not long after, the bus pulled onto a highway. They could see houses along the way, implying that they had entered a safe zone under protection.

——

The journey was rather tiring. After all, it took them some time to travel from Osaka to Tokyo by bus, even though they were taking the highway...

“I’ll bring everyone to somewhere fun when we arrive in Tokyo,” promised Jiang Shaoxu when she saw that everyone was low in spirits.

Ai Jiangtu immediately poured a bucket of cold water on her. “Jiang Shaoxu, we’ll be heading straight to the maritime battlefield after we arrive in Tokyo.”

“Why the rush? It wouldn’t matter if we are a day late,” Jiang Shaoxu wheedled in a seductive tone.

Ai Jiangtu would not fall for her tricks. He proceeded to explain to the team, “The maritime battlefield is our main destination in Japan. It’s also the place for our first training. Just to remind you, each country will hand in resources to the Magic Association, and these resources will be distributed to the national teams during their training. The resources are allocated based on our contributions during the training.”

“Even so, there’s no need to be so enthusiastic,” whined Jiang Shaoxu in a sloppy tone.

“I believe many among us are still not Advanced Magicians yet. The training here in Japan serves as a great opportunity for you to level up to the Advanced Level. If you don’t want to, feel free to enjoy yourself in Tokyo,” replied Ai Jiangtu without giving face.

“An opportunity to level up to the Advanced Level... that’s some incredible resource! What exactly would it be?” said Zhao Manyan with glittering eyes.

“Mr. Zhao, you shouldn’t be looking forward to it. Resources will never be allocated to you since you’re a substitute. Of course, that also includes Mu Ningxue and Mo Fan,” Mu Tingying said with a smile.

Zhao Manyan immediately asked Ai Jiangtu for confirmation in an unpleasant tone.

Ai Jiangtu nodded and replied, “It’s true that the resources aren’t allocated to the substitutes.”

“F**k me, that’s unfair!”

“You should be grateful that someone like you was given a chance to train with the team. You have no talent, no outstanding cultivation, no high-level Soul Seed...” mocked Guan Yu at the perfect time.

“Damn it, you’re acting like you’re already an Advanced Magician, yet you’re still an Intermediate Level scum just like me!” cursed Zhao Manyan, pointing at Guan Yu.

“There are still quite a lot of Intermediate Magicians in this team,” said Jiang Yu, coughing deliberately.

“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Zhao Manyan in an awkward tone.

There was no reason for Ai Jiangtu to lie to his teammates. Resources were not supposed to be distributed to the substitutes. The decision was already made when the national team was formed.

As a matter of fact, if Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan and Mu Ningxue underperformed during the training in Japan, they would be replaced by others with outstanding performance who were defending China’s National Training Hall.

After all, they were only substitutes for the team. Their treatment was a lot different than the official members.

It was unlikely that Mo Fan would be replaced, since he was already an Advanced Magician. Some of the official members were not even Advanced Magicians yet. On the other hand, Mu Ningxue and Zhao Manyan were in danger of being replaced.

Although Mu Ningxue’s strength was remarkable, she had yet to break through to the Advanced Level.

On top of that, she only had access to limited resources. The Mu Clan supporting her had simply stopped providing her with resources after Mu He was exposed as the Black Vatican’s Great Deacon. They had focused on developing Mu Tingying instead.

Mu Tingying was most likely extremely close to breaking through to the Advanced Level. It was only a matter of time as long as she was given enough resources.

Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue’s cultivation was stuck at the limit of the Intermediate Level. Her cultivation had not improved for some time. She was actually starting to feel worried, even though she looked calm on the surface.

With her strength, she had a chance to compete for the resources granted to the national team. Unfortunately, the substitutes were not meant to be allocated any of the resources, placing her in a difficult position.

When the trip to Japan came to an end, one of them would surely be replaced!

It was either her or Zhao Manyan!

Zhao Manyan had a wealthy financial group supporting him. They would simply use lots of money to help him break through to the Advanced Level if needed. As such, she had the highest chance of being replaced!
