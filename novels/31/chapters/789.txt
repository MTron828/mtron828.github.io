“Damn, what are they doing? Why are they still standing there when the duel is already finished? Don’t tell me they are falling for one another?” Zhao Manyan wondered aloud impatiently.

No one would purposely sense the distribution of Element particles in their surroundings in the middle of a duel. Besides, a special device was necessary to accurately determine the distribution of Element particles in an area most of the time.

“It does look that way... maybe they are already exchanging their contacts in WeChat.”

“Idiot, Japanese doesn’t use WeChat.”

“It’s fine to exchange numbers then... judging from how long they are taking, maybe they have already decided on the room number for tonight,” Li Kaifeng smiled.

He turned around and saw Nanyu staring at the men who were having lewd thoughts with an unfriendly expression. He quickly withdrew his smile and shut his mouth.

The two finally separated after some time.

By separating, it meant Mochizuki Chihaya returned to her seat. She gave her mentor, Fujikata Tegami an apologetic bow, apologizing for losing the duel.

“You did well, but you underestimated your opponent,” said Fujikata Tegami.

“Chihaya, were you giving him guidance... I can sense the Fire particles in the area behaving abnormally.” Mochizuki Ken was indeed an experienced Magician. He soon realized something was out of place.

“Yes.”

“Does that mean he...” Mochizuki Ken was stunned. He quickly fixed his eyes on Mo Fan. Someone on the Chinese team had already probed their Domain!

China really had lots of talents. A random kid who was acting like a thug had already achieved such an impressive cultivation level. He could not help but wonder if their national team would stand a chance against the Chinese team at Venice!

The representatives of the Japanese team were stronger than the students appointed as the gatekeepers of the National Training hall. However, it was difficult to tell if anyone on the team had probed their Domain.

“You shouldn’t have done that, he might become a strong opponent for us,” whispered the Japanese commander when he saw Mochizuki Chihaya returning to her seat.

They were clearly aware of the significance of a Magician that had Awakened their Domain. Someone with a Domain was always one of the best candidates in the World College Tournament.

“I’ve only done what a teacher should be doing,” replied Mochizuki Chihaya.

Up on the stage, Mo Fan finally opened his eyes. Fiery sparkles flickered behind his brown pupils, soon hidden behind his confident gaze.

It was a pity that he had failed to Awaken the Domain right away. That being said, Mo Fan knew things like this were unpredictable. At the very least, he had taken the first step that many Advanced Magicians were clueless about. He believed if he continued to fight strong opponents like today, helping him discover his hidden potential, it would only be a matter of time until he Awakened his Domain.

When that happened, he would surely master the ability! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Domains were incredible, and even though he was only under its effects for a short period of time, Mo Fan clearly remembered the feeling of being able to control the Fire Element as he wished.

It felt like his spells were no longer confined to the fixed Star Orbits, Star Patterns or Star Constellations, and he was able to cast magic purely with his mind!

“What spell did you use? How did you set yourself on fire?” Guan Yu asked when Mo Fan came off the stage.

“Do you think I’m going to tell you? I have lots of other tricks under my sleeves, so I suggest you not annoy me for your own sake,” answered Mo Fan haughtily.

“Well done, Mo Fan! You’ve made an instructor concede in a duel. That’s unbelievable!” Jiang Yu came up to Mo Fan and patted him heavily on the shoulder.

“What instructor?” Mo Fan raised his brows.

“That Japanese woman was an instructor instead of a student. You were having a duel with a teacher!” said Zhao Manyan.

“Holy crap, are you serious?” Mo Fan gaped.

“You bet I am! Otherwise, do you really think a Japanese student would be as strong as her?”

Mo Fan looked at Ai Jiangtu, who nodded slightly and told him, “That instructor is even stronger than me, and I think she was still holding back in the duel.”

“F**k me, Japan has lots of strange people indeed. That woman looks very young, how is she an instructor...” said Mo Fan.

On second thought, Mochizuki Chihaya was indeed too strong to be a student. The way she used her Advanced Spells and her control of the Basic and Intermediate Spells clearly indicated that she was on a different level. Luckily, he had been hiding some trump cards up his sleeves. Otherwise, he would surely have suffered a great loss!

Why was she helping him with the Domain?

Mo Fan soon came back to the question. It went without saying that the woman would have a grudge against him. She had no reason to help him...

However, Mo Fan had a different view of her because of that. She was indeed a great teacher if she was willing to teach someone regardless of their nationality.

Without her guidance, Mo Fan would have no clue what a Domain was. He would have missed the opportunity to take the first step in Awakening a Domain!

Speaking of Domain, Mo Fan immediately thought of Mu Ningxue and went up to her.

Mu Ningxue had a bad feeling when she saw Mo Fan sneaking up to her. Luckily, Mo Fan did have some serious questions to ask instead of his usual annoying flirting.

Mo Fan dragged Mu Ningxue into a corner and lowered his voice, “I believe you’re the only one with a Domain on this team?”

Mu Ningxue nodded. The fact that she had Awakened her Domain was not really a secret in their country.

“Let’s find a night to visit a small bar and have an intimate talk with our knees together. I think I’ve just probed a Domain during the duel,” Mo Fan blinked his eyes, as if he was having some lewd thoughts instead of discussing some serious matter.

“There’s nothing to discuss, I was born with the Domain,” replied Mu Ningxue calmly.

Despite the rejection, Mu Ningxue was surprised to learn of Mo Fan’s improvement, especially when he told her that he had probed the Domain.

How did he train himself? Even some of the old Magicians had trouble probing a Domain. They usually needed the help of Soul-grade Seeds to Awaken their Domain.

Mo Fan’s cultivation was not particularly outstanding. He only had Spirit-grade Seeds too, and considering the number of Elements he had, he would have trouble improving them all simultaneously, yet his Fire Element had achieved such a remarkable level. It just did not make any sense!

“You would still know a thing or two even if you’re born with it,” Mo Fan did not give up.

“I have nothing to teach you.”

“You surely have something.”

“You can try asking your Japanese teacher,” retorted Mu Ningxue.

“Ugh... it wasn’t anything like that,” Mo Fan’s expression was awkward.
