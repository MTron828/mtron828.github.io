Chapter 3120: Red Python Evil Dragon

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

No one dared to defy the creatures. They had no choice but to follow the Golden Female Snake Swordsmen and Silver Snake Warriors.

The giant and frightening Red Python Evil Dragon was in the dark ahead. It passed through the ruins of the sacred hall. Sometimes it meandered forward. Other times, it climbed up and down the rock wall.

The members of the Hunter Society walked forward in the dark but were surprised to find that the dilapidated Sacred Hall of Sunset had changed drastically. It was no longer just a broken stone wall buried in the sand. It had long stone steps, dark corridors, black palaces of different sizes, and dark halls without domes that towered no matter how far they went.

If it were not for the wild poisonous vines, gray reeds, broken walls, and collapsed pillars that could be seen everywhere, the place could be compared to a royal palace.

The palace was so big that it seemed endless!

However, the dark palace was far less peaceful than it looked. There were many dangerous, cruel, and violent eyes gleaming in the dark at the corners of their vision, and in the blind spots that human eyes couldn’t see.

“What did you give to that Red Python Evil Dragon? Why did it accept that as a tribute to the Evil Temple?” Tong Zhouzheng asked Lingling in a low voice.

“Burning Evil Eye. It was an evil weapon placed in the Sacred Hall of Sunset before. I obtained it from the black market by chance. I guess they want it to be returned to its owner,” Lingling replied.

‘MO Fan stole it from the Sacred Hall of Sunset.

Using it to trade for everyone’s life was not a bad deal. However, Lingling was a

little curious. What group belonged to this Red Python Evil Dragon and those Golden Female Snake Swordsmen?

The Evil Temple was much bigger than the Sacred Hall of Sunset. They walked for a long time but only saw the tip of the iceberg. A large, darker area hid outside those endless black palaces, and the maze-like black corridors led to unknown places.

Finally, some luminous pearls illuminated the surroundings.

It was an empty hall without a dome. When they looked up, they could see the endless starry sky. The stars shone brightly, but the light did not reach where they walked. They could only rely on the luminous pearl scattered on the ground like skulls.

The Red Python Evil Dragon was in the main hall. It curled its body and surrounded a bloody diamond throne. The bloody diamond throne was as big as a bed, and a beautiful woman was lying on it. She was only covered with an expensive velvet blanket. Her shoulders and long fair legs were exposed. She seemed a little lazy but charming and noble.

“Take the others away and serve them some food and wine. I want to chat with the person who brought the tribute in private,” the woman on the throne said to the Golden Female Snake Swordsmen.

The Golden Female Snake Swordsmen obeyed the order and led all the members of the society, including Tong Zhouzheng, to a corner.

Tong Zhouzheng was about to resist, but the Red Python Evil Dragon suddenly opened its terrifying vertical eyes.

“Professor, don’t worry about me. The owner of the Evil Temple is not necessarily barbaric,” said Lingling.

Tong Zhouzheng knew that he was powerless. He was forced to give up after thinking about the lives of so many students.

It was a fact that Evil Temple did not necessarily kill people. Many people who had been to the Evil Temple survived but didn’t end up well. The Evil Temple was good at cursing people.

“Where did you find it?” the lazy queen asked Lingling. Her voice was crisp. She spoke the human language.

“Stop acting coquettish. Don’t you know that your master is trapped in the pyramid?” Lingling said curtly.

“My female attendants like to eat little girls with sharp tongues. I’m not lying.” The woman on the throne laughed charmingly.

The lazy woman donned a long silk dress and got up from the throne. The swaying waist was so slender that she looked like a snake.

Lingling ignored her.

The woman on the throne stepped on the Red Python Evil Dragon and walked down. She walked around Lingling and looked at her carefully.

“You’ve changed a lot. You’re no longer a little girl. You look pretty now. I never thought that an ordinary girl could become this pretty,” said the woman.

“You make me sick.” Lingling could not stand her trying to act all seductive. The woman in front of her was Apas. And she knew what kind of demon Apas was.

After returning to the Evil Temple, she seemed to have regained some of the things she had lost. Many snake demons supported her and fought against her elder sister, Trishina.

She remained under contract with MO Fan, regardless of whether she was the exiled Medusa girl or the current Medusa Queen.

“Why did you bring so many people to visit my palace?” Apas looked at Lingling, still observing her carefully. She pinched Lingling’s chest.

“What’re you doing?!” Lingling said angrily.

“You didn’t put anything, but they are not small. However, yours still can’t compare to mine.” Apas straightened up. Her chest was big.

“You’re crazy.”

“Do you have a boyfriend?” Apas asked.

“It’s none of your business.”

“If you have a boyfriend, I’ll steal him from you. Few men in this world can resist my beauty. I don’t mean to embarrass you. As a sister, I should help you test those men.” Apas laughed.

“My boyfriend is MO Fan. Try and steal him away from me,” Lingling said.

Apas’ smile froze.

It was not easy to steal that man. On the one hand, Mo Fan was cunning. He would take advantage of other people but would not let others take advantage of him. On the other hand, the auras of Mu Ningue and Ye Xinxia were too strong. They were the world’s most powerful Ice Element Forbidden Mage and the goddess who quelled the disputes in the Parthenon Temple!

“I don’t believe it. There’s nothing between you two,” said Apas.

“It’s been years since you left. How could you know if we are close or not?

Besides, he is trapped in the pyramid. The first person he thought of was me. He didn’t call you, even though you’re in Egypt,” Lingling said.

“Ahhh! Why? Why? I’m bigger than you and more feminine than you. I can be pure or seductive, so why?” Apas showed her little snake teeth angrily as if she was about to bite Lingling.

Lingling looked at Apas like she would look at a foolish child she disliked.

Only MO Fan could handle her.

“Do you have the Pharaoh’s Source?” Lingling asked.

Lingling was initially here to join the Hunter Competition. Now that Apas had taken control of the Evil Temple where the Sacred Hall of Sunset was located, she could ask her directly for the Pharaoh’s Source and solve the task of this competition. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Why do you want the Pharaoh’s Source?” Apas suddenly became alert. Her golden pink eyes became sharp..
