Chapter 1575 The Long and Tedious Passage

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

The passage was quite long. The fiery dragon could not push the Underworld Warriors back any further after traveling fifty meters into the passage.

The group was flanked from all sides when they were in a spacious area, making it extremely difficult to fend off their enemies. However, after they entered the passage, the Underworld Warriors struggled to attack the group due to the limited space and Zhao Manyan’s defenses. The situation was much more favorable for Mo Fan and his crew.

The seven of them moved through the passage quickly. There were walls on both sides and a sturdy ceiling above them. They only needed to take care of the limited number of enemies coming from the front and the back. It greatly reduced the burden on their shoulders!

“I’ll take care of the rear!” Mu Bai declared.

Mu Bai did not need to kill anyone. He could just freeze the Underworld Warriors and use them to block off the rest of their kind. He could easily guard their backtrail on his own.

“We’ll take turns clearing the path. The passage won’t be short. Make sure you don’t expend all your energy here,” Shreev reminded him.

Mo Fan led the way, not paying much attention to Shreev. His eyes were fixed on the delicious Soul Essences.

“Little Flame Belle, let’s clear a path together!” Mo Fan Summoned Little Flame Belle.

It took time to Channel spells. Mo Fan had no idea how long it would take him to kill so many Underworld Warriors in the long passage. He decided to let Little Flame Belle engage the enemy on her own while he relied on the Lightning Element, Shadow Element, and Space Element. It was quicker killing the undead with the two of them.

The Underworld Warriors were average Warrior-level creatures. It was more effective for them to split up!

It had been a long time since Little Flame Belle had an enjoyable fight. She recalled the Flame Charge that Mo Fan had used against Mentor Vani. She mimicked Mo Fan and engulfed herself in huge flames.

The energy of her flame filled the entire passage. With an excited cry, Little Flame Belle charged forward and killed every Underworld Warrior over a distance of a few dozen meters, like flames devouring some wild shrubs!

Mo Fan could also collect the Soul Remnants and Soul Essences of the creatures that Little Flame Belle killed. Once again, Soul Remnants in the form of fireflies were drawn into the Little Loach Pendant’s Nether River.

Mo Fan quickly caught up with Little Flame Belle, seeing another bunch of Underworld Warriors approaching them. These creatures did not travel only on the ground, many of them were moving along the walls and the ceiling.

Lightning arcs burst out of Mo Fan’s fingers, surging forward rapidly. The current was not too strong, as Mo Fan was not trying to kill the Warrior-level creatures with a Basic Lightning Strike. However, because of the Lightning Tyrant’s special effects, every Underworld Warrior that was caught by the lightning arcs was marked with the Lightning Tyrant Scar!

The lightning arcs surged back and forth between the Underworld Warriors. The lightning failed to paralyze the undead since they did not have any flesh, but the Lightning Tyrant Scars on them gradually became brighter.

“Tyrant Call!”

Mo Fan activated the spell when he saw it was the right time to do so. Thick lightning arcs erupted in the narrow space and intertwined with one another.

A single Lightning Tyrant Scar could trigger a lightning bolt comparable to a Thunderbolt!

Mo Fan’s Thunderbolt had reached the fifth-tier. Not only was it strong enough to kill a Warrior-level creature instantly, it would also form a huge lightning web on the ground or other surfaces it landed on. When a hundred of them landed on the same surface, the lightning web would keep stacking up, allowing the lightning arcs to keep conducting continuously!

The explosions triggered by the lightning bolts and the electric shock disintegrated the Underworld Warriors in no time. The evil presence ahead of the group vanished. It felt unreal how empty the passage was so suddenly!

“Quick, keep up with us!” Mo Fan told the others.

“He’s seriously a monster!” Meos could not help but curse in amazement.

Meos noticed that Mo Fan’s strength was a lot scarier than before. It had not even been that long since they had last met. These Underworld Warriors were Warrior-level creatures, yet were weaker than Servant-class creatures when facing Little Flame Belle’s flame and Mo Fan’s lightning!

It made sense that the Undead Strategy did not work against him. He could kill as many undead as he pleased if he had the chance to use his magic!

The others quickly caught up with Mo Fan. He had burned a path over a hundred meters long. Normally, a group of Mages would just force a little opening before organizing a strong push to clear the path and advance. However, with Mo Fan leading the way, the group never stopped moving forward. The Warrior-level creatures in the passage were not putting much pressure on him at all...

The passage was longer than anyone had expected. They had traveled for a full kilometer, yet the passage was perfectly still straight. The Underworld Warriors from the other end were still charging at them, as if they were coming from a bottomless abyss.

“Mo Fan, take a rest, don’t waste too much of your energy,” Heidi said when she saw Mo Fan still clearing the path ahead.

“Sure, your turn!” Mo Fan decided to rest when he noticed he had consumed almost half of his energy.

Using magic continuously was quite strenuous, and would speed up the rate of consumption of energy. Mo Fan was currently like an overheated engine. It was time for him to cool down.

“Hey, why can he rest? What about me?” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

The Underworld Warriors were not standing in lines waiting to be slain. They were constantly attacking the group with their wind blades. Zhao Manyan had endured ninety percent of the attacks. He was a human too, he needed some rest!

“I’ll summon a meat shield undead.” Meos cast an Undead Spell. She agreed that Zhao Manyan had protected the group for too long.

“Humph, you’re just that much stronger than my mummies!” Sayed mocked Zhao Manyan.

Meos and Sayed Summoned the same type of mummies. Their bodies were wrapped in gray cloth. Their size was not too impressive, but their bodies were as hard and sturdy as metal!

“They can just block the path behind us. Is the front going to be fine?” Meos asked.

“She can handle it,” Mo Fan answered on behalf of Heidi, who had already gone ahead. Heidi was unable to kill as quickly as he was, but since she was able to mind three things at once, she could easily handle the situation!

Mo Fan quickly inspected the Little Loach Pendant when he had the chance to catch his breath, like a merchant who had just earned a fortune. His eyes sparkled as he got the chance to count his profits!
