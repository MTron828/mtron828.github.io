Zhou Xian was a strange person. He totally ignored Mo Fan, who looked to be in his twenties and slowly turned around to salute the sacred statue at the front of the Prayer Hall.

The statue was a deep red. Even though it was a rock sculpture, a long red robe was covering its entire figure, making it hard for anyone to see its face or learn its gender.

“I will get rid of this intruder fairly quickly, just three minutes.. oh, in just one minute, please continue to listen to my prayer,” Zhou Xian said to the statue respectfully.

After finishing the strange action, he finally turned around. His humble, cautious appearance immediately vanished, as if he had transformed from a court eunuch to a noble emperor. His expressionless eyes were looking down on Mo Fan disdainfully.

“I won’t let you die a quick death, as you’ve disturbed my most important time!” proclaimed Zhou Xian.

Mo Fan only had the urge to say to Zhou Xian... What a f**king retard!

The Black Vatican really consisted of a bunch of maniacs who could not think logically. They were worse than a herd of pigs, yet they still wanted to act noble and sacred while treating the world as filth.

Mo Fan found this particular mentally-retarded person rather annoying. He summoned a flame on his hand and tossed it forward indifferently.

Zhou Xian was prepared to dodge the flame, yet he realized the arc of the flame was too high to hit him. It was over two meters tall higher than his head when it flew past him.

Zhou Xian burst into laughter. How did such a useless Magician manage to come so far?

However, Zhou Xian immediately realized that something was not right. He quickly turned around and discovered the flame had landed directly on the sacred red statue!

BANG!

The flame exploded, blasting the unique statue of Salan to pieces!

The pieces clattered down before Zhou Xian’s feet. His disdainful expression immediately changed as his face contorted madly.

“HAHAHA, that felt nice... better than the targets used for practice at school!” Mo Fan deftly summoned another flame.

“You! I’m going to kill you!” Zhou Xian went insane. He summoned a gust of wind and sent it in Mo Fan’s direction.

The wind was orange, and slashing forward like incredibly thin knives. The wind gradually turned into a tornado, cutting the tables and chairs in the Prayer Hall into dust. Even the bricks on the walls shared the same fate.

Mo Fan was perfectly calm. His eyes emitted a silver glow as he directed a telekinetic force to clash with the orange tornado.

The tornado looked fierce, yet it was incredibly fragile. Mo Fan’s power was able to shatter it easily. What was left of it was only strong enough to flutter Mo Fan’s clothes slightly.

“Die!” Zhou Xian totally lost control of himself. He immediately summoned a Deathstrike Magic Equipment.

The Deathstrike Magic Equipment was of the Light Element. It was golden, with the shape of a pair of scissors. The golden scissors cut at Mo Fan’s neck under Zhou Xian’s control.

Mo Fan leaned back to dodge the attack. He was about to cast Fleeing Shadow to change his position when he realized that the Light Element equipment was driving the shadows nearby away, preventing him from using the Shadow Element.

However, it did not really make any difference!

“Little Flame Belle, Fiery Feathers!”

Mo Fan was currently madder than anyone. His first wife was poisoned, so he was not in the mood to hide his strength.

Little Flame Belle was well-prepared. She immediately unleashed her overwhelming power, turning the Calamity Fire into a bunch of burning feathers.

As the feathers appeared on Mo Fan’s back, the fire lit up the Prayer Hall in blazing red flames. The long wings barely touched the walls on both sides as they were fully extended.

“Explode!” Mo Fan yelled. The feathers immediately exploded and propelled him forward at a remarkable pace, leaving a spectacular fiery trail behind him.

Mo Fan was driven forward like a rocket. He used all his might to throw a Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons into Zhou Xian’s face.

The Meteorite Fist: Nine Dragons was almost as powerful as an Advanced Spell, not to mention that its strength was multiplied by the momentum from the feathered explosion!

Mo Fan’s little fireball had only destroyed the statue. However, his fist completely razed the Prayer Hall to the ground. Fiery dragons danced wildly in the surroundings. Even the ceiling started to collapse as the surface around fifty meters above it sank down from the enormous impact.

Li Kai hid in a corner. He froze in terror when he saw the Prayer Hall flash-fired to the ground.

This young Hunter was able to execute a move as powerful as an Advanced Spell almost instantly!

Zhou Xian had already brought out his armor when he realized that something did not seem right. He had only received the armor after he was promoted to a probationary Blue Deacon, yet Mo Fan had already shattered it into pieces after using it for the first time!

Zhou Xian staggered back to his feet at the end of a burning trail. His hair had all been burned away. His white skin was covered in festering scorch marks and burns.

The confidence and disdain in his eyes were replaced with disbelief. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was already shocking that this young man was able to achieve the peak Intermediate Level at his age. Based on what he knew, even the members of the national team were only in between the Intermediate and Advanced Levels...

-Where did this monster come from?!-

“Have a taste of my lightning too!” Mo Fan’s attack did not end there. The fiery feathers were still visible on his back. However, he was not planning to use them again. He sprinted forward after withdrawing the feathers.

Purple-black lightning started flickering around Mo Fan, increasing in intensity as he ran.

Mo Fan suddenly vanished into thin air as he was running. A thick, lightning bolt had replaced him, its speed was several times his own!

Using his own body to conduct lightning!

Mo Fan had already mastered the move. Even though it was not as fast as the Rocket Wings, the damage he could inflict on the target he rammed into in the form of lightning was somewhat comparable!

Zhou Xian was stunned. He had never seen such a fighting style before!

He had only achieved the Advanced Level quite recently, and was unable to manipulate the form of his spells yet. He desperately tried to dodge when he saw the lightning bolt charging at him!

The lightning reached out and discharged loudly as it contacted Zhou Xian’s body. The lightning arcs intertwined with one another and formed an enormous lightning web.

It did not matter where Zhou Xian was trying to run to. He was scorched by the lightning on top of being severely burned by fire before. The smell of burned meat lingered in the air.

“Senior...Senior Zhou Xian,” Li Kai hid behind the debris, watching Zhou Xian falling to the ground after receiving the brutal attack.

He had placed all his hope on the probationary Blue Deacon, yet the Hunter had already defeated him before he could cast a single Advanced Spell!

“So even a Blue Deacon can be weak as hell... You, the one in the gray outfit, you should just end your own life. I can’t promise you an easy way out if I have to do it myself,” Mo Fan told the Gray Priest arrogantly, walking out from the lightning.
