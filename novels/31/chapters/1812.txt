South of the Magic City, around three hundred kilometers from Hangzhou’s territory along the highway, the group happened to pass by a place called Wanggui Town. They planned to stay for the night there.

The town was prosperous, established at a relatively higher altitude. The rise of the sea level had not bothered the town. It had even given the town a great view of the sea.

The desolate new seafront was around twenty kilometers to the east of the town. The place did not rely much on the sea. It had a freshwater lake behind it as its main source of water.

“The scenery is pretty nice here. I didn’t know there was a town in this area. It should be quite interesting to stay here for the night,” Zhao Manyan said.

Some towns would appear along the highway when one least expected it. They could see roofs with special colors, bays with crystal clear water serving as hidden lands of peace and prosperity outside the reach of modern cities and industrial zones. This Wanggui Town was such an example. It was more enjoyable to visit it than just take a quick glimpse at it, as it surprised the group with its elegance and peacefulness.

There was a checkpoint at the town’s entrance. They saw a few members of the Magic Association in their uniforms working together with the traffic police.

“I’m sorry, Wanggui Town isn’t receiving tourists for now. Please go somewhere else if you are not a Mage.” A traffic policeman signaled the group to keep moving along the highway.

“We are Mages. Did something happen at Wanggui Town?” Mo Fan piped up.

“Why do you bother asking? We are just passing by anyway. Let’s forget it if we can’t spend the night here,” Jiang Shaoxu sighed and shook her head.

“The Enforcement Union is conducting an investigation in the town. You may enter the town, but you’ll need to put your information down,” a member of the Magic Association said.

“Enforcement Union?” Mo Fan was surprised.

If the Enforcement Union was in charge of the investigation, it must be something serious, potentially a huge threat.

“Time to go, we are leaving. Mo Fan, don’t tell me you’re thinking of being a busybody again. The Enforcement Union will take care of the situation here!” Zhao Manyan said quickly.

“That’s right, is there any place that’s not feeling pressured from the coastline coming inland at a time like this?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

Lingling took out a map and said, “This Wanggui Town is quite close to our destination, Dawn Island. If we don’t rest here, our next option is Changlu Town, which is around a hundred kilometers away.”

“That far away?” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

“Mm, the places around here are empty. Wanggui Town is the only town in this area,” Lingling said.

“We’ll rest up here then. We are Mages anyway, are we afraid of some petty demon creatures?” Mo Fan said.

“Fine, we’ll spend the night here.”

The group put down their information and went into the town to stay for the night. They were planning to regroup with Mu Bai, who was coming from Fanxue Mountain to meet them.

The town seemed perfectly fine when they arrived. Many common folk were still on the streets. The restaurants and shops were operating, too.

The truth was, Mo Fan was just too hungry to travel for another hundred kilometers. An elegant town like this might lack everything else, but it would not lack delicacies. Mo Fan purposely found a delicately decorated restaurant and ordered a whole table of dishes to feast on!

“Speaking of which, which branch of the Enforcement Union is in charge here?” Zhao Manyan could not help but ask.

“It seems like Nanxi Mountain’s Enforcement Union, judging from their badges,” Lingling answered.

Lingling was familiar with the Enforcement Union, so she was able to recognize the logos of the different branches of the Enforcement Union with ease.

The Enforcement Union of Nanxi Mountain and Beiyu Mountain were to the north and south of the Lingyin Enforcement Union, respectively. The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union was mainly responsible for incidents that occurred to the south of Hangzhou, while Beiyu Mountain was responsible for those to the north of Hangzhou.

“Nanxi Mountain... I recalled someone telling me that she was appointed as an elder of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union...” Mo Fan rubbed his chin as he tried to remember who the person was.

He heard an imperious voice rising outside while he was immersed in his thoughts.

The voice belonged to a woman. She had the pleasant voice of a mature woman, but she did not sound too friendly.

“Vice President, please don’t criticize him anymore. He’s just a rookie. He’s obviously going to have a mistake or two. Let’s just go inside and have dinner first. Everyone’s starving after working for the whole day. We should still eat something, right? This restaurant is quite popular in Wanggui Town. Let’s eat something and calm down,” a man in his thirties was mediating between the two.

“I’m already full up with anger!” the mature woman stepped into the restaurant angrily and sat on a wooden stool. Her posture set off her curvy waist.

Zhao Manyan was an expert when checking out women. He soon squinted and smacked his lips.

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan, it’s a rare find! Even a vixen like Jiang Shaoxu lacks a little charm in comparison to her,” Zhao Manyan immediately spoke up.

“Do you want to die!?” Jiang Shaoxu kicked Zhao Manyan in the shin.

Mo Fan’s eyes were fixed on the woman ever since she had come into the restaurant.

“Why do I have to bring a student like you around? Can you please train somewhere else for a few years before joining the Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union? Have your feet firmly planted on the ground instead of relying on your connections!” The woman was still angry.

“Vice President Tang, isn’t he trying to learn from you humbly? He will be able to grow faster if he could learn from you right after he graduates. Don’t you agree, Zhui Min?” the man in his thirties replied quickly.

The young man named Zhu Min was seated to the side. He had his head lowered like he did not dare to talk back, yet his eyes were actually looking somewhere else. He was not being sincere at all. He only voiced out half-heartedly when his colleague mentioned his name, “That’s right, I still have a lot of things to learn from Vice Elder Tang.”

“I would have fired you if it weren’t for your father!” Vice Elder Tang spat coldly.

The look in Zhu Min’s eyes shifted slightly, yet he did not dare to make it too obvious. He vented his frustrations on the waiter when he saw someone coming up to their table, “What kind of a shitty restaurant is this? It took you so long to serve us; shouldn’t you be serving us tea and some entree first?”

The waiter was startled. He pointed at the counter and snapped back, “You can order the dishes there, but you can vent your anger outside!”

“What did you say!?” Zhu Min rose to his feet and immediately directed his Aura at the waiter.

He could endure being scolded by his Vice President, but even a waiter in a shitty restaurant dared to talk to him like that? He was still an Advanced Mage! Even the town’s mayor had to be respectful to him!

“Trying to show off your cultivation in front of me? Sit the f**k down!” the waiter’s voice intensified.

To everyone’s surprise, the waiter suddenly unleashed an even stronger Aura, and forcibly suppressed Zhu Min. He actually stumbled back down at the waiter’s order, and almost fell to the ground!

“Mo Fan!” the mature Vice Elder blurted out in joy after she finally looked at the waiter.

“Miss Tangyue, it’s been a long time. I’ve been missing you,” Mo Fan said with a harmless smile.
