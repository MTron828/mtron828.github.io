“Don’t worry about me, and don’t provoke Herr Casa, we’ll just pretend we don’t know one another,” Yan Qiu said.

“Alright.”

“I’ll be going. Herr Casa will be suspicious if I’m away for too long,” Yan Qiu told him.

Mu Bai watched Yan Qiu leave. Her figure slowly faded into the snow.

Mu Bai was a little disappointed after they had to separate again after their brief reunion. However, he could tell that Yan Qiu had indeed gotten used to her current life. He was pleased after learning that she was fine. It was indeed inappropriate to disrupt her life. After all, it had been so many years since they had last met...

Yan Qiu left the hot spring, and slowly headed back to the wooden mansion. She shook the snow on her clothes off before opening the door, taking a few extra glances behind her.

The door opened with a little squeak. When she went into the room, a tall figure was standing in front of her. He looked unusually eerie under the dim light inside the room.

His golden-brown eyes stared at Yan Qiu. Herr Casa grinned mischievously, “Did you go and meet him?”

Yan Qiu did not stop. She went up to Herr Casa and sat on his mink chair. The clear look in her eyes suddenly became a little menacing and complicated.

“Get me some water,” Yan Qiu said coldly.

Herr Casa went to the furnace and came back with a mug of hot water.

“I want it cold,” Yan Qiu noticed the steam rising from the mug and gave Herr Casa an impatient look.

“Who was the guy you went to see? How did he know you?” Herr Casa poured another glass of cold water and placed it in front of her.

“It’s tricky,” Yan Qiu rubbed her brows.

“What is it? It’s rare to see you like this,” Herr Casa said.

Yan Qiu stared at the fire in the furnace, not speaking for a long time. Herr Casa stood beside her quietly, not daring to disturb her thoughts.

Mo Fan and the others did not stay at the Holy Judgment Court for too long.

The place was too cold; it felt like they were living in a different world. It was even more secluded than the Alps Institute. Since Mo Fan had no other business here, it was meaningless for them to stay any longer. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Mo Fan was initially planning to go back to his country right away. He could not just cast aside his responsibility to look for the Totem Beasts after giving Chairman Shao Zheng his promise. His country needed him, but someone totally unexpected had shown up. Well, she was not really a person...

“You came just in time, can you help me look into something?” Mo Fan withheld the speechlessness in his heart as he spoke to the flirtatious Li Yu’e.

Li Yu’e was like a completely different person. Every action she made was enticing. Mo Fan thought Li Yu’e had been Possessed, and after taking a closer look, he realized that she really was Possessed... by one of the eight Undead Rulers, the Queen of Netherworld!

Mo Fan was quite surprised when the Queen of Netherworld showed up. He never thought a phantom could travel so far from her own territory. Most shockingly, the Queen of Netherworld was able to come and go freely in a place like the Holy Judgment Court!

“I’ve come all the way to see you, yet you’re asking me to do some manual labor instead!” The Queen of Netherworld poked Mo Fan on the chest. He already knew what she would say next, “You assh***, why didn’t you treat me with love and tenderness first?”

“Are you sure you’ve obtained Li Yu’e’s permission? Can she really accept how you just barged into her body and did something like this?” Mo Fan replied.

“I did ask for her permission. You can ask her if you don’t believe me,” the Queen of Netherworld said.

Mo Fan stared at Li Yu’e and saw the girl looking back at him. Her expression and the look in her eyes did not change by much. However, after a few seconds, her eyes gradually cleared up. The enticing look on her face was gone, too.

“Li Yu’e?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mm, it’s me... oh, she came to look for you,” Li Yu’e seemed unaware of what the Queen of Netherworld had done, yet she did not seem surprised by the missing gaps in her memory when her body was taken over. It really felt like nothing could really shock her.

Mo Fan was utterly impressed by Li Yu’e. If he was in her position, knowing his body was being controlled by a spirit would definitely scare the crap out of him!

“I’m sorry, she’s my friend, she might offend you, so please don’t mind,” Mo Fan said awkwardly.

“It’s fine, she’s very polite. She told me the reason why she’s here, and I gave her permission too,” Li Yu’e said.

“Aren’t you scared?” Mo Fan said.

“A little at the start, but I’m fine now,” Li Yu’e said.

“Well, I’ve agreed to open a gate to the Underworld for them. I can’t make them wait for too long, so I’ll have to pay a visit to Egypt. The Queen of Netherworld will help me with the task on behalf of the Kingdom of Undead of my homeland,” Mo Fan told her.

Mo Fan had no clue if Li Yu’e understood what he was saying. Anyone else might think he was a lunatic if he said the same thing to them.

“Mm,” Li Yu’e listened.

“...then allow me to bid farewell to you first,” Mo Fan said.

“Sure, we’ll meet ag... See, I told you I already have her permission, yet you’re still being so fierce to me. I was so scared!” the Queen of Netherworld protested.

Mo Fan dropped his jaw when he saw Li Yu’e revert to the Queen of Netherworld in just a second. -Sister, couldn’t you wait to take over until she finished her sentence?-

“You’ve been borrowing other people’s bodies to travel all the way here. By the way, you are pretty good with modern slang already. I bet you didn’t trouble the young ladies in the cities?” Mo Fan said.

“Hehe, the cities are fun, but they aren’t suitable for us undead. My magic is only strong enough for me to Possess a person temporarily. It’s quite a huge mental burden,” the Queen of Netherworld answered.

“You shouldn’t be so smug, either. We are currently at the Holy Judgment Court, and there are a lot of powerful Mages here. If someone caught you and treated you as a test subject, like a thousand-year-old magic sample, you would really end up as a disgrace to the undead of our country,” Mo Fan reminded the Queen of Netherworld.

“That’s not possible, one of the strongest organizations in the world? I feel like there aren’t many people here that are strong enough for me to break a sweat,” the Queen of Netherworld sniffed with a disdainful expression.

“You kept interrupting. I almost forgot something. I’ll bring you to a grave. Help me see where its owner went,” Mo Fan said.

“We have real business to attend to.”

“This is real business, too. Do me a favor, you are a professional at this,” Mo Fan said, and brought the Queen of Netherworld to Yuria’s grave.
