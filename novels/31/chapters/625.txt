It had been a while since Mo Fan last had this feeling. The unique tempo as the rain was tapping on the bricks and the roof of the residence served as a lullaby sending him to sleep. He had never felt the same way after his father Mo Jiaxin sold the old house just so he could become a Magician.

Mo Fan was in a very deep sleep. He did wake up for a moment, but fell right back into it. It was the kinds of sleep where you could no longer distinguish if it was day or night, or even remember who he was. He was utterly relaxed, his mind blank after he woke up, but the surge of memories returned about him being a Magician, his Double Innate Elements, the Calamity of Bo City, Pearl Institute, him turning into a demon, the Black Totem Snake and the calamity of Ancient Capital...wait, what’s after the calamity?

Oh, it still had not ended yet. He was still right in the middle of the terrifying disaster...

At this thought, Mo Fan was fully awake all of a sudden. He opened his heavy eyelids and glanced at his surroundings, and saw Liu Ru lying beside him, like she was taking care of a patient.

“How do you feel?” Liu Ru had a gentle smile when she saw Mo Fan waking up. Despite her alluring lips and eyes flickering with the charm of Blood Tribe, the innocence in her bones was still on full display.

“I don’t know, it feels like I was having a long dream,” said Mo Fan.

It felt exactly like how he had fallen asleep on the hill behind the school, before realizing that he had traversed to this world. Mo Fan was suddenly afraid that everything until now was only a ridiculous dream, yet when he thought how the city was being devoured by the undead, maybe it would be better if it were a dream, since there were too many people dying now.

“I’ve fed you the energy acquired from a few Phantom Generals through blood, so the process might have been resulted in some impact to your soul, sending you into a deep sleep,” explained Liu Ru.

“I see, I thought I’d traversed again,” said Mo Fan.

“Why again?” asked Liu Ru, like she was following a script.

“Hehe, let’s not talk about that, I can feel that my energy has recovered... By the way, where are Zhang Xiaohou and the others?” blurted out Mo Fan.

“Don’t worry, I’ve left a little bat mark on Zhang Xiaohou. It will bring us to where they are,” Liu Ru slowly opened her palm, where lay a transparent red bat like a crystal.

Bats were normally ugly, but this one in Liu Ru’s hand was incredibly adorable, like a fat hamster with a bow tie.

“Where’s the army of undead now?” Mo Fan was more concerned about this. The army of undead was like a tsunami of death. There was simply no chance of survival if they were caught in it.

“It’s around six kilometers away from the inner walls. I think we are around four kilometers away from the inner walls,” said Liu Ru.

“...” Somehow Mo Fan felt that Liu Ru was too calm when describing the situation to him.

Holy shit, the army of undead is only two kilometers away!

——

Liu Ru was extremely quick. She dragged Mo Fan across the streets and buildings as she sprinted at her full speed...

Mo Fan turned his head around boldly and felt his scalp turning numb!

The army of undead had already eaten half of the Ancient Capital. The outer walls were lost in the black ocean. The rolling tide of flesh simply covered everything he could see. Even when he tried his very best to look further into the distance, all he could see were zombies and skeletons that made the deepest part of his soul shiver!

The City North no longer existed!

“Sister Liu Ru, if you actually woke me up slightly later, I would have died sleeping,” Mo Fan commented as he slowly turned his head back.

“Well, it’s just that you looked so tired,” said Liu Ru, feeling a little ashamed.

“Staying alive is more important... huh, where did your little bat go?” asked Mo Fan.

“I think it has found Zhang Xiaohou and the others. Follow me,” Liu Ru dragged Mo Fan as she crossed a bridge like it was a hurdle. Meanwhile, Mo Fan was left unbalanced in the air, completely losing his center of gravity. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Liu Ru leapt into the sky, kicking the bridge so softly that it was like a dragonfly tapping the surface of the water. It was like Mo Fan was weightless to her...

“Can we not walk on the street lamps?!” Mo Fan was shaken by all the jumping.

Liu Ru was surely an expert at Maplestory or Super Mario. The street lamps lined up had somehow become her highway. The undead roaming on the streets and the abandoned vehicles were no impediment to her speed.

Even though it felt easy and efficient, she should really consider the weak flesh of Magicians. ‘Riding’ Liu Ru was even riskier and exciting than riding the Swift Star Wolf!

“Strange, they seemed to have stopped here for some time. I wonder what’s going on,” Liu Ru turned the corner and discovered a small park ahead.

It was now winter, and the park was full of naked trees with their clothes off, revealing their rough brown skin. There were also sculptures, fake hills, flower bushes, and a pond in the park. It looked slightly European, a rather out-of-the-place spot in this city full of ancient Chinese history.

As they arrived at the park that was standing out from the scenery in the surroundings, they quickly saw a few villagers of Hua Village hiding in the small hills, their bodies curled up.

Strangely, there were some zombies nearby. They were only a few tens of meters away from the villagers, yet they totally ignored their existence. Anyone else would have been dragged out of there and eaten alive!

“It seems like these undead won’t attack the people of the villagers either,” said Mo Fan in surprise as he observed from the distance.

“But the effect doesn’t last forever. They have to accept the baptism of the water from the Kun Wells every month. Otherwise, the effect will wear off eventually,” said Liu Ru.

“What are they doing hiding there? The undead are obviously not posing any threat to them,” Mo Fan was confused.

“Let’s go and ask,” said Liu Ru.

“No, stay here and watch, something doesn’t feel right...” said Mo Fan.

Liu Ru pondered for a moment, before she held her palm close to her lips and blew softly.

Her breath was red, like the color of wine, which quickly transformed into a few tiny bats which flew away like normal bugs.

“I’ve sent them to take a look, I can smell something pungent,” whispered Liu Ru.

“Mm, let’s be careful.”

“Oh, by the way, after you found me, I keep feeling that someone is following us,” said Liu Ru.

Mo Fan was stunned, before he said, “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?!”

“Initially, I thought it was the same person that gave me the blood serums, but the guy somehow exposed his presence trying to catch up to us,” said Liu Ru.

“The person that gave you blood serums?” Mo Fan was startled again before he could recover from the previous shock.

“Ah, didn’t I tell you?” asked Liu Ru with a dumbfounded look.

“I feel like you’re the one with amnesia!” Mo Fan was left speechless.

“I thought I already told you. Too much is going on, my mind is kind of messed up. Besides, I didn’t think it was that important, my bad!” Liu Ru stuck her tongue out at Mo Fan.

“It’s kinda important...” Mo Fan was going to mock Liu Ru more when a sudden thought crossed his mind, halting his speech halfway!

Liu Ru thought she had committed a serious mistake when she saw the grim expression on Mo Fan’s face. She did not dare to look Mo Fan in the eyes.
