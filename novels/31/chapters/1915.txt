“Young man, are you hurt?” the Sound Mage’s voice suddenly echoed in Mo Fan’s ears.

Mo Fan looked toward the bridge and saw the Sound Mage was actually quite far away from him. The man had obviously transmitted his voice into his ears.

“I’m fine, do you need me to do anything?” Mo Fan asked.

“The sea monsters are entering the strait from the east. There are more of them behind the waves we are looking at from here. Gaoqi Airport and Jimei University are located at the entrance of the strait. The school still has land available. I notice that you are an artillery Mage, so may I ask you to head to Jimei University and bombard the sea monsters who are entering the strait with your spells? It will reduce their numbers before they reach the strait,” the Sound Mage said.

Jimei University was directly opposite Mo Fan’s position, very close to the strait. The terrain was not that high, so most of the school was submerged in seawater. However, the hills and the buildings were perfect for Mo Fan to fight on!

“Alright, I’ll go there at once,” Mo Fan agreed.

“Since you are a Super Mage, I’ll place you in charge of the battle there. Many students and teachers of the school are waiting,” the Sound Mage said.

“Leave it to me!”

Even though Jimei University was opposite the strait, which was around four kilometers away, Mo Fan was a non-swimmer and unable to fly, and did not dare cross the strait to the other side. Most importantly, the strait was now a battlefield for the fight between the three Super Level advisors and Qiu Zi. He had no clue whether Qiu Zi was going to vent its frustrations on him if he crossed the strait.

Mo Fan simply ran to Jimei Bridge and wove through the crowd with his Fleeing Shadow.

The bridge was fully crowded with civilians. Luckily, the situation was still under control with the protection provided by the barrier. The people were slowly being evacuated.

Mo Fan noticed there were many Earth Mages on the bridge as he was crossing it. They were using Earth Wave to speed the civilians up. The tactic was quite effective. It would take ages for them to evacuate the city if they were merely walking at their own paces!

Mo Fan reached the other side of the bridge and saw a Water Mage riding the waves. “That should be it... mm? Someone is riding the waves. He seems to be heading in the same direction too.” The waves were heading in the direction of his destination. The Water Mage simply stood on the waves while they were rolling toward Jimei University.

“Hey, kind sir, give me a ride please, I’m on my way to Jimei University too!” Mo Fan quickly yelled when he saw the man brush past him.

“What are you doing? I have urgent matters to attend to,” the Mage on the waves snarled.

The place was in such great chaos. How could he possibly have the time to give someone a ride? Besides, he was the director of the Water School in Jimei University, not a f**king cab who would stop whenever someone waved at him! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The man ignored Mo Fan and continued on his way.

Mo Fan’s head hurt when he saw the fierce waves in front of him.

He had the option to cross the waves with Blink, but it would be a waste of his energy if he had to rely on Blink to travel such a long distance. The battle had been going on for quite some time. It was not like he had unlimited energy.

“Are you a student too? Hurry up and get on my Summoned Beast!” A Maga with a long ponytail showed up beside Mo Fan. She had come to a stop after hearing Mo Fan’s yell.

“Oh, thank you so much, fellow schoolmate!” Mo Fan jumped onto the back of the young woman’s Summoned Beast.

Mo Fan was quite surprised when he observed the Summoned Beast clearly. The Maga’s Contracted Beast was a Sea Gong Fighter! Mo Fan was not an expert about the Summoning Element, but the official documents of the Summoning Element had records on a lot of rare Contracted Beasts. Among them, the Sea Gong Fighter was a powerful Contracted Beast that was extremely friendly and loyal to humans. Mo Fan had seen their young being sold at crazy prices during more than one auction.

He had failed to get on the waves previously, yet a Summoner with an impressive Contracted Beast had shown up instead!

“Fellow schoolmate? I’m not a student, I’m a teacher,” the Summoner giggled.

“Oh, I’m not a student either!”

Mo Fan followed the Summoner to Jimei University. According to the Sound Mage, he was supposed to set himself up like a defensive cannon on this side of the strait, and bombard the army of sea monsters that were invading the strait.

If so, Mo Fan had to find a suitable location. It had to be close to the strait so the sea monsters were within range of his spells. Second, it had to be on the high ground so the place was not submerged underwater, preventing the sea monsters from flanking him. Last, the place should have tall buildings around it. Wouldn’t it make more sense to set up a cannon at the tallest spot?

“Fellow teacher, may I ask is there any place that fits these criteria?” Mo Fan shared his thoughts with the Summoner.

“The president of the Donghai Magic Association has already sent someone to command us. You just need to come with me to the gathering point and follow his orders,” the Summoner said.

“...Ugh, I’m the commander!” Mo Fan told her.

The Summoner did not treat Mo Fan’s words seriously, as she had placed her attention on the students on a kiosk. They rode the Sea Gong Fighter to the kiosk.

“Students, get on my beast now,” the Summoner ordered.

“Miss Biling, we’ve been waiting for you... a whole bunch of Scarlet Soaring Demons are heading toward the strait from the lake behind the library. They will be able to invade the island through Gaoqi Airport once they cross the strait. We are at the rear of the path the sea monsters are taking. We might be able to take them out,” a representative among the students said with glittering eyes.

The student was very eager to show off his strength. He was somehow very excited about the fight!

“Alright, we’ll head to the library. The director of the Water School, Deng Yongchuan, is already ahead of us. I saw him heading to the library. We aren’t sure when the commander is going to arrive. Let’s prepare ourselves in advance first,” the Summoner named Biling said sternly.
