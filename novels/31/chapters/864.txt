A man walked out of the Three Step Tower with a confident stride. His face seemed to be hinting that the whole world was within his grasp.

“HAHAHA, I, Guan Ying, have finally improved my second Element to the Intermediate Level! I can finally train on the same team as Wen Jing and crush that asshole Xu Dongqiang. Uncle is going to be impressed too, how splendid!...” The man who referred to himself as Guan Ying burst out laughing in excitement.

Meanwhile, a man in simple clothing and unkempt hair was also walking with a confident stride and joy on his face.

“HAHAHA, I finally did it. I am a f**king genius!” The man was laughing even more crazily.

Guan Ying was interested in making friends. He immediately went up to the man after seeing that he was around the same age as him. “Brother, it looks like your hard work has paid off too. Mine did too, but I didn’t really have anyone to celebrate with. It’s noon, so my stomach is already grumbling. Why don’t we go have some drinks and celebrate together? I know a barbecue place, I can guarantee that it’s one of the best!”

“Why not?” the man agreed.

“Come, haha, it’s better to have someone to celebrate with. By the way, brother, which school are you from?” said Guan Ying.

“The Fire School,” replied the student.

“Fire School, I heard everyone there is extremely violent. However, I swear I saw flickers of lightning around you when you came out just then. I thought you were from the Lightning School,” exclaimed Guan Ying.

“Mmm, Lightning is my secondary Element,” answered the student. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Damn, Lightning and Fire, they say it’s the most violent combination. I am Guan Ying from the Light School. Lunch is on me, we can look after one another if anything happens... so your Lightning Element has also improved. Lightning and Fire are pretty scary together. Congratulations, I bet you’ve worked hard for it?” said Guan Ying.

“Yeah, I almost failed to expand my Lightning Element into a Galaxy. I f**king went all out when I thought about all the money I would lose if I failed the process. I almost fried my own brain. Luckily, I managed to break the barrier in the end. If the barrier was just a bit tougher, I might just be a retard now,” replied Mo Fan.

Guan Ying burst into laughter upon hearing it. He patted Mo Fan on the shoulder and said, “Brother, you must be very happy. You even mixed up your Nebula with a Galaxy. Galaxy is for Advanced Level. Yours is a Nebula. The Advanced Level is like a dream for us. I don’t even know if I can become an Advanced Magician in the future...”

Mo Fan remained silent.

Guan Ying soon realized the strange atmosphere. He looked at Mo Fan and asked with a strange expression, “Well, did you seriously improve to the Advanced Level?”

Mo Fan nodded with a smile. He was aware that he should not be too high-profile.

Guan Ying’s expression changed immediately, but he still forced a smile and said, “You are only around my age. How are you an Advanced Magician? Please don’t trick me like that...”

Guan Ying tried to inspect Mo Fan’s cultivation with his will. Normally, Mo Fan could have stopped someone else from probing his cultivation, but he had just had a breakthrough. He needed to share the joy with someone, so he did not stop the man.

As he thought, in just a few seconds, Guan Ying’s expression suddenly turned indescribable. He even froze in his tracks.

The joy he had from breaking through to the Intermediate Level was gone within an instant. It was replaced by lightning strikes shattering his fragile heart.

-I don’t want to live anymore!-

The barbecue place that Guan Ying had in mind was not bad at all, but for some reason, the man did not really eat much, even though he looked like he was really starving when he first came out of the Three Step Tower.

Mo Fan was not too bothered by it. He was more than happy to clean up the table full of meat.

“Thanks for the treat, let’s drink again some other time!” Mo Fan left in satisfaction.

Guan Ying forced a smile as he watched Mo Fan left. For some reason, it felt worse than if he had failed the breakthrough!

Mo Fan went back to the apartment. He felt disappointed when he saw the place still empty. Where did his two beloved concubines go? Why hadn’t they received him yet? He was thinking of sharing the joy of improving his Lightning Element to the Advanced Level with them.

“Advanced Level, Advanced Level Lightning, HAHAHA, magnificent, magnificent! I should let Miss Tangyue know!...”

Mo Fan sent a text, hoping that his Miss Tangyue would reply to him instantly to compliment his talent. In the end, Tangyue did not even reply to him. She must be busy doing some work for the Enforcement Union...

Mo Fan sent another text to Lingling, just to let his partner know that he know had two Elements in the Advanced Level. Look how awesome he is! He can definitely take on the difficult quests and earn big bucks!

Only a Hunter Master could easily earn some quick cash. Mo Fan was tired of the little requests that anyone could accomplish.

He suddenly heard the sound of the door being unlocked. Mo Fan leapt off from the couch like a kid who had just scored a hundred on a test.

The person pushing the door open was Mu Nujiao, with her slender figure and long, slim legs. She seemed even more charming after changing her hairstyle to parting in the middle. Every action she did was elegant, like a well-raised daughter of an eminent family!

“Surprise!”

“Jiaojiao, it’s been a long time. Come, give me a...”

Mo Fan sprang to the door. He was planning to take advantage of Mu Nujiao before she could react. However, Mo Fan shockingly discovered a familiar face right behind Mu Nujiao, the same gorgeous face that could make his heart pound heavily. However, for some reason, he almost lost his soul when he saw the face this time.

“Give...give me your bag, why are you lifting such a heavy bag yourself? I’ll take it for you... ah, Xuexue, why are you here too? What a surprise? Why didn’t you tell me you were in Shanghai? I could have gone to pick you up!” Mo Fan grabbed the little handbag that Mu Nujiao was carrying.

Mu Nujiao took her shoes off with a stunned look, but proceeded to invite Mu Ningxue into the place.

Mu Ningxue had gone straight to the National Training Hall after arriving in Shanghai. However, it turned out that the National Training Hall did not provide students with accommodations. Since Mu Nujiao already knew Mu Ningxue, and they had both gone through the disaster at Jinlin City together, she decided to bring Mu Ningxue back to her place, as the girl had yet to find a place to stay at in Shanghai.

Mu Nujiao did not mention Mo Fan was staying with her, nor did she know that Mo Fan was also on the national team. She had no idea why Mo Fan had been gone for such a long time.

Ai Tutu had not been staying at the apartment lately. The whole place felt rather empty. Therefore, Mu Nujiao was planning to let Mu Ningxue stay with her to keep her company. To her surprise, Mo Fan had come back too!

“Oh right, I forgot to tell you that Mo Fan lives here too,” Mu Nujiao explained with a smile.

“You two are living together?” Mu Ningxue asked calmly.

Mu Nujiao’s face blushed. She awkwardly pointed at the rooms upstairs, “It’s not what you think. We are just renting the place together. He lives in that room, and my bestie and I live in the other room. This unit was the last place available that was close to Pearl Institute, so we happened to stumble upon the same place when we were looking for a place to stay when we first enrolled at the institute.”

Mu Ningxue was quite surprised to see a man in Mu Nujiao’s place, and he turned out to be Mo Fan, no less! She almost turned around and left, yet when she saw the rooms were indeed separate and listened to Mu Nujiao’s explanation, she did not comment further.

On second thought, if Mu Nujiao was really living together with Mo Fan, she had no reason to bring her here.
