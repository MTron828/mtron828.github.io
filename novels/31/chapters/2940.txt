Chapter 2941: A Hidden Problem

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Sir, you still have a way to get out of this situation. As long as you don’t dabble in Forbidden Curses, the country and I will ensure your safety from the people of the Holy City. However, the moment you turn to Forbidden Curses, it will be equivalent to declaring a war on them,” said Sharjah to Mo Fan.

“Sharjah, which side are you on?” asked Mo Fan.

“I want to make up for the mistake of not protecting Mr. Feng Zhoulong,” said Sharjah solemnly.

“So, are you going to continue fighting?”

“Yes. This conflict will not be settled with ease,” said Sharjah.

“How can I let you fight the battle alone?”

Sharjah stared at Mo Fan, and life gradually returned to her eyes. She looked happy.

“That’s great! Mr. Mo, I can fight alongside you again! I like this. Whenever I’m with you, I feel as if I’m still alive, as if my heart is still beating and my blood is still warm.” Sharjah smiled radiantly. She no longer looked as if she had been shrouded by a layer of mystery and otherworldliness like before.

Mo Fan could not help but stretch out his hand to pat on Sharjah’s head. If it had not been for the fact that Sharjah was an Archangel, she would still be the na?ve, energetic student he had taught.

“Speaking of which, many people saw you pick me up at the city gate. The Archangel who hasn’t returned to his position would be aware of this too. If that’s the case, he will see you as his enemy,” said Mo Fan.

“More than one of them have set their sights on you. People in the Holy City once held a special, secret meeting to discuss the incident involving the Azure Dragon and the demons. They summoned all the Archangels to the meeting, except for me. They knew about us from Dubai,” said Sharjah, calmly.

“When you’re alone in the Holy City, did they ostracize you?” Mo Fan could not help but ask with concern.

“Not everyone is our enemy. Of course, some of them pretend to be our friends. It’s complicated. The longer I stay in the Holy City, the more I miss my school days in Ojos Holy School. I miss how the students competed and were jealous of one another, I miss watching the eccentric teachers working on meaningless things…,” said Sharjah.

“Now that you mention it, I also miss my days at Pearl Institute.” Mo Fan chuckled.

Mo Fan missed Pearl Institute. However, the students there may not miss him. As soon as he joined the institute, he snatched all the resources. Most of the students hated him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

No matter how strained the relationship was between Mo Fan and the students, Pearl Institute was long gone. The Magic City had become part of the Ocean Demons’ lair.

Despite having the will to save the world, it rejected him.

“Sir, have you made up your mind about the path to the realm of the Forbidden Curse?” Sharjah inquired about Mo Fan’s cultivation issue.

“Not yet. Perhaps I can find some clues from the totem beasts,” said Mo Fan.

The clues lay on the Mysterious Feather Sacred Totem Beast. Mo Fan already had the Fiery Furnace in his heart. He believed his Fire Element magic would grow closer to the Mysterious Feather Sacred Totem Beast.

He had to find more totem beasts related to the Mysterious Feather Sacred Totem Beast for his Fire Element to grow stronger!

The Fire Element was Mo Fan’s strongest ability. It was also the one element that showed the greatest promise for him to dabble in Forbidden Curses.

“I found a clue here, but it’s not very clear. Sir, you may still have to dig out more information on your own. It’s about the birth of a demonic creature in East Guardian Tower in Japan. It’s on the verge of becoming a Wicked God.” Sharjah took out an item that resembled a pearl from the Space Bracelet.

The exterior of the pearl was clear and lustrous, but the inside was extremely murky, as if it had been injected with contaminated gas.

“What is this?” Mo Fan asked in puzzlement.

“Sir, I sensed a similar aura from you,” said Sharjah.

“It’s the Red Demon!” Mo Fan cried out.

“So, you’re aware of this, too. The quasi-Wicked God has obtained the Eight Souls from heaven and earth. It’s going to gather massive evil energy from every prison and jail in the world. It’ll become the Emperor of the Evil Temple in the next moonless night,” whispered Sharjah.

This was a confidential matter in the Holy City. It was also a hidden issue in Sharjah’s authority. Originally, Ramiel wanted to obtain the right to handle the issue. After Sharjah sensed the aura from the evil pearl that was similar to Mo Fan, she stopped him.

Sharjah had some of the priesthood personnel to follow up the matter before she finally learned about the quasi-Wicked God’s Evil Temple and the Ascension Ceremony.

“I’ve been tracking it for a long time. It has multiple identities, so it’s impossible to tell which of them is the true one,” said Mo Fan.

“The Red Demon has to use its true identity if it wants to become the emperor under the moonless night!” said Sharjah with great conviction.

“We can’t let it ascend to become an emperor. It’s an extremely dangerous creature,” said Mo Fan.

“Yes. Otherwise, it would not have been listed in the Holy City list. Sir, you can make good use of this opportunity,” said Sharjah.

“What do you mean?” Mo Fan did not quite understand what Sharjah was trying to say.

“Evil energy becomes evil when it is used by evil forces. Sir, you have a similar aura within you, yet you’re not affected by it. This shows that you can harness that energy. With your current level of cultivation, you’re qualified to enter the Forbidden Curse realm. So, this is a good opportunity for you to become a Forbidden Mage by using Red Demon as your cornerstone,” said Sharjah.

Sharjah needed Mo Fan to become a Forbidden Mage. Otherwise, how would he fight with the experts of the Holy City? Mo Fan’s Demon Element power was not stable, and the Azure Dragon was in deep slumber. Hence, he had to have the power to fight the battle!

The Magic Association would not give Mo Fan a chance to dabble in Forbidden Curses. He had to rely on himself to become a Forbidden Mage. He could use the totem beasts to become a Forbidden Mage for good. However, the path of searching for totem beasts was time-consuming. They did not have much time left. Mu Ningxue could not possibly stay in the Extreme South for long. Also, Xinxia’s election was around the corner.

Something big was about to happen soon. Since Mo Fan decided to fight the war, he had to dabble in Forbidden Curses this year!

“Thank you. This information is very useful to me!” Mo Fan nodded.

“There are many spies working for the Archangels among the priesthood. I’ll have the priesthood personnel withdraw from this issue. Sir, I suppose you can find the target, right?” asked Sharjah.

“No problem.”

“You have to be very careful. The problem is so serious that the Archangel decided to personally handle it. Any single mistake can make it the Red Demon and later, the Wicked God.”

“I’ve dealt with him for many years. Don’t worry,” said Mo Fan.

“There’s a compass inside the Holy City. It shows the direction of the energy that surpasses the level of the Forbidden Curse.”

“Regardless of whether you have become a Forbidden Mage, or whether the Red Devil has become the emperor by then, the compass in the Holy City will show the same direction. People in the Holy City are aware of it.”

“I’ll also submit a “failed” affirmation to the Holy City so that when you dabble in the Forbidden Curse realm, people in the Holy City will assume you’re the Red Demon. With that, you can hide yourself along the way,” Sharjah said with caution.

Mo Fan stared at Sharjah, he did not expect her to be so meticulous.

Fortunately, Sharjah was on his side. Otherwise, the road to the big confrontation would be even more challenging!
