The saber was flying around five meters above the ground. Mu Ningxue was now fully aware of her opponent’s tricks after seizing the initiative of the duel.

When the presence of frost reached a certain level, Mu Ningxue could even produce ice and snow with her thoughts alone.

The whole place was covered in ice. The Ice Spread had stacked up lots of layers of ice. When Mu Ningxue saw the black saber approaching, she quickly summoned the ice particles and rapidly built hills of ice in front of her!

Mounds of ice emerged from the ground. Each of them was over seven meters tall. The three hills of ice served as Mu Ningxue’s best defense!

The black saber was spinning with an incredible force. The first hill was broken into pieces with brute force. However, as the saber collided with the second hill, its speed dramatically decreased. It was no longer producing strong gusts of wind...

However, it was still flying through the air. Its sharp edge stuck heavily into the third hill, which was around eight meters thick. The saber only managed to penetrate a third of the hill before coming to a stop.

Sayed was stunned!

How did the woman cast magic without drawing a Star Pattern? And... ice hills?

The Ice Element had never had such a spell in the Basic, Intermediate or Advanced Level. It did not look like a different form of the usual Ice Spells, either. It was a completely new ability!

The Death Saber Mummy’s spinning saber was its strongest attack, yet it had failed to overwhelm the opponent’s three defending ice hills...

Little did Sayed know, Mu Ningxue had once used the ice hills to defend against a real Commander-level creature’s attack. The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s vicious slash was a lot stronger than the Death Saber Mummy, but Mu Ningxue had still managed to stop its attack with the ice hills!

The stronger the presence of frost, the stronger her ability was. The ice hills were another form of her magic under the effects of her Ice Domain!

“You...you’re not an Intermediate Magician!” Sayed pointed at Mu Ningxue and snapped furiously. An Intermediate Magician could not possibly have done that! The woman must have hidden her real cultivation!

The truth was, Sayed had never even seen any Advanced Ice Magician possess such a remarkable control over the Ice Element!

“What’s going on? Mu Ningxue’s Ice Element is completely different than ours!” a defender who also possessed the Ice Element yelled out in surprise.

She was a peak Intermediate Ice Magician too, yet Mu Ningxue’s Ice Element felt alive. Why was Mu Ningxue’s Ice Element so much stronger, while her Ice Spells were forever limited in the form of Ice Spread and Ice Lock?

“Yeah, it’s unbelievable. The Death Saber Mummy is almost as strong as a Commander-level creature. How did she manage to stop the attack?” said Li Yijun.

“She’s really remarkable. She had full control of the duel. The Ice Spread has stacked up to a terrifying level. The Death Saber Mummy will soon be frozen!”

The crowd was more confused than they were astounded. Mu Ningxue’s abilities were obviously beyond the Intermediate Level!

“It’s the Ice Domain, her innate talent,” said Mu Nujiao.

Mu Nujiao had already seen Mu Ningxue’s talent when she was an exchange student. Mo Fan was her opponent, and he had also displayed his Double Innate Elements in the duel. Back then, their cultivation was on par with one another, and both of them had outstanding innate talents. Mu Nujiao could easily tell both of them would grow a lot stronger, and as she thought, they had both joined the national team!

“Do...domain?” The students almost dropped their jaws to the ground.

Most people had only heard about Domains, but not many had actually seen one. Even their teachers who were Advanced Magicians did not necessarily have the ability to construct a Domain!

Having capabilities beyond the Advanced Level when her cultivation was only in the Intermediate Level, this was the true standard of the national team!

“I heard some inside information. Apparently, Mu Ningxue was only disqualified from the national team because her family was involved with the Black Vatican. The truth is, it’s likely that she’s one of the strongest members on the national team. It’s such a relief that she has come to the National Training Hall today! That Egyptian is surely going to suffer, we must teach him a lesson!”

“That’s right, he didn’t even apologize when he almost killed someone. He even argued that duels are always cruel! Cruel my ass!”

“Mu Ningxue, since he’s a guest in our country. Let’s go easy on him. Just crippling him is fine!” someone among the crowd shouted.

Power was the ultimate truth. The students of the National Training Hall were very relieved when they saw Mu Ningxue securing the edge of the duel. No one really cared about the negative news that her family was involved in. Someone had come to their territory to challenge them, and even humiliate them after he almost killed their representative. However, Mu Ningxue had stepped forward to serve justice. How could such a righteous person have anything to do with the Black Vatican?

“Let that asshole know the consequences of provoking us, we can’t let him go so easily!”

“Keep it up, Mu Ningxue!”

Bullying was the most detestable act, while being forced to swallow insults and run away was extremely humiliating. Luckily, Mu Ningxue had intervened. Otherwise, the defenders of the National Training Hall and the students from other institutes would forever live in shame.

Mu Ningxue was a lot calmer and more patient than everyone thought.

Even when her frost had covered the whole dueling ground and secured her the advantage, she was willing to wait longer.

Sayed formerly smiling face was now expressionless. His confident dimples had disappeared. The disdain and pride in his eyes had vanished, too.

He had no choice but to reevaluate his opponent. The strength that the woman had displayed was above the average level of a national team. As a matter of fact, she could even be considered an elite!

He had no intention of losing the duel, as it would cost his team the challenge stamp that was already within his reach.

Sayed was in deep thought. He knew he could no longer rely on the Death Saber Mummy. He had to defeat the woman by attacking at the right time!

“Freeze!” Mu Ningxue did not give Sayed any time to think as she strengthened the Ice Spread. The freezing energy penetrated the Death Saber Mummy’s body fiercely.

The Death Saber Mummy’s movements became very clumsy. Its fleshy body had entirely stiffened, as it was freezing at an even faster rate.

She gradually approached the Death Saber Mummy to utilize the maximum potential of her Domain.

Not long after, the Death Saber Mummy could no longer move. At this point in the duel, an Ice Magician was basically unbeatable. Even the most agile opponent would be turned into an ice statue. The whole dueling ground was covered in ice, including where Sayed was standing.

Finally, the Death Saber Mummy was turned into a small hill of frozen meat. It could not even move its finger.

Mu Ningxue stepped on the snow and slowly walked past the Death Saber Mummy. She was staring coldly at the Undead Magician, Sayed. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sayed did not cast an Undead Spell again, implying that he only had two reliable undead creatures.

Sayed did have quite a lot of undead he could call on, but they were weak creatures who would be turned into ice instantly after they were summoned. They would not make any difference!
