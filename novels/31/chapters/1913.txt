Qiu Chi realized its secret weapons against Baxia had all died miserably in the flames. It immediately looked around and saw a few humans on Baxia’s back who were busy massacring its parasites!

Qiu Chi was enraged. Its strength was inferior to Baxia, even though its size was around the same. However, Baxia’s defenses were clearly stronger. Its bones had already fractured after the two collided with one another a few times. Meanwhile, Baxia was perfectly unharmed. It would clearly struggle to break down Baxia’s defenses without the help of its parasites!

On the other hand, more humans were keeping Qiu Zi busy, forcing Qiu Chi to fight Baxia alone. They were clearly at a disadvantage!

Qiu Chi yelled and suddenly dashed to one side. It swung its deadly bone whips into the air before they lashed down like bolts of lightning!

The duration of Mo Fan’s Seal of the Nine Laws had already run out, so Qiu Chi was able to use both of its bone whips again. It was swinging the bone whips at the back of Baxia’s head from both sides. It looked like it was going to choke Baxia instead of whipping him.

Mo Fan looked up with a confused expression.

Did Qiu Chi already give up on using its brain? Baxia’s overall shape was a tortoise, so his neck was extremely short. He just needed to shrug a little to protect his head with his shell. Wasn’t Qiu Chi pretty stupid to be aiming for his neck?

One of the bone whips suddenly changed path while he was lost in his thoughts. It suddenly turned and lashed at Mo Fan!

“Damn it!” Mo Fan cursed.

He knew something was off. Qiu Chi was actually targeting him! His flames had obviously infuriated the sea monster!

The bone whip was extremely quick, and was coming in at a very tough angle too. Mo Fan looked up and felt like a white skeleton dragon was swinging its tail down to slice the mountains and seas in half!

Mo Fan definitely had a hard time enduring the creature’s full strength, especially when the bone whip was engulfed in blood-red steam. It was even stronger than before, as if the creature had entered its enraged state!

As the bone whip was coming down, Mo Fan noticed Baxia’s back bulging and forming a round shield around him!

The bone whip landed on the shield, leaving an obvious mark on it. Mo Fan could only feel his head buzzing...

“Brother Fan!” Zhang Xiaohou’s face went pale when he saw the bone whip attack Mo Fan out of nowhere.

“I’m fine, Baxia is keeping an eye on me!” Mo Fan climbed out from under the shield and looked to the side. He immediately saw a terrifying scar on Baxia’s shell. The bone whip’s strength was absolutely shocking!

However, Baxia was not to be messed with either! He did not give Qiu Chi the chance to withdraw its bone whip, grabbing the bone whip that had attacked Mo Fan with his claw. The enormous Totem Beast stood up in the strait and tossed Qiu Chi like a shot put. The creature slammed into the unused land in Xiamen that was still in the planning phase!

Qiu Chi’s true appearance was finally revealed after it was thrown out of the strait. Even though its limbs were like pillars, its skin sagged like a Chinese shar-pei. Its sides, stomach, and the flesh on its limbs were all sagging in multiple layers, all the moist and sticky layers full of demon leeches.

“No wonder it can hide another monster under it,” Zhang Xiaohou commented after seeing Qiu Chi’s true appearance.

Baxia’s skin was tight and firm, and his muscles were brimming with strength. Meanwhile, Qiu Chi looked odd and strange in comparison. Its back was like a bony mountain, and its rotten flesh and skin were crawling with parasites. Its flesh sagged like an obese old woman!

“It shouldn’t have looked like that before. Perhaps it has spent too much time around these parasites,” Zhao Manyan murmured.

“It’s disgusting and terrifying. Luckily, it didn’t get into the city. Otherwise, the plague and disease it would cause after it is killed would result in many deaths too!” Mo Fan spat.

Baxia forcibly snapped Qiu Chi’s bone whip in half. More Parasitic Steam Locusts poured out of Qiu Chi’s body as the creature lost its temper. The demon leeches started crawling down its body like they were fleeing for their lives!

ROOOOOOOAAAAAAARRRRRR!

Baxia spat out his killing breath when he saw the parasites crawling across the land and the water!

His breath had a pale destructive light. It killed every one of the demon leeches and Parasitic Steam Locusts that were exposed to it. Even Qiu Chi was constantly forced back by it!

Qiu Chi might be furious, but there was nothing it could do to stop Baxia. It began to move itself, trying to return to the support of the water.

The strait was not very deep. It had lands and islands nearby, so Qiu Chi did not have much space to move around. It finally backed away from the strait and returned to the deeper water!

Baxia was from the ocean too, and did not mind fighting in deeper waters. He immediately chased after Qiu Chi as it retreated to the ocean. His steps even created strong waves surging ahead as he pursued Qiu Chi directly!

The waves swept past Qiu Chi and left a few cuts on its wrinkled skin. Its dark green blood immediately spread across the water!

“It’s going to dive underwater!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“Maybe it’s trying to reclaim the upper hand under the water. I won’t be able to follow you guys into the water!” Mo Fan noticed Baxia was submerging too. He decisively jumped back to a stretch of land that was not under water yet. It still had the huge hole that Qiu Chi had smashed into it previously.

“I’ll stick with Baxia. You two should be careful on your way back,” Zhao Manyan said.

Zhao Manyan was worried there might be other parasites helping Qiu Chi after they went underwater. He decided to stick around to help Baxia.

“It’s fine. The rest of the sea monsters can’t really harm us as long as these two creatures are kept at bay!” Mo Fan agreed.
