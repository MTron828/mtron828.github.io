“Ling~” Little Flame Belle cried out happily, telling Mo Fan that she had learned a new ability, and asking him whether he wanted to try it out now.

Mo Fan was surprised. Little Flame Belle had definitely impressed him lately. Considering how diligent she had been, should he spend some money on some Fire Soul Seeds and feed her? Perhaps she would rank up soon?

Little Flame Belle’s thoughts were linked with Mo Fan’s. She could easily shape her flames as Mo Fan wanted to.

The Calamity Fire gradually moved to Mo Fan’s back and seemed to take the shape of feathers. More fiery feathers gradually took shape, resembling a pair of wings...

“Isn’t this the Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers?” Mo Fan asked with a confused look when he saw the fiery wings.

Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers was the move that Mo Fan had used quite a few times in the past. He could fire the fiery feathers at will, detonating them at the right time to deal spectacular damage to his target. The move was stronger than the Fire Sword. However, it was more efficient against enormous creatures or a group of demon creatures. In terms of damage output, the Fire Sword had a slight edge still.

-Wasn’t this supposed to be a new move?-

Mo Fan was still wondering what was going on when the fiery wings extended out and waved backward!

As the blazing red wings waved, every feather exploded and sent the unprepared Mo Fan flying ahead like a rocket!

Mo Fan rapidly barrelled ahead while staying close to the ice. His flame-shrouded figure was basically a burning missile ramming at the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast.

“AHHHHH!” Mo Fan was totally unprepared for it. It felt like he was wearing a jet pack that had accumulated lots of energy on his back. The wind was hitting him hard on the face, even the muscles on his face began to distort.

“Can...can you please give your dad... a heads-up!? AHHHHH!”

Mo Fan slammed into the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s stomach. Luckily, he was covered in layers of the Rose Flame and Calamity Fire, which protected him from the impact. Otherwise, he would have smashed himself to pieces from the force of crashing into the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast’s armor at such speed, without dealing any damage to it!

“What...what is he doing?” Hirose stared at Mo Fan blankly.

To be honest, Mo Fan looked extremely cool when he was blasting forward like a missile, but what was he thinking, trying to ram his head into a Commander-level creature?

“Meow!” The Night Rakshasa had already raised her claws, but her confidence in Mo Fan dropped rapidly after seeing his approach. The translation for her cry was, “Holy shit, is he retarded!?”

Even the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast was stunned. Its confused look totally implied that it had no idea what the human was up to.

Luckily, the surprise stopped the Blue Valley Ferocious Beast from attacking. Mo Fan quickly used the Fleeing Shadow to withdraw fifty meters away. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The Blue Valley Ferocious Beast assumed that the human was treating it like a fool. It raised its legs and attacked ferociously.

The first stab landed on Mo Fan’s fake shadow. The second stab quickly followed, aiming at Mo Fan’s head.

Mo Fan reacted by crouching down. A cold breeze swept past above his head. His hair was suddenly parted in the middle, with a few strands falling slowly to the ground.

Another stab approached once again. Mo Fan had an uneasy feeling, as he had no idea how to evade it.

In the nick of time, an ice chain wrapped around his waist from behind. Mo Fan’s skidded on his butt across the ice as he was dragged away by the ice chain. The ice was not perfectly flat, hence his rear was getting abused in the process.

However, when he saw two sharpened legs stabbing through his previous location, he completely forgot about the pain as his heart skipped a beat.

“Can you be a bit more reliable!?” Mu Ningxue was so angry that she simply had the urge to toss the guy into the creature’s mouth.

“(cough cough) That was a mistake, please give me another chance...” Mo Fan felt extremely awkward.

Mu Ningxue loosened the ice chain, giving Mo Fan back his freedom.

“My beloved daughter, please don’t play me like that. The skill is impressive, it can give me a great boost in terms of speed, but it doesn’t really do much unless you use it together with my Fiery Fist, or you can summon the Fire Sword too...” Mo Fan did not dare to condemn Little Flame Belle, and spoke to her gently.

Little Flame Belle had a fragile heart, like a little baby. If his tone was slightly heavier, the kid would threaten to run away from home.

Little Flame Belle realized that trying out a new ability in a fight like this was most likely not the best idea, yet against the Commander-level creature, their old moves were not so effective, either.

“Can you still produced the burning feathers?” asked Mo Fan.

“Ling!~” Little Flame Belle nodded and told Mo Fan that the wings could accelerate two times in total. However, the number of times would increase as his cultivation continued to improve.

Mo Fan basically understood the concept of the new ability.

The Thousand Fiery Feathers were flames in the shape of feathers. When the feathers reached a certain number, they resembled a pair of fiery wings.

However, the wings did not grant Mo Fan the ability to fly, and the fiery feathers mostly served as an offensive ability. The fiery feathers would explode upon collision, and the greater the number of fiery feathers, the stronger the attack would be.

Meanwhile, the new fiery feathers were basically an improved version of the Thousand Fiery Feathers. They would form a pair of wings on his back, and as the wings beat, they would detonate a portion of the fiery feathers. The sudden burst would then rocket the user along, giving him or Little Flame Belle a shocking speed boost!

The ability was handy when attacking the enemy or running away from a fight. Mo Fan was pretty happy about it, yet it was obvious that it still needed some optimization!

The fiery wings on his back did not disappear. However, Mo Fan did not use the Fiery Jet Wings ruthlessly this time. He needed to figure out what spell would be the best to combine with the new move, and how he was going to run away to a safe distance after landing a hit. His Black Snake Armor was already torn open by the previous slash, which had significantly reduced its duration.
