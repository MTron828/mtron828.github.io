“Luo Mian... It seems like you’re hiding lots of things from me?” Councilman Zhu Meng seemed to be aware of something. His eyes fixed on Councilman Luo Mian.

Councilman Luo Mian continued to wear a smile. There was hardly any sign of fear on his face. “We’ll settle it later, but right now we have more urgent matters on hand. Our enemies are right before us, should we waste our time further with infighting?”

General Yun Feng nodded. “The army of White Magic Falcons will arrive at our line of defense in two hours. Our defense can mostly hold on for another three hours before they break through and invade Hangzhou City. We have five hours left to either stop the invasion of the White Magic Falcons, or eliminate the Ruler-level demon beast!”

“Precisely!” Councilman Luo Mian quickly nodded, as if he were afraid that someone else would bring up the blood serums again.

Leng Qing stepped forward and said, “If the White Magic Falcons are invading because of the plague, I believe that our first priority is to find the cure to the plague instead. The White Magic Falcons will lose their targets, and it would be easier for us to drive them back.”

“It sounds like you’ve already found the cure to the plague?” said Councilman Luo Mian with a weird grin.

“That’s true. Even Mr. Lu was clueless about how to deal with the plague. How could we possibly find the cure within five hours to resolve the situation?”

“We’ve already found out what the antidote is. It’s a special type of herb which only grows on West Ridge, the Red Falcon Herb. If we could pluck some of them, we can quickly find a cure for the infected,” said Leng Qing.

The crowd immediately focused on Leng Qing, especially Councilman Zhu Meng. His eyes flickered with excitement as he blurted out, “Are you sure that the Red Falcon Herb is the cure for the disease?”

Leng Qing nodded, “Absolutely.”

“Hehe, let’s say the Red Falcon Herb could possibly be the cure for the plague, how can we possibly set foot on West Ridge in the current situation? It’s roosting place for the White Magic Falcons. Are you stupid enough to assume that it’s safe because the White Magic Falcons have all moved out to invade us? Even a battalion would have trouble reaching there in one piece. Do you seriously think we have extra men to spend on such ridiculous speculation?” Councilman Luo Mian laughed grimly.

Leng Qing and the Elder of the Magic Court, Li Tian glared at the gloating Councilman Luo Mian, especially the former, who swore heavily in her heart that she would send him into jail right away after the situation was resolved.

The crowd frowned too. They finally found the solution to the plague, which would also stop the invasion of the White Magic Falcons, but it turned out to be at the most dangerous place.

“Right, the White Magic Falcons are the same species as the Heavenly Eagles. Normally, the White Magic Falcons won’t attack a Heavenly Eagle. If we could send one Heavenly Eagle to sneak into West Ridge and retrieve the Red Falcon Herbs, can’t we easily solve the problem?” General Yun Feng blurted out.

Commander Ming Kuo, who was standing beside General Yun Feng quickly whispered into his ear, “General, you forgot that you ordered all the Heavenly Eagles to be killed...”

General Yun Feng pulled a long face and glared at the Commander, as if he were trying to say “Thanks, but no thanks for the reminder”...

Not a single Heavenly Eagle could be found in the fortress. Even if there were one, it would have turned rebellious due to the presence of the Ruler-level falcon. How could a Heavenly Eagle possibly sneak into West Ridge?

The meeting room soon fell into dead silence, as none of them could come up with a plausible plan to resolve the crisis. Suddenly, a young man barged into the room from the door and slammed into the table. Two infuriated soldiers immediately came in, trying to throw him out of the room. The young man screamed at the top of his lungs, “I have a way to retrieve the Red Falcon Herbs! I have a way to get the antidote!”

General Yun Feng glanced at the kid and snapped, “Where did this brat come from? Drag him out and punish him with the discipline stick.”

“We’re having an important meeting here. Why is a kid allowed to barge in?!” Councilman Luo Mian snapped.

“Wait, this young man helped us to determine the source of the plague. Let’s listen to what he’s trying to say,” interrupted Leng Qing.

“Let him speak, then,” said the Elder of the Magic Court, Li Tian.

Councilman Luo Mian burst into laughter. “I thought I’m only here to discuss how we’re going deal with the situation, and yet not only were you falsely accusing me, you are suggesting that we should listen to a kid. If that’s how useless you are, I will not waste my time further here.”

Councilman Luo Mian rose from his seat and left the room, as if he had nothing to do with the matters on hand.

The people exchanged glances with one another, not knowing what to do.

Leng Qing asked Wang Xiaojun patiently, “You mentioned that you have a way to retrieve the Red Falcon Herbs. What is it?”

Mo Fan and Lingling, who were previously waiting outside of the room with Wang Xiaojun, had entered the room too. Mo Fan was keen to know what he had in mind that would allow them to retrieve the Red Falcon Herbs from the White Magic Falcons’ nests. As Councilman Luo Mian had mentioned, they would need a team of elites to reach West Ridge.

Wang Xiaojun glanced at the authoritative figures whom he had no chance of meeting in his daily life. Despite feeling slightly intimidated, he cleared his throat and said, “There’s still a Heavenly Eagle left in the fortress! He listens to my orders. I’ll ride him to sneak into West Ridge to retrieve the Red Falcon Herbs. I’m the most familiar with him.”

Commander Ming Kuo yelled, “Didn’t we order all Heavenly Eagles executed? Why would you still have one!”

“I disobeyed the order and let the Heavenly Eagle that I raised since I was young go,” replied Wang Xiaojun in a soft voice.

General Yun Feng’s eyes flickered. He had disobeyed the order at the perfect time!

However, the Commander frowned and shook his head, “It’s useless. We’ve lost control of the Heavenly Eagles because of the Ruler-level Falcon. We’re fortunate enough that they didn’t attack us. How could he obey your order still?”

As if he were scared that the soldiers would throw him out of the room, Wang Xiaojun blurted out, “My Heavenly Eagle has a mixed lineage. His plumage is gray, so I can’t really tell what breed he is. I tried to contact him yesterday and managed to get a response, as I thought he was also controlled by the Ruler-level demon beast. However, he actually came to me after the summon, which indicates that he is not under the control of the Ruler-lever demon beast.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
