3024 Twin Tyrant Titans

“You’re crazy. Everyone from the Black Vatican is crazy!” the Hall Mother, Pamise, yelled angrily.

The black-striped flames hit the barrier of the knights. Many Golden Sun Knights fainted under the terrifying impact.

After they fell, their armor turned red. Then, black flames burned inside their armors and quickly devoured their bodies.

Crowds of people were on the road, and countless pairs of eyes were watching those Golden Sun Knights. Even though these knights were inside the silver-blue barrier, the flames still burned them to death. If the black flames of the sun fell directly into the city or among the crowd, the consequences would be even more devastating.

People panicked and wanted to find some buildings to take shelter. However, what hung in the sky was a scorching sun. Its brilliance and flames were enough to cover the entire Athens. No matter where they hid, it didn’t matter.

They were just celebrating a festival but now it turned into the start of a doomsday.

“Haylon!” Ye Xinxia looked for Haylon, the Lord of the Hall of Knights.

At this time, Haylon was leading all the Knights of the Seal to hunt down the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan. However, the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan was too powerful. The black-striped flames it spewed that fell from the sky was huge and fiery. Haylon and the knights could not get close to the Golden Sun Tyrant Titan.

“Your Highness, we can’t get close to it. It is a ten-thousand-year-old giant ancient god,” Haylon said to Ye Xinxia.

“I’ll bestow you holy water for meditation.” Ye Xinxia recited the spell. After realizing the seriousness of the matter, she activated the Divine Soul’s power.

The blessing of the Divine Soul could strengthen Ye Xinxia’s White Magic by many times. The blue-gray seal of the water armor appeared on Haylon and the other knights, protecting them from the black-striped flames.

Haylon and the knights finally had a chance to fly high into the sky. They were determined not to let Golden Sun Tyrant Titan attack the city again. With its destructive power, it could kill thousands of people in no time. People had gathered at the election altar only to celebrate the Flower Festival.

Hawk! Hawk!

To the west of Athens, two silver faces suddenly appeared on Aigaleo Mountain. Then, a hand as big as the mountain grabbed the undulating ridge, and a terrifying silver giant jumped from the other side of the mountain to the urban area like a hurdler before everyone’s eyes.

They were Silver Moon Tyrant Titans. They were so big that they looked like a mountain slowly approaching the city. Athens, even with its tall buildings, was only like a toy city in front of it.

“Twin Tyrant Titans!”

Izisha looked in the direction of Aigaleo Mountain and saw the two ancient titans.

There was no difference in their appearance or bodies. Their only difference was the ancient divine objects they held. The Twin Tyrant Titan on the left was holding a Silver Peak Spear. To lift it, the Titan had to hold it with both hands. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The Twin Tyrant Titan on the right was holding the silver mountain thorn shield. The shield was as thick as a rock fortress. Besides, it was covered in thorns, making it look like a shield full of swords and spears.

These two Titans were equally shocking. They rapidly approached from the west of the city, and the places they stepped on continued to sink. Even the roads on the outskirts of the city had sunk!

Suddenly, the Twin Tyrant Titan threw the Silver Peak Spear. The blue sky was densely covered with black clouds after the Silver Peak Spear passed by. There were countless lightning bolts which entangled on the flying Silver Peak Spear. The Silver Peak Spear turned into a thunderous spear and fell onto Athens!

Buzz…

The Silver Peak Spear pierced obliquely into the densely packed buildings, and the large buildings instantly turned to dust. The white lightning circles swept across the ground, and the packed crowd instantly turned into white mist.

People could not even scream, and there were no corpses.

This Silver Peak Spear pierced through the barrier, and its destructive power was astonishing. Ordinary citizens could not withstand such power. Even the group of Mages was easily defeated!

“Adjudicators, follow me to the west!” Izisha’s eyes were bloodshot when she saw this.

The barrier did not work on the Silver Peak Spear, which meant that the Twin Tyrant Titans could slaughter people in the city at will. Izisha was aware of the threat of this monster.

Adjudicators of the Hall of Judgment wore uniform armor and moved toward the west. Izisha was flying over the city. She rushed toward the Silver Peak Spear that continued to release white lightning circles at the city.

Izisha was radiant. When she approached the white lightning circles, pieces of war scales appeared from the void, fully arming her.

Izisha suppressed the white lightning circles after she arrived, but the Silver Peak Spear suddenly trembled, as if it had heard its master’s call. The Silver Peak Spear, which was like an iron tower, left the ground and quickly flew to the Twin Tyrant Titans.

Izisha was fearless. She stepped on the Silver Peak Spear that pierced through the air and attacked the mountain-like Twin Tyrant Titans with her tiny body. The adjudicators behind her could not even catch up with her speed.

The red light was shining. It was impossible to see Izisha from a distance. They could only see the gigantic Silver Moon Titan standing at the far end of the city. The Silver Moon Titan let out a roar, which pushed the Silver Peak Spear hundreds of meters away. The spear fell and crushed a mountainous area outside the city.

“Use dimensional hopping. We cannot let those two giant Titans get close to the densely populated areas of the city!” shouted the Lord of the Hall of Judgment.

“Be careful! The black-striped flames are falling!”

“Move away! That is not the black-striped flames. It is the palm of Apollo!”

“Ah!”

A group of knights and Adjudicators screamed in mid-air. When people looked up, they saw a hand of the Titan covered in black flames holding a group of Mages!

They were squeezed like earthworms while suffering from the attack of the black-striped flames.
