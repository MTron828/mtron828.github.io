Mo Fan immediately realized why Mu Ningxue was uneasy and tried to run away when the little cub​ asked for a hug.

The little Tianshan Scar Ice Spirit must have been extremely fond of Mu Ningxue’s Aura, similar to the little cub. The little cub had reminded her of the grave mistake she made when she was lost in her obsessions.

“I...” Mu Ningxue was emotionally stirred at the mention of the topic.

After all, it was the first newborn who crossed paths with Mu Ningxue. She blamed herself for what she had done and was struggling to walk out of the pain.

The premature death of the Tianshan Scar Ice Spirit was sealed away at the bottom of Mu Ningxue’s heart, together with her Third Element.

“You shouldn’t blame yourself too much. I believe the Ice Spirit would still choose to sign a Contract with you if she was given a second chance. She wanted to share the pain with you. Your souls were connected briefly before the Contract was signed. She was aware of the risk involved, she just lacked a little luck. If she made it, your Third Element should work too. I think the little cub is pretty tough. Do you want to try it again?” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan assumed the little cub possessed an outstanding lineage, even among the species of the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. Mu Ningxue’s Innate Ice Magic was not as terrifying as Qin Yu’er’s. The little cub should be fine if Mu Ningxue signed a Contract with her. Mu Ningxue would then be able to cultivate the Summoning Element!

If the little cub did not make it, it was not their fault, either. They did not force her to sign a Contract with Mu Ningxue. It was she that kept jumping into Mu Ningxue’s arms because she was particularly attracted to her.

“You are after the Night Amethyst, right?” Mu Ningxue had a feeling Mo Fan had some ulterior motives.

“No, am I the kind of person that would do anything to achieve my goals?” Mo Fan denied awkwardly.

“Let’s not try it. Qin Yu’er used her power to seal the Tianshan Scar Ice Spirit’s soul in a leaf. She made a protective talisman with it that can protect me from danger,” Mu Ningxue said.

Mo Fan glanced at Mu Ningxue’s neck and saw an amulet resembling a leaf. He had never noticed it before, perhaps because Mu Ningxue was quite busty.

“Such a pity, you are missing your Third Element... what about your Fourth Element?” Mo Fan asked after he realized something.

Mu Ningxue was now a Super Mage. She could have Awakened her Fourth Element too! Mo Fan was worried that her Fourth Element had encountered the same problem too. If so, it would put Mu Ningxue at a great disadvantage.

“I...I feel very lost too,” Mu Ningxue’s pupils were unfocused.

Mu Ningxue was uneasy about Awakening a new Element after what happened to her third Element. She had yet to Awaken her fourth Element. She was afraid that it might share the same fate.

After reaching the Super Level, Mu Ningxue did not struggle to take on people with only one or two Elements at the Super Level. Her outstanding Ice Element granted her an edge over others.

However, how was she going to fight those with three or four Elements in the Super Level?

Every Element would have its bottleneck. If her cultivation was stuck, focusing on other Elements was an effective way to push her main Elements’ cultivation too! However, if Mu Ningxue only had two Elements, her cultivation would be stuck in the middle of the Super Level. She would struggle to achieve higher levels!

Mu Ningxue was still quite young. She had a great chance to achieve the Super Level for all her Elements, and even became a Forbidden Mage!

It would be terrible if her cultivation was stuck because she only had two Elements!

Mu Ningxue had tagged along on the expedition because the cultivation of her Ice Element had been stuck for some time.

Her cultivation was supposed to improve significantly after she obtained more Fundamental Crystals of the Ice Element, because of the Ice Crystal Bow’s powerful traits.

However, her cultivation stopped improving. Mu Ningxue realized the thing she worried about the most had happened. Her cultivation had stopped improving because it lacked the push from other Elements!

“You didn’t dare to awaken the fourth Element, right?” Mo Fan said.

“Mm,” Mu Ningxue nodded.

“It’s even more a reason you should untie the knot of your third Element,” Mo Fan pointed out.

If Mu Ningxue did not get over her third Element, her fear and worry might cause the awakening of her fourth Element to fail too. Every Mage only had one attempt at Awakening new Elements. If she failed, she would never obtain a new Element! Mo Fan understood the reason why Mu Ningxue did not dare Awaken the fourth Element, but the main problem was still her third Element.

If Mu Ningxue was unable to Awaken new Elements, she would not have Awakened the Summoning Element as her third Element. There was no way she would have been able to sign a Contract with the Ice Spirit.

“I believe there are certain odds to signing the Contract. The weaker creatures are unable to endure the power of your Ice Magic, but the stronger ones should be fine. In the end, you still need to establish a Contract to unblock your Summoning Element so you can Awaken the fourth Element,” Mo Fan declared after analyzing the situation.

“Qin Yu’er told me the same thing, but I want to try another way, like the Tianshan Dew...” Mu Ningxue said with a troubled face. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She did not want a little creature that she built a relationship with to die because of her. It was like losing someone close to her.

“What’s the Tianshan Dew?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“It’s the dew from the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. It will never freeze. Ice Magic keeps freezing my body and my soul, but the Tianshan Dew can protect my soul, so it will stop the Ice Magic from harming my Contracted Beast,” Mu Ningxue said.

“We don’t even know where to look for the Tianshan Sacred Lotus... Maybe you should really try doing it with the little cub. She’s more than willing to let you place a seal on her,” Mo Fan tried to convince Mu Ningxue.

“I would rather stick to two Elements,” Mu Ningxue refuted him.

She did not want to take the risk. Besides, she was not fond of the little cub. If she wanted to sign a Contract again, she would still choose the Tianshan Scar Ice Spirit.

“(Sigh), why don’t I give you two of my Elements. I have too many of them. I can’t take care of them myself,” Mo Fan teased her.

There were only seven Calabash Brothers, yet he had eight Elements to water and fertilize!

“I’m not interested in your Elements!” Mu Ningxue huffed.

“Seriously? You aren’t interested in any of them?” Mo Fan said with a wry smile. He was shunned even when he tried to sacrifice his Elements!

“No.”

“Fine, let’s keep going. We’ll find the Tianshan Sacred Lotus!” Mo Fan promised.
