Beiyu Mountain...

A skinny man with a long chin stood at the top of the mountain. He was holding some small objects in his hands while staring at the fire in the brazier. He slowly placed the objects into the fire, letting the flames devour them slowly.

A probationary member of the Enforcement Union came up to Lu Zhantian with a phone. “The Councilman is calling.”

“Put it close to my ear,” Lu Zhantian said calmly. He was still putting the objects into the brazier.

The woman slowly knelt down and bent forward. Unfortunately, Lu Zhantian did not show any interest even though she was purposely doing it to seduce him.

“Father, are you not satisfied with my arrangements?” Lu Zhantian asked.

“You’re only going to bring more troubles to us. Mo Fan is no longer the same. Even though he has yet to join any faction, do you have any idea how many authorities are watching him in the dark? You are being too impatient!” Councilman Lu Xin snapped.

“I didn’t do anything that will get us in trouble. I have followed the right protocols. Is our Lu Clan seriously that weak that we have to worry about offending someone when we are just questioning a suspect?” Lu Zhantian threw the last belongings of his younger brother into the fire. He had the urge to destroy the fire. “I already promised that I was going to kill him when I heard the news, but you all said that it was not the right time. I chose to listen to you and waited until the end of the World College Tournament. It was over a long time ago, yet that asshole that killed my beloved brother and your son is still living as he pleases! Father, do you have any idea how many vultures were eating his remains when I went to retrieve his corpse!?”

Lu Zhantian was extremely angry. He stared at the brazier. The flames there suddenly surged wildly and spread out.

“I am as angry as you are, and I promise you that I will never forgive him, but what you are doing is not going to help. From what I know, that guy is a lunatic...” Lu Xin began.

“Our conversation ends here. You have been worrying too much since the day you claimed your high position,” Lu Zhantian replied.

The flames surged wildly and burned the remnants to ashes. Lu Zhantian checked the time and slowly rose to his feet. He said to the probationary member of the Enforcement Union, “It’s about time. Ask my men to gather at the base of the mountain. I can’t wait to see if the kid has three heads and six arms!”

——

Lu Zhantian went down to the mountain’s base. There were at least twenty members of the Enforcement Union with him, including a man whose face was half-masked with a monstrous presence.

Feng Jinglan, a Vice Leader of the Enforcement Union, frowned and looked at Lu Zhantian confusedly, “Leader, is there any reason you have summoned us here?”

“Nothing really, it’s just a safety precaution against someone that dares to look down the Beiyu Enforcement Union and stop us from serving justice...” Lu Zhantian said.

Feng Jinglan was even more confused. He was about to ask further when he saw an envoy of the Enforcement Union approaching them with a dark face. The man seemed quite angry.

“Nighthawk?” Feng Jinglan asked in confusion.

“Lu Zhantian, do you have any idea what you are doing!?” Nighthawk snapped coldly.

“You have no right to point your finger at me, I am the Leader of the Beiyu Enforcement Union, be off with you!” Lu Zhantian said.

“You are playing with fire! You are abusing your power for personal matters!”

“I am not,” Lu Zhantian laughed disdainfully.

“You should let Mo Fan’s father go before things go south,” Nighthawk swore furiously.

“He is a suspect, so I brought him here to interrogate him for a few days! There’s nothing wrong about it. Once I’m done interrogating him, clearing both his and someone else’s name, I will surely escort him back safely. I know Mo Fan is bright like the sun at high noon, but it doesn’t mean I have to lower my voice when talking to him while I’m interrogating him, especially when I’m a Leader of the Enforcement Union, right?” Lu Zhantian replied with a toothy smile.

“You have no right to take his father away!” Nighthawk hissed.

“Of course I do,” Lu Zhantian glanced at the half-masked man. The truth was, his hands were tied with a pair of silver handcuffs enhanced with dark sealing magic. It was the same method that the Enforcement Union used to seal the minds of their prisoners.

“He was once a Black Clergy of the Black Vatican, but he has turned over a new leaf and sworn loyalty to the Beiyu Enforcement Union instead. He is helping us hunt the members of the Black Vatican. I have already submitted a request to the higher-ups, and a Councilman has approved my request. The man told me that Great Deacon Hu Jin, Mu He, had initiated contact with Mo Fan’s father, Mo Jiaxin. As such, I can’t help but suspect that Mo Jiaxin was a member of the Black Vatican, even though his son is one of the main contributors to wiping out the Black Vatican. I believe the man might provide me with some useful information. After all, the person that Mo Jiaxin contacted might be Salan, the Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican! Nighthawk, do I now have a reason to interrogate him?” Lu Zhantian looked at Nighthawk with a disdainful grin.

The Enforcement Union had yet to find any useful information on Salan, but he might have a chance of learning Salan’s past, and if it was somehow related to Mo Fan’s father. It was a piece of great news to him. Not only would he be able to make worthy contributions to the Enforcement Union, he could also get his revenge on Mo Fan!

“Then why did I hear that someone is using his father to threaten Mo Fan!?” Nighthawk said.

“Threaten? I only asked him to tell Mo Fan that his father is in our hands, how is that threatening?” Lu Zhantian pointed at Yu Ang.

Nighthawk’s face darkened immediately. As the man in charge of the operation to wipe out the Black Vatican in the Magic City, Nighthawk clearly knew who Yu Ang was! “Don’t tell me you have no idea of the history between him and Mo Fan. You’re provoking him on purpose!” Nighthawk said.

“Nighthawk, I’m afraid you are thinking too much. I knew Yu Ang and Mo Fan were old acquaintances, and since Yu Ang has turned over a new leaf, I believed it was necessary for him to contact Mo Fan. I’ll mediate between them so the two can resolve their conflict peacefully. After all, Yu Ang is going to help us to find the members of the Black Vatican,” Lu Zhantian replied smoothly.

Nighthawk could feel his chest burning with rage after hearing Lu Zhantian’s excuse. Lu Zhantian was clearly setting up a trap for Mo Fan!

Nighthawk was aware that the Beiyu Enforcement Union had caught Yu Ang and was using him to hunt down the members of the Black Vatican. He initially thought Lu Zhantian would focus on taking out the Black Vatican, yet it turned out that the man was trying to use Yu Ang and his hatred against Mo Fan to avenge his brother, Lu Yilin!

Many people knew Mo Fan had indirectly killed Lu Yilin in Peru for trying to set him up. The Lu Clan was obviously not going to forgive Mo Fan for that, but the man had won the World College Tournament for the country. As such, the Lu Clan was hesitant to make a move. To their surprise, Lu Zhantian insisted on taking matters into his own hands. He insisted on killing Mo Fan to avenge his brother!

“I want to see Mo Jiaxin! I want to know if you have done anything to him!” Nighthawk said.

“He’s perfectly fine. I will take full responsibility for it, so don’t you worry. Nighthawk, I am the Leader of the Enforcement Union, you have no right to order me around, do you understand?” Lu Zhantian emphasized.

“You...you...” Nighthawk was so angry that he was lost for words.

He could easily tell what Lu Zhantian was up to, judging by the members of the Enforcement Union he had gathered. He only hoped that Mo Fan could stay calm, as Mo Jiaxin was still fine. He could only hope Lu Zhantian was not bold enough to harm his father.

“He’s here!” Yu Ang exclaimed. He seemed quite excited.

He finally had the chance to drive Mo Fan mad. He had waited a long time for this day!

Nighthawk glanced down the slope and saw Mo Fan arriving with a westerner dressed in strange clothes. He could immediately see the murderous look in Mo Fan’s eyes!

Nighthawk quickly went up to Mo Fan. “Mo Fan, stay calm. Give me a day, I promise you I will force Lu Zhantian to let your father go.” All he could do was to advise Mo Fan to not do anything recklessly.

The Beiyu Enforcement Union was a powerful organization. If anyone used violence, they had the right to execute the person on the spot. Lu Zhantian was trying to provoke Mo Fan with Yu Ang’s help so he would attack them recklessly. When that happened, Lu Zhantian would have an excuse for executing him on the spot!

The members of the Enforcement Union that were present could testify that it was Mo Fan who attacked first, and that he had broken the law first.

“Nighthawk, I know that,” Mo Fan replied to him coldly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s a relief, I was worried that you were going to do something reckless. Don’t let these idiots provoke you. Stay calm, I promise you that I won’t let them harm your father,” Nighthawk said seriously.

“The man is perfectly well, but you know, Yu Ang was once a member of the Black Vatican. I will place him in charge of the interrogation... after all, he knows your father too,” Lu Zhantian called out.

Yu Ang burst out laughing too. His eyes squinted viciously as he watched Mo Fan’s face closely. He could not wait to see Mo Fan lose his calm and pounce at them like a mad hound. Everything would then go according to their plan!

“Yu Ang is still a prisoner. The Enforcement Union is only using him to hunt down the remaining members of the Black Vatican...” Nighthawk explained. He did not want Mo Fan to misunderstand that the Enforcement Union had colluded with Yu Ang.

“I know that too,” Mo Fan replied.

Lingling had told him the whole thing. He already knew it was a trap.

However, that did not mean Mo Fan would endure it!

There was no way he would endure the things that had crossed his bottom line! These people had crossed two lines in his heart!

First, threatening him with his father!

Second, what happened to Xu Zhaoting had been constantly gnawing at Mo Fan. It did not matter if Yu Ang had turned over a new leaf, or how willing he was to help the Enforcement Union. As soon as Mo Fan knew where the man was, he had sworn to behead the man himself!

Some people were just unforgivable!
