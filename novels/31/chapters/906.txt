Mo Fan still remembered his first impression of Liu Ru. It was in a little coffee shop in an alleyway in Shanghai. Despite the nightmare she was going through, her rather sallow face still had a friendly smile, highlighting the strong will behind her delicate appearance.

However, Liu Ru’s temperament had changed thoroughly. She was no longer a young, innocent girl. The long red coat set off her slender figure, granting her an alluring charm, while the vague dark aura surrounding her made her slightly mysterious.

However, the smile on Liu Ru’s face was always naive when she saw Mo Fan. It was like a girl next door, who would always act shyly in front of the elder brother next door no matter how experienced she was in society.

Mo Fan simply could not find any word to describe it. He stared at Liu Ru, exclaiming, “You really... changed a lot!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“You think so?” Liu Ru was incredibly happy. She seemed to be excited to show him something.

At the same time, she casually waved her hand to the side. Her blood claws swept past like five sharp swords, and beheaded five of the Dark Beast Monsters that were trying to ambush her.

Mo Fan’s lips twisted. He could not find any word to describe the contradictory scene. It was like a helpless young woman was screaming out “Yameteh!” while sending a monster flying with a roundhouse kick.

“Mo Fan, Mo Fan, hurry up and eliminate the queen! It looks like it’s about to evolve to the next stage. When that happens, the effect is going to spread outside of the ranches!” Lingling’s voice burst out from the communication device.

Mo Fan did not have time to catch up with Liu Ru. Judging from her outstanding performance, she must have evolved into a stronger Blood Tribe member!

She arrived with perfect timing, too! He would have had trouble clearing a path to the Slanted Hall on his own.

“I’m going to approach them directly. You have to find the queen of the poisonous worms. Otherwise, we are all in great trouble!” Mo Fan told Liu Ru.

Liu Ru also knew they were in an emergency situation, thus she did not waste any time further. Knowing that most of the Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts were dead, she immediately flung her coat and disappeared into a red mist.

Liu Ru beat her furred wings and flew in the direction of the Slanted Hall under Lingling’s direction, searching for the queen.

The remaining members of the Black Vatican could no longer hold their ground. They started fleeing toward the Slanted Hall. Mo Fan strode forward and blasted the heavy entrance of the Slanted Hall to pieces.

—

The Slanted Hall was an underground palace. As soon as Mo Fan barged in, he immediately saw a tawny-haired woman in heels sitting in the center. Her heels were stained with blood. She looked quite ordinary, yet she was covered in an eerie, seductive aura!

She was cold-blooded, proud, and wearing revealing clothes.

Her left hand was on her leg. Her right hand was being licked by a feminine man. She was not bothered by the countless deaths outside of the Slanted Hall. However, a charming smile appeared on her face when she saw Mo Fan barging in...

“I know who you are,” Fang Shaoli stared at Mo Fan with squinting eyes.

“Oh?” Mo Fan glimpsed the disciples and Gray Priests and saw them withdrawing to Fang Shaoli’s side, including the remaining Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts.

“You’re Mo Fan from Bo City, someone that keeps causing trouble to our organization!” Fang Shaoli’s eyes flickered sharply.

“Everyone likes to call me the Black Vatican’s Terminator,” replied Mo Fan.

“You’ve overestimated yourself. If we really wanted to get rid of you, you wouldn’t live for more than a few days. You’re still alive because no one thought a little shrimp like you would cause us so much trouble,” sniffed Fang Shaoli.

“I remembered that the person who insulted me the same way was a guy called Mu He. Isn’t he a leader of the Blue Deacons? He died a pretty horrible death. Apparently, it was Salan that killed him out of frustration. A little Blue Deacon like you isn’t even an authority in the Black Vatican, right?” mocked Mo Fan in return.

Mo Fan was a fan of quarreling. Besides, it helped earn Liu Ru more time!

Fang Shaoli did not seem bothered. She pushed the feminine man away, slowly took off her earring and chucked it at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan had no clue what the woman was up to. He had no intention to pick up the earring that fell beside his feet.

“It’s a communication device. Aren’t you curious who’s on the other side?” said Fang Shaoli in a challenging manner.

Mo Fan picked up the earring and did indeed hear a voice coming out of it. Mo Fan placed it close to his ear and immediately heard a calm, relaxed breathing.

Across the sea, in a luxurious mansion standing opposite a waterfall, a person in a long red robe was standing on a balcony that extended out from the structure. Her golden hair was wet from the water vapor from the waterfall...

Her robe was long enough to be dragged half a meter across the floor, yet it was drifting wildly in the breeze from the waterfall!

She was silent for a moment, before she finally said, “Who do you think I am?”

—-

Back in the Slanted Hall, Mo Fan’s face darkened when he heard the voice.

For some reason, perhaps instinct, Mo Fan was confident that the person talking to him was none other than the God of Death that had shocked the entire world: Salan!

It must be her!

“You’re Ling Xi, and you’re Salan too. Such a pity, if we actually stuck to the plan, you wouldn’t even be alive now!” answered Mo Fan.

Han Ji and the mysterious man were right. It was their only chance, so close to catching Salan, and the only chance to kill her. However, Mu He’s intervention allowed her to escape!

“I will die, but Salan won’t. Salan is just a name, a symbol of death. Anyone that spreads evil like a plague can be called Salan. However, among the people that inherited the name, I turned out to be the most brilliant,” replied Salan.

“I didn’t study much, so I don’t understand what you’re saying. If there isn’t anything else, I’m going to hang up the call. I still have to slaughter your subordinate that is pretending to be alluring even though her face is only average,” answered Mo Fan.

“Are you scared of me?”

“Not really, it’s just that I’m not used to chatting like this. Why don’t we decide a time and a place, and we can sit down and chat slowly?” Mo Fan asked blandly.

“Sure, but the place you choose is most likely going to have lots of people of the Enforcement Union waiting for me, so you should let me choose instead...” mused Salan.

“Forget it, you’re too insincere!” replied Mo Fan.

“It’s fine, you will see me eventually, hopefully you will still recognize me. Fang Shaoli is my student. The Sudden-Death Poison Queen is a nice toy that I’ve prepared for her. Both the creature and she will receive you warmly tonight. Of course, It would be better if you can come out of there in one piece, so I can repay you the favor of all the troubles you’ve caused me, one by one!

“You have to live longer. Otherwise, I can only ask the people around you to pay your debt...”
