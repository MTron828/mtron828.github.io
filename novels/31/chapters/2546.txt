Emperors...

So everyone was treating Su Lu as the Asia Magic Association’s emperor.

It was ridiculous, yet real. Otherwise, why would Su Lu dare to kill an Archangel in front of the whole city?

Even emperors made mistakes...

Mo Fan did not expect a Forbidden Mage to be enslaved by his own thoughts!

“It’s meaningless for me to say anything more. If you take another step forward, I have no choice but to erase you from this world!” The sorry look in the Forbidden Mage’s eyes was replaced with coldness.

Mo Fan retained his cold grin. He stood there, waiting for the Forbidden Mage to make his move.

Not every Forbidden Mage had the power to complete a Forbidden Curse by themselves. Besides, was a Forbidden Curse enough to kill him?

The Forbidden Mage did not bother probing Mo Fan. If Mo Fan was able to kill so many High Seaters and Top Seaters of the Dubai Tower so easily, it was obvious that his strength was no longer at the Super Level.

“Xi Zhe, is that kid still alive? Why can I still hear his voice? Why are Karun, Nido, and so many others dead?” the would-be emperor’s voice came from above.

The thick clouds had split the area into zones. The magnificent cliffs had grown from the bottom layer to an even greater height.

“There’s been a little accident. The young man is hiding an evil power inside him. The others underestimated him, but don’t you worry, I’ll take care of him,” Xi Zhe answered Su Lu’s question calmly.

“I was never worried about how you do things. Take care of him and come to the highest layer. We can’t let Gabriel drag the fight out any longer,” Su Lu called back.

“Understood.”

The Forbidden Mage deeply respected Su Lu, judging by how serious he was when he answered Su Lu’s questions.

To Mo Fan, the man had completely become Su Lu’s pet dog, but he was stronger than the Top Seaters and High Seaters.

The Star Palace around Xi Zhe had several layers of light. They looked like stars setting off a majestic palace.

A normal Star Palace consisted of twenty-four hundred and one Stars.

However, Xi Zhe’s Stars had reached over ten thousand! Each Star contained a different energy from the Stars of ordinary Mages. Every Star was connected to three or more Star Orbits. The Stars were connecting with the Star Patterns and Star Constellations.

It was Mo Fan’s first time seeing anything like it. The Stars had a complicated but symmetrical pattern, allowing Xi Zhe to unleash their maximum potential.

The Stars were like a circuit board, magnified to the size of a skyscraper. They contained a remarkable level of energy!

Even without relying on a Forbidden Curse, a Forbidden Mage’s power could easily crush every opponent below their level. It was like a normal human who had ascended as an immortal. How could a human being possibly stand a chance against an immortal? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Magnificent mountains brimming with the light of stars emerged from the ground. The light of the stars had filled the mountains. The Forbidden Mage only need to fling his sleeves to trap Mo Fan inside a universe. Strong forces were pulling Mo Fan from all directions, trying to tear him apart.

Each of the mountains was like an independent magnetic field. There were lots of Stars at first, but they had attached to one of the mountains to prevent themselves from dispersing like dust particle.

Mo Fan was trapped in the middle of the force fields. His head, arms, legs, back, and chest were being pulled by different forces. The forces did not cancel one another out. They were like devils, each trying to drag him into their own Hell. They would rather tear their target into pieces, instead of letting other mountains claim their prize.

Each of Mo Fan’s body parts was heading in a different direction.

Mo Fan could feel the forces growing stronger. If he did not break free from the forces, even the sturdiest body would be torn into pieces!

However, Mo Fan was struggling to use his power after being trapped in the universe.

He could not sense any magic particles around him, as if the mountains had already sucked them away and converted them into a part of the mountains.

The spell of a Forbidden Mage was unlike anything Mo Fan had encountered before. It was strange, powerful, and uncrackable.

Mo Fan’s bones were starting to dislocate. His demon flesh was unusually strong, but it still could not withstand the force of his magic.

The Forbidden Mage knew Mo Fan was not normal. Only the special spell was effective against him. It did not matter how sturdy his body was and how many capabilities he had, he was doomed as long as he could not break free from the Universe of Death!

“All of you want a piece of me?! Why don’t you come to me then!?” Mo Fan roared furiously. His body that was bending out of shape from the pulls started to draw back in.

Just come at me if you want a piece of my body!

The will of the demon! Mo Fan had materialized his will into chains!

Mo Fan tossed the chains at the Starlight Mountains and exerted a stronger pulling force himself. “Come to me!!!”

The burning stripes of a wolf’s-head on Mo Fan’s chest brightened.

The burning stripes replaced the tone of Mo Fan’s body and spread across his muscles, setting his body on fire. He was pulling the mountains to him with brute force!

His demonic flesh remained intact despite the strong pulling forces that were trying to tear it apart, like it had been refined into titanium.

Meanwhile, the mountains that Mo Fan was pulling with the chains were collapsing as they were moving. Countless layers of debris were falling off them!

The rocks scattered across the place were all from the mountains.

The eight mountains were slowly hauled Mo Fan’s way. They were like eight wild horses being dragged back to a warrior with brute force, and were starting to tip.

BANG!

The Starlight Mountains began to clash with one another as they drew too close. Some of the mountains even collapsed into rubble.

Mo Fan’s stripes were burning vigorously. Even his eyes had swaying flames in them.. His body was emitting a scorching heat, yet did not have a single crack on it. It had become oddly sturdy!
