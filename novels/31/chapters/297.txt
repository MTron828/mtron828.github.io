Chapter 300: Taking Advantage of the Precarious Situation

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

The frost was like a crystal art that had appeared out of nowhere. The Bewitching Magic Spider had turned into the most precious sculpture of the art. Its fury, its ferocious aura as a Warrior-level creature, its unstoppable murderous intent were still lingering around it...

But it was now motionless. His life force had disappeared instantly.

Everything in the vicinity was covered with a layer of frost now. The pond was now a shattered mirror. The stalks of grass had become some fragile, rigid objects. The rocks were turned into ice cubes. Under the moonlight, the whole place was enchanted with a still, icy aura.

Mo Fan eyes were wide. He still could not believe the power that the arrow had unleashed!

Mo Fan had seen Deathstrike Magic Equipment before. Most of them were in the form of a longsword, or something with a sharp edge. When activated, they would grant the magician the ability to execute a powerful slash. Its strength was equivalent to that of a very destructive Intermediate Magic Spell.

Mo Fan had seen some of them during the auctions. The ones he thought would suit him were at least twenty million yuan. Those with their unique forms were even more expensive, and there was no point going to their auctions without fifty million yuan.

Mo Fan already had quite some offensive abilities, so he never paid extra attention to Deathstrike Magic Equipment.

To his amazement, he had witnessed an incredibly rare Bow-type Magic Equipment today!

The bow was made of ice crystal particles that looked like bits of diamond. The moment the arrow was fired, it froze the whole area instantly, giving its target no chance to react.

Words were not needed to describe its killing force. The problem was, Mu Ningxue was merely an Intermediate Magician. Why would she even have such a piece of insane equipment? If she were to use it during the duel before, she could have instantly wiped out the entire team from the Pearl Institute!

The ice was not even the Nirvana Ice which she had, but an even higher tier of ice crystal!

Since it was able to crystallize everything, it implied that the grade of the Ice Seed had surpassed the Spirit-grade. Mo Fan did not expect Mu Ningxue would have an even stronger Ice Seed, on top of the Nirvana Ice!

That did not sound right, either. If she had a stronger Ice Seed, there was no reason for her to hide it. There would be more casualties if they did not eliminate the Bewitching Magic Spider in time.

“Phew~”

Mu Ningxue’s hair fell and returned to normal. The disheveled hair drifted across her face, which somehow made her look even more lovely.

She was panting heavily, trying to catch her breath. The red mark on her forehead had finally disappeared. Her previous empress-like formidable aura as she was firing the arrow had vanished, as if her energy had been fully drawn out, leaving her extremely fatigued.

Mo Fan immediately rushed to her side and supported her when he saw her swaying.

“I still can’t fully control it...” Mu Ningxue murmured to herself.

“Since when do you have such strong equipment?” Mo Fan asked.

The Ice Crystal Bow was definitely not something that an Intermediate Magician could use. Normally, if someone were trying to imprint high-level equipment, their soul would suffer tremendous torture, as it could not withhold the item’s power.

Mu Ningxue’s cultivation was far from being able to utilize such a thing. Mo Fan was worried about her soul.

The reason magicians meditated was to strengthen their soul. The different levels of cultivation meant there were different amounts and levels of equipment they could imprint at a time. The level of equipment which an Intermediate Magician could imprint was restricted, as they were unable to endure the force of a Deathstrike item possessing a power equivalent to an Advanced Magic.

The power that Mu Ningxue’s Bow displayed was not as strong as an Advanced Magic, but it was not far off. Her soul would be enduring a great burden if she actually imprinted it.

“I just need some rest.” Mu Ningxue sat on the ground. She would pass out any second now, judging from her extremely pale look.

Mo Fan stayed beside her. He was full of questions as he stared at the depleted Mu Ningxue.

The bow was somehow different from the equipment he had seen before, but Mo Fan, who had little knowledge, couldn’t describe what the difference was.

That being said, his instincts were telling him that the bow might be tightly related to why Mu Ningxue had changed so much over the years. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

On top of that, Mu Ningxue’s Ice Seed was not just a simple Spirit-grade Soul Seed.

If an item’s Element was the same that the magician had, its power would be enhanced further by the magician’s Element.

The Ice Crystal that Mu Ningxue had cast was stronger than her Nirvana Ice. Even a relatively strong Warrior-level Bewitching Magic Spider was killed instantly, enough to highlight its outstanding force.

It was surely Mu Ningxue’s trump card, she was only using it as her last resort. That alone was obvious just by looking at her current state. She had been keeping a lot of secrets to herself.

——

Mu Ningxue had rested quite a while, but Mo Fan still did not dare to leave, as she still could not stand properly.

Sometime later, her eyes finally sprang open. She quickly glanced at Mo Fan and shifted her gaze.

She could still recall the boy she used to like when looking at Mo Fan’s face. The feeling was concealed deep inside her heart, so deep that she thought she had forgotten it. At times, the feeling would rise out of nowhere, creating a ripple on the frozen lake in her heart.

She was utterly grateful that he was looking after her. As a matter of fact, she had always been grateful to him.

In their younger years, Mo Fan was already different than the rest of the kids. He was fearless, and never acted logically.

The kids in the neighborhood would look at her from a distance, not daring to get close to her. Mo Fan was the only one who completely ignored the warnings and advice of the elderly. He would drag her around with his filthy hands and chase away the loneliness and fear of her childhood.

He was full of nonsense, he swore a lot, he was naughty, but he had the courage to bullshit by her side.

There was no special reason why Mu Ningxue liked him in the past. It was simply because Mo Fan was the closest boy to her. The others would only keep their distance from her. They would either try to fawn on her, pretend to be cool around her, be too embarrassed to talk to her, or put on an act...

Mu Ningxue shook her head, trying to get rid of the thoughts.

Maybe she was recalling things because of the lingering effect from the bewitchment?...

“Let’s go, I’m fine now.” Mu Ningxue rose to her feet.

Mo Fan subconsciously offered his hand. Mu Ningxue did not take it. The intimacy between them was all in the past, they were grown-ups now. They had their own lives to live, their own rules to stick to, there was no need...

Mu Ningxue was trying to maintain the distance between them, but as usual, she was helpless against Mo Fan’s unpredictable moves. A filthy hand reached out and grabbed her smooth hand, while the other grabbed her shoulder.

Mu Ningxue had totally run out of energy. Otherwise, she would definitely hang this asshole who was taking advantage of her precarious situation up in the air and beat the crap out of him!
