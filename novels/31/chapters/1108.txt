Zhao Manyan was still in the maze of darkness. He finally broke free from the chains, yet he was struggling to find the way out.

Not long after, the main judge announced in a loud voice, “The Chinese team requests a substitution!”

Zhao Manyan was trying his best to break free from the Nyx Regime. In the meantime, he was hoping that the person that was knocked out on their team was that little b**ch, Mu Tingying.

However, the truth was not as ideal as he thought. It was Nanyu that failed to defend herself against Reed’s destructive spells, which were able to ignore any defensive spells.

The person that substituted for her was Jiang Yu. Again, it was not what Zhao Manyan had expected. Shouldn’t they send Mo Fan into the match by now, so the two destructive Mages could have a showdown and see who was going to last until the end?

What could Jiang Yu possibly offer?

Jiang Yu immediately summoned his Rock Golem General when he entered the stage. To everyone’s surprise, the Rock Golem General had evolved to the Commander-level, and its thick rocky skin had turned into a powerful shield!

Although Reed’s magic was able to ignore defensive spells, it was unable to penetrate someone’s defense. His spells were only effective if his captain Johnson cast the same spell that had eroded the Inferior Dragon’s armor.

Zhao Manyan had always thought Jiang Yu’s heavy and clumsy Rock Golem was fairly useless. However, as the creature stood firmly in front of the team to endure the destructive spells for them, Zhao Manyan was quite impressed by it!

“Look out, they are using the same approach again!” Ai Jiangtu knew Johnson was on the move when he sensed the presence of the Shadow Element surging around the Rock Golem General.

Johnson’s Dark Magic was fairly powerful. It was able to erode the sturdy skin of the Inferior Dragon. It was likely that the spell was the Rock Golem General’s weakness, too.

“Too slow!” Johnson grinned coldly, hurling several shadow pikes at the Rock Golem General from his mantle.

The shadow pikes were unstoppable. As they landed on the Rock Golem General, its skin began to erode at a pace visible to the naked eyes...

A silver rhomboid appeared above the Rock Golem General right after the shadow spikes. The strong gravitational force knocked the creature to the ground. The creature was already struggling to stand from the erosion, so it immediately slammed to the ground as the rhomboid came crashing down onto it!

The silver flicker in Reed’s eyes slowly disappeared. The giant rock creature had been quite a nuisance to deal with, but now, he would soon knock the members of the Chinese team out with his destructive spells one by one!

Lightning flickered rapidly in the air, with deep groans of thunder above the clouds. It felt like they were going to explode at any second!

The lightning strikes came down at the Chinese team. Each lightning strike had a hint of a sinister, green light, and whenever the lightning strikes easily passed through the defensive spells, the green luster would brighten up...

“Night Rakshasa, take him out with a single blow!” Jiang Yu ordered.

Jiang Yu had endured the attack silently. As he was covered in wounds and bruises after being struck by the lightning, the Night Rakshasa that had been hiding in the dark made her move.

Jiang Yu knew that their first priority was to take out the destructive Mage on the opposing team. He had allowed the man to attack his Rock Golem General just so he would lower his guard.

The Night Rakshasa was a brilliant assassin. She was completely silent as she moved across the sand. She dashed forward within the brief darkness whenever a lightning flash took place. The agile cat demon turned into a dark slash and swept past the back of Reed’s neck without a sign.

Jiang Yu was not trying to take Reed’s life. The organizer had made it clear that if the participants were able to leave a little scratch on the opponents’ vital parts, they would be disqualified from the match.

As such, the Night Rakshasa only needed to leave a faint scratch on the back of Reed’s neck to disqualify him!

Reed was still immersed in the pleasure of his destructive spells. He was usually a man with no expression, but whenever he saw his enemy fleeing for their lives before him, he would burst out laughing like a maniac. He enjoyed watching the despair that his enemy showed whenever he attacked with his destructive spells!

That distraction had prevented him from noticing the agile cat demon approaching him.

Reed reacted fairly quickly. He yelled, “Telekinesis: Scatter!” when he noticed the ambusher was right behind him.

The force of the Telekinesis circled the man before shoving in all directions, trying to knock the Night Rakshasa away.

The petite figure of the Night Rakshasa forced her way through the force like a needle and continued to approach Reed’s weak spot.

Reed panicked. He did not even have the time to summon his magic Armor. He could only dodge instinctively.

“Earth Wave!” Not far away, the German team’s captain, Johnson cast a spell. He controlled the sand below Reed’s feet and forcibly dragged the man toward him.

It was unlikely that Reed could dodge the Night Rakshasa’s attack on his own. However, with Johnson’s help, Reed managed to dodge the deadly attack. The Night Rakshasa’s claws only left a deep cut half a meter long on Reed’s back.

“Damn it, it was so close!” Jiang Yu was disappointed upon seeing the outcome.

If the Night Rakshasa had been able to take Reed out, their team would have a great chance at winning the match.

However, Johnson, the captain of the opposing team, was a very sharp and experienced fighter. On top of that, the man’s primary Element was the Shadow Element, so it was very likely that he had noticed the Night Rakshasa as she was making her move.

Normally, people would simply mistake the slight presence of magic as part of the collision between spells, and simply ignore it. However, the German team’s captain was extremely cautious, and he managed to save Reed in the nick of time!

“Don’t underestimate these Chinese, do you understand?!” the German captain snapped coldly.

If they took the match seriously, they would surely find openings to disqualify the members of the Chinese team, but the two teams were currently on an equal footing. It definitely did not look good for them!

“That son of a b**ch, I won’t forgive him!” Reed said, clenching his teeth as he felt the burning pain on his back.

The woman with moles quickly backed away from the fight with Mu Tingying to treat Reed’s injury, since the man was the core of their team!

“Go and unleash your wrath, little beast!” the woman with moles said in an alluring manner after treating the man’s wound.

Reed was truly infuriated. Now that two of his teammates were focusing on protecting him, he no longer needed to keep an eye on the detestable cat demon.

The man vented his anger by casting a Fire spell with a furious roar. The flames of the formidable Sky-Flame Funeral poured down from the sky. As the people lifted their gazes, they immediately saw a meteorite coming down at Venice, bearing a spectacular aura of death!

The Hellish Flames had wide coverage and were entirely unstoppable. Almost half of the stage was set aflame.

Ai Jiangtu tried his best to rescue his teammates by casting Blink continuously. He first repositioned Jiang Shaoxu since he was right in the middle of the blast, before knocking Jiang Shaoxu further into the distance with his Telekinesis. He then stood in front of Mu Tingying and used his will to form a wall to face the sinister, green flames directly...

Unfortunately, even the defense set up with his will was still considered a defensive spell, meaning that the Hellish Flames were able to pass through it with ease.

The flames knocked Ai Jiangtu and Mu Tingying flying, the scorching heat striking them fiercely.

The two had already used some of their defensive equipment. They were struggling to stand against the incredible force.

Mu Tingying was devoured by the Hellish Flames. She slammed into the barrier and almost lost consciousness. An assistant judge quickly came and carried her down the stage.

Mu Tingying soon regained consciousness. When she realized she had been carried down the stage by the assistant judge, she snapped furiously, “I’m fine, put me down, I still have equipment that I haven’t used!”

“You have been disqualified from the match,” the assistant judge declared firmly.

The assistant judges would save the participants based on their judgment. Even if they made the wrong call, the participant would still be disqualified from the match!

Mu Tingying’s situation was right on the edge, and in the eyes of the relatively young assistant judge, her life was already in danger, so he decided to intervene.

As soon as he intervened, it did not matter if Mu Tingying was still fit for battle, she would still be disqualified!

Mu Tingying’s face darkened. She had the urge to tear the assistant judge into pieces. She had been disqualified before she could even use her trump card!

The substitution member immediately replaced Mu Tingying as soon as she was carried down the stage.

The member replacing Mu Tingying was Nanrong Ni. The team was being blasted mercilessly by the opposing destructive Mage. Almost every member of the team was injured. At this rate, the remaining four members would soon be knocked out, so it was necessary to send Nanrong Ni in to heal them so they could recover their strength.

Nanrong Ni’s primary Element was Healing. Her Healing Magic was a lot stronger than the woman with moles on the German team. Not long after she entered the stage, she managed to heal Ai Jiangtu’s burns, Zhao Manyan’s festered skin, Jiang Shaoxu’s broken bones, and Jiang Yu’s electric shock, allowing them to recover most of their strength.

“It’s useless to send a Healer in now!” Reed totally turned into a powder keg surrounded by lightning. Wherever he went, he would simply stir a great disaster with his elemental spells.

Since Nanyu was disqualified, Reed had been completely unstoppable. The five members of the Chinese team were forced to use their defensive equipment.

However, the defensive equipment could only be used once. Even Zhao Manyan, who was wearing a full set of defensive equipment was about to run out of it soon.

Seeing this, Feng Li frowned and glanced at Mo Fan, who was like a wild horse champing at the bit. The man said, “Prepare yourself, the others have forced the German team to show what they have, don’t let us down.”

“Mo Fan, do your best!” Mu Nujiao called out with a smile from where she was sitting among the substitutes.

“Just you watch, I’ll blast them to the ground!” Mo Fan had long waited for his turn.
