“Brother Fan, aren’t you a Fire Mage? Why are you going through so much trouble to start a fire?” Zhang Xiaohou laughed. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Don’t you know that the fish you catch yourself always taste more delicious? Otherwise, why wouldn’t I just buy them from the market?” Mo Fan explained.

Zhao Manyan suddenly put on a deep grin and added, “I like eating fish, too. I usually fish myself, but I occasionally buy from the market because it offers a lot more options!”

“Is that why you always hook up with prostitutes?” Mu Bai mocked him.

“Shut up, you don’t even know what a fish tastes like. Why are you acting so proud?” Zhao Manyan retorted.

Zhang Xiaohou chuckled, as Mu Bai was not wrong. Zhao Manyan had asked his imperial bodyguard to name a price not long ago!

“Stop arguing, have a taste of the chicken wings. It’s my secret recipe!” Mo Fan served everyone two chicken wings. The four of them immediately feasted on them.

Their lips were covered in oil. It did not matter if the hot chicken wings had burned their tongues, as they just had to take a sip of their cold beer. Words could not describe how satisfying it was.

It was getting late, but the fire on the beach was burning even brighter.

The four had a lot of drinks, lying on the sand instead of going back to their rooms. They all eventually fell asleep.

——

The sunlight sprinkled on the beach early in the morning and painted the calm surface of the sea with a hint of scorching red. The whole sea was soon blazing red, with waves rolling across its surface.

The four hungover men crawled to their feet and went back into the hotel to have breakfast.

The exhibition was happening at eight. They had almost overslept!

Luckily, the exhibition had just begun by the time they reached the venue.

Mo Fan initially did not have much interest in the dragon beasts, mainly because he was too poor to afford them.

However, he had already sold the booty the little cub had offered to him, and had received the full sum while he was drinking last night. He now had some funds to bid for a dragon beast that pleased his eyes.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are now showing you a Groundfang Dragon!

“Even though it’s only a Pseudo-dragon, its body is covered in sturdy bone armor. Its bones are as strong as an Inferior Dragon! It does not know any magic, but it’s an adept fighter. It’s the perfect beast for charging into enemy lines and fighting in close combat.”

The Groundfang Dragon had a fierce appearance. Sharp bony spikes covered it from its horns to its tail. The Pseudo-dragon could easily crush any Commander-level creatures!

Many of the Mages who were present would have no trouble defeating the Groundfang Dragon, but it was extremely difficult to tame it so it would take orders from a human, especially after it was sold to a buyer.

Taming demon creatures had always been the specialty of Psychic Mages!

“What do you think?” Zhao Manyan asked Mo Fan.

Mo Fan shook his head. The Groundfang Dragon seemed to be a powerful creature, but he didn’t think it could withstand a single Lightning Spell from him.

Even if he only used it as a mount to travel long distances and pursue an enemy, he did not think he would feel comfortable while riding it.

Zhang Xiaohou shook his head as well. He would be disappointed if the exhibition was only auctioning Pseudo-dragons.

He was more concerned about the mobility of the dragon beasts. The Groundfang Dragon could not fly!

“The Groundfang Dragon is unstoppable if it’s used as the vanguard of an army…” Hua Yuezhu mentioned for them.

As she had expected, many factions were interested in the Groundfang Dragon. They ended up submitting some huge orders for it.

The exhibition was not selling the dragons in small numbers, but in bulk. The buyers could even reserve the amount they wanted every year!

For example, a renowned clan in the north bought thirty of the Groundfang Dragons in stock, and it had ordered another thirty Groundfang Dragons for next year!

The dragon taming clans in England were supplying dragons in huge numbers. Their dragon taming skills were worth more than gold and silver mines!

“This is the Triumphant Eagle Dragon.

“It’s Tamed Level has reached six stars. Not only has it inherited the powerful wings of the dragons, it has also inherited the bravery of the eagle species.”

The Triumphant Eagle Dragon had an eagle’s crest instead of draconic horns. Its claws were similar to those of demon eagles, but its chest, back, and wings resembled a Western dragon.

It was also a Pseudo-dragon, but the soldiers with Zhang Xiaohou opened their eyes wide.

“Six stars? Isn’t that the same level as our Heavenly Eagles?” the middle-aged imperial bodyguard escort to Zhang Xiaohou asked.

“How did the English do it? How are they able to tame these creatures with a draconic lineage?”

The stronger the lineage of a demon creature, the harder it was to tame them!

Western dragons were the hardest creatures to tame, being naturally aloof and fierce. The real dragons saw themselves as superior to humans. The crossbreeds that had inherited a dragons’ lineage would also inherit the dragons’ unruliness and disdain toward other species.

“General, that Triumphant Eagle Dragon is a lot stronger than our Heavenly Eagles. Should we make an order?”

“Let’s wait for now,” Zhang Xiaohou demurred.

——

“The next one is the highlight of our exhibition. Have a look!”

The crowd immediately focused their attention on the stage.

The attendees thought the tamed beasts would be tied in magic chains as a safety precaution. However, the dragon that appeared next did not have any chains on it. Its saliva was even dripping from its exposed fangs. The guests in the front row almost fainted in shock!

The creature was the size of a small hill. Its scales were like well-refined armor plates, expanding and contracting as the creature was moving. The sturdy scales did not hinder its movements at all.

Its wings were wrapped in draconic skin, its visible bones brimming with power. The wings attached to the creature’s back were also connected to its front claws!

Its lower limbs were thick, like the limbs of a huge lizard, but their bright scales made them look more impressive than the rough skin of a clumsy and ugly reptile.

The audience held their breaths as the creature was brought onto the stage.

Was that just a dragon beast? It was more like a real dragon!

Its body, wings, claws, and scales were similar to those of a drake. Most importantly, its imperious Aura made it feel like the owner of the exhibition, instead of just a tamed beast that was being displayed!

“Holy crap, is Ayleen’s clan selling drakes now?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The creature was a lot smaller than a drake, but it had clearly exceeded the level of a Pseudo-dragon. It was a lot closer to the level of a true drake than most Inferior Dragons!
