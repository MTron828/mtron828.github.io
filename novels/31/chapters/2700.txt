Chapter 2701: The Commander is Furious

“Yes!” said Nanrong Xishan. “He also threatened to destroy all the Nanrong family. How can he say such things? Such an arrogant hot-headed devil rules over the Fan Xuexin City and the port in the North City! It is good that you are here, Commander Hua. I hope you take back the territory so that this devil doesn’t harm the local residents!”

“Commander Hua,” said Jiang Shuihan calmly. “We also want to mediate this dispute and end the battle. Many excellent mages lost their lives. Unfortunately, Lord Mo Fan seems too angry to come to a negotiation.”

“Old woman,” said Mo Fan, addressing Jiang Shuihan. “If someone tries to break into your house and then intends to kick you out of your own home, will you talk with the attackers very politely or try to defend your home?”

Jiang Shuihan’s face twitched. ‘Old Woman?!’

Granted she was over forty years of age, but Jiang Shuihan was still called beautiful by many. Some young mages in the Magic Association who did not know her position would sometimes treat her as their peer. Jiang Shuihan wanted to tear Mo Fan’s mouth when he called her an old woman!

“Since the Magic Association in our country allows the clan to own its own territory, run its own business, and cultivate its own mages, the territory becomes sacred and inviolable. Old He should be very clear about this.” Hua Zhanhong glanced at the old man.

Old He of the Clan Alliance nodded. “I haven’t seen you for such a long time, but you’re still the same as before, Commander Hua.”

“You flatter me. If I were younger, I would have arrived an hour ago.” Commander Hua turned to Mo Fan. “By the way, Mo Fan, I happened to encounter a rampant Chief Shark when I was passing by Lan Yang City, so I killed it. The body is still intact and fresh, and I want to give it to you as a gift. Let your subordinates use it for its valuable materials. I hope you accept it as my apology to you.”

The five officials were stunned. Commander Hua was apologizing to this brat?! Moreover, he had killed a Chief Shark which was threatening the Lan Yang City and was offering it to Mo Fan!

“Well, protecting the national treasure is my duty,” said Mo Fan. “Thank you.” He did not really want Commander Hua to apologize to him. He respected him very much.

Instead, he wanted the five old b*stards in front of him to apologize. They had only stood by and watched as Lin Kang strode to slaughter Fanxue Mountain. They didn’t even try to stop him. They let it happen so that Lin Kang could tear Fanxue Mountain apart and they could share it among themselves. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They never intended to take accountability of their actions. They could always blame Lin Kang if he failed, and escape the consequences. How did they expect Mo Fan to not know about what was going on in their minds?

They wanted to destroy Fanxue Mountain, and expected Mo Fan to be polite about it.

“You’re as cool as always, Commander.” Zhao Manyan gave Commander Hua a thumbs up.

Mu Bai also looked at Commander Hua in disbelief.

The chief of the Shark Kingdom was as powerful as the Black Totem Snake. It was the ‘king’ who tried to occupy the West Lake in Hangzhou. Many masters in Hangzhou could do nothing about it, but it was killed by Hua Zhanhong who was just passing by. What realm was Hua Zhanhong at?

“It ran around like it lost a treasure, and other shark monsters were escorting it. It was… unlucky to meet me. Unfortunately, it was not the King of the Shark Kingdom. The coastline of 1,000 kilometers from north to south of Lan Yang City is safe now. A fortress city can be built there for the migrants to live in,” said Commander Hua.

Mo Fan nodded. “Since Commander Hua is here in person, I’d better hand it over. I’m not comfortable handing it to people I can’t trust.” Mo Fan took out the Earth Fire Pistil and reluctantly put it on the table.

Earth Fire Pistil. This had been the sole reason for Fanxue Mountain’s catastrophe.

No matter how many enemies Fanxue Mountain had, they wouldn’t have dared to attack if it hadn’t for the coveted Earth Fire Pistil.

Fortunately, they had been able to hold the enemies off until Commander Hua arrived.

Hua Zhanhong had a very high status and an extraordinary position. If Zhao Jing had gotten the Earth Fire Pistil, he would have digested it in a day or two along with the Zhao family. It would then be too late to question them.

The Earth Fire Pistil was an important item needed to step into the Forbidden Curse. According to the International Mage Convention, whoever got to it first could own it.

If Zhao Jing had gotten it and ran abroad to seek protection from the International Mage Convention, even Commander Hua would not have been able to violate the law and snatch it back.

“Is this the national treasure that was hidden in Fanxue Mountain?” Nanrong Xishan said in awe.

Great General Li Shou glared at Nanrong Xishan.

“The Earth Fire Pistil. This is the biggest one. In the past, it could be used even by first-tier cities!” Jiang Shuihan exclaimed.

When Commander Hua saw the Earth Fire Pistil, even he couldn’t help getting excited. This was indeed a treasure. It had almost fallen into the hands of someone as greedy as Zhao Jing.

“You have worked very hard.” Commander Hua knew that Fanxue Mountain had suffered great losses to protect this treasure. He felt guilty and apologetic.

Fanxue Mountain could have handed over the Earth Fire Pistil and ended the war to save itself. Lin Kang wouldn’t have dared to attack Fanxue Mountain without a good enough reason after that.

To Commander Hua, Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai and Mu Ningxue were still children but their resolve hadn’t shaken even in the face of such danger.

Commander Hua looked at the five officials of the Flying Bird Base City and sighed. Some of them were not even comparable to the righteousness and passion of these young people from Fanxue Mountain.

“When the people of Fanxue Mountain got hold of the Earth Fire Pistil, they notified me immediately. The Earth Fire Pistil is important, so I instructed them to protect it and not to reveal it to anybody,” said Commander Hua.

“Li Shou, Lin Kang was your subordinate,” said Commander Hua, turning to the Great General. “I would like to ask who represented my authority when Lin Kang invaded Fanxue Mountain for the Earth Fire Pistil? Or, did you represent my authority to snatch it for yourself?”

Commander Hua was not as calm as he had been when he arrived. His eyes flashed dangerously as he glared at the Great General.

Great General Li Shou felt his whole body go numb. He fell to the floor on his knees. The ground beneath him began to crack.

“I… I was deceived by Lin Kang,” stammered the Great General. “I couldn’t tell right from wrong. I deserve your punishment, General Hua.” The Great General Li Shou couldn’t even raise his head. His clothes were soaked in cold sweat.

The other four officials did not even dare to squeak. It was no wonder Commander Hua had arrived in person. The Earth Fire Pistil was a national treasure that brought vitality to the city.
