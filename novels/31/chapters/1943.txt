A lamp was hanging by the balcony, like a crescent moon fallen down to the mountain.

Ever since a Candidate for Goddess had jumped to her death from the watchtower on the Mountain of the Goddess, not many people were willing to come here. There were a lot of other attractions on the mountain, so it did not really matter.

Mo Fan went up the stairs and saw a slender back up on the watchtower. She was wearing a silk robe that was almost long enough to reach the ground. Even her hair was hidden inside the robe.

A rather distinctive face was under the hood. Her nose was so pointed that even some men would feel ashamed of themselves. Her nose bridge made her look like she was superior to others!

“Have a seat!” Izisha said calmly when she saw Mo Fan approaching. Her expression was similar to a cat playing with a mouse.

Izisha was in a good mood. She had considered many ways to get rid of Mo Fan, but not many of them were viable. To her amusement, Fate had arranged for him to come to her instead!

“Let’s get straight to the point,” Mo Fan said.

“Sure, drink this poison, and I’ll tell you everything,” Izisha poured a cup of tea and gave it to Mo Fan.

“Why don’t you jump off the tower instead?” Mo Fan scoffed.

“I guess we won’t have a proper conversation then,” Izisha took the cup of tea back and drank it.

Mo Fan’s lips twisted when he saw what she was doing. Damn it, this woman was toying with him!

“If I didn’t have a few things to ask you, you wouldn’t even have the right to sit in front of me,” Izisha informed him.

“If my friend wasn’t in trouble, I would feel disgusted if I said another word to you,” Mo Fan immediately shot right back.

Mo Fan had no reason to compromise in front of Izisha.

He was just going to try everything in this desperate situation. If Izisha was willing to reach a deal with him, they could still talk business while putting their personal grudges aside. Otherwise, he would not even bother talking to her. Who knew if Izisha was going to make things worse and drag them all into a mess?

That being said, if Mu Bai knew Mo Fan was going to negotiate with such an attitude, he might just roll his eyes and die straight away!

“I heard you were the one who opened the gate on the Island of Oblivion?” Izisha asked him.

“Something like that,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“Ethan in Egypt is an old friend of mine. I heard he’s in a pretty bad spot,” Izisha remarked.

“He asked for it,” Mo Fan replied simply.

General Ethan from Cairo had been placed under the Medusa’s Curse by Apas. He was constantly being tortured day and night. Ethan had asked Izisha for help, but even Izisha had no clue how to overcome the deadly stare of Medusa’s descendants!

“Give Ethan his freedom, and we’ll talk,” Izisha stated her condition.

“Ethan is Egypt’s general.”

“Your friend is ensnared by the God of Darkness.”

“How can I guarantee that you’re going to tell me what I want and it’s going to work if I give Ethan back his freedom?” Mo Fan countered.

“Mo Fan, the conflict between us only happened because we are on opposing sides. There’s no such thing as enemies forever. If you’re willing to exchange benefits with me, I won’t mind. At least from the way I see it, having the general owe me a favor is more valuable than your life,” Izisha declared.

Izisha poured Mo Fan another cup of tea and placed it in front of him.

Mo Fan completely ignored it. He would never drink anything she offered.

Izisha smiled when she saw Mo Fan not willing to accept it. She poured the tea into the bush nearby. The bright flowers immediately turned into a patch of black slime. Even the soil was completely spoiled.

“Are you showing me a trick?” Mo Fan said scornfully.

“I’m practicing. I will bump into different people in my life who control a part of the world. Once I master it, I will be able to pour them a cup of normal tea or a cup of poisonous tea as I please!” Izisha played around with the cups and the teapot.

“I normally just pour it on their faces,” Mo Fan sniffed.

“Good idea. I won’t pour you a cup of normal tea next time,” Izisha nodded, as if she had learned something from Mo Fan’s advice.

“I can let Ethan go, but you will tell him that the Curse only happens because of himself. If he continues with his wicked behavior, the Curse will target him again,” Mo Fan finally said.

“I’ll relay the information to him. I’m not fond of his character either,” Izisha agreed.

“It’s your turn,” Mo Fan prodded her.

“The God of Darkness... Didn’t you already open the Gate of the Underworld on Izisha? Why don’t you try entering the Dark Plane from there? The God of Darkness is actually a merciful god in his world. He is willing to let your friend go as long as you replace him with something more valuable,” Izisha said.

“Are you kidding me? The Dark Plane is so huge. Am I going to travel across mountains and oceans just to look for him?” Mo Fan said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“If you aren’t willing to look for him in the Dark Plane, you can only let him come to you instead. You can Summon the God of Darkness to you; he will at least send his avatar to you. However, whether he will erase your existence or is willing to listen to your offer is totally up to you,” Izisha continued.

“What do I need?” Mo Fan asked neutrally.

Going into the Dark Plane to look for the God of Darkness was definitely not an option. There was no way he would leave the Dark Plane in one piece. It was the true definition of Hell!

“You haven’t fulfilled your end of the bargain,” Izisha said.

Mo Fan left the watchtower. He Summoned Apas, who had been sleepy most of the time lately.

Apas seemed to have gone into seclusion after she acquired the Receiver Crystal. Sometimes, she would turn into a little snake with an unquenchable hunger, and would drain away all the energy in Mo Fan’s Summoning Element.

Apas was obviously not pleased with Mo Fan. She stood behind Mo Fan with a cold smirk, as if the two were not bound by a Contract. Apas was like a queen staring at an insignificant creature.

“Trying to revolt?” Mo Fan chuckled when he saw Apas’ reaction.

“I think about it every day!” Apas confirmed.

“Enough putting on airs, it’s time to get rid of the Curse you placed on Ethan,” Mo Fan told her.

“Medusa’s Stare isn’t a promise between two kids that are playing house! You can’t just remove it!” Apas snarled back at him.
