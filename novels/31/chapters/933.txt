Lightning arcs surged fiercely through the air less than twenty meters above Mo Fan’s head and landed on the footprint that he had just left behind. The area around the footprint immediately turned scorched black, with blue smoke rising from it.

The wind was so strong that his face was hurting as if it was being sliced by knives. The wind even cut off the tips of his hair and blew them into the air!

Frankly speaking, Mo Fan had not thought going into the storm was a brilliant idea. They had come so deep that even if they stopped moving forward, the wind would still drag them forward now!

The only thing that he was grateful for was that the light of the Essence Orb was actually growing stronger, implying that he was getting closer to the source of energy that could fill it up.

The cries of the birds felt even closer. Even the roar of the strong wind could not hide their cries. As they ventured deeper into the blurry storm, Mo Fan noticed several green figures beating their wings hard to resist the wind while diving at them.

How deep was the grudge the birds had against them, that they were willing to enter the storm just to pursue them?

“Prepare for battle!” yelled Ai Jiangtu.

“Are these sons of bitches out of their minds?”

“The birds that are weaker won’t be able to come this far, meaning that their numbers aren’t as overwhelming!” claimed Jiang Yu.

However, even as Jiang Yu’s voice was still spreading in the storm, a huge group of strange birds with green bodies were diving right at them. They were fierce and agile, and knew how to control the airflow, too. The creatures were a lot stronger than the team had imagined!

“Don’t get separated, maintain the formation!” commanded Nanyu.

Visibility in the storm was extremely low. The communication devices were not working due to the interference of the lightning. The loud cries of the birds and the rumbling of the wind simply meant that the team could only communicate by shouting at the top of their lungs. That being said, Nanyu was a Sound Magician, and could easily transmit her voice to the team.

“Maintain the formation and go a bit deeper. There are simply too many of them, we don’t stand a chance here,” ordered Nanyu.

The team continued to move deeper into the storm, hoping that the storm would form a boundary and quarantine them from the birds...

Unfortunately, the strange birds were adept at controlling airflow. They continued to pursue the team relentlessly.

“Mo Fan, behind you, watch out!” Nanyu released her awareness and listened to the surroundings.

Visibility in the wind was simply too low. The team could not even see one another’s faces. They could only rely on Nanyu’s commands.

Mo Fan turned around and saw five strange birds with green bodies and blue wings flying close to the ground. They reached out their sharp claws as they were approaching Mo Fan, trying to lift him up into the air.

Many strange birds in the air had already placed their serviettes and were holding their knives and forks. They were prepared to enjoy a grand meal once the humans were lifted into the air.

“Choosing me as your target, have you asked my needles for permission?” Mo Fan spread out his fingers. The presence of the Shadow Element circled around his fingers...

Giant Shadow Spikes in the form of pocket-size swords appeared between Mo Fan’s fingers. They were as thin as needles when they were between Mo Fan’s fingers, but as they sprang forward, each sword immediately split into twelve in total, forming a dark star formation rapidly!

The five strange birds were too focused on their coming meal. They did not notice the trap of Giant Shadow Spikes on the ground. As they passed above the Giant Shadow Spike Star Formation, several Giant Shadow Spikes sprang up and nailed the shadows of the birds while unleashing a strong binding force to immobilize them right above the star formation!

“Fourth-tier Giant Shadow Spikes, brilliant!” Zhao Manyan could not help but exclaim after seeing Mo Fan’s move.

As a fuerdai, Zhao Manyan was always embarrassed whenever he saw how resourceful Mo Fan was, despite being just a commoner. As he expected, the guy had enhanced all his Intermediate Spells, too!

Mo Fan smiled. He could feel that his Shadow Element was a lot more responsive than before.

“Help me attract the attention of the strange birds, I’ll give them a big one!” Mo Fan told Zhao Manyan.

“Don’t you play with fire!”

“Trust me!”

Zhao Manyan followed Mo Fan’s instructions. He began to use all he had to attract the attention of the birds.

Zhao Manyan was stacked with defensive spells. Even when more than ten birds were surrounding him and attacking him for several rounds, he would still be perfectly unharmed.

“Plummeting Rays!”

Zhao Manyan controlled the light arrows and fired them in all directions fearlessly. There were lots of light arrows, so even if he was not aiming at the birds on purpose, he could still attract their attention of the birds.

As he thought, the Plummeting Rays were too dispersed, and he only killed some of them. However, a huge group of them began to fly toward him. Their wings almost filled up the entire sky.

“Did I attract a bit too many?” Zhao Manyan started to lose confidence.

The Plummeting Rays had immediately attracted over a hundred strange birds to him! Zhao Manyan suddenly felt like he had just poked a beehive.

“How are these enough?” Mo Fan was not satisfied.

Meanwhile, Jiang Shaoxu, who was closer to the two showed up. When she saw Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan trying to gather the attention of the birds, she immediately donned a cunning smile and said seductively, “Trying to get their attention? Isn’t that simple enough?”

Jiang Shaoxu closed her eyes and spread her spiritual wave rapidly. “Spirit Ripple: Enrage!”

In the Psychic Element, blue ripple meant pacifying, while red represented rage and anger!

As the red glow spread far away, the birds that were holding back in formation suddenly left their designated spots,their eyes dyed red by the Spirit Ripple. A massive number immediately dove at Zhao Manyan fiercely!

In just less than a minute, Zhao Manyan was surrounded by a tornado of strange birds with green bodies, blue wings, and yellow claws. Most surprisingly, these birds were like a school of fish. Despite how close they were, they never crashed into one another. They were attacking furiously, yet they managed to keep their places all the same!

“My Heavens, are you trying to get me killed, Jiang Shaoxu!” Zhao Manyan was stuck in place. The team could hear his voice coming from the communication device with lots of interference.

“Isn’t that what you wanted?” Jiang Shaoxu giggled.

She was the calmest on the team, as the Psychic Element allowed her to pacify the strange birds that were trying to attack her. To them, Jiang Shaoxu was just a harmless little creature. As long as Jiang Shaoxu did not take the initiative to attack them, they would simply leave her be.

“Mo Fan, help me!” Zhao Manyan was devoured by who-knew-how-many layers of strange birds.

One defensive spell after another was cast. The Light Protection, Water Barrier, and Light Scales Armor were enhanced by a blue seal, which made Zhao Manyan’s defensive spells even sturdier than other Magicians with Soul Seeds.

“I’m almost ready, just hold on a bit longer. It’s my first time using it, so I’m still not familiar with it,” said Mo Fan.

Zhao Manyan felt like crying.

-First time using it? Is that idiot seriously entrapping me? If you aren’t familiar, why didn’t you kill the birds one at a time instead?-

“Here it is, Nyx Regime!”

The black Star Constellation hovered around Mo Fan. His hands seemed to be lifting a small curtain. The pitch-black curtain rapidly surged toward Zhao Manyan’s position.

Darkness fell like a black waterfall. As it loomed over the place, the strange birds had no chance of escaping despite their overwhelming numbers. It was the same as trying to chase after the sun when night came...

The darkness devoured all sources of light in the area. Zhao Manyan had trouble seeing his own fingers in the dark. Meanwhile, the strange birds suddenly turned into headless flies crashing into one another.

The darkness not only blinded the creatures, it also inflicted great fear upon them. The birds uttered despairing cries, trying to fly away from the darkness.

However, the area was like a maze. No matter how fast or how accurate their sense of direction was, they were still trapped inside it...

“Nyx Giant Shadow Spikes, time to turn you all into samples!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan unleashed the dark energy once again. Countless Giant Shadow Spikes appeared around him and flew continuously into the area filled with darkness.

The Giant Shadow Spikes were not aiming for the strange birds. They simply entered the darkness and stayed in their position. It looked like the Giant Shadow Spikes were flying randomly, but they were actually constructing an enormous, three-dimensional Giant Shadow Spike Star Formation encapsulating all the birds.

Dark energy was surging wildly inside the area. It felt like the whole place was under the control of the God of the Night. Any creature that tried to move had to obtain permission from him!

This God of the Night was Mo Fan, who was casting the Advanced Shadow Spell!

The strange birds were all immobilized. Hundreds of Giant Shadow Spikes in the area landed accurately on them...

“Awesome!”

Zhao Manyan was the only one that could still move inside the formation. When he saw the strange birds all turning into spitted munchies in mid-air, he exclaimed in surprise.

The power of darkness!

He never thought the power of darkness would be so impressive. It was able to seal a whole bunch of demon creatures, as if it had built a cage of darkness around them!

“Nyx Regime is able to enhance the effects of any Shadow Spell. It’s similar to a Domain... However, my control is still too weak, I can’t keep them in place for too long. Hurry up and leave, I’ll kill them in one breath!” said Mo Fan.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan found the power quite enjoyable. Before reaching the Intermediate Level, the only effective Shadow Spell Mo Fan had was the Fleeing Shadow. It was Mo Fan’s only measure to protect himself. He did not rely much on the Giant Shadow Spikes either, as he would normally kill his enemy if he was stronger, and run for his life if he could not defeat them...

However, after he reached the Advanced Level, the Nyx Regime and the fourth-tier Giant Shadow Spike were able to create an enormous, immobilizing formation directly. It was so powerful that even Mo Fan was left in awe!
