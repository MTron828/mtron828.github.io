Mo Fan looked at the top of the mountain. Dust was still lingering in the quarry and hindering their vision, making it impossible to see the demon creatures at the top.

“Seriously, can’t you treat your lives more preciously? A few Bright-Colored Beasts are on their way down. Hurry up and figure out a plan or run for your lives,” Mo Fan told the carefree Mages.

“Are you stirring up trouble here?” The foreman glared at Mo Fan.

I’m stirring up trouble? The quarry will soon turn into a slaughterhouse. What exactly are these guys thinking!?

“Damn it, look there yourself! Do you think those things that are running toward us are just some kind of rocks?” Mo Fan swore at them.

The Mages who were playing cards finally looked up the slope. A truck filled with ore was slowly moving up it.

The truck had made its way around the basin to reach the slope where the road was. Unfortunately, a huge Bright-Colored Beast the size of a bear was already standing on the road. It charged down the slope and slammed its shoulder into the fully-loaded truck.

The muddy road was not solid. The truck immediately rolled down the slope after the powerful slam.

Metal scraps scattered across the place. The front of the truck was almost separated from the rest of it. Luckily, Mo Fan reacted swiftly and wrapped his golden-brown rock around the driver like a layer of skin so he would not be crushed by the truck as it was rolling around.

BANG!

The truck landed heavily in the quarry and smashed a temporary hut into pieces. The noise finally caught everyone’s attention. They looked up the slope to where the truck had been and realized the Bright-Colored Beasts were already too close to them!

“Damn it, which assh*** is on duty today!?” the foreman yelled in a panic.

The guard in his uniform wore a dark expression. Holy crap, weren’t you the one who called me over to play cards?

“What are we waiting for? Let’s run!” the guard yelled.

“Don’t bother taking the cars!” the foreman snarled.

Driving vehicles at a time like this was a bad idea. The trucks were in the quarry. They would have to drive past the demon creatures to leave this place. The demon creatures could easily catch up to them, even if they gave them a five-minute head start!

“Hide in the caves, quick!” the guard shouted.

The whole place was in chaos. No one knew whose orders they should be listening to. They were running for their lives, just following their instincts.

Mo Fan was shaking his head when he suddenly saw a quick figure rushing at the Bright-Colored Beasts. It was one of the young Mages who had been loading up the trucks.

Mo Fan was impressed by the young Mage’s courage facing the demon creatures when another teenager yelled, “Zhou Pinghe, you’re going the wrong way!”

The young man called Zhou Pinghe stopped. He looked up and saw a Bright-Colored Beast with a huge head and fangs only inches from him. The young man’s eyes rolled up, and he fainted after seeing its menacing appearance.

“Zhou Pinghe, it’s no use pretending to be dead, run!” his friend shouted.

Mo Fan rapped himself on the head.

Please, he lost consciousness from terror!

The others were fleeing toward the caves, but Mo Fan doubted that was a wise decision.

These Bright-Colored Beasts were a mountain species who normally lived in caves. They were capable of digging up mountains! The people would be finding themselves in dead ends by hiding in the shallow caves without any defensive measure!

Mo Fan let out a long sigh. He initially thought he could let them fight for a while and taste the fear of death so they would learn their lesson, but these people were done for if he did not lend them a hand.

“Circle of Crystal Teeth, Rock Explosion!”

Mo Fan waited until the spikes had formed a complete circle. The Bright-Colored Beasts were still a distance away, but the Circle of Crystal Teeth should be able to blast them into pieces.

It was only a tiny circle of the crystalline spikes. The jagged shards had a different color from the ground. They seemed to be scattered across the place, but they were actually in a perfect circle.

With a single thought from Mo Fan, the spikes began to emit a dark red light, as if they were burning at a high temperature.

The red spikes exploded as the temperature gradually increased. The explosion fired the spikes in all directions! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Bright-Colored Beast was over a hundred meters from the Circle of Crystal Teeth when the unexpected shards came out of nowhere. The scorching crystals blasted half its body into pieces.

The Bright-Colored Beast was covered in blood. It managed to stand for only a few seconds before falling to the ground.

The spikes were extremely hot, so they would seriously burn their targets. In addition to that, Mo Fan’s Rock Element also had the innate ability of Sturdy Strike. The Bright-Colored Beast was killed instantly, even though it was only at the edge of Mo Fan’s trap!

“If it was in the middle of the circle, I bet even a Warrior-level creature with thick skin would die instantly!” Mo Fan murmured to himself in satisfaction.

It was only a tiny Circle of Crystal Teeth, mainly because the Mages in the quarry were absolutely useless. None of them had the courage to fight the demon creatures. Otherwise, Mo Fan would have collected more spikes and formed a bigger circle.

It seemed the number of spikes would determine the strength of the trap that was triggered. The Rock Explosion was only the basic version!

“Someone’s explosive just killed a creature!” the foreman exclaimed.

“I don’t think it’s anyone’s explosives. Someone is using Earth Magic,” the guard corrected him.

“Who’s using magic?”

“I think it’s that kid!” The guard pointed at Mo Fan.

“Why aren’t those creatures moving? Oh my, what’s that kid doing?” the foreman asked.

“Ugh... I don’t know.”

The guard was lost for words, mainly because he noticed the ferocious beasts had turned into animals in a circus show as they were fighting Mo Fan.

It was difficult to accept that a young man was making a fool out of the demon creatures that had been chasing them around like livestock.

“That young man is strong. We are safe,” the guard, Zhu Kan, said after a while.

“Really?” the foreman said.

“Mm, trust me, that kid must be an Intermediate Mage!” Zhu Kan said confidently.

“An Intermediate Mage, how impressive!”

“When I’m rich, I’ll hire an Intermediate Mage to protect us!”
