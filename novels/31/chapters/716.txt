A magnificent pair of twin towers fully made of steel glass stood at the center of Feiniao City. It was the main headquarters of the famous Lin Group. They had built half of the new buildings in the city. They were simply the city tycoons!

Inside the Lin Group’s Building, a man with a mustache in a purple-blue suit was sitting in the meeting room at the highest floor. His gaze was staring out of the French windows. The entirety of Feiniao City was in his view, and further extended to the blue ocean in the distance.

He let out a heavy sigh and returned to his desk. On top of it was a blueprint of the city with a giant, striking red cross drawn over it.

“It looks like we’ve lost this time. If I can’t make it work with Feiniao City, what do I even have to compete with people like Zhao Financial Group? I thought Feiniao City was my hope...it’s all bullshit!” The man furiously picked up the blueprint and tore it into pieces.

The man’s secretary, dressed in a white shirt and a suit skirt, spoke softly when she saw the chairman venting his anger, “The mayor is here to talk...”

“What is there to talk about? That liar told me everything except for the most important thing!” said Chairman Lin with a hollow laugh.

“But we are left with no choice, we can’t just give up now. Or should we talk with the people from the family and ask for some money to deal with our biggest problem?” asked the secretary.

“Did you hit the corner of your bed in the morning? Are you out of your mind? Those old pricks can’t wait to see how I’ve failed, just so they can take away everything that I’ve placed as a mortgage, and you’re still asking me to ask them for money?” cursed Chairman Lin.

The secretary did not dare to speak further.

The meeting room fell silent. When Chairman Lin finally vented his anger, he waved his hand and said, “If the mayor is here to discuss the plan to annihilate the sea monsters, I’ll talk with him. If he’s asking me to build another facility to fawn over his superiors, tell him to piss off!”

——

The secretary walked out of the room while murmuring non-stop.

Chairman Lin had vented his anger on his subordinates after failing to make a profit on his investment. She was scolded almost every day, she even had the urge to resign on the spot!

As soon as she arrived in the hall, she saw a group of well-clothed young people sitting on the sofa. They seemed to be discussing something. Judging from their temperament, they were likely to be wealthy and respectable. However, one of them was obviously a local. Not only was his skin tanned, his jeans were whitened, and his sneakers were so worn out that they had almost left muddy footprints in the hall.

“I say, is it a good idea for us to come to Lin Building like this? They are the wealthiest group in our city. I heard that even the mayor is treating him with great respect,” said Liu Meng uneasily.

“Zhao Manyan, are you sure it’s going to work?” asked Ai Jiangtu.

“Trust me, someone in this building definitely needs our help,” said Zhao Manyan confidently.

The secretary was still quite far away, thus she could not hear what the people were discussing. However, she did feel like their presence was an eyesore. She had no idea if they actually had any business coming here.

The mayor would be here soon. It was necessary to chase the miscellaneous personnel away. The secretary summoned a security guard and said, “Go and ask what they are here for.”

The security guard went over and returned fairly quickly, “They said that the owner of this building is in trouble. They have come to help.”

“What the heck?” The secretary was in a bad mood after hearing the words.

-Don’t tell me these young people are fortune tellers, trying to warn us of some incoming disaster!-

“That’s what they said, they even emphasized that there’s nothing they can’t do,” said the security guard.

“Humph, then ask them if they have the courage to kill the sea monsters. Do they seriously have nothing else to do?” said the secretary.

The simple-minded security guard actually went to relay the message.

He soon returned and said to the secretary excitedly, “They said they can.”

The secretary immediately frowned. She took another look at the group of young people. Somehow, she did not feel like they were a bunch of swindlers.

While the secretary was lost in her thoughts, a golden-haired, handsome young man walked up to her with a charming smile. The secretary’s heart skipped a beat.

-This guy, he’s so handsome!-

Zhao Manyan glanced at the tag on the secretary’s chest and after he had confirmed her identity, asked, “Can I ask you a few questions?”

“If there’s nothing urgent, please...” the secretary subconsciously rejected him.

“Your boss must be troubled with something, am I right?” Zhao Manyan asked confidently. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The secretary was startled.

The handsome guy was right, but the thing was, everyone would be troubled by something at all stages in life. Everyone could ask the same thing.

“What are you trying to ask?” said the secretary.

“Most of the real estate development in Feiniao City is under your Lin Group. You’ve even built a perfect dock, aiming to develop it into a transportation hub connecting the north and the south. In the meantime, you’re aiming to appeal to the ships from Japan and Korea, too. However, the city’s economy is suffering. Most of the buildings are new, but there’s no one buying or living in them. No one is willing to invest in your property, either. Your Lin Group is flying your banner on a solitary tree. It’s meaningless if you can’t convince people to buy your property...” Zhao Manyan stated in a clear and logical tone.

“What are you trying to say?” The secretary was not so impressed. Anyone with a certain amount of knowledge could have analyzed the state they were in. After all, everyone knew that the Lin Group was having trouble supporting the city’s economy.

“A city supported by a large financial group, great real estates, a perfect dock, great location, there’s only one reason why the economy is so poor!” Zhao Manyan rubbed his nose, pretending that he was wearing a pair of glasses!

The secretary was stunned by Zhao Manyan’s aura!

“It’s because of the sea monsters! Your sea is extremely dangerous. The sea monsters must have destroyed many ships, scaring the investors away! Your Lin Group is unable to develop further because the sea monsters have stopped your sources of income. Am I right?” asked Zhao Manyan sternly.

The secretary was stunned, but managed to rebut, “Anyone could easily learn the reason if they asked around.”

“Which is why we’ve come to help you settle the problem. See my brothers and sisters behind me? They are all very capable. We’ll get rid of the sea monsters, and in return, you just need to do us a small favor.” Zhao Manyan snapped his fingers proudly.

“Just the fourteen of you?” the secretary was left speechless.

It would take at least a troop of Battlemages to annihilate the sea monsters. Hiring a troop of Magician was extremely costly, and yet they were running short on funds...

Asking fourteen people to annihilate the entire pack of sea monsters that had stopped the city from developing, the secretary only had the urge to ask Zhao Manyan if he was crazy!
