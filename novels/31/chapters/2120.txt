“Stop grumbling into my ears.” Mu Bai’s voice was extremely soft, different from his usual deep tones, like he was pretending to be calm and collected. He was obviously worn out.

“Don’t you know what Mo Fan and I did just to save your life? Not only did we ask that Woman of White Impermanence for help, we even went to the terrifying Scar of Tianshan Mountain just to reach a deal with the God of Darkness to trade your soul back! What the heck have you done? Dying is one thing, but being targeted by the God of Darkness is a whole different level! We went through so much to save you, yet you didn’t even thank me, but complain I’m being annoying?” Zhao Manyan railed back at him.

Mu Bai had seriously had enough of Zhao Manyan. He replied softly, “Sure, Young Master Zhao, I’m utterly grateful toward you. Can you please stop shouting into my ears? My heart isn’t well.”

“That sounds more like it! By the way, you shouldn’t lower your guard. We haven’t found out who was trying to kill you. I don’t think they will give up so easily,” Zhao Manyan told him.

“I know what to do,” Mu Bai looked outside as he was speaking. He happened to see Mo Fan arrive.

Mu Bai smiled, his face pale.

It was as Xinxia had mentioned. He looked like he had aged a lot.

“How was it? The tour in the Dark Plane?” Mo Fan asked.

“It’s better to be alive,” Mu Bai replied helplessly.

The Dark Plane was a real hell. The souls that were dragged into it were soaked in the sea of misery for eternity. He would rather perish instead of suffering more there!

“Did Xinxia tell you?” Mo Fan went on.

“Yeah, she told me I will need the Tyrant Titans’ organs to fully recover,” Mu Bai nodded.

“Leave it to us. Just get some rest,” Mo Fan told him reassuringly.

“I’m going with you!” Mu Bai declared.

Zhao Manyan snarled with wide eyes, “The Hell you are, look at you! Even that girl is livelier than you. The Tyrant Titan can easily flatten you with a stomp!”

“My body might be weak, but I can still use my magic. Besides, I’ve been lying still for too long. I will feel better if I go with you,” Mu Bai said.

Zhao Manyan was about to say something when Mo Fan stopped him. “Come with us, then. I have a little competition with Tuis. He seems to be a Tyrant Titan specialist, so it won’t be easy to beat him. If you can’t fight, you can just come up with ideas or mix a drug that can arouse the Tyrant Titans’ sexual desires so they will show themselves,” Mo Fan said.

Mu Bai’s lips twisted.

Damn it, these idiots could never leave the incident in the Alps behind. If he had known they would tease him about it for so long, he would not have mixed the drug in the first place!

Light snow was falling soundlessly outside.

Tuis was slightly intoxicated as he followed the stairs to the cliff. He looked up and saw a spectacular hut by a snowy cliff with a dim light.

Everyone in the Parthenon Temple knew the little hut was Asha’ruiya’s private residence. Even the Hall Mother did not dare to disturb her.

Tuis jumped and glided down like a sparrow. He nimbly landed on the balcony outside the hut.

Asha’ruiya was half-lying on a woolen bed. Her eyes were staring into the distance, lost in her thoughts. She did not even notice Tuis’ presence until he stepped into her view.

“Do you need any help?” Asha’ruiya asked.

“Nothing, just want to talk with you,” Tuis smiled, stepping into the hut.

“Tuis, are you in a bad mood?” Asha’ruiya asked him directly.

“Of course, an annoying bug has messed up such a pleasant day,” Tuis replied immediately.

“I’m not your caring big sister, so if there’s nothing important, you should go back to your room. If you aren’t satisfied with your room, I can rearrange it for you. If you have any needs, I can arrange those for you too.” Asha’ruiya sat upright and stared at Tuis.

“I’m not interested in those women,” Tuis replied disdainfully.

“Oh, so what kind of woman are you interested in?” Asha’ruiya asked.

“Someone like you, of course!” Tuis stared at Asha’ruiya. He did not restrict himself to her face. He was looking up and down Asha’ruiya’s body too!

“Tuis, someone should have told you that I will be very angry if anyone comes into my hut,” Asha’ruiya told him coldly.

“My apologies, but I believe you also need someone to relieve you of the boredom on a lonely night like this,” Tuis did not realize Asha’ruiya was asking him to leave. He continued to approach her.

The smile on Asha’ruiya’s face turned icy cold.

“I think you were very disappointing today. You were going to show how special you were to the public, yet you embarrassed yourself in front of Ye Xinxia. You drank so you would feel better, so you must be thinking, ‘Isn’t there another Saintess? She didn’t turn down my offer and seemed quite fond of me.’ Is that the reason you came here?” Asha’ruiya analyzed calmly.

Tuis halted in his tracks. The proud smile he was wearing disappeared.

“I only had a dance with you, and you think I’m already your possession? Is that why you can come into my hut regardless of the rules, time, and my privacy, just to fulfill your desires? Oh Tuis, you lack self-control, just like a little kid, or are you so arrogant that you think the whole world should obey you?” The snow began to fall heavier as Asha’ruiya was speaking. Even the air felt a lot colder!

Tuis remained still. He was startled at first, before his face filled with anger, and he began to blush with rage!

“What do you mean by that? Weren’t you the one who invited me here?” Tuis demanded after a long pause. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“I did invite you, but that didn’t mean I was offering you my body, so get out of my hut, now!” Asha’ruiya snarled.

“Who do you think you are, Asha’ruiya? Even the interns who have only been here a few days know about your rumors. Why are you acting so pure and innocent in front of me? Izisha relies on her brute force, Ye Xinxia has the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, and you have only gotten so far because of your body, wasn’t it?” Tuis yelled at her.

Asha’ruiya’s expression did not change by much, yet her eyes were now as cold as the snow outside.

Tuis realized he had overdone it after finishing the sentence, but he could no longer take back the words.

“I can’t stop people from gossiping about me, but you are the first one who dares to say that in front of me. Tuis, you should be very grateful that you have a splendid surname, or you would be very dead by now!”
