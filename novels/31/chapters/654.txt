Commander Yao Ting looked up and stared at the Mountain Zombie.

When he uttered the words, a silver light suddenly erupted at the locations he had appeared at before. The silver light merged into a silver compass hanging in the air, extending from the Mountain Zombie’s forehead to its chest!

Commander Yao Ting performed one last teleportation, but this time, the people clearly saw a black trail running through the center of the compass! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The black axis was parallel to the ground. Before Commander Yao Ting’s afterimage in front of the axis thoroughly disappeared, the real Yao Ting had already moved through the compass and the Mountain Zombie. A shocking death axis appeared on the end, and on the Mountain Zombie’s back, too!

The sound of a string snapping echoed in the air. The death axis had frozen the Mountain Zombie completely for a few seconds, before blood jetted out from both sides of its neck. It turned from a little string to a bursting spring!

The blood poured down like a stream from the sky, dying the whole are red.

The Mountain Zombie uttered a raging roar, yet the death axis had punctured the section between its throat and its chest. The roar simply increased the amount of blood spraying through the air, a spectacular sight!

The Mountain Zombie had been perfectly unharmed even after it was struck by countless Advanced Spells. As a result, the dispirited Magicians immediately regained their morale when they saw Commander Yao Ting’s attack finally inflicting damage on the enormous creature.

The Mountain Zombie was not invincible! The experts among the humans still had a chance to kill it!

“As expected of the Space Element Super Spell!” The rest of the Super Magicians began to draw Star Palaces when they saw Yao Ting taking the limelight.

Only Super Spells were able to inflict real damage on the Mountain Zombie. However, if they were able to break down its steel-hard skin, or leave a clear wound on the Mountain Zombie’s body, they could also focus their Advanced Spells on the vulnerable spot to inflict damage to the creature effectively

However, the attempts to break through its sturdy defense or leave a wound could only be done by Super Magicians!

The Space Compass: Axis of Death had sealed the Mountain Zombie in place for a few seconds, giving the Super Magicians a chance to construct their Star Palaces...

One after another, Star Palaces were constructed. Their brilliance alone almost cleared the dull clouds in the sky.

“I’ll go first!” Zhu Meng’s deep voice sounded. His lightning armor was surrounded by mysterious lightning talismans and dancing runes.

The lightning talismans appeared on Zhu Meng’s palm in an orderly fashion, before transforming into a long spear. The talismans and runes he had summoned accumulated at the tip of the spear...

“Lightning Punishment Formation: Prohibition of the Nine Disciplines!”

Zhu Meng tightened his grip on the lightning spear. Countless ashen-gray lightning chains burst out from both sides in an exaggerated manner, scattering across the air. From afar, it looked like a man surrounded by lightning was grabbing a bunch of lightning bolts in his hand for a weapon!

Zhu Meng launched the lightning spear into the air. The people could barely see its flight path. It suddenly stopped as it reached its highest point and split into nine spears, while growing in the process!

The nine lightning spears hung in the air surrounding the Mountain Zombie, forming a formation with wild lightning flickering within it...

The lightning formation was magnificent, comparable to the tip of a mountain. The Mountain Zombie was about to step forward and stomp furiously on the humans that were causing it to bleed. However, it simply had no chance to move, as the lightning runes around the spears suddenly emitted a blinding glow, summoning countless lightning strikes to land on it!

Only the Super Lightning Spell was able to entrap such a huge creature. Once the formation successfully restrained the creature, the other Super Magicians would follow up and inflict serious damage to it!

The people felt like the Mountain Zombie was right in front of them, even though it was still around two kilometers away. Even the energy ripples from the Super Spells were shocking the Magicians.

The Magicians watched the seven Super Magicians executing their ultimates and attacking the Mountain Zombie from different directions. Ignoring the ground that was trembling from the impacts, Mo Fan was so caught up in the fight that he completely forgot the danger surrounding him.

“Now is our chance, to the Dark Abyss!” ordered Han Ji.

The Imperial Magicians constructed the Wind Tracks once again. There were so many of them that it simply built a wind raft carrying them forward rapidly.

The enormous green beast was as eye-grabbing as usual ahead of them. However, Du Xiao was no longer standing on top of the beast, there was no sign of him, yet they could see a bunch of zombies falling to the ground.

The Mountain Zombie was the biggest threat to the army, yet the seven Super Magicians and the troop of Advanced Magicians had managed to hold it off for now. Their main goal was not to kill the Mountain Zombie, nor was it to fight the countless undead. They were already getting closer to the Dark Abyss!

“President, a huge number of Corpse Generals and Corpse Officials have appeared around six hundred meters ahead. We won’t make it through!” Imperial Magician Zuo Feng came with the information in the midst of chaos.

Standing beside Zuo Feng was Yao Nan in his usual coat. There were simply too many people participating in the operation. Mo Fan had only seen Yao Nan just now. Both of them were well-known figures among the Advanced Magicians. They were clearing the path ahead together with Du Xiao and three other Super Magicians.

“We’re almost at the Dark Abyss, we can’t stop here!” said Han Ji.

“But we are having trouble...” Zuo Feng was just about to describe how tough the situation was when he saw Han Ji’s gaze sharpening.

Zuo Feng immediately fell silent as he understood his superior’s intention. In fact, he somehow was looking forward to it.

“Continue forward,” said Han Ji to the Imperial Magicians around him.

Han Ji had been controlling the formation of the Imperial Magicians. When these Advanced Magicians whom he had fostered with utmost care were in the square formation, their combined strength even surpassed that of a Super Magician...

As the core of the army, the formation was not only responsible for protecting the people within it, it was also required to provide assistance to their comrades in the surroundings with spells!

Han Ji knew the Imperial Magicians were approaching their limit. He was already constructing his Star Constellation while commanding the wind raft!

It was a green Star Constellation. Mo Fan did not even detect the presence of magic until Han Ji finished channeling the Advanced Spell in the following second!

The glow was not as stunning as the brilliance of the Super Spells, yet Han Ji had simply flicked the glow between his fingers forward in an indifferent manner. Mo Fan saw the seed summoned from the Star Constellation floating off into the distance before landing among the army of undead ahead.

Around two seconds later, Mo Fan stared at the enormous black flower that had appeared on the battlefield all of a sudden!

The flower was as huge as a small hill, its petals forming a bloody mouth. The flower was beautiful as it blossomed, but when the petals unfolded, it immediately turned into a monster tearing at the zombies!
