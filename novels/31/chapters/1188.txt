The rain started pouring again. The petals that rose into the air were scattered by the raindrops. Not many of them were left intact.

Izisha looked down coldly from the observation tower. She was like a phantom without a spirit, she did not have the slightest living presence.

The believers were not facing her. They had placed all their attention on the girl, and were bowing to her. It meant that her plan had failed. She had failed to take out all the Saintesses, and had failed to claim the Soul of the Parthenon Temple.

The girl had obtained the approval of the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, meaning that the Soul of the Parthenon Temple would not acknowledge a new master for the next ten years. Izisha could not afford to wait another ten years!

Below the sacred mountain, Dulanc was hiding in a shed in low spirits. He leaned against the pillar feebly, his face contorted.

He had clearly abused his powers. The Clergyman of the Holy Judgment Court would soon arrive to sentence him. He had no chance of living without Izisha’s help.

But then again, would Izisha have the power to save him?

The Soul of the Parthenon Temple had been Awakened. It had granted the girl they had accused of being Salan the Spell of Resurrection. It was a deadly blow to the people behind the conspiracy. It was impossible for them to recover now.

The whole Parthenon Temple would turn against them!

“Great Magistrate, we should leave at once. Izisha is surely going to pretend that she knows nothing, but it won’t be so easy for us,” Dulanc’s personal bodyguard spoke up.Read more chapter on

Dulanc gathered his thoughts. The man was right. He could not just sit here and wait for his death. There was no way Izisha would admit that she was responsible for everything that had happened. Running away was the only option he had!

Dulanc immediately fled toward the sacred mountain while everyone was bowing to the girl. He headed for the Mediterranean Sea.

Dulanc still had some connections. He believed he could easily escape the disaster that was about to befall him. He just needed time to plan for a comeback.

Dulanc and his bodyguard fled the city. They could already see the waves of the Mediterranean Sea. The city and the sacred mountain were still not in order. No one put any attention on them.

Dulanc turned around and looked at the Citadel of Athens and the sacred mountain as he felt the sea breeze.

“Great Magistrate, we have to leave now,” the bodyguard prodded him.

“I can’t accept it! We were so close to getting the sacred mountain under our control! It’s not just the Citadel of Athens, but all of Europe too... but I have to run away like a coward now!” Dulanc snapped.

Everything had been going according to their plan. Dulanc had smelled victory the moment he cast the Dark Execution. It had guaranteed their victory in the past, taking out Wen Tai, yet to his surprise, the Dark Execution had failed this time, not to mention that it was against a young man!

-Who exactly was that Mo Fan? How could he possess such terrifying power? How did he even save her from the grasp of the God of Death!?-

“But there’s nothing you can do now; if you really don’t want to leave, I do have an idea,” the man said.

“What? What idea!?” Dulanc was startled. He glanced at the bodyguard that had followed him for fourteen years.

The bodyguard had always been Dulanc’s trusted aide. He was not the smartest, but Dulanc was very satisfied with his ability to complete the orders given to him. Dulanc was a little suspicious; even he was utterly helpless under the circumstances, how could the man come up with any brilliant plan?

The bodyguard stepped closer. He seemed rather mysterious.

Dulanc was feeling impatient. Perhaps he did have a brilliant plan?

As such, Dulanc took the initiative to step closer. However, the bodyguard suddenly stabbed Dulanc’s heart with a dagger made of ice.

Dulanc did not expect the blow at all. His other men had already left when they realized the pinch they were in. They knew Dulanc was in deep trouble. The loyal bodyguard was the only person that stayed by his side, as such Dulanc trusted him even more while cursing his other men countless times.

To his surprise, the bodyguard who seemed to be ready to die for him suddenly showed his true colors. His face was full of hatred and disgust, as if he had nursed this grievance for a long time. The bodyguard’s face even contorted with all the excitement he was feeling!

The dagger was made of ice. Dulanc did not die instantly from the blow. The chill was spreading from his heart to the rest of his body.

Dulanc stared at the bodyguard in disbelief. He still did not understand the reason behind it.

He heard the sound of heels tapping on rocks. Dulanc saw two legs wearing sharp heels coming toward him slowly...

Dulanc slowly lifted his gaze and saw a sharp chin and a pair of emotionless eyes.

“I said that I came to do two things, and the second thing was to take your life. Are you really that forgetful?” a cold voice said disdainfully.

Dulanc saw the woman’s face. This time, it was not covered by black lace and a hat, allowing him to see her face clearly.

“It’s...it’s you!” Dulanc began to truly panic. It sped up the rate of his life being drained away.

“There’s no reason for you to stay any longer in this world. I have already sent your family down there to wait for you. I didn’t leave a single one out, including your beloved bastard,” the woman said.

Dulanc totally lost his mind after hearing the words. He lunged at the cruel woman recklessly.

The woman did not move. Dulanc fell right at her toes as he totally lost all his energy to stand up properly.

Dulanc broke down mentally in an instant, his tears mixed with his snot. No one knew he had a bastard son in this world. Dulanc was extremely displeased by his daughters. None of them had inherited his wisdom and capabilities, until he surprisingly found his bastard son. Dulanc suddenly had some anticipation in his life. He even started paving a path for his son so he could inherit his power...

Dulanc had taken everything into consideration. Even if he failed, his son could still obtain great power in the future. However, Dulanc totally lost his will to live when he heard about the death of his son from Salan!

“Shi Qinghua, Essendale, and you, Dulanc... I’ll leave Izisha for the lucky last,” the woman said. She sounded like she was murmuring to herself.

Dulanc was already a dead man. The cold slowly took his life away. He died on a remote beach where no one would come, in ragged clothes, his face full of pain and despair...

His body would be corroded by the sea breeze and the heat of the sun. People rarely came to this place. When someone eventually discovered his corpse, they simply assumed it was the body of a victim involved in some kind of shipwreck, or someone that had been tossed into the sea...

Dulanc had thought about his death. It would surely take place in a huge church. The people would hold a great funeral, with children dressed in white clothes like angels singing for him. His descendants and his friends would be dressed in the most luxurious outfits, expressing their gratitude for the things he had done. Many powerful people would come and salute him!

It was nothing like the situation he was in now. He was forced to flee for his life in guilt and would now die a horrid death. His body would rot and stink while every single person of his family was brutally massacred!

“You have done well over these years,” Salan glanced at the bodyguard, whose hands were stained with blood.

“Madam, it’s the only thing I lived for since he was set up,” the bodyguard replied.

“Do you have any plans after this? You can come with me if you don’t,” Salan said.

“I’m sorry, I can’t do that; you have killed too much. I believe he wouldn’t want you to do that either, so many innocent lives...” the man answered in a serious voice.

“I only gave him my promise on the condition that he stayed alive,” Salan said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How did the girl awaken your Cardinal Blood Stone, could she be...” the man asked seriously.

The bodyguard no longer had any drive in his eyes after he took Dulanc out. However, he felt a glimpse of anticipation rising in his heart when he asked the question.

“Go ahead if you want to follow her, but we are surely going to stand on opposite sides one day, and I won’t show any mercy when that happens,” Salan said calmly.

“You are right, she is nothing like you. She reminded me of Master when I saw how calm she was facing the Dark Execution.” The man looked relieved.

He knew how cruel and wild the woman before him was. Luckily, their daughter had inherited the personality and temperament of her father.

“That is why I didn’t want to have anything to do with her.”

“So you abandoned her?”

“Yeah, she would grieve for a little dragonfly for the whole day. She’s kind and naive toward everyone, and I was disgusted by it. It kept reminding me of your stupid master.”

“Don’t describe my master like that; he was the smartest person in the world!”

“I told him I was going to kill as many people as he had saved if he died, but he still chose to die ... he chose to believe in hypocrites instead of an evil but honest person like me. Isn’t that stupid?”

“So you’re doing all these because you hated him?”

“The people that cast the black stones were already dead in my eyes; he’s the one that I truly hated.”

“Madam, this is my last time calling you madam. If we are to meet after today, I’ll do everything I can to take your life.”

“Do as you please.”
