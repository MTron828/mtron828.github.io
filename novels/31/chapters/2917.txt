Chapter 2919: Coercive Means

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Wei Guang had seen the true colors of these two people.

He walked to the outside of the Ice Cave, but Mu Rong suddenly appeared in front of him with a darkened face.

Mu Rong put his hand on Wei Guang’s shoulder. His eyes showed hostility and anger. “If you insist on doing it, don’t blame me for the consequences!”

“Although I might not seem very uptight and righteous, I am still a man of principles,” said Wei Guang.

“Principles don’t get you results, boy. I’m not a man of principles. I only care about effective results!” said Mu Rong with a murderous gaze.

The Ice Cave began to tremble, and the stalactites smashed into the ground.

Mu Rong’s beard waved, and his eyes turned sharp. He used magic to easily bury the exit of the ice cave. Those incomparably thick, hard-as-steel ice rocks piled up in front of Wei Guang, completely cutting off the place from the outside. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What are you trying to do? Are you going to kill us so that no one knows the truth?” Wei Guang looked at the blocked entrance in disbelief.

The Extreme South Castle was only a few dozen kilometers away from here. The members of the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance and the Holy City were inside the castle. They represented the most sacred and authoritative people in the world, and Mu Rong, one of them, dared to commit murder here.

At first, Wei Guang thought that Mu Rong was just using coercive means to threaten him. However, he soon saw the brutality and ferocity in Mu Rong’s eyes.

He would stop at nothing to achieve his goal even if it meant killing his companions!

Mu Rong had gone crazy!

“Mu Ningxue is right. I’m already half a prisoner in the alliance. If the Extreme South Emperor doesn’t die, I must bear the blame. I will be ridiculed by my peers and be abandoned by everyone. I thought you could help me escape this situation, but I didn’t expect you to be so stupid. I’ll give you one last chance. If you still don’t make the right decision, you can stay here forever as a frozen specimen!” Mu Rong’s aura got stronger.

He was like a magical beast that had been frozen for thousands of years. He had accumulated a lot of resentment and was about to vent it.

Wei Guang realized that Mu Rong was going to fight to the death. He would not hesitate to kill him even though he was a member of the China Forbidden Curse Association.

He glanced at Mu Ningxue and lowered his voice. “Run.”

Mu Ningxue ran in the other direction of the Ice Cave, but the Holy Ruler, Yvette, blocked her path.

Yvette smiled like a creep. “You don’t seem to know your status. How can you compare yourself to Lady Karolina with your identity and say such bold things? Lady Karolina is the bright moon in the sky, and you’re just a stinking firefly!”

Yvette used her magic, and layers of Flaming Sun Ripples appeared on her body. They were like golden shackles and chains that trapped Mu Ningxue’s in every direction.

Mu Ningxue was prepared. In fact, from the moment she stepped into theIce Cave, she had felt as though she was walking into a beast’s lair. She knew they would attack if she refused whatever they wanted to do to her.

The Wind Wings appeared on her back. The white wind feathers formed a small storm that swept away the Flaming Sun Ripples and gave Mu Ningxue time and speed. Then, a slender white shadow passed over her. Mu Ningxue rolled Yvette up like a tornado.

Yvette spun in the air and smashed to the ground. Now, she was angry. She held a Holy Judgment Spear and threw it toward Mu Ningxue with force.

When the Holy Judgement reached Mu Ningxue, it suddenly turned into a cage spear, trapping her inside like a birdcage.

Yvette smiled. Her smile froze on her face when she realized that her cage hadn’t trapped Mu Ningxue but just her afterimage composed of white wing feathers. The real Mu Ningxue had long been outside the cage and was getting farther.

Yvette was stunned. She never thought that her magic would not work on Mu Ningxue.

“You can’t escape from here!” Lady Karolina shouted. She raised her hands as if she was holding something.

A turbid halo appeared between her hands. It turned out she was holding a turbid crystal ball.

She turned the turbid crystal ball formed by the halo upside down, and the space suddenly began to twist strangely. It was like water was being churned in the well, except the space around them churned in this instant.

The process was short. Something rang in Yvette’s head. When she came back to her senses, she found herself standing at the entrance of the cave blocked by the ice rocks.

Mu Ningxue, who had fled in the direction of another entrance, also seemed to have been transformed by space. She returned to where she had stood before and faced Mu Rong and Lady Karolina!

“Chaos Order!”

Mu Ningxue was solemn. Lady Karolina’s strength was higher than that of Mu Rong. Her Wind Element gave her an advantage in speed, but it was nothing compared with Lady Karolina’s Chaos Element. Lady Karolina could change her direction and pull her to whichever spot she wanted.

She could not leave.

“Go. Don’t disappoint me this time,” Lady Karolina said to Yvette. She was arrogant and ordered people around while not doing any of it herself.

Yvette nodded and approached Mu Ningxue again.

Mu Ningxue did not plan to escape anymore. She twisted her wrist. An ice sword suddenly appeared in the air and attacked Yvette.

An Ice Moon Arc accompanied the attack. Yvette summoned a heavy golden wall to resist the power of Mu Ningxue’s sword.

However, Mu Ningxue was very handy with her magic. She crushed the sword and turned it into countless ice blades. The ice blades that covered the entire cave were like stars sinking into the sea in midsummer. They were beautiful and filled with killing intent.

Yvette was horrified. She had to use magic armor to protect herself from severe injuries. Mu Ningxue’s ice blades injured her. She could not dodge or defend against the attack, let alone take down Mu Ningxue. She could not even ensure her own safety against Mu Ningxue’s fierce ice magic.

Mu Ningxue’s ice magic was endless, and Yvette could not fight against her at all.

Yvette felt humiliated. ‘How could I be so vulnerable against Mu Ningxue?’
