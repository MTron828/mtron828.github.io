Mo Fan quickly backed away, but the eyes kept following him around. The more he looked at them, the stronger the fear inside his heart grew.

Mo Fan forcibly closed his eyes. His surroundings turned pitch-black. He initially thought he would be able to escape the stare of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus, but the ghastly eyes continued to appear in his mind and project fear into his heart. He started having trouble breathing properly.

Most terrifyingly, there were no longer just six eyes. It was like a dozen or more Dreadful Curse Cerberus were surrounding him. Over a hundred eyes engulfed in flames were staring at him. It was so horrifying that it felt like his spirit would scatter like ash!

Mo Fan was utterly spooked. The Eyes of Terror of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus were overwhelming. Even he was feeling tortured, despite his fourth-stage mental strength.

As Mo Fan was struggling to break free from the fear inflicted on him, his necklace started emitting a watery blue light. It began to spread like ripples, each wave soothing Mo Fan’s heart as it was on the verge of being crushed into pieces!

Mo Fan finally regained consciousness after some time. He could not open his eyes, yet he could hear Mu Ningxue’s scream.

“Mo Fan! Wake up!” Mu Ningxue was shoving Mo Fan heavily. She sounded panicked.

Mo Fan opened his eyes. Before he could come to his senses, he was shocked to see the body of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus looming up right before him. It had raised its burning, rotten paws right above him.

Mo Fan’s heart pounded. He glanced at Mu Ningxue, who did not escape to save herself. He calmed his thoughts in the nick of time.

“Grab onto me!” Mo Fan reached his hand out and hugged Mu Ningxue around her waist.

Mu Ningxue shuddered when Mo Fan wrapped his arm around her waist, but she knew now was not the time to complain.

“Blink!” Mo Fan endured both the physical and mental pressure he was under and forcibly cast the Advanced Spell of the Space Element.

Silver stars rapidly appeared and formed Star Orbits and Star Patterns under Mo Fan’s feet. Even though their pace was dazzling, the Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ paws were only inches away...

“How naive, are you seriously trying to use the Advanced Space Spell in the short period of time you have!?” Houndman scoffed disdainfully.

The Space Element was regarded as the most complicated Element. Not many people were able to use it adeptly or perfectly master it. A Space Mage needed a lot of time to practice and improve the Space Element, which basically meant they would have to sacrifice the time to practice their other Elements!

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus stomped down. The ground cracked open as rock splinters scattered in all directions. The force continued to spread out, knocking the trees down. The force almost razed the entire woods to the ground. The area affected by the blow was over two hundred meters across!

The silver light dots were as small as fireflies, and swayed and dimmed amid the flying dust. The Dreadful Curse Cerberus slowly raised its front paw...

Normally, the Dreadful Curse Cerberus enjoyed the sensation of the viscous blood of its prey sticking onto its paws whenever it crushed them into pulp. Even though its prey was humans this time, meaning there would not be much blood, it was more satisfying for the creature, knowing that it had avenged its fallen comrade!

The creature lifted its paws half a meter into the air, yet there was nothing below it, apart from some rock splinters, not even a single drop of blood.

Houndman and the Dreadful Curse Cerberus were shocked. Master and servant finally realized their prey had already escaped!

“How did he do it!?” Houndman exclaimed.

Regardless of how quick Blink was, he still needed a certain time to channel the spell, especially when it involved constructing a Star Constellation made up of 343 Stars. How could the kid possibly cast the spell so quickly?

“Flame sword!”

Mo Fan suddenly appeared behind the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. He swung a huge burning sword forward in the shape of a crescent.

The damage of the flame sword had nothing to do with its sharpness. It was purely abusing the explosive energy when the flames were compressed together. It immediately unleashed its destructive force when it landed on the Dreadful Curse Cerberus.

The flames of the Ardent Sunset and Calamity Fire spread rapidly after knocking the Dreadful Curse Cerberus flying. The creature was soon engulfed in flames. It cried wildly as it was being burned by the flames.

“It looks like it didn’t have time to set up its barrier!” Mu Ningxue realized the creature’s weakness when she saw the scorched wound left by the flame sword on the Dreadful Curse Hell Hound.

“Mm, it’s very likely that using the barrier consumes a lot of energy, so it can’t afford to use it all the time. If that’s the case, we might have a chance to kill it!” Mo Fan said.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus had failed to react to Mo Fan’s surprise attack. The flame sword had left a huge wound on its body. Furthermore, it was continuing to burn and worsen the injury. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were in an advantageous position!

“Damn it!” Houndman clenched his teeth. Words were not needed to describe how agitated he was.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus should have been able to kill the two young Mages very easily, yet they were still standing after so long!

“Dreadful Curse Glare!” Houndman ordered.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ eyes began to emit light rays at Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Nyx Regime!” Mo Fan reacted swiftly. A dark aura loomed over the place and soon consumed the area in pitch-black darkness.

The Nyx Regime was Mo Fan’s Dark Domain. Any attacks directed at Mo Fan’s mind were greatly weakened within it. Most importantly, the Dreadful Curse Cerberus was having trouble tracking Mo Fan down in the darkness, so it had no chance of inflicting fear on him!

Mo Fan would not fall for the same trick twice!

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ eyes flickered wildly, yet it could not find exactly where Mo Fan had gone to. Mo Fan constantly changed his positions in the Nyx Regime. He appeared beside the Dreadful Curse Cerberus suddenly and threw a fiery fist at it.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus was struggling to see properly. It subconsciously unleashed a bloody aura when it saw the light of the flames.

The bloody aura formed a powerful barrier around the Dreadful Curse Cerberus and Houndman. However, Houndman was angry when he realized the attack that Mo Fan had just executed was extremely weak. It would not have inflicted any damage on the Dreadful Curse Cerberus even without the protection of the barrier!

“Have a piece of my strongest destructive spell!” an excited voice said from another direction.

Houndman turned around and immediately saw brilliant flames approaching from the dark. A strong wave of heat preceded it.

It was an attack made up of three types of flames. Houndman quickly warned the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. The creature let out a roar and strengthened the protection around itself.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus had taken a serious blow from the flame sword. Its strength would fall significantly if it kept on receiving those attacks.

With a slight breeze, a little blast landed on the Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ thick barrier.

The flames crackled and swayed wildly. It looked like mere firecrackers thrown at an indestructible mountain wall when compared to the enormous body of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus.

Houndman’s face reddened in rage when he saw the little spark. The heads of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus slanted to the side too, as if they were completely confused.

The strongest destructive spell?

Houndman immediately realized he had been tricked again. His heart was raging in his chest!

“Ice Hollow Roses!”

Mu Ningxue secretly completed her Ice Spell. Several icy roses suddenly blossomed close to the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. The icy thorns appeared right when the Dreadful Curse Cerberus withdrew its barrier. The icy roses turned into deadly weapons pouring down on the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. The creature was soon covered in bleeding holes!

The holes were tiny, yet it was still stunning to see almost a thousand holes poked in the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. The creature was covered in blood. Meanwhile, the passive ability of every Ice Spell, the penetrating frost, was digging into the Dreadful Curse Cerberus’s body through the wounds...

The creature’s blood flow began to slow down. It was clearly not in favor of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. Its movement speed was reduced under the effects of the Ice Magic!

The wound inflicted by the flames was already hindering its movements, as whenever it tried to accumulate force in its back legs, the wound would split open and bleed. Now the frost was penetrating the creature’s body too! The creature was greatly weakened by its injuries.

Houndman was sullen. The Dreadful Curse Cerberus was supposed to be unbeatable when facing Advanced Mages with its Blood Barrier. He never thought he would be tricked by Mo Fan’s shameless moves twice...

Houndman just could not understand. Wasn’t Mo Fan supposed to be the strongest participant in the World College Tournament? How could he be so shameless in a fight? He was yelling so loud that he was using his strongest destructive spell! Both Houndman and the Dreadful Curse Cerberus were so convinced by it, yet it was just a tiny little fireball that was only good for illuminating the area. When Houndman thought about how the little fireball had wasted the creature’s important Blood Barrier, he had an urge to turn into a Dreadful Curse Hound to tear Mo Fan into pieces himself!
