In a local Xiaxi cuisine restaurant, Mo Fan, Mu Bai, Zhao Kunsan, Wang Pangzi, and Zhou Ming were seated together. This was most likely the first gathering between the old classmates from high school since the calamity of Bo City. Mo Fan was relieved to see their familiar faces.

“Mo Fan, isn’t your girlfriend coming too?” asked Zhao Kunsan.

“Oh, she already went back,” Mo Fan knew Zhao Kunsan was referring to Liu Ru.

Liu Ru had never met Mo Fan’s friends. Besides, they would most likely talk about their past during the time in high school, thus she felt like it was better not to join the dinner. She went to visit Su Xiaoluo instead, checking on the settlement of the villagers.

“You have a girlfriend now?” asked Zhou Ming, blinking her large eyes.

“Not really... by the way, our Zhou Ming has grown prettier. Why didn’t any of you target her?” asked Mo Fan.

Wang Pangzi and Zhao Kunsan uttered hollow laughs. They did want to chase her, yet none of them was an Intermediate Magician. They might even be stuck in the Basic Level for the rest of their lives. On the other hand, Zhou Ming was already a top student in the Ancient Capital Institute.

“How was your training in the Goose Tower?” asked Mu Bai.

Zhou Ming was dressed in casual clothes today, yet her eyes still had the usual determination and pride of a youthful girl in them. One could easily tell that she was excited to see Mo Fan after such a long time, as she kept asking him questions.

“How can we talk about cultivation in front of Mo Fan?” Zhou Ming raised her tone and rolled her eyes.

“Why not, it’s fine... I’ve got more Elements to train, so my cultivation is a bit mixed up,” said Mo Fan humbly.

“Really, let me see what your level is now.” It felt like Zhou Ming had purposely led the conversation until now, and blurted out quicklyafter Mo Fan took the bait.

Zhou Ming quickly inspected him.

Mo Fan did not prepare himself. He could sense Zhou Ming’s will roaming wildly in his Spiritual World. The process would not do any harm to him, as long as the person was not a Psychic.

“Huh, it’s only a Level Two Nebula!” Zhou Ming’s will was interrupted by Mo Fan as she was sensing one of Mo Fan’s Nebulas, leaving the girl pouting unhappily.

“Hehe, I never said I’m strong,” Mo Fan wore a humble smile.

“Damn, a Level Two Nebula is already very strong!” cried Wang Pangzi, who looked as if he had lost completely.

“Zhou Ming, does that mean you’ve reached Level Three?” asked Mu Bai, raising his brows. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“No way! Once I learn the Fiery Fist: Nine Halls, I’ll be able to handle the Corpse Generals. My ranking will climb higher, too!” said Zhou Ming.

Curious after hearing Zhou Ming’s grumble, Mo Fan asked, “Wait, your ranking is decided by defeating Corpse Generals?”

“The undead, to be precise,” Mu Bai corrected. He continued on when he saw the same confused look on Mo Fan’s face. “Instead of having the students fighting one another in meaningless duels, it’s better to simply let the students put their efforts into dealing with the undead. It’s simply impossible to kill all the undead around here. The institute has decided to give the students scores based on the number of undead they have killed. Those with higher scores are ranked higher. As a result, those who are trying to get into the Nomination Preliminaries wait outside the walls like they are on steroids.”

Mo Fan nodded. It turned out that different institutes had different systems. The institute here in the Ancient Capital was rather intriguing, ranking the students based on the undead they had eliminated.

“Apart from the rankings, the students are asked to go on duty on the outer walls every now and then. It’s my turn tonight, but since you’re here, I snuck alll the way here from very far away instead...” added Zhou Ming unpleasantly.

“I”m flattered, then,” Mo Fan chuckled.

“Have you collected enough scores? If you didn’t have enough, you won’t get the resources from the school,” said Mu Bai.

“The monthly resources aren’t really a big deal. It’s rare for us to be able to gather together. In fact, I did miss you all,” said Zhou Ming.

Everyone fell silent after hearing the words, but somehow, they all agreed with Zhou Ming.

In high school, everyone would Awaken their Magic, study about Magic, and work hard together to achieve better results. They would go train in the wilds together, but many years had passed in the blink of an eye. As Magicians, especially after they achieved the higher levels, their lives were not without sorrow and anxiety, as they had once expected. Instead, they engaged in even more life and death situations.

It did make sense. Headmaster Zhu had told everyone the responsibilities of a Magician since day one of stepping into their high school.

Commoners might be able to live a peaceful life, but that was not the case for Magicians!

Mo Fan had witnessed countless deaths in the past few years. He had witnessed the deaths of the villagers just yesterday, but he still had to eat, sleep, and continue on with his life. What could he do?

“By the way, didn’t Xu Zhaoting go to the same school as you?” Zhao Kunsan interrupted Zhou Ming’s topic after he recalled something.

Mu Bai glared at Zhao Kunsan, as he was well aware of what happened to Xu Zhaoting.

Does he really have to mention it now!?

Wang Pangzi and Xu Zhaoting were extremely close to one another. When Zhao Kunsan mentioned Xu Zhaoting’s name, everyone could see the fat on Wang Pangzi’s face shuddering.

After taking a deep breath, Wang Pangzi asked Mo Fan sternly, “After all this time, I still have no idea how my brother died. Mo Fan, you surely know about it, right? It’s fine, I just want to know the truth.”

Mo Fan’s heart sank as he recalled the incident related to Xu Zhaoting. He tried his best to remain calm and replied, “I burned him.”

“You... burned him?” Everyone looked at Mo Fan with wide eyes.

Mo Fan told everyone the whole incident, leaving them speechless for a very long time.

“Sigh, forget it, I bet he would still choose the same thing if he were given another chance. I know him too well,” sighed Wang Pangzi.

“The Black Vatican is too damnable! If I have the chance, I’ll kill them all too!” declared Zhou Ming, clenching her teeth.

The whole room was filled with anger and hatred when the Black Vatican was mentioned. They clearly knew that they were no match for the Black Vatican with their current strength. They could only try harder to improve their cultivation, and eliminate the Black Vatican when they started stirring up chaos again.

“Damn it, I’m furious just thinking about them! Zhou Ming, aren’t you on duty tonight? Why don’t we go to the walls with you and vent our anger on the undead. Consider it as us doing a favor for the Ancient Capital and the country too!” suggested Wang Pangzi.

“So we’re not going to karaoke?” said Zhao Kunsan.

“Karaoke my ass, it’s meaningless that we simply have to eat and go singing karaoke like everyone else when we gather with old classmates. It’s more exciting to kill the undead and level up. We’re Magicians!” said Wang Pangzi righteously.

“I don’t mind.”

“My hands are itching too,” said Mo Fan with a short laugh.

Mo Fan still had a grudge against the undead due to what had happened to the villagers. He could not wait to kill some undead to get his revenge!
