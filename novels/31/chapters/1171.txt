Asha’ruiya looked at Izisha, who was lying in the leaf-shaped coffin. She felt like the woman was only asleep. Her brows were shuddering slightly, and the imperious look on her face stopped Asha’ruiya from moving any closer. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Asha’ruiya subconsciously took a few steps back. She turned toward the Vice Hall Master who was guarding the place.

The Vice Hall Master did not speak. Great Muse Mellaura’s voice was coming from the corridor. She hurried over to the coffin and took a close look at Izisha’s remains before letting out a relieved sigh.

“You already knew?” Asha’ruiya asked.

“Yes,” Great Muse Mellaura nodded.

“Do you seriously think she is the only one that can bring glory to you? In my eyes, she’s leading the Parthenon Temple into a deep abyss instead!” Asha’ruiya said bluntly.

“Asha’ruiya, considering how many years you have spent at the Parthenon Temple, you should be aware that the Parthenon Temple’s status has been declining over the years. It’s not just because we have yet to elect our new Goddess, but because our leaders in the past were too weak, too merciful. Countless people across the world are suffering, the Black Vatican has been stirring up troubles, evil power is spreading its influence, plagues have destroyed lives, and the demon creatures are on the verge of making their moves. Our natural foe, the Tyrant Titans, has been restless too. Think of the time when Izisha was in power: our Parthenon Temple was never afraid of any country, and never compromised with any of them!” Mellaura said.

Only Asha’ruiya, Mellaura, and Vice Hall Master Lanjin, who was guarding Izisha’s remains, were present.

Vice Hall Master Lanjin was not any weaker than Haylon. He was an old knight, and he rarely spoke.

“Asha’ruiya, you always have a clear view of things; you should pick your side when you still have the time. Otherwise, you will lose all your footing in the Parthenon Temple,” Mellaura said.

“It seems like Andi died at your hands, too. You pretended to vow loyalty and devotion to Andi, but you were trying to kill her all along!” Asha’ruiya let out a hollow laugh.

“Andi was smart. She knew she didn’t lose to the other Saintesses, but had lost to her master, so she chose to end her life that way,” Mellaura said.

“How about Panijia?” Asha’ruiya asked.

“Her? Couldn’t you tell that she has been one of us right from the beginning?” Mellaura smiled.

“Ye Xinxia didn’t kill her, it was Panijia that killed herself, right?” Asha’ruiya deduced.

“Yes, the whole thing needed a fuse. The Hall Mother promoted Ye Xinxia to a Saintess, so we needed a reasonable excuse to judge her guilty. Don’t worry, as long as Izisha reclaims the role of the Goddess, Panijia’s death is basically her taking a nap. Izisha won’t allow a loyal disciple to die like that. Besides, she won’t hold onto the role of the Goddess forever, she needs a successor,” Mellaura said with a smile.

Mellaura was standing right beside the coffin. She saw Izisha’s body healing up completely, and her tightly-shut eyes blinking.

Mellaura was overjoyed by the sight of it. She had long waited for this day!

“You make it sound like it’s all for the sake of the Parthenon Temple, but in my opinion, you are just unwilling to give up your power. You enjoy hoarding the great authority!” Asha’ruiya said.

“The younger generation is unreliable, so we have no choice but to put in more effort for a few more years. So, have you made up your mind? Asha’ruiya, you’re smarter than Andi; you have been neutral all along, not posing any threat to either side, but you know we won’t allow it. You will either submit to us, or be annihilated!” Mellaura said.

Asha’ruiya glanced at Izisha’s body and said coldly, “I think Salan is still too merciful, since she didn’t chop Izisha into minced meat!”

Mellaura’s face darkened immediately. The disrespectful words from Asha’ruiya conveyed her stance.

“Do you really think she has the chance!? Izisha will surely pay her back tenfold!” Mellaura snapped furiously.

Asha’ruiya backed away. A thin, black sword suddenly appeared in her hand. She rapidly dashed toward Izisha’s coffin with a flicker and stabbed right at Izisha’s forehead.

The lifeless body suddenly opened its eyes, staring right at Asha’ruiya with a cold and merciless expression!

“How bold of you!” Mellaura yelled.

Vice Hall Master Lanjin did not expect Asha’ruiya to do such thing. He quickly went over to the coffin and unleashed a golden light to protect Izisha’s body!

Asha’ruiya quickly withdrew her sword as if she already knew her plan would not work. Her foot left a black rose on the ground as she rapidly disappeared into the dark corridor...

Mellaura and Vice Hall Master Lanjin were too preoccupied with Izisha’s safety. They did not expect Asha’ruiya to be so cunning. She pretended that she was determined to take down Izisha with her, yet she was actually planning to escape!

“Chase her, don’t let that little b**ch get away and ruin our plan!” Mellaura ordered.

Vice Hall Master Lanjin disappeared with a flicker, leaving an afterimage behind. He quickly chased after Asha’ruiya.

—

Vice Hall Master Lanjin was incredibly powerful. He soon caught up to Asha’ruiya and stood in front of her with a cold face. He did not speak, but his eyes displayed a strong murderous intent.

“Even you are willing to submit to them? Do you have any idea who the girl that was sentenced to Dark Execution is!?” Asha’ruiya asked, knowing she was no match for Vice Hall Master Lanjin.

“I have to make a choice!” Vice Hall Master Lanjin finally spoke.

“Izisha didn’t use the Spell of Resurrection of the Parthenon Temple, can’t you tell!?” Asha’ruiya said.

“I know, please apologize to Wen Tai on my behalf,” Vice Hall Master Lanjin raised his hand. A blue flame burned vigorously on his palm. Its light was shining upon Asha’ruiya’s pale face.

Asha’ruiya’s expression turned cold. Her eyes flickered icily.

A dark beam descended from the sky and covered Asha’ruiya. It turned into pieces of armor attached to Asha’ruiya’s body, granting her the power of darkness.

“It seems like you are involved with the evil forces, too,” Lanjin said calmly.

“The Parthenon Temple has turned into someone’s playground. Even if she has the upper hand, I will not surrender it readily!” Asha’ruiya drew her sword and stabbed forward. The dark light resembling a sword unleashed a devouring energy, forcing Lanjin to back away.

Lanjin used the fire as a shield to protect himself.

The energy of the dark light looked intimidating, yet it was actually just a diversion. By the time Lanjin refocused, Asha’ruiya had long vanished into thin air, leaving a trail of black wind behind.

—

Asha’ruiya escaped into the woods. She could sense Lanjin chasing after her like a wolf following the scent of its prey.

She looked into her surroundings and caught a glimpse of her sacred palace among the mountains, but it was no longer safe there. She had no idea how many people of the Parthenon Temple had submitted to Izisha. She would be their next target once Ye Xinxia died. Izisha would not allow any competitor to live!

The sky trembled under a deafening cry. The Black Totem Snake seemed to have broken through half of the magic formation. A small section of his body was already outside of the barrier.

Asha’ruiya clenched her teeth and sprinted rapidly toward the Black Totem Snake.

She had to rely on the Black Totem Snake’s power to leave the Parthenon Temple. The authorities of the Parthenon Temple had all submitted to Izisha. Even though she was a Saintess, they might still sentence her with a ridiculous accusation. It was the Parthenon Temple; only a few words were needed to sentence a person to death!

“Haylon, Shawshank, they are going to escape soon. I will strengthen the magic formation with my magic so it will destroy the snake!” Asha’ruiya arrived in front of the two Hall Masters.

“Saintess, it’s dangerous here; you should go somewhere safe,” a Golden Sun Knight spoke up.

“It’s fine, if we let them escape, the Parthenon Temple will be in disgrace,” Asha’ruiya said.

She seemed calm on the surface, yet she was actually quite worried that Haylon and Shawshank had submitted to Izisha. If so, she would have no chance of escaping.

“It doesn’t matter if they make it through the magic formation. My men are already waiting outside. They won’t be able to escape, but it will definitely help a lot if the Saintess is willing to strengthen the magic formation. This Totem Beast is quite tricky to deal with,” Haylon nodded, agreeing to let Asha’ruiya strengthen the magic formation.

The magic formation was Wen Tai’s work. It was Wen Tai that had set up the impenetrable defense for the Parthenon Temple. The man had given Asha’ruiya control of the magic formation, thus she was normally in charge of its maintenance.

Asha’ruiya headed toward the magic formation. Its energy was unable to distinguish between friendlies and enemies, yet it did not harm Asha’ruiya. It even cleared a path for her instead.

As soon as Asha’ruiya entered the magic formation, Lanjin arrived with a murderous aura and stared at Asha’ruiya, who had escaped into the magic formation.

“Why are you here? Aren’t you supposed to guard the Hall of the Goddess?” Haylon raised his brows and said in a displeased tone.

“Asha’ruiya has colluded with the Black Vatican and chopped Izisha’s remains into pieces. I have come to arrest her at Great Muse Mellaura’s order,” Lanjin said, as smoothly as if he had long come up with the excuse.
