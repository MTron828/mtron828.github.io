“Is that really necessary? It’s your own family business, the guest that Director Zhao personally went to receive must be very important. If your actions result in them being unable to reach a deal, you won’t be able to explain yourself to the clan master either,” the woman in the blue dress advised.

“Is that any of your concern?” Zhao Manyan snapped.

“Brother Zhao, let’s go to the next cabin. It’s not that bad either,” Mo Fan advised him.

“This is the one. Ask Zhao Youqian to discuss his business in the next cabin. It’s not like I’m here very often, I can pick whatever cabin I want. I don’t really care if it’s the royal cabin, I’m just displeased by your attitude. I can accept it if Zhao Youqian treats me like that, because he’s my elder brother, but who do you think you are, asking me to leave?” Zhao Manyan cursed her.

The mixed-blooded woman in the blue dress paled when she learned that Zhao Manyan was putting the blame on her. She did not argue with him further, but asked the rest of the staff to move the dishes to the next cabin.

“Don’t touch my delicious food and drinks, set some up in the next cabin yourself!” Zhao Manyan frowned and snapped coldly when he saw the staff trying to move the tables and chairs away too.

The eyes of the mixed-blooded woman flickered with hate, yet she knew it was unwise to argue with Zhao Manyan again. Regardless of what happened, Zhao Manyan was still the second son of the Zhao Clan’s leader. As hired personnel, it did not matter if she was in the right, she would most likely be punished anyway!

Seeing the look in the woman’s eyes, Mo Fan grabbed a bunch of grapes and started shoving them into his mouth. He looked at Zhao Manyan curiously and asked, “Do you have a grudge against her?”

“Grudge? Not really, I just don’t like my brother’s subordinates treating me like he did. If I don’t teach them a lesson, they might even forget that my surname is Zhao too!” Zhao Manyan spat.

“I guess a fuerdai like you does have the right to act arrogantly, but I bet you always get beaten up by your father!” Mo Fan chuckled.

“That was before, at least I’m a representative of the national team now. I no longer eat meals for free, do I?” Zhao Manyan said.

“No wonder a lazy man like you is surprisingly hardworking lately. If you weren’t on the national team, I bet you wouldn’t even dare vent your frustration on the woman like that,” Mo Fan snickered.

“Isn’t that true? I could endure it if they treated me like that in the past, since it’s true that I only know how to spend money and pick up chicks. I was up to no good them, but I’m now an Advanced Mage, a member on the national team, a future pillar of the country, and a rising star! Perhaps my father would even consider me as his successor, and yet my brother’s subordinates thought they could treat me like dirt!?” Zhao Manyan huffed.

“What’s that woman’s name? I can tell she’s going to complain to your brother,” Mo Fan said.

“I have no idea, but every person that works for my brother is the same, they all lack a good memory,” Zhao Manyan said.

——

Not long afterwards, Mo Fan heard footsteps walking on the rug outside the cabin. As Mo Fan was a Space Mage, he was fairly sensitive to even the slightest movements.

Judging from the footsteps, it was very likely that Zhao Youqian had received the important guest, and it seemed like the guest was actually a woman. Her footsteps were extremely light, like a noble cat walking past elegantly on the rug.

As Mo Fan expected, the two went into the next room. Mo Fan could vaguely sense the woman in the blue dress whispering something into Zhao Youqian’s ear. Zhao Youqian hesitated for a moment, before following his guest into the next room.

The VIP guest did not stay too long in the room. She left after a brief conversation.

The woman did not let Zhao Youqian send her off. She left the room on her own, as if she was heading for some other place in the San Marco Auction Hall.

——

In the next room, Zhao Youqian flung his hand and knocked an ornamental teacup to the floor with a thud.

He hit the cup hard, and it almost smashed into pieces even though it had fallen on the rug.

The waitress felt her heart ache. The cup was worth a few hundred thousand, and it was almost broken!

“Do you have the brain of a pig? You knew he came to mess with me, and you still didn’t know to invite him into the next room politely?” Zhao Youqian rose to his feet and scolded the woman in the blue dress.

“I...I didn’t know he was your brother,” the woman admitted softly.

“You’re stupid beyond belief! Even if you never met him in person, you should have seen his photos!” Zhao Youqian cursed.

“I’ve failed you.”

“She decisively rejected my offer that quickly. I wonder who she’s going to work with next, since she didn’t agree to work with me. Hopefully it’s not that old fox Cario! Why is it so hard to read her mind!?” Zhao Youqian mumbled to himself. He immediately fell silent as he started pondering about his guest’s attitude.

The woman in the blue dress was startled. She could not believe that a man who was on a tantrum just a second ago had immediately started to reflect on the meeting with his guest. The way he switched his focus was rather intimidating.

Zhao Manyan came into the room with a gloating grin. “Brother, I can tell that you failed to reach a deal just by looking at your face.”

Zhao Youqian lifted his gaze and glanced at the teacup on the ground. He instantly smiled, “Who the hell knocked the cup onto the ground? Quick, pick it up, it doesn’t look good. Oh Zhao Manyan, please don’t stir up trouble whenever I’m scheduled to meet with an important client. If you cross the line, I’ll surely go tell father about it, and you won’t be able to spend your allowance as you wish again.”

“The two rooms don’t really differ that much, and judging from how she rejected you so quickly, I bet she never had the intention to work with you right from the beginning. She was just being polite by coming here in person and telling you her decision. It has nothing to do with me, so please don’t put the blame on me. Besides, weren’t you supposed to prepare the room for me since I told you that I was coming over?” Zhao Manyan shrugged with the same gloating look.

“Fine, you’re right that it has nothing to do with you, but since I’ve failed to reach a deal, you won’t be getting any benefits either. I’m afraid the resources allocated to you next month will shrink greatly. Oh, leaving that aside, I’ve read your texts. You’re asking for a Soul-grade Lightning Seed?” Zhao Youqian said.

“Yeah, he’s looking for one, and he’s the person that provided the Dark Swordmaster’s corpse,” Zhao Manyan said, pointing at Mo Fan.

Zhao Youqian fixed his gaze on Mo Fan without showing any expression.

As a matter of fact, it was the first time that Zhao Youqian had really looked at Mo Fan.

“Impressive, able to acquire something like it at your age... a Soul-grade Lightning Seed huh, I’ll ask someone to look for one. I’ll get it for you if I find it, but I have limited funds for the time being, you’ll have to transfer me the money first,” Zhao Youqian said.

“Screw you, do you really think I won’t pay? Can’t you just pay for it in advance?” Zhao Manyan cursed.

“You never know,” Zhao Youqian chuckled.

“Take it,” Zhao Manyan shoved a card into Zhao Youqian’s hands roughly.

Zhao Youqian immediately checked the money inside the card and smacked his lips, “Oh Zhao Manyan, when can you be like him and earn me eight hundred and fifty million?”

“I was born to spend money. I believe the rate that I’m spending my money is going to put your ability to earn money to shame,” Zhao Manyan replied.

“By the way, I heard that you’re taking part in the World College Tournament, everyone in Venice has been discussing it. As your brother, I haven’t been doing my job well looking after you. I’ll find the best blacksmith in Venice to forge you a piece of defensive equipment, as a gift to wish you all the best in the tournament,” Zhao Youqian said.

“Don’t worry about it if it’s only a piece of junk.”

“The master in Venice only accepts jobs with a hundred million as the minimum unit.”

“Oh, I’ll gladly accept the gift of apology then.”

“You can think of it as a gift of apology for not treating you seriously. Do your best in the tournament, don’t let the clan master think the money invested in you is nothing but a waste,” Zhao Youqian said. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Who were you meeting just then?” Zhao Manyan switched the topic.

“A gorgeous lady, so beautiful that even a man like me is tempted.”

“Oh?” Zhao Manyan raised his brows.

He was extremely familiar with his elder brother. The man had never shown any interest in women, nor was he was interested in men. The only thing that he was interested in was money, especially when a crazy large amount of it was being transferred into his account...

If a woman was beautiful enough to fascinate Zhao Youqian, she had to be a disastrous-level beauty. If Zhao Manyan had known beforehand, he would have waited at the entrance instead. Whenever Zhao Manyan was in a bad mood, he would feel a lot better after seeing a glamorous lady.

“What’s her name?” Mo Fan asked. A unique scent was lingering in the air in the room. Mo Fan felt it was oddly familiar.

“Asha’ruiya,” Zhao Youqian replied, not bothering to hide the identity of his client.

“Oh, ok,” Mo Fan said and sniffed again.

“She is worthy to be my woman.” A smile surfaced on Zhao Youqian’s face.

“I can tell that she doesn’t even want to talk to you, judging by your words,” Zhao Manyan mocked him.

“I can’t help if that’s what you think. Speaking of which, your habit of eating junk food hasn’t changed at all. Look at all the girlfriends you had at school,” Zhao Youqian replied mockingly, even though he sounded like an elder brother caring about his little brother.

The words immediately infuriated Zhao Manyan.

“I heard someone mention to me that the girl from the Mu Clan is also on the national team. If you are really capable, just settle her so the two clans can unite through your marriage. We have the money, and the Mu Clan has the power. We could easily rise as a powerhouse back!” Zhao Youqian said.

“Are you referring to Mu Ningxue?” Zhao Manyan was startled.

“Mu Ningxue? Are you being serious? Even the Zhou Clan doesn’t dare to take her, I forgot what the other girl’s name was...”

“Mu Tingying?” Mo Fan hinted.

“Yes, that’s her; settle her, and you’ll be doing the clan a great favor even if you happen to embarrass yourself in the World College Tournament,” Zhao Youqian told him.

“I wouldn’t want her, even if she volunteered!” Zhao Manyan rejected instantly.
