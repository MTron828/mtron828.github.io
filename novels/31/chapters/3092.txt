3093 Under The Forbidden Curse

“I’m going to shatter the Hexagon Brand in “Sky Holy City”. Mu Ningxue quickened her pace as she headed to the reflected formation.

“Hold on.” Ye Xinxia stopped Mu Ningxue.

When their palms met, Mu Ningxue felt as if she was surrounded by a gush of spring-like energy. She stared at Ye Xinxia in surprise. Ye Xinxia closed her eyes and focused on casting the Blessing of Soul Rain on Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue had exhausted her energy when she shot Fahl to death with the arrow. Even her own soul had recoiled. Whenever she performed some powerful spell, she felt a bit dizzy. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

!!

After she was showered by Ye Xinxia’s Blessing of Soul Rain, it rejuvenated her tired and weakened soul. Mu Ningxue felt her power recovering.

Her soul injury healed, and she no longer felt exhausted. Her magic was rejuvenated within a very short time. She felt as if she would never run out of the powerful spells, regardless of how frequently she performed them.

Mu Ningxue’s complexion improved. However, she noticed that Ye Xinxia looked tired.

“I just need some rest.” Ye Xinxia cast the Blessing of Soul Rain on herself. It was clear to see that she was also slowly recuperating.

The flaw of the Blessing Element Magic was that it consumed massive energy when one performed the spell. There was a limit to the usage of Blessing Element Magic in a war. Even if one possessed the indestructible Divine Soul that came from Parthenon Temple’s Blessing Element Magic, it still drained one’s energy.

Mu Ningxue’s soul was so powerful that she had reached the extreme realm. Therefore, Ye Xinxia exhausted a lot of her own magic and energy to restore Mu Ningxue’s soul.

“I’ll take down Michael.” Mu Ningxue said firmly.

“Great. I’ll hold back Ramiel’s army,” said Ye Xinxia.

Ye Xinxia rested for a moment, and then she immediately headed toward Ramiel.

Ramiel stood there motionlessly. He had no intention of laying his hands on Ye Xinxia. He watched her as he approached. He remained calm and quiet.

Since Ramiel was not going to do the talking, Ye Xinxia decided she would.

Ye Xinxia was aware that Ramiel was the guardian of the Holy City. Even at that moment, Ramiel refused to let the army of the Holy Guardian Mages, the Holy Judges, and the Heresy Judgment get involved in the battle. He did not want the clergymen to die a tragic death.

Mu Ningxue’s single arrow could wipe out thousands of clergymen. Ramiel refused to let his army be sacrificed just because of a fight among the rulers.

Ye Xinxia was aware that the moment the situation was out of control, the massive priesthood army waiting above “Sky Holy City” would descend to the land like a cluster of falling stars. By then, the battle would last longer and result in more casualties.

“Ramiel, you and I are the last people who want this battle to go on. The Parthenon Temple Army is on the way from the northern coast of the Mediterranean. The number of the army is no less than those in the European countries, all combined,” said Ye Xinxia.

“Are you threatening me? Holy City is not afraid of any forces. Even if the Parthenon Temple Army attacks us, our Holy Army will bury them in this plain!” replied Ramiel coldly.

“My father died because of your foolishness and corruption. He willingly fell into the dark hell and went through suffering to protect the holy land. If you truly think Michael is the one standing guard over the portal to the darkness, I think there’s no use for this conversation. We will bring our grudges to an end today!” said Ye Xinxia harshly.

‘What has Michael done?’

Regardless of how ambitious Michael was, he had only killed a Chinese Underworld King, a living being who could become the Dark King, an Undead who still had his heart in the holy land. Once a living being became the Dark King, he could break through the portal of darkness and allow his Dark Army to run wild all over the countries.

Wen Tai was already the Dark King. And he was standing guard over the portal to the darkness.

The leader of the Parthenon Temple had made a huge sacrifice, but why did the Holy City abandon him?

Today, it was Mo Fan’s in the same place. He was an expert who had stopped the attack of the Ocean Demons in his country. During the hearings, thousands of people who were grateful to him came to Holy City to give their testimonies and begged the city to forgive him.

However, Holy City refused to listen to them.

Even though ten out of the eleven stones were white and showed that Mo Fan was not guilty, Michael insisted on going his own way! Who exactly was the one who disobeyed the rules and made an enemy of the world?

“Ramiel, can’t you see it? Although Michael can bring the Holy City endless glory, he builds it on the foundation of a falling world. By then, the more you shine, the more the people will hate you!” said Ye Xinxia.

“You’ve invaded the city. You betrayed us. I won’t negotiate with a Goddess who is bent on making an enemy with the city. Michael does things for the sake of the Holy City, and so do I. We share the same goal. You can’t persuade me otherwise.” Ramiel had his own thoughts. He chose to work with Michael.

“I am not here to persuade you out of your faith. However, I want us to agree on just one rule,” said Ye Xinxia calmly.

Ye Xinxia was a Psychic Element Mage. She knew that Ramiel was more resolute than Michael. Ramiel refused to put up with betrayers, even if it meant stopping the battle.

She knew that once the Parthenon Temple Army arrived, Ramiel would give his order to his Holy Army without hesitation. By then, it would be real bloodshed!

“What is that?” Ramiel frowned.

He had no intention to find out more about it. However, the person before him was, after all, the ruler of the Parthenon Temple.

Ye Xinxia was different from the previous Goddesses. The position of the Goddess for her term had been on hold for many years. Parthenon Temple had been without a leader and at war for a very long time.

The Goddess who was able to stand out in the darkest period in Parthenon Temple must have mastered the entire situation and eliminated her rivals.

Parthenon Temple had been in chaos because they had no leader. It had not been easy to finally have a Goddess, so they were now more unified than ever.

Ye Xinxia was Wen Tai’s daughter. She possessed the Divine Soul since her birth. She put an end to the chaotic era of the Parthenon Temple.

If the Holy City were to start a war with the Parthenon Temple, the Holy City would suffer a great loss even if it achieved the final victory. It would take them a long time to recover.

Moreover, the Parthenon Temple could never be destroyed. It would continue the fight with Holy City. The battle could last for years, decades, centuries, and even millenniums.

Parthenon Temple held a grudge against the Holy City because of Wen Tai’s death. Today, the Goddess’ beloved one was to be executed without care once again. Parthenon temple saw this as a deliberate provocation from the Holy City.

Provoking the people’s anger was the scariest thing to do. They would not question their ruler’s decision to declare war. Instead, they would fight to the end.

Ramiel knew about the consequences. The last thing he wanted was for the Holy City to fall. He would do anything to prevent that.

Therefore, he asked Ye Xinxia about the rule she wanted to set to avoid the said consequences.

“Mages below the Forbidden Curse level cannot be involved in the battle. Parthenon Temple will stay on the plains. They will not enter the city. Likewise, your Holy Army cannot set foot on the land, too. They must stay in the “Sky Holy City” like the rest of the citizens. You and I can die in this battle, but the foundation of the Holy City and Parthenon Temple must be preserved.”
