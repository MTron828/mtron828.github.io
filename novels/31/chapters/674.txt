“The plan is to escape with the minority, but can we actually make it?”

“Go north, and there’s still a chance, even though a lot will die, and those who survived are basically lingering on with their last breath of life. The city is gone, the people are dead, is there really any meaning to live still?” Commander Lu Xu sighed.

“The people who went out are not back yet. Not sure how Du Xiao is doing, Zhu Meng, Yao Ting, Shi Zheng... they are still out there. They don’t want to leave on their own. They are trying to bring more people back to the inner city. The rest of us that stayed are completely worn out, injured, ran out of energy, or in charge of giving orders,” said Fei Jiao.

“Hopefully he can do it...” said the mysterious man all of a sudden.

“Are you referring to Fang Gu?”

The mysterious man shook his head, but he did not respond.

A smaller space was usually less stable. When strong sonic waves, stomps, and energy ripples traveled across the place, the whole space would shake hard and begin to collapse like a structure that could not bear its weight.

Mo Fan had no clue what the pillars supporting the space were, but he clearly sensed that the space was about to be destroyed by the overwhelming numbers of the skeleton army!

White skeletons, red eyes...

The skeletons joined together into a huge forest of bones. Their red eyes were flickering coldly, like stars in the sky!

Mo Fan’s heart beat heavily. He had never trembled like he was now even when he was involved in lots of dangerous situations in the past. His blood was close to freezing from the terrifying chill. Every inch of his cells was shrinking in fear.

Zhang Xiaohou, Liu Ru and Su Xiaoluo stood behind Mo Fan. Their hearts were jumping out of their chests. Their breathing had stopped when he saw the astonishing sight before them!

Normally, they would subconsciously figure out a way to handle the situation in front of them to guarantee their survival. However, they had lost the ability to think after seeing the skeleton army. Their minds had gone blank.

“Run, run, run to the back!” Mo Fan’s voice awakened the three people who were lost in a daze.

Zhang Xiaohou, Liu Ru and Su Xiaoluo did not hesitate. They immediately turned around and ran.

The undead army was in front. There was still room behind them, at least it would give them more time before they were devoured by the army skeleton.

The Swift Star Wolf carried Su Xiaoluo and Liu Ru. Zhang Xiaohou was using his Wind Track and Earth Wave. They quickly ran over a few hundred meters away.

However, Zhang Xiaohou soon discovered something out of place. He turned around and saw Mo Fan still standing in the same place.

“Brother Fan!” “Mo Fan!” Liu Ru and Zhang Xiaohou yelled out simultaneously.

“I don’t know how long I can last, but you try your best to find the exit! Don’t say anything; if you’re quick enough, I might be able to survive!...” Mo Fan did not turn his head around. He told them his decision over the loud roars of the undead.

The truth was, Mo Fan knew he was only deceiving himself and the others. They had already checked the direction they came from. There was no exit there, and there was not a lot of space, either. They would hit a wall in a few kilometers. Even though the place outside the wall looked the same, if they tried to break through it with brute force, what lay ahead would be a storm of reality that could tear Super Creatures into pieces!

There was no escape. Mo Fan was well aware of that.

However, Mo Fan was reluctant to sit on the ground and wait for his death. No way!

If God wanted him dead, he would simply throw his fist at Him, let alone these undead!

—

The army of skeletons was huge. They could trample a mountain range into flat land.

More than twenty thousand glowing eyes were densely clustered together. It was Mo Fan’s first time being looked at by almost ten thousand pairs of eyes. Their murderous aura was strong enough to freeze space. Those with weak spirits would even be torn into pieces on the spot!

“BrotherFan, you’ve said it, we’ll live and die together...” Zhang Xiaohou would never leave Mo Fan behind. He wanted to turn back and fight together with Mo Fan.

He would kill as much as he could. He would not allow these skeletons to trample their dignity as Magicians so easily!

“Nightmare!”

Zhang Xiaohou had just turned around when he looked into Liu Ru’s colorful pupils. His immediately felt heavy-headed, as his soul could not resist her power.

Zhang Xiaohou forced himself to stay awake, but the drowsiness grew stronger. He saw Mo Fan walking toward him in his blurred vision, he had decided to run away together with them...

Zhang Xiaohou was relieved, and lowered his guard. His body dropped to the ground as he no longer resisted Liu Ru’s hypnosis.

Liu Ru tossed Zhang Xiaohou onto the Swift Star Wolf. Her beautiful face had an unwilling look.

Mo Fan was Liu Ru’s senior, hence when he gave the command, she had no choice but to obey. Liu Ru wanted to fight beside Mo Fan too, but he did not allow her to.

Mo Fan knew that they had no chance of surviving the skeleton army. Since they still had some room behind, he wanted the others to live longer while he would earn some time for them.

“Ling~”

The little Flame Belle stood on Mo Fan’s shoulder. The fearless demoness finally knew how torturous the feeling of being unable to do anything to stop something from happening was. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Why would I blame you, you’re so young, there are too many of them. It’s just that I’m feeling sorry for your mum. I promised her to bring you to the Burning Valley and protect the Starry Tree after the next Fire Calamity, even though Xinxia mentioned that it’s impossible for the Fire Calamity to happen again...” Mo Fan fondled little Flame Belle’s head.

Little Flame Belle was crying. Pieces of fire crystals were falling down.

She was blaming herself for not practicing more diligently. She was not strong enough to resolve the danger for Mo Fan by annihilating the ocean of skeletons ahead.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan was feeling regretful that he did not take better care of the little creature. An overwhelming sense of guilt spread across his body when he recalled the scene of Jiang Feng sacrificing herself to protect the little Flame Belle...

“Ling~”

“Ling!”

Little Flame Belle was crying with all her might, trying to excite the spirit of fire within her.

She was forcing herself to evolve. She believed that if she could grow into the mature phase, she could eliminate more enemies. The creature that was as little as a baby had never felt a stronger desire to have more power!

Mo Fan looked at little Flame Belle and chuckled.

It was impossible; she needed more time and more resources to evolve. It was useless trying to force herself like that...
