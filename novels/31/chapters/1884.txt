The Scarlet Soaring Demon was the first species of sea monster that Mo Fan had ever encountered. The Warrior-level creature’s strength had surprised Mo Fan back then, since it was rare for an entire species to be made up of Warrior-level creatures.

The Scarlet Rending Demon which appeared after the Scarlet Soaring Demon was giving Mo Fan a strong impression. Even though Mo Fan eventually found out the Guild of the Wicked was the real culprit for kidnapping the children, he was still disgusted by the Scarlet Rending Demon’s sinister nature!

The Scarlet Rending Demon at the reservoir was a lot more mature than the one he had encountered in the past. Its shoulders, elbows, forehead, and ankles had sharp dagger-like bones growing out of them. It had a menacing appearance, as if its whole body was made up of deadly weapons. Its crimson skin was as bright as lava, with an eerie luster to it. Its lizard-like head had a thick mane covering the back of its head and neck. It had the wild demeanor of a noble species!

Mo Fan clearly remembered the Scarlet Rending Demon he had fought against in the past only had a very short mane on its head. Even though it was not very accurate to determine the age of a demon creature through its physical traits, the difference between the two creatures’ manes was equivalent to the difference between a young teenager and a muscular adult.

This Scarlet Rending Demon was a lot stronger than the one he encountered before!

Bang!

The Scarlet Rending Demon waved its tail. The jagged edges on it had turned it a deadly weapon. It hit a Mage of the Donghai Magic Association who was in his thirties. Blood immediately sprayed in the air as the man was knocked flying like an arrow!

Most coincidentally, the Mage ended up slamming into the same building as Mo Fan. He smashed through the balcony of a household and landed in the living room.

Shen Qing quickly jumped down to observe the person’s condition. “Senior Brother Zhang!”

Shen Qing recognized the man. She was worried about his condition after seeing the blood.

Mo Fan and Shen Qing saw the man lying on an expensive carpet. The living room was now in a mess, showing how powerful the Scarlet Rending Demon’s attack was.

“I...I’m fine... Shen Qing?” The Mage with the surname Zhang crawled to his feet.

Mo Fan glanced at him and saw a cut extending from his chest to his stomach. He was wearing a suit of high-quality Magic Armor, so the cut was not too deep. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“We saw the signal, so we came to help... What is that creature? It looks tough!” Shen Qing helped the Mage up.

“It’s a Commander of the Scarlet Soaring Demons, a Scarlet Rending Demon, a savage amphibious creature with a strong desire to kill! I was patrolling the area with your Brother Huang when we saw the creature murdering people, so we fired the signal to request backup. It’s a strong Commander-level creature, so you and the others should keep a certain distance away from it when Casting your spells. Don’t even get close to it. Junior Brother Wang was killed because he failed to dodge the creature’s attack before the others arrived...” Senior Brother Zhang said.

“Junior Brother Wang is dead!?” Shen Qing’s eyes were filled with shock and grief.

The man was in the same group as Shen Qing, they joined the Donghai Magic Association together. He was a talented Advanced Mage too! Shen Qing did not expect a talented young Mage whom she was quite impressed with would die so suddenly!

“We need more backup. The people here can only hold it back. Over a dozen Intermediate Mages have come since we fired the signal, but we can only keep the Scarlet Rending Demon at bay instead of defeating it,” Senior Brother Zhang sighed.

“I’ll stop your bleeding first. The wounds are worsening,” Shen Qing said.

“No! Without me, the rest are going to be taken out too. Once that happens, the Intermediate Mages who came will be wiped out, not to mention the civilians that are stranded here!” Senior Brother Zhang clenched his teeth as he struggled to his feet. His bones were crackling. His joints were most likely dislocated from the impact.

Shen Qing was unwilling to let the man go out there after seeing his condition. His joints were severely dislocated. His movements were going to be hindered if the joints were not treated. He would be dead for sure if the Scarlet Rending Demon landed another blow on him!

“Don’t move, I’ll treat your injuries. Mo Fan, can you please head back to the Sheraton Hotel and warn the elder about the Scarlet Rending Demon so he can send some experts over? It’s an emergency, you have to be quick!” Shen Qing turned to Mo Fan.

“If it’s an emergency, can’t I just kill the creature instead?” Mo Fan asked with a puzzled face.

Senior Brother Zhang and Shen Qing immediately fixed their eyes on Mo Fan, especially the injured man. His expression was already mixed with pain and grief, yet Mo Fan’s unreasonable words further added anger to it. He snarled, “Didn’t you hear what I just said? Why are there always people like you who have no clue how serious the situation is? We are risking our lives to hold the Commander-level creature back, yet you are still wasting our precious time by acting arrogantly!”

Mo Fan’s face contorted after the man scolded him for nothing.

“Mo Fan, that creature is too strong for us, can you please do as we say...” Shen Qing was a lot gentler.

“You still don’t trust me, do you?” Mo Fan let out a wry smile.

He already told Shen Qing many times that he was a Super Mage. It seemed like it was easier to convince her with a Super Spell than using words!

That being said, Mo Fan was not planning to cast a Super Spell. It was unnecessary just to take out a Scarlet Rending Demon!

“What...what are you doing!?” Senior Brother Zhang snapped when he saw Mo Fan jumping out of the window and heading toward the reservoir. “Idiot, what a f**king idiot!”

Shen Qing was unsure how to stop Mo Fan. However, when she recalled the strength he displayed at the shopping lot, she believed he might actually stand a chance against the Scarlet Rending Demon.

“Senior Brother Zhang, let him be, he’s pretty strong,” Shen Qing said.

“Help me to a higher spot!” Senior Brother Zhang was not convinced.

Mo Fan did not engage the Scarlet Rending Demon right away. The creature was currently in the middle of the reservoir, where huge waves were splashing around. The water in the reservoir had provided the Scarlet Rending Demon the perfect environment to use its magic.

There was a gap in one corner of the encirclement after Senior Brother Zhang was injured. The cunning Scarlet Rending Demon immediately focused on the group of Intermediate Mages who were firing spells at it from the nearby buildings!

Around twenty Mages were on the roofs of three buildings, which were side by side. Their faces turned pale when they saw the Scarlet Rending Demon charging at them. They immediately fled for their lives in panic!
