Chapter 2017: Kidnapping the Little Cub

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

Mo Fan looked at Lingling. His whole face was saying, “What the actual f**k!?”

Why couldn’t she say that earlier? Even thirty seconds earlier was good enough, as Mo Fan could easily have taken the stone from the little cub. The little creature had almost reached the Tianshan Scar White Tiger now.

Mo Fan’s face twisted. He turned around and signaled the others with his lips, “Run!”

“Mo Fan...”

“Mo Fan, please calm down, that’s a f**king Tianshan Scar White Tiger!”

Zhao Manyan and Jiang Yu tried to advise against Mo Fan’s decision, but he already moved to the staggering little cub’s side in an instant.

Mo Fan suddenly grabbed the little cub when she was almost back in her mother’s embrace.

The Tianshan Scar White Tiger reacted very quickly. It raised its claws as soon as it realized Mo Fan was up to something. The claws emitted a white light which turned into a claw-shaped glacier falling down at Mo Fan, leaving him with no chance to escape.

Mo Fan hugged the little cub tightly and was going to run away before the Tianshan Scar White Tiger could react. To his surprise, the terrifying claw falling on him had sealed off his escape. He was going to endure the wrath of the furious claw falling at him no matter how quick he was.

With a huge blast, the Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s claw destroyed the canyon. The walls for over three kilometers on both sides collapsed like a great disaster.

Ai Jiangtu, Jiang Yu, Nanyu, and the rest were indeed Mo Fan’s old teammates. They were ready for the unexpected turn of events as soon as Mo Fan told them to run. Ai Jiangtu cast Blink and teleported everyone out of the Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s line of sight over three hundred meters away. However, they did not expect its claw to possess such a remarkable strength. They quickly used their spells to run away from the canyon as the walls collapsed.

“Holy crap, we just escaped from the eagles’ nest, but we walked straight into a tiger’s mouth!” Zhao Manyan screamed.

Couldn’t they just enjoy a moment of peace!?

“Mo Fan’s guts are really...” Guan Yu shook his head.

“Enough talking, let’s run!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“What about Mo Fan? I think he’s been trapped by the Tianshan Scar White Tiger.”

“He should be able to escape, right?” Jiang Yu shot back. Nobody slowed down.

The sky and the ground were tumbling!

It was Mo Fan’s first time experiencing anything like it. The glaciers hanging above him were falling even as the ground was sinking. He would have been shredded by the Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s claw if it weren’t for the Dark Vein’s powerful ability to completely blend into the darkness.

What Mo Fan did not know was that the Tianshan Scar White Tiger had actually gone easy on him, as it was afraid of hurting the little cub!

“That thing must be very close to the species of the Tianshan Scar Sacred Tigers! How insane is that strength!” Mo Fan barely escaped with the Fleeing Shadow. He immediately used Earth Magic to move quickly along the wall.

Mo Fan’s little tricks did not deceive the Tianshan Scar White Tiger. It was trailing a mystical white glow like an illusion, leaving a dazzling trail behind as it sprinted across the collapsing canyon.

The little cub in Mo Fan’s arms seemed very excited. She thought they were playing hide-and-seek. She was riding someone while her mother was chasing behind them.

“Give me the pacifier,” Mo Fan was running out of patience. He tried to take the Night Amethyst out of the little cub’s mouth.

The little cub was reckless indeed, playing with something so valuable!

The little creature was very cunning. She quickly put the Night Amethyst deeper inside her mouth when Mo Fan tried to take it. She was reluctant to open her mouth, regardless of what Mo Fan did.

“My little ancestor, hurry up and give it to me considering that I rescued you from the eagles’ nest. I’m dead once your mother catches up to me!” Mo Fan almost burst out crying.

The little cub cried out happily. She would occasionally wave at the Tianshan Scar White Tiger behind them like she was saying, “Come and catch me, quick...”

“She seems to be playing. You can play along, she might give it to you later... I’ve placed the Tianshan Scar White Tiger in an illusion to buy us sometime, but it won’t take too long to break it,” Apas said.

“You’re asking me to play with her when I’m about to die? Apas, stop preserving your strength. Help me figure out a way to shake off the Tianshan Scar White Tiger,” Mo Fan cried out.

“If I was preserving my strength, you would be a dead body by now!” Apas was quite displeased by Mo Fan’s lack of trust in her.

The little cub kept crying out, as if she was talking to Mo Fan.

“What is she saying?” Mo Fan asked.

“Kids don’t know how to talk properly. How would I know what she’s saying!?” Apas replied.

Mo Fan’s head hurt. If the little cub was unwilling to compromise, he would not be able to give her back to the Tianshan Scar White Tiger. He wondered if the Tianshan Scar White Tiger was going to chase him until the end of the world if he kidnapped her.

“Little girl, how about this. I win if your mother doesn’t catch me before I leave the canyon. You will give me the stone, and I will hand you back to your mother. You will ask your mother to stop chasing us too!” Mo Fan negotiated with the little cub.

The little cub actually understood Mo Fan. She shook her head, indicating that she disagreed with the rules.

“Alright, before I leave the mountain, that’s my limit. Your mother is too fierce. It’s already a miracle that I’m still alive now!” Mo Fan said.

The little cub cried and waved her hands around. He had no idea what she was saying.

Mo Fan was purely interpreting the little cub’s language with his imagination. He was starting to miss Little Flame Belle. She was the best at sign language, regardless of age and species.

“Are you asking me to bring you out of this place, and in return, you’ll give me the Night Amethyst?” Mo Fan asked her.

The little cub nodded. Her face was brimming with excitement at the thought of leaving home.

Mo Fan’s face twitched. Why the Hell are you so excited for? If you want to leave home, just ask your mother to stop chasing us. My legs are going to break!
