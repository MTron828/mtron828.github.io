Time gradually passed, the second challenge week had arrived.

As Mo Fan wished, he challenged someone ranked in the top fifty, to earn a chance at entering the Three Step Tower.

The duel went according to plan. Mo Fan ordered the Swift Star Wolf to suppress his opponent, while casting his fourth-tier Basic Spells rapidly, defeating the student ranked forty-eighth with ease and entering the top fifty. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As Mo Fan thought, those ranked in the top fifty had a full set of equipment. If he weren’t abusing his three Elements, he would not be able to win the duel easily, since those ranked in the top fifty were as strong as Mu Ningxue when he fought her during the exchange.

Both Imperial College and Pearl Institute had lots of experts in the main campus. It would take years for the new students to dominate the scene.

Those close to the fiftieth rank were already at this level, let alone the others who were ranked even higher. Either way, without getting a Contracted Beast, leveling up his Lightning Element to the third level, and sorting out his equipment, it would be extremely difficult to get into top ten.

Mo Fan did not continue challenging as he did not want to bite off more than he could chew. After securing the forty-eighth rank, he would be facing stronger challengers. To preserve some strength for the fight against the vampire, Mo Fan did not want to climb too high on the ranking. As long as he had the chance to enter the Three Step Tower, he was not too concerned about the other resources.

More than a week had passed, but the vampire still did not show up. Even Liu Ru thought he might have given up on her, and she was experiencing the illusions because she still could not get over it.

Mo Fan and Lingling did not lower their guard. They would not allow Liu Ru to go back to her old life before killing the vampire.

Since their enemy was being patient, they would wait patiently too. Mo Fan continued to focus on his cultivation, while Zhao Manting kept an eye on Liu Ru. Even though Zhao Manting unsurprisingly broke up with his new girlfriend because of Liu Ru, it did not make any difference to him...

——

“Damn it, this vampire really knows how to stall it out!” Mo Fan cursed unpleasantly as he went back to his apartment.

Was that vampire brainless? If they continued to drag it out, Zhao Manting and Liu Ru’s kid would have already learned how to buy soy sauce. Didn’t they say the vampires would cling to their prey? Mo Fan clearly knew what kind of person Zhao Manting was. He would change his surname to Zhao if nothing were to happen after letting such a delicate girl interact with him every day!

Lying on the couch, Mo Fan began to run out of patience...

What if the vampire never showed up?

It would not make sense for him to protect Liu Ru all the time... oh, she didn’t need his protection anymore. Zhao Manting was more diligent than him at that.

Liu Ru was not as glamorous as Ding Yuming or Mu Nujiao, but she was attractive in her unique way. Even Mo Fan who had seen all sorts of beauties, had a fairly good first impression of her, let alone Zhao Manting, who was never picky when it came to girls.

As Mo Fam was feeling agitated because he was about to lose hope of getting the reward, his phone rang. The call was from Zhao Manting.

“Mo Fan, something happened,” Zhao Manting’s voice sank.

“Asking for an abortion fee?” teased Mo Fan.

“I’m serious, Liu Ru had an accident. You and Lingling should come over now,” Zhao Manting’s voice did not seem to be joking.

Mo Fan frowned. He could easily tell if his friend were joking or not.

He did not overthink it. He contacted Lingling and rushed straight to the place Zhao Manting mentioned.

——

It all happened very quickly. When Mo Fan assumed Liu Ru and Zhao Manting were enjoying a shameless life together, he never thought he would be seeing her as an expressionless, cold corpse.

She was lying in the woods at the institute. When Mo Fan arrived, her skin was extremely pale, and her body was slightly shriveled. Apart from the same delicate face, Mo Fan found it hard to believe that this was the same brave and youthful girl who was trying to avenge her sister.

Zhao Manting’s coat was placed on top of Liu Ru’s body. On her neck were two big holes, most likely the cause of her death...

This time, the vampire did not try to fake her death. It felt like he had purposely left the two holes to ridicule the people protecting her. Mo Fan could even hear the vampire’s mocking laugh mixed with the wind blowing from the woods.

“Sorry, I couldn’t protect her,” Zhao Manting lowered his head. His eyes were free of tears, yet it was easy to tell that he was in self-reproof.

Similarly, Mo Fan felt a stinging on his heart when he saw Liu Ru’s corpse, resulting in a chill. Yet, when he saw the holes, a great fury was ignited in his heart.

Provocation!

The holes were the provocation from the vampire!

The vampire had used Liu Ru’s life to make fun of Mo Fan’s protection and plan, just to let him know that he was absolutely stupid trying to mess with a vampire who was hiding in the dark. However, Mo Fan was not furious because of the blatant provocation, but because the girl’s life was treated so cheaply by the vampire...

Under Liu Ru’s delicate appearance was enough determination and courage that even Magicians would be impressed. She had never troubled Mo Fan while she was under his protection, and would try to avoid disturbing his life. She never expressed her gratitude to Mo Fan and hid it inside her heart, yet joy would leak out from her eyes every time she saw him.

At the start, Mo Fan felt pity for her, and more importantly, he was trying to complete the quest so he could afford the expensive equipment. However, he had treated Liu Ru as a friend in need, and had a true desire to free her from the vampire’s Nightmare...

If the vampire were holding some grudge against him, he would not frown if the vampire had targeted him. However, the vampire had chosen to target Liu Ru, not to prey on her, but to use her as a warning, a provocation.

It was a human life, the life of a young girl!

The books had mentioned that the vampires’ lineage bore similarities to humans. One could see them as humans who had contracted a strange disease.

However, how could the vampire possibly be called human after what he had done?

Mo Fan recalled what Huo Tuo had said to him. Why should he care if the vampires were humans or beasts, rather than what they had done?

Look at what this vampire had done! Someone like him should be executed like a dirty swine!

“Should we notify someone high up in the Hunter Union?” said Zhao Manting.

“It’s useless unless we have some evidence to prove that the vampire is responsible. Look at how big the holes are, they would say that she was attacked by some sharp weapons,” said Mo Fan.

Even Huo Tuo could not convince the Hunter Union that a vampire had committed the crime. What could they possibly do without proper evidence? Besides, the person who died was not a Magician, so the case would be handed over to the police instead.

“What can we do?” said Zhao Manting.

“Tell me what happened.” Mo Fan was like a volcano on the verge of exploding.

No matter where the vampire was hiding, no matter what disguise he was using, Mo Fan would find him and chop him into pieces, and use him as the fertilizer for the bed of white roses in front of Liu Ru’s grave!
