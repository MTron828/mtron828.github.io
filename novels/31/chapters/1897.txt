The Feathers of the Wind Spirits gathered on Zhang Xiaohou’s back after he Summoned them. They combined into a pair of mystical and stunningly beautiful wings. The Wind Wings did not beat the usual way, as the Wings of the Wind Spirits were rather tiny. As they turned into two larger wings, it was like a few hundred propellers had been installed on Zhang Xiaohou’s back, launching him into the sky like a jet.

Mo Fan’s flames were still around. Zhang Xiaohou quickly found the perfect spot to break through the Viscera Hunters’ defense.

“I see it!”

Zhang Xiaohou found the Magical Sea Beast with the help of the light produced by Mo Fan’s flames!

The Magical Sea Beast was being protected by the Viscera Hunters as carefully as if it was their child. Previously, they could not even see the mouth of the Magical Sea Beast that resembled a giant bell. Zhang Xiaohou finally saw what it looked like after breaking through the surrounding Viscera Hunters.

Mo Fan was moving rapidly amid the flames. He asked when he saw Zhang Xiaohou flying into the opening, “Houzi, can you take care of it?”

“Not a problem!”

Mo Fan had opened a huge hole, but there were still more than a hundred Viscera Hunters gathered around the Magical Sea Beast. The Viscera Hunters who were not injured by the flames were still protecting the Magical Sea Beasts with their lives. Mo Fan had used all his might to unleash the Raging Phoenix. He had no energy left to kill the rest of the Viscera Hunters, so Zhang Xiaohou was the perfect candidate to take over his role.

Zhang Xiaohou was extremely quick, and even the flames could not match the speed of his wind. The Viscera Hunters with rather slow reaction times did not even notice a human had woven through them, too busy focusing on Mo Fan’s flames.

The Viscera Hunters who did notice Zhang Xiaohou could not do anything, unless they formed another wall with their bodies to stop Zhang Xiaohou from getting any closer, or he could easily sneak past them!

A dozen Viscera Hunters pounced at Zhang Xiaohou, and he quickly came to a stop. The smartass Viscera Hunters had predicted where Zhang Xiaohou was going to be based on his speed, yet they all ended up missing their attacks. They even fell into the water from their momentum.

Zhang Xiaohou picked up speed again after dodging those Viscera Hunters. Another group of Viscera Hunters made some moves on him, yet he was like a sparrow in a jungle, dodging every obstacle in his path.

“Die, monster!”

Zhang Xiaohou reached the Magical Sea Beast, and clenched his hands into claws. The intelligent Feathers of the Wind Spirits immediately settled around his hands and slashed at the target murderously as Zhang Xiaohou swung his fists!

The tiny feathers emitted a sharp gleam. The wind they produced slashed forward like a pair of ferocious claws!

The wind claws landed on the Magical Sea Beast. The rest of the Viscera Hunters naively thought they could take the blow on behalf of the Magical Sea Beast, yet their bones were soon torn into pieces by the imperious claws!

The Magical Sea Beast did not survive either. It was shredded into bloody pieces that scattered across the water, just like the remains of the Viscera Hunters. Its mouth, previously vibrating to produce the sonic wave, was still gaping as it fell to the bottom of the bay.

“Nicely done!” Mo Fan exclaimed when he saw the Magical Sea Beast was dead.

That sonic wave was manipulating the tide. The remaining two Magical Sea Beasts further away were still playing their symphony, but as the first two Magical Sea Beasts died, the strength of the sonic wave had weakened by two levels, so the incoming tide had fallen significantly.

Even though there was a certain delay needed for the height of the tide to change, the difference was quite obvious. The difference between the peak and the bottom of the waves was around twenty meters previously. They were literally like incoming beasts just then, but the difference was now around seven to eight meters.

Even though the waves were still huge, they would soon be weakened by the obstacles around the island, including the mountains and hills. The city would slowly be flooded instead of being devoured by a tsunami!

“Brother Fan, let’s go!”

Zhang Xiaohou knew there was no reason to waste further time on the Viscera Hunters. He flew to Mo Fan’s side and withdrew to the shore with the Feathers of the Wind Spirits.

It was a lot more convenient for Mo Fan to move around with Zhang Xiaohou’s aid. They could just break out of an encirclement amid the Viscera Hunters as they pleased. They shook off the enraged sea monsters in the blink of an eye and made it back to the shore.

“Thank you, thank you so much!...” Shen Qing was so emotionally stirred that tears almost ran down her cheeks.

She had grown up in this city. She would feel like she had lost everything if the city was swept away by the tide!

“We came to help. Many cities across the country are suffering from different disasters. We must stick together and help one another to survive in these difficult times,” Zhang Xiaohou replied calmly.

Shen Qing did not expect Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou to actually be able to kill the Magical Sea Beasts. Apart from being grateful to them, she was utterly impressed now. “If I was strong as you two, I’ll be able to do a lot of things... but unfortunately, there’s nothing I can do right now.”

“Don’t say that, you’ve saved a lot of people! Strength doesn’t mean everything. Most importantly, we’re all in this together. If you didn’t warn me about the Magical Sea Beasts’ power, terrible things would be happening right now,” Mo Fan reassured her.

The device on Zhang Xiaohou’s wrist suddenly blinked rapidly while Mo Fan was comforting Shen Qing, as if there was some emergency.

“Brother Fan, we have a mission with a higher danger level. They are requesting backup from Super Mages,” Zhang Xiaohou said with a frown.

“Why can’t they give me a chance to catch my breath?... Forget it, let’s go,” Mo Fan sighed.

“Mm, I’ll give you the Wind Wheels!”

Zhang Xiaohou and Mo Fan did not stay around longer. The remaining two Magical Sea Beasts were no longer a threat!

—

Zhang Xiaohou looked back at Shen Qing, who watched them leave as they flew above the flooded city.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan, looking confused.

“She reminds me a lot of things in the past. We were actually weaker than her before. We used everything we had to survive, and now, we can actually change a lot of things. We no longer feel helpless too... It’s quite a relief for me,” Zhang Xiaohou rubbed his nose. His eyes were glittering a little.

“Yeah, we have grown stronger!” Mo Fan agreed loudly.

“Mm, we did... but Bo City is no longer around...”
