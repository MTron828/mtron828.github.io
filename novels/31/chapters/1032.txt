The peak of Mount Tyrant was always shrouded by a black cloud. It sat right on the peak, and would occasionally go a little bit under it.

The Lightning Tyrant was formed between the peak of Mount Tyrant and the black cloud. Most interestingly, the Soul-grade Lightning Seed actually resided in a chasm located at the waist of the mountain.

It was the main reason why many Hunters had failed to discover anything when they searched. They all assumed the Lightning Tyrant was right at the top of the mountain since they kept seeing the lightning strikes from the black cloud, but they had no idea that the lightning had formed an electrical field at the mountain’s waist, and the real Soul-grade Lightning Seed was refined for countless years here until it was completed.

“Aren’t we doing the thing you mentioned first?” Mo Fan asked.

“I’ll help you get the Lightning Tyrant first, it might come in handy,” Asha’ruiya said.

The two walked into the chasm at the mountain waist. Mo Fan discovered a long crack at the spot, like it had been sliced in half by a godly hammer that came down from the sky.

It was obviously the work of the lightning!

As Mo Fan looked into the crack, he saw dense lightning arcs flickering within it, as if a strong magic formation was active inside it. The electrical arcs were black, and would produce a slight yellow after flashing across the air.

Qianjun’s lightning was purple-black. As a Lightning Mage, Mo Fan could sense the strength of lightning just by looking at it. A bolt of stronger lightning would move faster. Mo Fan could sense how fast this lightning was moving. It was extremely restless, as if it was about to surge across the place in all directions. The lightning was on the verge of exploding with the slightest touch. It only needed a medium to conduct it, and it would immediately surge through it and penetrate even the firmest object!

“There are so many lightning arcs blocking the way, how are we supposed to go deeper?” Mo Fan said.

The lightning was too strong for Mo Fan to even touch it. He had to reconsider if his body could actually take it on.

“That’s the least of our worries. Didn’t you notice something else?” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan started scanning his surroundings doubtfully.

Night had fallen. The mountain was in pitch-black darkness. Mount Tyrant was not just a mountain that rose up like a pillar, but consisted of layers of mountain bodies stacking on top of one another. There were lots of mountain walls, valleys, gaps, and flat surfaces. There were not many plants, most likely due to the strong presence of lightning.

As Mo Fan was observing the pitch-black, barren surroundings, he suddenly spotted something shuddering on the walls and the rocks.

Mo Fan took a closer look and saw a creature with strange-colored feathers leaning on the walls. They must be a kind of creature that was active in the day, and usually deeply asleep at night.

“Every Soul-grade Seed is like a giant spring of energy. Any demon creature that wants to grow stronger in a shorter period of time will spend most of their time close to the energy spring. You don’t seriously think that something as precious as a Soul-grade Seed will be left unguarded, and is only waiting for someone to pick it up?” Asha’ruiya said.

“So those things will attack us if we go inside the crack?” Mo Fan said.

“Yes, we are currently in their territory,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan immediately observed his surroundings again with his night vision. It was just as Asha’ruiya had mentioned; the area was full of holes leading to the demon creatures’ nest. They were simply too quiet when they were asleep, so quiet that Mo Fan was totally unaware of their existence. It also meant that these creatures were not low-level, either!

“They are Wind Flame Lightning Vultures, a kind of demon creature with three different Elements. Not only are they able to cast powerful magic abilities, their flesh is extremely strong, too! You can think of them as experts of both physical and magical attacks,” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan had seen the Wind Flame Lightning Vulture before, but based on Asha’ruiya’s description, he could easily tell how tricky it would be to fight the demon creatures. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“They normally spend ten years on their Wind Element, ten years on their Fire Element, and ten years on their Lightning Element. Once they finished cultivating the three Elements, they will evolve into a Three-Headed Magic Vulture. It’s one of the strongest Commander-level demon creatures out there,” Asha’ruiya said.

“So you’re saying that they are currently in their final stage prior to their evolution?” Mo Fan said.

“Yeah, the Wind Flame Lightning Vultures that are still cultivating their Wind Element are quite average. They are just like Warrior-level creatures in the Advancing Period. When they are cultivating their Fire Element, they are as strong as the weaker Commander-level creatures. However, when they are done cultivating the Lightning Element, they will be reborn as if they had just come out from a cocoon, making them one of the strongest Commander-level creatures,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Holy crap, you’re telling me that these creatures are all Commander-level?” Mo Fan gasped.

-Are you f**king kidding me?- Mo Fan had counted at least nine of the creatures nearby with a rough glance. If every single one of them had finished cultivating the Wind and Fire Elements, wouldn’t that simply mean they were as strong as average Commander-level creatures?

-What kind of joke is this? Would Commander-level creatures even live together?-

Most Commander-level creatures that Mo Fan had encountered would be leading their own tribes and stay within their own territory. He had never seen Commander-level creatures residing in the same territory. It was basically a family of Commanders!

“Take them out, and the Lightning Tyrant is yours,” Asha’ruiya said.

“That’s easy for you to say! Even if I’m confident, I’m not foolish enough to think that I can take on nine Commander-level creatures at the same time!” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was most likely strong enough to kill a Commander-level creature by himself. However, he still needed to rely on Little Flame Belle’s power, as he could not possibly kill a Commander-level creature without being possessed by Little Flame Belle.

Mo Fan was confident that he could take on two Commander-level creatures at once, but if there were more than two of them, he would surely lose the battle!

Unfortunately, he had already used the Time Liquid he collected. If he still had some left, he would not have any problem dealing with the Wind Flame Lightning Vultures!

“Summon your Dark Swordmaster, it should be strong enough to take them on, right?” Mo Fan said.

“It hasn’t grown up yet, it can only fight one of them,” Asha’ruiya said.

“I can take on one, and my Contracted Beast can take on one, together with your Dark Swordmaster, we’ll be able to take out three of them. How about the other six?” Mo Fan said.

“Leave it to that guy,” Asha’ruiya was looking at the other side of the mountain with glittering eyes.

“Who?” Mo Fan followed her gaze but saw nothing.

There was a hill around three kilometers away. Mo Fan was able to see quite far away at night. He tried to take a closer look, yet he did not see anything worth mentioning.

“I was actually referring to that hill, use this to lure it here,” Asha’ruiya gave Mo Fan a black stone.

Mo Fan received it and looked at it closely.

-Oh mama, isn’t this the Stone of Guilt that was displayed in the long corridor? How did it end up in Asha’ruiya’s hands?-

“Where did you get this?” Mo Fan asked.

“I stole it,” Asha’ruiya replied.

“...” Mo Fan was speechless. He had never seen anyone acting so calm after stealing something!

“You were the one that triggered the alarm? Why did you steal it?” Mo Fan felt his balls hurting.

Back in Venice, Mo Fan even convinced himself of Asha’ruiya’s innocence. He assumed that with her identity and wealth, it did not make any sense for her to commit the crime. To his surprise, she had actually stolen the stone. However, Mo Fan was confused again. Didn’t Zhao Manyan say nothing was missing? Or did they simply decide to hide the truth?

“I switched it out with a fake. This kind of stone is found on the godly mountain where the Parthenon Temple was located in the early days. The presence it contains will be able to lure the creature easily. Just hold on to it, and the creature will chase after you,” Asha’ruiya said.

“I don’t really understand what you’re saying.” Mo Fan was utterly lost.

“Just go and do as I say, don’t you want the Lightning Tyrant?” Asha’ruiya prodded him.

—

Mo Fan was utterly confused. He did not really understand the situation. Why did Asha’ruiya steal the stone? To make things even more complicated, if the stone was useful to him, it simply meant that Asha’ruiya was planning to come here all along. Did that mean she already knew he would be tagging along?

But it did not quite make any sense. He had only told Asha’ruiya he was looking for a Soul-grade Lightning Seed when they were enjoying the pizza.

Occupied with his thoughts, Mo Fan arrived at the hill that Asha’ruiya had mentioned.

There was nothing at all on the hilltop. What was she thinking o,f asking him to come here with the black Stone of Guilt?

“Hello, anyone here?” Mo Fan stood in front of the rising ground and yelled.

His voice echoed across the mountain. The dull thud of the lightning far above was the only response Mo Fan could hear.

“I have this!” Mo Fan raised the black Stone of Guilt and yelled again.

The Stone of Guilt did have a unique aura to it, like a unique scent that would not dissipate even after thousands of years.

As the scent spread in the air, a pair of eyes suddenly sprang open on the hill!

It was not like the eyes belonged to something on the hill, but the hill had a pair of eyes!

When the eyes sprang open, an overwhelming pressure fell onto Mo Fan. He felt like his tiny heart was about to break into pieces!

“F**k me!” Mo Fan was drenched in cold sweat.

No wonder he did not find anything, it turned out that the hill was the creature that Asha’ruiya was referring to!

The hill extended its enormous arms, and legs as thick as ancient trees. Its body slowly turned from the color of a hill to silver-gray, with the luster of forged metal. It looked utterly imperious under the moonlight!

The Tyrant Titan!

Mo Fan immediately came to a realization. He finally knew why the enormous creature had disappeared all of a sudden before. It turned out that its skin was able to change color. When it touched the rocks, it was able to merge perfectly with the mountain, like a chameleon. As its limbs and face were wrapped together when it remained still, it looked like a small hill!
