Shen Qing’s eyes reclaimed their brilliance after hearing Mo Fan’s words.

Killing a Sea Magical Beast would reduce the rising tide by a level. It was too important for the city that was already in a pinch!

“Are...are you serious?” Shen Qing gasped in disbelief.

Even a Super Mage would struggle to fend off so many Viscera Hunters. Could the person who had been tagging along to help her with a rescue operation really kill a Sea Magical Beast that was protected by so many Viscera Hunters?

“I can kill one of them, at least. Help me contact Zhang Xiaohou. If the situation isn’t so bad on his side, ask him to support me. We might be able to kill two of them if there’s enough time,” Mo Fan reached out his hand and placed the hood of Shen Qing’s raincoat back on her head. “Go.”

“Got it!” Shen Qing nodded. She almost shook the hood off again. Raindrops slid down her neck and into her clothes, yet she did not feel cold at all. She sprinted toward the woods.

Killing two Magical Sea Beasts...

If they could take out two of the Magical Sea Beasts, the tide rise would only reduce to four times. It would still be disastrous to the city, but it was a lot better than the tide rising thirty-twofold!

It did not matter if Mo Fan was telling her the truth, nor did she know whether calling Zhang Xiaohou here was going to make any difference. She had to do as she was told immediately!

“The rest of you, back off a little.” Mo Fan moved closer to Wuyuan Bay.

Zhang Lulin was done firing the signals, yet only a few Mages had shown up. When he saw Mo Fan approaching the first Magical Sea Beast, he yelled, “Are you out of your mind? The situation is clearly out of our control. You should guarantee your own safety instead!”

“I have a bad habit of trying things no matter how bad or desperate a situation is. I have no idea what the outcome is going to be, but I’m bold enough to at least try changing the situation!” Mo Fan cracked his neck and loosened his shoulders.

Damn it, even these lowly sea monsters knew to come up with a strategy!

Even if he could not change anything, he could still vent his frustrations by killing a bunch of them!

—

Mo Fan did not get too close to the Magical Sea Beast. He was standing on a bunch of floating tires, most likely swept into the bay from a factory nearby. They had ended up around the bay and the shore, providing Mo Fan with some stepping stones.

Previously, the Viscera Hunters had immediately lost their temper and charged at Mo Fan when he provoked them. They would keep chasing him even when he retreated from the bay, but now the creatures did not attack him right away, as their priority was to guarantee the Magical Sea Beasts’ safety.

Mo Fan grinned when he noticed their behavior.

If they were not going to take the initiative to attack or surround him... it would make a lot of difference!

During the World College Tournament, the whole team was protecting him since he was the magic cannon of the team. He could inflict serious damage on the enemy team as long as he had a safe environment to cast his spells.

The Viscera Hunters were close-combat fighters. If they stayed close to the Viscera Hunters, he would seize the initiative!

In other words, he could fight the Viscera Hunters at a safe distance and then back away to a spot where he would not pose any threat to the Magical Sea Beasts. That way, the Viscera Hunters would not bother chasing him since they could not afford to leave the Magical Sea Beasts’ side. Therefore, it would split the Viscera Hunters into smaller groups!

Taking on smaller groups of the Viscera Hunters and taking on a whole swarm of them were totally different!

Mo Fan started drawing closer while tossing long-ranged Basic and Intermediate Spells at the Viscera Hunters. The Jagged-Bone Viscera Hunters were rather patient. They simply endured the spells when Mo Fan remained on the shore. Even if Mo Fan was using an Advanced Spell, they would only line up like a wall to resist his attack.

The shore was quite a distance away from the Viscera Hunters, thus by the time the Advanced Spell reached Wuyuan Bay, its strength had already dropped significantly. Only certain Advanced Spells could hit targets at such a distance. If Mo Fan remained on the shore, he would not be able to kill the Sea Magical Beast even if he consumed all his Lightning Energy.

“I have to get a little closer to figure out what their acceptable range is...” Mo Fan mumbled as he stepped on the floating tires and gradually moved closer toward the water.

The Viscera Hunters were watching Mo Fan at all times. Many had already fought Mo Fan previously. They had an urge to pounce at Mo Fan and capture him alive and torture him, yet the Sea Magical Beasts were extremely weak, even though they had the strongest power to manipulate the sea. Even a single Viscera Hunter could kill them if they did not have any protection!

Mo Fan did not stop casting his spells. The Viscera Hunters began to move when he was less than three hundred meters from the group surrounding a Magical Sea Beast...

Three hundred meters!

It was their borderline.

Mo Fan canceled the Advanced Spell he was channeling. He was merely pretending to attack the Viscera Hunters to see what their reaction was. As he thought, the Viscera Hunters were reacting strongly to his actions!

“Come, I didn’t have enough just then!” Mo Fan gave the easily-provoked Viscera Hunters a mocking look.

Around thirty Viscera Hunters left the circle and attacked Mo Fan once he was within three hundred meters. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan stayed in the area. He immediately used his Lightning Magic and fired over ten Thunderbolts across the lake. They flared rapidly and created a strong impact across the surface, fully capable of killing Commander-level creatures.

The Viscera Hunters were not Commander-level creatures, only Great Warrior-level creatures, but if the standard of how sea monsters were usually three times stronger than the demon creatures on the land, three Viscera Hunters would be as strong as a Lesser Commander-level creature!

Mo Fan’s spells were usually strong enough to kill Warrior-level creatures instantly, so he would not have any trouble taking on a hundred Warrior-level creatures, but it was not as easy when he was fighting the Viscera Hunters.

The Viscera Hunters were cunning. They were familiar with Mages’ capabilities and they could smell the destructive aura of an Advanced Spell.

Whenever Mo Fan used an Advanced Spell, the Viscera Hunters would spread out, so Mo Fan could only kill at most two or three of them, if he even landed his spell!
