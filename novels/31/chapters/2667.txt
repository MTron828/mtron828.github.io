Chapter 2668: The Father and Son from Sulfur Island

Mo Fan was not hoping his prodding words would give him an advantage in the upcoming battle. He was just trying to annoy Zhao Jing.

“Oh, she’s so gorgeous!” a young man among the attackers suddenly exclaimed.

The young man’s skin was tanned and dry. He was wearing an old cotton jacket, but somehow it felt like it was the best outfit he had.

His smile was sincere and innocent, like a young man from the countryside who had just seen a beautiful woman in the city. He was overwhelmed with excitement.

“Father, I want that woman!” The young man pointed at Mu Ningxue like a little kid asking his parents to buy him toys.

Mo Fan glanced at the young man, who looked like someone who had lived away from human civilization for a long time.

“How did I teach you? You must earn everything with your own hands. It’s the same in the city. Didn’t you hear she’s the lord of Fanxue Mountain?” a middle-aged man with thick brows beside the young man answered.

The middle-aged man was wearing rugged clothes, too. His shirt and pants were obviously many years old. Only his hat, made of some animal’s fur, was presentable.

“Boss, they are the Father and Son of Sulfur Island, Cao Linfeng and Cao Xiaohan. Cao Linfeng was a reputable Mage of the Mu Clan a long time ago, before he moved to the Sulfur Island and lived there in seclusion to focus on raising his son, Cao Xiaohan. They did not leave the Sulfur Island for twenty years. They only left the island a little more than a month ago. Cao Xiaohan made a name for himself after he killed a Blood Sea Demon Ruler alone,” Mu Linsheng relayed quickly.

Mo Fan did not put a lot of attention on things that had not concerned him in the past. The Father and Son of Sulfur Island had lived in seclusion for a long time. He had never heard of Cao Xiaohan before, but it seemed like he was incredibly strong!

“Father, what do you mean she’s a lord? Does that mean she’s the strongest person in this city?” Cao Xiaohan asked. He sounded like there were a lot of things he did not understand.

“Something like that. It means she’s in charge of the city,” Cao Linfeng nodded.

“Father, you always use Er Niu in our village to motivate me. You say I can marry her once I become a Super Mage, but she’s so ugly compared to this one. I want her instead! I want to hug her when I sleep every night!” Cao Xiaohan pointed at Mu Ningxue with glittering eyes.

Cao Linfeng was not even embarrassed by his son’s words. The others felt an urge to laugh, despite the solemn situation.

How many years had the father and son lived in seclusion on that island? How were they so ignorant? The way they were speaking reminded everyone of people who had lived in the mountains for many years!

“If that’s the case, we should let the Father and Son of Sulfur Island take the first fight,” Lin Kang agreed with a smile.

“Well...” Cao Linfeng was a little hesitant. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Father, didn’t you say women in the city like men who are strong? It’s very simple, then. I just have to beat the strongest guy among them. When Er Niu said she didn’t like me, I helped her beat the hoodlum in the village. Didn’t she come and play with me after that?” Cao Xiaohan said. He completely ignored the people who were laughing at him.

“Mm, that’s true,” Cao Linfeng nodded.

Even though Er Niu had ended up marrying Uncle Jin, who was the richest man in the village, Cao Linfeng told Cao Xiaohan that he would have a lot of money once he became strong enough, and with money, he could take Er Niu back.

However, Xiaohan no longer had any interest in Er Niu.

His son had great taste. The woman that had caught his eyes was truly very gorgeous. Her silver-white hair and her icy temperament were flawless.

Cao Xiaohan went forward alone.

Even though Lin Kang had an entire army and others from powerful factions behind him, Cao Xiaohan would be the first to fight Fanxue Mountain!

However, his reason to fight was a little amusing.

“You, over there, come fight me!” Cao Xiaohan suddenly pointed at Mo Fan.

“Me?” Mo Fan pointed at himself and shrugged, “How do you know I’m the strongest here?”

“Nonsense, I’m the strongest. I just dislike you because you are standing too close to her. I feel like beating you up!” Cao Xiaohan was like an ox that had been driven mad by Mo Fan, who was like a piece of red cloth in his eyes.

“What an idiot, boss. I’ll teach him a lesson on behalf of you,” a captain of a patrolling squad said.

“Who do you think you are? The Shark Dogs I raised on my island are stronger than you!” Cao Xiaohan scoffed.

The captain could not stand it anymore. He jumped into the air and faded into the shadows in mid-air.

The sunlight was so bright that people had to cover their eyes with their hands when they looked up. However, something huge suddenly blocked the sunlight. After they moved their hands away, everyone realized the captain had turned into a huge brown mountain giving off thick smoke as it collapsed onto Cao Xiaohan.

The smoking mountain slammed into the ground like a meteorite. The trees in the woods burst into flames before the massive rock even landed. The temperature in the surroundings rose rapidly.

Cao Xiaohan remained unmoved, the same smile on his face.

His eyes suddenly shifted, flickering like a sharp blade.

“Tiger Leap!”

Cao Xiaohan’s body started glowing like a bright sun, and he threw a punch at the sky. A blinding light in the shape of a tiger pounced at the smoking mountain!

The scorching light shook the woods and shocked every Mage on the mountain, as if an ancient beast had come from a different realm to destroy their world!

The smoking mountain was initially impressive, but the glowing tiger had instantly turned it into a pile of sand with a single blow. Its remains were scattered across the Stepped Fields.

The captain who had transformed into the smoking mountain was a Super Mage. He fell back to the ground while vomiting blood, and fainted.

Zhong Li and Gu Ying were beside him. They quickly went over to help him up, but his whole body was soft and flabby, as if all his bones had been broken.

“What...” Gu Ying and Zhong Li were dumbfounded.

The idiot who had lived on an island all his life possessed such remarkable strength!
