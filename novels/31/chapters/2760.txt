Chapter 2761: Hawaii Has Grown Taller

Song Feiyao came from Licheng Afterglow Island, and Mo Fan had run into her by accident. Her knowledge of the Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets was close to zero.

Most of the Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets were in major organizations such as the army, the government, Magic Association, and other big organizations. It was only by joining these systems that the Godly Horde Prophet could obtain their desired information.

Mo Fan and his group had a high chance of victory if the Green East Sea God went along with them to the Pacific Ocean.

Mo Fan nodded. There was not much time left for preparation. They could not wait for Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan’s arrival. They had to immediately depart.

“Mo Fan, take this with you.”

Just when Mo Fan was about to jump onto the Green East Sea God’s back, Ms. Tangyue ran over to him and passed him a tiny bead.

“Totem Orb?” Mo Fan said in surprise.

“Yes. The guy is too big. It’s inconvenient if it moves around in that size,” said Ms. Tangyue.

When the Black Totem Snake molted, the Totem Orb remained the same except the Black Totem Snake grew small and burrowed its head into the tiny bead.

The Moon Moth Phoenix transformed into an exquisite and delicate Moon Elf, then sat on Mo Fan’s shoulder. It was convenient to bring it along. If the Black Totem Snake had not burrowed into the Totem Orb, it would have caused a commotion everywhere.

“Big guy, I think it’s best to travel by air. The Ocean Demons can easily detect us if we travel by sea,” said Mo Fan to the Black Totem Snake.

After the Black Totem Snake burrowed into the Totem Orb, Mo Fan and Song Feiyao got onto the Green East Sea God and headed to Hawaii.

The Green East Sea God flew at a breakneck speed. If not for the old injuries caused by the lightning chains, Mo Fan and his Black Dragon Wings may not have been able to catch up with it.

......

In terms of its stamina only, the Green East Sea God was capable of flying to the Pacific Ocean in a single breath.

...

The Green East Sea God was very smart. It strove to fly higher, away from land and sea at first. But when the higher altitude got colder and hampered its progress, it glided a little lower.

It slowly descended from the sky, then glided for several meters above the sea surface. By the time they saw the sea veering up to them, the Green East Sea God flew suddenly up and away.

It repeatedly flew in this manner. It was a long journey and they ascended to the highest point and descended almost to the sea all the time. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Flying in this manner would not speed up a short-distance flight. But it was obviously much faster if they flew from the East Coastline to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which was otherwise a very long distance to travel. After all, it was only natural for all flying creatures to take their physical strength into consideration when traveling long distances.

...

Mo Fan had been to Hawaii once. It was a romantic vacation island once upon a time. Later, it became an army fortress for scouting and fighting the Ocean Demons. After that, it was practically abandoned.

It was not because the Americans and people from the Sacred Hall of Liberty had refused to bear responsibility for Hawaii that it was abandoned. It was because regardless of how strong the army was, it was extremely difficult to face the Ocean Giant Beasts and Ocean Demon army’s repeated attacks on this lone island in the Pacific Ocean. Even if the elite American mage team were sent over to guard Hawaii, they would all be wiped out.

But the people from the Sacred Hall of Liberty were obviously reluctant to give up their precious island. Even though the army could not defend the island, they occasionally assigned some squads to do some surveys and gather information.

The powerful Ocean Demons basically came from the center of the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, Hawaii was the most strategic stage station for scouting the Ocean Godly Horde and its underwater country. If humans lost Hawaii, it would be close to impossible to gather any understanding about the Ocean Demons.

The Ocean Demons knew this. So, they would not let an island like this exist. They would attempt to destroy it by any means so that humans could lose their strategic advantage.

However, when Mo Fan and Song Feiyao reached Hawaii, they were surprised to see that the island hadn’t been destroyed. Instead, it expanded and became larger than the original. Even the hills were higher than before.

“What’s going on? Could it be that the sea level has dropped?” Mo Fan asked in confusion.

Song Feiyao gave him a funny look. Mo Fan sensed that he must have blurted out something stupid. He instinctively touched his nose. ‘Was my question that stupid?’

“The island is floating,” said Song Feiyao.

Indeed, Mo Fan had asked a stupid question. The sea level did not rise or drop so easily. Otherwise, why would zero altitude be taken as a benchmark? The four greatest oceans were connected, and the sea water flowed in constantly. The South and North Glaciers were the only possible factor that would cause a rise in sea level.

The tide rose and fell. Some islands looked much bigger when the tide fell, revealing the areas that were submerged. This was a phenomenon of low tide, revealing much of Hawaii’s surface area.

Mo Fan had the impression that Hawaii had expanded five to six times compared to its original size. Even the highest mountain seemed to have grown much taller.

“Will the island continue to grow taller?” asked Mo Fan.

“I remember our ancestors once told us about some people using a forbidden system to seal an island under the sea in order to avoid conflicts. The islanders continue to live their normal lives. But the sea water above the island will never pour into the island. The fact that Licheng Afterglow Island was not discovered in the past was because someone had cast a similar spell,” said Song Feiyao.

“That’s pretty amazing,” said Mo Fan.

“They can move the sea mountain and detach it from the sea surface with another kind of spell. The island will then grow enormous. Look! There are many cracks, broken rocks, and some molten lava around its edges. If I’m not mistaken, some powerful force must have squeezed the island before dragging it up.” Song Feiyao had a deeper knowledge about islands than Mo Fan.

If the sea flooded the world and the sea level reached 8,000 meters, then Mount Everest and other mountains above 8,000 meters would become islands in the middle of the Earth filled with sea around them.

The island was like a mountain that was taller than the level of the sea. Only the movement of the Earth’s plates would show such significant changes. It would also take a long period of time for something like this to happen.

But Hawaii seemed to have undergone a change that would otherwise require thousands of years to manifest. How powerful would one have to be to make something like this happen?
