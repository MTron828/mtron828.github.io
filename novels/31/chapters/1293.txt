“Lightning Strike!”

Mo Fan fired hundreds of lightning strikes at the Hillmen making their way up the trunk. The lightning arcs were whipping at the Hillmen that were rolling at him like a tide.

The lightning strikes were not strong enough to inflict serious damage on the Warrior-level creatures, but they were enough to infuriate them. The Hillmen seemed to have realized that Mo Fan had been abandoned by his teammates. They also realized that this man was the most detestable, since he had killed most of their fallen comrades. The Hillmen that were climbing the tree turned around and headed down instead to flank Mo Fan together with the others that were approaching.

Mo Fan looked at the savage Hillmen calmly. He first used Telekinesis to knock the Hillmen that were the closest to him into the air. His body immediately unleashed a brilliant silver light...

“Blink!” A huge Star Pattern appeared under Mo Fan’s feet, followed by more Star Patterns as they combined into a majestic Star Constellation made up of three hundred and forty-three Stars. It opened up a Space tunnel that Mo Fan was flying into to escape from the huge encirclement...

BANG!

Just as Mo Fan was about to escape the huge surround, a four-meter Bronze-Fang Hillman appeared out of nowhere and rammed into his chest. Its incredible impact was like a tsunami!

Mo Fan was only seconds away from entering the Space tunnel, but the surprise attack ended up knocking him out of the tunnel!

Mo Fan slammed a few meters deep into the trunk. A few of his ribs had broken. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Incredible pain surged throughout his body, and he almost lost consciousness. He did not expect a stronger Hillman hiding nearby would suddenly appear and gave him such a deadly blow. He would have died if it wasn’t for the physical attributes of his Demon Element!

-How cunning!-

Mo Fan wiped the blood from his lips. He forcibly unleashing his lightning to stop the Hillmen from getting any closer.

There were too many Hillmen. It was as difficult as driving a huge tide back. In just the blink of an eye, there were almost a hundred Hillmen less than twenty meters from Mo Fan. They were almost close enough to tear him into pieces!

“Back off!” Mo Fan knocked some of the Hillmen back with Telekinesis. However, more Hillmen kept showing up after he knocked the first wave back. He would not be able to resolve the danger with his current approach unless his Telekinesis was able to knock all the Hillmen back at once.

The cries of the creatures were deafening. However, Mo Fan felt like he could hear the Bronze-Fang Hillman that had ambushed him laughing viciously...

—

“Shit, Mo Fan failed to Blink up here!” Chen Yi’s face turned pale as she glanced down.

Mo Fan’s figure was surrounded by the enormous wave of Hillmen. Anyone would assume that the Hillmen had torn Mo Fan to pieces if they did not see the flickering of the lightning and the silver glow below.

“Keep going up, leave it to me!” Zhao Manyan dove back down as soon as he realized something was not right. However, there was not much he could do since the Hillmen had already stacked up in layers. He could only cast his defensive spells on a clear target, but he could not even see Mo Fan now...

—

“I’ll kill you all before I die!”

Mo Fan continued to unleash his will. His blood boiled vigorously as the danger worsened. His will was improving significantly, too...

A gravitational force appeared and compressed a circle of Hillmen around him into minced meat. Their blood splashed onto Mo Fan, turning him into a bloody mad man.

He did not have enough time to cast stronger spells. His outstanding mental strength and the Basic and Intermediate Lightning Spells were the most reliable in his current situation, since he was able to cast them with a thought. It was the only way he could survive!.

Circles of dead bodies kept falling to the ground. It was definitely not Mo Fan’s first time fighting under dire circumstances like this. When he was in the Space of Death, he ended up stacking up a huge pile of bones. The urge to surpass his limits, the feeling of burning his battle intent thoroughly, the danger and thrill from facing his death at every second were awakening the great potential hidden deep within his soul!

It was not that easy to kill Mo Fan. Even without awakening the true demon sleeping deep within him, he could still unleash the full potential of the demon blood flowing in his body. His speed increased and his thoughts were quicker. He was able to cast spells more fluently while using his mental strength at maximum output for a long time!

Mo Fan was relying more on his Space Element. His will was obviously quicker than casting spells. He had to clear up some space with the Space Element before he could cast his Lightning Spells...

“Quicker, stronger!”

It was not enough. He would not be able to stop the Hillmen from closing in at this rate!

The strong desire of exceeding the limit of his mental strength exploded amid the great pain he was feeling from his chest. Every cell in his body tensed under the enormous pressure of death. Their energy kept colliding into the barrier holding back his mental strength!

“AHHHH!!!” Mo Fan let out a huge cry. The brilliance of the silver light he was emitting reached its peak as a strong force surged in all directions like a tornado. Hundreds of Hillmen closing in were knocked flying by the incredible force!

The area that barely had any gaps suddenly cleared up. Despite being covered in blood, Mo Fan’s aura showed no sign of weakening. It continued to rise vigorously instead.

“Die you motherf***ers, Sky Lightning Claw!”

Mo Fan finally had the chance to use his strongest Lightning Spell with the time he had bought himself.

The Lightning Tyrant Domain seemed to have grown stronger after the breakthrough in his mental strength. The Hillmen subconsciously backed away after feeling the overwhelming presence. They were now hesitating to move any closer!

It ended up buying Mo Fan even more time to Cast! The Sky Lightning Claw descended from the sky and tore the Hillmen to pieces mercilessly. The Hillmen had no chance to dodge the attack, since they were too densely packed together. Their blood and flesh scattered in the air!

Countless Hillmen died horrible deaths to the Sky Lightning Claw. However, it was far from the end of it. Lightning descended like feasting dragons and swept across the place in the form of lightning claws, branches, chains, and arcs. They fell straight down, spread wildly like webs, and punctured the bodies of the creatures...

Groups of Hillmen died continuously, blood and flesh flew everywhere. The bloody remains that the Hillmen were reduced to by the lightning splattered on the others. Some fell to the ground as their bodies were scorched black. The rest of the Hillmen stood on the roots with blank faces. They suddenly lost their courage to move forward!

“Mo Fan!” Zhao Manyan and his golden wings dove from the sky, yelling at him.

Mo Fan took a deep breath. He did not seem to have any intention to leave.

Zhao Manyan was utterly stunned when he saw Mo Fan covered in blood. The man was an absolute monster. He had managed to ruin the morale of thousands of Hillmen by himself, even though he was seriously injured.

“Let’s go!” Mo Fan stomped the root and jumped into the air.

Zhao Manyan reached his hand out and grabbed Mo Fan’s. He quickly headed back up.

The Hillmen on the ground became tinier. They watched Mo Fan leave with terror-stricken faces.

The Bronze-Fang Hillman cried out furiously. It never expected the human to escape from their encirclement. It even brutally tore a few of its underlings into pieces to vent its frustrations!

Mo Fan looked down and stared at the Hillman that had ambushed him coldly.

His eyes were bloody red. He did not say a word, yet it felt like he was telling the Bronze-Fang Hillman, I’ll definitely come back and take your life!

—

They finally found a clear branch after flying a few hundred meters up the trunk. It was as spacious as a road they could run freely on. It felt like they were just standing on a brown patch of land when they looked ahead standing on the branch.

Mo Fan heard the sound of a heart pounding heavily. It was not his. His heart had calmed down a while ago. It was most likely Xinxia, feeling uneasy after realizing he was in danger.

Mo Fan fondled the fast-asleep Little Flame Belle, telling her not to worry about him. It was not her fault she was not available to fight for the time being. It was him being careless. He was not cautious enough, even though he knew the Hillmen had more than one Commander.

“How is he? Is he in danger?” Chen Yi asked nervously. Tears were rolling in her eyes. She almost lost her soul when she saw the condition Mo Fan was in.

“Strange, his body is oddly strong. The bleeding of some of his wounds has already stopped before they were treated... most importantly, the wound on his chest, it’s unbelievable!” Liu Xiaojia immediately went up to treat Mo Fan. However, she discovered that Mo Fan’s body was inhuman as soon as she touched him. How was it possible for a human to have a body as strong as a demon creature?

“I’m fine, I just need a little rest,” Mo Fan smiled.

Chen Yi had used her spell to wash most of the blood off. Mo Fan rose to his feet. Apart from the pain in his chest, he felt pretty good.

He let out a heavy sigh.

Liu Xiaojia, Chen Yi, and Lan Luo assumed Mo Fan was feeling uncomfortable. They quickly went up to him and asked if anything was wrong. To their surprise, Mo Fan glanced down at the dead bodies of the Hillmen that had piled up and said, “I didn’t have time to collect the demon crests. What a great loss.”

“...”

“...”

“...”

The three girls were left speechless. They suddenly felt an urge to strangle the man to death!

“Mo Fan, did you remember something Jiang Shaojun mentioned in his journal, about a Totem Beast that lives in an unusual tree?” Lingling looked up, staring at the towering Giant Purple Sacred Linden. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It looks like those goddamn Hillmen have actually pointed us in the right direction!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

There was another huge benefit he had gotten from the Hillmen too. His mental strength had reached the fifth stage!

The difference between each stage was insane!

He remembered that Ai Jiangtu’s mental strength was in the fifth stage before. He had finally caught up to Ai Jiangtu’s level!
