Lingling turned to the little creature whose hair was just as fluffy as a lion’s mane.

Mo Fan could not help but fix his eyes on the little creature too. The little cub was currently digging her head into a bowl of marinated beef. She soon made a mess of her face even though she had just taken a bath. She was already grabbing at another piece before she was done swallowing the previous piece.

It was more or less how a pig feasted after starving for a few days. Perhaps sacred Tianshan Mountain would have an urge to bury her in the snow just so she would not bring it any more disgrace.

“I think there’s something wrong with your program,” Mo Fan eventually concluded.

“It’s not, I did the comparison twice,” Lingling denied instantly.

“Are you sure it’s her?” Mo Fan asked.

“Weren’t you the one asking me to compare the pattern on her forehead with the Totem Seals? I was doing it to prove my speculation too, but...” Lingling was still lost in thought.

She already confirmed it. The pattern on the little cub’s forehead bore a similarity of one hundred percent instead of twenty-five percent!

In other words, the little cub was not the Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s child. It was actually the Tianshan Scar White Tiger’s senior, based on their lineage!

“This retarded little cub is the senior of the Tianshan Scar White Tiger we saw?” Words could not describe the expression on Mo Fan’s face.

“Mm, and she’s a real Totem Beast,” Lingling sounded like even she was struggling to believe it.

A real Totem Beast!

This little cub...

Is a f**king Totem Beast!?

What the hell was wrong with this world?

Were the Heavens trying to be fair by giving her an incomparable lineage, but a completely opposite brain? Her intelligence and maturity were easily at the bottom of the whole universe, let alone among the species on Tianshan Mountain!

Bowls of marinated beef were emptied on the messy dining table. The little cub had turned into a little piglet, seriously embarrassing the tiger species. She was still shoving down the beef even when her stomach was about to explode. Most amusingly, she even hid the remaining beef in holes that she dug and ran away like a dog, as if she was afraid that the others would find her treasure.

Beside the table, Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, Nanyu, Ai Jiangtu, Guan Yu, Lingling, and Jiang Shaoxu were staring at one another just like how they reacted on the first day after bumping into one another. They had no idea what to say.

“This little thing that ate our deposit... is really a Totem Beast?” Even Ai Jiangtu, who normally kept a very straight face, was wearing a rich expression for once. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Fan and Lingling nodded. Jiang Shaoxu flipped through her brother’s notes and found something relevant in them.

“The Totem Beast of Tianshan Mountain is as playful as a kid,” Jiang Shaoxu read the conclusion.

Jiang Shaojun had seen many Totem Beasts. He would put their information down like records in a diary.

Jiang Shaojun had never bothered the Totem Beasts directly. His mission was to prove they existed. He had taken out the traits, habits, and whereabouts of the Totem Beasts from his notes so those with ulterior motives would not abuse his findings. Jiang Shaoxu could only guess what her brother’s notes meant.

“As playful as a kid? Calling her a kid is already overestimating her intelligence!”

Mo Fan rubbed his temple. His head began to hurt.

It was a lot more acceptable if the Tianshan Scar White Tiger was the Totem Beast. Why must this brainless little cub be the real Totem Beast? Other Totem Beasts had endured hardships with mankind. It took a few decades of trust and protection for the Totem Beasts and humans to come together, yet the little cub was stuck to them like gum since their first encounter. He had never seen such a careless Totem Beast before!

“What...what about the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain which Shao Zheng met in the past? Was it her?” Zhao Manyan suddenly asked.

“I’ll try asking him,” Lingling said.

Lingling called the Chairman’s secretary. Chairman Shao Zheng was still awake even though it was the middle of the night.

Lingling turned her laptop to the little cub who was reluctant to leave the dining table after the call was established.

“Lingling, is that your new Poodle? How adorable, but I must go outstation tomorrow. I’ll bring some foreign snacks for your pet the next time I visit you...” Shao Zheng said with a gentle smile while tidying his hair.

Everyone on the table froze after seeing Shao Zheng’s reaction.

Shao Zheng assumed Lingling was showing off her new pet, even though it was supposed to be a little cub instead. How did he even... forget it, the little cub had already dirtied her hair because of the marinated beef.

Lingling was left speechless by Shao Zheng’s response too. She quickly said before Shao Zheng ended the call, “Chairman, is she the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain you met when you were young?”

“Huh? Where did you hear that from?” Shao Zheng asked curiously.

“The whole of Tianshan Mountain is spreading rumors about how you stumbled into the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain when you were young. It was because of the gift of the Sacred Tiger that led you to the peak of your generation,” Zhao Manyan interrupted.

Shao Zheng shook his head. He tried to explain, yet he wondered where to begin.

He said after a pause, “I didn’t stumble into the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain. It was a person instead. I was worried about placing her in danger, so I told everyone it was the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain instead.”

“A person?” Everyone exchanged glances with one another.

“It was a girl around Lingling’s age. I have no idea why she was there. I happened to be troubled by something during that time, and I was deeply touched when I saw how she endured the hardships on the mountain just to survive... She gave me some plants that would only grow on Tianshan Mountain, which helped a little with my breakthrough. Thus, the rumors aren’t true at all. I didn’t receive a gift from the Sacred Tiger. I believe everyone who has been to Tianshan Mountain will learn a lot of things. There is no path more difficult than the climb to the top of Tianshan Mountain, and the warmth between people is better than the cold on the deserted mountain,” Shao Zheng said.

Shao Zheng’s words took everyone by surprise, especially Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue.

A girl around Lingling’s age on Tianshan Mountain...

Taking the time that had passed into consideration, Shao Zheng was currently in his forties, and if he went to Tianshan Mountain around twenty years ago, it was the same time when Qin Yu’er had been abandoned on Tianshan Mountain when she was around ten years old.

“So the legend about the gift of the Sacred Tiger is fake?” Zhao Manyan said.

“Not entirely. There was indeed a kind spirit on Tianshan Mountain, but she’s a human. The people whom she helped only described her as the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain to protect her. Therefore, the rest of the people she helped without showing herself would assume it was the Sacred Tiger of Tianshan Mountain.”

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were stunned.

Despite being a victim of misfortunes, she had given people such a well-received legend instead of coldness. Yet someone like her was being treated as a heretic and was being purged by a bunch of powerful Mages...
