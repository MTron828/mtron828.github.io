“Either way, we must leave this place first,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Mm,” Qin Yu’er nodded.

Qin Yu’er had accidentally fallen into the rift while she was running away from the Judicators. Luckily, there was a cliff inside the crevasse for her to stand on. She would have ended up frozen again if she fell to the bottom of the rift!

Qin Yu’er looked worn out, and did not have a lot of energy left. She could still Summon frost to circle her like leaves and protect her from the wind, but the wind had already lashed at her like a whip when she fainted briefly.

Staying in the rift would only drain her energy more swiftly. If it wasn’t for Qin Yu’er’s Innate Talent, she would already have frozen on the cliff while she was unconscious.

Mu Ningxue helped Qin Yu’er up. She struggled to draw a Star Constellation due to the strong wind, which meant she could not use the Wind Wings. She had to rely on external help to get out of the crack.

“Get ready to come up!” Mo Fan called out.

Mo Fan was holding his right wrist tightly with his left hand. He spread his right hand like he was turning a compass with all his might. He was slowly modifying the direction of the wind in the rift!

The strong wind soon weakened significantly. Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er even felt a force lifting them into the air.

“Icebound Coffin!”

A heavy ice casket appeared above Mo Fan and collapsed onto him as he was channeling the Chaos Magic.

Mo Fan had no choice but to cancel the magic. His Dark Vein surged inside him as he escaped into the darkness as swiftly as a phantom.

The Icebound Coffin had appeared out of nowhere. It crashed on the spot where Mo Fan blended with the shadows. Mo Fan turned into a shadow sparrow and flew out of the Icebound Coffin’s area.

He left the shadows after arriving at a safe spot. He turned around angrily and saw a mischievous grin. It belonged to Xing Hui, who had been tailing them.

“I had a feeling you are somehow related to the Ice Witch. As I thought, you guys are pretty bold, trying to save the woman whom the Heresy Judgment Court is purging!” Xing Hui said from up a slope. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan frowned. Zhao Manyan had failed to lure Xing Hui away. He had followed them here!

If the four Judicators found out about Qin Yu’er’s condition, they would kill her at all costs. Mo Fan’s eyes immediately emitted a cold flicker. His murderous aura soon filled up the area through the Chaos Element and transformed into a ferocious demonic shadow lunging at Xing Hui.

“What now? Trying to silence me?” Xing Hui smirked.

Xing Hui was not dumb. He knew what Mo Fan was planning to achieve by releasing the aura of the Chaos Element. Mo Fan was isolating the area so Xing Hui could not call the four Judicators to his aid!

“Such a pity, I was thinking of killing you myself, but it’s more entertaining if I let the Heresy Judgment Court deal with you... don’t even bother putting up a fight, I’ve already sent someone to alert the Judicators. They will be here in a few minutes,” Xing Hui said.

Mo Fan’s face darkened.

He looked into the crack. Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er were still in it. They would have no chance of leaving the rift without external help, yet this Xing Hui had to trouble him now to stop him from saving them!

“Mo Fan, take him out as soon as possible. Don’t worry, I’ve dealt with his man,” Nanyu said.

Mo Fan immediately turned to Nanyu.

Nanyu explained in an apologetic tone, “I was so focused on looking for Qin Yu’er that I didn’t notice Xing Hui was following us... but I heard him when he was sending his man away to alert the others.”

Nanyu pointed at a man wearing the outfit of the Mu Clan nearby. His eyes, nose, mouth, and ears were bleeding. He was unconscious.

Xing Hui’s expression shifted when he saw the man.

He had purposely stayed behind to stop Mo Fan from saving Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er, but that had allowed Nanyu to take his man out!

They were currently on the other side of the hill, so the others would not be able to see what was happening. Mo Fan had also distorted the space with the Chaos Element to isolate the area, meaning that Xing Hui was stranded with no backup!

“Humph, do you really think you can keep me here?” Xing Hui chuckled.

Why was he panicking?

His opponent was only a petty Mage who had just reached the Super Level not long ago! Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er were still stuck in the rift. He just had to take out Mo Fan and hand Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er over to Mu Feiluan!

“Nanyu, look after them. I’ll finish him in no time,” Mo Fan was relieved. Nanyu was extremely reliable when it mattered, unlike that idiot Zhao Manyan.

“Mm, be careful,” Nanyu was confident in Mo Fan’s strength.

—

Even though Xing Hui claimed he was going to fight Mo Fan, he immediately took off with his magic Equipment and headed for the other side of the hill.

As long as anyone from the alliance learned what was going on here, the Heresy Judgment Mages would treat Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue as its enemy. It was much easier than having a showdown with Mo Fan.

His magic Boots gave him the ability to jump around as agilely as a beast. He stepped on the ice and bounced around to reach the top of the mountain.

“The Ice Witch is here! She’s here!” Xing Hui yelled from up on the mountain, hoping that someone could hear him. However, he was stunned by the sight before him.

Mo Fan stood at the foot of the hill like he had been waiting for him. More importantly, the rift that Mu Ningxue and Qin Yu’er were trapped in was right beside him.

He clearly went over the mountain. How had he come back here again?

Xing Hui quickly turned around and ran to the other side of the hill, but he soon felt a chill running down his spine. He still arrived at the back of the hill where Mo Fan was looking at him with an eerie grin!

Space Distortion!

Xing Hui did not fall into an illusion. No matter which side of the mountain he ran to, he would end up at the same side where Mo Fan was. Mo Fan had already manipulated the space with the Chaos Magic!
