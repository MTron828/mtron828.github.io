It was not Beny’s first time coming to annoy them. He even abused his noble status to grant himself access to the Chinese team’s resting area. There were times when Mu Ningxue really had the urge to toss the man into the canals again in annoyance, just like Mo Fan had!

“Prince Beny, I believe it’s time for you to go back to your place. It’s meaningless for you to provoke us here!” Jiang Shaoxu snapped.

“I am not taking part in the match. Besides, I’ve already asked your superior, and he has granted his permission,” Prince Beny replied firmly.

“My teacher did not reject your request out of politeness, and yet you’re shameless enough to barge your way in. You are clearly siding with the Spanish team, and yet you’ve come to our spot. Are you trying to eavesdrop when we are discussing our strategy?” Jiang Yu said suspiciously.

Jiang Yu already considered Mo Fan his friend, and this Beny had come to flirt with Mu Ningxue. Jiang Yu would not allow anyone to take advantage of his friend’s woman!

Although there were no royal families in China, in terms of social status, the representatives on the Chinese team were not inferior to the royal family of Spain. As such, apart from Mu Tingying, who might actually treat Prince Beny seriously, the others completely disregarded his existence.

The truth was, after listening to him blabbering non-stop, Jiang Yu realized that Mo Fan had done the right thing by tossing this self-important jerk into the canals!

“Friend, what did you mean by that? Do you think it is necessary for the Great Spain to eavesdrop on your strategy and formation? Don’t forget, we placed thirteenth in the last World College Tournament, and your team was disqualified right at the beginning!” Beny was not happy with the accusation, and mercilessly riposted.

“Damn it, don’t even mention the last World College Tournament. Your team would have run back home with their tail between their legs if they encountered the American team like we did!” Jiang Yu said furiously.

“Jiang Yu, what’s up with you? Have you forgotten everything I taught you? Where are your manners?” Pang Lai glared at Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu immediately lost his spirit. He did not dare oppose his teacher.

Prince Beny laughed gloatingly when he saw Pang Lai scolding Jiang Yu.

The prince from Spain seemed to have been spoiled growing up. He did not bother concealing his emotions, as if there was no need for him to mind others due to his status.

“Prince Beny, aren’t you supposed to go back? The match is about to begin,” Pang Lai said.

“I’m waiting for that coward. I already told you, it was that guy who treated me impolitely first! The media is full of the news of me being tossed into the canals, and he damaged my reputation. I must settle the dispute with him once and for all!” Prince Beny said.

“So how are you going to settle it?” Mo Fan’s voice rang out.

Prince Beny chuckled as soon as he saw Mo Fan. He said with a provoking look, “You’ve finally shown yourself! It turns out that you still have some courage left. I, however, don’t mind telling you that I’ve asked the Spanish team to give you some special treatment. You will pay if you dare participate in the match!”

“Prince Beny, are you threatening my student?” Pang Lai frowned and said discontentedly.

“I was just saying! If you think I was threatening him, that’s up to you!” Prince Beny replied haughtily, disregarding Pang Lai’s question.

“So you think your team is very strong, and you’re surely going to beat us?” asked Feng Li. His bad temper could no longer stand it.

“We aren’t that strong, but I believe we have quite a good chance to best your team!” Beny said.

In Beny’s eyes, Spain was obviously going to be stronger than China, either because of their ranking during the last World College Tournament, or their global influence.

“Very well, you’re pretty confident...” Feng Li was starting to lose his calm because of the Spanish fop.

Initially, Feng Li had decided not to let Mo Fan take part in the match, as he was late and clearly lacked discipline. He wanted to teach Mo Fan a lesson, just so he would behave well next time.

However, after hearing Prince Beny’s comment, Feng Li believed it was necessary to release the mad hound.

“Mo Fan, since Prince Beny has specifically asked to settle the dispute with you, you will be facing the so-called students of their royal family then!” Advisor Feng Li declared.

Mo Fan grinned. This Prince Beny seriously thought he was afraid!

“Don’t worry, I’ll do my best; I will make sure our team won’t lose too horribly,” Mo Fan said mockingly.

“Oh, yeah, just do your best, we won’t blame you if you lose,” Feng Li instinctively chimed up in concert with Mo Fan when he saw Mo Fan putting up an act.

“Hey, I would really like to motivate myself, aren’t they setting up a bet out there? Help me bet two hundred million on our team winning the match,” Mo Fan yelled in Zhao Manyan’s direction indifferently.

“Two hundred million? Do you have that much... oh, oh, that’s indeed a brilliant way to motivate yourself. If you lose, the two hundred million will be gone just like that, but, that’s the spirit, alright, I’ll bet two hundred million for you!” Zhao Manyan said.

“Prince Beny, I heard your royal family is in charge of most of the trade happening between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, meaning that you must be pretty rich, too. Why don’t you place a bet to cheer for your team?” Mo Fan challenged him.

“Two hundred million, that’s...that’s a bit...how about this, I’ll bet a hundred million, I don’t really have so much cash on me, (cough cough)!” Prince Beny twisted his lips with an unwilling expression.

As a matter of fact, a hundred million was quite a crazy amount of money. Even among Advanced Mages, it was rare to see anyone daring enough to bet a hundred million on a match. However, if Prince Beny withdrew after being provoked by Mo Fan like that, it meant he was simply bullshitting!

He could only afford to bet half the amount. The truth was, Prince Beny was totally unaware of Mo Fan’s background, but he knew who Zhao Manyan was. The financial status of the Zhao Family from China was comparable to the royal family of Spain.

Betting a hundred million was fairly shocking, yet it did not mean he could not get it back. It was legal to bet for the matches of the World College Tournament, and the odds were calculated based on the stakes placed on both teams.

Prince Beny remembered that the odds were currently three to one, meaning that if Spain won, the stake placed on the Chinese team would be split among those that bet on the Spanish team. Betting a hundred million would win him around thirty million.

However, if the Chinese team won, those who bet on the Chinese team would earn triple the stake they placed!

It was similar to sports betting. The World College Tournament had always been a pool of gold for many, as betting was legal in the tournament.

The odds were adjusted based on the stakes placed on both teams. It was fair, since if the dark horse won, those who bet on it would earn a great deal, while those that followed the trend and bet on the expected winner would lose!

The truth was, Mo Fan was basically broke at the moment. The eight hundred million he tried his best to save up was all taken away by Asha’ruiya. He was only fooling around when he yelled at Zhao Manyan. The man was quite smart too, and did not call him out on the spot. He immediately played his role to trick Prince Beny into betting a hundred million too.

Unfortunately, despite how arrogant Prince Beny was, he was not stupid enough to bet two hundred million!

But... making him lose a hundred million was fine, too!

“Fine, a hundred million it is, it turns out that the confidence you have in your team is nothing but talk. Enough provoking, what are you waiting for here? Just go back to your place, stop being an eyesore here,” Mo Fan scoffed.

Prince Beny had a grim face. As a matter of fact, he could not really afford to lose a hundred million in a bet. Being a member of the royal family did not mean he had picked all his money up off the ground!

—

Mo Fan was amused when he saw Beny leave with his tail between his legs. This prince was actually quite stupid to believe that he had actually bet two hundred million on his team to win. He actually sent someone to place the bet for him!

“Mo Fan, aren’t you too reckless? Money doesn’t come easily, how can you bet so much on the match?” Dean Song He said.

“I was only fooling around with him. How could I possibly have that much money?” Mo Fan said.

“Oh, so you weren’t being serious... but why did I see Zhao Manyan going away to place the bet?” Song He said.

Mo Fan was stunned for a moment. He immediately turned around and discovered that Zhao Manyan had actually gone missing!

-F**k me! Shit’s going down!-

“Participants, in your position!” the judge declared as Mo Fan was about to go and stop Zhao Manyan from placing the bet.

Once the judge made the announcement, the participants were required to show up on the stage immediately. Mo Fan was initially planning to chase after Zhao Manyan, yet he was dragged onto the stage by Feng Li forcibly! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Jiang Yu, go stop that idiot, I don’t have any money on me!” Mo Fan cried.

“F**k me, why didn’t you say it earlier! I thought you were crazy, betting so much money on the match!”

“Enough talk, go!”

“I think we’re too late... look at the odds, the number on our side dropped by a decimal point,” Jiang Yu said.

Mo Fan looked up at the screen and discovered that the odds had indeed changed!

Although the bet was open to the whole world, meaning that the stake would be fairly huge, a bet of two hundred million was not small, either, and it was more than enough to change the odds by a decimal point.

However, the little drop of a decimal point was enough to make Mo Fan’s heart explode.

-Is he a pig!?

-Is Zhao Manyan a pig!?-

Mo Fan had been setting up other people for his whole life, yet it turned out that he had been set up by the pig this time!

The man had actually bet two hundred million on the match. If the Chinese team lost, Mo Fan would be done for!
