When they arrived in Wang Xuxu’s room, Mo Fan unleashed his senses to scan the surroundings for clues.

Rong Sheng felt his heart aching as they walked into the room. The night had been like a dream to him, yet it came to an end immediately the next morning. Everything had changed since then.

“I don’t see any clues here, she must have left her room voluntarily,” said Mo Fan.

He turned around and was about to look behind him when he almost bumped into Rong Sheng, who was lost in his thoughts.

Mo Fan said helplessly when he saw Rong Sheng’s expression, “You should stop thinking about it.”

“Wang Xuxu seemed very scared lately. I tried to talk to her, but I felt like she was purposely avoiding me. I was really worried,” said Guo Wenyi.

“What was she scared of?” asked Mo Fan.

“I don’t know... but I feel like she was afraid of Zhao Pinlin,” replied Guo Wenyi.

“It must be Zhao Pinlin! He must be threatening her, that must be it!” Rong Sheng suddenly came to his senses.

It explained why Wang Xuxu would suddenly lose interest in him, even though she had already accepted him the night before. Besides, if she was only concerned about his feelings, why would she allow him to caress her body?

“Zhao Pinlin did come to me that night,” said Mu Ningxue.

“He went to you?” Guo Wenyi and Rong Sheng were startled.

Mu Ningxue briefly described the situation. Anyone could tell that Zhao Pinlin was actually trying to win Mu Ningxue’s affection.

“Wang Xuxu said the same thing to me, too. She said that Zhao Pinlin isn’t very reliable... she was being dead serious, it did not feel like she was joking,” Guo Wenyi took out her phone and showed Mo Fan the messages.

Rong Sheng blurted out, “Look, what did I say, she wasn’t just trying not to hurt me! Zhao Pinlin must have done something to her! He might even have something to do with her disappearance. She was too scared of Zhao Pinlin, so she decided to hide somewhere. Now that the manor is in such a terrifying situation, it’s too dangerous for her to be alone! We have to find her as quickly as possible!”

Mo Fan read the texts. From the content, it seemed like Wang Xuxu was a fairly smart girl. She was able to see the true nature of Zhao Pinlin through his passionate, gentle disguise. In addition, Zhao Pinlin tried to invite Mu Ningxue to spend the night together too. It further proved Wang Xuxu’s point, Zhao Pinlin was unreliable!

“Zhao Pinlin’s gaze had been strange these few days,” Mu Ningxue mused aloud.

Mu Ningxue was not low in IQ either. She could clearly sense Zhao Pinlin had changed lately, especially when he was looking at her. He was not embarrassed after being rejected, nor was he trying to act calm and normal in order to preserve his ego, but seemed rather aggressive!

A few times, Mu Ningxue felt like the man was trying to eat her with his eyes. His cold grin was even implied that she would eventually fall into his hands!

Mu Ningxue was a Magician, and a lot more observant than Zhao Pinlin. The man was utterly clueless that his desire to possess Mu Ningxue was completely exposed even though he was being extremely cautious.

As such, when everyone thought there was something wrong about Zhao Pinlin, she quickly shared her observations with them.

“Strange, how so?” Mo Fan did not realize it in the first place.

“I’ll briefly describe what I felt. Somehow, his gaze looked ambitious. He was watching me closely, but he didn’t actually do anything,” Mu Ningxue shared.

“He was interested in you. Everyone else could easily tell it. We were all discussing it when he invited you to the manor. He thought he was good at hiding his intentions,” said Guo Wenyi.

“No one would not like a pretty and special girl like Mu Ningxue,” whispered Rong Sheng.

“Can we not talk about love and hatred now?” interrupted Mo Fan. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Did they seriously have the mood to discuss this when there were so many corpses lying outside? Mo Fan was utterly speechless about Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi.

Mu Ningxue was disastrously beautiful. Lots of people would fall for her at first glance, but why did it matter now? She was already his wife. No one was allowed to take her away, especially that idiot Zhao Pinlin!

“Mo Fan, I believe we must talk about Zhao Pinlin,” said Mu Ningxue sternly.

“What is there to talk about? Isn’t he the same kind as that retarded Guan Yu?” It was not like Mo Fan was not aware of Zhao Pinlin’s intentions, but he simply did not think of the clown as a threat.

“There’s something wrong about him,” declared Mu Ningxue. It was pure instinct. Mu Ningxue did not have any proof, yet her instincts were telling her that.

At first, Zhao Pinlin tried to win her affection through his polite manners. He left in frustration when she rejected his invitation. However, even after he was together with Wang Xuxu, he still displayed his strong desire to possess her. She even felt an evil aura from him...

“My instincts are telling me that if he used some dishonest methods on Wang Xuxu, he might use them on me, too. I was being extremely careful around him lately,” Mu Ningxue admitted.

“Careful?” Mo Fan was surprised.

Mu Ningxue had already reached the peak of the Intermediate Level. Her strength was even comparable to an Advanced Magician, yet she was still being careful around an ordinary person. That alone implied that there was something seriously wrong about him. When Mo Fan linked the information with Wang Xuxu’s sudden change of behavior, and the fear he sensed from her...

“Stay here, I’ll go find Zhao Pinlin,” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan did not let them follow him. He was reluctant to show Rong Sheng and Guo Wenyi his Shadow Element. Who knew if those two were actually members of the Black Vatican?

Mo Fan came to Zhao Pinlin’s room and saw the room was tightly shut.

However, it was far from a problem for Mo Fan. He first used his Lightning to destroy any surveillance devices nearby, just so the people of the Black Vatican were unable to see his magic.

Mo Fan snuck into Zhao Pinlin’s room with the Fleeing Shadow, but the room was totally empty.

“Strange, didn’t he say he was going back to his room? Where would he be? He’s just an ordinary person; why would he dare to go to other places knowing that there’s poison outside?

“It seems like there’s definitely something fishy about this guy!” Mo Fan grinned. “Where the hell could he be?

“Swift Star Wolf. come out here and sniff at this guy’s clothes, see if you can find him,” Mo Fan summoned the Swift Star Wolf.

The Swift Star Wolf’s handsome face was filled with disdain. It was a wolf, not a dog!

“Awooo, awooo~” The Swift Star Wolf’s nose was more sensitive to blood. He quickly dragged a half-opened case out from under the bed. The case was full of adult toys that even Mo Fan was embarrassed to look at.

“I knew you were not an honorable wolf!” cursed Mo Fan.

“Awooo, awooo!~” The Swift Star Wolf totally disagreed with the unjust accusation.

“You are telling me that the whip has a faint smell of blood, and it’s a woman’s blood?” Mo Fan took out the whip and fell into deep thought while rubbing his chin. “The blood must have stained the whip when they were playing some thrilling game... how intense were they? Even if it’s a role play, he didn’t need to whip her until the girl was bleeding. That Zhao Pinlin seems like a gentleman, but he’s actually mad inside.”

Of course Mo Fan knew about roleplay!

However, whipping was only meant to bring pleasure through pain. If there was blood on it, he was simply torturing the girl!

This Zhao Pinlin, he was getting more suspicious!
