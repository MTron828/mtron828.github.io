“What are they doing? Are they just trying to kill themselves?” Zhang Xiaohou asked in confusion.

“It must be some kind of a ritual. The flames always summon the Sandstorm Magic Locusts here. It’s as if they are trying to be reborn in the flames,” Lin Feili told them.

“The hell?”

While they were speaking, the team saw the Sandstorm Demon Locusts diving into the flames. Their bodies and wings were soon set aflame by the scorching heat.

As the Sandstorm Demon Locusts ventured deeper, more of them were devoured by the flames.

The flames continued to spread among the Sandstorm Demon Locusts. Those with their wings burned to ashes started pouring down on the mountain like rain.

Soon after, the Sandstorm Demon Locusts were lighting up the sky like fireworks as the rain of flames poured down. It lit up the sky in the desert like magic.

The only difference was, these fireworks actually consisted of thousands of Sandstorm Demon Locusts that had just shown up not long ago. The thought of it sent shivers down the spines of the team.

“So this is their ritual? Jumping into a burning pit?” Jiang Shaoxu wondered.

——

The abnormal scene lasted for around an hour. The team could not help but be amazed by the number of Sandstorm Demon Locusts. Despite the overwhelming flames burning across the mountain, it still took such a long time to burn all the Sandstorm Demon Locusts to ashes.

The ashes of the insects scattered across the sky. The flames on the mountain eventually died down, too.

The team only dared to go closer after the flames disappeared. Lin Feili led the team toward the mountain’s top along a meandering path.

“I’m not sure when it all started, but every night, these Sandstorm Demon Locusts will come and set themselves on fire. They are fearless and reckless, as if diving into the flames is actually enjoyable for them. I have never seen a single Sandstorm Demon Locust flee because it’s scared to die,” Lin Feili told them.

“You’re telling me that the same thing actually happens every night? Wouldn’t the Sandstorm Demon Locusts be wiped out if so many of them died every single day?” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“The Burning Mountains don’t really burn all the time. I don’t know where the flames come from, but every time the mountains are set aflame, the Sandstorm Demon Locusts come here,” Lin Feili said.

“How strange!”

“Humph, what does it matter? These Sandstorm Demon Locusts have been a huge problem in the west. The lands they attacked are still barren now because of their overwhelming numbers. Shouldn’t we be glad that they are killing themselves here?” Zheng Tong said.

“You’re right! The more that die to the fire, the fewer there are to bother us!”

“I’m afraid it’s not that simple.”

The team could still feel the heat from the ground as they set foot on the mountain. It was like they were walking on a boiling pan. Soon people were struggling to keep up.

The temperature gradually increased the further they went up the mountain. Eventually, only those with the Fire Element were able to keep going.

“Brother Fan, I’m afraid we can’t go any further. It’s too hot for us,” Zhang Xiaohou said. His sweat was pouring down like rain.

Mu Nujiao, Jiang Shaoxu, and Lingling were unable to go any further. They could not withstand the heat. If they went any further, it was only a matter of time until they passed out from dehydration.

“You guys should head back to the relay station then. I’ll go ahead myself,” Mo Fan did not force the others to go with him.

Lin Feili was a Fire Mage. He told Mo Fan he should reach the top of the mountain if he stuck to the path. He might be able to find the Fire Elemental Sacred Ground there.

—

After Mo Fan left the team, the others had no choice but to take the same path back.

Tong Li was still preoccupied with the thoughts of his sister. He could not help but ask, “Feili, my sister mentioned in her last letter that her squadron had discovered an ore vein. She was told to guard the place. Do you know anything about the ore vein? I’m thinking of going there, perhaps I can find some clues about her whereabouts there.”

Lin Feili was obviously hesitating to answer the man’s question, especially when he mentioned the ore vein.

“I haven’t been able to sleep well these years. I just want an answer. Feili, if you know where my sister is, please tell me, even if she’s only a pile of bones now. I would like to bring her remains back to my hometown,” Tong Li said.

“Lin Feili, do you seriously not remember his sister?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

Lin Feili remained silent for some time. He finally said, “I’ll bring you there, but just you.”

“Sure, thank you, thank you so much. My parents will feel relieved too if I can find my sister’s remains!” Tong Li blurted out in excitement.

“You...you, come with me,” Lin Feili suddenly pointed at Zhang Xiaohou.

“Me? He’s going to get his sister’s remains, why do I have to come too?...” Zhang Xiaohou was confused.

“You’re the only one I trust,” Lin Feili said.

“It’s not like Tong Li is going to do you any harm,” Zhang Xiaohou said helplessly.

“Zhang Xiaohou, just go with them, Lin Feili has been living here for too long. You can’t blame him for being overly sensitive,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Fine.”

—

The others had returned to the relay station to plan their next path deeper into the desert. Meanwhile, Zhang Xiaohou, Lin Feili, and Tong Li went to the mountain of black rocks. It was where Zhang Xiaohou had first met Lin Feili.

The three picked up their pace and soon arrived at the cave where Lin Feili was living. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Why are we here?” Zhang Xiaohou was utterly confused.

Lin Feili went to a corner in the cave and pushed aside a huge rock blocking the path.

Zhang Xiaohou only realized the path was there after the rock was pushed aside. He could not even see the end of the tunnel.

The three ventured deeper into the darkness. Lin Feili seemed extremely familiar with the place. He clearly knew the directions even though the place was pitch-black.

—

After walking for half an hour, the path started heading upward. The three left the cave and found themselves in a basin surrounded by black mountains.

The place was enclosed by the cliffs of the black mountains. The mountains were preventing the wind from blowing the sand in. The basin felt like a secluded place, separated from the desert.

“She was buried here...” Lin Feili pointed at a pile of rocks and sand.

Tong Li was startled. His eyes soon reddened. It had been so many years. Despite the sorrow, the man was utterly relieved that he had managed to find his sister’s remains.

“Can I take her?” Tong Li asked.

“Sure.”

Tong Li moved the stones away and discovered the remains of a person with a smaller bone structure underneath them. He carefully retrieved the bones and placed them in a bag.

“Tong Li, where are you from? It seems like your hometown has the tradition of burying the dead in the place they were born. You risked your life to come here for the sake of it. You are a good man,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“My parents strongly believe that my sister’s soul isn’t going to find peace, since she died in the wild. Commander Zhang, our family will be remembering the dead in a few days. I was hoping to find my sister’s remains before that, so she wouldn’t become a lost soul. I guess I will have to leave soon,” Tong Li said.

“That quick?” Zhang Xiaohou was startled.

“Yeah, our family holds the ritual once every four years. Those that died away from home must return before the ritual, or they will have to wait another four years. I’m not sure if I can make it in time either, but I can’t just leave my sister’s remains here,” Tong Li said.

“But the others aren’t planning to go back yet.”

“We already put some markers down along the way back, so I can just follow the markers. The only problem is the sand river, but luckily, my secondary Element is the Wind Element. I should be able to look after myself. I wasn’t expecting much at the start, but you were able to find Lin Feili. Brother Lin Feili, thank you so much!” Tong Li said.

“I have been talking to her over the years. It’s good that you’re bringing her back. I believe she prefers to go back to her hometown,” Lin Feili said.

Zhang Xiaohou was startled, but he soon realized something.

Lin Feili must have come here quite often to talk to the graves. However, Zhang Xiaohou was still confused about one thing. Why was Lin Feili still living here on his own, instead of trying to leave the desert? Did he have some other reasons?

—

Tong Li left by himself. Zhang Xiaohou felt a surge of emotions watching the man leave. The man had put his life at risk just so he could bury his sister back in his hometown.

“Commander Zhang, where are you from?” Lin Feili asked. He was becoming more fluent.

“From the south, I’m from Bo City,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“Why are you here in the west?” Lin Feili asked.

“To gain some knowledge and experience. How about you? Why did you choose to stay?” Zhang Xiaohou asked.

“I was told to guard this place,” Lin Feili said.

“An order?” Zhang Xiaohou was startled.

Lin Feili nodded.

“You almost forgot who you are. Why would you still care about the order? The person that gave you the order might even be dead by now,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

“He’s already dead, and I should have died here too, but...” Lin Feili paused in the middle of the sentence. He was glancing around the spacious basin.

“Is there something else here? I feel like you’re quite mindful of it,” Zhang Xiaohou asked indifferently.

“Mm, I’m only alive because I didn’t want the truth to be hidden...”

“The truth?” Zhang Xiaohou asked confusedly.

“Do you really think that the relay station was gone because of a sandstorm?” Lin Feili asked.

“Wasn’t it?”

Lin Feili had a wry smile, but his eyes gradually filled with hatred.

“What happened?” Zhang Xiaohou knew something was not right. His voice was serious.

Lin Feili shook his head, and did not answer the question.
