Su Xiaoluo almost burst into tears when she was nailed to the spot.

She could not understand why the Chief would do such a thing. If it weren’t for Liu Ru putting her life at stake to protect them, everyone would have died to Fang Gu!

So what if she were an undead? She had sacrificed herself to protect the villagers when she was not even obliged to do so! In the end, the chief returned her kindness with ingratitude instead. If the chief was trying to protect his people when he decided not to help the people from Sunny Goat Village, what was he trying to achieve now?

When Su Xiaoluo saw the different spells sweeping past her and blasted the debris that Liu Ru was trapped in, she could feel her heart clenching tightly...

“That’s enough, we need her corpse to report back, too many people have died here!” The captain with the thick brows gave the command to stop the consecutive attacks.

“She didn’t even kill the people here!” snapped Su Xiaoluo furiously.

“It doesn’t matter, we’ve caught one at least,” said the Huntress calmly.

“You... how can you do this? Many innocent lives were lost because you came late, and now you’re trying to accuse her falsely instead!” yelled Su Xiaoluo.

“We came late? If we didn’t make it in time, the woman would have killed all of you, you won’t be alive now to scold us!” said the Huntress.

“Chief, say something, tell them that...”

The chief Xie Sang remained silent. He lowered his head with a complicated look.

“Mm, where’s the body?”

“Did we just blast her into ashes?” said one of the Hunters.

“Impossible, the woman was extraordinarily strong. She didn’t even budge when my Fiery Fist landed on her...”

The Hunters kept searching the debris, yet they failed to find anything apart from some torn clothes. The captain with thick brows immediately shoved the people aside and looked for the body himself, yet he found nothing either.

“Did she run away?” said the Huntress in astonishment. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Humph, she won’t escape from us. Tell the others to hunt her down! We can’t let her stay in the Ancient Capital...” snapped the captain furiously.

——

Cold drizzle poured down from the clear sky, landing on some ancient little alleyway.

The windows and doors in the alleyway were shut tightly. There was no sign of any pedestrians nearby in the dark...

A glamorous silhouette slowly appeared from the shadows. Her hair was disheveled from the rain. Her clothes were in a messy state. Her exposed skin was covered in wounds.

She staggered forward holding onto the walls. She would cough heavily at times, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.

“HAHAHA, I’m telling you, that chick was smart not to drink the glass that I drugged. Otherwise, I would have dragged her into a corner now and sent her to cloud nine!” a rough voice spoke in the alley.

“How about us, I loved that chick’s legs, they are so long. I wonder how it would feel when they wrapped around my waist. Tsk tsk... boss, boss, look!” said the young man wearing an earring pointing at the sexy back in the pitch-black alley.

“She seems drunk. I’m getting a boner just by looking at her. That waist, those legs, that ass!”

“The chick from before managed to escape, but now we’ve found a better one. Look at her clothes... it feels like she already had a rough time before.” The young man with an earring was fully excited.

“Come, let’s follow her. I’ve never tried doing it in the rain, let alone with someone so sexy!”

The few young men with a strong smell of alcohol about them hurried forward. The one leading the way with a gold chain around his neck went up to Liu Ru and stared at her face.

He was completely astounded after taking a glance. A true beauty; not only was she pretty, she even had the alluring weak temperament. Her exposed collar bones were invoking a strong desire to ‘protect’ her!

“Hey gorgeous, are you drunk? Our place is just ahead, do you want to come with us to take a rest?” said the man with the gold chain holding an umbrella in his hand.

“Yeah, yeah!” The other two were so excited that they had a strong urge to pounce on her. She was simply too attractive!

Liu Ru took a deep breath. Her eyes suddenly emitted an inhuman flicker of light...

She glanced at the little gangsters trying to take advantage of her coldly. If she were just a weak woman, the Heavens knew what they would do to her...

“Scum!” cursed Liu Ru coldly.

“Yo, how did you know that we’re going to do something bad to you!” The young man with an earring burst out laughing.

“Let...let me first...” The other young man reached his hand out toward Liu Ru. He could not wait to fondle her long legs!

Liu Ru immediately turned around, revealing the fangs under her red upper lip. The sharp fangs flickered coldly in the dark alleyway. Together with her pair of inhuman eyes, they gave her an eerie, intimidating appearance!

The young man trying to touch Liu Ru’s legs were stunned. He stood still in his spot, as if he had lost his soul.

With two more flickers from Liu Ru’s eyes, she fired the same spell at the other two gangsters. The men with perverted grins immediately shuddered, before their faces were replaced with blank expressions, like puppets.

“Bring me to where you live,” demanded Liu Ru coldly.

“Yes...” The three had completely turned into brainless walking flesh. They mechanically escorted Liu Ru like an empress to the end of the alleyway...

Liu Ru’s blood fangs were still exposed under her lips. She glanced at the three men’s necks...

The Blood Tribe had a stronger urge to drink blood after suffering from serious injuries. She could already smell their alcohol-heavy blood. Basically, if she drank their blood, she would immediately recover from the injuries she had.

Liu Ru took a deep breath and withheld the urge to drink the filthy blood in the end.

She felt disgusted at just the thought of touching the three scum, let alone drinking their blood by sticking her lips onto their necks!

——

As she arrived at the end of the alleyway, she saw a house in fairly good condition. Liu Ru controlled them to escort her into one of the rooms, before sending one of them to buy her clean clothes and the other one to get her blood serums.

The clothes came fairly quickly, but the blood serums were too expensive. Also, anyone trying to buy blood serums would have to record their names and be approved by a Magician. An ordinary gangster would surely not able to buy one, leaving Liu Ru in a difficult position.

She had lost quite a fair amount of her primary blood. She would remain in a weakened state if she did not replenish kt. Not only would she recover at a very slow rate, it would even affect her actions.

“Who’s there?” When Liu Ru was feeling lost thinking about what to do, she heard someone moving in the garden.

The person was very nimble, and Liu Ru barely heard them. The truth was, it was almost impossible for a human to avoid being detected by her.

Liu Ru ran outside and discovered the garden to be empty, apart from a few packages containing something red under the shed...

“Blood serums?’ Liu Ru looked at them in astonishment.

She immediately looked around, wanting to know who had placed something she needed so desperately here, but the place was completely empty.

“Who exactly did this? How did he or she know I needed these... does this mean the person has been following me all along?” mumbled Liu Ru in confusion, staring at the blood serums.

Unable to arrive at a conclusion, Liu Ru quickly consumed them.

If the person was trying to harm her, he or she could have done so already. She was in an extremely weak state, even an ordinary Intermediate Magician could end her life right now...
