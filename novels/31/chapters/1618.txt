Chapter 1620 Holy Essence: Heaven Protection Sword

Translated by XephiZ

The Cruel Ocean Serpent attacked as the yacht turned around. This time, it took the straightforward approach. It simply slammed its massive body into the yacht!

Zhao Manyan quickly set up a defense. The serpent’s tail slammed through the water and knocked the yacht into the air, like a bat hitting a home run. The people on the yacht immediately felt the world spinning!

Luckily, the attack did not break through Zhao Manyan’s defense. He managed to protect the yacht too, but it clearly did not work faultlessly. A few more hits, and both the yacht and the people on it would be crushed to pieces.

“Don’t just rely on me, I can’t hold on any longer!” Zhao Manyan blurted out with a twisted expression.

Once again, Zhao Manyan was facing a Ruler-level creature. He really missed the pleasant days when he could just stand there and let the Commander-level creatures attack him at will. Unlike then, he now had to use his strongest defensive spells against a random attack from a Ruler-level creature. If he took another hit, all his defensive equipment was going to be useless!

“We are at its mercy since we can’t go to the island!” Mo Fan grumbled.

“It’s coming again!” Mu Bai yelled.

Mo Fan cast a Lightning Spell, but the Cruel Ocean Serpent was extremely cunning. It quickly hid in the water as soon as it noticed the destructive presence of the Lightning Magic. Even though the water would conduct lightning, it would weaken its damage at the same time. It would be difficult to stop the creature when it returned after dodging Mo Fan’s spell.

As a matter of fact, there was nothing they could do when the Ruler-level creature was abusing its surroundings like that. It could easily drag the four of them to the bottom of the ocean without losing a single scale!

The Cruel Ocean Serpent sprang out of the water, its body extending horizontally over the surface. The dense scales covering it suddenly rose up like spikes!

“F**k me, was this thing crossbred with a hedgehog!?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The Cruel Ocean Serpent was now fully covered in spikes. As the creature started to spin at a shocking rate, the spikes became the blades of a shredder!

The Cruel Ocean Serpent was huge. It felt like a meat mincer was rolling at them. The yacht had no chance of outrunning it. Water was spraying all over the place from the spinning blades!

“We are done for!” Zhao Manyan’s face was full of despair.

Mo Fan had a stern face, too. The Cruel Ocean Serpent was attacking them at close range after wearing out their defense. They would need a Super Spell to defend themselves from the creature’s move!

“Should we just jump into the water?” Mu Bai asked quickly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s going to swallow us if we go into the water,” Heidi countered.

“Should we all just fly our separate ways then?” Zhao Manyan suggested prior to dying.

“Are you f**king serious? How did you mess up the proverb?”

“Are you f**king serious? Why do you even care if I’m using the right proverb at a time like this?”

Heidi was utterly speechless about how reckless these men were. The horrifying meat mincer was right before them, yet they were still yelling at one another. She knew she could not rely on Mo Fan’s defense. She saw Mu Bai trying his best to prepare himself. She also unleashed her Will.

Heidi had gathered all three facets of her Will. She was planning to set up a wall in front of her, using the waves to reduce the Cruel Ocean Serpent’s speed.

Unfortunately, the silver glow did not last very long, nor did the Cruel Ocean Serpent slow down by much. It was still closing on them. Its massive body and terrifying spikes were crushing them mentally, as if there was nothing they could do apart from waiting for their deaths!

“Holy Essence: Heaven Protection Sword!”

A sacred voice suddenly descended from the sky, like protection from the God of Light. A holy blue light pierced through the gloomy clouds, followed by an enormous sword engulfed in a sacred blue radiance. It was spectacular, as if God’s punishment had descended upon the mundane world.

The huge sword slammed into the ocean in front of the yacht. Mo Fan and the others lifted their eyes and saw the light of the sword keeping the Cruel Ocean Serpent away from the yacht.

The Cruel Ocean Serpent rammed into the light barrier, and amazingly some of its sturdy spikes were broken at the impact! Fresh blood was pouring out from the wounds!

The Heaven Protection Sword was unstoppable; its incredible light knocked the Cruel Ocean Serpent back. The creature thrashed about on the surface of the sea while its blood poured out like a storm. Mo Fan and the others behind the Heaven Protection Sword were lost in wonder. How much force did it take to knock the enormous creature flying?

A moment later, the Cruel Ocean Serpent returned to the surface. It had been seriously injured and frightened by the spell. Its head rose from the water, and it stared at the human shrouded by the sacred light.

The Cruel Ocean Serpent did not dare to provoke them further after sensing their formidable aura. It dove into the water and fled for its life!

The sea had provided the creature with a perfect environment to run away in. It was difficult to hunt the Cruel Ocean Serpent down unless there was a strong Water Mage around.

The figure encapsulated by the holy blue light slowly came down from the sky. Zhao Manyan knew she was beautiful just by looking at her silhouette. He blurted out, “The goddess of light has come to save us!”

The light eventually faded away. The woman soon revealed herself. She smiled at Mo Fan and Heidi before saying gently, “What did you all do to provoke a strong creature like that?”

“Miss...Miss Brianca!?” Zhao Manyan yelled with mixed feelings.

Zhao Manyan was extremely excited after being saved. He was utterly taken in by the woman’s Light Magic and her beauty. Wasn’t she the goddess he had been looking for all along?

He did not expect the woman to be Brianca. It was actually his first time seeing her using Light Magic. Since when was her Light Magic so powerful?

“Miss Brianca, if you were even a little late, we would all be dead by now,” Heidi said.

“But, how come you’re here?” Mo Fan was overjoyed, yet confused.

When Brianca parted ways with them, she said she would be back in half a month, but they had not heard from her since then. They eventually went to the Pyramid and spent four months in it, meaning that it had been half a year since Brianca left. They thought Brianca had already gone back to the Alps Institute!

“I tried looking for you, but Fenna didn’t want to tell me where you went, so I’ve been staying in Venice. I heard from Heidi that you were going to Greece. I was a little worried about you guys, so I’ve been waiting for you at the island!” Brianca let out a relieved sigh after learning that everyone was fine.

She had to leave before because of something important. Otherwise, she would not have been away for so long.

“It looks like a group of Mages is heading our way,” Mu Bai called out to the others.

Brianca looked back at the island and said, “I bet they are from the Shoreline Alliance. They must have come to ask what happened.”

“They didn’t bother showing up when the Cruel Ocean Serpent was so close to the island. They only show up at the end, just like usual. I don’t want to waste my time on them. Let’s continue on our way to Greece,” Mo Fan scoffed.

“Fine,” Brianca nodded.

Mo Fan was worried that the people of the Shoreline Alliance would ask them about the Cruel Ocean Serpent. The creature was after Apas, and her sensitive identity might bring them some unwanted trouble. It would only complicate things if they ended up being accused of disturbing the peace of the resort island. Besides, he had no idea which country the island belonged to, or what kind of rules their Magic Association had.

“Lucky, the yacht can still move. Zhao Manyan, use your magic to speed it up. The Shoreline Alliance is catching up to us,” Mu Bai said.

“Miss Brianca, you are a Light Mage, too? Can you give me some advice if you are free? What tier is your Holy Essence? It’s so cool. I didn’t know the strongest single-target Super Spell could be used defensively, too! That’s so crazy!” Zhao Manyan was very taken with Brianca after seeing her Light Magic. He was like a primary school student, about to take out his notebook to record everything he was told.

“Humph, now you know how strong Miss Brianca is!” Heidi stated.

“Hehe, does Miss Brianca accept male disciples?” Zhao Manyan asked, grinning foolishly.

“You should take care of the yacht first,” Brianca smiled. She did not take Zhao Manyan’s words seriously. She was looking Mo Fan up and down instead.

Mo Fan rubbed his chin and asked directly, “Why are you looking at me? Do I look more handsome now?”

“You’ve done something incredible again. I heard an island has appeared at the end of the Red Sea...” Brianca said.

“Miss Brianca, I’ll tell you everything. We are still pretty far from Greece.” Heidi had suddenly turned into a talkative little girl. She wrapped her arms around Miss Brianca like her teacher was her older sister.

“Sure, I can’t wait to hear it!”
