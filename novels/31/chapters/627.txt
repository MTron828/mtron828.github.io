“Liu Ru, did you say that someone gave you blood serums?” asked Mo Fan sternly.

“Yeah, the guy is good at concealing his presence. The truth is, I noticed him when we entered Hua Village, but I was only sure when he sent me the blood serums,” Liu Ru nodded.

“Someone has been following us?” Mo Fan’s heart sank.

“I don’t think it’s us; he’s following the people of Hua Village. Since he gave me the blood serums, maybe he’s not an enemy. Otherwise, I would have been dead,” said Liu Ru.

“What about the person following us now?” Mo Fan asked.

“I think it’s...”

“It’s me!” Before Liu Ru could answer, the voice of a middle-aged man interrupted.

The two turned around and saw a man in a hooded raincoat walking out from behind a huge sculpture. His sideburns were white, but his hair was black. His face was like a young man in his thirties, yet his eyes were full of the signs of age.

“You’re...” Mo Fan glanced at the man in astonishment.

Mo Fan had a slight impression of the man. He was the one holding the child in the crowd of seven hundred people. He had handed the child to a woman before standing on the outer layer. Mo Fan was clueless about why the man had been following him. -Don’t tell me the man was trying to repay his kindness for saving the crowd’s life?-

“Fang Gu!” Liu Ru glared at the man.

The evil Necromancer had murdered the villagers of Hua Village. Liu Ru did not have a good impression of him. She even felt like the man was somewhat a maniac!

“So he’s Fang Gu?” Mo Fan was even more surprised.

Impressive! This Fang Gu had blended in with the crowd and pretended to be a commoner by holding an infant as a disguise.

“Girl, I think you should think carefully before unleashing your anger. I’m not the one trying to kill you. I’m not the one who betrayed you to the City Hunters, either. I only want the people of Hua Village dead, I won’t kill anyone unless they try to stop me!” Fang Gu slowly walked towards them.

He did not bring any undead with him, as if he was trying to tell them he was not an enemy.

“Liu Ru, stay calm, let’s hear what he has to say... I think the whole thing is more complicated than I thought,” Mo Fan said to Liu Ru.

Liu Ru, who always listened to Mo Fan, could only place her hostility aside for now.

“I have to make something clear, I’ve nothing to do with the death of the other villages,” said Fang Gu seriously.

“Who else could it be?!” Liu Ru demanded, her eyes wide.

“The Black Vatican,” replied Fang Gu calmly. He purposely glanced at Mo Fan, as he expected Mo Fan to react differently when he heard the name Black Vatican.

“Go on,” Mo Fan said grimly.

“I inserted the Water of Kun into my undead’s bodies, and unintentionally discovered that the Water of Kun can let my undead appear during the day. Obviously, the Black Vatican somehow knew the secret. They chose a suitable time to butcher the other six villages to acquire the Water of Kun. They then let their alchemists refine the Dew of Nine Serenities using the Water of Kun, and mixed it into the rain to invoke this undead disaster,” explained Fang Gu.

Mo Fan listened seriously. Fang Gu’s statement perfectly fit his speculation about the rain!

Most importantly, the Black Vatican had also used the Underground Holy Spring to refine the Enraging Spring, resulting in the Calamity of Bo City!

“After you escorted the people of Hua Village away, I killed the remaining people at Hua Village and took the Water of Kun,” Fang Gu confessed.

“Was that really necessary?” asked Mo Fan.

“Hatred can only be magnified, it can never be put down...oh, your little scouts are back, you should check out the information they brought back,” Fang Gu pointed at the little red bats flying in the air.

Liu Ru received them with her hand and placed the little bats close to her ears to listen to their soft murmurs.

A moment later, Liu Ru looked at Mo Fan in confusion and whispered, “It seems like they are being held captive. There’s some kind of black mutated monkey-like creature hiding behind the fake mountains, as if they are waiting for someone to take the bait.”

“Black mutated monkey-like creature?” The description felt extremely familiar to Mo Fan.

“They are Dark Beast Monsters and the Cursed Beasts. I’ve already made contact with them. It seems like they mistakenly assumed that I’m on their side, but now they have realized it isn’t the case. They want me to hand over the Water of Kun, but unfortunately, I’ve already inserted the Water of Kun into my undead’s bodies, and they are my people...” said Fang Gu.

“So you’re telling me all this because you want to team up with me to deal with the Black Vatican?” asked Mo Fan.

“Mm, I saw you with the people of Bo City, and found out that you’re from Bo City, too. I have to tell you something. The truth is, the Water of Well in my village started going missing around ten years ago. I didn’t know why, but it seems like some traitors gave it to the Black Vatican for their experiments. Three years ago, the water inside the well suddenly dried up. A huge supply of the Water of Kun went missing...and not long after, the Calamity of Bo City took place,” said Fang Gu.

“Are you trying to say that they used Bo City as a testing ground?” asked Mo Fan, his eyes suddenly turning bloodshot.

“Exactly!” Fang Gu nodded.

Liu Ru was stunned by the words. The whole country knew about the Calamity of Bo City, yet it turned out that it was only a test run for the Black Vatican!

Were human lives even less significant than livestock in the eyes of the Black Vatican, that they could simply kill so many innocent people just to achieve their goal!?

Even Liu Ru, who was not involved in the Calamity of Bo City, knew that it was Hell on Earth, let alone someone like Mo Fan who was right in the middle of it...

No wonder Liu Ru could sense a strong murderous aura from Mo Fan after he heard the truth!

That was Mo Fan’s hometown!

“Why are you telling me this?” Mo Fan’s chest was heaving. He tried his very best to keep calm as he asked the question.

“They are holding the people of Hua Village captive to lure me out, and your friend is caught in it, too. I’m suggesting us three to work together, you go save your friend, and I’ll kill the people of Black Vatican trying to hunt me down...” Fang Gu revealed his motive.

As long as the Black Vatican was still on his trail, his undead villagers would still be targeted.

Fang Gu had failed to protect his villagers when they were alive, but now that they were dead, he would not allow anyone to harm them further!

“What do you think?” Fang Gu asked further, after seeing Mo Fan remaining silent.

Mo Fan shook his head.

Fang Gu frowned. He assumed Mo Fan would accept his offer, as they both had a common enemy, not to mention that his friend Zhang Xiaohou was being held captive too.

“You help me to save my friend, I’ll kill those sons o’ bitches myself!” Mo Fan’s voice was cold as ice, filled with bone-piercing murderous intent!

-Assholes!

-Assholes, these Black Vatican assholes!

-They used Bo City as a test run!

-Do they really see Bo City as a city of white mice!?-

God might be blind to allow these scum to live in this world, but Mo Fan swore that he would send every single one of them to the eighteenth layer of Hell!
