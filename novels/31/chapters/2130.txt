“If it’s not the culprit, why are we wasting our time on it?” Zhao Manyan said.

Mu Bai shook his head and said, “Finding out whether it’s the culprit or not after taking it down is what the military and the knights are thinking. We can’t just sit here and do nothing, since it’s only going to cause panic. Besides, the Tyrant Titans must be linked to one another in some way. Otherwise, Tuis wouldn’t be so angry after they let a Tyrant Titan escape.”

Mo Fan nodded, agreeing with Mu Bai.

It did not matter if the Glutton was the culprit they were after. The whole of Crete was on alert. Taking down one or two Tyrant Titans would bring the people some relief!

“Fine, we’ll try our best to capture the Tyrant Titan so you can recover your health,” Zhao Manyan said.

“By the way, what’s with the Tyrant Blood Inferior Dragon that Poseidon mentioned?” Mo Fan asked.

“The dragons have always colluded with the Tyrant Titans. The Inferior Dragons and Pseudo-Dragons in Europe are crossbreeds, just like Zhao Manyan, who hooks up with every woman he sees. Therefore, the Tyrant Titans are always found with a few Inferior Dragons, Pseudo-Dragons, and other mixed-breed dragons. The powerful Inferior Dragons are comparable to the Tyrant Titans, while the mixed-breed dragons have overwhelming numbers. We will need an army to fend them off,” Mu Bai explained.

“Green Tea Man, why must you use me as a comparison? Weren’t you lying in a coffin for a long time? Why do you know so much? Don’t tell me you were reading books in the coffin?” Zhao Manyan complained.

“I already knew these things before. I’m not like you two. I enjoy reading books about different countries. The books about dragons and Tyrant Titans were interesting to me. After the incident at the Ancient Capital, I came to the Aegean Sea and stayed here for a while for a change of scenery, but I didn’t stay on Crete,” Mu Bai replied evenly.

‘Yeah, sure thing, you read a lot of books, including the recipe for aphrodisiacs!” Zhao Manyan had to say.

Mu Bai’s face darkened.

Damn it, when will they ever stop talking about it!?

“That’s great, I always fall asleep when I read books. So what great ideas do you have on how we can capture the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan?” Mo Fan asked.

“Are you familiar with poppies?” Mu Bai asked.

“The plant they normally use to make anesthetics?” Mo Fan was not that stupid.

“Mm, some greedy people use them to make drugs. As for the Sea Monkey Monsters, a little cave can have three to four of their nests. There are plenty of places with more than five hundred Sea Monkey Monsters on them. We can’t possibly watch them all, so the poppies should be our focus...” Mu Bai said.

“Can you find their exact location? Otherwise, we will be wasting our time if we wait in one spot. Tuis has the knights helping him. We must find the Tyrant Titan before him,” Mo Fan said.

“I can try. Give me some time to find out the plant distribution on Crete,” Mu Bai nodded.

“It might take you a long time to collect the data. I’ll ask Lingling to help you prepare it,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s even better!” Mu Bai agreed. It would be a lot easier to find the spots where the Tyrant Titan might show up with Lingling’s help!

——

Mo Fan bought a box of fruit and carried it on his shoulder on their way back.

Zhao Manyan was confused. He did not understand why Mo Fan was trying so hard to disguise himself as a worker. Did it even matter if the other guests knew they were Mages? The chance of some strangers in such a remote place beating them up was almost zero, considering their strength!

“Something is odd about them. They are definitely doing some illegal stuff, so I’m quite curious,” Mo Fan explained.

“That’s quite a special hobby you have.”

The inn provided its guests with three meals; Harper was the one cooking all of them. It was strange how Harper was a lazy person, yet he was oddly patient when it came to preparing food, drinks, and fruits. He could spend a whole day cutting ingredients and cooking food while listening to music.

“Harper, are you sure the creature you saw had a cross mark on its back?” Mo Fan asked.

“Can I swear in the name of my grandmother?” Harper replied.

“You don’t have to go that far. Just swear that if you lie to us, you will be sexually impotent for the rest of your life.”

“You saved my life, I wouldn’t lie to you,” Harper said seriously.

“Alright, I trust you,” Mo Fan said.

——

They spent a few more days resting at the inn while Mu Bai and Lingling shared information remotely. Lingling eventually pinpointed a few possible locations.

Mu Bai sat in the common room of the house, wondering which spot they should wait at. They had found five possible locations, yet there were only the three of them, not to mention he was half-crippled now. It was impossible to keep an eye on every spot.

“You guys are being quite serious.” Harper had mixed some fruit cocktails. He leaned forward when he saw Mu Bai frowning in front of the laptop.

“We were never joking,” Mu Bai took the cocktail glass from Harper.

“You should leave these three spots out. Just focus on the other two,” Harper pointed at two of the locations after taking a quick glance at the map.

Mu Bai turned and looked at Harper. Harper was displeased by Mu Bai’s reaction.

“Why are you looking at me like that? Do you think I’m just a good-for-nothing who only knows how to hook up with the ladies? I’m smarter than most people. I grew up close to the Aegean Sea, and I worked in a lot of forestry stations. I’ve planted olive trees and roses before. I also planted poppies when I was desperate for money, so I know the areas where you can find them; I only stopped doing it because it’s harmful to young ladies. Otherwise, I would be a hundred times richer than your blond friend. I might be poor, but I have a conscience!” Harper exclaimed.

“I could never tell that you had learned the importance of protecting future generations. Why do these two spots have the highest possibility?” Mu Bai’s impression of Harper had changed a little.

“There are many wild poppies on this island. I remember moving some of them in the past, but the water nearby is very shallow. It’s easy for ships to get stranded, so we rarely go there. The Tyrant Titans are massive sea creatures, and prefer deeper waters. Even though they have long legs to move on the land, if they are in deeper waters, they can easily escape into the sea and move more freely,” Harper explained.

“So they won’t go to this island, because the water is shallow?” Mu Bai asked, pointing at it.

“Mm, they might raid it, but they won’t treat it as a feeding ground. They won’t go over here, either. The Tyrant Titans aren’t fond of snakes. This place has the biggest sea snakes from Africa, who like to come to the Aegean Sea for vacation.

“As for this one, you have obviously not been to it in person. There are only fake poppies there.”

Mu Bai shook his head helplessly after hearing Harper’s explanations.

He would never beat a local’s knowledge, no matter how much preparation he had!
