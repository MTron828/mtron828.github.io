Chapter 1350 Act in Contravention

Flames poured down from the Fury Flames Sky Diagram. The trails of the flames burst through the clouds and ridges, forming spectacular fiery pillars. The flames lunged at the Black Goat General. The creature raised its hammer again to defend itself.

However, the Black Goat General was struggling to resist the Flame Belle’s overwhelming power. The flames spread wildly after landing on the hammer, covering everything within a kilometer. It was a great display of how powerful the flames were.

The Black Goat General slid down the mountain and was knocked to a lower altitude by the flames. There were a few gentle slopes nearby, but they were only around the height of the Black Goat General’s knees.

The Black Goat General slid across the hills and razed them to the ground!

Its hammers were blazing red from the heat of the flames. Their scorching heat spread to the Black Goat General’s arms, forcing it to toss the hammers to the ground. The hammers were the same size as the hills!

“Nicely done!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

As he thought, Little Flame Belle was strong enough to take on the creature. Mo Fan was clearly struggling against it. The new abilities he had recently acquired was obviously not that effective against the enormous creature.

Mo Fan had no intention of using his newest abilities for the time being, either. Cheng Ying and the Shepherd would be much more cautious if they learned he had acquired Bei Jiang’s abilities!

Flame Belle was not done with her attacks. She floated freely in the sky and glided down the steep slopes, followed by flames engulfing her like a blazing robe.

The Calamity Fire burned vigorously as she was gliding down. She gradually turned into the outline of a Vermilion Bird as she charged at the Black Goat General.

The Vermilion Bird’s size was quite impressive. It was like a cloud when it fully extended its wings, ramming into the Black Goat General and stirring up a great storm as it knocked the Black Goat General to the ground.

The mountains were devoured by the flames. Mo Fan looked down and saw the entire basin had turned into a burning ocean. He could not help but feel impressed by Little Flame Belle’s strength. Mo Fan felt like he did not even need to take part in the battle.

“Little Flame Belle is taking care of the monster. Let’s go after those two. We can’t let them run away!” Zhao Manyan finally showed up again.

“It’s fine, we’ll take care of this Black Goat General first,” Mo Fan shook his head.

“Why? Are you seriously willing to let them run away?” Zhao Manyan said.

“I’ve already planted the Dark Material in their bodies. I can easily tell where they are. Just let them go. If they don’t feel confident and safe, we’ll never come into contact with the Chief Extraditor and the Red Cardinals,” Mo Fan told him.

The Fiendish Night was the best Dark Material when it came to tracking down targets. Mo Fan would immediately receive feedback from the Dark Material whenever Cheng Ying and the Shepherd cast the simplest spell. Mo Fan did not show up intending to take the assholes out. He believed they would assume they had gotten away safely after this encounter, allowing him to track down the authorities of the Black Vatican!

“What Dark Material?” Zhao Manyan was clueless about what Mo Fan was saying.

“Anyway, they won’t run away from us... I’m feeling a little hungry, let’s have some roasted lamb tonight!” Mo Fan said.

“...” Zhao Manyan was left speechless.

Mo Fan was a battle maniac. He could not rely on Little Flame Belle every time. If he was up against someone like Bei Jiang, even Little Flame Belle could not do anything to them. As such, he had to keep improving through endless battles!

“I’m seriously going to die because of you one day!” Zhao Manyan grumbled.

Zhao Manyan was circling in the sky like a golden eagle.

Around a thousand meters below them, the enormous Black Goat General was recklessly destroying everything. It tried to climb back up to the highway to kill more humans, but Flame Belle did not give it a chance. She continued to blast the Black Goat General and injure it.

A huge creature usually had outstanding vitality. Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan did not want the creature to continue with its tantrum. They were waiting for an opportunity to strike while circling in the air!

“Go down!” Mo Fan said.

“Now?”

“Of course!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Zhao Manyan dove from a thousand meters with Mo Fan.

Mo Fan began to unleash his lightning. It was like a lightning tribulation from the Heavens, coming down right at the Black Goat General.

Mo Fan had accumulated lightning in the sky for a long time. Its power was more than double normal as it drilled its way down!

Mo Fan blasted a hole in the Black Goat General’s head. Its brains scattered in the air.

The Black Goat General was focused on the battle against the Flame Belle, totally unaware that Mo Fan was in the sky above it. The powerful lightning bolt staggered the creature. Flame Belle, whose mind was linked to Mo Fan’s, immediately took hold of the opportunity. She uttered a cry, summoning the Calamity Fire of the Heavens and Earth!

The flames swiftly formed a burning sword as tall as a building. Its ripples spread through the sky and burned the trees within a kilometer into ashes.

The burning sword howled and stabbed the Black Goat General in the hole that she had previously left in the creature’s chest. A third of the sword went into the creature’s body. The raging flames set its insides on fire.

The Black Goat General cried out in agony. An evil aura jetted out from the stab wound like a black gas. The Black Goat General began to shrink in size.

The enormous creature that had been like a giant pillar between the sky and the ground soon became small enough to hide among the trees on the mountain.

The little black goat realized it was no match for these maniacs. It immediately fled for its life, but Flame Belle saw through its disguise right away. She forcibly dragged the creature back with Space Magic and prepared to roast it with the Calamity Fire.

Perhaps she had heard Mo Fan mentioning that he wanted to eat some roasted lamb tonight. She could easily roast some delicious lamb shanks for him!

“Oh my! Since when is your Little Flame Belle so strong?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

The enormous creature was so unstoppable, yet it could not do anything to Little Flame Belle. Little Flame Belle in the Adolescent Phase was still dominating when going up against regular creatures!

“She’s currently in the Advanced Commander-level!” Mo Fan smiled.

“Doesn’t that mean she is very close to becoming a Ruler-level creature?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed. “If she’s already so strong in the Adolescent Phase, won’t she be a lot stronger than normal Ruler-level creatures once she reaches the Adult Phase? What a lucky bastard you are!”

“Do you have any idea how much I’ve spent on her ‘milk powder’?” Mo Fan retorted.

The money he had spent on Little Flame Belle was almost the same as the money he had spent on himself! Lingling had already mentioned right at the beginning that if he fed Little Flame Belle ‘milk powder’ of the best quality, she would be stronger than normal Flame Belles. After all, the Flame Belles were a unique Fire Elemental species. Giving her a stronger source of flames would help her to awaken stronger powers!

That being said, Zhao Manyan was right, too. If Little Flame Belle was already so strong in the Adolescent Phase, she was clearly going to be a formidable Ruler-level creature once she reached the Adult Phase!

“Why do I feel like there’s nothing special about the Shepherd? The monster goat is pretty tough, but it’s not something that we can’t defeat,” Zhao Manyan said.

Mo Fan shook his head and said, “I’m afraid you are wrong. He just left the Black Goat General here without bothering to retrieve it. It just means he doesn’t even care about this Summoned Beast. Besides, he’s called the Shepherd. Have you ever seen a shepherd with only one sheep?”

Zhao Manyan blurted out in surprise, “Holy crap, are you saying the guy has a whole pack of these monsters?”

“I bet so; the Shepherd is very powerful, indeed. It won’t end up well if we insisted on chasing him down,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan soon regrouped with Qi Yang.

Qi Yang was an experienced Enforcer. He had done a great job at preventive measures. He immediately intercepted all the vehicles on the highway when Mo Fan decided to engage the enemy, limiting the casualties for this incident.

Zhao Manyan managed to save the passengers on the bus, too. The driver was still in a terrible state. It would take him a long time to recover.

Apart from the Summoning Element, the Shepherd also had the Psychic Element. His mental strength was very impressive. Most ordinary people would be trapped in a vegetative state after falling victim to him. It was a great relief that the driver was still able to recover.

“A person still died on the bus, but it’s the best we could do. You guys... not only did you lose the important person we were tailing, people are going to comment on how bad you guys were, causing such devastating damage to the highway and stirring up panic!” Qi Yang sighed.

“Who cares? There are too many idiots in this world. If we cared so much about what they thought, we would only wear ourselves out,” Zhao Manyan answered.

“Don’t worry, they won’t get away this time. I know where they are,” Mo Fan smiled. He slowly opened his palm. A little black fly-like fairy landed on it. “They have crossed the mountains and are heading for the city. How cunning are they, acting in contravention. They were planning to hide in the city all along...”

“They went back to the city?” Qi Yang was stunned.

He had already sent his men to search for them in the mountains after they disappeared, hoping to pick up their trail again. He was surprised to learn they had gone back to the city instead. If so, they would not find any clues, even if they searched in the mountains for days!
