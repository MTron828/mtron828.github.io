The lake in front of the apartment complex was starting to freeze. A woman

with hair as soft as silk was seated on a bench in front of the lake.

She stared at the lake for a long time, deep in thought. Her delicate figure

blended perfectly into the cold night.

After some time, she looked at one of the units in the apartment that still had

its lights on.

She hesitated for a moment, then rose to her feet. She walked away from the

school, across the frozen grass.

The cold sea breeze lashed the woman like a whip. Even the mink coat she was

wearing could not keep her warm.

“She’s here, Councilman Zhuang,” Dean Lee reported.

Zhuang Yue was standing upright with an expressionless face. His lips curled

upward when he saw the beautiful young woman approaching him.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Zhuang Yue reached out his hand in a friendly

manner. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The woman did not respond. She only stared at Dean Lee with cold, attractive

eyes.

“He’s Councilman Zhuang Yue, the person in charge of the operation,” Dean

Lee introduced him.

“I’m only doing this for the Pearl Institute,” the woman replied.

“That’s fine. The Pearl Institute represents the Magic City, which represents

the country, just like the soldiers who are fighting hard just to make sure their

families can live peacefully in the walls of the city,” Zhuang Yue replied.

“The Pearl institute will remember you. All of us will remember you!”

Mo Fan went to the balcony with messy hair after he woke up. He was trying to

clear his head with the cold wind.

It was almost evening. They had drank until dawn, celebrating how much of a

failure their lives were, then they had slept through the day.

It had been some time since the Magic City had any sunlight. The evening

remained dull, as if the mist in the sky would not disappear for another several

dozen years.

Mo Fan could see the artificial lake from his balcony. The surface that had

frozen at night would melt in the day.

Lanterns were floating on the lake like tiny rafts.

“Is there a festival today?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

He did not put much attention on the lanterns, since he was starving. He

quickly took a shower and headed downstairs. He had not eaten at the canteen

downstairs for a long time.

The canteen was very dark.

Mo Fan was confused when he walked into the canteen. Were Lightning

Element resources scarce, too? Why were they not willing to turn on the lights?

The canteen was also decorated with little lanterns. The dim light they were

giving off made the canteen look like a mourning hall.

Mo Fan felt uneasy. He happened to see a familiar man walking toward him.

The man’s face was visible, as he was also holding a lanterm. He was grieving!

“Zhang Zhuo!” Mo Fan called out to the man.

Mo Fan still had a slight impression of the man. He was the Shadow Mage who

had found the survivors hiding inside a bunker at Bing Town when he was

fighting the sea monsters that had invaded the river.

Zhang Zhuo was shocked when he saw Mo Fan. He almost dropped the lantern

in his hand.

“Senior Mo Fan!” Zhang Zhuo yelled.

“Shhh!” Mo Fan signaled him to lower his voice.

He pulled Zhang Zhuo to the side. He looked at the lantern in his hand and

asked, “What are you doing? Who are you mourning for?”

“Didn’t you hear what happened? Didn’t you see the news? The media has been

reporting the incident for the whole day!” Zhang Zhuo exclaimed woefully.

“I was cultivating in seclusion. I just came out,” Mo Fan replied without

blinking an eye.

Then... you should pretend you didn’t hear anything. Otherwise, you will be

saddened by it,” Zhang Zhuo said slowly.

Mo Fan was utterly confused. He looked at the words written on the lantern.

It was a short blessing for someone who had died. Mo Fan was dumbfounded

when he saw the name on it.

Ding Yumian!

The deceased was Ding Yumian!

The lake, the school, and many places were full of lanterns that had been made

to mourn Ding Yumian!

She had left this world!

“When did it happen?” Mo Fan asked grimly.

“Early this morning. Senior, I’m so depressed. She was such a young and

beautiful girl. I stumbled into her a month ago in the library. She told me her

greatest wish was to visit the renowned institutes across the world. She wanted

to see the cold and beautiful Alps Institute, the noble and royal institutes in

Europe, and the romantic and luxurious Aorus Sacred Institute... but she no

longer has a chance to fulfill her wish,” Zhang Zhuo sobbed.

“What happened? Did the sea monsters kill her?” Mo Fan demanded.

“No, no, Councilman Zhuang Yue announced it this morning...” Zhang Zhuo

shook his head.

Ding Yumian’s death was made public through an official announcement

Even if Ding Yumian was a Super Mage, her death would not be announced bya

Councilman, nor was it going to shock the Magic City and the whole country.

Mo Fan had a strong feeling it was something that would infuriate and sadden

him.

He took out his phone and browsed the news.

Zhang Zhuo did not dare say a word. He could feel Mo Fan’s breathing

intensifying.

“Did she make the decision herself?” Mo Fan asked after a prolonged silence.

“Yes, Dean Lee has her last words, which she wrote for the school. It was her

handwriting,” Zhang Zhuo answered.

Mo Fan took Zhang Zhuo’s phone and looked at the photo closely. It read: Even

though I can’t leave the Pearl Institute, I love it very much. Ihope my soul can

return here.

Ding Yumian was a known Disaster-bringer.

She had been protected by the Pearl Institute. She was not allowed to leave the

school because she might endanger other people.

Unfortunately, someone had found her. They had treated her Innate Talent as a

secret weapon to eliminate the sea monsters!

Mo Fan had the same idea briefly when he learned Ding Yumian’s Innate

Talent, but he did not expect it would really happen!

Ding Yumian’s mental strength was stronger than ordinary people’s. Her

negative emotions could influence the people around her.

The truth was, her emotions were able to influence every living creature with

intelligence!

She had found out that the sea monster’s minds were connected like a giant

net. That net covered most of the sea monsters who were invading their

country.

Ding Yumian was able to influence the sea monsters with her emotions. Thus,

she had become a secret weapon.

She had ended her own life on an unknown island in the middle of the sea.

Her strong urge to kill herself had spread throughout the army of sea monsters

that was preparing its next attack.

The sea monsters had ended up killing themselves.

Since that morning, the vast sea had been covered by the tloating dead bodies

of the sea monsters and their foul stench!
