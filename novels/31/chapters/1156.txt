The Demon-Horned Statue was quicker than the Bronze Beast. Mo Fan had already created some distance with Blink, but to his surprise, the demon statue was already sticking its evil face close to him while uttering a burst of cruel laughter that would make a person’s soul shiver!

“This time, I’m going to dig your chest out!” The demon statue swung its claws at lightning speed, aiming for Mo Fan’s chest. Its claws could easily rip Mo Fan’s ribs out of his body.

Mo Fan turned into a dark lightning ray. It flickered rapidly as Mo Fan backed towards the mountain wall.

As soon as he landed, the demon statue lunged at him once again. Mo Fan dodged the attack in the nick of time. The sturdy mountain wall behind him was smashed into pieces with a single swipe of the demon statue’s claw!

The rocks splintered. The demon statue was incredibly fast at recovering from its attack. It was already carrying out its second attack when the pieces of rocks were still splintering in the air, aiming for Mo Fan’s heart!

Mo Fan sank into the ground and quickly turned into a shadow bird, flying from the top of the stairs to the bottom.

“Is there anything else you can do apart from running away? You will never be able to see the girl at this rate. Such a pitiful girl, I already knew the tragic fate awaiting her when she walked past me the first day. Do you know what happens to those that are sentenced guilty? I have been here for thousands of years, and I have seen many great talents and gorgeous women beheaded. Their blood, their organs washed away by the rain and flowing down the stairs. Whenever it happens, I always have the same thought: that these so-called geniuses will never learn to bow their heads. They have no idea that there are some people they can never afford to offend. Even the slightest resistance would result in their horrible deaths!”

The Demon-Horned Statue did not chase after Mo Fan. It stood on the stairs arrogantly, as if it would consider going easy on Mo Fan if he decided not to enter its territory.

“Is that why you’ve forfeited your soul, so you can be a guard dog? Does it matter that you have lived for thousands of years? You will never be human again!” Mo Fan said mockingly.

A guard dog!

The words immediately lit the rage in the demon statue’s heart!

Mo Fan’s words were on point. The demon statue was once a human, it was the reason it could speak. It was placed under a curse by a Forbidden Mage, trapping it forever on the Parthenon Sacred Mountain. It was already tired of its life. The evil thoughts growing inside its bones were enough to cover the entire Citadel of Athens, yet it was sealed away like a statue.

It hated humans. It started to enjoy torturing them. Its only joy of living in this world was torturing intruders.

“Do you know that I dug out the guts of the last intruder and hung them on the old Flying Flower tree!?” the demon statue snapped furiously.

“A guard dog always barks the loudest,” Mo Fan replied indifferently.

The demon statue was about to explode with rage. It floated in the air like a phantom and split into lots of mirror images. Its claws poured down like rain, with nowhere to escape to.

“Lightning Tyrant Domain!” Mo Fan stomped the ground. A powerful aura of lightning spread out like a storm.

Clouds of rolling thunder appeared as black lightning dragons gathered above Mo Fan. They eventually turned into a thick lightning bolt, landing right on Mo Fan. The lightning arcs surged out wildly from his body, his aura as imposing as if he had just put on armor made of lightning!

The demon statue was struggling against Mo Fan’s enhanced lightning spells, the arcs still whipping at it. The strong paralyzing effect spread across its body, impairing its movement!

“Silent Deadly Bolt!” Lightning coils circled Mo Fan’s arms. As Mo Fan shoved his hands forward, they turned into lightning bolts, piercing right through the demon statue!

The demon statue had no chance of dodging the attack, especially since the Silent Deadly Bolt was one of the quickest attacks. The lightning beams left a hole on its chest, and also punctured its wings!

The demon statue uttered a piercing cry. Its chest and wings had scorched marks. Any other creature would have died after receiving the attack.

“Telekinesis!” Mo Fan did not give the demon statue any chance to escape. His hand emitted a silver light and grabbed at the arcs of lightning dancing wildly in the air.

The invisible hand grabbed the Demon-Horned Statue. Mo Fan strengthened his will and focused. He tightened his grip, trying to crush the demon statue.

The Demon-Horned Statue was stuck in the air. Its bones cracked under the pressure from Mo Fan’s invisible hand. It kept crying out in agony.

“Lightning Chain!”

Thousands of Lightning Strikes sprang out from Mo Fan’s hand and flowed right to the Demon-Horned Statue through the invisible hand.

Mo Fan’s powerful will was holding the Demon-Horned Statue in place. It was struck by the lightning before it could break free from the grab.

As the lightning surged across the invisible hand, it faintly outlined the limb in the air. It looked like a giant hand had grown out of Mo Fan’s arm, holding fast the enemy that the lightning strikes were landing on.

“Summoning Tide!”

A lunar-white Star Constellation started forming in front of Mo Fan. The brilliant Star Patterns combined into a sacred Star Constellation made up of three hundred and forty-three Stars, and opened up a gate to the other plane!

The howls of wolves burst out of the gap as a strong gust of wind blew a wall of thick dust out!

A huge white wolf stepped out from the gate. Each leg was as thick as a tree trunk. When its entire body stepped out from the gap, the mountain path suddenly felt crowded. Even the mountain walls were unable to conceal the enormous creature!

The white, enormous wolf locked its ferocious gaze on the demon statue and charged at it hungrily, trampling on the mountain path.

The Demon-Horned Statue quickly beat its wings, trying to escape from the ferocious wolf, but the paralyzing effect of the Lightning Strikes had slowed it down significantly.

Soon another enormous white wolf came out from the gap. It was not as huge as the one before, yet its speed was shocking. It actually caught up to the other wolf and leapt into the air, trying to pounce on the Demon-Horned Statue and slam it to the ground.

A third enormous white wolf came out from the gate. Its temper was even worse. Seeing that its comrades had taken down its prey, it immediately rushed forward to fight for a meal!

The fourth, fifth, and sixth wolves came out of the gate... Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Huge wolves kept on coming out from the gate. It felt like they were going to crush the entire mountain path. They all surrounded the Demon-Horned Statue, tearing at its flesh, its organs, and its bones!

Cries of agony echoed in the air. The Demon-Horned Statue was undying, but once it was destroyed, it would take a long time for it to recover. In addition to that, its death was a lot more painful than ordinary creatures. The wolves were splitting the remains of the demon statue between them. They were not after its flesh, but if they could absorb the energy it contained, it would still help them grow stronger!

“You...why do you have five Elements, there’s no way you are a Forbidden Mage!?” the demon statue’s voice echoed over the mountain, but as soon as it finished the sentence, the first wolf swallowed its brain. Mo Fan was struggling to understand what the statue was saying, as its voice was echoing out from inside the wolf’s stomach!

Seeing the enormous, white wolves that were as savage as a bunch of bandits, even Mo Fan was utterly astounded by the scene before him. It turned out that violence was most effective against the demon creatures. It did not matter how quick the demon statue was, or how sharp its claws were, the pack of wolves only needed to rush forward and tear it into pieces!

“How cruel...” Han Ji’s face was blank. It took him some time to utter the words.

“Yeah,” Pang Lai nodded.

Mo Fan was incredibly powerful. As expected of the strongest participant in the World College Tournament, he was extremely adept at switching between his five Elements, giving his enemy no chance to react at all. If all five of his Elements reached the limit of the Advanced Level, they wondered how many Advanced Mages would be needed to take him down!

“Being an Advanced Mage has its benefits. At least he can fight with his full strength on the Starry Mountain Path. Having a stronger cultivation means a stronger suppression. However, an Advanced Mage is going to be the weakest once he reaches the Mountain of the Goddess,” Old Bao said.

“Pang Lai, what’s next? Is it tricky to deal with?” Zhu Meng let out a relieved sigh after seeing that Mo Fan had taken out the second statue.

“I lost to the third statue in the past. It’s a vampire... it has been alive for at least two thousand years,” Pang Lai told them.

“A...a vampire, over two thousand years old...”

“Isn’t a vampire over a thousand years old as strong as a Ruler-level creature?” Zhu Meng asked immediately.

“Yeah, if the vampire was in the outside world, Han Ji, even you and Zhu Meng would have trouble facing it. Luckily its strength is also limited by the magic formation. It’s weaker than a Ruler-level creature, but I’m worried that Mo Fan is still going to struggle against it,” Pang Lai said.

“Is it that strong?”

“Even I failed to defeat it; what do you think?” Pang Lai said.

—

Mo Fan proceeded forward. He was planning to take out the third statue while his Summoning Tide was still active.

The third statue was a man. Apart from the coat and sharp fangs, the man was no different than a human.

He had already woken up, standing at the stairs he was guarding while looking at the wolves disdainfully.

“I hate wolves the most!” the vampire said casually.
