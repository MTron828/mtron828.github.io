The Space of Death was never meant to spare the lives of those inside it. There was simply no end to the silver vortexes. The third silver vortex was bigger than the two before; it looked like a silver gap was just torn apart in the sky!

One side of the gap was the Space of Death, the other side was outside the inner city!

As soon as the gate was opened, more undead fell from the sky. The bigger the gap, the higher the number of undead that fell into the space, including those the size of a building!

“Mo...Mo Fan?”

When Mo Fan was staring at the silver vortex, Liu Ru’s voice appeared from not far away.

However, even Liu Ru could not believe her eyes. Was this man with long silver hair and a body covered in demonic runes really the Mo Fan she knew?

“The exit is there,” Mo Fan did not have any expression. He pointed in a direction. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Oh... okay,” Liu Ru glanced into the distance and saw a silver door. However, between them was the silver vortex, from which countless undead were falling into this space.

“I’ll stop them, head for the exit,” said Demon Mo Fan.

“Stop them, how are you going to...” Demon Mo Fan had already disappeared from in front of Liu Ru’s eyes before she could finish her sentence.

Raising her head once again, she was shocked to see that Mo Fan was riding a wave of flames up toward the silver vortex in the sky!

It was only possible to determine the size of the silver vortex by comparison. The wave of flames that Mo Fan produced was already a few tens of meters wide, and yet when he approached the silver vortex, the flames were only a tiny little red dot.

“Let’s go!” Su Xiaoluo reminded Liu Ru.

“Mmm!” Liu Ru nodded.

Liu Ru had fought her way back while the Blood Skeleton Official was approaching Mo Fan. The direction they had headed into turned out to be a dead end. However, when she made it back, Mo Fan was already covered by the ocean of skeletons.

However, not long after, Liu Ru had witnessed an unbelievable scene.

For some reason, when Mo Fan transformed into his demon form, Liu Ru’s blood began to boil as if it was responding to some call.

“Could this be the reason why my strength greatly surpasses others from the Blood Tribe?” Liu Ru glanced backward while she was running.

She had become a Blood Tribe member after drinking Mo Fan’s blood.

Instead of being as weak as the usual rookies in the Blood Tribe, she ended up with a potential that was even greater than those possessed by the seniors in the Blood Tribe. Was it because of the demon blood that was flowing in Mo Fan’s body?

If so, instead of referring to Mo Fan as her senior, this Demon Mo Fan was her true master!

A rumble came from the sky. A stunning, blazing light burst out from Mo Fan, almost covering the width of the silver vortex. The zombies, phantoms, and skeletons falling from the sky were set aflame, as if they had fallen into a burning ocean.

The burning corpses spread across the sky. They had pretty much turned into ash before they landed on the ground. When Liu Ru, Su Xiaoluo, and Swift Star Wolf were passing through the land covered in ash, they did not see a single undead moving!

They soon arrived in front of the silver mirror. Liu Ru was going to ask Mo Fan to leave with them when she discovered the mirror shaking vigorously. The surface of the mirror was twisting.

“I’ll find another exit!” Mo Fan transmitted his voice into Liu Ru’s heart, as if he could read her mind.

Liu Ru knew they were simply Mo Fan’s burdens if they stayed any longer. Their priority now was to leave the Space of Death and find their way to the altar... Otherwise, everything they had done until now would be in vain.

She did not hesitate any longer. She dashed into the silver mirror together with Su Xiaoluo and the unconscious Zhang Xiaohou.

The undead army in the silver vortex was massive. It looked like a fog from afar, but each of the dust particles was an undead creature. The size of the army could simply destroy the space by trampling it.

Mo Fan could not leave with the others. He had sensed that the silver vortex was not only teleporting more undead into the space, it was also producing a strong turbulent flow of space to destroy the Space of Death!

It was meaningless to kill more undead if the Space of Death was about to collapse. The third silver vortex was bringing destruction upon the place, including the bridge leading to the altar...

If Mo Fan left with the others, the bridge that would lead them to the space where the altar was would collapse together with the Space of Death. They would never make it to the Blood Emperor Throne!

It was difficult to stop the destruction of the silver vortex, but he could ease the burden of the space by eliminating the undead. Mo Fan had to wipe out the army of undead. He would have to kill every single undead that the vortex had teleported to the space until Liu Ru and the others left the Space of Death through the bridge...

The undead were falling from the sky like a storm. The flames were no longer strong enough to burn all the undead into ash instantly.

Mo Fan returned to the ground, but he soon propelled himself into the sky once again. This time, there were not just flames, there was lightning flickering around him, too.

The wild lightning formed a web of lightning bolts that seemed to have their own consciousness. Whenever an undead fell from the sky, they would swiftly pierce through its body...

The undead was either turned into fine powder or burned ash!

It was unclear how many undead were killed after being drawn in by the silver vortex. Even those that survived could not last more than a few minutes.

The endless lightning and fire were so strong that the gravitational force was completely twisted. The powder and ash were no longer falling downward, but were rising due to the heat energy from Mo Fan’s fiery waves.

The space full of lightning and fire that Demon Mo Fan had constructed left the group of authorities surrounding the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror in silence.

As Du Xiao mentioned, the power of the Demon Element had exceeded their imagination!

The undead army was made up of over ten thousand undead, yet they were annihilated while they were still falling from the sky!

Was the man really the same person that had just broken through to the Advanced Level?

“President, President!” one of the Imperial Magicians came in yelling at the top of his lungs.

The group was still overwhelmed by the astonishment at witnessing the Demon Element. They even filtered out the Imperial Magician’s voice.

“What...what’s wrong?” It took President Han Ji some time to react.

“God bless the Ancient Capital, a silver vortex has appeared close to the Mountain Zombie. It seems like the Mountain Zombie is being dragged into it!” shouted the Imperial Magician excitedly.

“What did you just say?” screamed Han Ji.

The group immediately collected their thoughts and glanced outside the city.

The sky had started to light up. The Mountain Zombie outside the golden barrier was obviously shorter. After taking a closer look... it turned out that its feet and calves had already been sucked into the enormous silver vortex!

Zhu Meng immediately shifted his attention back to the Wicked Eye Copper Mirror. When he saw a pair of enormous feet dangling from the silver vortex, his face turned extremely pale!
