“Isn’t it over yet?” Commander Lu Xu landed on the tower. His eyes were completely bloodshot.

His right arm was missing. Fresh blood from the cut stained the white cloth wrapping around it. He was supposed to wear a twisted smile, yet the smile he hid under his skinny face was gone, replaced by the terror and disbelief of finding that he had not woken up from the nightmare!

Chief Military Instructor Fei Jiao, Senior Hunter Du Xiao, Commander Lu Xu and Councilman Zhu Meng, four Super Magicians were looking at the land lit up by the sunlight, at the undead that were still perfectly fine in the light, while more of them violated their common sense as they burst out from the ground, acting as if the dark, bloody feast had just begun...

A cry like death knell came from the direction of the northern walls. The four’s gaze passed through the drizzle and saw a giant creature with large skeletal wings flying towards them from up close to the clouds...

Its grew bigger as it approached the walls. Its size was comparable to the tower on the northern walls. When its wings were fully extended, they produced a huge shadow, looming over a place like a cloud!

People had no idea what it was, but when its eyes glanced at the tiny walls and humans in the city, terror began to spread rapidly like a plague, instantly covering half of the City North!

Mo Fan looked up in astonishment. The bone-winged creature’s body looked like it was molded from mercury, clearly visible even when the creature was still miles away. It felt like even the smallest bone with a pointy end could easily puncture every Magician on the walls!

“Nether Bone Ruler!” Commander Lu Xu finally uttered slowly after some time.

Even as a Super Magician, he still felt a chill running down his spine when he mentioned the name, let alone seeing the scariest ruler of the undead known with his own eyes!

The Phantom Tyrant Emperor was a phantom, the ruler of the phantoms. Whenever it appeared, it would have lots of phantoms surrounding it!

The Nether Bone Ruler was a skeleton, a ruler of the skeletons!

It was a super undead even more infamous than the Phantom Tyrant Emperor!

Why...why did it wake up in the daytime? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With a roar like a death knell, the Nether Bone Ruler came to a stop a few kilometers away from the walls, floating in the air. The primary head out of its three was raised up high. Through the gaps between the bones around its throat, people could see black energy flickering inside its mouth!

The sharp glow turned into a blast wave. The black death ray shot forward with a howl.

Space began to tremble. The death ray traveled perfectly straight through the rain and the area outside of the walls. In just a few seconds, the blast wave struck the wall a kilometer to the left of the tower!

Darkness spread on its surface and devoured the sunlight.

The northern walls turned dark gray where the death ray made contact with them, and in the next second, the sturdy rocks were entirely devoured by the darkness!

It was a sound so loud that everything simply turned deadly quiet. Mo Fan was overwhelmed by the silence, yet his eardrums were on the verge of bursting from the vibrations...

The death ray had taken away everyone’s sight. They only knew that the giant walls were eaten away by something right before the darkness blinded them.

The darkness did not last for long. When the light finally returned, the people on the tower reacted as if their souls were destroyed. With blank faces, they simply could not believe what they were seeing...

The walls had disappeared!

A huge section of the walls that was previously standing there like a mountain range had disappeared. Tiny particles like dust slowly rose into the air, like wisps of floating steam. The truth was, the walls did not just disappear, but they were turned into the tiny particles that were so light that they simply drifted into the air as the wind blew!

“Ass...asshole!” In the tower, a line of tears ran down the cheeks of a man who was covered in dust.

“I’m going to kill it, I’m going to f**king kill it!” he ran out like he had gone mad, screaming in a hoarse voice.

When Mo Fan saw the man was seriously charging out of the tower, he immediately appeared beside the man with Fleeing Shadow and grabbed onto him tightly.

“Are you trying to kill yourself! You’re just a cockroach that can be killed with a single stomp by it!” snapped Mo Fan.

“Don’t you f**king worry about me, let go!” yelled Shorty.

Mo Fan was clearly aware that Shorty was just going to get himself killed going down the tower. He cast Giant Shadow Spike and restrained him close to the railing on the walls so the man would not do anything stupid.

Shorty was still struggling. He even tried to overcome Mo Fan’s Giant Shadow Spike with his will, yet Mo Fan’s Giant Shadow Spike was not something that could be easily overpowered, at least not when Shorty was not using any effective methods.

“Let go of me, I’m begging you, let me go...” yelled Shorty at the top of his voice.

Mo Fan stood there and remained silent.

Maybe Shorty did not mention anything, yet Mo Fan could easily tell from his extreme sorrow that there was a hospital close to the part of the walls that was destroyed...

The death ray did not just destroy the wall. It also bulldozed the section from the wall to the hospital, like an enormous beast trampling across the place mercilessly!

The wall had disappeared. The street had vanished, including the hospital, and Shorty’s wife who was in labor...

“Mo Fan, I’m begging you, let go of me...if you still think me as your friend,” pleaded Shorty sorrowfully in tears, as he knew he could not break free from Mo Fan’s spell.

“I never thought of you as a friend, either.” Mo Fan would not withdraw the Giant Shadow Spike.

Even Zhu Meng, Du Xiao, Lu Xu, or Fei Jiao had no chance of stopping the death ray. Shorty would only add himself to the list of casualties. Perhaps adding one more death to the street that had now turned into dust would make no difference, but there were many things that an Intermediate Magician could still do...

It was no longer a nightmare, but a real disaster, just like what had happened to Bo City. Back then, any Intermediate Magician was extremely important. Although an Intermediate Magician could not turn the tables, they could still save a few lives!

An eerie purple glow arose slowly. It gradually loomed over the northern part of the city. Girls with special taste seemed to favor purple, thinking that the sight of a whole area covered in purple would be dazzling... But, they would have to think twice about what they wished for, as the purple currently looming over the area was just a pleasing illusion right before death arrived. It would simply be their last desire in the world, before all hopes were lost.

“Purple... a purple alert...”

Mo Fan glanced into the distance. He could only see the buildings and streets in a square layout beyond, the area covered in the nightmarish purple.
