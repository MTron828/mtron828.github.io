Ding Yumian was rather impressed by Mo Fan...

As a student of Pearl Institute, he had spent almost two years here, either in the outer campus or the main campus, but he had still managed to get lost!

Most importantly, the participants of the Nomination Preliminaries would take a shower and offer some incense sticks ahead of time to prepare for the duels, but Mo Fan did not even know he had a match today! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When she led the guy with a poor sense of direction to the dueling ground, the match had almost come to an end.

“Your team is fighting the duel with only three people. They must have a huge grudge against you now,” Ding Yumian entered the stadium with Mo Fan.

However, as Ding Yumian glanced at the dueling ground, she was left speechless instantly.

Four people!

There were four people on the dueling ground, not one was missing!

However, Mo Fan was standing right beside her. Who was the person replacing him in the battle?

Mo Fan’s face had fallen dark. He could feel millions of copies of the word ‘f**k’ galloping through his heart.

“Did she impersonate you to participate in the battle?” Ding Yumian found herself a comfortable seat. She seemed fairly intrigued. Her charming eyes were gleaming, as she waited to see how the situation would develop.

Mo Fan’s expression could not turn any worse, but the match was still ongoing. He could not simply jump into the battle and drag Ai Tutu out of it to smack her ass. He could only watch the battle miserably, hoping that Ai Tutu would not mess it up too much.

As he thought, nothing good came out of it when he asked the woman to help him with something. He had underestimated the size of the hole in her brain. God must have knocked over the cup containing wisdom when He was creating her, and gave her large breasts to compensate her for her loss...

“They are in a pinch,” Ding Yumian calmly commented as she watched the battle.

“Mm, it’s very obvious,” Mo Fan nodded.

——

On the dueling ground, Gu Jian’s expression was extremely gloomy. He was seriously suspecting the girl called Mo Fan had simply come here to act cute!

Was the Plant Element seriously her primary Element? She pretty much had zero accuracy when using the Magic Vine. Their opponents could easily dodge her spell without relying on Wind Track or Earth Wave.

“Brilliant Light: Blind!”

Ai Tutu was aware that she was unable to use her Plant Element effectively, hence she stopped relying on it. When she saw Gu Jian was trapped between enemies, she immediately thought of using the Light Spell to blind the enemy, allowing Gu Jian to escape.

However, the Brilliant Light: Blind was unable to distinguish friend from foe. Not only would it blind the enemy, it would also blind her allies, too. It required the Light Magician to have good control of the distance and angle to work as they intended...

Gu Jian’s wrist was glowing with a Lightning Strike. He was planning to paralyze one of his opponents with the Spell, and use his Boots Equipment to escape from their flanking him. To his shock, Ai Tutu’s Brilliant Light suddenly blinded him. He totally lost sight of his target.

While Gu Jian was blinded, a thick ice chain slapped him fiercely. His eyes were still burning in pain, so there was no chance for him to dodge the attack. The chain struck his abdomen with great force and sent him flying...

He was wearing magic armor, which was also his last line of defense.

After Gu Jian was injured, their team no longer had enough firepower. They were defeated rather quickly.

The outcome was decided. They had lost the battle again.

“Team sixteen, win!”

Following the declaration by the referee, the students from team sixteen immediately burst out in smiles.

Their captain Bai Yulang burst out laughing, as if he were mocking Gu Jian. He kept on making some weird noises.

Gu Jian did not get along well with Bai Yulang. The defeat totally detonated the fury in his chest.

“Are you out of your mind!? Didn’t you know that the Brilliant Light would blind me too?”

“Did you make it to the top twenty by climbing into your opponents’ bed?”

“Dumb like pig, I don’t want to see you again!”

Gu Jian pointed at Ai Tutu and vented his anger through a torrent of curses. He could not care less after he was overwhelmed by anger.

He had lost two of the three most important matches in the Nomination Preliminaries. He was getting further away from securing the nomination, and it was all thanks to this dumb woman!

The first loss, he put up with. The second loss, he could not bear it any longer, even when the crowd was looking and the person he was scolding was a girl!

Annoying, so damn annoying!

Gu Jian’s voice was echoing throughout the dueling ground as he fully expressed the thoughts in his mind.

The place was not too crowded, yet everyone clearly heard what he said.

His teammates, Li Jie and Liu Xing were stunned. They were feeling angry too, yet they would not scold the girl straightaway, right in front of the crowd.

The truth was, the girl did perform better in the second battle. The Brilliant Light in the end was only because Gu Jian was in a pinch...

The whole place fell deadly quiet at Gu Jian’s sudden roar.

Soon, the sound of crying broke the silence.

Ai Tutu was stunned for a few seconds, before she buried her face in her hands and burst into tears.

Gu Jian’s words were extremely unpleasant to the ears, basically stabbing her right in the heart. Even Ai Tutu, who was always fooling around, completely broke down in front of the crowd.

She knew that she was treating it as something fun to do when she decided to impersonate their teammate.

However, when she saw their depressed expressions after losing the first battle, she no longer treated it as a joke. She was very serious in the second battle, and even had her family spend a fortune to prepare a Deathstrike Magic Equipment for her.

The Deathstrike Magic Equipment did come in handy, but their opponents were stronger than the team in the last match. Their team’s overall strength was weaker.

As they lost the battle, she initially thought Gu Jian would try and comfort her since her performance today was a lot better, yet to her surprise, all she got was a scolding. As the sound pierced through her heart, tears burst out from her eyes.

“What the hell are you crying for? Piss off! Don’t let me see you again!” snapped Gu Jian.

He had already assumed the girl would be a burden when he first saw her. He never thought she would be even more useless than he had thought.

“Gu Jian...forget it...”

“Yeah, we still have the third match coming up. She was just trying to help you out,” advised Li Jie.

“What’s the point of fighting the third match when this woman is on our team!?” Gu Jian was still consumed by anger.

Ai Tutu could no longer picture that the man condemning her so loudly was someone that her family was fond of. Her only thought now was to leave the place.

Holding her face, Ai Tutu ran toward the exit in disappointment and bumped into someone’s chest...

The chest was not wide, yet it felt very sturdy. She was about to walk around when the person spread his arms and hugged her.

Ai Tutu raised her head and realized that the person was Mo Fan.

She felt like she was being electrocuted...

When she recalled how Mo Fan had witnessed the scolding and her foolish act of impersonating him, she suddenly felt too ashamed to show her face.

Gu Jian was just someone that her family was fond of. She could simply ignore him by hardening her heart, but Mo Fan was her friend, her housemate, and she was scared that Mo Fan would scold her, too...

After all, because of her, he had now lost two important battles!
