Chapter 3140 - 3140: Shadow Element Forbidden Curse

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Meanwhile, after Asha’ruiya obtained the power of the Dragon Sparrow, she displayed astonishing fighting prowess.

The Breath of the Dragon Sparrow was quite a good mix for her energy, which allowed Asha’ruiya to evolve into an even higher-being than a Six-Winged Fallen Angel. She was like an Archangel that descended from heaven!

Lilith was part of the Blood Tribe, and she had a pair of black wings that resembled twigs on her back. There were also strange and charming feathers that looked like flowers. Whenever she flapped her wings, they would release an enticing scent.

When Asha’ruiya smelled the intoxicating scent, she knew that it would be fatal for her if it entered her lungs. It was a poison that would cause all her organs to rot.

She used the ability she had gained at the Parthenon Temple to bless herself so that she would be enveloped in a thin, milky-white light. The poison from the fragrance floated like black butterflies as it tried to search for a crack in Asha’ruiya’s defenses Soon, however, these black, poisonous butterflies were purified by her blessing.

“You’re a Fallen Angel skilled in White Magic? Your twisted origin is very similar to a king’s,” Lilith said. “But I hate people who pretend to be saints the most. I’ll let you know just who the real ruler of darkness is and who exactly is the servant who can never overthrow her master!”

Lilith showed that she was a completely villainous Fallen Queen. A large number of black, poisonous butterflies appeared on her before they turned into a wicked butterfly that resembled a python.

The butterfly-python gave off an indescribable sense of evil and terror. It opened its mouth and released a breath that could make a person’s body and soul rot. Its breath even hurt some of the Einherjar Spirits who were still fighting. They shriveled up rapidly and lost their vitality.

Asha’ruiya flew around in circles in the air, like a divine bird. The ceremonial sword in her hands suddenly burned and released a light similar to the rising sun.

As the Dragon Sparrow howled, Asha’ruiya moved as if she was dancing to a waltz. At the same time, she appeared cold but charming.

Whoosh!

Her movements were as graceful as a dance on the moon, and there was an air of elegance as she swung her sword.

The light even tore through the clouds and shone brightly in the sky like the sun.

The “sun” and moon overlapped each other and turned into an eclipse. “Sun Eclipse Slash!” Asha’ruiya said coldly. After the light from her sword overlapped with the light of the moon, it created the image of a tree burning with the sun and moon’s light. On it were flowers of death created from her slashes.

The butterfly-python, which Lilith had created, suddenly moved as if it was about to dissipate like a mirage.

In the next instant, the countless black butterflies were reduced to ashes and smoke. Lilith’s powerful armor was also destroyed by the slash.

Following his victory over his final opponent, MO Fan wanted to help Asha’ruiya. After all, she had been fighting Lilith for a long time.

However, due to her competitive nature, Asha’ruiya did not ask MO Fan for help. She displayed astonishing power and suppressed Lilith, who no longer had any puppets to control.

Lilith fell limp to the ground. Her clothes were in tatters, and a dense layer of thin wounds covered her fair skin.

Her eyes burned with rage. Then, she threw her head up in indignation and said, “Even if I die, I won’t stay here and become your servant!”

“I don’t intend to keep someone as troublesome as you either. I’ll send you away,” MO Fan said.

Someone like Lilith was only going to be trouble if he allowed her to stay in his territory. It would also be difficult to reduce her to ashes. Considering her level, he would only be able to seal her, at most.

“Hmph!” Lilith snorted.

She knew that she had lost.

All the Einherjar Spirits she had working for the Bright Blood King ended up becoming MO Fan’s friends. They were trained well, but MO Fan was the one who ended up benefitting from the situation. With help from such a powerful army of Einherjar Spirits in the world, this newcomer would reach an even higher divine state.

“That’s the end of the show. It’s time for the curtain call!” MO Fan shouted. The statues at the Four Spirits Killing Fields finally quietened down and chose the substitutes they wanted.

Regardless of whether the Einherjar Spirits had submitted to MO Fan on their own or were beaten into submission, they all had to live under MO Fan’s roof. That way, the new world could expand, and they could also provide an endless supply of energy to their master.

MO Fan still had room to grow since only his Fire Element and Demon Element had been promoted to Forbidden Curses.

Even though he could master all elements and increase their power to the level of Forbidden Curses when he activated the Demon Element, MO Fan’s other elements still determined the Demon Element’s limit.

The stronger the other elements were, the stronger their power would be when he used the Demon Element.

“Do your jobs properly. If you don’t, I’ll have other Einherjar Spirits take your place.”

There were plenty of souls floating around the large Nether Ocean, and they There were plenty of souls floating around the large Nether Ocean, and they

were all strong. They did not have the right to enter the Four Spirits Killing

Fields, but that did not mean that they did not long to have their own statues in Mo Fan’s world.

If these Einherjar Spirits did not submit to him, they would be crushed by the other Einherjar Spirits and become stars that would be used to make him stronger. After all, he had plenty of other Einherjar Spirits in his path to become stronger.

MO Fan left his vessel and returned to his original body.

The thin ice under his feet continued to reflect the world within the vessel. He could see that under the Azure Dragon’s divine power, the Einherjar Spirits started to make themselves useful in the base. They searched for fragmented souls in the vast ocean of souls so that they could mold them.

As for MO Fan, he immediately sensed an endless pool of energy being created.

The Little Loach Pendant was just a small workshop to create souls. It refined souls and turned them into energy that MO Fan could absorb.

Since the Azure Dragon had awakened, the place began turning into a giant processing plant. Not only could it turn souls into energy that MO Fan needed at a high frequency, it could even streamline the process.

That way, MO Fan did not need to worry about not making full use of everything within the vessel. As long as he had enough raw materials, it would be easy for him to upgrade a few other elements into Forbidden Curses.

“Thank you for your gift. You’ve given me more confidence to walk down the road ahead.” MO Fan bowed to the Bright Blood King.

The Bright Blood King stood still like a bloody statue. She did not seem happy or upset.

She bowed back and said nothing. She just waved her hand in dismissal to show that her test was over. MO Fan could leave her territory with his chest out.

MO Fan nodded.

In any case, negotiations were done. He knew who to find for the follow-up later.

The Bright Blood King had her own spokesperson on Earth.

All MO Fan needed to do was find that person after he returned to Earth.

MO Fan held Asha’ruiya’s hand as they left the Bright Blood King’s territory, and he began to wipe off his sweat.

He might have been calling the Bright Blood King “Brighty” and acting friendly with her, but MO Fan was actually trembling in his boots.

The Bright Blood King was not someone MO Fan could defeat even if he used the Demon Element. If the Bright Blood King had been filled with animosity, his trip on the Dark Plane might have ended at the foot of her throne.

Fortunately, they passed the Bright Blood King’s test.

By the looks of it, she was quite pleased with Mo Fan’s performance and found him worthy enough to talk business with her.

As the future Evil Saint King and someone who was going to have his own seat among the thrones on the Dark Plane, MO Fan had to be acknowledged by the Bright Blood King. If he was not, he was going to run into a lot of trouble in the future.

“Did you evolve?” MO Fan stared at Asha’ruiya and noticed a unique spirit energy encircling her.

“Yeah. The Dragon Sparrow and I are a good match.” Asha’ruiya nodded. “I’ll visit your country if I have a chance and search for stories regarding the Dragon Sparrow in the holy land to the East.”

“That’s a great idea. Remember to have me serve as your guide then. It’ll be just like how we first met each other at the suburbs of the Ancient Capital, Ye Cuihua,” MO Fan said.

“My Chinese name is Ye Meng!”

Asha’ruiya had become stronger. This chance encounter had allowed her to gain a lot of benefits.

However, MO Fan was still the one to reap the greatest harvest.

As the Einherjar Spirits worked day and night, they squeezed out soul nectar from the large number of soul flowers from the Bright Blood King. MO Fan did not even need to make any allocations. They charged into his Dark Shadow

Domain to turn the Dark Shadow Nebula into a brilliant and huge mountain of Dark Shadow Stars!

The mountain was mysterious, as well as elusive, and there were a myriad of small worlds within it. An endless amount of dark energy shot into MO Fan’s large meditation world and even reached his other domains. This allowed the Lightning, Fire, Earth, Dimension, and Space Domains to also be enveloped in the mysterious shadow layer.

The layer seemed to cause a change in the Star Sons. Their structures were no longer as rigid. Instead, some dark branches rose from them, and they could produce even stronger and even more unique abilities!

“Are they upgrading and transforming all of my Elements?

“Is the upgrading of the Shadow Element some sort of giant fusion and evolution?

“What’s the Forbidden Curse of the Shadow Element then?”

Such a major change had occurred because MO Fan’s Shadow Element had indeed been upgraded to the level of a Forbidden Curse!

There was a Shadow Element mountain that seemed to stand tall within a large universe. It was quiet and eternal. Apart from transferring spirit energy to MO Fan, it was also modifying and strengthening his other elements nonstop.

MO Fan did not know whether another person’s Shadow Element Forbidden Curse would bring about such a transformation. But his instincts told him that this was connected to the Fusion Magic he had learned over the past few years.

The magic education of the current era followed a fixed structure. You could only release a certain degree of power at a certain level, and you could only awaken to certain magic elements at certain levels. The spells each mage could cast were also built based on a basic model of those spells. Even though this seemed like the perfect way to teach magic, it was not the best.

There were endless ways to pursue the path of magic. MO Fan also realized that once he entered the realm of Forbidden Curses, he started shaking the foundation of magic education.

He believed that the current foundation was something the geniuses of the past had built bit by bit, so what could he bring to the world of magic?

At the moment, MO Fan did not know.

The only thing he could do was to continue pursuing more secrets and deeper levels of magic.

Perhaps after a long time, the magic civilization would truly flourish. Then, some students would read about a person called MO Fan and how he opened up a path full of possibilities from the rigid era of magic. After he did it, he brought a new era.

For example, why were mages only allowed to awaken to one Element at the start?

Was it possible for all mages to cast more than seven Elements right from the beginning if they were willing to learn?

“You’ve become stronger. You have Forbidden Curses of three elements now?” Asha’ruiya keenly noticed the change in MO Fan.

MO Fan was shrouded in a mysterious layer. Since Asha’ruiya also had the Shadow Element, she could sense that his Shadow Element had become even harder to read.

One should know that Asha’ruiya was a Parade Angel, so she was granted the exception to obtain the Shadow Element’s Forbidden Curse. Meanwhile, not only did MO Fan have an incredibly strong Fire Element Forbidden Curse, he also had another Element reach the level of a Forbidden Curse.

Even if he did not use the Demon Element, MO Fan was already so strong that no one could stand against him. Very few humans knew Forbidden Curses from both the Fire Element and Shadow Element!

“Yes. The Shadow Element’s Forbidden Curse is even more… How should I put this? It’s not as grand as the Fire Element, but I feel like it’s a deep, bottomless swamp that shouldn’t be underestimated,” MO Fan shared his thoughts.

“What I sense from mine is different from yours,” Asha’ruiya said.

Even if two people upgraded the same element to a Forbidden Curse, they would have different experiences. Hence, Forbidden Curse Mages could not share their experiences with each other. After all, the enlightenment they gained in their path of magic was solely their own. These paths were not interconnected even if they belonged to the same element.

“Tell me about yours,” MO Fan requested.

“It’s a bit tyrannical, like a king who rules with an iron fist. There’re plenty of times where I feel like I can’t quite control it,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Oh! Then mine is like your average big sister who lives with you. It’s very reserved but contains a charm and wisdom that you shouldn’t ignore. It won’t tell me what to do and won’t ask me to do anything. It will only provide guidance and help me quietly. It won’t parade itself in front of me but is everywhere in my life.” MO Fan gave this as an example.

“That’s good. That means it’s something you yearn for and are looking for. It’s within your control, and you can get closer to it whenever you want.” Asha’ruiya nodded.

“Yes. It’s like you, aside from the part about controlling you.” MO Fan smiled.

Asha’ruiya was stunned. She was not expecting him to compare his Shadow Element Forbidden Curse to her.

While she was surprised, she also found what he said to be really corny.

Nevertheless, it did not sound bad to her ears.

“The Galaxy of the Yin Energy God is right ahead. Powerful creatures rest there. Promise me you won’t cause any trouble this time, okay?” Asha’ruiya changed the subject and spoke about the road ahead.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What’s the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God?” MO Fan asked in bewilderment.

“You’ll know once you’re there. No words can compare to the shock you’ll feel once you see the real deal!” Asha’ruiya said.

“Is it far away?” MO Fan asked.

“We need to get over these dark, barren mountains,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Okay. Are the mountain roads long?”

“If you don’t know the trick to cross them, you’ll be lost in them forever,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Then, thank goodness you’re here, Ye Cuihua.” MO Fan nodded.

Asha’ruiya finally stomped on MO Fan’s foot.

He called her “old friend”, “grown-up toddler”, “a big sister”, and “Ye Cuihua”!

Just who did he think she was?!
