2982 Down Without A Fight

Mo Fan stared at Shalitha.

Mo Fan could feel Shalitha’s Archangel-like confidence even though he remained expressionless.

Shalitha had strategized everything. It was as if everything was under his control.

He had been hiding atop the Sacrificial Mountain as a monk on duty. He must have been aware of the Red Demon’s strategy. He had even seen the Red Demon saturate the Sacrificial Mountain with tremendous evil energy…

When the Red Demon Kazuaki gave its Righteous Soul to make Mo Fan the new Wicked God, Shalitha was always there. Shalitha remained idly by and observed everything that occurred.

What Shalitha did was no different from creating a demon—an emperor-level Wicked God.

Even so, he did nothing about it.

Mo Fan suspected the Red Demon Kazuaki had known about the Archangel Shalitha’s presence. It knew Mo Fan would be deemed as “crossing the boundary” the moment he became the Wicked God, and that the Archangel would kill him. Hence, it had decided to work together with Mo Fan.

The Red Demon allowed Mo Fan to take over the Wicked God position for him to become the most powerful Red Demon, so that he could fight against the Archangel Shalitha.

But the Archangel was very ruthless. When Shalitha fought, he was even more cruel than the Red Demon.

Shalitha destroyed everything. He wanted to wipe out the Twin Guardian Towers from the world once and for all. After that, he would put all the blame on Mo Fan. Shalitha would then honor the Holy City in the name of an angel and take Mo Fan back in chains.

People in the Holy City had long arranged a “seat” for Mo Fan. They waited for a powerful and brave angel to hold Mo Fan down on the “seat” that was meant for the most terrifying heretic and demon!

“Aren’t you afraid of getting into trouble by playing with fire?” asked Mo Fan.

Shalitha had contributed to Mo Fan’s ascension to become the Wicked God.

It was not because Shalitha was crazy, but he was too arrogant. He was very confident in his ability to control everything. He held strong to his belief that he must destroy everything that “crossed the boundary”. But he was patient enough to wait for the people to “cross the boundary” instead of killing them when they were still weak and young.

“Even though you’ve become a Wicked God, you’re still no more than a baby to me,” answered Shalitha calmly.

The truth was, Shalitha did not intend to play with fire.

There was a certain order for everything in this world. To put it clearly, the world’s order could be compared to a leaky water pipe.

The moment the water pipe began to drip, most people would assume it was still fine and use it after getting it repaired. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, they would notice the water begin to eat through the repairs and overflow from the pipe. They would still believe that the leaky portion of the water pipe just needed to be tightened.

The entire water pipe would explode and cover the place with water in a matter of time before they could do anything about it.

From Shalitha’s point of view, he would change the water pipe the moment it begins to drip because the quality of the water pipe was inferior and failed to support the water pressure.

Shalitha saw things differently. He knew the water flow was strong and that the water pipe was of poor quality. Thus, he knew all this would eventually lead to an explosion and a mess. However, not everyone agreed with the same theory. They assumed that repair alone could solve the water pipe from leaking. For convenience, others would just repair the pipe or adjust the water pressure.

Mo Fan was like a strong water flow. Meanwhile, the country, the Magic Association, the Mages Institutions, and other social organizations were like the poor-quality water pipes. They thought Mo Fan’s didn’t pose a threat like the leak from the water pipe.

But Shalitha viewed him differently. He believed Mo Fan would break through the society’s bondage sooner or later. Even without the Red Demon Kazuaki’s sacrificial ritual, Mo Fan would dabble into the realm of the Forbidden Curse in a couple of years.

Instead of allowing Mo Fan to grow stronger, like a water pipe that was going to burst at any time, Shalitha did not mind fueling the flames.

Shalitha wanted to make Mo Fan “explode”. He wanted it to be known to the world that Mo Fan was an out-of-control heretic.

The blame of the Red Demon’s sins would obviously be shifted to Mo Fan, as well.

Shalitha could tell the world that Mo Fan was the man behind the Red Demon gang. Mo Fan had, after all, become the Wicked God and he was a beneficiary of the evil energy.

Shalitha did not need evidence or the truth. All he needed was a direction.

The Holy City also needed an excuse.

“On two conditions,” said Mo Fan to Shalitha.

Shalitha did not understand what Mo Fan meant.

“First, spare the Twin Guardian Towers,” said Mo Fan to Shalitha.

“Two, withdraw the wanted notice for Mu Ningxue. My beloved has suffered far too much in the Extreme South Land. I hope she can return home.”

Shalitha descended to the ground. His glowing feathered shield made him look holy and proud, like a deity from heaven.

“Are you pleading guilty?” Shalitha asked in surprise.

“Of course not. Why would I plead guilty? I didn’t commit any crime in the first place, but I can go to the Holy City with you to face the judgment anyway,” said Mo Fan.

“Hah…” Shalitha was not happy with his answer.

“It’s my duty and mission as the Heavenly Cloud and Winged Shadow. I will give up my hostility and my incredible destructive power. I will give up the meaningless killing and face the Holy City’s fair judgment!” Mo Fan blurted out the words.

“That’s the language of the Holy City! Who taught you that?!” Shalitha cried out furiously.

“Don’t I deserve to be judged?” refuted Mo Fan.

“You don’t deserve that. You should fight back! You should…” Shalitha flew into a fit of rage. This was not the outcome he expected!

He wanted Mo Fan to fight him back. He wanted Mo Fan to be angry. He wanted Mo Fan to become mad and make an enemy with the Archangel as well as the Holy City.

Shalitha was only able to swiftly execute him with the charge of heresy if he fought back at that point. But Mo Fan was willing to face the judgment.

Mo Fan had spoken in the Holy City’s language. It was the Holy City oath.

For those who had been viewed as heretics, as long as they gave up fighting and were willing to face the Holy City Judgment, all the priests including the Archangels from the Holy City could not dispose of them!

They were required to deliver those folks to the Holy City. Those people would be subject to the judgment of the Eleven Stones!

The oath was engraved in the soul of the Archangel.

When Mo Fan recited the curse with the power of divinity, the Archangel Shalitha could only take Mo Fan back in chains. He had no right to get rid of Mo Fan. Otherwise, the divine oath would come back to haunt the Archangel Shalitha.

“You’re living on borrowed time!” Shalitha was enraged.

‘Who taught Mo Fan that language?!’

It was true that the Holy City embraced the divine oath, but only few people in this world knew of it. Someone must have been assisting him! That person must be in a higher position in the Holy City!

Could it be the Wicked God?

Even though Mo Fan had just become the Wicked God with powerful magic, Shalitha was confident that he could kill him!
