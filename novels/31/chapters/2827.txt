Chapter 2829: White Disastrous Cloud

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A loud noise reverberated from the direction of the seawall. Mu Nujiao followed the sound and found that the dam that blocked the sea surface had collapsed.

During the construction, the Battlemages had emphasized that these seawalls were heavy rocks transferred from Ding City and could withstand Advanced-level magic. They had assured them that if there was ever an attack from asea monster, they could withstand it for a long, long time.

But what Mu Nujiao saw was not a solid dam at all. There was only dust and rubble where the dam used to be. It had collapsed so easily!

“Moo! Moo! Moo!”

The Ice Ax Manatees got closer, and Mu Nujiao had to retreat to the collapsed dam to prevent these Ocean Demons from chasing the students.

“There is a big demon coming this way, so don’t go in that direction!” In mid-air, a Battlemage riding a Heavenly Eagle saw Mu Nujiao.

Mu Nujiao ignored him and ran in that direction.

A strange sound of rolling stones colliding came from the direction of the dam, and Mu Nujiao saw that many white shells were constantly hitting those rocks.

Those shells were pure white. Their thick bodies were comparable to an armed tank, and hard thorns covered the outer layer. When they stretched their bodies, they looked like evil maggots. However, they transformed into a powerful gear tank when they curled up.

These white Shell Demons broke the sturdy dam into pieces, leaving the battlemages guarding the dam without any support at all.

The Ocean Demons finally launched an all-out attack on the defensive line.

They first used the supreme supernatural power to open the sky, poured the seawater into the city, let a part of the Ocean Demons launch an attack, and quickly eliminated those Mages who resisted. Then, these white Shell Demons smashed and knocked down the dam.

The towering dam collapsed, and Mu Nujiao could finally see the sea again. However, she did not see turbid blue water but countless Shell Demons that glowed with a dazzling luster under the light.

The Shell Demons covered the sea until there was nothing else. Mu Nujiao did not know when the Shell Demons had covered the sea. When she looked closely, she found that the white Salamander and white Shell Demons were floating, crawling, and wriggling on the surface. There were so many of them that she could not see the end of the army of white Salamanders and white Shell Demons. The vast sea was overcrowded.

“White Disastrous Cloud…”

The White Disastrous Cloud above the Pacific Ocean was a terrifying phenomenon of the attack of the Ocean Demons that the patrol helicopter of the American Sacred Hall of Liberty discovered. It was approaching the coastal land!

People had known for a long time that it was extremely dangerous. There were so many of them that the sea level would rise several meters instantly.

The sea was over one million square kilometers. When the White Disastrous Cloud came, the sea level rose rapidly, which could instantly engulf most cities in the same sea level.

Now that the White Disastrous Cloud had appeared on the seaside of the Magic City, humans could not withstand the attack of this vast army of Salamanders and Shell Demons.

…

The Green East Sea God flew above the Ningxia Plateau. When it shuttled through the stratosphere, it saw a long line of airflow running through the sky, and it did not disperse after the Green East Sea God left for a long time.

“How did the White Disastrous Cloud come to Shanghai? How did it do it?” Zhao Manyan exclaimed again while looking at the video.

At high altitudes, the signal was not very good. The last information they received was a recording of the White Disastrous Cloud attacking the city. They were rushing to the Magic City.

“The Ocean Demons have never launched a major attack like this before. On one hand, it is to test how many Forbidden Mages we have. On the other hand, it is preparing meticulously for mass destruction. They are waiting for the White Disastrous Cloud,” Zhang Xiaohou said.

White Disastrous Cloud…

It was the all-out attack plan of the Ocean Demons, and the Mirage Dragon King Ant Mother had been just a foil. They relied on the White Disastrous Cloud to engulf the human coastline and the nearly 20,000-kilometer coastal defense line.

“The shells of the Salamanders and Shell Demons have a certain degree of immunity to human elemental magic. The Ocean Godly Horde first launched a surprise attack with the Sky Gap Waterfall and used the army of Salamanders and Shell Demons with magic immunity as the vanguard and shield army. In the end, they launched a full-scale attack. The Ocean Demons have launched a devastating war on our base city!” Mo Fan’s face darkened.

Mo Fan had dealt with those Salamanders before. According to Lingling’s meticulous research, Salamanders were mutants with unparalleled reproductive ability.

Cao Qinqin had been to Japan, and Japan had dealt with the White Disastrous Cloud in the past. Cao Qinqin reported that the silver shell armor among the Shell Demons could partially reduce the power of a magic spell.

Partially reducing the power of a magic spell meant the power of a Super Level magic would be reduced by forty percent when it hit the Shell Demons. If it were a high-level Shell Demon, the power of the magic would be reduced by seventy percent!

When the Salamanders were fully armed, they could break through the solid seawall.

The ability of the Shell Demons to reduce the power of magic abolished the firepower of several important magic fortresses along the coast.

The enemy attacked the city, and countless high-level Ocean Demons landed in the city to slaughter Mages. The army of Salamanders and Shell Demons attacked the defense line of the seawall. Even if Mo Fan was not present at the scene of destruction, he could still feel the desperation in the Magic City.

“Mo Fan, we shouldn’t return. There’s nothing we can do to help,” Jiang Shaoxu said despondently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“We have to do something. We’re not going to sacrifice ourselves. We’re just going to help,” said Mo Fan.

“I just received an emergency strategy from my father. Ding City will be used as the evacuation point. Since you are an Honorary Councilor of Ding City, you need to quickly remove all the demons between the Magic City and the Rock Capital of Ding City. This is what we have to do,” Jiang Shaoxu said loudly.

Ding City…

Instead of going to the Magic City, they should go to Ding City. Mo Fan was very familiar with the environment of Ding City. There were only rocks there. It couldn’t be compared to the richness of the Magic City. Ding City could not support so many people.

“I agree with Jiang Shaoxu. The Magic City has fallen, and it makes no sense for us to rush there now,” Zhao Manyan said.

“What about other base cities?” Mo Fan asked.

“There is no news of them being attacked for the time being.”

Mo Fan looked at them. He could not make up his mind.

He felt uncomfortable when he was indecisive. He never liked feeling that way so he kept trying to become stronger. But no matter how strong and powerful he got, the hopelessness remained.

“Wait! Wait!” Lingling suddenly shouted.

Her voice was filled with excitement, which made everyone confused.
