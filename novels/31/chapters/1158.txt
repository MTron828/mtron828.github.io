The vampire flipped his hands. Blood started appearing around him and turned into two long whips rapidly.

The vampire lashed out with the blood whips adeptly, hitting the enormous white wolves from different angles. The whips left shocking wounds on the muscular wolves, and even knocked them flying. The wolves slammed into the mountain walls and bled severely! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The vampire burst out laughing. Each whipping would result in cries of agony from the wolves. The pack of wolves charged forward, yet they struggled to move any closer to the vampire. The wolf that was the quickest in the pack finally made it to the vampire, yet the vampire disdainfully knocked the wolf to the bottom of the stairs with a flying kick. The wolf lost consciousness, and could no longer get up.

“Come, I’ll have some fun with you fools!” the vampire shouted proudly. He was less cunning and despicable than the previous statues. Each of his actions resembled that of a noble warrior while he played the wolves like a fiddle!

The wolves could not even touch the corner of the vampire’s robe. He was extremely good at evasion, and even Mo Fan could only see a blurry outline moving around.

Mo Fan was aware of the Blood Tribe’s abilities because of Liu Ru. However, Liu Ru was a few levels weaker than this proud vampire. If it wasn’t for the magic formation, even ten thousand Mo Fans would be no match for him.

The vampire was very agile. He stepped on a wolf’s head and launched himself into the air, while the wolf’s head slammed heavily onto the stairs, breaking a few of its fangs.

Another wolf leapt into the air and bit at the vampire. To its surprise, the vampire suddenly turned into a glowing purple bat and flew out between the gaps of its fangs.

The wolf missed. When it fell back to the ground, the vampire had already regained his human form. He grabbed the wolf’s leg and flung the beast around.

Another wolf with long claws pounced at the vampire, yet it ended up colliding with its comrade. The vampire stood there and watched the two wolves whose heads were spinning from the collision, chuckling scornfully.

“It...it’s like he’s beating up a bunch of puppies! What a strong vampire!” Zhu Meng exclaimed.

The vampire’s strength was already suppressed. If he had his full strength, he could easily stir up great chaos. The Parthenon Temple was really something, forcing a vampire to guard the mountain path for them!

“I already said it, this vampire is on a different level compared to the demon statue. As a matter of fact, Mo Fan will not be in danger if he loses here. The Blood Tribe is known for its strong self-esteem, they are too proud to use despicable methods. If Mo Fan loses to the vampire, he will not lose his cultivation. Speaking of which, I’m not sure which generation this vampire is from. He’s different from most of the Blood Tribe. He has a rather strong human nature, and he’s only willing to drink a specific person’s blood to sustain himself. It turns out that the person died years ago, meaning that he will die eventually after losing his supply of blood. Therefore, he volunteered to fall into a deep slumber on the Starry Mountain Path and guard the Parthenon Sacred Mountain,” Pang Lai said with a wry smile.

“Does that mean he can leave whenever he wants?” Zhu Meng asked.

“Yeah, I believe his ancestors are somehow related to the Parthenon Temple. Using the Parthenon Temple’s magic, he will lose his life force at a much slower rate,” Pang Lai confirmed.

“How do you know so much?” Han Ji asked.

Pang Lai coughed awkwardly and said, “I was young back then, and I’d never lost to anyone. Yet I ended up losing to him, so I went and investigated his background.”

“...”

“If Mo Fan wins, should you just find a hole and hide inside it?”

“Piss off!”

Tisu harrumphed coldly on the mountain.

During the ceremony for the Blessing of the God’s Seal, she had already been displeased with Mo Fan’s arrogance. She actually felt great when she saw the vampire Bola attacking.

It was necessary to teach any man who did not pay any respect to the Parthenon Temple a lesson!

“Bola should be able to defeat the kid easily. Humph, if he advances further, it’s going to damage our reputation!” Hall Master Haylon said.

Even Super Mages did not dare barge onto the Starry Mountain Path. However, if Mo Fan managed to overcome the challenge as only an Advanced Mage, many people were surely going to take on the challenge too! Even though the rule had been around for a long time, having many people taking on the challenge would surely damage their reputation too. As such, he hoped that the vampire Bola could take out this intruder as quickly as possible, so the others would not think that the Starry Mountain Path was easy to overcome.

“Hall Master, Mo Fan was the strongest participant in the World College Tournament. He’s even more dominating after obtaining the Blessing of the God’s Seal. He has five Elements, two powerful Summoned Beasts, strong Fire and Lightning... it’s reasonable that he managed to defeat the first two statues. From what I know, this Starry Mountain Path was built as a challenge for young, talented Mages under the Super Level,” the authority of the Shoreline Alliance, Conti, spoke up.

The Shoreline Alliance was responsible for tracking down the gigantic beast that had shown up in Venice. Conti had visited the Parthenon Temple, hoping that the Hall of Knights could lend them some elites to track down the beast. She happened to arrive as Mo Fan was barging into the mountain path.

The Hall of Knights was unable to dispense any knights because of the recent incident. A Saintess had been murdered, and the knights had to be on alert. The situation would only return to normal once Xinxia was executed. Conti had no choice but to wait at the Parthenon Temple so she could head straight out to the Mediterranean with the elites of the Hall of Knights once the execution was carried out.

Mo Fan glanced at the wolves lying across the place with serious injuries. He fixed his eyes on the powerful vampire in front of him.

The wolves were not dead. Mo Fan withdrew them into the Summoned Beast Plane. He believed the Flying Creek Snow Wolf would settle the wolves. The reason that Mo Fan had Summoned the wolves was that the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was already the ruler of this tribe of White-Eyed Giant Wolves in the Summoned Beast Plane. Since the wolves were under the command of the Flying Creek Snow Wolf, they would obey Mo Fan’s commands too, allowing Mo Fan to control them effectively.

The White-Eyed Giant Wolves were strong, but the vampire Bola was way stronger. He had taken out the White-Eyed Giant Wolves with ease.

Mo Fan’s heart sank. He could easily tell how strong his opponent was. The vampire was clearly stronger than the Dark Swordmaster. He would not be able to survive a single attack if the magic formation was not here!

Mo Fan calmly analyzed the situation while walking up the stairs. The blood of the White-Eyed Giant Wolves had dyed the stairs red. His footprints were left on the stairs when he walked past.

So what if he was facing a strong opponent? He had no choice but to fight! He could not wait a second further, he wanted to see Xinxia right now!

The vampire, Bola stood and watched Mo Fan as he came up the stairs. Bola knew Mo Fan was the master of the wolves. He was rather astonished, as this intruder was a lot younger than he had imagined.

Bola stared at Mo Fan and took a deep breath. He could tell his opponent’s mental state from how fast their blood was flowing. He would easily know if the man was scared, or nervous, or something else...

However, when Bola smelled Mo Fan’s blood, his expression changed instantly. He stared at Mo Fan with wide eyes. His pale, handsome face slowly filled with joy as his eyes burned passionately!

“Your blood... your blood!” Bola pointed at Mo Fan and screamed.

Mo Fan was confused. He had no idea what the vampire was excited about. “What’s wrong with my blood?” he asked.

“Stop pretending that you don’t know, the blood in your body isn’t normal! You’ve refined the Blood Sarira, but it didn’t turn you into a monster. That’s impossible...” Bora had a strange look. He was excited and overjoyed, yet he soon denied himself.

Mo Fan was shocked. This vampire knew about the Blood Sarira?

The Blood Sarira was the trigger to awaken the Demon Element. It was why Mo Fan demonized when he only had four Elements!

It turned out... that the Blood Sarira had been around for a long time!?

“You don’t look like an ordinary vampire, either,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan could sense that the vampire’s aura was similar to Liu Ru’s, meaning that his senior might not be a member of the Blood Tribe, but a person with the demon blood.

“Stop treating me like one of those filthy blood-drinking creatures. You didn’t turn into a demon! How did you manage to satisfy the lust of the demon!?” Bola asked.

“I don’t think I’m obliged to answer your questions,” Mo Fan said calmly.

Mo Fan’s true secret was not the Demon Element, but the seemingly-ordinary Little Loach Pendant on his neck. It had allowed Mo Fan to retain his human nature. Even though Mo Fan was quite surprised that the vampire knew about his Demon Element, it was unnecessary to discuss it any further, since he was not friendly!

“Very well, aren’t you courageous? I can’t wait to see what tricks you have up your sleeves, to act so arrogantly in front of me!” Bola seemed infuriated.

Bola flung his coat and turned into a purple bat. He swept through the air like a shadow and arrived in front of Mo Fan within the blink of an eye. He threw a heavy punch at Mo Fan’s chest.

“How quick!” Mo Fan was surprised, but quickly summoned the Black Snake Armor.

The armor protecting his chest caved in instantly. The strong force knocked Mo Fan flying to the side of the path, smashing a few boulders along the way into pieces!

“How weak, you aren’t worthy to possess the power of the demon!” Bola turned into a bat once again and flew in Mo Fan’s direction.

His hands produced a lump of bloody light and tossed it at the pile of broken rocks. It quickly turned into a pond of blood, crushing the rocks into dust.

“Humph, a mere little trick!” Bola noticed that Mo Fan had Blinked away. He immediately moved a hundred meters away with a flicker of motion.

Space trembled slightly. Mo Fan reappeared, but to his surprise, Bola was already waiting for him. He grabbed Mo Fan who had just Blinked to the spot and lifted him up with an icy stare!

Mo Fan was astounded. Exactly what kind of vampire was he? The vampire was able to predict where he would reappear after using Blink! He was a very experienced old vampire!
