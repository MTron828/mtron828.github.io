Li Kai’s face started twitching when he heard the words!

-This guy is totally humiliating us on purpose!-

“As long as our god is around, we will continue to live even if we die, my god...” Li Kai took out a red poisonous pill, speaking as if he was being martyred.

“Shut the hell up!” Mo Fan slapped the Gray Priest out of his mad belief with the back of his hand.

The space nearby rippled briefly. Li Kai could not even finish his sentence when Mo Fan used the Space Element to give him a great slap. It promptly dislocated his lower jaw.

Mo Fan was incredibly annoyed. He was kind-hearted enough to let the man die an easy death, yet even when the man was about to die after eating a poisonous pill just like the fanatics of a cult did on TV, he still had to utter some chants to his god without caring that it would annoy the hell out of Mo Fan!

“Here, I’ll adjust that for you!” Mo Fan gave the priest another slap to the face.

There was another ripple, and a stronger force struck the Gray Priest on his lower jaw, further dislocating it in the opposite direction!

“Oh, that was a bit too heavy, let me try again, I promise you it’s going to be fine after this,” apologized Mo Fan with mock sincerity.

Li Kai felt like he was about to go crazy. The slap had knocked the pill out of his mouth! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It should be fine now, it looks right...huh, why did your jaw drop, here, let me fix that for you!”

Fang Shaoli sat down on a cold wooden chair. A priest in a gray outfit was kneeling before her feet, reporting what he had witnessed to her.

“I didn’t dare to get any closer, but that young Hunter was indeed torturing our priests...” said Gray Priest Qin Ji.

“You didn’t dare to get closer?” Fang Shaoli smiled, but her smile had no warmth at all!

The Gray Priest immediately dug his head lower. His nose was almost touching the floor.

Fang Shaoli raised her heel and stabbed the back of the Gray Priest’s head fiercely. The heel was as sharp as a dagger. It immediately sank into the man’s skull...

The Gray Priest let out a horrible cry, but he did not dare to move still. Fresh blood was pouring out of the back of his head. Even as death was approaching, Qin Ji did not dare to resist.

The people of the Black Vatican clearly knew that death was not scary. What was worse was their soul suffering endlessly after their death.

Fang Shaoli raised her leg and said coldly, “Get out of my sight if you’re still alive. Gather all the Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts to the Slanted Hall!”

The heel was stuck to Qin Ji’s head. He had actually survived the blow. It was quite hard to believe how he managed to stay alive after the heel left a hole in the back of his head.

Qin Ji remained bending forward as he left the room. He immediately passed on Fang Shaoli’s order before treating the shocking wound on his head...

Fang Shaoli glanced at the entrance of the Slanted Hall and snapped furiously. “Treating my people like cattle? Only I have the right to do so!”

“Why are you being mad over a little Hunter? Isn’t everything still under your control?” A rather flirtatious-looking man snuggled up to Fang Shaoli like a little pet.

The others immediately turned around when they saw the man.

Everyone knew that the man was Fang Shaoli’s favorite. Not only did he have a pretty face, he liked to wear purple clothes too, and his skin was smoother than a woman’s.

Fang Shaoli gradually calmed down when she saw the man. She fondled his face and began to have some pleasure with him, as if she had completely forgotten about the intruder that had destroyed the Prayer Hall!

It was unnecessary to waste her time on a mere intruder, as everyone would soon turn into poisonous monsters under her control. She would not even have to worry about the Enforcement Union, let alone a single Hunter!

However, she still needed a bit more time until the queen was ready to scream and awaken the poisonous worms hiding in everyone’s bodies, turning them into part of her massive army.

“What are you planning to do next?” asked the pretty man.

“Senior Salan was worried that the world has forgotten her, so I was thinking of holding a grand ceremony here on Chongming Island after the awakening of my army,” Fang Shaoli grinned madly as she talked about it.

Lots of people on Chongming Islandwere carrying the symbiotes. Even though it would take the queen some time to awaken all her people, she would not mind carrying out the experiment in advance after their base had been compromised!

A surging flame filled up a narrow path. The Dark Beast Monsters were planning to intercept their enemy here. However, they immediately fled for their lives in fear when they saw the fierce flames lunging at them.

The fire swept over them in an instant, raising endless cries of agony.

As the fire weakened, a human figure walked out of it with a sharp gaze, staring ahead.

There was a bridge in front of him. It was pretty rare to see a bridge underground.

The bridge was leading to a huge, spacious hall made of blue rocks. The hall was most likely the Slanted Hall that everyone had mentioned, considering how heavily guarded it was.

Under the bridge was a bottomless abyss over twenty meters wide.

There were lots of monsters on the bridge. The whole thing was crawling with Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts. Not only were they stacking up on the bridge, they were crawling under it too. It felt like the whole thing was made of these ugly monsters.

Meanwhile, the disciples and Gray Priests were standing on the other end of the bridge. They had obviously learned about Mo Fan’s strength, and had gathered here to form an inescapable net just for him!

Mo Fan did a rough headcount. The members of the Black Vatican here were at least worth eighty million. It turned out that their numbers were a lot higher than he first imagined!

Mo Fan was a bit curious too. Why weren’t the Black Vatican running away? It was obvious that the people of the Enforcement Union would soon surround the place. Even with the mutated monsters that Lingling mentioned, it would only hold the Enforcement Union back briefly. It did not make sense for them to receive him with such a grand formation.

“Lingling, they don’t look like they are planning to escape,” Mo Fan told Lingling through his communication device.

“The poison strikes in phases. I believe the queen is similar to the Mother Scale Skin Phantom, it needs some time to accumulate its energy. I’m guessing that they are waiting for the queen to mature. You already saw how quickly the Mother Scale Skin Phantom evolved, so you better kill the queen as soon as possible. Otherwise, the effect is going to spread like a plague...” warned Lingling.

“I understand, but I can’t tell how long it will take for me to force my way in, considering their numbers,” Mo Fan frowned, staring at the small army on the bridge.

“Your backup is almost there.”

“My backup? The Enforcement Union?”

“No, the Enforcement Union is being held off by the mutated monsters... her speed is shockingly fast!” said Lingling.
