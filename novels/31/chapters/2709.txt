Chapter 2710: Truly An Expert

Little Loach always guaranteed Mo Fan’s improvement in his cultivation. Mo Fan hadn’t inspected Little Loach’s small world for a while now. He decided to enter Little Loach’s Pendant though his mind before dawn. As he did, a whole new world appeared in front of him.

The Nether River was no longer how it used to be. Ever since Mo Fan absorbed the Ancient King’s soul essences, the Nether River within Little Loach’s world had grown madly. It had gradually transformed into a vast ocean.

Beneath the ink-colored Nether Ocean, different grades of soul essences and soul remnants wandered about like plankton in water. They glowed faintly.

‘The number of soul essences and soul remnants has reduced. Could I have used some of them to help me to upgrade my cultivation realm?’ Mo Fan thought, as he made his round of inspection into Little Loach’s world.

Mo Fan had accumulated a lot of soul essences and soul remnants. He intended to use them to strengthen Old Wolf and the rest of its wolf pack so that they could form an elite wolf gang to rob the rich and save the poor. But he had exhausted his resources in such little time.

“The accumulation of soul essences and soul remnants contribute to breaking through the barrier of cultivation. Little Loach, you’ve upgraded a lot this time!” Mo Fan said happily.

The soul essences and soul remnants served as Little Loach’s daily food. Meanwhile, the rare resources and totem’s energy would be a feast. Little Loach had upgraded to a level where it could convert the soul essences and soul remnants into cultivated pushing energy for Mo Fan.

But his Chaos Element and Earth Element had not reached Super Level yet. Mo Fan had to increase his power by leaps and bounds if he was to bring these two elements up to par with the rest. Mo Fan possessed fusion magic, thus he had to ensure each of the elements were equally powerful in order to push his fusion magic to an ultimate level.

During the Fanxue Mountain battle, Mo Fan had not used fusion magic. Truth was, his Black Dragon Suit, Flame Demon King, and the fusion magic were three of his greatest powers. If not for the fact that the elders kept a close eye on him from the shadows, Mo Fan would have ended the battle earlier with the use of fusion magic.

Mo Fan did not have the intention to hide his power. Zhao Jing, after all, had been the heir to the Zhao family. But if Mo Fan had used his fusion power, Fanxue Mountain would have been destroyed. Besides, it was always best to keep one power hidden from enemies until truly needed.

Mo Fan had continuously cultivated his Earth and Chaos Elements for some time now. These two elements were almost at the stage of a breakthrough. Little Loach had advanced to the level where it could use the soul essences and soul remnants to help Mo Fan to break through the barrier. As long as the amount of soul essences and soul remnants were sufficient, the two elements could advance to Super Level soon.

While the rest of the mages had fully cultivated the four elements, Mo Fan had Super Level in all eight. That should be considered another type of greatness in itself.

A small team happened to enter the fortress these few days. He might get a chance to summon his Earth and Chaos Elements. After that, he would try out his Summoning Element so that he could take turns to improve other elements.

In order to improve magic power, one had to cultivate it internally, as well as to exercise it externally.

“I suppose Mingwu Ancient City is not an extremely dangerous place. If nothing special happens, I believe I can temporarily forgo Fire Element, Shadow Element, Lightning Element, and Space Element. The summoning of Super Level Earth and Chaos Elements should be sufficient to take on the demons.”

Mo Fan treated each of the elements as his children. So, he had to take turns training them equally. If he only relied on the Fire and Lightning elements, the growth of other elements would be stunted.

Mo Fan had too many magic elements. Whenever he confronted powerful enemies, the other elements played auxiliary roles. It was not a good thing. He should be able to summon all elements if he wanted them to grow equally powerful.

‘I must stop myself from using Fire, Lightning, Shadow, and Space Elements!’ Mo Fan reminded himself.

He had no other choice. If he wanted to fully cultivate all eight elements and become the world’s greatest mage, he needed to grow all of them. The same theory applied to the martial arts experts where they had to often train themselves in multiple moves.

...

The roosters crowed. When Mo Fan opened his eyes, he saw that the sky was bright. He fixed his drowsy gaze outside the window. After a while, the drowsiness left and he felt fresh again.

Mo Fan stretched. He had to admit that the outside air was different from big and bustling cities. The air here was more refreshing and cooling.

The base city required huge expansion. Most of the time, the views were blocked by the large frames of industrial megalopolis. The sky in base cities was always dusty and hazy. It was a rare sight to behold a clear sky.

The tidal fog had vanished, as if it had been sucked away by God. The sky was clear and windy, the dark purple hue from dawn gradually faded and turned bright blue as the sun began to rise and illuminate the sky.

Mo Fan enjoyed the weather. He imagined Bo City entering the rainy season which would then turn warm for the spring season. The place would be filled with women in mini dresses and light clothing. Mo Fan remained in these happy thoughts.

‘D*mn the accursed Ocean Demons, evil and wicked Emperor of the South Ocean. They had covered all the beauty with a layer of cloud, like a claw choking a human’s throat!’ Mo Fan cursed.

As Mo Fan headed toward the city entrance, he realized most of the mages had risen early, and the morning market was already crowded.

“Brother, I notice that your temple has darkened and your eyes are dull. I’m afraid this trip will end in bloodshed. I have an Eight Treasure Armor that I can give you because I have faith in you. Please feel free to contribute some joss stick money.” A scruffy man in a monk’s robe smiled as he approached Mo Fan.

Mo Fan ignored him. People spewed all kinds of nonsense, including omens from Buddhism and fate and destiny, just to sell their wares. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

If they were paid less money, they would say fate was against whoever was buying. If one happened to pay a lot, then fate would suddenly be by their side. Mo Fan wasn’t a fool, he knew about these silly tricks.

When he arrived at the entrance, it was very crowded. The people were already in groups at the square. They were well-equipped and ready to depart. Groups of people walked out of the fortress one after another.

Demons roamed around the fortress. Once they left the fortress, danger awaited them. The veterans talked and laughed along the way, as if they were on a vacation. The novices, on the other hand, looked like they were about to face their deaths.

When Mo Fan reached the entrance, he saw the two girls from yesterday. Big Sister Ying dressed up the same. She was mostly dressed in sky blue with hints of orange and red. She looked slightly more mature.

Meanwhile, Shu Xiaohua wore a headscarf and conical hat. She dressed vibrantly, mainly in bright yellow. She had a silvery voice and looked adorable like an Oriole bird, lively and full of vigor.

“Expert, you’ve arrived! Come, I’ve gotten some treasures. If it hadn’t been for my destiny with a monk, I wouldn’t be able to obtain so much stuff. I’ve bought one for each of my sisters and one for you. Put it on.” Shu Xiaohua was all smiles.

“Is this Eight Treasure Armor?” Mo Fan raised one of his eyebrows.

“Yes. What a good sense of judgment you have! You’re truly an expert!” Shu Xiaohua smiled radiantly.
