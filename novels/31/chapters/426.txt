Wei Rong pulled a long face when he heard the objections from the students. His already rough look turned even fiercer and more intimidating.

“Enough!” Wei Rong yelled in a rough voice. His voice quickly covered the sound of the crowd, as if none of them dared to make any noise when Wei Rong clenched his brow. The students of the Fire School were fairly respectful of their Elemental Director.

Wei Rong glanced at the students of the Fire School and spoke, “Today, I’m totally disappointed by you all. It’s meaningless for the duel to keep going from this point onward. Initially, I desired every student in the Fire School to become an elite, an outstanding Magician, which is why I was strict to a transfer student whom I assumed had given up on his previous Element halfway.

“However, he has proven to everyone that he’s no weaker than most of the students from the Fire School. If you’re really not satisfied with the result, then fight him in a fair duel in the future, instead of stirring up a scene here to save a little bit of your dignity. Dignity is something you earn with your hands. I hope that one day, a student of our Fire School is able to defeat this transfer student at his peak! That will be the best justification to the school.”

Wei Rong’s words echoed in the students’ minds. Most of them were simply demanding an ending they could accept for the matter on hand, yet they had totally ignored the fact that they had lost the duels. Many began to feel ashamed.

Bai Mei nodded with a slight smile. If Wei Rong had done this earlier, he would have stopped the criticism from the other Elemental Schools.

“Mo Fan, down you go. Your injuries aren’t light at all. Any delay further might affect your recovery,” said Bai Mei.

Mo Fan nodded. He was indeed feeling extremely uncomfortable. Luckily, Dean Xiao had made it in time.

He went down from the stage, and as he passed by Dean Xiao, he murmured, “Old man, why did you come so late?”

Dean Xiao glared at him and responded, “Is it that hard to stay out of trouble?”

Mo Fan chuckled without commenting any further.

“Go ahead and treat your wounds,” Dean Xiao blurted out after he saw Mo Fan’s injuries.

Mo Fan quickly left the dueling ground. No matter how dissatisfied the people of the Fire School or the other Elements were, they had no choice but to leave the place. That being said, talk about the duels that had lasted from the morning to late at night were surely going to spread wildly through the school.

——

“It’s not too bad, the fire resistance granted by your Soul Seed’s flame is fairly strong. Someone else would suffer from lingering effects of the burn for a few months without getting treated in time. The Healing Magic I’ve given you can only treat the wounds on your skin, but there are still some lingering effects in your body. You’ll have to consume some countering medicine for a week,” said Bai Mei, after giving Mo Fan a thorough check-over.

Mo Fan nodded. From what he recalled, the lingering effect of a burn was something he should not underestimate. Otherwise, it might slowly penetrate his inner organs. By that time, Healing Magic would be fairly useless against it. He could only use a significant amount of medicine and other recovery Magic to heal it slowly. The medicine was relatively costly, and something that most hunters spent lots of money on.

“Thanks, Mr. Bai Mei,” said Mo Fan.

“By the way, something is a little strange about your body composition. Did your body go through some kind of irregular modification?” said Bai Mei all of a sudden.

“Is there something wrong about it?” asked Mo Fan.

“I can’t really tell. Normally, the injuries of those who are suffering from a burn will slowly worsen, posing a threat to their lives when the condition worsens to a certain level. However, I discovered that your wounds are already showing signs of recovery when you came down from the stage,” said Bai Mei.

“Isn’t that a good thing? It’s just showing that my body can heal faster.”

Bai Mei shook his head and continued after looking him up and down. “I wouldn’t mention it if it was a normal recovery. Something is a bit strange about your body. If possible, I suggest finding a more proficient Healer to give your body a thorough exam. I can sense some kind of irritable Element inside your body, and it’s not any Magic Element, White Magic or Dimensional Magic that we usually see. If anything, it bears similarities to Black Magic.”

Mo Fan glanced at Mr. Bai Mei in astonishment.

He had once acquired the power of the Demon Element. However, some aged Magicians in the Southern Military had confirmed that most of the residue of the Demon Element in his body had dissipated. This Bai Mei’s cultivation was fairly outstanding, otherwise, he would not be able to sense the remnants of it.

If the Demon Element could be considered an Element, it would surely be listed as a Black Magic.

Mo Fan could not help but be impressed by this teacher.

“Alright, I’ll ask around. Thanks, sir,” answered Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was worn out by the time he arrived back at his apartment.

Ai Tutu swung her large breasts around while talking to Mo Fan, who was lying on the couch continuously.

The girl seemed exceedingly excited. Her gleaming eyes were somewhat surprisingly displaying a slight hint of admiration toward Mo Fan.

On the other hand, Mu Nujiao was more worried about his injuries. She blamed him for stirring up trouble just after he had returned to school.

Mo Fan fell asleep halfway without knowing it. He was indeed too tired, but he did enjoy himself in the duels!

———-

Mo Fan woke up at midnight, and saw he was covered in a thick blanket. The previously lively living room was silent.

Mo Fan took a can of cider from the fridge and switched to lying on the balcony, where the air was much fresher.

“The overall strength of the students here at the main campus is a lot stronger than I imagined. Those born with innate Soul Seeds were only ranked slightly over a hundred in the Fire School. Doesn’t that mean lots of people ranked in the top one hundred have a chance to defeat me, and those ranked in the top fifty or even top ten are pretty much a bunch of monsters?” mumbled Mo Fan after taking a sip from the pineapple cider.

He was only in one of the Element Schools in the main campus. If all the Elements were combined, the number of experts would be comparable to the number of hairs on a cow. It was not an easy task for him to stand out among them.

He still had lots of room for improvement!

If he managed to find himself a Contracted Beast, his strength would improve significantly. He should try and level-up his Lightning Nebula to the third tier, too...

Not to mention his Shadow Element, which was still at the first tier. The Giant Shadow Spike: Twins was an extremely useful Spell. Last but not least, equipment: he only had two pieces of equipment. It was said that those ranked in the top fifty each had a set of equipment. If he were to fight against any of them, he would find himself at a disadvantage because of his equipment.

It seemed like he should be cultivating more diligently, to fill up the current gaps in his strength...
