Chapter 2970: List of Sinners

The court was huge. It was like a large stadium where people could watch sporting events.

In a place like the Twin Guardian Towers, there was a great deal of controversy, and public voting was required for many major decisions.

The members of the Twin Guardian Towers had the right to vote to decide the appointment of others.

When Mo Fan and Lingling arrived at the court, it was already full of people. It seemed that everyone attached great importance to this matter. Considering the recent events and the lockdown on the Twin Guardian Towers, the chiefs still needed to give an explanation.

They were only able to inform a limited group of people of the details and were unable to call an emergency meeting as before.

The central area housed the processing court. Its size was comparable to a basketball court, and it included a sizable outside seating area that could hold thousands of people.

There were more than thousands of people in the Twin Guardian Towers. The catering staff, gardeners, migrant workers, maintenance workers, and cleaners did not attend the trial. They were not official members of the Twin Guardian Towers.

“The demon aura is everywhere.” Mo Fan glanced at the crowd and sighed.

‘Who was the leader of these monsters?’

A crescent moon, which appeared to be a curved silver line, slowly rose in the sky as outside the big French window. It was gradually squeezing into the murky, turbid darkness.

It was the final night. If they could not find the Red Demon, Mo Fan could not become a Forbidden Mage.

Mo Fan glanced at Lingling. She was very serious and focused. She had a clear clue, but this clue pointed to several people. She needed to rule out some things to be sure.

Dong!

A strange gong sounded, and the four chiefs appeared on the main seats like four judges. Ozawa stood below them.

Ozawa turned around and looked at Mo Fan and Lingling. He smiled apologetically. “I needed to do something about it.”

“But it is dangerous for you to do this. How did you get the chance for a public trial? What if the person you surrender to is also a Blood Demon?” Mo Fan said helplessly to Ozawa.

“Other than you two, there are people who I believe are still trustworthy. Besides, nothing can be done without a price. Brother Kazuaki made sacrifices for his friends and companions in the past. Although the Red Demon controlled him in the end, he still bought more than ten years for the Twin Guardian Towers,” said Ozawa.

When Lingling heard Ozawa say those words, her eyes lit up.

Dong!

At this time, the gong sounded again. Even though it wasn’t loud, banging the gong in the middle of the night was unsettling.

“Ozawa, you took outsiders into the East Guardian Towers and attacked the guards and injured them. This is a felony. If you think of the Twin Guardian Towers as a small kingdom, your action is no different from treason. Do we have to throw you into the East Guardian Towers so that you can reflect on your mistakes and remember your identity as a guardian?” said General Takuichi.

Ozawa surrendered himself to General Takuichi. He seemed to be the person Officer Ozawa trusted.

He possessed the Twin Guardian Towers’ military might. He was in charge of ensuring the security of the Twin Guardian Towers and battled primarily against Ocean Demons from the sea. After all, those held in the East Guardian Towers are all demonic beings who posed a threat to numerous nations.

“The Chief of the Towers visited me. He told me that the Twin Guardian Towers were in a crisis and may collapse at any time. We also mentioned this in the emergency meeting. Everyone in the Twin Guardian Towers should be able to tell that the towers are different from before. Falsehoods, oddities, and inexplicable occurrences are present everywhere. The unexplained things that are exposed, and things that are still hidden…” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“The Chief of the Towers asked me to hand over a list to clean up the incumbents who may have endangered the Twin Guardian Towers,” said Ozawa.

“I know that I have a grave responsibility, and the name of any person I write may affect that person’s life. I dare not be rash and have to be responsible for every incumbent in the Twin Guardian Towers. So, I entered the East Guardian Towers myself and wrote a list.”

Ozawa took a large letter out from his sleeve while he spoke and presented it to the four chiefs with both hands.

The Chief of the Towers did not speak but their faces were stiff.

However, General Takuichi looked at the Chief of the Towers and asked, “Chief, is what Ozawa said true?”

“Yes, but the list of suspects has nothing to do with the felony of breaking into East Guardian Towers,” said the Chief of the Towers.

“Should we take a look at this list first?” said General Takuichi.

The Chief of the Towers hesitated and looked at Katana Mochizuki.

Katana Mochizuki nodded. It was just a list. Nothing would happen even if everyone looked at it.

The list was presented and projected onto the screen through a projector, ensuring that people in the public courtroom could see it.

[Positions.]

[Names.]

Two straight columns made up the list. The first had positions, whereas the second had names.

From the top to the end…

When everyone saw this lengthy list, there was an uproar!

After a few seconds of silence, the Chief of the Towers was enraged. “Ozawa, are you making fun of us?”

“Chief, I did what you told me,” said Ozawa.

“This is your list? This is the position list of all the staff in the Twin Guardian Towers. Everyone’s name is on it!” said the Chief of the Towers.

“Yes, all of us are on the list. Every single one of us. These are the sinners who will cause the Shuangshou Pavilion to collapse at any time!” Ozawa said in a low voice.

Everyone was a sinner.

“The Twin Guardian Towers have become a mess because of all of us. We are about to destroy the Twin Guardian Towers. There are demons in the prison that have dominated us and are about to endanger society and the entire country. Each of us is an accomplice, regardless of our position.”

“We turn a blind eye to the harm, let bizarre things happen, turn a deaf ear to the outside world, and scoff at the truth. General Takuichi just said that the Twin Guardian Towers are like a small kingdom. Now our country is about to be destroyed. Is this because of the action of some dissidents?”

“Every kingdom has corruption and dark corners, but the fallen of the kingdom have already proven that our generation is stupid. We have no resistance in the face of erosion.”

“Maybe some people still stick to their posts and principles, but it’s also a crime to be weak and powerless!”

“We are the ones who ruin the Twin Guardian Towers.”

“Chief, you asked me to hand in a list of people who have threatened the Twin Guardian Towers. This is the list.”

The list shown on the big screen had the names of all Twin Guardian Towers members, including Ozawa!

Everyone was in it!
