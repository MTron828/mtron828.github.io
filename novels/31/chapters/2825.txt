Chapter 2826: He Is a Forbidden Mage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the Azure Pearl Campuses of Pearl Institute, there was a huge gap above the track field. The missing sky was like an abyss under the sea. People shuddered when they looked at it.

The gap lasted for only ten minutes. After ten minutes, the seawater flowed down from it. If it was just an ordinary waterfall, the people could drain it the moment it fell on the Magic City.The gap was large. The white dragon had completely covered the field of the Azure Pearl Campuses. The seawater spread for several kilometers at an impossible speed.

As the water rose, the track field, teaching buildings, stadium, cafeteria, and magic practice room of Azure Pearl Campuses were all flooded.

When the water depth exceeded two meters, many Ocean Demons came out of the Sky Gap Waterfall. Their combat capabilities were terrifying, and they defeated the Mages instantly.

The Ocean Demons were very cunning. Those weak ordinary humans were not a threat to them because they knew only Mages were of consequence. They would only target the Mages.

They wanted to eliminate the armed forces of humans in the shortest time. Once the Mages were done with, they could kill the humans however they wanted.

Pearl Institute was a place with many Mages. After all, it was a magic school.

The powerful Fish Men Generals were akin to demon kings in front of these intermediate-level magic students. Their scales could defend against most intermediate-level magic, and the bone sticks in their hands posed a big threat to the vulnerable magic students.

“Hurry up and run to the emergency shelter. Hurry up and run to the emergency shelter!” several magic teachers shouted.

When they built the base city, they set up emergency shelters at various important locations. The shelters prevented the war from spreading directly into the city, and most of them were provided for ordinary citizens for safety.

“Ah!”

“Run!”

“Don’t run over there!”

In the teaching building, a large group of students was taking classes. There were about a thousand new students, all of whom had entered the school more than a month ago.

Most new students were still at the basic level, and their combat power was not comparable to that of the seniors. They were also not as organized and combat ready as their seniors. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The students could not fight alone with the Commander-level Fish Men Generals. However, they learned to work together and form an emergency team of Mages from different departments during this time of crisis.

Together, these Mage teams could resist the Fish Men Generals. However, the new students were only at the basic level.

Their magic could not even scrape off the scales of the Fish Men Generals. Even though more than a thousand Mages formed a group, they could not withstand the destructive attack of a group of Fish Men Generals.

The number of Fish Men Generals was still increasing. Hundreds of Fish Men Generals rushed down from the Sky Gap Waterfall. The Ocean Demons seemed to have their plan on point. They knew this magic school could hinder them, so they dispatched an army of Ocean Demons with terrifying strength right from the beginning.

Most of them were Commander-level Fish Men Generals, so the new students could not fight against them. Besides, there were hundreds of them in the Azure Pearl Campuses. The situation was dire, and everyone felt hopeless.

People had worked hard to build a magical civilization, and the students had worked hard to learn magic, hoping to change the world one day. However, when they saw these brutal Commander-level demons, they felt insignificant and felt like the magic they had learnt was useless against the enemies. They wondered if being a Mage had a meaning at all in this world.

“Go back to the bottom of the sea!”

Amidst the cries, a solemn chant sounded from the highest part of the teaching building. His voice was full of power, as if a giant bell reverberated across the expanse.

He wore simple robes, had a fluttering beard, and the silver-blue brilliance all over his body was so dazzling that the sky looked dull.

He waved his palm, and the restless seawater in the Azure Pearl Campuses began to flow in a trajectory. The current was turbulent. The plain-robed man controlled all the seawater and made it flow in the opposite direction. The seawater began to spin violently near the field.

Looking down from a height, people realized that the seawater had turned into a huge vortex, and the vortex grew ever more powerful. The Fish Men Generals that were going to attack were constantly sucked to the bottom of the vortex.

It was unknown where the bottom of the vortex ended. It was a destructive army with hundreds of Fish Men Generals. However, they were all sucked and pulled into another space below the vortex.

The seawater was also flowing into this bottomless vortex. The Azure Pearl Campuses gradually came out of its submersion.

In the sky, seawater was still flowing out of the gap. The vortex in the field redirected the seawater to other places, barely forming a balance.

“Dean Xiao, is it possible to block the gap in the sky?” Mr. Bai Mei was anxious.

“It’s not easy to block it,” Dean Xiao said.

“What kind of magic is this? It can tear the sky apart and pour the seawater down. So many Ocean Demons have invaded the city. How are we going to fight in this battle?” Minister Wu said.

“Ms. Zhou, hurry up and take the children to the emergency shelter first. If they are willing to fight, they can stay.” Dean Xiao appeared sad.

It was too sudden and too terrifying.

Even if Dean Xiao, the town-level Holy Mage in the Magic City, knew the Ocean Demons would attack, he would never have imagined that they would have attacked in this manner.

Which demon king could tear apart the sky and pour seawater into the city through this method? If they did not kill this demon king, they would lose this battle.

The Ocean Demons did not attack ordinary citizens but kept attacking the Mages. They probably wanted to enslave and keep humans in captivity. Without the Mages, the citizens in the entire base city would be defenseless and left with no choice but to be enslaved!

“Dean Xiao!”

In mid-air, a man with eagle wings flew with a cold expression. Dean Xiao raised his head and glanced at the man.

“The Forbidden Curse Association ordered me to come…” the eagle-winged man said.

“I know, but I can’t leave right now.”

“You are the only Water Element Forbidden Mage in the Magic City, and the Magic City needs you even more,” the eagle-winged man said solemnly.

Mr. Bai Mei was stunned. She stared at Dean Xiao in surprise.

The entire Pearl Institute knew that Dean Xiao was highly respected and had been focusing on cultivating new students in the Azure Pearl Campuses. They knew he had a high cultivation and was an outstanding Formation Mage.

However, none of them knew he was a Forbidden Mage, too!
