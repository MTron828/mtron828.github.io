Silky, dark brown hair hanging perfectly straight like a waterfall reached the woman’s waist; her fair, graceful profile was not too sharp, but tender and bouncy, making her look friendlier on top of her gentle appearance. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When her pink lips curled up, it would leave a faint curve on her cheeks, resulting in a tremendous change to her temperament. She no longer looked dull like a statue, but brimming with wisdom and elegance, and the youthful charm of a young woman!

Mo Fan stood there with a blank face.

He recognized the woman instantly when he first laid his eyes on her, not because of how much she was standing out, but because of how familiar he was with her. He could feel a great warmth surging inside him.

That being said, Mo Fan somehow felt that the girl was no longer the one he was familiar with. He was having trouble stacking her sacred, noble temperament with her previous lonely, yet unyielding spirit of an ordinary girl-next-door!

-That’s Xinxia!

-But is she really Xinxia?-

They had only been apart for a year, yet her changes were quite dramatic. She no longer looked weak and feeble, like she was in need of protection, nor did she look self-abased, as she had come from an ordinary family. If she was not the dearest person to him, if he had only met her for the first time, he would assume the girl had originated from a renowned family. Her temperament, brimming with elegance and nobility, felt natural, like she was glowing without trying to stand out on purpose!

Even after a long time, Mo Fan still had not collected his thoughts.

“Ningxue? Why are you here?!” the girl exclaimed in surprise.

Mu Ningxue was also staring at her with astonishment. “Xinxia?” Mu Ningxue reacted similarly to Mo Fan. She had only just realized that the Healer that was being praised by the crowd was actually Ye Xinxia.

“Brother... Mo Fan!” Following that, Xinxia saw Mo Fan standing further behind the team like a log. However, his eyes were staring at her, like he had been staring for a long time.

Xinxia immediately blushed even as she wore a blossoming smile. The natural joy bursting out of her made her face blush even further.

She had the urge to run into Mo Fan’s arms and lie on his chest, but she did not do so. She placed her hands on her wheelchair and grabbed the handles tightly. Her eyes were brimming with anticipation and joy.

She did not expect to meet him here!

A familiar feeling surged inside Mo Fan’s heart when he saw Xinxia’s reaction.

She was still the same her, the person that he wanted to fondle admiringly.

On second thought, Xinxia had always displayed her unique temperament in front of others. However, whenever she was with him, she would turn into a little girl that needed guidance and protection. She was not trying to win Mo Fan’s affection, but because she only displayed her most naive and vulnerable side when she was with her dearest family member.

Mo Fan walked up to her and slowly leaned forward. He kissed her on her smooth forehead in front of the crowd!

“What do you think you are doing? How could you be so rude? Do you have any idea how serious the crime is to offend a servant of the Hall of the Goddess!” the male assistant yelled into Mo Fan’s ear.

Mo Fan raised his head and looked at the man with a plastic face and spat back impatiently, “What the heck does me kissing my woman have anything to do with you!?”

“Your woman? Damn it, I, Kulun, Knight of the Parthenon Temple, will not let you humiliate the servant of the Hall of the Goddess that I’ve sworn my loyalty to! I challenge you to a duel, right now!” the man who called himself Kulun said loudly.

Mo Fan glanced at the man who assumed himself to be a knight from ancient times. His first thought was instantly, -What a retard!-

“Kulun, you’re overreacting, he’s my brother, the one that I mentioned before,” Xinxia immediately explained.

Xinxia clearly knew Mo Fan would never bother explaining the situation. He would only complicate things instead.

“Brother?” Kulun looked at Mo Fan suspiciously.

Mo Fan still had the same annoying look on his face, so Kulun was having trouble linking the gentle Xinxia to the asshole Mo Fan. -Would the personalities of two siblings differ so much? This guy is clearly a jerk, the kind that had to be taught a lesson!-

“If you’re really her brother, I will apologize to you, but even as her brother, you shouldn’t be saying a joke like that, either. She is your sister, not your woman. It’s very easy to misunderstand what you said,” Kulun was still staring at Mo Fan alertly.

“You didn’t misunderstand me. She is my sister, and also my woman too,” Mo Fan replied seriously.

Kulun was infuriated. Was there something wrong with this fellow’s mind? Didn’t he know he has to treat a servant of the Hall of the Goddess with utter respect? How could he keep saying such disgraceful words? How could she be both his sister and woman? What was going on here!?

Xinxia knew it would come to this, yet she had no idea how to clarify it. She always had trouble convincing Mo Fan of anything, especially when he was trying to stir up trouble on purpose. She could only glance at Mu Ningxue helplessly.

“Let’s go and talk there, let them do their things.” Mu Ningxue was pretty straightforward too. She pushed Xinxia’s wheelchair slowly off to the side.

Nanrong Ni came up. She first glanced at Mu Ningxue before looking at Xinxia.

“Are you really a disciple of the Parthenon Temple’s Hall of the Goddess?” Nanrong Ni asked seriously.

“I will only become an official disciple after finishing my training here. I’m only on probation now,” Xinxia replied. She did not sound proud at all.

“Oh, oh...” Nanrong Ni said, seeming to be lost in her thoughts.

Mu Ningxue did not place too much attention on her response. She proceeded to ask why Xinxia was here. She found it hard to believe that it was a mere coincidence!

“I’m here as an intern. The students of the Parthenon Temple are now taking the yearly examination. Every student, including those from overseas, have to take part in it, and only by completing the tasks given me can I then enroll in the Parthenon Temple officially and become a Mage of the Temple. Not long ago, there were mirages spotted around here, and since then, the Egyptians have been fighting the undead endlessly. As a result, the students of the Parthenon Temple were sent here to treat the injured,” Xinxia said.

“That’s quite a coincidence, as our national team is sent here too. I believe other national teams must have reached Egypt too, but I didn’t expect us to be in the same city,” Mu Ningxue murmured.

It had been a very long time since Mu Ningxue had last met Xinxia. The two had known each other since a young age, as they were friends growing up. It had nothing to do with Mo Fan, as Mu Ningxue was actually close with Xinxia first, before some shameless boy desperately tried to win her affection and almost kidnapped her.

On the other side, after Xinxia left, Mo Fan had started quarreling with the guy called Kulun.

The reason for the quarrel was very simple. Mo Fan felt extremely uncomfortable when he saw how much of a threat the man’s face posed to him, especially when he was asked to look after Xinxia.

-Who the heck is this? He must be harboring evil intentions, trying to stay close to Xinxia!-

Kulun was very displeased. Someone had blasphemed the goddess that he was entrusted to protect, how could he protect his dignity as a sacred knight of the Parthenon Temple if he didn’t slice the man into eight pieces?

—

“Brother Mo Fan, Kulun is only a guardian knight of the Parthenon Temple’s Hall of Knights. Every member of the Hall of the Goddess has a knight protecting them. Kulun is only fulfilling his role as a guardian knight. Please go easy on him!” Xinxia was amused when she saw Mo Fan’s reaction.

Wasn’t Mo Fan supposed to be quite an experienced and cunning guy? Why was he being so obviously jealous of someone? He was sensitive and hyper, just like a little kid.

“I wasn’t trying to pick a fight with him, it was him that didn’t understand the situation. I already told him our relationship, yet he didn’t believe it, and is still demanding he punish me. Does the Parthenon Temple only have idiots like him? Or perhaps the guardian knights are asked to stop the ladies of the Parthenon Temple from having any love interests?” Mo Fan huffed.

“The temple doesn’t forbid that.”

“Don’t let someone like him stay around you, it’s obvious that he isn’t a good guy,” Mo Fan said.

“The temple arranged it; if you don’t like him, I’ll submit a request to ask for another knight,” Xinxia said.

“Are there female knights?” Mo Fan asked.

“...”

As she thought, Mo Fan was not displeased with Kulun. It was mainly because Mo Fan did not want to see any competitor showing up in front of him!

“Miss Xinxia, an injured man whose chest has been sliced open has been sent here. Please save him, he only ended up like this because he was trying to lure some undead servants away to save our lives!” a man drenched in sweat came over and asked of Xinxia.

Xinxia looked at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan glanced at the sickbed in the white tent and saw a man in his thirties bleeding seriously. It looked like the man would die at any second.

“I’ll go with you!” Mo Fan pushed Xinxia toward the tent.

Mo Fan wanted to have a long conversation with Xinxia, since it had been quite some time since they last met. Seeing someone in person was obviously better than talking over the phone or a video call.

Mo Fan could tell that Xinxia was busily occupied, as many patients were being sent to her to be treated. Since it was about saving lives, Mo Fan was not shameless enough to keep bothering her. He did not mind waiting for her to treat the injured first.
