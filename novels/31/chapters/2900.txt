Chapter 2901: Extreme South’s Chronic Poison

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Mu Ningxue did not expect the world’s experts to recruit her to fight against the Extreme South Emperor. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Moreover, the Forbidden Magic Association in China had also received the same letter. It put Mu Ningxue in a difficult position.

“Ningxue, this letter is from the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance. Every registered mage must obey the recruitment unconditionally, but don’t worry. I have talked to Wei Guang about this. Although the Magic Association in China can’t reject the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance, it has dispatched a team to protect you. Wei Guang is the leader of the team,” Mu Linsheng said softly to Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue had read the letter. She knew that the empty words from the Alliance held no meaning. When she became a mage and joined the Magic Association, she had known that she had no power to reject this kind of recruitment. It was an obligation and duty, just like military service. However, ordinary people did not receive such recruitment.

“We’ll depart after you’re ready. We have no time to waste,” Wei Guang said to Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue did not answer. She needed to verify something. She had her own doubts.

…

“Dean Song He, I received a recruitment letter from the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance.” Mu Ningxue called the Dean of the Imperial College. She had to inquire about this matter in more detail. She didn’t want to be hasty.

“Oh, I know about it. You don’t really want to go, do you?” said Dean Song He.

“Not really. I know I can’t reject it, but I still want to know why I was recruited,” Mu Ningxue said.

“I inquired about it. It’s mainly because of your natural talent. They probably need a mage with a natural Ice Element spiritual body, but they won’t readily reveal what it is that they want you to do,” said Dean Song He.

“Who should I trust when I get there?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“Trust yourself, Ningxue. There are many questionable things about this recruitment, but this letter is from the Holy City and the most prestigious Magic Association in the five continents. Even if they recruit the chairman, the chairman must go. You are the one who will decide what you do during your journey, be it during your encounters or during unforeseen circumstances,” Dean Song He warned.

“I get it. Thank you, Dean Song He,” said Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue asked other people too. But they did not know much about it either. It was obvious that the information about the recruitment from the Holy City and the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance would not be readily disclosed.

Mu Ningxue could do nothing.

Because of the sudden recruitment, she had no choice but to go to the most frightening forbidden place for humanity, the Antarctic continent. It made Mu Ningxue feel a little lost and helpless.

…

Mu Ningxue wanted to tell Mo Fan about it, but she thought it would be a little inappropriate. Therefore, she left a letter for him. After Mo Fan finished practicing his cultivation, he would know her whereabouts.

Mu Ningxue wasn’t hesitating because she didn’t want to disturb Mo Fan, but because telling him would complicate the situation.

First, she could not reject the recruitment as it would be a violation of the magic convention. She could not possibly go against the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance, anyway.

Secondly, Mo Fan would not let her go alone if she told him about it.

He would stop his cultivation and accompany her to the Antarctic Continent. Mu Ningxue could not bear to drag Mo Fan in danger so soon after the battle in the Magic City.

Mu Ningxue informed people to not disturb Mo Fan’s cultivation. She then packed her things and set off.

According to the arrangement of the Forbidden Curse Association, she had to go to South America first. Then, she would set off from Argentina in South America and arrive at the Antarctic Continent after crossing an ocean.

The Forbidden Curse Association allowed Mu Ningxue to bring some companions, but Mu Ningxue refused. Mu Ningxue knew what kind of a place the Antarctic Continent was. She could not predict what would happen there.

Fortunately, the Ice Crystal Bow already had a complete form. Otherwise, Mu Ningxue would feel even more uneasy.

Compared to the group that fought the Extreme South Emperor, her cultivation was insignificantly higher.

…

The Land of the Antarctic was even more mysterious than Tianshan Mountain. For every Ice Element Mage, the primitive landscape with turbulent ice veins was like a big cultivating sanctuary.

Some special Ice Element Mages used to publish articles about the harsh practice in the Extreme South Land, which attracted people who pursued supreme magic.

The Extreme South Land was a land full of treasures for the Ice Element Mages as there were limitless Ice Element resources. It was only in such a forbidden place that humans could break through the limit and become a real Forbidden Mage.

Although this place was dangerous, people were eager to visit. As an Ice Element Mage, Mu Ningxue had heard similar remarks more than once. However, Mu Ningxue had ignored these adulterated cultivation theories.

There were people in the world who liked to be unconventional and express their extraordinariness. However, many people had gone missing and died after stepping into the Extreme South Land.

One could only practice Ice Element if they were strong enough. Otherwise, they would die.

…

“The Antarctic Continent has the power of ice invasion. Standing on the Antarctic Continent is equivalent to putting hot water in an ice bank. Our temperatures will drop slowly. When the water turns to zero degrees and starts to freeze into ice, that’s when our lives come to an end.” Wang Shuo told everyone about the bad conditions on the Antarctic Continent before departure.

Ice invasion would deplete a person’s vital functions little by little. Mages of all levels would suffer from this depletion in their abilities and corresponding strength.

A high level of cultivation would not reduce the impact of ice invasion. Even if they were Forbidden Mages, they would be affected by ice invasion if they stepped into the Antarctic Continent.

This was why the Antarctic Continent was known as the forbidden place on earth.

The Antarctic Continent was extremely harmful to Mages, let alone ordinary people. Humans were rejected here. The moment they stepped in, they would suffer from a “chronic poison”.

“The strength of the creatures in the Antarctic Continent is far greater than that of the Ocean Demons. They should be about five times stronger than the demons on the land. When you see a Commander-level or ruler-level Ice Beast, you must not take it lightly,” Wang Shuo continued.

“You have been to the Antarctic Continent before, right?” Wei Guang asked.

“I was young and ignorant. Alas, this leg is the price I paid at that time. Fortunately, I didn’t die,” Wang Shuo said with a bitter smile as he tapped his left knee with a cane.
