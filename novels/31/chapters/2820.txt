‘Who would have awakened a ten-year-old child?’

This was no different from delivering a severe blow to someone whose brain was not fully developed yet!

“Did your dad awaken you?” Mo Fan frowned. He was furious. This would destroy a child’s road to magic in the future!

If that happened, Xiao Tai basically could never become an Intermediate Mage. He would lack a solid mind foundation. His soul might have already been damaged.

Xiao Tai shook his head. He was about to say something when he turned and stared outside the Ancient City gate. There was a road outside the gate. It looked more like a rough path with tyre tracks than a road.A figure slowly approached the Ancient City gate.

“My dad has come.” Xiao Tai’s eyes lit up.

The man walked to them. He wore a conical hat made of straw so they could not see his face. The man’s clothes were disheveled, as if he had just been looted.

Xiao Tai did not go up to him. He waited by the gate.

When the man finally arrived at the gate, Mo Fan, Mu Bai, Zhao Manyan, Zhang Xiaohou, Jiang Shaoxu, Lingling, and Song Feiyao frowned. They were surprised. They could tell from the smell that the man wasn’t human.

A pair of green glowing eyes were revealed under the conical hat. His face was as pale as a ghost. There was a claw mark on his face, revealing his cheekbone and rows of teeth. The empty town looked even more scary and creepy in the middle of the night.

“Dad!” Xiao Tai seemed to be familiar with this routine.

“An Undead!” Mu Bai and Zhao Xiaohou said unanimously.

An Undead had intelligence akin to a human. It stood there and fixed its gaze on Mo Fan and his group.

“Did you come to capture me? You must make sure you can do so first.” The Undead grinned smugly.

When it grinned and revealed its front teeth, blood stains tainted the gap. It had just murdered someone not long ago.

“We were following some ancient clues, and they brought us here. Were you a guardian of this Ancient City Wall back in those days? We would like to know the meaning of the words engraved on the wall,” asked Lingling.

They were not scared of it. After all, they had seen many Undeads in the Ancient Capital. However, they had never thought Xiao Tai waited for an Undead to come back home every day.

“This is a portal that leads to a mausoleum. I’m a mausoleum watcher… I’ve guarded for… I don’t remember how long I’ve been standing guard over it,” the Undead answered.

“How do we get in?” asked Mo Fan.

“Very simple. You come to me, then you will reach the mausoleum after walking out of the gate,” said the Undead.

“Dad, they are not bad people!” Xiao Tai said anxiously.

“But I’m not a good man either.” The Undead chuckled. It stared at Mo Fan and his group with its green eyes begrudgingly. “I’ve just killed a person.”

“And I am sure that person deserved to be killed,” said Mo Fan.

“How can you tell?” The Undead was puzzled.

“If that person was the one who awakened your son, he deserves to die,” said Mo Fan.

“He has harmed many. He sold Awakening Stone at a very high price and to whoever he pleased,” the Undead said after a pause.

“The Magic Association doesn’t recognize such awakening. Even if the child reaches an appropriate age, the Magic Association will treat them as heretics and arrest them. Their future will be ruined,” Mu Bai added.

The Undead removed its conical hat and put it on the wall. “So, I take it you are not the roving hunters who want to capture me and add to their list of achievements?”

“We are not here for that. We just want to know the meaning of the words engraved on this Ancient City Wall. If it is a portal, how does it open? Where does the portal lead to?” Mo Fan asked.

The Undead took its conical hat with one of its hands and waved at Xiao Tai with its other, signaling him to step to his side.

Mo Fan did not stop Xiao Tai. He allowed the child to go to the Undead’s side. After all, Mo Fan had no intention of holding him hostage.

“I’ve been standing guard over here. What do you think is my purpose for doing so? My purpose is to prevent unnecessary people like you from barging in,” said the Undead firmly. Xiao Tai hid behind his father.

“Since you’re standing guard over it, there must be some people who are allowed in? Can those who defeat you get in?” Mo Fan took a few steps forward.

“You look very confident. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been living for a very, very long time.” A bone-chilling light flashed in the Undead’s eyes.

If not for the fact that the Undead looked like a corpse, it basically was not much different from a human. The Undead that resembled a human so closely was always of a higher level.

Most of the Undead desired complete thinking. They were born powerful with immortal bodies. However, if they were given normal brains, they would have long become the rulers of the Earth.

“Let’s make it simple. If we defeat you, will you let us through?” asked Mo Fan.

“Regardless of whether I’m defeated, I won’t tell you through the portal,” said the Undead.

“Dad, but why? If they win, shouldn’t you tell them the truth?” Xiao Tai asked in confusion.

“This is not a child’s play. If they defeat me and reveal my secret that I’ve kept for so many years about the treasure hidden inside the mausoleum, what do I get in return? Nothing! Instead, I’m going to lose the job,” said the Undead.

Mo Fan was silent. It seemed even Undeads were afraid of losing their jobs…

“We can help you to heal your son’s mental damage so that he can attend magic school. I’m sure you don’t want to keep your son in this remote place, right?” said Mo Fan.

“Really?” The Undead’s green eyes lit up.

“Do we look like we’re going to harm you and your son? We’re just searching for the totem beast clues passed down from our ancestors. We need the totem beast’s help to solve the country’s crisis. The Ancient King is my mentor. The Queen of Nine Serenities is my friend. We are very close to many Undeads. You’re no different from a normal being. What’s the point of putting yourself in such a difficult position?” said Mo Fan.

“Deal.”

“Do you still want a fight?” asked Mo Fan.

“No need. If you dare to cheat me, you will end up like the teacher. I mean what I said!” said the Undead.
