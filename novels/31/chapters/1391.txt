1392 Rock Smash Hammer!

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

A dueling ground of jagged rocks descended from the sky and collapsed onto Violet Ghost like a tiny mountain!

Violet Ghost lifted his eyes. He did not expect that someone was waiting for him in the sky all along. He tried to run out of the cage, but he realized the rocks were less than ten meters above him. If he tried, the rocks were going to fall right on him!

He had no choice but to back away. The heavy rocks crashed down and completely surrounded him. The dueling ground was like a huge coffin, apart from a few cracks that only tiny birds and rays of light could enter!

Zhao Manyan was inside it now. His glimmering eyes in the dim environment were staring right at Violet Ghost.

Violet Ghost was still covered in the poisonous blood, so he could not turn invisible again. The poisonous blood would easily expose his position!

“I thought it was someone more impressive,” Violet Ghost laughed when he saw Zhao Manyan.

Violet Ghost almost thought a Super Mage had shown up. It was easier than flipping a hand for a Super Mage to kill him!

“You don’t have to belittle me like that. The more you belittle me, the more humiliated you will feel when I kill you in the end!” Zhao Manyan retorted coldly.

He did not waste any more time. His eyes emitted a brown light, as he was an expert of the Earth Element, just like Zhang Xiaohou. Rocky scales swiftly covered his body and formed a dark brown armor!

“Are you afraid I’m going to stab your heart too? Look at how careful you are,” Violet Ghost chuckled.

There was no reason for him to be afraid after realizing his enemy was not a Super Mage. Not many Advanced Mages could pose a threat to him.

An icy aura slowly circled around Violet Ghost. He was trying to distract Zhao Manyan with words while summoning several icicles behind Zhao Manyan.

The icicles did not make any sound as they were being formed. Most Mages would not even notice them until they were lunging at their back!.

The icicles produced loud clanks when they landed on Zhao Manyan’s back. He finally realized something was attacking him from behind. He glanced back and saw broken ice scattered on the ground.

Violet Ghost’s eyes widened. His Icy Sword Formation had failed to break through his opponent’s defense! The truth was, as an assassin-type Mage, he hated going up against Mages with an outstanding defense the most!

However, any Mage would have their weaknesses, regardless of their types. It just meant he would have to work harder to kill his opponent! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Heavy Rock Break!”

Zhao Manyan’s control of the Earth Element had improved significantly. On top of that, his Earth Element was strengthened when he was inside the dueling ground!

The Earth Magic rapidly gathered in the spot Zhao Manyan was placing his attention on. The violent energy accumulated and crashed violently, producing a great force that could crush a living thing to pieces!

Violet Ghost sensed the vigorous energy. He quickly moved away with his Wind Element. To his surprise, the violent energy clung to his trail. He saw explosions taking place along his trail. It eventually forced him into a corner!

“Water Curtain!” Violet Ghost knew there was no escape. He set up a defensive barrier before the Earth Magic caught up to him.

The Earth Magic stopped pursuing since it could not penetrate the Water Curtain.

“Plummeting Rays!” Zhao Manyan immediately used his Light Element.

The light arrows shot from the direction that Violet Ghost’s defense was not covering and poured down like rain.

Violet Ghost had no choice but to activate his defensive Equipment. The light arrows were not deadly, but their penetrative ability was still outstanding when focusing on a specific point.

Violet Ghost was clearly the kind of person unwilling to spend money on defensive Equipment. His Armor was easily destroyed by Zhao Manyan’s Light Spell!

Zhao Manyan extended the golden wings on his back when he saw Violet Ghost being suppressed in a corner. The wings lifted him and his heavy rock armor into the air.

Zhao Manyan did not have many offensive abilities. However, since his armor was so sturdy and heavy, he was thinking of picking up his momentum with the wings to ram into Violet Ghost!

The weight of his heavy armor was not to be underestimated, not to mention the Earth Magic that was flowing inside the dueling ground granting Zhao Manyan remarkable power. He ended up knocking Violet Ghost and the armor dangling on his body into the air!

“Light Saber: Slash!”

Zhao Manyan had quite a few pieces of Magic Equipment. He summoned a Deathstrike Magic Equipment after ramming into his opponent.

The Saber appeared in Zhao Manyan’s hands. The scorching golden light saber was around ten meters long. It looked even more threatening after it absorbed the light of the Plummeting Rays!

Zhao Manyan could feel a strong rage burning in his chest. He simply waved the giant light saber at Violet Ghost without caring about technique!

After all, Violet Ghost’s attacks were unable to break through Zhao Manyan’s defense. Regardless of how agile Violet Ghost was, the light saber could still hit him in the confined space.

Violet Ghost had rarely fought against a brute Mage like this. He was frustrated; his outstanding abilities as an assassin were completely useless against Zhao Manyan’s sturdy defense!

“Do you really think there’s nothing I can do because of your defense!?” Violet Ghost said coldly.

With a flicker, Violet Ghost drifted away like a black gust of wind and landed behind Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan simply ignored the attack coming from behind. His Deathstrike Magic Equipment was about to run out of time, but it did not matter, he had more than one offensive item!

“Rock Smash Hammer!”

Zhao Manyan could not care less about Violet Ghost’s attacks. Not just assassin-type Mages would struggle against his armor; even a destructive Mage like Mo Fan would be panting heavily trying to break through his armor.

“Telekinesis: Heart Crush!” Violet Ghost chuckled. A cold ray penetrated Zhao Manyan’s defense and went right for his heart!

Zhao Manyan was shocked when he sensed the presence of Dimensional Magic.

This Violet Ghost had done a great job hiding his true strength. He did not expect him to have the Space Element too!

Normally, a person would only Awaken the Space Element at the Advanced Level. Violet Ghost’s Space Element was clearly his tertiary Element, thus it was not that strong. He was still a little unfamiliar with Blink.

Luckily, Zhao Manyan’s dueling ground had certain restrictions on the Space Element. Otherwise, Violet Ghost could easily escape from it with Blink, meaning that all their efforts and sacrifices would have been in vain!

Violet Ghost’s Space Element was clearly not as outstanding as Mo Fan’s, but he was able to utilize the Space Element as part of his fighting style.

The Telekinesis: Heart Crush was basically his attempt to bypass Zhao Manyan’s defense with the Space Element and deal a deadly blow to his heart. Any defense was just mere decorations in front of the attack!

Zhao Manyan did not expect Violet Ghost to have such a move. It was clearly his trump card against defensive Mages. It would be deadly if he was up against some inexperienced defensive Mage!

“Ring of Venice!” Zhao Manyan activated the ring to defend himself without any hesitation.

The Ring of Venice was extremely useful, because it was not only effective against external attacks, but it could also protect his inner organs too! Why would Zhao Manyan engage the enemy so recklessly if he did not have something like the Ring of Venice?

“The Advanced Mage that can force your Grandpa Zhao to shed a strand of hair isn’t even born yet. Die, you son of a b**ch!” Zhao Manyan grinned. The Rock Smash Hammer was finally completed!

“Ten Thousand Tons, Smash!”

Zhao Manyan lifted the Rock Smash Hammer up high and slammed it down on Violet Ghost!

Violet Ghost was utterly terrified. He used everything he had to run away. Zhao Manyan continued to slam the hammer down. A strong shockwave swept across the place when the hammer smashed onto the ground!

He did not even have to aim the hammer at the target. The attack already covered a huge radius. Even though he could only use it once, it was the best move he had against Violet Ghost!

The brown lights continued to pursue Violet Ghost. The most he could do was cast a Water Barrier to defend himself, but it went without saying that a Basic Spell like Water Barrier had no chance of withstanding the force of the giant rock hammer!

Violet Ghost’s bones cracked after receiving the impact. Blood began to pour out from his nose, mouth, and ears...

“Did you spend most of your time setting up your victims? I can tell that you are nothing but a useless dog if you faced the real experts, after seeing what you are capable of!” Zhao Manyan dashed forward, leaving deep footprints on the ground from the weight of his armor.

“HAHAHAHA, the Grand Ceremony is already taking place. You all are going to suffer a humiliating defeat! Killing me wouldn’t make any difference. The undead army will raze your cities to the ground and kill every single one of you!” Violet Ghost gave up on running away after realizing he had no chance of defeating Zhao Manyan. He ignored the blood that was pouring out of his mouth, nose, and ears.

“Killing you means not a single member of the Black Vatican will live!” Zhao Manyan went up to Violet Ghost and stomped on his legs.

Violet Ghost acted as if he could not care less about his death, but when Zhao Manyan crushed the bones in his legs with a single stomp, his cries of agony were not those of a death-sworn cultist.

“So that’s the reason why you are targeting me... it turns out there’s a spy among us... HAHAHA, but did you seriously think killing me is going to make any difference?” Violet Ghost was in great pain, yet he was trying his best to remain calm.

Zhao Manyan frowned after hearing the words.

“I am not the host of the contracts. You lose, you lose!” Violet Ghost snapped with a contorted face.

“Either way, you’re still going to die!” Zhao Manyan showed no mercy. He threw his fist, covered in armor that weighed around five hundred kilograms, at Violet Ghost’s head.

Violet Ghost tried his best to dodge the attack, knowing he was about to die soon.

Zhao Manyan burst out laughing when he saw Violet Ghost’s reaction. He bet a second or two did not really matter much to Mo Fan. He could just throw another punch at him. This time, he would make sure that the scum’s brains would splatter on the ground and dye it red!

Every scum of the Black Vatican would not have a good ending!
