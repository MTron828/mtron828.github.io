Chapter 2751: Rats, Cats, and Snakes

Mo Fan had stood in front of the Thundercat statue many times. He recognized the face and posture of the Eldest Granny.It seemed as though the ancient statue had come to life. It was like a guardian of the moonless night that was vigilant and hostile to all foreign things. When it looked down at people, its majestic warning sounded in their minds even though it did not open its mouth.

The cry that Mo Fan heard was the same as well. The cry sounded in his mind clearly, and it touched the deepest part of his soul. He got goosebumps all over. The cat’s meow had frightened his very soul.

Mo Fan took a few steps back.

“Meow!”

Eldest Granny’s appearance changed. She was a woman, but she was growing a silver beard. Her chin became pointy, and her ears grew longer.

‘Could this be the secret about how the ancient statues protected Mingwu Ancient City?’ thought Mo Fan.

However, he was not a rat or an insect. So, why did he feel such fear in front of the Thundercat statue? He didn’t even know he feared cats! He felt a terror in the depths of his soul. Was this his natural enemy?

“Mo Fan.” Apas’s voice sounded distant.

Mo Fan felt cold, and he woke up from that terrible feeling. When he focused his mind again, he realized that the Eldest Granny was standing right there. She looked normal. No white beard, her chin was the same, her ears were the normal length…

Was it a hallucination? Or a trick to capture souls?

Mo Fan looked at Apas beside him. She frowned. Her eyes were razor-sharp, and she was leaning forwards, almost baring her fangs. Most snake demons were in this posture when they were in danger.

...

“What happened?” Mo Fan asked.

“It was not a hallucination. I can’t explain it to you clearly. Let me handle this,” Apas said with a solemn look.

Mo Fan’s overall strength had increased, so Apas’s cultivation should be very close to the level she used to have in Egypt. She was the Medusa Queen that could compete with the Queen of Nine Serenities. If she was flustered, then Eldest Granny wasn’t just using parlor tricks. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Mo Fan recalled the fear he felt. He had felt trapped like a rat facing a lethal cat. He shook his head again to dislodge the feeling.

Mingwu Ancient City’s ancient statues seemed to possess a divine power that transcended racial boundaries. Even if he had the protection of Black Dragon Horn Helmet and Dragon Deterrence, he still could not break the suppression caused by his natural enemy.

Apas and Eldest Granny looked at each other, and their pupils changed. Apas’s golden pink snake eyes showed aggression. It showed the ferocity of a snake which was about to attack.

Eldest Granny’s vertical cat eyes were constantly deterring. Sometimes she concentrated on finding flaws, and other times, she slyly and calmly dealt with Apas.

The people of Licheng Afterglow Island were confused. When Eldest Granny and Apas stared at each other, everyone could feel the confrontation of their spiritual power even though they both appeared motionless.

There was no wind at all. Beasts and mountain birds did not make any sound. The mountain villa was inexplicably silent.

Mo Fan and Apas had a telepathic connection. He could feel the intense fight between them. A cat had met a snake.The cat’s movements were sly and swift, while the snake was lithe and ruthless. Both refused to back down.

Suddenly, Eldest Granny doubled over and spat a lot of blood. Other people were shocked. They supported Eldest Granny.

Eldest Granny’s pupils began to dim, and fear appeared in her eyes. She held the wooden cane in one hand and pointed at Apas with the other.

Apas’ golden pink pupils slowly returned to normal. She smiled radiantly but it appeared very cold at the same time.

“What happened?” Mo Fan asked Apas.

“Fortunately, you brought me with you. Otherwise, you would have been ambushed by the group while being suppressed by your natural enemy: the cat. You would have been restricted. It is the power and deterrence of the Thundercat statue, which makes the monsters and demons in the wetlands around the Mingwu Ancient City dare not step into the city itself,” Apas explained to Mo Fan.

“I thought with my Dragon Sense and Dragon Deterrence, there would be very few people who could suppress me mentally.” Mo Fan let out a long sigh. He had almost failed. The Thundercat statue was so powerful.

“This world is big. The dragons are not the only ones of ancient and powerful bloodline. Otherwise, Wan Dragon Valley wouldn’t have the Mound of Dead Beast,” Apas said.

Dragons were ancient and powerful, but the real Medusa might not be afraid of them. Dragons were the most prestigious of races, but only when compared with average spirits.

Tiandi Holy Spirit, the descendant of a supernatural entity, the ancestor of the ancient beast, the thousand-year-old demon vein, the Epic Human King… Which one of them was inferior to the western dragons?

“You’re right. They were known as the two great hidden clans with the Underground Holy Spring, so they must obviously have their trump card,” said Mo Fan, coming to a new understanding.

“You should be careful. Don’t expose too much of your abilities. Don’t forget the Green East Sea God we saw at the cliff edge that day. It is probably the earliest ancient statue the people of Licheng Afterglow Island brought to this island, which has a higher ability than the Thundercat statue. If we fight with it, I might not be able to help you,” Apas said earnestly.

“I push them step-by-step because I want to see the Green East Sea God,” Mo Fan said.

Although Mo Fan was not entirely sure, it probably was the Totem he had been looking for.

If what Apas said was correct, the Green East Sea God was the first ancient statue the people of Licheng Afterglow Island brought back, which caused God’s condemnation. Apas had suppressed the Thundercat statue. It was likely that the Green East Sea God would appear soon.

However, Mo Fan was still very confused. He had thought that despite their holy power the ancient statues were just statues. It was strange that the Thundercat statue had to rely on Eldest Granny through possession. But the last he had seen the Green East Sea God, it had looked very much alive with its own body.

He could only expose Licheng Afterglow Island’s secrets by attacking them.

“Little Flame Belle, you don’t have to hold back anymore,” Mo Fan raised his head and said to the Goddess of Flame Belle that was blazing in the sky.

“Do you think you alone can overturn the entire Licheng Afterglow Island? Having a Great Ruler-level Flame Holy Spirit doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want.” A man in bird-like clothes appeared behind Eldest Granny.

The man was cold and dignified. He looked like an imposing man. He seemed to be in his thirties, but his hair was entirely white. His age didn’t match his body.

“Eldest Grandpa!”

The men and women of Licheng Afterglow Island cried out excitedly, as if he was the savior and hero of Licheng Afterglow Island.
