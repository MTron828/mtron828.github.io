Nanyu quickly told Yassen about Lingling’s plan. Xing Hui, Zhao Kang, and the others immediately cursed.

“Are you kidding? It’s the same as waiting for our deaths!” Zhao Kang spat.

“So you’re saying we should fight them instead?” Kuma challenged him.

Kuma knew Lingling was the ninth team’s brain trust. She believed the girl’s suggestion was viable. If they were frozen in the ice, it would conceal their presence. The Frosty Ancient Eagles also had a habit of freezing living creatures, so they would not be able to tell them apart.

“Either we fight them or pretend to be food. I prefer the latter option,” Yassen agreed.

The Senior Hunter was impressed with the little girl’s imagination, even coming up with the idea of disguising themselves as food under the circumstances.

As for putting up a fight? Were they seriously going to fight the Frosty Ancient Eagles in their nest?

It was no different from a bunch of rats trying to bite an eagle to death in its cave!

The Frosty Ancient Eagles only had to assign a group of their fighters to watch the entrance and the whole alliance would really become food in the cold storage after twenty-four hours! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“We are running short on time. We have to make up our mind!” Nanyu could hear several Frosty Ancient Eagles entering the cave.

“We’ll freeze ourselves then. Who is the strongest Ice Mage among us?” Xing Hui had no choice but to agree with the plan.

Mu Ningxue had already accumulated her Ice Magic. She applied a layer of frost on her team members to make it look more realistic.

There were other Ice Mages in the alliance. They chose to handle the disguise on their own as they did not really trust Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue did not force them. She focused on freezing over her team and the Mailong Private Military Group.

“Speaking of which, if you don’t unfreeze us, does that mean we are all going to die here?” Lu Xiu asked harshly.

It was difficult for people to unfreeze themselves. The cave was a freezer to begin with, so the ice was going to become thicker and harder. Even Ice Mages would be frozen forever if they failed to control the thickness properly.

“You can choose an Ice Mage from a different team,” Mu Ningxue replied calmly.

“You do it, but make it thinner for me. I don’t like the feeling of waiting for my own death,” Lu Xiu said.

Lu Xiu had worked so hard to become a Super Mage, just so he could control his own fate. However, they were like a bunch of rats in the Scar of Tianshan Mountain. They had to pretend to be dead to stay alive.

“Ningxue, they are coming. You better hurry!” Nanyu said urgently.

“Got it.”

There were a lot of people in the group. Mu Ningxue could only freeze one person at a time to ensure her magic was not going to endanger their lives. The ice could not be too strong, yet it had to be thick enough for the disguise to work.

They could now hear the Frosty Ancient Eagles without relying on the Sound Element.

The best perk of having a Sound Mage like Nanyu in the group was the ability to predict emergency situations beforehand, giving them more time to prepare themselves. Otherwise they would have been in a rush to even prepare for a fight when the Frosty Ancient Eagles came into the cave, let alone come up with another plan!

The beating of their wings was getting closer. Only a few Frosty Ancient Eagles had entered the cave to enjoy a meal, but alerting them meant alerting the entire nest. Mu Ningxue was still using her Ice Magic, and still had a team to work on.

“Quick, they are coming!”

“Screw it, I’ll do it myself.” A few Ice Mages used their own magic to freeze themselves.

Mu Ningxue glanced at them and noticed they had done a poor job. They might struggle to unfreeze themselves later!

“Xuexue, don’t worry about them. Just look after yourself,” Mo Fan told her.

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Magic surrounded Mo Fan as soon as he finished the sentence. It wrapped around Mo Fan like clothing before thickening gradually. Mo Fan did not even feel the cold, it was like he was wrapped in a thick coat.

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Magic was not touching their skin. As long as the ice was not touching their skin, their blood would cool at a slower rate. The people inside the ice were able to breathe, too and would not suffer from oxygen deprivation.

This care was the reason why Mu Ningxue had to freeze one person at a time. She had to make sure their blood could circulate properly and there was enough oxygen inside. They would still be fit for battle after they were frozen, instead of turning into a pile of mash after the ice was broken apart.

An impatient Frosty Ancient Eagle ran into the cave. It was obviously very hungry. It kept knocking into the walls as it ran inside.

However, it quickly picked up an unusual presence. It immediately fixed its eyes in Mu Ningxue’s direction.

Mu Ningxue had only applied a layer of frost on herself. The frost was slowly spreading to form a wall between Mu Ningxue and the Frosty Ancient Eagle.

The Frosty Ancient Eagle had a puzzled look. It suddenly moved toward Mu Ningxue, but the frost spread rapidly and formed a thick wall between them. The Frosty Ancient Eagle crashed into the wall and cried out in pain.

The rest of the Frosty Ancient Eagles came into the cave. They screeched in amusement when they saw the Frosty Ancient Eagle bang its head on the wall.

The Frosty Ancient Eagle rose to its feet clumsily. It looked at Mu Ningxue, who was now frozen inside the wall, before regrouping with the other Frosty Ancient Eagles.

The wall did not fully cover Mu Ningxue; there was still a gap on one side. If the Frosty Ancient Eagle was a little smarter, it could have checked the other side and discovered Mu Ningxue’s trick!

Luckily, it was driven away by the mocking cries of its friends. Mu Ningxue quickly filled in the crack and sealed the wall before letting out a relieved sigh.

The wall quickly fogged up under Mu Ningxue’s breathing.

It was extremely cold in the cave. People were already suffering from frostbite. Even Mu Ningxue, who was born with an innate Ice Element, was feeling uneasy, let alone the others. She wondered if they could make it.

“We can only be frozen for an hour. If we don’t unfreeze ourselves in an hour, we’ll be stuck here forever!,” Mu Ningxue murmured.

They could only pray that the Frosty Ancient Eagles would not take more than one hour to choose their meal, like some housewives in a supermarket.
