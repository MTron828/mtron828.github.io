Guo Muzhuang’s condition slowly improved, but it would take a long time for his legs to regrow. After learning there were a lot of Hillmen in the area, Mr. Gao decided to head back to the city with his students and alert the government and army about what was happening.

However, it would take at least half a day to make it back to the other side of Mount Kunyu. Many people were going to die by the time the government reacted to the situation!

“There’s a Giant Purple Linden ahead,” Lingling said to the others.

Mr. Gao did not bring all the students with him. He only brought a few that were quicker, to ensure that they could alert the authorities as soon as possible. As a result, Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan had to take care of the rest.

Mr. Gao was more than willing to leave his students with Mo Fan after seeing the Commander-level Flying Creek Snow Wolf.

“Let’s go and take a look,” Mo Fan said.

It was very likely that there would be other Hunters at the Giant Purple Linden. The group noticed something different as they approached the Giant Purple Linden.

“It seems like there are other Hunters around here,” Liu Xiaojia leaned forward and looked around.

“We’ve already come so deep into the mountain, yet it’s still so easy to stumble into different groups of Hunters. How many Hunters are there on this mountain?” Zhao Manyan wondered.

It was a huge Giant Purple Linden. There was normally more than one demon crest on a Giant Purple Linden. Some mature Giant Purple Lindens would have two to four demon crests. The Giant Purple Lindens they had encountered so far were all above a hundred years old, with tall trunks and deep roots into the ground. This one’s branches were like an enormous umbrella covering a huge area.

Most Giant Purple Lindens had a strong demand for nutrients from the soil, so it was unlikely to see other plants nearby. The place was a spacious clearing that only tenacious weeds could survive in!

There were around fifteen people in the area. They were obviously from two different Hunter Groups. They seemed to be competing for ownership of the Giant Purple Linden.

Colorful lights resembling different Elements from both sides clashed with one another, followed by a fierce wind, rolling waves, and shifting terrains. The force produced by the collisions continuously swept in all directions.

“Both sides are being serious!” a male student exclaimed.

Both sides were mostly using Intermediate Spells. The two groups were pretty strong. The battle had been going on for a while, and each side already had a few injured!

“These people are so dumb,” Lingling said.

“It’s pretty common. Humans die in pursuit of wealth, just like birds die in pursuit of food,” Chen Yi said.

“The Giant Purple Lindens are quite friendly to all creatures, including humans. They won’t really mind humans taking their demon crests, but that doesn’t mean they are harmless. They have their own sense of danger, too. If they are too many humans around, and their spells start to threaten the Giant Purple Linden, it will send out a signal attracting the attention of the demon creatures residing around it. These people still have the mood to be fighting one another; they are going to suffer the consequences soon!” Lingling informed them.

Lingling’s words immediately reminded Mo Fan of the warnings that Elder Wang Dakuo gave the others. He strongly insisted that only one person was allowed to retrieve the demon crests from a Giant Purple Linden, in order to prevent disasters from happening!

As Lingling expected, they soon heard roars of demon creatures coming from different directions. Even the surrounding trees were bending forward at the powerful roars.

The Hunters were busy fighting one another, and were utterly clueless about the approaching danger. Liu Xiaojia was a kind girl. She quickly ran over to warn the Hunters, yet they completely ignored her, unwilling to give up on the demon crests!

“Forget it, it’s none of our business,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was not that interested in their competition. Liu Xiaojia already did her best to warn them. If they still did not want to leave, they would have to bear the consequences themselves!

Mo Fan was definitely not a Buddha. He could not care less about people that wanted to get themselves killed. There were just too many idiots out there, taking into account the huge population of his country!

—

They proceeded in another direction to continue their search for the Hillmen. They soon heard cries of agony coming from the area they had just left.

Zhao Manyan came to a stop. He looked back in the direction of the Giant Purple Linden and harrumphed coldly, “They asked for it!”

“Should...should we head back? They sound like they are in agony!” Liu Xiaojia said softly.

“They are all grown-ups. They should be ready to bear the consequences of the choices they made. We aren’t from the Red Cross.” Mo Fan did not have the intention to turn back.

Lingling came to a stop too. She turned to Mo Fan and asked, “Do you feel their cries sound...”

Mo Fan halted in his tracks and listened carefully. He soon realized the cries sounded like they were being tortured, instead of the cries right before their death. They were cries from deep within one’s soul after being tortured continuously!

“Could it be the Hillmen?” Guan Xixi asked worriedly.

“Damn it, let’s head back!” Mo Fan cursed. He could not help but wonder why he had to keep wiping people’s butts on their behalf.

——

The group hurried back to the Giant Purple Linden. It was the same spacious area. The Giant Purple Linden was still swaying in the wind at the center, but there were lots of ghastly corpses lying where the Hunters were previously fighting!

The place was covered in blood with torn limbs scattered across it. Mo Fan and Chen Yi had witnessed something similar before. It was clearly the work of the brutal Hillmen!

Some of the students began vomiting. They had only heard it from Guo Muzhuang before, but it was ten times scarier and more disgusting when they actually witnessed it in person!

“The rest of them were dragged into the woods!” Lingling followed the trail of blood along the ground and pointed at the trees in another direction.

Mo Fan immediately led the way, running into the woods.

The trees were smeared with blood. As soon as Mo Fan ran into the woods, he immediately saw a tall hairy figure. It was laughing piercingly while jumping around, like it was celebrating a party. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The monster was dragging a Maga with its muscular right hand!

The Maga’s clothes were shredded. The creature was holding her ankles while dragging her across the ground. Fresh blood was pouring out from her stomach, leaving a smeared trail behind on the grass!

The girl had pale skin and alluring curves, but was covered in blood. Even her hair was dyed red by her own blood as she was dragged across the ground.

The girl’s screams echoed in Mo Fan’s ears. Mo Fan completely lost it when he saw the girl’s face twitching in pain, her back was rubbing against the ground and the hollow look in her eyes!

He saw the plea in the girl’s eyes, the look when she saw a glimpse of hope, begging him to save her. Mo Fan had seen the same look many times, yet every time he saw it, his chest would burn with rage!

Mo Fan would not be so mad if the Hillman had killed the girl and dragged her body away. After all, humans were not excluded from the cruelty of nature. However, the girl was clearly still alive, yet her blood and entrails were pouring out continuously as she was being dragged along the ground. Any person would not be able to keep calm after seeing it!

“You son of a b**ch, die!” Mo Fan used Blink to catch up to the Hillman celebrating its victory. Its ugly face was filled with shock when Mo Fan intercepted it. It had clearly never seen a human using such strange magic.

However, the Hillman soon grinned cruelly. It tossed the girl aside while slowly revealing its rock-hard muscles!

“Die!” Mo Fan chuckled. He Cast more than ten lightning bolts, each tens of meters long. The dark lightning bolts sprang forward and punctured multiple parts of the Hillman’s body!

The Hillman tried to dodge them, but Mo Fan was just too good at controlling his magic. The lightning bolts were surprisingly quick, too, with a strong paralyzing effect. The Hillman froze on the spot as the lightning strikes continued to land on it!

“Have a piece of these!” Mo Fan was utterly infuriated. He perfectly controlled the damage of the lightning strikes.

The lightning went inside the creature’s body and destroyed its organs. Mo Fan purposely avoided the vital organs just so the creature could suffer more!

“AHHHH!” The Hillman’s cries of agony were similar to a human’s. Even its soul was in great pain, tortured by Mo Fan’s lightning. It was exactly what Mo Fan wanted!

-You’re cruel? Let’s see who’s crueler!-

Chen Yi caught up to Mo Fan and said, “Mo Fan, forget it, just kill it!”

“Humph, go to Hell!” Mo Fan strengthened his lightning. A strong Lightning Spell with its damage amplified twelvefold sent the Hillman flying over a hundred meters away.

The creature slammed heavily into a tree, turned into scorched meat. Perhaps the Hillman never thought a species as strong as it would be killed so easily by a human!

“Miss, don’t be afraid, I’ll treat your wounds now, hang in there!” Liu Xiaojia quickly went up to the girl.

Her heart was burning with rage when she saw how the girl’s belly had been torn apart. What these Hillmen did was unforgivable!

COMMENT

The girl was feeble and in pain. She looked at Mo Fan gratefully. It was likely that she would do anything just to repay Mo Fan’s kindness. After all, she had already wanted to die when the Hillman was torturing her by dragging her across the ground.
