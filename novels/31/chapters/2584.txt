Chapter 2586: The Evil Saintess

Translated by XephiZ

The other group of Skybound Mages all had pale faces.

The previous group of Skybound Mages had fought Mo Fan after he had received only a single Spring of Darkness. He had now obtained another Spring of Darkness after defeating the first group.

Mo Fan stepped into the tile.

He was still the attacker. However, he did not think these Skybound Mages would have stood a chance against him as a defender, when he could only fight with seventy percent of his strength.

The low-level pieces had the advantage of growing stronger by defeating other pieces.

It did not matter if the Red Spider Lily Queen was weaker than the Saintess of Darkness. They could just raise a piece until it was strong enough to beat the Saintess of Darkness!

—

The battle did not last very long. Mo Fan had eight Elements and Magic Fusion. The increase in his strength was rather terrifying.

After all, The Spring of Darkness had increased his overall strength, not just one Element!

The Skybound Mages lost without any surprises. They did last for a longer time than the first group, as they had learned about Mo Fan’s Elements and abilities after watching the first battle, but it did not make any difference. It only helped them live a little longer.

In the end, they were still food for Mo Fan!

“You have obtained the Spring of Darkness for the third time,” the Lord of Darkness declared.

“Then I guess I should thank you for it,” Mo Fan replied.

The Lord of Darkness was the origin of the Dark Magic, thus Mo Fan was simply speaking the truth.

The Lord of Darkness grinned.

Even though his opponent had set him up multiple times during the game, he was not too fussed about it.

As a matter of fact, he was pleased to see different races and species trying their best to survive in the Dark Plane, when all odds were against them.

It was the law of survival in the Dark Plane. The key was not trying to please the Lord of Darkness, but to beat the other participants in the games!

Next target: The Saintess of Darkness!

Su Lu would be in deep trouble after they took out the Saintess of Darkness!

They would win the match after killing Su Lu. It was time to finish it once and for all.

Mo Fan had not thought he would have a chance to leave the Dark Plane alive at first, but he could not hope for a better ending if they managed to kill Su Lu in the Dark Plane.

The other factions would take over the Asia Magic Association after Su Lu died.

Shao Zheng had encountered a lot of resistance when he proposed his strategy of setting up defenses along the coastlines to the Asia Magic Association. Once Su Lu was dead, the Asia Magic Association would have to reevaluate its relationship with the Chinese.

Su Lu might have dragged them all into Hell, but Mo Fan could not wait to kill him here!

He just had to defeat the Saintess of Darkness. There was no way Su Lu could be allowed to go back to the Asia Magic Association and continue to make trouble!

Mo Fan took a deep breath.

The Saintess of Darkness drifted across the ground in her fluffy dress. Half of her face was hidden under her cape. Only her tall nose and sharp chin, typical traits of a Westerner, were revealed under the hood.

The Lord of Darkness was not stupid. He used his remaining pieces to make sure the Saintess of Darkness was the attacker. That meant Mo Fan’s strength would be reduced by thirty percent!

The Saintess of Darkness was the strongest piece in the match, save for the two kings. She also had the advantage as the attacker. Mo Fan might have received the Spring of Darkness three times, but was it going to make a difference?

It was similar to the case of a Top Seater. Even though a Top Seater was ‘just’ a Super Mage, they normally had set half a foot into the Forbidden Level. Even a group of normal Super Mages was no match for them.

Mo Fan’s strength had increased tremendously after receiving the Spring of Darkness three times, but was he really strong enough to fight the Saintess of Darkness?

The Saintess of Darkness calmly clasped her arms in front of her, like a devout disciple. She did not look as scary as the rumors mentioned.

“Do you know what I’m doing?” the Saintess of Darkness asked of him. Her voice was special, like she had received special education from a young age in manners and decorum.

“Are you praying?” Mo Fan guessed.

“Mm, I’m praying for you,” the Saintess of Darkness, whose name was Yucay, replied.

“Do we know each other?” Mo Fan asked.

“Nope, but I heard you are the one who killed my fourth child. My first three children were like lions in a zoo. The whips and cages have rubbed their natures away. Only he retained his nature, no matter how thick the cages and how sharp the whips were. He was the only one who inherited my will…” Yucay answered.

“The Cold Prince?” Mo Fan was astounded.

The European man had mentioned the Saintess of Darkness was the creator of Evil Faith. That discovery had greatly broken the Lord of Darkness’ rules, so he had sent out an army of Hellish Curse Cerberi to drag her into the Dark Plane.

She had mentioned her ‘fourth child’ out of nowhere. The Cold Prince also had the power of Evil Faith, so it was easy to relate the two.

“What wrong did he do, when everything he did was trying to rescue his mother from this place?” Yucay exclaimed with an eerie and spooky smile.

She was dressed like a Saintess. Her face and temperament were fitting too, but she was giving off an Aura of great evil.

The Cold Prince had colluded with Khufu to open a gate to the Dark Plane. Did he do that to rescue his mother?

It sounded like the myth of the daughter named Shen Xiang, trying to slice Huashan Mountain in half just to save her mother.

Mo Fan thought the Red Cardinals were a bunch of lunatics whose only goal was to destroy the world, but it seemed they too had things they treasured…

“I didn’t kill him. I would like to know how he died too,” Mo Fan admitted.

“I guess some bitch had him killed to lure out the Supreme Pontiff. She treated my child as her pawn, but you were the one who made it possible,” Yucay declared coldly.

“Are you talking about Salan?” Mo Fan was surprised. It sounded like the Saintess of Darkness knew a lot of things, even though she had been imprisoned in the Dark Plane for so many years.

“Do you think I hate that pitiful woman? The Spell of Resurrection is unable to bring people who are dragged into the Dark Plane back to life, so how did she rise from her coffin like nothing even happened…” the Saintess of Darkness said. She seemed to be talking about a different topic.

The Saintess of Darkness was familiar with the things that had happened in the living world, including how Izisha had come back to life!

“Why was I trapped here, while Izisha was allowed to leave?…” the Saintess of Darkness mumbled. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She was no longer talking to Mo Fan. She was simply murmuring to herself, like she was putting the blame on someone else..
