Mo Fan was going to say something, but he knew these people were not going to believe he was the commander even if he tried to convince them.

He followed them to the library. It was a sturdy building that happened to be on a little hill. The seawater had yet to reach its first floor. He could see the whole entrance to the strait through the windows of the library.

From afar, he could see a sea monster every few meters swimming in the gray water, not to mention those that were under the surface.

The sea monsters were heading toward the relatively narrow entrance of the strait from all directions. The density of the sea monsters was quite high at the entrance of the strait, similar to the entrance of a subway during peak times...

The sea monsters would travel for another kilometer after entering the strait before turning to the south to invade the island through the Gaoqi Airport, which was located on the shore opposite Mo Fan. It was just as the student had mentioned before. Jimei University happened to be behind the sea monsters’ entry point. They could inflict a huge number of casualties to the ranks of the sea monsters if they were to attack them from here!

“Are these people all we have?” the director of the Water School said with a frown.

“More students are heading our way, but we don’t really have much fighting power,” Biling admitted.

“If we attack the sea monsters from here, our spells have to cover a distance of a kilometer and a half across the water. Most of our spells won’t have enough range unless the sea monsters are heading right toward us,” a Wind Element teacher spoke up.

“Yeah, even us teachers won’t be able to attack the sea monsters from here, let alone the students.”

More students arrived at the library as the teachers were figuring out a plan.

Mo Fan roughly estimated about fifty people for each primary Element. There were around a hundred people split up among the rest of the Elements, too. There were around four hundred people, but most of them were Intermediate Mages.

If these Intermediate Mages were grouped into formations to attack with the same spell, they could deal a destructive blow to the enemy. They should be able to thin out the army of sea monsters just as they entered the strait.

But they still had the same problem: their range was limited!

The distance was around one and a half kilometers. A Fiery Fist was a spell with rather outstanding range, yet it could only travel up to two hundred meters away. Its damage would drop as it traveled further.

The Thunderbolt’s range was limited too, as the Mages would have to be at a range where they could control where to accumulate their magic to cast the Lightning Spell.

The Wind Mages’ spells had a greater range, but even if they were to stack their Wind Spells up into a huge Wind Disc, it would be impressive if it could cover a distance of merely a kilometer!

Considering the altitude and terrain of the library, if the spells were treated as projectiles, it might help to increase their range, but it still was not enough to solve the problem.

“We can compress the space. If there are Space Mages here, they can compress the path that our spells are traveling in so our attacks could reach the sea monsters,” Biling suggested.

“Miss Biling, why have I never heard of the Space Element being used in such a way before?” the director of the Water School, Deng Yongchuan, spoke up promptly.

Mo Fan too was dumbfounded when he heard the words.

Compressing the space to increase the range of spells, splendid idea...

Either way, Mo Fan could not do it. He knew how to compress the space, but there were many other factors involved still.

“Does someone know how to do that?” Mo Fan asked.

“Leave it to me!” an aged Mage came up to them.

The old Mage had a white beard, and was dressed in plain clothes. Several Mages in similar outfits stood behind him. Mo Fan could sense a familiar aura from them. They were all Space Mages!

Mo Fan’s eyes glittered when he saw them.

“Young man, you must be the commander whom the president has sent here,” the old Mage stopped in front of Mo Fan.

“That’s me,” Mo Fan nodded.

“I was utterly impressed by your courage when you were fighting the two beasts. I’m the director of the Space School of Jimei University, Lin Du. These are my students; they are the Space Mages of this school,” Lin Du said calmly.

“Oh, it’s an honor to meet you all!” Mo Fan had no idea who the person was. He was simply being courteous.

Deng Yongchuan, Biling, the Wind Mage, and the students who had gathered at the library all looked at Mo Fan in astonishment.

Why would the president assign someone who looked just like a student to be the commander?

“You’re the commander?” Deng Yongchuan harrumphed coldly.

“That’s me!” Mo Fan confirmed.

“I seriously don’t believe you are capable of leading us judging from your age. We should be relieved that you aren’t holding us back,” Deng Yongchuan sniffed.

“The Donghai President might be under a lot of pressure trying to command the battle to assign someone like him as the commander. Director Lin Du, you should be in charge instead,” the representative among the students said.

Lin Du frowned. He did not expect these people to be so against the idea of making Mo Fan the commander. He was about to rebuke them when he felt a strong Aura bursting out of the young man’s body. It felt like the library was being targeted by a great thunderstorm. No one dared to breathe when they felt the wild Lightning Magic lingering in the sky.

Lin Du immediately looked at Mo Fan and saw him engulfed in wild lightning. Everyone dropped their jaws when they saw the wild energy around him!

Mo Fan had lost his temper. “I have no time to waste on you arrogant people! If you think I am not worthy to be the commander, I shall deal with the sea monsters myself while the rest of you continue to waste your time deciding who’s the commander!”

He was seriously left speechless by these arrogant pricks! Lin Du had already told them he was the commander, yet they were still doubting him, forcing him to control the situation with his Domain. Wouldn’t it be better if he used the Domain against the sea monsters instead?

“Young man, please don’t be mad. They just didn’t expect you to be a Super Lightning Mage at such a young age... Fellow directors and teachers, this young man’s courage and strength are outstanding. He was the one who Sealed off the Number One Disastrous Beast’s bone whip with his Super Lightning Spell!” Lin Du announced.

Lin Du was a Super Mage too. He was at the scene when it all happened. He had witnessed how Mo Fan Sealed off Qiu Chi’s bone whip in person!
