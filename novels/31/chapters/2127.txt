Mo Fan had no idea what was inside the box, but it was definitely something evil if he felt such a strong chill from it after a single touch!

Were those guys Hunters? They did not look like Hunters at all. Crete might have a lot of annoying members of the Black Church, but Hunters would rarely choose such a remote place.

Normally, only those with fishy business or young people holding some wild parties would choose this place!

The group of people was not suspicious of Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai. It was not rare to see students from China working part-time in Europe, especially at a little inn like this.

To the south of Crete was a small island with a lot of coconuts.

The island was about three hundred kilometers from Africa. It had plenty of sunlight, and the coconut trees with orange glitters to them were scattered across the island.

The island was not very big, only around five kilometers long. Its sandy white beach was often covered when the tide rose.

“Did you notice it?” Jiang Bin, a Golden Sun Knight asked.

“Of course, are you doubting us Tuis’ capabilities?” Tuis responded with a displeased expression. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

For some reason, Tuis was extremely uncomfortable when he saw Asians. The captain of the Golden Sun Knights who was assigned to assist Tuis happened to be an Asian. Regardless of his nationality and identity, Tuis felt like Asians’ facial features were incomparable to Europeans. They looked like like a bunch of monkeys who had yet to evolve.

“I didn’t mean that. I will set up the perimeter,” Jiang Bin replied.

The Orange Coconut Island had a village on it, and was secluded from the world. Not a single person in the village was aware of the shocking incident in Crete. They continued on with their lives as they waited for the coconuts to ripen.

Jiang Bin frowned when he saw the villagers had not taken shelter at Jade Bay City.

“Who’s in charge of this area? Don’t they know the Tyrant Titan might show up at any second?”

“I’ve already asked the officials. They did send out the notice to evacuate the area, but this village wasn’t willing to evacuate for some reason. Perhaps they did not realize how dangerous the Tyrant Titans are,” a Silver Moon Tyrant Knight reported.

“Stay with Master Tuis, I’ll go check it out,” Jiang Bin said irritably.

The local officials were getting even more unreliable. They must have realized how dangerous Crete was, so they had long fled to a safer city inland!

Jiang Bin followed the meandering path to the village. There was no road for vehicles. Motorcycles and scooters were the only modern transportation. The path was muddy, as it had rained recently.

The village was very primitive. However, there were many places similar to this village in the countries around the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the younger generation had moved to cities. A primitive village that relied on growing fruit and was surrounded by the sea like this was considered abandoned.

“Old man, didn’t anyone tell you all to pack your things and take shelter in Jade Bay City? Crete is currently on alert. Your village isn’t safe,” Jiang Bin asked an old man who was peeling coconuts under a tree.

The old man did not seem to understand Jiang Bin. He had no choice but to explain it roughly in Greek, but the old man still did not understand him.

Jiang Bin was helpless. He went further into the village and noticed the evacuation notice was already attached to the board at the entrance. The instructions were quite clear .

He visited a few households and noticed only older people above the age of fifty were left in the village. Jiang Bin finally found someone who understood English, but he was not from the village. He had only come to collect the coconuts!

“Huh? There’s a notice to evacuate the village?” the man called Daven, who was in his fifties, repeated curiously.

“It’s at the entrance... who’s in charge here? Shouldn’t they have made sure the village was evacuated first? Why did they only hang up the notice?” Jiang Bin demanded.

“I’m sorry, there aren’t many people in this village who can read, nor do they understand Greek. I only came here to collect the coconuts and sell them at Jade Bay City...” Daven answered.

“Didn’t you hear what happened ?” Jiang Bin asked with a confused face. How were they not informed, when it was so easy to spread news now?

“It’s been a month since I last paid my bills. People like us can live without smartphones or computers,” Daven replied carelessly.

“Hurry up and tell the others in the village. Master Tuis is an expert on the Tyrant Titans. He has sensed an unusual aura around here!” Jiang Bin told Daven.

“Alright, I’ll tell them. Hopefully, they can still understand me right,” Daven nodded. He finally realized it was something serious.

Daven picked up his walking staff and went to every household. Jiang Bin could only put on a wry smile as he watched the man leave.

The whole area must have forgotten about these elders!

An hour later, Daven had finally gathered everyone in the village. Jiang Bin was left speechless when he saw some of them carrying so much luggage.

“Captain, the military says they can’t send a helicopter to this island. We need to think of some other way to move them,” a Blue Star Knight who was in charge of communication reported to him.

“Those assh****, do they not realize there’s a village here?” Jiang Bin snapped.

“Captain, Master Tuis is asking for you. He says the Tyrant Titans might show up soon. He needs your assistance in the fight,” the Blue Star Knight relayed.

“We still haven’t evacuated the villagers. We can’t turn this place into a battlefield... go to the town and ask them to send a boat to take these elderly to safety,” Jiang Bin said.

“Captain Jiang, the officials in the town have already left for Jade Bay City.”

“Then find me a Summoner, quick!”
