The Demoness was agitated!

She had set up a plan to kill the incredibly powerful Fiery Sorceress, while both Zhao Yulin and Shi Gua were unable to break free from her control. She initially thought the rest of the weaklings would run for their lives. To her surprise, they had teamed up against her instead.

“Who do you think you are!?” screamed the Demoness. The cloth on her face was ripped apart as the force she exerted was too strong...

The white cloth fell to the ground, revealing a face that had changed beyond recognition. Her scorched facial features were eerily melted together; it was the face of a monster.

However, regardless of how ugly, disgusting, and miserable she had become, no one would show her any compassion, as inside the disgusting body lay an even more corrupt heart that was fully rotten!

“Her third Element was Earth, watch out for her eyes!”Nanyu reminded them immediately.

The Demoness used to be an infamous criminal around Dunhuang region. Many Magicians had died at her hands, including the military instructor whom Nanyu respected the most, so she already knew the Demoness’ Elements.

The Demoness was already diverting her attention to handle two sides. She was using her Curse Element to control Zhao Yulin, and her Psychic Element to control the eight Magicians to handle Shi Gua. The only Element left was the Earth Element.

The Earth Element did not have many destructive Spells. The Basic Spell was Earth Element, the Intermediate Spell was Rock Barrier. One was used for movement, while the other was for defense. However, the Advanced Spell Petrify was an absolutely terrifying killing Spell!

The only ones left that were still able to battle were the young Intermediate Magicians. Petrify was extremely deadly to them. Once they were turned into statues, they would not be able to preserve their lives.

As Nanyu predicted, the Demoness jumped onto the burning debris in another direction. The brown Star Patterns were forming a three-dimensional structure surrounding the Demoness. As each of the Stars and their orbits began to emit a tremendous glow, the Demoness’ eyes had turned into the terrifying eyes of Medusa!

Eyes of Medusa, able to turn anyone staring into them into lifeless statues!

The Demoness’ Petrify was fired in an arc. The group could see a layer of gray-white shadow spreading in their direction rapidly. Both the wooden debris on the ground and the water sprinkling out from the fountain was completely turned into stone, including the water drops!

The force of Petrify spread rapidly, aiming to turn Mo Fan, Xinxia and Zhao Manyan into lifeless statues. The gray-white shadow was less than a hundred meters away.

“Stand behind me!” Zhao Manyan stepped in front of Mo Fan and Xinxia.

A golden glow burst out freely. Zhao Manyan adeptly controlled the light to form a barrier in front of him.

The golden barrier stood in front of the group. As the shadow of Petrify made contact with the barrier, the glowing transparent wall shuddered vigorously, its light dimming...

Although the force of Petrify was showing some sign of slowing down, the Light Protection: Rampart was not enough to resist the Advanced Spell. It was on the verge of collapsing!

Zhao Manyan knew the Light Protection: Rampart alone was unable to finish the job. He immediately summoned his precious Shield Equipment.

As soon as the light wall disappeared, the Shield Equipment replaced it. The arc-shaped energy had already extinguished the fire in their surroundings. The debris scattering across the ground was dyed gray-white. Their spot was the only place unaffected!

“Departing Nether Shield!”

Mo Fan immediately summoned his Shield Equipment when he saw Zhao Manyan in a pinch.

The two shields barely stopped the Petrify from advancing forward. However, the two valuable shields had also turned into solid rocks. The slightest force would shatter them into pieces.

“Water Barrier: Circulation!”

Zhao Manyan cast a defensive Water Spell, trying to stop the claw of the Petrify from extending any further. His forehead was covered in sweat, clearly showing the great effort he was putting in to hold his ground!

“Rock Barrier!”

Zhang Xiaohou set up his defense too, knowing that they were still in danger.

“Ice Lock!”

“Ice Lock!”

At the same time, the voices of a man and a woman appeared from the other side. A few thick ice chains lunged in their direction to protect them, clanking noisily to protect them!

“You guys...” Zhao Manyan glanced at Mu Xiu and Mu Tingle with joy when he saw the ice chains.

Mu Xiu was proud and arrogant. He and Zhao Manyan were descendants of their respective renowned families, and were not fond of one another. Despite that, the doings of the Demoness raised their hackles. They could not stand it any longer.

“You guys have no chance against an Advanced Magician, but it will be a different story with our help,” said Mu Xiu with a cold harrumph.

“Shit, will you die if you stop acting so cocky? Your Ice Element is effective against her Earth Element, do it quick!” cursed Zhao Manyan.

The defense of the Earth Element was able to resist most of the destructive Spells, including the imperious Lightning Element, yet it was fairly ineffective against the penetrating frost of Ice Element Spells, as the frost would freeze the rocks, too!

The brother and sister of Mu Clan cast Ice Spread simultaneously. Both of them had Ice Seeds, thus when the frost descended upon the place and produced a crackling noise, the power of the Petrify clearly diminished...

The Demoness’ face shuddered when she saw that even the two kids from the Mu Clan were challenging her!

“Very well, I’ll dip the Fire Calamity Fruit in your blood before eating it!” The Demoness’ voice was screechy, and due to her Psychic Element, it felt like a ghost was screaming right into their ears!

The young Magicians immediately covered their ears when they heard the cry.

However, the cry was not just a normal sound, but a curse implanted in their souls. Even the deaf could not stop themselves from hearing the scream.

“It’s fear... bear with me for a second,” reminded Xinxia when she realized that the Demoness had cast another Psychic Spell on the group. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Without the threat from Psychic Element, Xinxia was able to draw her Star Patterns with ease. As the seven Stars aligned together, the channeling of her Psychic Spell was completed.

“Spirit Ripple: Pacify!”

The Basic Psychic Spell, Spirit Ripple!

The ripple with calming effect slowly filled the disturbed hearts of the group. They were unable to focus to cast the Spells due to the ghastly cries in their hearts, but the soothing ripple was like a sacred melody, cleansing the demons in their hearts, including the strange fear they were experiencing.

“You dare mess it up, you little bitch!” screamed the Demoness when she saw that her Psychic Spell was nullified by Xinxia once again, her eyes full of hatred.
