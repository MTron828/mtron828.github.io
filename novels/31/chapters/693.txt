“What do we do now?” whispered Su Xiaoluo.

It took them great effort to come this far, yet to their surprise, Fang Gu had turned into something like this. He never had the intention to stop the calamity, or maybe he was wicked beyond redemption from the beginning. He was evil all along!

“Blood, I need more blood,” Fang Gu’s eyes suddenly became hollow, as if the pupils were dug out. It felt like a ghost could come out from the sockets at any time!

He rose to his feet. His movements seemed sluggish and stiff, yet his body was unleashing a wild stench of blood. His open mouth implied that he was planning to eat them alive.

“He is turning into a zombie!” Liu Ru swiftly backed off, dragging the other two with her.

At the start, Fang Gu still had a faint human presence. From his words, it seemed like he still retained some of his memory, yet his smell now completely resembled that of a zombie.

He was no longer a living human, but a monster who had rotted away after staying in the tomb for many years. Even his soul had turned into a greedy phantom!

Fang Gu was dead, even his soul was replaced. All that was left was an empty shell that was no different than the zombies outside the tomb.

Fang Gu, still in the battle robe lunged forward, clenching his hands into long claws with blue nails. Su Xiaoluo was his first target.

Fresh blood, more fresh blood was needed! In order to resurrect the Ancient King, more blood of his descendants was needed! The blood of Ancient King in the pure-blooded descendant, Su Xiaoluo was exactly what he needed...

“He still hasn’t acquired the Ancient King’s true power, kill him!” said Liu Ru.

Fang Gu’s aura was extremely evil, but it was not as overwhelming as they had imagined. Perhaps his body and soul were not what the Ancient King really wanted, so he had turned into a zombie-like puppet!

Turning a living human into a zombie was an extremely terrifying Black Magic. When Liu Ru saw Fang Gu lunging at Su Xiaoluo, she immediately grabbed the zombified mage and slammed him to the ground.

Liu Ru’s hands turned into claws, too. She did not show any mercy. She stabbed the sharp claws of the Blood Tribe right into Fang Gu’s heart.

Initially, Liu Ru thought the battle robe had a strong defense. It was unlikely that her attack would inflict any damage to him. To her surprise, her claws easily penetrated the armor and came into contact with Fang Gu’s rotting flesh, piercing through his heart with ease.

The heart inside had already stopped beating, black liquid leaked out from the cut. Liu Ru immediately withdrew her hand and stared at Fang Gu with a confused look.

How weak!

This Fang Gu was extremely weak!

The strength and defense he acquired after turning into a zombie were only comparable to a Servant-class zombie. When Liu Ru saw Fang Gu fall to the ground twitching with a ghastly appearance, she somehow felt pity for him.

Inheriting the Ancient King’s magic, gaining control of the kingdom of undead?

He did not even realize that his life was drained away by the battle robe until only an empty shell was left. Even his soul was gone.

He was a real sacrifice for the Ancient King’s resurrection, one among many over the last two thousand years.

Fang Gu’s black blood flowed out from his body, which gradually separated from the battle robe. A dried corpse fell to the ground.. even his hair had wilted like grass.

Meanwhile, the black battle robe floated back to the Blood Emperor Throne after absorbing Fang Gu’s life force.

Although no one was wearing the armor, it felt like someone alive was sitting in it, with a pair of crimson eyes under the cape staring right deep into their souls, able to see everything in their hearts.

“We shouldn’t put on the robe...” Liu Ru breathed out.

It turned out that the threat was not Fang Gu, who was wearing the battle robe, but the battle robe with the evil aura itself!

While the three were clueless about what to do, the altar suddenly shook.

The black space began to twist, spiral, and bend at times, with gaps appearing out of nowhere. A strong wind was sweeping down from above them.

Zhang Xiaohou raised his head and saw a huge black cloud made of zombies above him. They were flying around like a tornado while uttering groans and cries of agony.

“The altar is rotating... does this mean the Dark Abyss is about to shift in space soon?” asked Liu Ru.

Taking the time into consideration, dawn had already arrived. It was the last time the Dark Abyss would shift to somewhere else. Since the Ancient King was planning to resurrect himself, the inner city was the most ideal place to go. Since he had become the highest ruler of the kingdom of undead, he would surely not allow a living human to stay in his kingdom!

“Blood, Fang Gu was mentioning something about blood, does that mean the Ancient King’s resurrection requires a huge amount of blood? Is he trying to turn the people in the inner city into sacrifices?” blurted out Su Xiaoluo as she thought of something.

If the millions of people fell into the Dark Abyss, it would not just produce a pond of blood. It would be a sea of blood; everyone there would be turned into a sacrifice!

The Black Vatican must have learned the secret somehow and found a way to control the space shift of the Dark Abyss.

Instead of describing the calamity as a Festival of Death, it was more correct to say that they were planning to resurrect the ancestor of the undead, who had died over two thousand years ago, all along!

The altar was shaking. The group could no longer stand easily.

“What do we do now? We’re out of time!” Liu Ru’s mind went blank.

Zhang Xiaohou climbed to his feet and glared at the strange battle robe on the throne.

He had bitten his lips open. Zhang Xiaohou struggled to his feet and cast Wind Track to run to the battle robe on the throne.

“Don’t, don’t do it, you’re going to end up like Fang Gu!” screamed Su Xiaoluo, who knew what Zhang Xiaohou was thinking.

“We don’t have much time left to think about that!” Zhang Xiaohou had no time to think. The place was shifting rapidly, they could not afford to waste a second more.

Rushing up to the battle robe, Zhang Xiaohou immediately sensed a great power urging him to wear the battle robe. It felt like he could resolve everything once he put on the battle robe!

He turned around, looking at Su Xiaoluo, as if he was trying to remember her face. In the following second, Zhang Xiaohou grabbed the battle robe.

The battle robe was able to attach itself to a body. When someone touched it, it would reform and swiftly attach to the person’s body.

Zhang Xiaohou was slightly regretful when he made the decision. The thing was like a demon with its mouth wide open, waiting for him to fall into its mouth...

Being regretful would not change anything. Zhang Xiaohou closed his eyes. He was only hoping that he had the chance to command the undead army before turning into a dried corpse like Fang Gu, even if it only lasted for an instant.

However, when the battle robe was about to wrap around Zhang Xiaohou, a powerful hand grabbed him and tossed him away from the Blood Emperor Throne!

Zhang Xiaohou was thrown away. When he was spinning in the air, he saw a firm back!

He was extremely familiar with the person’s back. When he first joined the Battlemages, it was this man, who was capable of fighting the Darkwing Wolf alone, that astonished him...

Zhang Xiaohou fell to the ground. He yelled at the top of his lungs as his eyes began to tear, “Chief Military Instructor!”
