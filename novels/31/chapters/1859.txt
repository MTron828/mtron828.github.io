The Moon-Devouring White Wolves ran to the edge of the town, following the strong wind blowing down from the top of the mountain. The place was literally a junkyard full of rusted trucks and piles of plastic, rocks, and tins. The fierce wind blowing from the town soon swept the junk into the air.

“Damn it!” Zhao Manyan pulled a white plastic lunchbox off his face and grunted, “That assh*** didn’t even build emergency shelters for the town. There’s no way the people can run away!”

“We can only kill as many of the creatures as we can.” Mo Fan stood still and looked up at the Manta Ray Evil Birds that were looming over the town. He was prepared to fight an intense battle.

He had been greatly restricted when they were fighting on the ocean, feeling extremely uncomfortable in the previous battle. However, he was no longer afraid of them now that he was on land!

“Fiery Swamp!”

Mo Fan slammed his fist on the ground. The flames instantly spread into a burning swamp filled with lava.

“Rising Dragons!”

He threw a fist into the air. A long fiery dragon danced in the air before heading toward the black cloud.

The fiery dragon kept sparking against the air during the flight, producing a stronger flame to enlarge and strengthen its body!

The flames flickered brightly, but the storm of demon birds easily blocked them off. When the fiery dragon reached the storm, its blazing red light slowly dissipated as if it had entered a bottomless abyss. The storm showed no sign of weakening, even when the flames were gone. The fiery dragon was devoured by the demon birds just like that!

Zhao Manyan gasped at the sight.

Mo Fan’s destructive spell was only like a pebble being thrown into a lake. It did not even produce the slightest ripple. It was ridiculous to think the two of them could stop the army of demon birds!

The cacophony that could drive anyone mad was getting closer. The Manta Ray Evil Birds were vengeful creatures. They immediately turned into a hurricane, pouncing at Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan after Mo Fan attacked them. The sky above them and their surroundings were filled with jagged wings and triangular heads. After taking a closer look, Mo Fan realized these Manta Ray Evil Birds had not inherited the Bird Emperor’s cool appearance. They were as twisted and ugly as bats. Their eye sockets were extremely deep, and the glitter in their eyes was a symbol of cunning, viciousness, and greed!

“Don’t use Light Magic,” Mo Fan reminded Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan lowered his gaze and noticed faint hints of dark energy spreading across the ground.

“Alright, I’ll use the Earth Element,” Zhao Manyan nodded.

“Gather the Earth Magic toward us,” Mo Fan said.

Zhao Manyan stayed around five meters behind Mo Fan. His control of the Earth Element was quite outstanding. The sturdy ground suddenly softened. As Zhao Manyan shoved his hand forward, huge pulses surfaced on the ground, forming several dunes in the area.

“Rock Fang!”

Mo Fan cast an Earth Spell while Zhao Manyan was modifying the terrain. The condition of the soil and the terrain were helping Mo Fan bury countless traps underground. He just needed to unleash his Earth Magic to activate the spikes!

Sharp rock spears poked slowly out of the ground. The bigger Rock Fangs were the size of stalactites, while the smaller ones were comparable to wooden spikes. They were shooting out of the irregular terrain from different angles and piercing the Manta Ray Evil Birds that had flown too close to the ground. Their blood splattered on the rocks. Some of the shooting Fangs even went through more than one Lesser Featherless Bird!

“Rock Shark on the Hunt!”

The Rock Fangs soon turned into sprinkles falling to the ground, but Mo Fan was extremely quick at using his magic. He established a Domain with the Earth Energy that Zhao Manyan had accumulated, and several figures started moving rapidly underground. They were like sharks waiting to strike their prey at the right time under the waves. The Rock Sharks burst out of the ground and snapped at the Manta Ray Evil Birds as they were flying toward Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan!

The remains of the Manta Ray Evil Birds scattered in the air. The fierce Rock Sharks fell back into the ground, searching for their next prey. Mo Fan had Summoned at least seven of the Rock Sharks around him. They were patrolling underground while watching the Manta Ray Evil Birds who were trying to ambush Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

“That’s impressive, where did you learn it?” Zhao Manyan was impressed by how creative Mo Fan was at using the Earth Spell.

“I saw it used by Vani, that intern mentor from the European University Institute. He was even more impressive, he could Summon a whale. My little sharks can only keep an eye on the creatures for us... keep the Domain going so my sharks can last a little longer. It should ease your burden,” Mo Fan told Zhao Manyan.

“Not a problem!” Zhao Manyan said. “Is your lightning ready? I’m struggling to hold on since I can’t use my Light Element!”

“I’m ready!” Mo Fan nodded. His right hand was still controlling lightning. “These scum are about to enjoy the dance of my claws!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The dark aura was still spreading as the restless Lightning Magic in the form of tiny sparkles slowly accumulated, and abruptly turned into terrifying claws tearing across the junkyard at the edge of the town!

The dance was obviously made up of more than one lightning claw. More dark lightning claws appeared and swept across the place with a wild and overwhelming force, turning every Manta Ray Evil Bird they came upon to ashes. They fell to the ground and scattered all over the junkyard.
