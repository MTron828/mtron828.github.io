Chapter 2896: The Barrier Plan

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The evacuation location was Ding City.

Ding City was constructed with the purpose of becoming the Elemental Capital. It was part of the plan to designate it as the Magic City’s evacuation destination.

After the citizens had successfully evacuated from the Magic City, the Mages left, too. However, the process of evacuation was challenging. The people were scattered in various areas. Many of them were trapped within the ruins. Most of them were blocked by the Ocean Demons, thus they were trapped inside the refuge.

Even though the white meteor had sent the signal to all the Mages to evacuate the city, many stayed behind to help those who were still trapped.

Mo Fan could maintain his demon form for a while longer. When he fought the Cold Moon Demon Lord, the ice recoil had severely wounded him. Mo Fan had absorbed the ley lines lava, but he could not completely recover due to the cold impact he suffered from the Cold Moon Demon Lord.

Fortunately, staying in demon form had strengthened him. He had a stronger life force. After reaching the Magic City, Mo Fan gathered the five great totem beasts and stalled for time for those who had not been able to leave the city.

It was already dark when Chief Zhu found him.

“Where’s Councilman Gu?” Mo Fan did not see the powerful Forbidden Mage.

“He wounded the Ocean Queen, but it killed him,” said Chief Zhu.

Mo Fan took a deep breath.

This was not his first time receiving the news of death in the battle. The Forbidden Curse Association had suffered great losses in the war.

“If we could have foreseen this and evacuated earlier…,” mumbled Mo Fan.

Chief Zhu shook his head. “The Ocean Demons are too strong. If we don’t stop them, they won’t just harm the Magic City, they will move to the entire country.”

The war was inevitable. They were destined to pay a heavy price in exchange for temporary peace for the coastlines across the country.

The preparation for war was hasty. However, the coastline along China was considered well-preserved compared to other countries near the Pacific Ocean.

Mo Fan had been to the Andeas. He was aware that certain countries had fallen apart due to the Ocean Demons. The countries were at war. Many people were killed. So many lives lost. They had failed to unite to fight the Ocean Demons.

The Magic City had been defeated. But after a few years, when the people regained their strength, they would take it back. They wouldn’t leave an ounce of land for the greedy Ocean Demons.

“Leave with your totem beasts now! We can’t afford to suffer any more losses. Besides, the Magic City Barrier Plan has started. When the time comes, the Forbidden Curse Association will need you and the totem beasts to destroy the Ocean Demon Empire within the Magic City ruins,” said Chief Zhu to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan nodded.

“Thank you for everything you did for the Magic City,” Chief Zhu said with sincerity.

Mo Fan vividly remembered the first time he visited the Eastern Mage Tower to awaken his Third and Fourth Elements. At that time, he was astounded by the Eastern Mage Tower’s splendor.

Chief Zhu was the leader of the Eastern Mages. He represented the apex of the Magic Association.

Mo Fan was touched with his words. “Please, don’t mention it. I’ve been staying here and attending school ever since Bo City was destroyed. This is my second home.”

Chief Zhu was stunned. “Thank you for not letting us down. The Magic Association surely knew what it was doing when bringing you up!”

Mo Fan smiled.

Chief Zhu also smiled. A long-awaited smile…

…

Meanwhile, no one knew where the Cold Moon Demon Lord had disappeared. Mo Fan thought it would be furious because of the humiliation it endured.

Mo Fan and the Azure Dragon had their hands on its Eye of the Tide. But if they had kept the Eye of the Tide to themselves, the Cold Moon Demon Lord would have surely taken it back by all means.

The Azure Dragon had tried to destroy the Eye of the Tide. But the Eye of the Tide was a sacred object. It was indestructible.

The Azure Dragon had no choice but to throw the Eye of the Tide to another ruler that might possess its power and force the Cold Moon Demon Lord to leave the city. By doing so, the Azure Dragon had saved the Mages in the Magic City. Thankfully, the outcome turned out to be worth it.

They hoped that after the ruler in the Pacific Ocean gained the Eye of the Tide, it would become the Cold Moon Demon Lord’s rival. Once the Pacific Ocean was split into two Ocean Demon camps, the Cold Moon Demon Lord would not dare to invade the coasts.

Humans needed more time to make plans. They especially needed time to consider the relocation and evacuation of their people. No matter what, they had to prepare for everything.

When the Ocean Demon army gushed in and the base city failed to hold them back, they had considered transferring the people to China.

They needed sufficient time to make plans.

They needed to make various arrangements when moving so many people from one place to another. They had to clear the roads, provide escorts, and stock up on supplies.

They also needed to give the army more time to open up the wasteland and build a city there.

…

At Ding City…

Bone-chilling coldness filled the air. The clouds condensed in the sky above and made the elemental capital made up of rocks look even colder.

It was day four since they evacuated the Magic City.

The Magic City Barrier Plan had started. Before Chairman Shao Zheng was transferred away, the Barrier Plan was one of the strategies deployed in the event that several base cities were defeated.

In order to prevent the base city from turning into the Ocean Demon’s paradise, after the people evacuated the city, the underground refuge was connected to form a steel barrier under the city. This could serve as a stronghold to locate the Ocean Demons at any time.

The Magic City was occupied by several powerful Emperor-level Ocean Demons. However, the powerful Ocean Demon army could not possibly stay in the Magic City all the time.

They would take back the Magic City someday.

The steel barrier under the Magic City was an important stronghold in their plans to take back the city in the future.

After they took back the city, various magic organizations would assign the Mages to the city and rescue the people who were trapped inside. They would slowly kill all the troublesome Ocean Demons. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The steel barrier stronghold plan was a strategy for a long-term battle.

…

“It’s so cold. When will the bloody weather clear up?!”

People walked on the streets in Ding City. Many people had moved to Ding City. It was certainly crowded.

Fortunately, everything was in order. The citizens in the Magic City had experienced Black Alert, so they cherished the peace they currently had.

“I heard that the World’s Magic Organization gathered experts to fight the Extreme South Emperor. I wonder how the situation is. If they can change the cold weather, we don’t have to suffer so much.” The patrol officers chatted as they gathered around a communal fireplace to keep warm.
