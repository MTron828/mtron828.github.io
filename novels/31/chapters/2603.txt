Lingling did not say a word. She kept staring at Mo Fan. Mo Fan felt uneasy. He could only smile at her.

In the end, Lingling stomped on Mo Fan’s foot and sat beside him like she had finally vented her anger. She folded her arms in front of her with a cold harrumph at him.

“Here, let’s give Mo Fan a toast for making it back alive!” Zhao Manyan raised his cup and did Mo Fan a favor by alleviating the awkward atmosphere.

Everyone raised their cups for the toast.

“Sir, it’s great to see you here!” Bai Hongfei’s voice came from behind Mo fan.

Bai Hongfei was dressed in a suit with a red bow tie. Mo Fan blurted out as soon as he saw Bai Hongfei, “Bai Hongfei, are you here to snatch the bride? Why are you dressed like the groom? Won’t Dongfang Lie have anything to say about it?”

Mo Fan’s words left Bai Hongfei speechless. Everyone else looked at Mo Fan like he was retarded.

Mo Fan was puzzled. Did he say something wrong?

“Mo Fan, do you seriously not find out who the groom is before coming to the wedding?” Zhao Manyan raised his thumb at Mo Fan. Mo Fan was such a genius!

What did he mean by saying the man was dressed like a groom? Bai Hongfei was the groom!

“Hehe, he has always been so humorous,” Bai Hongfei smiled wryly.

Mo Fan looked at the screen in front of the hall. He finally noticed the groom’s name was Bai Hongfei!

Bai Hongfei and Mui Nuxin are getting married?

Hang on, didn’t the Mui Clan plan to set up a marriage with the Dongfang Clan? Mui Nuxin was supposed to be engaged to Dongfang Lie!

Did I miss out on something interesting?

“Mui Nuxin has long broken up with Dongfang Lie. Initially, the planned marriage was meant to help the two clans fend off the Mu Clan together. The Mui Clan now has great power and reputation. It’s the second wealthiest clan, after my family, in the Magic City. Mui Nuxin was quickly no longer interested in Dongfang Lie, Zhao Manyan whispered into Mo Fan’s ear.

“Is she that pragmatic? Mo Fan raised his eyebrows.

“Sir, don’t you worry, Mui Nuxin is still devoted to her career,” Bai Hongfei said confidently

It seemed like Bai Hongfei had done a good job taming his wife, or he would not have brought the topic up so casually.

“I’m not worried about you. I’m happy for you. Mui Nuxin is a nice woman. It would have been a pity if she had ended up with Dongfang Lie. You two are the perfect match!” Mo Fan patted Bai Hongfei on the shoulder reassuringly. He was being very honest. Young people could change very quickly. Many who got married had even gotten a divorce the very next day. Mo Fan was not too fussed about it. At first, Mui Nuxin was only engaged to Dongfang Lie to help her clan. Now that the Mui Clan had gone on ahead of them, the verbal promise and agreement of the elders did not count anymore.

“Mo Fan… I’m still here,” a voice spoke up from a nearby table.

Mo Fan looked in the direction of the voice and realized the person was Dongfang Lie. The atmosphere suddenly felt weird.

Dongfang Lie’s face was twisted. It was all in the past, and he had even come to give Bai Hongfei and Mui Nuxin his blessing, yet Mo Fan who had lagged a year behind had to bring it up and apply salt to his wounds.

“My bad, I’m sorry for pointing out the truth,” Mo Fan said.

The engagement was terminated before Dongfang Lie even had the chance to hold Mui Nuxin’s hands. However, the Dongfang Clan, Mui Clan, and Bai Clan had maintained good relationships between them.

Mo Fan looked around the hall again. No wonder there were so many people from Fanxue Mountain!

It turned out to be a marriage between a member of Fanxue Mountain and the Mui Clan, yet he acted like he was just a normal guest of the wedding, when he was actually the host!

“Sir, you should say a few words later. I thought you were going to be absent, but you came back just in time. You are truly the role model of every man!” Bai Hongfei kept complimenting Mo Fan. The groom was obviously in a great mood.

“Congratulations, I just came back, so I had no idea it was your great day. I didn’t even get to prepare a gift for you..”Mo Fan scratched his head. Mo Fan was not particularly close with Mui Nuxin, so he had only prepared a red packet for her. He basically came to see his friends. However, it was different now that he realized Bai Hongfei was the groom!

He was one of the students Mo Fan had mentored. He had also helped Fanxue Mountain a great deal for many years. Mo Fan felt bad for not preparing a gift for him.

However, Mo Fan did not really have anything suitable for Bai Hongfei with him. He felt quite embarrassed.

“T’ll let you all talk first. I’ll be back later,” Bai Hongfei heard someone calling for him. He filled Mo Fan’s cup with wine before taking his leave.

Mo Fan exclaimed, “Who would have thought they would end up together… So, did I miss any other important events while I was away?”

Mo Fan was gone for a whole year. A lot of things had changed in that year. Mo Fan immediately looked at the others. He wanted to know who else had married while he was away, Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Does my dog giving birth for the second time count? Zhao Manyan asked.

“It only counts if the child is yours.”

“Go to Hell.”

Mo Fan looked around the hall, but he did not see Mu Ningxue. He had missed her a lot, but she did not seem to be around

Xinxia pointed at a closed door and said, “She’s in that room. Should we go see her?

“Sure.” Several elders of the Bai Clan were seated at the table in the room. They had grim looks on their faces.

Mui Shan and Mui Ye were furious. Mui Ye’s hand was red after he slammed it on the table.

Mu Ningxue was also sitting there quietly.

Shao Yu was standing beside her. She looked across the table and snarled, “The Mu Clan is purposely messing with the wedding. Why don’t I take a few strong Mages of Fanxue Mountain with me and get rid of them?”

“Mu Fangzhou and Fan Ning came with them. I doubt any of us could threaten them,” Mui Shan sighed in defeat.

It was supposed to be a day of celebration. The Mui Clan, Bai Clan, and Fanxue Mountain were officially forming an alliance today so they could help one another out in this disastrous time.

To their surprise, the Mu Clan and Zhao Clan were trying to mess with the wedding! “It seems like I’ve come just in time!” Mo Fan greeted everyone with a smile.
