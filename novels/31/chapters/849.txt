“It’s real; our ancestors also mentioned it in some records. The big guy actually died roughly two thousand years ago. Our ancestors even drew the details of his death. His body fell apart like dust, as if the flesh was corroding. His skeleton was exposed for all to see, before slowly sinking into the sand...” Tangyue did not seem to be joking.

From her description, Mo Fan could imagine the scene of the dead Black Totem Snake that her ancestors had passed down.

“But isn’t he perfectly well and fine?” Mo Fan pointed at the water and saw the Black Totem Snake’s nostrils surfacing and blowing water out like a whale.

As a matter of fact, the Black Totem Snake’s head was a lot bigger than a whale. The sight was marvelous. Luckily, the lake was big enough to hold the creature’s enormous body.

“The totem beasts die in a certain way, but if the conditions are met, they can be revived,” said Tangyue.

“If the conditions are met... like collecting seven dragon orbs?” Mo Fan asked with a vivid imagination.

“Mmm, something like that!” Tangyue nodded.

Mo Fan almost dropped his jaw to the ground. He was simply telling a joke, yet Tangyue actually nodded.

“So what you mean is, the wooden clapper is something like a dragon orb, and once we found the other six, we can summon or revive the missing totem beast?” asked Mo Fan.

Tangyue was amused when she heard Mo Fan mention the wooden clappers. Surely he didn’t think it’s the same as an anime?

“Not quite. I don’t really know the exact way to summon or revive the totem beasts, but I know the totem containers are the key. Only those with containers can proceed to the next step, and by doing certain things or rituals, they can wake or revive the totem beasts,” explained Tangyue.

“So Zhao Manyan was really lucky? That thing seems to have accepted him as its owner,” said Mo Fan.

“Totem containers are usually passed down along generations or lost in some corners of the world. It will be pretty tough to meet the conditions to summon the totem beasts. I believe that thing can at best be used as an Advanced Magic Tool by your friend. It’s unlikely to summon a totem beast... at least, it’s not possible for a single person,” said Tangyue.

“But there’s still a chance, if we found the right methods?” asked Mo Fan.

Mo Fan could not help but look at the West Lake. He could feel a surge of excitement when he recalled the Black Totem Snake’s overwhelming strength.

Any person who could control a creature of that level would surely stand at the top of the world!

The Mountain Zombie almost destroyed the Ancient Capital. If anyone could summon a totem beast to fight the Mountain Zombie off, the Ancient Capital would not have gone through such a great crisis!

Similarly, the Silver Skyruler had posed a great threat to Hangzhou during the plague. The Silver Skyruler was leading the airborne White Magic Falcons, and the air defenses had collapsed due to the Silver Skyruler ruling over the Heavenly Eagles’ lineage. Despite that, the Black Totem Snake managed to hold the Silver Skyruler and its entire clan off. Mo Fan would never forget that scene!

Zhao Manyan had coincidentally found a totem container. With the finances of his family, perhaps he would have a chance of learning its secrets and summoning the totem beast. At that time, the Zhao Family would easily dominate the scene!

“The totem containers are their cores?” asked Mo Fan.

“Right, and only the totem containers know how to awaken the totem beasts. Mmm, the truth is, if big guy didn’t survive back then and was killed when he is the weakest during ecdysis, he might turn into a vessel too... unfortunately, the records didn’t really mention how he came back to life after his death. Otherwise, it might be a great help for your friend,” mused Tangyue.

“It’s a pity indeed...” agreed Mo Fan with a sigh.

“Forget it, it’s beyond our reach for now. Think about it; no totem beast has shown up for thousands of years, even though people have found the totem containers. It implies that awakening the totem beasts is truly a difficult task. Tell your friend not to be too greedy. It’s good enough if he manages to master the totem container’s special ability,” said Tangyue.

“Mmm, I’ll pass the message to him.”

After playing with the Black Totem Snake for a while, Mo Fan departed from Hangzhou.

He had received four Lightning Star Constellation Scrolls from Tangyue. He remembered how much effort he made at Mount Hua just to learn the Sky-Flame Funeral.

While Mo Fan was on the train, he took the Little Loach Pendant out and observed it closely.

The Little Loach Pendant was startled, not sure why its master would be staring at it all of a sudden. It felt strange, even the Nether River was shaking anxiously...

“Screw it, there’s no point in thinking about it,” Mo Fan tucked the Little Loach Pendant back into his clothes and rested his head on his hands as he laid down comfortably.

The Little Loach Pendant did keep its word. It actually finished evolving after a few days.

As Mo Fan thought, the pendant was now a Galaxy Magic Tool. Mo Fan’s rate of cultivation was now around eight times the normal rate.

That being said, Mo Fan had double the number of Elements of everyone else. Otherwise, if he only had two or three Elements just like the others, his cultivation would improve at the speed of a rocket.

Dean Xiao was quite kind to Mo Fan, too. He knew Mo Fan was planning to improve his Lightning Element to the Advanced Level, thus he generously offered Mo Fan a chance to enter the Three Step Tower, so he could attempt the breakthrough under the strong elemental presence in the tower!

Since all preparations were made, it was time to proceed with the attempt. Mo Fan was not the kind to waste his time sitting around.

——

The Lightning Element was ready to break through to the next level.

The Galaxy Vein was the main support, followed by the Little Loach Pendant’s power and a small portion of the remaining energy from refining the Eternal Lotus. In addition, the pressure of the Three Step Tower would further compress the Lightning Element around him, providing similar effects to a Lightning Domain. It was unlikely that he would fail in his attempt.

On top of that, Mo Fan was already an Advanced Magician, and already had the mental strength of an Advanced Magician. It would be easier for him to improve his other Elements to the Advanced Level.

Sitting in the fourth-floor of the Three Step Tower, Mo Fan could feel a strong presence of the Lightning Element around him. It felt like he could cast a spell with a single flick of his fingers.

He took a deep breath to calm his thoughts.

He would be lying if he said he was not nervous, since failing the attempt would mean losing a hundred million. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

-By the way, which god should I be beseeching to provide me with good luck during the breakthrough?-

-Forget it, I should just pray to Little Loach...-

It had brought him to this fascinating world of magic, so it should be fully responsible for looking after him during this crazy magical adventure!
