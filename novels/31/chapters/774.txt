As a matter of fact, Nanyu was no longer interested in the wooden clapper. She was more interested in Mo Fan’s vessel now. Otherwise, she would not have dragged him to the side.

The wooden clapper was a high-level vessel. No one in the team had managed to crack its Magic Lock. It had also given birth to a terrifying demon spirit in just a few years, clearly implying how extraordinary it was.

And yet, such a vessel seemed to be scared of Mo Fan. The only explanation was that Mo Fan owned a stronger vessel!

“I’ve mentioned it before, a real vessel has its own soul. They even have their own temper, character, and can relate to their master’s feelings. These vessels are grouped into different levels, too, with auras and presence similar to creatures with outstanding lineages. The wooden clapper vessel strongly rejects you. It doesn’t let you touch it, even after you’ve killed the demon spirit. That means that it’s scared of something you have. I guess your vessel has the ability to devour other things, so the wooden clapper is only rejecting you to protect itself!” Nanyu’s eyes glittered as she was talking about vessels.

She was extremely passionate about Magic Equipment. She was initially very excited when she had the chance to inspect the wooden clapper, but she ended up discovering a greater secret that Mo Fan was trying to hide!

Mo Fan’s vessel must be extremely powerful!

“Hehe... are you being serious now, I’m nothing but a povo. Unlike you guys with wealthy and formidable backgrounds, the only thing that the Mo Family left for me is my handsome face, which so many girls have fallen in love with. There’s no way I would have a Spirit-grade vessel or Soul-grade vessel,” Mo Fan laughed hollowly, trying to keep his secret.

-Damn it, is this Nanyu a freak? How was she able to deduce the existence of the Little Loach Pendant?- Mo Fan admitted that the Little Loach Pendant was indeed interested in eating the wooden clapper, but the wooden clapper was not something he could easily mess with, either. The strong Magic Lock was not giving him any chance to devour it.

“Fine, I know there’s no way you will tell me such a great secret easily. I still haven’t understood everything about the wooden clapper. I bet I won’t able to learn anything even if you showed me your precious toy now. However, I believe you’ll need my help one day, when you want to know its secrets,” Nanyu was well-behaved. She did not ask him any more.

Mo Fan uttered a relieved sigh. He had never told anyone about the Little Loach Pendant. Miss Tangyue had seen the pendant before, and was still unaware of its unbelievable ability to refine Soul Essences.

“By the way, aren’t you curious why you’re the only one that can see the wooden clapper’s demon spirit?” said Nanyu with a faint smile.

“Mmm?” Mo Fan raised his eyebrows. Somehow, he felt like Nanyu had turned into a cunning fox. He had to be careful not to expose his secret.

“I think your precious treasure is somehow related to the wooden clapper. You can visit the island in Hangzhou’s West Lake if you have the time. Check the drawings on the wall, you might figure out something,” said Nanyu.

“I’ve been there,” replied Mo Fan.

“How about Tianshan Mountain?” said Nanyu.

“Not yet, what can I find there?” Mo Fan was intrigued.

“The same ancient words. Such a pity, I haven’t found the translation of the ancient words. Otherwise, we would be able to decipher it easily,” said Nanyu.

“Oh, alright, I’ll visit it when I have the chance,” Mo Fan nodded.

Nanyu giggled when she saw Mo Fan’s reaction.

This prick, he was reluctant to admit that he had a vessel just a moment ago, but his reaction when she provided him with some clues had already revealed the truth.

“Oh right, what do you mean by lifetime vessel just then?” asked Mo Fan.

“Lifetime vessels... they are a unique kind of vessel that can fully merge with human souls. Others won’t be able to take it away, unless they crush their master’s soul to pieces. Someone can only have one lifetime vessel in their whole lives. The wooden clapper is a lifetime vessel, too. You already have one, so Zhao Manyan was lucky enough to claim it. But then again, maybe the vessel is more suitable for Zhao Manyan. These intelligent vessels can pick their own master, yet it didn’t choose Mu Ningxue, who’s stronger,” Nanyu told him.

Mo Fan nodded, although he had only understood half of the explanation. When it came to magic equipment or weapons, his level of understanding was similar to primary school students. He had no clue what Nanyu was saying when she was explaining the deeper stuff.

Speaking of which, even though he was the reason that Zhao Manyan had gotten into trouble, the man had gotten a lifetime vessel in return. Zhao Manyan should be grateful to him instead!

Everyone in the team was busy packing their luggage. The monks were generous enough. They had bought everyone on the team a train ticket to Tokyo.

The train happened to be traveling along the shoreline. Mo Fan poked his head out of the window and enjoyed the scenery as they left Xixiong City.

“By the way, if the cliff close to the sea is in that direction, doesn’t that mean this part of the sea is where the island that Miyata mentioned was supposed to be?” Jiang Yu asked Mo Fan who was sitting beside him.

The window was not big, and Mo Fan had basically extended his body out of it. He simply blocked the vision of the people sitting in the same row.

Mo Fan subconsciously looked toward the sea when he heard Jiang Yu’s words. The area pretty much led offshore to the Pacific Ocean. However, the mountain where Yanming Temple was located extended past the shoreline and blocked off the view. Only those on the cliff or passengers on the trains that were traveling on the same line could barely see this side of the ocean.

The railway was about to take a turn soon. Mo Fan could only take a glimpse of the ocean.

The truth was, when Mo Fan and Ai Jiangtu were in the illusion, they had already checked the area, but they did not see any island nearby.

The mist early in the morning had yet to disperse fully. The sea looked somewhat blurry in the distance. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The train sounded its horn, signaling the passengers on board that it was making a turn.

The wind blew on Mo Fan’s face. He indifferently took a glimpse of the sea while he was inhaling the fresh air through the window!

His eyes widened as soon as he took a glimpse. There was indeed an island in the mist on the ocean!

Mo Fan was wondering if he had imagined it. He quickly focused and peered into the distance. However, before he could take a closer look, the train had driven into the mountain. Everything darkened when the train entered the tunnel...

The tunnel was quite long. When he finally was able to see outside again, he could no longer see the same view of the ocean.

“Did I imagine it?” Mo Fan returned to his seat with a blank expression.

“What’s wrong?” asked Jiang Yu.

“I think... I think I just saw the non-existent island that Miyata mentioned,” Mo Fan replied in disbelief.
