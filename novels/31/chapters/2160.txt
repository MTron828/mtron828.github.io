Chapter 2163: The Truth Behind Green Sprouts Island

Translated by XephiZ

“Secretary Richard, didn’t you say you aren’t from the Guild of the Wicked?” Mo Fan mocked him with a smile.

“With my position, it’s normal for me to come into contact with the superiors of the Guild of the Wicked, even if I’m not a member. Babbitt is only a crooked merchant whom I contact directly in Crete. He isn’t really a core member of the Black Ornaments, but the godfather of the Black Ornaments is a sworn brother of mine,” Secretary Richard quickly explained.

“Bullsh**, you are just greedy scum. The godfather is only close with you because you have a little power in the military. Do you really think he treats you seriously?” Babbitt yelled back.

“Babbitt, who do you think you are? You just sell the organs of the Tyrant Titans on the black market. Do you know how deep the Black Ornaments have established their influence in Crete?” Secretary Richard refuted him.

Mo Fan was amused when he saw the two turning against one another.

“You two shouldn’t treat me like an idiot. If you don’t say something valuable soon, I’ll kill both of you. It will only take me a little more time to find your superior. Let’s talk about Green Sprouts Island; I’ll see which one of you can provide me with more useful information,” Mo Fan said.

“The troop that isolated Green Sprouts Island was my men...” Secretary Richard said instantly.

“I told the godfather that Mr. Lin, who owns the olive groves on Green Sprouts Island, wasn’t willing to pay the Black Ornaments’ protection fee...” Babbitt blurted out.

“I was the one who controlled the movements of the survivors. The survivors whom the general and the Parthenon Temple found only arrived at Green Sprouts Island after the incident!” Secretary Richard said.

“I already knew the things you just said. If the next thing from you doesn’t get my interest, they will be your last words!” Mo Fan said coldly.

Secretary Richard and Babbitt lost their calm. They did not expect Mo Fan to already know so much.

“It...it was me who asked the godfather to teach Mr. Lin a lesson so that every merchant in Crete will be obedient to us and submit thirty percent of their income to us, so the president went to the olive grove and summoned his...his demon,” Babbitt blurted out.

“A demon with cross marks on its back, am I right?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes!” Babbitt exclaimed in surprise.

He did not think Mo Fan would know about the cross marks on the creature’s back. It was the most distinctive feature of their godfather’s demon. All those who saw it should have died in the incident!

Secretary Richard saw Babbitt had successfully gotten Mo Fan’s interest. He turned around and saw the shadow demon about to execute him. He quickly yelled in a panic, “It was me who activated the city’s defensive barrier. I was the one who did it!”

“Wasn’t it normal to activate the defensive Barrier? You did a good thing.” Mo Fan was surprised.

“No, it’s not like that. I activated the defensive barrier so the people on Green Sprouts Island c-couldn’t escape...” Secretary Richard stuttered.

Secretary Richard regretted his words after spilling the beans. When he looked at Mo Fan’s eyes again, he saw a terrifying glitter in them. Mo Fan looked like an envoy from Hell!

“I already guessed that,” Mo Fan withheld his anger in him for a moment.

Secretary Richard was dumbfounded. If Mo Fan already knew so much about the incident, he could have reported them to the Parthenon Temple, yet he had come here alone instead?

“Are you wondering why I didn’t let the government handle it?” Mo Fan explained in a calm voice when he saw Secretary Richard’s eyes moving wildly. “I came here by myself to take matters into my own hands. If the officials handle it, perhaps they might relieve you of some accusations by abusing the loopholes in the laws. I’ll be very sad when that happens, especially when I realized you scum were going to live for more than a few months!”

“There’s a pool to the east of the olive grove. Most of the dead bodies of the residents on Green Sprouts Island were buried under it!” Babbitt yelled to grab Mo Fan’s attention.

“Oh?” Mo Fan’s heart tightened, yet he still raised his brows like he was intrigued.

“The Bishop of the Black Church, Bandur, he’s responsible for the incident! The witnesses were all members of the Black Church. They insisted a sea titan was the culprit of the incident!” Secretary Richard immediately exposed the identity of someone involved in the incident when he saw Babbitt offer Mo Fan such an important piece of evidence.

“We bribed Frank, too! His Swiss bank account has the profits we’ve made from selling the Tyrant Titans’ organs over the past year!” Babbitt said.

“Screw you, you only gave me half a year’s profit!” Secretary Richard lost his temper when he heard the words. He almost had an urge to kill Babbitt on the spot.

“Frank is a famous news reporter in Greece. He doesn’t just work for the media or the government, the whole world listens to his news too. If he hadn’t claimed the culprit was a Sea Titan, we wouldn’t be able to cover up the incident. We had to erase a lot of evidence!” Babbitt went on.

The two got angrier the more they said. Even if Mo Fan did not do anything, only one of them would live in the end. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mo Fan happened to receive a call as they were talking.

Mo Fan was not recording the conversation. There was no point in doing so. He just needed to find the pool where the bodies were buried to uncover the truth.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan knew nothing about the things that Secretary Richard and Babbitt had told him, he had only pretended to. He could picture a hellish scene as he was listening to them.

The city’s Barrier had been used to trap the residents of the city instead of protecting them. Mo Fan looked at the stars above him, yet all he could think of were bloodshot eyes filled with despair.

Even if the Black Ornaments had established their influence across Crete and infiltrated its military, government, church, and merchant’s guild, it did not mean they had the right to ravage innocent lives.

The cruel era of Tyrant Titans in Greece was still ongoing!

“Hey, Mo Fan, we found Mr. Lin’s daughter,” Zhao Manyan’s voice came from the other end of the call.

“What did she say?” Mo Fan asked calmly.

“It turns out that Mr. Lin isn’t innocent, either. He had planted a lot of poppies. The olive grove was just a disguise. However, he wasn’t willing to pay when the Black Ornaments found out his secret, so the Black Ornaments decided to teach him a lesson,” Zhao Manyan said.

“So how did the whole Green Sprouts Island end up being destroyed?” Mo Fan asked.

Babbitt thought Mo Fan was asking him. He quickly answered, “Our godfather’s demon has a strong taste for blood, and it’s very fond of poppies, too. It might have gone out of control after it ate the poppies after attacking the olive grove, so when it picked up the scent of humans from the island...”
