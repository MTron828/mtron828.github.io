Chapter 2794: Destruct And Trample

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Mo Fan was suspended in the air, and the huge Ghostly Energy Moon Sword slashed at him.

The Ghostly Energy Moon Sword chopped off all the large buildings within a radius of one kilometer in one fell swoop as Jiu Ying waved it. It appeared as if a thousand giant sharp blades slashed toward Mo Fan from every direction.

The Ghostly Energy Moon Sword could even split the flames Mo Fan had spread in the surroundings.

Mo Fan’s figure was constantly flickering. Little Flame Belle had fully matured, and her understanding of space had reached a higher level. After Little Flame Belle merged with Mo Fan, he obtained her knowledge because of their merging of magic.

Mo Fan was a Space Element Mage. After possessing Little Flame Belle’s understanding of space, he could use many skills that he previously was unaware of.

There was only one Ghostly Energy Moon Sword. However, the spread of Ghostly Energy caused this to move quickly in a blur giving off an impression that multiple swords were slashing at the target.

Mo Fan used teleportation to dodge the attacks. But the Ghostly Energy Moon Sword followed Mo Fan and he could not get rid of it.

Mo Fan did not care. He teleported to different spaces and appeared next to Jiu Ying.

The Ghostly Energy Moon Sword attacked, but Mo Fan did not move. He stood there and connected all the space nodes and formed a gorgeous silver compass.

Mo Fan did not dodge this time, but Jiu Ying did not dare let the Ghostly Energy Moon Sword attack. If he did, the sword would slash him along with Mo Fan.

“Space Compass: Axis of Death!”

With this little trick, Mo Fan completed the Super Level magic of the Space Element.

A dark red axis appeared. Mo Fan moved from Jiu Ying’s right to the left. The dark red axis hit Jiu Ying’s heart by connecting Mo Fan’s afterimage like getting a thread through the eye of a needle.

Jiu Ying grimaced as he saw the compass formed by the space nodes. Jiu Ying tried his best to move, but no matter how he changed his position and direction, the entire space compass’s axis still aimed at him. Mo Fan had accurately measured the meridians on his body.

It was the Super Level magic of the Space Element. Even if Jiu Ying knew how it worked, he could not avoid it. The silver compass Mo Fan created while using the teleportation of Space Element to dodge his Ghostly Energy Moon Sword surprised Jiu Ying.

The deadly red axis passed through Jiu Ying’s heart. In the beginning, only a small, pencil-sized hole appeared on his heart. Soon, many red dots appeared in the deadly meridians corresponding to the silver nodes of the Space Compass. It looked like small laser beams.

Jiu Ying’s body was torn apart. The dark red axis of the compass cut through one of his eyeballs. Jiu Ying was in disbelief seconds before he dropped dead.

Mo Fan walked to Jiu Ying’s corpse. The divine fire did not dissipate even after Jiu Ying’s death.

Mo Fan smiled. He closed his eyes for a while. When he opened his eyes, they had turned black like a bottomless abyss that could consume everything. It was Dragon Sense.

It was the ability given to Mo Fan by the Black Dragon Soul. All the subtleties around him were immediately clear to him because of this ability.

At fewer than two hundred meters from Mo Fan, a trace of blue Ghostly Energy crawled on the Dark Swamp. Mo Fan knew what it was. He was skilled in dark magic and was a Shadow Element Mage who knew how to use Dark Puppets.

Those body parts were real. Mo Fan suspected that Jiu Ying had used a living person as his puppet and used Puppet Magic to replace him when it was critical. This trick could not deceive Mo Fan, especially his Dragon Sense.

The thing that was crawling in the Dark Swamp was Jiu Ying. He was not dead.

It was impossible to dodge the deadly axis of the Space Compass unless the person was powerful enough to destroy the space nodes. Jiu Ying knew this, so he did not defend or try to dodge it. He used the Puppet Magic to get away from the deadly axis of the Space Compass instead.

Jiu Ying was clear-headed and cunning. After all, he was Nan Shou of the Forbidden City. The strengths of the four people could resist the attack of the huge army of the Ocean Demons and fight against the Deep-Sea Lizard Dragon Demons. If Jiu Ying hadn’t hidden his identity, it would have been difficult to break the team.

“If you like to hide in the ground, stay there permanently!”

Mo Fan suddenly jumped up, and a black light appeared on his feet. It was a pair of domineering Black Dragon Boots. The boots turned Mo Fan into a mountain-sized black dragon as he jumped into the air!

The black dragon flew into the air and trampled everything. Mo Fan still had divine fire encasing his body. So, the dragon was on fire. When it trampled its feet, the force was enough to make a city disappear.

Bang!

The kick was second only to that of the black dragon itself. Jiu Ying was so frightened his body became visible and he tried his best to withstand the trampling.

But the black dragon was an emperor-level creature. Even though it had turned into a pair of boots, it could give Mo Fan an unparalleled destructive power if he had the Dragon Soul.

The earth shook violently, and the city was shaking.

Song Feiyao, the black phoenix, was in the air to block the Sword Fish with Green East Sea God’s power. When she heard the loud noise, she glanced at Mo Fan and saw a terrifying pit in the city. It seemed like an emperor-level creature had arrived.

Song Feiyao realized Mo Fan had not used all his power when he overthrew the Licheng Afterglow Island. Even without the three Totems, Mo Fan was invincible.

…

In the big pit, the bones of Jiu Ying trembled. He dragged himself with the strength of his upper body like a disabled beggar on the street. His face showed horror and he no longer had the confidence of Nan Shou or the Red Cardinal.

“I was going to use this kick only against a powerful Ocean Demon, but it’s not a loss to use it on you.” Mo Fan walked over with the Black Dragon Boots.

The power of the black dragon dissolved the objects he passed by. Mo Fan looked very much like the God of Destruction usually seen in the ancient murals!
