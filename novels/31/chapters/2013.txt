A little creature was playing around with the glowing stone!

Mo Fan would not have been surprised if it was a little eagle. After all, the glowing stone looked quite precious, as if it contained a high amount of energy.

However, the strange thing was, the little creature carrying the Night Amethyst was not an eaglet, but a creature that resembled a tiger!

Its eyes were huge and adorable, like something from a cartoon, glittering in the dim light. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Its snow-white ears were erect with curiosity, and its head was slanted to one side.

Its chubby paws were stepping on the ice. Its short but balanced limbs were like those of an elegant kitten, but the silver whiskers and menacing mouth made it look completely different from a kitten. Its presence was already several times stronger than any cat.

“A tiger cub?!”

It was a tiger! A small white tiger with an elegant and mystical demeanor!

Mo Fan and Apas stared, their eyes wide. They were wondering if they had seen it wrong.

Why was there a white tiger’s cub in the eagle fledglings’ kindergarten? Was the Scar of Tianshan Mountain already free from species discrimination? Were the young of different species taken care of in the same place?

“Ugh... little thing, did you go to the wrong class?” Mo Fan gently asked the little cub, who was unafraid of these strangers.

The little white tiger was intrigued too. It was struggling to understand how such a stick-like creature had appeared out of nowhere. They did not look like eagles at all!

Apas reached her hand out to express goodwill to the cub.

The little cub was still holding the glowing stone, like a little baby clinging onto his pacifier. It sniffed and stuck its nose closer to Apas’ hand.

“Don’t scare it with the foxy scent of yours,” Mo Fan said.

Apas ignored Mo Fan. She waited for the cub to come closer before fondling its ears. She boldly bent the ear back around. The ear looked firm, but it was actually soft and flexible. Mo Fan thought the cub would be mad, yet it suddenly turned into a happy kitten and let Apas play with its ear gently.

“So it’s a perverted cub,” Mo Fan said disdainfully.

“It seems to have entered the eagles’ nest by accident.” Apas was extremely pleased by the little cub. She soon picked it up in her arms.

“Aren’t the demon tigers and the ancient eagles enemies? What a bold little cub she is to sneak into their enemy’s nest. Most importantly, the eagles are clueless about her existence!” Mo Fan said.

“The eaglets know. They were playing with her just now,” Apas replied.

The eaglets were not aggressive. They even behaved normally when they saw Mo Fan and Apas were there. Some of the bolder chubby ones even circled Apas and Mo Fan.

Loud cries suddenly came from above. They obviously belonged to male eagles.

“We should leave,” Apas said.

“We haven’t found any Night Amethyst,” Mo Fan complained.

“We won’t be able to leave if they see us. I’ve already checked the area. The Night Amethyst isn’t here,” Apas said.

“Are you sure?”

“Yes!”

“What about this little thing?” Mo Fan asked.

“Of course we are bringing her with us. The male eagles will tear her into pieces if they see her... oh, I just realized why that Skyridge White Tiger was provoking the Frosty Ancient Eagles!” Apas blurted out.

“Why?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“It’s because of the cub. The Skyridge White Tiger knows its cub entered the nest by accident. It was trying to distract the eagles so the cub would have a chance to escape... which is our chance to escape too! The Skyridge White Tiger will be back!” Apas said.

Mo Fan finally understood the situation.

“Little thing, you must have worried the hell out of your parents!”

Apas kept holding the little cub after they returned to the cave. The other Mages thought it was her pet cat, so they did not treat it seriously. However, the observant Night Rakshasa immediately noticed its unusualness. She stared at the cub vigilantly.

The cub had an innocent and harmless expression. She tilted her head and looked back at the Night Rakshasa curiously.

The Night Rakshasa lowered her guard when she realized the creature was just a child. To her surprise, the cub jumped down and started playing with her tail as soon as she turned around.

The Night Rakshasa was most likely an unapproachable empress in the world of cats. She immediately lost her temper when the cub grabbed her tail.

The cub was overjoyed after provoking the Night Rakshasa. She quickly ran over to Mu Ningxue.

The cub jumped into Mu Ningxue’s arms as if she had sensed the pleasing icy Aura coming from her. Mu Ningxue was suddenly at a complete loss.

“Xuexue, it seems like she is fond of you more, unlike some demon snake that keeps enchanting her,” Mo Fan smiled.

Mu Ningxue was not fond of little creatures. She tried to put the cub down, but the cub was already asleep in her arms. She was already snoring, speaking of falling asleep within a second!

Mo Fan admired the little cub’s boldness when he saw how attached she had become to Mu Ningxue. The little tigress had no clue how evil the world was.

“Xuexue, you should just keep her. Fate has brought her to you,” Mo Fan smiled.

The little cub was currently at the age that was the easiest to trick since she was curious about everything around her and had no suspicion of the world. A Summoner had a high chance of establishing a Contract with it successfully. It was also the reason why younglings of demon creatures were sold at a high price on the market.

Unfortunately, Mo Fan had run out of Contract slots. In terms of usefulness, Apas was a far better option than the little cub, except for her lack of obedience.

“I...” Mu Ningxue was baffled too. Why was the creature so attached to her? “I...I don’t think I can take good care of her,” Mu Ningxue quickly gave the cub back to Apas.

The cub obviously liked Mu Ningxue’s presence more. She twisted around in Apas’ arms a bit before going back to sleep.

Mo Fan looked at Mu Ningxue. He noticed she was behaving strangely.
