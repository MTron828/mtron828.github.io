The land of ashes and bones started shaking. Tiny particles were being knocked into the air.

The sand under them began moving. The people on it were moving forward uncontrollably, as if someone was pulling the corner of a carpet they were standing on.

Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya exchanged glances. They had no idea whether a terrifying creature was responsible for this, or it was just how the Dark Plane worked.

They tried walking in the opposite direction, but a strange power stopped them.

Whenever they tried to move in the opposite direction, their bodies would freeze, but they did not feel any resistance when they were moving with the flow.

“The game has begun. The restriction we felt is part of the rules,” Asha’ruiya deduced.

They were not allowed to move backward or leave the place with Fleeing Shadow or Blink. The strange force had restricted them from using their magic despite their current cultivation levels, a clear indication that the one who was in full control of the land was involved.

“It seems like we can only go toward wherever it’s bringing us to,” Mo Fan agreed with a wry smile.

The land of ashes and bones was not moving straight forward. It was like a horizontal funnel, forcing the people there to gather in a specific direction.

The further they went, the bigger the crowd became. Most people had fear on their faces, but they could only follow their survival instincts and obey the will of the Lord of Darkness.

Mo Fan could not help but feel helpless when he saw more people gathering around them.

He was having trouble explaining a lot of things after coming here, especially the strange restriction that was stopping them from going anywhere else. Everyone was under the same restriction, regardless of their strength. They had no choice but to follow the rules here!

“Our Parthenon Temple has a similar restriction. Didn’t you have a taste of it when you broke your way in? That being said, only the Lord of Darkness could establish one strong enough to restrict several tens of thousands of people,” Asha’ruiya remarked softly.

A Magic Formation that could target everyone inside it was the strongest form of magic, but the Lord of Darkness was using it to set up a game!

“The people are being split into three groups,” Asha’ruiya observed.

She was watching everything carefully. She had read a lot of ancient records and learned about the Lord of Darkness’ strange nature. He would set up the travelers and lead them toward despair, but he would also provide them with interesting clues along the way, which could help them escape.

Asha’ruiya had called it a game since they had ended up here. Travelers had to use all kinds of methods to pass and the game, but the main problem was that there was no second chance after losing the game, their souls would be trapped here forever! Winning the game did not necessarily mean they had earned their escape. They might have to play a more intense game next. The Lord of Darkness had plenty of time to spare, after all!

“I bet the three groups are going to end up in three different places,” Mo Fan guessed.

Mo Fan was quite intrigued by the strange power. How did the Lord of Darkness make sure everything was done according to his will? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The ability to move the land of ashes and bones and the Magic Formation that was preventing them from escaping. How strong exactly was the Lord of Darkness that the black dragon, Sharjah, Su Lu, the possessor of the Demon Element, and the others were forced to be his test subjects?

How powerful was the Lord of Darkness that he could create a space that was completely unreasonable compared to the outside world?

“Mo Fan!” Asha’ruiya suddenly pointed ahead.

Mo Fan was lost in thought. He immediately came back to his senses and looked ahead after hearing Asha’ruiya’s shout.

There was a rotating wheel around the height of a skyscraper, rising from the land of ashes and bones!

The wheel had rings of various-sized blades on it. The blades on the outermost circle were like towering trees, while the smaller ones in the center were like the fangs of some monsters!

The blades made up three different layers on the wheel. Mo Fan saw the people ahead were being dragged into the wheel. Their blood was oozing out of the gaps between the blades.

It was like an enormous juicer, but it was not making juice out of fruits, but the travelers who had ended up in the Dark Plane!

Mo Fan gasped.

Everything was calm and peaceful just a second ago, but a huge killing machine had appeared all of a sudden. Cries and screams filled up the place. The people who were being dragged toward the wheel were bursting into tears!

“Damn it, I can’t sense any magic,” Mo Fan cursed.

There was no presence of magic around him!

Mo Fan had not noticed it at first, since he was completely worn out. He subconsciously tried to accumulate magic when he sensed he was in danger, but the whole place was like a vacuum.

He could not Cast even a Basic Spell without magic!

Mo Fan wanted to destroy the spinning wheel, but quickly realized it was impossible.

The Lord of Darkness… he was not allowing the travelers to use magic!

“Mo Fan, I think we are fine...” Asha’ruiya said.

Mo Fan frowned. He immediately followed Asha’ruiya’s gaze.

The crowd was being split into three groups and brought along three parallel paths. They were all heading in the same direction.

The rotating wheel had appeared on the leftmost path. Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya were in the middle.

The two paths were around three hundred meters apart. The people on the path in the middle could just barely squeeze past the blades!

In other words, two-thirds of the crowd was safe, while the remainder had to suffer the tortures of the spinning blades!

—

A strong smell of blood lingered in the air. As the blood permeated the ground, the ocean of blood behind them seemed to glow a little brighter.

Mo Fan turned around. If he had been on the leftmost path, would he have been shredded by the blades too, since he was unable to use his magic?

“Was that part of the rules too?” Mo Fan had to ask.

“I think the rules of the game have something to do with our luck.”

The crowd was randomly split into three groups without any specific order.

No one knew where the wheel was going to show up. Therefore, those who were unlucky had to die in the first stage.

Mo Fan was scared to even imagine what was going to happen next!

The God of Death had already claimed the lives of one-third of the travelers in such a casual manner!
