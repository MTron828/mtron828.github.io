“How was it? Are you alright? What did you do to the vengeful spirit? Tell me immediately if you feel anything,” Feng Zhoulong asked worriedly.

Mo Fan slowly opened his eyes. A dark substance was flowing in his dark brown eyes. They looked as if they had sealed a strange life form inside.

“It’s fine, that guy couldn’t really do anything to me, but the Dark Material is quite special. It needs sacrifices other than the energy when using it,” Mo Fan said.

“Sacrifices? Is it something evil? You should give it up if that is the case!” Feng Zhoulong said quickly.

“It needs Soul Remnants; it’s not really evil,” Mo Fan explained.

Soul Remnants were purchasable. After all, they were essential for the tools used to increase a person’s rate of cultivation. However, only Undead Mages could forge rare and expensive tools like the Soul Containers.

“It’s not too bad if it only needs Soul Remnants. Speaking of which, I do have a Soul Container here. I can give it to you,” Feng Zhoulong said.

“That’s fine, I have one already, it’s useful enough for me. The Dark Material is already a great gift, HAHAHA!” Mo Fan burst out laughing.

“Well, you were the one that killed him, so you have the right to claim the loot first. Besides, you’ve already pointed us in a new direction for our research. Once I learn the secrets of merging different Elements, I promise to tell you our discovery first... I have other things to attend to, but feel free to rest up here and familiarize yourself with the Dark Material. There’s a spacious training ground a level below that you can use,” Feng Zhoulong said.

“Alright, thanks!”

——

Mo Fan went to the fourth floor underground and found a spacious training ground. It was built with a kind of sturdy white rock strong enough to endure Advanced Spells. Mo Fan did not have to worry about the impact of his magic bringing down a few streets on the surface!

That being said, Mo Fan was not going to use his destructive magic. He had just obtained the Fiendish Night, thus he was planning to familiarize himself with it.

Little Loach Pendant had stored lots of Soul Remnants. The number of Soul Remnants was not enough to refine Soul Essences, but they were perfect to be used as sacrifices!

“Old Wolf, come out here!” Mo Fan swiftly tore open a rift and summoned the Flying Creek Snow Wolf from the Summoned Beast Plane.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf observed its surroundings and saw the mischievous grin on Mo Fan’s face. He immediately realized he was summoned here to be Mo Fan’s punching bag!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf unwillingly stood in a corner and howled, indicating that he was ready.

“Darkness Corruption!”

Mo Fan waved his hand. The invisible aura moved without leaving any trace. A strange black mist appeared out of nowhere at the spot Mo Fan was focusing on. It went into the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s body like a little squid setting up an ambush for a creature larger than it.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf turned around as he sensed something, yet he did not see a single thing. He was totally unaware that the dark substance had already gone into his body!

“Invisible and untraceable, even the victim is unaware of it! Brilliant!” Mo Fan mumbled.

The Darkness Corruption was different from the Giant Shadow Spikes. It was still possible to track the Giant Shadow Spikes with the mind and follow their trails through certain reflections. Meanwhile, the Darkness Corruption was able to appear out of nowhere. When the Seed of Darkness was planted inside the target’s body, it would grow and sprout on its own. It could even spread to things nearby, while keeping the target under surveillance...

“I remember Leng Qing was murdered by the Demon Shadow that came out of Xiao Ping’s body, which means Xiao Ping was a victim of the Darkness Corruption, too. The Seed of Darkness was planted in her body. Even if Bei Jiang was quite a distance away, the Sprout of Darkness can still turn into a Shadow Demon...” Mo Fan analyzed.

Mo Fan could see the Seed of Darkness growing in the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s body. The dark energy was flowing in the creature’s blood, muscles, and bones. When Mo Fan gave his order, the Fiendish Night could activate the dark energy that was corrupting the target!

“Summon Servant!” Mo Fan instructed.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf remained still. His head was full of question marks.

Normally, his master would have fired destructive spells at him; why was he acting so calm today? Did he misunderstand his master? He was not treating him as a punching bag today?

“Awoo!” The Flying Creek Snow Wolf suddenly let out a painful cry. Something had just stabbed him on the back. The pain he felt was several times stronger than usual. He furiously turned around to see. He wanted to know what was trying to mess with him!

However, he did not see anything after he turned around.

“Awoo!”

Before he could react, something stabbed him on the back of his leg. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf immediately realized the place he was standing on was dangerous. He spread his limbs and sprinted across the training ground.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf kept turning his head around to find the thing that was attacking him. He believed it would struggle to hit him while he was running.

“Awooo!”

To the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s surprise, he felt a sharp pain from his head. It immediately drove the creature mad. He swung his claws around. It did not matter if the enemy was close to him. He had to counterattack first!

“HAHAHAHA!” Mo Fan burst out laughing after seeing how miserable the Flying Creek Snow Wolf was.

Little Flame Belle had snuck out too. She sat on Mo Fan’s shoulder and burst into laughter.

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf concentrated. He finally noticed his shadow moving into a blind spot. The pain had come from the shadow’s claw!

The Flying Creek Snow Wolf did not understand why his shadow was attacking him all of a sudden. He started running again.

The only problem was... how could a creature possibly outrun its own shadow? The Flying Creek Snow Wolf soon howled in pain again.

“The sequence of using the Darkness Corruption is to first plant a Seed of Darkness, then wait for it to sprout. I can then Summon a Shadow Fiend Demon Servant from it, basically the target’s own shadow. The target has no chance of running away from its attacks...” Mo Fan finally understood why Leng Qing’s heart had stopped beating, even when she was under heavy surveillance!

It was impossible to defend against the ability if they were unaware of it in the first place!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
