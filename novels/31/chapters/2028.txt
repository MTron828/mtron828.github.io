The Flying Snow Fox Ruler was the most cunning of the scavengers. It kept roaming around the edge of the battlefield and picking off the Mages who were weaker, stranded, or severely injured.

It blended into the fight between the Ice Mountain Beasts and the humans. Those fighting were completely unaware of its existence most of the time. No one would have realized it was responsible for the death of their comrades if the Sound Mages had not heard its breathing and the unusual cries of agony uttered by its victims.

“That son of a b**ch, I’m going to skin it and spread it across my floor!” Lu Xiu was enraged.

The leaders were furious when they saw their members disappearing one by one. Lu Xiu fixed his eyes on the Flying Snow Fox Ruler’s position and constructed a brilliant Star Palace. The golden Star Palace was established rapidly, releasing a formidable energy of the Light Element.

“Demon Judgment Sword!”

Following Lu Xiu’s roar, an enormous light sword with a formidable power descended from the blue sky. Golden ripples kept appearing in the air while it was falling, driving away the frosty aura lingering across the place.

The Demon Judgment Sword landed in the direction that the Flying Snow Fox Ruler was fleeing into. The creature was dragging one of their captains in its mouth. It squinted when it saw the Demon Judgment Sword locking onto it. It shook its head indifferently and tossed the dying captain into the air!

The scorching Demon Judgment Sword burned the captain into ashes before even touching him.

The Flying Snow Fox Ruler spread its limbs. It could turn itself into a glider when it fully extended its limbs.

A gust of wind lifted the Flying Snow Fox Ruler into the sky like a kite.

The Flying Snow Fox Ruler rode the wind into the sky as the Demon Judgment Sword reached the ground. The creature soon disappeared behind the glaciers.

Walls of ice collapsed to the ground. An eerie laughing bark came from the distance. Lu Xiu was breathing heavily while staring in the direction that the Flying Snow Fox Ruler had fled into.

He was fooled! The Flying Snow Fox Ruler was playing him like a fiddle!

“I thought it was impossible to dodge the Demon Judgment Sword once it locked onto its target?” Guan Yu was astounded.

The Demon Judgment Sword was the strongest single-target Super Spell. It would emit a strong light like the sun before it took form. The light would fill the sky, making it impossible for the target to see where the Demon Judgment Sword was falling from. As such, it was difficult to dodge the Demon Judgment Sword.

It was not that surprising if the Flying Snow Fox Ruler dodged the attack right away, but the irony was, it purposely threw the mercenary captain into the path of the falling Demon Judgment Sword. Lu Xiu ended up killing his own man instead!

The speed of Super Spells was extremely high, like a flicker in the sky to normal people. The next thing they knew, the glowing figure of a sacred sword had struck the ground with a terrifying impact. However, the Flying Snow Fox Ruler was showing Lu Xiu how slow his spell was, as it still had time to dance around before running away!

“Night Rakshasa, keep an eye on the Flying Snow Fox Ruler. It will be back. Don’t let it pick on the people of the Mailong Private Military Group again,” Jiang Yu said.

The Flying Snow Fox Ruler’s moves were unpredictable, and its agility was outstanding. Other spells would not stand a chance if even the Demon Judgment Sword failed to take it out. Their only choice was to let the Night Rakshasa keep it at bay.

The Night Rakshasa was extremely proud. She was not interested in fighting weak enemies, so the Flying Snow Fox Ruler was a worthy opponent for her.

The little cub’s voice suddenly came from behind them.

The Night Rakshasa’s hair stood on its end when she heard it. She jumped up and flipped in the air. She spread her limbs and entered a cautious state as she landed on the ground.

The little cub’s eyes widened. She was supposed to be an imperious tiger, yet her charm outweighed that of a kitten. The Night Rakshasa was more like the bad guy compared to her!

The Night Rakshasa was about to go mad. She had never seen such a shameless tiger. Wasn’t she supposed to be more like a cat?

“Little cub, I was giving Night Rakshasa the order instead of you. Just stay put!” Jiang Yu was left speechless.

What was wrong with the little cub? The order was meant for the Night Rakshasa, but the little cub seemed more eager than the Night Rakshasa.

“Stop causing more trouble, you might be fast, but you are no match against the cunning Flying Snow Fox Ruler,” Apas finally found the little cub that was wandering around aimlessly. She quickly scooped her up in her arms.

The little cub struggled fiercely in Apas’ arms. She was rubbing her head in Apas’ bust, like the act of a lustful man.

“Damn it!” Zhao Manyan cursed when he saw what the little cub was doing from the corner of his eye.

The fight between the Ice Mountain Beasts and the humans slowly came to an end. The Ice Mountain Ruler fled after killing a member of the team of explorers from the Sacred Hall of Liberty.

The other Ice Mountain Beasts stopped defending their den after the Ice Mountain Ruler fled.

However, the scavengers were not going to let the losers of the battle go. They immediately went after the Ice Mountain Beasts who were fleeing for their lives.

Each Ice Mountain Beast was a Commander-level creature. It was easier to kill them when they were running away injured.

“Did you see that? If we run away, we would end up as the prey of the scavengers instead. There’s no turning back now!” Yassen said.

“But we lost too much,” Bertan glanced at the dead bodies scattered across the ground helplessly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The man who had died was Bertan’s old comrade. He felt horrible when he saw his friend being smashed into the ground.

“It’s better than us all dying here,” Yassen replied.

The scavengers were disgusting. They always picked on the weaker prey!

The humans had destroyed the Ice Mountain Beasts’ den, so the scavengers targeted the Ice Mountain Beasts who were running for their lives. The scavengers had already surrounded the place, so the Ice Mountain Beasts were running to their deaths after losing their will to fight.

“They...they aren’t leaving,” Klope said.

“They won’t as long as we are still alive. We all saw what happened to the Ice Mountain Beasts, so no matter what happens, we can’t show them we have lost our ability to fight. We must pretend we can still fight back so they won’t dare to do anything recklessly!” Yassen declared.
