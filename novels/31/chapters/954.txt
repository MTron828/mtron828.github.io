“She’s an Advanced Magician, Zhao Manyan might be in trouble,” Jiang Shaoxu shouted to Mo Fan when she saw the female leader of the bandits constructing a Star Constellation.

“Don’t worry, he will be fine.” Mo Fan did not seem to be bothered. Zhao Manyan actually helped divert the bandits’ attention, allowing him to take out the bandits of the Red Ornaments Guild more quickly.

Oni had completed her Star Constellation. It was a destructive spell full of explosive energy. Even her men quickly backed away when the overwhelming energy appeared, as they were worried that they would be caught in it too!

Zhao Manyan immediately focused when he realized that the woman was being utterly serious.

A Light Star Constellation similarly appeared around him. The golden Star Constellation attached to him as if he was wearing shining golden armor.

Most Light Magicians would use the Plummeting Rays as an offensive spell, as the continuous Light arrows could inflict serious damage to an enemy. However, Zhao Manyan’s Plummeting Rays simply turned the light rays into glowing scales wrapping every single part of his body tightly, like he was putting on a thick, golden chainmail!

The whole village on the mountain trembled at the power of Oni’s Advanced Spell, as if it was about to raze the place to the ground. However, Zhao Manyan was perfectly unharmed standing in the middle of the destructive energy. The golden light surrounding him was driving Oni mad!

-What kind of Magician is he? Is he made of defensive spells? Who would even use the Plummeting Rays as a defensive ability!?-

“Oni, I won’t go easy on you if you keep going!” Zhao Manyan was not a man without a temper.

“Kill him!” Oni had no intention of talking reasonably, giving the order furiously.

The Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild unwillingly obeyed the order. Even an Advanced Spell had failed to kill the guy, what difference could some Intermediate Magicians bring to the table? It was like casting a spell on a stinky, hard rock in the latrine pit!

Zhao Manyan was not totally brainless, either. He gradually realized that Oni’s group was the fishy side. It did not make sense that everyone in their group was a Magician, as they would not be afraid of the three hundred people who did not have any presence of magic on them.

“So they are the bandits, right?” Zhao Manyan asked in a serious voice.

“Did you just realize now!?” Mo Fan snapped back.

“But what’s with you robbing them?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“Stop talking nonsense, just take them out if they are not willing to pay!” Mo Fan snapped back again.

If the bandits did not pay, their corpses would do. After all, the government had already put up wanted posters with handsome rewards. Mo Fan desperately needed money... well, he was always short on funds!

“Silent Deadly Ray: Lightning Arm!”

Capture the leader and the gang will collapse, Mo Fan locked his gaze on the leader Xi Ge and finished his Advanced Lightning Spell with lightning speed.

He had to admit that Zhao Manyan was pretty good at aggroing the enemy. He would have had trouble finishing the Advanced Lightning Spell if it wasn’t for Zhao Manyan grabbing their attention!

This time, Mo Fan did not rely on a Lightning Constellation Scroll. He had constructed the enormous Lightning Star Constellation by himself. Three hundred and forty-three Stars, forty-nine Star Orbits, seven Star Patterns. The ring that Zhao Manyan brought him had indeed sped up the process of Awakening the Stars remarkably!

The real Advanced Lightning Spell was incredibly powerful. It did not have a sharp screech or the loud rumble of Lightning Strike or Thunderbolt, but a silent and deadly glow appeared on Mo Fan. The destructive energy circled Mo Fan’s right arm like a spring!

A deep rumble was heard coming from his palm, followed by a deadly ray surging straight forward like the wrath of Heaven!

The bandit’s leader, Xi Ge, was quite a cunning man, hiding behind his men. When he saw the deadly lightning bolt approaching him, he immediately dodged aside in a panic. A few of his closest subordinates were killed instantly by the lightning bolt that punctured their bodies and left a scorched hole behind!

“Do you think you can run away?” The lightning on Mo Fan’s arm did not dissipate. The previous stroke of lightning was not the complete Advanced Lightning Spell!

He touched his lightning arm with his other hand, and it was soon circled by the deadly lightning in the shape of a spring too!

“Lightning Explosion!”

Mo Fan’s arms fired two lightning bolts simultaneously. The bolts crossed each other in front of Xi Ge!

The village suddenly fell silent. The destructive energy of the wild circles of lightning exploded close to Xi Ge. Huge lightning arcs surged into the sky, and an overwhelming energy spread into the surroundings!

Xi Ge was extremely fragile before the Lightning Explosion. His lower body was blasted into pieces instantly. Mo Fan purposely left his upper body just so he could show it to the local government. Otherwise, it would turn into nothing in the Lightning Explosion, too!

Apart from the leader Xi Ge, eight Magicians nearby did not survive either. The Lightning Explosion triggered by the deadly lightning bolts was like a lightning tyrant that had just descended to the mundane world, showing no mercy to any living creature.

The village fell deadly quiet after the Lightning Explosion. The people of the Red Ornaments Guild could feel their legs trembling. They did not even have the courage to stand upright.

Most terrifyingly, the lightning on Mo Fan’s arms did not dissipate, meaning that he could trigger another Lightning Explosion among them if he wanted!

The lightning arcs soaring into the sky were able to destroy everything within a radius of a hundred meters. Despite the crimes that the Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild had committed, they had never seen such a terrifying Lightning Spell. The Asian man was like a devil after their lives. They started fleeing in all directions!

Oni was stunned for a long time too. She suddenly realized that the young Magicians were a lot stronger than she had imagined, and decisively fled for her life.

A pair of purple boots appeared on her legs, amazingly allowing her to run in the air temporarily. Oni completely ignored her men and fled down the mountain rapidly. She did not forget to turn around and glare at Zhao Manyan before she left, implying that she had sworn to get her revenge!

Mo Fan was not happy when the bandits started fleeing for their lives. He might have trouble stopping the Advanced Magician Oni, but the others would not be able to run away so easily.

“Maybe I shouldn’t be inflicting fear on them?” Jiang Shaoxu felt like she had overdone it with her Psychic Spell.

If the bandits kept running away, they would not be able to get their rewards!

Well, as long as they managed to arrest some of them, Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes flickered as she cast Mind Control.

Jiang Shaoxu controlled an Intermediate Ice Magician to cast Ice Lock and entrap his comrades with the ice chains.

The members of the Red Ornaments Guild were on the verge of losing their minds. The terrifying Asian did not catch them, but they were dragged back to the execution ground by their own man.

Jiang Shaoxu did not kill the bandits. Killing them was simply an easy way out for them, considering the crimes they had committed. The local government and the Enforcement Union would surely give them a more suitable punishment!

Mo Fan used both his Space and Shadow Elements simultaneously. The Giant Shadow Spikes sealed the movement of eight Magicians of the Red Ornaments Guild, and the Space Magic dragged them back like picking up little chicks...

Even though Mo Fan was trying his best, a few members of the Red Ornaments Guild still managed to get away .

After looking at the bandits that were apprehended, Mo Fan roughly counted up how many bandits there were, and asked Jiang Shaoxu to dial the hotline provided by the government.

—

The villagers were hiding on the other side of the village. After the battle came to an end, they finally had the guts to poke their heads out.

They were still terrified of Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu. After all, the two of them were killing the bandits without blinking. However, when they saw a man returning to the village with a crippled leg, they immediately realized something was off.

It was the same man that Mo Fan had tossed down the cliff! Mo Fan had used the Space Magic to greatly reduce his falling speed. The man had only broken a few bones at most, and apart from being numb from being electrocuted, his life was not in danger.

They had to fake it so the people of the Red Ornaments Guild would believe that they were not here to save the villagers! It was all to prevent the bandits from holding the villagers hostage!

“Hurry up and get the people to the shelter. The government is going to take some time to reach here. If the Red Ornaments Guild comes back, you’re going to suffer again,” Jiang Shaoxu told the villagers.

The Red Ornaments Guild was indeed savage enough to rob the village. They were no different than demon creatures, and they even insisted that they were scarier than demon creatures!

“Thank you all so much, I’m sorry for misunderstanding you at the start!” The chief knelt on the ground to express his gratitude.

The villagers fell to the ground and bowed to Mo Fan and Jiang Shaoxu gratefully.

They had heard a lot of bad rumors about the Red Ornaments Guild since they were locals. As a matter of fact, many Magicians working for the government and Hunters did not dare interfere with the Red Ornaments Guild’s business. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, these two young travelers who were not related to the village had rescued them without hesitation. How could they not be grateful? On top of that, they had wisely prevented the villagers from being hurt!

The people of the Red Ornaments Guild were a bunch of degenerates. They would start massacring the villagers if someone dared to interfere with their business!

“You all should be careful too, the people of the Red Ornaments Guild are a vengeful bunch. It’s also the main reason why they are rulers of the Caribbean Sea. Since many of them have escaped, they would surely find a way to trouble you. They have members in many places, so you should be more careful!” the chief reminded them.

“I doubt they will come again. They are only going to give me money!” Mo Fan smiled. He did not mind offending the biggest malignant tumor of the Caribbean coast at all!

To be honest, after Mo Fan had stepped on the tail of a Red Cardinal of the Black Vatican, he felt a lot more daring than before. His heart did not shiver, and even his guts had grown in size!

He did not think there was any organization in the world that was crueler and worse than the Black Vatican!
