It was not like the Federation’s army did not have their trump cards, but they had not sent their Cross Chaos Formation up to the front line earlier, trying to avoid unnecessary casualties.

The Cross Chaos Formation had three thousand Mages, but its core was formed by an Advanced Chaos Mage and ten Intermediate Chaos Mages.

The Formation resembled an enormous cross. When enemies were targeting it with destructive spells, the Formation would start spinning like a windmill.

The Mages were not moving around like a windmill, but the Chaos Magic they cast would combine into a vortex looming above the Formation. It looked like the Mages were moving within the blades of the windmill!

A colorful rain of destructive spells poured down at the Brown Rebel’s Wind Warship.

The Wind Warship immediately activated its shell. The barrier constructed by the Light Mages outlined the Wind Warship with a strong sheen of thick light..

“Seriously? Is this really the Federation Army’s trump card, simply firing their spells at will?” Zhao Manyan looked up and saw a mix of Basic Spells and Intermediate Spells pouring down from the sky.

Their enemy’s trump card was a powerful Wind Warship made up of two thousand soldiers.

The Federation Army’s Formation of three thousand soldiers seemed impressive at the first glance, but why did it feel like its strength was nowhere close to the Brown Rebels’ Wind Warship?

“Be patient, our army isn’t as weak as you think,” the man with a nose-stud spoke up.

Another wave of destructive spells came pouring down from the sky. Thousands of spells landed on the Wind Warship’s Light Shell, generating a series of deafening explosions.

The rainbow of destructive spells did not stop there. The Chaos Vortex above the Federation Army started spinning again, firing the same round of spells as before.

The Basic and Intermediate Spells kept pouring down at the Wind Warship. The Mages in the Cross Chaos Formation were Casting their spells at an impressive rate, as the pause between each round was very brief. A new wave of spells was flying across the sky even as the previous wave just landed on its target.

It was like replacing a row of Gatling guns with the next row after they had fired all their rounds!

However, the Mages of the Cross Chaos Formation were all using their magic simultaneously. They did not take turns Casting their spells.

“What’s going on? How are they able to Cast their spells so rapidly?” Zhao Manyan was astounded as the spells kept pouring down from the sky endlessly.

The problem was that most of the Mages in the army were only Basic and Intermediate Mages. Their cultivation was not strong enough to Cast spells with a single thought.

There would be time discrepancies between the Mages since the times they needed to Channel their magic was different. It was unlikely they could all fire their spells at the enemy in such rapid succession.

“It’s the Chaos Element’s Replicating Seal!” Mu Bai blurted out in astonishment.

Replicating Seal, the Advanced Spell of the Chaos Element!

The Advanced Chaos Mage had constructed a Replicating Seal while the other Chaos Mages enlarged it to cover the whole Formation.

Whenever a Mage inside the Formation cast a Basic or Intermediate Spell, the Replicating Seal would replicate the same spell instantly.

“Wait, the Chaos Element can do that?” Mo Fan’s eyes widened in shock.

Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan’s faces darkened.

Aren’t you a f**king Chaos Mage too? How can you not know the Chaos Element’s capabilities?

Is there anyone as magic illiterate as Mo Fan?

“Is the Replicating Seal duplicating the spells?” Zhao Manyan asked, interested.

“Yes, it is, hence why they are able to fire their spells so rapidly. Even if three thousand Mages are casting a Basic Spell, that would be six thousand spells after the spells are replicated!” Mu Bai said.

“That’s insane; we shouldn’t underestimate the Federation’s army either!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

Even though Mo Fan was surprised to see the Federation Army’s true strength, he was more interested in the Replicating Seal’s power.

If he was able to replicate his destructive spells...

Imagine the Replicating Seal replicating his Lightning Star Palace… it would have double the flavor!

The Replicating Seal was only an Advanced Spell, thus it would take him less energy to construct it than constructing a Lightning Palace.

It was basically buy one and get the second one at half price!

He had to learn the Replicating Seal!

His Chaos Element had long reached the Advanced Level. If the Federation’s army could learn it, why couldn’t he?

——

A regiment of three thousand Mages was already quite intimidating, but the Replicating Seal had turned it into a regiment of six thousand Mages. Even the Brown Rebels’ Wind Warship was struggling to fend it off.

The assault troops had gradually seized the fort. The fort was the Wind Warship’s foundation. It was on the verge of collapsing after losing its foundation.

The large Wind Warship finally crumbled to the ground after a few more rounds of spells.

A few hundred Wind Mages had already left the Wind Warship and fled for their lives to the west.

The replicated spells circled in the sky and chased after those who were running away.

The Brown Rebels of the Cold Storage Fort ended up running away miserably. The fort they had made eventually collapsed to the ground.

These temporary forts were mostly constructed by Earth Mages who were specialized builders with readily available material nearby. As a matter of fact, it would be quicker to take down the fort by hunting down the builders.

Unfortunately, the builders were important assets to an army. They would rather lose a Wind Warship just to guarantee those men’s safety. They were surely under the Brown Rebels’ heavy protection.

——

The Federation Army quickly built sentry towers in the vicinity after reclaiming the cold storage marketplace, raising their flags around the marketplace.

Those flags were very important. After all, there were other regiments fighting the Brown Rebels in Banlo City. They could retreat to the places where their flags waved when necessary.

Most surprisingly, the regiment at the cold market storage was the first to take down one of the Brown Rebels’ hardpoints. Many soldiers of the Federation Army came to the cold storage marketplace to catch their breaths. The regiment under Colonel Blair’s leadership grew bigger as a result.

—

“HAHA, Major Mason, you are truly talented at leading an assault! If it weren’t for your brave men who were willing to sacrifice their lives to take down the enemies, we wouldn’t have been able to take down the fortress so quickly. Our casualties are a lot lower compared to other regiments,” Colonel Blair exclaimed with great excitement.

“It was a blessing from Forneus. I didn’t expect my men and I to survive the battle.” The apish Major Mason glanced at his surviving senior sergeants.

There were not many survivors among his troops, but the three who claimed to be students from the Aorus Sacred Institute’s branch were perfectly fine.

It was unbelievable! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Besides, judging from Colonel Blair’s tone, it sounded like they were going to be promoted again!
