The Bird Emperor lifted off higher into the sky. It quickly arrived directly above Mo Fan.

Mo Fan looked up. He first thought the Bird Emperor looked like a cloud blocking his view of the sky, yet for some reason, the creature’s figure kept growing in his vision, like it was about to cover the entire world!

It felt like the creature was a god of the night who had just opened up his mantle. The darkness was slowly absorbing the night sky and soon spread over the entire area above Mo Fan. The Bird Emperor was somehow as enormous as the night sky, while Mo Fan was as tiny as a dust particle under the mantle of darkness. He was suddenly overwhelmed by fear.

The starry night sky was looming right over Mo Fan as the creature began to fall. It was as terrifying as the sky collapsing onto him.

Mo Fan had experienced all kinds of illusions. When he saw the Bird Emperor enlarging, he thought it was just a trick to put him under pressure, a visual illusion to trick the enemy’s mind and render them defenseless.

However, when the Bird Emperor dove at him, he suddenly lost his sight. A pain like he was being crushed flowed through his body, as if he had just been slammed into the ground. The feeling of suffocation and his bones being crushed felt so real!

“What kind of ability is this?”

Mo Fan was completely lost in darkness. He had lost his vision and his hearing. He was drowned in silence, while his body was being squeezed as if he was being forced to lie in a sturdy, cold, and narrow casket!

Mo Fan began to panic a little. He was struggling to identify if he was experiencing an illusion or if he had actually fallen into the Bird Emperor’s strange Domain. He tried to unleash his magic and scream, but his efforts were in vain. He was like the lingering consciousness of a spirit who had died physically!

Time gradually passed, but Mo Fan still could not find a way out. No matter how tough Mo Fan was mentally, no matter how much he believed everything was just a mere illusion, the torture, confined space, pressure, and the sense of emptiness were starting to get on his nerves. He felt like he was going to be driven mad soon!

“This cannot continue, there must be a way out. It must be some kind of a mental cage. I can’t allow my consciousness to be locked inside this dark casket!” Mo Fan did not give up. He knew his will was the key to overcoming any magic that was targeting his mind. It was similar to the Scorpion Lord Medusa’s stony gaze that he had faced in the past. It had Sealed his mind and corrupted his heart, putting him into a self-destruction mode!

Mo Fan would not allow his mind to be trapped in a dead end. He was trying his best to recall everything that happened before he ended up here.

He remembered the Bird Emperor was extending its wings like the mantle of the God of the Night. The wings were so huge that even the mountains felt tiny. They loomed over the sea like a huge cloud, and when he looked up, his gaze was fixed on the irresistible figure. His vision soon failed as he fell into the darkness...

“There’s no way it could grow so big, but why did the brilliance of the stars and the moon disappear when I looked up?” Mo Fan did not stop thinking.

Why did the light disappear in advance when the Bird Emperor’s body was not big enough to cover the entire sky?...

Didn’t that indicate the light was unable to pass through when it was using the ability?

“Shadow Magic! It has the Shadow Element!”

Mo Fan finally realized the truth. The huge mantle of darkness was exactly the same as the Nyx Regime, trapping its target in complete darkness. The Bird Emperor was not necessarily targeting his mind. It was simply erasing the light that was shining on him by Sealing him off within a wall of darkness!

—

The dark sky had a slight hint of blue when it was viewed from its reflection on the surface of the sea. A black curtain was now surrounding Mo Fan like a triangular prism as the Manta Ray Bird Emperor hovered above him. The strange glow of the curtain was coming out of its body. It was bound to Mo Fan’s soul.

However, when Mo Fan realized it was made up of Shadow Magic, he found the weak spot on the wall. He was able to break down the wall of darkness trapping him by focusing on the weak spot!

Mo Fan stepped through the crack. He was still covered in a layer of dark energy, which slowly dissipated. The faint glow of the stars and the icy moon shone upon him once again. The fires of his soul that were put out a moment ago erupted instantly as he regained his will to fight!

“I didn’t expect it to be a Shadow Mage, too!” Mo Fan glanced into the sky. He grinned as he saw the dark energy encapsulating the Bird Emperor.

The creature was even more fitting to be his mount!

The Bird Emperor uttered a cry like a dolphin. It was not the screech of a bird, but a cry that touched the soul. It was like a hint of grief from the voice of a singer!

The Bird Emperor was successfully provoked. It felt like its pride was on the line!

“Show me your true strength. Otherwise, you won’t be able to prove your worthiness to be my mount!” Mo Fan was even prouder. He pointed at the Bird Emperor so it could feel how confident he was in his own strength.

The Manta Ray Bird Emperor swung its tail to wave the chain binding it around.

The Bird Emperor was facing the sky while its tail was pointed at the island. It let out another cry, like it was Summoning the darkness from above. The cry which could touch anyone’s soul echoed across the whole sky and the sea!

The Manta Ray Evil Birds nearby were further enraged upon hearing that cry. They began to charge at the mountain recklessly, even if it meant crashing into the net of icy thorns which Mu Bai had set up. They wanted to assist their Emperor, even if they were covered in wounds!

“What now? You’re sending your men after me instead? What a letdown!” Mo Fan said when he saw the Bird Emperor’s reaction.

Creatures of its level were able to understand human speech slightly, regardless of whether they had lived with humans before!

The Bird Emperor’s cry was still echoing in the sky. While Mo Fan thought it was Summoning its people, something like a white piece of cloth started falling from the sky.

Mo Fan took a closer look at it and realized it was a fierce wave falling from the clouds above. It was spectacular and stunning!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
