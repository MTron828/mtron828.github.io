“We’ve borne your arrogance long enough! We didn’t bother intervening because we simply assumed you to be a mad dog. It’s unnecessary to be so fussy over a mad dog, but you have seriously infuriated us! We can get rid of you anytime!” Mu Tingying pointed at Mo Fan disdainfully.

She was no longer afraid of Mo Fan’s powerful magic. Her Soul-grade Ice Seed was able to perfectly suppress Mo Fan’s flames. Even if Mo Fan was to summon his powerful Contracted Beast, it was still hard to tell who was going to win in the end, not to mention that she had three other people siding with her!

They had long allied, as they were all afraid of being bitten by Mo Fan, the mad dog!

“You piece of shit, I was going to take care of you after the World College Tournament, but I don’t mind doing it now, since you’re so eager to die!” Zu Jiming laughed coldly.

Mo Fan stood there. Even after knowing that the four had teamed up against him, the wild expression on his face remained the same.

“Mo Fan, we’ll lend you a hand,” Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and Jiang Shaoxu could not bear to just stand and watch. They immediately stepped forward.

Mo Fan reached out his hand and signaled the three to stop.

“I’ll handle it myself,” Mo Fan did not let the three take part in the fight.

Mo Fan was here to turn Mu Tingying and Nanrong Ni, the two detestable b**ches, into cripples. It was only going to end up in a mess, and if Jiang Yu, Zhao Manyan, and Jiang Shaoxu were involved too, it would simply bring troubles to their factions.

“Mo Fan...”

Mo Fan did not say anything further. He started walking toward the group of four instead.

As Mo Fan went closer, the flames on him were thoroughly suppressed by Mu Tingying’s Soul-grade Ice Seed. Eventually, he was no longer engulfed in the imperious flames. A layer of frost was even forming on him.

“Do you two useless pricks seriously think you can stop me?” Mo Fan spat in an incredibly disdainful tone, glancing at Zu Jiming and Li Kaifeng!

“You’re f**king dead!” Zu Jiming was enraged immediately.

“We’ll take him on together!” Nanrong Ni reminded the others.

No one could possibly win against Mo Fan in a solo fight. Nanrong Ni would not allow Mo Fan to provoke her team so they would act recklessly.

Cripple them? How bold of him to say that? She had no idea where the maniac had gotten his confidence from!

“I’ll take care of his flames and Flame Belle!” Mu Tingying said.

The frost grew stronger as bodies of ice like vines extended toward Mo Fan rapidly. The spikes on the vines were deadly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Poison Fangs!” Zu Jiming’s eyes glittered. Two enormous, poisonous fangs appeared behind Mo Fan, penetrating into his back like an invisible, deadly python.

Li Kaifeng cast his spell too. His Giant Shadow Spikes vanished in the air, hiding behind the icy vines and poisonous fangs to ambush Mo Fan.

As for Nanrong Ni, she was at the back of the team, murmuring to strengthen their spells with her Blessing Element.

“Space Wall!” Mo Fan finished casting his spell in an instant. A rhomboid space appeared around him with six sides, providing Mo Fan full protection.

The power of the Space Element was heavily dependent on the Mage’s spiritual strength, and because Mo Fan currently had six different Elements, his spiritual strength totally outmatched his opponents’. The defense from the Intermediate Spell Space Rhythm was enough to protect him from their attacks!

“I was right to call you guys useless; are you really still trying to probe my strength in a situation like this?” Mo Fan sneered, easily nullifying the approaching attacks.

Mo Fan was not in the mood for this. He would rather be in a duel of life and death against the group of four. He did not have time to waste on having a friendly duel with them!

They had hurt Mu Ningxue badly, forcing her to disappear from Venice. Mo Fan never allowed her to feel any sadness, yet these scum dared to team up and bully Mu Ningxue when he was away!?

Did they seriously think they stood a chance against him by teaming up!?

Did they really think a Soul-grade Ice Seed was enough to suppress his flames and defeat him?

A bunch of idiots with low intelligence and personalities, he would not mind giving them a taste of the anger of the Lightning Tyrant!

“Lightning!” Mo Fan withdrew his fire and let out a furious roar, looking into the clear sky above Venice!

Wild black lightning arcs danced thickly around Mo Fan in a spectacular manner!

The flickers of lightning that left Mo Fan immediately surged across the training ground! Some collided into the barrier in the distance with destructive force!

When Mu Tingying was still feeling proud of her Soul-grade Ice Seed when she noticed a lightning bolt coming straight at her. Its overwhelming power immediately shattered the ice she had formed across the place into pieces!

Most importantly, she could feel that the Ice Element around her fleeing in terror. Her Ice Magic had weakened significantly!

“How is this possible...” Mu Tingying looked at Mo Fan in disbelief and saw a wild, black Domain made of lightning bursting out from Mo Fan.

Suppressed!

Her Soul-grade Seed was being suppressed! It turned out that her opponent had a Soul-grade Lightning Seed, and to her utter surprise, Mo Fan’s Soul-grade Seed had a Domain!

One could easily tell if a Soul-grade Seed had a Domain or not. The whole place was covered in the strong presence of the Lightning Magic, to the extent that the Ice Magic could only hide timidly in a little corner. It was extremely difficult to control!

Mu Tingying, Li Kaifeng, Zu Jiming, and Nanrong Ni felt like they were about to suffocate from the extreme pressure from the lightning. Their eyes were filled with astonishment and terror!

A Soul-grade Seed!

Their enemy also had a Soul-grade Seed, and it was the utterly imperious kind, a Soul-grade Lightning Seed!

However, their confidence totally crumbled when they realized that Mo Fan’s Soul-grade Lightning Seed also had a Domain!

A Mage with a Domain was basically going to be one of the strongest of their age. How did Mo Fan even get a Soul-grade Seed, when he did not even have a formidable faction supporting him?

“Sky Lightning Claw!”

Mo Fan clenched his hands into claws. A sharp, black claw descended from the clear sky and landed fiercely between the four of them.

The formation of the group, that had looked unbreakable at the start of the fight, immediately crumbled when they fled for their lives after seeing how terrifying the Sky Lightning Claw was. None of them dared to face the powerful lightning attack directly!

The Sky Lightning Claw was absolutely shocking, even stronger than the Silent Deadly Bolt, and more terrifyingly, the damage of Mo Fan’s lightning spells had tripled after he obtained the Soul-grade Lightning Seed!

In the past, his Spirit-grade Seed, Qianjun was only twice as strong as an ordinary Seed. It was a standard Spirit-grade Lightning Seed, but the Lightning Tyrant was not merely an ordinary Soul-grade Lightning Seed, it was the strongest kind of all! The three times amplification of his Lightning Spells was enough to grant even his Intermediate Spells awesome destructive power, let alone his Advanced Spells!

Even a Commander-level Wind Flame Lightning Vulture had trouble resisting the Sky Lightning Claw. It was unlikely that the fragile body of a human would be able to endure it without the help of defensive equipment!

Mo Fan had destroyed the formation of the group with his first Sky Lightning Claw. However, Mo Fan aimed his second Sky Lightning Claw at Zu Jiming. If he was targeting Nanrong Ni and Mu Tingying, it was necessary to take out their two annoying subordinates first!

Zu Jiming’s primary Element was Poison. He was fairly reliable when using some little tricks on his target while under the protection of the team. However, he was simply no match when going up against a Mage like Mo Fan!

The Sky Lightning Claw easily pierced through Zu Jiming’s defense and tore his seemingly sturdy flesh open.

Zu Jiming fled for his life when he sensed that his life was in danger.

He was extremely scared of dying. He had no choice but to run when facing such an overwhelming power.

However, how could Mo Fan possibly let him go so easily when he was on a tantrum?

“Tyrant Call!” Mo Fan uttered before Zu Jiming could run out of his Domain. Hissing, crackling arcs of lightning immediately surged in Zu Jiming’s direction like a living carpet.

Mo Fan’s Lightning Spells had triple their base strength, and the Thunderbolt was currently in the fourth-tier. As such, the damage of the Lightning Tyrant Scars was not to be underestimated, either. Since Zu Jiming’s armor was already torn to pieces by the Sky Lightning Claw, the Tyrant Call immediately knocked him to the ground!

He was entirely scorched black with bleeding, blackened wounds. He looked like a lump of rotten meat from a distance, motionless on the ground. It was difficult to tell if the man was still alive. Regardless, he could no longer rise back up and fight.

“It’s your turn next!” Mo Fan’s eyes flickered with lightning, and locked onto Li Kaifeng as if he was marking attendance.

“You’ve left me with no choice!” Li Kaifeng had an icy grin as his veins started to expand suddenly.

“Do you really think I’m going to let you cast that forbidden magic? Idiot!” Mo Fan flung his arm out, and the long lightning claw slapping Li Kaifeng right in the face.

Li Kaifeng was able to react fairly quickly, since he possessed the Wind and Shadow Elements. He evaded slightly better than Guan Yu.

“Space Rhythm: Gravity!” Mo Fan spread his palm and unleashed a gravitational space, entrapping Li Kaifeng. “Death Ray!” Mo Fan followed up coldly. The deadly ray was fired directly at Li Kaifeng, who was still struggling to break free from the gravitational space!
