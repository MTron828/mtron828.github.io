Yao Nan was spiraling in the air above the army’s perimeter. His gaze was fixed ahead, as he finally saw a group of phantom-like creatures in white among the dense army of undead!

The creatures in white clothes had pale faces. Their half-illusionary figures were able to move past anything. On top of that, they were not walking along but hovering in the air...

“I see you!” Yao Nan grinned coldly.

The army was advancing at full speed. The Fire Magicians had become the main firepower for the whole army. As Fiery Fists with wide coverage were thrown forward, there was burning blood and flesh scattering everywhere in the air. The fiery explosions left the scorched land with countless blast craters.

“The group of Light Magicians is in front of us regrouping with other troops!” called down Heavenly Eagle Battlemage who was spiraling in the air above the army.

They could see troops of Magicians in various directions among the black tide of zombies. The colorful glow when spells were cast served as the brightest flags to identify the friendlies, telling the other troops that they were moving toward their assigned destination!

At the Intermediate Level, Fire Magicians still played an important role, since the Fire Element was not as difficult to Awaken as the Lightning Element. On top of that, the Fire Element was the most effective in a wide-scale war like this due to its wide area of effect. The blazing red fire carpet laid out as the troops began to merge with one another was like a path towards hope for the humans.

The undead’s greatest weakness was Light, followed by Fire. As flames erupted and burned the land, the brain-dead Servant-class zombies would simply walk into the flames and set themselves on fire.

The magical flames could last for some time. A zombie on fire would eventually be turned into a scorched corpse, no longer posing any threat to the living.

The bright flames were the only comfort the human army could find when they were right in the middle of the undead army. Everyone was searching for the light produced by the spells, the righteous flames that countless Intermediate Magicians had summoned, just so they would not lose their direction on the path toward death!

“The other troops have arrived at their positions. Take a look at how slow your men are...” said Yao Nan.

“The other troops consisted of well-trained Battlemages. They are a lot better compared to us that were put together at the very last second!” replied Jiang Li unpleasantly.

Yao Nan ignored Jiang Li’s grumble. His eyes were suddenly fixed on a huge black mist rising from the undead army.

The black mist was rolling toward the humans like a sandstorm. Its target was the Magicians that had yet to arrive at their positions. Yao Nan discovered that the undead were actually clearing a path for the black sandstorm!

“Something big is coming!” screamed the Heavenly Eagle Battlemage in the sky.

As soon as the Heavenly Eagle Battlemage gave the heads up, a flesh-colored tentacle sprang out from the black sandstorm into the air!

It looked like a tongue, or an arm, or more like a lump of meat able to extend infinitely. The weird thing was incredibly fast. Before anyone could react, it stabbed right through the Heavenly Eagle that the Battlemage was riding on.

The Heavenly Eagle did not even have time to cry out in pain. Its body stiffened after suffering the deadly blow, and started twitching out of nowhere soon after.

The fleshy tentacle suddenly pulsed like a huge straw. It was obvious that something was being transferred to the black sandstorm. At the same time, the Heavenly Eagle withered and dried out.

Its feathers had also lost their color, as if there was simply a layer of skin covered in feathers that had rotted for many years on a corpse with only its skeleton left. The Heavenly Eagle’s life force was completely sucked dry within a few seconds, now looking like it was air-dried after hanging for many years at a certain spot!

The Heavenly Eagle Battlemage fell from his mount with a pale face full of terror. “It’s...it’s a Corpse Official!”

The Heavenly Eagle Battlemage was lucky to survive the attack, but his Heavenly Eagle was thoroughly dead. If the tentacle had punctured any of his body parts, he would have been turned into a dried corpse too!

“A Commander-level undead? Are you serious? We actually stumbled into a Commander-level undead?” a retired Battlemage bleated out.

They were not afraid of Corpse Generals, since as long as they all cast Intermediate Spells focusing on the same target, they would instantly eliminate the Corpse General without leaving its bones behind. After all, their team consisted of over forty talented Intermediate Magicians, and more than ten of them possessed the Fire Element!

However, a Corpse Official was a completely different story. Even if they had twice the number of Intermediate Magicians, a single Commander-level undead would crush the seemingly unbeatable group of Intermediate Magicians within a few minutes.

Once a group lost its formation, the undead army would surround the Magicians. It would not be long until the Magicians died under the filthy, disgusting fangs of the undead!

“We’re only a few steps away from regrouping with the other squads, but we happened to stumble into a Corpse Official here! What do we do now? We only have an Advanced Magician in our group. Even though we might stand a chance if we all focus on killing the Corpse Official, there are still several hundreds or even thousands of zombies flanking us from all directions. If all our firepower is used to handle the Commander-level undead, the zombies will eventually drag us away...” one of the Magicians from the Magic Association blurted out in fear.

Commander-level undead were a nightmare to them. Just a single one was enough to bring death upon the whole team.

“What should we do now? Are we going to die here? I don’t want to die!”

“Send a signal, quick, let’s ask the other squads for help. They have lots of Advanced Magicians!”

“Captain, send a signal to ask for help quickly. The black sandstorm is getting closer. I don’t want my life force being sucked dry like that...”

The Magicians were already panicking. The death of the Heavenly Eagle haunted every single one of them. They could not help but shiver when they imagined their blood, flesh, and organs being sucked dry by the tentacle like a straw!

“Humph, useless pricks, not only are you all slow when advancing, you’re also cowardly compared to the regular army. If I knew how useless you all were since the beginning, I wouldn’t have bothered firing the Assembling Signal... continue to press forward!” mocked Yao Nan while flapping his wings.

“Captain, that is easy for you to say...”

“If you have the time to speak nonsense there, why don’t you draw a few more Star Patterns instead! I’ll deal with the Corpse Official in the black sandstorm. Just focus on advancing forward!” Yao Nan said in a cold voice instead of his usual feminine manner. He glanced across the crowd. When he saw Mo Fan’s group regrouping with the troop, he immediately said, “Vice Captain, come with me, let’s go kill that Corpse Official!”

“F**k you, I just came back!” yelled Mo Fan like an enraged lion, still panting heavily.
