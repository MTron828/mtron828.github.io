3009 Unforgivable

Jerome looked at Tulce in bewilderment. Tulce trembled. He looked terrified.

“What have you done to Greenbud City?” asked Jerome in surprise.

“I…”

“You can take your time to confess to the residents of Greenbud City.” Xinxia signaled Hua Lisi to push her forward.

!!

Tulce went from arrogant to terrified within minutes. He was at a loss. He was so lost that his heart was full of regret, and he descended into a crazed frenzy.

Countless people died in the tragedy of Greenbud City. In just one night, all of Greece lived in the fear of the Tyrant Titan’s massacre. When the tragedy happened, Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai were in Greece. It was at that time that Tulce and Mo Fan fought to settle the issue. After an investigation, Ye Xinxia discovered the evidence to Tulce’s crime.

How did the leader of the Outlaws control the Tyrant Titan with an evil spell?

The Tyrant Titan was an ancient god, but it was as savage as a demon. Still, its divinity remained. Without the help of a certain special power, nothing could enslave it!

The Tulce family mastered that special power. The special power was passed down to generations of the Tulce family.

Tulce taught the leader of the Outlaws the ancient mind-controlling spell so that the leader could control the Tyrant Titan, which eventually led to the Greenbud City’s tragedy.

“I have the evidence of you instructing Dick’s military attaché to help you cover up the horrible crime,” Hua Lisi said to Tulce.

Tulce looked as if someone had sucked his soul away. He almost fainted on the spot.

It was the pope from the Arian Church. He was the desperado who owned the Tyrant Titan’s Black Turbid Moon.

Little did Tulce know that his close friend who taught him to live a life of debauchery was the pope of the Arian Church. He also did not know the outsider would master the God Controlling Art completely. None of his family members had learnt to do that!

His friend had taken control of the Tyrant Titan.

Tulce was still unaware of it when the tragedy in Greenbud City happened. It was only after he learned the issue in depth that he realized his recklessness had led to this blunder!

Imparting the knowledge of the Tulce family’s magic to others was absolutely forbidden. This was a taboo, and it had caused such a horrible incident!

The Tulce family’s reputation was ruined.

The Greeks hated them so much that they would willingly transform into wild beasts and tear them apart!

Jerome finally knew Young Master Tulce had committed a great sin. He quickly dragged Tulce before Xinxia and said, “Get up! Kneel in front of her! Now!”

Young Master Tulce was so shocked. His body was drenched in sweat. A while ago, he was arrogant and showed no respect. But now, he wished he could bury his head before Xinxia’s shoes and seek her forgiveness.

“I really had no idea he was the pope of an evil cult. Ye Xinxia… No, I mean, My Lady, please, don’t make this matter public—” Young Master Tulce’s expression alternated between remorse, fear, and humility.

Xinxia stared at him icily. She did not say anything.

Jerome was Tulce’s elder. He knew how to save Tulce.

“We’ll change our oath. We will swear to pledge our loyalty to you. Young Master Tulce has made a horrible mistake. He will do everything to make up for his mistake. Please spare him this one time!” said Jerome.

“I’m not in the position to pardon your sins. Go and confess your sins to everyone in Greenbud City now! Let Izisha decide how to sentence you,” said Xinxia.

“My Lady!” Jerome cried out.

Xinxia let Hua Lisi continue to push her forward. She was greeted by the sight of the mourning crowd of Greenbud City.

“My Lady, Tulce is willing to pledge his loyalty to you. It can tilt the scale to your favor. This is the key for you to become the goddess!” Tata said with a great sense of urgency.

If Xinxia could forgive Young Master Tulce in exchange for his family’s absolute loyalty to her, this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!

“The Golden Sun Knights swore an oath this morning. They will protect Greece and its people. They will not spare even one savage Tyrant Titan that tramples our city or our land. The Tulce family is no longer trustworthy, so the Golden Sun Knights will take up the guardianship. From now on, the Tulce family will be struck off the Parthenon Temple!”

Ye Xinxia spoke with unprecedented solemnity and indifference. She could not afford to keep a family who did not take the citizens’ safety seriously in the Parthenon Temple. She could not forgive people like this!

Jerome, Young Master Tulce and Tata knelt on the floor. They hoped they could convince Ye Xinxia.

But Ye Xinxia did not even bother to turn and look at them.

With Hua Lisi’s help, she arrived at the memorial platform and faced tens and thousands of residents of Greenbud City. They were the deceased’s kith and kin.

Xinxia faced the people and said, “I’ve been through a suffering similar to yours. I almost died. At that time, I coiled up inside a small fridge and thirsted for even a glimmer of hope.”

suffering like you all, and I almost died.

“I can never forget the torture even today. The long agony of gasping for air in the middle of fear.”

Xinxia had personally experienced disasters. She had witnessed tragedies under Blood Alert. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Tata and the rest did not understand why Xinxia did not take advantage of this opportunity to subdue the Tulce family. By doing so, she would stand a higher chance of winning the goddess campaign.

Xinxia could temporarily put aside her original intention, but she would not give up on it. If she were to forgive this type of person to become the goddess, she would feel disgusted at herself.

…

In the end, Xinxia exposed the identity of the main culprit, Young Master Tulce.

After she made his name and his deed public, the prestige of the Tulce family would be ruined. They would live the rest of their lives as street rats. They would be despised and humiliated.

They deserved it. They did not deserve sympathy.

If they showed pity to the Tulce family, who would show compassion to the countless bodies buried in the deep underwater pits of Greenbud City?

…

The goddess had the power to strike the Tulce family off the list.

If both of the saintesses agreed that the Tulce family was not qualified to stay in the Parthenon Temple, then they could remove the Tulce family from the Parthenon Temple!

Young Master Tulce was held in custody.

Jerome and a cadre of elders kneeled before the Hall of Saintess. They waited under the scorching sunlight, hoping they could see Izisha just for once.

Izisha was in charge of the Hall of Judgment. Hence, she would be the final judge in this case. She would decide if she wanted to strike their names off the list, or to condemn them or let them stay.

Xinxia decided to strike their names off.

Of course, Izisha could overrule Xinxia’s decision. The person who had the ruling points had the power of internal enforcement.

“My Lady, why did you refuse to see them? They have been kneeling on the staircase all day. If you spare them, they will swear to support you till their deaths. The Tulce family is still very powerful. It’s their eldest young master who did something wrong. You don’t have to impose such a heavy sentence on them. They can work hard to redeem themselves and regain the citizens’ acknowledgement,” said Mera to Izisha.

“Hmph! Ye Xinxia is very kind-hearted. If I were her, I would have beheaded him and his clan’s heads!” said Izisha.

“Um—”

“Tell them to f*ck off! Otherwise, use their blood to clean the dust on the staircase!”
