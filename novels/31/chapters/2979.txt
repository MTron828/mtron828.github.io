2980 The Angel’s Trap

Lingling and Mo Fan both raised their heads to look up at the sky at the same time. They were startled when they noticed golden light wisps rising from the horizons coming from six different directions. Before cutting through the sky above the Sacrificial Mountain, the golden light formed an arch over the celestial sphere.

“What are they?” Lingling asked in surprise.

That was an extraordinary level of power. She’d never witnessed such magnificent magic. It looked like there were six divine golden threads that had separated the world into parts. It also looked like a bird cage that had covered the boundless and vast land of Japan!

Mo Fan frowned. He used his dragon sense to explore the magnificent magic. Soon, he understood everything.

“Lingling, save the rest of the people inside the East Guardian Towers. The Red Demon is dead. The Blood Demons have nowhere to hide themselves,” said Mo Fan to Lingling.

“But those things above the sky seem to be coming for you,” said Lingling.

“Yes, they are coming for me. In fact, the barrier of the forbidden system of the Twin Guardian Towers had targeted me from the beginning,” Mo Fan said wryly.

“What are you going to do, then?”

“Don’t worry about me. With my current form, no one can defeat me.” Mo Fan stroked Lingling’s hair affectionately.

“You say the same thing all the time, but in the end, it’s still…” Lingling said in a huff.

“Go now! The battle is unavoidable. It’s either they kill me, or I kill them!” said Mo Fan.

Lingling stared at Mo Fan. She wondered why he looked so calm despite noticing the strange light. She had a sensation of oppression as she anticipated a battle.

‘What did Mo Fan have to confront now that he was a Wicked God?’

Was he going to face those who were unshakeable in this world, or did he no longer fit in this world?

“This happens all the time! Every single time!” cried Lingling.

“Lingling…”

“You still remember what I said to you at Canton Tower?!” Lingling wiped away her tears. Mo Fan felt helpless.

“If you die, I’ll live a life that you’ll hate to see the most!”

How could Mo Fan ever forget her words? If Lingling truly lived a life like that, the Cold Hunting King would never be able to rest in peace.

“Lingling…” Mo Fan watched her preparing to walk down the mountain. He was reluctant to be separated from her.

Lingling had looked at him sternly a few moments ago. When Mo Fan called her, she turned back and threw herself into his arms. She wrapped her hands tightly around him.

“Mo Fan, you can’t die! You must live. I don’t care if everyone thinks you are a demonic killer. I don’t care if you don’t fit into this world anymore. You have to stay alive. We all know who you are. We understand that everything you do is for the world.” Lingling’s voice grew increasingly emotional. Her tears streamed down her face.

Lingling knew what Mo Fan was about to face. He was about to embark on the same path as Zhan Kong. He stood in opposition to the Holy City and the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance.

He had become a threat to the world. He was treated as an uncontrollable factor who refused to work alongside the corrupted Holy City system. The Holy City wanted to eliminate people like him.

“I promise you that I will stay alive,” he said.

Lingling left him reluctantly. The six wisps of golden threads on the horizons were getting closer. The Sacrificial Mountain looked as if it had been grasped by God’s invisible, gigantic hand.

The mountain was in the middle of the deformation. The mountain forest was crushed into powder.

Flocks of birds fled in panic. When their black, tiny silhouettes reached a certain height in the sky, they fell all of a sudden.

“Go now!”

Mo Fan pushed Lingling gently forward. It was only then that she ran down the mountain.

…

Mo Fan felt complicated as he watched her leave.

The Twin Guardian Towers were a cage. It had been a trap since the beginning. It was a trap set for him and it had waited patiently for him to fall into it.

He would have been fine had he not attempted to dabble into the Forbidden Curse realm.

His Demon Element was an unstable element. With the additional protection of the Azure Dragon and the other totem beasts, he was seen as a heretic who needed to be exterminated.

‘A heretic… Hah!’

It had been a couple of years since he finally set foot on this path.

He remembered what the man had said to him that night in the prosperous Holy City. “This is my fight.”

Mo Fan could not do anything about it. All he did was watch Zhan Kong and Qin Yu’Er make their final decision to back off and leave the world to those numbskulls.

Finally, he had his own fight. This time, Mo Fan made his own choice.

“Come, show me what the Holy City has got!”

Mo Fan stood on top of the Sacrificial Mountain. He stood in the middle of the ancient forbidden system. He shouted the words to the sky.

He knew about the origin of the magnificent cage. He was also aware of the consequences of his decision.

“That’s outrageous, demon! You used the Red Demon as your pawn and committed heinous crimes across the world. You did all this so that you could become the Wicked God. Do you know how many innocent lives you’ve killed with your filthy souls? Your sins will not be pardoned. Even the East Guardian Towers cannot put up with a criminal like you. We must take you back to the Holy City in chains. The Holy Judge from the Holy City will punish you on Judgment Day!” A high-pitched voice rang out from the sky.

Mo Fan noticed a tall individual with a pair of long wings in the middle of the night. The figure wore boots that belonged to a Holy Judge. The person was clad in olden armor. The pitch-black night became as bright as day upon the figure’s appearance.

It was an angel! It was an angel from the Holy City! He had finally revealed himself!

“Mr. Monk, I didn’t expect you to have a part-time job here.” Mo Fan grinned. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The monk who stood guard over the mountain had removed his ragged robe and put on an angelic military outfit. His current aura was completely different from his previous ordinary outlook as a monk. He exuded an air of divinity and did not look like an ordinary mortal at all!

“I am the Archangel Shalitha. My mortal job is to be the guardian of the mountain.” The Archangel Shalitha was fair, but his gaze was razor-sharp. No one could look into his eyes.

“Since you took up a mortal job, you already know how I became the Wicked God. You are also aware that the Red Demon Kazuaki is the one that committed all the heinous crimes,” said Mo Fan as he looked up to face the unearthly experts in the sky.

“How do you explain the incident in Dubai? The civilians died because of the war that you started!” Shalitha questioned Mo Fan.

“It was Su Lu who killed them.”

“You don’t have the right to use the power beyond the boundary in the city.” Shalitha’s words invited no room for negotiation.

“Are we only going to have a verbal fight, then?”

“So, you want to go against an Archangel’s orders?” Shalitha sneered.

“I can come with you without a fight. In fact, I long to visit the Holy City Archangel’s Hall,” said Mo Fan arrogantly.
