“The demon leeches aren’t the only parasites on Qiu Chi’s body. There’s also another species of demon grasshoppers with extremely high temperature,” Zhang Xiaohou reminded them.

“Baxia and these two creatures are arch-enemies. As a matter of fact, the Disastrous Duo is part of the reason why it went to Japan. Qiu Chi’s strength is in fact inferior to Baxia’s because of his godly shell. It’s unlikely for Qiu Chi and Qiu Zi will be able to harm him, but sometime in these last few dozen years, Qiu Chi obtained a strange power that makes the parasites in its body a lot stronger. These never-ending parasites keep corroding Baxia’s skin and shell. During their last encounter, Baxia left the East China Sea with serious injuries. He has been disguising himself as an island close to the land for a long time...” Zhao Manyan said.

Baxia had always been searching for a suitable Totem Guardian. Most Totem Beasts had obtained their power from humans through the Totem Containers.

The East China Sea was Baxia’s territory. He had been expelled to other oceans after Qiu Chi and Qiu Zi took over his territory. He no longer had a fixed place to stay. Most importantly, a Totem Beast would never allow itself to be a wanderer, valuing its pride.

Baxia needed more power, so he kept urging Zhao Manyan to grow stronger.

Only when Zhao Manyan grew stronger would he be able to lift the Totem Seal and Awaken Baxia’s true strength!

This time, Baxia had returned to his territory and was daring enough to challenge the Disastrous Duo because Zhao Manyan had reached the Super Level and acquired the Totem Power from the remains of the Totem Beast at the bottom of the sea. It had helped to improve Baxia’s strength!

“Baxia, we’ll take care of the insects for you, but you should protect us too. We are on your back!” Zhao Manyan told Baxia.

Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, and Zhao Manyan landed on Baxia’s back. It actually felt like an island to them considering the amount of space they had. It was an extremely spacious dueling ground!

Baxia made some noise, most likely to acknowledge Zhao Manyan’s words.

“He will protect us if Qiu Chi and Qiu Zi attack us,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Brother Fan, look, what is Qiu Zi doing?” Zhang Xiaohou pointed at the strait.

Mo Fan looked where Zhang Xiaohou was pointing and saw Qiu Zi staying in the water. However, it had straightened its head while emitting strange sound waves into the clouds.

Mo Fan could not hear the sound waves, yet his brain kept buzzing in pain.

“It’s Calling!” the Sound Mage who was commanding the battle blurted out.

The best thing was that the pain in Mo Fan’s head disappeared after he heard the Sound Mage’s voice.

“What is it Summoning?” Mo Fan asked after he felt a lot better.

“Sea monsters, it’s Summoning every sea monster in this region!” the Sound Mage said.

Mo Fan glanced at the device on his wrist. There was not much time left until the eight hours mark.

Mo Fan had a clear view when standing on Baxia’s back. He noticed countless waves rising around him. There were sea monsters riding the waves toward them, regardless of the direction he was looking in!

“They are trying to destroy the bridge with everything they have!” the advisor in a silver outfit said.

“These scum, are they really treating us as their food? This is unacceptable, we won’t let them leave in one piece since they dared to invade our land!” the Super Mage in the blue outfit snarled.

“You guys, aren’t you going to tell us what exactly is that enormous brown beast first!?” the female advisor said.

Mo Fan looked at the advisors. The female advisor was most likely the leader of the Donghai Magic Association. He recalled seeing her on Gulangyu before.

“It’s a Totem Beast. Councilman Shao Zheng sent the few of us to search for the Totem Beasts that had been lost to resolve the crisis along the shoreline. His name is Baxia...” Mo Fan explained, but Qiu Chi suddenly pounced at them in the middle of his sentence. Its enormous claw almost knocked Mo Fan, Zhang Xiaohou, and Zhao Manyan off.

Luckily, the three of them had reached the Super Level. They were no longer mere ants against these enormous creatures. They were not in danger as long as the attacks were not targeting them directly.

“Enough questions, we know it’s here to help us! The brown beast is obviously struggling to take on both sea monsters by himself. We’ll take care of Disastrous Beast Number Two. That thing which keeps releasing hot lava and steam is obviously not friendly to us!” the advisor in the silver outfit announced.

“Advisors, I can hear thousands of sea monsters coming toward us,” the old Sound Mage said sternly.

The three advisors looked into the distance and saw a terrifying horde approaching!

“Can you three fend off Disastrous Beast Number One for the time being? If so, the three of us will handle Disastrous Beast Number Two. The rest will protect the civilians on the bridge from the army of sea monsters!” the advisor in the silver outfit said.

“Got it!” Zhao Manyan answered.

“You have my thanks!” The Super Mage in the silver outfit glanced at Zhao Manyan, as if he was trying to remember his face.

He was clearly not ordinary if he was able to order a Great Ruler Beast around!

“Baxia isn’t afraid to fight that thing if it’s alone,” Zhao Manyan said.

“We still have to take care of the demon leeches. These things are seriously disgusting. They are extremely aggressive too,” Mo Fan said.

“There are so many of them. They are climbing up!” Zhang Xiaohou looked around him and saw the demon leeches climbing onto Baxia.

In Baxia’s eyes, the demon leeches were more like corrosive fleas. It was troublesome for him to keep an eye on so many tiny parasites at once due to his size. If he just ignored them, they would dig into his pores and his skin, resulting in a lot of damage. However, he would waste a lot of energy just to get rid of them, and their acid would still splatter all across his body when they died! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“We are currently the Darknin Brothers. We are here to cleanse the parasites!” Zhao Manyan once again felt like he had entered the limelight. He was overwhelmed by excitement.
