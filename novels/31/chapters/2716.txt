Chapter 2718: Flying Plants

??

“D*mn! It attacked the Copper-horned Yak less than fifty meters away from me!” Mo Fan cursed angrily.

Although the Copper-horned Yak was only a Dimensional Summoning Creature, he was fond of it after spending time with it. In an unguarded moment, it was suddenly attacked. Judging by its wound, it was impossible to save it even if he wanted to.

If Mo Fan had been alone, he would have rushed to kill the predator to avenge its death. However, Mo Fan couldn’t leave the group of girls unattended. Although they had high cultivation, they lacked experience to defend themselves if attacked.

Mo Fan walked to the Copper-horned Yak. He wrapped it with Shadow Substances and ended its life to prevent it from suffering unnecessary pain.

“Is it dead?” Shu Xiaohua ran over. There were tears in her eyes.

“Yeah.” Mo Fan rubbed his temples.

Not every Dimensional Summoning Creature was as lucky as Old Wolf. In fact, many Summoning Mages used summoned beasts from Dimensional Summoning as cannon fodder most of the time.

“Can you still summon flying beasts?” Big Sister Ruan was frightened after watching the Copper-horned Yak die painfully.

Mo Fan shook his head. “I’m afraid we won’t be able to fly. Look up.”

Big Sister Ruan, Shu Xiaohua, Big Sister Ying, Le Nan, Du Mei, and others raised their heads to the sky. There seemed to be some small clusters of weird clouds floating in the sky. They looked soft and fluffy.

They were horrified when they realized that those weren’t clouds at all. They looked like the Dandelion ghosts they had seen before. The most shocking thing was that the Dandelion had a sort of flower receptacle under it. The flower receptacle was covered with sharp fangs. They receded in a spherical layer with more fangs towards the center. These were not stamens, but bloody mouths of Mutated Beasts about to choose which people to devour!

“It’s the mutated Sea Anemone Dandelion! They’re flying in the sky!” Du Mei exclaimed.

The girls were frightened after seeing them. They thought they were plants at first but now they saw they were not that simple. They clustered around in the sky and surrounded them.

Dandelions waved with the wind. It seemed the hybrid versions had kept that ability. They could fly gracefully in the sky and then land on their food!

The demons descended from the sky. Even Mo Fan felt a little creeped out.

The biggest flaw of plant creatures was their hunting method. In most cases, they would let their prey fall into the rooted territory using camouflages, lures, and patience. But if the prey failed to stumble into their territory, it was impossible for them to catch their prey. They could not actively hunt for themselves.

Aside from that one flaw, the demons were actually very strong. They were even stronger than the animal demons. Once they had their prey in their territory, they would almost never let them escape.

These mutated Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons could move on a large scale with the strong winds blowing from nearby. Not only did they move quickly, but they could also strike and snatch whatever they found nearby. Creatures around them had no way to survive.

“I’ll cut the giant reeds. When you fight, stay together,” said Mo Fan.

It would be impossible to escape, the best way to survive was to face them all.

Mo Fan’s hands changed to knives, and he swung them on either side. Two Chaos Rift Blades sung and cut the grassland clearing a spec on either side. It would be easier to see and move now.

The Anemone Dandelions fell one by one. As soon as they touched the ground, they released their rhizomes, which were like earthworms, and plunged deeper into the muddy water.

“You deal with them,” Mo Fan said to Big Sister Ruan.

“What? Why? Aren’t you going to fight too? We might not be able to handle them all,” said Big Sister Ruan.

“It is likely that there is a more powerful and higher-level Sea Anemone Dandelion nearby which controls the rest. If it appears, I will need my hands free,” said Mo Fan.

The thing that had killed the Copper-horned Yak had returned. Mo Fan could sense the Darkness Seal that he had cast on it. He had expected the creature to flee, but it had the guts to appear in the same place again.

The Copper-horned Yak summoned by Mo Fan was a creature that was almost on the Commander-level. It could never have been killed by a common demon. Mo Fan realized that whatever the creature was, it was very powerful indeed.

This wetland was full of dangers. This creature which competed with the Sea Anemone Dandelions was not weak.

Mo Fan wanted to find out whether it was hunting alone or in a pack. If it was alone, he would use this as an opportunity to hone his Three-Elements Magic, but if it hunted in a pack, he had no choice but to use his real strength.

Mutated Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons were of Warlord-level. It had the characteristics of the Ocean Demons, and its combat power was about three times stronger than terrestrial demons.

Besides, plant monsters were generally much stronger than animal monsters. Some of the female Mages of Licheng Afterglow Island had completed Advanced Magic. The brilliant light they cast did not melt the Sea Anemone Dandelions directly but it did aggravate them. The Sea Anemone Dandelions began to twist and turn frantically. Some of them set off a barbed stem wave and others grew quickly to fill the empty space Mo Fan had just cleared. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Fire Element! Plants are afraid of Fire Element magic!” Big Sister Ruan shouted.

The flames were raging. Both Du Mei and Big Sister Ying practiced Fire Element magic, and Big Sister Ying was an Advanced Fire Element Mage. Sky-Flame Funeral rushed down, and layers of fire and smoke covered the Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons.

The Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons turned their stamens and threw out a lot of water whips. These water whips swirled together to form a vortex water whip shield, which tried to extinguish and absorb the fire raining down from the sky.

Mo Fan, who was guarding them, glanced quickly at them and realized that the Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons were not afraid of flames at all.

‘This is bad!’ thought Mo Fan. Even Fire Element, the nemesis of the Plant Element, became useless in front of these mutated hybrids.

Although it would be easy for Mo Fan’s Fire Element magic to get rid of them, he wanted to keep his hands free if a larger scale Sea Anemone Dandelion Demons army appeared.
