Yang Qiao’s neck was small and thin. It actually felt great to touch.

However, Mo Fan applied the physical strength of an Advanced Magician and pinched the woman’s thin neck. It immediately snapped after a soft crack!

Yang Qiao was unable to react. Her face still looked terrified and stunned, yet her head was already falling to the side, followed by her feeble body falling to the ground.

She fell right beside the young man. He initially thought he was dead for sure, yet a Hunter had appeared and saved his life. He burst into tears of joy.

“Can you stand?” asked Mo Fan.

“Ye...yeah!” The young man was stronger than Mo Fan had imagined. He slowly rose to his feet, yet when he looked at the corpses of his family, he broke into tears again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When he finally switched his focus onto Yang Qiao, his eyes were filled with inextinguishable anger. He had the urge to peel off her skin and eat her alive!

“Don’t worry, I will avenge your family. I won’t let those two get away, but I want you to understand your situation! Your family is already dead, but you’re still alive. I want you to try your best to stay calm, and put that woman’s jacket around you. Slowly make your way to the main building and wait for help,” Mo Fan said in a serious voice.

“I...I want to take their corpses with me,” said the young man in tears.

Mo Fan shook his head and said, “The dead remain dead. If you bring them along, you will only get yourself killed. Do as I said, pretend that none of this ever happened. I swear with my reputation as a Hunter that those scum that hurt your family will cease to exist in this world.”

The young man wiped his tears and looked into Mo Fan’s dark-brown eyes.

He finally nodded and said, “Thank you... I...I won’t be a burden to you.”

“Mmm, as long as you understand, it was worth putting myself at risk to save you.” Mo Fan patted the head of the bloody young man.

The young man straightened himself and grabbed the vicious woman’s coat. His physique happened to be similar to her. As he draped the coat over himself, it was rather difficult to tell the difference between them without being close enough.

The coat also covered the young man’s wounds. He tried his best to stand straight and headed toward the lights.

Mo Fan reminded him not to tell anyone in the main building about what happened, as it was unwise to alert the Black Vatican before finding a cure to the poison.

Mo Fan picked up the woman’s bottle and got rid of the corpses, including Yang Qiao’s, leaving no traces behind.

Mo Fan was unsure if the woman’s death would alert her superior in the Black Vatican, but he had not been able to convince himself to just hide in the tree and watch what was going to happen.

After dealing with the corpses, Mo Fan headed in the same direction the Gray Priest had gone.

A disciple was only worth five hundred thousand. It was not even enough to buy snacks for his beloved Flame Belle. His real target was the Gray Priest. Mo Fan was planning to follow him and act according to the situation!

“Isn’t Yang Qiao done cleaning up the corpses?” asked the Gray Priest Lu Geng.

“I saw her heading to the main building. She must be done with the corpses,” answered another disciple. The man had an obvious pair of buckteeth. He was rather outstanding in terms of ugliness!

“Oh, that’s fine. She can keep an eye on the Golden Battle Hunters. Speaking of which, why isn’t the clergy ready yet? If we wait any longer, a rescue might get her. Killing just a few hundred of them isn’t satisfying enough!” declared the Gray Priest Lu Geng.

“It should be done soon. We just need to wait for the cries... by the way, senior, I heard the deacon has recruited a new apprentice, I wonder who’s so lucky as to earn her favor?” asked the disciple enviously.

“He’s just a rookie. I have no idea why she picked him at all,” replied the Gray Priest Lu Geng.

“I passed by the Curse Pool just now and saw a half-dead woman inside it. Her hair was already gone. Is she the deacon’s new slave?” asked the disciple.

“Why would the deacon be interested in getting a new Dark Beast Monster? I bet it was for the rookie. However, they haven’t completed the ritual, so they just left her in the pool,” said the Gray Priest.

“I’ve been around for a long time, yet I only have a Dark Beast Monster...(sigh)”

“Are you saying that your future is dull because you’re following me?!” snapped the Gray Priest.

“No, not at all!”

“The Curse Pool happens to be unguarded, you will be guarding it tonight!” ordered the Gray Priest coldly.

“Aff...affirmative!” The disciple’s forehead was covered in cold sweat.

Mo Fan heard their conversation. He did not follow the Gray Priest as he realized that it was too dangerous to do so.

“Curse Pool, that must be the place where the Dark Beast Monsters are refined?” speculated Mo Fan. “If it isn’t guarded, it means the people of the Black Vatican won’t be going there. Just in time, I can get rid of this ugly disciple, too.”

Mo Fan made up his mind and followed the fairly spooked disciple silently.

The disciple went to a fairly remote spot. Mo Fan almost lost track of the way back when the disciple pushed open a door hidden in the corner. A foul scent immediately wafted out.

The disciple was cursing under his breath. Guarding the Curse Pool was the filthiest and most tiring work. Those who got into the Black Vatican’s way were thrown into the Curse Pool to be fermented...

Mo Fan spent some time checking the surroundings before he entered the place, making sure there were no other members of the Black Vatican or any surveillance equipment nearby.

He was standing less than two meters behind the bucktoothed disciple. The dim light greatly extended the disciple’s shadow, allowing Mo Fan to hide inside it easily. Mo Fan simply followed the disciple around.

“Help...help... me...” a pained voice came from the black pool.

Mo Fan remembered the disciple mentioning that a woman was inside the pool, yet it was impossible to identify her. Her hair and skin had fallen off, and body was severely festered as a woman!

Her voice had already turned hoarse. She was more like a skinless demon instead of a human!

Her appearance immediately reminded Mo Fan of Xu Zhaoting. If this was how the Dark Beast Monsters were born, it meant that Xu Zhaoting was tortured the same way!

Mo Fan’s heart immediately burned in rage!

The Black Vatican’s cruelty could not be described with mere words. What exactly did the demon Salan do, turning a person grown up in a civilized society into a vicious, cold-blooded creature?!
