Azure green sky, golden desert...

A towering giant was walking at a steady pace. Each step it took was enough to raze a sand dune to the ground, knocking the sand into the air.

The giant’s head reached the sky while its feet stood on the sand. It was like a moving mountain. The savage hordes of scorpions and snakes residing in the desert immediately backed off when they saw the enormous trespasser...

The Wild Snake Scorpions were the scariest demon creature in the Taklamakan Desert. Their average strength was around the Warrior-level, and deeper into the desert were lots of Commander-level Deadly Plague Snake Scorpions. If one were to describe the most mysterious and dangerous place full of treasure in China, the Taklamakan Desert was definitely one of them. Every year, a dozen or more foreign Magicians would die here. The survival rate was exceedingly low!

The place was infamous because of how dangerous it was, yet many people still came to try their luck. After all, the place was called the Golden Desert. The risks were high, but the potential rewards were high, too!

However, the Taklamakan Desert now had an uninvited guest. Its enormous figure, as huge as a mountain, made the Snake Scorpion Horde tremble in fear. None of the creatures dared to show any resistance when their precious territory was invaded...

The packs of Wild Snake Scorpions immediately withdrew, yet a horde had powerful existences, too.

As the Mountain Zombie ventured deeper into the territory of the Wild Snake Scorpions, over ten Deadly Plague Snake Scorpions appeared on a sandy hill, each over fifty meters tall and thoroughly pitch-black. Their tails and pincers were bright red, implying that they were stained with a deadly poison...

A Deadly Plague Snake Scorpion was enough to take up an entire sand dune. Its body almost caused the sand dune to collapse under its weight. The desert wolves running away nearby were like little worms.

More than ten of the same Commander-level creatures had appeared. They were crowding around something in a strange arc.

Suddenly, four other sand dunes at the center of the group shook vigorously as they rose up.

The sand dunes rose slowly. It turned out that there was an enormous creature three times the size of a Deadly Plague Snake Scorpion under the sand dunes. The sand dunes slowly turned into a sandstorm as they reached a certain height, pouring down along the creature’s shiny, pitch-black body.

Eight sharp and long scorpion legs poked into the sand. The distance between its front limbs and rear limbs was greater than the length of a soccer field!

Its arms wielded a pair of terrifying pincers. Even the slightest cut could snap a sandhill in half!

The thing surrounded by the Deadly Plague Snake Scorpions was obviously the ruler of the desert. It had been many years since any creature dared to challenge its authority. Most of the white bones buried under the desert were its masterpiece!

Hell Scorpion!

It was the infamous Hell Scorpion!

And now, the Hell Scorpion was being threatened. It had brought its Commanders along to surround the invader.

The invader’s size was shocking. The Hell Scorpion was already huge, yet it was still a lot smaller than the mountain-like zombie!

The Hell Scorpion let out a furious roar at the invader, telling the creature that it had trespassed into its territory.

The Mountain Zombie came to a stop. It looked down at the ruler of the Taklamakan Desert coldly. Instead of starting a fight, it seemed like it was awaiting orders from the man standing on its head. It did not dare to act rashly without receiving an order.

The Hell Scorpion was extremely proud, too. It was about to start a fight with its tough opponent when its eyes widened after discovering another being standing on its opponent’s head. It fixed its unblinking eyes on the tiny human figure.

The man standing on the mountain-like creature glanced down. His pitch-black eyes emitted a terrifying, cold light onto the sand with his gaze!

The Hell Scorpion subconsciously took a few steps back.

Meanwhile, the Commander-level Deadly Plague Snake Scorpions nearby were trembling in fear. Some that were weaker even burrowed into the sand and did not dare to show themselves again.

Not only did they have a Ruler-level creature protecting them, they were Commander-level creatures too, yet their battle intent completely dispersed after feeling that murderous gaze...

The Mountain Zombie resumed walking and stepped past the Hell Scorpion. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The Hell Scorpion stood there, yet it did not dare to utter the same challenging cry, let alone attack the Mountain Zombie that was right in front of it.

The desert continued to tremble under the heavy footsteps. The Mountain Zombie slowly disappeared into the distance, yet the Hell Scorpion still did not dare to make any move.

The Mountain Zombie was heading for Tianshan Mountain. After it disappeared for some time, the Hell Scorpion finally turned around and stared into that direction. The fear it felt from the man was still lingering deep inside its soul!

The same vastness as a desert, yet the Pacific Ocean was a spectacular blue, an entrancing color, with a hint of intimidating mysteriousness.

Neither an island nor a cloud could be seen nearby, as if they had sunken into a giant blue canvas, making it impossible to tell the directions. Only the endless waves were pushing the ship forward!

Mo Fan had come from the mountains. It was his first time going out to sea. In fact, he was quite excited at the start, yet he simply spent most of his time playing cards with the others...

No humans, no sea monsters, no islands, all there was was water... the days were unendurable.

Mo Fan did not understand. Did they really have to go so far for the training? Wasn’t it more efficient to take a plane to Japan? In the end, he could only play cards or cultivate on the ship, it was utterly boring!

“By the way, can’t you Water Magicians make the ship go faster?” suggested Mo Fan, who had run out of patience.

“It’s not difficult, but it’s tiring,” said Zhao Manyan.

“Just treat it as a way to cultivate, how long is it going to take to reach Japan at this rate?” Mo Fan prodded them.

“We’ll have a go!”

The others agreed that the ship was too slow. Those with the Water Element took turns to cast their spells, transforming the ship into a speedboat sprinting across the ocean like an arrow.

It felt great standing on the deck, watching the waves splitting in half as the water splashed on their faces!
