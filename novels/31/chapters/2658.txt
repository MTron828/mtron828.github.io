Chapter 2659: Escape at Will

Zhao Jing was backing away. He had no choice but to withdraw from the fight, even though he was unwilling to do so.

Every Lightning Mage was irritable to a certain degree. Zhao Jing glared at Mo Fan viciously while backing away.

Not only did that assh*** absorb my energy, he even used it against me! He had really underestimated these young Mages!

Zhao Jing had outstanding Lightning Resistance. The passing whiskers of the lightning dragons had merely damaged his clothes.

Strange scars were visible through the holes in Zhao Jing’s clothes, but they had not been caused by Mo Fan’s attacks. The scars were irregular and odd, and looked like wriggling worms upon his skin.

Mu Bai was astounded when he saw the scars on Zhao Jing’s body.

Zhao Jing’s expression sank, as if he did not want others to see his ugly scars.

“I’ll give you all some time...” Zhao Jing stared at the group and added, “to think how you are going to beg me for mercy the next time you see me!...”

His body began to blur and fade away.

It was like a mist was wrapping around him. The mist soon vanished into thin air, taking him with it as it left a strange red sprouting plant on the ground. It was rooted into the land that had been scorched by lightning. However, the sky began to turn the same red color as the plant, including the moon and the stars!

As the strange plant swayed, the red stars in the night sky started falling like some strange seeds that an evil god was sprinkling onto the mundane world. Every seed that struck the ground would trigger a huge quake!

The ground began to crack apart as more stars fell onto it. However, the plant was somehow receiving nutrients from the destruction. It slowly grew to the size of a towering tree!

The strange tree started swaying again. Its fruits continued to fall to the ground like asteroids. Mo Fan and the others felt like they were currently in a small world that was about to be destroyed. They would sink into the abyss and turn into mere dust at any second.

“Holy crap, what kind of sorcery is this!?” Zhao Manyan cursed. His defensive barriers were collapsing. It was his first time witnessing the strength of the highest tier of magic!

“Walls of Inscriptions!”

Xinxia immediately ordered the Radiance Unicorn to lend Zhao Manyan a hand.

Mysterious Runes floated around the Radiance Unicorn and formed circles of Runic Walls around the group.

Every glowing Rune could withstand a Super Spell. The Walls could even withstand the continuous attacks of a group of Super Mages!

However, as the strange tree continued to grow, the destruction its fruits were causing was worsening. Some hills in the distance were flattened by the relatively tiny meteorites that crashed into them.

“We have to chop down the tree!” Jiang Shaoxu yelled as she realized what to do.

“I’ll do it!” Mo Fan happened to be on the outside. He was using the Space Element to dodge the falling meteorites.

The number of meteorites gradually increased. The collisions were stirring up huge shockwaves that were spreading over a dozen kilometers away. Mo Fan was weaving through the shockwaves like a boat trying to make its way through a storm in the middle of the sea.

The tree was still growing, and had already reached a height of several hundred meters. It looked like a demonic ancient tree. Mo Fan wondered if it was going to Summon even bigger meteorites if it kept growing.

Mo Fan had not taken Zhao Manyan’s advice seriously when he warned them of how strong their enemy was, but he now realized how ridiculously strong Zhao Jing was. Every spell he used was world-shaking!

“Little Flame Belle, give me an axe!”

Mo Fan finally made it through the shockwaves and raised his hands.

Burning maple leaves circled above Mo Fan’s palms and swiftly took on the shape of an enormous sword after a huge pillar of flame rose into the sky!

Mo Fan looked up and saw he was holding a sword instead of an axe. He wondered how Little Flame Belle had failed to differentiate between a sword and an axe. An axe was obviously more fitting to chop down an evil tree, but it was too late to change it now!

“Two segments with a single cut, Ruyi God Sword!”

{TL Note: Ruyi God Sword is a weapon in an Anime.}

Mo Fan had no idea where the words had come from. He just felt like saying it while he was cutting down the tree. It obviously would not make any difference, but it was similar to how tennis players would yell as they were hitting the ball to boost their strength!

The fiery slash went all the way from the top of the evil tree to its trunk and roots. Its remaining force struck the ground with a huge impact.

The evil tree was sliced in half. The burning sword also set the tree on fire and burned it into ashes.

The weather cleared up as soon as the tree was dead. The stars remained hanging in the night sky together with the bright moon. They no longer had an eerie red glow, but the landscape had changed tremendously. Many of the surrounding hills and small mountains were replaced with canyons and ravines. Even the deeper layers under the ground were exposed.

“Where’s Zhao Jing?” Jiang Shaoxu could not find Zhao Jing with her Psychic Element.

“He ran away. He was going to feed us to the Sharkmen,” Lingling said.

Mu Bai turned around and noticed the Sharkman Chieftain was less than a dozen kilometers from them. It was flying extremely close to the surface right now. The mountains it flew past were turning into dust under its overwhelming power, even though it did not touch them.

Everything was as fragile as bubbles to a Supreme Ruler. The group felt uneasy after witnessing how strong it was.

“We should go!” Xinxia exclaimed.

Xinxia pulled Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling onto the Radiance Unicorn. It sprang into the air and ran along a rainbow bridge that was suddenly extending across the night sky.

Mo Fan Summoned his Wings of Dawn and Dusk. He was even faster than the Radiance Unicorn. He soon caught up to the creature and led the way.

Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai were the only ones left. They looked at one another.

Mu Bai painted an ice raft out of nothing and jumped onto it. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The ice raft coasted forward while turning the ground ahead of it into ice. It continued to speed up and rapidly faded into the distance.

Zhao Manyan was lost for words as he watched the others disappear.

What the heck? Was this what they meant by seeing one’s true sentiments in hard times? They were all running away with their own means!
