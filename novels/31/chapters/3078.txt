3079 The Avalanche in Alps Mountain

At the Holy Palace in Holy City, Penal Angel Fahl spread her wings. Her wings were on her back, and they gave off an imposing aura. Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue, who was standing on the lengthy staircase in Holy City, appeared tiny.

Penal Angel Fahl had tanned skin that resembled a black pearl. She had golden irises, and they gave off an air of arrogance. She slowly raised her right hand and clenched her fist in the air. She looked as if she was grabbing something before she flung it with all her might.

The next moment, a razor-sharp and narrow light chain was shot toward Mu Ningxue. The Wind Swastika formation under her feet was shattered. She was about to step into the Holy Palace but slid backward far away.

Chik! Chik! Chik!

!!

Mu Ningxue regained her balance. She looked at Penal Angel Fahl, only to realize Fahl wielded a Light Rope. The Light Rope was made up of holy burning light. When Fahl swung the rope, it looked like a whip with infinite power. Even a massive mountain range could not hold back the Light Rope’s power.

Penal Angel Fahl spread her ten wings and flew into the sky. She spread her wings layer upon layer. She suppressed Mu Ningxue’s powerful soul while swinging her Light Rope with all her might.

As she swung her Light Rope, it gave off a majestic aura that was as strong as a blazing sun. The power from the strike of the Light Rope was as powerful as one from a Light Element Forbidden Mage. With such massive light energy concentrated in a Light Rope that resembled a long whip, a single strike could immediately reduce one’s soul to ashes.

The glacier that Mu Ningxue had created using her mind power was quickly melted by the strong and intense light. The blazing holy light greatly suppressed her innate Ice Element God’s gift. Holy City, which was covered in snow, resumed its original brightness and warmth.

“Take out that magic bow of yours. Without it, you’re just a puny creature before me! Your realm is far behind mine!” Penal Angel Fahl spoke arrogantly.

Her wrist twitched. The Light Rope in her hand split into thousands of strands when it landed. The bright and blazing energy from the Light Rope flew through Mu Ningxue’s frosty area and knocked down the Ice Elves that had been protecting her.

Mu Ningxue did not use her Extreme Dust Ice Bow. She stared at the Light Rope around her and summoned the ice element from further away using her mind power.

She used her God’s gift. Her God’s gift allowed her to contact the ice element from far away areas. The Alps Mountain range was located to the east of Holy City. Regardless of the season or altitude, the towering Alps Mountain was covered in snow all year round. The ice area was like a white jade staircase from heaven. It was so ethereal and magnificent.

At that moment, the Alps Mountain range shook. The snow that had been covering Alps Mountain at high altitudes for hundreds upon thousands of years seemed to have heard the Queen’s summon. For a moment, the snow was peeled away from the top of the mountain range. They formed an enormous avalanche and tumbled all the way from Alps Mountain to the western plains, then into Holy City rampantly!

Penal Angel could not help but become dumbfounded.

She saw an unprecedented avalanche coming after her from Alps Mountain. The avalanche moved so fast that half of the plains were buried underneath the cruel snow. It was approaching Holy City.

The snow avalanche looked as if it was the Alps Mountain range that was heading toward Holy City. Who would have thought Mu Ningxue was so powerful to the extent of summoning the snow mountain from hundreds of miles away, then turning nature’s glacial mountain peak into her own power and bringing an unprecedented disaster to the city?!

The Light Rope unleashed heat to try to melt and shatter Mu Ningxue’s Ice Forbidden Boundary. However, Fahl did not expect Mu Ningxue’s Ice Element God’s gift to be so terrifying to that extent. Mu Ningxue was not the same as Qin Yu’Er, who had been executed. Mu Ningxue was an Ice Element disaster maker…

Even though Qin Yu’Er had been nipped in the bud, Mu Ningxue grew up to become a true snow demon.

“It’s the Natural Soul Seed… You’ve become an Ice Element disaster maker! You have gone against the law of nature. The element belongs to nature, and the mages draw support from it to cast their spell. You, on the other hand, enslave the element!” rebuked Penal Angel Fahl angrily.

When one could not control the powerful God’s gift given to them, they would be known as a disaster maker. Qin Yu’Er was one of the most distinctive examples. She possessed the Natural Soul Seed. Before her cultivation reached the advanced level, she could already control the weather and formed her own territory. She could even create a snow disaster in warm land, killing all living beings.

Mu Ningxue was given the Natural Soul Seed and was different from most ordinary people. But she had not reached a dangerous level like Qin Yu’Er.

However, the power that she demonstrated surpassed Qin Yu’Er. Mu Ningxue’s power was more than what was bestowed by the Natural Soul Seed.

She could enslave the Alps Mountain range and turn the massive natural energy into her anger, then sweep it across Holy City. Her danger level was beyond Holy City’s expectations!

“All thanks to you.” Mu Ningxue stared at Fahl coolly.

It was Holy City who had banished her to the Eternal Night at the South Extreme Land.

The South Extreme Land itself was a lifeless, glacial land. When Eternal Night approached, the darkness was scarier than hell. To stay in that place, she would either have to die in the pile of snow or break through.

…

After she survived the lifeless land, her Ice Element God’s gift underwent a transformation in that harsh environment. She also experienced the same helplessness and torment when Qin Yu’Er was banished to Tianshan Heavenly Scar Mountain. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As such, Mu Ningxue asked for what she had previously been taken away back from Holy City.

She and Mo Fan shared the same thought.

They would not give in even the slightest bit to the people in Holy City anymore!

They would not repeat the same mistake!

Qin Yu’Er did not fight back. Today, Mu Ningxue would do it for her. The avalanche from the Alps Mountain contained the two women’s anger, and they vented their anger out at Holy City!

Broom! Broom! Broom!

The sight of the avalanche from the Alps Mountain was shocking to behold. The people in the “Sky Holy City” could not help that even their souls trembled upon seeing the sight.

They found it hard to believe that Mu Ningxue was capable of summoning such a destructive avalanche. Alps Mountain was majestic and magnificent. The mountain spanned many countries. The snow covering the top of the mountain was piled up for thousands of years. At that moment, all the snow collapsed and fell on the fragile plains.

The avalanche buried everything. The magnificent glacial mountains tumbled. Even the historical and great Holy City appeared small before the avalanche.

Such a magnificent spell only belonged to the legendary Snow God in Alps Mountain.

Her anger could crush all living beings effortlessly!
