3015 The Mysterious Guest

Ye Xinxia obtained full support from Ayleen. Ayleen also held the most power.

However, Ayleen had no control over the other members with 70% of the ownership.

As long as Lady Karolina stood firm on her decision in the meeting, Ye Xinxia would face obstacles in gaining majority of voting support from the people of England.

Inside the meeting hall, Lady Karolina put on her favorite dress. Her dress was a noble blue color like distant stardust. It accentuated her snow-white skin and slender figure. Lady Karolina knew she would be the main character for this day. She would be the one to decide the Victorian family, the Parthenon Temple, and Europe’s future.

Lady Karolina saw Ye Xinxia.

Ye Xinxia sat beside Ayleen.

They both looked as if they were still undergraduates in the middle of a beauty-parlor chat. Lady Karolina found them pathetic and ridiculous.

‘So, these two little girls think they can control the entire Europe, huh? There are still many people in the city who are more capable than them!’

“The meeting has begun. Please take your seats,” said the executive.

The Victorian family’s key figures were no more than twenty. Aside from the four people with absolute power over the family, the others were more like advisors. In the end, they still had to obey the views of the four people with the most power and let them make the final decision.

This was rarely seen in other great families. They rarely had absolute control over their positions.

“Let me make an opening speech,” said Old Weller. He glanced at the main entrance. After making sure the entrance was closed, he began his speech.

“Today, we are going to make an important decision. The decision we make will directly impact our ability to gain international prestige. We’re going to decide the goddess of the Parthenon Temple, and we’re aware of the Parthenon Temple status in the world. If we make the wrong choice, then I think we should just stick to expanding in England.”

The group inside the meeting hall burst into laughter.

The Victorian family was also known as the Dragon family. They were the talk of the town these days. The European Mages discussed them. Many clans were somewhat unimpressed with the Parthenon Temple.

In fact, the Parthenon Temple had a solid foundation. However, relying on the goddess’ Resurrection Divine Art alone could not change the world. Meanwhile, the Victorian family had caused drastic changes to the situation in Europe.

The children wanted to become the Dragoon Mages instead of just an outstanding Mage.

“My lady, I’m sorry. Some young people just think they know everything.” Old Weller could not help but shake his head upon hearing the laughter. He apologized to Ye Xinxia who sat at the far end of the round table.

Ye Xinxia did not take that to heart. She sat there and observed.

The group was not surprised to see Ye Xinxia involved in the Victorian family’s meeting. After all, she had invested a sum of money in the family in the name of a saintess many years ago. She had helped the family to resolve many immediate issues.

She occasionally showed up at family meetings, but she never interfered in their decisions.

“My lady, we’re aware of your intention of being present in this meeting. B-But, what can you bring to us? As far as we’re concerned, Izisha has a perfect network with the ancient, great families of Europe. As for you, you can’t bring anything of substance to our family aside from having the loyal believers of Divine Soul and gaining fame from charity,” said a noble young man who had laughed a while ago.

“Duke, as much as we would like to build a closer relationship with the Parthenon Temple, we don’t seem to be lacking anything now,” said Thompson, who was in charge of the dragon hatchery industry.

“We still lack a lot of things. For example, we lack dragon taming techniques…,” said Old Weller.

Old Weller was in charge of taming dragons.

Dragon taming technique was key to the Victorian family. Regardless of how powerful a dragon was, if they failed to tame it, it would be pointless.

They had to tame even the most powerful and irascible dragons and turn them as obedient as a sheep. The Victorian family had achieved a breakthrough in this area for the past few years. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But they had not gained four-star taming levels.

If they achieved a four-star security level in taming a dragon, it would mean the dragon they tamed would be safer than the pets kept in the city. Most national governments longed for them to tame the enormous dragons.

“Aren’t we here to talk about supporting votes? It shouldn’t take such a long time to discuss it. Don’t you think so, Ye Xinxia?” Lady Karolina stared at Ye Xinxia.

Lady Karolina had already laid out her conditions for Ye Xinxia. The result at the end of the meeting all depended on whether Ye Xinxia would give up her precious Resurrection Divine Art. To put it bluntly, it was a deal between Lady Karolina and Ye Xinxia.

“Discussion?” asked Duke Ayleen. She was puzzled with their words.

“Ayleen, of course you were not there for the discussion. We all know your thoughts. You will certainly support your best friend unconditionally,” said Lady Karolina with a smile.

Lady Karolina had to act politely before Ayleen.

“You all have misunderstood. This is not a meeting for discussion. Uncle, I already stated the main point for today’s meeting when I summoned you all here. I’m here to make an announcement instead of discussing whether to support Izisha or Ye Xinxia,” said Duke Ayleen to Old Weller.

“What’s the difference? I understand how you feel. Even though the Victorian family supports Ye Xinxia, we can’t possibly give our support unconditionally. So, I think we shouldn’t discuss the issue, instead, we should make a direct announcement,” said Old Weller calmly.

Meanwhile, Ayleen shook her head.

The people in the meeting had differing opinions. Some did not mind giving their support unconditionally, while others said the Parthenon Temple should first show them their sincerity. Some said they could make other choices.

Lady Karolina smiled even more radiantly when she saw the group arguing over their different opinions.

Lady Karolina hoped this would make Ye Xinxia aware that the Victorian family was not certainly the bargaining chip for her to win the election. With that, Ye Xinxia would agree to Lady Karolina’s condition.

“You don’t have much time left to consider my offer,” whispered Lady Karolina to Ye Xinxia.

“Why don’t we listen to Ayleen’s announcement first?” said Ye Xinxia.

…

Ayleen stood up. She did not show them a gentle and elegant smile. Instead, she looked solemn. She radiated an air of intimidation of a reigning queen.

The group fell silent.

“What is it that makes everyone so arrogant today? Perhaps with the power and wealth the dragons provide us, it has rendered some of us weak in our intellect.”

Ayleen reprimanded the group without hesitation, especially the young people who assumed they did not need to strengthen their ties with the Parthenon Temple.

“How did we conquer the enormous dragons?” questioned Ayleen.
