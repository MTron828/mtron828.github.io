Chapter 2739: Hit the Jackpot

People in Licheng Afterglow Island would never leave the island. Their thoughts and opinions were deeply rooted in their minds like a tree whose roots were thousands of years old. It was impossible to change their thinking. They could only be destroyed.

Since the arrival of Ocean Demons, numerous cities had moved to the fortresses, except for the people from Licheng Afterglow Island. They did not have a need to move from their surreal home. Besides, no one could find them to reprimand them.

The people from Licheng Afterglow Island were aware that Ocean Demons were about to destroy the coast. They decided to visit the Mingwu Ancient City to find a means to preserve their home and land.

Licheng Afterglow Island’s origin was related to Mingwu Ancient City. They had transferred the most important ancient statues from Mingwu Ancient City to this island. The once holy and sacred Mingwu Ancient City was slowly abandoned but Licheng Afterglow Island continued to shine brightly in the holy light.

The ladies grabbed all the ancient statues for themselves and their island. They did not care if the Ocean Demons devoured and destroyed everything outside. They did not even care if people were slaughtered because of it as long as they could enjoy the beauty of Licheng Afterglow Island in peace.

They repeated their mistake and allowed disaster to slaughter and destroy those in the fortresses. The people outside were insignificant and unworthy of their attention.

Even when the fisherman had promised never to reveal their location, they mercilessly killed him.

A holy, sacred, and peaceful land could not purify a human’s mind. Instead, it only caused the people living there to commit atrocious deeds just to preserve their sacred land.

Even if the ancestors of Licheng Afterglow Island had started out by hiding in this untouched island for the sake of atoning their sins, they had fallen into depravity the moment they had killed an innocent fisherman. They inched towards heresy. They no longer felt any remorse if they had to kill other people for their own selfishness.

“The island is a perfect greenhouse. And I’m going to invade your comfort zone like an alien virus!” Mo Fan’s lips twitched into a smile.

...

The anchor-tailed sea lion was an experienced and cunning demon. It was very skillful. It guided Mo Fan and easily avoided the security line. It crawled up from a dead end wall and showed Mo Fan the safest way. Mo Fan finally landed on the island.

Licheng Afterglow Island was big. He realized that it was capable of providing all its citizens with their needs.

......

There were agricultural lands, orchards, ponds, and vegetable gardens. The island was similar to the majority of towns outside. The town itself was not very big, it only had two streets and the citizens were scattered all over it.

Women outnumbered men by a wide margin. They regarded women highly on this island. The women were the ones who learned magic, managed, and held important positions. Men, on the other hand, were in charge of agriculture, construction and collection. The elders drove a big cargo ship out to Licheng City weekly to purchase resources that they could not produce on their own.

Women ventured outside for training. Men were not allowed to leave. The women on the island did not imprison the men. Instead, they dominated them.

...

There were many citizens on the island. Mo Fan walked openly, and no one even identified him as an intruder. The town was serene and beautiful. The atmosphere was tranquil. There were many gorgeous ladies. Although all women might not be as wicked and cruel, they did share the same ideology. This place was heaven to them.

If they had not committed atrocities which provoked God’s wrath, this island would actually be a heaven for men as well. Young men would never have to worry about not finding a beautiful wife.

“It’s only a mini version of an evil temple. Hmph!” Apas was disdainful.

The island was typically an evil temple. In fact, the island was far more hypocritical than an evil temple. Mo Fan understood the situation of this island.

Mo Fan hated killing innocents. He wanted to destroy Licheng Afterglow Island, but he had no intention of slaughtering everyone. He only intended to overturn the current rulers. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Okay, get ready to start work!” Mo Fan craned his neck and pressed his knuckles.

“Wait, the anchor-tailed sea lion said it’s best to visit the spiritual land first. The spiritual land is vacant right now,” said Apas.

“Once I take on the rulers on this island, everything including the ladies will be mine… Ahem… on second thought, they might rather destroy themselves. We’ll take away all the good stuff in case they choose that.”

...

When Mo Fan first encountered the anchor-tailed sea lion, he had thought it to be a little strange. Even though the anchor-tailed sea lion was not of a high-class bloodline, it had reached ruler-level. Mo Fan wondered how it managed that. Does it rely solely on ambushing its prey? But it could put its own life at stake every time. It could not possibly always win. It didn’t even look powerful enough to regrow a head.

It was only when Mo Fan saw how skillfully the anchor-tailed sea lion entered Licheng Afterglow Island that he understood.

“That’s how amazing you are, huh?” said Mo Fan. “The reason you became so powerful is because you often sneak into the island’s spiritual land to replenish your energy!”

The anchor-tailed sea lion was familiar with the place. It took advantage of the island’s weakness and cultivated in the island’s spiritual land. That was how it became ruler-level.

“The island’s spiritual land is indeed marvelous! Even an ordinary anchor-tailed sea lion can become a ruler-level demon!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

Licheng Afterglow Island exceeded his expectations. He could already sense the warmth of the place despite being blocked by huge boulders. It was majestic!

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!” Little Loach trembled with excitement.

Little Loach once ate a small star dust magical equipment. Its happiness had lasted for a month. Since then, Little Loach had transformed into an ancient squid that was no longer easily tempted, not even by a sacred peach.

However, this time, Little Loach swung aggressively as if it was pulling Mo Fan’s neck to rush into the spiritual land. Judging from its reaction, Mo Fan couldtell that the spiritual land was indeed special.

He had hit a jackpot! Only rare spiritual treasure in this world could make the sea star-level Little Loach so thrilled. Mo Fan expected to advance to the third grade of his Lightning Element. His Chaos and Earth elements would soon advance to super-level!

Mo Fan used his Shadow element and traveled through the cavernous cracks following the anchor-tailed sea lion.

The cracks were so intricate it would have been impossible to find the spiritual land if not for the anchor-tailed sea lion who knew the place so perfectly. Mo Fan was excited they got closer.

He was glad that he had not slaughtered the creature. It had done him a huge favor!

“Big Brother, I’m almost done with my cultivation. I’ve been cultivating inside for almost a week. I feel bored. It’s still early, shall we take a stroll on the street?” A silvery voice said.

“Okay. But are you sure you only want to take a stroll on the street?”

“Don’t be so naughty!”

The voice of the couple grew fainter.

The anchor-tailed sea lion told Mo Fan that those who had been acknowledged by Licheng Afterglow Island’s elders would have a chance to cultivate for six days in the spiritual land. On the seventh day, the spiritual land would be left vacant to restore itself.

And the anchor-tailed sea lion took advantage of the seventh day to sneak inside and cultivate itself.

Mo Fan came across an enormous stone door which was closed. The aura it exuded felt familiar.
