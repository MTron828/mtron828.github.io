“Meow!” Mu Ningxue heard a familiar cry in the mist.

She turned around and saw an intelligent cat-like beast shrouded in the darkness standing on the building less than fifty meters away. The creature’s glittering eyes were staring right back at her through the mist.

Mu Ningxue was overjoyed. Wasn’t that Jiang Yu’s Night Rakshasa?

Mu Ningxue had turned off the communication device. The others on the team kept saying useless things. She preferred not to waste her time arguing with them, so she had no idea that Jiang Yu had sent his Contracted Beast over to help her.

“Meow!” the intelligent Night Rakshasa suddenly screeched. She quickened her pace and dashed toward Mu Ningxue like a black meteorite flying close to the ground.

Mu Ningxue was startled. Why was the creature lunging at her?

The Night Rakshasa was using Shadow Dance, allowing her to move rapidly through the shadow without touching the ground.

When the Night Rakshasa arrived in front of Mu Ningxue, she jumped up and waved her claws rapidly in the air.

Mu Ningxue finally realized there were lots of white silks around her. She was completely surrounded by the white silks without even noticing them. The mist had prevented her from noticing them.

The Night Rakshasa slashed the white silks with her claws. She lifted her sharp gaze and stared at a tall building ten meters away!

The building seemed to be taller than the rest of the buildings nearby. Mu Ningxue did not notice it at first, but as the Night Rakshasa fixed her gaze onto the building, she realized that it was not because the building was taller, but there was a monster sitting on top of it, the one that had spat out the silks!

The monster was able to change its color! It was currently gray-white, the exact same color of the buildings, allowing it to blend perfectly with the building it was sitting on. It was almost impossible to notice its presence without taking a closer look.

Mu Ningxue’s heart started pounding heavily. The sea monsters had extraordinary capabilities and were extremely cunning. Humans would easily become the food in their stomach if they weren’t careful enough!

“Feifei, let’s focus on finding the White Sobbing Demon. Don’t bother fighting it,” Mu Ningxue chose.

Mu Ningxue was unable to take a clear look at the creature that had disguised itself as part of the building, yet she knew that the creature was tough! It would be a waste of time to fight the creature now...

Judging from the Night Rakshasa’s reaction, Mu Ningxue could easily tell that the Night Rakshasa was treating the creature as a worthy opponent.

Mu Ningxue decisively summoned a gust of wind and proceeded to search for the White Sobbing Demon when she saw the creature did not continue attacking them.

“Meow!”

The Night Rakshasa stopped Mu Ningxue when she was about to leave.

The Night Rakshasa stood on her feet and pointed her paw in a completely opposite direction.

“Are you telling me to go that way?” speculated Mu Ningxue.

“Meow!”

“Do you know where the White Sobbing Demon is?” asked Mu Ningxue excitedly.

Mu Ningxue suddenly remembered that the Night Rakshasa was the one that had injured the White Sobbing Demon. She was sniffing at her claws that had slashed the White Sobbing Demon’s chest open. It seemed like the claws had caught the scent of the White Sobbing Demon’s blood.

The Night Rakshasa ignored the creature on the roof and led Mu Ningxue in the direction of the nineteenth zone.

As soon as Mu Ningxue left the place, she vaguely heard someone cursing; they seemed to be mentioning something about a dog.

The voice, the tone, and the way he cursed reminded Mu Ningxue of someone.

However, as a new wave splashed across the building, Mu Ningxue was unsure if she had heard it wrong.

“Meow!” the Night Rakshasa cried out, signaling Mu Ningxue to keep pace with her.

Mu Ningxue did not think too much. She cast a Wind Track and followed closely behind the Night Rakshasa. She was feeling uneasier as more time passed. It felt like she could still hear Nan Rongni’s painful groans coming from the communication device that was still turned off...

“Can you stop cursing!” Mochizuki Chihaya was not a fan of Mo Fan’s habits.

-Where are his manners? How did someone like him got selected to represent the national team? Is China really running short on talents?-

“Damn, I was cursing in Chinese, how did you understand that?” Mo Fan was surprised. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Anyway, don’t let me hear it again! I have heard enough of the curses you Chinese let go in Japan,” Mochizuki Chihaya retorted angrily.

“You’re crazy, I didn’t come to Japan to serve the mistress of a renowned clan like you. That thing was disguising itself as a building. I didn’t kill it because I’m in a rush, why can’t I curse it? Are you telling me to be polite toward demon creatures? It’s pretty obvious that the creature wasn’t being polite in the first place. White and slimy, how disgusting!” Mo Fan did not stop complaining.

Mochizuki Chihaya simply rolled her eyes. She was embarrassed to team up with a man like him.

The sea monster had only disguised itself and set up some white silk waiting for its prey to step into the trap, yet Mo Fan ended up scolding its family up to its ancestors. Was there any meaning to it?

“Stop talking, the communication device finally has a signal,” said Mo Fan.

Mochizuki Chihaya blushed angrily. Asshole, was she even talking? It was him scolding the concealed monster all along!

The communication device implied that they were very close to the twentieth zone. Mo Fan heard serious voices communicating in the channel. He did not hear any meaningless chat. It was obvious that the team was currently in the middle of a fight. Mo Fan felt uneasy to interrupt all of a sudden.

“Err... is Mu Ningxue there?” Mo Fan turned on the communication device and asked softly.

“Didn’t Mu Ningxue go after the White Sobbing Demon? Which idiot is asking... damn, Mo Fan, you traitor, you finally came back... Nanyu, Nanyu, their captain is behind you! Jiang Shaoxu, interrupt its channeling, don’t let it spit the water!” yelled Zhao Manyan.

“Mo Fan, Mu Ningxue is on her own. She should be heading toward the nineteenth zone. Go look for her!”

“Are you guys alright? I feel like you’re in a pinch too,” asked Mo Fan, being kind for once.

“Nan Rongni is dying from a deadly poison. We can still hold on for a little longer. Go and find Mu Ningxue, and keep an eye for a white creature that cries like an infant. You have to hunt it down. It’s the White Sobbing Demon, the only creature that has the antidote to the poison,” someone immediately explained to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was astounded. Nan Rongni was poisoned, and her life was in danger!?

“Chihaya, go help them. I’ll go look for Mu Ningxue,” Mo Fan realized how grave the situation was. He no longer had the mood to joke around.

“What happened?”

“Nan Rongni is the Healer on our team. She is poisoned, and the others are surrounded by sea monsters. Their lives are in danger, too!” Mo Fan told her.
