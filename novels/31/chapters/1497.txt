Elder Ling finally left. There was no way he could take on the entire Alps Institute on his own. Headmistress Perry was willing to give her best to protect the Alps Institute’s dignity, and was already a tough opponent for him. There were a few others with outstanding strength in the Alps Institute. If he really infuriated them, he might actually struggle to return to his clan in one piece!

The clash between the Alps Institute and the Casas from now on was no longer Mo Fan’s concern. They believed it was the right decision...

——

For the next few days, Mo Fan was well-received by the ladies in the Alps Institute. He felt like he was surrounded by girls all the time, and could not have asked for a better experience. He even had the urge to find himself a vacant spot and build a house so he could live here forever. He would hear the alluring yet reserved giggles of the women every day after he woke up, and he could see beautiful women who were serious about their cultivation in every corner of the school. At night, some of the sentimental ladies might occasionally visit him to have a pillow talk...

However, it was a pity that he still had to leave. Otherwise, the Holy Judgment Court might send some people over to escort him there in person!

“Sorry for the trouble,” Ceylan said, her face much gentler now.

“It’s nothing worth mentioning. Besides, we have been disturbing your school for so many days. We should really do something in return,” Professor Li replied with a smile.

“Don’t worry, we’ll bring her to the Holy Judgment Court safely,” Professor Zheng said.

The Casas knew who had poisoned Herr Casa. They would try everything to intercept Edith to get their revenge.

Ceylan knew Mo Fan and the others were heading to the Holy Judgment Court next, thus she was hoping they could escort Edith to the Holy Judgment Court. Professor Li gladly accepted the request.

Edith was disguised as a student of the Pearl Institute. The Casas would not expect it. As they furiously stirred up trouble at the Alps Institute, Edith would already have arrived at the Holy Judgment Court. The Holy Judgment Court would not allow the Casas to throw a tantrum there!

“Wait until the snow is a little thinner before you leave,” Ceylan said.

“Where’s Mo Fan? Why isn’t he here?”

“I don’t know, maybe he’s still bidding farewell to the girls,” Zhao Manyan said jealously.

Zhao Manyan had always succeeded in his attempts to pick up chicks, but he had failed to win a single girl’s affection at the Alps Institute, even though every student there was a woman. The students were too cautious around him. Instead, Mo Fan had suddenly become their one and only idol...

—

A while later, Mo Fan, Brianca, and Heidi came in. Brianca and Heidi had changed their clothes, and were now wearing the Pearl Institute’s uniform. There weren’t many people in the group from the Pearl Institute, but the Casas could not have cared less about the Pearl Institute in the first place. They had no idea how many people the Pearl Institute had brought here.

“The two of you are coming with us too?” Zhao Manyan looked at Heidi and Brianca in surprise.

Brianca and Heidi dazzled everyone. They were both gorgeous women with alluring and elegant demeanors. Their skin was fair, their heights were similar; they looked like a pair of angelic twin sisters when they were standing together. If they did not cover their faces, they would surely cause a series of crashes if they went walking down a busy road in the city!

“What do you think? I chose the clothes!” Mo Fan was extremely satisfied with his brilliant work.

“It suits my tastes!” Zhao Manyan proclaimed happily.

Heidi and Brianca had been wearing the uniform of the Alps Institute for a long time. They felt slightly uncomfortable when they put on normal clothing, yet they had to bear with it under the current circumstances.

Heidi was not having too much trouble. She had not spent all her time living and cultivating in the Alps, and would visit the city occasionally, but Brianca rarely visited anywhere. When the skinny jeans tightly stuck to her rear, she felt like her butt was as exposed as if she was not wearing anything. The jeans clung like elastic; she was having a hard time getting used to them.

“Time to hit the road!”

“Let’s go!”

——

Professor Zheng was a Summone, and the journey to the Holy Judgment Court was a rather long distance. It would be extremely tiring to travel there on foot, so he Summoned his Mangshan Mountain Beast. The group sat on the back of the Summoned Beast and enjoyed the spectacular scenery along the way, while the snow fell on their shoulders. They even had the chance to chat with some gorgeous beauties. How could they not enjoy themselves?

The mountain paths were bumpy, but Professor Zheng’s Mangshan Mountain Beast was surprisingly stable. It was likely that Professor Zheng had been using it as his personal SUV. A few little creatures were spotted along the way, but a single breath from the Summoned Beast was enough to scare them away.

After traveling for half a day, they finally saw the mountain gate of the Holy Judgment Court. It was difficult to tell exactly where they were in the Alps, but the altitude was higher since the place was covered in thick snow. The white snow split the mountain ridges into different layers. They could barely distinguish the different mountains...

“Follow the stairs up, and you’ll arrive at the Holy Judgment Court,” Brianca pointed ahead of them.

“Mm, let’s keep going.”

—

When the group climbed the long stairs and reached the top, they discovered a basin formed by several aligned mountains. It was like an enormous bowl being held up high by the mountains, capturing the essence of the sun and moon, while breathing out the mystical energy of the Alps...

The snow started to fall rapidly. They could see the blurred outline of some structures in the Middle Ages style, all lit up with sacred candles.

The group followed a path that had been recently built into the basin. Not long afterwards, a few Holy Court Mages in uniform showed up. They floated in the air, having no intention of landing on the ground to talk to Mo Fan and the others.

They remained flying after learning the identity of the group, guiding Mo Fan and the others into the Holy Judgment Court.

——

When they arrived at the Hall of Deities in the Holy Judgment Court, a few maids came over to receive them. They brought the members of the group to different wooden huts so they could change into suitable clothes that would prevent them from getting frostbite. The snow and cold of the Alps was not to be underestimated!

—

Brianca and Heidi handed Edith to one of the Holy Court Mages, and personally escorted Edith to the prison of the Holy Judgment Court, too.

When they passed by the Hall of Deities, they saw a woman sitting in the empty hall. She had a cup of tea with hot steam rising into the air beside her, and a knight standing like a statue behind her.

The woman’s face was covered by a veil. She casually glanced at Heidi and Brianca without initiating a conversation.

Brianca and Heidi were not the talkative kind, either. They proceeded to their own rooms under the guidance of the maids. For some reason, the woman gave them a strange feeling. They could not help but have an urge to take a few more glances at her, but every time they stared at her, they somehow felt like it was an offending act, and were a little intimidated.

—

A while after Brianca and Heidi left, Mo Fan put on some fresh clothes and was thinking of looking for them to learn how the handover went. As soon as he entered the Hall of Deities, a set of eyes immediately locked on him. Mo Fan was startled. He looked at the veiled woman curiously.

“The Woman of White Impermanence?” Mo Fan blurted out when he saw her.

“How unfortunate,” the woman replied. She did not seem to be surprised to see Mo Fan here.

Mo Fan had no intention of interacting with the disgusting woman. He was about to turn around and leave when she giggled, “Are you afraid of me?”

“Why would I be afraid of a living corpse?” Mo Fan was displeased by the comment. He promptly sat down opposite her.

“My life is pure as snow. Feel free to come closer and have a sniff, to see if I have the rotting smell of the living dead,” the woman said.

“Your body might not have a foul stench, but your soul definitely does. It’s difficult to smell it with my nose, but I have a pair of discerning eyes that can identify any kind of monster,” Mo Fan replied.

While they were speaking, a few elders came into the Hall of Deities from the other entrance. One of them was the Casa henchman in the red outfit, the one in charge of Herr Casa’s safety. He was following an old man like a subordinate.

The old man quickly went over to the woman. He bowed slightly and said, “Thanks to the Hall of the Goddess for lending us a hand. Otherwise, my nephew’s life might still be in danger!”

“It’s nothing worth mentioning, but do remind the young duke to be more cautious with his private affairs. It’s unwise to let a little b**ch with ulterior motives get close to him so easily,” Izisha answered.

“Of course! I was told that the Hall of the Goddess is here to seek justice on behalf of a Golden Sun Knight from the Rhines. I hate to see people that behave ruthlessly and have no respect for the laws too, so if you need any help, the Casas are more than willing to share the burden with you,” the old man said respectfully.

—

The old man left the Hall of Deities with his people, leaving only Mo Fan, Izisha, and her silent bodyguard in the hall.

Mo Fan fell into deep thought while watching the elder of the Casas taking his leave. After some time, he fixed his eyes on Izisha!

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Izisha smiled, with just a hint of cunning.

“Edith takes orders from you!” Mo Fan blurted out.

Izisha did not say a word, but the cunning look in her eyes told Mo Fan her answer.

“So you didn’t come here to take me to court, you just needed a valid excuse to be here so you could save Herr Casa’s life?” Mo Fan asked.

“I truly hope that you will be punished according to your sins.” Izisha had the same smile.

The smile gave Mo Fan all the answer he needed!

So that was the truth?...

Most terrifyingly, no one other than him knew about it!

The Alps Institute, the Casas, even he himself, were nothing but pawns in Izisha’s hands...
