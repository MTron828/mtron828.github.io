The gourmet’s live stream happened to capture the whole incident. Someone on the Internet turned the final minute of the gourmet’s life into a clip, which spread rapidly among the people. In less than an hour, the whole of Europe knew Athens was being attacked by a Silver Moon Tyrant Titan!

There were many kinds of demon creatures in the wild, some with massive builds and bodies, while some were so ghastly that they could easily leave someone with recurring nightmares. Because of that, many countries forbade their people from spreading clips or images of demon creatures on the Internet. Many bold people who were not Mages could only satisfy their imaginations with information about Summoned Beasts that was made available to them.

Unfortunately, the dead gourmet had quite a following, and thousands of people had seen the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan’s true appearance during the live stream. Even though Tyrant Titans would occasionally roam along the outskirts of Athens, they never came within three kilometers of the safe zone. Most people only saw their distant silhouettes, and have never seen anything like the massive creature in the live stream.

The streets involved were at the foot of the mountains. The gentle slopes around Athens were like natural barriers, but a head with bloodshot eyes and a menacing look in them had suddenly risen from them. The visual impact was shocking even to a Mage, let alone the common folk.

The news spread wildly on the Internet. Many people were wondering how many casualties were caused by the attack. The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan could easily raze a whole district to the ground within a few minutes, seeing how huge it was!

“Damn it, those assh**** of the Hall of Knights. If they had come any later, I might be dead already! That Silver Moon Tyrant Titan is crazy strong. It broke through all my defenses with a single punch! I flew across a few streets and slammed hard into an office building. Luckily, it was after office hours, or I could have killed a few pretty white-collar ladies.

“It’s too scary. Why didn’t you tell me how strong the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was beforehand? I’m only a petty Advanced Mage. Can’t you stop torturing me for once!?” Zhao Manyan almost broke into tears.

“It’s fine, don’t worry, you are now in Athens, your broken left hand, right shoulder, ribs, back, dislocated jaw, crushed palm, and fractured knees aren’t really a great deal for the Healers in the Parthenon Temple!” Mo Fan comforted Zhao Manyan, who was currently lying on a white stretcher.

If Zhao Manyan had not been injured, he would immediately have bounced to his feet and fought Mo Fan with his life.

“It was lucky Zhao Manyan was around when it happened. He managed to protect the people on the streets from the boulder in time!” Brianca said.

“I’m retiring, I don’t want to fool around anymore. The other Advanced Mages are scared when they stumble into a Commander-level creature once a year, but the number of Ruler-level creatures I’ve encountered this year is higher than the number of girls I’ve hooked up with. I can’t take it anymore!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“Look at you, you are perfectly fine... Apas, let him have a nice dream. It’s nothing serious really, just some minor injuries,” Mo Fan said.

“Err... we did a thorough checkup on him. His inner organs are bleeding, with different degrees of damage. We can only treat his bones, we don’t dare treat his organs,” the Healer from the hospital said.

Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened. He was about to lose his mind.

“Apas, what are you waiting for? Hurry up!” Mo Fan blurted out. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Apas was standing between Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan. Her eyes suddenly turned golden, as dazzling as the sunrise. Zhao Manyan’s wild expression quickly calmed down. A few seconds later, he was sound asleep on the stretcher.

“Nurse, can you arrange someone to bring him to the Parthenon Temple?” Mo Fan said.

“The Parthenon Temple isn’t a place you can just visit as you wish!” the Healer Mo Fan had called a nurse grunted.

“I’ll ask Knight Dravo to pick him up,” Leng Qing said.

“How did he end up like this?” Mo Fan could not help but ask.

Mu Bai, who was not really injured, chuckled and said, “He’s a pretty noble guy, despite his annoying mouth. We had already prepared our retreat. The boulder didn’t really hit anyone, including the gourmet that was in the middle of his broadcast, who Heidi saved. The live broadcast was only interrupted after his equipment was messed up by the Space Magic. He wasn’t killed by the boulder like the people on the Internet claimed! When we were about to leave, Heidi heard a little kid was playing hide-and-seek nearby. His friends had all run for their lives, yet he was hiding without making any noise. We thought the kid wouldn’t make it, but Zhao Manyan stepped forward bravely, and so he ended up like this.”

“Mm, even Miss Brianca was knocked flying by the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan. If a Silver Moon Knight hadn’t arrived in time, Zhao Manyan would most likely be dead now... it was such a close call, the kid was basically right under the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan’s foot,” Heidi agreed. She also had a different impression of Zhao Manyan after what happened.

“Impressive, well done,” Mo Fan nodded. He turned to Apas and asked, “Err, Apas, is it too late to alter the dream? We should have given him a nice dream.”

Heidi, Mu Bai, Brianca, and Leng Qing were left speechless.

Despite the rumors that had spread rapidly on the Internet, the government soon clarified the situation, putting an end to the farce. However, unlike the Tyrant Titans the city had fended off in the past, this Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was quite determined to bring the city down with it. It showed no sign of retreating even after the people from the Hall of Knights showed up.

When Mo Fan headed to the west of the city, he saw the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan throwing a tantrum in the deserted streets. A few Silver Moon Knights were flying in the sky, and a few squads of Blue Star Knights were on standby on the ground. A Golden Sun Knight was standing on a tall telecommunication tower while the junior knights were establishing magic formations. A Lightning Punishment Formation had trapped the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan like a purple cage. The light of different Elements flickered across the dark streets, forming an Elemental storm whipping the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan fiercely.

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan cried out loudly. The entire city could hear it, yet the creature did not back away, despite facing the concentrated attacks.

It recklessly smashed through the Lightning Punishment Formation and charged at the Golden Sun Knight who was giving orders.

It took the Golden Sun Knight by surprise, and he quickly cast a Super Wind Spell in a panic.

The Thousand Leaves Saber spell swept across the sky like blue scythes. The wind razors landed on the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan, giving rise to many metallic clanking sounds!

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan’s skin was sturdier than steel. The Wind Spell did not inflict any damage on it. It suddenly threw a punch forward with all its might!

The punch produced a strong wind, sweeping at the Golden Sun Knight with ominous power and shattering the Thousand Leaves Saber. The Wind Spell did not stand a chance at all!

The blast sent the Golden Sun Knight flying. The loud rumble echoed throughout the city.

The people in Athens stared at the trembling night sky...

Athens had always been safe. The people would normally enjoy their peaceful lives even when a battle broke out in the city’s west, but the strong wind produced by that punch had interrupted their routines. However, the disturbance did not last for long. The people simply asked what was going on before continuing on with their lives, knowing that the Hall of Knights was already on the move. It was like a stone thrown into a lake. The ripples it stirred up soon dissipated.

“It could have killed the Golden Sun Knight with the punch, but it was off target slightly,” Mo Fan said after witnessing everything.

“It wasn’t off target, it was aiming it at the city!” Apas corrected him.

“Was it trying to...” Mo Fan looked behind him.

The Parthenon Temple was located in Athens. Even if anything happened, only the districts along the outskirts would be in danger. It was unlikely any danger would befall the city’s heart. The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was trying to make its way toward the city’s center, even though it knew it had no chance of breaking through the line of defense set up by the knights.

Even without Apas’ analysis, Mo Fan could easily sense the Silver Moon Tyrant Titan’s anger and despair. It was like a middle-aged man who had lost his only kin, spurred into doing something crazy after behaving calmly for a few days.

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan could have run away, but it chose not to. Its blood was pouring out like a stream, but it was still heading for the center of the city. Spells were blasting it like cannons, yet they did not stop it from moving its feet...

Strong winds produced by the impacts swept in all directions continuously. Mo Fan and Apas were standing on the top of a building. The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan was very close to him, but it did not pay attention to the people that were not blocking its path. Mo Fan watched the creature stride past him...

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan suddenly turned around and stared at the two tiny figures on the top of the building; they were not sure which of them caught its attention.

“All unauthorized personnel are to leave at once!” a Silver Moon Knight yelled at them

Mo Fan and Apas did not move, not planning to leave.

The Silver Moon Tyrant Titan stared at Apas and Mo Fan. Its eyes were too big, and filled with blood-red lines; it was difficult to tell who they were focusing on!
