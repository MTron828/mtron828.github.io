The flying dragons were terrified. They were suffering greatly under the darkness that was eating at their souls.

The Mages riding them were being crushed by the flames, too. Even if they knew how to defend against the scorching flames, they had no idea how to resist the darkness that was tearing through their hearts at the same time. Those who could stop the darkness in their hearts were struggling to resist the flames on the outside!

“You...you are challenging the authority of the Asia Magic Association!” Longmu snarled after he fled to safety.

Mo Fan could not have cared less about what he said. He did not mind whatever accusations they were heaping on him.

He had already made up his mind to put up a fight. Why would he be bothered by their regulations and restrictions? These regulations were exactly what they had abused to gain their power.

He was trying to bring down their authority!

The dragon riders were no match for Mo Fan. The darkness was further imbued with the Chaos Element, and the dragon riders felt like they had fallen into an endless swamp. They just managed to crawl out of a swamp of darkness when they found themselves at the bottom of another swamp.

Mo Fan was trampling them under his feet like little kids. They could not move or resist!

——

Dubai was a huge city, but the people on every street and in every corner could see the battle in the sky.

A person in a ragged coat, their hair disheveled and dirty, was leaning against a bin on a deserted street behind a tall building.

“It’s my teacher...” The person’s eyes suddenly glittered. She was staring into the sky above the building. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Is he trying to protect us? Is he making a distraction so we can leave the city?” The voice was coming out of a book that the woman was holding in her arms.

The book was opening and closing on its own. The voice was indeed coming out of the book.

“That’s great, I didn’t expect a kind man would step forward at a time like this. We should take hold of the opportunity to leave the city. We can get back at those pricks later!” the book said.

“I can’t abandon teacher. He’s doing it for Feng Zhoulong, and to tell the world about Magic Fusion,” Sharjah said with a soft but firm voice.

“Are you out of your mind? Don’t forget who you are! Everyone can die, but you can’t. Don’t you understand, Sharjah!?” The book started shaking like it was trying to break free from Sharjah’s hands.

“He’s the only person who has mastered Magic Fusion. If he dies, it will forever be lost.” Sharjah rose to her feet, never taking her eyes away from the sky.

The book was shaking harder. If it had hands, it would have dragged Sharjah away by force.

“Idiot, Magic Fusion is nowhere as valuable as you are!” the book screamed.

“How am I more valuable than Magic Fusion?” Sharjah grabbed the book.

The book seemed to know what Sharjah was thinking. It was desperately trying to escape, but Sharjah was holding onto it firmly!

“You must not open that page!” The book struggled fiercely.

“It was my mistake for not protecting Mr. Feng Zhoulong. I can’t let Mo Fan take the responsibility. I’m supposed to be the one who sacrifices my life. I should be the one declaring war against the Asia Magic Association!”

Sharjah tapped the book softly. Black vines immediately grew out of it.

The vines eventually turned into a bird. It was beating its wings, waiting for Sharjah to mount it.

Sharjah climbed onto it, holding the book tightly with one hand.

She flew higher into the sky, approaching the battle. Her coat fell off as she was weaving through the flames that were dissipating in the air, revealing her true appearance.

Her curly purple hair looked like Mandara vines. Her pale skin was covered in wounds. Her face was covered in filth, but it did not cover up how beautiful she was. Her purple and glittering eyes had a determined light, instead of delicateness and sorrow!

Mo Fan was not supposed to carry the burden alone. It was her fight!

The black color on the book slowly faded away, revealing the golden color beneath it. It was shining as brightly as the sun.

Sharjah finally reached Mo Fan’s altitude. The book in her hand had transformed into a heavenly book that was giving off a sacred light, further setting off her dazzling and sacred appearance!

“Sharjah?” Mo Fan was dumbfounded.

He knew she was in the city. He knew she was still alive.

He was overjoyed to see her!

Sharjah was familiar with Magic Fusion, while Mo Fan was not a qualified scholar. As long as Sharjah was still alive, so was Magic Fusion!

Mo Fan could only use Magic Fusion with the help of the gloves. Only Sharjah and Feng Zhoulong knew how to use Magic Fusion without relying on a medium!

“You shouldn’t call her that,” a man dressed in a silver and golden robe on the tower called out.

Mo Fan was not familiar with the voice, but he could not ignore it. The voice was calm and aloof, as if the man was naturally superior to the others.

“Chairman, there’s no need for you to show yourself. He’s just an extremist who is trying to lure you out,” Longmu said humbly.

“He’s not worthy for me to show myself, but it’s different now that she’s here...” Su Lu was walking in the air, but it was difficult to tell what magic he was using.

The magic Mo Fan had accumulated suddenly dissipated after Su Lu showed up.

The airflow had stabilized. The lightning and fire scattered across the sky had vanished. Even the distorted space was recovering rapidly.

The sky above the city was clear and blue, while the bright sun was hanging right above the city. The people were unable to see what was going on clearly because of its blinding light.

“However, I must thank you for luring her out,” Su Lu smiled at Mo Fan. He soon added in the same disdainful tone, “Unfortunately, a man like you will never understand the fight that is happening at the higher level.”

Mo Fan looked at Sharjah.

Sharjah slowly stepped forward and stood in front of Mo Fan. It seemed like she was trying to stop Su Lu from hurting him.

However, why would Sharjah dare to stand in front of the Asia Magic Association’s chairman with a murderous look in her eyes?

“Gabriel, you are too merciful. That is the reason why you have lost!” Su Lu smiled.

It was rare for Su Lu to smile so sincerely with his power and position. He was happy because he could finally trample someone as mysterious and powerful as him under his feet!

Gabriel? One of the Seven Great Angels of the Sacred City?

The Seven Great Angels were traveling around the world to maintain its order.

They would not show themselves easily. They had disguised themselves as ordinary people by living normal lives.

However, when the world was in danger, they would discard their disguises and take up their roles as the Great Angels!

Mo Fan stared at Sharjah in astonishment.

Sharjah… She was a Great Angel!

She was a protector of the world!
