Chapter 2973: Border On

Ki Kurokawa walked toward Mo Fan. He undid the tie around his neck and tore the uniform in disgust.

He displayed his muscular chest, firm arms, and scarred arms. A scar covered the part below the neck like an exaggerated tattoo.

Although Ki Kurokawa’s body was drastically different from the Blood Demons’, his face was corroded. Ki Kurokawa was a half-demon.

He was transforming into a Blood Demon but had not fully become one.

The appearance of Ki Kurokawa caused quite a stir in the court. The person who was the most infuriated was the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo.

He was responsible for freeing Ki Kurokawa from prison. Ki Kurokawa could take the place of someone from the West if he transformed into a Blood Demon.

However, Ki Kurokawa disobeyed the order and exposed himself.

Even though it was inevitable, and the moonless night was approaching, exposing himself at this time was not a wise decision.

…

Ki Kurokawa was an uncontrollable factor. In actuality, a lot of prisoners resembled him.

These people were Demon Kings from all over the world. They wouldn’t have been qualified to be held in the East Guardian Towers if they weren’t psychopaths and hadn’t committed heinous crimes.

Ki Kurokawa had also always detested the Red Demon. The creature who could order him around did not yet exist in this world. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He would do whatever he wanted!

“Many people like to act as the person they impersonate, but I have no interest in that. I am most interested in chopping your head off. I want to display it on my collection shelf.” Ki Kurokawa grinned.

For someone like him, it was impossible to suppress the desire to kill, just as someone who was starving would find it impossible to ignore the aroma of mouthwatering food.

Ki Kurokawa wants to slowly destroy all that lives.

When Ki Kurokawa walked, Mo Fan noticed his arm.

His left hand’s wrist was now covered in the pronounced scars that covered the rest of his body. But his palm was not what was attached to his wrist; rather, it was a pitch-black hook. The sharp, curved hook resembled the ready tail of a scorpion.

Ki Kurokawa attacked. He was like a strong and sturdy scorpion. He resembled a powerful, solid scorpion. He approached carefully and suddenly launched the scorpion hook at Mo Fan’s throat without warning.

There was no fancy magic sheen, just a deadly attack, at a speed that caught people off guard.

Mo Fan’s eyes suddenly changed color. His pupils widened, and the blurred figure of Ki Kuraokawa gradually became clear. Mo Fan saw that the black scars on his body were like some ancient animal patterns, which provided a strange force.

Mo Fan did not have much time to analyze it. He extended his right hand, and a black metal substance quickly wrapped around his arm. Then, a dragon claw appeared on his fist.

Ki Kurokawa was a killer, an Assassin Mage.

He trained his own special style of attack. He combined the abilities of the Shadow Element and Poison Element in his special way of attack, transforming himself into a vicious, black venomous scorpion that could slit the necks of his victims with ease.

However, Mo Fan saw through him.

If Ki Kurokawa was a poisonous scorpion, Mo Fan was a sharp-eyed dragon eagle. Mo Fan used his spiritual knowledge from the ninth world to see right through the venomous scorpion’s trump card. In terms of speed and power, Mo Fan and Ki Kurokawa were not of the same species.

Mo Fan attacked without the use of any fancy magic. He only used the dragon claw to attack Ki Kurokawa’s heart.

A split second would decide the winner and survival in this deadly confrontation.

Mo Fan moved away and avoided the Deadly Black Scorpion of Ki Kurokawa, but Ki Kurokawa could not avoid Mo Fan’s dragon claw piercing his heart.

Plink… Plink…

Black blood dripped from Ki Kurokawa’s chest. Mo Fan stretched his right hand forward and pushed Ki Kurokawa, who was only half a step away. At the same time, he withdrew his dragon claw, and his hand returned to normal. He had no trace of Ki Kurokawa’s blood on his hand.

“Don’t be so shocked. Most people can’t avoid my attack. You’re not alone.” Mo Fan stood there with a confident smile.

Ki Kurokawa was stunned. He could not even feel the pain from his chest.

It was too fast. In a matter of seconds, his life had been taken from him before the pain even spread through his body.

“It may not be a bad idea to die like this…” Ki Kurokawa did not have much energy to speak. He slumped to the ground like a heap of mud. Blood poured out of his chest. The blood pooled around him in a matter of seconds.

His corroded face started to look normal again. It seemed that the erosion of the Blood Demon had no longer affected him as he died.

“Is Ki Kurokawa dead?”

“Mo Fan is ten times more terrifying than Ki Kurokawa!”

“I couldn’t even see their movements!”

The two engaged in a battle that moved too quickly for the troops and guards to intervene in time. The laid-back Mo Fan stood in the center of the court. He made everyone shudder in fear and disbelief.

Ki Kurokawa was a Demon King.

Many famous and powerful people in the Japan Magic Association had been attacked. The murderer, who once instilled fear, was like a vulnerable child in front of Mo Fan. Mo Fan was the real Demon King!

“Mr. Mo Fan, thank you for killing this demon. I didn’t expect Ki Kurokawa to be hiding among the crowd. This is a mistake on our part,” said the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo.

‘Ki Kurokawa brought it upon himself. No one could stop it.’

A half-Blood Demon was unreliable, anyway. Since the Red Demon had not spiritually baptized him, he would make foolish decisions.

But the show had to go on!

The moonless night was coming soon!

At that time, no matter how rampant and powerful Mo Fan was, he could not win against the Red Demon.

“A murderer, who was imprisoned in the East Guardian Towers, lived in the Twin Guardian Towers arrogantly and freely attacked people in the court. The Twin Guardian Towers have come to this now? Chief, I remember you admitted in the previous emergency meeting that you brought Ki Kurokawa from East Guardian Towers and detained him in a secret place. Was this how you detained him? Does it mean that something is also wrong with the chief?” Mo Fan asked the Chief of the Towers, Shigekyo.

Shigekyo’s face darkened. He was a Blood Demon, but he could not admit it.

Unlike Ki Kurokawa, he was clever and knew about the importance of the moonless night. Anyone who was exposed before would be abandoned.

“Mo Fan, you can’t accuse the chief without direct evidence,” said Katana Mochizuki.
