Lehuo Town, Yulin’s Villa ...

The open-air pool was reflecting different colors under the LED lights. The water was extraordinarily clean, with a hint of elegance and nobility when covered in the colorful lighting. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

A well-decorated table stood beside the pool, various kinds of snacks and fruits on top of it.

Lingling, Zhang Xiaohou, Zhao Manyan, Chen Yi and Xinxia were seated at the table. The day was fairly cold, so none of them was interested in swimming. They were playing cards with bored looks on their faces.

“I don’t want to play anymore, Xinxia always wins.” Zhang Xiaohou threw the cards onto the table. He did not feel pleasant after losing a huge sum of his allowance in the games.

“Yeah, that’s right, Xinxia, you can’t cheat, you have to interpret other people’s thoughts from their reactions...” said Chen Yi.

Xinxia was slightly embarrassed. She pushed the stack of money back to everyone and said, “I didn’t do it on purpose.”

For some reason, Xinxia was able to read everyone’s mind even without casting any Psychic Spells. They couldn’t possibly ask her to close her eyes when playing cards, could they?

“I finally know why the casinos in Macao put ‘ No Psychic Magicians are allowed inside’ before the rule ‘ No underage kids allowed ,’” Zhao Manyan remarked helplessly.

As they were chatting, a few people came out from the pool, all of them also young in age. For some reason, the temperature of the water around them would drop as they were swimming in the pool. It felt like the water was about to freeze, too.

“Some capabilities turn into habits, which are hard to control. It’s like nobody is willing to swim with us in the same pool, no matter how hot the day is,” a handsome man in a swimming trunk with his eight packs exposed approached the group. He picked up a cocktail on the way and emptied it.

“Mu Xiu, no one here is talking to you. You don’t have to remind us of your existence. You’re invited here to guard the place, not to enjoy yourself a vacation. We even paid you!” said Zhao Manyan to the man unpleasantly.

Upon hearing this, another girl with an attractive figure came out of the pool. She flung her hair in a self-assumed elegant manner and giggled like a fox, “This is Shanghai. Do you think the safe zone is a decoration? I don’t think any creature is able to come all the way here. Even if the creature managed to come this far, our Mu Clan is the specialist when dealing with Fire Elemental creatures. The Demon-Sealing Ice Formation is enough to handle everything. I don’t think our help is needed, hehe~”

The group totally ignored Mu Xiu and Mu Tingle, the two unwanted guests. They continued to discuss some other topics.

“By the way, Xinxia, why did the Drifting Sand River become restless all of a sudden? Was it because of the Fire Calamity?” blurted out Zhang Xiaohou when the thought crossed his mind.

Xinxia shook her head and said, “It’s just a coincidence. The Fire Calamity doesn’t affect the peace in the Drifting Sand River. I can feel that it’s because of something in the east, like something huge is about to happen.”

“We are so out of luck. First the Fire Calamity, then the raging Drifting Sand River...” complained Zhao Manyan.

“Something feels strange to me too. Chen Yi, do you know why your mother asked you to harm the Fiery Sorceress? Normally, since she used to be close with the Fiery Sorceress, it would only make sense if she was the one who did it.” Lingling was still bothered by the incident.

“I don’t know, my mum only gave me the Grimsteel Spike and told me when to strike, so I just followed her instructions. It felt too easy to be true.” Chen Yi shook her head as she recalled attacking the Fiery Sorceress.

“Chen Yi, you’ve done something stupid...”

As the group was discussing, a familiar voice barged in. The group did not realize it at first, but as they were about to respond, they suddenly recalled the owner of the voice, leaving them with widened eyes as they turned around and looked behind them...

“Mo Fan!”

“Holy crap, when did you get here? That was quick!”

Zhang Xiaohou and Zhao Manyan went up to Mo Fan and gave him hugs and fists excitedly.

Mo Fan pushed the two idiots away and walked up to Xinxia.

He believed that if Xinxia could run, she would be the first to dive into his hug. As such, Mo Fan was lazy to waste his emotion on the two idiots.

Mo Fan cut straight to the topic. He hugged Xinxia in his arms, making the girl blush, but she did not resist and placed her head on his shoulder obediently...

“Mm, and you are?”

“Mo Fan, you piece of shit, the lava has swept you away, but you still managed to bring such a gorgeous lady with you...”

“Piss off!”

Mo Fan was trying to enjoy some time with Xinxia, yet the two idiots had totally disturbed the atmosphere. Xinxia glared at Mo Fan, implying him to explain himself before letting him hug her for another second!

“She’s Nanyu, from the military. She followed me here because she has found some leads about something that she has been investigating for a long time,” explained Mo Fan.

Nanyu did not join the conversation. She found herself a spot and sat down. Only Zhang Xiaohou, who was also a soldier, took the initiative to talk to her. The others did not bother speaking to her.

“Why did you say that Chen Yi has done something stupid?” asked Lingling, who was more concerned about the topic.

“When the lava swept me away, it was the Fiery Sorceress that saved my life. She isn’t hostile toward humans at all...” Mo Fan roughly explained his experience with the Fiery Sorceress to the group.

The group could tell that the Fiery Sorceress was friendly, too. She had approached them and welcomed them. Not only did she gift them with the Fire Cloud Fruits which could provide them some Fire Resistance, she even led them out of the maze-like Fire Cloud Woods.

However, none of them had expected what happened after that, and they were unaware that the Fiery Sorceress had saved Mo Fan’s life too...

“Now that we’ve made her angry, it’s hard to tell what’s going to happen.”

“We’re so far away, I don’t think she would chase us all the way here. It’s not easy to trespass into Shanghai’s safe zone. The fortresses around Shanghai would wipe out any demon beasts that try to invade the city.”

“If that’s the case, Zhao Yulin wouldn’t bother setting up such an incredible defense here, placing the entire hill under alert,” harrumphed Lingling coldly, glancing at the Magicians patrolling the place even at night.

The words immediately reminded the group, and the atmosphere intensified significantly.

——-

At the Southill Park of Lehuo Town, on a grass field with an open vision of the sky, a couple was lying on the ground, hugging one another while watching the night sky and the lit-up town in the distance.

“I don’t care, if you really love me, why couldn’t you prepare a hundred thousand as the betrothal gift to convince my parents?” said a girl with a fringe hairstyle and an oval-shaped face.

“I’m already in my twenties. It’s embarrassing to ask my family for the money. You should think about it in my place too, I’ve already given you my wage every month,” said the man in a factory uniform. He was obviously a lad working in the town, who had gone on a date straight after work.

The girl was not willing to listen to his words. She raised her head arrogantly.

A brilliant light swept past the night sky, leaving a trail behind it. The grey clouds of dust created by the factories were fully lit up, resulting in a mysterious, spectacular view!

“Ah, it’s a shooting star!” yelled the girl excitedly. Her face blushed with joy.

“It’s true, quick, make a wish!”

The two immediately closed their eyes and bowed their heads onto their hands sincerely as they made their wishes.

The sky of the city was usually filled with pollution. Even a meteor shower was not visible due to the pollution, let alone a shooting star. It was like a miracle that they were able to see it. Wasn’t that a clear sign that they were one another’s true love?

However, as the two opened their eyes and were about to share their wishes, their eyes widened with doubt and astonishment!

The night sky ahead was blazing red!

The shooting star had descended upon Lehuo Town in just a very short time, turning into a meteorite huge enough to light up the town like day!

The scorching, blazing meteorite fell rapidly from the sky, and even the air began to burn...

Judging by the direction it was heading in, it was most likely going to crash into the hill in Lehuo Town, where the European-style mansion was!
