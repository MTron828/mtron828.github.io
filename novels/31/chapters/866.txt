Mu Ningxue knew the pinch her family was currently in, yet she could not guarantee if she could make her way back to the national team, nor was she confident that she could prove her family’s innocence by earning a reputation in the World College Tournament...

Now she had found a way to slightly ease up the pressure her family was getting from the families of the Black Vatican’s victims. She could help deal with the remaining members of the Black Vatican in their country!

It was not just for the sake of her family, but also a way to vent her hatred! Her family was also a victim of the evil deeds committed by the Black Vatican, yet they had to bear the blame. She was scared that the families of the victims would lose control.

The truth was, it had already happened. Her youngest cousin had been seriously injured in a hit and run when he was traveling on the outskirts of the city.

“If we are well-prepared, there won’t be any danger. Mo Fan, I really need this opportunity,” Mu Ningxue had never talked to Mo Fan like this. She only hoped Mo Fan could understand that she was not blinded by her emotions. She still had a clear mind, and she was determined to solve the problems of her family.

“You have never had any contact with the Black Vatican, you have no idea how cruel and cunning they are...” Mo Fan hoped Mu Ningxue could understand that it was not a simple quest. The Black Vatican was ten times, or even a hundred times scarier than the demon creatures!

“Which is why I’ll listen to you,” Mu Ningxue’s eyes flickered firmly. She understood she was not as experienced compared to Mo Fan, who had basically fought his way up since the very beginning.

“Even if I reject it, you will still go to Chongming Island to look for clues, right?” Mo Fan realized helplessly.

Lingling had leaked too much information. Mo Fan was utterly speechless. -Isn’t she extremely cautious normally? Why was she so clumsy today?! Doesn’t she know information about the Black Vatican is meant to be kept confidential!?-

“Yes!,” Mu Ningxue confirmed confidently.

She knew that she would easily fall into the Black Vatican’s trap if she was alone. She had not underestimated those scum. Therefore, she hoped Mo Fan was willing to help her, as she believed Mo Fan was experienced at dealing with the Black Vatican.

Mo Fan sighed. “You have really made up your mind to go. But, you must remember, you will listen to me at all times, and you won’t act on impulse. Those assholes are really tricky to deal with,” said Mo Fan.

Mu Ningxue laughed. Her eyes were glittering. Mo Fan was dazed by the sight.

That smile was so dazzling that it was going to kill him!

Mo Fan clearly felt his heart pounding heavily at that particular instant.

-Damn it, the Black Vatican is nothing. If I can destroy them once, and twice, I can destroy them ten times, or even a hundred times!-

—-

After reaching an agreement, Mo Fan brought Mu Ningxue to Clearsky Hunter Agency.

Mo Fan would not seriously believe whatever Lingling blurted out. He still had to ask his Senior Sister Leng Qing and Old Bao for their opinions, make sure that Chongming Island was not a lion’s den, and learn more about the information that the Enforcement Union had gathered.

Leng Qing was indeed at the agency. When Mo Fan thought about it, Leng Qing was the only source that Lingling could get the information from. On top of that, she must have heard the information through eavesdropping. No one could possibly stop the little girl from eavesdropping if something caught her attention.

“Senior Sister,” Mo Fan sat at the bar and saw Leng Qing mixing some drinks, wearing an apron. With her slender figure, she had a different kind of charm today.

“Oh, you’re here,” Leng Qing looked at Mo Fan, before glancing at Mu Ningxue behind him. She calmly asked, “Do you two want any drinks?”

“A blueberry cocktail.”

“Coke with lemon for me.”

It was obvious that it had been a while since Leng Qing last mixed a drink here. She seemed rather rusty, as it took her quite some time to finish preparing the drinks. She also prepared herself a cocktail. Lingling wanted to take a sip, but immediately stopped when Leng Qing glared at her. The elder sister poured a cup of hot milk for Lingling, in a cute little cup with cartoons on it.

Lingling puffed her cheeks out. She seemed very unhappy!

“Lingling told you about it?” asked Leng Qing calmly, who seemed to know everything too.

“Did Salan really escape through Chongming Island?” asked Mo Fan.

“Mmm, this Salan is very cunning. We initially thought we had already wiped out the Black Vatican’s influence in Shanghai. Therefore, we sent most of our people to patrol other cities, but we completely forgot about Chongming Island, as it looked perfectly normal until recently.” Leng Qing took her apron off and sat opposite Mu Ningxue and Mo Fan.

“Which means Chongming Island is the last foothold for the Black Vatican in our country?” asked Mo Fan.

“It should be. They did a good job hiding it. If Salan didn’t escape through there, I believe we would never have realized that the Black Vatican had a base at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Their cover at Chongming Island has been perfect over the past ten years,” said Leng Qing.

“Then why hasn’t the Enforcement Union wiped them out, if you already know they are on the island?” asked Mo Fan.

“Chongming Island isn’t small. It has a dozen towns, with a population of over seven hundred thousand people. We assumed the Black Vatican’s base is disguised as some company, factory, ranch or workstation. We already sent someone there to investigate, but they are all ordinary businesses... Chongming Island is an independent island with obvious entrances. According to reliable sources of information, the Black Vatican must be watching the entrances. If they see people of the Enforcement Union, they are going to vanish without a trace. We didn’t want to inadvertently alert them,” said Leng Qing.

“That’s why you need Hunters; no matter how capable the Black Vatican is, they won’t be able to keep an eye on every Hunter?” said Mo Fan.

“Mmm, but the other reputable private agencies aren’t willing to accept the quest. It’s the Black Vatican we’re speaking of, after all; they are afraid that the Black Vatican will take revenge,” Leng Qing said softly.

The Black Vatican was so powerful that even many of the powerful factions were afraid of them. Even though everyone despised the Black Vatican and wanted to skin them, pull out their tendons, and eat their bones, only the Enforcement Union was fearless enough to take on the Black Vatican. Once, a renowned family had participated in an operation to uproot the Black Vatican, but in the end, the family was soon targeted by the vengeful Black Vatican and went downhill...

It was a clear picture of human nature. The Internet, the society, and media... there were always lots of righteous people condemning the power of evil, as if they are willing to dive into boiling water and walk on fire to eliminate the evil influences. However, when it was time to face the real evil, most people would end up as bystanders, afraid to be involved and set themselves on fire! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They were all sheep, yet they still disguised themselves as fierce tigers. The families of the victims of the Ancient Capital were not fully responsible for placing Mu Ningxue’s family in such a tough spot. The main culprit was actually those who pretended to be righteous and blindly followed the tide!

“We need someone who is trustworthy and experienced with the Black Vatican,” admitted Leng Qing.
