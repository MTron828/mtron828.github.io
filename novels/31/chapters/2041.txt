Chapter 2043: Stone of Drool

The Night Amethyst!

Mo Fan almost cried out at the top of his lungs, but his joyful expression twisted when he saw the man walking out of the snow.

Mu Feiluan came out of the curtain while tossing the Night Amethyst into the air constantly, as he was bored. The calm look on his face vanished immediately when he stumbled into Mo Fan and his weird expression. He harrumphed, “Stop blocking my way. I don’t have time to deal with you today, but it doesn’t mean I won’t in the future!”

Mo Fan stared at the Night Amethyst on Mu Feiluan’s hand. The strange thing was, the Night Amethyst still had the little cub’s drool on it. It had not dried even after so long. Mu Feiluan seemed to treat his hands preciously. He noticed the sticky substance on the Night Amethyst was good at lubricating his hands. He even rubbed the Night Amethyst on the back of his hand.

Is he using the little cub’s drool like hand lotion?

Mo Fan was impressed by Mu Feiluan’s taste!

Mo Fan raised his brows and asked Mu Feiluan, “Why are you lubricating your hand with my pet’s pacifier? We might not be on friendly terms, but you are a respected person of the Mu Clan. Why did you take my pet’s pacifier?”

Mu Feiluan was stunned. He immediately looked at his hands.

The little cub’s drool was like glue. It did not freeze despite the low temperature, nor did it dry up because of the wind. The truth was, many white tigers would groom themselves with their drool to protect their paws.

Mo Fan realized Mu Feiluan had no clue what he was holding, and simply treated it like a little pebble. He immediately figured out a way to disgust Mu Feiluan!

He did not even have to do it on purpose. Mu Feiluan had already been rubbing the little cub’s drool on the back of his hand!

Mu Feiluan was not an idiot, and was not going to believe Mo Fan’s words right away.

The funny thing was, the little cub was very cooperative. She opened her mouth wide as drool leaked out of it. She purposely tilted her head to one side so Mu Feiluan could see the lubricant on the Night Amethyst was the same as the drool that was leaking out of her mouth.

“What kind of nonsense are you going on about? Step aside, or I won’t show you any mercy!” Mu Feiluan’s face twisted, but he did not want to admit it.

Mo Fan smiled. He politely stepped aside to give way.

Mu Feiluan quickly went on ahead. He was initially pulling the curtain of snow to the side while he walked through it elegantly. However, his thoughts were in a mess after encountering Mo Fan and the little cub. The snow began to fall on his head and shoulders.

“Follow him! Ge’s going to throw the thing away after rounding the corner ahead... forget it, Night Rakshasa, go get it for me, I don’t trust the little cub!” Mo Fan interrupted himself.

Mu Feiluan’s face was twitching. He initially thought the stone was something valuable, since its secretion could protect his hands from the icy wind. To his surprise, it was a little creature’s drool!

Mu Feiluan threw his beloved stone down the cliff after turning the corner. He even took out a handkerchief from the pocket of his shirt and wiped his hands clean.

Mu Feiluan folded the handkerchief and put it back into the pocket after his hands were clean from the sticky substance. However, he immediately recalled how the little cub was drooling while tilting her head to one side. He frowned and threw his favorite handkerchief away, too!

He was obsessed with cleanliness. He even thought he might chop his right hand off and ask a Healer to help him grow a new one, let alone throw his favorite handkerchief away!

Mo Fan was extremely pleased with the Night Rakshasa’s diligence. She returned with the Night Amethyst only a few minutes later.

The Night Rakshasa was also disgusted by the little cub. She purposely wrapped a piece of cloth around the Night Amethyst to keep her fingers clean. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Jiang Yu’s little magical cat was extremely cool. She was wearing tall boots and a pair of gloves. When she was walking on two legs and shunning everything around her, it almost urged people to fall to their knees and submit to her.

The little cub was overjoyed when she got her pacifier back. She immediately jumped forward to grab the Night Amethyst in her mouth. She felt more secure when the Night Amethyst was emitting a cool aura in her mouth.

“I’ll hold onto it for now!” Mo Fan immediately snatched up the Night Amethyst.

As he thought, the Night Amethyst was once again covered in the little cub’s drool. It was a lot drier after Mo Fan wiped it on his pants.

He wondered why the God of Darkness was so fond of these stones. If the God of Darkness was going to sleep on them like a pillow, he wondered if the God of Darkness would still accept a Night Amethyst that was covered in drool...

The God of Darkness had to accept it, as they had only found one Night Amethyst after searching Tianshan Mountain for so long. They were lucky to get it back, too. The seven-hundred-year-old Tianshan Sacred Lotus was merely a bonus. This trip to Tianshan Mountain had been like paying the devil a visit. They did not want to set their foot on the mountain again. They did not even want to drink the mineral water of the same brand!

“We can finally save Mu Bai!” Zhao Manyan let out a relieved sigh.

Zhao Manyan had always shunned Mu Bai because of his personality, but he had been missing him a lot ever since he was lying in the coffin. He still had so many shameless things to tell him. He would greatly regret it if Mu Bai died just like that!

“Is it time for us to leave the mountain? If we don’t, we will end up becoming the ones who need rescue.”

“Yeah, we are done here... by the way, the Night Rakshasa has taken so many valuables. How are we going to split them? Jiang Yu, don’t you keep quiet about it. Even though it was the Night Rakshasa who retrieved them, you wouldn’t have made it to the Scar of Tianshan Mountain without us in the first place!” Zhao Manyan was still concerned about the valuables they stole from the Frosty Ancient Eagles’ nest.

“Do I look like someone who would keep the loot to myself?” Jiang Yu said.

“What about the Tianshan Sacred Lotus?” Guan Yu asked.

“Well.. .we only have seven petals, even if we want to split them evenly,” Mo Fan said helplessly.

“I won’t need one. I just need its dew,” Mu Ningxue spoke up.

Mu Ningxue was not interested in the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. She was more concerned about her Third and Fourth Elements. Everything was worth it as long as she had the dew of the Tianshan Sacred Lotus. Additionally, she had also helped Qin Yu’er to escape the Heresy Judgment Court.

“It’s fine, we will give those who didn’t get the Tianshan Sacred Lotus other valuables to make up for it. HAHAHA, if Yassen, Zhao Kang, Kuma, and the others knew we had the seven-hundred-year-old Tianshan Sacred Lotus because of the little cub’s help, they might lose their minds!” Zhao Manyan burst out laughing.
