3058 Mo Fan’s Key

The world was huge, this was especially after Mo Fan ascended to his current realm. He even felt as if it was his first time coming into contact with the real world, like a butterfly that had broken free of its cocoon. It was only then that he realized the tree that he had been resting against was just one of the trees in a large forest. There were also seas, deserts, and an infinite starry sky outside the forest.

Of course, at that moment, those were not Mo Fan’s main issues to explore or to concern himself about.

Even after he transformed into a butterfly, many wild beasts laid their eyes on him like hungry wolves. As such, Mo Fan had to fight against the wild beasts before he could enjoy his life.

‘No way. The divine oath started from the origin of my soul. Unless I crush the origin of my soul, I will always be controlled by the divine oath. No wonder no one in Holy City dared lynch me. The divine oath is truly awesome!’

!!

Mo Fan found a Mayfly Soul Tree. As long as the young wolves of the Royal Pattern Wolf ate one tiny Mayfly Soul, they would advance to commander level. A large Mayfly Soul was likely to produce a ruler-level creature, or at the very least, shape a ruler-level soul.

Mo Fan’s Eight Souls were already very powerful. Gathering the power of the Eight Souls to break the shackles of the divine oath was so strenuous that he almost crushed his own soul.

If it was someone else who cast the soul-binding magic on Mo Fan, with Mo Fan’s current level of spiritual realm and strength of his soul, he would have easily broken it. However, this time, Mo Fan was the one who recited the divine oath.

Hence, the origin of the incantation came from his own soul. It would be very difficult if he forcefully broke the divine oath.

It was no surprise that Holy City used the ancient incantation as a means of self-redemption. Those who recited the divine oath were no different from nullifying their own cultivation!

“If only these mayflies could suck away my souls that had been chained. Oh, I know there’s a way!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Suddenly, Mo Fan howled in excitement.

Howl!

Mo Fan took the lead to howl. Inside the wolf valley, a few thousand white wolves howled as their spiritual leader howled.

Inside the moonless Summoning Plane, the wolves howled at the sky. The small monsters and demons a few dozen miles around were so terrified that they trembled violently.

“Why are you howling? Keep quiet!” Mo Fan said gruffly.

The wolf pack lowered their heads. In order to ease the tension, they stuck out their tongues, looking cute and stupid.

“Continue to open up more territory for me. I’m leaving now.” Mo Fan instructed the Royal Pattern Wolf and the other Moon Devouring Wolves.

The Royal Pattern Wolf and the Moon Devouring Wolves could not help but wail upon learning that Mo Fan was about to leave them.

With Mo Fan around, the wolf valley would be like an imperial army. The wolf army razed the demonic species that had mistreated them to the ground. Within a few months, the Royal Pattern Wolf and its gang had occupied the black barren land. They lived a carefree life like that of a tyrant.

They lacked a leader if Mo Fan left them. This might attract even more powerful demonic species. By then, they would face setbacks and have a hard time making a comeback.

“Don’t worry. If you really can’t hold them back, go to the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower in the west and find your big brother, Raiju. I’ve informed it to protect you,” said Mo Fan.

Raiju was Mo Fan’s Summoning Creature from the ancient magic portal. It had proven its divine power in Licheng Afterglow Island.

After Mo Fan had “baptized” it and with the addition of the conquest of the Summoning Plane, Raiju became the Great Raiju. Its strength was as powerful as the Eight-headed Serpent. As long as the wolf pack did not encounter an emperor-level demonic species, the Great Raiju could take them down.

It was only then that the Old Wolf felt more at ease upon hearing Mo Fan’s explanation.

The Thousand Tribe Elf Tower was considered a city in that land. Meanwhile, the wolves’ habitat was considered the countryside. With the Great Raiju’s support, everything would be fine.

“I need the Mayfly Soul Tree, find it for me, okay?” Mo Fan said to the Royal Pattern Wolf.

Howl!

The Royal Pattern Wolf promised it would not forget his order.

The Mayfly Soul Tree was the best “milk powder” for Mo Fan’s Eight Souls. The bigger the Mayfly Soul Tree was, the more nutritious it was.

It did not have to take long before Mo Fan could give birth to his ninth and tenth elements. If he had to survive Holy City’s judgment, he had to ensure there was sufficient “milk powder” for him!

…

A whole day passed within the blink of an eye.

Zu Xiangtian walked into the courtyard reluctantly and placed a box of Chinese food before Mo Fan.

“Why don’t you order Sichuan hot pot?” Zu Xiangtian seethed in fury.

He was in a deep slumber when he was ordered to deliver Mo Fan supper. On top of that, he had to collect Mo Fan’s supper from a Chinese restaurant in a remote lane at District 12.

Did Mo Fan have a few screws loose in his head?!

“Makes sense. Bring an induction cooker next time, then we can have hot pot together.” Mo Fan nodded. It was true that he craved hot pot.

“Hah!” Zu Xiangtian gave him a fake smile.

“Do you want some?”

“I’ve no appetite.”

…

Zu Xiangtian was still in a fit of rage. He carried a box of rubbish and walked out of the Holy Palace. As he was on the way back to his house, he saw a rubbish bin. Zu Xiangtian stuffed the box of rubbish into the bin.

Soon, Zu Xiangtian was far away from the rubbish bin. Meanwhile, a man with a slender figure appeared next to the rubbish bin which was still shaking and making a sound.

The man looked pale, but his lips were red. He hid his cheeks in his collar. The brim of his cap was low. It was difficult to see his face.

He wore gloves. He reached out for the rubbish bin and found the box of rubbish. After that, he quickly disappeared in the middle of the night.

A month ago, Archangel Michael and Archangel Ramiel refused to let Mo Fan and Sharjah come into contact with each other. In the past few months, Sharjah had difficult times in Holy City. As an archangel who had just returned to the city, she was boycotted by the elder angels. This was especially after they knew that she sided with Mo Fan.

Instead of finding Mo Fan’s evidence to make him lose the public’s trust, the elder angels took the opportunity to rob Sharjah of her rights in the previous battle.

The moment Sharjah lost her power, it would be difficult for Mo Fan to protect himself in Holy City.

Mo Fan could not contact Sharjah, so he could only use this way to send his message.

The rubbish that Zu Xiangtian’s took out was Mo Fan’s important way of communicating with outsiders.

Mo Fan was aware that his friends would not stand by on the matter. They would do everything they could to obtain a verdict in his favor. However, what mattered most to Mo Fan was to find every possible way to break the divine oath.

The divine oath was a life-saving charm. Likewise, it was also a killing curse. It bought him sufficient time. Similarly, it would also kill him without giving him the slightest ability to fight back.

…

“Bug Valley in Helan Mountain?” Liu Ru opened Mo Fan’s food box and read his secret message.

The Bug Valley in Helan Mountain was the key that Mo Fan needed urgently.

But Liu Ru had no idea what was inside the Bug Valley. She quickly passed the message to others.

“I know what he needs. I’ll find it for him.” Mu Bai understood Mo Fan’s signal.

The Bug Valley in Helan Mountain contained Star Bugs that could suck a human’s soul. The bizarre Star Bugs had gone after Mo Fan and Mu Bai for several prairies before. They would become Mo Fan’s key to his rescue!
