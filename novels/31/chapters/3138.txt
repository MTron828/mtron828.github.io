Chapter 3138 - 3138: MO Fan’s Pseudo Forbidden Curse

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Lilith started laughing hard once she heard what MO Fan said. Her laughter was incredibly seductive but also psychotic. Even someone like the Bright Blood King seldom said something so arrogant.

While she sashayed, she flicked the air as if she was plucking strings on an instrument. In fact, her movements were producing sounds.

The musical notes and threads she spread all across the Four Spirits Killing Fields allowed her to control all of the Einherjar Spirits there. The notes controlled their minds, while the latter controlled their bodies.

The Einherjar Spirits under Lilith’s control released an increasingly bright evil light. It was as though they had just received a rousing speech from the queen of the demonic world. The evil light made them look as if they were adorned in divine armor and equipped with divine weapons. Some of the Einherjar Spirits even experienced major transformations.

Within a moment, they surrounded Lilith, like she was the true ruler of the land. Everything was under her control!

As Lilith pointed forward, the divine creature with the head of a dog and the body of a man led the charge. It was incredibly large, and it emanated an ancient, golden glow, which was known as underworld light.

This light was similar to the divine light from Hades, Khufu. However, it did not exude rot and fear like the Undying. In fact, it gave off an air of superiority as if it could reincarnate at any moment.

“Anubis, lead the charge and make sure that this foreigner learns who actually has the right to say such things on the Dark Plane!” Lilith shouted.

Anubis sneered and revealed a mouth full of golden fangs.

It stared at MO Fan and said, “I’ve heard of you before. The Sphinx told me about you.”

The Sphinx?

This divine creature of hell, with the body of a lion and the face of a man, had once wreaked havoc in Northern Xinjiang!

So, they were old enemies!

MO Fan could not figure out the relationship between the Sphinx and Anubis, but even if this was not the real Anubis, he was going to beat it up to a pulp!

Anubis raised its hand and summoned a Supreme Staff!

MO Fan originally thought that Anubis would use the staff to release a peerless underworld spell, but it just threw the staff at him.

The staff activated thousands of curses, and they acted like stars of death falling from the sky. As the staff fell toward MO Fan, the “stars of death” shot down as well.

The powerful attack came too suddenly, and MO Fan did not have time to dodge it. When he looked up, he felt as if he was standing under a starry sky. The feeling of the sky falling down was terrifying, and it brought about a fear that could not be conquered through sheer willpower alone. It could destroy a human’s mental defenses in an instant. Dodging would be meaningless, but that was not all. Any human might end up being destroyed at this moment!

MO Fan could already feel the mighty weight of the staff coming at him, and it was quickly followed by an attack against his divine will. If he wanted to fight against this divine power, he needed to make sure that his divine will did not crumble.

Relying solely on the Black Dragon Armor’s dragon sense and Dragon Deterrence was likely not enough to defeat Anubis. So, MO Fan had to summon another power: the divine eyes he had borrowed from Apas!

MO Fan knew what Lingling had gone through at the Nile. He kept himself up to date with everything, including the accident where some evildoer awakened Medusa’s mother. In the end, it was not those schemers or Khufu who benefitted from the accident, but ADas, who had officiallv become Dart of Medusa’s bloodline!

Once Apas got used to her position as ruler, she gave MO Fan a blessing.

It was the ability to use her divine eyes.

Even though MO Fan could only use Apas’s blessing three times, with the old and noble divine power, MO Fan had the confidence to stand against an old God of Death like Anubis!

MO Fan’s eyes then shone with an awe-inspiring golden light.

It was reminiscent of a regal and bright burning sun.

He looked up and stared at the mighty Anubis. Slight anger filled his eyes, and the stars of death that covered the sky turned to dust.

The curse marks around him then started to evaporate, and the eternal curse chains went up in flames. When MO Fan used the divine eyes, he was like a god who stood above Medusa’s mother. Since his soul itself held the Vermilion Bird’s Sacred Flame, the divine eyes did not just freeze, wilt, or crush the curses. They also burned, purified, and destroyed them!

The power of the divine eyes was so great that all the Einherjar Spirits moved back rapidly. They did not want to have their bodies and souls destroyed. Plus, they knew that MO Fan was a supreme being from the land of the living.

Otherwise, they would have thought that he was the reincarnation of the Sun God, who had come to restore order in all realms and planes.

However, when powerful beings fought, there would always be collateral damage.

A few Einherjar Spirits under Lilith’s control had wanted to gain notoriety through this battle, but they ended up being reduced to a plume of smoke. They could not even retain their bodies.

As for Anubis, it was indeed much stronger than the Sphinx. Its golden armor was damaged, but it withstood the fatal attack.

It stumbled backward a little before it widened its eyes in disbelief.

It was shocked and puzzled. How did this mysterious magician from the East gain control of the divine power that belonged to the ancient civilization it came from?

“You’re a thief!” Anubis was furious. It felt that MO Fan had stolen its civilization’s power!

“It’s also possible that the ones you worship have already submitted themselves to me, you know?” MO Fan smirked even more arrogantly.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Have you experienced the God of Death’s true anger?” Anubis cast aside its staff and raised its hands. It looked like it was planning to use the Other Dimension to summon a world-ending divine power.

“The God of Death?” MO Fan sneered derisively and said, “I really can’t remember all your gods, but I’ll let you have a taste of my gods. In my civilization, the place in charge of death is known as the Ten Halls, and do you know my title in the mortal world?”

“What’s your title?” Anubis demanded coldly.

MO Fan said, “Mo.”

At the same time, he rose while enveloped by the Sacred Feathers. The feathers burned brilliantly, and the flames roared like tidal waves. MO Fan, who loved using his body as “ground zero,” charged into the sky again and headed straight for Anubis.

Then, he said, “The Bringer of Death.”

The divine flames exploded in a dense wave before swirling around MO Fan as he flew. After that, they formed into a dragon that seemed to shoot up from the ground.

By the time MO Fan rose to the highest point, the flames had grown so numerous that they had branched into multiple fire dragons. At first glance, they looked similar to the Nine Halls Fiery Fist, but the rising dragons were even bigger. If one dragon was already bigger than one Nine Halls Fiery Fist, then the large number of fire dragons certainly made for a startling sight.

They encircled MO Fan like he was the ruler of heaven, and they were just his soldiers, even though they were noble dragons. This sight was the result of MO Fan’s great power taking shape, and while it was a shocking scene, its true power was much more terrifying than it looked. In the end, MO Fan completed his title. “King of Flame.”

MO, the Bringer of Death and King of Flame.

This was MO Fan’s title in the human world. On the other hand, Anubis was an ancient God of Death who was still worshiped by the people in the Nile. However, the God of Death was not the most respected god in the mysterious country in the East.

MO Fan might not be so arrogant that he would compare himself to the gods in heaven, but he was indeed worthy of calling himself the Bringer of Death. So, he was going to teach Anubis a lesson on how to be a proper God of Death.

Rumble!

The sound of tidal waves was delayed. In fact, when MO Fan uttered his full title, he already threw a forward punch, and the thousands of dragons had landed on Anubis’s face.

Its face was covered by an ancient mask, but it shattered.

Blood spilled out from its face, and the mighty Anubis staggered before falling backward. Even when Anubis crashed on the ground, MO Fan’s King of Flame’s Heavenly Fist continued to ram into it like a meteor shower.

Anubis began squirming in pain. MO Fan’s attacks were concentrated as he only hit its face. Hence, when the power of his barrage reached its peak, Anubis’s head was forced into the ground, while its body remained standing. When its body finally served as its gravestone, MO Fan finally stopped attacking. He then returned to the ground.

He lowered his hands, allowed his energy to sink to his Dantian region, and took a deep breath.

The fight was over, and he could let his energy calm down.

It might have looked like MO Fan had just jumped up into the sky and released a barrage of meteors. However, many skills were involved in the execution of the attack.

First of all, it was already impossible for an immortal martial artist from the Immortal Martial Artist World to release such a barrage of punches within a short amount of time. So, they could not have made flames gather together like bulbs of flowers before forming dragons. If they wanted to do that, they would need precise calculations and perfect execution.

Second of all, this was not just the divine power of the Fire Element. MO Fan had fused it with the Chaos Element and Space Element as well. He even used the time powers from Apas’s divine eyes, which had yet to fully fade away.

He first expanded one part of the space around him and stuffed it full with

Divine Flame Fists. After that, he expanded it so that the energy inside would spread out. Then, he used the time power to freeze time. While time stopped, he unleashed the entire barrage of punches (if time had been moving, he might have needed more than ten minutes to do this). Lastly, he made time reverse at a rapid pace.

That was how he put up a show of him riding on a myriad of red dragons like a god. It was also how he managed to kill Anubis in “one strike.”

In addition, it explained why the attacks that landed on Anubis had been delayed. When its face was pummeled into the ground, the sounds that accompanied the barrage were also delayed. The mages from the world beyond might be puzzled as to why the sounds and images did not match the strikes MO Fan had displayed. The Einherjar Spirits, however, were all powerful beings in their generations. Hence, they knew that if something like that happened, it meant that the power behind the strikes were enough to destroy worlds.

Anubis had been defeated.

The revered God of Death was not a god that needed any manipulation from Lilith. But it was defeated by MO Fan’s violent barrage, and the Einherjar Spirits could not accept it. They suddenly realized that MO Fan was not lying when he said that he could defeat all of the gods and amazing beings alone. He really was capable!

Lilith’s expression finally turned dark.

She did not expect Anubis to be defeated even after it received her divine motivation.

Many of the Magic Gods preferred to dance around in circles while they fought, so MO Fan’s preference for grand attacks made things awkwvard for them.

Were powerful beings not supposed to test the waters first, then engage in a contest of strength before unleashing their full power?

Yet, MO Fan went straight to unleashing his full power and deadly attack. Testing the waters and engaging in a contest of strength did not exist in his book.

They were all mages, so if he did this, fights would become meaningless!

Did he have limitless mana or something?

Did his Forbidden Magic not need a cooldown?

“Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Go back to your graves. I don’t have to send you back myself, do I?” MO Fan smiled and kindly advised the Einherjar Spirits to stop fighting.

“Hmph. They’re not the ones who get to decide when they stop fighting.” Lilith sneered coldly.

Clang! Clang!

Lilith turned, only to realize that at some point in time, more than ten Einherjar Spirits had broken free of her control and worked with the other working spirits.

All they needed to do was wipe down the statues and maintain the order of the new world, right? In the future, this place was going to be as lively as the Ten Halls of the Underworld. Plenty of powerful Einherjar Spirits were going to be sent down here to suffer the pain of reincarnation, and they could not let the King of Flame beat them up by himself all the time.

Screw Anubis. It did not seem to be as friendly as the nearby divine magistrate, anyway. Also, the Ten Halls was huge. They would need civil servants to keep the place running!

Therefore, they decided to join the workforce.

Penitence was true wisdom, and that was why they had joined the workforce so much sooner. The others were just idiots. They did not know the joys of joining the workforce! Working for someone else offered no social security, anywvay!

“You b*stards!” Lilith’s face turned red with rage when she saw the Einherjar Spirits who had broken free from her control.

They were all powerful beings of their generations, and they would rather sit on the fence?!

If they had the ability to not be controlled by her divine art, why did they listen to her commands earlier?

Were they behaving timidly in the Bright Blood King’s backyard because they were showing respect to the king?!

“I can tell that all of you are the temperate type. But it makes sense. While you were alive, you lived glorious lives. The fact that you’re still lingering here means that you still have some obsession or worry keeping you here, and you want to see the world a little more. I promise all of you that if you have any unfulfilled wishes, I’ll help you fulfill them in the land of the living, so long as it’s within my power. But please rest in the Azure Dragon Vessel. Please also use your powers to help me create a prosperous place and reach the heights of your power while I’m still alive!” MO Fan’s arrogance faded away, and he spoke sincerely. It was a show of his generosity as the owner of the place.

In truth, the Einherjar Spirits were not the most powerful beings of their generation. They were just parts of those powerful beings. Just as MO Fan mentioned, they were merely soul fragments that refused to leave the world, and they were prideful because they used to be incredibly powerful.

Nevertheless, they still needed a resting place.

Compared to the Bright Blood King’s backyard, this place was shabby. Still, it was a new place, and it had a new king. At the same time, this new king was an Evil Saint King, so he had an immortal soul.

Perhaps in the near future, they could become the divine magistrates of the underworld. That way, they could even influence certain things in the human world.

They had far too many regrets and obsessions in the human world that they could not move past from. Even if they had to carry on in such a lowly manner, they still wanted to see the world and do something for their descendants. And Mo Fan was going to fulfill their wishes to the best of his power.

His words truly touched the hearts of many.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Soon, more chains fell on the ground. To Lilith’s surprise, more Einherjar Spirits broke free from her control.

They had witnessed this new ruler’s strength and sensed his kindness. They were just soul fragments, but they were offered a place to rest. While they would not be the ruler of the place, they would still be allowed to be divine magistrates of the place once they moved past their obsessions.

“We’re willing to serve you!”

Twenty or so Einherjar Spirits had a clear understanding of the situation. The stick and carrot approach MO Fan used on them made them set aside their pride and serve in the Azure Dragon Vessel!

“You b*stards!” Lilith flew into a rage when she saw this, and the threads in her hands turned into blood-red whips. She cracked them against the air. “Have you forgotten that I’m your master?!”

They were part of the Bright Blood King’s collection.

Since she was the gardener of the backyard and the manager of the king’s throne, that made the Einherjar Spirits her personal belongings as well! How could she just hand them over to someone else?!

Lilith was still really powerful. She was strong enough to put the other twenty or so Einherjar Spirits under her control and make them her suicide fighters!

She was not going to give up until the very end. Besides, she was not going to stay in this place!

Upon seeing how stubborn Lilith was, MO Fan knew that if he did not defeat her, she would not change.

“MO Fan, fight her Einherjar Spirits. I’ll deal with her,” Asha’ruiya said. Most of her injuries had healed. After all, the constitution of a Fallen Angel was unique.

“Not a good idea. Her level is pretty high,” MO Fan said as he shook his head.

“Her strength comes from her Control Magic. Her fighting prowess isn’t that great. I think I can take her down.” Asha’ruiya could not let the creatures on the Dark Plane think that she was only there to look pretty. She had to take this chance to build her reputation.

MO Fan knew what Asha’ruiya was planning, so he nodded in the end.

While he did agree to let her fight Lilith, he still secretly ordered the Azure Dragon to protect Asha’ruiya if she was in danger. It was not to care whether the Bright Blood King would step in or not.

The Azure Dragon understood his order and focused its attention on Asha’ruiya.

Then, MO Fan stepped forward and faced the Einherjar Spirits who were still under Lilith’s control. Among them was a religious leader in yellow robes who caught most of MO Fan’s attention.

He exuded a cold and dark aura. Right from the start, he scrutinized everyone with malice and a mocking smile. MO Fan knew that he was different from the rest.

As such, MO Fan provoked him. But the religious leader remained unperturbed. He moved to the back of the crowd and pretended as if he was afraid of fighting.

Even so, MO Fan had dragon sense and could smell danger. The only person who could pose a great threat to him was the religious leader. He was definitely a Forbidden Mage who would not lose to the Magic Gods who were still alive!

“You haven’t used any Forbidden Curses, have you?” the religious leader finally spoke.

MO Fan was surrounded by more than twenty Einherjar Spirits. When the religious leader spoke to him, he was clearly just trying to throw his concentration off.

Despite that, MO Fan was MO Fan. Fighting while being distracted was the norm for him, and he was at ease as he fought the Einherjar Spirits. He could even answer the religious leader’s question.

“What’s the basis of your question?” MO Fan asked.

“Forbidden Curses use a lot of energy. If you had used a Forbidden Curse, your Fire Element would have been extinguished. Yet, you’re still using it. This means that you have a vast pool of magic power. It also means that you were using a Pseudo Forbidden Curse. Those are just Fire Element Curses that look strong. While you did use other methods to strengthen them, they are still not your real Forbidden Curses,” the religious leader said.

MO Fan was shocked.

This guy actually saw through the essence of his magic!

Indeed, MO Fan had not used a true Fire Element Forbidden Curse. Although he used a powerful attack when he fought, that was not because he had an endless pool of magic power. It was because he had been using magic that was a class below Forbidden Curses..
