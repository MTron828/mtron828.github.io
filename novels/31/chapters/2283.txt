They successfully reached the Furniture District west of the city.

The Furniture District had a river flowing through it. The foul-smelling canals had to be interconnected underground. The polluted water in them was slowly rising because of the storm.

A brigade had taken over the Furniture District. The central plaza in the district had been turned into the brigade’s camp. The streets, which held a lot of building material stores, were crowded with soldiers of the Brown Army.

The first wave of their attack had been a great success, taking over Banlo City with the surprise attack. The soldiers had set up camp in the Furniture District so they could take a rest.

.

They would launch an attack on the next city in seven hours.

By then, the Federation’s army would be prepared. It was most likely on its way already. A real battle would take place in seven hours! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Why are we taking this way?” Mu Bai asked with a confused look.

“The other districts are occupied by other regiments. I don’t have the authority to bring you through them. I can easily ask my superior to let us pass if we take this route,” the soldier replied.

He went across a bridge. The three had no choice but to follow him.

As they approached a tall building, Mo Fan noticed the building was full of Mages in brown military outfits. They were staring down at them, like archers who had long set up an ambush for their enemy!

“Set up the perimeter!” the soldier suddenly yelled before running to the building.

Mages of the Brown Army rushed out from the residential houses behind the bridge.

They formed a wall at one end of the bridge to stop Mo Fan and his crew from escaping.

There were movements on the tall buildings nearby, each channeling their magic. Their Star Orbits and Star Patterns lit up the streets like bright banners and street lamps.

Troops of Brown Mages poured out of the tallest building and surrounded Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai with the rest of the army, who was approaching from the streets!

“Damn it, it’s an ambush!” Zhao Manyan cursed.

Mo Fan was surprised too.

The Brown Army was treating them like the leaders of their enemy, yet they were not even involved in the war. Why did the Brown Army prepare such a huge trap for them?

The enemy had overwhelming numbers. The soldiers in their range of vision were not everyone. More soldiers of the Brown Army were gathering toward them.

“You set us up!” Zhao Manyan yelled at the soldier. “Luckily, the diamonds I gave you are fake, too!”

The soldier was startled. He quickly took out the diamonds and inspected them.

He could tell the diamonds were indeed fake after he checked them thoroughly. He snarled in frustration.

A skinny man patted the soldier on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, you have led three high-priority targets into our trap. You will be rewarded handsomely!”

Unlike the soldiers of the army, that man was wearing a luxurious tuxedo and a white shirt. His long hair was tidy and smooth. He was holding a silver baton, like the conductor of an orchestra!

“It’s you!” Zhao Manyan instantly recognized the man. The conductor clearly held an important role in the Brown Army if he could summon so many soldiers to trap them!

“I remembered you after you ruined my plan last time. Interestingly, someone also requested that we stop you from leaving Banlo City alive. Our army is about to take over the Andes Mountains, so I didn’t mind doing such a little favor,” the conductor named Cook grinned.

Another man wearing the Aorus Sacred Institute’s uniform came out of the building too. He had a dark grin on his young face.

“The Chief Extraditor wants you three dead. We have prepared a warm welcome for you, because we know how strong you are,” the Wolf Chief said.

The student of the Aorus Sacred Institute was none other than Sancha’s bodyguard. He had gone missing when Mo Fan and Zhu Meng were planning to take him out.

They thought the Wolf Chief had gone into hiding, yet he had been watching them all along. He had even listed them as the Brown Army’s high-priority targets.

“Kill them!” Cook ordered.

A group of Mages with black hats gathered as he waved his little baton. They opened their mouths and uttered deafening shouts together under Cook’s lead.

It?sounded?like a hot-blooded army song. However, Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai’s heads hurt whenever the choir sang a high note. It felt like hundreds of dwarfs were beating gongs and cymbals in their ears!

“I can’t use my Advanced Magic!” Zhao Manyan swore as he covered his ears.

“Me either! What should we do now?” Mu Bai grimaced in worry.

Mo Fan was affected by the choir’s Sound Magic, too.

They would not have difficulties handling the disturbance from one or two Sound Mages. However, the combined attack from a choir was torture for them. It was impressive they were able to remain conscious, let alone use their magic.

“Combination Magic: Wind Warships!” the commander of a different fleet of Wind Warships yelled.

The Wind Mages among the soldiers constructed Star Orbits and Star Patterns simultaneously. The white Star Orbits and Star Patterns gradually combined.

A fleet of magnificent Wind Warships floated above the plaza.

“Wind Gear Wheel!”

The white Wind Warships fired shredding gusts of wind continuously. They had the shapes of enormous white gear wheels.

The first Wind Gear Wheel was heading straight toward Mo Fan and his crew!

The petty defense Zhao Manyan could set up in his current state would not be enough to defend them from the Wind Gear Wheel.

The choir was singing loudly, hindering the three from using their Advanced and Super Magic.

“We have to take out that choir!” Mo Fan swore.

“It’s no use, they have around a thousand people. I can only fend them off temporarily with my magic Equipment, but it won’t last for long!” Zhao Manyan used his magic Equipment right away, taking out a magic Shield and putting on his magic Armor.

A fleet of Wind Warships had over two thousand Mages pouring their magic into the spell. The Wind Gear Wheel was the combined attack of over two thousand Mages. Even if most of them were only Basic and Intermediate Mages, it still posed a huge threat to a Super Mage!
