Chapter 2914: Extreme South Castle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I don’t know about the future, but at least I know you’re not dead yet. We’ve arrived at the destination,” said Mu Ningxue to Yan Lan.

“D-don’t lie to me,” Yan Lan said feebly.

One had to feed on illusions to persevere. If they had strong willpower, they could unleash their potential and keep trying.

If they decided to give up in the middle of hardship, especially in such a cold, freezing environment, they would sleep there for eternity.

However, not everyone could go through such hardships. Yan Lan felt as if her head had been pierced by ice blades, and strong wind gushed out from the holes. She felt so much pain that she felt as though she was going crazy.

Her teeth, face, and neck were numb, let alone her limbs. The bone-chilling coldness continued to spread throughout her body and torture her.

The environment was covered by snow. The snow gleamed in the sun and radiated a holiness about it. The view of the glaciers that had existed for ages was breathtaking. The environment was no different from a living hell. Even though she had only been there for a couple of days, she felt as if she had suffered for more than three years.

Whenever she closed her eyes and planned to give up, she felt a sense of despairing comfort. She thought she might as well sleep there. At the very least, the sooner she shuts her eyes, the less pain she would have to endure.

“Aren’t you curious about me?” Mu Ningxue realized that it was pointless to continue lying to her. She pondered for a while before finding something else to say.

“Curious about what?” Yan Lan showed a hint of curiosity. It was clear to see that she suffered tremendously.

“About how I am not affected by the cold,” said Mu Ningxue.

Yan Lan’s eyes lit up. She stared at Mu Ningxue. She remembered that Mu Ningxue had let her stay in the Clear Fire Formation in her place. Yan Lan then looked at Mu Ningxue closely.

Mu Ningxue did not look like she was struggling in the cold. Instead, Mu Ningxue had killed and collected Beast Blood for them.

“I doubted… but I wasn’t so sure about it. You aren’t affected by the cold, not even the slightest bit?” asked Yan Lan.

Seeing that she had successfully drawn Yan Lan’s attention, Mu Ningxue took the opportunity to help her walk forward at a faster pace. Mu Ningxue sped up. Wind tracks formed under her feet.

“Yes, I previously wasn’t aware of it either. But now, I realize that the extreme south cold doesn’t affect me,” Mu Ningxue said as she walked.

“Is it because you’re gifted? That’s very lucky for you,” Yan Lan said with envy.

Mu Ningxue shook her head. “An Ice Demon had been inside my body since I was twelve. It always appears at night and tortures me with its bone-chilling coldness. I never had a peaceful sleep.”

“Huh?!” Yan Lan was shocked.

“The cold tortures but strengthens me at the same time. When I joined the Imperial College, I found those so-called geniuses and hardworking Mages to be hilarious. Their hard work is less than a tenth of mine.” Mu Ningxue took Yan Lan’s hand into her and felt a trace of warmth in Yan Lan’s hand.

Yan Lan was touched upon hearing Mu Ningxue’s words. ‘From the age of twelve until now?’

Yan Lan and her group was so in despair to the point of wanting to commit suicide after staying only a couple of days in such a cold environment. ‘How did Mu Ningxue survive over the years?’

“When we fall into a very poor environment, out of our comfort zone, we often feel sad and desperate. However, the truth is, we’re wallowing in self-pity. Our adaptability is far more powerful than they are credited to be. Regardless of how poor the environment is, it can’t break us. The only thing that can break us is our lack of willpower,” said Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue vividly remembered her mother saying those words to her. When Mu Ningxue was a child, she lived her life like a princess. Many people pampered her. She led a wealthy and comfortable life. She had never experienced any hardships. All she had to think about was how to dress up to earn the crowd’s praise.

After she inherited the Ice Crystal Bow, everything had changed. Her life became a living hell. She became hopeless, much similar to how others felt when they stepped into the Extreme South Land.

Mu Ningxue was aware that the cold in the Extreme South Land could not kill them. Most people who had died here were the ones who had given up and let the cold take them.

“I-I cannot endure for so many years like you…,” said Yan Lan.

Mu Ningxue’s heart was heavy. She was afraid that Yan Lan would give up.

“But I can hold on for one more day,” Yan Lan blurted out.

Mu Ningxue let out a sigh of relief. She was not very eloquent in her words. If she were Mo Fan, she might have been able to rekindle Yan Lan’s hope in just a few words.

Luckily, Yan Lan did not give up. She did not close her eyes, just like the others. And that was more than enough.

If she did not give up on herself, she could hold on for another week.

When one survives their most vulnerable state, they could adapt to other hardships. They would no longer be as dejected as before. They would learn to survive!

Mu Ningxue looked back and noticed her team members were getting fewer.

Not everyone heeded her advice, and not all of them had strong willpower. Some of them chose to close their eyes and fall into eternal sleep on the flat glaciers.

After a while, they could not hear the sound of the wind blowing. Without the wind, they were not whipped by the cold.

A small castle made up of ice clay was in sight. There was a magic flag on top of the castle. The flag showed the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance’s logo.

“We’ve made it!” Mu Ningxue was the first to see it.

“Don’t lie to me anymore! I can still hold on. You don’t have to lie. Don’t worry…” Yan Lan forced a small smile. After that, she looked up to see the castle.

Her smile froze. She was thrilled and ecstatic. She burst out in tears.

They had finally arrived at their destination. They had crossed the horrible Extreme South Land and reached the South Pole Station!

The experts from the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance gathered inside the castle. They were in the middle of a discussion to devise an international plan to take on the Extreme South Emperor!

The group fastened their paces. At that moment, they pushed their potential to the maximum. Those tortured by the cold were “revived” and ran to the Extreme South Castle.

…

Several people came out of the castle and greeted the group. They asked for their identities before letting them climb on the back of the mounts and sending them into the Extreme South Castle.

There was a powerful magic barrier inside the Extreme South Castle which resisted the cold. Even though they still felt cold, it was much more subdued than the outside.

They had been deprived of food, warm water, and heat. After experiencing such hardships, the group had finally arrived at their destination!
