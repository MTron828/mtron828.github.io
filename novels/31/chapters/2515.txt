Mo Fan was utterly shocked.

The strange mist they had entered had only seemed to cover several dozen kilometers. They should only be fifty kilometers away from China’s coasts. How did they end up so close to Japan?

Was the strange mist imbued with Space and Chaos Magic? Did they travel a great distance into the sea, even though it only felt like several dozen kilometers?

Jiang Shaoxu and Lingling obviously would not lie to them. They would reach land by heading east, regardless of what country it was!

“Half of Xixiong City was drowned after the sea level rose. The residents were evacuated to somewhere higher in altitude, so you don’t have to worry about their safety!” Lingling assured them.

——

Mo Fan, Jiang Shaoxu, Mu Ningxue, and Zhao Manyan were all familiar with Xixiong City. It was the first city in Japan they had visited when they were traveling around the world to train themselves for the World College Tournament.

The sea was vast, but the group was traveling at an insane speed, and the chase went on for a long time. The Sea Skeleton King was obsessed with the Four-Eyed Bird, and it would not allow humans to take away the power that belonged to it!

The Sea Skeleton King’s injuries were obvious during the chase. It was using all its power, but it still struggled to catch up to Zhang Xiaohou. Zhang Xiaohou was very good at dodging attacks, too. He had evaded every attack launched by the Sea Skeleton King.

Even if it was impossible to dodge some of the attacks, the rest of the group would lend him a hand from behind to buy him time!

The group had no choice but to bite their lips and endure the prolonged chase, even though they were injured. They had to stop the Sea Skeleton King from reaching the Four-Eyed Bird at all costs!

“Brother Zhao, catch!”

Zhang Xiaohou noticed the Sea Skeleton King’s destructive wind had blocked his path. He decisively threw the Four-Eyed Bird at Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan’s expression changed as soon as he caught the hot potato. The Sea Skeleton King immediately turned after him!

“Are you seriously thinking this is a relay? Don’t give it to me!” Zhao Manyan threw the Four-Eyed Bird at Mu Bai without any hesitation.

“Are you f**king stupid?” Mu Bai swore at him.

The Sea Skeleton King suddenly raised its hand. The limb enlarged significantly while the Four-Eyed Bird was flying across the sky. The Ruler was trying to intercept it!

“Blink!”

Mo Fan instantly Cast a Space Spell. A Space Rift opened up at the Four-Eyed Bird’s position.

The Sea Skeleton King missed its grab. The Four-Eyed Bird ended up in Mo Fan’s arms.

The Four-Eyed Bird was just like a little bird, and did not have a clear mind. The sacred flames around it were the only thing that indicated it was special.

“Little cub, full speed ahead!”

The little cub was a free-willed beast, and was not going to obey every command from Mo Fan. However, he had no choice but to run at full speed when he saw the Sea Skeleton King lunging at him!

The tiger cub was racing across the surface of the sea. The water his feet touched turned into ice. The frost continued to spread like ripples, freezing the water behind him.

The little cub looked like a godly beast running across the sea from above. Frost was spreading across the sea behind him, like curtains being drawn.

The frozen water was perfect for hindering the Sea Skeleton King’s pursuit. It could no longer control the water freely, easing the pressure the group was under.

The little cub sprinted across the sea like a ray of white light. His endurance was shocking. Mo Fan even had time to throw several Sky Lightning Claws at the Sea Skeleton King while riding the little cub.

The Sky Lightning Claws could only inflict minor injuries on the Sea Skeleton King, but they were still effective, as the Sea Skeleton King could no longer heal itself!

“How much farther do we have to go?” Mo Fan looked ahead. He could still see nothing but waves.

There was no sign of land. Mo Fan’s head began to hurt. They could not afford to underestimate the Sea Skeleton King. They might die if they made a careless mistake. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Thirty kilometers left. We should see it pretty soon!”

Zhang Xiaohou was keeping the Sea Skeleton King busy from the side, preventing it from moving closer to the little cub.

The Sea Skeleton King was still very powerful. It swung its arm at Zhang Xiaohou and knocked him several kilometers away!

Zhang Xiaohou fell into the sea with a huge splash.

His magic Armor was broken, and he could no longer raise his arms. Even the slightest movement was causing him great pain.

“Houzi, are you still alive?” Mo Fan asked through the communication device.

“I...I’m alive, but my arms are broken. Keep going, don’t worry about me,” Zhang Xiaohou answered through clenched teeth.

The Sea Skeleton King made its move again, this time targeting Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, and Mu Ningxue. It realized it would never catch up to Mo Fan and the little cub before getting rid of the annoying flies around it.

Mu Bai was the next to sustain serious injuries. His defensive capabilities were not particularly outstanding.

Zhao Manyan was the toughest to beat. He managed to withstand several heavy blows from the Sea Skeleton King.

However, the Sea Skeleton King was extremely cunning. It focused on taking down the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon when it realized it would take a longer time to take out Zhao Manyan directly.

Even though the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon was at the Ruler Level, its strength was on a different level when compared to the Sea Skeleton King.

The Sea Skeleton King broke the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon’s wings and smashed it deep into the sea.

Zhao Manyan could no longer match the Sea Skeleton King’s speed without the Wind Gauze Inferior Dragon.

The Sea Skeleton King Summoned a curtain of waves to block Zhao Manyan and Mu Ningxue. It then went after Mo Fan and the little cub at full speed.

“Keep going, I’m afraid I can’t go any further,” Zhao Manyan told Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue had eight Wind Wings on her back. She had no choice but to increase her altitude to fly over the waves.

However, she soon realized the curtain of waves had a special power. The higher she flew, the taller the curtain of waves felt to her, like she could never reach the top.

Mu Ningxue was puzzled.

When she looked down, she realized she was still very close to the surface, even though she had ascended over a thousand meters!

It felt like the curtain of waves was constantly growing taller, making it impossible to fly over it.

Left with no choice, Mu Ningxue could only break through the waves by force.

She could not let Mo Fan take on the Sea Skeleton King alone. He would have trouble facing a Water Element creature by himself!
