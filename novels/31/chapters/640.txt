Everrich Tea House was located on the main road leading to the clock tower. The road was now crowded with people seeking safety, packed so tightly that it was hard to weave through on foot.

The first and second floors of the Tea House were full of people too, indicating that the owner was a sensible man. However, the third floor was not opened to the public.

The third floor was a little attic. One could see the Clock Tower Magic Association through the window.

The loud chime of the bell was sounding. Each chime would emit golden motes into the sky through the main pillar of light, transferring energy to the barrier protecting the city.

The sacred golden glow was being emitted continuously. Perhaps the protection from the ancient bell was the only reason why the people still had a slight glimpse of hope in their hearts. Once the chimes stopped and the golden energy could no longer maintain the barrier, it would all come to an end.

“Humph, that thing is going to turn into a mere decoration in the end!” the owner of the tea house glanced at the clock tower coldly.

As soon as he finished the sentence, a worker hurried his way up to the attic.

“Boss, Mu Bai is downstairs. It seems like he’s here looking for shelter. They were just too many people outside, it’s cold and starving,” said the worker.

“Oh, oh, it’s him. Let him come up. The kid is lucky enough to still be alive. Otherwise, I won’t even know how to report back to Mu He,” said the owner Xue Zang.

The worker soon led Mu Bai to the attic. It was not spacious, but it was well-decorated, slightly resembling the style during the ancient Qin Dynasty. Guests could sit on the tatami while enjoying the tea and the sight of the vehicles and crowd coming in and out from the clock tower. Currently, the whole street was simply stacked with people.

“Uncle Xue, you’ve taken in so many people, and even gave them food. You’re such a kind man,” Mu Bai walked in with a smile, no stranger to the man.

“You little imp, I told you not to go outside the outer walls. Look at you, your uncle Mu He and I even thought you were dead out there. It’s good to see you alive and well,” Xue Zang patted Mu Bai’s shoulder.

“Where’s my uncle, is he alright?” blurted out Mu Bai.

“Why are you still calling him uncle, you shouldn’t blame him either. When Mu Zhuoyun was still the person in charge of the family, if he knew you were actually your uncle’s bastard, he would surely have made a huge fuss about it. In the end, your ‘uncle’ could only tell him that you and your mum are his distant cousins,” said Xue Zang sincerely.

“I...I had gotten used to it,” Mu Bai looked lost in his thoughts, yet he did not dare to show it.

“I have no idea where he is now, but he should be safe somewhere, don’t worry. Oh, by the way, I heard from the people who came here looking for a shelter that you and your friends were taken away by the Imperial Magicians. Is everything alright?” said Xue Zang.

Mu Bai’s heart tightened.

He did not expect Xue Zang to be so well-informed. He was now in big trouble. If both Xue Zang and Mu He were from the Black Vatican, they were most likely suspicious of him!

“It has nothing to do with me. The Imperial Magicians simply took the guy called Fang Gu away, they mentioned something about the Water of Kun, but it turned out that the guy has already used it to refine his skeleton,” Mu Bai remained collected and replied calmly.

The truth was, his heart was already beating rapidly.

“I don’t really understand, but nothing else matters as long as you’re fine. Oh, what about your friends? You can call them over too. It’s important to look after one another in a big disaster like this.” Xue Zang’s eyes flickered, but then his expression returned, if he was totally clueless about the situation.

“Oh, they are heading to the museum. They said something about the Underground Holy Spring being related to the Water of Kun, so they are going to verify it,” said Mu Bai.

“Underground Holy Spring... isn’t that the thing from Bo City? Are you saying that your classmate Mo Fan still has it?” Xue Zang squinted his eyes.

“Who knows, but Mo Fan was quite excited when someone mentioned that the villages on the outskirts were related to Bo City. In the end, they decided to visit the museum. I was too lazy to follow them around, so I came here to rest,” Mu Bai said disdainfully.

“Oh? So the Imperial Magician followed them to the museum?” asked Xue Zang.

“I don’t think so, they only came up with the plan after we left the Imperial Magicians... I don’t even know what that the Underground Holy Spring is used for, maybe I’ll ask my uncle when he comes back,” said Mu Bai.

“Mm, mm, oh, Mu Bai, you should rest here. I’ll go and attend to some matters first,” said Xue Zang.

“Alright,” Mu Bai nodded.

When he saw Xue Zang leave the room, he felt like his heart was about to jump out from his chest.

A while later, after his emotions calmed down, his face had a painful expression as his eyes turned bloodshot.

He was currently having mixed feelings, which almost made him feel like he was going to have a mental breakdown at any second.

He really wished that it had all been mere speculation, hoping that Mo Fan and the others would not be able to meet the person they were waiting for. It would simply mean that Mu He was not the Great Deacon Hu Jin of the Black Vatican, and Zhang Xiaohou had made a mistake.

But, if Mu He wasn’t Great Deacon Hu Jin... all the hopes they had would pop like bubbles!

They would proceed with the plan and execute Salan along with the authority figures. No one could possibly face the eight Ruler-level undead that were threatening the safety of the barrier. The millions of people in the city would simply be waiting for their deaths, waiting to be devoured by the tide of death... including himself, his mother, his classmates, his friends.

Either way, it would leave his heart with holes.

Despite that, he still made his choice. At least he could still distinguish the bad from the good!

Somewhere in the corner of an alleyway, two figures were wearing dark ocean blue snow coats with a piece of cloth on their faces. It was obvious that they did not want anyone else to see their faces.

“Are you sure that the Imperial Magicians are not following them?” asked Great Deacon Hu Jin.

“Do you really think the Imperial Magicians are free to escort them when the whole city has turned into an isolated island surrounded by the ocean of undead? Some of the Imperial Magicians even went missing, let alone the authorities that are watching us. I’m sure that the kids have gone to the museum on their own.

“However, if they found out that the Underground Holy Spring is actually the Water of Kun, with the efficacy of the Underground Holy Spring, it would most likely make the rain ineffective for a day or even longer! If the army of undead withdraws for a day, they would have time to evacuate half of the people in this city. If that happens, our plan is basically...” trailed off Xue Zang.

Great Deacon Hu Jin frowned. They had already made a mistake after they failed to take down Fang Gu. However, they were in luck, as Fang Gu had used the Water of Kun to refine his undead. To their surprise, Mo Fan somehow found out the secret of the Underground Holy Spring!

“If that idiot Yu Ang hadn’t messed up twice in a row, we wouldn’t be having these problems!” cursed Great Deacon Hu Jin.

Back in Bo City, as one of the chief plotters, he did not involve himself in the execution of the plan, as it would simply expose himself. However, his underlings were even more useless than he could have imagined. Not only did they fail to take down Bo City, they even lost a Blue Deacon in the Magic City!

This Mo Fan was truly the Black Vatican’s natural enemy!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
