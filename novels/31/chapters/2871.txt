Chapter 2872: Battle in Hongkou District

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Attack! The two emperor-level creatures are dying!” Zhao Manyan shouted excitedly.

He had never expected that he would be chasing and defeating an emperor-level creature ever in his life. Zhao Manyan was thrilled. He was not as crazy during the battle in Andeas.

After all, he grew up in the Magic City and was fond of this place. Also, the Zhao family had many businesses in the city.

Zhao Manyan would kill anyone that destroyed his family’s business, even an emperor-level creature would be no match!

Everyone was willing to obey the person who could order the Black Totem Turtle. Even the Fire God of the Forbidden Curse Association talked to Zhao Manyan with respect.

“There are too many Salamanders across the river. If we attack rashly, we might fall into a trap. Please order Black Totem Turtle to open a way for us,” said the Fire God.

The Black Totem Turtle was indeed ferocious. It could even deal with the invincible emperor-level creature alone.

The Black Totem Turtle was also a marine creature. Its roar could make any Ocean Demon’s demonic spells ineffective. If the Black Totem Turtle could take the lead, other people would be at ease.

“Attack! It’s no longer a defensive battle! We want revenge on the Pacific Ocean!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

Although it was a bit of an exaggeration, they were in need of such inspiring words in the battle. Zhao Manyan took out the Wooden Fish Containers and Water Buddha Beads.

His cultivation was not as high as those of Superordinate Mages and apex-grade Mages. However, the Wooden Fish Container was associated with the Black Totem Turtle. After the Black Totem Turtle received the radiance of the Sacred Totem Beast, the Wooden Fish Container stimulated to infinite potential. Every magic was four times sturdier and as powerful. When combined with the Blessing of the God’s Seal, a Super-Level defensive barrier could be eight times thicker than the barrier of a normal Super-Level Mage.

The Water Buddha Beads were powerful water equipment. Wu Ku was sinful, but the Water Buddha Beads left behind seemed to have inherited most of his abilities as a Water Element victim. Because of this, Zhao Manyan’s control over Water Element was almost the same as Semi-Water Element Forbidden Mages.

Water Element had absolute suppression over Ocean Demons. Zhao Manyan could not deal with emperor-level Lan Dragon Demon and Demonic Ruins White Spider Emperor, but he was a great threat to the Deep-Sea Dragon Empire.

…

“Hey, don’t be too aggressive. Follow everyone’s momentum for the attack,” said a soft voice.

The irritable Black Totem Snake broke free from the Lizard Demon Dragon Troop after it heard the voice.

A woman wearing a light red uniform of the Enforcement Union jumped onto the crown of the Black Totem Snake. She patted its head affectionately.

“Ms. Tang Yue, you came at the right time. Let’s cross the river with the Black Totem Snake. We can’t let the Lan Dragon Demon and Demonic Ruins White Spider Emperor recover and flee.” Zhao Manyan’s eyes lit up when he saw Tang Yue.

Tang Yue was the Head of the Magic Court of Nanxi Mountain. She had just arrived at the scene.

The other Judges and Deputy Judges also landed on the head of the Black Totem Snake. They stood in an orderly line.

Two Totem Guardians appeared one after another. If they were here, the Super-Level Union could communicate and cooperate with the two Sacred Totem Beasts perfectly. This was crucial for Mages, who lacked frontal resistance!

There were not many Summoning Element Mages in the Magic City, so many Ocean Demons disrupted the formation of the Mages. After they made a sturdy formation, the destructive power and lethality caused by it would be even more powerful than that of the demons.

The body of the Black Totem Turtle was the most reliable. When it stood in front of them, it was like a natural barrier. Its shell acted as a protective wall, and it gave the Super-Level Mages time to cast magic spells however they wanted.

Unlike the Black Totem Turtle, the Black Totem Snake was a pair of sharp fangs. It could tear apart, attack, bite, and poison the enemy.

Its defensive power was far inferior to the Black Totem Turtle, but its aggressiveness was far superior. Its arrival threatened the lives of the Demonic Ruins White Spider Emperor and Lan Dragon Demon.

The existence of the two Sacred Totem Beasts stabilized the battle in Hongkou District. Hongkou District could win if they killed the two emperor-level creatures!

…

More than half of the pattern had lit up.

The Dragon Wall was formed again, and the Ocean Demons below ruler-level could not jump over the tail of the Azure Dragon no matter how numerous they were. Even if a ruler-level creature broke into the Dragon Wall, its demonic spells would be restricted by the Azure Dragon, and its strength would reduce radically.

“Mo Fan, you have to be extra careful since the Black Totem Snake is not here,” Eagle-winged Shaoli said to Mo Fan.

“Don’t worry. I’m not weak. The Green East Sea God is blocking the Giant Shark Beasts in the sky. If they attack, the formation formed by me and Dean Xiao will be destroyed, so you should go and help the Green East Sea God,” Mo Fan said to Eagle-winged Shaoli.

Shaoli looked up. There were many big creatures eyeing them in the sky. They were all Chief Sharks and Giant Shark Beasts. There were about twenty of them.

At first, there were more than fifty of them, and each of them had reached the ruler-level of the Shark Horde in Lan Yang City. The Green East Sea God had killed thirty of them, but it had no time to kill the remaining twenty.

They were here to destroy the Medium Formation.

Their strategy was easy. They would use their bodies to smash the People’s Park into a hole. Then, the Medium Formation would not have any support on the earth so it could not absorb the elements of this world.

“All right. Take care,” said Eagle-winged Shaoli.

Mo Fan’s body was full of fire, and he stared at an Evil Tyrant Crocodile that had been annoying him.

…

The Moon Moth Phoenix flew. Its figure was almost invisible in the dark under the clouds.

Unlike other Sacred Totem Beasts, the Moon Moth Phoenix did not join the battle. Lingling and Leng Qing both laid on its back and as it flew toward the Pudong ocean area.

After flying for about ten kilometers, they saw many Ocean Demons moving toward the Magic City. Some even swam in the ocean. Even if they could not see their faces, they could guess that the creatures were tyrant-level demons.

The Moon Moth Phoenix hid. Even if it were exposed, it would be fine since it could use the charm of the Moon Moth. If it didn’t attack the Ocean demons, they would pass by it without attacking back.

“Grandpa!”

“Are you sure he is down there? I can only see the corpses of Salamanders,” Qing Leng asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

There were piles of corpses of Salamanders. They wondered what kind of a person had delayed the arrival of the White Disastrous Clouds.

“He is down there,” Lingling said with conviction.

“Wait. Let those tyrants pass by first,” Qing Leng said calmly.
