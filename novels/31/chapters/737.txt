After the team returned to the ship, Nan Rongni quickly cast Healing Spells on Zu Jiming when she saw him in serious condition.

Mo Fan realized something when he saw Nan Rongni adeptly casting the Healing Spells.

He had been wondering why the team did not have a Healer. It turned out that Nan Rongni was the Healer for the team. He should definitely befriend her. Well, since she’s already Mu Ningxue’s close friend, it’s very likely that she will be a close friend with him, too!

Zhao Manyan’s eyes glittered. He nudged Mo Fan and whispered, “Have you discovered something? Most girls with the Healing Element have huge cup sizes!”

“It can’t be?” Mo Fan glanced at Nan Rongni, and indeed discovered a shocking mountain range under her woolen jumper. He was too caught up with Mu Ningxue’s slim waist and attractive derriere that he simply ignored the stunning bust of the girl beside her.

Damn it, he was a total failure as a ladykiller. He was ashamed that he had failed to recognize the girl’s beauty.

On second thought, Bai Tingting’s bust was stunning too, and completely overwhelmed the rest of the girls at the same age back in the days.

As for Xinxia... mmm, mmm, Zhao Manyan was right!

Zu Jiming quickly recovered from his injuries. The team was rather tired after the fight. Those who were still combat-ready kept an eye on the ocean to prevent the Scarlet Rending Demon from ambushing them. The others rested inside the cabin, preparing themselves for the upcoming hunt!

“It doesn’t look like it’s following us,” said Li Kaifeng, staring at the water behind the ship. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The movement of the ship produced countless v-shaped ripples in its wake. Apart from the slightly stronger waves, he had not discovered any extra movement.

“The creature is injured, so it’s unlikely that it will be following us. The problem is, how can we guarantee that it’s going to come after us?” wondered Ai Jiangtu.

Demon Torture was no ordinary spell. Even a Commander-level creature would need to rest for some time to recover from its effects. However, Ai Jiangtu was more concerned about luring the Scarlet Rending Demon ashore. If the creature did not come to seek revenge, it would remain a great threat to Feiniao City.

“I did implant more hatred into its heart, but it doesn’t guarantee that it will come after us,” agreed Jiang Shaoxu.

“We’ll discuss it after we’re back in Feiniao City. If it doesn’t come for us, we’ll hunt it down. There must be a way to kill it, unless it doesn’t show up again. We’ve almost wiped out its entire pack of Scarlet Soaring Demons. The Commander-level creature would not dare to infiltrate the city, since it’s now a general without an army,” conjectured Nanyu.

“Mmm, guess we have no other choice...”

——

As they returned to Feiniao City, Lin Junxian received the team warmly after learning that they managed to wipe out the Scarlet Soaring Demons.

Ai Jiangtu explained the situation to Lin Junxian and asked him to lend them a hand in setting up a trap for the Scarlet Rending Demon.

“Did you just say you’ve stumbled into a Commander-level creature... and, and you still managed to wipe out the pack of Scarlet Soaring Demons?” Lin Junxian asked in disbelief.

To Lin Junxian, it was a huge relief knowing that someone was willing to annihilate the sea monsters. Even killing one or two was enough to vent his anger, as he never thought the group of young Magicians would actually manage to annihilate the entire pack!

Weren’t these young Magicians a bit too strong to be true? It had only been a day...

Lin Junxian was no ordinary person, either. He looked at the Magicians carefully and realized something. He pointed them and said, “Could it be that you’re the fresh batch of representatives of the national team?”

Judging from their age, strength, student-like temperament, and the rumors that the representatives of the national team had just been decided recently, Lin Junxian immediately linked the group with the training that the national team had to participate in, even though the names and whereabouts of the national team were kept a secret!

That must be it; it totally explained things. Only the representatives of the national team were capable of wiping out a pack of sea monsters that a troop of Magicians would have trouble coping with, and doing so within a single day!

” (cough cough) ...I suggest you stop guessing our identities. Either way, can you give us a spacious area, it would be best if it’s along the shore, with enough space to construct a magic barrier. We’ll eliminate the threat for you, you just need to keep your promise!” said Ai Jiangtu.

The advisors had prohibited them from revealing their identities. However, there was nothing they could do if someone had guessed who they were.

As a matter of fact, it was pretty easy to realize who they were. The average age of their group was around twenty-two. Normally, Magicians at their age were mostly inexperienced students, yet they had displayed strength and efficiency comparable to a bunch of Hunter Masters. Wasn’t that enough to imply that they are the best students from their respective institutes?

“Oh, oh, I understand, don’t worry, I’ll do whatever I can to help you!” Lin Junxian was overjoyed.

The national team happened to come here for training when he was just about to withdraw his investment from this hopeless Feiniao City. They were like heavenly soldiers coming to the mundane world, saving the city from its miseries!

Lin Junxian could not find any words to describe his feelings. Once the sea monsters were disposed of, his investments would slowly turn into profits!

Feiniao City was indeed the best harbor anyone could wish for. When the time came, many people would beg him to become business partners with them and rent his land. In addition to that, he could finally sell the condominiums he built, MWAHAHAHA!

Lin Junxian felt like he had died and been returned to life after learning these kids’ identities.

Even though the investment had failed, he still had some money on hand. When he learned that the young Magicians were planning to kill the Commander-level creature, he immediately contacted Li Jingming, the unreliable vice mayor of the city, and asked him to set up the perimeters and assist the Magicians!

The vice mayor was doubtful when he received the news. However, he was dumbfounded when he saw more than a hundred gall bladders of the sea monsters at the place!

The vice mayor immediately went to the islands with a group of Battlemages. When he confirmed that the Scarlet Soaring Demons’ nest was indeed located there, he was lost in thought.

-Holy crap, are these young Magicians really humans? How did they destroy the sea monster’s nest when they only had a dozen people?-

On top of that, there was another reason why the vice mayor went to the islands. He had set up some bait to further provoke the Scarlet Rending Demon, which was hiding somewhere and licking its wounds, to ensure that the creature would come and seek its revenge!

—

The Magicians left all the work in the hands of the vice mayor. He was extremely diligent after learning that the sea monsters were wiped out. He personally made the preparations, set up the traps and the perimeter...

While Mo Fan and the rest of the team were resting at the hotel, Jiang Yu and Mu Tingying, who were investigating the truth in Feiniao City finally returned with some bad news.

“Are you saying that someone in the government is conniving with the sea monsters?” Ai Jiangtu rose to his feet with a murderous aura!

“It’s only my speculation, but it’s true that they have purposely hidden the news about some missing and dead children!” declared Jiang Yu.
