Chapter 2698: It Is Hard to Die

The cold air covered the sea, and a ship was escaping from the port of Fan Xuexin City at a hurtling speed.

The order of Fan Xuexin City was also affected by the battle of Fanxue Mountain. The streets were congested with vehicles, and many people ran to open areas to avoid vibrations from being transferred to the buildings.

Ocean Demons were a huge threat as well. But people usually got used to calamities fast enough. Many sat on the ground chatting with each other, waiting for the tremors to abate.

“The Nanrong Family has escaped. That’s their ship,” someone shouted with excitement, pointing at the port.

“When they came here, they were so domineering. They even docked at the special berth in Fanxue Mountain as if that was their territory. Now, they flee in fear!”

“The Nanrong Family used to be a small royal family in the south. Every member of the family was approachable, and respected. It’s a pity the Nanrong family has turned to this!” An old man sighed.

“Fanxue Mountain leaders are amazing, though! They even killed the City Lord, Lin Kang!”

“Lin Kang deserved what he got!”

...

The ship was driven by a magic machine. There were countless water arrows shot from under the ship. Dozens of water patterns cut the sea apart and spread into a larger size. The ship was indeed special. It could be compared to galloping warships. The Nanrong family dealt with the ocean. So, all the combat ships in the south were from their factories. They were also considered the most famous shipowners in the south.

Nanrong Ni stood on the deck. Her hair loose, and one of her hands covering her ear. Her right ear, neck and shoulder was covered in blood. Mu Ningxue’s arrows had been fast and brutal. It had hit her though her right ear.

Mu Ningxue had shot it at her forehead siming for the spot between her eyebrows. Nanrong Ni was not someone who had cultivated for nothing. She managed to get out of the powerful lock to dodge it, but had lost an ear.

Nan Rong Ni was a healing mage. Usually, this kind of injury was easy to heal. Even the pain would not last long. Her ear could be made whole again but no amount of healing spells would help with the ice wounds. Her face was grave. She glared in the direction of the Fanxue Mountain like a ghost.

At the port, countless people cheered. She heard those people mocking her and her family.

If it were not for this ship, all the members of the Nanrong family might have died. She barely escaped herself. Although she survived, she felt worse than ever. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Mu Ningxue should have been left with nothing. No talent, no respect, not even her extraordinary cultivation. She should have died alone with no people by her side. Instead, she had everything in addition to a fertile city to lead.

Her reputation preceded her even in the south. Almost every cultivator knew Mu Ningxue as one of the strongest female mages.

Nanrong Ni felt an overwhelming sense of shame. She wanted to tear herself apart. “Useless! Everyone is worthless! No matter who it is, nobody is reliable in the end. I will have to deal with her myself!” Nanrong Ni, usually calm and gentle, appeared fierce and cold at that moment.

...

In the rubbles of Fanxue Mountain, a man lay dying. Half his body was paralyzed and blood was splattered all over his face. He was no longer recognizable.

A pair of long, delicate, noble boots appeared in sight. Its owner stood regally on the rubbles. The gentle wind coiled around her slender waist. She appeared beautiful. But that beauty should never be mistaken for gentleness. Her beauty hid murderous intent which should never be triggered.

The person who couldn’t move half his body was Nanrong Xu. He stared at Mu Ningxue with pain and hatred in his eyes.

However, his hatred was not entirely directed at her. He knew the outcome of the battle. He had helped Nanrong Ni escape from Mu Ningxue’s killing shot, but Nanrong Ni had turned tail and fled on the ship leaving him behind.

People were so complicated. If Nanrong Xu turned into a ghost, he wanted to kill his sister first and foremost. Even as he lay dying, he could not believe that his sister had betrayed him.

Mu Ningxue did not say a word. She stared at the miserable Nanrong Xu, but there was no sympathy in her eyes. Mu Ningxue sympathized with her former self instead. She used to treat someone well even when she knew they would betray her. She would treat the people she cared about so harshly.

“Just… kill me.” Nanrong Xu did not beg for his life. He knew it was worthless to live without the lower part of his body functioning anyway.

Mu Ningxue did not have anything against Nanrong Xu. It was just a matter of which side they stood on. She raised her hand and an ice pick appeared. She pushed it towards Nanrong Xu’s heart.

“Wait!” said Xinxia.

Mu Ningxue turned around and saw Xinxia on her Bright Unicorn. Xinxia stopped next to Nanrong Xu and cast a healing spell on him. She then walked towards Mu Ningxue.

Xinxia still had difficulty walking. She was struggling to walk because she was so tired. She sweated like she had undergone some intense exercise. Mu Ningxue supported her.

Xinxia glanced at Nanrong Xu. “Nanrong Ni has been pretending to be sweet and kind in front of others. I know you don’t care about your reputation but Nanrong Ni has been spreading malice to damage your reputation,” she whispered to Mu Ningxue. “I need to save him so that Nanrong Ni’s true character can be revealed.”

Mu Ningxue nodded. “I will do as you say.”

A few people from the periphery of Fanxue Mountain arrived. They weren’t those who fought the battle but were the first to run around to declare their victory.

Mu Ningxue did not care about them. She already knew the real fighters of Fanxue Mountain. They wanted to please her by helping to clean the battlefield, so she just let them be.

Mu Ningxue beckoned to a few of them and instructed them to carry Nanrong Xu. He would not die if the candidates of the Goddess of Parthenon Temple were present.
