Chapter 2752: I Will Punish You Instead of God’s Condemnation

The cultivation of the man in bird-like clothes was much higher than other grandpas and grannies. Mo Fan wondered why he was only appearing now.

Grandpa Queyi walked over and checked Eldest Granny’s injuries. After confirming that it wasn’t fatal, he walked forwards.

The mountain villa was a mess. The fight had broken the lychee trees planted in front of the courtyard. Lychees were all over the ground, and the people had squashed some of them.

Grandpa Queyi did not step on these fruits. He picked up one of the plump ones and gently peeled off its skin.

“Look at this lychee. It has ugly skin. Its skin is not as smooth as an apple or as bright as a pear. But when you peel it off, it’s sweeter and juicier than any other fruit.” Grandpa Queyi did not show any hostility.

He put the lychee in his mouth, tasted it slowly, and chewed it while savoring the taste.

“I’ll let you have as many as you want.” Mo Fan’s expression changed suddenly. His pupils suddenly became deep and vast, like an endless night sky with countless stars.

The lychees all over the ground shook and flew up under the control of Mo Fan’s mind. The skin peeled off by itself, revealing the delicious white lychee flesh. When Mo Fan waved his hand, all the white lychees flew toward Grandpa Queyi like bullets.

Grandpa Queyi frowned. Mo Fan attacked.

The white lychees had soft fleshed but hard seeds. If they were propelled at an impossible speed, it could shoot through a mountain.

They had built the mountain villa on a cliff. The mountain villa barely looked as clean and regal as it had when he arrived. When Mo Fan let the lychees fly, the cliff and villa collapsed.

Grandpa Queyi looked angry. He had spent years taking care of the mountain villa and the lychee trees.

“You wanted to compare Licheng Afterglow Island to lychees. Oh please! These lychees are honest, they hide nothing. In my opinion, you people are like fruit flies that pesticides cannot kill. When you climb into the flesh of lychees, you feel that you have become superior. The entire Licheng Afterglow Island is a dirty, disgusting, and greedy parasite. You didn’t encounter God’s condemnation for your actions, but I’ll punish you instead!” Mo Fan sneered at Grandpa Queyi.

......

“Little Flame Belle, set fire to the mountain villa.”

Little Flame Belle loved setting fire to things. She was delighted at the prospect. She flew into the sky and came to a stop at the highest place. Suddenly, a fire gauze covered the entirety of the Licheng Afterglow Island.

“Little Flame Belle,” called Mo Fan. “We don’t have to involve the innocent people of the island yet.”

The Goddess of Flame Belle reduced her Heaven Fire and gradually narrowed the scope to the mountain villa and the mountains around them.

“Ring!”

With a long groan, the Heavenly Tribulation Flame rolled down from the clouds and fell onto the mountain villa.

Grandpa Queyi and the people of Licheng Afterglow Island were furious. They wanted to kill Mo Fan.

“We’ll never forgive you!” said Grandpa Queyi angrily.

On the mountains were many stone statues of ancestors worshiped by Licheng Afterglow Island’s hidden clan. They regarded these statues as godly. It was a great sin if even dust fell on them. However, Mo Fan burned all of them. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ruan Feiyan felt dizzy, and she almost fainted again.

‘I’ll take away the Underground Holy Spring, defeat the grandpas and grannies, destroy your ancestors’ statues, and drown the Licheng Afterglow Island.’ Ruan Feiyan recalled Mo Fan’s words.

He had already completed three of those things. ‘Will he really drown all of the Licheng Afterglow Island? Oh my god! Why did it turn out like this? Why had they not abided by their agreement? It’s all my fault,’ thought Ruan Feiyan.

…

Grandpa Queyi wanted to extinguish the fire, but Mo Fan had attacked him again.Something must be preventing the Green East Sea God from appearing. Mo Fan was too lazy to bother about anything else. He decided to defeat Grandpa Queyi first.

“Hurry up and stop the fire. We must protect the statues!” Grandpa Queyi shouted.

Grandpa Queyi had been driven crazy by Mo Fan, and he did not have the calm and elegant look he had when he arrived. He wished to strangle Mo Fan to death.

“Eldest Grandpa, if he doesn’t have the summoned beast, his other magic may not be that strong. We’ll keep the Flame Holy Spirit busy. You can deal with him,” Seventh Granny said with hatred.

“What are his two other elements?” Grandpa Queyi asked.

“It’s Lightning Element and Shadow Element,” Shu Xiaohua said hurriedly.

“He used Lightning Element when he came up the mountain, and his ability is stronger than Du Wanjun. Eldest Grandpa, you must be careful,” Du Mei warned.

“His Shadow Element is a little strange,” said Grandpa Ye.

Grandpa Queyi nodded. Although other people could not defend themselves from the powerful creature summoned by this outsider, at least they forced him to show his other abilities.

“I’ll cut your corpse into pieces and use them as fertilizer for the new lychee trees in the coming year,” Grandpa Queyi said furiously.

He raised his hands, and the chaotic ground suddenly had many big cracks. Some powerful clay monsters moved beneath the ground.The rocks broke and the soil was displaced.

The thick and long arms waved under the soil. The ground where Mo Fan stood collapsed, and he fell to the foothills.

There was a landslide on the mountain, and a big, long root that looked like an earth dragon and giant earthworm slashed the mountain fiercely. Mo Fan jumped from the landslide to another mountain to find his footing.

When he looked down, giant greenish-black vines were coiling up like a thousand-year-old python at the bottom of the peak. The forked part of its end was sharp and lashed like a devil’s fork.

Mo Fan hurriedly jumped onto the rock wall of the mountain. But the mountain suddenly cracked. A giant long tail cut through the mountain like an electric drill. Mo Fan used the rocks as a wave and ran along like a surfer. The terrifying long tail that could cut through the mountain was chasing behind him.

He did not know what kind of magic this was, but it made Mo Fan feel that places with mountains and soil were dangerous.
