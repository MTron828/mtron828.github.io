“Who is he?” Zhao Liwan asked, confused.

“He’s Mo Fan, the jerk with ill-luck!” Zu Kuangli snapped.

“He’s Mo Fan?” Zhao Liwan was surprised too.

The three of them had not gone to the peak of Mount Tyrant, they were stationed further away to stand guard. After all, only the people of the Magic Associations with a certain status were allowed on the peak. They were not worthy enough to show their faces in front of Su Lu!

“I wanted to teach him a lesson last time, but I never had the chance!” Zu Kuangli rubbed his hands in expectation.

“Not now, we have something important to do first,” Zhao Liwan advised against it.

Zhao Liwan did not let Zu Kuangli fight Mo Fan. He put on a smile and said politely, “Sorry for disturbing you. I am Zhao Liwan. We were chasing after a criminal, but lost sight of him here. Please let us know if you happened to see him around here. We are grateful for your help.”

“I have only seen your ugly faces around here. Piss off if you don’t want to fight, so you don’t corrupt the scenery and the fresh air here,” Mo Fan retorted promptly.

“Who are you asking to piss off? Who do you think you are? How dare a little imp like you yell at us!?” Mo Fan’s arrogant behavior was driving Zu Kuangli mad.

“Don’t, not now, Zu Kuangli! We can’t afford to waste our time arguing with him,” Zhao Liwan blurted out.

The man that had escaped was very important to Su Lu. They could hear Su Lu’s furious roar from the peak even when they were so far away from the mountain. The man must have taken something important from Su Lu.

Apart from Su Lu, the rest of the elders were frustrated, too. They had no idea what exactly had happened, but if they could bring the heavily-injured man back to Su Lu, they might be rewarded handsomely for it!

It was a rare opportunity for them to earn Su Lu’s favor, thus their priority was to find the man who had provoked their superiors. As for this idiot named Mo Fan, they had plenty of time to deal with him later. After all, they were all from the same country, weren’t they?

Zu Kuangli kept taking deep breaths. He was aware of how important the task at hand was. Normally, he would simply charge forward and trample on the prick’s face. Not many people dared to talk to him like that in his homeland!

“Did you really not see anything? It looked like a ball of flames. Oh, it was similar to a meteorite. It landed not far from here. If you were here just now, you must have seen where it landed. Brother Mo Fan, if there was some misunderstanding between you and Zu Kuangli, I apologize to you on his behalf. I shall treat you to a feast at my place some other day. Feel free to let me know if you need any help, but please do me a favor today. We are friends anyway,” Zhao Liwan delivered a marvelous speech.

“Who’s your friend here? Do you think you’re worthy to be my friend? Don’t make me repeat myself for the third time. Piss off, stop disturbing me from flirting with my wife!” Mo Fan did not show them any respect.

Zhao Liwan’s smiling face darkened immediately.

There was a saying, “An angry fist does not hit a smiling face”. Zhao Liwan was no ordinary person in his homeland. Apart from the elders of international organizations, most of the so-called geniuses, talented students of institutes, and talented disciples of renowned clans fawned on him. He was humbling himself to talk to Mo Fan in a friendly manner, yet it was like the person was feeding him poop in response!

‘Do you think you were worthy to be my friend?’

He had never seen anyone more arrogant! He could not stand it any longer!

“Zu Kuangli, you really shouldn’t waste your time with an idiot like him. If you don’t teach him a lesson, he’s going to think he’s the Heavenly Sovereign. He seriously thinks no one in China can touch him!” Zu Kuangli was on the verge of exploding.

“Calm down, calm down, we are currently working for Su Lu. We must remain calm. They must have seen something... we have to stay calm...” Zhao Liwan was better than Zu Kuangli at controlling his anger.

Zhao Liwan retained his friendly smile after convincing Zu Kuangli. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Unfortunately, Mo Fan struck again with his scornful words before Zhao Liwan could speak.

“Are you a dog? Why are you licking the face of the person that is scolding you? Can’t you hear me? I won’t just say it with my mouth if I have to repeat it for the third time!” Mo Fan pointed at Zhao Liwan and grunted.

Zhao Liwan was about to lose his temper!

He finally understood why Zu Kuangli was enraged as soon as he recognized Mo Fan. It was impossible to talk with him properly!

He could not stand it any longer! If he continued to withhold his anger, he was going to vomit blood!

“You asked for it. It looks like I’ll have to teach you some manners...” Zhao Liwan’s eyes flickered viciously as his face darkened.

However, he saw Mo Fan’s right hand unleashing wild lightning before he could finish his sentence.

“Screw you, my fist has been tolerating you for too long!” Mo Fan took the initiative to strike first!

Zhao Liwan was about to go mad!

Did he just say he had been tolerating me for too long!?

I was the one that felt like exploding for tolerating you, yet you dared to attack first!?

Mo Fan tossed the lightning out. The lightning sphere exploded close to the Blue-Scaled Hawk. More lightning arcs lashed out fiercely, resulting in a series of sparkles!Zu Kuangli jumped down from the Blue-Scaled Hawk. He was an Earth Mage, and controlled the sand to wrap around himself swiftly. The wild lightning soon dissipated after hitting the sturdy sand wall.

Zu Kuangli withdrew the sand and said arrogantly, “Strongest of the World College Tournament my ass. Is that all you have? Who are you trying to hurt with your stupid lightning?”

“Electro Cannon!” Mo Fan was too lazy to talk with the guy. He immediately used his strongest Lightning Spell once he gathered enough Lightning Magic to his surroundings!

The Electro Cannon was the upgraded version of the Silent Deadly Bolt. It began to accumulate several layers of Lightning Magic as Mo Fan drew the Lightning Star Constellation with the Lightning Tyrant Domain...

“You shouldn’t embarrass yourself with just an Advanced Spell!” Zhao Liwan was angry too. He realized how stupid he was trying to convince Mo Fan after realizing that he was only an Advanced Mage.

It would not take them too long to get rid of the idiot first. If he was to endure the grudge, he might feel uncomfortable for several years!
