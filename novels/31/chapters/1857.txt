The sound of knocking on wooden planks came from the Honglai Silver Mine. A figure with jagged wings suddenly rose into the sky among the buildings. It soared into the clear night sky from the concealing dust. The creature was like an exquisite weapon from the ancient times. The icy flicker of its hide was rather intimidating.

“A Carnelian Demon Bird?” Tangyue recognized the creature in the night sky at first glance.

“It looks like someone is riding it,” Mo Fan noticed.

A huge burst of laughter echoed in the sky. The whole Honglai Silver Mine could hear it.

A few researchers stood on the plaza where Councilman Nan’s statue was located. They were staring at the Carnelian Manta Ray Evil Bird in the sky excitedly.

“Twenty years, it’s been twenty years... we finally did it. It will finally obey our orders!” a man in a white coat who looked very similar to Chen Shuo exclaimed.

The man was Chen Shuo’s elder brother, Chen Wen. He was the only person who did not give up on the project to tame the Manta Ray Evil Birds. He even had his brother watch over the island and bring back a Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Bird so he could continue with the experiment.

Every experiment he had conducted on that Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Bird ended up in failure, but when the military brought back the Carnelian Manta Ray Evil Birds, he attempted to tame them while they were still drugged. To his disbelief, it worked!

The Carnelian Manta Ray Evil Bird flying in the night sky had just been tamed, and the man riding it laughing as happily as a kid was Councilman Nan!

The Heavenly Eagles were rubbish compared to the Manta Ray Evil Birds. Their base now had so many Manta Ray Evil Birds, and they already knew how to breed the creatures rapidly. The Manta Ray Evil Birds would replace the Heavenly Eagles in no time!

The Heavenly Eagles were the core of the military’s air power. If the Manta Ray Evil Birds replaced them, Councilman Nan would basically have control over half the military! Therefore, if his plan succeeded, the loss of an election would no longer matter to him. The whole country would fall to their knees before him!

“HAHAHAHA, HAHAHA, just you all wait, HAHAHA!” Councilman Nan’s voice continued to echo in the sky.

His life had been rising and falling hugely. Councilman Nan had completely gotten rid of his sullen mood during the enjoyable flight.

“Chen Wen, you did great! How about the rest of the Carnelian Demon Birds?” Councilman Nan asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“We have nine Carnelian Demon Birds. I’ve successfully tamed them all. However, the anesthesia the Lesser Featherless Birds and the Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds are under will be over soon. We tried to drug them again, but we discovered their bodies have developed a certain immunity to it. The effects won’t last long. They will be awake soon,” Chen Wen informed him.

“Why would it matter? The Lesser Featherless Birds and Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds take orders from the Carnelian Manta Ray Evil Birds! They won’t dare cause a scene once we tame all nine Carnelian Manta Ray Evil Bird!” Councilman Nan declared.

“That’s true! When we were breeding them in the past, we strictly made sure they had the nature to obey the higher-level birds. It’s only a matter of time until we tame them all now...” Chen Wen agreed.

“I can finally have a nice sleep tonight. Cai Dong, call the general of the Hongling Division over tomorrow morning. Tell him I’ll be taking charge of his division. If he knows his place, he will cooperate with me, and I’ll give him a bunch of Manta Ray Evil Birds in return. If he dares to act arrogantly in front of me still, humph!...” Councilman Nan ordered.

“Councilman Nan, he’s a general, after all... Oh, but you have the Manta Ray Evil Birds now. A general like him is nothing. I’ll visit him tomorrow!” General Cai Dong agreed.

Councilman Nan burst out laughing again. He fondled the Carnelian Demon Bird who was acting as obedient as a little parrot!

Loud knocks came from the base. Everyone followed the direction of the noises and saw several figures like bats flying out. They circled in the sky, uttering unpleasant cries.

More creatures came out of the base and soon formed a moving black storm covering the mountain. Some of the ones with sapphire eyes were flying toward the town.

“What’s going on!?” Cai Dong blurted out.

“They are all awake...” Chen Wen’s expression shifted a little.

“It’s fine, go, get them to behave themselves!” Councilman Nan patted the Carnelian Demon Bird beside him and ordered calmly.

The Carnelian Demon Bird spread its wings and flew into the sky.

It headed toward the storm of Manta Ray Evil Birds. Councilman Nan and the others followed it too, but they were moving on the ground.

The Carnelian Demon Bird cried out like it was ordering the demon birds around, but as it got closer, a huge group of Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds suddenly surrounded it and attacked it fiercely!

The Carnelian Demon Bird tried to fight back, but the number of Sapphire Manta Ray Evil Birds circling around in the sky was too overwhelming. They were like spinning blades in the sky, and shredded the Carnelian Demon Bird into pieces in just a few seconds. Fresh blood splattered across the bodies of the Manta Ray Evil Birds, making them look deadlier!

The pieces of the creature and its blood fell from the sky. Councilman Nan, Chen Wen, Cai Dong, and the others were stunned, stopping their cars at the edge of the town. They no longer dared to go any further.

“How...how...how is this possible!?” Chen Wen and Councilman Nan’s eyes were filled with disbelief and fear.

“These Manta Ray Evil Birds, why would they attack a higher-level bird? Weren’t they the most loyal species!?”

“They are not under control, they can’t be controlled at all!”

“My Heavens, they are flying toward me. Councilman Nan, Councilman Nan!” Major General Cai Dong yelled.

“Why are you panicking? You’re the major general, assemble the Honglai Mages immediately!” Councilman Nan grunted.

“Right, I’ll have them defend the town,” Major General Cai Dong agreed quickly.

“Who asked you to defend the town? Do you think we can hold so many Manta Ray Evil Birds back? Do you really think they are just a bunch of bats? Just move the Carnelian Demon Birds in the warehouse to safety!” Councilman Nan scolded.

Councilman Nan had bred these Manta Ray Evil Birds. He knew better than anyone how strong these creatures were!

“Huh? But there are so many miners, drivers, and workers in the town...”

“We have no time to waste on them. If we lose the Carnelian Demon Birds, we are going to lose everything!” Councilman Nan yelled.
