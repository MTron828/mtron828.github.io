“But I’ve turned these parasites into diligent worker bees!

“Even the government has given me the honorable title of the best entrepreneur!

“What right do you have to eliminate me by carrying the Hunters’ flag? Did you forget that you once lived here, too?

“You were one of the parasites too!”

Lu Kun kept attacking Mo Fan with the crimson instruments of torture while provoking him verbally.

“Do you think you are special because you have risen from a parasite to a swap, then to a dragon? Do you think you can step forward to call down the flames of justice?” Lu Kun raised the instruments once again.

He was controlling countless crimson torture devices and lashing out at Mo Fan.

It was like Lu Kun was trying to indoctrinate him!

Lu Kun was able to peek into fragments of Mo Fan’s memory ever since his hatred spark had appeared.

He had learned Mo Fan was set up to live in this settlement. He was one of the refugees who had lost their homes.

Lu Kun was delighted by his discovery, as if he had found the weak spot of his enemy. He kept hitting the man on the same wound.

No one could persevere under such torture. It was not just a physical brawl. Lu Kun was damaging Mo Fan’s soul, too!

“Oh? Did you also visit your old house?” Lu Kun continued to pry into Mo Fan’s past.

It turned out Lu Kun was unable to see Mo Fan’s complete memories. He could only peek into the segments whenever Mo Fan produced a red spark with his negative emotions.

“Let me see… Tsk tsk, such a pitiful little girl.

“She lives in a temporary settlement and even has to share the toilet with a few different households. The lock of the toilet’s door is always broken.

“She’s a smart girl. She tanned herself, put on boys’ clothes, and cut her hair short because her neighbor is a jobless pervert in his fifties.

“Her classmates laugh at her, the women on the streets accused her of being an illegitimate child, even her father thinks of her as a burden and does not bother going home to look after her.

“What a great seedling… How much hatred would she accumulate, growing up in such an environment?

“I bet she wishes to kill the old pervert. She must hate her students and teachers as well! She must be holding a grudge against her father for not being able to rent a proper house and having to rely on the government’s aid.

“I wonder if you can withstand her hatred?

“How amusing, you are trying to save these people, yet they are the ones going to kill you. Do you understand what you are fighting against?”

Lu Kun kept attacking Mo Fan verbally while laughing hysterically.

Lu Kun was able to strengthen the hatred Mo Fan produced to inflict damage on Mo Fan’s soul. No one could possibly defend their soul from their own hatred!

Similarly, if Lu Kun used the hatred of someone Mo Fan admired to attack him, it would severely injure Mo Fan’s soul too!

A human soul was made up of all kinds of willpower.

The Red Demon not only wanted to tear Mo Fan’s flesh into pieces, it was going to break Mo Fan’s Will at the same time!

The two horns were connected once again. Lu Kun was going to release the red wave of energy to stir up the hatred in the residents’ hearts.

This time, he was searching for people who were related to Mo Fan, especially the little girl Mo Fan had met.

He was going to attack Mo Fan with the hatred sparks from those Mo Fan knew. It could not be any crueler or more effective.

Lu Kun was brimming with excitement. He could not help but think of what a genius he was. Why did he not use the same trick to defeat Senior Hunter Leng? It would have saved him a lot of trouble!

Senior Hunter Leng had inflicted serious injuries on Lu Kun, forcing him to disguise himself as a human for many years without daring to expose himself.

It was different now. He had grown a lot stronger!

Lu Kun continued to dig up the evils in the hearts of the residents as the red circle of energy spread throughout the town.

Dark red sparks blossomed like fireworks throughout the town. Hatred was only a temporary emotion in a human heart, but the evil inside a human heart could be deeply rooted there for a long time.

The evil thoughts were hidden in the deepest places of a human heart. Even the kindest person could give birth to evil when they felt they were wronged and treated unfairly, turning them into an evil crook!

How wonderful!,?Lu Kun thought.?If such a small town can already nurture so much evil, what about all of human society?

The hatred of strangers could only damage Mo Fan’s flesh. Lu Kun was focusing on gathering the hatred that could damage Mo Fan’s soul!

The little girl was his priority. Once Mo Fan saw the evil in the little girl’s heart, he would be extremely disappointed.

The red spark that belonged to the little girl...

Lu Kun was getting impatient. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, when he was about to absorb the hatred of the little girl, he realized there was nothing hovering above her.

Nothing at all?

The red spark that belonged to the jobless man in his fifties who was only a wall apart from the little girl could almost form a lightning bolt, but there was nothing above the little girl’s head at all!

Lu Kun only noticed some minor red strings above her.

These red strings consisted of the little complaints she had for not being able to answer a few math questions, her disappointment in her father who had not come home for a few days, and her annoyance at having to face her classmates who were going to laugh at her tomorrow.

Those minor emotions were just the pure na?ve thoughts of a little girl. They were not even enough to be considered negative emotions!

Her emotions were not strong enough to form a spark, let alone a torture instrument!

“Damn it, is she a retard?” the Red Demon yelled in complaint.

The teenage years were supposed to be the best time for one to give birth to one’s evil thoughts. Those evil thoughts would easily take root in their hearts with only a slight push!

Why was the little girl’s head full of such insignificant stupid things? What about her evil scheme of disguising herself as a little boy?

“Does your face hurt?” Mo Fan was amused when he saw the Red Demon’s flustered reaction.

Real innocence was not referring to being na?ve and ignorant, but the ability to maintain a pure and kind heart while being surrounded by the evils of the world.

Mo Fan had not listened to a single word Lu Kun had said.

Greed?

Laziness?

Reluctance to improve?

A bunch of parasites?

A huge river was filled with countless waste, trash, and debris, but as long as he was able to dig up a single gold nugget from it...

Even Mo Fan had enough hatred to form a spark, but the little girl did not.

Mo Fan had never thought of himself as a kind and heroic person, but he had met many of them in his life, and to Mo Fan’s relief, the little girl was also one of them!

It did not matter if others were evil, but as long as there was one pure-hearted person in this town, it was worth it for Mo Fan to take this fight to the very end!
