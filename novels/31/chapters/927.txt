The wind blowing at Mo Fan was scorching hot. There was also a little furnace standing on his shoulder. Mo Fan had no clue how he was going to survive.

“Little Flame Belle, can you go back to sleep in your nest?” Mo Fan was dying from the heat. He immediately negotiated with Little Flame Belle.

Little Flame Belle instantly felt unhappy. The wronged look in her eyes was implying that she was annoying him.

“Alright, just lie on my shoulder, but stop drooling please,” Mo Fan caved helplessly.

Hanmi City was not very big. It was basically the size of a second or third-tier city in China. However, the population of the city was a lot lower compared to a city of the same size in China. There were not many cars and pedestrians on the main street, perhaps because it was not the peak hours yet.

“Are you guys in some sort of trouble?” Mo Fan asked Nanyu.

After enjoying the refreshing beers, the team kept mentioning something that happened recently. They were complaining to one another while trying to come up with a plan. Mo Fan had just rejoined the team, so he had no clue what they were talking about.

“Well, there are some ancient ruins around seventy kilometers away from Hanmi City. The locals mentioned wind and lightning, and rare phenomena across the place. There might be something useful there. The resources distributed by the advisors are obviously not enough for us, so apart from challenging the Training Halls, the team has been busy searching for treasure, too,” said Jiang Yu.

Despite the backgrounds that everyone was from, no one would complain about having too many resources. The secondary objective of their world-wide adventure was to search for valuable treasures too!

Considering how big the world was, it was possible to dig out rare and valuable loot. Many famous Magicians had stumbled into incredible finds during their training, allowing them to embark on a path to success. It showed how important searching for treasure was!

“Wind and lightning, ancient ruins in a desert... that sounds quite interesting...” Mo Fan mumbled to himself.

He lowered his head and glanced at the Essence Orb in his hand.

As a matter of fact, the Essence Orb was already showing some reaction after the plane landed in South America. Its light was pointing exactly in the direction of the ancient ruins. It seemed like there was something that could fill up the energy of the Essence Orb at the ancient ruins!

“Interesting my ass, there’s a long desert valley right in front of the ruins, stuck in between two fault lines. It’s our safest path to the ancient ruins, but we already tried it, and things almost went out of control. There’s a pack of Earth Elemental Creatures residing in the valley. Their flesh is sturdy and thick, and they are incredibly strong. There’s no chance we can pass their territory,” explained Jiang Yu with a troubled look.

They had already tried to cross the valley, yet they were almost stuck in it forever.

Even though the rare phenomena at the ancient ruins clearly implied there was an incredible treasure there, they had no chance of finding it if they could not find a way to cross the valley.

“Let’s just give up, we can’t even cross the valley, who knows what other dangerous things there are inside the ruins. We don’t have to risk our lives for something we aren’t even sure of,” said Zu Jiming.

“You’re just a coward!” snapped Jiang Shaoxu mercilessly. She actually held a grudge against Zu Jiming. She would never forget how the man had left her behind at the East Maritime Fortress in order to save his own life.

“I’m a coward? Tell me, what smart idea do you have that can help us cross the valley? If not, we should just move on instead of wasting our time here!” shot back Zu Jiming.

“Don’t, I feel like that place must have some incredible loot. What if it’s something like a Soul-grade Seed?” said Mo Fan.

Everyone’s eyes flickered after Mo Fan mentioned a Soul-grade Seed.

A Soul-grade Seed was something that even those with formidable backgrounds had trouble getting their hands on. A Soul-grade Seed would multiply the strength of any Advanced Magician. Not only was it handy for increasing the power of spells, it might even grant the Magician a stronger Domain.

Everyone knew how strong Domains were. They were able to instantly multiply the Magician’s control of their Element, allowing them to use their magic in any form as they wished!

“Yeah, we can still detect how abnormal the Wind Element and Lightning Element are from such a distance away. We’re lucky that the city isn’t very populated. No other Magicians have noticed the place yet. If we missed out on this opportunity, we might regret it for the rest of our lives!” Jiang Yu tried to convince the team.

“Is a Soul-grade Seed something to be found so easily? How naive!” Guan Yu snorted disdainfully.

Mo Fan could not tell if there was a Soul-grade Seed there or not, but it surely had the thing he needed to fill up the Essence Orb. He was definitely going to pay the place a visit.

However, Jiang Yu had also mentioned that the valley was the territory of some Earth Elemental Creatures. Crossing the valley was definitely going to be troublesome!

If only Lingling was here, the little girl’s intelligence was inhuman. She could easily come up with a better plan!

“Actually, crossing the valley isn’t as difficult as we thought. They don’t have eyes, and their reflexes are incredibly slow too. They basically use the vibrations of the ground and walls to detect the presence of intruders,” Nanyu pointed out.

“Forget about flying, there are a bunch of Sun Bats along the walls. We would be surrounded instantly if we tried to fly over, not to mention flying inside the valley. The demon creatures are very strict with their air space,” explained Zhao Manyan, shaking his head. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A wealthy man like him owned some Magic Wings, yet flying was actually the most dangerous approach. The eyes of the demon creatures within a few dozen li would be locking onto him like the spotlights of a prison...

“I’ve spent a few days making a kind of device that can alter the vibrations in the ground. With these devices, we can cross the valley without startling the creatures. However, we need someone to place the devices by spreading them out like a tangram. We can only walk between the devices...” said Nanyu.

“Try it then!”

“Mmm, I don’t want to miss out on the chance, either.”

How the devices that Nanyu had invented worked was fairly easy to understand. Two devices would be sending faint waves into the ground, further stabilizing the ground so the team would not shake it when they were walking on it.

The Earth Elemental Creatures were very sensitive to vibrations. Even a kitten walking past would awaken them...

Leaving Hanmi City, the team headed for the desert valley.

As they arrived at the valley, Mo Fan noticed that the Essence Orb was showing a stronger reaction. Mo Fan was overjoyed, as there was indeed something in the ancient ruins that could fill up the Essence Orb.

If he was able to collect more energy to fill up the Essence Orb, he was basically unstoppable!

“Alright, what do we do now?” Guan Yu held his hands in front of him and stood before the valley.

He did not dare to take a step further. The geology had changed significantly after entering the valley. The ground was no longer the dry orange-yellow, but mixed with a slight red. The whole valley was dark red!

Speaking of which, the view of the desert valley was quite spectacular, too.

The spacious land was split into two layers, the ground rising suddenly to the west, forming cliffs extending to the horizon. The cliffs were like the walls of a marvelous city, completely blocking off the flat ground, as if they were the boundary of a different world.

Above the cliffs were rocks baking under the scorching heat of the sun. The temperature was just too shocking; even Advanced Magicians felt like they were walking on fire. It was not a viable option.

The only path with acceptable temperature was the long canyon. The sunlight could not reach inside it, so the temperature there was a lot lower than at the top.

The ancient ruins were located at the other end of the canyon, like a holy sacred ground separated from the world, protected by the scorching cliffs. An unexplored place that even demon creatures had trouble visiting was the perfect place to search for incredible loot!

It was the main reason why the team had spent several days trying to come up with a plan.

“We only have three devices. Their coverage is around one hundred meters, so we’ll need a person to place a device at the front, and another to retrieve the device at the back as we are moving forward,” said Nanyu.

“I’ll take the first baton!” said Ai Jiangtu.

“Mmm, the Earth Elemental Creatures at the front aren’t strong, your Space Element shouldn’t startle them,” said Nanyu.

“Can’t we use our wills to place the device in front of us?” asked Mo Fan.

“It wouldn’t work, we’ll need to manually adjust the device by tuning the frequency according to the geology,” said Nanyu firmly.

“Fine...”

—

Nanyu buried a device that looked like a gyroscope at the entrance of the canyon. She adjusted the device until a green light on it lit up before she signaled Ai Jiangtu to make his move.

Ai Jiangtu immediately constructed a Star Constellation. He was covered in a mysterious silver glow.

Space shuddered as Ai Jiangtu vanished into thin air, appearing a hundred meters away in the canyon ahead of the team.

As soon as Ai Jiangtu landed on the orange-red ground, weird sounds immediately came from the walls on both sides, as countless faces popped out from the walls. They gradually took shape, their heads almost coming out from the walls...

Mo Fan opened his mouth wide when he witnessed the shocking scene. Judging by the number of the heads that had popped out from the walls, he could easily tell how overwhelming the number of Earth Elemental Creatures in the canyon was...

“These are the Forbidden Moon Rock Demons; each is as strong as a little Warrior-level creature. They are not a fan of the moonlight, we initially tried to take advantage of the moonlight at night, but the canyon is just too narrow. We are also in the southern hemisphere, and the orbit of the moon makes it harder for the moonlight to enter the canyon. It explains why there are so many Forbidden Moon Rock Demons living in this canyon.” Jiang Yu was very interested in demon creatures, and immediately explained the situation to the clueless Mo Fan.

“Quick, adjust the frequency to match the land!” blurted out Nanyu when she saw the Forbidden Moon Rock Demons about to wake up.

Ai Jiangtu’s face turned slightly unpleasant when he saw the number of Forbidden Moon Rock Demons around him.

He quickly turned the dial, helping the device adapt to the surrounding stone in order to transmit signals back to the first device at the entrance.

“Damn it, does this thing even work...” murmured Zu Jiming.

The Forbidden Moon Rock Demons already had half of their bodies out from the walls, yet the devices were still not working. The team felt like giving up when they realized how much harder it was to set up the devices than it sounded.

“It’s green!” Ai Jiangtu finally yelled.

“Press the button!” shouted Nanyu.
