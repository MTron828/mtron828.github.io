Chapter 2967: Desperate Commission

The guards’ understanding of Fire Element magic had been altered by Mo Fan’s surprising and striking magic. It was difficult to believe that a single individual was responsible for all of the magic. To execute magic of that size and strength, at the very least, an army of Mages would be needed! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“That’s very powerful! Mr. Mo Fan, did you reach the realm of the Flame God in just a few years?!” Ozawa looked amazed. It was no wonder Mo Fan could defeat Shao Watani with a snap of his finger. Mo Fan’s magic had reached the apex, and no one could stop him!

“Please don’t flatter me. Let’s leave first,” said Mo Fan with a smile.

The Guard Regiment’s formation on the drawbridge was in shambles. They lacked solid skills to stop Mo Fan. Mo Fan and his group dashed out of the drawbridge. Meanwhile, the head of the Guard Regiment had already vanished. He must have gone to report to his master.

The massive barrier of the forbidden system was still around. The faint moonlight illuminated the barrier, they barely saw its outline that resembled pale yellow bubbles.

Mo Fan and his group sneaked into the complex West Guardian Towers. However, the towers were agitated. Apparently, the chiefs had received the news. They gathered a large number of armies, Guard Regiment, and Patrol Mages to surround all the towers.

Mo Fan would not make enemies with anyone inside the West Guardian Towers, despite the fact that most of the residents were the Evil Gang and a sizable number of Blood Demons. After all, a portion of them, like Ozawa, were still being kept in the dark. These people held onto their faiths and kept themselves from crossing the lines. They fought valiantly.

“We have to find allies. Otherwise, we’ll be branded as thugs and heretics by those fake chiefs and heads,” said Ozawa.

“That’s not a good idea. The West Guardian Towers have fallen. We’ve barged into the East Guardian Towers and triggered their bottom line. Everyone inside the towers have basically branded us as their enemies, anyway,” said Lingling.

“We have to expose their lies. We can’t allow them to continue to wreak havoc.” said Ozawa.

“How do you suppose we do that? We’ve already alerted them. We can’t possibly tell the crowd that the chiefs, Katana Mochizuki, Tegami Fujikata, and the others are actually Blood Demons. The reason they have never been suspected shows that they have assimilated with the actual identities in many ways,” Mo Fan said guiltily.

How could they convince the crowd?

Only the trio was aware of the reality. No one would believe Ozawa since he was branded a traitor. They wouldn’t believe such a ridiculous tale unless the crowd saw the imprisoned Chiefs, Katana Mochizuki, and the rest of the gang in the East Guardian Towers by themselves.

“We have to uncover the Red Demon’s true identity. Once we uncover it, the Blood Demons will be neutralized,” said Lingling.

“Tomorrow night will be its Ascension Day.”

“The West Guardian Towers is in chaos. The fake chief will take this opportunity to wipe off the deviants,” said Ozawa with great urgency.

“Don’t panic. Give me some time. The Red Demon has to fulfill its Righteous Soul’s last wish, after all. It will not leave it alone. It is certainly inside the Twin Guardian Towers.” Lingling sat down and repeated the hypothesis she had previously put out in the jail.

Lingling had some inkling that the Red Demon was nearby. But she was unsure of just which it was. It had to be a demon posing as someone else who spoke normally to them while snickering behind their backs.

“Mr. Mo Fan, the Chief told me something very important just now,” Ozawa whispered to Mo Fan while Lingling was deep in thought.

Mo Fan and Ozawa stood at the side. It was best to let Lingling figure things out in silence so that they could scale down their area of investigation.

“What is it?” asked Mo Fan.

“The West Guardian Towers’ forbidden system is an ancient system to prevent the prisoners from escaping the East Guardian Towers and entering society. Before this, I didn’t understand why the fake Chief sealed off the West Guardian Towers by using Ki Kurokawa as an excuse. But the Chief reminded me of something in the prison…,” said Ozawa.

He paused for a moment. He stared into Mo Fan’s eyes and said solemnly, “Once the West Guardian Towers’ ancient forbidden system is opened, it will last for a week. After a week, the ancient forbidden system will enter a period of dormancy…”

“Dormancy?!” Mo Fan’s jaw dropped.

“The fake Chief has the intention to release all the Blood Demons. The Red Demon wants to grant amnesty to the prisoners inside the East Guardian Towers. The scariest part will be that they can walk among others in human’s skin,” said Officer Ozawa.

The Blood Demons were the true prisoners. The Red Demon had transformed them into Blood Demons before impersonating the people inside the West Guardian Towers.

They had prisoner’s marks on them. Even if they became someone else, they could not leave the West Guardian Towers, because the ancient forbidden system would stop them.

However, if the fake Chief used a lousy excuse to open the ancient forbidden system and exhausted the energy stored in it, the demons, murderers, and bloodthirsty thugs from the East Guardian Towers would enter into the society when the ancient forbidden system entered the stage of dormancy!

The majority of the prisoners were inhumane. They would only cause panic and trouble to Osaka.

“Mr. Mo Fan, can you do me a favor?” Ozawa asked gravely.

Mo Fan did not answer him.

“I-If we fail to stop the Red Demon, could you destroy the Twin Guardian Towers?” asked Ozawa.

“There are still many innocent people inside the towers. Ozawa, how can you make such a request?” asked Mo Fan.

“The old Chief once told me that there is nothing to be proud of or any sense of superiority among the guards manning the Twin Guardian Towers. The ones who truly contribute to the world are those who sacrifice themself in arresting the wanted criminals. The East Guardian Towers imprison thousands of heinous criminals, but more are the number of people who sacrifice themselves in arresting them. These people are truly worthy of our admiration. Hence, we write down their spirit signs in the Sacrificial Mountain. Whenever we are at a loss, or we are in the middle of greed and foolishness, we go there and worship them, so that we are reminded of the people who established the Twin Guardian Towers for us…”

“If the Twin Guardian Towers fall, the heinous criminals will escape. Even if we commit hara-kiri, we lack the fortitude to confront our ancestors.”

“Therefore, we must stop the criminals from leaving this area at all costs. Those that are still rational would, in my opinion, make the same decision that I do. We’d sooner die beside them than allow even one of them to escape!”

Ozawa spoke with resolve. Mo Fan could even hear his loud breathing.

“I can’t do that.” Mo Fan shook his head. He turned down Ozawa’s outrageous request without hesitation.

“Mr. Mo Fan!” Officer Ozawa said sternly. “No one will blame you. Instead, you will redeem all of us inside the Twin Guardian Towers. Please fulfill our wish!”

“I’m a man of principles, Ozawa. I won’t destroy the Twin Guardian Towers even if you’re the only person inside with a clear head, let alone for the innocent people inside who cling to their beliefs even now,” Mo Fan remarked sadly.

“But—”

“We still have some time. Since you choose to believe in us, don’t simply blurt out such nonsense. Trust us, the Red Demon is not only your problem, it is also our target.” Mo Fan patted Ozawa’s shoulders.

Ozawa looked perplexed. Mo Fan breathed out a sigh and whispered to Ozawa, “Lingling’s father was a hunter. He died because of the Red Demon. Even though he knew he was going to die, he saved a death commission for us.”

Mo Fan had taken over the commission.

The desperate commission was not just a commission from a hunter, it was also a commission from a father.

Although he never had a chance to speak to the Cold Hunting King, Mo Fan promised him that he would take good care of Lingling. He would carry out his instructions and destroy the Red Demon himself!

The Red Demon was the main culprit!
