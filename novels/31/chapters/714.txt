Chapter 715: Fishing Village, Spotting of Sea Monsters

The little fishing village was not far away. After they crossed the little fences that were merely treated as decorations, the group immediately saw several old houses made of wood and rocks. The structures looked dull and wet from the erosion by the constant wind blowing from the sea.

The group of thirteen blatantly walked into the village. In the end, the people they saw in the village numbered less than their group. The kid who was crouching on the side playing in the mud blinked rapidly, as if he had never seen so many young, attractive brothers and sisters. When the Magicians approached him, he quickly ran into a house and observed them from the window.

“It’s you again, don’t you think you can bully us just because we’re poor and uneducated. I’m telling you, you wouldn’t want to mess with me!” a tanned old man in wooden clogs rushed out with a giant oar in his hand.

The old man stood in the horse stance with glittering eyes and held the giant oar firmly, as if he was prepared to take them on.

A few other young men rushed out with tools under the old fisherman’s lead.

In the end, there were only eight of them in total, numbering even less than the ‘invaders’. Most interestingly, the young men’s eyes widened, as if they had never seen such gorgeous women before.

Although the prettiest woman in their village, who they always fantasized about, had smooth and tender skin too, they totally forgot her after seeing the fairy maidens before them. Their skin was white like jade, their legs were breathtaking, their waists were slim, and their faces...

“Mister, is this some kind of understanding? It’s our first time here, we just want to ask you something,” said Ai Jiangtu.

“Stop putting up an act. You’ve built a few houses with concrete and tricked the villagers who lacked resolve over. You even urged them to convince us to move over, saying that it’s for our own good. Too bad, I know you’re just planning on taking our land!” cursed the old fisherman.

The group of Magicians was indeed well-clothed. After all, every candidate of the national team came from a relatively wealthy background. Even those from ordinary families could easily earn some money with their capabilities.

The old fisherman was able to tell their extraordinary identities. He did not believe anyone other than the cunning real estate agents would purposely pay their village a visit.

The Magicians were left speechless. It would not make sense to tell the villagers that they were kicked out of a helicopter, even though that was exactly what the advisors did to them.

“We’re from an outing tourist group. We were simply following the shoreline here. We only came here to ask for directions, to see if there’s a port nearby,” explained Nanyu, reacting quickly.

“Outing tourist group? What is that?” asked the old fisherman with a confused look.

“Old man, it’s a group of adventurous young men and women going on a trip to somewhere remote. The urbanites love it, saying that it’s thrilling,” said a skinny man.

“Oh, so you’re not estate agents?” asked the old fisherman.

“Of course not, do we really look like one?” said Jiang Shaoxu with a smile, purposely giving the men a few seductive winks.

The men swallowed hard. It felt like their eyes almost flew into the cleavage that Jiang Shaoxu purposely exposed with her low-cut shirt.

“Well...sorry for that, you said you are trying to find the port, right? Just follow the shoreline across the bay for a few dozen of kilometers and you’ll see the Feiniao Harbor soon,” said the old fisherman.

“Thanks, we should get to the port before nighttime,” said Nanyu.

The group nodded. They immediately headed into the direction that the old fisherman pointed to.

The villagers followed behind when the group set off. The men could not lift their gazes from the bouncing buttocks...

“Old man, we forgot to tell them about it,” said the skinny man.

“Right, quick, go and warn them,” said the old fisherman.

“I’ll go, I’ll go!”

“I’ll go, I can run faster, I’ll go...”

The group did not walk far when the skinny man caught up to them while panting heavily.

He finally caught up to Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan who were walking at the back of the group. He stopped to catch his breath.

“You walk pretty fast, I had to run so far just to catch up with you,” said the skinny man.

Mo Fan smiled. It was nothing strange since they were all Magicians. Even though they were walking, their pace was a lot faster than ordinary people.

“What’s wrong?” asked Mo Fan.

“Listen to me, there are rumors about sea monsters around here. Many places are under attack, so it’s better that you stay away from the shoreline along your journey. If you see the sea monsters, just run,” said the skinny man.

“Aren’t we inside the safe zone? Why would there be sea monsters still?” Jiang Shaoxu touched the beauty spot beside her lips and stuck her tongue out at the skinny man, as if she was trying to tease him.

The skinny man did not fall for it easily. He said sternly, “The sea monsters have been around for quite some time, but for some reason, the authorities have never sent anyone here to deal with them. I even heard that a few fishermen from the village next to us went missing after they went out fishing.”

“We’re not too scared of the sea monsters. Brother, why don’t you guide us to the port? I promise to reward you greatly,” Jiang Shaoxu tapped the man’s shoulder and said with a smile.

“Well...” The man hesitated for a while before saying with a nod, “Alright, there’s nothing to do in the village, since the chief doesn’t allow us to go fishing in the ocean.”

“What do you eat, if you can’t fish?” Mo Fan asked an important question.

“The stock we kept, but it’s only going to last a few months. I’ll have to ask around in Feiniao City and see when they are going to send someone over to deal with the sea monsters. We can’t even go fishing if they don’t get rid of the sea monsters,” said the skinny man.

“That’s completely unnecessary. You just need to guide me there, and I’ll eliminate the sea monsters for you. It’s as easy as waving my hand,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“I’ll bring you to the harbor; as for the sea monsters, forget it... they aren’t something that ordinary people stand a chance against. I heard Da Hu from the other village mentioned that the sea monsters were around five meters tall. A single bite from them could tear our boats in half, that’s scary!” said the skinny man seriously.

Jiang Shaoxu smiled without continuing the conversation.

The skinny man was called Liu Meng, a typical naive young adult who rarely left the village. It seemed like he was working as a fisherman with his family before completing his studies.

The villages along the shoreline were not wealthy. Many of the fishing villages were rather poor. On top of that, transportation was not as developed, thus the villages were quite feudal.

Jiang Shaoxu was unhappy. She thought with her charm, she could easily seduce a village boy. However, Liu Meng’s ability to control himself was beyond Jiang Shaoxu’s expectation. As a matter of fact, Mo Fan already noticed that even though Liu Meng was well-behaving, he would occasionally glance at Mu Ningxue in her black robe and black boots.

Mo Fan was not too bothered by Liu Meng’s pure admiration of beauty. However, considering someone like Gong Yu, who kept peeking with his perverted eyes, it would only be a matter of time until he dug the man’s eyes out!
