The battle gradually intensified. Not long after, both Jiang Shaoxu and the Psychic Mage were worn out mentally, and were disqualified from the match.

Jiang Shaoxu’s performance today was utterly shocking. If the Granite Inferior Dragon was considered half a person in terms of strength, she had taken out the tanned Mage, Parker the Psychic Mage, and the Granite Inferior Dragon. She basically took out two and a half people out on her own!

Without Jiang Shaoxu’s contribution, it was unlikely that the match would have lasted until now.

Seeing Jiang Shaoxu leaving the stage feebly, Mo Fan immediately charged into the battlefield.

The supporters of the Chinese team burst into an uproar at his appearance. They were well aware of how strong Mo Fan was, and he was currently ranked fifth among all the participants, even though the ranking did not necessarily reflect their true strength!

“Intercept him!” the German captain Johnson instantly ordered his teammates.

The assistant judge would bring the participant that was knocked out down the stage, and there was an entrance at the corner of the stage. The substitute member was only allowed to enter the stage after receiving the signal from the assistant judge.

Since the position of the teams would keep changing as the match went on, the entrance that Mo Fan was at was actually closer to the German team.

To everyone’s surprise, the German team suddenly withdrew from the fight against the Chinese team. The four of them were all heading toward the entrance where Mo Fan was!

The four members of the German team were very aggressive, planning to disqualify Mo Fan by abusing the opportunity granted to them by the rules!

“F**k, no wonder they kept moving in that direction!” Zhao Manyan yelled.

“We have to back him up!” Jiang Yu said.

“He’s too far away, and considering how split up we are, if we move too close, their destructive Mage could easily attack us. If they are picking on our substitute, we’ll pick on theirs instead!” Ai Jiangtu said.

The distance was indeed too far, and by the time they reached the place, Mo Fan would be flanked.

“He’s right, Mo Fan should be able to hold on by himself, we need to hurry!”

The Chinese team reacted fairly quickly too. They immediately targeted the substitute of the German team.

—

Fire, Lightning, Ice, Demon Tree Hand: when Mo Fan was preparing to display his remarkable prowess in the match saw the spells approaching him, his face immediately turned pale!

-F**k this shit, do they seriously have to set me up when I just joined the match?-

Mo Fan knew the opponents he was facing were unlike the weak students he had fought against before. He immediately cast Time Stasis to slow down the magic spells targeting him and summoned the Dark Noble Mantle to make him invisible.

“Brilliant Light!” The captain of the German team was a smart man. He instinctively cast a Light Spell when he saw Mo Fan suddenly vanish into thin air.

The light almost instantly revealed Mo Fan’s silhouette.

“He’s there!” Johnson fired an arrow of Brilliant Light at Mo Fan to tag his faint silhouette, allowing his teammates to see where Mo Fan was too.

“Well done, captain, leave him to me!” Reed immediately locked his destructive spells on Mo Fan. A lightning arc immediately swept past and struck Mo Fan fiercely.

Following it, a Demon Torture appeared and grabbed Mo Fan’s faint silhouette.

The scorching flames of the Groundbreak erupted right under Mo Fan’s feet!

The advisors could not help but wear anxious looks when they saw the different lights from the spells that were targeting Mo Fan.

They were hoping that Mo Fan could apply great pressure to the German team, so the Chinese team could secure an advantageous position, but they did not expect the German team to blast Mo Fan with all they had as soon as he joined the match.

The other members of the German team were not as much of a threat to Mo Fan, but the damage of Reed’s magic was comparable to his own. It was fairly difficult for anyone to resist Reed’s attacks alone!

—

“Are his teammates seriously not going to save him?”

“Don’t tell me the strongest member of the Chinese team, Mo Fan, is going to be knocked out in an instant. Ai Jiangtu and the others weren’t smart with their decision. Mo Fan’s strength greatly surpasses the substitute of the German team. They are more than willing to trade their substitute with Mo Fan, who’s fifth on the ranking!”

“Indeed, but there’s nothing they could do, either. The German team has been planning for it all along.”

—

Meanwhile, Ai Jiangtu and his teammates easily knocked out the substitute from the German team, yet none of them seemed to be happy about it.

“How’s Mo Fan doing?” Jiang Yu blurted out.

“Not sure, it’s an entire mess there. A normal person would be crippled by now.”

A huge puff of smoke rose into the air. The spells slowly dissipated after a while. Johnson stared closely at the Brilliant Light that he had used to tag Mo Fan previously.

The tagging of the Brilliant Light had quite a long duration. If the tag disappeared before it reached its limit, it simply meant the target had been eliminated.

But even so, Johnson did not seem relieved.

He was a Shadow Mage too, so something did not feel right about the target that he tagged.

“Brilliant Light: Disperse!”

Johnson cast a spell to drive the dust and the smoke away.

He glanced around and immediately noticed a human figure standing close to the barrier. Even though it was still within the coverage of the spells they had cast, the spells did not really inflict serious damage on him!

“What just happened?” the eyes of the woman with moles widened. She could not believe that Mo Fan was perfectly fine after the continuous blasts.

Even a Commander-level creature would be covered in wounds and bruises after enduring the attacks from the four of them, let alone a Mage. How did the guy manage to dodge their attacks? They had clearly landed their spells on him, and their captain had clearly tagged him with the Brilliant Light too.

“It’s a shadow clone!” Johnson’s face darkened. He immediately realized that the target they had attacked was not actually Mo Fan.

“It’s possible to summon a clone with the Shadow Element?” The woman with moles sounded quite surprised.

“The level of his Fleeing Shadow is very high; we didn’t know he was an expert of the Shadow Element too!” Johnson’s gaze sharpened.

“Don’t let him run away, Fendy!”

“Don’t worry, there’s no way he can outrun me!”

It went without saying that Mo Fan had no intention to fight the four members of the opposing team on his own. He immediately went to regroup with his team after tricking his opponents.

Mo Fan did not have any defensive spells, and he had already used the Shadow Clone. He would be in great trouble if he was caught again.

He ran along the boundary of the stage. The Ground Spikes emerging behind him made his heart race even faster. He began to regret how he had failed to keep a low-profile during the treasure hunt and the knockout round. Otherwise, the opposing team would not be so keen to take him out of the match, making him as miserable as a dog running with its tail between its legs!

“Still trying to run away? Realm of the Wind!” Fendy was flying in the air with Wind Wings. He glanced down at the desperately fleeing Mo Fan from above.

A few winds blew simultaneously, gathering the yellow sand into the wind and constructing a barrier of wind and sand to prevent Mo Fan from regrouping with his team.

“You’re pretty bold to come after me on your own!” Mo Fan harrumphed coldly while glancing in the direction of the German team.

Without wasting any time, Mo Fan threw a Fiery Fist at Fendy.

Fendy was pretty nimble, and quite adept at controlling the Wind Wings. With a flap of his wings, he dashed sideways and dodged Mo Fan’s attack!

“Gravity Space!”

Mo Fan spread his palm and used his will to form a gravitational force field around Fendy. The man started falling from the air as if numerous iron balls were hanging on him!

“Chains of Darkness!”

Mo Fan was fairly quick at chain-casting his spells. After the gravitational space, he immediately constructed the formation of Giant Shadow Spikes, firing several shadow swords at Fendy. Fendy tried to dodge the shadow swords, but he was still struck by a few of them!

Fendy was immediately paralyzed under the effects of the gravitational force and the Chains of Darkness.

An Advanced Star Constellation appeared around Mo Fan. However, as he was halfway through the process, a thick lightning bolt came down from the sky, a sinister green flame inside it!

Mo Fan subconsciously used his will to form a wall to defend himself, yet he was shocked when he saw the lightning passing through his defense easily and landing on him.

Sand was swept in the air. The little sand dune turned into a giant sand pit, and the ground nearby was scorched black. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan lay in the middle of the pit. His entire back was blistered. He could even smell his skin burning.

Mo Fan rose to his feet. His eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Reed, who had attacked him sneakily!

The other three members showed up and surrounded Mo Fan. He knew now was not the time to act recklessly, but he was determined to get his revenge on Reed.

That imbecile, he swore he would show the man his Lightning Tyrant soon!

“Mo Fan, come with me!” Ai Jiangtu’s voice appeared.

Mo Fan realized that Ai Jiangtu had suddenly appeared in front of him. He was overjoyed, and anxious at the same time. If he could master the Advanced Spell of the Space Element, Blink, he would not have found himself in such a pinch now. With the Shadow Element and Blink, any opposing team would have trouble doing any harm to him, even if they had twice their numbers!

Ai Jiangtu cast Blink twice in a row to drag Mo Fan out of his dangerous situation.

The German team was absolutely enraged after seeing this!

Even with the four of them, they had failed to defeat the man. Even worse, they had sacrificed a substitute member on their side!

—

“That’s just like Mo Fan, able to escape even though he was completely surrounded. I wonder if the wound on his back is anything serious. Let’s hope it doesn’t affect his performance.”

“We still have a Healer on our team. He can soon recover from it. Unfortunately, the German team still has a substitute left. The advantage that Mo Fan has given the team by putting his life at stake will be gone soon, as the two teams will be back on an equal footing!” Feng Li said.

“That’s the best we could hope for. It simply means Mo Fan has helped the team to take out a member of the opposing team even though he has just joined the match!” Song He was quite optimistic!
