“He used Blink to relocate the Viscera Hunters. As expected of Senior!” Zhang Xin finally realized what just happened.

Mo Fan purposely exposed himself to lure the remaining Viscera Hunters by the Magical Sea Beast’s side to attack him. He then used Blink to move the Viscera Hunters away from the Magical Sea Beast after they pounced on him, giving him the perfect opportunity to kill the Magical Sea Beast!

With a huge clap of thunder, Mo Fan shoved a lightning orb at the Magical Sea Beast with half of its body above the water.

The flesh of the Magical Sea Beast blew all over the place like a scarlet wave when the lightning orb exploded!

The Magical Sea Beast’s blood poured down on the Viscera Hunters. Normally, these creatures would be celebrating in the rain of blood, but the Magical Sea Beast...

The Magical Sea Beast had died, meaning that the Viscera Hunters who were supposed to protect it were doomed too!

The Viscera Hunters completely lost their calm. They roared and charged Mo Fan while they were soaked in blood.

This time, Mo Fan was truly surrounded by the creatures. More than a hundred Viscera Hunters had been enraged. They were going to drag Mo Fan to death too, or perhaps scatter his remains across the sky just like what he did to the Magical Sea Beast.

“Crap, Senior is struggling to break free from their surround!” Zhang Xin exclaimed.

They did not even have the chance to celebrate the death of the first Magical Sea Beast before they noticed Mo Fan was already injured by the raging Viscera Hunters.

The biggest problem Mo Fan was facing when being heavily surrounded was not being able to use his Advanced and Super Spells. His Basic and Intermediate Spells were not very effective against the Viscera Hunters.

“Senior, we will remember your sacrifice for the city...” Zhang Xin yelled at the circle of sea monsters in Wuyuan Bay.

“Is there really nothing we can do?” Zhang Lulin said.

“We will only get ourselves killed if we go. Killing each Magical Sea Beast will lower the tide rise by a level. Senior is buying more time for us to evacuate the city. We shouldn’t let him die for nothing!” Zhang Xin declared.

“Zhang Xin, he’s still alive.”

“He’s pretty much dead, let’s go.”

Mo Fan was indeed in a very dangerous position under the circumstances. It was not his first time being surrounded by a large group of demon creatures, but the creatures then were usually Servant-class or Warrior-level creatures, and not as strong as the Viscera Hunters. Mo Fan had taken a huge risk just to kill the Magical Sea Beasts before the tide rose. He ended up leaving himself with no escape.

He had to be constantly running when fighting the Viscera Hunters to gradually reduce their numbers, so he would not be attacked from different directions. It was the only way to make sure he had a chance to use his Advanced Spells. Unfortunately, these cunning Viscera Hunters were not giving Mo Fan any chance to use his Advanced Spells. They were recklessly crossing the Intermediate Spells Mo Fan had left along the way and inflicting cuts on him.

“These scumbag undead!”

Mo Fan was covered in burning wounds. He did not withdraw his flames while he was cursing.

The presence of Fire Magic was very weak around here, and so were Little Flame Belle’s abilities. However, Mo Fan still used his Fire Element since it was his main Element when fighting. His control over the Fire Element was the strongest, so he was more adept at using the Fire Spells!

I still made a mistake. These things are more annoying than I thought. Mo Fan took another blow to his back. Luckily, he had formed a shield with Telekinesis to block the attacks, so the cuts were not so deep. If my Earth Element and Chaos Element were stronger, I wouldn’t be in this situation now.

The spells Mo Fan could use were too few. He was currently in a pinch because his Fire Element was suppressed. Most annoyingly, his Dark Material was not very effective against these creatures that were a hybrid of sea creatures and phantoms.

It did not mean his new Dark Material was not strong, but the Shadow Element was just not effective against creatures like the Viscera Hunters.

His Fire Element was not working well, and his Shadow Element, which had gotten a lot stronger recently, was useless against the Viscera Hunters. He was in a pretty bad spot. The sea had never been kind to him. If he did not Awaken other Elements and improve his Chaos Element and Earth Element, he would continue to be bullied by sea monsters!

The wind was howling. Mo Fan even sensed a significant change in the airflow nearby. He lifted his gaze amid the chaos and happened to see a huge waterspout rolling toward him like a ferocious beast.

Mo Fan initially thought some sea monster capable of manipulating the wind was attacking him, yet he realized someone was helping him when the waterspout knocked more than twenty Viscera Hunters into the sky!

Mo Fan saw a blurred figure in the waterspout, who seemed to be responsible for the powerful wind. The whole waterspout was following him!

Mo Fan was surprised. The person’s Wind Element was quite astonishing. He was able to control the wind to destroy everything along its path!

“Brother Fan, come with me!” a familiar voice shouted.

Mo Fan was startled.

It was Zhang Xiaohou? Since when was his Wind Element so powerful?

A swift figure appeared in front of Mo Fan before he could react. The wind around him quickly engulfed Mo Fan and swept him higher.

“Time to go!”

The wind suddenly picked up its momentum and forced an opening through the encircling creatures, helping them to break out of the circle.

The Viscera Hunters lunged at them angrily. They even rammed into the waterspout to drag Mo Fan down, but Zhang Xiaohou’s speed was absolutely insane. He managed to clear a path right through the pack of them. The Viscera Hunters seemed a lot slower when compared to Zhang Xiaohou!

Speed had always been Zhang Xiaohou’s strength. Mo Fan just did not expect his speed to be so shocking.

Did Mo Fan have to worry about being surrounded by the Viscera Hunters or not having an opportunity to kill the Magical Sea Beasts now that Zhang Xiaohou was here?
