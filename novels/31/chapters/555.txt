“Shit, lots of zombies are heading in our direction. They seem to be following this Corpse General’s order!” yelled A Li.

“Don’t panic; A Xing, A Li, you two handle the zombies,” said the black silk woman Meng’e.

Her hair was soaking wet from the rain. Even her black veil had almost fallen off from her attractive face.

Everyone thought they would never have the chance to see her face because of the veil, yet she did not seem to be bothered. She tore the veil off and threw it to the ground, revealing a jade-white, perfect face...

It did not turn out to be a full western face. Without taking a closer look, it did not have any huge difference compared to the looks of an Eastern woman, but her eyes were glittering like stars. Her eyelashes, with raindrops dangling at the edges, were extraordinarily attractive!

Mo Fan had long dreamt of seeing her face, and his wish had just come true, yet since the filthy Corpse General, serving as a great contrast to the woman’s beauty, was standing right before them, he had no time to indulge in her gorgeous looks...

Meng’e seemed to know Mo Fan’s strength. After sending her two subordinates to handle the zombies, she quickly went up to Mo Fan and Liu Ru and said firmly, “We’ll deal with it together!”

“Run, run you fools, there’s no way you can fight against a Giant Corpse General!” Shorty still showed a slight bit of conscience by not running for his life straightaway.

Shorty had spent years in the Ancient Capital. He was well aware of how terrifying a Corpse General was.

Most Undead were Servant-class, yet even a team of Intermediate Magicians could easily be overwhelmed by their numbers.

However, agitating a Corpse General was closer to a death sentence. The Corpse General could summon all the Undead within a kilometer to it. Even if they were able to kill several hundred Undead, there was no way they could hold off thousands of zombies rushing toward them like a surging current.

A Corpse General would be a nightmare for Intermediate Magicians, let alone this Giant Corpse General before them that had been nurtured by the Land of the Undead for decades!

Normally, only Advanced Magicians could handle a Giant Corpse General. Even a team consisting of the elites among Intermediate Magicians would be wiped out too!

“The whole place is filled with Undead. The rain has cut off the route we’re taking. We have nowhere to run to either, it will only be a matter of time until we’re caught. It’s almost dawn, let’s hold them off until then...” said Mo Fan.

Meng’e shared the same thought as Mo Fan. Running was meaningless in a situation like this. Not only was the Giant Corpse General enormous, its speed was incredible, too. A single roar would attract the Undead in the surroundings to intercept them. There was no way they could possibly escape from the creature.

The only choice was to eliminate the Giant Corpse General before a vast number of Undead arrived!

“Liu Ru, lure the zombies in that direction away,” said Mo Fan to Liu Ru after casting a glance in a certain direction in the rain.

Liu Ru nodded. She quickly disappeared into the rain.

“Can she handle it?” said the muscular man in astonishment when he saw the seemingly weak woman charging in the direction of the Undead by herself.

“Don’t worry, she’s not as weak as you have imagined,” said Mo Fan. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was likely that Liu Ru’s current strength was stronger than the vampire Nie Dong. When she had first turned into a vampire, she was able to inflict serious damage to Nie Dong. Now that she had gotten used to the power, these zombies stood no chance against her!

Besides, even if she were overwhelmed by the zombies, the Undead would stop attacking her once she withdrew her presence. Strictly speaking, the breath she exhaled was not living, either.

“Come, come keep me company!” The Hatchet Corpse General’s hideous face twisted. The words it uttered sent a chill down everyone’s spine.

The cold rain poured down heavily. The Giant Corpse General swung its hatchets wildly at Mo Fan and Meng’e with pure brute force. The creature was not relying on the hatchets’ sharpness to murder its target, but simply using their weight to crush its prey!

“Fleeing Shadow!”

“Fleeing Shadow!”

Mo Fan uttered the chant of the Spell. His figure blended with the shadow and sank into the ground in the rain, and quickly moved over twenty meters away.

Similarly, Meng’e also possessed the Shadow Element. Her Fleeing Shadow was third-tier, hence her speed was slightly slower than Mo Fan’s, and the Spell did not summon two shadows.

After creating some distance from the Hatchet Corpse General, Mo Fan glanced at Meng’e and could only see her blurry gorgeous face in the rain, “Try and control its movement with Giant Shadow Spike, I’ll attract its attention.”

Meng’e nodded. Her glamorous figure vanished into thin air once again.

“Lightning Strike!”

Mo Fan instantly cast the Basic Lightning Spell. The fourth-tier Lightning Strike produced several lightning eels close to the target, while the rain conducted the electricity too, resulting in a succession of crackling noises!

Mo Fan controlled the Lightning Strike and created an electric field in the direction the Hatchet Corpse General was heading. The space-shaking effect of the purple-black lightning flickers spread the lightning arcs even further.

The Hatchet Corpse General was just about to lunge at Mo Fan when it set its foot into the electric field. Its soaking wet body helped to conduct the electricity into it.

Unfortunately, the bones and muscles of Undead were dead to begin with. On top of that, the Hatchet Corpse General had fairly thick and sturdy skin. The paralyzing effect was not effective enough to immobilize the creature, it only slowed it down.

The Hatchet Corpse General was fairly invulnerable. Even a fourth-tier Basic Spell was nowhere near enough to stop it. It charged at Mo Fan wildly after receiving the Lightning Strike, swinging the giant hatchets like a meat lawnmower!

“Blood Tabi!”

Mo Fan did not preserve his strength. He used his Boot Equipment straightaway.

Accumulating the force under the feet, Mo Fan leapt sideways into the air over ten meters away, dodging the Giant Corpse General’s tank-like charge.

However, as soon as Mo Fan landed on the ground, the Hatchet Corpse General had already recovered from its momentum and arrived before him. It lashed out with the four hatchets!

Mo Fan was astounded by the Corpse General’s speed. As Shorty mentioned, even a team of Intermediate Magicians was not enough to take the creature down.

Luckily Mo Fan was prepared for it, as the place he landed was dark enough for him to cast the Fleeing Shadow.

As soon as the Corpse General swung its hatchets down, Mo Fan sank into the ground in the form of a shadow...

The shadow quickly split into two. One of them moved into the distance like a black stray cat running past at night.

The Giant Corpse General quickly assumed the human was trying to run away as soon as it saw the shadow moving away quickly. It started running after the shadow before its swinging arms came to a stop, and proceeded to smash the shadow into pieces a few seconds later...

“This Giant Corpse General is most likely stronger than the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast!” Mo Fan’s came out from the shadow and fixed his eyes on the Giant Corpse General!

Warrior-level creatures could be further categorized into different levels. Back then, the group had consisted of students who were all Intermediate Magicians, yet they were almost wiped out by the traps set up by the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast in the abandoned Jinlin City...

In comparison, the Giant Corpse General was even stronger than the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast that relied on traps to hunt its prey. Its fighting capacity was shocking; even experienced Hunters were no match for it!
