“Why haven’t I heard any information about this defensive Mage?” Johnson said coldly, glaring at his teammates.

The woman with moles said in an awkward voice, “I did check on him; he’s the second son of the Zhao Clan. The information stated that the Zhao Clan spent a fortune just so he could join the national team. Besides, he didn’t really show any outstanding performance in the previous matches. We didn’t think he was actually preserving his strength. The Zhao Financial Group must have spent hundreds of billions on him.”

The defensive ability that Zhao Manyan had displayed would easily make him one of the best defensive Mages in the tournament. It was something that the German team had not expected at all.

They did not like to be taken by surprise. They had gotten used to having everything under their control, but because of the Turtle Shell Mage, they were forced to change their strategy!

The German team was fairly good at reacting according to the situation. As soon as they decided on a new strategy, the members immediately proceeded to carry it out.

The strongest attacker on their team was being suppressed by a Psychic Maga and a Sound Maga. Since the enemy team was trying to drag the match out with their defense, the only choice the German team had was to let their destructive Mage Reed attack instead!

“You guys have seriously let me down, the four of you can’t even take three people on,” Reed mocked them.

“Defensive spells are meant to be stronger than offensive spells. Besides, what could we do when they are holed up like that?” the woman with moles shot back, displeased.

“That just means your attacks aren’t strong enough!” Reed snapped. His eyes flickered with a hint of madness!

“What are you even proud of? You’re having trouble casting a useful spell too,” the tanned Ice Mage said.

“Sound Element and Psychic Element, it’s obvious that the Chinese team is well-prepared, they have sent out two Mages to deal with me,” Reed huffed.

“Isn’t that because you exposed too much of your strength before this?”

“That’s enough, go take those two mages out to free Reed from their suppression. It’s time to destroy them!” Johnson stopped the quarrel.

—

Using the Psychic Element against the enemy’s Psychic Element, the handsome Mage that had not done anything much on the German team finally made his move. He first targeted Jiang Shaoxu’s Spiritual World.

Jiang Shaoxu had to focus to suppress Reed’s destructive Spells. As soon as she saw the man drawing a Star Constellation, she had to react immediately.

However, an enormous monster had suddenly intruded into her Spiritual World. If she did not focus on dealing with the monster, her Spiritual World would crumble within an instant!

“Mind Control: Hallucination!”

The Psychic Mage of the German team turned out to be an expert in putting his target in hallucination...

There were different specialties when it came to the Psychic Element. One of them was the Beastmasters that were quite common in the army. They mainly used their Psychic Element to tame the Heavenly Eagles. These Psychic Mages were usually trained by the military.

The second kind was battle-type Psychic Mages, who focused on suppressing the enemy by preventing them from casting powerful spells. Psychic Mages of this kind was fairly common, and were easily found in the Enforcement Union and the disciplinary teams of renowned clans, since they were particularly useful at taking down Mages!

The third kind was those that were good at using illusions or placing people in a hallucination. They were able to intrude into the minds of their target and dig up their precious memories. They could manipulate sorrow, joy, fear, and panic by affecting their target. It was quite similar to the Curse Element, as the hallucination was like a nightmare aiming to defeat their opponent by crushing their mind!

Jiang Shaoxu was currently facing a Psychic Mage of this kind. Her Spiritual World was in great disorder, as she slowly entered an illusionary world!

To place a person in hallucination, the Psychic Mage would have to numb the senses of the target and manipulate the person’s memory, just so the person would have no clue that they were hallucinating.

Jiang Shaoxu felt like her head was about to explode after the intrusion.

after a tremendous pain, Jiang Shaoxu woke up in a room that she was extremely familiar with. She captured the pleasant scent of flowers coming from outside the window, and the smell of blanket being dried under the sun.

Her blurred vision gradually became clear. She glanced at the familiar, soothing decorations in the room and started to calm down.

Her head was still hurting a little. She rubbed her temple and said, “So I was dreaming... such a long dream, why would I dream that I’m in the middle of a match in Venice, knowing how lazy I am?”

Even though she could recall the training she went through, and the matches she participated in at Venice, the images started to fade away, like she had just woken up from a dream. The room and the sound of kids playing outside the window felt incredibly real to her.

Many people would have a blank mind after waking up from a long dream, as if they had just lived a different life in their dreams. They would slowly recall who they were after their brains rearranged the memory fragments, allowing them to recall what day it was, and what they had done over the past few days...

The images of the battles in Venice gradually faded away. Jiang Shaoxu stood beside her bed and glanced at the grassy land under the sunlight through the window. She saw a person with a gentle smile slowly approaching her.

“Lazybones, are you going to sleep until the sun is high up in the sky? How are you going to become a Mage that can help dad out at this rate?” the person said with a smile, even though he happened to be condemning Jiang Shaoxu.

He reached out his hand and patted Jiang Shaoxu’s head. The woman responded with a displeased glare.

“I’m going somewhere far away tomorrow, pick up your slack when I’m away, understand?” the man said.

“Brother, where are you going this time?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

“Where else would I go?”

“Don’t tell me you’re going to look for some ancient ruins again...”

“Our country has been around for over five thousand years. We used to have an advanced magic civilization that other countries could not compare to. If only we had managed to inherit it from our ancestors, we wouldn’t be falling behind now. The result of our national team a few days ago was pretty disappointing. They were knocked out in the treasure hunt. A few decades ago, the countries that we were up against didn’t even know what magic is. You should work harder, so that during the next World College Tournament... oh, you will only be nineteen by then, you should try and join the national team after the next World College Tournament and win some glory for our country. I’ll be very proud of you,” the man said patiently.

“I’m too lazy to go. Besides, there are so many people in our country, why does it have to be me? Cultivating is so tiring, and I don’t really have the talent, either. Besides, who cares if you’re proud of me or not, is it really worth it for me to train diligently like a monk just so I can make you proud?” Jiang Shaoxu said unwillingly, with the temper of a young girl.

“Fine, do whatever you want; you’re the little princess anyway. Alright, it’s time for me to go and prepare for the trip. The place we’re going to this time is quite complicated. Hopefully, we can find the ancient entrance at Jiayuguan, our operation might actually be recorded in history!” Jiang Shaojun said.

“Do you really enjoy going on expeditions? Isn’t it fine just staying in the cities?”

“What could a...”

“What could a little girl like you possibly know? Brother, can’t you think of some other lines?” Jiang Shaoxu rolled her eyes.

Jiang Shaojun smiled awkwardly. He patted the girl on the head, before turning around and left.

Jiang Shaoxu stared at the man’s back. For some reason, his figure started to fade away under the sunlight. When Jiang Shaoxu took a closer look, the man had already disappeared. There were still some kids playing in the garden, and the birds were still chirping. The flowers had blossomed too, but in Jiang Shaoxu’s eyes, the garden felt empty, sorrowful, with a sense of loss.

——

On the dueling ground of Venice, the sand was sweeping the soulless body of a woman with curly hair in a light red blouse who was standing still like a statue. Her eyes were staring straight ahead, and her dark pupils suddenly shuddering before tears started to pour out. Lines of tears ran down her cheeks, and fell onto the dry sand!

“Jiang Shaoxu, Jiang Shaoxu, wake up, wake up now!” Nanyu shook the tearing Jiang Shaoxu vigorously. She seemed anxious and worried.

The enormous silhouette of the Granite Inferior Dragon was approaching with great pressure. The Granite Inferior Dragon was right before the two girls, and Nanyu was struggling to keep the situation under control on her own.

If Jiang Shaoxu did not wake up soon, she would surely be knocked out!

“Nanyu, leave now!” Ai Jiangtu said to Nanyu.

Jiang Shaoxu had no chance of waking up, as she was completely trapped in the hallucination. The match was extremely important for their country; it was necessary to abandon their teammate for the greater good!

They could only hope that their opponent would go easy on Jiang Shaoxu, and would not inflict serious damage on her!

Nanyu did not want to leave her teammate behind, but as she recalled Chairman Shao Zheng’s words, she forced herself to turn around and flee. Now was not the time to be hesitant.

She had no idea what Jiang Shaoxu was seeing, nor did she know why Jiang Shaoxu was bursting into tears. However, she believed the cunning Psychic Mage of the German team must have forced Jiang Shaoxu to face her greatest pain. Nanyu had never seen the optimistic and casual Jiang Shaoxu wear such a sorrowful expression.

The Granite Inferior Dragon stomped the ground and crushed the final line of defense that Nanyu had left for Jiang Shaoxu into pieces.

The splinters of ice cut Jiang Shaoxu’s face, yet she remained still in tears, as if she could not feel any pain.

The Granite Inferior Dragon reached out its hand and grabbed Jiang Shaoxu, lifting her slowly toward its head.

The Ice Mage from Munich standing on the shoulder of the Granite Inferior Dragon burst out laughing when he saw Jiang Shaoxu’s expression. He yelled at his teammate, “Hey Parker, did you just show her a soap opera? Look at how much she was into it, HAHAHA!”

The Psychic Mage called Parker did not respond.

The tanned Mage laughed and focused his gaze on Jiang Shaoxu, who was being firmly held by the Granite Inferior Dragon.

Suddenly, he realized that the woman’s eyes were not as hollow as he thought. To his surprise, the woman was actually glaring right at him with tearful eyes as soon as he uttered his comment!

The tanned Mage was startled.

“Look out, she has woken up!” the Psychic Mage Parker shouted.
