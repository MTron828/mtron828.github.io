1482 Unspeakable Secrets

Brianca was done fairly quickly. The others had no idea what she was doing. She shook her head at Mo Fan and said, “She was not raped.”

The others immediately realized why Mo Fan was asking for Brianca’s help. To their disbelief, Brianca actually followed his instructions. How unbelievable...

“She was tied up for a long time. In cases like these, it is unlikely for a girl not to be assaulted, especially after seeing how strong the culprit’s hatred was. Assuming the culprit is a man, I find it hard to believe that a guy who is clearly trying to get his revenge wouldn’t take away the second most precious thing from a girl. Oh, some of you might think of it as the most precious thing... anyway, since he didn’t do it, I have a strong feeling that the culprit is a woman,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was from the Clearsky Hunter Agency and had spent too much time around Lingling. He was actually able to deduce simple clues now!

“What are you talking about? How could a girl possibly do something so cruel?” Sheryl said angrily.

“Are you retarded or something? I’ve seen more cruel women than the total number of students in this school!” Mo Fan said disdainfully.

“Mo Fan, even though I agree with your view, I still think it’s possible that the culprit is only trying to get his revenge, without planning to assault the girls sexually?” Mu Bai said.

“Miss Brianca and I went to the mountain at the north gate. We discovered a huge number of dead little creatures. Their blood had yet to permeate the snow, so Miss Brianca immediately used her Wind Domain to scan the area, yet she failed to detect any presence of the culprit. Initially, I assumed the culprit to have an insane cultivation, so he was able to leave the scene quickly. However, now that I think about it, it’s very likely that the culprit went back to the school straight away. There are only a few men in the Alps Institute, and we are all wearing the magic bracelet. There’s no chance we could do something like that without being noticed. If the culprit was a man, he would surely draw someone’s attention when he returned to the school. However, if the culprit was a woman, no one would pay any attention to her,” Mo Fan said.

Brianca recalled the situation at the mountain after hearing Mo Fan’s explanation. It was true that the little creatures had died only moments before they arrived. It was unlikely that her Wind Domain could not detect any trace of the culprit. She even wondered if the culprit was half a Forbidden Mage...

Now that she thought about it, the culprit must have gone back to the school straight away. Mo Fan and Brianca might even have seen the culprit along the way, but since there were quite a lot of students at the north gate, no one had caught their attention...

“Mo Fan, you’re saying that the culprit stayed behind like the brainless bad guys in movies, waiting to be caught by some famous detectives?” Zhao Manyan said.

“You’re the one that’s brainless. The crazy things that the culprit did clearly indicate that she has a strong hatred of the school. She must be hiding in the school still, and this girl clearly isn’t the last victim!” Mo Fan said.

“That’s impossible; we’ve verified the identity of every student in the school. Every outsider that enters the school must wear the magic bracelet, too! The culprit must be an outsider!” the patrolling Maga with thick eyebrows said.

“So sealing off the school wouldn’t make any difference?” Brianca asked.

“Mm, it’s unlikely that the culprit is an outsider. To be honest, not many people can avoid being detected by your Wind Domain too. Besides, judging from the time of the murder, the culprit must have killed the victim in the school too!” Mo Fan said.

Every Super Mage was a reputable person. Most of them would hold important positions, like being a Councilman, a General, a leader of a renowned clan, or a famous teacher in a school.

Even in the Black Vatican, the status of a Super Mage was almost on par with a Red Cardinal!

“Miss Brianca, tell the students not to go anywhere alone,” Mo Fan reminded her.

Brianca was extremely worried too. Her outstanding cultivation was completely useless in a situation like this!

“I think we should keep a close eye on you guys instead. These incidents only happened since you came to our school!” Edith spoke up.

“Idiot!” Mo Fan cursed.

Edith stomped the ground angrily. Sheryl also glared at Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan suspiciously.

Meanwhile, the patrolling Maga with thick brows spoke up, “I believe that’s possible, too. I saw two of them trying to leave the school not long ago.”

Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened. How was that even related to this incident!?

“Stop accusing them without any proof. We should be apologizing to them instead. They have traveled so far to our school, but not only did we fail to live up to our reputation, we still troubled them with such a sorrowful incident,” Ceylan refuted them sincerely.

It was already late at night. When Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai went back to their rooms, Professor Li, Professor Zheng, Li Ximei, and Shi Junsheng ran up to them.

Shi Junsheng said angrily before the two professors could ask about the situation, “Can you guys stop meddling in other people’s business? They are going to treat us like suspects at this rate! I heard that the Alps Institute has never been merciful with their punishments. They even have the right to sentence someone to death right on the spot!”

“Meddling with other people’s business? Do you seriously think your own reputation is more important than finding the culprit who has just killed a student and is going to kill more people soon?” Mo Fan hissed. His impression of Shi Junsheng was completely ruined. He actually found the man slightly annoying!

“Mo Fan, I believe you’re a full-starred Hunter Master, right? We aren’t good with things like this, so can you please lend the Alps Institute a hand on our behalf?” Professor Zheng interjected.

“I’m very disappointed by the school. Shouldn’t they report the incident immediately to the Holy Judgment Court, so they can send an expert over to deal with it? Why do I feel like Headmistress Perry is desperately trying to keep the incident a secret? She even told the students and the other schools that the girl accidentally drowned during the Trial of Faerun Waterfall...” Mu Bai said.

“Mm, she did appoint Brianca to find the culprit within a week, but Brianca is obviously inexperienced in things like this. If the culprit is still in the school, they have no chance of finding her if she’s a little cunning,” Mo Fan said.

“Why didn’t they tell the Holy Judgment Court? A student has died!” Li Ximei said angrily.

Professor Zheng sighed. “Every school has its unspeakable secrets. As a matter of fact, our school also tries to hide the truth at times. It’s necessary to protect the school’s reputation, and let the student study with peace of mind. Even though it might sound like we aren’t treating the students’ safety seriously, we still have to think of the big picture at times. We also try our best to resolve the problems and avoid similar things from happening again.

“The biggest renowned clan in Europe is going to visit this school in a week. It’s obviously very important to the school, even if it’s the Alps Institute... Mo Fan, just do your best to help them find the culprit. I believe it’s a chance for you to earn the Alps Institute’s support. It’s going to be helpful when you are at the Holy Judgment Court later,” Professor Zheng told him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Don’t worry, I won’t just sit and wait for things like this,” Mo Fan agreed.

“How unforgivable is the culprit, daring to treat a young woman so brutally! I, Zhao Manyan, swear to hunt her down, even if it means I won’t be eating meat for the rest of my life!” Zhao Manyan promised.
