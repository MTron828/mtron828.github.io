The gray tower stood firmly in the middle of the long wall, ignoring the clouds and rain. It was hard to tell how many years it had stood here, enduring the rain and wind, to reach its current color.

The wall was still guarded by lots of Magicians. They prayed for daytime to arrive quickly when they heard the bells chiming in the distance.

A rain like this would always delay the arrival of sunlight. Sometimes, some of the Magicians fighting a war would end up not returning because of that small difference in time.

“Everyone is worn out...” Yao Nan sighed.

“How long has this situation lasted?” Mo Fan asked.

“It starts around the end of summer. It’s been quite a few months, but we still haven’t found the real reason,” said Yao Nan.

“We can’t just let it be like this. It’s simply a party for them here every night, while the people have to hide in the city and the Magicians have to guard the walls?” Mo Fan wondered.

The situation here in the Ancient Capital was more terrifying than Mo Fan had imagined. Perhaps even those who had spent a long time living in this city were also living in fear.

“What is it, why the panic?” Advisor Zhu asked a soldier hurrying his way over.

“One of the squads is surrounded by a bunch of skeletons. We have no men left to spare,” said the soldier.

“Whose squad is it?” asked Advisor Zhu.

“It’s Wang Mang’s...”

Advisor Zhu turned his gaze toward Yao Nan and Mo Fan. There were indeed not many people they could send out. The walls were under attack from various directions, while the majority of the army was sent out to eliminate the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. There was no man left to assemble a rescue team.

Besides, a rescue team normally needed to consist of a higher number of stronger Magicians.

“We two basically have no energy left. We’re simply going to die if we go,” said Yao Nan straightforwardly, aware of Advisor Zhu’s intention.

Mo Fan’s energy had yet to recover, too. If he were to jump down the wall now, not only would he be unable to save anyone, he would even put his own life in danger. The same went with Yao Nan; he did still have some energy left, yet he had not recovered from the injuries he suffered when fighting against the Corpse Official. There was nothing he could do, either.

“Ask them to hold on for awhile, it’s almost daytime,” Advisor Zhu sighed.

“Affirmative,” said the soldier nodded.

——

The squad under Wang Mang’s lead that the soldier mentioned was actually not too far away from the walls. For someone like Mo Fan, who was able to see in the dark, he could see an area covered in white dots in the distance from up on the walls.

The white dots were the skeletons. A huge area of white dots simply meant the place was overrun by skeletal creatures. The occasional flicker of light in the distance simply implied that the squad was fighting back stubbornly.

When Mo Fan’s gaze was fixed on the area, a cheer of joy came from a different direction.

Yao Nan immediately glanced in that direction too. When he saw white rays rising into the sky, he immediately smiled, “They did it!”

“Who?” asked Mo Fan.

“The Phantom Tyrant Emperor is eliminated! Our army is withdrawing back to the walls!” Advisor Zhu’s anxious face finally smiled for once. It was obvious that he hd been deeply worried about it for the entire night.

After all, they had sent quite a number of Super Level Magicians out. If something were to happen to them, the northern walls would be in serious trouble!

The white rays gradually drew closer to the walls. As soon as the Phantom Tyrant Emperor died, the undead completely lost their backing. The Commander-level undead no longer posed any threat, especially when Super Magicians were free to lend a hand, too...

“Nice, great job, well done!” yelled Advisor Zhu when he saw the army making their way back to the walls.

The Commanders in charge of guarding the walls danced for joy too. For the past month and more, they had always been on their toes because of the Phantom Tyrant Emperor. The vicious undead were the greatest threat to the northern walls. They had almost made a huge hole in the walls a few times.

Now that the threat was finally eliminated, the soldiers in charge of guarding the northern walls were relieved.

Dull clouds gathered in the east. Sunlight came late, as expected, but the people on the northern walls were cheering loudly, to welcome the new day, and also to welcome the heroes returning from their victory...

Magicians gradually arrived at the walls. Some that were quicker had even returned to the tower.

A man with a pair of fiery wings on his back swept past the sky in the rain, leaving a long trail of fire behind, like a burning meteorite!

The fiery wings beat rapidly as the figure headed for the walls quickly. Even though the person was covered in wounds, it did not take away any of his authority and pride. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Mo Fan recognized the fiery wings. It was none other than Councilman Zhu Meng!

His fiery wings lit up the gray tower. He landed on the tower, a heat wave sweeping over the crowd. While his beard was still drifting in the wind, he had already landed stably in front of Advisor Zhu and the rest of the Commanders...

“Where’s my superior; don’t tell me he sacrificed himself?” Yao Nan asked immediately when he saw Zhu Meng.

“He did survive, but the question is when he’s able to rise from bed. That guy is totally out of his mind... but without his risky move, it’s likely that the Phantom Tyrant Emperor would have escaped safely!” Zhu Meng panted heavily trying to catch his breath. When he caught a glimpse of Mo Fan, he immediately wore a frown and snapped, “Did this kid desert his squad? He’s definitely going to suffer the consequences if he’s a soldier!”

“The number of undead I killed is higher than the Magicians that you’ve gathered today!” said Mo Fan unpleasantly.

“He did great today, helping me kill a Corpse Official,” Yao Nan complimented Mo Fan for once.

“Humph, that sounds more like it!” Zhu Meng nodded and glanced into the distance, “The others will be back eventually. The casualties aren’t too terrible this time. It’s our victory!”

“Councilman, you should go and rest. Your injuries aren’t light, either,” Advisor Zhu sent a Battlemaga over to take care of the Councilman.

The Battlemaga was obviously a Healer, wearing a white robe. She escorted Councilman Zhu Meng to the third floor to rest up.

Zhu Meng noticed the area covered in white dots in the distance. He pointed at the area and asked, “What’s going on there? Is someone trapped?”

“Yeah, it’s a small squad. They are surrounded by the skeletons, but it will be daytime soon. It won’t be a huge problem,” said Advisor Zhu.

Zhu Meng studied the sky and realized that the sunlight was indeed poking out from the gray clouds. It would be daytime by the time he could reach the squad. He decided to take care of his wounds instead, since it was impossible to tell what else they might encounter the following night. He had to recover from the injuries as soon as possible, since he was still needed to protect the northern walls.
