The Hall Mother had never thought Izisha would wake up from the cold coffin. She felt uneasy looking at the woman, whose face did not change even the slightest.

Izisha was a scary woman. The Hall Mother had watched her grown up, from a gentle, innocent young girl into what she was now. The Hall Mother was struggling to adapt to her change. She was terrified by the decisions that Izisha had made in the past. Now that she had woken up again, it would surely draw the Parthenon Temple into a terrifying game of political power.

“I’m just taking back what should have been mine long ago. Look at that girl; no vision, no wisdom, no courage! If we continue to let her hold onto the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, the Parthenon Temple would soon be a laughingstock to the world. Is that what you want?” Izisha said without any emotion.

She had a strong disdain for anyone originating from her very bones, including the indecisive Hall Mother.

The Parthenon Temple would not do well without a Goddess. It could not afford to lose the Spell of Resurrection, either. The Hall Mother naively thought she could elect Ye Xinxia as the Goddess, but could the girl really take on the role with her delicate looks and merciful heart?

What a joke! If the Parthenon Temple only relied on being merciful, it would have long been wiped out by the Tyrant Titans and other factions that eyed them covetously. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Once I claim the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, this crisis will come to an end. I’m not the one you should be convincing now, but the guy who naively thought he could take on the Holy Judgment Court and the Parthenon Temple. He is using an evil power that does not belong to this world. Ye Xinxia might be innocent, but you knew it was inevitable! As for the man with the evil power, he will eventually be taken out by the Heresy Judgment Mages!” Izisha declared.

“Perhaps you should put more attention on the Black Vatican, they already...” the Hall Mother said.

“Salan is nothing but a buffoon. The people of the Black Vatican have infiltrated the Parthenon Temple under your watch. It seems like it’s time for you to retire, too!” Izisha stated.

Izisha was blatantly forcing the Hall Mother to quit. The Hall Mother was startled, yet she could not do anything about it. She could easily tell how many people were supporting Izisha by the great conspiracy that was taking place. Even the Holy Judgment Court was under her influence...

She could easily take out anyone she pleased with the power of the Holy Judgment Court. The Holy Judgment Court focused on authorities and powerful Mages. Once Izisha successfully claimed the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, it meant she could take out or resurrect any person as she wished. Who could possibly stand against her?

=So this was what Izisha was aiming for all along!-

Her methods were as cruel and intimidating as usual!

“I...I just hope that you will think about the people more. Hayla’s power is already corroding the city. The people are overwhelmed with fear. They are starting to feel suspicious. It will greatly affect your influence,” the Hall Mother said.

Izisha did not respond. She glanced down at the Citadel of Athens and Mo Fan, the one who possessed the power of the demon!

She was sensitive towards any power that could threaten her. Mo Fan’s power had clearly caught her attention. The guy could face Hayla head-on. If she could not recruit him to her side, she would have to take him out!

She had no intention of putting a stop to the mess involving Mo Fan and Xinxia. Hayla would be the best weapon she had to eliminate anyone that opposed her. As for the fears of the city and the panicking people, she could easily comfort them once it was over. Most people were clueless, forgetful, and easily manipulated...

—

Lightning burst out of Mo Fan. Spears made of countless lightning arcs punctured Hayla’s chest once again. The lightning spears summoned a great storm that descended upon the place.

However, the Dark Undying Worms soon made a piercing and unpleasant sound. They spread out and devoured the debris nearby to fill up the wounds that had been inflicted on Hayla...

It seemed like they had started to run out of things to eat in the Dark Execution Ground. The Dark Undying Worms flew out of the barrier and turned into rapid-moving clouds that devoured everything they came into contact with.

The plants in the parks disappeared, the buildings on the streets vanished, the vehicles on the roads were gone, too. There was nothing they could not eat. The area within a kilometer of the Dark Execution Ground turned into barren land...

The people and the Mages inside the safety barrier were petrified.

Didn’t they say the creature could not leave the Dark Execution Ground? Why were the Dark Undying Worms able to leave the Dark Execution Ground and feast on the things outside? It was terrifying how the city was turned into empty land in an instant!

The Dark Undying Worms were not just targeting the city. The sacred mountain had fallen victim to the Dark Undying Worms too. The Dark Undying Worms seemed more interested in living things than plants and buildings. They went straight for the people on the sacred mountain!

The Hall of Faith and the Ten Thousand Stairs were not protected. Apart from the armed forces of the Parthenon Temple, there were still believers that had not been evacuated on the sacred mountain. The clouds of Dark Undying Worms in the form of clouds swept past, turning the believers into skeletons in the blink of an eye.

The rest of the people were dumbfounded by the sight of the skeletons scattered across the Ten Thousand Stairs.

“Run, quick!”

“Why would the Holy Judgment Court Summon such a monster!?”

The sacred mountain was in a huge mess. The Mages of Faith initially thought they could fend off the Dark Undying Worms with their spells. However, they were soon devoured and turned into a pile of bones, just like the rest of the people!

—

“Izisha!” the Hall Mother yelled.

Izisha remained emotionless. She was quite surprised that Hayla had started to devour the city and the people to strengthen itself, yet she had no plan to send the creature away.

The demon was not dead, and Ye Xinxia was still alive. As long as she had not claimed the Soul of the Parthenon Temple, the battle would not stop!

The Hall Mother knew how cold-blooded Izisha was. She did not stay any longer, since it was meaningless to try and convince Izisha. She immediately assembled the people of the Hall of Judgment and the Hall of Knights to defend the sacred mountain from the Dark Undying Worms. Otherwise, the sacred mountain would turn into a mountain of skeletons!
