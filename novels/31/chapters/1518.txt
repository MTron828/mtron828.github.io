“My goods, my goods!” the merchant screamed.

Half of the Camel Beasts were carrying the merchant’s goods. They were mainly supplies high in demand when a city was at war. He could have sold them for a good price, but the Camel Beasts at the back of the convoy seemed to be paralyzed by the Lesser Medusae’s poison. They gradually slowed down and eventually fell to the ground stiffly, panting heavily.

Even though the Lesser Medusae were not interested in the Camel Beasts, they had no reason to reject meat that was right before them. They wrapped around the Camel Beasts and devoured them quickly!

A Camel Beast was the size of a jeep, yet these Black Medusae could still swallow them whole given how large they were. Many travelers in the convoy fainted at the ghastly sight, their bodies hanging limply on the back of the Camel Beasts!

“Quick, don’t even bother saving the goods!” The leader of the mercenaries decisively led everyone up the ravine after making sure that no one was left behind.

A simple line of defense was stacked up with rocks at the top of the ravine. It was a sign to the Camel Beasts that they had almost reached safety. They immediately tried harder to reach the top!

“Are you all idiots? Cairo is already off-limits, but not only did you come here without permission, you even brought a whole Medusa Mountain here! I swear I’m going to execute you all right now!” a man in a military jacket yelled angrily.

The man was a general with badges on his shoulder. Cairo was already in such a mess, yet these black-hearted merchants were still trying to make a fortune from it. Meanwhile, they had to deal with the Medusae that were attracted here!

“We’ve already entered the city. It’s your duty to protect us!” the merchant shot back in reply.

The Egyptian general was furious, yet he had no choice but to raise his hand to signal his men to cast their Ice Magic!

The soldiers stationed along this part of the line of defense were mostly Ice Mages. When they cast their Ice Magic simultaneously, the whole ravine was covered in frost, the ice soon reaching more than a meter high!

The Black Medusae were afraid of Ice Magic, as they were unable to maintain their body temperature in icy places. They could freeze to death very easily!

Snow fell rapidly as a cold wind blew fiercely. The Lesser Medusae did not dare cross the ravine lightly. They could only hold their bodies up and stare at the humans on the other side viciously!

“Thank God, we are safe now!” Halla let out a relieved sigh and fell to the ground feebly.

“My goods!” the merchant cried. He had lost half of his cargo. They were more valuable than a person’s life. He had put in so much effort to transport them here, yet the rest of the goods remaining would only give him a small profit!

“You’re still thinking about the goods? You should be relieved that you are still alive!” Sofia scoffed at the self-seeking merchant.

Mo Fan turned around and looked at the Black Medusae that had not left yet. He then glanced at Chad, the leader of the mercenaries.

Mo Fan had to admit that the man’s decision had saved many people’s lives. Most of the people in the convoy did not know how to use magic. It would be difficult to guarantee everyone’s safety, unless he was a Super Mage like Brianca. The Medusa Mountain was composed of too many Lesser Medusae, especially the ones colored dark red. Not only was their poison deadly, there were superior Commander-level creatures too! They posed too much of a threat to the convoy!

While everyone was recovering from the shock, a few cries were heard coming from the other side of the ravine.

Chad was about to leave, and suddenly came to a halt. He turned around and saw a horned beast among the Lesser Medusae. Not only was it covered in blood, the Black Medusae were hanging all over it!

The Steel-Horned Beast was very tenacious. Its outer shell had already been torn away by the demon creatures, yet it was still heading toward the ravine with all its might, leaving a long trail of blood behind.

“Pierce!” the old captain cried out in disbelief. His body was trembling.

He had thought his Contracted Beast was long dead. No living creature could possibly survive after being surrounded by the Medusae. When he took a closer look, he noticed that the vicious Black Medusae could have easily ended the Steel-Horned Beast’s life, yet they were slowly tearing its meat off one bite at a time, torturing the pitiful Summoned Beast!

They would let it run before catching up to it and bite it a few times again. They would then let it run for a while again before surrounding it to make fun of it...

Chad could accept it if his Contracted Beast had died right away, but when he saw the Contracted Beast that he used to fight side-by-side with being tortured by the Black Medusae, he completely lost his mind!

“Assh***! I’ll kill all of you!” Chad yelled furiously.

Chad jumped over the wall and ran forward. The densely-clustered Black Medusae were no longer as intimidating as they were before. He could not abandon his Contracted Beast and just watch it being tortured!

“Captain, don’t!”

“Captain, you are going to get yourself killed, we’ve already completed our mission!...”

The others quickly came over to stop their leader when they saw him running at the demon creatures recklessly. However, they were still too slow. Chad had already reached the bottom of the ravine. He continued to charge toward the Lesser Medusae without any hesitation!

“He’s mad, he’s out of his mind. He could have just spent some money and bought another Contracted Beast... whatever, if he’s dead, I won’t have to pay as much now...” The merchant struggled to understand Chad’s behavior.

The others looked at the stubborn man speechlessly.

He was going to get himself killed for sure. Even the army would not dare to charge straight into the Medusae...

“Someone, stop him!” a mercenary under Chad’s lead begged.

“Mo Fan is already doing it,” Zhao Manyan said.

“That’s great, he must stop the captain!”

—

At the bottom of the ravine, Chad was just about to make his way up the slope when a black figure showed up in front of him and blocked his path.

“You are going to get yourself killed,” Mo Fan told Chad.

“I’ve already escorted you all to safety. What I do next is none of your business, move aside!” Chad yelled at Mo Fan with bloodshot eyes.

Mo Fan did not waste any time with Chad. His eyes flickered as a silver energy burst out of them. A strong telekinetic force collided with Chad and sent him flying.

Chad was knocked into the air and landed back in the safe zone.

The mercenaries were well aware of their captain’s temper. They quickly went up to him and pulled him down, not giving him any chance to do anything stupid!

“Student, come up here, it’s too dangerous down there!” Vani kindly reminded Mo Fan. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan did not go up. He turned around and stared at the Black Medusae that were poking their heads up over the edge of the ravine. The opening was fully blocked off by the terrifying demon creatures, yet he remained in his spot fearlessly.

“You are too weak, so you will only get yourself killed if you go. I’ll save it on your behalf, considering how you’ve done your best to fulfill your duty...” Mo Fan’s dark coat flapped wildly in the wind. The deafening clap of the Lightning Tyrant had yet to come, but a dangerous aura far superior to anything nearby had already surged across the place!

It was common to hire mercenaries to protect people. Mo Fan remembered how they had barely escorted the people on the plane to safety at the airport in New Suez, even when they had Brianca’s help. The situation they went through today was clearly a lot more dangerous than back then. Even they and the students of the European University Institute joining hands together would struggle to guarantee everyone’s safety...

But an Intermediate Mage had done it by sacrificing his Contracted Beast to buy enough time for the weaker people to reach safety!

The man was truly an impressive mercenary. Even though his decision was extremely cruel to his Contracted Beast, he had fulfilled his duty without leaving anyone behind. He made sure that everyone could reach Cairo safely. He deserved their respect!

There were some people that Mo Fan would feel deep veneration for, not because they were from a reputable school or a renowned clan, but how they were willing to stick to their principles and duty despite the great struggles they had in life...

“Lightning Realm!”

Thick black bolts of lightning fell from the sky at Mo Fan’s command, forming lightning arcs that sparked as they cut jagged paths through the air. There were more than a dozen of them, descending from beyond their range of vision.

The lightning did not just come and go. It stayed close to Mo Fan, like dark dragons protecting their emperor.

As Mo Fan started toward the Lesser Medusae, the lightning arcs followed him. They swept across the ground, leaving scorched gouges behind...

The eyes of the Black Medusae widened as they watched the human that was not enough to fill the gaps between their fangs approaching them. A few young Black Medusae immediately stirred up black winds and pounced at Mo Fan fearlessly!

Their black bodies were instantly disintegrated into bloodspray, scattering across the ground as soon as they made contact with the lightning.

The Battlemages in the safe zone gasped when they saw the shocking number of Black Medusae lunging at Mo Fan, but in just a second, they were disintegrated by Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant Domain, their blood splattering on the ground close to Mo Fan. The whole place was painted a bright shocking red!

“My man!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed as he watched Mo Fan, who was as imperious as any demon!

The lightning with twelvefold damage amplification could even kill the Warrior-level Black Medusae instantly. The students of the European University Institute were in utter disbelief after witnessing Mo Fan’s magic, especially Ferrero, who had no idea the country bumpkin possessed such terrifying strength!
