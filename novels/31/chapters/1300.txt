1302 Opposing Species

The lightning lit up Shao Ru’s pale face. She stared at the man who had appeared out of nowhere in astonishment.

“You’re...” Shao Ru was a little furious. She did not want anyone to die for her again!

However, as the lightning grew stronger, Shao Ru forgot what she was trying to say. She saw the two lightning beams crossing paths in front of the Bronze-Fang Hillman. A lightning strike soared up into the sky like a dragon before it was set off like a huge explosion. Its overwhelming force instantly destroyed the Bronze-Fang Hillman’s sturdy skin!

Blood and flesh flew scattered in the air. Even the Bronze-Fang Hillman’s outstanding defense failed to protect it from the lightning explosion. The overwhelming force knocked the Bronze-Fang Hillman flying before it slammed heavily into the tall grass nearby. The lightning explosion razed the tall grass to the ground, clearing a huge area.

The lightning arcs were still flickering on the Bronze-Fang Hillman. The creature was struggling to rise to its feet. The attack had obviously inflicted serious damage on it.

Shao Ru looked at the Bronze-Fang Hillman in disbelief. She slowly shifted her gaze back to Mo Fan!

Mo Fan realized the woman had attractive eyes. Even when they were filled with astonishment, they had a different charm than their usual cold look.

“Were you trying to say that I’m too naive?” Mo Fan smiled.

Shao Ru was so shocked that she even forgot to close her mouth. It was mainly because he looked so young. She could hardly imagine anyone at his age possessing such ridiculous strength!

Who would ever think that such an ordinary-looking young man was able to inflict serious damage on a Commander-level with a single Lightning Spell?

“Let’s go up the tree. A whole bunch of them are going to show up soon,” Mo Fan told her.

Shao Ru nodded after she finally recovered her wits.

“Let me help you,” Mo Fan wrapped his hand around the woman’s waist when he saw she was struggling to move on her own. The woman’s waist was crazily slim. It was rare to see a woman as slim as her with such a stunning bust. Her figure was absolutely insane. Mo Fan believed he would be having a boner if it wasn’t for the excessive blood and gore he had witnessed lately...

Mo Fan transformed into a Shadow Bird and brought Shao Ru up the trunk.

——

As Mo Fan thought, the Bronze-Fang Hillman started crying for help to hunt them down.

Mo Fan had fully recovered from his injuries, and was able to fully utilize his Shadow Element. In addition, he was not surrounded by the Hillmen. They would have trouble finding him, no matter how quick they were able to climb the tree.

The first glimpse of light had risen in the horizon, dying the clouds blazing red. It was a little eerie to look at.

Mo Fan found a safe spot and placed Shao Ru down so she could rest. After all, she was seriously injured. Her condition would worsen if she moved excessively.

“I was running short on time just then. Here, let me treat your wound,” Mo Fan took a few leaves and placed them down for Shao Ru to lie on.

The leaves were huge. He could easily turn them into a mattress by stacking them together. Mo Fan knelt down beside Shao Ru’s leg and tore her pants that were little more than dangling cloth, revealing her injured leg.

It was Mo Fan’s first time using such a rough approach. The pants were easier to rip off than he had imagined. He tore the pants all the way up to Shao Ru’s waist. He could vaguely see her black lace underwear in the gap. The part of Shao Ru’s quad that was not injured was whiter and tender, too.

It was not Mo Fan’s first time being a pervert. He pretended to be treating the wound without moving his gaze away. He even explained the special uses of the ointment as he was applying it to the wound. He did not give Shao Ru any chance to feel embarrassed!

A man who was placing his full attention on the task of hand would be less likely to be regarded as someone with malicious thoughts, especially when he was showing an indifferent attitude, like a doctor treating a patient. Even if he did take advantage of a girl, she would most likely just accept it. Mo Fan was extremely experienced with his approach. He saw all he wanted to see without making the girl feel uncomfortable!

“I’ll do it myself,” Shao Ru interrupted when she saw Mo Fan was going to treat the wound on her chest.

Mo Fan was pretty interested in seeing how her slim waist was able to support her huge bust. Unfortunately, the woman was reluctant to give him the chance to do so.

“Are you a Hunter, too?” Mo Fan asked.

Shao Ru briefly explained her situation to Mo Fan. He was quite surprised after hearing her. It turned out that she was an elite Sound Maga whom the government had asked for help, but her team ended up being set up by the Hillmen!

“The number of Hillmen is a lot higher than we thought,” Shao Ru admitted.

“I already warned the government to be extremely cautious!” Mo Fan sighed. He was hoping the same fate did not befall the other teams. Otherwise, the representatives of the government, the military, the Magic Association, and the Hunters would all be wiped out here!

“You’re Mo Fan? The strongest participant in the World College Tournament?” Shao Ru observed Mo Fan closely.

“Yeah,” Mo Fan nodded.

There were too many people with the name Mo Fan around. As such, most people he met would not think too much whenever he told them his name.

“No wonder... let’s have a duel some time,” Shao Ru said.

“...” Mo Fan was left speechless. What the heck was she even thinking!?

“Do you think I’m not worthy to be your opponent?” Shao Ru frowned. She looked down and harrumphed, “There’s no way I would end up like this if I wasn’t taken by surprise.”

“Just rest up for now,” Mo Fan said helplessly.

The injures that Shao Ru had suffered were not deadly, but she had lost too much blood from the bleeding. Mo Fan’s medicine was very effective. The woman was able to recover pretty quickly.

——

Mo Fan brought her higher up the tree to regroup with the others.

Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened when he saw Mo Fan returning with a beautiful woman. However, when he recovered from the shock of seeing Shao Ru, he put on a wry smile and said, “Mo Fan, how many women are you thinking of bringing with us?”

Mo Fan also realized it was a little crazy when Shao Ru joined the other girls.

Chen Yi, Lingling, Guan Xixi, Lan Luo, Liu Xiaojia, Shao Ru... the two of them had to look after six women. How ‘frightening’!

“I went down to take a look around. The direction the sun rose has the least number of Hillmen. The other places are all crowded with them. There should be around three or four thousand of them. According to Shao Ru, there were a few thousand Hillmen in the sea of grass too, which means their number is above five thousand!” Mo Fan said.

“Five thousand... it’s pretty much a horde!” Lingling exclaimed.

The Hillmen were a Warrior-level species. The combined strength of five thousand Hillmen was obviously a lot greater than a horde of Servant-class creatures. It was obvious that the government’s plan had gone south this time.

“We have to take out the leaders of the Hillmen to weaken them so the government and the military can take them all out at once,” Shao Ru said.

She had learned from the experience that the higher the level of the Hillmen, the smarter they were. Therefore, taking out their leaders was the best way to crush their teamwork. If the Hillmen were united, the humans would still pay a huge price, even if they managed to defeat them!

“One more thing; the Bronze-Fang Hillmen are very cunning! They prefer to sacrifice the lives of their underlings. They won’t involve themselves in a battle unless it’s necessary. The Bronze-Fang Hillmen cherish their lives. They are well aware that there are powerful Mages among us!” Lingling said.

Mo Fan could easily relate to what Lingling had just said. It was exactly what the cunning Bronze-Fang Hillman that had ambushed him did!

“Should we try and use the other species on the tree, then? I believe some of the creatures living on the tree are quite strong,” Zhao Manyan suggested.

“It wouldn’t work. If the Hillmen are able to occupy the roots, it means the Giant Purple Sacred Linden has permitted them to stay. Didn’t you see the Four-Lives Salamander Tiger wouldn’t target creatures outside its territory? It feels like they have some sort of agreement regarding their territories,” Lingling said.

It was difficult to get two species to fight one another unless they were each other’s natural enemies.

“Strange! I heard the old people mentioned that the Giant Purple Linden only allows gentle species to stay around it. If this Giant Purple Sacred Linden has been around for a long time, it doesn’t make sense that it would allow an aggressive species like the Hillmen to set up their territory here,” Chen Yi said, confused. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Do you know what the ruler of the outer Mount Kunyu before was?” Lingling asked.

Chen Yi shook her head and said, “I only knew it was a less aggressive species. It doesn’t really pose any threat to Yantai. My grandmother even told me that the ruler of outer Mount Kunyu was actually protecting Yantai...”

“Isn’t it something that only a Totem Beast would do?” Zhao Manyan said.

“Was the ruler that died a Totem Beast?”

“I can’t say for sure, but it’s possible...” Lingling said.

“Now that you mention it, it reminds me of something. When I was attacked by the Bronze-Fang Hillman, a bunch of birds with colorful tails showed up when the Bronze-Fang Hillman almost caught up to me. I barely escaped because they were keeping the Bronze-Fang Hillman busy for a while,” Shao Ru exclaimed.

“Birds with colorful tails... we haven’t seen anything like them. We only saw a bunch of unfriendly shameless demon sparrows,” Liu Xiaojia said.

“Why were they helping you?”

“I don’t know, I thought they were just hostile toward the Hillmen...”

“That must be it. Look at the trees in the distance!” Lingling pointed in the direction of the rising sun as she discovered something.

The sunlight sprayed across the top of the dense trees, and the sound of birds singing and chirping was heard. Not long afterwards, birds with multi-colored tails started to appear and weave through the branches above the layer occupied by the Four-Lives Salamander Tiger.

“It seems they are lining up to dive from the tree...” Zhao Manyan observed.

“It explains why there aren’t many Hillmen in this direction. It’s likely they are enemies with the Hillmen!” Mo Fan deduced excitedly.
