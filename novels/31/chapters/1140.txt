Five Servant-class Soul Essences were enough to refine a Warrior-level Soul Essence.

Even though the Dark Red Mummies were only dropping Servant-class Soul Remnants and Soul Essences, Mo Fan still ended up earning quite a fortune from them!

Forty-nine Stars of the Lightning Element were strengthened, Mo Fan was excited to see the Stars brimming with new energy.

Drawing a Star Pattern no longer cost much of Mo Fan’s energy. His Galaxy could recover the energy in no time. It would be perfect if he could equip some kind of magical gear that would speed up his energy recovery. He would be able to cast as many Intermediate Spells as he pleased!

When a Mage was drawing a Star Pattern, their energy would only be expended when the Mage aligned the Stars. Moving a Star would cost a certain amount of energy, but the energy required to move a level four and a level five Star was the same...

A Spell as strong as an Advanced Spell, but with the time and energy required to cast an Intermediate Spell; how shocking was that?

“Take some rest, I’ll handle these undead,” Mo Fan withdrew instead of pushing any further, regrouping with his team.

Mu Nujiao, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and Guan Yu were under great pressure. Unlike Mo Fan, none of them had upgraded their Basic or Intermediate Spells, meaning that they had to rely on Advanced Spells to kill a group of undead. However, their energy was almost depleted after casting the Advanced Spells too frequently. Most importantly, when they were under great pressure, it was easier for them to get tired, meaning that they would be slower at drawing the Star Constellations, and it was easier to make a mistake. Whenever they made a mistake, they would lose energy, even when the spell was not completed, placing them in a difficult position...

They finally realized how the undead had worn out the English team and the Greek team!

“Is there even a point for us to continue fighting? We should be complaining to the officials instead!” Guan Yu lost his temper.

“I’m really speechless. If those scumbags of the Egyptian team dare to fight us face-to-face, I swear I’ll beat the crap out of them!” Zhao Manyan also cursed.

“It’s really nothing. If you ever saw a horde or kingdom of demon creatures, it’s a lot worse than this,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s different! We’ll send out an army against a horde or a kingdom of demon creatures, but there are only five of us against so many undead, what the heck are we supposed to do?” Jiang Yu was losing his patience too.

“That’s why I’m asking you to back off and take a rest, I’ll hold them off for now,” Mo Fan said.

“You?” Guan Yu looked at Mo Fan doubtfully and said with a cold harrumph, “Mo Fan, we all know how good you are, and you’re not scared of being surrounded, but you have to know you were only facing the undead Summoned by two people. If we all back away and leave you here, you will have to face the undead Summoned by five people. Do you really think you are a Super Mage?”

“Mo Fan, don’t force yourself. If your energy depletes, there’s no way we’re going to win the match. We might be grumbling, but we can still hold on,” Jiang Yu agreed.

Mu Nujiao and Zhao Manyan nodded. These weak undead did not pose any threat to Mo Fan, but if Mo Fan was unable to kill them faster than they were spawning and had to rely on his Advanced Spells, he would be worn out eventually too, meaning that the Egyptian team would still win the match!

“Don’t worry, I will only use Advanced Spells as the last resort. Zhao Manyan, set up some hills as barricades and rest up with the others. Leave them to me!” Mo Fan declared.

——

The others did not say anything further after Mo Fan insisted on it.

Zhao Manyan set up a maze with hills before the new batch of undead arrived. The undead would have to take a detour to reach them, and if someone was holding the undead at the front, it would lift the pressure from the people at the back. It was the perfect move against the brainless undead!

The team withdrew to the hills and glanced down from above. They were interested to see how Mo Fan was going to hold the tide of undead off.

“They are coming!” Mu Nujiao had an urge to set up her plants to lend Mo Fan a hand, beginning to feel uneasy.

“Holy crap, they have been stacking the undead and sending them in one go. Can Mo Fan really stop them?”

“There are so many Death Axes Mummies. Sh*t, even an army isn’t enough to wipe them all out!”

The tide of undead had grown into an army. The throbbing, dark red dots had devoured half of the island like a huge wave, and was spreading rapidly to the other half!

——

The people watching the match on the cruises inhaled deeply!

The island was crawling with undead. How remarkable were the talents of the Egyptian team, to Summon an entire army of undead? How could the Chinese team possibly stand a chance?

“Are the members of the Chinese team out of their minds? They have all gone to rest, leaving Mo Fan to defend on his own?”

“Just surrender! They should just forfeit the match, it’s meaningless!”

—

Neferu of the Egyptian team saw Mo Fan standing in front of his team, while the rest did not seem to be doing anything. He could not help but grin as he stood above an enormous undead creature.

If Mo Fan could really stop the undead that the five of them had Summoned, he would rather eat all the mummies alive. How arrogant and naive was the man, to think that he actually stood a chance against an army of undead?

Did he seriously think he was the strongest in the tournament just because he had defeated Zorro? Even if he was, he was still nothing against their army of undead!

Neferu glanced down at the army of thousands of undead like a general.

“Take him out!” As soon as Neferu waved his hand, the undead immediately charged forward menacingly.

Mo Fan lifted his gaze and saw the undead pouncing at him like a rain of arrows, blocking his vision. Behind these vanguard mummies were thousands of undead, like horses galloping across a battlefield. The presence of the dead they were emitting was strong enough to form a huge cloud!

—

On top of the hills, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and Mu Nujiao could feel their legs trembling after seeing how terrifying the army of undead was.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan remained still, as if he was watching a colony of ants moving houses. There was no sign of fear or panic on his face, but excitement!

“The undead he saw at the Ancient Capital might have been at least a hundred times worse than this,” Zhao Manyan murmured.

During the Calamity of the Ancient Capital, the city was surrounded by millions of undead. If anyone stood on the city walls and looked into the distance, their entire view would be filled up with undead, like a scene of the apocalypse.

In comparison, this army of thousands of undead was less than the number of undead he had encountered in the Death Space. Why would he be scared, considering how strong he was now?

They were just a bunch of gold coins waiting to fly into his pocket!

“Come, it’s been a while since I’ve had so much fun killing!” Mo Fan grinned, staring at the army of undead, like a candle that was being doused with fuel!

He pointed at the sky. Lightning bolts started to flicker wildly in the sky, and arcs of lightning intertwined in the air. They either swept across the sky, landed on the ground, or forked into smaller lightning arcs!

The chains of lightning spread rapidly. The spell had obviously inherited the effects of the fourth-tier Lightning Disaster. The lightning arcs were traveling between the undead in straight lines, killing every single Dark Red Mummy they struck. Some were in the form of webs, disintegrating the undead for twenty meters around into blood droplets. Some simply surged wildly across the place without any specific pattern!

Drawing a Star Pattern with a single thought!

After Mo Fan’s mental strength improved, it only took him a single thought to cast an Intermediate Spell. The lightning arcs spreading among hundreds of mummies were from a single Intermediate Spell that took just a second to be cast!

“Lightning Tyrant: Thunderbolt: Chain Lightning!”

With a single point of his finger and a wave of his arm, the vanguard undead were struck by the lightning arcs. The electricity mowed through them before they could reach Mo Fan, and they were falling to the ground like the grains during a harvest!

“Go, take him down!” Neferu shouted, ordering the undead to surround Mo Fan!

A thicker lightning bolt descended from the ground and landed right on Mo Fan, and the Chain Lightning scattered like a spider’s web. The undead that finally got close to Mo Fan were all killed in an instant!

Mo Fan was extremely quick at casting the spells. Chain Lightning was useful at taking down multiple targets. Those that were struck by the main lightning arcs were basically dead, while those that were struck by the lightning arcs that forked off from the main ones lost their limbs.

“Humph, he still ends up being surrounded, the man is too full of himself!” Neferu burst out laughing.

It did not matter how fast the lightning arcs were, as they were still slower than the undead that were stacking up around Mo Fan. These undead were like copper walls and iron bastions!

The space that Mo Fan could move in was limited. A Death Axes Mummy was approaching him, too. However, he still showed no intention of casting an Advanced Spell. His lips curled up into a grin as he glanced at the Lightning Tyrant Scars on the surrounding undead.

“Tyrant...Call!”

His smile was incredibly smug, while his eyes were full of disdain. A stormy cloud loomed over the Lightning Tyrant Domain, and yellow lightning bolts of judgment descended rapidly, like thousands of dragons dancing and flickering wildly in the air. It felt like the island was about to collapse at any second!

Even the weakest lightning arc still left a Lightning Tyrant Scar on the undead. The main lightning arc of a chain could hit a few dozen undead, while forking into several lightning arcs. It did not matter if the main lightning chain was not quick enough at killing the undead, as the lightning arcs that forked off would also stack up Lightning Tyrant Scars on the undead!

Mo Fan waited for the undead to get closer to him before activating their Scars with the Tyrant Call! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Countless Lightning Tyrant Scars flared to life. The lightning that the Tyrant Call Summoned was like the tribulation a cultivator would trigger. Even the spectators on the cruises were utterly dumbfounded.

“Die!”

In terms of dominance, Mo Fan was like an emperor! The lightning surged around him, taking out thousands of enemies after he uttered a single word!

Each of the lightning strikes that the Tyrant Call had summoned was as strong as Thunderbolt: Exploding Apex, and together with the amplification of the Lightning Tyrant, the Dark Red Mummies had no chance of withstanding them. They disappeared together with their Lightning Tyrant Scars!

Thousands of undead were slaughtered in an instant. Mo Fan stood on the spacious field, lightning flickering along its surface. His aura was absolutely shocking!

The people had finally witnessed the true strength of a Lightning Mage, one who was capable of summoning thousands of lightning arcs to destroy an entire army of undead with a single thought!

“Perfect!” Mo Fan’s smile widened when he saw the undead were all destroyed.

The fifth-tier Thunderbolt that he had acquired by spending forty-nine Warrior-level Soul Essences had worked perfectly with the Tyrant Call, giving Mo Fan the ability to survive even if he was up against an entire horde of demon creatures in the future!

Perhaps a few Sky Lightning Claws were enough to eliminate thousands of undead too, but the Thunderbolt: Chain Lightning and Tyrant Call only needed one-tenth of the energy to cast that a Sky Lightning Claw required. Mo Fan, who had fought in real wars before, knew how significant that was!
