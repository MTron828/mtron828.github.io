In the meeting room at the highest floor of Lin’s Building...

“I hope you’re not wasting my time. There is a whole pack of sea monsters roaming the ocean close to Feiniao City. They first appeared around seven years ago, but their numbers have increased tremendously over the few years. The state council has sent someone to annihilate them, but the effect was close to nothing!” Lin Junxian looked at the group of young Magicians sternly.

In Lin Junxian’s eyes, they looked more like a group of students going on training. Even though the students of some Magic High Schools were fairly talented, they were not as reliable as the Hunters from the Hunter Union, mainly because of their experience and knowledge.

Dealing with demon creatures required intelligence, and experience in real combat, instead of the shiny badges given to the Magicians!

Lin Junxian was from a renowned family. Although he was utterly clueless about magic, he clearly understood their identities as Magicians did not necessarily mean they could fight demon creatures, let alone an entire pack of sea monsters. Without a troop, they would easily be wiped out if they engaged the sea monsters!

“You won’t need to worry about us. We would only accept if because we’re confident in ourselves. It’s unnecessary to doubt our capabilities now. Give us all the information you have on the sea monsters, and prepare some of the necessities we’ve listed. After it’s done, all you need to do is wait here in your office with your secretary,” said Jiang Shaoxu confidently.

“Fine, the favor you asked in return is nothing, but I have to warn you, I didn’t ask you to risk your life. Your parents or schools are not meant to blame me if anything happens. I’ve failed my investment, but I still want my reputation,” said Lin Junxian.

Lin Junxian was fairly generous too. He arranged for the fourteen Magicians to stay at the hotel inside the building, and proceeded to prepare the necessities they needed to annihilate the sea monsters.

The most important thing that anyone needed when going on a hunt was the medical supply. It was necessary to bring around twenty different kinds of antidote alone.

The demon creatures were not the only possible source of poison. Some special environments would be poisonous too, the air they breathed in, the scent of flowers, the mist lingering in the air, the plants that they came into contact with...

Mo Fan was not an expert with these things, but Nanyu definitely was. She quickly put down the things on a list and gave it to Lin Junxian. The things were quite costly, too.

“By the way, do we really need so many things to kill the sea monsters? Aren’t you listing a bit too much?” asked Mo Fan.

“The supply is not only for the sea monsters. We still have a long way to go. It’s to prepare for our journey to Japan, too,” replied Nanyu.

“You sure have the foresight,” Mo Fan raised his thumb at Nanyu.

Their supplies were prepared fairly quickly. The necessary instruments were prepared too, with a sufficient supply of water and preserved food.

They also received a map that clearly illustrated the ocean nearby. Ai Jiangtu immediately started to examine it to come up with a strategy.

Although the outside of Feiniao City was the ocean, there were islands scattering across the ocean too. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the past, each island had its ecosystem preserved. They were placed on the boundaries of the safe zone, and were used as a kind of tourist attractions for adventurous tourists. However, the islands were no longer being developed after several incidents. They were completely abandoned, and as the boundaries of the safe zone shrank toward the inland, these islands ended up becoming part of the territory of the demon creatures.

The shrinking of the safe zone greatly troubled the ships and the fishermen. It also greatly affected transportation to the city. No one was brave enough to come to the city to do business, as the ships full of goods would suddenly go missing. The gleaming silver simply sank to the bottom of the ocean.

The big investors of Feiniao City had all withdrawn over the past few years. Only the Lin Group stayed and tried to support the economy. They tried to use money to make it look like the city’s economy was blossoming, but the truth was, no one was willing to buy the suites with the scenic views and the luxurious buildings!

The mayor was extremely troubled by the city’s economy, too.

The City Council had tried sending people to annihilate the sea monsters. However, their numbers were limited, and the sea monsters were extremely cunning. The Magicians he sent out either returned empty-handed or were ambushed along the journey. After a few tries, no one was willing to sail out to kill the sea monsters!

That being said, if someone offered a great sum, the Hunter Masters would still be interested in taking the quest. The problem was, the Lin Group could no longer afford that sum. The City Council was having financial problems too, and most of the time, the sea monsters remained even after they paid the money...

A white ship was sailing slowly on the slightly cloudy ocean, moving away from the boundaries of the safe zone.

Unlike the land, where a safe zone was guarded by watchtowers, keeps, and fortresses, the boundaries of the safe zone on the ocean were maintained by a few lighthouses stationed by a few Battlemages at most. It was far from a proper line of defense.

Luckily, the sea monsters were not as active in the shallows. A small number of Magicians was enough to protect the cities and the towns along the coastline.

Feiniao City was a special case. The sea monsters had been showing up a lot lately.

“During the last operation, the Magicians arrived at a rocky island. They were ambushed by the sea monsters when they were resting at night, resulting in great casualties,” said Ai Tutu as he pointed at an island on the map.

“Which means the sea monsters will most likely show up at that island. By the way, what kind of sea monsters were they? If it’s Deep-Scales Sea Monsters, we should pack up and go home. We are screwed if it is a whole pack of them,” said Jiang Yu.

Jiang Yu was a clean-looking student with spectacles. One could easily tell that he was the studious sort from his appearance alone. He could identify a demon creature and its gender by looking at a single hair plucked from a demon creature’s leg, without looking at the illustration of the creature.

The Deep-Scales Sea Monsters he mentioned were the most savage and cruelest kind. It had been years since they last appeared along China’s coastline. News about them being spotted in Japan would occur occasionally, resulting in a panic.

“They are said to be scarlet. It’s impossible for them to be the Deep-Scales Sea Monsters,” said Nanyu.

“By the way, I’m not an expert at fighting in the water. If they drag us into the water, aren’t the ones without Water Element dead for sure?” asked Jiang Yu seriously.

“Me neither,” expressed Mo Fan.

Gong Yu glanced at Mo Fan and said calmly, “No one is counting on a substitute like you.”
