2979 Demonic Nature

The bead light spread across the sky. Every soul floated before Mo Fan, and the person finally appeared. Even though he had never seen that person in real life, his face clearly appeared in his mind.

That person was the Cold Hunting King! He represented the Rightful Soul of the world!

The Seven Souls vanished. Mo Fan’s body overlapped with the Cold Hunting King’s wisp of red soul.

Under the intertwining of the bead light and the evil moon, Mo Fan’s face and body changed into that of a different person.

His shoulders widened, and his face became squarer. The red soul stood before Lingling. She looked at Mo Fan. She also saw the red Rightful Soul that had overlapped with Mo Fan.

“Lingling.” It was Mo Fan’s voice, but it was also the voice of someone else, one with a more regal cadence.

Lingling felt as if she had been electrocuted. She had waited for that voice to call her name for many years.

When she was young, she always listened to bedtime stories before going to bed. Her father used to come home exhausted with bruises and cuts all over his body but he would carry her and tuck her into bed while bragging about the demons he had killed that day.

However, that night was different from usual.

She had stayed up late at night. She almost fell asleep numerous times but was jolted awake by a footstep outside. Her father used to call her as soon as he entered through the door of the house. However, that night, she did not hear her father’s call even after she waited until dawn.

“Lingling…”

“You can go to bed alone.”

“You can prepare meals for yourself.”

“You have learned to live a healthy and balanced life.”

After Lingling grew up into an adult but his voice would always ring in her mind. Sometimes, she could not help but bury her head in her arms and break down even after so many years.

She had been waiting for her father all this while.

She wanted to hug him so badly again, even though she knew he was dead and gone. She was still not willing to accept the truth.

The father and daughter remained silent. No words could express how she felt when her father’s voice called her name so softly.

Mo Fan’s soul overlapped with the Cold Hunting King’s. It was the Rightful Soul of heaven and earth! The Rightful Soul was the most important soul among the Eight Souls!

At that moment, Mo Fan truly felt the king’s emotions…

If the king was given a chance, he would never choose to be the Rightful Soul of this world. The king longed to be an ordinary father and watch his dear Lingling grow up.

He wanted to tell bedtime stories and watch her fall asleep.

He wanted to drop her to school.

He wanted to guide her away from bad influences.

He wanted to delight in her youth as she grew up to be beautiful but also wanted to worry about guys eyeing her…

Unfortunately, time never went backwards.

Lingling had grown up. She had grown up alone without his company.

Even though the king had missed her and could never go back to the past, he was glad to see that she was well. This was the greatest satisfaction for him.

“Thank you,” the Cold Hunting King whispered to Mo Fan.

Before Mo Fan could respond to him, the Cold Hunting King’s red soul stirred up a powerful soul windstorm. The windstorm expelled the corrupted and evil energy from the Sacrificial Mountain and infused Mo Fan’s body with the most pure, righteous energy.

The Four Souls of Goodness honored Mo Fan! The true Wicked God was both good and evil.

Mo Fan had been baptized in the past. He was furious when he was in Dubai. Mo Fan was a destroyer in contrast to the saints, Zhan Kong, Wen Tai, and Feng Zhoulong. If the world became ugly, he would end it!

The Wicked God was both good and evil. It could save people. Likewise, it could destroy heaven and earth.

Everything hinged on his own thoughts.

“I am Mo Fan, and I’m also a demon.”

Mo Fan’s eyes turned into blood-ink, and his blood boiled.

The Red Demon had red souls, but the true Wicked God had a blood-ink soul. It was exactly like the demon that resided inside Mo Fan’s body.

As far as Mo Fan was concerned, he never saw the Star Dust, Nebula, Galaxy, and Star Sea in his Demon Element. However, when the Eight Souls gathered today, his Demon Element grew and turned the world into blood-ink…

The universe itself was blood-ink.

His Lightning Element, Fire Element, Shadow Element, Summoning Element, Space Element, Earth Element, and Chaos Element were inside the blood-ink, demonic universe!

Mo Fan sensed the drastic change in his own world.

Before this, he used to wonder which element of the Forbidden Curse he would be chosen to wield after stealing the Red Demon’s massive energy.

The truth was that when he had seen Lu Nian from the Four Souls of Evil, he realized that the Red Demon’s power could turn those who could not control it into a monster.

Those who had been used as experiments to turn them into a demon by Lu Nian all ended up the same.

As for the Red Demon Kazuaki, it was a half-demon. But there was only one Wicked God. It was clear that the Red Demon Kazuaki had found a more perfect demon!

At that moment, Mo Fan finally understood why it said he could never kill the Red Demon.

This was because he was the Red Demon himself. He was much stronger than the Red Demon Kazuaki. He was in a better position to control the Eight Souls. He was more capable of posing a threat to the world.

The Eight Souls gradually dissipated. The new Wicked God stood there. The blood moon slowly disappeared from the sky, and Mo Fan finally reverted to his original form.

He was unaware of the wave of evil energy that was approaching him like a pack of massive dragons. With his just acquired supernatural power, he did not feel any sense of assurance either.

In fact, he felt an unprecedented calmness. His blood-ink eyes that shot evil power gradually returned to its black-brown color.

Mo Fan looked around him and realized that most of the youngsters on the Sacrificial Mountain had fled.

A black-haired girl hugged him tightly. It was as though she wasn’t willing to let go of him.

Mo Fan gradually became calmer. He was no longer as riled up as when he was under the power of the Eight Souls. He reached out and patted her softly on the back to comfort her.

“He’s gone, isn’t he?” Lingling buried her head in Mo Fan’s arms.

“Yes.” Mo Fan nodded.

“Are you a Forbidden Mage now?” Lingling looked up at Mo Fan.

“I could be even more than that…” Mo Fan did not know how to answer her.

‘A Forbidden Mage?’

It appeared that becoming a Forbidden Mage was not the only option. Mo Fan could sense a significant difference in the magic galaxy submerged in the crimson cosmos. It appeared as though he had changed into a demon of extreme calmness created by the Eight Souls.

Lingling had not anticipated this outcome. But one thing for sure, Mo Fan would remain as he was. The vast malevolent energy did not make him lose himself. Perhaps, this was the reason why he was more perfect compared to the first generation of Red Demon.

The first generation of Red Demon Kazuaki was a completely mad demon. It had sinned innumerable times…

Swoosh!

Swoosh!

The black night sky was lit by a dazzling star fire. They heard the sound of the star fire arching across the sky. It sounded like a flute!
