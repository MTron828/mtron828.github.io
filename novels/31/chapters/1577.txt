BANG!

Gouts of dark flaming breath converged from three different directions. Mo Fan quickly transformed into a shadow bird when he found himself in an unfavorable position and fled in the only direction with an opening.

ROAR!

However, there was another Hellish Cerberus waiting for him. These creatures knew how to work together to force Mo Fan into a corner, giving a Hellish Cerberus that was holding its position in the corner a chance to ambush him!

Mo Fan was vulnerable when he was under the Fleeing Shadow’s effects. He quickly came out of the shadow, but immediately found himself in great danger. After all, there was no way he could defend himself when the enemy was coming from all directions!

It was too late to use Blink. Mo Fan did not expect another creature to be hiding in the corner. In the nick of time, Zhao Manyan’s Plummeting Rays spiraled above Mo Fan and assembled a set of sturdy armor around him.

The Hellish Cerberus that was trying to ambush Mo Fan swept its paws at him. Luckily, the armor of light had shown up in time. Otherwise, the impact could easily have broken all his bones.

The armor of light absorbed the majority of the impact. The rest of the force knocked Mo Fan flying into the distance.

Mo Fan stabilized himself to prevent himself from falling. He quickly looked around to see if there were any Hellish Cerberi hiding nearby.

These Hellish Cerberi had all come out of nowhere. Their numbers were shocking! It was likely that even a Super Mage would die horribly in here...

ROAR!

As Mo Fan expected, a Hellish Cerberus jumped down from the pillar nearby just as he was about to Channel his spell. Mo Fan threw a few Fiery Fists at the creature without any mercy!

The Fiery Fists flew at the falling Hellish Cerberus and delivered solid hits, knocking the creature some distance away, blistering its neck and belly.

The other four Cerberi arrived quickly, charging at Mo Fan from different directions while he was casting the Fire Spells to flank him. They did not give him any chance to catch his breath.

Mo Fan was infuriated after being backed into a corner multiple times in a row.

“Still trying to flank me!?” Mo Fan fixed his eyes on one of the Cerberi. He quickly constructed a Lightning Star Constellation.

“Die!”

A lightning ray sprang at the Hellish Cerberus. It tried to dodge the lightning with its quick reflexes, but the lightning ray exploded before reaching it. Thick lightning arcs surged wildly across the place and knocked the Hellish Cerberus into the air.

The Hellish Cerberus lost its balance as the lightning arcs whipped at it ruthlessly. It cried out in agony as its skin and flesh blistered.

The other three Hellish Cerberi did not care about their comrade. Nine heads spat out fiery breaths at Mo Fan simultaneously. The dark blue Hellfire formed a fiery vortex racing towards him!

The Hellish Vortex was rather terrifying. His armor of light slowly faded away amid the flames. Mo Fan did not resist the attack directly. He decisively cast Blink to escape the encirclement!

Mo Fan was still engulfed in the Hellfire when he traveled three hundred meters away. He did not have time to treat the burns. He had to take out one or two of the Cerberi. Otherwise, his life would be in constant danger.

“Swamp of Darkness!”

Mo Fan cast the Nyx Regime. Muddy black shadows flowed away from him quickly.

The Hellish Cerberi could not move freely in the Swamp of Darkness. They were planning to flank Mo Fan again, but they failed to locate him.

“Rebelling Shadow!” Mo Fan consumed four Commander-level Soul Remnants to summon four demon shadows of the Hellish Cerberi.

The four shadows only had a certain level of fighting ability, but importantly, they could reform themselves when inside the Swamp of Darkness. When the Hellish Cerberi shattered them, they would turn into smoke, float to a different spot, and return as shadows again!

Mo Fan’s heart ached a little when he consumed four Commander-level Soul Remnants in a row. Luckily, the four demon shadows managed to lift the burden from his shoulders by distracting the Hellish Cerberi. He finally had the chance to cast some real spells!

“You still dare to come? I shall take care of you first, then!” Mo Fan quickly scanned his surroundings, and directed a black lightning bolt at the Hellish Cerberi.

Lightning bolts and claws suddenly flickered above the Hellish Cerberi. They hammered down past the Hellish Cerberus’ heads and blasted them apart, their brains scattering in the air. Two heads were even smashed into pieces by the Sky Lightning Claw!

The heads of the Hellish Cerberi were the main source of their strength. Their strength would decline significantly whenever they lost one of their heads.

Mo Fan noticed a Hellish Cerberus trying to flee for its life after it was severely injured by the Sky Lightning Claw. He quickly followed up with Telekinesis, taking the creature by surprise. Its last head was blasted apart too, its contents splattered across the ground! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Still think you can take me on? Mo Fan chuckled.

The headless Hellish Cerberus ran around aimlessly for half a minute, before its body slowly stiffened and fell to the ground. Mo Fan gladly claimed its Soul Remnant.

“As for the rest of you, I will knock your heads off one by one!” Mo Fan had secured the upper hand in the fight, finally displaying his violent fighting style.

The demon shadows had earned a great deal of for Mo Fan. By the time they finally disappeared, Mo Fan was done Channeling a powerful spell!

“Hellish Flames!”

The Hellish Cerberi were not the only one that could control the fires of Hell. As a Fire Mage, Mo Fan could summon the same flames with eerie burning effects.

The Hellish Flames descended from the sky, its area increasing continuously as it fell. The three Hellish Cerberi trapped in the Swamp of Darkness sensed their lives were in danger, and immediately fled in a panic. Two of them managed to escape the Swamp of Darkness, but one that was hampered by it was completely caught by the deadly flames!

The enormous meteorite smashed a huge hole in the ground, the Hellish Cerberus that had failed to escape in time right beneath it. Its body was scorched black like charcoal, dead!

“The two of you aren’t running away, either!” Mo Fan had completely lost his temper.

These dogs had abused their numbers and picked on him. It was time to teach them what the consequences of messing with him were!
