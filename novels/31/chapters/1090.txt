Mo Fan looked at Mu Ningxue, Mu Ningxue looked at Ayleen, and Ayleen pondered for a moment before she finally said, “I did hear something about it, but I’m not too sure, either.”

“Hehe, so it turns out that you guys are the well-behaved ones. The truth is, before the treasure hunt, many students were collecting information about the greatest treasure through their factions or third parties, since any information will give them a head start over the others. Some teams did not even bother searching for the other treasures after the treasure hunt started. They are all focusing on finding the greatest treasure,” the plump businessman from Sweden went on.

“Does that mean the treasure is more valuable than everything else?” Mo Fan said excitedly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Absolutely!” Tony chuckled. His eyes would occasionally sweep across Mu Ningxue and Ayleen in a perverted way.

“Say, do you know where this treasure is?” Mo Fan asked.

“I only know something about it, I only learned it from eavesdropping on the team that came to me. They weren’t aware that I’m a Sound Mage,” Tony chuckled.

Mo Fan looked at the man. He was having trouble understanding why a plump, greedy man like Tony was a representative of the Swedish team, when most of their members looked well-educated with an imposing appearance. Somehow, whenever the man smiled, Mo Fan had a strong urge to beat him up!

“So tell us about it...” Mo Fan said.

“Everyone likes good stuff, and my small business here isn’t going to bring me much profit, so I was thinking, if you’re willing to help me get the treasure, I’ll split the profits with you. Of course, as your teammate, I’ll be more than happy to heal your injuries for free...” Tony smiled.

“So how are you going to split the profit?” it was what Mo Fan cared about the most.

“I’ll be taking half of the profit, and you can split the rest however you want,” Tony said.

“Then I guess I would prefer to disqualify the both of us,” Mo Fan summoned a flame with his other hand and waved it in front of Tony.

“(sigh) Why do you always have to use violence? We can negotiate further if you don’t agree...” Tony obviously did not want Mo Fan to force him to use the teleporting scroll, since he had not earned as much as he had hoped for.

“If you join us, it means our team is going to have four people. Once we acquire the treasure, we’ll split the profit evenly!” Mo Fan said.

“Brother Mo Fan, don’t you know the person with the information is supposed to take... alright, we’ll do it your way, but you all will have to try your best to retrieve the treasure. Since it’s the greatest treasure that the Hunter Union has prepared, it’s going to be difficult to secure it if we don’t work together. Besides, we’re competing against other maniacs too, who won’t hesitate to fight us over the slightest conflict,” Tony said.

“That’s more like it, you should just have said that right from the start, look at the time we’ve wasted,” Mo Fan lowered the fist that he was initially going to throw out. He glanced at Ayleen and said, “Sign a contract with him with the Psychic Element, just in case he’s trying to set us up.”

Ayleen nodded. They could not guarantee that the cunning Mage was not plotting against them, thus it was necessary to sign a Spirit Contract.

A Spirit Contract was fairly simple. It involved a Psychic Mage planting a Psychic Spell in the mind of the person after obtaining their consent. The spell would only activate when the person violated their promise. Only those from the ancient, renowned clans in England like Ayleen knew how to cast the spell. Not every Psychic Mage had learned it.

“If you lied to us, or do anything to betray the team, the Spirit Contract will reveal your location to me, meaning that I can hunt you down no matter where you run to,” Ayleen warned Tony.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover! I’ve sincerely offered you a chance to be rich, and I do understand the importance of teamwork. I won’t go against my own words!” Tony said seriously.

Tony did resolve the desperate situation that the trio was in by joining the team.

Despite how unreliable the man seemed to be, his Healing Spells were fairly impressive. Mo Fan’s hand that needed to be healed recovered in no time under the man’s Healing Spells.

Mu Ningxue and Ayleen fully recovered from their injuries, too. The trio soon found themselves in healthy condition. As for their energy that was depleted, they could only wait patiently for it to regenerate.

Tony’s primary Element was Healing, his second Element was Sound, and his third Element was Poison. He had managed to obtain useful information from the people that asked him to treat their injuries, including the information about the greatest treasure.

“I heard it’s located in a lake valley. Unfortunately, I haven’t been exploring, so I have no idea where it’s at,” Tony said.

“Can you find it, Ayleen?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“I’ll need some time, you guys can meditate to try and recover some energy while I look for the place that Tony mentioned,” Ayleen said.

This time, Ayleen did not try to get the information from the Observer Eagles. She simply cast Mind Control and turned every Observer Eagle nearby into her eyes. She ordered the Observer Eagles to fly in different directions and transmit the images they were seeing to her!

Mo Fan saw Ayleen’s pupils flickering rapidly, as if she was observing different views like a projection of slides...

It was Mo Fan’s first time seeing someone using Psychic Magic in such a manner. However, Mo Fan had to admit that it was very practical, since it allowed the Psychic Mage to acquire lots of information about the demon creatures’ territory across a huge area.

Ayleen could only control twelve Observer Eagles at the same time. The Observer Eagles continued to fly into the distance, and Ayleen maintained her focus on the views that the Observer Eagles were providing.

Some time later, after Mo Fan had recovered more than half of his energy, he heard Ayleen waking them up.

Tony had almost fallen asleep. He rubbed his eyes and said, “Great Duchess Ayleen, have you found the lake?”

“I’ve checked many places, but I think the only place that fits the description is toward the end of that mountain range. The whole place consists of valleys, creeks, basins, and ravines, but there’s no sign of water. There’s nothing there that resembles a lake, but there is a black miasma floating above the place. When I tried sending an Observer Eagle to go through the miasma to investigate the place, it died instantly... I can’t tell if it’s the place we’re looking for,” Ayleen said.

“I remember, now that you’ve mentioned it... those people said they have to find a safe entrance because the place is shrouded by some natural, poisonous miasma... I think it’s the place we’re looking for!” Tony said.

“Are you sure?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yeah, I’m fairly curious at the start too, because the place they were describing didn’t sound like a lake to me, either. A lake must be filled with water, but none of them mentioned the water. They kept mentioning the poisonous miasma instead. I initially thought the miasma was preventing them from entering the lake valley, but now that I think about it, the miasma might be looming over the valley. I believe it’s the place we’re looking for!’ Tony claimed confidently.

“It’s quite a distance from where we are now, and we can’t stay in this space for much longer. Let’s make our way there at once,” said Ayleen.

“Sure!”

—

Without further ado, the four immediately headed for the valley that Ayleen found.

The mountain range did not seem huge, but as they were sprinting across it, they realized that the space had been compressed. As they traveled to the end of the mountain range, they finally saw a huge sunken area covered by a thick, black miasma, and from afar, it did resemble a black lake...

The black miasma lake was not the usual, flat lake formed in a basin. Some of its areas were flat, some consisted of narrow cracks, and some were separated into pieces by the mountain tops. The giant lake was connected to a small lake that flowed like a river along the mountain. The sunken area was made up of lakes of different sizes joined together, and they had all dried up. It was quite a spectacular view as they were looking down from the top of the mountain!

“It’s such complicated terrain; it’s like scooping up a needle in the ocean trying to find the treasure here!” Mo Fan was lost in thought as he glanced across the place.

“The people of the Hunter Union wouldn’t come up with an unsolvable question. I’m sure there are hints down there, but the question is, how are we supposed to go down there with such a thick, poisonous miasma lingering above it?” Ayleen said.

“Hehe, have you forgotten what my Elements are? Poison is nothing but a mere appetizer to me!” Tony chuckled.

Tony found a relatively gradual slope leading down to the valley. The poisonous miasma was floating at a certain altitude. Speaking of which, it was weird that the miasma was only staying at that height, and it did resemble the calm water of a lake...

However, it was obvious that the valley under the miasma was their destination!

“Come, I’ll open up a gap, it’s only going to last a few seconds. Let’s head down there,” Tony was pretty quick with his actions. He immediately opened up a gap in the layer of poisonous fog.

The others quickly followed Tony through the gap. To their surprise, the space under the poison mist was a lot bigger than they thought...

The layer of poisonous mist was around three meters thick, but the four kept sliding down the slope and eventually reached some muddy ground at the bottom after traveling for more than eighty meters!

Mo Fan only raised his head after reaching the bottom. He glanced at the miasma high up that had blocked off most of the sunlight, and his heart was soon filled with terror. It felt like he had fallen to the pitch-black bottom of a deep ocean, and he was surrounded by icy darkness full of the unknown!
