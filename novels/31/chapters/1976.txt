Mo Fan’s Lightning Element was able to kill the Bone-Eating Spiders instantly. He did not have to worry about being ambushed from his blind spots, since the Dark Vein would alert him whenever he was in danger. He slew every Bone-Eating Spider nearby before they had a chance to attack him.

“Don’t lower your guard. There are still a lot of them here!” Mo Fan frowned.

Mo Fan was feeling uneasy because of his Dark Vein’s ability to predict danger. The spacious valley was not as calm and safe as it looked. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Humph, imbecile!” Mo Fan’s eyes glittered as he fixed his gaze on a Camouflaged Bone-Eating Spider less than five meters away.

The Camouflaged Bone-Eating Spider was extremely patient, and only revealed its murderous intent once Mo Fan was close enough. Unfortunately, its plan to ambush Mo Fan was not very effective against Mo Fan’s ability to predict danger.

The Camouflaged Bone-Eating Spider launched itself at Mo Fan. It went right for Mo Fan’s face, like it was going to stab him in the eyes.

Mo Fan reached out his left hand and clenched his fist. He caught the creature firmly in mid-air with Telekinesis.

“Fire!”

Flames erupted between Mo Fan’s fingers. The Bone-Eating Spider being held in the air was set on fire too!

The flames on the Bone-Eating Spider burned harshly. It fell to the ground and turned into a scorched corpse in just a few seconds.

“The Bone-Eating Spiders with the camouflage ability are most likely higher-level,” Mo Fan told the others.

The Camouflaged Bone-Eating Spiders were obviously stronger than the brown Bone-Eating Spiders in terms of speed, strength, and defense. Mo Fan had to put in extra effort to kill the Camouflaged Bone-Eating Spider. He could not kill a bunch of them with a single spell.

“Let’s go. The mudslide is getting closer!” Nanyu said uneasily.

She could hear the mudslide speeding up. It meant the steep terrain that the flood was passing through had sped it up!

Time was running short, yet the Bone-Eating Spiders were still blocking their way. If they did not reach the slope in time, the mudslide would bury them all. Even if they were lucky to survive, the Bone-Eating Spiders would be the ones to dig them up.

The people felt chills running down their spines when the thought crossed their minds.

Mo Fan began killing the creatures more decisively. His high-tier Intermediate Spells were extremely effective in this battle. He did not have to rely on Advanced Spells when the Bone-Eating Spiders were nearby, nor did he have to use weaker spells that were ineffective when his spells were on cooldown.

The journey was relatively smooth. The ninth team had almost reached the end of the valley, yet they kept hearing cries of agony and Gavin’s furious roars from behind.

“Team nine, what the hell are you doing? Why are there so many Bone-Eating Spiders along the way?” Gavin cursed.

“Look out under your feet!”

The mercenaries had spread out a little after there was more space to move around. They were maintaining some distance between themselves to support one another when needed.

However, some of the members suddenly disappeared while they were running. Their formation suddenly had a lot of gaps. The people began to feel uneasy.

They were hearing strange noises from the ground. Nanyu was at the back of the team and looked behind her, seeing claws reaching out from the ground. The claws were hidden in unnoticeable spots. They would grab onto the mercenaries’ legs firmly as they were passing by.

Those who failed to activate their magic Armor in time were stabbed in the chest and the ribs by the spiders, before being dragged into the ground in the blink of an eye!

“What’s happening? We just passed by those spots, but they didn’t attack us! Why did they attack the mercenaries instead?” Zhao Manyan blurted out when he saw the mercenaries were under attack.

They had been clearing a path for the group. The mercenaries were following the same path too, but the Bone-Eating Spiders had let them pass and attacked the mercenaries behind them instead!

“They are choosing their targets. These things realized they couldn’t afford to mess with us, so they chose to attack the weaker mercenaries!” Lingling answered.

“It’s likely that Mo Fan’s is too intimidating. He has slain too many Camouflage Bone-Eating Spiders,” Jiang Yu agreed.

“Mo Fan, come back! You’re getting too far ahead,” Jiang Shaoxu quickly called out to Mo Fan, who had already gone quite a distance ahead.

Mo Fan noticed the group was falling behind. He was about to curse the mercenaries for moving slowly when he saw them being dragged into the ground.

“Damn it, the Bone-Eating Spiders are under us too!” Zhao Manyan cursed.

“Why do I have a feeling we have fallen into a spider cave? We are stuck in multiple layers of spiderwebs!” Jiang Yu murmured.

The spiders in a forest would only build thin spiderwebs. Some insects that were slightly bigger could easily break the spiderwebs by flying through them. However, it did not necessarily mean the spiders could not trap the insects. Those careless insects would simply overlook the spiderwebs since they were too thin, and the spider silk would then stick to their wings. When they realized they were struggling to beat their wings properly, they would fall into the spiders’ traps. The further they flew, the more they were entangled by the spiderwebs. They would eventually be worn out and be stuck to a seemingly thin spiderweb.

The group was like prey that was slowly walking into a spider’s trap. They were not yet stuck in a spiderweb, but they were stepping into a trap that the spiders had long set up. The more they panicked, the more dangerous their situation was!

“Mo Fan, how did you detect the Camouflage Bone-Eating Spiders? Can you warn the others?” Ai Jiangtu asked.

“It’s tricky. I can’t detect them if they aren’t hostile to me,” Mo Fan answered helplessly.

The ability of Mo Fan’s Dark Vein to predict danger was his greatest trick in this situation, but the Bone-Eating Spiders had stopped attacking him. If the creatures stopped being hostile toward him, he could not detect them with the Dark Vein.

It was similar to a signal. When something was posing a threat to Mo Fan, the Dark Vein would immediately capture the signal and warn Mo Fan by making his heart beat faster, his pores expand, his muscles clench, and his skin turn cold. How could the Dark Vein warn him when the Bone-Eating Spiders were not even attacking him?

There was also another scenario when the Dark Vein would alert Mo Fan beforehand: when there was something nearby that could kill Mo Fan in an instant!

Unfortunately, the Bone-Eating Spiders were not strong enough to trigger the Dark Vein’s ability!
