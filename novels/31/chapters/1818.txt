Li Dong and Zhu Min headed toward Mo Fan’s group. Zhu Min was wearing a disrespectful grin. He intentionally turned around and glanced at Tangyue as he said with a hint of disdain, “Not only is that woman ordering us around, she is naive enough to think that we would go with her to the island. Does she really think we are going to listen to her?”

“Zhu Min, you’re still too young. There’s no reason to oppose the Vice Chief all the time. You can just obey her will, but you won’t have to put in too much effort when you’re doing the jobs. When she figures out we aren’t reliable, she will request that she be assigned somewhere else instead,” Li Dong sighed.

“I’m just not pleased with the way she looks at us, like we are just a bunch of useless pricks,” Zhu Min said.

“HAHAHA, why do you even bother? There’s no way our Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union can handle this case, it’s the mess left by the officials from ten years ago. Why do we have to risk our lives to wipe their ass clean?” Li Dong snorted.

“Say, if that Tangyue really resolves the case, will she be promoted even further?” Zhu Min asked.

“Promotions don’t happen so easily. The merit from resolving the case is only enough for a little advancement. As long as your father is still around, no one can possibly replace him. She will soon be reassigned to Hangzhou or the Magic City; whether it is a promotion or a demotion will depend on her performance in the case,” Li Dong judged.

“Oh, so we will be given huge merits if we did resolve the case, right?” Zhu Min asked.

“You’re still too naive. Our contributions are mainly about bringing benefits to the region or country. Resolving a mess that was left behind by the authorities in the past isn’t really contributing. There are just too many things to worry about along the coastline. Do you think you will receive a lot of merit from cleaning up the mess that was left from ten years ago?” Li Dong asked.

The two noticed Mo Fan, Mu Bai, Zhao Manyan, Jiang Shaoxu, and Lingling walking toward them while they were talking. It was likely that the group had overheard them. as they were talking loudly. However, Li Dong and Zhu Min were not ashamed of themselves. They were merely stating the truth. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Hello there, I heard from my colleagues that you were here last night doing some scouting. Did you learn anything yet?” Li Dong asked them shamelessly.

“Nothing much,” Mo Fan replied.

“Oh, you should be careful in this area. To be honest with you, we have already submitted a report to the superiors telling them how dangerous Dawn Island is. I hope you can give the Vice Chief a little advice too,” Li Dong said.

“We will.”

Mo Fan and his group went straight to Tangyue after passing by Li Dong and Zhu Min.

Tangyue stood on the edge of the cliff. The sea breeze was blowing at her. Her clothes and hair were drifting in the wind, setting off her alluring figure, but the loneliness they could see from looking at her back hindered the men’s wild imagination.

“Miss...Miss Tangyue?” Mu Bai was having a hard time believing it was really her when he stepped closer.

Tangyue turned around. She was also surprised to see Mu Bai after so many years.

Tangyue was the open-minded kind. It had been so long since they last met. She gave Mu Bai a simple hug as she had Mo Fan.

Mu Bai was obviously not as shameless as Mo Fan, nor was he trying to take any advantage of Tangyue. He blushed like a shy kid after greeting the woman in such a Western manner.

“Mo Fan, I now believe that every male student in your batch has done something because of her,” Zhao Manyan whispered into Mo Fan’s ear when he saw Mu Bai’s reaction.

“Why would I lie to you? Mu Bai is also the kind that would get the attention of the teachers and administrators of the school. If he hadn’t Awakened the Ice Element, he might be following Tangyue every day pretending to be a good student, but his true intention would most likely be...” Mo Fan raised his brows.

“Heh, no wonder you always call him Green Tea Man.”

“Miss Tangyue, you don’t seem to have any reliable men?” Mo Fan inquired drily.

“Mm, I already found that out the first week after I came here, but I’m worried that the townsfolk who were poisoned might be in danger if we don’t do anything soon,” Tangyue said.

It would take some time for a report to be submitted and assessed, not to mention they needed to gather enough information to convince their superiors of how big of a threat Dawn Island was. However, the authorities were extremely busy right now. They would normally let their subordinates handle a case first, and if it was still unresolved, they would leave it until they finally had someone reliable to handle it.

“Miss Tangyue, why don’t you come with us?” Mo Fan said.

“Yeah, gorgeous miss, we are trying to get to the island too. It’s better to come with us than relying on those parasites from the Enforcement Union,” Zhao Manyan nodded.

“It’s supposed to be a part of Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union’s duty. How can I let you risk your lives?” Tangyue said.

Tangyue had been to Dawn Island herself. It was clearly not the friendliest place.

“We like going on adventures,” Mo Fan said.

“That’s right!”

“We even went to a Pyramid,” Zhao Manyan said.

“A Pyramid?” Tangyue blurted out with surprise. She looked at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan sneakily gave Zhao Manyan a kick. He immediately explained, “We were going around a Pyramid in circles when we traveled to Egypt.”

“Miss Tangyue, Mo Fan went inside the Great Pyramid of Giza,” Lingling promptly added on.

Tangyue’s eyes immediately widened. She swiftly grabbed Mo Fan’s ear and pinched it while blurting out angrily, “Are you out of your mind? Who gave you permission to go to a place like that? I was wondering why you weren’t telling me your whereabouts lately and kept going missing. It turns out that you’ve been to some dangerous places!”

Mo Fan gasped. His ear was hurting from the pinch.

Jiang Shaoxu was astounded when she saw how Tangyue had pinched Mo Fan’s ear so adeptly. There really was someone that could subdue Mo Fan, as expected of Mo Fan’s teacher!

“Miss...Miss Tangyue, let’s discuss how we can reach the island for now. Mu Bai will slowly explain to you what happened in the Pyramid. He’s better at remembering things, so he will know the details better than I do,” Mo Fan quickly said.

Mu Bai took a step back. He was worried that his ear would fall into Tangyue’s hand, too!

“Miss Tangyue, I do agree that we should focus on resolving the case first. The poisoned townsfolk are in danger of losing their lives, and we have no idea if the authorities are going to send someone here quickly after receiving the report. We have to find the source of the poison to derive the cure,” Mu Bai pointed out.

Tangyue finally let go of Mo Fan’s ear.

“Basically, Zhao Manyan stumbled into a bunch of aggressive creatures in the water when he was flying to the island. According to his description, even someone with a Super Level defense will be defeated in no time. How can we make our way through those creatures? Things will be much simpler if we can reach the island,” Mo Fan said.

“Those creatures are the Featherless Birds!” Tangyue informed him.
