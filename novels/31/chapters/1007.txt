The evil moon was hanging high up in the sky, its light shining upon the desert. The howls of the foxes blended with the strong wind, while the cold flames of the Poison Fire Scorpions mixed with the brilliance of the moon...

It went from a hundred demon creatures flanking the humans to the two tribes of demon creatures glaring at the humans with great hatred. Somehow, the tribe war had slowly turned into a fight to take the humans out. Both the Poison Fire Scorpions and Sandfear Foxes were focusing their attention on Mo Fan and the others.

The presence of the Advanced Spells was simply too strong. The deadly spells posed a great threat to the demon creatures, so any demon creature with the slightest intelligence knew they could not allow the humans to cast spells freely!

‚ÄúJiang Shaoxu, can‚Äôt you use your Psychic Magic to ask them to take their fight somewhere else, and promise them we won‚Äôt interfere? They can fight as they wish, since we‚Äôre only trying to hold our ground here?‚Äù Zhao Manyan asked.

Jiang Shaoxu looked at Zhao Manyan as if he was a retard.

How could Psychic Magic possibly resolve the situation now? Even using the Spirit Ripple at the start to distract the demon creatures had failed, not to mention that they had already killed around two hundred Sandfear Foxes and Poison Fire Scorpions! How could the two tribes of demon creatures let them go?

‚ÄúEnough talking! I‚Äôm heading down, it‚Äôs too restricting to fight up here!‚Äù Mo Fan said to Zhao Manyan.

He purposely told Zhao Manyan, as he needed the man to provide him with some strong protection.

Before Zhao Manyan could refuse, Mo Fan summoned a pair of fiery wings on his back. The flames surged across the yellow sand.

A strong force burst out from the wings, thrusting Mo Fan forward like a giant missile!

The missile rammed into the Sandfear Foxes moving along the slope of the sand dune. A few of the Sandfear Foxes nearby melted instantly from the overwhelming heat. The Sandfear Foxes were forced to flee from the flames.

When these cunning creatures sensed the powerful aura from Mo Fan slowly weakening, they proceeded to reveal their claws, slicing and scratching at him. These Sandfear Foxes were incredibly fast, like flashes of lightning when they were moving at their top speed.

Sharp claws swiped ferociously at Mo Fan. Luckily, Zhao Manyan‚Äôs defense came right on time. The scales constructed by Plummeting Rays protected Mo Fan from the claws.

‚ÄúDie, you all!‚Äù Mo Fan yelled. The feathers scattering across the place suddenly combined into an imperious phoenix in midair and charged at the Sandfear Foxes!

A dozen Sandfear Foxes ran for their lives when the fiery phoenix lunged forward, but the Thousand Feathers Fiery Phoenix still managed to catch up to them. Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

A huge, brilliant fiery cloud rose into the sky as flames rolled to the edge of the sky. Not a single one of the Sandfear Foxes that were targeted survived. They all burned into ashes in the scorching heat.

‚ÄúMo Fan, behind you!...‚Äù Jiang Shaoxu warned.

Mo Fan was still catching his breath when two enormous Poison Fire Scorpions appeared only a few meters behind him as he turned around. The two creatures were already lunging with their thick pincers at him!

‚ÄúMeow!‚Äù A petite black figure swept past. Mo Fan only felt a sharp breeze, and the two Poison Fire Scorpions trying to ambush him were shredded into pieces!

‚ÄúThat was quick! Thanks, little black cat!‚Äù Mo Fan glanced at the Night Rakshasa that had landed on the ground beside him and chuckled.

The Night Rakshasa was staring at Mo Fan with glittering eyes. She seemed to be looking at the flames engulfing Mo Fan‚Äôs figure.

‚ÄúWhat is it? You‚Äôre trying to have a competition with my Little Flame Belle?‚Äù Mo Fan asked when he saw the Night Rakshasa‚Äôs intention.

‚ÄúMeow!‚Äù The Night Rakshasa lifted her head proudly.

‚ÄúFine, my other Elements are improving too slowly, because I keep relying on Little Flame Belle‚Äôs ability to possess me. Since there are so many enemies, I guess it‚Äôs better to split up. Little Flame Belle, come out here!‚Äù Mo Fan said.

Little Flame Belle quickly split away from Mo Fan. She was surrounded by the brown Calamity Fire, her flames rapidly spreading a few hundred meters in all directions. Her Commander-level presence immediately intimidated the Sandfear Foxes!

Normally, Little Flame Belle would still appear in the form of a little baby-like a porcelain doll, just so she could stay on Mo Fan‚Äôs shoulder and ask for a hug whenever she wished.

However, when she was in a fight, she would gradually turn into a Flame Belle Sailor Moon!

Teenage Flame Belle‚Äôs height was basically the same as Lingling‚Äôs, even her physique resembled that of Lingling. She had a slender figure and the slight curves of a young teenage girl.

Teenage Flame Belle‚Äôs aura was obviously a lot stronger than the Night Rakshasa‚Äôs. When the two rare species stood side by side, Teenage Flame Belle‚Äôs Commander-level aura completely overwhelmed the Night Rakshasa‚Äôs.

The Night Rakshasa was pretty strong, as she even dared take on a Commander-level creature. However, she was still some distance away from a real Commander-level creature. If the Night Rakshasa was able to break through, she would become a real Commander-level creature!

The Night Rakshasa‚Äôs strength was only slightly inferior to a Commander-level creature. She was able to defeat any Warrior-level creature, yet she was still not strong enough to take on a real Commander-level creature.

Teenage Little Flame Belle was different. She was a real Commander-level creature. Her aura immediately startled the Sandfear Foxes and the Poison Fire Scorpions. The demon creatures finally regained their courage after the commanders of their tribes gave their orders!

A fire lotus appeared on the sand where Teenage Flame Belle pointed her finger, burning ferociously. When it came into contact with any of the Sandfear Foxes, the flames of the fire lotus immediately split into several fire tongues and devoured the Sandfear Fox instantly!

Mo Fan was on his own, displaying strength that no Advanced Mage could ever possess in the chaotic fight, since he was able to alter between many Elements.

Zhao Manyan, Jiang Yu, and Jiang Shaoxu had to set up the boundaries and hold their positions against the demon creatures passively. They were scared of the demon creatures getting too close to them.

Mo Fan was different. He could simply charge into the demon creatures and clear a path with brute force since he was fairly experienced with handling demon creatures while being surrounded, and taking advantage of the fact that he could abuse the number of Elements he had.

Meanwhile, Mu Ningxue could easily massacre the demon creatures with her Domain, but unfortunately, her Ice Magic was affected to a certain degree by the dry, scorching environment. Even her Ice Domain was not as superior as it usually was.

As such, Mu Ningxue did not force herself to fight on her own. She decided to stay with the others instead, holding their positions firmly. The group was fine letting Mo Fan do his thing, since he was tougher than a cockroach. He would still be fine even if the others on the team were taken out!

Mo Fan stood at the front of the sand dune, and proceeded to intercept the Sandfear Foxes and butcher them.

The Poison Fire Scorpions were Fire-type creatures, and Mo Fan‚Äôs strongest Element was Fire, thus it was obviously trickier to take them out.

Little Flame Belle Sailor Moon and the Night Rakshasa were holding their respective positions. Similar to Mo Fan, they were also being surrounded by the demon creatures.

‚ÄúMo Fan, please step aside, I‚Äôm about to open the Summoning Gate!‚Äù Jiang Yu yelled at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan did not react at the start. However, when he suddenly recalled the Advanced Summoning Spell he saw at the Training Hall, he immediately turned around in panic.

As he thought, a large herd of giant rhinoceros in silver armor dashed out from the gate. Each rhinoceros was over twenty meters tall, like a moving building, fully covered in thick, heavy armor. When they charged out of the gate like a dam bursting, the sand dune was immediately flattened.

Mo Fan‚Äôs face paled. He immediately turned into a Shadow Bird and fled.

Luckily, Jiang Yu was humane enough to warn Mo Fan earlier. If he was any slower, the Silver-armored Giant Rhinoceros would surely have trampled Mo Fan to death!

The Advanced Summoning Spell was fairly unreasonable, able to Summon a herd of fairly high-ranked wild beasts to trample across the area. The army of Sandfear Foxes immediately suffered great casualties. The power of their tribe immediately weakened significantly.

Mo Fan was jealous when he saw the herd of silver rhino bullying the Sandfear Foxes.

The Advanced Summoning Spell was even more imperious than he had imagined. It basically Summoned a group of muscular beasts, ramming and trampling everything in their way. Mo Fan had witnessed the spell once on the stage of a Training Hall, but it seemed like these Silver-armored Giant Rhinoceros were even stronger than the Blood Beasts from before. The Sandfear Foxes no longer dared to approach the team after the tide of silver armor swept past!

‚ÄúIt feels like their morale has dropped, I‚Äôll try spreading fear among them,‚Äù Jiang Shaoxu immediately poured oil onto a fire when she saw Jiang Shaoxu‚Äôs Summoning Spell working like a charm.

‚ÄúHurry up, my spell won‚Äôt last any longer!‚Äù Jiang Yu said.

The Summoning of the Silver-armored Giant Rhinoceros was cast at the cost of a great supply of the Summoner‚Äôs energy. The energy of Jiang Yu‚Äôs Galaxy was being consumed at a shocking rate.

Jiang Shaoxu started amplifying the fear among the Sandfear Foxes with her Psychic Spell. Once the fear spread to the rest of the demon creatures, they would likely retreat!

It was a never-ending battle, since Warrior-level creatures were harder to kill than Servant-class creatures. They had only killed around four hundred creatures in total by now. If the Poison Fire Scorpions and the Sandfear Foxes were determined to fight them until their deaths, the humans would surely lose in the end!

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs working! Jiang Yu, just a little longer!‚Äù Jiang Shaoxu was overjoyed when she realized that her Spirit Ripple did not dissipate instantly
