Chapter 2760: Bring Along The Three Greatest Totem Beasts

“The Godly Horde Prophets must have known about Commander Hua’s plan. It’s no surprise that they are now using their puppets—humans— to look frantically for Commander Hua,” said Tang Zhong.

Commander Hua was the most important man in the East Coastline battle. The Ocean Godly Horde had targeted him and would attempt to kill him as much as possible.

He was severely wounded and weakened. If the Black Claw Emperor used the Godly Horde Prophet’s ability to manipulate humans’ minds and search for him, Commander Hua would be in serious trouble.

The army could not possibly cross half of the Pacific Ocean to reach Hawaii. The Godly Horde Prophets kept a close watch on humans. If humans made a large scale of movement, Commander Hua’s exact location would be exposed. Once the Ocean Demons learned about it, they would find Commander Hua ahead of any of them and kill him.

This was why Tang Zhong had been so vigilant. He did not exercise his power in the Enforcement Union and had instead summoned Ms. Tangyue and Mo Fan. Tang Zhong was wary that some of his men within the Enforcement Union had become the Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets. It was a very serious issue. Even though the Enforcement Union was known for its strictness, there was the Black Vatican before this. The Godly Horde Prophet’s power in manipulating the puppets was unrivaled.

“I’ll go to Hawaii.” Mo Fan said quickly.

This was a matter of national crisis. If Commander Hua was killed in the Pacific Ocean, the East Coastline would practically collapse. Many people would die unless they could evacuate the coastline and move to safety very quickly. Even if the people were to retreat to the central and western region, the weather there was cold, and resources were scarce.

Besides, the path from east to central and western regions were fraught with demons and monsters. It would be a bloodbath.

“We’ll find Commander Hua.” Ms. Tangyue said with determination.

“No, Ms. Tangyue, you must stay here,” said Tang Zhong. “Mo Fan will go alone.”

Mo Fan was puzzled. But he nodded. “No problem. I can go alone but I will need to take the Black Totem Snake with me. My power will not be enough.”

Ms. Tangyue was stunned. “How can you ask Mo Fan to make the journey alone?!” she said. “He can’t risk his life...”

Mo Fan patted her shoulders. “Ms. Tangyue, don’t worry. You can stay at Hang Zhou. Mr. Tang might need your help.”

......

“What else is more critical than Commander Hua’s life?” said Ms. Tangyue. “Mo Fan, do you think I will slow you down if I go with you?”

Ms. Tangyue had three Super Level elements. Her cultivation was even higher than Mo Fan’s. In fact, she was the one who had taught him the Fire and Shadow elements! He would not dare to look down on her.

“Of course not, Ms. Tangyue! Your presence would be enough to win this. But right now, I think you have greater matters to attend to,” said Mo Fan with a smile. “I will talk to the totem beasts before departing.”

The matter was very urgent. He could not waste his time talking. Ms. Tangyue watched Mo Fan leave with disappointment. But she knew Mo Fan. He had become very strong and could handle it.

As Mo Fan vanished out of sight, Ms. Tangyue recalled the day Mo Fan had first sought her out to teach him Fire element magical power at Tianlan Magic High School. She remembered his desire to learn the Shadow element magical power. He had grown from an innocent high school student to an expert within the blink of an eye. Ms. Tangyue could not help but feel very proud of him. After all, she was his teacher.

“Ms. Tangyue, the reason I didn’t allow you to go with him is not because of your lack of ability. I know there is no one here who can surpass you.” Tang Zhong interrupted Ms. Tangyue’s train of thought.

“I understand. I won’t take it personally,” said Ms. Tangyue.

“I thought you would have figured out what I needed for you to do next,” Tang Zhong said solemnly.

Ms. Tangyue looked at him in surprise. Realization hit her suddenly. “So, you want me to...”

“The Godly Horde Prophet’s puppets within the East Coastline fortress are like cancerous tumors. They will continue to expand and affect us. Mo Fan is not a member of the union, so he is least likely to be manipulated. Therefore, he is the most suitable person to go on this rescue mission,” said Tang Zhong. “Regardless of whether he can accomplish his mission or not, he is the most trustworthy person to be given this mission. As for you....” Tang Zhong’s eyes gleamed with murderous intent. “I would like you to take care of the traitors here.”

Tang Zhong really lived up to his reputation as an experienced Elder of the Magic Court. Ms. Tangyue realized there was more to Tang Zhong than met the eye. Apart from being powerful, strategy mattered the most.

There was no need for her to go along with Mo Fan. Mo Fan would likely succeed with her Black Totem Snake with him.

She, on the other hand, could take advantage of the opportunity to find out and get rid of the puppets. If she succeeded, she could blind the Ocean Godly Horde’s prying eyes on humans momentarily.

This was going to be a long war. Regardless of whether Commander Hua could survive the calamity or not, the war would continue. It was of utmost importance to get rid of the Godly Horde Prophet.

“I’ll do my best.” Ms. Tangyue was firm. Her heart filled with resolve.

“I know you won’t disappoint.” Tang Zhong nodded. His creased brows smoothed a little.

...

Mo Fan and Song Feiyao returned to the West Lake. The three totem beasts were still there.

As usual, the Moon Moth Phoenix was very close with the Green East Sea God. They whispered to each other.

Meanwhile, the Black Totem Snake was laid-back. It laid its enormous head on the Su Causeway, as if it was going to sleep until the next morning.

Yu Shishi strolled on the Su Causeway. She was not interested in matters surrounding the Enforcement Union. Besides, she hated the Magic Association’s members who used to bully her.

The Black Totem Snake opened its eyes when Mo Fan and Song Feiyao approached.

.

“Big guy, do you want to take a walk with me in the Pacific Ocean?” said Mo Fan to the Black Totem Snake.

The Black Totem Snake’s yellowish eyes lit up. It was bored of staying at West Lake. It raised its head and was ready to depart at a moment’s notice. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yu Shishi, stay at Hang Zhou with the Moon Moth Phoenix for a few days. We’ll discuss the Sacred Totem Beast issue after I come back,” said Mo Fan.

They needed help from Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu in finding clues for the Sacred Totem Beast, now that the Green East Sea God was around to provide them with further clues. Lingling and Jiang Shaoxu would arrive soon.

“Do you plan to go alone?” Song Feiyao stared at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan pointed at the Black Totem Snake. “Well... I have that.”

“Maybe I can come along,” said Song Feiyao. “The Green East Sea God never misses a target.”

“Um...” Mo Fan hesitated.

“If she’s going, take the Moon Moth Phoenix with you as well. It looks like you’re heading to a dangerous place,” said Yu Shishi.

The three greatest totem beasts together on this journey? Mo Fan’s army was complete. Besides, Commander Hua was in danger, he would need every help he could get.After all, they might most likely face demons of the King Skeleton’s level.
