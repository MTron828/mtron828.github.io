“What the heck, why can’t I enjoy a good sleep?” Mo Fan yawned and rose from his bed. He was still wearing white sleepwear.

The others were woken up by the alarm, too. They all went to the balconies outside their rooms.

Mo Fan could see a red light flickering. It was similar to the light of a Blood Alert. His expression immediately darkened as he mumbled to himself, “Are you serious? Are you telling me that every city I go to will have some kind of disaster?”

Mo Fan took a closer look and realized the light was different from a Blood Alert. It was only a signal for the guards in the West Guardian Tower.

The guards were busy patrolling around the tower. Many of them were heading up the stairs to the top floor. Mo Fan immediately blended into the guards and followed them to the top floor. He was curious to find out what was happening.

Commander Takagi and Mochizuki Ken were standing at the top of the tower, with Japanese soldiers lined up behind them. They were all looking at the area on the sea around six kilometers away from the tower.

The sea was some distance away from the West Guardian Tower. The bright moon reflected off the surface of the ocean, and it was obvious that something there was producing irregular waves that were splashing onto the rocks nearby.

The disturbance had come from that area, yet no one saw anything suspicious, apart from the irregular waves.

“What exactly is it?” asked Mochizuki Ken in a surprised tone.

“We’re not sure yet,” replied Commander Takagi in a deep voice.

The people of the West Guardian Tower had placed lots of buoys in the ocean close to Osaka’s boundary. The sensors would only respond when they detected the presence of living creatures.

Occasionally, some creatures would trigger the buoys, but it was rare to see more than a hundred sensors being triggered simultaneously.

Most importantly, they had discovered that the buoys were all triggered by a single creature!

Each buoy was around four meters apart. In other words, the creature that triggered the sensors was a gigantic sea creature!

“Commander Takagi, the creature seems to have withdrawn deep into the ocean!” reported a captain as he landed on the tower and withdrew his Wind Wings.

“It fled?” Commander Takagi was puzzled.

If a gigantic creature had triggered the sensors, it was most likely that the creature was up to something. Commander Takagi was just about to have the soldiers prepare for a huge battle, but the situation was resolved just like that?

“Maybe it accidentally came into our territory?” said Mochizuki Ken.

“I don’t think so, such a high-level creature must have a certain level of intelligence. There’s no way it doesn’t know this area belongs to us humans...” Commander Takagi stared into the distance and said after a slight hesitation, “I should go and check, just in case.”

Commander Takagi summoned an enormous beast. It had a head like tiger, with gray wings on its back. The wings were eight meters long when they were extended, even more majestic than the wings of a giant eagle.

The creature carried Commander Takagi as it soared into the sky. It flew a few hundred meters away by just beating its wings a few times. It gradually shrank into a tiny dot as it proceeded toward the area where the sensors were.

“That’s Commander Takagi’s Sky Ridge Beast, I’m so jealous!” sighed a captain.

“I heard that his Contracted Beast’s strength is almost on par with the Ruler-level creatures. If he’s lucky enough to help the creature evolve, Commander Takagi is going to become the strongest Summoner in Osaka!” said another captain.

“Yeah, Commander Takagi has been stationed here at the West Guardian Tower for quite some time, but normally people with his capabilities would be appointed to the maritime battlefield in Tokyo... hey, who are you, you’re not supposed to be here!” the captain’s expression darkened when he suddenly saw an uninvited guest.

Mochizuki Ken turned around and saw the person was a young man in his sleepwear.

The young man was still rubbing his eyes as if he had not fully woken up yet.

“Mo Fan, this isn’t somewhere you should be,” said Mochizuki Ken.

“Oh, I only came to take a look and see if there’s anything I can help with. It seems like the whole West Guardian Tower is in a panic,” Mo Fan replied curiously.

“A gigantic sea creature has appeared, but it seems like it has run away,” replied Mochizuki Ken.

The alarm slowly faded. As an important fortress protecting Osaka’s shoreline, the security of the West Guardian Tower was fairly tight. The guards were on alert twenty-four hours. It was not rare for the alarm to go off.

“A gigantic creature? How gigantic?” asked Mo Fan.

“We aren’t too sure either, our men didn’t really see the creature. We only detected it through the sensors, but it has now left,” said Mochizuki Ken. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yeah, it even triggered more than a hundred buoys. I almost thought a pack of demon creatures is invading Osaka. Luckily, it was only a creature that mistakenly trespassed into our territory.”

Mo Fan glanced at the area with a suspicious look. The ocean reflecting the silver glow of the moon was now calm. The crescent and stars could be seen from the surface of the ocean, a soothing scenery.

“If nothing actually happened, I guess I’ll head back to sleep,” said Mo Fan.

“Mm, go ahead, the West Guardian Tower can handle the situation if anything happened,” said Mochizuki Ken.

“That’s good to hear.”

“Kid, don’t come up here again!”

“(cough cough) I’ll be going.”

“Xiao Zhe, escort him back,” Mochizuki Ken called a soldier over to bring Mo Fan down.

“You sound like you’re scared that I’m going to run off to somewhere else again...” said Mo Fan.

—

The soldier called Xiao Zhe followed Mo Fan closely, making sure that he would not go somewhere else again.

They happened to pass by the drawbridge on their way down. Mo Fan glanced at the drawbridge that was lowered and asked Xiao Zhe curiously, “Why is the drawbridge lowered? I thought that place is a prohibited area?”

“It’s time for the guards to change shifts. You don’t think the guards will be staying in there for days, right?” answered Xiao Zhe.

“Speaking of which, what exactly is the East Guardian Tower used for? Why is everyone being so mysterious about it...” asked Mo Fan.

“It’s none of your...”

Before Xiao Zhe could finish sentence, thick lightning bolts descended from the sky. From their position, it felt like the energy of the magic formation was going to tear the night sky apart, and the lightning bolts were about to travel across the drawbridge and strike the West Guardian Tower!
