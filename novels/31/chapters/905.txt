The area in front of the Slanted Hall was in tatters after being hit by the rocks and boulders. The butler was an Earth Magician, and immediately cast a Rock Barrier to resist the rain of stones.

As the other Gray Priests hurriedly hid behind the Rock Barrier, a grin appeared on Mo Fan’s face.

“Flame sword!” Lifting his hands up high, flames poured out of his hands fiercely and swiftly turned into a ten-meter-long flame sword!

The flame sword was formed from the combination of brown and blazing red flames. Once it finally took shape, Mo Fan leapt into the air holding the sword and slashed at the Rock Barrier.

The people of the Black Vatican thought the Rock Barrier was able to protect them, yet in Mo Fan’s eyes, it was nothing but their grave. He could simply crush them all with a single slash!

The scorching sword slashed down from a great height, slicing through the thick layer of stone. Two of the Gray Priests hiding behind the Rock Barrier were caught by the fiery edge and turned into ashes as the force of the slash delivered the flames through the gap.

“What kind of a monster is he!?” screamed the butler, and fled in fear of his life.

His enemy’s magic was totally unpredictable, be it the Thousand Piercing Fiery Feathers or the flame sword. Both of them were comparable to an Advanced Spell! He had no idea how his enemy was able to control his magic so remarkably. Only Super Magicians were able to control their magic so perfectly!

“Senior, it looks like there’s a layer of elemental energy around him. I’m guessing that he must have some kind of Fire Element creature providing him with a different set of skills,” noticed Qin Ji.

The butler’s expression sank.

What difference did it make? Even if they knew the man’s Fire Element was incredibly powerful because he had a rare Elemental Creature, it still did not change the fact that they were being utterly crushed!

“Stop him, or the Blue Deacon is going to make us suffer!” swore the butler, clenching his teeth.

Frost slowly appeared by the butler’s feet. He reached out his hand and summoned two ice chains. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The butler felt his strength multiplying as soon as he manifested the ice chains. He was planning to attack Mo Fan from behind while the intruder was busy handling the Cursed Beasts, and immobilize him!

Mo Fan felt his back turning cold. He activated his Blood Tabi without hesitation.

The power in his legs increased significantly. Mo Fan rapidly dashed forward, dodging the ice chains, before sending the Cursed Beast that was trying to claw him flying with a kick.

“Piss off! Telekinesis: Scatter!”

A silver glow flickered around Mo Fan, and a repulsing force suddenly appeared, knocking the Cursed Beasts that were pouncing at Mo Fan flying, each vomiting fresh blood into the air!

The strength of the Space Element Basic Spell was dependent on the Magician’s spiritual force and control. In other words, a Magician’s Space Element would become stronger if the number of Nebulas or Galaxies in their Spiritual World increased. Since Mo Fan was now an Advanced Magician with Double Innate Elements, the strength of his Space Element Spells were basically doubled! The spell Telekinesis: Scatter was able to knock a bunch of Servant-class creatures flying with ease!

This highlighted the imperious nature of the Space Element. Even with a Basic Spell, as long as the Magician’s cultivation was powerful enough, it would be enough to drive ten thousand enemies away!

Mo Fan was still unfamiliar with using Telekinesis. If it was Ai Jiangtu using it, he would only need to cast the spell once to eliminate all the creatures!

“Damn it, how many Elements does this kid have?!” The butler was enraged.

“Fire, Summoning, Space, Shadow, and Lightning... he...he has...”

“Did I ask you to count, take him down now!” snapped the butler furiously.

Normally, a Magician disciple of the Black Vatican was slightly stronger than ordinary Magicians, mainly because of the Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts under their control. The assistance of the creatures was similar to having the Summoning Element, yet when their enemy was so strong that the number of Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts could barely buy them some time, the creatures no longer made much difference.

That being said, time was all they needed, as the manor would soon be crawling with a mutated army that was even stronger than the Dark Beast Monsters!

“Quick, summon everything you can!” Qin Ji was pointing his hands around like the butler.

“Senior, we’ve run out of Dark Beast Monsters,” a Gray Priest spoke up.

“Nonsense, don’t we have lots of them still?” The butler pointed at the bridge, and paused. He noticed a strange, scarlet-red wind massacring the Dark Beast Monsters on the bridge as he set his eyes on it.

The people of the Black Vatican initially thought the Swift Star Wolf was responsible for it, yet they realized the Swift Star Wolf had only killed around fifty Dark Beast Monsters at the other end of the bridge...

However, as the scarlet-red wind swept forward, even the Cursed Beasts were shredded into bloody mist in seconds. The butler had a blank face, as he could not understand what was going on.

When the scarlet-red wind finally arrived at the end of the bridge, he saw a slender woman in a red coat inside. Her hands were clenched into claws sharp enough to slice through steel. On top of that, she was incredibly fast when she attacked with the claws, so fast that it looked as if she was spinning like a tornado...

The woman was clearing a path in Mo Fan’s direction. The Dark Beast Monsters were like little bugs that she could easily pinch to death, leaving corpses stacked on top of one another behind her!

Mo Fan was kept busy by several Cursed Beasts attacking him simultaneously. They did not give him any chance to cast a spell. Mo Fan was forced to defend temporarily by setting up an electrical field to prevent the creatures from getting any closer. He was using Telekinesis to nullify the approaching attacks while waiting to strike with his flames!

However, he soon noticed a powerful presence getting closer.

The aura felt familiar yet strange at the same time. That being said, Mo Fan did not feel any hint of hostility, but a faint connection to it instead...

He turned around and saw the silhouette of a woman weaving through three Cursed Beasts. As she flung out her sleeves, a red mist encapsulated her.

Mo Fan saw an agile yet enormous red bat flying past the filthy Dark Beast Monsters and Cursed Beasts nimbly, and it landed beside him.

Before it touched the ground, Mo Fan saw the same mist appearing out of nowhere, out of which a pair of long, elegant legs extended, followed by a seemingly living red coat and a glamorous woman.

The pieces of clothing were moving rapidly, yet for an instant, Mo Fan thought he saw something spectacular. The woman was slender, yet busty and sexy in her own way!

“Mo Fan!” The woman with an alluring aura gave him a pure, innocent smile!

“Liu...Liu Ru!” Mo Fan was shocked.

It had been a long time since they last met. He almost failed to recognize her, as she looked like a completely different person!

Mo Fan looked behind Liu Ru and saw the corpses of Dark Beast Monsters covering the path. He could not believe that it was all her doing!
