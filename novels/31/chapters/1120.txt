“This is a Space Bracelet. I believe you’ve tasted Zorro’s strength first-hand. If he fights with his full strength, we won’t be able to take out his four teammates in the ten minutes we have. Therefore, I’ll use the Space Bracelet to transfer Zorro far away from where we’re fighting... it can only be used twice to send the man away, but I believe it’s enough for us to take out the rest of his team,” Asha’ruiya put the former hatred between the two teams behind and explained to Mo Fan in detail.

“If we have a magic tool like that, why don’t we just separate Zorro from his team and take him out? Wouldn’t it be easier to defeat the English team?” Nanyu said.

Asha’ruiya shook her head and said, “I’m more familiar with Zorro than you guys. Zorro is very good at reacting according to the situation. If we can keep him at bay and surround him, we do have a hope of taking him out, but if we don’t, even the nine of us have no chance of taking out that genius.”

“Is he really that strong?” Mu Tingying asked doubtfully.

“He’s only stronger than you imagine. It’s safer to just transfer him away and focus on his teammates first.”

Mo Fan finally agreed with the plan. Zorro was indeed very strong. Most of the injuries that Mo Fan had suffered were inflicted by the man. Mo Fan also had the feeling that the man was not even using his full strength.

“You’re a Sound Mage, right? After we transfer Zorro away, you will have to take out the Great Duchess, Ayleen. We can’t allow her to drag on the battle,” Asha’ruiya drew a tiny stick figure on the ground with a branch and said to Nanyu. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nanyu looked at Asha’ruiya in astonishment...

-Wasn’t this woman supposed to put all her attention on the election for the Goddess? Why does it seem like she’s extremely familiar with every participant in the tournament?-

Meanwhile, Mo Fan recalled that Asha’ruiya was an information vendor. There was almost nothing that she did not know. She could easily collect the information on their team, too!

“The Great Duchess has a piece of powerful magic equipment that can summon an illusion of a shark emperor. As long as it is still active, none of our destructive spells are going to touch even a single strand of their hair. In addition to it, Ayleen is also a Psychic Mage, so our only chance at stopping her from using that magic equipment is your Sound Element,” Asha’ruiya informed them.

-The illusion of a shark emperor...- Nanyu did hear rumors about it, but she never thought England would be willing to give a piece of incredible defensive equipment that even Super Mages would drool over to Ayleen. England had seriously invested a fortune in her!

“Mo Fan, I’ll cast Blessing Spells on you. Your job is to take this guy out, he’s a destructive Mage, and he has two pieces of defensive equipment...”

“You seriously know a lot of details. Can you tell me what color panties Ayleen is wearing today?” Mo Fan mused aloud.

Asha’ruiya glared at the pervert.

The two teams did not take long to prepare themselves. The alliance of the Chinese team and Greek team swiftly made their way toward the English team.

The English team was aware that the Greek team and Chinese team had stumbled into one another in the woods. They did not join the party, as they believed the two teams were surely going to fight due to the unresolvable conflict between them. However, they soon realized that something did not seem right. The two teams that were meant to be enemies were coming out from the woods like they were holding hands.

Zorro stuck his finger into his green hair as if he was having a headache.

“They did team up, as we suspected. No wonder there wasn’t a single spell being cast,” Herbert said.

“I have a bad feeling about this...” Zorro said.

“I doubt it; the Chinese team isn’t that strong, and the Greek team is lacking firepower too...” Hilton, the vice captain of the English team, countered.

Hilton was ranked seventh among the participants. He did not think the alliance of the two teams was a threat to their team.

“Let’s fight!” Zorro knew a battle was inevitable. His eyes were fixed on Asha’ruiya and Mo Fan.

Previously, it was him and Asha’ruiya flanking Mo Fan, but now, he was about to be flanked by them instead!

“Brother Mo Fan, don’t you think this woman here is playing us like a fiddle? Why don’t we team up and disqualify the Greek team first? There’s no need for us men to be treated like fools by this cunning woman,” Zorro suggested with a gentle smile.

“Your suggestion is convincing, but Asha’ruiya has promised me some wild fun tonight. It’s quite obvious that you can’t offer that to me, so I’m surely going to pay back the favor of leaving me with so many injuries just now!” Mo Fan replied.

Zorro’s smile widened upon hearing this. He said indifferently, “I see, that does sound like something that Asha’ruiya would do, but brother, if you don’t mind, I’m more than happy to spend the night with you too...HAHAHA!”

Mo Fan almost fell to the ground while he was charging forward fiercely. They always said that England had a lot of gays, and Mo Fan was starting to believe it now!

That being said, it was fairly obvious that Zorro was just teasing him. Mo Fan did not believe he was actually a homosexual.

Mo Fan exchanged glances with Asha’ruiya. The woman glided through the air and approached Zorro directly.

The Greek team had promised to take the lead in the battle, so the other three members proceeded to face their targets after Asha’ruiya made the first move.

The members of the Greek team were able to strengthen themselves with the Blessing Element. Despite their disadvantage in numbers, their strength was still rather impressive.

“Asha’ruiya, did you really promise to spend the night with him? I’m very sad about that; I’m the biggest supporter of your angelic face, and your alluring body,” Zorro added.

“Yeah, we even discussed what positions we are going to use... little genius, time to say goodbye!” Asha’ruiya did not seem bothered by the topic. She went even further with the joke.

Zorro initially had an indifferent grin on his face. However, his expression stiffened immediately when he saw the silver glow from Asha’ruiya’s wrist.

“That’s dirty!” Zorro cursed.

Zorro reacted quickly. He moved through the air with Wind Tracks to rapidly shift his position, leaving an unpredictable afterimage behind.

Zorro turned around and fled into the distance. However, the silver light emitted by Asha’ruiya’s bracelet was even quicker. It caught up to Zorro and constructed a tiny magic formation around the man!

The magic formation had clear edges and vortex drawn with silver lines. A complete Star Constellation was drawn up!

Zorro produced a huge tornado around him, trying to resist the Space Magic with the strong wind. However, the Space Magic was not an offensive spell, so it was useless setting up a defense against it. On the other hand, it was unlikely that he could outrun the magic either.

“You’re going to pay for that!” Zorro snapped furiously. His voice lingered in the air as he was transferred somewhere else!

The teleportation did not just send Zorro to a corner of the battlefield. It would also restrict Zorro’s movement, preventing him from making it back for a short period.

The alliance only had limited time after Zorro was sent away by Asha’ruiya. The Chinese team and the Greek team immediately attacked the remaining members of the English team fiercely!

“Tone: Kill!” Nanyu murmured, as the silhouette of a zither drawn with magic light appeared in front of her. Its murderous tones rapidly approached the Great Duchess Ayleen!

Ayleen was startled. She quickly set up a Water Curtain to defend against Nanyu’s Sound Element.

Unfortunately, the defense of the Water Element was not very effective against the attack of the Sound Element. Ayleen soon found herself in a pinch.

“Sound Disturbance!” Nanyu continued to apply pressure, murmuring chants to cast spells on Ayleen. Ayleen’s Psychic Element failed to stop the magical tones from penetrating her defense. Her brain was ringing so loud that she was struggling to use her magic equipment!

“Protect Ayleen!” Herbert yelled.

“Impossible, we can’t stop the Sound Element!” another member replied.

“Damn it, why does it feel like they are very familiar with us?”

Ayleen knew they were in trouble when Zorro was sent away.

The alliance of the Chinese team and the Greek team was not planning to suppress them. They were trying to knock them out in the ten minutes remaining, so their substitute members could not even join the match!

They were much more aggressive than the previous alliance formed to pick on the Chinese team!

“Mo Fan, we’ll fight Hilton together!” Asha’ruiya said.

A brilliant and colorful glow circled her body. Mo Fan immediately saw light pouring down on him from above. He felt that he could accumulate more magic when casting his spells, similar to the effects of a Domain, even though he had yet to unleash one!

“Lightning Explosion!” Mo Fan cast the Advanced Lightning Spell, firing two deadly beams at the English student named Hilton. The lightning beams crossed paths and exploded into crawling lightning arcs surging across the area within a few hundred meters.

Hilton was a destructive Mage too, yet he had no choice but to flee miserably from Mo Fan.

“Not bad, your Blessing Element is a lot stronger than our team’s,” Mo Fan said in satisfaction after seeing the damage of his Lightning Explosion.

“Your teammate didn’t learn it properly; mine is the real power of the Blessing Element. Use your Fire, I can raise its potency by fifty percent,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Sure!” Mo Fan asked Little Flame Belle to Possess him so he could control the Calamity Fire. He summoned a burning greatsword in his hands.

Asha’ruiya’s Blessing came fairly quickly. The burning sword that was around ten meters long suddenly grew to a length of twenty meters, and its flames were even fiercer!

The arrogant destructive Mage of the English team, Hilton, was completely dumbfounded when he saw the fiery sword!

-Is this really the World College Tournament still? Who would even slash at their enemy with a burning sword as tall as a six-story building!?-
