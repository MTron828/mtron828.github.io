3040 Blood Temple (2)

Not everyone died. The deaths were not random.

Only Salan and Yan Qiu knew that half of them were their own people!

“There are people around us watching us. The aura is strong!” The Chief Extraditor Yan Qiu was angry.

Salan stood still as the crowd fled. The aristocrats and magic officials were frightened. Who would have thought such a large-scale killing would occur in the Blessing Ceremony? Could it be that evil had invaded the Parthenon Temple?

!!

Blood was all over the floor. There were too many familiar faces in the pool of blood, but Salan did not look away from the stage. She was watching Ye Xinxia, who appeared indifferent.

Ye Xinxia also seemed to have spotted her. They looked at each other through the blood fog with unknown emotions.

After a while, Ye Xinxia slowly smiled. “We finally met,” she said to Salan, who was hiding in the crowd.

The smile looked innocent. She looked like a little girl who had no experience of what life was like. But Salan wasn’t fooled. She could feel the uncontrollable madness and terror in that smile.

“Ye Xinxia has gone crazy. We need to get out of here.” Salan did not stay any longer. She turned around and quickly hid in the fleeing crowd with Yan Qiu.

Under the stage, Ye Xinxia stood in a pool of blood with white crystal high heels. But she did not move at all. She just stood in the thickening pool of blood.

She stood there like a white ghost, and people could not feel the warmth and vitality of the Goddess. She looked more like a Grim Reaper, waiting for the heads to be thrown into her bag one after another. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

…

Salan and Yan Qiu walked hurriedly. Someone had been watching them.

That person had seen through their identities and was following them like a shadow for an opportunity to attack.

“How dare she do this? She started a massacre on the first day of Blessing Day. She is crazy!” Chief Extraditor, Yan Qiu, said angrily.

“She is also destroying the Parthenon Temple!” Salan saw Ye Xinxia’s eyes. The light shining in her eyes no longer belonged to her. She had become crazier than all the Red Cardinals!

This was the mountain of the Parthenon Temple. Those who were invited were people of high status in this society. Even if the members of the Black Vatican were among them, they were good citizens until their identities were exposed.

When Ye Xinxia took action against these members of the Black Vatican, Salan and the Supreme Pontiff knew that she wanted to exterminate the Black Vatican. But to ordinary people, it would only seem like she was massacring civilians!

The massacre of civilians in the Parthenon Mountain meant Ye Xinxia had gone crazy.

She had no evidence to prove that these people were members of the Black Vatican unless she announced to the world that she was the new Supreme Pontiff of the Black Vatican.

But she was also the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple! The Supreme Pontiff of the Black Vatican was the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple. If the truth got out, the Parthenon Temple would be beyond redemption!

Ye Xinxia’s action was the same as using the foundation of the Parthenon Temple for thousands of years to fight against the Black Vatican. This was crazy!

What kind of a force was the Black Vatican? What did the Parthenon Temple represent?

Ye Xinxia must be so stupid to make such a decision.

Looking back in time, the Black Vatican perished along with the Parthenon Temple at some point in history. But no matter what happened now, the Black Vatican would have won anyway.

“Is the old Supreme Pontiff behind this? Maybe she instructed Ye Xinxia to do this,” said the Chief Extraditor, Yan Qiu.

“The old Supreme Pontiff should be fleeing in panic like us right now,” said Salan coldly.

Ye Xinxia was crazy. She wanted everyone to die in the Parthenon Temple with her.

…

The road to the holy mountain was endless. Under the morning light, there was still an endless stream of people. They all yearned for the true gift of God.

Blessing Mountain was still far away. No one had noticed the massacre on the stage of Blessing Mountain. They were still trying to move forward, not knowing that they were walking to the altar of the white Grim Reaper.

“Why are you sure that woman is your first love? It’s not good for us to keep following her,” Mo Jiaxin asked Jiang Bin, the blindfolded man, beside him.

Jiang Bin smiled strangely. He patted Mo Jiaxin on the shoulder. “If I told you that I am from the Black Vatican and that woman is the target that I must eliminate, would you believe me?”

Mo Jiaxing was stunned. He looked at Jiang Bin in disbelief. “Didn’t you say you are a Knight?”

“Not today. Thank you, brother. It’s been a long time since I met a simple person like you.” Jiang Bin suddenly disappeared.

Mo Jiaxin was just an ordinary person. He did not have the sharp, observing eyes of a Mage.

He only saw a shadow rushing across a group of climbers as swiftly as a gust of wind. Then, a big splash of blood spurted from the woman they had been following!

The woman wore black clothes, but inside, she wore a long blue dress which was now dyed red. The people around her did not notice it at first as they thought it was the overturned red paint or spices. They walked forward while talking and laughing. After a while, screams erupted from the road to the mountain!

Mo Jiaxin could not believe his eyes at all. Someone was killed just like that. Less than a minute after it happened, the winding road to the mountain was filled with screams.

Mo Jiaxin could not see anything clearly, but he saw a similar black shadow moving in the crowd. Then, blood spurted. Some people fell into a pool of blood, some were stained with dirty blood, and some were screaming in fright.

Mountains and forests all had different tree species, so during the Flower Festival, they displayed different poetic and picturesque scenes that were intoxicatingly beautiful.

The climbing path of the Parthenon Temple was not dull because with every turn on the mountain path, one could get to enjoy a different scenery.

The mountain was a bit steep, and above it was a long mountain bridge leading to the front of Blessing Mountain. Below was the winding mountain road, crowded with people. It was like a scenic spot full of tourists.

The bright red blood flowed along the hillside, forming more than a dozen streams that slowly passed the long bridge above the mountain and overflowed to the plank road below.

On the plank road, people thought it was the holy dew of the female sages, but what dripped on their heads and shoulders was blood. The strong smell of blood roused instinctive fear in everyone’s heart.

“What happened?”

“Someone died at the front!”

“Someone also died in the back…”

“Don’t panic. Everyone, don’t panic!”

“Parthenon Temple will protect us!”
