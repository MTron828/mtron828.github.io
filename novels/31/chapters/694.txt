BANG!

A huge blast took place on the clock tower. The magnificent building almost collapsed from the force as Mo Fan, who had just slammed into it, kicked off it and shot out of the inner city like a brilliant ray of light, returning to the battlefield within the blink of an eye...

The light shocked the Mountain Zombie. It was utterly relieved after getting rid of an annoying pest, yet to its surprise, the demon had returned in just a few seconds!

What kind of body was that!?

A normal human would have died many times over by now, yet the guy was still charging toward him like he was unharmed!

“Cry of the Snow Mistress: Icy Rain of the Sorrowful World!”

President Han Ji finished channeling the third-tier Super Ice Spell under the protection of the other experts!

In the sky, the icy clouds combined into the glamorous figure of a sacred goddess. Her sorrowful tears turned into the most incredible piercingly cold snowstorm of the past hundred years...the air was frozen, the vast land was frozen, all living things were frozen!

The icy rain covered a great distance, most of them landed on the Mountain Zombie, which swiftly turned into a layer of ice covering its body.

The icy rain fell, and the snow stacked up into a mountain. The savage Mountain Zombie seemed to be suppressed by the Icy Rain of the Sorrowful World. Its movement gradually turned stiff as more and more of its body was covered in ice!

The clouds were frozen, the air was frozen, the ground was frozen. The Mountain Zombie standing tall was frozen, too. The process did not last for long...

“Under the throat, destroy its undead crystal!”

President Han Ji raised his pale face. His hair was white like snow, yet he still gathered his strength to say those words to Mo Fan, who was flying back to the battlefield!

Mo Fan swept through the sky. The flames trailing him spread into an ocean of fire...

He glanced at the frozen Mountain Zombie. He could tell that the creature was raising its arms, trying to protect the area under its throat, yet it was frozen by President Han Ji in the process.

Cry of the Snow Mistress: Icy Rain of the Sorrowful World. As expected of the man with the strongest cultivation among them, he had managed to suppress the Mountain Zombie at such a crucial moment!

The Mountain Zombie was breaking into pieces. Cracks began to surface on the ice.

Mo Fan knew it was his perfect chance. The flames engulfing him turned into purple-black lightning!

“Die!”

Mo Fan turned into a weapon covered in raging flames, a Soul Shadow, lightning, and runes as he pierced through the wound under the Mountain Zombie’s throat.

A formidable blood energy rose inside the Mountain Zombie’s body, shattering the ice covering its body with brute force...

However, the moment it broke free from the ice, the destructive light ray mixed with four different colors that Mo Fan had turned into pierced into it, right below the Mountain Zombie’s throat!

Its throat was already exposed after the attacks earlier. This time, it could no longer defend itself from the new attack that Mo Fan had executed with all his might!

Mo Fan simply flew from the front of the Mountain Zombie to the back. After a brief moment of darkness, he exited from the back of the creature’s neck together with a jet of blood under the light of dawn

The Mountain Zombie was trying to defend its weak point before it was frozen. After breaking free from the ice, it subconsciously grabbed its throat with its hands, yet it was completely useless...

It was holding the front of its throat, yet fresh blood was jetting out from the back of its neck...

As soon as Mo Fan landed on the ground, the rain of blood poured down from above and put out the flames and lightning engulfing him. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Mountain Zombie was swaying wildly. When the group thought it was about to collapse to the ground, the creature picked up a Corpse Official and squeezed it into the hole on its throat!

The spray of blood was stopped instantly. The Mountain Zombie seemed to have earned its second chance at life. It knocked the people around it away with the blood energy and fled north.

“It’s not dead yet!” Han Ji, the mysterious man, Zhu Meng, and the others inhaled deeply.

They were completely worn out from the battle, yet the Mountain Zombie was still alive after suffering such a deadly blow. The Magicians suddenly felt extremely decrepit.

“It’s running away... we have to kill it!” yelled Zhu Meng.

Mo Fan dodged the Mountain Zombie’s stomps. When he saw that the creature was fleeing into the north, he immediately switched the Soul Shadow on his back and chased after the creature by sprinting across the ground.

The Flame Belle Soul Shadow had granted Mo Fan the ability to control fire, while the Wolf Soul Shadow gave Mo Fan strong close combat capabilities.

Mo Fan was incredibly fast. He was sprinting through the ocean of undead like a werewolf. The undead army trying to stop him simply became his stepping stones!

Mo Fan kicked the head of a Flesh Mound Corpse Official with a great force and launched himself into the air, lunging at the Mountain Zombie that was running away.

The Mountain Zombie was running away, yet the ocean of undead was still around. The cunning creature would surely command the undead army to continue the assault on the city. The Mountain Zombie had to die!

In addition to Mo Fan, Councilman Zhu Meng, the mysterious man, Du Xiao, and Han Ji also chased after the Mountain Zombie.

The Mountain Zombie was indeed severely injured, but the death of an undead like the Mountain Zombie at its level was an obscure concept. If they did not kill it thoroughly, it would recover in no time and come back again.

Han Ji coughed heavily before saying to the group, “Kill it!”

Zhu Meng, the mysterious man, and Du Xiao nodded. Mo Fan did not carelessly venture forward when he saw the others chasing after the Mountain Zombie. He gathered the strength of the Wolf Soul Shadow on his legs and kicked forward, launching a fast-moving shockwave in the shape of a black crescent at the Mountain Zombie!

Zhu Meng did not hesitate further. The man whose energy was close to depletion simply took out his lightning spear. It emitted a blinding glow and flew in right behind Mo Fan’s black crescent.

The mysterious man and Du Xiao both cast a Super Light Spell. It was the same enormous light sword that came down from the sky...

This time, the Mountain Zombie had nowhere to run!

The destructive spells flew toward Mountain Zombie simultaneously, leaving it with no escape. Its eyes were filled with a grim light.

Suddenly, the Heaven and Earth shook vigorously!

A strange hole appeared behind the Mountain Zombie that was running away. It was like a black hole that was able to suck any kind of force into it. Mo Fan’s black crescent, Zhu Meng’s lightning spear, or the Demon Judgment Sword... the Hole of Chaos was sucking them all!

“Hole of Chaos...” Han Ji was stunned.

The others were dispirited too. All their attacks were sucked away by the Hole of Chaos that had appeared out of nowhere. They were so close to killing the Mountain Zombie!...

“Such a terrifying strength... it just drew all our attacks away like that!” The mysterious man’s eyes flickered with astonishment.

“There’s someone on the Mountain Zombie!” Mo Fan’s sharp eyes were immediately fixed onto the Mountain Zombie’s head.
