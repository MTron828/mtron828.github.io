Even Super Mages would be torn to pieces if they went too close to the battle between Mo Fan and the Black Dragon Emperor.

The Black Dragon Emperor had established its kingdom of death with the Dragon Locusts and the burning swamp of its blood. Asha’ruiya had endured great pain just to break into the battlefield.

Her face was extremely pale when she finally reached Mo Fan. However, her eyes were fixed on the Black Dragon Emperor. She was looking straight into its terrifying eyes!

“Austin, no one in this world can possibly control you, nor can they turn you into a soulless killing machine! You are Austin, the Emperor of the Kingdom of Clouds on Mount Tyrant. You are the noblest, strongest, and sincerest black dragon, the King of the Dragons. No one can ever bind you! You are the creator of magic, how could you be enslaved by magic instead!?” Asha’ruiya yelled at him.

It sounded like an ancient curse, but Mo Fan knew Asha’ruiya was merely voicing her beliefs.

The Black Dragon Emperor had been Wen Tai’s protector. It was her father’s guardian!

The Black Dragon Emperor had always been a senior to Asha’ruiya. She had flown across the world and enjoyed great views of the world under the starry sky with him when she was younger.

He might have been Wen Tai’s guardian, but he had always been free!

Even Wen Tai could not Bind his soul. How could a filthy and despicable man like Su Lu control him?

Their Contract was not intact!

Mo Fan had injured the black dragon, and his scales were covered in his blood. The dragon had gone berserk, but he had regained his self-awareness at the same time. The battle had awakened the black dragon’s true power, and a real black dragon could never be restricted by a flawed Contract!

Asha’ruiya stood in front of Mo Fan.

She was tiny compared to the Black Dragon Emperor. It was impossible to tell whether the black dragon could see her or hear her.

However, Mo Fan could sense the black dragon’s confusion. He was struggling internally!

The black dragon let out a furious roar, and soared into the clouds.

The overwhelming pressure faded away. It was not because the black dragon had withdrawn his murderous intent, but now he was no longer focusing on Mo Fan.

He had recognized Asha’ruiya. Perhaps he had remembered who Asha’ruiya was.

He had heard her screaming exhortation, too.

The black dragon would never be bound by a Contract. No one could ever control him!

The dragon had gone berserk because the man had given him a target to vent his anger on. That did not necessarily mean he had become the man’s slave!

His Contract was never solid in the first place. As the creator of magic, he had no trouble breaking the rules and restraints of the Contract!

The black dragon tore at himself with his claws, covering his scales with more blood, as if that was the only way to break free from the chains restricting him.

He was in great pain, but he was determined!

Mo Fan grabbed Asha’ruiya and threw them both into a different dimension when he saw the black dragon causing massive destruction in the area.

The storm stirred up by the black dragon’s blood spread over ten kilometers away. Mo Fan had no choice but to escape in the direction of Dubai City, which was protected by the Skybound Cloud Battlefield.

“Don’t do something so dangerous again next time,” Mo Fan looked at Asha’ruiya, who was already at her limit.

“Either way, I must thank you. If you hadn’t wakened Austin’s soul, he would have remained a slave to Su Lu,” Asha’ruiya replied feebly, smiling sincerely.

She had finally accomplished something she had long wanted to do!

Mo Fan could relate to it.

Asha’ruiya had brought him to Mount Tyrant to see the Black Dragon Emperor during the World College Tournament. She had tried to stop Su Lu from capturing the black dragon, too.

This time, she had come to him because she was planning to help the Black Dragon Emperor.

The others had called him the Black Dragon Emperor, but Asha’ruiya had called him by his name!

It was fine. Mo Fan was not the black dragon’s enemy. Su Lu was!

The black dragon was also not Mo Fan’s enemy. Su Lu was!

——

The Black Dragon Emperor’s roar echoed throughout the dark world outside the city.

He beat his wings and flew across the sky like a mountain, heading toward Dubai City!

Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya were astounded.

The Black Dragon Emperor flew over their heads like a dark cloud. He smashed through the Cloud Formation and entered the city.

“Is he awake, or is he still out of his mind?” Mo Fan asked.

“I...I don’t know either,” Asha’ruiya admitted.

The black dragon tore a hole in the clouds, revealing a huge portion of the city that had been protected by the huge Barrier.

He flew into the Barrier. Thousands of people screamed in terror.

The black dragon was covered in his own blood. He was like a floating volcano, bloody steam rising from his scales.

The people on the streets and in the buildings were terrified. Many fainted on the spot. Vehicles crashed into one another. The crowd fled for their lives.

The Black Dragon Emperor ignored them. He passed over the busy streets and headed for the tower that rose like a huge silver sword before him!

He continued on its way, gradually picking up speed!

The Black Dragon Emperor was going to crash into Dubai Tower. He seemed to have found the right target to vent his anger and hatred!

The tower had sent out more than half of the Asia Magic Association to set up a trap on Mount Tyrant. They had tortured his soul cruelly to subdue him!

It was time for them to feel the wrath of the black dragon!

The black dragon spread his wings and lunged at the upper half of the tower with its powerful claws.

The tower was protected by a powerful magic Formation, but it could not withstand the force of those claws.

The tower was pushed over as chunks of its upper half shattered into pieces. The floor cracked while the main pillars were damaged.

Glass, steel plates, concrete, and walls were smashed into pieces. The Black Dragon Emperor beat his wings and rose into the sky after causing massive destruction to the tower. The tower was not his only target.

Su Lu!

The Black Dragon Emperor was going after Su Lu!

The Black Dragon Emperor did not care how many casualties or survivors there were in the tower. His true focus was Su Lu!

Perhaps Su Lu and the Asia Magic Association should have known that this day would come eventually after they captured the Black Dragon Emperor. They should have known that they would have to suffer his wrath!
