Chapter 234 - Fiery Fist, Groundbreak!

“It can’t be wrong, it’s right here!” Luo Song’s expression sank, his gaze locked onto the darkness in front of him.

Bai Zangfeng and the other three disciples of different aristocratic families also turned serious as they prepared their magic.

“It stinks.”

“Yeah, who was it that so scared that they pissed themselves? How could it be so stinky otherwise?” Zhuang Lifeng said.

“Stop bullsh*tting. The Shadow Beast’s movements are very quick. Zhuang Lifeng, prepare your Plant Magic, you must stop the Shadow Beast.” Song Xia did catch a whiff of the strange stench, but she was more concerned about the Shadow Beast.

Zhuang Lifeng nodded. In his palms a deep green vine was moving around.

The green Star Path streaked past, the Plant Spell was prepared. They were only waiting for the Shadow Beast to appear…

At last, a grey silhouette appeared. It was as fast as wind when it ran. If it wasn’t for its tail that shone continuously, they wouldn’t have seen it.

At this moment, Bai Zangfeng also prepared the magic in his hand. His eyes were fixed on the Shadow Beast that was charging over.

A wall of odor came at them, as well. Originally, these people had a solemn look on their faces. However, once they caught a whiff of the odor, they nearly fainted from it. Bai Zangfeng, who had mysophobia, immediately began to vomit.

Suddenly, Zhuang Lifeng yelled out, “Heavens, what are these creatures?!”

Zhuang Lifeng was in the front, and he finally understood where that overwhelming stench was coming from. It was precisely from the large group of ghastly monkey faces with deformed black humanoid bodies in front of him!

These things formed a group, with some of them even crawling on the wall of the shadow maze. Some of them were rapidly rushing along on the ground, and some were even able to crawl upside down. There was a large number of them, and watching them gave the four of them goosebumps.

Zhuang Lifeng swore that he had never seen such ugly and more disgusting creatures in his whole life!

“Hurry up and get out of my way!” Song Xia’s face paled as she immediately yelled to the people behind her.

These people were all elites of the rookie students. Even after they saw this inconceivable scene, they wouldn’t just stand in one place dumbfounded. They began to escape into the surroundings, not daring to obstruct this group of black creatures that were rushing forth like a flood.

“Use Magic, hurry up and use Magic!” Bai Zangfeng screamed out strangely.

Bai Zangfeng had already started his Star Atlas. Between his two hands a chaotic wind was brewing.

Under the pressure from the Nyx Regime, the time Bai Zangfeng took to complete his Star Atlas was much slower than normal. The formation nearly fractured.

Finally, he still managed to complete the Wind Disc, Tornado!

The Tornado came forth, the cold gale spinning at a high speed and turning into a massive howling whirlwind. Those Dark Beasts in front that were charging over drove themselves right into the whirlwind and were flung into the air!

The black-skinned creatures began to fall down from the sky, one by one. As each one fell down, its bones shattered and its head smashed on the ground.

Bai Zangfeng’s Wind Disc, Tornado had offended the other Dark Beasts, who sent hostile looks over to indicate they not going to let him get away with it. The leftover Dark Beasts’ gazes locked onto him and his squad as they directly charged over.

“Do you have a pig brain? They were charging towards the Shadow Beast, so why are you provoking them?!” Song Xia loudly yelled at him from the side.

Bai Zangfeng’s Tornado, seemed to have only killed three Dark Beasts. If it were outside the Regime, then the Tornado would have been able to kill an entire area full of Dark Beasts without a problem. However, beneath the Nyx Regime, other Magic suffered from suppression. You would only be able to guarantee that your other Elements would not receive any kind of restriction if you possessed the Shadow Element!

Bai Zangfeng looked at the increasing numbers of Dark Beasts crawling out of the shadow maze, and was so scared that his stomach was doing flip-flops.

He never thought that there would be so many of these creatures. At this moment, the Dark Beasts’ eyes were like numerous stars as they fixed onto him.

“Escape, hurry up and escape!” one of his squad members yelled out.

“Zhuang Lifeng, hurry up, use your Intermediate Plant Magic!” Xia Song commanded.

Zhuang Lifeng didn’t dare to think about the order. He gave up the primary Plant Magic and immediately start to draw his Plant Star Atlas.

“Forest of Kun, Prison!” Zhuang Lifeng seemed to be an expert, as he was able to adeptly use his Magic while in danger.

However, his Forest of Kun, which originally would have been able to completely occupy the path within the dark maze, was weakened by the Nyx Regime. It was only able to seal a third of the path, leaving behind a clear gap that allowed the creatures to run by.

“Don’t panic, maintain the formation! Although there are quite a number of these creatures, they aren’t that powerful!”

“Sh*t, if it wasn’t for the Nyx Regime suppressing my power, I would definitely turn them all into dregs!”

There were flames in the eyes of Song Xia. They could see her standing at the very front of her team, displaying incredibly calm. She waited for the group of Dark Beasts to crawl through the gap of the Forest of Kun. Once they reached a certain distance, Song Xia yelled out as fierce flames came forth from beneath her feet. These flames completely wrapped around her body, and turned her into a human torch!

“Fiery Fist, Groundbreak!”

The Fiery Fist appeared in a circle and condensed on the wrist of Song Xia the instant she finished chanting the spell.

Her eyes flashed, and her burning fist fiercely drove down onto the ground beneath her feet.

The scalding energy instantly poured into the ground. They could see burning cracks quickly spreading through the ground towards the Dark Beasts.

Boooom!!

The surface of the ground disintegrated. Incredibly thick flames bubbled forth and turned into a Lotus Fire Break, filled with an aura of death as it exploded!

The range of the Lotus Fire Break was enormous, pillars of flames bursting through along the entire path. After those Dark Beasts charged into the area of the Groundbreak that had burst through the ground, were all sent flying. Furthermore, they were all burned to black ash before they could hit the ground.

Zhuang Lifeng and the other two members looked at the deadly lotus flames in front of them, their jaws dropping in astonishment, unable to close them.

This was their first time seeing Song Xia use her full power. The second level of Fiery Fist’s might was extremely astonishing. The Wind Disc, Tornado could only kill three of these creatures, yet the Fiery Fist, Groundbreak burned far more than just three right into ashes! Not to mention those that were still on fire!

“The Nyx Regime has suppressed our power too much. We have to scatter, there are still a lot of these creatures! We can’t kill them all,” Xia Song said to her squad members grimly.

Everyone else naturally listened to this older sister. They quickly took advantage of the time the Fiery Fist, Groundbreak was still burning to flee!

------

As Bai Zangfeng and Xia Song turned around, emerged a human shadow emerged on the wall of the dark maze.

He watched the five people who were already leaving, and then turned his gaze around. He directly locked onto the large group of Dark Beasts that were trapped within the Forest of Kun and Fiery Fist. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I’ll gift you one more move!”

His gaze flashing, the fire appeared as though it had combusted.

Rose-colored blood red flames scuttled forth from beneath his feet. In the Nyx Regime, his flames did not appear to have been affected, and the flames had reached a critical point!

As the energy reached its climax, it felt like an angry god was about to explode through his fist!

Rose Flames-

Fiery Fist-

Groundbreak!!!!!!

“Die! All of you!”

These flames were flames of vengeance! Their might was many, many times stronger than the Groundbreak from the girl from before!

A large number of the Dark Beasts were instantly reduced to ashes when smashed by the Rose-imbued Groundbreak flames. Miserable shrieks began to rise within the dark maze!
