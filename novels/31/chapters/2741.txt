Chapter 2742: Exposing One’s Malicious Intention

??

“Ahhh!” Ruan Feiyan awoke screaming. She was drenched in sweat. It felt like she had had a nightmare.

When she saw Mo Fan and the pool that was now dried up, she wished she was back in her nightmare.

And Ruan Feiyan almost passed out again.

“Given that you’ve provided me with the information about the precious Underground Holy Spring, I’ll be quick when executing you, lest you suffer,” said Mo fan calmly.

Ruan Feiyan could not breathe. She fainted once more. She became slack but remained upright bound by Mo Fan’s thorns of shadows.

Mo Fan sighed. “She had such a low level of resilience.”

People should frequently venture out and fight through setbacks to toughen themselves. Otherwise, they would end up like Ruan Faiyan, who fainted so easily at minor inconveniences.

Ruan Feiyan had wanted to stall Mo Fan for at least a time until she could alert the others. She had wanted to charm him and slow him down. But Mo Fan had dried up the pool at once.

“Let’s go. We’ve had enough of the holy spring essence. It’s time to settle accounts with the people on this island.” Mo Fan patted his chest as he walked out of the big stone door.

Mo Fan had taken away the most precious thing on the island. There was no need to continue to stay. As for Ruan Feiyan, she was going to go crazy. He left her in the Underground Holy Spring to fend for herself.

As soon as he stepped out of the door, the guard outside had changed shifts. The previous lady with a silvery voice was replaced by a man in a diagonally buttoned brocade coat.

The stone door closed, and the man had no idea that Ruan Feiyan was still inside.

“W-Who are you? Where did you come from? You can’t come here without permission. Aren’t you afraid of being punished by the grannies?” The man in the brocade coat questioned Mo Fan.

The man was more surprised than angry. Outsiders did not pay a visit to Lichen Afterglow Island. As a result, people were very laid back. People would only grow weaker if they continued to stay within their comfort zone!

Mo Fan recognized him to be the same man who had previously invited his female junior to stroll on the streets or to “work out” with him. Mo Fan raised his eyebrow and looked at the man.

“How long have you been “strolling on the street” with your junior?” Mo Fan asked.

It had taken Mo Fan thirty minutes since he had entered the Underground Holy Spring, sucked the spring dry, imprisoned Ruan Feiyan, cultivated a breakthrough through the barrier and achieved third grade in his Lightning Element.

“Half an hour… Who exactly are you? Why are you here? I’ve never seen you before. Are you new here? Or…” The man in the brocade coat finally sensed something was wrong. It certainly took him a while to realize that Mo Fan was an intruder.

“You appear just in time. You will lead me to those who rule this island,” Mo Fan said.

“Who do you think you are?!” The man in the brocade coat shouted angrily!

Dong! Dong! Dong!

The stone door behind them opened. Ruan Feiyan staggered out supporting herself on the wall. She looked pale and exhausted.

When the man in the brocade coat saw Ruan Feiyan in that state, he was enraged. She was his goddess!

“Scum! You scum! I’m going to slaughter you!” The man in the brocade coat then came up with a wind element star constellation.

The man in the brocade coat cast an advance-level wind element magic—Wind Wings. Countless silver-bladed wings-like wind appeared behind his back. He then pointed them at Mo Fan, and the silver blades flew forwards.

Mo Fan took a step and vanished, leaving a film of bright diamond star dust on the ground. He then appeared behind the man and patted his shoulder. Lightning flashed through the man’s body as though tiny electrified snakes were crawling over his body. The man in the brocade coat twitched violently, foaming at his mouth.

“Y-You… I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!” Ruan Feiyan was furious. Her scarf and conical hat come off. She charged at Mo Fan with hair flying.

“It’s best if you show me the way. After all, I’m not close to this guy. By the way, do you know him? I saw him sleeping with your junior who previously cultivated at the Underground Holy Spring. I suppose they only spent about five minutes or so…” Mo Fan said to Ruan Feiyan.

Ruan Feiyan was no match for Mo Fan. Mo Fan played tricks on her using his Chaos element, and she nearly went insane. He insulted her verbally to provoke her even more. The paralyzed man on the ground was now spitting blood.

“Don’t ever think that you can leave Licheng Afterglow Island in one piece! You have no idea how powerful our grannies are. You are an idiotic invader! You’ll be torn to shreds! Grannies will tear your stomach open and redeem the holy spring essence!” Ruan Feiyan screamed at him.

“To my ancestors, please forgive me for running into such a filthy and despicable man. Never, ever spare him, even if he dies!” Ruan Feiyan cursed him.

Mo Fan scratched his ears. He sighed. Even her curses were weak and annoying.

“Obtaining the holy spring essence is just the first step, and you’re already hysterical. What will you do when I defeat your grannies, destroy the ancient statues and sink your island?”

Ruan Feiyan fainted again. Mo Fan sighed. ‘I spit out my first sentence and you are already on the ground…’

...

After leaving the Licheng Afterglow Island spiritual realm, Mo Fan took to the streets. Meanwhile, Ruan Feiyan awoke once again as a soft breeze blew on her. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A sweet-looking young woman was walking the street eating her tanghulu happily. The moment she noticed the man walking in front of her, the tanghulu tasted repulsive.
