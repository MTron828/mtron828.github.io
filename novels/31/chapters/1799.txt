“This Receiver Crystals are of the Earth Element. Such a pity, you’re lacking a very important condition. Otherwise, I could make something good for you!” Feng Zhoulong said.

“What is it?” Mo Fan promptly asked.

“A Devouring Seed! Ordinary Spirit-grade Seeds and Soul-grade Seeds are masses of energy gathered over a long time, nurtured by nature. If Magic Tools and equipment could grow by absorbing energy, why can’t Soul Seeds that contain the presence of life?” Feng Zhoulong conjectured.

“An upgradeable Soul Seed?” Mo Fan stared at Feng Zhoulong. He was quite impressed by the man. This old Mage of the Research Union was like the creator of a magic world! No wonder Dean Xiao thought so highly of him, and kept asking him to develop a close relationship with the old man. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Mm, but no one is willing to offer me these valuable Receiver Crystals for the experiment, but I believe I have the skills to do it,” Feng Zhoulong said.

“Ugh... you’re telling me it’s only theory now?” Mo Fan had to ask.

“Yes, but it’s plausible. I once met someone with an Innate Talent like that. It could absorb other Soul Seeds to strengthen his Soul Seed,” Feng Zhoulong went on.

“Is there really such an insane Innate Talent?” Mo Fan gasped.

“It’s such a pity,” Feng Zhoulong sighed.

“What do you mean? You’ve already said that twice!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

“You’re not an Earth Mage. If you had the Earth Element, I could make an Earth Element Devouring Seed for you. The crystals you have are not enough to craft a Growable Magic Equipment, but it’s enough for a Devouring Seed. You are a bold man, so I wouldn’t hesitate to experiment with it on you,” Feng Zhoulong went on.

Mo Fan hesitated for a moment. He wondered if he should tell Feng Zhoulong that he was now an Earth Elementalist.

“Is the Devouring Seed that impressive? Is it stronger than the Spirit-grade Seeds and Soul-grade Seeds after it’s upgraded?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yes, of course, and not just by a small margin! You should know that once a Soul-grade Seed replaces a Spirit-grade Seed, you’ll lose the attributes and additional effect of the Spirit-grade Seed. Since the additional effects of Soul Seeds are very useful, it’s quite a great loss to lose them when upgrading between Soul Seeds.

“The power of the Devouring Seed is its ability to preserve the additional effects when it’s upgraded. Not only that, the additional effects will grow stronger, too! The person who I mentioned with the Innate Talent, do you know how many additional effects his spells have? Three! Even a Basic Spell has three additional effects! That’s insane!” Feng Zhoulong exclaimed.

A spell with three additional effects!

It was Mo Fan’s first time hearing about anything like it!

Normally, only high-quality Soul-grade Seeds would have an additional effect. For example, Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant’s additional effect was the Lightning Tyrant Scars. His other Soul-grade Seeds did not have any additional effect.

The Meteor Scarlet and Ardent Sunset’s ability to spread and grow stronger the further they traveled was part of their traits, instead of an additional effect. The additional effect of a Soul-grade Seed would inflict a special burn or tag the target with a unique seal after attacking the target.

“If I say I’ve Awakened the Earth Element with an innate additional effect, does that mean it will add a special effect after the Devouring Seed reaches the Spirit-grade, and another special effect when the Devouring Seed is upgraded to the Soul-grade, so three special effects in total?” Mo Fan asked.

“Yeah, but what a pity...” Feng Zhoulong sighed again.

“Enough, come, I’ll be your guinea pig!” Mo Fan clenched his teeth. He had completely sold himself to Feng Zhoulong!

“No, no, you have to be an Earth Mage first. These crystals are of the Earth Element. It won’t work with other Elements,” Feng Zhoulong told him sadly.

“Look at this.” Mo Fan waved his hand indifferently, Summoning a curtain of sand.

Feng Zhoulong’s eyes widened when he saw Mo Fan’s spell.

“You...you have reached the Super Level!” Feng Zhoulong exclaimed. “And you’ve Awakened the Earth Element!”

“That’s right!” Mo Fan nodded.

“Wait, the color of your magic... an innate additional effect?” Feng Zhoulong exclaimed once again, finally realizing what Mo Fan was referring to. “Three additional effects, three additional effects, HAHAHA, that means we can easily have three additional effects when the Devouring Seed reaches the Soul-grade!”

“Old Feng, I’ll leave myself in your hands for these few days. I have a duel to fight soon, and my dignity as a man is at stake. You are going to determine if I can win the duel on the day,” Mo Fan proclaimed loudly.

“People like us who are dedicated to the research of magic mostly lack resources and absolute trust. Businessmen keep promising to sponsor us, yet they won’t provide us with the best resources since they were scared of losing everything if our experiments fail. If you dare to give these Receiver Crystals to me, I can guarantee you that you will be able to make a name for yourself with an Earth Element that has three additional effects!” Feng Zhoulong burst out laughing. Mo Fan was indeed his favorite guinea pig: he dared to take the risks that others were not able to bear!

“That’s true, I knew you were reliable when you got me the Dark Material... Oh, may I ask, what the price of these crystals in the market is?” Mo Fan asked.

“These crystals? I bet you could sell them for fifty million each. Considering the number of crystals you have, you would have no problem buying a tier-three or tier-four city! Most importantly, the buyer has to know its value, and be able to turn them into useful products. Speaking of which, without these rare materials, there won’t be any products, either. There are only a limited number of Growable Magic Tools and equipment in the whole country,” Feng Zhoulong told him.

“Ugh... Old Feng, maybe I should consider it again, I was too excited just now.” Mo Fan’s body twitched after hearing the price of the crystals!

The crystals were enough to buy a small city!

No wonder Apas was treating them so preciously, they were insanely valuable!

“Oh Mo Fan, how can you go back on your own promise? Weren’t you saying how much you trusted me just now!?” Feng Zhoulong exclaimed.

“I can already buy a Heaven-grade Seed with the money, why would I bother with having three additional effects!? Don’t you know how short on funds I am after reaching the Super Level,” Mo Fan promptly rejoined.

“Brother Mo Fan, can’t you be more ambitious? A Heaven-grade Seed might be impressive, but think about it, if you can upgrade the Devouring Seed to the Heaven-grade one day, how insane would your Earth Element be? Four additional effects!” was the immediate reply.
