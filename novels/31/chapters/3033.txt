3034 You’re the Supreme Pontiff, Right?

The Hall Mother remained silent. Ye Xinxia was smarter than the Hall Mother had expected. She just never showed her wisdom freely.

“I’m just letting you know. Let’s move on to the second thing.” Ye Xinxia knew that the Hall Mother, Pamise, would not admit it even if she was right.

“Ye Xinxia, let me teach you the last lesson before the official day you become a goddess. Don’t reveal everything that’s on your mind until you have full control of the situation. The Forbidden Elder of the Parthenon Temple is still obeying my orders. You’d better stop talking and go back to your place now. From now on, think clearly about what you want to say!” The tone and attitude of Hall Mother, Pamise, changed.

The goddess also had to play dumb. The Hall of Knights was powerful. Would those knights who had obtained the Divine Souls be as glorious as the sun?

!!

However, there were still nine Hidden Clans in the Parthenon Temple, and the Tulce family was just one of them. The nine Hidden Clans all obeyed the orders of the Hall Mother. While they did not manage all the affairs of the Parthenon Temple, they continued to influence it constantly.

They were the foundation of the Parthenon Temple! Wen Tai and Izisha came from these Hidden Clans!

“Let’s talk about the second thing.” Ye Xinxia remained calm.

“Ye Xinxia, if you don’t stop asking, I don’t mind waiting another ten years to train another goddess. I will behead you now for the crime of colluding with the Black Vatican, and your funeral will be at dawn!” Hall Mother Pamise stood up angrily like a winter storm.

Outside the Hall Mother Pavilion, several figures appeared from the forest, and they were approaching slowly. They were dressed in black robes and showed a strong aura that made the female attendants and sages tremble in fear.

These people were many times stronger than those titled knights! The pavilion was still silent. Ye Xinxia was still standing there, unwilling to compromise.

Hall Mother Pamise had already stood up. She looked down at Ye Xinxia, who was still sitting down. Ye Xinxia could tell she was angry. The Hall Mother’s breath came rapidly, and her eyes narrowed in rage.

“Hall Mother, if you wanted to kill me, why didn’t you do so twenty years ago? I clearly remember that you wore a huge robe at that time. Your hand under the wide sleeves was clean. It also had a red agate ring.”

“My mother and I had nowhere to escape. If you wanted to kill me, why didn’t you do so at that time?” Ye Xinxia suddenly asked.

Hall Mother, Pamise, suddenly trembled. Her anger dissipated immediately. Hall Mother, Pamise, slowly sat back in her seat.

Outside the pavilion, there were some footsteps, but the Hall Mother, Pamise, waved her hand to signal for the members of the Hidden Clans to retreat. Then, the Hall Mother, Pamise, set up an isolation barrier and covered the pavilion in the mist.

The outside world would not know what happens inside. After Hall Mother Pamise set up the barrier, she took a deep breath.

Suddenly, Ye Xinxia heard a burst of laughter. Hall Mother, Pamise, let out a hearty laugh that she seemed to have suppressed for a long time.

“Amnesia Bug is no longer effective on you?” Hall Mother, Pamise, chuckled.

“I killed the Amnesia Bug after Izisha framed me as Red Cardinal Salan. I know who I am and what kind of inheritance I have received. I should thank you,” Ye Xinxia said to Hall Mother, sincerely.

“You don’t need to thank me. You should thank your mother for dedicating such a perfect piece of jade like you to me.” The tone of the Hall Mother, Pamise, was much gentler than before.

“But she still betrayed you,” Ye Xinxia said.

“Ye Chang has never been loyal to me from the beginning. She always has her plans. The thing she wants to do the most is to see my true face and then cut my throat,” said Hall Mother, Pamise. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Pamise got up from her seat, followed the glass steps, and walked to Ye Xinxia step by step.

She looked at Ye Xinxia carefully. She looked at her face and eyes and deliberately stood a little far away to watch her.

After a long time, Pamise showed a satisfied smile. “Ye Xinxia, you are beyond our expectations. You are beyond Wen Tai’s expectations, Salan’s expectations, and my own expectations.”

“I haven’t asked you any questions yet,” said Ye Xinxia.

“You can ask, but I won’t answer you,” said Hall Mother, Pamise.

“You’re the Supreme Pontiff, aren’t you?” Ye Xinxia asked solemnly.

Supreme Pontiff. The noble Supreme Pontiff of the Black Vatican.

There would always be a huge robe covering her figure and appearance. Because of her solemn and indifferent temperament, all the Red Cardinals prostrated on the ground and listened to her teachings and instruction.

But who knew the real identity of the Supreme Pontiff?

Almost everyone in the Black Vatican was hiding somewhere in the world. They may be employees in the office, members of the Magic Association, or leaders in politics. Before they revealed their true identities, they were no different from the public. This was why it was hard to get rid of the Black Vatican. Before they revealed their evilness, they might even be the kindest and most trustworthy people that one knew in their lives.

The concealment of the identity of a Black Clergy had caused the Enforcement Union, the Magic Association, and the Holy Judgment Court to suffer, not to mention the Blue Deacon, the Head Teacher, the Red Cardinal, the Chief Extraditor, and even the Supreme Pontiff!

The real identity of the Supreme Pontiff was the biggest secret in the world! Even Salan was frantically looking for the traces and the real identity of the Supreme Pontiff.

Ye Xinxia talked with Mera about Izisha.

Izisha had guessed the whole thing, but she still missed out on some key details.

Izisha accused Ye Xinxia of being the Supreme Pontiff.

She told Ye Xinxia that there was another evil soul in her body, which was caused by the Amnesia Bug. Many important members of the Black Vatican had an Amnesia Bug. They would forget their identity as members of Black Vatican, and they would not wake up until a certain moment.

Ye Xinxia did have an Amnesia Bug. The Amnesia Bug devoured her childhood memories. She could not remember the days when she and her mother fled.

But after Ye Xinxia was put on trial, she realized she had lost an important memory. She had to restore those things that had been devoured by the Amnesia Bug to figure out the whole thing.

She got rid of the Amnesia Bug. Every time she fell asleep, those childhood memories slowly came back.

Ye Xinxia asked Mo Jiaxin about some details about Bo City to confirm whether something she had seen earlier was real or not. She wanted to confirm that she wasn’t confusing it with her dream.
