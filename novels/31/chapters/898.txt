“Do you seriously think you are unstoppable after joining the Black Vatican? They are nothing but a piece of trash in aMagician’s eyes, and as for you... maybe scum suits you better.” Mo Fan’s eyes did not show the slightest hint of mercy or compassion.

Another bolt of lightning descended onto Zhao Pinlin out of nowhere. The dazzling light lit up the whole dungeon.

Zhao Pinlin was struck by the lightning. The purple-black bolt of lightning sliced his body in half like a sword or axe. The two halves were immediately disintegrated into blood lumps and droplets under the overwhelming power of the lightning...

Zhao Pinlin was shattered to the limit. He literally became the waste that Mo Fan had mentioned!

Guo Wenyi and Rong Sheng’s faces were filled with astonishment when they saw Mo Fan’s sudden display of his overwhelming strength.

Their understanding of Magicians was basically similar to Zhao Pinlin’s level. They only knew that some Magicians were hired as bodyguards, yet they had never seen a powerful Magician who could easily destroy an enemy with a single wave of his hand like Mo Fan!

“Take care of her for me,” Mo Fan turned around and reminded the two with gaping eyes and mouth.

“Al...alright!” Rong Sheng immediately nodded. His admiration for Mo Fan skyrocketed instantly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Mo Fan found himself in a zigzagging tunnel after he left the dungeon. Lingling only told him the rough direction of the Queen of the Sudden-Death Poison, so Mo Fan had to probe his way around the place like he was currently in a maze!

Mo Fan followed the visible lights emitted by candles, which clearly shone his silhouette on the wall. He quickly moved past the lit-up area, and as he blended in with the shadows, he completely disappeared into the darkness. It was impossible to detect his presence.

As Mo Fan left the dungeon, he arrived in a straight and long corridor. The walls were quite far apart, with lights symbolizing the Black Vatican lighting up the path.

The corridor was too dark to see the other end. However, Mo Fan had already discovered a few people in black outfits moving in the darkness.

Mo Fan knew he had no chance of sneaking through the corridor with the Fleeing Shadow. He blatantly strode along the corridor.

“Who’s there?!” snapped Gray Priest Lu Geng, his sharp eyes immediately noticing Mo Fan’s presence.

The other disciples in black outfits immediately gathered, accompanied by eight Dark Beast Monsters under their command. They instantly blocked off the direction Mo Fan was heading to!

“Someone who’s here to send you all to Hell!”

Mo Fan stood still. The members of the Black Vatican did not notice the fire burning fiercely on his right hand.

Initially, the fire was only the size of the flames of the candles nearby. However, as he threw a punch forward, the spacious corridor was immediately filled by the fire. The enormous burning fist almost burst the corridor open!

The Fiery Fist was unstoppable. Both the disciples of the Black Vatican and the Dark Beast Monsters under their command had no chance of surviving against Mo Fan’s fourth-tier Fiery Fist. Their flesh and bones were burned into powder under the incredible heat of the Rose Flame.

The corridor was cleared in an instant. The Gray Priest was barely left alive along the scorched trail more than a hundred meters long. His skin was burned beyond recognition as he climbed to his feet. He immediately fled for his life desperately!

“Come over here!” Mo Fan summoned a Mind Claw with a thought.

Gray Priest Lu Geng was dragged all the way back forcibly and dropped in front of Mo Fan.

Lu Geng raised his head and looked at Mo Fan in fear.

“Do you know you are worth nine million?” said Mo Fan.

Lu Geng was stunned.

Anyone would be stunned in Lu Geng’s position. They were still in the Black Vatican’s base, yet a young man had appeared out of nowhere and threw a Fiery Fist at them before they understood what was going on!

“I...” Lu Geng tried to act humbly, just so this terrifying murderer would spare his life.

Unfortunately, he did not have the chance to finish his sentence, as Mo Fan was already pouring some liquid onto his head.

Lu Geng totally lost his mind when he saw the bottle. Wasn’t this the bottle that he gave Yang Qiao to clean up corpses? How did it end up in his hand...

Gray Priest Lu Geng started to melt as soon as the liquid was poured onto him.

Lu Geng had poured the same chemical onto people that were still alive in the past. He always felt excited when he heard their screams at the top of their lungs, to an extent that he had to make love with Yang Qiao a couple of times on the same night just to release his excitement. However, he never thought he would be the one that screamed the loudest. The enormous pain he felt from the process significantly overcame the total pleasure and excitement he felt from using it in the past!

Mo Fan was not in a great mood. He was having trouble venting his anger and frustration after what happened to Mu Ningxue, and it just so happened that he had the chance to kill a bunch of scum as a way to serve justice. It was definitely his favorite course of the meal!

The corridor no longer had anyone blocking Mo Fan’s path after he cleared it with a single punch.

After advancing for another two hundred meters, Mo Fan arrived before a giant red doorway. It was designed as fangs, the kind that could close up perfectly. When opened, the entrance would resemble a fierce beast with its bloody mouth wide open.

The entrance seemed to be half-open. Mo Fan easily snuck into the room and realized it was a relatively spacious Chamber of Sacrifice. Skulls of various kinds of creatures were placed on sticks hanging in rows across the hall.

On top of that, beyond the rows of skulls, a huge crowd of disciples in black outfits were kneeling before an altar under the commands of several Gray Priests...

“Yo, having a meeting here?” Mo Fan stood behind the strange and passionate crowd, looking at the buttocks of the disciples that were facing him. “It’s fine, saves me time from looking for you individually!” Mo Fan put on a grin.

Mo Fan immediately channeled a brilliant and stunning Star Constellation without giving the stunned members of the Black Vatican any chance to speak!

Mo Fan’s speed at channeling a Star Constellation had improved dramatically. The seven Star Patterns with densely packed Stars were connected fluidly, and in just a moment, the whole Star Constellation was visbile to the crowd, further setting off Mo Fan’s sturdy figure!

“Sky-Flame Funeral, you can enjoy the taste of Hell before you actually go to Hell!” Mo Fan delivered two fiery clouds into the space above the spacious, high-vaulted Chamber of Sacrifice.

The fiery clouds rapidly filled up the space. They began to descend when they finally reached their limit.

There was nowhere to hide from the rain of fire at all, as the clouds were so close to them.

A blinding red light was emitted from the waves of the burning ocean. The petty members of the Black Vatican were fleeing from the ritual of flames...

In their eyes, the lives of the others were mere trifles. The truth was, they were as insignificant as the people they killed, especially when they were going up against an Advanced Magician like Mo Fan!

The members of the Black Vatican who were scorched black in just a few seconds would never believe that the man in front of them was only a high school student who had barely been able to protect himself in Bo City, the town they targeted so many years ago.

But now, the man and his vengeful flames were able to annihilate a huge crowd of them with ease!
