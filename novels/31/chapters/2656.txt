Chapter 2658: Flying Thunder Sunken Ground

“Hand it over and you can at least leave this place alive!” Zhao Jing demanded of Mo Fan.

The Sharkman Chieftain was a Supreme Ruler, on par with the Black Totem Snake. Even Zhao Jing was no match for such a powerful creature.

His uneasy tone hinted that he did not want to confront the Sharkman Chieftain. He might die in an instant fighting a creature of its level!

Mo Fan stepped forward and stared at Zhao Jing. “Let’s all die together. It’s up to the Heavens who’s going to get the Earth Flame Pistil in the end!”

Mo Fan was not wearing any expression, as if he had the situation under control. But the truth was that he was extremely nervous!

The Sharkman Chieftain had even bitten the Black Totem Snake. Not many of them would escape from the creature once it came close to them.

Mo Fan was still not strong enough to take on a Supreme Ruler. The problem was that Zhao Jing was obviously not going to let them leave so easily!

They would never hand over the Earth Flame Pistil. Zhao Jing was not the kind to contribute to the country. Even Zhao Manyan had said he was nothing but a jerk!

“Do you think I can’t take you out before the Sharkman Chieftain arrives? I’ll kill you first and wring that young woman’s neck!” Zhao Jing snarled.

The arrival of the Sharkman Chieftain was putting everyone under tremendous pressure. Even though it was still several dozen kilometers away, everyone felt like they were about to suffocate, as if a huge shadow was looming over them.

Zhao Jing did not expect these people to be so tenacious, either. He glanced at Zhao Manyan, whom he had injured.

To his surprise, Zhao Manyan had already recovered from his injuries. Zhao Jing grew even more anxious when he saw Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan standing together with determined faces.

“The Parthenon Temple’s Blessing Element?” Zhao Jing instantly realized the woman who was riding the unicorn had healed Zhao Manyan with the Blessing Element.

Xinxia had used the Healing and Blessing Elements to heal Zhao Manyan while Mu Bai was fighting Zhao Jing. She had also healed the internal injuries Zhao Manyan had sustained from the Lightning Magic Formation. He looked perfectly fine now!

Xinxia had also cast a Praying Light on everyone after treating Zhao Manyan’s injuries, quickly healing the injuries they had sustained from the Lightning Magic Formation. Mu Bai’s condition was supposed to be the worst, but he was perfectly fine now. He was glaring at Zhao Jing, as if he could still fight several dozen rounds with him!

Zhao Jing’s expression darkened.

He did not expect the group to have someone who was so good at the Healing and Blessing Elements. It meant the Lightning Magic Formation he had prepared and the powerful spells he had unleashed were all for nothing. These people had already fully recovered from their injuries!

Zhao Jing would not have been so angry if the woman only had the Healing Element. The Healing Element could not heal certain injuries, including internal damage inflicted on a person’s mind and soul.

However, the Blessing Element was different. It could replenish the energy of a Mage and heal internal injuries of the mind and soul!

Mo Fan, Zhao Manyan, and Mu Bai had also fully replenished their mana, as if they had never been involved in a fight.

On the other hand, Zhao Jing had already expended some of his energy. The Lightning Magic Formation had consumed most of his Lightning Magic. He would be panting heavily if he used another Lightning Spell.

“Swift Thinking!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Xinxia Cast another Blessing Spell, and a lively melody played in Mo Fan, Mu Bai, and Zhao Manyan’s ears. The special melody was able to change the tempo of their Spiritual World. They were able to connect their Stars much more swiftly!

On top of that, the Stars seemed to have their own consciousness. The trio no longer had to control their Stars. They would connect on their own to form the necessary patterns and structures.

A brilliant Star Palace emerged from the ground, filled with the strong presence of magic!

“Holy crap, it’s so fast!” Zhao Manyan exclaimed.

They were able to Cast Super Spells as casually as Advanced Spells. However, even though they no longer had to construct the standard Star Palaces, they still had to inject lots of energy into their spells. The Star Palaces were providing the spells with energy, like huge steam engines.

If they were able to construct Star Palaces at the speed of constructing Star Constellations without compromising their energy, they no longer had to be afraid of Mages with higher cultivation than them! They could even take on Ruler-level creatures of the same level as them!

The need to Channel a spell had always been a huge weakness of Mages. If they could shorten the time needed to Channel a spell, they would be a lot more powerful, as long as they had enough energy!

“Come, see if you can break my defense again! I don’t mind replacing my surname with yours!” Zhao Manyan said confidently.

If two layers of defense were not enough, he would make three or even four layers! He had plenty of defensive spells. If they were still not enough, he did not mind taking some hits since Xinxia was with them. Even if he died, Xinxia could just bring him back to life with the Spell of Resurrection!

“You two already have the same surname,” Mu Bai whispered.

Zhao Manyan rolled his eyes at Mu Bai. Why the Hell is he talking so much? “Mo Fan, go do your thing. I’ll take care of you!” Zhao Manyan shouted.

“Alright!” Mo Fan was now fully covered in arcs of lightning, which had attached to his body like bright scales. It looked like he had draped a lightning cloak over his shoulders as he sprinted across the mountainside.

Since his Lightning Acupuncture Points were activated, every step he took unleashed thousands of lightning arcs in all directions, filling up the entire area!

“Flying Thunder Sunken Ground!”

Mo Fan ran toward Zhao Jing at literally lightning speed, then leapt into the air and came stomping down on the ground heavily.

Mo Fan was already unleashing thousands of lightning arcs with every step, let alone when he now crashed to the ground after accumulating his strength. He had gathered all the Lightning Magic he had absorbed into his feet!

The impact sent out several lightning dragons. They swept over the land like enraged oxen, soared into the clouds, and released lightning arcs into the sky.

Zhao Jing was dumbfounded.

Those lightning dragons were not to be underestimated. He might be able to take them on under normal circumstances. He would never admit someone’s Lightning Magic was stronger than his, but he had used up most of his Lightning Magic to establish the Lightning Punishment Formation to trap the Northern Sacred Bears!
