Black smoke was rising continuously from the Coral-Crested Ruler’s body. The Shadow Tribe Elder’s claws had a strong corruptive energy in them. The Coral-Crested Ruler’s body was rotting rapidly, while its bones were cracking under the force exerted by the hands!

“Kill it!” Mo Fan ordered the Shadow Tribe Elder coldly.

The Shadow Tribe Elder let out an eerie chuckle as it separated itself from Mo Fan’s shadow. Mo Fan’s own shadow disappeared right away. The lightning flashing in the rain now projected the complete silhouette of the Shadow Tribe Elder. It flew in the direction of its extended arms while its head enlarged significantly!

It was like a primordial demon that had captured some delicious prey. When the Shadow Tribe Elder crushed the Coral-Crested Ruler’s bones, it treated the creature that was no longer able to defend itself as its tasty food. The Shadow Tribe Elder shoved the sea monster into its mouth and chewed it. Cries of agony echoed across the sky.

Mo Fan flew toward Biling, who was suffering from serious injuries. She had already fainted. The remaining energy of her Wind Wings was stopping her from falling into the water.

The Demon Feather Imp did not dare to behave mischievously. It obediently carried Mo Fan and Biling back to the Jimei Library.

The wolves were done with their battle, and were chasing the Scarlet Soaring Demons that were fleeing back to the sea. Since the duration of the Summoning Spell had run out, a small portion of the Scarlet Soaring Demons ended up escaping.

“Biling!”

“Miss Biling!”

The people immediately gathered toward them. Their faces turned pale when they realized her legs were missing.

“Is there a Healer here? Treat her wounds, quick!” Mo Fan ordered.

“I’ll bring her over,” one of Lin Du’s students said.

Mo Fan watched Biling being carried away. He was not sure if she could survive. The injuries left by a Ruler-level creature were difficult to heal. Biling was still in danger, even if a Healer began treating her. It all depended on whether her wounds were going to threaten her life.

“Did you just Summon an Elder of the Shadow Tribe? How did you do it?” Lin Du stared at Mo Fan in disbelief.

The Shadow Tribe Elder was a powerful being from the Dark Plane. Lin Du had spent a long time researching Dark Magic, but he had never seen anyone Summoning such a rare creature from the Dark Plane and merging it with his shadow!

“I’m not sure either; perhaps the Dark Moon Crystal has something to do with it. It seemed very interested in its energy,” Mo Fan answered helplessly.

“That might be a possibility, but I believe the main reason is because your Rebelling Shadow is rather compatible with its kind!” Lin Du said.

“Maybe, but I have no idea if I can Summon it again,” Mo Fan shrugged.

The Shadow Tribe Elder was extremely powerful, and even the Coral-Crested Ruler had not stood a chance against its attack. Mo Fan knew the Coral-Crested Ruler was still alive. It managed to escape from the Shadow Tribe Elder’s jaws after being severely injured, but the Shadow Tribe Elder’s attacks were not just physical! It had damaged the Coral-Crested Ruler’s soul!

The Coral-Crested Ruler’s soul was no longer complete. Its lifespan had dropped significantly, and its organs would deteriorate in just a few years.

The damage dealt to its soul was incurable. Most Ruler-level creatures were extremely tough, with outstanding regenerative capabilities, but they were still afraid of their souls being injured. The hourglass of death was already in place, and the countdown had started!

Mo Fan was struggling to understand why the Shadow Tribe Elder had awakened from his shadow, but he had a feeling that it had something to do with his Dark Material. The Shadow Tribe Elder was fond of the Dark Material related to the Shadow and Curse Elements. It might have something to do with the Flogging Curse Feng Zhoulong had merged with his Dark Material. On top of that, the Dark Moon Crystal had also provided him with abundant dark energy... Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If I can control the Shadow Tribe Elder, my Shadow Element will definitely be unstoppable among the Super Shadow Mages...” Mo Fan looked at his shadow.

Lightning kept flickering in the sky. Mo Fan’s shadow was projecting out into the curtain of rain seemed darker than everyone else’s. It felt like his shadow now had its own consciousness.

The shadow...

It was still his shadow. However, Mo Fan felt like it was like a cunning and ruthless demon servant standing still in the dark. Even though he knew it was not going to harm him, he still had an urge to keep an eye on it!

The Shadow Tribe Elder was definitely stronger than him. Even if it was supposed to be his servant, it could still overwhelm him. Mo Fan knew another dangerous existence would be following him around from today on. He only hoped that the Demon Element in his body could keep it at bay.

A loud bellow came from the sea over ten kilometers away.

The people saw a sea monster with rotten flesh leaving a great trail of blood behind as it swam quickly away to the east. Its cries were filled with pain.

“It ran away?” The Sound Mage on Jimei Bridge managed to learn some information from the Number One Disastrous Beast’s cry.

Meanwhile, Baxia had also returned to the surface around ten kilometers away. The water in the area he was in was tilting to one side, most likely the aftereffect of their battle.

Baxia did not chase after Qiu Chi. He turned around and stared at Qiu Zi, who was still causing a huge scene, and suddenly sped himself up.

“He’s going to kill the Number Two Disastrous Beast?” The Sound Mage received a message from Zhao Manyan, which he had delivered on behalf of Baxia.

Qiu Chi had escaped to the ocean to stay alive, so Qiu Zi was the only threat left. Baxia would flank it from the rear to cut off its escape. They might have a chance to kill it if he worked together with the Super Mages on the human’s side!

The president of the Donghai Magic Association was a little hesitant at first. After all, it was almost impossible to kill creatures like Qiu Zi and Qiu Chi. It was already a miracle that they were able to drive them away, but their hearts began to pound heavily when they saw Baxia approaching with a strong murderous aura.

Sure, why couldn’t they kill the beasts?

The sea monsters had been stirring up a lot of trouble lately because they thought humans were weak. Would the sea monsters dare to invade them again if they killed a Great Ruler?
