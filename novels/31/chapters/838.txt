Mu Ningxue was hoping that Mo Fan would not waste his resources on her. She was clearly aware that the competition within the members on the national team had only just begun. The factions behind the members had yet to show their true colors. As the team continued on with their training and moved closer to Venice, the factions would go crazy and spend lots of resources on their respective candidates. These Galaxy Veins were only the beginning!

If she could not overcome such a little problem on her own, she would have no chance of competing with the others in the future!

“You must be the most unique person on the team. No one knows who is supporting you, and no one knows how are you so strong, and yet you’ve come this far on your own, so you don’t really care if the others are relying on their own or the factions behind them... anyway... I just hope you understand why I won’t accept your gift,” said Mu Ningxue.

She finished expressing her thoughts. She hoped Mo Fan understood that a single Galaxy Vein was not enough to solve her problem. On the other hand, she did not want to be a burden to others. She wanted to plan her own path.

Mo Fan let out a long sigh.

He wondered which asshole mentioned that any woman would be willing to dive into a man’s hug after spending a hundred million on her.

What a blatant lie!

It was useless for a man to spend a hundred million on a woman who already had a hundred million. He would need a thousand million, tens of thousands of millions!

“Your Lightning Element must have reached the limit too, so...” said Mu Ningxue.

“Fine, what are you going to do next?” asked Mo Fan.

Mo Fan did not force it. He was glad that Mu Ningxue had said so much to him. The number of words she has said today equaled the number of words she had spoken to him in the past month.

Mo Fan was excited, but he was not dumb. Judging from Mu Ningxue’s reaction, he believed he still had a great chance of winning her affections.

As Mo Fan returned to the East Maritime Fortress, he kicked Zhao Manyan’s door open.

Zhao Manyan was meditating. He was given a great scare when Mo Fan kicked the door and barged in. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Bro, what the hell are you doing?” Zhao Manyan had a bad feeling when he saw the aggressive Mo Fan.

“Huh, you asshole...you broke through?” Mo Fan raised his brows when he sensed the change to Zhao Manyan’s aura.

“Yeah, it took me three Galaxy Veins just to broke through. Close the door first, I want to ask you something,” replied Zhao Manyan, after he suddenly recalled something.

Mo Fan was confused. He shut the door and wondered why Zhao Manyan was being so mysterious.

“I lied to my dad that I only managed to break through the barrier with the three Galaxy Veins, hoping that he would get me another one... I was planning to give it to you in case of an emergency, but the person supervising me found out the truth. In the end, my dad scolded the shit out of me!” said Zhao Manyan with a troubled look.

“Three...three Galaxy Veins, your Zhao Financial Group has surely lost a fortune just to get you on the national team,” said Mo Fan, his lips twitching.

“I actually asked for four, but the shareholders have already requested to get rid of me during a meeting, they said that I’ve wasted too many resources. Hey, can you pay attention? I was trying my best to help you. Aren’t you going to help Mu Ningxue, considering the situation she is currently in? I still have some savings, how much money do you have now? Hurry up and buy a Galaxy Vein and give it to her! She will definitely leap into your hug out of gratitude. We can earn the money back, but a woman’s heart is harder to earn. Besides, you can easily earn a hundred million back yourself,” said Zhao Manyan.

Mo Fan’s lips twitched even stronger.

Did Zhao Manyan seriously have to mention it now? He had just been rejected!

Mo Fan took out a Galaxy Vein, implying that he had already tried the method.

Zhao Manyan’s eyes widened. He immediately raised his thumb at Mo Fan.

How manly was Mo Fan, to be willing to give something so expensive as a gift...

“I have come to ask you about it too; was Mu Ningxue telling me the truth, that every member on the team has a formidable faction supporting them, and the journey ahead is simply a competition between the factions, families, and financial groups?” asked Mo Fan.

“Seriously, how retarded can you be? It’s something that every human knows, yet you’re still asking me! Do you really think a bunch of young Magicians alone can attract the attention of the entire world? Many families are already trying desperately to make a name for themselves in the colleges and institutes. As for the World College Tournament, it’s the final goal of every faction!” He sighed. “A grassroots Magician like you should be more aware. It’s like you’re not living in the same world as us!” said Zhao Manyan disdainfully.

Mo Fan felt his balls hurting too. How would he know it was such a hideous mess? He was not involved with any formidable faction, since he had always been a lone wolf. As a result, he was totally unaware of the infighting on the national team...

“Don’t be tricked by Jiang Yu’s modest appearance; do you know who’s supporting him?” Zhao Manyan asked when he saw Mo Fan having trouble understanding the situation.

“Who?” wondered Mo Fan.

“The Royal Guards! He is the disciple of the capital’s Royal Guards’ chief, Pang Lai, a sacred Magician ranked in the top ten in our country!” said Zhao Manyan.

The capital’s Royal Guards was one of the most symbolic organizations in China. They were the highest authority Enforcement Union of the Magic Association. Most Councilmen of the country were members of the Royal Guards. Mo Fan did know something basic like that.

Also, Zhu Meng was also a member of the Royal Guards!

The Imperial Magicians in the Ancient Capital was under the command of the Royal Guards. They were basically a branch of the Royal Guards. The selection for the Imperial Magicians was incredibly strict, let alone the selection for the Royal Guards!

“I can’t even tell, is that Jiang Yu really that impressive?” Mo Fan was shocked.

“Behind Li Kaifeng is the Education Union. Simply speaking, if he is somehow disqualified from the team for no reason, all Magic high schools south of the Yangtze River will stop operating, and I mean all of them!” said Zhao Manyan.

“Why is that now?”

“Do you remember the Stardust Magic Tools that your school provided you when you’re still in high school? It provides talented students without a nice background some resources to cultivate... all supplies of Magic Tools to the magic schools to the south of Yangtze River are handled by two or three elder generations before Li Kaifeng. His family basically has pupils everywhere. The family is regarded as a living Bodhisattva that the country can’t afford to offend. His family was the benefactor for many reputable Magicians who were once grassroots Magicians,” said Zhao Manyan.

“Err... guess I’m one of them too,” Mo Fan did remember how his Little Loach had eaten the school’s Stardust Magic Tool.

“I believe I won’t need to explain Mu Tingying’s case to you. The Mu Clan... our Zhao Family isn’t usually afraid of factions who name themselves with their surname, but the Mu Clan is one of them. They are incredibly massive, with people in the huge cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and the smaller cities, owning half of the properties in the cities,” explained Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan’s words reminded Mo Fan. Mu Zhuoyun was once a wealthy landlord in Bo City, and it sounded like Mu Zhuoyun was just a little branch in the whole Mu Family, meaning that there were many branches like Mu Zhuoyun’s in it.

Now that Mo Fan thought about it, it was pretty shocking. After all, back when he was only sixteen, Bo City was pretty much the whole world for him!
