At night, the Yanming Temple was so quiet that not a single insect cry could be heard. The developed seaside city under the mountain seemed to have nothing to do with the temple. The light of a few oil lamps swayed in the dark. It was easy to forget about the existence of the temple..

“Mo Fan, why are you sitting here? You almost scared me!” exclaimed a woman.

“I think something is weird about this temple,” Mo Fan frowned, still in deep thought.

“Didn’t the monk already say we must stay five meters away from the stone statues, especially you!” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“Do you know, during the afternoon...” Mo Fan was just about to share his weird encounter with someone.

Mo Fan still could not figure out what the girl was. If she was a ghost, he had never seen a ghost appearing in bright daylight. Besides, she was too youthful and energetic for an undead. However, if she was alive, where were her footprints? Why did she disappear without a trace after heading down the stairs? Mo Fan was not naive enough to believe that she had tripped and rolled all the way to the bottom.

Jiang Shaoxu interrupted before Mo Fan could finish, “We’ll talk when we take a stroll down the street.”

“Taking a stroll down the street? What stroll? I never said I wanted to go anywhere,” Mo Fan had been troubled by the little girl for a long time. As a professional Hunter, he had a strong thirst for knowledge. He would not be able to sleep well if he did not find out the truth...alright, Mo Fan admitted that he was just looking for something to do as he was too bored, and the encounter with the monk and the girl was quite interesting, too!

“Well, I’m planning to buy some stuff from the market,” Jiang Shaoxu smiled, fully displaying her temperament as a vixen.

“You’re asking me to go with you?” asked Mo Fan, raising his brows.

“You already told me something is weird; do you really want me to walk alone at night? It’s quite a distance from here to the city. I’m just a weak girl, what if some pervert saw how attractive I am and wanted to do lewd things to me, like that asshole Gong Yu? Won’t you feel bad for me?” Jiang Shaoxu flicked her hair, as if she was asking Mo Fan to netflix and chill with her.

Mo Fan was an honorable man. How could he possibly be seduced by the vixen? He jumped down from the stone turtle and said, “Let’s go!” immediately.

—

taking the stairs down, Jiang Shaoxu was far from a well-behaved woman. Whenever she was alone with a man, she would stick closely to him, trying to trigger some chemistry between them. Mo Fan was not an exception. Her arm would occasionally rub against Mo Fan’s as she went down the stairs while swinging her hips...

Mo Fan was an honorable man...fine, forget it, there was no point acting further. Either way, the woman’s skin was pretty smooth, he could easily feel it even when her clothes were between their hands.

“By the way, I feel like I’ve heard the name Mo Fan before, but for some reason, I can’t remember where,” said Jiang Shaoxu.

“My name is pretty common, similar to names like Jianguo, Ronghua, Jiahao, or names like Haohan, Zixuan, and Xuanyang in the twenty-first century. I bet there are at least a hundred thousand people with the same name!” said Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was actually overjoyed inside while he pretended to be low-key. Either way, he was a famous man who had saved countless women in countless cities, thus it was reasonable that someone had heard his name before!

“Perhaps, I remember every man who I’m interested with. Since my impression of you is a little vague, it’s most likely because you’re not worthy enough,” replied Jiang Shaoxu honestly.

“...”

Mo Fan was lost for words at that instant, but a sudden fragrance swept past his nose. Mo Fan thought Jiang Shaoxu was flipping her hair again, yet on second thought, the fragrance was different from her rose perfume. It smelt refreshing, like some kind of herbs, and the fragrance of some innocent flowers on the side of the road.

As Mo Fan was still feeling confused, a person suddenly appeared on the stairs in front of them.

A neat ponytail tied up on her head, and side fringes dangling around her shoulders fully displayed the girl’s delicate charm.

She was dressed in plain, simple-colored clothes. The only eye-catching part was the swallowtail butterfly pin on her slightly uplifted chest. Her breasts were not huge, but it was obvious that she was going through puberty, and together with her skinny physique, they gave her an obvious curve!

“Miyata?” Mo Fan remembered the girl’s name. He looked at her in surprise.

In the afternoon, the sunlight was still shining on her as she was carried her little basket. She looked innocent and charming, just like some girl next door, yet it was quite scary how she had appeared on the stairs out of nowhere. No matter how innocent her smile was, it still looked somewhat eerie!

“What Miyata?” Jiang Shaoxu looked at Mo Fan in confusion.

“The girl ahead,” said Mo Fan.

Jiang Shaoxu glanced ahead with a confused look.

However, she soon turned around and giggled, “I thought you’re more interesting than the other guys, but you’re using such a boring trick still. Do you think I’m going to dive into your arms just because you said there’s a girl in front of us? You have to be better if you want to take advantage of me...”

Mo Fan’s forehead was covered in black lines when he heard Jiang Shaoxu’s words, “You can’t see her? You seriously can’t see her?”

“Stop trying to trick me, there’s nothing ahead!” Jiang Shaoxu proceeded down the stairs.

After going down the stairs, Jiang Shaoxu passed by Miyata without noticing there was a girl standing right beside her.

Miyata looked at Jiang Shaoxu with a smile as she walked past. For some reason, Mo Fan felt a chill running down his spine when he saw it.

“I forgot to ask your name in the afternoon. I’m glad to meet you, friend from the east,” said Miyata politely to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was not the kind that would easily wet his pants after seeing something supernatural. He remained calm and said in a deep voice, “I’m Zhao Manyan. Is it true that my friend can’t see you and hear you?”

Jiang Shaoxu took a few steps more before she realized that Mo Fan was still mumbling to himself. She turned around and smilingly said, “Are you seriously still going on with the joke? Stop talking to yourself, let’s head into town. I’ve got things to buy. The air by the sea is too moist, I don’t feel too comfortable.”

“I’m not sure either, but since you and your friend are busy, I won’t disturb you anymore. Zhao Manyan... not a bad name...” said Miyata softly.

She slowly disappeared into the darkness after finishing the sentence.

Mo Fan stared ahead with a blank face. There was nothing in front of him, apart from a lingering fragrance!
