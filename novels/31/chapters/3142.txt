Zhao Manyan recovered quickly, as expected of Buddha Zhao. Besides, the divine medicine MO Fan brought was really powerful. Soon, he regained his vitality.

“You did great, Kraken!” Zhao Manyan patted his capable assistant.

He had a Divine Beast that specialized in defense with him, the Black Totem Turtle. However, it was too aloof and stern. Zhao Manyan experienced no joy in taking care of a pet like that. Little Green Kraken was the cute and obedient one, and it could also hold its own in a fight.

“Just wondering, how did Little Green Kraken find us via scent when the Dark Plane’s Galaxy of the Yin Energy God is so huge?” MO Fan was quite surprised by this.

Clearly, their meeting was no coincidence.

Little Green Kraken had managed to accurately locate MO Fan on the vast Dark Plane and dragged Zhao Manyan’s body over to him.

Most powerful people would lose their way on the Dark Plane. Their divine senses would be largely suppressed. Under such circumstances, a person would already be considered strong if they could sense certain amounts of danger around them. As Zhao Manyan’s divine pet, Little Green Kraken had only been in contact with MO Fan a few times, yet it was able to locate him with such great precision! This was an amazing ability!

“I wasn’t expecting my darling Kraken to be so strong either. Do you remember Ding Yumian’s scent? Should we go to Ding Yumian?” Zhao Manyan asked.

Zhao Manyan was still feeling troubled. He was worried about Ding Yumian walking down the wrong path.

Little Green Kraken shook its head. It could not locate her scent since it had never been in close contact with her before.

Zhao Manyan sighed and said, “You already did great. At the very least, you sent me to MO Fan…”

“Hasn’t Little Green Kraken met Mu Bai before? Should we have it locate Mu Bail s scent?” MO Fan asked.

“Makes sense!” Zhao Manyan said.

“00!” Little Green Kraken quickly used its scent sense and started searching for Mu Bai’s scent on the Dark Plane.

Mu Bails situation was different from Asha’ruiya’s.

She had completed her parade and returned to the Dark Plane on her own. She still had a place on the Dark Plane.

However, Mu Bai had not completed his parade. He had been devoured and dragged back to the Dark Plane. That meant he had died once, and his status as a Fallen Angel had basically been removed. He might even need to be whipped and punished by the Dark King.

Of course, MO Fan was not entirely sure of the specifics of his current situation. He could only have Asha’ruiya guide him in his search for Mu Bai.

However, with Little Green Kraken around, they could locate Mu Bai straightaway, and that was great!

Little Green Kraken seemed to have detected Mu Bai’s scent because it suddenly wagged its tail and swam at full speed.

The Galaxy of the Yin Energy God was cold and frigid, but to Little Green Kraken, it was as warm as a hot spring. The temperature was gentle and comfortable.

The water in the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God also had mass, and its density was much greater than normal liquid. Otherwise, it would not have been able to cause a dimensional whirlpool to appear in the sky. But Little Green Kraken was still unaffected by the water’s mass. It swam quickly and cut their journey on the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God short by a large margin.

“We managed to reach the other side in a day…” Asha’ruiya could not quite believe it herself.

While they were on the boat, they did not have an accurate sense of time. Some people would end up floating about for a century on the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God and be completely lost in it.

Little Green Kraken was a unique creature that existed beyond the three planes of existence. It was not bound by any rules and lived freely.

When they arrived on shore, Little Green Kraken even flew in the air.

The Dark Plane’s roads were actually quite similar to pedestrian roads in ancient palaces. All government officers were not allowed to ride on horses and were required to walk on foot. The Dark Plane did not allow anyone to fly either. If they did, they would experience a huge magnetic pull that would make them waste a large amount of demonic energy.

Hence, MO Fan and Asha’ruiya walked on the Dark Plane even though they could fly in other worlds. It had been a month since they arrived, but they were still on their way to save Mu Bai. This was precisely because of the unique limitations set on the Dark Plane.

However, Little Green Kraken was the exception. It could swim at will.

The dark land, which was the Galaxy of the Yin Energy God, and the bloody, upside-down sky could not suppress its nature to move about freely.

“If I had known that your Kraken possessed this ability to travel freely, I would have brought you along!” MO Fan lamented.

“Heh.” Zhao Manyan did not even have the energy to make a sarcastic quip. He would not come to this place even if someone pointed a gun to his head. There were no beautiful ladies, good food, and music here. It was devoid of fun.

He would have to live like a monk.

“Speaking of which, this is similar to the pilgrimages written in your texts,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Haha! You’re right, Rabbi. Protect our rabbi, disciple. I’m going to see whether there are any demons causing trouble up ahead. If any demons come and attack us, just throw your clothes at them. I’m sure they’ll hit like bricks.” MO Fan laughed and patted Zhao Manyan on the shoulder.

Since Zhao Manyan’s clothes were still drenched, they weighed a ton. It would indeed hurt like a b*tch if he threw them at someone. “Shut up! Go throw your own clothes at others!”

Little Green Kraken did not feel tired.

Sometimes, it would open its mouth and suck in the Nether Mayflies flying around the Dark Plane. Then, it would continue swimming in the air.

“Little Green Kraken, are you sure Mu Bail s here?” Asha’ruiya stared at the long, ancient city up ahead and asked in surprise.

“What’s this place?” MO Fan looked over and saw an ancient city that resembled the capital of an empire.

“Myriad Ant City. You’ve seen the king of the place before.” Asha’ruiya frowned. Clearly, she did not like this majestic dark city.

“Who is it?” MO Fan asked.

“The one who played chess with us,” Asha’ruiya said.

“That one? Him again? Hasn’t Mu Bai broken free of his control? He fell into the Dark Abyss because of me. He should be exiled and punished. Why did he end up in that guy’s hands again?” MO Fan asked.

“I’m not entirely sure. Maybe he just can’t let Mu Bai go?” Asha’ruiya said.

“Who’s this guy you’re talking about? Are his chess skills really good? Why is he playing chess on the Dark Plane? What chess game is it? Backgammon? I’m great at that!” Zhao Manyan said.

“00!” Little Green Kraken cried out as a sign that Mu Bai was within the ancient dark city, but it could not locate his precise location.

“Since we’re here, we can talk once we’re inside. Who cares what lies there, anyway?” MO Fan did not want to bother using his head.

If he treaded carefully in everything he did, he would grow old before he could get anything done.

It was better for him to just get off Little Green Kraken and get in.

Since they were in the ancient dark city, they had to follow its rules. They could not fly around in their skies.

Interestingly, their city guard was a Minotaur.

It had the huge head of a black bull, and it was really built. If MO Fan had not destroyed the previous Minotaur’s nose, he would have thought that they were the same individuals.

“Identity?” the Minotaur asked.

“Six-Winged,” Asha’ruiya answered coldly.

The Minotaur immediately looked down at the thin layer of water and saw Asha’ruiya’s unique skeletal reflection.

It immediately smiled apologetically and offered her all the goodies he had gotten from others who had entered the city. It was as if it was trying to get into Asha’ruiya’s good books.

However, she scoffed at the bribes from the Dark Citizen. She pointed at MO

Fan and Zhao Manyan and said, “They’re my retainers, MO Goku and Zhao Hakkai.”

Both MO Fan and Zhao Manyan were stunned speechless.

“Let them in!” The Minotaur beckoned at the guards behind it to make way, which they immediately did.

Once they were in the city, MO Fan noticed that the wide streets were just as lively as the streets in the human world.

There were merchants, travelers, inns, soldiers, wanderers, and poets…

What was even more astonishing was that all of them were dressed in brilliant clothes. It looked as though they were there to attend a grand banquet, and MO Fan could not stop gasping in amazement.

However, the land of the Dark Plane was covered in a thin layer of water. It made the land appear smooth and clear no matter how dirty the ground was. This also meant that the skeletal reflections of all the people in the ancient city were reflected on the water. If MO Fan had ignored it, he would have still been amazed, but once he saw it, he witnessed all sorts of demons and monsters. “Do you need lodgings, travelers?” A friendly pig-faced person came over and asked expectantly.

MO Fan cast a glance at Zhao Manyan and asked him to talk to his “kinsman.”

Zhao Manyan looked up. His face—still bloated due to the water—was indeed similar to the pig-faced person’s. It made them look like they were related. “We don’t need lodgings,” Zhao Manyan answered.

“If you’re looking for someone, staying at our inn might be useful to you,” the pig-faced person said.

“Pig-faced people are the information brokers of the Dark Plane. They know everything.

“We’ll stay at your place,” Asha’ruiya said.

“Alright. The sun is about to set.” The pig-faced person adjusted his tie and said with a smile.

Regardless of their appearances, the Dark Citizens here were all dressed in strange clothes. They wore leather, dresses, gowns, cotton-padded clothes, dress shirts, and top hats like Western nobles.

Whether they were walking down the roads or calling out for business, all of them exuded an air of regality. When they met each other’s gazes, they would even politely lift their hats and smile at one another before bowing lightly.

“Who are they? Demi-humans?” Zhao Manyan asked curiously.

Honestly, despite having the faces of pigs, snakes, bulls, pigeons, donkeys, or cats, they appeared no different from living humans. They wore beautiful clothes and behaved politely.

“Buddhism speaks of three poisons, while Western religion talks about the seven deadly sins. Their faces show what sort of sin they had while they were alive. But the ancient dark city has its own rules. These people did not die natural deaths. So, based on their different deaths, they wear the faces of animals and can never remove them. I think bull faces mean dying of over-cultivation or overwork. Those with snake faces were too wicked and killed by those exacting revenge on them. As for pigs—” Asha’ruiya whispered.

“They were too stupid. They kept eating and ended up being other people’s food.” The pig-faced person from earlier turned around with a smile and told them.

MO Fan frowned.

Honestly, the pig-faced person’s lack of care about someone talking about him and the way he spoke of himself were quite disconcerting.

“So… you sucked at managing your finances and got scammed out of your money?” But Zhao Manyan understood what he was saying and voiced his theory.

“Correct, and we do so hate capitalists.”

“Are there capitalists on the Dark Plane? How’s your life here?” MO Fan asked.

“Hehe… This is a great place.” The pig-faced person smiled mysteriously but did not elaborate.

“We want information about a person. He was once a Fallen Angel,” MO Fan said.

“Sure. Write down the specifics of the person you want to find, and I’ll send it to my kinsman. But you’ll have to rest well tonight. I trust that by tomorrow morning, you’ll have what you want on your table,” the pig-faced person said.

He was confident as if there was no one he could not find..
