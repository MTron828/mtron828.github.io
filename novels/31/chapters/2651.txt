Chapter 2652: Wall of Despair

“Santel, what are you doing!?” Yangel shouted at him.

Why was Santel kneeling in front of the woman? Since when did he become so retarded? Why did it have to happen at a crucial time like this?

“Help...help me!” Old Santel was sweating badly, his face and clothes soaked clean through. He was trying his best to open his mouth and ask the others for help.

Guan Songdi and his uncle were the closest to Old Santel. They had no idea what had happened.

Three Sacred Bear Elites behind them immediately ran toward Old Santel to assist him.

They were all Super Mages. Several dazzling Star Palaces appeared around them as the Elites continuously poured their energy into them. Their Auras grew significantly as the last Star of their Star Palaces lit up.

“Vacuum Storm!”

It was a Super Wind Spell. A terrifying Eye of the Storm appeared above them and sucked away the air to form a huge tornado. The wind was sharp and powerful.

The Vacuum Storm moved directly above Xinxia.

The Psychic Element was effective at suppressing an enemy’s magic, but most Psychic Mages would struggle to suppress two or more people simultaneously.

It was like trying to do several things at once. It was difficult to focus on all of them.

Old Santel realized the woman was a stronger Psychic Mage than him. He was not confident the others helping him could beat her. However, he just needed their help to distract her.

Once the woman was distracted, the huge pressure she had applied to him would greatly weaken, allowing Old Santel to break free from her control.

Unfortunately, Old Santel had forgotten that the Radiance Unicorn was a Sacred Beast, and stronger than certain Ruler-level creatures!

The Radiance Unicorn lifted its head and fired a strong beam from its horn. The beam flew into the sky and hit the Eye of the Storm.

The tornado vanished, starting from its base. The strong wind dissipated when it was less than fifty meters away from Xinxia.

In addition to that, the Radiance Unicorn raised its front legs and stomped the ground. Dense silver Runes appeared close to it and its rider.

Two other Super Spells were heading toward Xinxia. The Runes that had spread across the ground like cracks had formed circles of protection, rising like walls around her.

The Runic Walls defended Xinxia from every powerful Spell that was targeting her. The Runes dimmed slightly every time they stopped a Spell.

However, the three Super Mages were overwhelmed by despair when they noticed their three Super Spells did not even cancel out the first circle of Runes, only making several of the Runes stop glowing.

They attacked Xinxia and the Radiance Unicorn again, unwilling to admit defeat, but after attacking with several strong Super Spells, including the Demon Judgment Sword, they had only taken out the Runes of the first Wall!

The problem was, there were at least a dozen Circles under the woman’s feet! How long was it going to take them to break through her defense?

Old Santel could only remain kneeling on the ground. He had finally realized how strong the woman was. She was completely out of his league!

Mo Fan turned to Xinxia. He was going to protect her when he saw Old Santel moving toward her, but it turned out Old Santel was the one at a disadvantage!

Mo Fan was relieved to see it. Xinxia no longer needed his protection like she used to!

Mo Fan closed in on Kunoy, who was still using the Fire Sorcery. He noticed Kunoy was constantly backing away after his Fire Sorcery was nullified, obviously planning to hide behind Yangel.

However, Yangel had been badly beaten up by Little Flame Belle in her Complete Phase. He did not have time to protect his brother. He had already been injured when he fought Mo Fan previously, otherwise he could have lasted longer in the fight against Little Flame Belle.

“Shadow Thistles!”

Mo Fan waved his hand. Dark thistles crawled up under Kunoy’s feet like huge snakes and wrapped around his legs before dragging him toward Mo Fan.

Kunoy was surprisingly nimble. He was able to cut through the thistles that were binding him down and avoid them at impressive speed.

“Do you think I only know Sorcery?” Kunoy’s speed kept increasing, gradually leaving more afterimages behind him. The thistles were struggling to catch up to him.

He suddenly turned toward Mo Fan instead of backing away. He broke free from the cordon of thistles and launched a counterattack!

His speed was so high that Mo Fan could only see an auburn blur. His hands had also transformed into sharp claws, which he was now sweeping at Mo Fan’s face!

“Demon Judgment Sword: Sword Frame!”

Two heavy swords made up of blinding rays of light clanged together in front of Mo Fan, as if two ancient deities had crossed their swords in front of Mo Fan to defend him.

Kunoy struck the Demon Judgment Swords with his claws. The swords broke into pieces, but Kunoy was forced to back away by the burning light.

Mo Fan glanced over at Zhao Manyan, who had arrived just in time.

Zhao Manyan studied Kunoy in surprise. As a pure defensive Mage, it was rare for someone to break his defense with a single blow. The Demon Judgment Sword Frame was not just a normal defensive Spell!

“You are lucky that I came in time, or that slap was going to make your face bloody,” Zhao Manyan noted.

Mo Fan nodded. He had underestimated Kunoy. The man had pretended he was not good at close combat in order to surprise him with a deadly counterattack. Most Super Mages would have died if they were being so careless!

“Mo Fan, we have to use their Magic Formation to leave this place. The whole of Fenghe Mountain City is surrounded by the Sharkmen now!” Zhao Manyan informed him.

“Their Magic Formation can only hold eight people,” Mo Fan replied. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What? Their group clearly has more than eight people!” Zhao Manyan swore.

He immediately realized the truth after finishing the sentence, and could not help looking disdainful.

He had thought the Northern Sacred Bears were a renowned organization that would respect basic ethics, but it turned out these people were no different from bandits!
