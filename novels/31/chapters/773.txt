The monks were admitted to the hospital. Japan had its own City Hunters too, but since the problem had been resolved, the monks did not want any more trouble.

Back at Yanming Temple, Mo Fan hurried his way to where Mu Ningxue was resting and saw her awake. Nan Rongni was feeding her some aromatic mushroom soup.

Mo Fan smiled when he learned that she was fine.

“Strange, I thought I was sleeping for a long time. Why is the sun just setting when I woke up?” asked Zhao Manyan in a confused voice.

It turned out that the guy was still clueless about what happened. Mo Fan was too lazy to explain it to him.

“When we came back, the people whose souls were kidnapped before woke up too. However, their souls were separated from their bodies for too long. Their souls had lost too much energy. Even if they managed to wake up, their bodies would be extremely weak, and their lifespan would be reduced too. It is difficult to revert the damage done to a human soul,” said Jiang Yu.

“They always say Japan has lots of ghosts; we already stumbled into one, even though we’re staying at a temple. Such luck!”

“The Magic Association of Xixiong City must be investigating it now. They will soon discover that we’re here illegally. We should leave as soon as possible. We’re still quite far away from Tokyo,” said Nanyu.

Xixiong City was the westernmost place in Japan, while Tokyo was located in the east. They basically had to travel across all of Japan to reach there. It was quite a long journey without taking a plane.

The team was prepared to leave Xixiong City early the next morning. Nan Rongni was walking around holding a bowl of medicine in her hand.

“Did anyone see Zhao Manyan? He hasn’t drunk his medicine yet,” asked Nan Rongni.

“Nope, did he seriously go missing again early in the morning? Damn, don’t tell me something happened to him again?” Mo Fan’s heart tightened.

“Isn’t he right there!?” Jiang Yu pointed at the path leading to the back of the mountain.

Zhao Manyan hurriedly returned from the back of the mountain and regrouped with the others. Gong Yu who was still holding a grudge against him snapped coldly as the team had wasted some time waiting for his return, “Can you not run off for no reason? Do you seriously think we’re on vacation?”

Zhao Manyan was too lazy to talk to Gong Yu. He sidled over to Mo Fan and nudged him, “Hey, I have something to tell you, I had a very long dream last night, it’s related to the temple in the back of the mountain. The dream was too complicated, so I can’t really explain it all to you, but I feel like everything has happened for a reason...”

“Err, didn’t anyone tell you what happened?” said Mo Fan.

“What happened... (sigh), don’t worry about it now, I’ve gone straight to the back of the mountain after I woke up, guess what I found there?” said Zhao Manyan in a mysterious tone. His eyes were flickering with joy.

“I bet you found a wooden clapper with carvings of some ancient words on it,” replied Mo Fan.

Zhao Manyan was dumbfounded. He raised his thumb at Mo Fan and said, “You’re a f**king genius, how did you guess it? It’s a wooden clapper indeed. The place was exactly the same as what I saw in my dream, so I took the wooden clapper with me. I’m sure that it’s a piece of treasure!”

Saying this, Zhao Manyan slowly opened up a piece of cloth he kept in his pocket. Inside it was the strange wooden clapper vessel in the run-down temple!

Mo Fan was shocked. He immediately took a few steps back.

Zhao Manyan was even more confused. Why was he scared of a wooden clapper?

“Holy crap, how did you take it?” Mo Fan stared at the eerie wooden clapper vessel in disbelief.

“How did I take it? With my hand of course... (sigh), I know it’s wrong to steal it, but the place is quite run-down. It’s better for me to take it then leaving it there to rust away. Besides, I feel like it’s calling me when I was asleep. On top of that, it’s somehow related to the dream I had. I think... I’m predestined to find it!” said Zhao Manyan in a serious voice.

Mo Fan was having difficulty interpreting the situation. The truth was, they had gone back to the run-down temple after dealing with Nara Orisora, to decide what they were going to do with the vessel. To their surprise, the wooden clapper’s Magic Lock was as strong as it was before. They could not do anything to it at all.

They could not even touch the wooden clapper vessel, let alone take it away.

To his surprise, Zhao Manyan had a dream about it and even took it with him!

Was the Magic Lock not stopping him?

“Nanyu, can you check this out?” Mo Fan felt something was not right. He quickly called Nanyu over.

Nanyu did some checks and realized that the wooden clapper vessel was bound to Zhao Manyan’s soul. However, she could not tell if it was because it had taken Zhao Manyan’s soul away before, or because the vessel had lost its previous owner...

Mo Fan tried to touch the wooden clapper. As he thought, the yellow forbidding force emerged again and rejected him strongly. Zhao Manyan was so shocked that he even threw the wooden clapper away.

When Zhao Manyan went to pick it up again, it had returned to normal without posing any threat.

Nanyu frowned as she fell into deep thought. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She looked at Mo Fan and asked him to follow her to a corner.

“What’s going on? Is there something wrong with the wooden clapper? I feel like it’s quite evil; maybe it’s better to leave it here,” said Mo Fan.

“First of all, I think the wooden clapper has chosen its new owner as Zhao Manyan, whose soul was kidnapped first. I believe it had something to do with the dream he had, but I think he wasn’t dreaming. It was his soul going deep into the wooden clapper, and somehow he has acquired its approval,” said Nanyu.

The Magic Lock was not only effective against Mo Fan, it activated when everyone else tried to touch it, including Mu Ningxue.

“Is that even possible?” Mo Fan was left speechless.

Did Zhao Manyan seriously obtain a strange piece of treasure just by sleeping?

“Normally, it’s more likely that you’d become the wooden clapper’s new owner since you’ve killed the demon spirit inside it. However, from what I can tell, the wooden clapper is actually repelling more... maybe I shouldn’t say repel, I think it’s afraid of you. From what I know, the wooden clapper most likely gave birth to the demon spirit since it has been ownerless for a very long time. The person who defeated the demon spirit would usually become its new owner. Instead, it’s rejecting you more strongly than before. The only explanation is, you already own a Lifetime Vessel, and its level is higher than the wooden clapper!” Nanyu stared at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was startled. He was going to look at the Little Loach Pendant on his neck subconsciously, but decided against it when he saw Nanyu’s sharp gaze.

“Am I right, Mo Fan?” Nanyu’s lips curled upward slightly. The expression in her eyes felt like she had completely read his mind.
