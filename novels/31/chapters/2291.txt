The militia sergeant slowly turned around and saw a man in a transparent raincoat standing in the rain.

His eyes were emitting a deep silver light, which was a little bewitching to look at.

“It’s... it’s you?” the militia sergeant stammered in disbelief.

Wasn’t he the young tourist he gave permission to leave out of kindness?

If he was strong enough to stop such a huge rock with his eyes, why would he behave so modestly in front of them?

Mo Fan went up to the militia sergeant and smiled. “Relax..”

The militia sergeant could not relax at all. The Federation’s army had arrived. He was only a Basic Mage. He had been appointed to lead some militia because he had been a Hunter for some time.

However, he was just like the rest of his squad. They could die at any second!

“Fine, we admit we are the three people who are wanted by your army, but I’m grateful for your kindness in letting us go. It gave us some time to treat our injuries and catch our breath,” Mo Fan told him.

The militia sergeant’s face was drenched in the rain. He had a blank expression as he struggled to take in the information.

He was only one of a hundred thousand militiamen. He did not have the clearance to understand what his superiors were up to.

“Y...young man, why did you save the people in the refugee camp?” the militia sergeant asked after some time.

“Why did you let us go?” Mo Fan asked in return.

“I just think that we can’t lose our conscience as humans,” the militia sergeant answered honestly.

“Likewise, you are right that many people in the Federation are scumbags,” Mo Fan sighed.

The militia sergeant sat on the ground with a regretful face. “To be honest with you, I didn’t want to join the revolution, but the sudden thought came into my mind out of nowhere. (Sigh) I can’t back out anymore. I will most likely die soon in an explosion,” the militia sergeant admitted in low spirits.

Mo Fan trusted the militia sergeant’s words.

The purpose of the rain the Black Vatican had conspired to use for so long was to make everyone lose their rationality, so they would tear at one another like primordial beasts with even a little conflict.

It was obvious that many people in the war still had a clear conscience, like this militia sergeant. Unfortunately, the people with their own principles and beliefs were slowly losing their ground to the rain, or they were forced to go with the flow in order to survive.

“I don’t know if you will believe me when I say the Black Vatican is actually pulling the strings behind the scenes. They are using the rain...” Mo Fan briefly explained the Black Vatican’s plan to the militia sergeant.

He was waiting for Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai’s update, so he decided to use the time wisely by learning more information about the Brown Army from the militia sergeant.

The militia sergeant was dumbfounded after learning the truth.

“I believe you, but you won’t be able to make it to the Scorching River’s headwaters,” the militia sergeant told him.

“Why?” Mo Fan was puzzled.

“The main army has set a camp there. As for the Black Vatican’s Head Priest whom you mentioned… he’s referred to as the Rain Sensei in the army. He’s praying to the Heavens for the Rain of Victory,” the militia sergeant said.

“Rain of Victory?” Mo Fan almost burst out laughing, yet he felt sorry for the locals when he thought about the situation.

It was clearly a Rain of Destruction, yet the people were tricked into believing it was a Rain of Victory, which would bring them blessings.

“Perhaps it’s because the people became more united since the rain started falling. Not only is the headwaters of the Scorching River the main camp of our army, the elite soldiers led by our general, Ash, are on standby in the vicinity too. You won’t be able to reach the woods in the outer circle, let alone the Scorching River,” the militia sergeant told.

Mo Fan frowned. It sounded like the Brown Army assumed the Black Vatican’s rain was in their favor.

In other words, the Black Vatican had long colluded with the Brown Army!

Or perhaps the Black Vatican had long planned to use their trick on a politically unstable country so they could take it over!

Wu Ku was serving as the Brown Army’s battle drummer. He was using the heavy rain to turn the Brown Army into ferocious beasts!

In other words, Wu Ku was protected by the whole Brown Army...

“I’ve learned a lot. Thank you for telling me all this,” Mo Fan said.

“I’m not as powerful as you. It’s all I can do,” the militia sergeant sighed.

“I should go. Be careful,” Mo Fan did not want to stay for too long.

“Alright, you guys should be careful too,” the militia sergeant sent him off. He ran to the collapsed building where the slender woman was buried under the debris.

Either way, it was still a human life. The militia sergeant took off his brown jacket and started searching for the woman under the broken cement and steel-reinforced bars.

Mo Fan left in a hurry, hearing cries of agony around him. A young man with a broken leg was lying on the street. An old man was trapped in a collapsed house. Women were looking for shelter amid the debris.

The Federation’s army was rapidly pushing forward. The destruction they were causing to the city was on par with the destruction the Brown Army had caused. They were basically tearing the already broken-down city apart.

Mo Fan caught up to Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai. “How is it looking?”

“The Federation’s army will soon reach the barricades. From the looks of it, they will reclaim the city in three hours,” Mu Bai reported.

Zhao Manyan had stolen a few uniforms from the Federation army. He passed them to Mo Fan and Mu Bai. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Their goal is to drive the Brown Army back to the other side of the Scorching River. They will keep pushing after retaking the city,” Mu Bai went on as he and Mo Fan swiftly put on the uniforms.

They did not want to be involved in the war, but they had to rely on the Federation army’s advancing to make their way to the Scorching River.

The Brown Army had listed them as high-priority targets. It would be extremely difficult to sneak through their defenses. Furthermore, the Brown Army was treating Wu Ku like a heavenly sensei!

“Wu Ku needs an abundant supply of water to control the rain. He turns the water of the Scorching River into water vapor and spreads it into the sky,” Mo Fan told them.

“So he won’t move to another place if he wants the rain to keep falling,” Mu Bai nodded his understanding.

“Mm, we’ll fight alongside the Federation’s army and defeat the Brown Army on this side of the Scorching River,” Mo Fan decided.

Zhao Manyan’s expression darkened gradually as he listened to the conversation between Mu Bai and Mo Fan.

Holy crap, why do they sound like it is just a simple plan?

What do they mean by defeating the Brown Army on this side of the Scorching River?

It meant they had to f**king help the Federation win the war!
