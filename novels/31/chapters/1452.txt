“Where are Mui Guangqing and the others?” Mo Fan asked.

“We’re dragging them here.” Mu Xumian pointed behind her.

Another bunch of people had arrived behind Mu Xumian. They were not easy opponents, judging from their presence.

Mui Guangqing, Mui Zhuocheng, Dongfang Xifeng, and the others were tied up by icy chains, like criminals in the past. Their minds were completely sealed off. They were walking mindlessly, like a bunch of walking dead.

“It’s the Mu Clan’s Heart-Trapping Lock. It can freeze a person’s mind and soul, and stiffen their body,” Mu Bai whispered to Mo Fan.

“Damn it, Mo Fan, just tear them into pieces!” Zhao Manyan was utterly furious. He did not expect another group of people to show up and claim the fruits of their victory after all the efforts they had put in.

“Don’t be ruthless, that woman is a Super Mage.” Mo Fan held Zhao Manyan back firmly.

“Super Level?” Zhao Manyan was stunned. His temper died quickly as he astutely retreated behind Mo Fan.

It was pretty obvious that Qi Shan had long been colluding with the people of the Mu Clan. He had only volunteered for the operation to be a spy. He would secretly set up a teleportation formation when the others were worn out, allowing the people of the Mu Clan to enter the underground cave once the Sarkinite deposit was destroyed.

The Mui Clan and Dongfang Clan had the ability to set up teleportation formations, too! To make it easier for them to excavate the fire vein, they were planning to set the formations up inside the White Lava, since it was where the valuable resources were.

Setting up a magic formation required a lot of energy, so Mui Zhuocheng had asked Mo Fan to rest up until they were done breaking the Sarkinite plug. Mo Fan would then enter the White Lava to set up the magic formation, allowing the people of the Dongfang Clan and Mui Clan to teleport into the cave. To their surprise, Qi Shan also had a Scroll of Space, which he had used to teleport the people of the Mu Clan into the fire vein!

The Mu Clan had truly invested a lot in their plan. They had purposely placed Mu Xumian in charge of it so the Dongfang Clan and Mui Clan would not stand a chance at all. They were willing to expend a Scroll of Space too, not to mention coming all the way here to obstruct the two clans’ operation!

Mo Fan could not help but admit how cunning the Mu Clan was. Most infuriatingly, Qi Shan turned out to be a narrow-minded traitor, instead of trying to prove himself despite the circumstances. Mo Fan was utterly disappointed and disgusted by the man!

“You can take the things and the place, there’s no need to kill everyone here,” Mo Fan said.

The enemy was obviously well-prepared and tough, especially their leader Mu Xumian, who was a Super Mage!

Without her, Mo Fan might still be able to take on the people of the Mu Clan, giving them the chance to taste death. However, the situation was extremely unfavorable for them. They might even lose their lives if they tried acting ruthlessly!

“Oh my, aren’t you the famous strongest participant in the World College Tournament? Do you have any idea how much our Mu Clan hates you? If I can take care of you, who is such a thorn in our side today, and these two clans that have been an eyesore for so long, I bet the clan will be more than happy to give me a nice seat in the clan meeting...” Mu Xumian said.

“A lot of people have tried to kill me, but do you know why they all died in the end?” Mo Fan decided to do it the hard way, since being soft was not going to work. “My body is a little weak now, so I don’t want to use power beyond what my body can handle. It’s only going to get us both killed. I’m impressed by your plan, and the patience and boldness it required. The things here are yours now, we gladly admit our defeat.”

“Big Sis, the kid is trying to scare us,” spoke up Tong Li, a Mage behind Mu Xumian.

“I don’t need you to tell me that!” Mu Xumian turned around and kicked between Tong Li’s legs. She grunted, “And I told you not to call me Big Sis!”

Tong Li quickly retreated with an apologetic smile.

Mu Xumian turned around as if she was thinking about it, and told Mo Fan, “I don’t believe you, and I have decided to be a little greedy.”

“Well I guess it’s either the fish dies, or the net splits then. Mu Bai, Zhao Manyan, let’s not waste our time any further. Since they aren’t willing to back down, we’ll fight them to the end in blood! Mu Bai, use your Ice Plague Soul-grade Weapon, it’s more than enough to keep the trash she brought busy. Old Zhao, use your Totem Turtle Shell, too! It’s time for us to show them our Demonic Dragon Formation. I would like to see what this Super Mage has against us!” Mo Fan stepped forward with a menacing look.

Zhao Manyan immediately knew what Mo Fan was up to. He immediately unleashed Baxia’s Totem Seal.

As a Super Mage, it went without saying that Mu Xumian would recognize the Seal. She was a little surprised that these unimportant people were actually thinking of challenging a Super Mage!

Mu Bai backed away a little, but he was clearly not trying to run away. He was accumulating his energy instead. The temperature of the scorching cave dropped slightly.

Mo Fan proceeded to Summon Little Flame Belle and let her Possess him. Little Flame Belle was easily at the peak Commander-level, and was even stronger after merging with Mo Fan, especially with her Domain of two kinds of Soul-grade Fire. It was clearly enough to threaten a Super Mage!

“Be careful, those two managed to block a Ruler-level creature’s attack,” Qi Shan whispered to Mu Xumian.

“Ruler-level?” Mu Xumian was startled.

“Didn’t I already tell you when you arrived? There was a little accident; the Fiery-Winged Tyrant saw us...” Qi Shan briefly explained what had happened.

Advanced Mages were usually defenseless against a Ruler-level creature, so Qi Shan had been utterly dumbfounded when he saw Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan’s capabilities. He could not help but feel jealous of them!

“So you’re telling me I shouldn’t fight them?” Mu Xumian asked.

“That’s not what I meant; I’m just warning you so you won’t underestimate them. Those two have some strange abilities, but a Super Mage like you won’t have any trouble taking them down, as long as you are cautious enough,” Qi Shan replied.

“I don’t want them to leave this place alive, either!” Mu Xumian smiled.

Even though Mu Xumian remained smiling, her Domain was already spreading inside the cave. Her pupils emitted an icily murderous flicker as she took a few steps forward!

“Humph, I’m having trouble controlling my power, you are dead for sure. It doesn’t matter if it’s going to kill me too. You have definitely crossed the line. We’ll both go down together!” Mo Fan yelled. His flames were spreading into the surroundings recklessly!

Zhao Manyan did not back down, either. He started yelling while unleashing a few different magic glows, as if he was serious about going all out!

Mu Xumian halted in her tracks. She decided to be a little more cautious after hearing what Qi Shan had said. She first cast a defensive spell...

Mo Fan was capable of knocking a Ruler-level creature flying, so Mu Xumian could not afford to not be on guard. The guy’s strength was almost comparable to the Super Level!

The light of the flames was dazzling. Mo Fan’s roar turned into raging flames, surging at Mu Xumian and the others.

Zhao Manyan set up a thick defense to defend them from Mu Xumian and the other Mages’ attacks. It was unlikely that the Mages would just let Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan cast their spells at will!

The spells from two sides clashed. The impact knocked the people of both sides back slightly.

Mu Xumian let out a few coughs. The smoke from the flames was irritating her nose!

However, she soon discovered that her defense did not break as she thought it might. The energy of the attack was not as powerful as she had assumed it would be!

“Clear up!” Mu Xumian waved her hand, Summoning a wind to blow the smoke away.

For some reason, a strange feeling rose inside her. She was stunned when she saw the two guys that swore to take her down with them running away. She immediately went berserk!

“Assh****!” Mu Xumian cursed. She realized she had only constructed a Star Palace when she was intimidated by them!

A Star Palace was equivalent to casting a Super Spell. Mu Xumian decided to take a cautious, defensive approach, but when she realized the two guys were just putting up an act, she almost failed to construct the Star Palace properly!

“This...this...” Tong Li, Qi Shan, and the rest of the people from the Mu Clan were dumbfounded, too. Didn’t those two say they were going to take them down at the cost of their lives? Why were they running away all of a sudden!?

If they were thinking of running away, why were they yelling so loudly before? They even thought the two were going to cast some destructive spells at the risk of their lives!

—

“Mu Bai, over here!” Mo Fan yelled.

Mu Bai dragged Mui Qing along as he sprinted after Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan.

As soon as they regrouped, Mo Fan immediately unleashed the flames of Meteor Scarlet to encapsulate them as they dashed through the curtain of White Lava!

They immediately heard the blast of a Super Spell as they passed through the curtain. The White Lava shuddered at the incredible force.

However, it was only a slight ripple. The incredible impact was not strong enough to break through the White Lava’s defense!

“Luckily you guys knew what my plan was,” Mo Fan panted heavily. He raised his thumb at both Zhao Manyan and Mu Bai.

“I knew you were trying to run away as soon as you blurted out those strange names!” Zhao Manyan half-laughed.

Mui Qing glanced at the three men in a daze. She was still struggling to collect her thoughts. She could not tell when they had reached an agreement to put up an act in order to run away. “I thought you were really going to fight that b**ch to the end!” Mui Qing said.

“Fight to the end my ass; a Super Mage isn’t just mere decoration. How could we possibly stand a chance against her? Besides, the people behind her were quite strong too!” Mo Fan said.

Mu Bai and Zhao Manyan both nodded agreement.

They clearly did not stand a chance against this enemy. Luckily, Mo Fan was able to move freely through the White Lava. Otherwise, Mu Xumian and her men would have no trouble catching up to them!
