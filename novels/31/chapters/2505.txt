Chapter 2508: He has gone Mad Again!

Translated by XephiZ

Edited by Aelryinth

On the surface, Chairman Shao Zheng was asking Mo Fan to go after the Sea Skeleton King to take revenge after losing horribly in the battle.

The truth was, it was a battle of wits between them and the Emperor!

If the Emperor had shown itself to kill their powerful Mages, the Forbidden Mages would be watching over Mo Fan as he went after the Sea Skeleton King, too.

If the Emperor dared to show itself again, it would have to pay a great price.

Shao Zheng had selected Mo Fan because he was special.

If he was able to kill the Sea Skeleton King without using the Demon Element, the outcome was still acceptable for the Magic City.

If the Emperor tried to save the Sea Skeleton King, Mo Fan could use the Demon Element to keep it busy, and the Emperor would totally expose itself. The Forbidden Mages would be able to trap it and even kill it if it was too aggressive.

Everyone knew an Emperor was watching over the Sea Skeleton King. Therefore, they needed someone who could take on the Sea Skeleton King and hold on against the Emperor until help arrived.

Mo Fan was the only person Shao Zheng could think of.

Mo Fan now had four Elements at the Super Level. The Demon Element had grown a lot stronger together with the number and levels of his Elements. Mo Fan already had the strength to fight Supreme Rulers in the Ancient Capital and Beijiang, so he would not die so easily to an Emperor, even if he was no match against it.

“Mo Fan, I’m begging you,” Shao Zheng said sincerely.

“Chairman, you don’t have to go so far. I know my responsibilities,” Mo Fan said.

“What do you need to hunt down the Sea Skeleton King? Just say it,” Sea Skeleton King said.

“I just need a few people’s help.”

“Sure!”

——

The Wasteland Battlefield…

Countless mage artisans were rebuilding the towers and platforms. The place was smaller than it used to be. The people were rebuilding the place, but they had no idea when it would be smashed into debris once again.

“Zhang Xiaohou.”

“I’m here!”

The commander walked up to Zhang Xiaohou with an order.

“Here is an order from the chairman. You will head to Chongming Island at once to take part in a secret mission.”

Zhang Xiaohou was puzzled.

Wasn’t he stationed here? Other powerful Rulers among the sea monsters were on the move, in addition to the Sea Skeleton King. Was the chief trying to protect him by sending him somewhere else?

That was against Zhang Xiaohou’s wishes. The other soldiers were defending the Magic City with their lives. As a member of the Violet Imperial Battalion, he should be stepping forward when the others were overwhelmed by despair.

“Commander…”

“Aren’t you talking a little too much now? Off you go, or you will be punished according to military law. The mission is being delayed because of you!” the commander warned him.

Zhang Xiaohou took the order and let out a sigh.

The Yangtze River…

Mu Bai was usually untainted by even a speck of dust, but for now was leaning against the trunk of a huge tree. He was dressed like a beggar, but he had a sharp look in his eyes.

The water was rolling fiercely. The river here was over a thousand meters wide, and a perfect hiding place for the sea monsters. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Huangpu River was nowhere close to the size of the Yangtze River, which was wider than some bays and lakes.

Mu Bai had followed the South Wing Platoon from the Dingshan Lake to the Yangtze River. He had not had any time to rest.

“Sir, it’s an order from the highest Magic Association!”

Mu Bai read the letter with a frown.

Its contents were very simple, but the seal on it belonged to someone with a high rank. It had to be a secret mission.

He had no idea who the other members were when being assigned to a secret mission all of a sudden.

“What about our work here?” Mu Bai asked.

“The order comes first,” the South Wing Mage replied.

“You’re right.” Mu Bai knew what his priorities were.

—

Chongming Island…

The land had shrunk significantly due to the rise of the sea level.

Chongming Island was close to the estuary of the Yangtze River. Mu Bai was not too far away.

In order to stop more sea monsters from invading through the Yangtze River and causing massive destruction to the cities, the military had built a tall dam and assigned a troop to guard it.

“Mu Bai?” Zhang Xiaohou said curiously when he saw Mu Bai.

“Why are you here?” Mu Bai looked at Zhang Xiaohou. Wasn’t it supposed to be a secret mission? Mu Bai had thought he was assigned to a random group.

“I didn’t expect us to be assigned to the same group!” Zhang Xiaohou saw the same letter he had received in Mu Bai’s hand.

Mu Bai forced a smile. It seemed like the secret operation was not as terrible as he thought. At least he had a reliable teammate with him.

“Isn’t that guy a little familiar?” Mu Bai pointed at a man with blond hair who was talking to a nurse inside a tent.

“It’s Brother Zhao!” Zhang Xiaohou said.

They were about to walk up to Zhao Manyan when they saw a gorgeous woman with long hair approaching them. Her silver-white hair was unique and elegant. She had a dazzling temperament as she was walking over to them while the wind blew.

“Mu Ningxue?” Mu Bai and Zhang Xiaohou blurted out simultaneously.

Why was Mu Ningxue here as well? She seemed to be holding a letter, too!

Mu Ningxue looked at them and the letters they were holding.

“There’s only one person that would gather us here,” Mu Ningxue said knowingly.

“Mo Fan!” they exclaimed together.

——

The four waited at the designated spot. Mo Fan finally arrived after half an hour.

He was with two other people, a High Seater in a golden robe and a general.

“Is everyone here?” the High Seater asked.

“Yes,” Mo Fan said.

“I thought it was going to be a strong group, but it’s just a bunch of young Mages!” the general spoke up.

“Give them a briefing on the mission, Old Dong and I will arrange the people from the Magic Association and the army,” the High Seater said. He seemed a little disappointed.

He thought Chairman Shao Zheng had organized a special squad to complete the difficult mission, but it turned out to be some young Mages. They might as well go on a vacation. None of them seemed like they had gone through real hardships.

Only five people remained after the two left.

“Mo Fan, what are you up to this time?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“This is the strongest team I can think of. The country is sending us after the Sea Skeleton King!” Mo Fan said.

“HAHAHA, I thought you were referring to the unbeatable Sea Skeleton King that was trying to destroy the Magic City,” Zhao Manyan burst out laughing.

He noticed the others did not have the same reaction as him as he was laughing.

He soon realized Mo Fan was actually referring to the unbeatable Sea Skeleton King. He almost lost his mind, like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

Is Mo Fan going nuts again!?
