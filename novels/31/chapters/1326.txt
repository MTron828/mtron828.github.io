1329 The Black Axe Phantom Vassal

Translated by XephiZ

“How dare you venture here!?”

A thunderous voice came from above as a man in a white coat descended on the wind. His presence was overwhelming. It almost drew away the air in the area that Mo Fan and Bei Jiang were fighting in, turning it into a vacuum.

As the pressure was withdrawn, the air further away began to fill up the area rapidly, resulting in a great storm!

“A Super Mage!” Mo Fan lifted his gaze and fixed his eyes on the man in a white coat.

Bei Jiang was in the dark swamp, and was aware of the Super Mage’s presence, too. The storm continued to shrink, limiting the space that Mo Fan and Bei Jiang could move in.

“Consider yourself lucky!” Bei Jiang laughed mockingly.

The black swamp slowly disappeared. The vacuum storm had suppressed the darkness, but when Mo Fan was planning to use the chance provided by the vacuum storm to take Bei Jiang out, the assassin’s presence suddenly vanished.

The dark swamp had covered the entire plaza. Bei Jiang had disappeared without a trace amid the vacuum storm. The Super Wind Mage in a white coat noticed it too. He stopped the storm from shrinking any further.

Mo Fan did not stand a chance against the Super Spell. He immediately told the Super Mage who he was.

The Mage in a white coat entered the storm and repeated, “You’re Mo Fan, the guy on the national team?”

“Here is my badge, the other guy was an assassin!” Mo Fan briefly told the Super Mage what had happened.

The Super Mage knew the badge could not be a forgery. The others of the Magic Association also saw Mo Fan save the kid who had fallen off the tower before fighting a man in a black robe.

“The assassin is trying to kill an Elder of the Enforcement Union. I don’t have much time to explain the details to you. I’m afraid he’s going after the Elder,” Mo Fan said.

Even a Super Mage had failed to stop Bei Jiang from running away. It explained why the assassin was bold enough to attack Mo Fan in front of the Magic Association. It would be troublesome if they allowed someone like Bei Jiang to escape.

“I’m coming with you!” the Super Wind Mage said.

Feng Zhoulong summoned his Wind Wings and headed straight for the house that Leng Qing was hiding in, together with Mo Fan.

Inside the house, a rotting smell lingered in the air. Xiao Ping was so scared that she did not even dare to open the windows.

The people left in the unit were Xiao Ping; Lingling; Leng Qing, who was lying on the bed; and Little Flame Belle, who was lying beside Lingling. Xiao Ping was feeling very insecure.

“I’ll go get some food,” Xiao Ping said.

She went to the kitchen. An old light bulb was hanging above her. It swayed slightly as she entered the kitchen. Its light projected a tiny shadow under Xiao Ping’s feet.

Xiao Ping was preparing some simple food. She was tensed and spooked, yet she did not notice the shadow under her feet moving eerily, like an evil phantom. It was silently climbing her back...

“Ling!~”

Little Flame Belle suddenly opened her eyes. She stared towards the kitchen.

Following a groan, a slender figure fell to the floor in the kitchen. Fresh blood started pouring out from the body and flowed into the next room.

Lingling’s eyes widened. She was struggling to believe Xiao Ping, an Enforcer, could die so easily, like an ordinary girl.

“Ling~!”

Little Flame Belle unleashed the flames of Ardent Sunset when she sensed danger approaching. The flames rose and spread across the ceiling.

The blazing flames immediately drove away the shadow moving behind Lingling, and the black claw that was reaching out from under Leng Qing’s bed!

The flames had driven away the darkness and defended them from its attacks for the time being. Lingling was surrounded by the heat of the scorching flames, yet she was still breaking out in a cold sweat.

There was really an assassin who could kill without making a single noise in this world!

“Pendant of Protection!”

Lingling knew her sister was in danger. She jumped onto Leng Qing’s chest and clutched a charm she was wearing firmly.

The charm glowed with a yellow light. A barrier with the appearance of a honeycomb surrounded them completely.

Meanwhile, a loud crash came from the metal sheet roof above the house. A black axe broke through the roof and went right at Leng Qing’s head!

Clank!

The black axe failed to penetrate the yellow honeycomb barrier. However, the house collapsed, as it could not withstand the impact, revealing Lingling, Little Flame Belle, and Leng Qing inside it.

When the building collapsed, Lingling noticed a phantom holding a black axe standing outside. It was half again as tall as the house. Its outline was vague and blurry.

There were other residents in the area, but they were unable to see the creature. It had the ability to blend into the night!

The noise had woken the nearby residents up. They did not even have the time to put on their clothes. They immediately ran out of their houses and fled in all directions.

Luckily, the Black Axe Phantom Vassal was not interested in their lives. It lifted its axe with both hands and slammed it down.

The powerful hit left a huge crack on Lingling’s honeycomb barrier. It could only endure a few more blows!

“Ling!~”

Little Flame Belle could not do anything to the phantom. Her flames were useless against it. Luckily, the smart Little Flame Belle suddenly unleashed another flame, which swiftly wrapped around her.

The two flames combined as a slender figure appeared amid them. Little Flame Belle had to transform into her real form to use her power to maximum potential! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Flame Belle’s gaze sharpened as she emitted a silver light. Her will slammed into the Black Axe Phantom Vassal like a fierce tide.

The Space Element was effective. The Black Axe Phantom Vassal was knocked back by the force and fell heavily to the ground. However, even though it had fallen onto a house, the house was perfectly fine!

“Fire Elemental Spirit, Flame Belle?” a deep voice on the street spoke up. The figure was wearing a black robe and a mask. It was impossible to see his true appearance on the dimly-lit street. It would have been difficult to notice his presence if he had not spoken first.

Bei Jiang did not expect Leng Qing to have a Fire Elemental Creature protecting her!

Luckily, his Phantom Vassal was formless, so Elemental Magic was ineffective against it. Otherwise, he might have had trouble dealing with the Flame Belle!

Flame Belle soon noticed the culprit behind the attack on the deserted street.

She reached her hand out and pointed in Bei Jiang’s direction. Her flames rose suddenly and fired several fireballs at the street rapidly, leaving scorched holes in it!

Bei Jiang remained calm. He had vanished into thin air as the fireballs were flying in his direction. As usual, he had disappeared without a trace. Flame Belle tried to look around, yet she had no idea where he went.

Meanwhile, the Black Axe Phantom Vassal had risen to its feet. To Flame Belle’s surprise, the enormous creature vanished into thin air too, as if they had both left the place...

The dark energy was still lingering in the air, so there was still danger around. Flame Belle knew her job was to look after Lingling and Leng Qing, so she did not dare to move away. She stood beside Lingling and Leng Qing, using her flames to set up a circle of defense, not allowing anything to move closer to them.

“Six Wings Protection!” a voice came from the sky.

It was the Super Wind Mage, Feng Zhoulong. His white Wind Wings were stacking over top of Lingling and Leng Qing like the wings of an angel.

The Serpents of Darkness were pouncing at them. Flame Belle was totally unaware of the attacks. Her flames were unable to detect them.

The Six Wings Protection had appeared right on time. The Serpents of Darkness were attacking from all directions. The ghastly-looking serpents wriggled their bodies, but soon dissipated into black mist after the Six Wings Protection successfully stopped them.

“I’ll be back again, tsk tsk...”

Bei Jiang’s laughter echoed through the urban village. Mo Fan and Feng Zhoulong tried to chase after him, but it was exactly the same as before. They were unable to track Bei Jiang down. The guy had simply vanished into thin air!

“Such terrifying ability!” Feng Zhoulong murmured.

A Super Mage was a lot more perceptive than an Advanced Mage, yet Feng Zhoulong still could not sense Bei Jiang. An assassin like him was truly terrifying. Even a Super Mage could be killed by him if they were not being cautious enough!

Mo Fan was feeling uneasy, too. It was his first time going up against such a terrifying and tricky enemy. Mo Fan felt he would die the instant he lowered his guard when he was fighting the assassin. To make things worse, they were completely exposed, while the assassin was hiding somewhere. He seemed very confident in his abilities. It was difficult to tell when he was going to strike again, and it was unlikely they could be on guard for twenty-four hours every day!

“Xiao Ping, quick, take a look at her,” Lingling urged.

Mo Fan went to the kitchen and saw Xiao Ping lying in a pool of blood...

“She’s still alive!” Mo Fan did not hesitate to use his sacred medicine to save Xiao Ping’s life.

Xiao Ping’s throat was sliced, so she was losing blood quickly. If he was any slower, she would not have had any chance of surviving.

Perhaps Bei Jiang did not think Mo Fan and Feng Zhoulong would arrive so quickly, nor did he expect Leng Qing to be protected by a powerful Flame Belle.

Most importantly, Mo Fan had the sacred medicine of the Parthenon Temple. Without it, Xiao Ping would be dead for sure!

Even Bei Jiang assumed Xiao Ping was going to die, so he could not have cared less about her. He could not have expected that his target would have the sacred medicine of the Parthenon Temple, since not every person would be carrying some around with them. Besides, his actual target was Leng Qing!
