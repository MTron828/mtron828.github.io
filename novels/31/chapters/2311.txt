Even though Mo Fan and his crew were no longer fighting in the front line, the flames of the war would eventually reach them.

Their superiors did not let them withdraw to the rear right away. As more soldiers joined the battle, the volunteer Mages who were planning to preserve their energy were pushed back into the enemy lines again.

“General Blair wants us to regroup with the Savage Bull Riders and destroy the Brown’s walls and watchtowers,” Lt. Colonel Mason said helplessly.

They had already done the hard work of finding the right path through the swamp. Now they had to risk their lives to take down the enemy’s walls and defenses! The Federation Army was obviously going to work them to death...

“Let’s fight then! It’s important to win the first battle,” Mo Fan nodded.

They had no other choice if their superiors did not allow them to withdraw. Luckily, they did not have to fight in the front line as cannon fodder anymore.

The Savage Bull Riders had invaded the enemy’s camps some time ago. Their mission was to destroy the Brown Rebels’ watchtowers.

The Brown Rebels had a watchtower every three to five hundred meters. The towers were built from trunks of thick jungle trees, wrapped with vines.

The watchtowers provided the Brown Rebels with a perfect view of the Federation forces. Each tower had a garrison of between twenty to fifty Intermediate Mages. They were the stronger ranged attack Mages in the Brown forces.

Intermediate Spells had a wider area of effect and range, so those Intermediate Mages were able to inflict serious damage on the soldiers of the Federation Army by Casting the spells from the towers.

In other words, those towers were the main firepower of the enemy’s base. The Federation Army would suffer great casualties over time if the towers remained standing.

——

Captain Benson received the order to destroy the watchtowers reluctantly. They were only able to break through the enemy’s defenses previously because of the Frost Mammoths.

The Frost Mammoths Mo Fan had Summoned were in the middle of being chased by the Throat-Ripping Tyrannosaurs. They were still in a panic when they ran out of the Summoning Gate, so the destruction they had caused was even greater than normal.

The Frost Mammoths had already returned to the Summoned Beast Plane; the Savage Bull Riders had only exploited the Frost Mammoth’s might. Their advance was no longer as effective. They were currently trapped close to a lake by an enemy brigade of nearly a thousand soldiers.

“Damn it, we advanced too far!. We are separated from our main force!” Captain Benson cursed.

“Look out, it’s a combined attack of Wind Discs!” one of the Riders yelled.

The rain was still falling irregularly. The trees ahead of the troop were swaying wildly and splinters of wood were hurling at the Riders. The wind almost knocked the Riders to the ground.

The combined Wind Discs formed a huge tornado that had appeared when the Wind Mages Cast their Wind Discs simultaneously. The Savage Bull Riders were facing a ferocious tornado with a diameter of a hundred and fifty meters, which was now hurtling toward them like a hunting beast!

Even the trees with deep roots along the way were being uprooted, let alone the shrubs and the reeds.

“Lie down and take cover!” Captain Benson yelled desperately.

The Savage Bulls were lifted off the ground one by one. They did not have anything to grab onto.

The Wind Discs were gone in no time, just like they had appeared out of nowhere.

Those who managed to hold their ground only suffered some cuts and bruises, but the rest were hurled into the sky. It was difficult to tell whether they were going to survive the fall.

The tornado was in the shape of a cone, with its tip on the ground and its base in the sky.

The Savage Bulls and their Riders had been thrown to its highest point in the sky. The diameter at the top was a good thousand meters. It was hard to imagine what the people were going through up there.

——

Lt. Colonel Mason and his men arrived after the tornado was dispersed. He was dumbfounded when he saw the miserable state the troop of Savage Bull Rider cavalry was in.

He was relieved that he had come a little late. Otherwise, they would have fallen victim to the tornado, too!

Mo Fan stared at the huge tornado that had drifted into the distance before turning his gaze on at a watchtower around two kilometers away.

The Wind Mages in the watchtower were the ones who had Cast the combination of Wind Discs. It was likely that the watchtower was staffed by a platoon of powerful Wind Mages. The watchtower was even able to increase their damage output!

No wonder the leaders of the Federation Army were so keen to destroy the enemy’s watchtowers first. Their army would lose most of its fighting capacity in just a few rounds of attacks like this!

“How did you lose so many men in such a short time?” Zhao Manyan asked after he found Captain Benson.

“The enemy launched a fierce counterattack as soon as the Frost Mammoths were gone. Damn it, why couldn’t the Summoner last a little longer?” Benson grumbled.

Captain Benson clearly had no idea Mo Fan was the person who had Summoned the Frost Mammoths, since he was cursing Mo Fan right in front of him.

Mo Fan did not have a choice. The Summoning Tide would only last for a limited time. It might have lasted a little longer if he had Summoned his wolves.

However, they were on a battlefield. The wolves would be hit by Elemental Spells falling from the sky every few steps. Mo Fan treated his wolves preciously. He would not risk their lives for the sake of the Federation!

“Hah, I thought the Federation has turned their elites into assault troops, but it turns out to be a bunch of petty Riders. What a waste of my time!” an arrogant voice called out.

The ground was scattered with broken branches and fallen leaves. The man who spoke was wearing heavy metal boots and a yellow-brown military outfit. His hair was shoulder-length and his skin was a little tanned.

He was playing with an airflow in the shape of a rope with his fingers. He was even bold enough to approach the troop of Savage Bull Riders alone!

The Savage Bull Riders only had around two hundred men left. Both the Savage Bulls and their Riders were a lot stronger than a Basic Mage. This general of the Brown Rebels clearly did not treat them seriously if he dared to come alone.

“Who are you? Tell us your name!” Captain Benson challenged him instantly.

“Is Lt. Colonel Mason here?” the Brown general demanded arrogantly, completely ignoring Captain Benson’s question.

Mason was hiding behind the Riders. For some reason, he grinned when he heard the enemy general mention his name!

“If this so-called Mason did kill Bucker the Necromancer, he’s worthy for me to come and take his life. I’m here solely to kill Mason. As for the rest… I have no interest in you,” the general stated.

“I’m Lt. Colonel Mason! Tell me your name! I’m not interested in a nobody, either!” Mason shouted as he stepped forward.

Mo Fan’s face darkened when he saw Mason’s response. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Black chimpanzee, can’t you know your place for once?

Did he really think he was a legend who could take down enemy generals on behalf of his army by himself?!
