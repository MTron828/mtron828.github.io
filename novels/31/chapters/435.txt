Chapter 436: I’ll Give You My Heart

Mo Fan was a Shadow Magician, so he could easily detect a stronger than normal presence of the Shadow Element.

The Shadow Element resembled darkness, and ordinary darkness would be driven away by light easily, yet real darkness could absorb light like a black hole, without any glimpse of light.

The light from the school was gloomy, but normally the rays would still scatter through the woods. However, the woods were in complete darkness at this time, and would turn into walls of darkness if the place were slightly darker.

The walls of darkness did not stop one from passing them, but those inside them would lose their sense of direction and return to their original starting point after taking a few more steps.

“He’s an expert of the Shadow Element... I have to find him,” Mo Fan carefully concealed himself in the zone of darkness and waited patiently.

Mo Fan initially thought he would catch a shameless culprit who was trying to infiltrate the girls’ dorm red-handed, but to his surprise, the guy did not seem like he was planning to trespass into the dorm. He was only maintaining the dark zone to conceal himself perfectly.

Mo Fan had no choice but to remain patient. It was obvious that the enemy’s Shadow Element was significantly stronger than his, so exposing his presence would only drive the enemy away.

Two fangs that were worth twenty million RMB!

Some time later, Mo Fan suddenly heard movement from the room at the end of the corridor.

Mo Fan immediately glanced at the balcony and saw a seemingly delicate girl climbing down along the water pipe from the balcony...

-Isn’t that Liu Ru!? -, yelled Mo Fan to himself.

It was indeed Liu Ru, who looked extremely weak. Mo Fan felt like she would fall in any second as she was climbing down the pipe.

Either way, she managed to make it to the ground. She opened a gap in the chainlink fence and easily snuck out into the woods.

The woods were covered in darkness. Her slim figure was soon devoured by the darkness as she ventured deeper, as if she were about to disappear without a trace.

Mo Fan’s heart sank when he sensed that the girl was approaching danger.

“Damn it, the vampire has already bewitched Liu Ru. She must have been unwell because the guy has already been sucking her blood for quite a while!” cursed Mo Fan in his heart.

As the protector of young girls, Mo Fan would not tolerate such an act. How dare the vampire use such a shameless method on the young girls he was protecting!

Liu Ru was walking right into the trap. Luckily, Mo Fan was keeping an eye on her today. Otherwise, he could not tell what would happen to her. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The vampire was more than cold-blooded. He had already sucked the elder sister dry, and now he was already preying on the younger sister Liu Ru instead of laying low...

Mo Fan was not in a rush to make his move. He had still not seen the vampire.

His eyes were still fixed on Liu Ru, as his Shadow Element allowed him to have a clear vision in the dark.

Liu Ru was still heading deeper into the woods. She was wearing a blank face, as if she was sleepwalking.

As she arrived at a small clearing in the woods, the outline of a coat finally appeared from the darkness.

The coat was bright red, its collars up. The person’s sharp jaw and the side of his face were concealed by the collar, with only his pointy nose and strangely glistening eyes exposed.

Mo Fan could not see his face clearly, as a strange mist was concealing it. It was most likely a common method used by the vampires to hide their faces, as they could not afford to expose their appearances, if they had to hide among humans...

Liu Ru placed her hands behind her back as she slowly walked toward the man in the coat. A strange mist was lingering in the darkness, with a unique pleasant scent...

The delicate Liu Ru stood in front of the man in the coat. She slowly raised her head, like a pretty maiden ordered to present herself to the emperor.

The man in the coat slowly spread his arms wide, like a man on a secret date giving his lover a simple hug.

The bewitched Liu Ru took a step forward, diving into the man’s hug. Meanwhile, something flickered between the lips under the man’s collars, something sharp. It turned out to be two exposed fangs reaching the man’s jaw... the fangs that were worth twenty million RMB!

Mo Fan groaned inwardly. As he was about to make his move, he suddenly saw something emitting a cold flicker in Liu Ru’s hands behind her back...

A cold dagger was drawn out from her back. Her eyes that initially had a blank expression flickered with hatred, as she raised the dagger in her hand and thrust it at the firm figure in front without hesitation!

The dagger stabbed deep into the man’s chest where his heart was.

However, there was no sign of blood pouring out from the man’s chest, as if the dagger were stabbing at a corpse.

Mo Fan was stunned. He did not expect Liu Ru to make such a move all of a sudden!

She had placed her hands behind her back. Mo Fan was not aware that she was actually hiding a silver dagger!

“Tsk tsk... what a surprise, to see a commoner like you able to resist my Lunar Charm,” uttered the man in a sinister voice.

He remained standing in his place. The dagger punctured his heart, yet he did not cry out in pain, but was talking to Liu Ru in an intrigued manner.

Liu Ru quickly took a few steps back. Her eyes were filled with anger and hatred.

“Such a pity, the legends you were told about vampires are fake. It’s useless thrusting a silver dagger into our hearts...oh, if you are so fond of my heart, I’ll give it to you. I’ll give you everything that you like, to show how much I like you,” drawled a sinister voice.

Soon after, the man in the coat spread out his claws and grabbed at his heart.

His claws tore his chest open, revealing a bloody hole, from which he grabbed his heart...

It was a fresh heart, still beating audibly at a fast pace.

The heart had a silver dagger sticking into it, without any sign of blood...

“I’ve already given you my heart. You won’t find any man that’s perfect like me!” The man’s tone was eerie.

Liu Ru was still an ordinary girl after all. Despite the overwhelming wrath in her heart driving her to avenge her sister, she was terrified and subconsciously took a few steps back after seeing the vampire’s abnormal actions.
