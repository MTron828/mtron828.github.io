The Lord of Darkness suddenly exhaled when Asha’ruiya set foot on the White Widow’s tile.

The tile that was covered in grass started shaking. Cracks began to appear in the air above the tile.

A light hint of blue was added to the green field. It was not obvious at first sight. It was like applying a filter to an image, but Asha’ruiya felt a strange coldness and humidity as she was walking on it.

Asha’ruiya looked down and realized she had walked onto a lake. The clear water was almost unnoticeable. She could even see pebbles, seaweed, and colorful sand at the bottom of the waters.

She looked up and noticed a few hills rising up from the lake.

Asha’ruiya had been to many places in China. Among them, Guilin had left her with a strong impression. The lake and the islands that had appeared out of nowhere were reminding her of Guilin. She felt like she had walked into a dazzling painting.

“A dazzling woman like you deserves a dazzling battlefield, even if you are going to end up bloody, don’t you think?” the Lord of Darkness chuckled.

He was not just referring to Asha’ruiya. It sounded like the White Widow was a dazzling woman to him, too!

The White Widow was walking on the surface of the lake. She was light enough to remain above the surface of the lake. Small ripples were spreading across the lake from the tiny vibrations of the hairs on her legs.

Certain creatures had poor vision. They mainly relied on their hearing.

A spider normally ‘listened’ with its legs. The Widow’s legs were vibrating rapidly while she was moving across the water. The ripples were so tiny that they were barely visible.

Asha’ruiya advanced while the White Widow remained still. She was eerily quiet.

“Thunderclap Shadow!”

Asha’ruiya had mainly focused on improving her Shadow Element. She had perfectly merged her magic and her sword mastery. She had further improved it after she Awakened her Super Power after becoming a Super Mage.

She pointed her sword forward, and a dark bolt of lightning sliced at the White Widow.

The White Widow did not show any intention to move away at first, but just as the lightning was about to reach her, she moved sideways and dodged the unexpected lightning bolt!

“Shadow Weave Sword!”

Shadows in the shape of swords swept across the lake, leaving gaps that took an unnaturally long time to be filled by the water.

The White Widow moved nimbly between the slashes. She covered just enough distance to dodge the slashes, despite their numbers and speed. Somehow, she managed to evade them all perfectly.

The others were dumbfounded by the sight.

Asha’ruiya’s attacks were quite powerful. Most enemies would have been shredded by them, yet the White Widow had dodged them perfectly even after her strength was reduced by thirty percent. It felt like her limbs were able to predict where Asha’ruiya’s attacks were coming from in advance.

Asha’ruiya was soon covered in sweat. Her attacks were not just for display. Every slash could easily tear through the defense of a Ruler-level creature. She had once killed a Dark Swordmaster with the same slash when she was fighting the enemy knight.

The White Widow’s body was still perfectly white. Her skin did not look sturdy, but the outcome of the battle was pretty obvious if Asha’ruiya could not land a single blow on her.

The White Widow continued to move agilely across the water, but soon took to the air. Asha’ruiya assumed the creature was walking on invisible spider silk, but her slashes did not hit anything when she aimed them at the air. The White Widow continued to walk toward Asha’ruiya ‘elegantly’.

The spider’s pale head was covered in strange runes. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she had a long tongue.

Her human face was on its spider-like body.

The White Widow was not very large, her body sized similarly to a human’s. Her eyes had remained fixed on Asha’ruiya, even when she was dodging the slashes, never shifting her gaze away.

“I have to endure terrible pain every time I change my skin. It feels like a scalpel is cutting through my skin, but I don’t mind going through the pain if I can have your pretty face. Don’t you worry, I won’t damage your face. After all, who would want to leave scars on their own face?” The White Widow surprisingly spoke a human language. She sounded arrogant and crazy.

When she burst out laughing, her spooky voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

She was planning to claim Asha’ruiya’s face!

No wonder the Lord of Darkness had referred to her as a dazzling woman. The White Widow was crazy about her beauty, but her way of making herself prettier was by taking someone else’s face!

There were women among the pawns. They shivered when they heard the White Widow’s words. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They would rather destroy their own face and body than let a monster claim them!

“~~~~~~~~~~~”

The White Widow’s piercing laughter was hurting everyone’s ears and making their scalps turn numb.

There was no prior warning before she began attacking.

Most creatures would slightly lean backward or bend their knees when they were attacking, but there was no sign of that when the White Widow began her attack.

However, her speed and power were ridiculous. Her movement was followed by a huge blast of wind. Asha’ruiya backed away instinctively, but the White Widow’s deadly claws were already within inches of her!

Her throat, heart, eyes, and stomach were her vital parts!

The people could barely see the White Widow’s movement and attacks. Similarly, Asha’ruiya was also moving so quickly that they could only see her shadows as she was dodging the White Widow’s claws.

The two exchanged countless blows in just a few seconds. Sparks and slashes were flying across the place. In the end, Asha’ruiya distanced herself from the White Widow with Blink and withdrew to a hill in the distance.

Her shoulders, legs, elbows, and back were covered in wounds. Mo Fan was relieved when he saw the cuts were shallow.

Asha’ruiya knew the White Widow’s claws were poisonous. She had taken the necessary precautions.

“It seems like I must take this more seriously,” Asha’ruiya murmured as she checked her wounds.

She could still tolerate the minor injuries. It was better than being stabbed and torn apart.

Asha’ruiya closed her eyes, as if she did not need to rely on her eyes to see the enemy.

The Aura of darkness around her suddenly enlarged and spread like a storm while she was standing still!
