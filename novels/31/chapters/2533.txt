Mo Fan had just finished the pear, and before he could wipe his mouth Asha’ruiya walked out of the darkness. He had to say, the woman’s alluring curves were oddly charming as she was walking out of the dark mist.

Asha’ruiya never bothered to conceal her charms. She would shake her hips more than normal women as she was walking. It was a great contrast to her sacred image as a Saintess of the Parthenon Temple.

“They are looking for someone who has escaped into the desert. They were trying to silence everyone at the scene, but they failed to hunt down the last survivor. We might be able to learn the truth from the last person who is still alive. We must find her before them,” Asha’ruiya told him.

“Is it her?” Mo Fan took out Sharjah’s photo.

Asha’ruiya took a close look at the photo before asking with a stern look, “Do you have ties with her, too?”

“...” Mo Fan was speechless. Why did everyone assume he was a playboy?

The word ‘too’ was quite saddening…

“Is it her?” Mo Fan was not in the mood to joke around with Asha’ruiya.

“Most likely. The man did say it was a woman before he died. In addition, the Guild of the Wicked and us aren’t the only ones looking for her. The Asia Magic Association, the Sacred Hall of Liberty, Liden Royal Family, Hunter Union, Assassin Palace, Black Vatican, and certain mysterious people are all looking for her, too!” Asha’ruiya went on.

“Did you learn all of that from interrogating the man?” Mo Fan asked, surprised

“Of course not, I have my own sources. I came to join in on the fun since so many people are looking for her. Unfortunately, I’m just a delicate woman, so I need a strong ally,” Asha’ruiya replied smoothly.

“You have some other goals in mind,” Mo Fan said firmly.

“Yeah, but I’m not going to hurt you, don’t you think?” Asha’ruiya agreed.

“I can’t say for sure,” Mo Fan shrugged.

“Then why did you eat the pear I sliced? What if it was poisoned?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“I was hungry.”

“Alright, we have already probed one another. Don’t worry, we weren’t enemies in the past, and we aren’t enemies now, either. I can’t say for sure for in the future, but let’s worry about it when it happens.” Asha’ruiya stretched out, displaying her alluring physique. A normal man would not be able to withstand the temptation for more than a second.

The people of the Guild of the Wicked were fully prepared to spend a long time in the desert, considering the amount of food and water they had brought. It was likely that Sharjah had escaped deep into the desert or was hiding in a maze somewhere.

Their first priority was to find Sharjah. If so many people were desperately looking for Sharjah, the incident had to be more complicated than something minor that the Black Vatican was responsible for!

——

“Their president Tyker is in the oasis ahead. He’s waiting for his men to bring him the supplies,” Asha’ruiya informed Mo Fan.

Mo Fan nodded. He was using Blinks continuously just to reach their destination quicker. He was not trying to preserve his energy.

He had to find Sharjah before others did!

They crossed a cold land of sand and encountered some sand dunes. It was a sign they were venturing deeper into the desert. There were fewer plants and even fewer sources of water.

The moon was hanging high in the sky, curved like a silver scimitar.

Its light shone down upon an oasis full of succulents. Most of them were cacti as tall as trees. They had grown out of the sand in the middle of the desert.

The oasis was a good shelter from the winds and sandstorms. Many travelers would use it to get some rest.

Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya knew the oasis was occupied. They went straight into it like a couple who were traveling in the desert.

There were quite a lot of people in the oasis, including a group of merchants traveling in their jeeps, a group of merchants with Camel Elephants, and several wanderers who were getting some rest.

“Are you two here to enjoy the strange sight of the moon?” a man with a huge belly asked.

“Yes, we are astronomy enthusiasts!” Asha’ruiya answered cheerfully.

“Then I wonder if you are interested in enjoying the view of a red land of sand too,” the man smiled, revealing his golden teeth.

“It depends on what the sand is made of. If it’s the blood of wicked people, I wouldn’t mind having a dance on it!” Asha’ruiya retained her smile, but her gaze sharpened.

The man with golden teeth gradually withdrew his friendly smile. It was replaced by a menacing grin.

“I’m pretty sure your blood is a better choice,” the man said coldly.

The black-robed man suddenly faded into the darkness. It was surprising that such a plump man could move as nimbly as a ghost.

The man swung a golden Blade over his head. Wild lightning was flickering on it, and split into shocking numbers of lightning arcs scattering across the area.

“Die!” Golden Teeth chopped the Blade at the ground. He had lifted the weapon with both hands, but he was swinging it down with one hand.

The lightning arcs that were moving aimlessly surged at Mo Fan and Asha’ruiya as if they had found their target. They were strong enough to raze a hill to the ground.

Asha’ruiya was a little surprised. One could never judge a book by its cover. She did not expect the plump man to possess such strength. A single swing of the Blade had unleashed countless bolts of lightning!

Mo Fan stepped forward. His eyes were fixed on Golden Teeth and the lightning bolts that were heading his way.

His eyes suddenly glittered, and the wild lightning strikes that were surging wildly and destroying everything in their path all vanished in an instant!

The man chopped into the ground with his Blade like an idiot, without any special effects. His Blade was too far away from his target.

Golden Teeth was stunned. However, as the third-in-command of the Guild of the Wicked, he had experienced many bizarre encounters. He quickly raised his Blade again to summon the lightning forth once more.

“I’ll admit my defeat if you can use a single Lightning spell in front of me!” Mo Fan stared at Golden Teeth. He was giving off the Aura of a mountain without a visible top as he walked slowly toward the plump man.

Golden Teeth waved his Blade around vigorously, but every lightning bolt he unleashed would almost instantly be extinguished after barely a little sparkle.

“What the Hell did you do!?” Golden Teeth blurted out in a panic.

“Have a taste of it yourself.. I bet you have never experienced the feeling of being tortured by your own magic!” Mo Fan flipped his palm.
