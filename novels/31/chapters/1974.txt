The group had retreated to their previous spot, and everyone was struggling to calm themselves.

They were currently surrounded by rocks, in addition to the lack of sunlight. If the spiders did have the ability to camouflage themselves on the rocks, the spiders might be everywhere as long as there were rocks nearby!

The mercenaries felt their hair standing on end. Previously, they only needed to look up in case the Bone-Eating Spiders pounced on them from above. However, they now had to constantly keep an eye on the surroundings too, since a Bone-Eating Spider might be lying in every blind corner around them.

The Bone-Eating Spiders also existed in deserts and barren lands, but no one had ever heard of their ability to camouflage themselves. The Bone-Eating Spiders on Tianshan Mountain might have developed the ability due to the harsh environment, or perhaps the species here possessed some ancient lineage. Either way, everyone was trembling with fear after learning the Bone-Eating Spiders’ ability.

The whole place suddenly fell quiet, since the demon creatures might ambush the group from any corner. The Bone-Eating Spiders were not making any noise, nor could the humans hear their movements. The heavy breathing of the mercenaries was making everyone nervous instead. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Nanyu, can’t you hear their movements?” Guan Yu asked urgently.

Nanyu shook her head.

The Bone-Eating Spiders’ movements were too light. The sound of their movements was softer than a fly beating its wings. Humans could hear a fly buzzing because it was beating its wings at a high frequency.

The cunning Bone-Eating Spiders were slow and cautious when they moved around. Nanyu’s Sound Element was not effective, unless the Bone-Eating Spiders took the initiative to attack or picked up their pace when they were getting impatient.

“My Dark Material isn’t working either. These things don’t move at all,” Mo Fan said helplessly.

“If there’s nothing we can do, we’ll just hold our ground as long as they aren’t moving,” Zhao Manyan said.

The group did not dare to move to spots that they had not checked carefully. Heavens knew if a Bone-Eating Spider was waiting right beside them or under their feet. To their relief, the Bone-Eating Spiders were not completely invisible. They could still see their unusual lines when they were moving on the walls and the rocks.

The Mailong Private Military Group did not have a better idea. The Bone-Eating Spiders showed no intention of attacking them. The Mages managed to kill a few Bone-Eating Spiders that carelessly exposed themselves, but it did not make any real difference.

A strange rumble came from a great distance. Nanyu, who naturally had outstanding hearing, stood still and listened carefully.

“It’s far away from us...” Nanyu murmured.

Nanyu said with a frown after listening to the rumble for a few minutes, “Could it be a beast tide?”

“What are you talking about?” Mo Fan asked with a puzzled look.

“Something formidable is approaching from the distance,” Nanyu said.

“How far is it?” Mo Fan asked.

“Around seven to eight kilometers,” Nanyu said.

“Seven to eight kilometers? It’s none of our business. Perhaps some Hunter Group is being chased around after messing with a pack of demon creatures,” Zhao Manyan said.

“It didn’t sound like that...” Nanyu shook her head.

Nanyu felt uneasy. She kept listening to the rumble.

Around ten minutes later, Nanyu had a gloomy face. “I think I know what the Bone-Eating Spiders are waiting for,” she said.

“Are they waiting for backup?”

“Ai Jiangtu, you must tell the Vice Leader that we have to find a huge slope within half an hour. Otherwise, the landslides will bury us all alive... the Bone-Eating Spiders are waiting until we are buried to dig us out and eat us!” Nanyu said.

The Rift Valley was leading them higher up the mountain. If a landslide poured down in a strong current, it was going to fill most of the canyons, creeks, and paths. The caves and cracks without enough support were going to collapse from impact of the debris.

Therefore, they had to find a tall slope against the landslide to provide them with some cover!

The Bone-Eating Spiders had to be familiar with the occurrence of the landslides. They did not engage the humans because they had figured out an easier way to take them all out. They were simply keeping them in the sections where the landslide was going to crush them all soon!

The Bone-Eating Spiders could easily find shelter when the landslide occurred, but it was not the same case for the humans!

—

“What!?”

“The landslide is going to reach here within half an hour? Damn it, why did it have to happen now, of all times?”

“These Bone-Eating Spiders must have used the same trick to kill many of their prey. Otherwise, how could their numbers grow so quickly in a barren land like this?”

Kuma frowned. They did spot a suitable slope along the way, but they had to travel a kilometer back the way they came. However, they had struggled to travel four or five hundred meters. How were they supposed to go back a kilometer? How many Bone-Eating Spiders that were prepared to feast on them would they stumble into?

“There’s no other choice. We must head to the slope now!”

“The ninth team will open a path for us. The other teams will be following behind!” Kuma said.

“Affirmative!”

“Affirmative!”

Zhao Manyan almost lost his temper when he heard the order.

“Damn it, why should we be their spotlights? We all know the path is going to be crawling with the Bone-Eating Spiders!” Zhao Manyan cursed.

“I’ll lead the way. Stick close to me,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“Be careful, the Bone-Eating Spiders might be only a few meters or even closer to you. You won’t have time to use your magic,” Nanyu said.

“It’s fine, I have good reactions,” Ai Jiangtu said confidently.

“I’ll stay behind him to deal with the creatures in his blind spots,” Mu Ningxue said.

Ai Jiangtu and Mu Ningxue took the lead. The rest followed behind them closely.

The people of the Mailong Private Military Group followed too after the ninth team set out. They moved at a quick pace.

The Bone-Eating Spiders waiting on the rocks finally began to move when the group decided to leave the area.

The creatures were no longer probing them, and obviously knew the humans were trying to escape. They started dropping from the cliffs, cracks, and walls to attack the humans recklessly.

“I’ll deal with them. Keep going!” Mo Fan knew the creatures were not going to watch them leave. His Space Bolts had long been hovering around him.

The Bone-Eating Spiders were dropping from the ceiling and the walls on both sides. Mo Fan’s Space Bolts pierced through them as they were falling through the air.
