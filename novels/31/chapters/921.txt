Having the English team as his final opponent, Mo Fan somehow felt that even the heavens agreed that life had been too kind to him lately, and had decided to give him a heavy blow. Otherwise, why would the English team be his last opponent when there were so many other countries?

The English team was likely to be in the top three, or at least top five of the whole world!

“Is anyone willing to take part in the duels?” Bai Dongwei scanned the defenders and saw half of them taking a step back.

Bai Dongwei was immediately enraged. He pointed at the students and scolded, “A bunch of useless idiots, eager to participate against weaker teams, yet immediately turn into cowards when a strong team comes. Being able to fight a strong team is a great chance to learn! It’s more about the spirit, do you understand?”

“Instructor, we don’t want to be crushed. We just got our confidence back,” one of the defenders murmured.

Bai Dongwei looked helpless. As a matter of fact, when the English team entered the hall, he could already tell the students were in a bad position. Their opponent was being very polite, yet everyone on the English team was actually like a tiger or a wolf.

“What is the challenge going to be?” asked Mo Fan.

“Four on four, standard team battle,” said Bai Dongwei.

“It looks like they have decided who their representatives are, how about us?” asked Mo Fan.

“I’ll go,” Mu Nujiao knew the fight was extremely important to Mo Fan. If they lost, he had to wait until the next roster change of the national team. No one knew how long that was going to take.

“Humph, a strong country is nothing to be scared of, either!” Dongfang Lie stepped forward. He seemed pretty eager to fight the English team.

“We’ll need a Water or Light Element to be in charge of our defense,” Mo Fan said to the team. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Can I try?” asked Li Kuang.

The four members representing the Chinese team were selected. When everyone was about to step onto the stage, three people showed up at the entrance of the Training Hall. They were all fairly aged...

Bai Dongwei was surprised. He did not expect the advisors to visit the Training Hall. He was totally taken by surprise.

However, his face immediately fell dark as a thought crossed his mind.

The advisors never visited when they were on a winning streak, yet they happened to come when their team was facing off against a strong opponent, the English team. The smile on Bai Dongwei’s face immediately vanished.

It did not matter who their opponent was, it went without saying that the advisors would not be happy seeing the Chinese team lose. If they were not happy, he would surely be scolded as the instructor!

“What kind of luck do I have!?” Bai Dongwei felt like tearing up. He immediately went to receive the advisors.

The advisors were Feng Li, Song He, and the vice-president of the Oriental Pearl Tower. Behind them were a few young Magicians, who were most likely their juniors; two girls and a boy.

Feng Li had thick brows and a thick beard. He was always accompanied by a domineering aura and background music. He looked at Bai Dongwei and uttered a cold harrumph, as if he was not fond of the instructor, and proceeded to the spectator seats.

Bai Dongwei had no choice but to keep the advisors in company.

“Feng Li, it’s Mo Fan,” Song He immediately recognized Mo Fan standing on the stage.

Song He was the dean of Imperial College. He was very familiar with Mo Fan’s achievements.

“Humph, that disrespectful, undisciplined, impolite kid; I can’t wait to see how screwed he’s going to be!” Feng Li pulled a long face. He seemed to have a huge grudge against Mo Fan.

Feng Li and Song He happened to be at the Magic Association. They decided to visit the Training Hall when they learned that the English team had come to challenge them. Even though the advisors were in charge of the national team, the Training Hall was still a part of their responsibilities.

“I was quite surprised that the English team came to Asia so soon. It seems like we are the first country they visited,” said the vice-president.

“Since our Training Hall’s winning rate improved, our ranking improved too. It went without saying that they are more interested in challenging the country with the highest ranking,” Song He smiled..

The Training Hall’s winning rate had skyrocketed since Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue joined the defending team. They had successfully grabbed the attention of other countries.

“Grandpa, can they beat the English team?” asked a young girl with a ponytail in a sweet voice.

“Of course not; even the people on the national team are most likely going to lose tto the English team, let alone them,” replied Feng Li blatantly.

If the national team was considered the main team, the defending team would be considered a substitute team.

Their challenger today was the main team from England. Even the team led by Ai Jiangtu had no chance of winning against them. England was a strong country after all. Its ranking in the World College Tournament in the past had always been a lot higher than China.

“Does that mean the fight is going to be boring to watch?” murmured another young girl whose hair was dyed blonde.

“We aren’t here to enjoy the show. I’m mainly here to watch the English team, to observe their strength,” said Feng Li.

“(cough cough) Feng Li, please don’t say that...” Song He looked embarrassed.

Bai Dongwei’s face flushed after hearing the comments. Those words were too damaging to his dignity!

The representatives from the Chinese team were Mo Fan, Mu Nujiao, Dongfang Lie, and Li Kuang.

As for the English team, it seemed they had decided on their representatives randomly.

Normally, it was rare for the captain of a national team to participate in the challenge. Mo Fan only hoped that the English team did not send out someone too strong. If one of their representatives was as strong as Ai Jiangtu, his team basically had no chance of winning!

“They are all Advanced Magicians,” Mo Fan quickly reminded his teammates, frowning when he saw the four representatives from the English team.

“That’s fine, we can still fight them if they haven’t learned the Advanced Spells yet,” said Li Kuang.

“I have also reached the Advanced Level,” said Mu Nujiao.

“Oh? Not bad, not bad!” Mo Fan raised his brows at Mu Nujiao.

If Mu Nujiao was able to cast the Advanced Spell of the Plant Element, their team would be in a better spot. The Demon Tree Hand was quite a dominating spell!

However, it did not matter much if she still had not learned it. Her control of the Plant Element had still improved significantly regardless. When everyone was still unable to cast Advanced Spells adeptly, the control of their Element mattered the most. After all, it usually took a long time just to cast an Advanced Spell.

Mo Fan was quite surprised to learn that Mu Nujiao had reached the Advanced Level. He had not noticed her cultivation improving suddenly, despite staying in the same house... it seemed the Mu Family had decided to invest in her!

“Cheer up, we won’t necessarily lose the duel!” said Mo Fan after he saw the other three in low spirits.

Li Kuang forced a smile on his face. As a matter of fact, he only volunteered to get some experience from it. How could they possibly have a chance of winning against the English team?!

Dongfang Lie did not say anything. He was prepared to give his best. As for the outcome, he was prepared to face it. It was not like he had never lost before.

Meanwhile, Mu Nujiao was being extremely serious. This was the first battle she would be involved in after she became an Advanced Magician. She would definitely try her best!
