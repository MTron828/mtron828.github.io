Chapter 2917: Mu Rong’s Lie

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Since you’re aware of the innate talent grafting method, this makes things simpler. You will cooperate with Lady Karolina. After she obtains your innate talent, you will have made your contribution in saving the world. Don’t worry. The alliance won’t wipe out your name.” Mu Rong smiled strangely.

Upon seeing Mu Rong’s creepy smile and the arrogant Lady Karolina with her back facing them, Mu Ningxue did not feel the slightest bit of pride or willingness to help them. She felt disgusted.

“I’ve arrived here as per the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance’s recruitment. If there’s nothing else, I believe I can leave now.” Mu Ningxue turned around. There was no need to communicate with Mu Rong anymore.

Mu Ningxue had an odd feeling when she was coming here. She had felt that something was not right from the beginning of the journey. She had been right.

As she walked out of the Ice Cave, Mu Ningxue glared at Wei Guang. Her eyes were filled with disgust. Wei Guang must have known everything.

Before the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance recruited a Mage, they had to communicate with China’s Forbidden Curse Association. They had to first discuss with the members of China’s Forbidden Curse Association and obtain their approval.

Wei Guang was a member of China’s Forbidden Curse Association. He was aware of the truth, yet he hid it from her. He intended to bring her to the valley of death and rob her of her innate talent!

“You can’t leave. You have to obey the magic convention. The Magic Association used their resources to bring you here. The Magic Association requests you to make some sacrifices for the world. What excuse do you have to turn down its offer?!” Mu Rong.

“The magic convention states that the Mages below the level of Forbidden Curse are free agents. We are only required to respond to you upon a special situation. I responded to your call. You have no right to threaten me or make me stay here.” Mu Ningxue knew the magic convention very well.

“It’s up to us to determine if you’ve arrived at the destination or responded to our call! If you leave now, we’ll strike your name off the Magic Association list. From now on, each spell that you cast will be considered a threat!” Mu Rong shouted.

Mu Ningxue walked out. There must have been a few screws loose in Mu Rong’s brain ever since he had been manipulated by the Extreme South Emperor. His words were simply ridiculous.

“Mu Rong, not everyone understands the truth. They only focus on their personal interests and neglect the future. Lucifer bewitched the world and make them stupid, ignorant, and selfish. As a result, God sent angels to the earth and took action. He provoked the war between humans and made them kill each other. Soon, humans understood the true meaning of freedom and peace. They worship God and respect the angels.” Lady Karolina finally turned around. Her eyes were filled with contempt.

“I understand. I’ve said all that I needed to say. I’ve also given my advice. Still, she’s stubborn. She can’t blame us for using coercive means,” Mu Rong said, respectfully.

He glared at Wei Guang and Yvette near the Ice Cave and gave his order. “Arrest her.”

Wei Guang stood in Mu Ningxue’s way. He looked resolute.

“Mu Ningxue, we hope you can cooperate with us. I’m aware of the innate talent grafting spell. It won’t harm you. The alliance has no choice. They must rely on Lady Karolina to cross the Avalanche River. The alliance doesn’t have much time left. Once the polar night falls, the Extreme South Emperor will become more powerful. By then, no one will be able to stop it,” said Wei Guang.

“Who told you all this?” Mu Ningxue refuted.

“Mu Rong, of course!” said Wei Guang.

“Are you aware that he was once the Extreme South Emperor’s puppet? When he was under its manipulation, he collected information about the world’s experts for the Extreme South Emperor,” said Mu Ningxue.

Wei Guang was stunned. He stared at Mu Rong. Wei Guang had never heard of this before.

Mu Rong’s expression changed, as if someone had triggered a switch. The corners of his mouth twitched. “Nonsense! Mu Ningxue, do you know it’s a serious offense if you slander a Forbidden Mage?!”

“You act like a lapdog for Mu Rong, hoping that you can have your little seat in the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance. But you didn’t even know that Mu Rong is a pathetic figure in the alliance where they found him useless yet felt it was a pity to get rid of him. If you continue to curry favor with Mu Rong, the alliance members will regard you as a dangerous man.” Mu Ningxue found Wei Guang’s action to be hilarious.

Wei Guang froze. He stared at Mu Rong for a long time. “Mu Rong, is she telling the truth?”

Mu Rong flew into a fit of rage. He had not expected Mu Ningxue to know about this.

Hua Zhanhong’s plan was secretive. Aside from Mo Fan and his group’s halfway interference, the rest did not know anything about it. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After Mu Rong resumed normalcy, he quickly sought help from the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance to save him from China’s army.

Hua Zhanhong was aware that Mu Rong had broken free of the Extreme South Emperor’s manipulation. The Five Continents Magic Association Alliance pressured him to hand over Mu Rong on account of executing the plan to fight the Extreme South Emperor. It was only then that Hua Zhanhong surrendered Mu Rong to the members of the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance.

Mu Rong’s current state was unclear. He was like a sinner who everyone watched out for. He even had to be cleansed by a Psychic Element Mage daily in order to ensure the Controlling Seed planted inside his head would not sprout again.

Wei Guang had no idea about all this. He thought Mu Rong was an experienced senior within the alliance, and that Mu Rong would allow him to squeeze into the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance. Therefore, he concealed the information during the recruitment and did not inform China’s Forbidden Curse Association about the innate talent grafting issue.

His action was undoubtedly risky. After all, if China’s Forbidden Curse Association found that he had concealed the truth, the association would punish him severely. However, if Wei Guang managed to ride on the Five Continents Magic Association Alliance’s coattails, then the matter was no longer that important.

“Would you rather trust her or me? Wei Guang don’t forget how you got to where you are now…” Mu Rong’s expression looked strange. Even though he was an old mage, he could not keep his emotions in check when they brought up the subject of spiritual puppets.

“Wei Guang, the reason you became a Forbidden Mage is because Commander Hua granted you the Earth Pistil with fire attribute. That is how you reached where you are now. Do you know where the Earth Fire Pistil came from?” Mu Ningxue was resolute.

Confusion flashed in Wei Guang’s eyes. ‘How did Mu Ningxue know that my Forbidden Curse came from the Earth Fire Pistil?’

“Zhao Jing violated the convention and openly called for a private army to attack Fanxue Mountain. He accused us of hiding a great treasure. That great treasure is the Earth Fire Pistil that came from Lan Yang City. We’ve paid a heavy price and sacrificed many lives to save Fanxue Mountain and guard the Earth Fire Pistil. If we had failed, Zhao Jing would have been the Forbidden mage instead of you. We protected the Earth Fire Pistil that made you a Forbidden Mage!” Mu Ningxue sounded harsh.

Each of her words was a blow to Wei Guang. He was already weak, and her words made him feel suffocated.

Lan Yang City, the Earth Fire Pistil, and Zhao Jing…

These words alone were sufficient to prove that Mu Ningxue was aware of the Earth Fire Pistil’s origin!
