“This is nonsense, back to sleep, I’m going back to sleep!” Some of the guests grumbled and proceeded to return to their rooms.

They thought it was something major, yet it turned out the Magicians were only here to arrest some prostitutes. Even the police would not bother to waste their time on petty matters like this. Were these Hunters too bored or something?!

“I was so scared,” Guo Wenyi let out a relieved sigh and patted her chest softly.

“Yeah, I thought they found a huge demon creature. Otherwise, why would they send a thousand Magicians here?”

“HAHAHA, since when did the Golden Battle Hunters become prostitute purgers? The news is going to be interesting tomorrow.”

The crowd slowly left as they went back to minding their own business after the false alarm.

Pan Jin almost went crazy when he heard the comments, especially when they were called prostitutes purgers. He had never experienced anything more humiliating than this. He swore he would kill the bastard that had provided them with false information!

“The owner of this manor is really something, to hide the information of a bunch of prostitutes like they are members of the Black Vatican... the police will never be able to find out their business here,” said a Hunter called Da Tong.

“Da Tong, what are you waiting for? Bring them away now!” Pan Jin was utterly annoyed whenever he saw the women who misled them here. They were all in tears and sobbing pitifully.

“Yeah, yeah, I’ll be going now...” Da Tong did not dare to say further, knowing that his captain was enraged. However, when he was about to ask the others to bring the women away, he suddenly felt something stuck in his throat. He was trying to speak, yet he could not make any sound.

Suddenly, a tearing pain came from his throat. Da Tong coughed fiercely trying to spit out the phlegm, yet he surprisingly coughed out a mouthful of blood!

All the blood was spat on the captain Pan Jin’s face. Pan Jin was already enraged to begin with. He immediately turned mad after someone spat on his face, yet he shockingly discovered that it was all blood!

Blood, black-colored blood!

Da Tong’s throat seemed to be fully blocked by the black blood. He could not speak, and he could not even breathe.

He desperately tried to spit the blood out, mouthful after mouthful.

“What’s going on?”

“Da Tong is vomiting blood!”

“He’s injured, ask Gray Hand to treat him now!”

Da Tong was still vomiting. The blood had accumulated into a puddle. It looked rather eerie.

The Healer called Gray Hand was quite a distance away. When he finally arrived, Da Tong had already collapsed to the ground.

The man had already lost consciousness, yet the black blood continued to spill out from his mouth and his throat. It looked like filthy liquid from some underground sewers. In just a few moments, the ground around Da Tong was covered in black blood!

The Healer Gray Hand cast the Healing Spirit, yet the little healing butterfly circled around Da Tong helplessly, as if it had no idea how to treat the man.

The Healing Spirit was able to detect a person’s injury, but Da Tong did not seem to have any wound!

“It’s poison...or a curse!” Gray Hand frowned.

“Save him quick, if he keeps vomiting blood at this rate...” yelled Pan Jin.

The Healer shook his head, implying that he was totally clueless about it.

The blood continued to pour out. Initially, Da Tong’s body kept twitching as he was vomiting blood, but it had gradually stiffened over time.

A few hundred Hunters were standing nearby, yet there was nothing they could do apart from watching in fear.

Da Tong finally spewed out all his blood. His corpse was dried and black, as if all his blood, body fluid, and fat had been drawn away.

After Da Tong turned into a dried corpse under the crowd’s gaze, it continued to turn dark like burned charcoal. His skin peeled off like gray ashes as the breeze swept past and scattered in the wind.

“This...this...” The Hunters froze.

Without a sign!

A man who was well alive a moment ago had died just like that!

“Da Tong!” Pan Jin yelled. He almost went crazy.

Dead, his brother who had fought alongside him for many years, had died a horrible death from an unknown cause!

“Captain, he might be poisoned. Your face is still stained with his blood, hurry up and wipe it...” The Hunter with a beard came over with a piece of cloth, yet his voice suddenly disappeared before he could finish.

The man with a beard was startled. He tried to say something, yet he could not make any noise.

It felt like his throat was stuck with phlegm. He subconsciously spat it out, yet it turned out to be black-colored blood. He spat it on the ground beside his foot. A small patch of grass immediately wilted when the blood made contact with it.

The man’s face immediately turned pale...

“Big Beard!” Pan Jin immediately realized something.

“Gray Hand, Gray Hand!”

A few other teammates immediately realized Big Beard showing the same symptoms. The Healer called Gray Hand hurriedly made his way over.

Big Beard’s throat was obviously throbbing as the black blood rose within it. The man immediately closed his mouth tight after what happened the first time. However, his throat continued to expand as if it was going to explode in any second!

“Ahhh!”

Finally, Big Beard could not hold it in further. The blood was spat a few meters high up into the air. The Hunters nearby immediately backed away.

Gray Hand quickly inspected Big Beard, yet not only did he fail to find the cause, he immediately felt terrified when he was soaked in the black blood.

The blood was pouring out rapidly. Big Beard fell backward onto the ground. He was exactly the same as Da Tong. His blood had turned black, and it kept pouring out from his mouth...

As he vomited up all the blood, his body began to dry up and darken.

A few minutes later, the rather muscular Big Beard had turned into a skinny, dried corpse, gradually turning into a piece of burned charcoal!

When the first person died, the others assumed that he had carelessly contracted some deadly poison or he had fallen victim to someone’s poison. However, as the second person died the same death, they were immediately stricken with fear...

“Captain, captain, Li Ming is!...” a rookie Hunter came over in a panic to report something.

Captain Pan Jin immediately cleared a path heading toward Li Ming, yet his side glance caught a glimpse of the rookie opening his mouth without being able to say a word.

Pan Jin turned around and saw the rookie spitting out black-colored blood!

Everyone had yet to recover from witnessing Big Beard’s death when the same scene happened once again, and this time, it was happening to a few people simultaneously!

Fear immediately spread among the crowd like a plague. The poison was spreading at a shocking rate. They initially thought an invisible demon was massacring them randomly, yet they quickly realized that there was more than one demon butchering among them, as more people began to vomit black blood!
