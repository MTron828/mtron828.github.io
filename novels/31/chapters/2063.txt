Euryale slammed into the Barrier. She smashed it into pieces quickly, but it also slowed her down significantly, giving Mo Fan enough time to react.

Euryale had different forms. She was lunging like a ferocious eagle just a moment ago, but now she was weaving through the debris like a flexible snake. A terrifying gouge was left on the ground beside Mo Fan. She had almost sliced him in half!

Mo Fan used the Earth Element to relocate himself. Euryale’s attacks were very quick. A snake saber had swept past his ear just a moment ago, and another one immediately came stabbing at his back in the next second!

Their range was around five hundred meters. From Mu Ningxue’s point of view, it looked like a bunch of ferocious sabers were shooting in Mo Fan’s direction. They were pouring down on Mo Fan like arrows, lashing him like whips, and slashing at him like swords at times!

Mo Fan’s Shadow Element, Space Element, and Earth Element allowed him to move around with ease. He was considered a very mobile Mage since he had now reached the Super Level, yet he was still struggling to break free from the assault even as he was constantly switching between his three Elements.

“Breath of Sticky Ice!”

Mu Ningxue drew closer to Mo Fan when she saw the freezing was not effective.

The Breath of Sticky Ice spread across Euryale’s position. The icy mist had strong slowing effects, like a moving creature being caught in a spider’s web. When the ice reached a certain level, anything within its area of effect would be glued to it.

Euryale’s attacks were fiercer now, as if she was trying to vent all her frustrations on Mo Fan. He was now covered in wounds, but fortunately, they were only minor injuries.

“I’ll take her on!” Mu Ningxue shouted after Euryale was caught in the Breath of Sticky Ice.

“Alright, I’ll support you with full firepower!” Mo Fan nodded.

Mo Fan had the same problem as usual: his defense was lacking. He would struggle to unleash his destructive spells when facing a fast enemy who kept attacking him. Every powerful spell required a certain amount of time to channel, but Euryale was so fast that Mo Fan did not have any chance to use his Advanced Spells! His Intermediate Spells were strong, but they were not strong enough to hurt Euryale!

“Perhaps the lineage of the Eagle Demoness is also mixed with the lineage of mad hounds, don’t you agree?” Mo Fan yelled, immediately backing away as Mu Ningxue covered for him.

Euryale shrieked. She had no intention of giving up so easily. She had yet to dig out Mo Fan’s heart!

“It’s a waste to destroy your appearance. I’ll kill him first and slowly skin you!” Euryale screamed at Mu Ningxue.

Euryale did not think of Mu Ningxue as a threat. She ignored Ningxue and kept going after Mo Fan.

“Heaven Spider Nine Locks!”

Mu Ningxue activated the Ice Magic that was hanging above her. The nine ice chains descended from the sky like nine ice dragons.

The ice chains landed on Euryale’s back and grew wildly, like icy thorns. The spikes interwove between the chains and were so densely packed together that even a hamster could not squeeze through the gaps.

The chains were over three hundred meters long. Euryale was pinned down by the Heaven Spider Nine Locks, despite her outstanding speed!

Euryale thrashed about wildly, trying to knock the chains off of her. Her body was pierced and slashed by the thorns when the ice chains broke, more blue blood pouring from her wounds.

“Thousand Leaves Saber!”

Mu Ningxue’s Heaven Spider Nine Locks was basically a trap that she had prepared earlier. Euryale had simply ended up in the trap Ningxue had waiting for her!

Ningxue had been planning to cast the Super Wind Spell in the first place. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Since she had only focused on two Elements, it did not take her a lot of effort to connect the Star Orbits, Star Patterns, and Star Constellations. The twenty-four hundred and one Stars of the Wind Element danced nimbly between her fingers.

A spectacular Wind Palace emerged behind Mu Ningxue, like countless sacred wings setting off the Empress of Wind. The elegant gusts of wind turned into deadly weapons at an order from Mu Ningxue!

The wind sabers spun rapidly, producing piercing howls. Thousands of them dove from the sky and slashed at Euryale mercilessly.

Euryale’s current defense was not as impressive as her initial bloated form. In contrast, Mu Ningxue’s Wind Element was very powerful. It felt like thousands of blades were shredding Euryale, who kept screaming out in agony.

“Slaughtering Wind Slash!”

Mu Ningxue gathered the wind sabers with their deadly auras in front of her. She guided them with her hands and combined them into a giant slashing horizontal tornado.

The Slaughtering Wind Slash had a width of over thirty meters, and its length was even crazier. It felt like the silhouette of a saber had suddenly appeared in the cloudy night sky, extending from one end of the street to the other.

Euryale was was sent flying to the other end of the street by the spell. She was already covered in blood after receiving the Thousand Leaves Sabers, and the Slaughtering Wind Slash tore a huge bloody hole across her chest, revealing her bones.

Mo Fan looked at the seriously injured Euryale and had an urge to take back his words of supporting Mu Ningxue with his full firepower. Mu Ningxue was not necessarily weaker than him in terms of offense!

“She can still shed her skin. My master, don’t be merciful to her!” Bola quickly called out in warning.

“I’ve never been merciful to creatures like her!” Mo Fan snarled back.

Hundreds of Shadow Claws chased after Euryale. They ripped at her back like sharp demonic talons before she could lift herself from the ground.

Euryale decided to leave a layer of skin behind and escape to safety, like a cicada shedding its carapace. She turned into a red snake that had just gone through shedding and fled into the gaps between the debris.

“So the Medusa has now turned into a petty lizard that sneaks into every hole it stumbles into?” Mo Fan mocked her.

Euryale hid in the debris. She was watching Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue closely through the gaps to see if they were using their Super Magic.

Her lungs were about to explode in rage. If she could use her sorcery of the Medusae and the Eagle Demoness, she could take the two Mages out in less than three minutes, but for now she could only rely on her brute strength and speed like an animal!

“I don’t care how many layers of skin you have. I’m going to destroy them all!” Mo Fan said while searching for Euryale.
