Chapter 2730: Mo Fan, The Hardworking Bee

As more and more green star bugs returned, Royal Pattern Wolf’s wound healed faster. Mo Fan was delighted.

“It looks like you have finally inherited the ability of that female wolf king!” Mo Fan exclaimed in disbelief.

The Royal Pattern Wolf nodded.

Unfortunately, there were only plants in the surroundings. There was too little life force that could be sucked from the plants. If there were any demons present, Royal Pattern Wolf would have recovered sooner.

“I don’t think there are any demons in Mingwu Ancient City. I’ll send you back to the summoning beast plane. I remember when I summoned the Copper-horned Yak, its companions were gnawed by a group of Evil Rat Demon. It’s time for you to eat the Evil Rat Demons as nourishment,” Mo Fan said.

Evil Rat Demons lived in groups. They basically had ten thousand creatures in a pack. When they attacked, they moved like a violent tide and wiped out everything on the plains, leaving not even a single blade of grass behind.

When Mo Fan summoned the Copper-horned Yak, he had seen them. The Copper-horned Yak which he had summoned had avoided the Evil Rat Demons by sheer luck. However, the Copper-horned Yak’s other family members had been devoured by the Evil Rat Demons. It was time for the Old Wolf to return and destroy them.

“Howl!” Old Wolf howled. It sounded like it had some of its energy back.

“Don’t worry, I won’t spare that son of b*tch!” Mo Fan was infuriated.

One of his dimensional beasts had died. The other one had barely survived. Although it wasn’t Mo Fan’s fault for not being able to guess that that creature could still attack after its head was smashed, he still felt responsible. He was peeved that it had gotten away!

‘Was that creature truly a sea lion?’ wondered Mo Fan.

“I underestimated a low ruler.” Mo Fan took a deep breath.

Regardless of whether the demons were classified as low ruler, average ruler, great ruler, or supreme ruler class, most of the ruler-level creatures stood out from others. They were very powerful in terms of their strength alone.

......

Some dark, wicked ruler-level creatures had their own means of survival. They always surprised their opponents with unexpected comebacks or attacks unless they were beheaded.

‘A ruler-level demon is already this powerful. I wonder how much more powerful an emperor-level demon might be,’ thought Mo Fan. He recalled a conversation with Commander Hua about the mastermind behind the Monstrous Claw Emperor. Mo Fan was worried about him.

...

The anchor-tailed sea lion had fled. But it was severely wounded. It decided to hide within Mingwu Ancient City since it had lost its head.

The area outside of Mingwu Ancient City was even more dangerous, especially because of the ocean demons that roamed on dry lands. If the wounded anchor-tailed sea lion stepped outside the city, the other creatures would smell it, and the anchor-tailed sea lion would end up being chased and eaten.

It was a severely wounded ruler demon. A ruler was considered valuable to peak commanders, demon hordes, and ocean demons alike. Unless the anchor-tailed sea lion was confident of killing its way to safety from the surrounding predators, it could only hide in Mingwu Ancient City until it healed or at least for the time it took for its head to grow back.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan wondered if an anchor-tailed sea lion was capable of regrowing its head.

...

As Mo Fan walked back through the streets of Mingwu Ancient City, he pondered on the issue of fusion summoning. He had tried the impossible and found out that fusion summoning existed! He might be the first person to ever succeed!

He had learnt that fusion summoning did not just fuse with a particular element to choose a direction of summoning. But both elements had fused and selected a beast of the highest level.

Mo Fan had fused the Summoning element with the Lightning element.

He had reached Super Level second grade bottleneck for his Lightning element cultivation. After he fused his lightning element with his summoning element first grade, his power was determined as Super Level third grade.

Not just anybody could summon Raiju. Only a Super Level third grade mage was able to summon it. Mo Fan had succeeded!

Level of cultivation determined the elf’s ranking in the ancient magic portal. And one’s spiritual realm determined the success rate of summoning.

Luckily, Mo Fan’s dragon sense and his own spiritual realm had enabled him to achieve the eighth realm. Achieving the eighth realm granted Mo Fan a higher success rate in summoning a powerful elemental creature such as Raiju.

‘But I must achieve the Summoning element second grade to open Wan Dragon Valley. Or I can use the loophole…. I can use fusion summoning to summon a higher level of ancient giant dragon.’

Raiju from the Thousand Tribe Elf Tower was not the highest grade. There were many elf kings above Raiju. Raiju was just a powerful guardian keeping the peace of the elf kings. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If Mo Fan’s Lightning, Fire, Earth, and his other elements achieved Super Level peak, he could summon the elf kings!

It was best if his spiritual level could reach the ninth realm by then. The chance of summoning elf kings with an eighth realm was very low. He had to continue upgrading his summoning element if he wanted to open portals to Wan Dragon Valley and Mound of the Dead Beast.

If there came a time where he had to confront people like Zhao Jing and his army, he could summon an ancient ruler-level dragon, or a sphinx, skeletal crannies, mountain peak corpse from Mound of Dead Beast which are all at ruler-level. He could summon all of them and let them fight his enemies to death while he enjoyed steamboats and singsongs.

He felt like he needed to increase his level of cultivation no matter what. He had to work harder. Mo Fan had achieved Super Level on all his eight elements. Mo Fan felt like a hardworking bee buried in a flowerbed working hard to evenly distribute the dews.

He sometimes compared himself to an ox standing on a vast expanse of land and plowing it diligently. The harder he worked, the more bountiful the harvest would be.

Mo Fan was like a vast agricultural land filled with plenty of flowers. Even though he needed to work harder than others, his harvest was more plentiful than the rest.

As he compared himself to many things, he felt that visiting Licheng Afterglow Island had become a matter of utmost importance. Mo Fan felt the need to improve his cultivation regardless of the totem or Lichen Afterglow Island.

...

Mo Fan returned to the place where the ancient statues were expecting to reunite with the young women from Licheng Afterglow Island.

He hadn’t left them alone for long. He supposed that the Golden Sea Hunter group would not return to cause trouble. Besides, the Thundercat and Flute Heron statues were too heavy for them to carry.

When Mo Fan arrived at the grove, there was no one there. He frowned. ‘Where are the ladies?’ he thought as he looked around. He had informed them to wait for him right here. He hadn’t drawn a circle of protection around them thinking the statues would protect them from demons.

He turned to the statues. The Thundercat and Flute Heron statues were nowhere. The ladies had disappeared too. Mo Fan was offended. Those b*stards had stolen the statues and kidnapped the ladies!

“D*mn it!” he cursed. He should have remembered that there were other forces in Mingwu Ancient City besides the demons. Those b*stards had taken advantage of his absence and pilfered the statues and abducted the ladies.
