3094 Divine Judge Silver Eye

Only the people who had achieved the level of the Forbidden Curse were involved in the battle.

Those who had dabbled into the realm of the Forbidden Curse had chosen their sides. However, the magic army below the level of the Forbidden Curse heeded their superior’s orders without hesitation.

It was unlikely that Ramiel would turn his back on the Holy City. He would exhaust every last ounce of power to fight against the intruders.

Likewise, Ye Xinxia would not let the matter rest. The Parthenon Temple Army would sacrifice everything for her.

!!

Michael’s stubbornness to do things his own way would cost the lives of many innocent mages. It was meaningless. In fact, the rulers of the Holy City and Parthenon Temple would go down in history as sinful people.

Since the battle involved the ruling class, they would fight until one side was defeated. The battle would almost certainly result in many casualties, so why allow those who only followed orders to die brutally?

Unless Ramiel thought the Holy Army could defeat the Parthenon Temple Army and win the battle through the power of his army. However, the truth was, Ramiel did not have the confidence to win this battle.

“I agree.” Ramiel nodded.

It was a decision that would have no impact on both side, regardless of who won the battle. However, it would cause great turmoil to the future of the Holy City and the Parthenon Temple.

Ramiel was not a person who deceived others. Since he agreed to the Goddess’ agreement, he took the initiative to show his sincerity.

He gave an order to the Holy Army in “Sky Holy City” to stay in place. The agreement was reached under the crowd’s gazes. Ramiel stopped the army from taking any action.

When they looked down from “Sky Holy City”, they saw the Parthenon Temple Army marching into the city in their most luxurious armor. Ye Xinxia hadn’t lied. The army was huge. On top of that, the mages who joined Parthenon Temple had a high level of cultivation.

The Parthenon Temple Army received the Goddess’ order too. They arrived at a place that was suitable to set up a garrison. The Hall of Knights, Hall of Judgment, Hall of Faith, and Hall of the Goddess gathered in a four-ringed formation. They were stationed about fifteen kilometers away from Holy City. They took half a step forward.

The Parthenon Temple Army would not leave the place because their Goddess was still inside the Holy City.

In the past, Holy City used to do things that even gods were angry with. Even though Ye Xinxia and Ramiel reached a mutual agreement, the Parthenon Temple Army would stay and watch.

If Ramiel broke his word, the Parthenon Temple Army would immediately attack the Holy City.

…

Michael had his own Green Holy Judges Army. They were inside the Vatican Sunflowers Formation. They surrounded the Fallen Angel, Mu Bai.

Mu Bai came with his own backup. When Zhao Manyan saw that Mu Bai had been surrounded, he sneaked into the “Sky Holy City” and entered the Vatican Sunflowers Forest.

The Vatican Sunflowers Forest covered a deserted backstreet neighborhood. The space was stretched to a great extent. Zhao Manyan got lost inside the Vatican Sunflower maze. He could not find Mu Bai.

Squeal!

The Little Moon Moth Phoenix realized something. It squeezed through the blade-like vine branches with its petite body.

Zhao Manyan followed it. He saw many Green Holy Judges gathered to perform a spell. They formed a brown, dense lightning that was aimed in one direction.

“Found him!” Zhao Manyan finally saw Mu Bai.

Mu Bai was in a miserable state. He had broken an arm. His black Fallen Wings were severely injured. The number of wings on each side was unequal. If the brown lightning pierced his chest, he would lose his soul!

“How dare they all bully Mu Bai!” Zhao Manyan flew into a fit of rage. He held the Totem Orb and swung it at the Green Holy Judges army.

The tiny Totem Orb glowed brightly. It was so bright that the Holy Judges and the Divine Judges could barely open their eyes.

A beast that resembled an island suddenly appeared above the Holy Judges. When it landed on them, it was as though a huge mountain had fallen. It instantly collapsed the Vatican Sunflowers Forest and the Green Holy Judges who were about to unleash the brown lightning power!

Bam! Bam! Bam!

The descendant of the Black Totem Turtle suppressed the mages with its terrifying island-like body. It reflected Zhao Manyan’s anger. The Black Totem Turtle sent a few hundred Green Holy Judges flying away with one sweep. They appeared as tiny as a grain of sand before the massive Black Totem Turtle.

The brown lightning was approaching Zhao Manyan from other directions. It was clear that there were many Green Holy Judges who were at the ready. The Black Totem Turtle took a big step forward and arched its indestructible turtle shell.

Mu Bai looked up at the Black Totem Turtle. It looked like the descendant of an enormous mountain and blocked the lightning storm for him. He sighed in relief.

A pile of Green Holy Judges’ corpses was under Mu Bai’s feet. Two of them were the Divine Judges, whose strengths were more powerful than the Holy Shadow.

The Divine Judges were not in the angelic rankings. They were the champions among the Holy Judges. Their cultivation was at the level of the Forbidden Curse. However, they did not join the Forbidden Curse Alliance. Instead, they became Archangel Michael’s private army in Holy City.

The Divine Judges were Mu Bai’s greatest threat. There were at least five of them. Of course, the Green Holy Judges’ formation was not to be underestimated. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Old Zhao, I leave them to you,” said Mu Bai.

“I came to rescue you, and you are running away?” Zhao Manyan said in disdain.

“I know you can handle them.”

“I can’t!”

Mu Bai took advantage of the Black Totem Turtle’s cover and transformed into several hundreds of black-feathered birds. They flew in different directions toward the Vatican Sunflowers Forest.

The Holy Judges began to cast their spell. They attacked the black-feathered birds. They would not allow the Fallen Angel to leave the Vatican Sunflowers Formation.

Inside the dense forest, a pair of large vertical eyes opened. The next moment, the figure of an enormous green python swiftly glided past the area of Vatican Sunflowers. It had not only trampled the Vatican Sunflowers Forest but also had knocked down many Green Holy Judges.

A cloud of poisonous fog spread along the areas where the python glided past. The aggressive Vatican Sunflowers gradually withered under the poisonous fog. The Holy Judges with weaker defenses collapsed one after another.

“Be careful! There’s still one more ancient beast around!” said Divine Judge Silver Eye.

Silver Eye did not show his face. He wore a silver eagle eye patch. He was nameless, just like the other Divine Judges. Silver Eye was his code name. Like the Holy Shadows, they obeyed the archangel’s order without hesitation.

Silver Eye had razor-sharp eyes. He was able to capture the trajectory of movement that others could not see.
