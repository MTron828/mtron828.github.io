Chapter 2755: True Atonement

“It’s Song Feiyao! When did she return?!” Grandpa Queyi and the rest were shocked.

Song Feiyao was the traitor who had left the island. She wore black phoenix garment and was standing on the Green East Sea God’s back. She could clearly see the entire Licheng Afterglow Island below her. The lightning chains which were used to imprison the Green East Sea God kept unraveling and falling. The heavy lightning chains smashed onto the island’s street, and lightning flashed terrifyingly.

After the Green East Sea God broke itself free of these chains, it regained its imposing aura that belonged to the totem beast. It flew in the sky and looked down at the islanders like an ancient holy beast staring down at a weak and small horde. The bone-chilling light in its gaze thunderstruck the islanders.

Mo Fan fixed his gaze at the woman in the black phoenix garment. He found her familiar. She was the woman he had met in the temple.

‘Could this woman be the final elder that had been missing?’ Mo Fan had never expected an elder of the island to be so young and beautiful. She was completely different from the wicked and old elders he had fought till now.

The woman was dressed in all black. Black color usually suggested death, silence, and seriousness. Mo Fan wondered about the meaning behind her attire. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“In this case, black doesn’t represent an elder’s identity. All the ladies on the island, including some ladies in Licheng City inherited the custom of wearing black. However, they usually wear black garments on specific days, such as worship festivals,” Apas explained to Mo Fan. She had learnt about the black garment from Feiyan’s memory.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan had no interest in customs. He was staring at his formidable enemies—The Green East Sea God and the woman in black phoenix garment.

Mo Fan expected these two to avenge Licheng Afterglow Island. When the Green East Sea God flew by, a strong gust of wind blew against him. It then flew toward the lake and away from Licheng Afterglow Island.

Mo Fan was puzzled. ‘So, she wasn’t here to fight me?’

He wondered why they had just flown away even seeing that he had turned the island upside down. As an elder and a very strong one at that who could even command the Green east Sea God, shouldn’t she be fighting to save her home? Mo fan had even thought of fleeing if things got out of hand, but he had not expected her to just… leave.

...

“It’s over! We’re finished! The Green East Sea God left us. Song Feiyao took the Green East Sea God away…” Seventh Granny cried out at her wits’ end.

The rest of them felt the same as the Seventh Granny. The Green East Sea God had been their last hope. But the Green East Sea God had not helped them during the great disaster, instead it left the island with Song Feiyao.

Without the Green East Sea God, Licheng Afterglow Island’s tranquil boundary would weaken by half. Even with the combination of the Thundercat statue and other ancient statues, their powers were inferior to the Green East Sea God. Sooner or later, the Ocean Demons would discover Licheng Afterglow Island and launch a massive attack on the islanders.

Grandpa Queyi and the rest were in a daze, as if their souls had been sucked away. Even if their fury drove them to push Mo Fan out of the island, they could not ensure the island’s safety anymore.

While they had been fighting to save their island, Song Feiyao had taken advantage of the opportunity. She unlocked the chains of atonement on the Green East Sea God. She had achieved her purpose.

“Black phoenix garment suggests atonement of sin. When the islander’s ancestors first triggered the God’s condemnation of the lightning disaster, they shifted all the blame to the Green East Sea God. In order to atone for their sin, they wore black phoenix garments. At that time, many experts from Licheng City came to seek revenge on the Green East Sea God, and it was severely wounded. When they were about to kill it, a woman in black phoenix garment told them that she would find a way to control the Green East Sea God.”

“The ancestors of the island used lightning chains to imprison the Green East Sea God. It inhabited a place somewhere near the island. They assigned a lady from the hidden clan to look after the Green East Sea God every year. Those who were chosen wore black phoenix garment. The islanders hold a traditional atonement festival every year on the day when the lightning disaster happened in order to atone for their sins,” Apas explained.

They held the annual Black Phoenix Garment festival for atonement. While the outsiders had thought they did this to seek God’s forgiveness on behalf of the Green East Sea God, they were, in fact, seeking some comfort for the despicable, greedy, and ugly deeds their ancestors had committed. Moreover, they even attempted to control the Green East Sea God against its will.

The last elder did not share the same mentality as the other islanders. Mo Fan wondered if she had found out about the truth while looking after the Green East Sea God hence deciding to turn against her own people in the end.

There was at least someone with some common sense on Licheng Afterglow Island, after all.

“Both of you are in this together! Both of you have worked together! When did that b*tch hook up with you?!” Eldest Granny charged at Mo Fan and screamed at him.

Mo Fan swung a punch at the old bat without hesitation. She then saw a frightening lava river flowing past her less than half a meter away. Eldest Granny stood there motionlessly.

“I don’t mind fulfilling your death wish, if you’re asking for one. But I find that the punishment is too light if I just kill you here for all the things you have done,” Mo Fan said disdainfully.

“What exactly do you want?!”

Without the Underground Holy Spring and the Green East Sea God, the ideology of the dream island had been crushed to pieces. Licheng Afterglow Island would never be the same again. The islanders had never thought they would usher in an endless darkness at the end of dusk instead of greeting a gorgeous and beautiful sunset.

“I’ll inform the people at the fortress that the actual residents and nobles of Licheng City are those who rather fight with the Ocean Demons instead of migrating to the safest base city. Then I’ll leave them to deal with you. Here’s a friendly reminder for you. Before the people from the fortress come to raise the charge, you’d better take the initiative to return the Mingwu Ancient City’s statues. Tell them the truth about God’s condemnation that happened today and in the past. Return the Green East Sea God where it belongs,” said Mo Fan to the elders.

Mo Fan left with the holy spring essence in his hand. The Green East Sea God was a totem beast. It was an orthodox totem beast that the ancestors of Licheng Afterglow Island had imprisoned for many years in order to take all the blame for their misdeeds. Mo Fan had to find Song Feiyao to end the search for this totem beast.

As for the people of Licheng Afterglow Island, regardless of whether they wanted to continue staying on the island or go to the fortress to atone for their sins, it was entirely up to them. Mo Fan had crushed their ideology. Even though the islanders were safe, their arrogance had been crushed.

Besides, not everyone on the island was aware of the truth. They were shown that their elders weren’t as virtuous and powerful as they had imagined but were greedy and heinous. Could Licheng Afterglow Island still survive?
