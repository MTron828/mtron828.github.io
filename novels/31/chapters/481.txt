The party did not hesitate when they saw Mo Fan being so serious.

If even someone as greedy as Mo Fan had given up so decisively, it was obvious that something terrifying was about to happen.

“Quick, faster!” Mo Fan moved rapidly with his Shadow Spell, urging his crew to quicken their pace.

The group quickly backtracked and traveled down the hill at their fastest speed despite being utterly confused...

“Holy shit, when did the lava get so high?”

A bright red fire carpet rolled in front of the group all of a sudden, as if it were trying to stop the group from retreating.

“Are you dumb or stupid, the lava isn’t flowing down like rivers in the first place; it’s a huge amount of lava pouring down from right above us!” cursed Mo Fan while running.

The lava was only flowing out from the gaps of the walls and in the drains like sprinkles of spring water when they crossed the same section a moment ago, which posed no threat to the group, but it had now spread to the path...

It clearly implied that the lava was pouring down at them, and its speed and amount was increasing. Otherwise, the lava would not simply spill over from the drains.

It would be fine if only a small amount of the lava was leaking out, but if it were able to accumulate such an amount in a short period of time, once it blocked off the sections that were narrower, the lava would start rising up instead...

When the lava eventually filled the path, the group which was stuck halfway in the cave would be burned alive in the lava, with no chance of escaping!

“Holy crap, this place has become a pond!” screamed Zhang Xiaohou.

“A huge amount of lava is pouring down from above...”

“Did anyone hear that noise?”

“Who the hell has time to care about the noise now,” cursed Zhao Manyan.

“No, it’s a different kind of noise.”

As the group was rushing down the hill, they suddenly felt some rumbling from above them. The sound was a certain distance away from them, so it sounded quite faint.

Chen Yi stopped and listened carefully by sticking her ear closer to the wall.

Her face turned pale white instantly. As she turned around, the others could see her eyes filled with terror!

Words were not needed for her to describe what was happening... Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was lava!

The lava was pouring down the path like a flood. The strong current of lava collided with the walls, producing the terrifying sound that Chen Yi heard when she placed her ear on the wall.

Everyone had experienced the structure of the cave themselves. If a wave of lava was indeed surging toward them from above, they would be dead for sure!

Everyone finally realized why Mo Fan had urged them to leave. If they were any slower, they would have died to the lava by now...

However, the group had underestimated the rate of the lava, or maybe they had underestimated the height they had already climbed before it all happened. They had yet to arrive at the bottom after all the running, and many sections already had pools of lava accumulating as they passed by.

Most terrifyingly, the rumbling behind them was becoming clearer. They could feel the passage trembling slightly!

Meanwhile, the eerie metal clank was heard once again. Normally, the group would simply ignore it, but when they discovered the narrow section of the path ahead was blocked off by a creature wrapped in red armor, they immediately cursed in their hearts!

“F**k, what the hell is this thing trying to block us off!” screamed Zhao Manyan.

It was their only way out, and the creature was lying right there. Not only was it blocking their way out, it was also stopping the lava from flowing away, and it was filling up the space!

As the lava could no longer flow down, it began to back up in the other direction. As a result, the area immediately turned into a pool of lava around ten meters across!

It seemed like the fire armor creature was not afraid of the lava. It was simply lying in the corner which was the only way out of the cave, as it slowly revealed two heads wrapped in the same armor...

It had two faces, their beastly features bearing some resemblance to humans. The lava was like a soothing bath for the creature, who was soaked in it while glancing at the group of Magicians with a hint of mockery and gloating!

One of its faces had disdain, and the other a dark expression. The creature was like the Black and White Guards of Impermanence to Mo Fan and his crew!

“This is the end!” screamed Zhang Xiaohou.

The rumbling behind them was getting closer, like the roars of the lava tide...

They initially thought Mo Fan’s quick reaction had saved their lives, yet they did not expect the creature making the eerie noise would add to their misfortunes by blocking their escape.

The lava pool in front of them enlarged gradually, and judging by the armored creature with two faces, it was not something they could kill easily. No one knew what they could possibly do at that instant, they could feel the despair of being trapped inside the death’s jaws!

“Screw it, I’ll smash the shit out of this asshole!” cursed Zhang Xiaohou, about to fight the two-faced armored creature.

“We’ll think about getting our revenge later, follow me!” Lingling said to the group.

“You have a better plan?” asked Mo Fan surprisingly.

“I’m not sure if it works still. I was observing our surroundings carefully when we were running down the cave, and I discovered a spacious hole there. If we hide inside the hole and seal the entrance with the Earth Element, we can temporarily escape from the lava. If the lava ends up filling the entire cave, either we’re going to suffocate in the hole, or the lava flowing into the hole will burn us to death,” said Lingling.

“There’s no better plan now, let’s head to the hole first. Swift Star Wolf, clear the path!” ordered Mo Fan.

“We have to be quick, or else...” said Xinxia.

Xinxia did not finish the sentence, as everyone was clearly aware that if they did not make it to the hole before the lava tide came, they would really be in serious trouble!
