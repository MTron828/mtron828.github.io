“AHHH!!!”

Mo Fan had tossed Tuis on the ground and stepped on his arm.

The step not only had brute force, but the dark flames around Mo Fan had also left a black footprint on Tui’s arm. He could not break free from it, no matter how hard he struggled.

His bone cracked as Mo Fan applied greater force.

Tuis’ arm was soon badly distorted. It looked like someone had installed the arm of a puppet wrongly.

The torture did not stop there.

Mo Fan’s behavior had changed a little, most likely because he had visited the Dark Plane. His temperament was cruel and evil.

After crippling Tuis’ arm, he immediately slammed his fist into Tuis’ kneecaps.

The pain when one’s knees were broken was the worst!

Tuis’ cries spread throughout the Mountain of the God’s Seal. His twisted face was covered in sweat and tears as he was begging for mercy.

“I’ll let you keep one arm. If you dare to trouble her again, I’ll cripple that, too!” Smiling sinisterly, Mo Fan stared at Tuis as he was writhing on the ground.

The Adjudicators, the Knights, and the priests who had come with Tuis were terrified. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

How cruel was this Mo Fan? He had actually crippled Tuis!

He had even used Dark Magic on him!

Unless they found the perfect treatment, Tuis would most likely spend the rest of his life in a sickbed!

They thought Mo Fan was only going to beat him up and teach him a lesson. The people of the Parthenon Temple knew Mo Fan was the only person who dared to hurt Tuis, but they had never expected him to cripple Tuis because of what had happened!

In the end, he had only spared one of Tuis’ arms!

Mo Fan was not going easy on Tuis. He wanted Tuis to be sure that he would turn into a full cripple if he dared to disrespect Asha’ruiya again!

“Take him away. If anyone dares to treat his injuries or relieve him of his pain, I will consider them my enemy!” Asha’ruiya declared.

She had to make sure Tuis remembered the pain.

Asha’ruiya did not think Mo Fan had overdone it. Tuis’ intention to ruin her reputation was far more shameless in comparison!

The incident soon spread throughout the Parthenon Temple. Several elders came and scolded Asha’ruiya for crossing the line.

Asha’ruiya immediately rebuked them. She had already been to the Dark Plane, so why would she be afraid of them?

Asha’ruiya had been too lenient with the people of the Parthenon Temple!

——

The Dark Blessing increased Mo Fan’s strength by fifty percent. In the past, the Blessing of the God’s Seal had multiplied only his Lightning Element’s base damage, but this time, the Dark Blessing had strengthened all his Elements!

Magic Fusion had already given Mo Fan the strength to take on strong Ruler-level creatures. He would soon be the strongest Super Mage with this improvement to his strength.

That being said, his first priority now was to improve his cultivation. Most of his Elements had only reached the first-tier of the Super Level, yet his strength was already so scary. Once he reached the peak of the Super Level for all his Elements, he might be able to challenge the Forbidden Mages.

Mo Fan was overwhelmed by excitement when the thought crossed his mind.

Mo Fan was a diligent man. He did not waste his days doing nothing in the Parthenon Temple. He spent most of the time cultivating on the Mountain of the God’s Seal.

Asha’ruiya also realized strength was everything in this world. She decided to focus on improving her cultivation too, to avoid being harassed by the elders of the Parthenon Temple again.

She had lost the Dark Ice Swordmaster in the Dark Plane, but she had also acquired something she had always desired in return.

Certain rare resources in the Dark Plane were not available in their world. Asha’ruiya might have to visit the Dark Plane several times if she wanted to improve her Sword of Darkness!

——

“My Earth Element has improved a lot. Should I attempt a breakthrough?”

While Mo Fan was cultivating, he noticed the Galaxy of the Earth Element had become restless. He already had four Elements in the Super Level. He clearly knew what that meant.

Since Mo Fan obtained the Heaven Earth Seed, he had spent a lot of time and focus on the Earth Element.

His Earth Element was going to have a breakthrough earlier than the Summoning Element!

It was not necessarily a bad thing. Mo Fan’s rate of cultivation had improved after Little Loach’s evolution. If he just focused on a single Element, there was a great chance he could break through the bottleneck with the energy he had received from Little Loach!

“Little Loach, it’s all you now!”

Mo Fan’s mental strength was already quite impressive. The Little Loach Pendant was also one of the best cultivation tools in existence. He did not have to rely on external resources to achieve the Super Level!

—

Time gradually passed. Ever since Mo Fan went to the Dark Plane, his sense of time was a little off track.

He was initially planning to spend only a few days in the Parthenon Temple to fix the shortcomings of his cultivation, but he ended up staying for a whole month.

Luckily, Mo Fan had already told his close ones about his return. He also told them he would be cultivating in the Parthenon Temple. Otherwise, they might think he was in some kind of danger again.

Mo Fan stretched out and left the Flying Spring Chamber.

It was a pleasant morning. When he walked out, a girl around the age of sixteen bowed to Mo Fan with a shy expression.

“The Saintess has asked me to bring you to her,” the girl said softly.

“Alright, lead the way,” Mo Fan responded quietly.

The girl was amused, and no longer felt so nervous. She happily told Mo Fan a lot of weird things on the way.

“Did Tuis trouble Asha’ruiya again?” Mo Fan asked her.

Asha’ruiya had left the Flying Spring Chamber before he had.

They were obviously using different chambers. Mo Fan was only asking for more trouble if they were to cultivate in the same chamber again!

“I think so.” The girl was not too sure. She added after a moment, “But he was only using some despicable tricks to ruin the Saintess’ reputation.”

Mo Fan realized the girl was well-informed about many things through their conversation.. She must be on Asha’ruiya’s side. He asked playfully, “Does the Saintess really have a lot of lovers?”
