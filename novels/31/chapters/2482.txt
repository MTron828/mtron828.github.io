Chapter 2484: Organizing the Graduates

Pieces of trash, plastic, broken trees, and wood were floating on the river. They eventually built up at a bend in the river.

It seemed there was a leather factory and a chicken farm upstream. Pieces of black leather were scattered on the surface, dirty feathers sticking to them. There were even chickens struggling to get out of the water.

“Dean Fu, are you sure it’s going to show up here?” A few Mages wearing the badges of the Pearl Institute were waiting atop a signal tower on the top of a hill.

They were relatively old, and were obviously not students.

“Look over there!” Dean Fu suddenly pointed at the objects scattered messily atop the river.

The chickens suddenly shrieked and beat their wings even more rapidly, but they were too heavy to fly even on land, let alone when their feathers were soaked in water.

It was hard to tell whether their claws were stuck, or there was something under the water. The chickens were continuously dragged into the water.

A while later, their feathers were spat back to the surface.

“A sea monster that fancies chickens?” exclaimed Wang Fang, one of the Elemental Directors, his eyes wide.

“I poisoned the chickens. The more it ate, the stronger the poison!” Dean Fu replied.

“HAHA, a smart move indeed! I’ll tell the other directors and professors to gather around here!” Wang Fang blurted out in joy.

Mo Fan traveled a dozen kilometers along the river, cleaning up every sea monster he encountered.

Mo Fan had no time to waste on the weaker ones hiding deeper in the water. He was mainly focused on the Commander-level sea monsters.

The Commander-level sea monsters were only average among the sea monsters. The ratio of Commander-level sea monsters here was very high, but only a minority of the human Mages were strong enough to face them.

Mo Fan had no idea if there were Commander-level sea monsters that could move freely on the land. He could only stick to the river and get rid of the sea monsters he bumped into.

“You there, don’t go any further!” shouted a man wearing thick glasses, who seemed to be leading a group of students.

“What’s ahead?” Mo Fan asked promptly.

Most of the students were covered in blood. They were fleeing from a little sandbank to safety, crying and screaming loudly.

“A group of high-level sea monsters. They are…”

“Can anyone save Senior Sister Ding? She’s trapped on the sandbank!”

“What? Didn’t she escape?” The man with glasses turned his head angrily.

He was clenching his fists. Senior Sister Ding must have an important place in his heart judging by his reaction.

However, he soon lost his courage when he thought about the sea monsters.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry…” The man with glasses did not turn around in the end. He remained there weeping tears of remorse.

This group of students was obviously from the main campus. They were close to graduation, meaning that they were Advanced Mages.

However, they seemed terrified of something.

“Stay calm and follow me,” Mo Fan told them.

“Is following you going to keep us alive? You have no idea what’s ahead, you idiot!” the student leader snarled.

He had accumulated a lot of hatred in his heart. Mo Fan did not expect the man to vent all his frustrations on him.

He must have assumed Mo Fan was from the same class as them.

Every Mage at the Advanced Level would graduate from the Pearl Institute with excellence. They were supposed to have a bright future ahead of them, but they had ended up being butchered by the sea monsters instead!

Did the students of the Pearl Institute come to hunt the sea monsters, or be hunted by them?

“Stick together. The faster you split up, the quicker you are going to die!” Mo Fan yelled at the panicking students. He completely ignored the student leader who was having a mental breakdown.

His words were very effective.

Mages were as weak as chicks in front of demon creatures of the same level, but if they could utilize their Elements wisely and stay calm, they had a great chance of killing the demon creatures!

Mo Fan was sure there were no Ruler-level sea monsters ahead. However, Commander-level sea monsters were a great challenge for these students, who had only achieved the Advanced Level recently. He could tell from their reactions that they had lost a lot of people before he arrived.

There were around thirty students, but if they were just a sheet of loose sand, they could not even kill a single Commander-level sea monster. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, if he could convince them to work together, they might be stronger than an incompetent Super Mage!

Mo Fan knew there was no way he could wipe out all the sea monsters by himself. He could never end the war, even if he used up all his energy, without getting these students together.

“Stay behind me. I’ll stop the sea monsters from coming close to you. Just focus on Casting your Advanced Spells. Do you understand?” Mo Fan told them.

“Why…why are you giving orders? I’m the leader!” the student leader shouted anxiously. “You have no idea how scary the sea monsters are! You are just a coward who hides at the back!”

Mo Fan chuckled. He did not argue with the unreliable man.

The water suddenly split apart as a sea monster with a long tail jumped onto the shore.

It had extremely muscular front limbs. They were almost bigger than its body.

The students immediately lost their minds. They had witnessed a talented Light Mage being smashed into mincemeat by this thing when they had first arrived. The guy had died a horrible death before he had a chance to use his magic!

“You asked for it!” Mo Fan shouted. His eyes flickered like sharp silver blades.

A huge echoing rumble went off like thunder. The sea monster went flying like it had just taken a heavy blow. Its body was broken and contorted as it hurtled through the air.

It flew a few hundred meters along the road. Its blood and remains splattered on the ground spectacularly.

Air Cannon!

Mo Fan had learned that trick from Heidi. It was indeed a powerful move! The Commander-level sea monster was not going to rise to its feet again!

The students were fleeing for their lives in fear just a moment ago, like chicks that had seen an eagle diving at them. However, they all froze when they saw Mo Fan take out the sea monster with just a single glance. They even forgot why they were running!
