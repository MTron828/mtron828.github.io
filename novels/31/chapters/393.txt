A black shadow weaved agilely across the field in the valley below. It was none other than Councilman Luo Mian, who had intercepted Wang Xiaojun. He was quite adept with the Shadow Element. Each time he moved, he could leap past several layers of shadows at once.

“Councilman Luo Mian, we’ve been waiting a long time for you.” A rough-looking man stood among the bushes. He was followed by a few men who were the subordinates of a few other Councilmen. Judging from their auras, each of them was an Advanced Magician.

Councilman Luo Mian slowly walked out from the shadows. With his goatee, his smile granted him a friendly appearance. However, little did everyone know, he had just cold-bloodedly murdered a youngster who was close to becoming Hangzhou City’s hero!

“I’ve got the stuff. You should be relieved. As long as you are with me, you will enjoy endless fortune and outstanding power,” said Councilman Luo Mian with a smile.

The rough-looking man and the other Advanced Magicians grinned, too. One of them spoke up, “Allow us to escort you to the quarantine zone.”

“Escort?” Councilman Luo Mian smirked. It seemed like the person who had repeated the same thing had now turned into a soulless shell.

The rough-looking man said, “Zhang Heng, I can assure you that not many people are worthy enough to be Councilman Luo Mian’s escort. He once killed the greatest number of Commander-level demon beasts among the Magicians of the Enforcement Union. His record is kept on a boulder in the Magic Court’s supreme hall. Until today, not one person has managed to break his record with the same cultivation.”

“Alright, we’ll have time for stories later. Don’t forget that Hangzhou City is still in danger. It’s time for I, Councilman Luo Mian, to be the savior. Once it’s done, more people will be willing to give me their allegiance. Until then, no one can ever pose a threat to my position. I’ll soon become a Chairman! HAHAHA!” Luo Mian burst out laughing.

The crowd followed up with fawning words for him.

Surrounded by the crowd, Councilman Luo Mian was about to depart for the quarantine zone, but he had only taken a few steps when a great tornado made up of purple-black air descended from the sky! It rooted deeply into the ground, shredding the grass into smaller pieces. It soon grew into a great hurricane covering the whole valley!

The thick mist within the tornado slowly spread into the surroundings, turning into a wall of mist blocking the group’s path.

Inside the mist, a blurry, flickering black silhouette slowly appeared. It was as massive as a mountain’s spine!

Its body was extremely lengthy, long enough to intertwine with itself inside the mist. It felt like they were countless giant pythons the size of a mountain slithering in the mist. However, as the mist disappeared, everyone discovered that it was only a single Skyscraping Snake, tall enough to touch the clouds!

The Skyscraping Snake stood upright. He slowly lowered his head, like an emperor staring down at the sinful humans on the ground. His eyes emitted a cold flicker, penetrating their hearts like magical swords and rooting them tot he spot.

On top of his head stood the furious Mo Fan and Lingling. They were here to avenge Wang Xiaojun!

Mo Fan glared at Councilman Luo Mian. To his surprise, he had met the person standing beside the Councilman before.

When he went to the shrine at the center of the lake with Tangyue, a person called Da Sheng was on duty looking after the place. The same person was standing beside Councilman Luo Mian now. It clearly implied that he was the traitor in the Totem Guardians Tribe.

Da Sheng was frozen in place. He never thought their totem beast, the Black Totem Snake, would appear here. He did not have the courage to raise his head. He was absolutely terrified, just like Mo Fan’s reaction when he first saw the beast. He was so petty that he had no chance of resisting the beast.

On the other hand, Councilman Luo Mian was a Super Magician. He was able to hold his ground. He raised his head and said with a cold grin, “Do you still think you’re the same totem beast? Without completing the ecdysis, I alone could easily eliminate you!”

The Black Totem Snake suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a puff of black fog. It struck the ground and produced a powerful black ripple.

The energy ripple shattered the ground. The surrounding space trembled violently. Several men siding with Luo Mian were blown into the air.

They were all Advanced Magicians and reacted quickly, casting defensive Spells or protecting themselves with defensive equipment. However, their efforts were all in vain facing the Black Totem Snake’s overwhelming power.

Their defenses shattered into pieces, just like the ground. They floated in the air like grass stalks, as the force tore at them!

A guy with weaker cultivation was suddenly torn apart when he reached a height of fifty meters, his arms, head, and legs amputated. Fresh blood jetted out from the cuts, sprinkling down in the night sky.

The rest did not last any longer, they had all fallen into hell. Apart from having their limbs amputated, some were smashed into minced meat and were spread across the sky.

Four Magicians were killed instantly. They were utterly helpless against a rather normal breath of the Black Totem Snake, and all suffered horrible deaths.

The only person who had stayed alive was the traitor called Da Sheng. He was one of the Totem Tribe, thus he was well aware of the totem beast’s power. He had used all his energy to defend himself right at the start, thus allowing him to cheat death. However, his body was covered in blood. He was already half-dead when he fell from the sky!

Mo Fan could not believe what he had just seen from on top of the Black Totem Snake’s head.

Each of them was an Advanced Magician, and yet the Black Totem Snake had used a single attack to kill them all. How powerful was the totem beast exactly?

The energy slowly dissipated, leaving a mess behind. The cracks on the ground extended far into the distance, as if a gigantic deity had just stomped down, leaving a deep footprint behind. The ground continued to slowly crack open like a canyon.

The only person who was left unharmed in the area was the Super Magician, Councilman Luo Mian. He pulled a long face and snapped at the Black Totem Snake with a glare, “It should take you half a month more to complete the ecdysis... you’re only burning your life force to temporarily grant yourself outstanding strength, are you trying to kill me even if it will cost your own life?!”

Councilman Luo Mian would never believe that the beast had recovered his full strength!Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
