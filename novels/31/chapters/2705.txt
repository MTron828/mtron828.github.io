Chapter 2706: A Seductress in the Temple

Mo Fan had to admit something. He did not have a sense of direction at all!

The coastal landscape had vastly changed in the years because of rising sea levels. It would be difficult to find lost cities in the way he did before.

“Tencent map will continue to navigate for you. The speed limit ahead is 70km/h, and your current speed is 680km/h. You’ve exceeded the speed limit! You’ve exceeded the speed limit!”

The highway into the city had been abandoned for some years now. Mo Fan rode the Royal Pattern Wolf while navigating the map on his phone. The Royal Pattern Wolf sped up, and the notification from his phone repeated its warnings.

“Do not go uphill. Stick to your left and continue moving forward. You’ve exceeded the speed limit! The speed limit for this highway is 70km/h.”

Mo Fan looked up and saw the road ahead of him sinking into the sea. He then looked at the map on his phone again.

‘Sigh, smart technology is not really reliably smart. It’s best to just rely on myself,’ decided Mo Fan.

“Old Wolf, you go back first. I believe it should be somewhere here. I’ll fly to the sky and take a look.” Mo Fan called the Royal Pattern Wolf back to a different dimension.

The Royal Pattern Wolf howled, looking majestic.

“You want to walk around and take back some fresh to the horde?” said Mo Fan. “Suit yourself. I will go to the fortress over there for now.”

The Royal Pattern Wolf spread its limbs as if it had finally regained its freedom before running toward the barren coastal plain. Mo Fan wondered what it had smelled that had gotten it so excited. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Mo Fan had achieved a decent level of Summoning Element cultivation. So, the Royal Pattern Wolf could take its own sweet time for now. After all, there were not many people staying in the city. It had basically become a hotspot for the Ocean Demons and other demon hordes. The Royal Pattern Wolf could roam around and help the remaining citizens get rid of some of the demons.

Mo Fan switched off his phone. He summoned his Black Dragon Wings and flew to the sky.

Ocean Demons liked to cast fog spells to obscure human vision. Sometimes, it would be so foggy that anyone flying into the sky would lose track of the intended destination. But this time, when Mo Fan flew up into the sky to conduct his investigation, it was clear. The weather was good.

When he flew higher, he saw purple ripples in the sky. The purple aurora folded, twisted and spiraled continuously. It was breathtaking.

Boom! Boom!

There was a distant lightning strike. The weather did improve but the lightning grew even louder as though a team of soldiers from heaven had gathered on a cloud and played the lightning drums.

Dots of lightning flashed in purple. It looked like a purple crack across the sky. More snake-like electric cracks spread over the clear sky. Powerful lightning boomed, illuminating the earth and the sky entirely in purple. Mo Fan now stood on a vast coastal plain, watching the dirt and mud splattered all over the land and the plants and trees simply destroyed.

Bam! Suddenly a lightning bolt appeared in the sky and hit the dirt on the flat highway. The sparks were astonishing. The bolt struck in Mo Fan’s direction. He crossed his fists and took up a defensive stance. The moment the lightning hit him, it sent him flying a hundred miles away. The impact was just too powerful.

Mo Fan’s clothes were in tatters. His hair was singed. When he looked down at his arm, he could see a fresh wound open up. Mo Fan was truly at a loss for words. He was stunned.

He was amazed that these lightning bolts were powerful enough to cause him damage. He could see that there were thousands of lightning bolts snaking down from the sky, each equally, if not more powerful, than the lightning bolt which had struck him.

The sky was clear and yet lightning struck. It was an incredible sight. For a while, Mo Fan felt as though he had fallen into another ethereal and surreal world.

But the scene did not last long. The lightning disappeared from the sky before Mo Fan had the time to find the source of this heavenly electrifying phenomenon.

The sky began to turn dark. The ground was in shambles. The surrounding area had grown extremely quiet.

“It’s incredible!” Mo Fan used his senses to scan his surroundings. The Lightning Element in the surrounding had already begun to thin out as though that one powerful incident had exhausted all resources.

He continued to travel some distance away.That phenomenon did not occur again. The Lightning Element resumed its normalcy. But the air was filled with burnt smell and the aroma of meat. Perhaps some living creatures nearby were struck and burnt.

Mo Fan took out a Great Return Pill from the divine temple. He generously applied the medicine to his wound. He recovered fast, thanks to his demonically powerful physique and to the miracle pill. His wounds had completely healed within half an hour.

‘Why is there a temple in the middle of this wilderness?’ wondered Mo Fan. He had passed an overgrown forest and come across a sacrificial temple. It was deserted. There was nothing else except overgrown thorns and bushes. No sign of any houses, or buildings.

‘I think I smell a person.’ Mo Fan walked over to where the smell came from. He was glad that he had finally found somebody in this abandoned place, outside the fortress and the city. Finally, someone who could give him directions.

...

“Who’s there?” came a nervous female voice from within the temple. Her voice sounded cold.

Mo Fan was puzzled. He wondered why a lady was alone in this dilapidated temple in the middle of this vast wilderness. He thought that she might be a fox or a snake hiding in the temple to entice a passing man.

Mo Fan felt a little excited. He strode inside the temple. “Fairy Sister, I was just passing by and saw this temple. I have suffered a minor injury from the lightning. Could I stay inside this temple to avoid another lightning strike?” asked Mo Fan courteously.

“Fairy Sister? What even is that? I am here to worship my ancestors.” The woman was draped in a colorful headscarf. He wore a delicate conical hat. She was in a slanted-waist blouse and wide-legged pants.

Her attire was unique to say the least. Her headscarf covered her cheeks, revealing only thin, curved eyebrows and a pair of beautiful eyes. Her nose and lips looked delicate. He was stunningly beautiful.

From her attire, she looked reserved and introverted. Despite being mostly covered, her demure beauty stood out.

Mo Fan was a practical man. There was this common saying that a demon would be present whenever something unusual happens in a place. Otherwise, there was no reason for a temple to appear in this kind of wilderness. Why was it that it was always a woman who appeared in this kind of situation? The lightning was so powerful, every demon within the vicinity was fried by it, so how was it that someone who looked demure and meek like her was still alive in this temple?

‘She must be a seductress intending to find her next victim,’ thought Mo Fan. ‘And I happened to bump into her!’
