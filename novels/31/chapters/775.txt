The location of the national embassy in Osaka was quite interesting. It was on top of a place called Huwang Mountain around eight kilometers away from the shoreline.

{TL Note: Huwang Mountain is a fictional place. Huwang in Chinese means staring at one another.}

Huwang Mountain was actually made of two mountains that had remarkably similar steep and jagged slopes. The roads up the mountain consisted of rapid turns, lots of them were a hundred and eighty degrees turns.

The national embassy was located at the top of the mountain. It was called the Twin Guardian Towers. From afar, they looked like two ash-gray castles at the top of the mountain, with a pathway hanging loosely between the twin towers. The roads only led to one of the towers, thus the pathway was the only way to the second tower.

The Twin Guardian Towers were quite well known both locally and internationally. Mo Fan and his team never thought the national embassy was located here. It gave them the chance to witness Japan’s remarkable architecture.

“The Twin Guardian Towers are like observatories. Looking to the south, you’ll see the entire maritime battlefield here in Osaka. It’s the reason why many generals live here too... what a surprise, Japan’s national embassy is quite impressive!” exclaimed Jiang Yu. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The team soon arrived at the West Guardian Tower. The building’s architecture was indeed spectacular, but in Mo Fan’s eyes, the castle with pointy eaves and roof tiles was basically a combination of the eastern and western styles. He did not find it special.

They approached the walls made of stone. Two Japanese Magicians clothed like samurai were guarding the entrance. Their gaze sharpened when they saw the group of young adults, acting as if they had entered a prohibited area.

“Hey, you guys are from China, right?” asked a young woman dressed in a kimono, an umbrella in her hand. She sounded like she was interrogating them.

She was speaking in English, thus everyone could understand her.

The woman in kimono trotted up to them. Normally, a kimono would easily highlight the friendliness and gentleness of a Japanese woman, but the one standing in front of them was far from friendly. She closed the umbrella and stuck it in the ground while pointing her other hand at them.

“How did you know we are from China?” Mo Fan was slightly confused, as Chinese and Japanese pretty much looked alike. The woman did not hear them converse in Chinese either, why was she confident that they were Chinese? Couldn’t they be Koreans?

“Visitors from China never obey the rules. Didn’t you see the warning at the bottom of the mountain saying no visitors were allowed? Can’t you read!” The woman in kimono turned sideways and straightened her figure. Her tall wooden clogs made her look relatively tall. The gaze directed at Mo Fan and his team was filled with pride and disdain.

“Miss, we aren’t visitors,” said Mo Fan.

“This place doesn’t welcome Chinese who want to work here to get their visas either, leave now. Otherwise, I wouldn’t mind tossing you down myself!” the woman declared arrogantly.

Mo Fan was annoyed when he heard the biased remark from the woman.

The faces of Ai Jiangtu, Gong Yu, Zhou Xu, Zhao Manyan, Zu Jiming, and the others darkened, too. Everyone in the team was a talented candidate specifically chosen from their respective institutes in China. If there was anything, each of them would have their own pride among people of the same age group.

Not only did this Japanese woman who appeared out of nowhere look down on them, she had grudge against Chinese people, too. She was acting like Japan was a sacred place, and people of their country liked to stick up to their ass!

“Calm down, everyone calm down, let me talk to her nicely,” advised Mo Fan when he saw the others about to lose their temper.

The woman in kimono was furious when she saw they not leaving. She pointed at them and snapped, “The Twin Guardian Towers is a sacred place in Osaka. Please don’t bring your filthy air here, leave at once.”

“You dumb bitch, who the hell did you just call filthy? I swear I’ll f**king tear your dumbass towers down now! Show some f**king respect!” Mo Fan pointed at the woman and cursed.

The others looked at Mo Fan with blank faces. Didn’t he ask them to calm down just a second ago? He was scolding so fiercely now. Wasn’t the scene changing a bit too quick?

“What did you just say? I dare you to repeat it!” The woman’s chest heaved with anger.

“You dumb bitch!” cursed Mo Fan.

The woman in kimono threw her umbrella aside and said coldly, “Not that one!”

“Show some respect!” said Mo Fan.

“Not that one either,” the woman slowly reached her hand over to the back of her neck to tie her hair up.

When her hair was still down, it was hard to see her face. However, as she tied her hair up, she revealed her attractive face. She was definitely a gorgeous beauty. Her silver earrings perfectly set off her smooth skin!

“I’ll tear your dumbass towers down!” Mo Fan was never scared of anything. Since the arrogant woman wanted to hear it again, he would not mind repeating it.

Who asked her to act all tough and disrespectful, acting like the Japanese dynasty was looking down at some Chinese thug? They were asked to come here to challenge the national embassy, yet the woman had taken the initiative to humiliate them before they had the chance to kick down the door of their national embassy!

“Humph!” The woman in kimono had finished tying her hair up. She added with an unfriendly tone, “You’re going to regret it!”

The temperature of the air dropped all of a sudden. The shiny marble path under the woman’s feet began to crawl with strange vines.

More vines began to appear and intertwine into buds over a meter wide. The buds blossomed like Chinese bellflowers and scattered under the woman, lifting her off the ground!

The number of buds formed with the vines increased rapidly. With a groan, the plants grew even faster and covered the whole soccer field-sized area in front of the West Guardian Tower!

“Chihaya, stop it!” a hoarse voice came from the West Guardian Tower.

The woman in kimono was so furious that she had turned icy. From her personality, it was obvious that she was the kind that would not care about the consequences. However, when the voice repeated itself, demanding that she stop, her Empress of the Forest aura quickly dissipated.

The plants covering the ground wilted away quickly. They soon turned into gray dust scattered across the place.

The intense atmosphere returned to calm. The woman was panting heavily. Her large breasts were heaving with her heavy breathing. Her alluring collar bones were rising up and down in the gap of her kimono, too...
