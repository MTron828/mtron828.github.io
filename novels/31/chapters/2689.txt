Chapter 2691: The Five Elders Perish in Fire

As the fire whooshed from the sky, the trio of masters were almost crushed by Mo Fan’s Twilight Fire Line. Colorful sparks flew everywhere. Master Bai Song and others were consumed by a vortex formed by layers upon layers of flames. Their souls were devoured by the ferocious twilight flame!

It was visible to everyone on Fanxue Mountain, including Fan Xuexin City. The twilight sky collapsed, spreading blazing flames everywhere. Heaven and Earth were set on fire entirely until everything was devoid of the sign of life.

The magical defenses of the three masters slowly turned from illuminating luster to something pale and grayish. They held each other tightly as they reached their limit of withstanding the destructive power. They passed out from the force and collapsed on the ground.

Master Bai Song looked like black charcoal. Among the trio who had collapsed, Master Bai Song was the first to gain consciousness. When he opened his eyes, he was greeted by the sight of blood twilight. He assumed that Mo Fan had not finished using his Twilight Fire Line. Master Bai Song gathered his last bit of energy to cast a protective spell on himself to avoid getting reduced to ashes.

Much later, when he awoke again, he found himself staring up at Mo Fan. He looked mad. Mo Fan directed a radiant smile at Master Bai Song. His face was still ablaze. His eyes were as sharp as a demon’s.

“You are a heretic! A heretic!” shouted Master Bai Song. As he cried out, a part of his face flaked off revealing something skinless underneath.

“I am powerful, so by your logic I MUST be a heretic, huh?” Mo Fan let out a laugh. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Master Bai Song had always assumed that those with a supreme level of cultivation had cultivated demonic and evil magic that was harmful to others. He branded everyone powerful than him as a heretic and a troublemaker.

Master Bai Song was truly ignorant. Those with Demon Element magical powers would have been arrested by the Heresy Judgment Court long ago. Mo Fan possessed orthodox magical power. Unfortunately, the stubborn elderly mages refused to acknowledge it and accused him of being a heretic.

“You call yourself the elders of our society and yet you abuse your power for your own personal gain. You refuse to acknowledge right and wrong and instead use your powers to rob the poor.” Mo Fan walked towards Master Bai Song. His eyes were full of anger.

“What are you doing? Are you going to kill me? It’s just a family dispute. I’m the head of the Ice Element Association, General of the Southern Area, and one of the most respectable guests of the Zhao family!” Master Bai Song blurted out his titles in a single breath.

“Do you know Su Lu?” Mo Fan asked.

“Chairman of Asia?” Master Bai Song looked puzzled. ‘Could this be Su Lu’s relative? But Su Lu was dead!” Master Bai Song reasoned.

“Who the hell do you think you are when I have slaughtered the Chairman of Asia himself?” thundered Mo Fan. He stamped his foot on the ground. Thirty-six volcanoes erupted simultaneously and an enormous Flame Dragon flew into the sky.

The Flame Dragon formed a majestic Flame Palace. Master Bai Song, Master Lan Zhu, and Master Qing Lan appeared as small as volcanic ash as they burned inside the Flame Palace.

The trio lacked the strength to fight back. They screamed in agony. Their voices even reached Fanxue Mountain, reminding everyone of the consequences of fighting against Fanxue Mountain. Mo Fan deliberately slowed down the fire of the Flame Palace so that everyone could witness the majestic and splendid Flame Palace devouring the three masters of the Zhao family.

“You’ll be meeting him soon!”

Mo Fan’s flaming supernatural power was so crushing that it was several levels stronger than Super Level Pinnacle Magic. Everyone panicked when they witnessed the state of the three masters.

The Flame Palace did not disappear. It burned in the middle of the Fruit Mountain. Without the restraint of the Thorn Ice Ring, the Flame Demon King was unstoppable.

Soon, Mo Fan also caught Elder Shou and Elder Pang of the Nanrong family. He crippled them.

“Think of this as your grand funeral!” Mo Fan said coldly to Elder Shou and Elder Pang.

“Don’t kill us! Please don’t kill us! It’s just a family dispute. The winner gets everything. You don’t have to drive us to death. We will compensate you. We will even sign treaties to ensure Fanxue Mountain becomes the first greatest force in Flying Bird Base City. Please spare us!” Elder Pang cried bitterly.

The broken and wounded Elder Pang was nothing like his previous arrogant self. Mo Fan wondered if this was the same Elder Pang. Only when he saw the flame scar on Elder Pang’s chest did he realize that this was the same person.

“You’re fighting against everyone. If you kill us now, Fanxue Mountain and its people will die!” Elder Shou yelled desperately. He looked so pitiful like a stray dog scorched by boiling water. He was a wreck, but still fierce.

Regardless, Mo Fan decided to kill them all. He could not take their words seriously.

“I will definitely pay a visit to the Nanrong family in the near future. The decision to exterminate the family will entirely depend on the Chief of the family.” Mo Fan did not waste any more time and tossed Elder Shou into the fiery depths of the Flame Palace. He was reduced to ashes.

“Spare me! Spare me, please! I have been greedy. But I can certainly be of use to you. Please, I beg you. I do not want to die. We only came here as guests. We did not even mean to join the fight and turn this into a bloodbath. Please....” Elder pang begged at Mo Fan’s feet.

“Look at your hideous appearance. What’s the point of staying alive?” Mo Fan threw Elder Pang, who looked like a roasted pig, into the Flame Palace.

As Elder pang died, he was full of regret. He lamented the day when he heeded Nanrong Ni’s words. Why had he come to Fanxue Mountain at all? Why did he have to face this demon?

Mo Fan was true to his words. He had said that he would spare no one and he remained by his vow. He knew that the elders had launched this attack on Fanxue Mountain with the intention of sparing nobody if they had won.

There were over a thousand members in Fanxue Mountain who stayed on to fight the battle. Mo Fan witnessed many of them die a tragic death in the middle of the chaos. Elder Pang and his group had never shown any mercy to them in the first place.

“All hail Flame Demon King!”

“All hail Flame Demon King!”

Nothing was more remarkable than the fact that the five Super Level masters and elders had been defeated. The crowd cheered. Victory was theirs. Almost.

“I never expected this....” Uncle Carpenter was astonished.

His strength was so great that it was comparable to the five elders who had died. He had reached the third level for two elements. He had thought that he could hold the opponents back by himself until reinforcement for Fanxue Mountain arrived.

He now saw that the true leader of Fanxue Mountain was a demon-like mage capable of defeating five Super Level experts all by himself. With that, his heart soared because he felt confident that Fanxue Mountain will prosper in the future.
