“I’m only telling you it’s a possibility. Whether it’s true or not, you will have to find it out yourself,” the Queen of the Netherworld reminded him.

The Queen of the Netherworld swallowed the rest of the words she was going to say when she saw the disappointed look on Mo Fan’s face.

The Queen of the Netherworld knew a lot of things, especially since she was able to see through everything after she died and became a phantom.

Being alive was like living in a dream, or living to make a dream a reality. The Queen of the Netherworld realized she had told Mo Fan a lot of things that she was not supposed to. He should see and figure out the truth about the world himself, rather than hearing it from others.

Whether it was corrupted or beautiful, there might be things that he liked or despised. The most important thing was how he perceived it.

The world that Qin Yu’er perceived was ugly and merciless... She had nowhere she could go, even when she was hiding in the rift on Tianshan Mountain. However, was her soul corrupted because of it?

The Queen of the Netherworld believed Mo Fan had to perceive the world himself. He might have seen some evil, but it was obviously not enough!

Mo Fan left the shrine. The Queen of the Netherworld quickly followed him.

“Why are you following me?” Mo Fan was confused.

“The king gave me a mission, so I have to follow you,” the Queen of the Netherworld replied.

“What is it?” Mo Fan asked.

“It doesn’t hurt telling you. He asked me to keep an eye on you. It’s his business. You did well when you tried to help on Tianshan Mountain. He will handle the rest. He doesn’t want you to oppose the Heresy Judgment Court, at least not right now,” the Queen of the Netherworld informed him.

“Is it because I’m too weak?” Mo Fan said.

“You are strong, but certain things will need time to settle,” the Queen of the Netherworld stated.

Mo Fan could only smile wryly.

“It feels terrible, right?” the Queen of the Netherworld asked in a gentler voice.

Leaving in humiliation felt terrible. Mo Fan had already experienced it once on Mount Tyrant, and now he had to experience it again here!

“There’s something fishy around here if I feel good about it... oh, no offense,” Mo Fan answered.

“Should I find a way to see if someone is really pulling the strings behind the scenes in your country? The king has asked me to keep an eye on you so you don’t mess with the Heresy Judgment Court, but you can help the king deal with the scum in your country,” the Queen of the Netherworld suggested.

“Sure,” Mo Fan agreed.

Mo Fan was angry toward the people of his country who were responsible for this than the Heresy Judgment Court and Khufu. They had survived the calamity of the Ancient Capital and the crisis at Beijiang. Mo Fan had witnessed many who had sacrificed their lives to protect the country, yet not only did everyone forget their names, some authorities even tried to disrupt the peace for their own gains...

Those people were unforgivable!

The Queen of the Netherworld let out a relieved sigh when Mo Fan agreed not to go to the Sacred City. “Go back to Fanxue Mountain. Give me some time, I’ll need to gather information and proof from my subordinates.”

“There really are people behind it in our country?” Mo Fan asked again.

“Ugh... yes!” the Queen of the Netherworld finally nodded.

“They deserve to die!”

The Asia Magic Association at Dubai Magician Tower...

Shao Zheng pushed the door open and barged into the meeting room beyond it.

“Zu Huanyao, why didn’t you tell me that the Heresy Judgment Court came to our country!?” Shao Zheng was extremely mad. He pointed at Zu Huanyoa and scolded him regardless of the people inside the room.

There were authorities from different countries in the meeting room, who seemed to be in the middle of a discussion. They were shocked when Shao Zheng broke into the room. They had no idea why the Councilman of the Asia Continent was so angry.

“Everyone, pardon us. It seems like there were some misunderstandings between me and my young colleague. We’ll stop the meeting here,” Zu Huanyao calmly dismissed the people in the room.

Shao Zheng stood at the door. He did not bother greeting the other Councilmen when they walked past him. His eyes were fixed on Zu Huanyao.

Shao Zheng was mainly in charge of the internal affairs, while the older Zu Huanyao with a black mustache was in charge of international affairs. He was close with Su Lu in the Asia Magic Association. If Zu Huanyao had not been against Shao Zheng’s proposal, they would have started preparing the defense along the coastline half a year sooner!

“Can’t we sit down and talk about it? You are just making us a joke in front of our foreign friends. They might think everyone in our country has a hot temper like you,” Zu Huanyao offered.

“Enough with the act. The Heresy Judgment Court used Forbidden Spells on Tianshan Mountain and took away someone important to our country. Have you ever thought of the consequences? You can discuss it with me if you want to appoint your men as presidents of local Magic Associations, but what you did has seriously crossed the line!” Shao Zheng snarled.

“Oh Shao Zheng, you’d rather believe the vicious undead who killed so many of our people at the Ancient Capital instead of my loyal men. How could you rely on those things to protect our country? You can disclose your plan to the public. If everyone supports you and that kid’s plan of fighting a war in the Underworld, I’m more than willing to risk my life just to save the woman from the Heresy Judgment Court,” Zu Huanyao countered.

“How many times have I told you that the ocean is our greatest threat? We can keep the undead at bay for now. Why must you take away our only chance to catch our breath!?” Shao Zheng snarled back.

“You are too scared of the ocean. If I was handling it, the coastline will still be a beautiful place where we can build expensive houses... fine, you shouldn’t vent your anger at me. I wasn’t the one dealing with the Heresy Judgment Court. We have been colleagues for many years, you know the kind of person I am,” Zu Huanyao replied.

“Get her back!” Shao Zheng stated. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Shao Zheng, didn’t you say the same thing to me a dozen years ago? I remember you were still a little minister back then. The girl was still on the national team...” Zu Huanyao went on.

Shao Zheng was stunned.

“It has been over a dozen years. I’m still sitting in the same seat, yet you have already climbed to the same height as me. However, I think you understand that, even if you are the boss here, do you think the Heresy Judgment Court will agree to hand her back?” Zu Huanyao asked.

Shao Zheng fell silent.

“I asked him to change his surname and move to the south just so he could stay away from the Heresy Judgment Court, so why didn’t anyone tell me the resurrected Qin Emperor had taken my grandson’s life? I just want him to be well and alive instead of being trapped inside the shell of a ghost who has been around for a few thousand years!” Zu Huanyao declared.
