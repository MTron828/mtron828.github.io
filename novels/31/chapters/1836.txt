Thick blood was continuously pouring out of the creature’s body. A great chill was slowly infiltrating its body as it gradually sank to the seabed. Mo Fan felt terrible, like his heart was being filled with the disgusting seawater.

In the end, he did win the battle. The Battle Emperor knew its action was going to tear apart its organs and bones, yet it did not hesitate in the slightest. It did not necessarily hold a strong grudge against the human who came to provoke it, but it did against the chain which had tied it down and prevented it from soaring freely in the vast sky and the sea. The chain was like the string of a kite or a fishing rod. It was a cage limiting it to a world of only four hundred meters radius!

Mo Fan began to regret his decision to manipulate gravity with his spells. It gave the Bird Emperor the chance to break free from the chain, at the cost of its own life. This fall to the seabed was most likely the final moment of its life.

Mo Fan felt extremely terrible after seeing the blood squirting all over the place. He was not a Healer. There was nothing he could do to stop the Bird Emperor’s life from draining away. He could only fall to the seabed together with the Bird Emperor. He could already see the seabed, despite the darkness around him.

The seabed was supposed to be covered in sand or irregular rocks, yet what Mo Fan saw was more like... the remains of a kingdom of oceanic creatures!

Mo Fan’s vision was limited due to the darkness. If he had not noticed something that resembled the skeleton of a creature below him, he would simply have assumed the bottom consisted of weird-looking rocks. However, when he got closer to the seabed, he realized the remains were actually the insides of an enormous creature lying at the bottom of the sea. Its bones were enough to form a seabed, while its spine was the sea stack that was supporting the whole island!

The spine below the island was covered in moss, so Mo Fan had first assumed it was a sea stack instead. However, his thoughts were all over the place after he realized the truth.

What exactly was the creature? How the hell was it so big? It felt like it had come a time when the world was still beyond anyone’s understanding.

The Bird Emperor’s dolphin-esque cry was a lot gentler and weaker now. Mo Fan only recovered from his astonishment after hearing the Bird Emperor’s cry.

“Use these, I’m not sure if it will keep you alive, but it’s better than nothing,” Mo Fan quickly took out the sacred medicine which Xinxia had prepared for him. He poured them all into the Bird Emperor’s mouth regardless of their effects, including those that were meant for external uses.

The Bird Emperor’s cold eyes were fixed on Mo Fan. They no longer had its hostility, nor did it have any intention to fight him. Instead, there was a hint of gratitude in its eyes.

The battle had allowed it to break free from the chain. It had finally reached somewhere beyond the reach of the chain for once after twenty years. It could lie still among the bones of the Ocean Father. It had never felt so at peace.

“You were never a Contracted Beast, right?

“You have always been trapped on the island to be used as a test subject for their experiments. This is where you were born... so you want to sleep here forever?”

Mo Fan could not understand demon creatures, but those in the Ruler-level were intelligent to a certain degree. They could easily relay their thoughts through the looks in their eyes or their emotions.

Chen Shuo had indeed been lying to them. That son of a b**ch was most likely one of the people who were in charge of the inhumane experiment. He had still not given up on his wild ambitions after so long!

“Stop talking and hold your breath. I’ll bring you up top and ask Mu Bai to freeze you. I’ll find a way to heal you, too,” Mo Fan told the Bird Emperor. “Oh, my bad, you weren’t even talking... Anyway, don’t give up on yourself so easily. The world is so big, there are still a lot of places you should check out on. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Oh, don’t you worry, I’m not Yang Yongxin. I’m not trying to brainwash you with the Psychic Element or anything, nor am I going to ask you to be my Contracted Beast. I’m a huge fan of democracy and freedom. Once I treat you, you can go wherever you want as long as you don’t gather your army of Manta Ray Evil Birds and attack us humans. If you don’t believe me, you can ask my Little Flame Belle and Apas. I’ve never forced them to do anything. They are willing to follow me around...” Mo Fan panicked even more as he thought the Bird Emperor was going to die soon. He quickly decided to motivate it.

However, a protesting voice sounded from the second Contracted Beast. Apas strongly disagreed with Mo Fan’s statement by uttering, “Bullshit!”

However, Apas was quite a distance away, so the protesting voice was pretty poor. Mo Fan could not hear her at all. He continued to comfort the Bird Emperor by guaranteeing that it would soon return to the blue sky and sea healthily...

Mo Fan kept feeding the Bird Emperor medicine. As a matter of fact, Mo Fan wished he had the ability to summon someone globally. He would just summon Xinxia to him to save the Bird Emperor, but he did not have such an ability. He could only rely on the medicine.

The medicines were strong, but their effects were too slow. The hourglass representing the creature’s life only had a thin layer of sand left...

Mo Fan heard noises in the surroundings. He looked around and saw sapphire light dots showing up in the darkness. They were approaching in huge numbers. Huge outlines of jagged wings soon appeared from the shadows.

“Look, your people have already woken up. They care so much about you, so you must keep on living for their sake...” Mo Fan began, but shuddered when he sensed strong murderous intent surging in his direction.

The Bird Emperor’s feeble eyes glittered as it forced itself to gather its strength and stared at the Manta Ray Evil Birds cautiously.

Mo Fan was stunned.

He thought the army of Manta Ray Evil Birds had come to grieve at their emperor’s death, yet there was not the slightest hint of sorrow among them. The creatures were staring at them greedily, as if they had been waiting so long for this day.

Their greed was not directed at the human Mo Fan, but the Bird Emperor instead!

“Scum, you bunch of scum!” Mo Fan was enraged.

The Bird Emperor was already dying, yet these creatures were already planning to feast on it. The Bird Emperor would rather die than surrender to an enemy, but its offspring were hitting it when it was down. Even the worst species would rarely turn against their own kind!

Taming, mass reproduction... this place...

The Bird Emperor was such a lofty and unyielding creature, yet its offspring that were produced from the experiments were so ungrateful. The experiment was twisted from the first day. Even the noble lineage and spirit which the Bird Emperor had shown were twisted after being passed down!
