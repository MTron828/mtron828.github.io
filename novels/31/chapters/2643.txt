The Northern Sacred Bears naturally sent two men to follow MO Fan’s group for some distance in case they suddenly changed their minds. They returned only after MO Fan and his crew had gone far away.

It was too late to go after the Northern Sacred Bears now. The underground lake had too many tunnels. It was impossible to tell which way they had gone!

‘They are now to the east of Lanyang,” Lingling informed them all after referring to her laptop. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Huh? How are you tracking them?” Zhao Manyan stuck his face closer to the

“l might have done something to the job letter,” MO Fan said, grinning cunningly.

Everyone raised their thumbs to MO Fan

They initially thought MO Fan had given the job letter back to demand payment for the job, but he was actually setting up the Northern Sacred Bears!

They had seen the leader of the Northern Sacred Bears put the letter away. Lingling just had to track the letter to discover the Northern Sacred Bears’ position.

“But didn’t they jam our signal?” Mu Bai remembered.

‘That’s where they are being overconfident. They are not jamming our signal, they are stopping signals from being transmitted. Otherwise, how would they communicate with their men outside? They are clearly a balanced team of explorers, executors, technicians, commanders, and lookouts. The Sharkmen are coming in huge numbers, but they did not seem worried at all. It means the whole team is constantly communicating. I’ve done some tests and confirmed the signals of our coms aren’t being jammed. They only work u?thin a certain area, ” Lingling corrected him.

Lingling showed the map that was tracking MO Fan’s Dark Material to everyone.

MO Fan’s Dark Material had the ability to track its target. After his Dark Material received its full upgrade , it was able to mark anything that MO Fan could touch.

Lingling had made a device some time ago specialized for tracking down the Dark Material in order to make their jobs easier.

MO Fan had never planned to give up on the Earth Flame Pistil. He was only using the Northern Sacred Bears to take the Earth Flame Pistil out from underground!

‘The signals only work vvThin forty kilometers of where they are, so we have to follow them closely. If they have a Teleportation Portal as part of their escape route, they might shake us off in an instant. It be impossible to track them dowm again,” Lingling warned everyone.

“Which means we don’t have time to call for backup. We’ll have to go after them ourselves!” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

The Northern Sacred Bears were a disciplined organizatiom Guan Songdi had only contacted them and told them about the Earth Flame Pistil a short time ago, but they had already planned out the extraction and the escape.

The surface was swarming with Sharkmen. Normal people would have struggled to evade their overwhelming numbers.

And yet, the Northern Sacred Bears were already east of the city, having avoided the Sharkman Beasts. They had no trouble evading the Ruler-level Sharkman Beasts’ outstanding senses, either!

‘They are moving very quickly. No they let us go so easily. They are already gone by the time we move our eyes away from them!” Jiang Shaoxu exclaimed.

Even the specially-trained military troops could not match the Northern Sacred Bears’ efficiency. They were like a breeze sweeping through Lanyang before quickly heading to the mountains on the other side.

‘They headed east after leaving the city and immediately turned southwest. They have reached Fenghe Mountain City, which was taken over by the Lance Spine Bears,” Lingling said.

“How are they moving so quickly? We have to be extremely cautious throughout the journey to avoid the demon creatures!” Zhao Manyan had to wonder.

The Sharkman Beasts were patrolling the area heavily. The number of Sharkman Beasts flying above the city had multiplied. The Sharkmen must have found out that someone had stolen the energy source of their breeding ground. They were searching for the thieves frantically.

MO Fan and his crew were still around twenty kilometers away from the Northern Sacred Bears , but the distance was gradually increasing because they were struggling to avoid the Sharkman Beasts.

The Northern Sacred Bears had more people. It did not make any sense that they were moving faster than MO Fan and his crew.

‘They stopped moving at Fenghe Mountain City,” Lingling said nervously.

“Isn’t it better if they stopped moving? We can catch up to them!” Zhao Manyan pointed out.

Lingling shook her head and explained, “Judging by how they have been acting, they are very decisive and adaptive. They had no reason to slow dovvll at Fenghe Mountain City after they left Lanyang so quickly, unless they have set up a Magic Formation in Fenghe Mountain City.”

“A Teleportation Portal!” Everyone immediately had the same thought.

The Northern Sacred Bears would have no trouble setting up a Teleportation Portal with the resources they had, especially since they had retrieved the valuable Earth Flame Pistil. The cost of using the Teleportation Portal was worth it!

The Teleportation Portal would send them extremely far away, easily a hundred or even a thousand kilometers. Once they stepped into the Portal, MO Fan and his crew would completely lose track of them. The Northern Sacred Bears would then be able to leave the country.

“We can’t let them escape!’ Everyone immediately felt a sense of urgency.

MO Fan could easily catch up to the Northern Sacred Bears with the Wings of

Dawn and Dusk, but the airspace around Lanyang was occupied by the Sharkman Beasts. If he flew high enough to avoid them, he would have trouble finding the right location. It would be meaningless to fly so high up. “MO Fan, you are faster than us. You should go ahead,” Lingling judged.

“Alright!”

MO Fan left using the Space Element. Zhao Manyan, Mu Bai, Xinxia, Jiang Shaoxu, and Lingling would reach Fenghe Mountain a little later.

Fenghe Mountain City was set up at a high altitude. There were many abandoned villages and towms scattered about it.

Most of the villages had been destroyed by the Lance Spine Bears. The bodies of livestock were rotting everywhere.

MO Fan could see the Fenghe Mountain City after passing the village at the mountain’s waist.

Fenghe Mountain City had been managed by Lanyang. Its size was similar to Bo City. Its main river meandered down the mountain toward Lanyang River Port.

Mu Bai suddenly turned around and asked, “Look, did the river expand?” They could see the river that was flowing down into Lanyang from their point of view. The water of the river was rising. It had started overflowing the streets, making the river even wider!
