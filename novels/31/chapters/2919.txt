Chapter 2920: Elemental Plunder

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Back off.” Lady Karolina closed her eyes and intended to rest until everything was done.

But she was disappointed to see Mu Ningxue defeat Yvette so easily.

She looked at Yvette. She understood that the higher-ups in Holy City had some… needs due to which they kept whichever Mage they preferred no matter how they lacked in strength.

Yvette knew what Lady Karolina was thinking. She was enraged. Her current position as a Holy Ruler wasn’t because of some dirty and cheap reason, she had earned this place with her strength.

But she found Mu Ningxue and her use of magic very weird. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lady Karoline was an Ice Element Mage, and her cultivation had reached the level of a Forbidden Mage. She walked toward Mu Ningxue fearlessly. It was as if she was a noblewoman condemning a female slave to death.

“Use all your strength. When you try your best and still can’t hurt me, you will understand why you are unworthy of living in this world and why your talent must be grafted into me!” Lady Karolina said with contempt.

What Mu Ningxue said before had already angered her.

Mu Rong had isolated the Ice Cave, and the alliance’s meeting to take down the Extreme South Emperor would not end in a short time. She could slowly play with Mu Ningxue till it was time.

Lady Karolina could see that Mu Ningxue was proud and stubborn. However, such a wild girl needed to be taught a lesson. Otherwise, she would not know who she messed with.

She not only wanted to take away Mu Ningxue’s innate talent but also her dignity.

“Elemental Plunder!”

Mu Ningxue suddenly closed her eyes, and her long white-silver holy hair fluttered without wind. She fully exposed her flawless face, which was as beautiful as a work of art. She raised her head slightly and opened her eyes slowly.

Suddenly, the temperature of the Ice Cave dropped sharply. The Ice Element Elves all over the Ice Cave and the glaciers in the Extreme South Land seemed to have heard the queen’s call and were gathering here.

It got colder, and the air began to condense. Mu Ningxue was using her power too!

“Absolute Forbidden Realm?” Lady Karolina maintained a playful expression.

If this is a duel between Super Level Mages, the power of Mu Ningxue’s Absolute Forbidden Realm could make her invincible in battle. After all, it was a power that only Ice Element Heaven Seed possessed. When it combined with the awakened Ice Element supernatural power, she could easily defeat a Super Level Mage like Yvette.

Unfortunately, Lady Karolina was not a Super Level Mage. She was a Forbidden Mage, an orthodox Forbidden Mage who could independently complete Forbidden Magic.

How could Mu Ningxue, who was only at the peak of her Super Level, fight with one of the strongest Forbidden Mage in the world like her?

If Mu Ningxue had obeyed, she might have given her a chance to live. Or she could have immortalized Mu Ningxue’s name for her sacrifice.

Since she was rude, arrogant, and overconfident, she wanted to destroy Mu Ningxue!

“Elemental Plunder!”

Lady Karolina was very familiar with this magic. It could gather ice elements within hundreds of kilometers and enhance one’s domain, control, and magical power.

However, snatching control of the ice element in front of an Ice Element Mage was ridiculous.

Once she made a gesture, those ice elements that surrounded Mu Ningxue like soldiers would instantly become her Elemental Slaves!

Boom!

There was a loud bang. The purple holy flame turned into a brave lion and knocked the Ice Emperor Mu Rong into the air.

The Ice Emperor Mu Rong looked embarrassed. He stood and staggered. He turned to Lady Karoline with a sad face. “Lady Karolina, why did you plunder all the ice elements? My current cultivation is not as good as before, so I can’t use some advanced ice magic under your deterrence.”

Wei Guang looked a little weak. He was confused. He had not recovered from the ice invasion. He should not have been able to compete with an old and experienced Mage like Mu Rong. His Ice Elemental magic was far stronger compared to Wei Guang’s Fire Element in this place.

However, he had injured Mu Rong. Mu Rong’s strength seemed to have been drained away by something, and he suddenly became weak like an old man.

In the beginning, Lady Karolina looked with disgust at the Ice Emperor, Mu Rong, assuming that he could not even handle a weak Forbidden Mage. However, she soon realized that something was wrong.

“I haven’t plundered the elements yet.” Lady Karolina frowned.

Mu Ningxue was the one who had plundered the elements. She turned all the ice elements into her soldiers and created a majestic ice element empire.

However, Mu Rong was an Ice Element Forbidden Mage. How could he lose to Mu Ningxue in a fight involving Ice Element?

“I-I can’t control any Ice Elements,” said the Ice Emperor, Mu Rong.

Lady Karolina’s eyes widened. She spread her hands out and clenched them slowly, trying to plunder all the Ice Elements around her.

To Forbidden Mages, the elements were not soldiers but slaves. And slaves must obey them at all costs!

However, no matter how she pulled the Ice Elements into her hands or ordered them, it would not work at all. All the Ice Elements gathered toward Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue had not even started casting any magic. Those Ice Elements formed a shocking Ice Element storm that spread in a radius of one or two kilometers with Mu Ningxue as the center.

Elements were micro-particles. In the absence of the Mage’s astrological sign, they were harmless and non-threatening. However, Mu Ningxue was gathering the elements. This could turn into a massive disaster.

“What is going on?” Lady Karolina was also shocked.

‘Did the Ice Elements only listen to Mu Ningxue?’

Elements were shared. The Forbidden Mages could plunder a certain element and force the Mages below them to suppress the ability of that element. It would be difficult for Mages to cast magic, and their power would also be greatly reduced.

But even if everyone was a Forbidden Mage, the elements were still shared.

The exclusive use of elements only existed between the Forbidden Mages and low-level mages. Therefore, this phenomenon was impossible!

First, Mu Ningxue was not a Forbidden Mage at all.

Secondly, even if she were a Forbidden Mage, Lady Karolina and Mu Rong were Ice Element Forbidden Mages with a higher level of cultivation.

It was impossible for them not to be able to obtain even one Ice Element!

If they had no Ice Element, they could not even use ice magic at a basic level.

How could an Ice Element Forbidden Mage not be able to use ice magic?
