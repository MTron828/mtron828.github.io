Chapter 243 - Battle of Wits against the Vatican, Part II

Mo Fan stood up and looked at the long cut that reached from his right shoulder to his left. Every time he breathed he felt a scorching pain, it was a form of torment.

Sh*t, in order to make Yu Ang and the Blue Deacon stay, he really was being a bit fearless!

However, that was alright. Him tricking the enemy by injuring himself had been effective. After Yu Ang saw the Little Loach Pendant emitting a dense Underground Holy Spring aura, he appeared to have lost a bit of reasoning.

Is this Underground Holy Spring really that important to him?

There were many heavenly treasures in this world. The ones with effects comparable to the Underground Holy Spring were not few in number. The Black Vatican have no reason to spend this much effort to just obtain it, unless the Underground Holy Spring had another different special usage…

Mo Fan recalled what Xinxia had told him about the fact the Bo City was a guardian city. They guarded the Underground Holy Spring, thus, there must be an ancient secret that had been hidden for nearly two thousand years.

“Gugugugugugu~~~~!!!”

The low roar issued by the Cursed Beast reminded Mo Fan not to ponder over it for too long.

“You evil creature. I was just picking up a phone call and got a little distracted. Do you really think you can hurt me?” Mo Fan nearly flew into rage.

Mo Fan didn’t use his Shadow spells, so as not to show all of his abilities to Yu Ang. Now Mo Fan believed that Yu Ang wouldn’t be able to escape at all, and so he had no reason to hide anything.

The Cursed Beast was able to understand human speech. It gave out a low roar that carried a hint of ridicule.

-Tiny human, you still dare to boast shamelessly at this point?-

Whooooosh!

The Cursed Beast disappeared from where he was standing.

Its figure was continuously fluctuating between places. Mo Fan’s Lightning Strike and Fire Burst were easily avoided by this thing.

Another claw swept past, this time from above, striking down. It wanted to slice Mo Fan into two halves from the top of his head!

Yu Ang stood at the top of the staircase. From within the dense fog, he saw Mo Fan’s silhouette slowly falling into two. The smile on his face turned even more splendid.

Originally, he wanted to leisurely torment Mo Fan to death. However, the Blue Deacon wanted to hastily leave, so Yu Ang didn’t dare waste time. He wanted to take the Underground Holy Spring and leave immediately.

However, before Yu Ang was able to enjoy his excitement, he suddenly realized Mo Fan’s silhouette was in a different place. Due to the fog, Yu Ang was unable to see just how this guy was able to dodge the life threatening claw. However, this flustered Yu Ang even more!

“Sir Priest, the Great Nyx Regime Formation seems to be disappearing,” Fu Tianming hastily informed Yu Ang.

Yu Ang looked up and realized the originally pitch black sky was slowly dispersing. He could already see the dense black cloud and the traces of lights from the buildings in the night sky. He looked around and saw the black mist had already disappeared, and the colossal Iron Cage had completely revealed its astonishing appearance.

The dark maze around the pond had already disappeared. From where Yu Ang was standing, he could see the fountain and the plaza.

Yu Ang’s heart began to give him bad feelings. When the Great Nyx Regime Formation disappeared, they’d have great difficulty hiding their identities. Yu Ang wasn’t scared of these students, he was scared of the teachers. Their strength was much greater than the students.

“The two of you can go and charge in. No matter what happens, we need to obtain the thing before the Great Nyx Regime Formation disappears!” Yu Ang ordered Fu Tianming and Jia Wenqing.

“Sir, if we go in, wouldn’t that just directly expose us…”

Before Jia Wenqing finished, Yu Ang gave the two of them a glare.

The two didn’t dare to oppose him. They took the opportunity when Mo Fan was still dealing with the Cursed Beast to walk into the Iron Cage through the iron door in the corner.

They were already familiar with the Beast Taming Iron Cage. Whether it was the small door or the barrier on top, they knew how to use all of them. Walking in was extremely easy.

“If you’re smart, you should give us the Underground Holy Spring and we’ll let you live!” Fu Tianming pointed at the still-living cockroach Mo Fan angrily.

Mo Fan found the time to look at the two people who had walked into the Iron Cage on their own as his expression turned extremely cold.

They sold their lives to the Black Vatican instead of being good students of the Pearl Institute. They would rather be slaves than people!

Mo Fan concealed some of his strength because he wanted to lure Yu Ang out. There was a barrier within the colossal Iron Cage, and Mo Fan was unable to use Evading Shadow to get out. If he wanted to kill Yu Ang, he would have to lure Yu Ang inside!

Who would know that Yu Ang was actually so sinister and cunning. The situation had escalated to this point, yet he didn’t want to personally deal with it.

Mo Fan was no longer able to hide, so, he’d eliminate them first and then think about what to do later.

The Evading Shadow Technique. When he had pulled a certain distance away from the Cursed Beast, Mo Fan was finally standing in the middle of the entire Iron Cage. From his body, a dense Shadow Aura began to leap out.

Although the Great Nyx Regime Formation had disappeared, Mo Fan was still able to sense the dense Shadow Element in his surroundings.

A strange and mysterious Star Atlas slowly emerged beneath Mo Fan’s feet.

The blood on his chest dripped down from his clothes. The red blood dripped onto the darkly glinting Star Atlas. It caused the entire Atlas to link up in a more outlandish way.

“Giant Shadow Spike!”

The cut on Mo Fan’s chest was extremely astonishing. From his blood-covered chest, a giant Shadow Spike suddenly emerged.

The Giant Shadow Spike that Mo Fan used right now was different from before. It looked like a very slender Shadow Sword. A black aura wrapped around it before it shot off!

Beneath the Nyx Regime, all other Elements would receive a decrease in power. At the same time, the Shadow Element’s power would receive a substantial increase in power. Even the Shadow Beast’s power would increase, not to mention the Magic of a Shadow Magician!

“Go!”

The Giant Shadow Spike followed the wave of Mo Fan’s sleeves as it instantly pierced through the void and disappeared without a trace.

Jia Wenqing and Fu Tianming were both completely flabbergasted by this.

Shadow Magician???

How could Mo Fan be a Shadow Magician?!

At the same time, Yu Ang, who was standing outside, was so furious that his entire being began to tremble.

Shadow Element!

This scoundrel Mo Fan actually possesses the Shadow Element!

No wonder his powers wasn’t influenced by the Great Nyx Regime Formation!

Fire Element.

Lightning Element.

Summoning Element.

Shadow Element!

This guy doesn’t have an Innate Dual Element, he is able to obtain the power of two Elements whenever he awakens! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yu Ang wasn’t resenting Mo Fan because of his face. He was jealous that Mo Fan possessed the talent of an Innate Dual Element. Who would’ve known that this guy possessed an ability that was even more domineering than an Innate Dual Element!

Dual Elements at Primary level. Four Elements at Intermediate level. Once he reached the Advanced level, wouldn’t he possess six Elements?

He definitely needed to get rid of this Mo Fan, definitely!

“Kill! Him! Now!” Yu Ang’s voice had turned into a shout, the flames within his chest began to burn even brighter.

Fu Tianming and Jia Wenqing regained their senses.

The Innate Dual Element was already extremely astonishing to the two of them. This person with Four Elements… they felt as if their whole world was smashed into pieces!
