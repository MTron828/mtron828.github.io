Mo Fan, Blue Deacon, Crow, and a dozen other Blue Deacons were standing behind Unas on the mountain. Unas had alluring curves. Her body was brimming with mature charm, attractive yet deadly.

“Master Unas, what do you want us to do?” Crow asked.

“It’s important to have a backup plan ready,” Unas told the Blue Deacons behind her.

She cast a strange Dark Spell while she was speaking. A dark aura began to surround her. as if it was alive.

The dark aura soon turned into an ugly bat with a pair of fleshy wings. It was the size of a semi truck, but unlike most of the demon creatures, it was extremely skinny. Each of its joints had a bone poking out, with a sharp edge to them. Mo Fan was instantly disgusted by its rotting smell.

“Come up, we have something important to attend to,” Unas said.

The Blue Deacons dared not disobey Unas’ order. They jumped onto the eerie foul-smelling creature. Mo Fan learned the creature was a kind of Cursed Beast from the whispering among the Blue Deacons. It was an extremely powerful Commander-level creature. Unas normally used it as her mount.

Unas was a gorgeous woman, yet her mount was extremely ugly. The sight of them together was eerily incompatible.

It was obvious that beneath Unas’s gorgeous appearance lay a rotten heart. It was impossible to tell how many lives and souls she had taken to create this ghastly creature.

The Jagged Bones Cursed Beast beat its wings and flew above the ocean of undead. There were not many undead with the ability to fly. Even those that were able to fly were dragged to the ground by the Realm of the Heavens.

“What creature is that? Why do I feel like it can see us?” Blue Bat looked down and saw an undead lifting its gaze and staring at them coldly.

The demon creature had the lower body of a scorpion, and was as huge as an office building. The rest of the undead were passing by under its body and between its many legs. Its upper body was covered in scales resembled the body of a beastly woman. It had great curves, but most importantly, its hair consisted of wriggling poisonous snakes. Several hundred snake-hairs over ten meters long were squirming wildly as they watched!

“It’s the Scorpion Lord Medusa!” Blue Bat exclaimed.

Medusa was a creature from ancient Western legends. As a matter of fact, her species was already considered extinct. Their existence was as symbolic as the Totem Beasts of China.

To everyone’s surprise, Medusa had already become an undead of the Great Pyramid of Giza. She stood out like an island among the ocean that was the undead army, like an imperious empress!

Mo Fan estimated the Scorpion Lord Medusa’s strength. He believed even the Realm of the Heavens could not stop her once she reached the walls!

“They think the Wall is enough to stop the undead army. How amusing! The Great Pyramid of Giza still has many other creatures that are as powerful as the Scorpion Lord Medusa. The other undead might struggle against the Wall, but the Scorpion Lord Medusa can surely knock it down!” Unas proclaimed.

Mo Fan had been wondering if the Dark Pharaoh of Serpents could knock the wall down when it reached it.

It was obvious that there was a difference in strength between Ruler-level creatures, too. A strong Ruler-level creature could surely inflict serious damage on the Wall!

“However, we still need some time for the Rulers of the pyramid to gather. We don’t have that much time to waste on the petty Wall. Consider it an utter glory that you’ve been assigned to me, as you will all witness the strongest undead that has been guarding Khufu for thousands of years!” Unas said.

“The strongest undead? What is it?” a Blue Deacon asked.

“You will know what it is very soon. There’s currently a chain holding it down. Our job is to free it!” Unas declared. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Mo Fan’s expression shifted slightly upon hearing the words.

It turned out that he had still underestimated the people of the Black Vatican. He did not expect Unas to have some other plan still, nor did he know what the strongest creature of the Underworld was. However, it was obviously something that could pose a great threat to the Wall!

Mo Fan glanced at the Great Wall in the distance that was stopping the huge army of undead from advancing in the distance. He could not help but worry.

“Old Zhao, it’s all up to you now!” Mo Fan murmured.

Around three kilometers behind the Wall, a pair of golden wings left a misty path behind them, concealing the wearer and his passenger just above the range of mountains under the night sky...

“We’re here. They are after the Magic Fire Beacon on Shenmu Mountain! It looks like Zhang Xiaohou is here, too!” Zhao Manyan looked down from the sky. He saw the fire pillar soaring into the sky and the messy battle between the members of the Black Vatican and the soldiers!

The Black Vatican had the advantage of numbers. After all, their members had been standing by for some time. They immediately made their move as soon as they received the order.

There were around two hundred people guarding the Magic Fire Beacon. Most of them were Battlemages, and the rest were from the Enforcement Union and the Preventive Committee. Their superiors had already given them the order to retreat. The main forces of the Hunter Union, the Magic Association, and the renowned clans had already retreated to Feihuang City with the main army. Only General Bin Wei, the Prophet, and their men had decided to stay behind.

General Bin Wei and Commander Ye Hong had special feelings for North Valley. Their men were extremely loyal, too. Around a thousand elite soldiers decided to stay behind and risk their lives, forming the troops protecting the Magic Fire Beacons. Otherwise, the few men that the Prophet had gathered clearly did not stand a chance against the members of the Black Vatican when they all came out of hiding!

Even if Mo Fan had not infiltrated the Black Vatican, he could at most defend one of the ancient keeps with his Demon Element. It still would not make any difference to the fate awaiting them!

“Is Violet Ghost down there?” Zhao Manyan asked.

“He’s somewhere, but it’s too messy. I’m having trouble finding him!” Lingling said.

“Violet Ghost is their leader. He is most likely the strongest among them,” Zhao Manyan said.

“But the problem is, someone like him is more likely to let his men attack first. He would not show himself unless it’s necessary,” Lingling said.

“Then we can’t afford to rush it. Let’s keep observing!” Zhao Manyan said.

“Mmm, we have to rely on Zhang Xiaohou now, and see if he can force Violet Ghost out of hiding. The average Blue Deacons are no match for him!” Lingling agreed.
