The topic had brought back some memories. Shao Zheng was initially feeling sleepy, but he was now discussing his past with the group of young Mages. Everyone was intrigued at first, but the fatigue soon kicked in after a while.

“Councilman, didn’t you say you are going outstation tomorrow? You should rest early. Why don’t you continue your story next time?” Mo Fan yawned. He could not agree more about the saying that it was easier to call up a spirit than sending it away.

“It’s fine, I will definitely suffer from jet lag because of the time difference. The people in Argentina are only waking up now. I’ll be spending half a month there. Thank you for reminding me,” Shao Zheng said.

“But... we young ones are more concerned about maintaining good health. We’ll be taking a bath with wolfberries in it. You should worry more about the country if you’re feeling restless. We will be going to bed first,” Mo Fan said.

Shao Zheng seemed like he had a lot more to tell them, but he had no choice but to say goodbye to the members of the national team in the end. He realized Ai Jiangtu, Nanyu, and Guan Yu were already asleep on the table. They had completely missed out on the most important part of how he rebuked the Great Prince of England. He was so angry that he took a huge sip of the tea before him.

“Time to head off. Don’t you call me again in the middle of the night for no reason,” Shao Zheng said.

“Rest well...”

“Rest? I’m adjusting my biological clock!” Shao Zheng snapped.

Mo Fan chuckled.

Mo Fan, Lingling, Zhao Manyan, Mu Ningxue, and the others still awake let out a relieved sigh after the call ended.

Jiang Yu finally said with a gloomy face, “I already told you the Chairman loves bringing back old memories. Once, he came to the capital to give us a lecture. The ambassador from Korea was waiting for him, so he was only supposed to give us a forty minutes talk, yet he kept going until it was dark. Everyone was so hungry...”

“Well, I’ve finally witnessed it today. I shall keep that in mind next time,” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan’s phone suddenly rang.

Mo Fan looked at the name on the screen. Oh my, it was Chairman Shao Zheng, and it was his number instead of his secretary’s!

Seriously!?

Was he going to talk to him for the entire night? There were eight members of the national team here. Why must it be him?

Please spare this young man’s life!

“Mo Fan?” Shao Zheng lowered his voice.

“Mm!” Mo Fan felt a great change in Shao Zheng’s tone.

“Were the people of the Heresy Judgment Court on Tianshan Mountain?” Shao Zheng asked.

“Yes,” Mo Fan confirmed.

“I won’t be going to Argentina. I must visit the Heresy Judgment Court,” Shao Zheng declared.

“What happened?” Mo Fan was startled.

“The girl I mentioned before... she became a member of the national team, but the strength she displayed during the World College Tournament was too great, making her a target of the Heresy Judgment Court. Apparently, the Heresy Judgment Court froze her in the biggest rift in the Desolate Ice Field, but she managed to escape somehow. I was told that the Heresy Judgment Court has apprehended her on Tianshan Mountain. They have crossed our country’s boundary to the west and are on their way back to the Sacred City in Europe.”

The news had come as soon as Shao Zheng turned off his laptop. The secretary came into the room without knocking.

Shao Zheng immediately recalled Mo Fan and the others had been on Tianshan Mountain. He decided to call Mo Fan since they might know the details.

“Arrested? Impossible, their Nine Lights Formation was destroyed. The Judicators had to leave Tianshan Mountain before the storm came. There’s no way they could stay behind!” Mo Fan blurted out in astonishment.

Arrested? Didn’t she already escape? How did the Judicators find her in the storm?

“They must have used Forbidden Spells. Those Heresy Judgment Court members are out of their minds, using them in our territory! They did not even care about the safety of our people on Tianshan Mountain!” Shao Zheng said angrily.

“Forbidden Spells? What Forbidden Spells did they use? Isn’t the Heresy Judgment Court supposed to forbid use of Forbidden Spells? Why were they using them instead?” Mo Fan did not understand a single word.

“You don’t need to know the details for now,” Shao Zheng said.

“Where are they now? I’ll intercept them!” Mo Fan was enraged too.

“No, no way, what do you think the Heresy Judgment Court is? You’re just going to intercept them? Mo Fan, you can choose not to treat any countries or organizations seriously, except for the Heresy Judgment Court!” Shao Zheng warned him.

“I can’t let the Heresy Judgment Court take Qin Yu’er. She’s the only concerned the Chief Military Instructor has left. He has sacrificed so much for us. I will be letting him down if I can’t even protect her. He started the War of the Underworld to protect our land...” Mo Fan blurted out.

“I know what you’re trying to say. I’ll negotiate with the Heresy Judgment Court, but you will return to Feiniao City at once. You and Mu Ningxue shouldn’t do anything reckless!” Shao Zheng said.

Mo Fan acknowledged, yet he was unwilling to obey.

Mo Fan was not stupid. The Heresy Judgment Court would not even care, even if Shao Zheng was visiting them as the highest authority of the country’s Magic Association.

The Holy Judgment Court and Heresy Judgment Court were both superior to the Magic Associations. The Magic Associations were obliged to cooperate with them, but they had never taken orders from the Magic Associations. Mo Fan knew Shao Zheng was only trying to protect him. After all, the Heresy Judgment Court had yet to clear his name even now. If he dared to oppose them, they would not hesitate to consider him a heretic and bring him to trial too!

“Mu Ningxue, what should we do now?” Mu Ningxue was struggling to make a decision.

“I have to let Zhan Kong know at once. Only he can save her now,” Mo Fan said. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Mo Fan knew there was nothing he could do about it. He was no match for the experts of the Sacred City, even if he could use the Demon Element. Not only were there Forbidden Mages in the Sacred City of Europe, it was also under the protection of magic Formations that he could not break through, even with all his might. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue could possibly take on the Judicators back on Tianshan Mountain, but their strength was too insignificant once Qin Yu’er was brought to the Sacred City.

“Alright!” Mu Ningxue nodded.

—

Mo Fan headed to the Ancient Capital. The Queen of the Netherworld was the only one left. The rest of the Undead Rulers were still busy with the war.

Mo Fan flew to the Ancient Capital even before he could get some rest. The Queen of the Netherworld had left him with a method if he needed to contact her.

Mo Fan went to the shrine and lit an incense stick. The Queen of the Netherworld’s alluring face gradually solidified, materialized while drifting closer to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan spoke before the Queen of the Netherworld could attempt to seduce him, “The Heresy Judgment Court has taken your boss’ woman. You must let him know at once.”
