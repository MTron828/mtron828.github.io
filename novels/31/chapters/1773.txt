As long as Mo Fan did not struggle, he would not have to suffer a broken leg or arm.

When the Black-Silver Rock Demon grabbed Mo Fan’s legs and lifted him off the ground upside down, he was beginning to regret his decision. What if Wen Xia was not reliable? What if she missed the attack?

The Black-Silver Rock Demon lifted Mo Fan to its chest, where its absorption system was.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon’s chest began to move and soften. It gradually turned slimy as it transformed into mud. It was not like the usual black mud in a swamp, but a cluster of monsters that lacked the support of bones. They were bunched up together, their arms and tongues trying to drag Mo Fan into them.

Mo Fan had been through a lot, so he was still able to retain his calm.

In the mud, Mo Fan saw a weird face with a cunning and evil grin. It was like a starving demon trapped in a cage. It had a strong urge to drain away a living human’s energy as soon as it saw one.

“An evil Elemental spirit?” Mo Fan recalled reading about the rare species in some books. “But, if it’s an evil Elemental spirit, how did it become stronger by draining the energy of Mages?”

Mo Fan was confused, but he no longer had time for it when he was being forced into the mud by the Black-Silver Rock Demon. His mind was full of foul words instead.

What the heck was that woman waiting for? Half of his body had already been dragged into the mud. When was she even going to attack!?

“Nine-Layered Scorpion Sting!”

With a loud chant, a tall slender figure emitting a brilliant brown light appeared on top of a tower. The Star Orbits, Star Patterns, and Star Constellations were combining into a spectacular Star Palace, setting off Wen Xia’s alluring body and imperious stance!

Mo Fan was hanging upside down. He realized how special the world was when he was viewing it from such a special position.

The buildings in the city were severely damaged, but had remained standing at different heights. The ground began to rise from the intertwining streets under the tower Wen Xia was standing on. It rose over ten meters into the air, as if something was breaking out of it.

An enormous scorpion tail emerged from the sand in the air like a dragon. The cracks on the streets resembled the shape of a scorpion too!

Only the spectacular scorpion tail, made of some kind of special stone, was emerging from the ground. The tail reached higher than the building as it coiled, and struck. The sting at its end was just as long and sharp as the top of the tower. The sting went right through the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s hand, only five centimeters away from Mo Fan’s groin...

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was pushing Mo Fan into its chest, so the scorpion sting nailed its hand on its chest. It even went through the evil face in the mud and pierced right through the creature’s back!

“F**k...f**k...f**k me!” Mo Fan felt his groin twitching.

Five centimeters! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Only five centimeters!

Mo Fan could normally reach fifteen centimeters during a normal erection. That madwoman, was she trying to stop him from being a man anymore or what? The creature’s hand was so huge, yet she had to aim so close to his important body part!

Mo Fan’s balls, so closely missed by the sting, were still recovering from the fright. Mo Fan immediately yelled at Wen Xia with a pale face, “You should have just killed me too!”

Wen Xia did not respond to Mo Fan. She had a stern face as she uttered slowly, “The second layer!”

“What second layer... holy shit, stop, stop it at once!” Mo Fan yelled at the top of his lungs.

The ground began to shake again. A bigger scorpion tail rose from the ground and stabbed the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s hand and chest.

“Can you please aim a little lower...no, a bit higher, f**k me!” Mo Fan’s voice echoed in the air.

It was no longer just a matter of five centimeters. That woman obviously had no idea where Mo Fan was, nor did she understand that there was something more important than being alive for a man!

Mo Fan almost broke his joints when he tried to reposition himself. Meanwhile, a scorpion sting went between his legs and struck the Black-Silver Rock Demon in the chest once again. It had left an even more obvious hole on the creature’s chest this time.

“Damn it, I swear I’m going to remind her how it feels to be a woman once I get down there...” Mo Fan exploded after the scorpion sting barely missed him again.

“The third layer!” Wen Xia had no clue what Mo Fan was saying. She remained focused in a battle stance.

“Nine layers... don’t tell me there are seven more of them!... Brother, put me down, I’ll kill her for you!” Mo Fan was on the verge of losing his mind.

He would rather be absorbed by the Black-Silver Rock Demon, at least it would only drain his energy instead of threatening his life! Meanwhile, Wen Xia was not only trying to take his life, she was taking the lives of his children and grandchildren!

The nine layers indeed represented the total number of scorpion stingers. The huge outline of a scorpion remained throughout the duration of the spell. Nine scorpion tails struck the Black-Silver Rock Demon and left its chest filled with holes. They also completely destroyed Mo Fan’s dignity.

Mo Fan totally forgot to balance himself as he fell from the air.

He landed on the ground and quickly checked his groin. His legs felt numb, on top of the mental paralysis he was under.

As he thought, the little thing was given a huge fright. It had shrunk like a little loach.

Mo Fan was extremely down, like a petite wife who had been messed up roughly by her muscular husband. His legs were even clutched inward when he rose to his feet.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon collapsed to the ground like a skyscraper after a deafening blast. Its body began to break into pieces. Several Mages wrapped in cocoons of ashes fell out of its remains.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon had indeed absorbed a lot of people. It felt like its massive body was stacked up with a high number of Mages.

“Are you alright?” Wen Xia came down from the tower and patted Mo Fan on the shoulder when she saw the empty look in his eyes.

“You must be held responsible if it’s somehow traumatized. You must resurrect it and reinstate its vigor. Do you understand!?” Mo Fan said.

Wen Xia lowered her head and said with a serious face, “I will take responsibility for it, after the Barrier Core and the city are safe.”

“...”
