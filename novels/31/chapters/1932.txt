The Dali Clan...

Leaves were falling to the ground in the delicate front yard after a gust of wind blew by. Li Dong was sitting on a recliner with a grim face.

The Nanxi Mountain Enforcement Union had still ended up in Tangyue’s hands. He was supposed to be promoted as the Vice Elder’s assistant, but unfortunately, he had picked the wrong side, so he had to find another position to fill. He wondered if the clan was going to help him again.

BANG!

Li Dong fell from his chair after hearing the loud crash. When he rose to his feet, he saw a man flying into the front yard from the other side of the fence. He landed in the middle of the court and destroyed the delicate hedges that the gardeners had put in a lot of effort to trim.

The man was still engulfed in flames, and was badly burned.

Li Dong immediately recognized his cousin. He asked with a puzzled face, “Li Kai, what’s going on?!”

Li Kai was now a member of the South Wing Platoon. His position was much better than a nominal member of the Enforcement Union like him, so Li Dong did not understand why Li Kai was badly beaten up on such a fine afternoon. Who was he fighting with?

With another huge blast, the beautiful fences of the courtyard were smashed to pieces. A strong wave of heat surged into the courtyard, together with blazing flames. It spread across the outer circle of the courtyard like a rug.

A man walked out of the flames menacingly. The flames erupting from him were about to set the whole place on fire!

Many servants had gathered in the courtyard. Their strength varied, and many of them were Advanced Mages. However, not a single person dared to step forward to stop the man in raging flames, standing quickly to the side.

“Who do you think you are? I might not stay in Fanxue Mountain and Feiniao City too often, but it doesn’t mean any Tom, Dick, or Harry can point their fingers at us!” the man snarled.

The people who were having a clan meeting came out after hearing the loud noises.

The Dali Clan had been around since Feiniao City was designated a headquarters city. The clan had grown and become one of the top three clans in the southeast of the country, yet someone had dared to force their way in. That person was seriously going to screw himself up for this!

“Mo Fan!” The cunning old fox Li Kuang recognized the man in the flames instantly.

The person who was walking out of the flames was none other than Mo Fan!

Li Kuang’s eyes were starting to blur with anger. Li Kuang had been competing with Mu Ningxue and Mu Zhuoyun for a long time, since he was the person-in-charge of the Dali Clan. He had never taken Mo Fan seriously, yet this infamous scoundrel had broken into their territory during their first encounter! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He had gone too far!

“I’m only going to ask once: did your clan set Mu Bai up?” Mo Fan did not show any mercy. They were already enemies in the first place. The Dali Clan had been troubling Fanxue Mountain a lot. He would not be Mo Fan if he still went easy on them!

“What Mu Bai? Don’t you dare act recklessly just because Great Councilman Shao Zheng has your back! This is private land that belongs to the Dali Clan! If you dare trespass into our territory and use magic, we can execute you right on the spot without the Magic Association’s permission! We won’t be afraid to bring it up to the Great Councilman either!” Li Kuang pointed at Mo Fan and snarled, like he had just been slapped in the face.

To think that someone like him had broken into a renowned clan’s courtyard! It would be a disgrace if they allowed Mo Fan to leave in one piece.

“The fact that I’m here means your petty tricks simply aren’t a threat to me!” Mo Fan continued forward while glaring at Li Kuang.

Li Kuang was startled by Mo Fan’s Aura. He did not expect the young man’s cultivation to be so strong!

“Do you really think our clan has no one else? Go, I’ll make whoever kills him an honorable elder!” Li Kuang told his men.

There were some experts among the henchmen, but they were not even comparable to Mo Fan’s little finger. There were also one or two Super Mages watching over the clan, but they would not make their moves recklessly before understanding what was going on. A battle between Super Mages was not playing house. The whole clan would be caught up in it!

“Calm down, calm down, master, please calm down first. Let me ask him why he’s here first...” Li Dong noticed the tension between both sides. He knew starting a fight now would not bring any benefits to either side.

Li Dong did not wait for Li Kuang’s response. He quickly ran up to Mo Fan with a smile.

Mo Fan glanced at the opportunist. His face was not friendly in the slightest.

“Brother Mo Fan, even though there were some conflicts between us, it’s only because we are on different sides. However, there’s no reason for you to break into our territory today. We still have the elderly and some young children with us. Even if you want to settle the dispute between us, we should find another place and time to do so... That being said, we don’t have to go so far. There must be some sort of misunderstanding. Can you please put out your flames and withdraw your lightning first. There’s nothing we can’t settle peacefully!” Li Dong said.

“Go ahead and ask Li Kai what he did!” Mo Fan said impatiently.

Li Dong knew Li Kai was the reason why Mo Fan was here. He quickly helped Li Kai up and gave him a probing look. “I’ve witnessed this Mo Fan’s strength in person. We’ll need a few Super Mages just to stop him. You should bear with him and tell us everything. Otherwise, this madman might actually kill you on the spot and leave right away. We won’t be able to stop him.”

“I...I didn’t do it!” Li Kai protested as he struggled to his feet. He no longer dared to act arrogantly after he was beaten up, and started spilling the beans. “I admit that I wasn’t paying attention to Mu Bai’s back when we were defending the Xingling Route. A sea monster ended up ambushing him from behind, but I wasn’t the one who killed him. I didn’t kill him. I was just jealous of him, but there’s no way I would dare to kill him in the middle of an operation!”

“You killed Mu Bai? The Chief of the South Wing Platoon?!” Li Dong blurted out.

“No, I didn’t do it! He was only injured because of my carelessness. He did say he was fine, but he suddenly disappeared after that. The South Wing Platoon has been looking for him in Xiamen ever since, but we just couldn’t find him... you have to believe me, I didn’t set him up!” Li Kai was seriously afraid. He finally recalled that this Mo Fan was someone who would do anything just to get his revenge!
