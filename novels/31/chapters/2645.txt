Old Santel took a step forward. His eyes were stabbing at Mo Fan’s heart, like a scalpel dissecting the complicated emotions within it.

Old Santel was good at attacking a person’s mind. Understanding his enemy’s strengths and weaknesses, what they were confident in and afraid of, would make him unbeatable.

People often called him the Spirit Surgeon, as he was too familiar with a person’s inner thoughts, allowing him to land his scalpel at the perfect spot to take out an enemy.

To Old Shantel’s surprise, the mental strength of the young man before him was higher than anyone he had ever met.

Even when his sharp scalpel was closing in on MO Fan’s heart, it was still beating at the same frequency, as if he knew the scalpel could never penetrate its hard shell!

“Every person has a weakness. The only difference is how good you are at hiding it. Some people expose their weaknesses quite easily with a little probing, while others wrap themselves up tightly without any gaps. However, the place you are protecting the most is often the weakest spot!” Old Santel continued to dissect MO Fan’s heart.

He could sense a lot of emotions from MO Fan. The young man was not an assassin who had undergone special training, so he could not control his emotions perfectly.

It was quite the opposite. The young man was brimming with emotions. In Old Santel’s view, he was like a huge castle with sturdy walls!

“Interesting, you are afraid of the Psychic Element and the Sound Element, but your mind is stronger than ordinary Mages. However, I have still found a way to take you down,” Old Santel proclaimed with a cunning smile.

Yangel remained at the side, with no intention of intervening in the fight.

Their goal was not to take out their enemies, but to finish constructing the Teleportation Portal and leave this place!

The Sharkmen would soon surround the mountain city. The Teleportation Portal was the only way out of here!

MO Fan looked up the mountainside and saw a dim silver light behind the trees. It was exactly what Lingling had guessed. They were trying to escape with a Teleportation Portal!

A strange mist was coming from behind them. It was cold and moist, as if a huge storm was approaching. MO Fan knew the Sharkmen’s army was on their way. The mist was merely preceding them!.

“We are running out of time. Let’s make it quick, but I have to say that we have the upper hand since we have the Earth Flame Pistil. You will have to defeat us to get it, while we just need to hold on for a little longer,” Old Santel went on confidently.

He was telling the truth. Old Santel knew the young man was not a normal Mage through his observations. It would not be wise to fight him head-on, so his best option was to drag out the fight.

“I’ve constructed a Mind Maze in front of you. I wonder if you can find the way out in time,” Old Santel smirked at his opponent.

He had constructed an illusionary maze after peering into his enemy’s heart. The maze would feel extremely real to his opponent. MO Fan had to obey the rules of the maze, regardless of how strong his cultivation was.

Old Santel’s Mind Maze was an Absolute Domain from a Heaven-grade Seed. An enemy trapped inside it would have to fight themselves!

The scenery in front of MO Fan changed like a spinning vortex. Even though MO Fan knew it was just an illusion, he had no idea how to stop it.

Why were his emotions behaving wildly, when he knew it was just an illusion?

It was like watching a horror film. Everyone knew the horror elements and the story were fake, yet they were still terrified as they were watching the film.

The illusion MO Fan was seeing worked the same way.

MO Fan’s mental state was strong, so Old Santel was not hoping he could trick MO Fan into believing the illusion was real. He did not mind telling MO Fan it was just an illusion, nor was he hoping the illusion would break him down. He just had to waste MO Fan’s time!

Old Santel’s winning condition was not defeating MO Fan. He just needed to buy some time!

As time went by, an enemy would feel anxious and worried. Their fear would be their biggest weakness!

“Why don’t you take him out straight away?” Yangel asked Old Santel.

Old Santel shook his head and said, “That young man is a monster. I can sense more than one Heaven-grade Seed and powerful abilities on him. It might even take you a long time to beat him.”

“He’s that strong? I can’t even tell!” Yangel blurted out in surprise.

Back in northern Europe, not many people could last for more than a few hundred rounds when fighting him. He did not expect the young man to be so strong!

“I know you enjoy pinning your enemy down on the ground, but today isn’t the time for it,” Old Santel warned him.

“I see. I’m indeed curious about that young man, but I can’t risk blowing the operation for it,” Yangel nodded.

“Santel, get back here at once. Some goddamn woman has taken over one of our Space Mages and disrupted the Magic Formation!” Kunoy suddenly yelled from the communication device.

Old Santel frowned. 14 woman?

The young man was the only one who snuck in. How did a woman appear out of nowhere? It sounded like she was an expert of the Psychic Element, too!

“Yangel, I have to head back. I’ll leave him to you. Try not to waste too much time on him,” Old Santel said.

“Got it, I hope so too!” Yangel smiled.

He stretched his arms and raised his hand, forming a fist before throwing a punch at MO Fan.

An enormous fist swept across the air with incredible force. It erupted into flames in the air, leaving a scorching trail behind it before splitting into several rays of light!

MO Fan was trapped in the Mind Maze, and had found himselfin a city that looked just like Bo City. A huge meteorite suddenly fell from the sky and destroyed the buildings and the One-eyed Magic Wolves that were swarming it. MO Fan abruptly found himself back in the woods, facing a deadly punch!

The burning fist had lit up the whole area!

MO Fan thought it was a Fire Spell at first, but he immediately realized it was a Light Spell after he sensed the destructive light rays capable of penetrating everything in their path!.
