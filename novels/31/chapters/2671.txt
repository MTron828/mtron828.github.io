Chapter 2673: There can only be One Magistrate!

Mu Bai could not stop the fierce black river in time. He quickly turned around and yelled, “Old Zhao, stop the river. It can turn people into Undead!”

The water of the black river was filled with the strong presence of death. An ordinary person would rot at the slightest touch, and their flesh would harden like a corpse. If they were soaked in the water for a little longer, they would immediately turn into an Undead!

Not every member of Fanxue Mountain had reached the Advanced Level or the Super Level. Many of the younger Mages were only at the Intermediate Level. They would not survive if they were caught by the river!

Zhao Manyan reacted a little too slow, mainly because he did not expect Lin Kang would target the members of Fanxue Mountain while he was clearly fighting Mu Bai.

However, a defensive Mage would always have some precautions in case of an emergency.

“The Flood-Suppressing Boulder is the perfect choice to handle a flood!”

Zhao Manyan swiftly constructed an Earth Star Palace at an insane speed. It was obvious he had spent a lot of effort on mastering this spell.

A boulder glowing brown appeared in front of the members of Fanxue Mountain. It was the size of a billboard on the street, but that was only the size of a pebble compared to the black river!

However, the ancient Runes on the boulder, similar to the lines on a tortoiseshell, possessed godly power. The black river changed direction as soon as it collided with the boulder.

It was like a sharp turn of a river. The fierce tide suddenly changed direction under the influence of a mysterious energy.

“Well done, how does it work?” Bai Hongfei asked in surprise.

“Every racer knows how to do it. It’s just physics,” Zhao Manyan said with a knowing smirk.

Zhao Manyan had changed the direction of the river. The river was initially heading up the mountain, but Zhao Manyan had reversed it and made it flow toward the North City’s army instead! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The North City’s army was terrified when they saw the black river surging at them.

Lin Kang’s face paled. He turned around and cursed, “What are you all afraid of? That’s my spell! It’s not going to hurt you!”

Lin Kang pulled his brush back. A funnel appeared from the clouds and absorbed the black river.

The tip of his brush was white at first, but it swiftly turned black after reabsorbing the black river.

The dark clouds disappeared, together with the Undead Soldiers and the ancient battlefield. Everything had faded away like a mirage.

“It seems like you aren’t as impressive as you were in the past. You can’t even handle a young Mage,” Zhao Jing mocked him.

Lin Kang’s face turned cold. He had thought it was ridiculous when someone was given the nickname the White Magistrate. Young people nowadays liked to exaggerate things just to attract people’s attention, so Lin Kang had never treated the so-called White Magistrate seriously.

However, he realized he was wrong after he fought him. The White Magistrate did have some tricks up in his sleeves!

It was better that way. It simply meant the Ice Brush possessed great power, making it the perfect material to upgrade his own Brush!

“Didn’t you see that blond monkey intervening in our battle? If you are that capable, you could have taken care of them in Lanyang. You wouldn’t need our help,” Lin Kang retorted.

“Humph, if it weren’t for the Sharkman Chieftain, I wouldn’t have let them leave alive!” Zhao Jing snarled.

It was the Sharkman Chieftain who had saved them!

“I can temporarily strengthen you all with a spell. We should focus on defeating these bandits of Fanxue Mountain as soon as possible. Otherwise, it will be a little complicated once other factions are involved,” Nanrong Ni said grimly.

Fanxue Mountain had its backers. The Bai Clan, Dongfang Clan, and Mui Clan were already on their way from the Magic City. Most importantly, the seniors of the Nanrong Clan already told her another regiment was on its way to reinforce Fanxue Mountain. They only had half a day left to finish their job!

Zhao Jing was well aware of the situation. The regiment was just like the Sharkman Chieftain. He would no longer be able to achieve his goal once the military arrived!

“I have long heard the Nanrong Clan is talented in the Blessing Element. The Chief of the South Wing Platoon isn’t necessarily as strong as me, but he’s just trying to drag on the fight. I think it’s in our best interest to end the battle as quickly as possible!” Lin Kang could not afford to lose face in front of his men.

“We should focus on the big picture,” Nanrong Ni agreed.

Lin Kang obviously had the upper hand in the fight, but it would take him some time to beat Mu Bai. Nanrong Ni just had to lend him a hand with the Blessing Element. Mu Bai would not be able to hold on any longer.

“I’ve Cast a Double Blessing that can strengthen two of your main Elements by fifty percent, but it will only last for a short time,” Nanrong Ni waved her hand. A milky-white light burst out of her fingers and sprinkled down on Lin Kang.

“Fifty percent!” Even Zhao Jing was astounded. The Blessing Magic was indeed useful, being able to strengthen two main Elements of a Mage by fifty percent! Zhao Jing might have the guts to explore some of the more dangerous places in the wild if he could bring her along.

Zhao Jing’s eyes flickered with desire for that power.

Lin Kang also felt a lot more confident after receiving the effects of Nanrong Ni’s Blessing Magic.

“White Magistrate?! Hah, I’m the only Magistrate in the south!” Lin Kang pressed forward again.

His clothes drifted in the wind as he pointed his Brush at Mu Bai, and a strong wind started blowing. The sky darkened once again, even though he did not write the ‘death’ Word. The Undead soldiers were willing to fight for him without receiving any sacrifices from him.

Lin Kang burst out laughing as he felt an unprecedented power rising inside him.

Undead Soldiers? He was summoning Undead Generals!

Lin Kang had opened the Gate of Hell after his Curse Element and Undead Element were strengthened by the Blessing Magic!
