The rain poured heavily. The silhouettes of the seven people in the rain gradually turned blurry. Only Mo Fan teasing Mu Ningxue could be heard clearly, and most importantly, Mu Ningxue was actually responding to his teasing.

Guan Yu’s teeth were rubbing against one another. He almost felt like he was about to explode!

“What is there to feel angry about?” said Jiang Shaoxu.

‘”It’s none of your business!” snapped Guan Yu. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Then Mu Ningxue isn’t your business, either. That guy Mo Fan dares to throw away his precious title and be a defender just to stay with her, and yet you didn’t dare to do anything apart from feeling angry here,” mocked Jiang Shaoxu.

“You...” Guan Yu was about to talk back, yet he realized he could not say a word.

Would he dare to do the same thing?

No chance, the thought never even crossed his mind!

When his grandfather was scolding him, he did not have the slightest courage to fight back. He had grown up under the old man’s authority. He had no courage to reason with him, as he clearly knew that he would lose all his brilliance if he did so.

But Mo Fan was different; he was willing to leave the team just like that! Mu Ningxue chose a difficult path to walk, yet he still chose to stay with her!

Guan Yu was not stupid. He understood that even the icy Mu Ningxue would be touched by Mo Fan.

The rain grew heavier as the group walked into the distance. The rage in Guan Yu’s heart slowly dissipated, replaced by a sense of helplessness, a sense of defeat that he could not even find words to comfort himself about.

“Guan Yu, what are you scared of? You’re a representative of the national team. Once you make a name for yourself in Venice, you can get any girl you want, including Mu Ningxue! That Mo Fan is just a piece of trash. You can easily deal with him with a single wave. People only admire the strong, it’s the same for women. Mu Ningxue is the kind that likes to stand at the top, and you can give her that,” Zu Jiming comforted Guan Yu, as he had a different view on the matter.

Guan Yu had the same thought too, but he knew Mu Ningxue was not anything like that. He believed if he gave up on his spot and stayed with her as a defender, she would be touched, too. Unfortunately, the person who could do that was not him!

“There really is someone like him in this world...” Nanrong Ni whispered, staring into the distance.

“It’s true love!” Zhao Manyan was soaked in tears.

He always thought he was experienced at flirting with girls. He was a master of all techniques when it came to picking up ladies, but it was nothing compared to Mo Fan’s decision!

After all, he could never do what Mo Fan had done!

The cold rain was still pouring at the airport. The plane was moving on the runway. Mu Ningxue sat beside a window, but her thoughts seemed to have wandered away.

It went without saying that the person sitting behind her was none other than Mo Fan. Even if the seat did not belong to him, he would shamelessly exchange the seat with the person who was supposed to be sitting beside her. She was too familiar with the idiot.

The truth was, Mu Ningxue had yet to recover from the shock. She never thought Mo Fan would give up his spot.

“Are you touched?” asked Mo Fan as he moved closer and nudged Mu Ningxue.

“Not at all,” said Mu Ningxue.

“But your heart thinks otherwise, as usual!” Mo Fan smiled.

“You really didn’t have to do that. Besides, you should stay away from me, or you’ll only get into trouble,” said Mu Ningxue seriously.

“Do you know? There’s an advantage for people who solely rely on themselves like me; the fact that we don’t have to act according to other people’s wishes. On top of that, if any asshole dares to say you’re one of the Black Vatican, I’ll smack them to death with my shoe! A bunch of self-righteous people who acted like they have personally encountered the Black Vatican before!” cursed Mo Fan.

“What about the families of the victims?” asked Mu Ningxue.

“Oh, that’s even easier to settle.”

“Why?” Mu Ningxue could not follow Mo Fan’s thoughts.

“Because they will definitely recognize me,” answered Mo Fan.

“You’re talking as if you are the person that saved the Ancient Capital. Forget it... there’s no turning back after all,” Mu Ningxue already knew what her goals were. It was scarier for a person to feel lost in difficult times!

“I’m serious, come to the Ancient Capital with me if you have the chance. You’ll find that the people will treat me like their own son... ugh, like a hero!”

“What does it have to do with me?” Mu Ningxue would never believe Mo Fan. She simply assumed Mo Fan was teasing her. She did appreciate Mo Fan livening up the mood, considering the difficult time she was having.

“You’re my first wife.”

“...”

As a matter of fact, if Mo Fan could leave out the word ‘first’, she would be more touched and more willing to trust him.

She had never seen anyone as shameless as him!

On the other hand, it was not like Mo Fan was not sensible, but he was unwilling to lie to anyone.

A pot of green tea, two cups, and a bamboo grove...

Lingyin Enforcement Union’s backyard always had a sense of peace and calm that separated it from the noisy city.

The person brewing tea was Tang Zhong. He poured the tea into the cups to seventy percent full. The tea reflected the black hair and mustache of the man drinking the tea. He had an aged, but handsome face.

“Speaking of Mo Fan, I’m curious. Feng Li is famous for being unreasonable. How did you convince him to let Mo Fan join the team?” Tang Zhong smiled.

“Please don’t mention it, my heart aches whenever I think about it,” said the man with a black mustache.

“I bet it’s something significant if losing it can make your heart ache?” Tang Zhong raised his brows. He was so intrigued that he forgot he was pouring the tea.

“Ain’t that right? I wasn’t even that nice to my daughter, to give that thing away without blinking... Hopefully that kid won’t let me down. Let’s enjoy the tea, I don’t want to talk about it now, I just want to enjoy my tea,” said the man with a black mustache.

Tang Zhong wanted to ask more questions, but his phone started beeping. Someone had sent him a text.

Tang Zhong took a look at the screen. His face immediately wore an indescribable expression. It was a mix of astonishment, confusion, surprise, and awkwardness!

“What is it, something serious happened?” said the man with a black mustache.

“Err... well... Mo Fan left the team,” said Tang Zhong in a strange tone.

“F**k, who dares to kick him out? Ask Feng Li and those four advisors to come see me, right now!” the man rose to his feet.

“He quit the team himself.”

The man was instantly left speechless.

“What exactly did you give them?” asked Tang Zhong again.

The man’s face was already twitching!

“Do you want to see him now?” asked Tang Zhong.

“It’s fine,” the man with a black mustache took a deep breath, before forcing the words out between the gaps of his teeth. “I’m afraid that I’ll tear him to pieces!”
