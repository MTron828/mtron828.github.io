Mo Fan was so cunning with his move that even the Healer Palice was stunned for a moment.

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan had long been prepared for it. When Palice cast the Healing Spirit the first time, Mo Fan had realized he had to keep an eye out for her. All the damage he inflicted would be in vain if he let her use her Healing Spells!

Frank was severely injured by Mo Fan’s Fiery Fist, and then tossed around by Mo Fan’s Space Element. He was starting to lose consciousness. His body floated on the water, and he would not be able to get up for some time.

The judges hesitated upon seeing this.

“Don’t touch him, he’s fine, he can still fight!” Prince Beny yelled.

The reason why international magic tournaments were not common was because of the risks involved in a match. The lives of participants would be endangered if there were any mishaps. The World College Tournament was very strict with keeping the participants safe, having strong Mages on standby along the boundary of the stage. They would interrupt immediately if any participant’s life was endangered.

However, once the judges intervened, it would also mean the person had been disqualified. Even if the judges made the wrong call, the person would still have to leave the match.

Similarly, if the judges believed that a person had lost their ability to fight any further, and any Healer on their team was struggling to heal them, the judges would also disqualify the person.

As such, Prince Beny could not help but yell out. He did not want a Mage of the royal family disqualified so easily, as it would mean the arrogance and pride he had displayed in the Chinese team’s resting area would turn into heavy slaps, leaving his face with a burning sensation!

“Mo Fan, the Water Mage is moving toward Frank, he’s trying to take him away!” Nanyu’s voice came to him.

Mo Fan switched his gaze toward the water, and after taking a closer look, he did see some strange movement under it. It was likely where the Water Mage was.

“Still trying to save him?” Mo Fan chuckled. He immediately used Telekinesis to lift the semi-conscious Frank up from the water.

The Water Mage was only inches away from reaching Frank. If he managed to secure Frank and brought him back to the team, he would recover in no time. To the fellow’s surprise, the Chinese were able to react so quickly!

“Judge, here you go!” Mo Fan did not cross the line. He did not have any personal grudges against Frank. He believed he had done enough to embarrass Prince Beny!

The judges could no longer stand and watch. If Mo Fan exerted even slightly greater force on Frank, the man’s life would be in danger.

Two assistant judges quickly showed up and carried Frank down from the stage.

—

As the first participant was disqualified, different uproars took place among the spectators. The Royal Mage of Spain, Frank, was fairly reputable in Europe. It was reasonable if he was knocked out by multiple Mages during a team battle, yet many people found it hard to believe that he had lost in a one-on-one duel, especially the supporters of the Spanish team. Whether they were watching the match at the arena or through the live broadcast, their hearts were broken!

“You should have prepared more before the match. According to my information, the representative called Mo Fan is one of the strongest members of the Chinese team,” Conti sighed. She kept feeling that Prince Beny had been too careless with his approach.

“Him? That impolite savage?” Prince Beny was stunned, yet the truth was right before him. Even Frank was not worthy to take him on!

“Speaking of which, isn’t the Chinese team a bit too strong in this tournament? That imperious Space Mage, the Ice Mage that destroyed the whole Japanese team, and now, this Fire Mage! Each of them has overwhelming strength!” an observant member of the royal family spoke up.

“Why are you all feeling so down? It’s true that we’ve lost Frank, but it doesn’t necessarily mean we’ve lost the match. Don’t forget that we have a great advantage at this stage. Didn’t you all notice how quiet Pinole has been? I believe Frank has bought him enough time!” The advisor of the Spanish team was perfectly calm.

A strange vibration began to take place in the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground. The surface of the lake shook vigorously, as if a strong earthquake had taken place under it. Even the mounds resembling dragon fangs began to tremble.

“Catastrophe Wave!”

On the Spanish team, the man that was so quiet that everyone had almost forgotten about him suddenly uttered a great roar, followed by a shocking tide rising from the lake. It continued to rise high up into the sky!

The crowd seated in the direction that the tide was approaching panicked and fled for their lives, yet they were relieved when they saw the tide come to a stop after hitting the magic barrier.

Even the people outside the barrier were in a panic seeing how enormous the tide was, let alone those that were within the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground!

“Catastrophe Wave, my heavens, isn’t that a Super Spell?” Zu Jiming screeched like a pig about to be slaughtered.

“How could the Spanish team possibly have a Super Mage?”

“It’s over!”

The water of the Catastrophe Wave had risen high up into the sky, like an enormous, blue mountain emerging from the ground. Mo Fan felt like his heart was about to burst under the enormous pressure!

Mo Fan stood on top of a Dragon Fang. He was drenched wet as the wave rapidly approached him. His entire vision was filled up by the raging tide, yet he was still having trouble seeing the entire thing!

“Impossible, that guy can’t be a Super Mage!” Despite the astonishment Mo Fan was feeling, he strongly believed in himself.

Mo Fan had witnessed a real Catastrophe Wave at the Ancient Capital. The tide that devoured thousands of undead within an instant greatly differed from the current one he was seeing in the Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground, yet in terms of appearance, it was truly a Super Spell!

Its damage! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Facing the enormous tide, Mo Fan finally discovered what the difference was amid the pressure.

If the spell actually possessed the strength of a Super Spell, even at his current distance, all his bones would have broken into pieces by now, yet he was still perfectly fine!

Either way, Mo Fan would never believe he was going up against a Super Level in the World College Tournament. There must be a reason why the person was able to cast a spell that was similar to a Super Spell.

The Catastrophe Wave was absolutely deafening as it crushed the weaker Dragon Fangs to pieces. It continued to roll forward in an unstoppable manner.

The tide had devoured half of the stage, including the five representatives of the Chinese team. The fierce tide rolled forward, and did not seem to stop even after it splashed at the boundary of the magic barrier!

There was only water left on the stage. It was so crazy, like the water of an ocean had been poured into the stage.

The people had no idea where the members of the Chinese team were. They could not even see their tiny figures.

Some time later, the Catastrophe Wave gradually calmed down. The stage was in a great mess, as all the Dragon Fangs were destroyed, while the water level had risen by more than ten meters...

“How...how is this possible...” Zhao Manyan was totally at a loss for words.

A Super Mage, the Spanish team had a Super Mage!

In the past World College Tournaments, the Advanced Level was the highest level among the participants. There had never been a Super Mage. As a matter of fact, no participant had ever mastered the second or third tier of their Advanced Spells. So, why would there suddenly be a Super Mage out of nowhere?

“That guy isn’t a Super Mage, even though the spell he cast looks extremely similar to one. A real Super Spell would have destroyed the entire Dragon Fangs Dueling Ground and the magic barrier, too. Its damage is a lot weaker than a Super Spell!” Feng Li said confidently.

“But even if it isn’t as strong as a real Super Spell, how was he able to cast it?” The others were dumbfounded.

It was unbelievable that an Advanced Mage was able to cast a Super Spell!

On top of that, almost everyone had placed their attention on Frank. To their surprise, Pinole, who had been quiet until now, had almost wiped out the entire Chinese team with a single move!

Was he the true ace of the Spanish team?

“I believe it has something to do with his innate talent... after casting the spell, he’s no longer able to stand properly, and his face is extremely pale. It seems like he has paid a great price too!” Feng Li said with a sharp gaze.

“But still, whoever has his innate talent is pretty much unbeatable!”

—

Up on the stage, the Chinese team was nowhere to be seen. It was likely that they had been knocked deeper into the water by the fierce tide.

“Jiang Shaoxu of the Chinese team is disqualified!”

“Zu Jiming of the Chinese team is disqualified!”

Two assistant judges declared simultaneously as Jiang Shaoxu and Zu Jiming were retrieved from the water, and were being treated outside the stage.

The two of them had fainted after being struck by the Catastrophe Wave.

“This is bad, two of our members have been knocked out!”

“How about the others, are they fine?”

In the Chinese team’s resting area, everyone totally panicked as they did not expect anything like this to happen. Regardless if the Catastrophe Wave was actually a Super Spell, it still placed their team in a bad spot!

—

A figure leapt out of the fierce current.

A broken rock strangely surfaced on the water and floated on it. The man that jumped out from the water landed on the rock and stabilized himself.

A strong heat burst out of his body and instantly turned the water covering him into white steam. The water was thoroughly evaporated by the heat.

Mo Fan was able to dry himself easily, yet his ribs, elbows, and hip were damaged. He was only able to stand because of the sturdiness granted him by the Demon Element!
