Constant growth after eating! Isn’t the efficiency a little ridiculous?

‘The Sharkman Beast Infant was angry just a moment ago after the Dark Iron Sharkman knocked it to the ground, but it was now in a great mood after eating the creature.

It was able to swim around in the air, emitting ripples that gradually dissipated as it did so.

Zhao Manyan looked at the remains of the Lance Spine Bear and rubbed his nose. “Perhaps the smell of blood has attracted the Sharkman here. I should leave this place now.”

Zhao Manyan left the street, and the Sharkman Beast Infant followed him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

‘The Sharkman Beast Infant suddenly let out a strange noise as it opened its mouth. It felt like something was vibrating at a high frequency in its throat, like a device transmitting a signal.

Zhao Manyan had no idea what the creature was doing. He recalled its reckless behavior a moment ago and scolded, “You are just a baby. Don’t just rush at everything you see. You should estimate your enemy’s strength first. Do you understand?”

‘The creature acted like it understood Zhao Manyan’s words. It clapped with its fins in response.

“Speaking of which, those Sharkmen are everywhere. Why don’t you go take a nap in the Contract Ring? The outside world is a lot more dangerous than you think,” Zhao Manyan said.

The reckless creature was going to attract the attention of many sea monsters in the city!

‘The creature placed its fins on its stomach and let out a cry in response to the chiding.

“Holy crap, you still want to eat?”

It’s hungry again!?

It had only been the duration of smoking a cigarette at most. The Dark Iron Sharkman was a Commander-level creature, its meat full of magical energy and calories. Normal Magical Beasts that had just been born would have slept for several days after taking in so many calories, but this thing was hungry

again!

A Sharkman Beast was flying over the buildings. Its body looked like it was made of some metal alloy. The sunlight pouring down on the city suddenly disappeared when it was passing by underneath its huge dark shadow.

‘The infant pointed its fins at the sky with great anticipation on its face.

“What? You want to eat that?” Zhao Manyan’s head hurt.

Was this thing really a Sharkman Beast? Why was it drooling when it saw a Sharkman Beast, instead of feeling a sense of belonging?

How much can it eat? It is actually thinking of eating such an enormous creature!

“Tl see if I can find any Lance Spine Bears or Sharkmen that are on their own,” Zhao Manyan said in return.

‘The creature insisted on not going into the Ring until it was fed. Zhao Manyan did not have a choice. He could only find a way to fill the creature’s stomach!

What kind of creature is this?

Ahuman figure was reflected on the river underneath a bridge.

‘The man was extremely skinny, and had a yellow face. He was eating a pack of moldy jerky. The look in his eyes was no longer that of a normal human. It belonged to the filthy creatures from the sewers.

Tap tap!

Clear footsteps were audible on the bridge above him.

‘The man stopped eating and looked up.

An eerie shadow suddenly hung upside-down along the railing of the bridge. It slowly took the shape of a human!

“You… It’s you!” The skinny man was terrified. He almost slipped and fell into the water.

A lot of Sharkmen were patrolling underneath the bridge. He held firmly onto the edge and stared at Mo Fan like he had just seen a ghost.

“Have you seen this man before?” Mo Fan took out a photograph and showed it to the cunning man.

The skinny man was spooked when he saw the smile on Mo Fan’s face. How had he survived?

Any creature that was bleeding would not be able to escape from the Sharkmen’s pursuit, especially when the chase was going to last for at least half an hour. There were countless Sharkmen in the city!

“Tm asking you a question, so you should answer it. Do you understand? I don’t mind feeding scum like you to the fish in the river!” Mo Fan grabbed the man and lifted him up with one hand.

The skinny man’s feet were dangling in the air. Mo Fan slowly extended his hand out beyond the edge.

‘The bridge was extremely high. The fall could easily kill someone, not to mention the sharks that were waiting to be fed in the water. They would instantly tear the man to pieces!

“I did! I’ve seen him before!” the skinny man yelled.

“Where was the last time you saw him?” Mo Fan asked calmly.

Mo Fan had to let the man live for just a little longer so he could complete his quest.

The disciple of the renowned clan must have been caught alive and thrown into the city by the Sharkmen as prey for their hunting game. If the client was confident their target was still alive, Mo Fan just had to ask the man for information. He had obviously met other people and had used them as bait to

save himself.

Even though he had to do it for his own survival, it still did not change the fact that he was an assh***.

‘Mo Fan had never had any compassion for jerks.

Mo Fan was going to let go once he got his answer. Perhaps he might survive if he was a great swimmer.

“Hurry up, I’m running out of patience,” Mo Fan snarled.

The skinny man felt like he was going to suffocate. It was hard to lie in his situation, as his brain was lacking oxygen to think properly.

“Lam… That’s…that’s me!” the man exclaimed desperately.

Mo Fan chuckled.

He loosened his grip and dropped the skinny man into the water. He purposely attached a gravity chain to the man, preventing him from escaping with some strange magic. He wanted to make sure the man would fall into the water!

Mo Fan dusted off his hands. He was about to leave when he remembered something.

“Hang on, even though his face isn’t as chubby as the photo our client showed to us, his facial features…”

As Mo Fan was mumbling to himself, he heard a loud splash below. “Should I give him a chance?”

Mo Fan first thought the guy was lying to him, but he realized the man would definitely look a lot different if he had become so skinny after not eating for so long.

If he really was the guy their client had asked them to save… It would be a great loss for Mo Fan!
