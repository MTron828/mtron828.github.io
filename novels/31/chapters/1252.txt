“I once thought of murdering you and cutting you into pieces, but I need your help,” Yu Shishi replied.

“Hehe, is that what a person asking for a favor should be saying? I have no time to waste on you, just do whatever you want,” Mo Fan patted the Flying Creek Snow Wolf, signaling him to proceed on their way.

“Wait!” Yu Shishi stopped Mo Fan.

“Don’t ever come to me again. I’ll hand you to the Enforcement Union if you annoy me again,” Mo Fan snapped impatiently.

Mo Fan was not in a good mood after the people of the Research Union showed up. He did not care about what would happen to Yu Shishi, nor was he interested in the secret she had that the Research Union was after.

“I’ve been to the land that you bought,” Yu Shishi said.

“You’ve been stalking me?” Mo Fan glared at the woman icily. He had only spared her life because she did not go around killing nnocent people. However, if the woman was trying to harm the people around him, he would not hesitate to eliminate her!

“I just went to see the girl who you mentioned was in a similar situation as I am.” Yu Shishi seemed a little intimidated when she saw the flames rising from Mo Fan’s body. It was the same fire that had destroyed countless numbers of her moths. It felt worse than death!

She had long lost her family. The moths had become her friends, her family, yet Mo Fan had killed almost half of them. She had the urge to tear Mo Fan into pieces, yet she had no choice but to come to Mo Fan for the sake of the remaining moths.

“Oh, you saw her?” Mo Fan withdrew the flames.

“I did,” Yu Shishi said.

“Just tell me what you want, I’m in a hurry here,” Mo Fan snapped.

“I’m trying to run away from the Research Union. They have never treated me as a human. It’s not going to end well if I fall into their hands...” Yu Shishi said.

“You better hide then,” Mo Fan said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I...” Yu Shishi lowered her head. She was obviously stirred up emotionally, “I swear I just want to live peacefully! Why can’t the people of the Research Union just leave me alone? If they didn’t keep forcing me, I wouldn’t kill the people that are weak and troubled by sickness by accident. I admit that I’ve killed people that went missing, but I never wanted to take their lives. I just want to protect myself and the moths. I just want to live, I don’t want to die...”

“You’ve killed some innocent people, whether you meant it or not. It’s your fault that you’ve nowhere to go now,” Mo Fan said.

“I’ve checked your information. You are Mo Fan, the strongest participant in the World College Tournament, the man that saved the Ancient Capital during the calamity. You aren’t afraid of the Magic Association, nor are you afraid of the Research Union...” Yu Shishi went on.

“Forget it, there’s no way I’m helping you,” Mo Fan said decisively.

Yu Shishi looked at Mo Fan. She did not think the man would reject her so mercilessly.

“Then...then why are you willing to keep the Blood Tribe girl with you?” Yu Shishi asked.

“I’ve already said it, I don’t really care what you really are. The truth is, your beautiful looks and stunning figure are bonus points to me... but they aren’t really that important. It’s more about what you’ve done,” Mo Fan explained.

“Don’t you want to know why the Research Union keeps trying to hunt me down? I’ll tell you my secret if you’re willing to help me,” Yu Shishi said.

Mo Fan pondered for a moment. Judging from the Research Union’s eagerness, Yu Shishi’s secret must be very important to them. Otherwise, they would not send a committee member after her, especially since the person was receiving orders directly from the Asia Magic Association.

It must be a serious business if a Magic Association at the international level was involved. Eccentric people had always been rare, yet Yu Shishi was clearly not the only strange kind. The Blood Tribe was also unorthodox. If the Research Union was only interested in weird people, why were they so fond of Yu Shishi, instead of hunting down the Blood Tribe?

According to Yu Shishi, the Research Union had been after her for quite some time...

“Tell me about it,” Mo Fan said.

“Do you remember when we met for the first time, you asked me why I’m not afraid of demon creatures when I’m alone in the wild?” Yu Shishi said.

Mo Fan remembered. He even saw her naked body. It was stunning, especially her huge yet firm breasts. He believed if she had her blue moth wings out, it would add even more charm to her!

“You aren’t afraid because of the moths,” Mo Fan said.

“No, I told you the reason before,” Yu Shishi said.

“Did you?” Mo Fan recalled the encounter and realized something, “You mentioned that the demon creatures don’t attack you because of the fragrance you had?”

Yu Shishi nodded.

“Wait, you were telling the truth?” Mo Fan looked at Yu Shishi in surprise.

“I wasn’t lying,” Yu Shishi answered.

Mo Fan was shocked. He subconsciously went up to Yu Shishi and sniffed. He wanted to know what she would smell like.

Yu Shishi did not think Mo Fan would just come up to her and sniff her. Her eyes flickered with a hint of embarrassment, but considering he was the only person that could help her, she remained still and let the man sniff her instead.

“I didn’t smell anything special; it’s similar to the body fragrance of an ordinary girl,” Mo Fan said.

“Are you expecting it to be a pungent smell? Wouldn’t everyone just treat me like a monster that way!?” Yu Shishi snapped.

“You’re right, but does it really allow you to move freely among the demon creatures? Do they just ignore you?” Mo Fan asked seriously.

“Shall we try it out then?” Yu Shishi said.

“Sure, seeing is believing,” Mo Fan said.

If Yu Shishi was telling the truth about her scent, Mo Fan would believe why the Research Union was so interested in her.

Demon creatures were extremely hostile toward humans. They could tolerate some living creatures passing by their territories, or some other species hunting for food in their territories, but they would never allow a human to set foot in them. It felt like the ‘food’ they had trapped in their cages had come out and was roaming around outside the cages instead. It seemed it was a great humiliation to them!

Many demon creatures had strong senses. Their hearing was able to pick up human footsteps from over a kilometer away. Their sense of smell could sniff out the presence of a human on the other side of a mountain. Their outstanding sight could distinguish the skin of a human more than ten thousand meters away... They had lots of other ways to detect human presences that were even more shocking than the ones mentioned above. These unknown abilities were the main reason why lots of Hunters and soldiers died brutal deaths.

Mo Fan had been to the desert in Tarim Basin himself. The relay station they visited was only in the outer region of the desert. They did not even make it to the middle sector. It clearly showed how difficult it was to explore the territories of demon creatures!

As such, if they could mass produce Yu Shishi’s scent to cover up their human presence, wouldn’t it allow humans to freely enter the demon creatures’ territories?

It was definitely going to be a huge breakthrough for mankind. It easily explained why the people of the Magic Association were so eager to get their hands on her!

——

Mo Fan agreed to bring Yu Shishi to Yueyang Land.

The west of Feiyue Mountain was connected to the Nanling Mountains. It was the territory of the Silver Skyruler, where many demon creatures resided, beyond the White Magic Falcons that ruled over the area.

Mo Fan found one of the species in Nanling Mountains, so Yu Shishi could demonstrate her ability.

“I can move freely in their territory as long as I don’t enter their nest,” Yu Shishi said.

Yu Shishi was walking through the tall brush. She had entered the territory of the Hunter Fang Panther Demons, one of the species posing the greatest threat to Yueyang Land. Their physical finesse allowed them to cross mountains and ridges easily. There had been many Hunter Fang Panther Demons that had accidentally ended up in the Yueyang Land. When they were cleansing the area with the Earth Pistil, they had found a few packs of Hunter Fang Panther Demons hidden in caves. If they had not had the Earth Pistil, they would only have found these Hunter Fang Panther Demons by conducting a thorough search with a huge number of Mages!

A bulky Hunter Fang Panther Demon was half-crawling through the brush. Its huge eyes were staring in Yu Shishi’s direction.

Mo Fan hid in the dark. He was not worried that these low-level demon creatures would sense his presence when he was using the Dark Noble Mantle, as long as he stayed a certain distance away.

Yu Shishi continued forward until she reached the Hunter Fang Panther Demon. Surprisingly, the demon creature was still staring at her...

Mo Fan followed its gaze and discovered two gray-black Hunter Fang Panther Demons in the tall brush. Their bodies were stacked on top of one another under the brush and were rubbing against one another without making any noises!

Mo Fan’s eyes widened!

-Holy crap, the two Hunter Fang Panther Demons are rolling in the bed... rolling in the brush!-

1{TL Note: Rolling in the bed is a slang for having sexual intercourse.}

The bulky Hunter Fang Panther Demon seemed to have discovered that it was wearing a green hat. It immediately unleashed a strong aura. It completely ignored Yu Shishi’s presence!

The bulky Hunter Fang Panther Demon pounced forward and tore at the neck of the Hunter Fang Panther Demon having an affair with its partner, leaving a bloody wound on its neck!

The demon creature twitched vigorously as blood poured out from its neck. The female Hunter Fang Panther Demon rose to its feet when it realized its lover had died...

Mo Fan was utterly dumbfounded by the next scene.

He initially thought the male Hunter Fang Panther Demons were dominant, judging from their greater size. To his surprise, the female Hunter Fang Panther Demons were even more violent. The female Hunter Fang Panther Demon clawed fiercely at the bulky male Hunter Fang Panther Demon instead.

The male Hunter Fang Panther Demon did not dare to fight back. It lowered its head and followed behind the female Hunter Fang Panther Demon, as if it was fawning after her!

“So the females of the species are the dominant ones... these female Hunter Fang Panther Demons are a lot fiercer than the males. The males are submissive, and have to fight one another to mate with the females!” Mo Fan exclaimed.
