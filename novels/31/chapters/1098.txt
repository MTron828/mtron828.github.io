Mo Fan went into seclusion while the organizer was finalizing the ranking of the teams, based on their performance during the treasure hunt.

The round after the treasure hunt would be the finals. The format was fairly simple: the teams would be competing against one another, and the last team standing would be the winner. The top three teams would be given tremendous prizes!

Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue had earned two billion for the team. It was already equivalent to the total earnings of a group consisting of six people, and it did not even include the value of the grand treasure that Mo Fan had found. Otherwise, their earnings would easily match that of an entire national team. Not many students could achieve such a great feat, or possess such remarkable strength!

With their great achievement, the Chinese team was ranked third, just behind England and Germany.

Meanwhile, the American team that was regarded as the first seed was ranked fourth, possibly because one of their main carries, Jack, was unable to deliver as expected.

None of the countries had managed to find the grand treasure of the treasure hunt, either. The different teams were quite relieved after hearing that.

The reason was that the grand treasure usually possessed great value, and if it was the kind that could help a Mage improve tremendously, it would greatly affect the upcoming matches. Many countries were upset that they did not acquire the grand treasure, but they were relieved knowing that no one else had found it, either!

However, they did not expect that someone on the Chinese team had found the grand treasure from thirty-two years ago, and it was even more valuable than the grand treasure of this treasure hunt!

Both Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue had displayed outstanding strength in the treasure hunt. The trio even managed to defeat a group of twelve participants, leaving the whole world in awe. The teams were starting to get nervous, as none of them had expected the Chinese team to have two such incredible talents out of nowhere...

In addition to that, many people also realized that Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue, who were already strong to begin with, had obtained lots of resources from the treasure hunt, meaning that the two would be even stronger in the upcoming finals!

The World College Tournament was in full swing. People across the world were setting their eyes on the specific countries and students they were supporting. Meanwhile, the capital of Greece, Athens was also holding a marvelous election.

The position of the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple had remained empty for a long time. The Parthenon Temple had suffered quite some damage to their reputation after their Healing Magic declined, so they were hoping to elect a new Goddess, loved and respected by the people, to regain the glory that the Parthenon Temple used to have!

The election took place as soon as the treasure hunt of the World College Tournament ended.

It was only the first round of the election. It would choose four Saintesses from the Candidates, based on the support they were receiving. Even though the election of the Parthenon Temple was not open to the public, the devoted followers of the Parthenon Temple were waiting patiently for the result, hoping that the Candidate they supported would emerge victorious, and would receive the votes of the people, too...

The result of the election was announced when the sun was setting in the west. The Saintess with the highest votes was Andi, followed by the relatively aged Panijia. The third Saintess was Asha‚Äôruiya, the disciple of the previous, well-respected Great Muse. However, the whole world was dumbfounded when they learned Ye Xinxia was the fourth Saintess.

Saintess Andi was the Candidate deemed to be the successor for the role of the Goddess. Her reputation had been off the charts in both the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere. The Hall of Knights supporting her had granted her a spacious, holy sky, allowing her to be born in colorful clouds, and to grow under sacred light. Every word, action, and her demeanor clearly implied that she was the best Candidate to take on the role of the Goddess.

However, there were rumors that Saintess Andi did not have a pure, kind heart. The truth was, the biggest factor electing a person to be the Goddess was their wisdom, instead of their overflowing mercy. For example, the previous Goddess, Izisha, was well-known for her righteous and merciless attitude!

Andi was comparable to Izisha in terms of intelligence, and she had earned the full support of the Hall of Knights, implying that she was not just an elegant vase of flowers, but she had full control over the greatest armed force of the Parthenon Temple!

Meanwhile, Panijia had come from an ancient renowned family of Healing Magic. In comparison to Andi‚Äôs imperiousness, Panijia and the faction supporting her were leaning more toward conciliation by reaching out to any faction that was willing to cooperate with the Parthenon Temple.

Panijia had always been busy doing things to win the hearts of people over. The charitable acts done under her name were comparable to all the charities combined across the world, thus Panijia was well-loved by the people...

Asha‚Äôruiya was someone that was loved by the people of Greece since she was born. In their eyes, she was their most sacred little angel, as she was the adopted daughter of the previous Great Muse, Wen Tai.

Wen Tai‚Äôs name was made known to the world around twenty years ago, as he was the only man allowed to enter the Hall of the Goddess of the Parthenon Temple freely, and was the only man in history appointed as the Great Muse of the Hall of the Goddess. Every achievement he had was shocking, and to the world, he was like a god in the form of a man.

The truth was, the people of Greece referred to him as the Holy Saint.

Since Wen Tai‚Äôs death, the followers that had respected and loved him placed all their hopes on the man‚Äôs adopted daughter, Asha‚Äôruiya. The woman was like the most sacred fairy of Greece, and countless people were willing to offer everything for her sake...

She did not try to grab the attention of the people, did not use any trick to win people‚Äôs hearts over, and did not purposely maintain her image, yet she still had a bunch of followers!

Most interestingly, Asha‚Äôruiya had never conducted the initiation, she never attended the classes held by the Hall Mother, and she did not even want to be a Candidate, but the people still pushed her high up. Many people were jealous of the attention she received from her identity as the daughter of the Holy Saint Wen Tai.

It was expected that Asha‚Äôruiya would end up as a Saintess, but the fourth Candidate that was selected was a complete surprise!

Everyone knew that Ye Xinxia had been promoted to an official member of the Hall of the Goddess from a probationary servant not long ago. It was true that she had achieved some impressive feats lately, earning her some reputation, but it was still a far distance away from becoming the fourth Saintess.

And yet, she had won in the first round of the election. The result was simply dumbfounding to the world. Everyone was discussing the background the woman might have, or who the person that was supporting her behind the scenes could be, that she could make it to the top four in the election!

‚Äî

Outside was immersed in a great uproar, and so was the inside of the Hall of the Goddess. Xinxia stayed in her room, looking at the colorful flowers outside her window.

Normally, she would empty her mind by looking at the garden through the window, looking at the butterflies as they flew between the flowers...

However, she was having trouble doing that today.

It was absolutely insane!

The election of the Parthenon Temple was not child‚Äôs play. It greatly mattered to the whole world.

Not many organizations had a reputation that surpassed the Magic Associations of each continent, but the Parthenon Temple had done so.

Xinxia was overwhelmed with joy when she had the chance to enroll in the Parthenon Temple. At least, that was what she thought in the beginning...

However, things did not go the way she wanted; it simply felt like she was in the middle of an absurd dream.

‚ÄúAre you scared?‚Äù a crisp voice came from outside the window.

Xinxia lifted her head slightly and saw a woman so glamorous that she subconsciously held her breath. It would take Xinxia a long time just to master the confidence and calmness the woman was displaying on her face...

‚ÄúAre you... Asha‚Äôruiya?‚Äù Xinxia asked.

Asha‚Äôruiya was the kind of person that everyone would only hear the name of, but never had the chance to meet. She was free and unconstrained by the rules of the Parthenon Temple, and it was Xinxia‚Äôs first time meeting her...

‚ÄúMmm, but you haven‚Äôt answered my question, are you scared?‚Äù Asha‚Äôruiya walked closer to the bed and leaned forward. Her gentle hair fell on the window ledge.

‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Xinxia nodded.

She was actually quite scared. As an insignificant student, she found the utter glory that she had received all of a sudden unbearable. Most terrifyingly, she was utterly clueless about the reason behind it!

Why would she even be selected? The Hall Mother had only promoted her because of a sudden impulse. She even said that it was just a chance for Xinxia to learn from the Candidates, yet she ended up as one of the four Saintesses. In other words, she was only one step away from securing the role of the Goddess!

Xinxia was having a hard time believing it. She never thought she could go this high. She was feeling uncomfortable with the height she was currently at!

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you willing to be a Saintess of the Parthenon Temple? Aren‚Äôt you interested in the role of the Goddess?‚Äù Asha‚Äôruiya asked seriously.

Xinxia shook her head. It was true that she was keen to learn the magical Healing Magic, but apart from fear, she really did not feel anything toward the position she was currently in.

‚ÄúAm...Am I being used like a pawn?‚Äù Xinxia raised her head and asked softly.

Asha‚Äôruiya was startled for a moment, before she smiled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre smarter than I thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the player?‚Äù Xinxia asked seriously.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt my pawn. I just happened to investigate your background, and discovered that you have an elder brother who‚Äôs unrelated to you by blood. He just happened to be the person that I want to beat the crap out of recently,‚Äù Asha‚Äôruiya explained.

‚ÄúDid he get on the wrong side of you?‚Äù Xinxia knew Asha‚Äôruiya was referring to Mo Fan.

‚ÄúHe took advantage of me,‚Äù Asha‚Äôruiya said.

Xinxia dropped her jaw, lost for words for a moment. She was surprised by how straightforward and honest Asha‚Äôruiya was, yet she was also shocked by how bold her brother Mo Fan was, daring to take advantage of Asha‚Äôruiya!

Unlike a fake candidate like her, Asha‚Äôruiya was a real Saintess of the Parthenon Temple, and her followers were enough to raze a country to the ground!
