Zheng Jiahui looked at Mo Fan in disbelief. In his eyes, a good Nebula Tool would only be given to someone strong who had put in a lot of effort. It was incredibly precious. He never thought someone would lend something so precious to him. His eyes stared at Mo Fan for a while, before he shook his head and said, “Don’t play a joke on me, I’m on my way to the training ground for practice.”

“Where is your resolution? You are already ranked last in the Fire School. What’s the point of being so hardworking? You’re a disgrace to the term dunce,” said Mo Fan.

“If I don’t work hard enough, I won’t have any chance to defeat the people ranked higher than me,” said Zheng Jiahui with a stern look.

“I’ll make it clear, your problem is not because of your cultivation. What you lack are resources. Everyone is the same when they first enrolled into Pearl Institute. We are all Intermediate Magicians. If you really want to compare, the difference between those ranked after a thousandth is negligible. I’m sure that you’re only ranked last because you completely forgot how to cast your Spell in a duel.”

“Why do you know that?” asked Zheng Jiahui.

Mo Fan had no intention to waste his time anymore with this Zheng Jiahui. He took out the Nebula Tool given to the hundredth rank student and shoved it into Zheng Jiahui’s hands.

Zheng Jiahui stared at the Nebula Tool for quite a while. He could not understand why someone would give their Nebula Tool to someone else.

Time gradually passed. The challenge week had arrived. The people of the Fire School were rubbing their palms, as they could not wait to teach the asshole who scolded them a lesson.

The students of the Fire School had all gathered in the main hall. They would glance in Mo Fan’s direction at times. As a matter of fact, they were quite surprised when they saw Mo Fan in the hall. Was he really not afraid of being targeted by everyone? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Mo Fan was seated at the same spot behind Huang Xingli and Ding Yuming. Unfortunately, he still did not have the chance to look at the appearance of the Fire School’s goddess.

Huang Xingli turned around with a surprised look and said, “Are you really so tired of living? Today is the first day of the challenge week. Anyone who is ranked lower than you will challenge you to a duel for sure, and you have no choice but to accept them, unless you’re willing to hand over your resources. Many people have set their eyes on your resources. Are you out of your mind?”

“It’s only our second time meeting one another. You don’t have to be so concerned about me,” teased Mo Fan.

“Psycho!” Huang Xingli turned her head around.

Wei Rong stood on the stage as usual. He managed to find Mo Fan among the crowd fairly quickly. He was wearing a grin. He could not wait to see how smug the kid would be today.

“I have the list of names for the challenges that were sent out over the week. They are effective as long as the duels are taking place on the ring here. I believe everyone is well aware of the rules, so I won’t be saying much. Let’s begin,” said Wei Rong.

Every month, the people ranked fairly high on the leaderboard would purposely initiate conflict with one another, to attract a crowd to their duel. The only way for the disciples of the renowned clans to increase their reputation was through endless challenges.

Unfortunately, those who were planning to use the challenges to increase their ranking and reputation at the same time had miscalculated, as Mo Fan had taken all the limelight for himself.

The dueling ground Mo Fan was at was fully crowded with people. In order to let everyone witness his outstanding capabilities, the Elemental Director had specifically chosen a place with a capacity of over a thousand people.

With that in mind, the place was almost fully seated with people. The students from the Fire School had taken half the spots, while the rest were taken by the students from the other Elements.

Wei Rong stood at the spot for the judge. He was here solely to see how his students would beat the crap out of the disdainful kid. Crushing a student’s arrogant pride was something that Wei Rong had done a lot in the school.

“I’ll be hosting the challenges today,” Wei Rong took out the list of names and quickly scanned the lines as he continued, “The hundredth rank student, Mo Fan, two hundred and thirty-one people have challenged you this week. Kid, if you come up to me and apologize, write a repentance letter and apologize to everyone from the Fire School, I’ll let you go, considering you’ve just transferred here.”

“I won’t need it,” said Mo Fan with a firm attitude.

“Fine, first challenger, Zhang Youhe, ranked seven hundred and thirty-sixth!” Wei Rong knew that Mo Fan would not accept his condition.

Following his call, a man with a slightly slanted nose stepped forward from the preparation area. He was wearing a bright smile, whose gaze was scanning the surroundings, as if he was telling the crowd that he was the luckiest person at this moment.

The dueling ground was almost the size of a soccer field. It was also covered in green grass.

“Do you have any idea how many people are jealous of you? We’ve fought so hard just to get more resources, yet you’ve gotten them by pulling a trick with words. Unfortunately, the resources you acquired every month can be taken away when you lose the duels. Now, hand over the resources that do not belong to you. You might be able to save yourself some healing fees,” said Zhang Youhe.

Wei Rong glanced at the two students on the dueling ground and said, “Mo Fan, for your information, Zhang Youhe, who’s ranked seven hundred and thirty-sixth, might be one of the trashy students you mentioned before. If you can’t even beat him, then you will accept my conditions, or leave the Fire School yourself. I’ll admit that there might be some trash in my Fire School, but it doesn’t welcome a student who’s both useless and shameless at the same time, like you.”

Mo Fan turned toward Wei Rong who was provoking him with a smile, “Mr. Wei, isn’t it too early to say those words?”

Wei Rong responded with a cold smirk.

Mo Fan shifted his focus back to his opponent, Zhang Youhe.

His opponent was ranked seven hundred and thirty-sixth, so he should not be too much of a problem to deal with.

“Wei Rong, what’s the point of being sulky with a student? Not only did you place him at the hundredth rank, but you also spread the news across the whole school, so everyone would just challenge him on the same day. Don’t you think that even those ranked in the top one hundred would have troubles preserving their energy?” said the teacher of the Fire School with the white brows, who was in charge of teaching the Materials Class.

“White Brows, you’re going too easy on the students. Every student that managed to enroll into Pearl Institute has some level of pride. Besides, Dean Xiao personally transferred him to the Fire Element. He sure has an unimaginable background... He was used to being fawned upon by everyone around him, and he thinks he’s unmatched because of his abundant resources. If I don’t let him suffer a great fall here, he might die at the hands of the demon beasts because of his attitude,” said Wei Rong, as if he were really concerned for the student.

As a matter of fact, Wei Rong was actually angry at Mo Fan. He was only pretending to be concerned about Mo Fan’s future, just so he had an excuse to teach him a lesson!

How dare he condemn the Fire School and his teaching method in front of the crowd... He was definitely tired of living!
