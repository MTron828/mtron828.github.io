Chapter 3111: The Egyptian Tournament

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Before the official start of the Hunter Tournament, the details could not be revealed. As a major international competition, its level of authority and influence was only second to the World College Tournament.

Lingling had just arrived at the Imperial Capital, and she immediately reported to the Hunter Society. She initially planned to take a stroll in the capital and enjoy the local delicacies. However, before she even had time to quench her thirst, she had to head toward a military airport in the southern mountain.

“Why do we need to head to the military airport? Does the Hunter Tournament have something to do with the military?” Lingling looked at the light green military aircraft in confusion. Based on the model of the military aircraft, it was used for long-distance flight. There were obvious traces of magic patterns because of the Wind Element Magic on its fuselage and wings.

“Everyone, I’ve reported your visas to the Egyptian official. After we arrive at Cairo, we will proceed to Orange Sand Town,” said the military officer to the members of the Hunter Society.

Professor Tong Zhouzheng nodded. He let his students board the aircraft.

Meanwhile, Guan Yao, Jiang Bingming, and the other seniors who were the Hunter Masters of Imperial Capital were also confused. They did not understand what was happening.

“Professor, why are we going to Egypt?” Guan Yao looked puzzled. “It’s understood that the Hunter Tournament would most likely be held overseas, but shouldn’t we at least carry out a domestic selection before advancing to the international stage?

“That’s why I said the situation has changed.” Professor Tong Zhouzheng said.

“If you don’t want to go, you can withdraw now.”

Professor Tong Zhouzhengs toe was harsh. Guan Yao dared not ask more questions.

“Those who go abroad for training can earn a very high graduation bonus point, right?” asked Lingling to a muscular senior who had been exceptionally polite with her.

The senior had a bodybuilder’s physique, but his features made him look gentle. He even spoke softly.

“Indeed. This is a rare chance, so I dont want to miss it. Actually, I’ve been longing to join the Enforcement Union after graduation. However, the Enforcement Union requires a relatively high level of practical combat experience. Moreover, they give their priority to recruiting outstanding and top-tier hunters.” Jiang Bingmings eyes were filled with expectations.

The title of vice president of the student council allowed him to encounter many top-tier magic associations. After Jiang Bingming learned about the

Enforcement Union’s recruitment system, he joined the Hunter Society. If the Hunter Tournament was held in Egypt, it would enhance his resume so that he could obtain favor in the Enforcement Union’s top management’s eyes.

“Well, provided you can come back alive.” After Professor Tong Zhouzheng heard Jiang Bingmings words, he passed by him and blurted out the words casually.

Jiang Bingming froze. Was the trip going to be dangerous?

Egypt recently made the headlines. The country was under double attack from the Undead Empire and the Female Demon Empire. Many cities were affected, including the capital—Cairo.

“The level of danger for the Hunter Tournament has increased by multiple levels. As my students, I’ll do everything I can to ensure your safety. However, we will be in a dangerous country, so I can’t promise that all of us can return unharmed. This matter is urgent, you don’t have much time for consideration.

If you’re not prepared to face death yet, it’s best to withdraw from the tournament right now,” said Professor Tong Zhouzheng solemnly.

The crowd looked at the military aircraft and the military personnel who were quickly carrying the magical resources to the aircraft. They saw some mysterious people, dressed in high-class robes, entering the cabin. The students and graduates realized that the Hunter Tournament was upgraded to a higher level due to some sudden change of circumstances.

Unlike the World College Tournament, hunters were born to die. Hence, the international Hunter Tournament was not a mere competition. Most times, the participants of the tournament had to experience harsh environments and confront groups of powerful demons.

The Hunter Union headquarters originally set the final game of the Hunter Tournament in Egypt. However, there was a sudden change in the situation in Egypt. Thus, the organizers were forced to bring the final game forward, and they invited teams of Hunter Masters from all over the world to a large field competition.

Their courage and determination would be their entry qualification!

There was no place in Egypt that was secure. The place where the light of the underworld was covered had to be both a paradise for the undead and a living hell on Earth!

Sure enough, some people withdrew from the tournament. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There were many juniors and seniors in the Hunter Society. They preferred a lower level of danger for their training.

There were some demonic lands in the country where they dared not to set foot, such as the Undead Kingdom in Egypt. They did not have the confidence to fight the Undead. Fighting them would be no different from a death wish.

Many people withdrew from the tournament. Soon, more than half of the people on the name list opted out.

They only wanted to participate in the preliminary round of the Hunter Tournament. They just wanted to gain some experience from the tournament and did not mind losing to the hunter scientist and professor like Tong Zhouzheng when compared to losing their lives. The level of danger in Egypt had increased to the point where they might lose their lives at any time. Since they lacked the Hunter Master qualification, it would be useless if they insisted on going there.

“Don’t go. This is a great opportunity. After you return from Egypt, your classmates and teachers will look at you with admiration, and you can graduate with a top result. Don’t you want to enroll in a better magic institution?” Jiang Bingming tried to persuade them.

Unfortunately, they didn’t listen to him. They bowed respectfully at Professor Tong Zhouzheng before leaving the military airport and heading back to their “Ivory Tower”.

“There are only a few of us left.” Guan Yao surveyed her surroundings. When she noticed Lingling was still around, she gave her a strange smile. ‘IWVhy don’t you quit? Song He may just want you to widen your horizons, but he didn’t ask you to risk your life with us in Egypt.” “I’m familiar with Egypt,” replied Lingling.

“But we’re not going for tourist attractions…

“Guan Yao, count the number of people, then we’ll depart,” said Tong Zhouzheng briskly.

“Okay, Professor!” Guan Yao answered.

There were only seven members left, including Leng Lingling. Jiang Bingming was also among them. They wanted to accumulate a high credit score for their graduation.

Whether at Pearl Institute or Imperial Capital, outstanding results would serve as a stepping stone for graduates to join a better magic institution. However, the experience gained from the international Hunter Tournament in Egypt was more valuable than just being an outstanding graduate.

The aircraft departed. It was a military aircraft that flew directly to Egypt.

Since the Undead from Egypt and China started a war in the underworld, both China and Egypt were in close contact. Both countries had always set their sights on the movements of the two great Undead Empires..
