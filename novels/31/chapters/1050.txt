“Guan Yu of the Chinese team has been disqualified!”

Following the announcement, the others in the storm saw a poisoned man leaning against the barrier at the boundary of the stage. He was being carried down the stage by the officials so he could be treated by the medical team.

Guan Yu’s body was dark brown, and his muscles were twitching strangely. Even though he was still conscious, he was extremely dissatisfied with the result. He had totally underestimated his opponent’s Poison Element, and fallen carelessly for his trap!

“HAHAHA, that’s for trying to pick on me; serves you right!” Yosuke of the Japanese team burst out laughing.

He was moving slowly in the snow to regroup with the other members. However, the condition of his leg worsened, and he could no longer feel it.

An icy, sharp wind swept at Yosuke’s face. It felt like his skin was going to be sliced open.

Yosuke raised his eyes and stared at the woman standing in the air amid the storm, a pair of brilliant Wind Wings on her back. The wind carrying the snow set off her elegance!

Yosuke squinted, his eyes fixed on the woman. However, he did not seem to be panicking.

He appeared to be very calm. He did not look like someone that had lost feeling in his leg. He did not even bother setting up his defense, as if he was challenging the woman to attack him freely.

Mu Ningxue waved her hand, turning the frost surrounding her into spikes. The spikes immediately sprang at Yosuke, who was having trouble moving.

Yosuke grinned coldly. He summoned a magic shield to protect his vital parts, leaving his limbs exposed!

The spikes stabbed Yosuke’s limbs, as expected. They were basically nailing the man to the ground, but Yosuke burst out laughing like a mad man, instead of showing any pain on his face!

“You’ve lost, HAHAHAHA, you shouldn’t have picked on me!” Yosuke laughed.

Poisonous, dark gray Vengeful Flies flew out of his wounds, beating their buzzing wings rapidly.

The number of Vengeful Flies was even greater than before. They were directly proportional to the damage that the Poison Mage had received. The slightest touch to the person’s skin would start festering immediately.

Guan Yu was disqualified when was unable to escape the Vengeful Flies!

Yosuke was laughing wildly. He believed he could take out two members of the opponent team on his own.

Even though he basically was no longer fit for battle, he was able to cover the mistake that Akira Matsuki had made. He could easily secure the victory for their team!

“Trying to hurt me is simply going to bring shame upon yourself, enjoy the treatment of my poisonous flies!” Yosuke chuckled. He was desperately trying to take Mu Ningxue out, even if it meant he would be disqualified too!

When Mu Ningxue saw the poisonous flies approaching, she tried to freeze them with the Ice Element. However, she quickly discovered that the Vengeful Flies were even scarier than she had imagined. The little bugs did not seem to be scared of an Elemental Spell!

“Immune to elemental attacks?” Mu Ningxue murmured.

The poisonous flies were getting closer. Mu Ningxue realized that these little bugs were fairly tricky to deal with, so she beat her Wind Wings and flew higher.

The Vengeful Flies immediately chased after her. A huge bunch of them was right on her trail. Despite the storm surging across the stage, they were totally unaffected!

Mu Ningxue continued to speed up. She was able to control the wind, and the Wind Wings on her back were still beating. She was as nimble as a fairy in the snow-filled air. Even though the Vengeful Flies were unstoppable, they were unable to catch up to Mu Ningxue for a short period.

Mu Ningxue was well aware of how deadly the poisonous flies were. She gave up on trying to fight them directly and continued to fly in circles in the air.

The poisonous flies were relentless, as if they did not know when to give up, but Mu Ningxue was extremely patient, too. As she was flying around, the frost continued to stack up. The snow on the ground was already three meters high!

Yosuke was nailed to the ground in the snow, still in a frenzy, yet he started to look grim when he saw the woman was not bothering to fight the poisonous flies head-on.

The frost had penetrated his entire body through his wounds and had basically frozen all his blood vessels.

He had lost any feeling of his limbs. His body temperature was falling as a strong hint of drowsiness struck him. He had stopped laughing, and was starting to panic instead!

He could die if his body temperature fell below a certain point. The frost continued to penetrate his body as he was losing blood. Even though the frost was not as deadly as his Poison Element, it would still kill him eventually!

Yosuke wanted to hold on until his Vengeful Flies had taken Mu Ningxue out, just to give his team a glimpse of hope. However, he realized that he could no longer hold on for any longer!

“No, I have to bear it a little longer. She must have used up a lot of her energy. She is slowing down!” Yosuke bit his tongue, trying to keep himself awake.

He was so close to winning. He could not afford to give up now!

“Japanese team’s Yosuke has been disqualified!” a voice suddenly announced.

Before Yosuke realized what was happening, he saw a white figure entering the stage quickly, dragging him out of the snow.

“Let go... let go of me, I can still fight!” Yosuke screamed.

“Humph, you should know better. She has already gone easy on you, yet you still think you can hold on for much longer?” the assistant official replied sternly.

Yosuke glanced at the stage and saw a massive icicle dangling over the spot he was previously laying at. He had not seen it, as the storm was too thick. If it had fallen on him, it would have impaled him straightaway...

No matter how unwilling Yosuke was, he had been disqualified. The truth was, the Vengeful Flies had a time limit, too. Soon, they would turn into puffs of black smoke and dissipate.

Even though the Vengeful Flies were immune to elemental attacks, meaning that any destructive or controlling spells were ineffective against them, they were unable to last for a long time, either!

“Another member has been taken out!”

“The Japanese team is about to lose the match!”

“The snow is already three meters thick. Everyone is basically suffering from it, and they will only be more passive as the match goes on. There is no chance for them to win!”

The scary thing about the Ice Element was when a match went on for a long time, the cold would be strong enough to suppress the opponents. When Mu Ningxue’s Ice Magic was strong enough to apply the pressure of an Intermediate Ice Spell on the opponents every second, how could the Japanese team possibly stand a chance?

—

“We...we’ve lost!” Shou Watani had a grim face. He felt terrible, his eyes filled with snow.

The battle between him and Ai Jiangtu had not ended, but he knew it was meaningless for them to fight any longer. The frost was already as strong as an Intermediate Spell. If it was only a single Intermediate Spell, they could easily disregard it, but the frost was continuously hurting them!. It was the same as a team of Ice Mages constantly blasting them with Intermediate Spells.

The main judge soon declared the result. “The winner is... the Chinese team!”

——

As soon as the match came to an end, Mu Ningxue withdrew her Nirvana Ice Domain. The wind and snow immediately came to a stop.

Initially, the spectator seats were around three meters higher than the stage, but now, due to the snow that had stacked up, the stage was the same height as the spectator seats. The crowd was dazzled when they took a closer look at the stage as the storm cleared up!

A huge uproar rose in the stadium. It was always exhilarating to watch such an awesome magic battle!

No one could possibly forget the young woman that had totally crushed her opponents in the opening match. The charm of her icy imperial aura were unforgettable!

——

“We’ve won!”

“Well done, I didn’t think we could beat the crap out of the Japanese team so easily!”

The other members immediately went to congratulate their teammates. Some of the medical staff started treating the injured members, too.

It felt good watching the one-sided victory. Even Pang Lai, Han Ji, and a few other old Mages did not expect they could defeat the Japanese team so easily.

“Well done! You were once disqualified from the team, but now, you’ve fought your way back, and shone the brightest in the opening match. You’ve been literally reborn !” Feng Li did not hesitate to compliment Mu Ningxue.

Mu Ningxue’s performance was absolutely shocking, turning the match that they were feeling anxious about into a one-sided victory. It was likely that the Japanese team had tried their best to collect information about the Chinese team, yet they never expected Mu Ningxue, who had kept a low-profile, to be so powerful. She even took all the attention away from Ai Jiangtu!

“Once disqualified?” Pang Lai was startled, before putting on an amused smile.

The others would have forgotten about it if Feng Li had not mentioned it. Mu Ningxue had been disqualified after the East Maritime Fortress, as she was unable to achieve the Advanced Level in time.

Now, after returning to the national team, not only was her cultivation level on par with the others, it turned out that she had totally surpassed them in strength. Even Shou Watani of the Japanese team would not find himself in an advantageous position if he fought Mu Ningxue in her Ice Domain!

“It must be those pieces she took!” Mu Tingying almost broke her teeth from clenching them too hard!

“She refined all the pieces, and her cultivation improved dramatically,” Nanrong Ni agreed grimly.

Mu Ningxue had taken away the remaining pieces of the Ice Crystal Bow and refined them all when she disappeared from the team. It was the reason why she had improved so much, and why her Domain had become so powerful!

The two women simply had the urge to slap themselves in the face. They had tried to crush Mu Ningxue by taking away her Ice Crystal Bow, but now, she had been totally reborn, and her Ice Magic was stronger than ever!
