The chain that had been swinging around loosely at the domestication ranch suddenly tightened. It had only covered a hundred meters when it was curled up, but it was over four hundred meters long when it was straightened. It tore the trees and rocks along its path into pieces. Wood and rock splinters were fired to the sides. The chain was even producing a loud screech, like a metallic dragon who had suddenly lost its calm!

“What’s going on?” Li Dong and Zhu Min witnessed the chain’s unusual movement when they were going to the other side of the mountain to look for the person who was fending off the Manta Ray Evil Birds.

Luckily, they had not stood too close to the chain. Otherwise, its force would have broken their legs easily.

“Not sure, it seems to be tied to something in the valley.” Zhu Min followed the chain and noticed one end of the chain was extending deep in the valley.

“Let’s not worry about it for now. We should stick to the chief’s orders,” Li Dong said.

Zhu Min nodded.

The two were just about to jump over the misbehaving chain when it suddenly cracked loudly. The chain had snapped in half somewhere between the mountain and the valley. Countless shards went flying and left holes peppering the mountain walls.

Zhu Min was very unlucky, as the front of the chain suddenly swung in his direction after it snapped in half. The chain struck him like the tail of a snake, moving at the speed of lightning. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zhu Min’s eyes widened. The chain dealt a ferocious blow to his chest and his stomach before he could react. He spun crazily in the air as he was sent flying!

Zhu Min slammed into a stone wall with a loud bang. His body almost sank into the stone. Li Dong’s mind went blank as he remained frozen to the spot. He ran to Zhu Min with a shocked expression when he finally collected his thoughts after some time.

Blood splattered across the ground. Zhu Min, whose body was now stuck in the rock, had completely lost consciousness. His entire chest had collapsed, as if it was no longer supported by his ribs. His body was badly bent out of shape. Fresh blood was pouring out of his eyes, nose, and ears. Li Dong could not believe how terrible Zhu Min looked!

“Zhu Min, Zhu Min, wake up!”

Li Dong was terrified. Did Zhu Min really die from the whiplashing chain? How was he supposed to explain his death to Chief Zhu Qi?

Your son was killed by a chain... I saw it with my own eyes.

Li Dong believed he would also die if he told the chief about it.

Li Dong felt his scalp going numb. A hint of anger rose within him when he looked at Zhu Min’s miserable appearance again. Such a pampered son! Wasn’t he an Advanced Mage? How could he possibly fail to dodge the chain? He would not have died so easily if he at least Cast a Basic Spell or used some Equipment to defend himself. Only Mages who lacked practical experience would fail to react in time and die such a miserable death!

The chain had broken. Its other end was dragged deep into the cave at the bottom of the valley by the Manta Ray Bird Emperor. It proceeded to sink to the bottom of the ocean.

The three Soul-grade Flames were significantly weaker now that Mo Fan was surrounded by water. He was even having trouble maintaining his own body temperature. When the Bird Emperor was diving to the bottom of the ocean, Mo Fan was relieved when he recalled the Bird Emperor was bound by a chain. It would eventually reach its limit, but when he realized the chain had snapped in half, he could not help but feel like he was being dragged into Hell instead!

“Brother, you won, you’re the winner, let me go now!”

Mo Fan was now extremely helpless. He initially wanted to subdue the Bird Emperor with his plan, but not only did he help the Bird Emperor break free from the chain that had tied it down for twenty years, it had even brought him to the bottom of the ocean.

It was obvious that Dawn Island was different from the other islands with a solid bottom. Most islands were similar to a mountain, with half of their bodies immersed in water. The part above the water was referred to an island, but Dawn Island was different. There was only an irregular pillar under the water below it, like a house being supported by a single pillar at the edge of a cliff.

The Bird Emperor was amphibious. The cave connected to the sea below the island was located close to the Sky Coconut Grove. However, the Manta Ray Bird Emperor’s movement was restricted by the chain, so it could only reach a certain depth in the cave. However, it was now like a fish that had broken free from the hook of a fishing rod and jumped back into the water to enjoy its freedom!

Mo Fan was a non-swimmer. He was not going to suffocate in the water, but his strength would greatly weaken if he was underwater for too long. Meanwhile, the Bird Emperor was as good at fighting in the water as it was in the sky. How was Mo Fan supposed to beat the Bird Emperor?

Therefore, begging for mercy was the best option he had. It was merely a misunderstanding... it was a misunderstanding... just a misunderstanding!

“Mm? Why am I smelling blood? Am I injured?” Mo Fan suddenly noticed a strong smell of blood from the seawater while he was at a loss. He quickly checked his body, but did not notice any wounds apart from the one on his shoulder, and the internal injuries he had suffered from the impact of the ferocious wave.

Mo Fan used the Shadow Element to look around carefully and realized the blood was from the Bird Emperor’s belly. It was leaking like a huge bucket of red paint was being spilled into the water.

“It’s injured?” Mo Fan murmured.

Mo Fan did not dare let go of the Manta Ray Bird Emperor. If he did not stay on its back in its blind spot, the Manta Ray Bird Emperor could easily kill him in the water. He might still have a chance to return to safety by hanging onto its back.

However, the Bird Emperor did not seem to have any strong intention to shake him off. Its speed began to slow down. It was slowly falling to the bottom of the sea now, like a leaf drifting in the wind.

Its wild temperament, fierce aura, and vitality had dropped significantly. Mo Fan immediately used the Shadow Element to observe the other side of the creature as he realized something.

Mo Fan gasped after the glance. He almost swallowed a mouthful of seawater because of it.

He saw a terrifying wound under the creature. The Bird Emperor might look like a ray, but most of its organs were still located at the center of its body still. However, the skin and flesh under its belly were completely torn apart. The wound already reached its organs, from whence its blood kept pouring out.

“The chain was hooked onto your organs?!” Mo Fan exclaimed.

The creature was abusing Mo Fan’s spells to increase its diving speed just to break free from the chain, but the chain was actually hooked to its body, its bones, and its organs. It was clearly suicidal!

It explained why the Bird Emperor had lost its aggression ever since it had dove into the sea. It had basically risked its own life just to break free from the chain!
