The deathlight of the Pyramid of Khafre was ocean blue. It would dye the white moon blue every night to remind humanity that it was going to be a dangerous night for them!

The Pyramid of Khafre was very close to the Great Pyramid of Giza. It was the Pyramid of Khafre that had declared war against Cairo, hence the Pyramid of Khafre was the source of the deathlight.

As the war between the Pyramid of Khafre and Cairo entered its third phase, and the Pyramid of Khafre’s deathlight was shining across the sky, a brighter deathlight suddenly appeared and rose into the clouds. People over a hundred kilometers away could still see it clearly.

The light acted like an ancient decree. It awakened some special stars in deep slumber in the night sky. The stars flared brightly, making them visible to the people in Cairo.

More ancient stars woke up in the night sky. They seemed to be tightly bound together, as if they were part of an unknown constellation. When the stars related to the Great Pyramid of Khufu lit up, the deathlight soaring into the sky suddenly turned the red of a setting sun!

The red light of a setting sun immediately filled up the sky. It would be a breathtaking sight if it happened in the evening, but it was now happening in the middle of the night. It felt like the eerie red was heralding some kind of evil power, signifying that Ragnarok was descending upon their world!

“My god, did you see that?” a Commander at the front line lifted his gaze and stared at the sky in disbelief.

“Of...of course I see it... it looks like a lake of blood! Commander, does this mean we aren’t going to make it back alive?” a soldier asked.

The unusual sight was inflicting the fear of the unknown on the people. They were aware of the existence of the deathlight, which was said to be like oxygen for the Underworld creatures, but what about this setting sun deathlight? Was it a sign that something scarier was about to show up?

The army had suffered great losses from the war. It was only in the third phase, but many people were already losing their will to fight, and the worst had yet to come. The dead were soon going to rise in the fourth phase. If they were already struggling in the third phase, wouldn’t that mean half of Cairo was going to fall in the fourth phase?

Over the past few months, the war had worsened beyond what they had imagined. The undead were reckless with their invasion. The army did not have enough men to fend off the attacks.

In the past, other countries were willing to lend Cairo a hand whenever it was being invaded by the undead. Even though most of the people were Hunters that came to earn some quick money, students who came for training, or an army of volunteers, they still played an important role in fending off the undead.

Unfortunately, since the sea level had started to rise, most of the powerful nations along the coastline were struggling to deal with the invasion of sea monsters, let alone send their people away to lend other countries a hand!

The lack of help from the other countries did matter, in the end!

The higher the casualties in the third phase, the scarier the fourth phase was going to be. The people of Cairo were already overwhelmed by fear. The government and army insisted that they could still fend off the undead, but not many people believed them anymore!

——

“Damn it, when are they going to open the gates!? Do they really want us to die here!? I don’t want to be eaten by the undead. Open the gates now!” a merchant yelled angrily.

The merchant was the same guy that had come to the city with Mo Fan and the others. He had boldly come to the battlefield to earn some money, yet he was the first to complain when his life was in danger.

“You can’t leave now. Cairo is safe, but if we open the gates, it’s going to attract the undead to us. The undead are constantly tracking the scent of the living. We are doing this for your safety. Don’t make it worse than it already is!” a soldier on duty answered him.

The gates were crowded with people planning to leave the city on their own.

It was no use concealing the truth. Commander Ethan had strictly forbidden the soldiers from leaking any information to the people, but the soldiers who were well aware of the situation could not help but warn their families.

Both the government and the army did not expect this, but they could not afford to open the gates. If the people started running away, not only would it put the city in danger, the people that ran away would be feeding themselves to the undead!

The city had to stay on lockdown, or there would only be more deaths. It was the most rational approach under the circumstances, but it was very difficult to pacify the crowd and ask them to remain calm!

“Cairo has been in similar situations before. In fact, it was much worse in the past. Please have faith in the government and the army. We will protect the people. The city is our support. The army can only hold its ground if the city is in order. Please don’t listen to the rumors. Khafre’s undead will never set foot into our city!” Saks told the crowd.

Ethan had assigned Saks to maintain the order in the city. It was not an easy job. Saks knew that Ethan had done so to punish him.

Saks’ speech was not effective at all. The streets were still crowded with the people that insisted on running away from the city.

“I seriously want to get rid of these idiots with the Slaughtering Wind Slash. Our men are risking their lives at the front line to protect them, yet they are still trying to stir up trouble here...” Saks’s expression sank after he was done with the speech.

Sometimes, Saks wondered why they had to protect these selfish weaklings. They kept arguing they had the right to make their own decisions, despite being utterly useless. If they knew better, why didn’t they fight the undead, instead of asking the army and government for protection?

“Captain Saks, look... where Gisele is,” a lieutenant with a shocked face blurted out.

“What is it this time!?” Saks turned around. He could easily see the night sky, as he was standing on the high ground. He was stunned when he saw the red sky.

What was that?

The deathlight?

Since when was the deathlight as red as dusk!?

Was it from the Great Pyramid of Giza... judging from the angle and direction it was coming from, it was most likely from the Great Pyramid of Giza, but why would it suddenly emit such a shocking deathlight!?

“Captain Saks, what the hell is that?” the lieutenant asked in a trembling voice.

“How would I know!?” Saks snapped.

The streets were soon filled with screams. The situation went out of control once again. The noise was driving Saks mad.

“We are screwed, it’s the end, it’s the light of the apocalypse, it’s a sign that our city is about to face destruction!”

“Is it blood? Is it dyeing the sky with blood?”

“Respectable Pharaohs, please show some mercy to your arrogant descendants, please recall your army of undead!”

“Gods help us!”

The city descended into chaos when the rare phenomenon occurred. More people were demanding the gates open up. The army and government had to use magic to stop the crowd’s tantrum.

It was surely going to ruin the government’s reputation. They might be able to calm the crowd for now, but they had no idea what the people were going to do next!

——

The Square Tower...

Fenna and Haken stood in front of the window. They could see the light soaring into the sky before heading towards the Red Sea.

“Did...did they actually do it?” Haken’s face was filled with excitement.

The third phase of the war was tougher than they had imagined. Even Haken could not predict what was going to happen next. The light of the setting sun was like a glimpse of hope for him!

“It’s from the Great Pyramid of Khufu, but why is it red?” Fenna said.

“It’s because that’s the real deathlight! That’s its original color in the Dark Plane. Khufu only stole it to produce the air that the undead could breathe in!” Haken said confidently. He was brimming with excitement as he added, “It’s been so long, I thought they had joined the rest of the burial objects that were offered to Khufu... who would have thought, who would have thought! Fenna, thank you so much, you recommended such a reliable young man to me!”

Fenna was overjoyed too, but she had a lot more on her mind. She said, “Commander, we are now at war with the Pyramid of Khafre. Even if they successfully manipulated the Great Pyramid of Giza’s deathlight, is it enough to stop the war?”

They were not being attacked by the entire army of the undead. This war was only between Cairo and the Pyramid of Khafre.

Since Cairo was Egypt’s capital, if Cairo lost the war, it would affect the whole country. Even if they could find a way to fend off the undead in the end, they would still suffer great losses!

“There’s only one Underworld. Do you think the Pyramid of Khafre won’t be affected once the door to the Underworld opens?” Commander Haken said.

“So that means if we hurry up and guide China’s undead into the Underworld, it will lift the pressure from our shoulders?” Fenna smiled as she understood.

“Exactly! The teeth are going to feel the cold without the lips. If the Great Pyramid of Giza is under attack by China’s undead, there’s no way Khafre is going to ignore it. God bless Cairo!” Haken placed his hand on his chest.

“Commander, God isn’t the one blessing us...” Fenna said.

Haken was stunned for a moment, but he soon came to a realization.

Yeah, did God have anything to do with it?

He initially thought it was a ridiculous idea. He did not have much hope in it, even though he agreed to it, but to his surprise... that young man was seriously Cairo’s savior! Even though he was only doing it to prevent the undead of his country from stirring up trouble, he still managed to bring a long-awaited peace to the Egyptians...
