Mo Jiaxin only talked about trivial things. Xinxia sat there, listened, and eventually fell asleep.

In the dream, the trivial things Mo Jiaxing said formed her complete childhood, and Xinxia experienced it over again even though she had no memory of it. It was like being trapped in a repeated memory that was lost.

When she was awakened by a large swath of blood rushing toward her face, it was already morning. She saw the mountains and the forests. She heard the sounds of birds coming from afar.

“Are you awake?”

“Yes.”

“Tea?”

“Okay.”

She felt groggy. She accidentally fell asleep, but it felt like she had lived through years of her life. When she tried to recall the things that happened in the dream in detail, she could not remember anything at all.

The sky had brightened by the time she washed up. When the sun was just rising, she received news that the Tulce family was about to announce their support.

“Your Highness, among the members of the Parthenon Temple, only people from the Tulce family are still hesitant. The eldest son of the Tulce family has a grudge against you, so I think he will hinder your victory,” said Fiona, a maid who was always by Xinxia’s side.

“Go and call Jerome and Tulce,” said Xinxia.

“Call them? I’m afraid they have joined forces with Izisha,” said Fiona.

“Tell Tulce I want to chat with him about the Mountain City Titan,” said Xinxia.

“Will he agree to come?”

“He will.”

...

Xinxia did not have much appetite for breakfast, so she only drank some grape juice and tidied up her makeup. She looked at herself in the mirror. When she looked at her reflection for a long time, she felt as though the person staring back was not really her. The person in the mirror had her thoughts but showed a different expression.

Everyone in the mirror was like this. Their faces would slowly distort if stared at for long.

“Tulce and Jerome are here.” Fiona ran over hurriedly.

“Let them wait.” Xinxia took a pen out and wrote a letter. Then, she sealed it with letter oil and cast a small spell to prevent anyone from prying.

“Who is this letter for?” Fiona asked.

“Send it to Lady Karolina,” said Xinxia.

“With Magic Door?”

“Yes.”

“Your Highness, I just remembered that the Grand Holy Altar Master of the St. Kai’s Altar, Jonne, will come to visit this morning. They informed us three days ago. At noon, Haylon, the Lord of the Hall of Knights, will hold an Apollo’s Attention Ceremony for all the Golden Knights. You will also need to attend the ceremony and…” Fiona wanted to report today’s itinerary in one go.

“We will discuss the plans in the afternoon after the Apollo’s Attention Ceremony,” said Xinxia.

“Okay. It will be another busy day. Your Highness, I roughly calculated the time where you can take a break. Ten minutes on the plane. You have to go to the southernmost part of Greece in the afternoon. People hope to see you at Greenbud City’s memorial ceremony, no matter how late it is.” Fiona told her about the afternoon’s itinerary.

Xinxia ignored her. Fiona was always talkative.

“Tulce and Jerome are still in the hall. They are a little impatient.” Tata walked in when she saw that Ye Xinxia still had no intention of going out to talk to them anytime soon.

The Tulce family was an ancient family of the Parthenon Temple. Their support was crucial. The situation was clear now. Ye Xinxia and Izisha had almost the same amount of support. The Tulce family was vacillating. Their loyalty was related to an important war in Greece, namely, the battle of Titans.

Like the Undead in Egypt, Greece had destructive Tyrant Titans. They were ancient gods abandoned by the Greeks. With a heart of hatred for Greece, they often appeared as ghosts. If they appeared in urban areas, it would mean unfathomable consequences.

The threat of the Titans could be greatly reduced by whomever the Tulce family was willing to support. The goddesses did not want to be scolded for pleasing the world and not solving the problems of their country.

Any saintess who became the goddess needed the loyalty of the Tulce family. Tata was very anxious and justifiably so.

After calling two key figures from the Tulce family here, Xinxia ignored them. Today should be Xinxia’s last chance. If she could not get an accurate answer from the Tulce family, then there was a high probability that the Tulce family would support Izisha.

Once many city-states in Greece knew that the Tulce family supported Izisha, they would also follow suit. After all, the Titans were everyone’s fear!

“Hua Lisi?” Xinxia looked around but did not see the familiar female knight.

“Yes, Your Highness?” Hua Lisi walked out of the indoor garden. She was somewhere Xinxia could not see her, but she always watched over Xinxia.

“Tell Haylon that the Apollo’s Attention Ceremony will be held outside the Saintess’ Hall. The weather is good today,” said Xinxia.

“Okay.”

“Your Highness, Tulce and Jerome are leaving.” Tata became even more anxious.

She had to show them some respect anyway. The Tulce family was important to the Parthenon Temple.

“Prepare them lunch and let them follow us to the Greenbud City’s memorial ceremony,” Xinxia said to Fiona.

“I don’t want to keep them here for lunch.” Fiona pouted. She disliked the Tulce family. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I didn’t say we have to have lunch together.” Xinxia winked at Fiona.

Fiona immediately understood. There were so many dining halls, so she could find a remote place for them, preferably out of sight, where they could have their lunch without encountering anyone.

“My little princess, if you neglect them like this, you will drive them to Izisha sooner or later.” Tata was anxious. She could not guess what Xinxia was thinking.

...

The Apollo’s Attention Ceremony began, and all the Golden Knights in the Goddess Peak of the Hall of Knights would attend it. The Fighting Magistrate Norman wore golden emerald armor and led all the Golden Knights. They appeared in front of the Saintess’ Hall.

The front of the hall was spacious and sunny. Every Golden Knight exuded the holy aura as befit those above the Super Level. They stood solemnly in front of Ye Xinxia, Haylon, and Norman.

Haylon was wearing blue-gold holy armor and read aloud the Apollo language of ancient Greek. The sun shone brightly in the sky. After the Lord of the Hall of Knights, Haylon, finished reading, Ye Xinxia held her hands high. She wore a long white dress without any embellishments to dim her graceful figure.

Ye Xinxia seemed to be holding the red sun in her palms. Countless golden lights from the sky pierced through the Goddess Peak of Parthenon Temple like spears, turning the Goddess Peak into a holy palace.

Blessing Element! The power of the invincible Blessing Element!

It was the only magic in the world that could improve people’s cultivation. For the Golden Knights who had advanced to Super Level, the blessing was likely to allow them to awaken more supernatural power.

People who already had supernatural power had a high probability of entering the next stage of cultivation.
