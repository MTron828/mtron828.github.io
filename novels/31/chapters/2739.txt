Chapter 2740: By Means of Torture

Mo Fan vividly remembered the sweet scent even after all these years. Despite the passing of so many years, Mo Fan vividly remembered the inexplicably sweet scent.It was precisely because of this almost dried up thing that the Black Vatican dived into the Pearl Institute and killed Xu Zhaoting! But why would such a thing appear in such a place?

Mo Fan could never be mistaken about this. He was certain that he was right! It was the Underground Holy Spring!

The Underground Holy Spring was the heavenly treasure found in Licheng Afterglow Island’s spiritual land. Mo Fan used to cultivate for a week at the Underground Holy Spring. He had taken away the remaining holy spring essence in order to prevent the people from Black Vaticans from snatching it. In the end, Mo Fan had fed his Little Loach with the remaining essence.

Even if, by some reason, he was wrong, he knew Little Loach would never be mistaken about it. It loved the holy spring essence too much.

How was it that the Underground Holy Spring was the spiritual treasure of Licheng Afterglow Island? The Underground Holy Spring was a protected treasure of the ancient kings. The last Underground Holy Spring had disappeared together with the destruction of Bo City. Why did Licheng Afterglow Island have an identical Underground Holy Spring?

In fact, the Underground Holy Spring at Licheng Afterglow Island was multiple times bigger than Bo City’s. It contained a special warm pool that was rich with essence. If the Underground Holy Spring at the Bo City was considered analogous to a dying elderly man, the one at Licheng Afterglow Island was a giant in its youth!

Could the people from Licheng Afterglow Island be the descendants of ancient kings? Was it their mission to protect the Underground Holy Spring, too?

Mo Fan’s mind was full of questions. He wished he had mastered some sort of psychic technique so that he could summon Zhan Kong’s soul to answer all his queries.

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Suddenly, the closed stone door slowly opened. Someone was about to enter. Mo Fan glared at the anchor-tailed sea lion. The anchor-tailed sea lion looked innocent and na?ve.

They heard someone talking outside.

“Big Sister Feiyan, no one is allowed to cultivate at the sacred pool today. The other junior just left.” said the distant voice of a woman guarding the entrance.

The sound of the footsteps paused at the stone doorway, followed by a voice which Mo Fan recognized.

......

“I just came back from training outside. Seventh Granny allowed me to use the sacred pool. She hoped that I could advance to Super Level soon so that I am well-prepared for unexpected situations in the future.” It was Ruan Feiyan.

Mo Fan turned into a cloud of shadows and hid behind the stone pier.The anchor-tailed sea lion became invisible and blended with the rocks next to it. It stared at Mo Fan warily, as if it was very scared of him.

“Big Sister Feiyan, you’re truly awesome! I’ve not improved much even after so many years. It sure is a thing of envy that that Seventh Granny has chosen you for training outside.” The lady guarding the door said meekly.

“It’s fine. All of us will get a chance. Anyway, there is nothing impressive about the world outside. It’s inferior to Licheng Afterglow Island.” Ruan Feiyan said and walked through the stone door.

The stone door slowly closed behind her. Ruan Feiyan surveyed her surroundings. She then wrinkled her nose as though he could smell something she didn’t like very much.She casually fanned out the previous cultivator’s thick rogue aroma.

“I should work on my strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, that b*tchy Le Nan’s cultivation will soon surpass mine. And Seventh Granny backed her up! She could even become a leader next year! Hmph!” Ruan Feiyan grumbled to herself.

“So, Le Nan is just your toxic friend? I thought the two of you were very close.” Mo Fan’s voice rang out.

Ruan Feiyan’s eyes went wide. For a moment, she thought she was hallucinating. But when she noticed a dark shadow standing before her. The dark shadow was tall and radiated an imposing aura. She lunged at a mechanism next to the stone door.

Mo Fan sneered. He raised his hand and several shadow thorns materialized. It tied Ruan Feiyan within a blink of an eye. Ruan Feiyan’s blue eyes were filled with terror and confusion.

She had never expected him to appear here. How did Mo Fan locate the Licheng Afterglow Island? No one knew the entrance to the island, much less the sacred pool!

There was a mechanism next to the stone door. She was only a step away from it. If she pressed the mechanism, it could alert the grannies. However, she was nailed by hundreds of magical thorns. She could not even move her knuckles.

Shadow element…

‘This kid is an expert in shadow element. He can defeat me easily.’

“Never expected to see me so soon?” said Mo Fan with a radiant smile. “I am usually in the business of taking revenge on those who do me wrong.”

Mo Fan noticed Ruan’s curve especially when she was tied up. ‘Ahem… I’m a robber, not a rapist,’ he reminded himself.

Mo Fan decided to interrogate her here in this perfectly enclosed space where no one could enter. Mo Fan was puzzled by the existence of the Underground Holy Spring in a place like this.

Even Black Vaticans had no idea about any existing Underground Holy Springs…

Were the people from Bo City, Weiju clan from Ancient Capital, and the ladies from Licheng Afterglow Island descendants of the same ancestors?

Certain things seemed to fall into place. No wonder the ladies from Licheng Afterglow Island had such a high level of cultivation. The mages from the Bo City used Underground Holy Spring to improve their level of cultivation by leaps and bounds. They could only provide one spot to an outstanding mage in the city annually due to the depletion of the spring.

But the giant Underground Holy Spring at Licheng Afterglow Island had an unlimited supply of power. According to the anchor-tailed sea lion, people walked in to cultivate all the time for six days, except on the seventh day. There was a huge gap in energy as well as efficiency.

The Underground Holy Spring at Bo City enabled mages from basic-level to advance to intermediate-level. Cultivating in the Underground Holy Spring did not show a drastic effect on intermediate mages.

The Underground Holy Spring at Licheng Afterglow Island, on the other hand, had produced so many ladies with high levels of cultivation. It had even produced a ruler-level demon like the anchor-tailed sea lion. The anchor-tailed sea lion had only sneakingly entered the Underground Holy Spring on certain days at that.

“I’ve some questions to ask you. If you answer me truthfully, I won’t interrogate you by… means of torture,” Mo Fan said with a smile.

Ruan Feiyan was enraged. She had never expected to fall into Mo Fan’s hands like this. She was left up the creek without a paddle in this holy pool. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Swish!

Before Mo Fan even laid his hands on Ruan Feiyan, he heard a loud sucking sound from his chest.
