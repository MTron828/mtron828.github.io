“You son of a b**ch, don’t you touch my wife!” Mo Fan’s thunderous voice came from the sky.

The Light-Curtain Eagle had finally reached the sky above the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. Mo Fan could not bear to watch the creature bully Mu Ningxue. He immediately jumped down from over a thousand meters in the sky!

“Little Flame Belle, what are you waiting for!?” Mo Fan turned around and yelled at Little Flame Belle on the Light-Curtain Eagle as he was falling.

Little Flame Belle was a little slow with her reaction. She followed Mo Fan and dove down from the sky after hearing his cry. She clenched her fists and extended them forward while using her fire to form a little cape behind her...

3Upon seeing that, Mo Fan swore he would never let Little Flame Belle watch those boring animes ever again.

2Mo Fan was already engulfed in bright red flames as he was falling from the sky. Little Flame Belle finally caught up to him when he was around two hundred meters from the ground. She slammed into Mo Fan’s chest together with the flames of her Calamity Fire and Ardent Sunset!

Mo Fan had his own fire, too. As soon as he made contact with Little Flame Belle, the flames were burning so fiercely that it felt like he had turned into a devil from Hell. His aura skyrocketed as the strong flames filled up the sky above the canopy layer!

“You better piss off!”

The flames burning on Mo Fan gradually grew stronger. He was diving right at the Dreadful Curse Cerberus like a meteorite!

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus’s heads were still fighting over the chance of having the first bite when the ‘meteorite’ came down from the sky and knocked the enormous beast flying!

The beast had thick and sturdy skin. It skidded along the ground, gouging out a trail a hundred meters long behind it. However, when the Dreadful Curse Cerberus rose to its feet again after the strong impact, there were only a few minor scratches on it... Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The head with eyes engulfed in orange flames let out a furious cry at Mo Fan.

Mo Fan recognized the head. It was the Dreadful Curse Hellish Hound that had managed to escape previously. He could still see the scar left by his lightning on its head!

“You son of a b**ch, I’m going to chop you into pieces today!” Mo Fan taunted when he sensed the rage and animosity from the beast.

Mu Ningxue felt a lot more at ease knowing that Mo Fan had made it there. She was obviously no match against the Dreadful Curse Cerberus, but things would be different if Mo Fan was here!

“Mo Fan, the beast is pretty strong, be careful,” Mu Ningxue warned him.

They could not afford to make a single mistake when facing the formidable beast. The cunning and dangerous Dreadful Curse Cerberus seemed to be good at discerning the weaknesses of its enemy. It would target those weaknesses relentlessly!

“How is Yu Shishi doing?” Mo Fan asked.

“Not great! She can’t take on Zeng Guanglie on her own,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Don’t worry, I’ve brought a helper with me,” Mo Fan looked into the sky and yelled, “Nighthawk, go ahead and help the woman with wings!”

“Got it, but you have to be careful! The Dreadful Curse Cerberus is very dangerous!” Nighthawk yelled.

“Humph, you were only lucky last time since I hadn’t completed my Hell Forge Ritual. Otherwise, I would have razed your Fanxue Mountain to the ground! Now that you two have walked right into the trap! I’m sorry to say you won’t be able to leave in one piece!” Houndman walked out from the shadows. He jumped onto the Dreadful Curse Cerberus and looked down at them.

His eyes were murderous.

The value of the Totem Beast was unimaginable. Houndman was trying to trade it for resources that would help him achieve the Super Level. There was no way he would let two young Mages ruin his ambition!

“Kill them!” Houndman ordered coldly.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus’ aura skyrocketed. As its aura surged forward, it surprisingly disturbed their mind by inflicting a strong fear on them. It slowed down the channeling of their spells...

Mo Fan frowned as he noticed it, “The creature’s Domain is stronger than ours.”

“Mm, we can’t force a fight with it,” Mu Ningxue had deduced.

Her strength was in suppressing her target with her Ice Magic, but it was not as effective when she was facing an opponent stronger than her magic.

Similarly, Mo Fan mainly relied on the destructiveness of his spells. He was greatly restrained when his spells could no longer break through the defense of the enemy.

“The Dreadful Curse Cerberus might be tricky to fight against, but Houndman isn’t that strong. We should find a chance to take him out,” Mo Fan said.

“The guy is pretty cautious.”

“We’ll find a way...”

Mo Fan let Mu Ningxue cover him as he pretended to be accumulating power to attack the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. However, he suddenly cast Blink, leaving only a ring of fire where he was standing while he moved to the back of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus!

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus raised its claw and swung it at the ring of fire. It swept the dust into the air and cracked the ground. The force was strong, but it did not land on Mo Fan.

Mo Fan was already behind the Dreadful Curse Cerberus, trying to drag Houndman down from the beast...

As soon as Mo Fan cast his Space Magic, the Dreadful Curse Cerberus immediately unleashed its bloody aura, forming a barrier that encapsulated itself and Houndman. The runes covering its body began to glow too!

“So that’s the reason why it wasn’t injured after I hit it!” Mo Fan immediately realized the truth behind the creature’s outstanding defense when he saw the barrier.

The ‘meteorite’ that he and Little Flame Belle had turned into possessed extraordinary force, yet it had only left the Dreadful Curse Cerberus with a few scratches. Even Mo Fan found it hard to believe. He had fought against Commander-level creatures with sturdy defenses before, yet none of them were as agile and powerful as the Dreadful Curse Cerberus. If the beast really had such impressive defense, speed, and strength, wouldn’t it be as strong as a Ruler-level creature?

“It’s not going to work. Just accept your fate!” Houndman chuckled when he realized what Mo Fan was up to.

The Dreadful Curse Cerberus turned around. Its three pairs of eyes flickered coldly!

Mo Fan felt his scalp turning numb the moment the six burning eyes of three different colors stared at him. When he tried to look away, he suddenly realized he was surrounded by a line of the same eyes!

Green, orange, and brown!

The eyes of three different colors showed up on Mo Fan’s left. As he moved in a different direction, he was shocked to see that the eyes were still chasing after him. He clearly felt the savagery of the Dreadful Curse Cerberus hiding in the shadows just by looking at the eyes!
