Mo Fan summoned the little Flame Belle, who had been fairly well-behaved lately, and had stopped acting naughtily. It seemed like she had grown a lot after what happened in the Space of Death.

Little Flame Belle stood on Mo Fan’s shoulder and kissed him on the cheek. She seemed quite excited.

However, when she looked around her and realized that she was surrounded by seawater, she was not happy. As a fire spirit, she hated water the most, especially a vast ocean!

“Try asking the creature if it saw a kid being snatched away recently,” Mo Fan went straight to business without caring about the Little Flame Belle’s feelings.

Little Flame Belle let out a cry and conveyed her thoughts to the creature. Such an ugly beast!

Meanwhile, the Sea Monkey’s eyes glittered in awe when it saw little Flame Belle. Perhaps at their standard, little Flame Belle was like a goddess to them!

Little Flame Belle told Mo Fan there were many kinds of demon creatures. Some able to communicate, while others were beasts that could not talk...

Fortunately, the Sea Monkey belonged to the former, the kind that could communicate!

Soon, under Zhao Manyan’s stern interrogation and little Flame Belle’s goddess-like temperament, the Sea Monkey spilled the beans. Once again, it proved that the Sea Monkey was definitely the most disloyal creature in this world.

Basically, the Sea Monkey was saying, “I saw it, a very annoying guy took the kid away. It’s going to give it to the king. It even boasted about getting a promotion from the king and leaving us all.”

“Ask it if the kid is still alive,” said Mo Fan.

The Sea Monkey squeaked and danced around with gestures, implying that the kid was definitely still alive. Either the Scarlet Soaring Demons or their king would only eat the children alive. Therefore, when the Sea Monkey were bringing the children to them, they had to keep the kids alive at all costs! It even mentioned that there was once an idiot who failed to keep an infant alive. In the end, their king ate a group of Sea Monkeys instead!

Mo Fan was slightly relieved after hearing the Sea Monkey’s explanation. Despite that, he was feeling sorrowful too when he thought about the kids that died...

“Tell it to bring us to its king,” said Mo Fan.

Little Flame Belle spoke to the Sea Monkey, but it immediately cried out to make a stand against it.

Zhao Manyan said to Mo Fan when he saw the creature’s reaction, “I bet it’s too scared to bring us to its king.”

“Little Flame Belle, tell it that we’ve already eliminated the Scarlet Soaring Demons. The Scarlet Rending Demon is the only one left, and it’s only a matter of time until we hunt it down. If the kid is dead, we would not only wipe out the Scarlet Soaring Demons, but the Sea Monkeys too!” said Mo Fan.

In order to intimidate the Sea Monkey, Mo Fan immediately drew a Star Constellation and cast the Advanced Fire Spell at the area ahead! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Sky-Flame Funeral had a powerful visual display. The rain of fireballs set the whole place on fire. The Sea Monkey trembled in fear when it saw the shocking flames! It never thought a human could be so powerful. The rain of fireballs could easily wipe out their whole nest!

“Bring us there, we’ll kill the Scarlet Rending Demon, and you Sea Monkey will move fifty kilometers away from the safe zone. If you stop harassing the fishermen, we’ll spare your lives. Otherwise, we’ll kill you all to avenge the kids!” demanded Mo Fan.

The Sea Monkey were most likely aware that the Scarlet Soaring Demons had been eliminated. If the creature had some level of intelligence, it would know what to do.

The Sea Monkey uttered a cry. It looked like it had agreed.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan let out a relieved sigh...

They did not care too much about sparing the Sea Monkey’s life, but if it insisted on not showing them the way, the boy Xiao Di would be in grave danger...

Luckily, the Sea Monkeys were different from the majority of the demon creatures. It belonged to the kind that would play up to the stronger side.

Mo Fan cast Giant Shadow Spike: Twins on the Sea Monkey. The primary spike had stabbed it through, while the secondary spike was still in his hand.

The power of the Giant Shadow Spike could easily impale a Servant-class creature’s soul. If the Sea Monkey tried to trick them, Mo Fan would not mind firing the secondary spike, which would surely end the creature’s life!

The Sea Monkey was unable to tell directions in the sky. As such, the creature was swimming in the water while Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan followed it from the air.

The Sea Monkey was swimming at remarkable speed. It tried its best to catch up to the Sea Monkey that had kidnapped the kid, since its whole tribe was at stake.

—

They were already over ten kilometers away from the safe zone. There was no sign of any island nearby, water was the only thing they could see in their surroundings.

“Is that thing trying to trick us?” said Zhao Manyan worriedly.

“I don’t think so. Nan Rongni did mention that the Sea Monkey are the kind that simply obey those that are stronger. Most of them will submit to packs of stronger creatures. We’ve eliminated the Scarlet Soaring Demons, so unless they are out of their minds, they would not trick us when their whole pack is at stake... mm? See, there’s something ahead,” said Mo Fan.

Zhao Manyan glanced ahead, yet he failed to see anything.

As they flew further, Zhao Manyan finally saw the reefs exposed above the water. Mo Fan was an Advanced Magician, so his eyesight was a lot better than Zhao Manyan’s.

The Sea Monkey in the water was already crying out.

Little Flame Belle immediately told Mo Fan that it had discovered the creature that kidnapped the child. It was very close to the reefs.

“The kid has almost reached the reefs. Full speed ahead!” Mo Fan exclaimed. He had no idea how many creatures were on the reefs, yet he had no time to hesitate!

“These pricks, I can’t wait to see what these filthy creatures look like! I’m going to chop them into pieces!” Zhao Manyan beat his Wings heavily to maximize his speed. He would be able to fly a lot faster if he was not carrying Mo Fan!..

“There, I see it!” exclaimed Mo Fan in joy.

They happened to see a Sea Monkey reaching the reef just as they did. It was cautiously carrying a little boy who was tied up with seaweed. The kid was crying out loud, as if he knew that he was in danger!

“Thank God!” Zhao Manyan uttered a relieved sigh!

Mo Fan did not wait for Zhao Manyan to dive. He jumped down from the sky and landed on the reef with a murderous aura!
