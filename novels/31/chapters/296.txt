Chapter 297: Epic Battle Against the Giant Spider

Translator: Exodus Tales Editor: Exodus Tales

The Swift Star Wolf had gone back to rest. If he were here, it would be easier for Mo Fan to handle the Bewitching Magic Spider. He had no choice but to rely on himself for now.

Even Warrior-level beasts had disparities in terms of strength. For example, the Cursed Beast, Mother Scale Skin Phantom, and Three-eyed Magic Wolf were considered average among the Warrior-level demon beasts.

On the other hand, the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast was considered Warrior-level too, but its overwhelming strength was not something the group could handle right now. It was considered the strongest existence at the Warrior-level.

As for the Bewitching Magic Spider in front of him, judging from its aura alone, it should be stronger than the three normal Warrior-level demon beasts, but not as terrifying as the Pseudomorphing Demon Beast.

Mo Fan was wearing the Focus necklace, so his mind was safe from being bewitched.

Mu Ningxue was obsessed with killing the beast, thus it would not make a difference if she were being bewitched or not.

Without the bewitching effect, the Warrior-level Bewitching Magic Spider would not be too difficult to deal with. The priority now was to eliminate it as soon as possible, as they did not want the group to end up like the One-eyed Magic Wolves.

The Bewitching Magic Spider flung its front limbs out furiously, slashing forward in a crisscross motion like several sabers.

It was standing thirty meters away from Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. Normally, it would not be able to reach them due to the distance. To their surprise, the Bewitching Magic Spider was not as simple as it looked. The slashes from its limbs turned into two piercing shockwaves, forming a whirling airflow that flew toward Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue!

Mo Fan immediately rolled to the side in a panic, subconsciously tugging his neck down.

He felt a cold breeze above him. He raised his head and saw the wall behind him sliding down from a clean cut!

How sharp were those slashes!?

Mo Fan initially thought a demon beast that was hunting its prey by luring them into traps would not be too strong in combat. Little did he know... the previous slash had almost beheaded him on the spot!

As for Mu Ningxue, she tried to set up a barrier with the Ice Lock, but the sturdy chains were instantly cut in half and dropped to the ground as she lost control of them.

Mu Ningxue’s Ice Lock was instantly nullified. The only move she had left was the Wind Element.

She floated a safer distance away using Wind Track, and began to align a Star Pattern.

Strong wind circulated around her body, slightly lifting her clothes, and revealing her astonishing curves. Her eye-catching silver hair drifted in the wind. The mark on her forehead flickered as her eyes displayed a strong determination to kill. She had thoroughly transformed into an outraged Wind Fairy, whose single attack would result in a disaster of wind!

The Spirit-grade Wind Seed was even more brutal. It had summoned a destructive tornado covering the area within a hundred meters under Mu Ningxue’s control.

The Wind Disc: Sky Snare was cast very quickly. It turned from a random breeze to a magnificent wind wall within a few seconds. The Bewitching Magic Spider was right at the eye of the storm. It let out a sharp shriek and attacked the rapidly contracting wind wall with its claws.

The wind wall converged quickly. The Bewitching Magic Spider struck its limbs deeply into the ground to resist the force of the Wind Disc, which was capable of uprooting a whole building.

The Bewitching Magic Spider’s grip was insanely strong. It was half-crawling on the ground as the Wind Disc: Sky Sky Snare was tearing at its body.

The Wind Disc: Sky Snare lasted the longest among the Intermediate Spells. However, apart from a slight quiver, the Bewitching Magic Spider did not end up being blown into the air.

Mu Ningxue frowned. The creature was way stronger than the normal Warrior-level demon beasts. Most of the Warrior-level beasts would not be able to survive the destructive force of a second-tier Wind Magic, which was further enhanced with a Spirit-grade Soul Seed.

“Mo Fan, your turn!” Mu Ningxue said to Mo Fan, aware that her attack was not strong enough.

“Keep it busy. I believe it is very quick too!” Mo Fan replied.

“Mm!”

The Wind Element had a huge area of effect. It was not as direct as the Fire and Lightning Element. The perfectly unharmed Bewitching Magic Spider served as a convincing proof to the statement.

“Rose Flame Fiery Fist: Groundbreak!”

Mo Fan cast his strongest move straight away. He accumulated the power of the Fire Element to his limit, before throwing the fiery punch at his target.

The burning roses of death blossomed on the Bewitching Magic Spider’s location. The shocking blaze rapidly devoured the entire area as pillars of lava jetted from the ground!

Groundbreak was also a destructive spell with a huge area of effect. Unfortunately, it was too easy to tell where it was coming from, as the energy would surge out from the ground before it took place. The Bewitching Magic Spider had extremely sharp senses. It immediately crouched when it felt a strong heat coming from the ground below.

The moment the Groundbreak burst out, the Bewitching Magic Spider leapt over ten meters into the air.

It was hard to imagine a bulky creature like that having such an incredible jumping ability. Only a tiny amount of lava from the Groundbreak was spilled onto its hairy body, which could not even trigger an itch.

“You have to freeze it!” Mo Fan immediately backed off when he noticed the Bewitching Magic Spider was leaping in his direction.

To his surprise, the Bewitching Magic Spider was relentless with its attack. It was surprisingly fast on the ground, too. The eight limbs shuffled rapidly, sending up a continual splatter of soil behind it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Its speed was almost comparable to the Mother Scale Skin Phantom. The only difference was, the Mother Scale Skin Phantom was close to the size of a human, while the Bewitching Magic Spider was more like an excavator. When such a massive beast was running, with its current momentum it could even smash a hill into pieces, let alone a human!

Mo Fan did not dare to use his Departing Nether Shield.

He remembered once while he was scrolling through Weibo on his phone when he was bored, he saw a story where a little kid was trying out the sturdiness of his phone case. He struck the case a few times with a hammer, but the case was perfectly fine. However, when he turned the case around, the phone itself was shattered!

It would be the same situation if he tried defending himself with the Departing Nether Shield. The shield would be perfectly fine, Mo Fan had utter confidence in its quality since he had spent quite a fortune on it. However, the impact of the collision would still be enough to break his bones.

“Blood Tabi!” Mo Fan decided to use another piece of equipment.

A crimson glow materialized and wrapped around Mo Fan’s legs.

The Blood Tabi connected itself with the blood vessels in Mo Fan’s legs and inserted an outstanding force into them. Mo Fan felt his lower body fill with power.

The Bewitching Magic Spider charged toward him wildly, razing the tiny lumps, walls and plants in the way. Its limbs were incredibly sharp, leaving nothing in its way in one piece.

Mo Fan did not dare to underestimate the beast, darting toward the debris behind him.

As he reached the debris, the Bewitching Magic Spider was within inches from him. Mo Fan kicked the wall hard and leapt into the air above the Bewitching Magic Spider.

“Have a taste of this!”

Mo Fan had finished casting an Intermediate Fire Spell in the middle of his backflip. His entire body was engulfed in flames!
