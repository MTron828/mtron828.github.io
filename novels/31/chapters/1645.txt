1647 Xinxia Is Back

The other four Mages of Faith immediately pressed forward, but they were a little hesitant to get any closer. There were many guards at the foot of the mountain. A bunch of them quickly gathered when they saw a priest confronting a man and a woman.

The Parthenon Temple was heavily guarded. Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were completely surrounded by the people of the Parthenon Temple in a few seconds!

Mo Fan had the urge to chop the priest up right on the spot. How could the guy not be able to distinguish between right and wrong? Normally, Mo Fan would go straight up to the Mountain of the Goddess; the knights guarding the path would recognize him. The Mages of Faith and the guards at the foot of the mountain clearly had no idea who he was, thus they believed the priest instead!

“Surrender now, or we have the right to execute you right on the spot!” Bude said coldly.

“Surrender my ass, I dare you to touch me!” Mo Fan grunted back.

“Mo Fan, stay calm.” Mu Ningxue held Mo Fan back.

If they ended up provoking a priest of the Parthenon Temple, it would attract more guards of the Parthenon Temple, who were obviously inclined to side with the priest.

“Brianca is still chasing after the enemy. She might need our backup soon. We can’t afford to waste our time here,” Mo Fan said.

He was planning to treat his injuries and regroup with Brianca and the rest, yet he was caught in something so absurd!

“Can’t you tell? He’s doing it intentionally,” Mu Ningxue whispered.

“Intentionally?” Mo Fan was stunned.

She was right, if the guy had been chasing him all the way from Mount Lanmu, he could easily find out who was responsible for the crimes by asking the people that had witnessed them. Why would he insist Mo Fan was the culprit, and even accuse him of trying to trespass into the Mountain of the Goddess? He was obviously asking for trouble!

“It seems like the people we are investigating have a powerful background,” Mu Ningxue said softly.

Mo Fan frowned too. The priest had shown up out of nowhere to accuse him. His name would eventually be cleared, but it was going to waste a lot of time. It was very likely that the man who had saved Bartholomew had arranged for the priest to keep them busy, and stop them from investigating any further!

Luckily, they had asked Brianca to keep an eye in the dark. Otherwise, the trail would have ended after Bartholomew escaped!

“You’re still injured, there’s no need to confront them. Let’s compromise for now, they won’t do anything to us,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Alright,” Mo Fan nodded reluctantly

The two gave up on resisting, displaying their identities as participants of the World College Tournament. There was a huge crowd around, and some among the crowd did recognize them. A few of the guards also verified Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue’s identities.

Priest Bude did not expect them to have such a high reputation, but insisted stubbornly, “We have witnesses saying that they were using destructive magic on Mount Lanmu, and they are suspected of killing young Barbaro and stealing the Verdon Dusk. We have to interrogate them!”

“We may assist you with the investigation, but we can swear with our souls that we are not responsible for the crimes on Mount Lanmu. I hope you will find out the truth soon and not waste time on us and let the real culprit escape,” Mu Ningxue replied sternly.

“They are honorable Mages from reputable schools. They would never commit such crimes. Priest, you need to have evidence before accusing them... it’s going to be troublesome if you end up catching the wrong person,” a young guard spoke up on behalf of Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue. He greatly admired them.

“I...I do have the evidence, arrest them!” Bude clenched his teeth. He could not care less what the others said.

“Fine, remember your words! I don’t know what benefits the guy promised you, but I’ll make you pay ten times the benefits you’re getting!” Mo Fan said.

Mo Fan was now convinced that this Bude was only messing with them. The person behind him must have a formidable background. Otherwise, Bude would not have dared to set them up!

——

The two did not put up any meaningless resistance. They followed the priest and the Mages of Faith to the Hall of Faith. The Hall of Faith had its own interrogation room. Bude clearly did not want them to have a pleasant time.

“Get a Healer here to treat his wounds,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Every Healer of the Parthenon Temple is very busy. They won’t have time for you, we are not a hospital!” a Maga of Faith exclaimed.

“Mashatha, don’t bother wasting your time on them. Just let them be,” Bude said.

He was only told to restrict their freedom, and did not plan on doing anything further. He knew the two were not responsible for the crimes on Mount Lanmu, but he had listened to the man’s order even if it meant he was not fulfilling his obligations. The little favor might give him a chance to be promoted to a Great Priest!

A Great Priest... Bude had been waiting for the chance for ten years!

“He’s badly injured. His life might be in danger if he isn’t treated in time. Even a prisoner has the right to be healed, not to mention that we are only assisting with the investigation...” Mu Ningxue emphasized with a frown.

“Fine, I’ll look for a Healer,” the Maga of Faith said. She turned around and left.

Priest Bude let out a hollow laugh and left too.

Rights? You have the right to be healed, but there was no guarantee when the Healer will arrive!

Mu Ningxue already noticed what they were thinking from their reaction. She glanced at Mo Fan, whose face had turned pale.

The injuries inflicted by the Demon Judgment Sword were deadly, and the burns were getting worse. If Mo Fan was treated quickly, he could recover in no time. However, his situation would only worsen if they kept dragging it out.

“I’m fine, help me treat my wounds with these medicines,” Mo Fan still had some medicine in his Space Bracelet. It should be able to stop his injuries from worsening.

“They aren’t good enough to treat your wounds. After all, they are the work of a Super Mage,” Mu Ningxue told him.

“I didn’t think they would be able to manipulate a priest like that. I wonder who’s behind all this,” Mo Fan muttered.

As Mu Ningxue was treating Mo Fan’s wounds, they heard footsteps approaching. It sounded like someone in boots. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The person was only passing by the room, but he blurted out in surprise when he saw Mo Fan and Mu Ningxue were locked inside it, “Why are you here!?” A young knight in blue armor stared at Mo Fan with a shocked expression.

Mo Fan was overjoyed. It was the simple-minded Blue Star Knight he had met on the west side of the city.

A Blue Star Knight was allowed to travel in and out of the Mountain of the Goddess freely. Mo Fan was wondering how he could contact someone from the Mountain of the Goddess. He did not expect to meet the young knight here.

“Brother, give me a hand; help me relay a message to the Hall of the Goddess,” Mo Fan said.

“The Saintess has just returned from England. I’m only a Blue Star Knight, I’m afraid it will be a little rude to pay a visit right away...” the knight said.

“Xinxia is back?” Mo Fan was pleased. He said, “Help me give someone a call. I’ll give you the number.”

“Sure, I’ll have to do it outside. There’s no signal in here,” the knight said. He had never thought of Mo Fan as a bad guy.
