Just like bowling, the ranks of White Sand Giants were knocked to the ground simultaneously. Similarly, the White Sand Giants that knocked into them were also scattered everywhere, some shattering into pieces, as the impact was too strong!

It felt like the scene of a serious accident on a highway full of vehicles, with the remnants of the White Sand Giants flying in the air, a devastating but hilarious sight.

Mo Fan could not believe his eyes when he saw the White Sand Giants in a total mess!

If they knew the White Sand Giants’s intelligence was so astonishing in the first place, why would they spend so much effort trying to split them up and defeat them in groups?

After taking a closer look, Mo Fan discovered that the sand Zhang Xiaohou was traveling on was rolling like a tide.

Judging by the color of the sand, it must be Zhang Xiaohou’s Earth Element Soul Seed: Flowing Mud. Mo Fan immediately came to a realization.

It turned out that it was not the White Sand Giants were brainless, but Zhang Xiaohou had cast Earth Wave with a large area-of-effect. The White Sand Giants were planning to stop when they approached the walls of their kin, yet Zhang Xiaohou had planned otherwise. He used the Earth Wave to continue pushing them forward, sending them right into their comrades.

The White Sand Giants were quite heavy, needing to slide a certain distance when they tried to come to a stop after running. Zhang Xiaohou had abused their clumsy movement and agilely used his Earth Wave to create a serious ‘traffic accident’.

Imagine only the terrain not only being slippery, but also pushing you forward. The running White Sand Giants lost control of their bodies, and smashed a hole into the walls of the others!

“Once I cover the sand with Flowing Mud, the White Sand Giants aren’t able to dive into the sand, and their movement becomes clumsy,” Zhang Xiaohou said proudly, looking at his masterpiece with a smile.

Mo Fan raised his thumb to Zhang Xiaohou. It seemed like Zhang Xiaohou had learned a great deal from Zhan Kong in the army. He was no longer the same high-school kid that could not even handle a Servant-class demon beast!

“Come, time to charge forward!” Mo Fan shouted. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhang Xiaohou’s brilliant performance had aroused Mo Fan’s competitive spirit. The White Sand Giants in the Drifting Sand River was not as scary as they thought. It was not difficult to fight them once they found a way to deal with their numbers.

“Brother Fan, I’ll cover you, give them all you’ve got!” said Zhang Xiaohou to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan felt at ease hearing Zhang Xiaohou’s words. Like soldiers fighting in a war always said, this was a man he could entrust his back to.

Mo Fan did not have many friends like that, but Zhang Xiaohou was definitely one of them!

“Qianjun: Thunderbolt: Yaksha!”

Mo Fan simply closed his eyes, to avoid his channeling from being disturbed by the raging White Sand Giants. It allowed him to draw the Star Pattern at a quicker pace.

When his eyes sprang open, they were flickering with purple-black lightning.

A Rock Barrier with a slight arc sprang up from the ground, and the White Sand Giants slammed into it. However, a Rock Barrier strengthened by the Flowing Mud Soul Seed was not something that two or three White Sand Giants could break apart easily.

Meanwhile, Mo Fan had finished casting his Lightning Spell. The brilliant lightning bolt in the night sky was followed by a driving crack!

Unlike a Fiery Fist, the Thunderbolt would blast an enemy into ashes as soon as the lightning made contact with its target. There was no such thing as a deathbed struggle.

The five White Sand Giants were instantly disintegrated by the lightning, their life force vanishing.

Continue pressing forward, the two finally saw Zhao Manyan’s figure hiding inside his Sacred Shield.

Zhao Manyan was aware that his goddamned rescuers had finally arrived. Knowing that his Sacred Shield could last a while longer, he immediately cast the Water spell, Rolling Wave. The fierce wave swept out in the direction of his rescuers.

The White Sand Giants were extremely heavy, and if there were more standing in the direction the wave was rolling in, it would not have had any effect. However, they had lost ground due to Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou’s sudden invasion, so the Water spell, which was very effective at disrupting an enemy’s formation, produced a surprising outcome: the tide knocked down all the White Sand Giants in its path!

The rest of the White Sand Giants were swept toward Zhang Xiaohou and Mo Fan by the tide. Zhang Xiaohou nimbly used the bodies of the White Sand Giants as stepping stones as he leapt forward fearlessly.

Mo Fan activated the power of the Blood Tabi and mimicked Zhang Xiaohou’s action of jumping on the bodies in the water. Even though he was not as smooth as Zhang Xiaohou, he still managed to reach Zhao Manyan.

Zhao Manyan was extremely touched when he saw Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou arriving like airborne reinforcements.

“How do you feel? You still can fight?” Zhang Xiaohou glanced at the miserable Zhao Manyan.

“Of course, I’ll handle the defense. I’ll write my name backward if they manage to touch even a single strand of your hair. All you need to do is wipe out these assholes!” groaned Zhao Manyan who had been holding back his grudge for quite some time.

Mo Fan and Zhang Xiaohou both put on stern faces when they saw this rare reaction from Zhao Manyan. They immediately focused their attention on the White Sand Giants surrounding them!

The White Sand Giants were relentless too, showing no fear at all. They moved like they would drag whoever trespassed into their territory into Hell, even at the cost of their whole army.

Just in time, too; Mo Fan was hoping to rely on the White Sand Giants to collect the Soul Remnants for his fourth-tier Fire Spell. Every legendary Magician had gone through the same journey of killing demon beasts and stacking up their corpses in piles as their stepping stones toward the sacred altar!

With his unique Little Loach Pendant, not only would fighting the demon beasts give him experience to grow, he was more interested in their filthy Soul Remnants, which served as the building blocks to strengthen his Spells!

Each of the White Sand Giants’ Soul Remnant was equivalent to three ordinary Servant-class Soul Remnants; there was no better place to collect Soul Remnants!

“Houzi, you’ll handle those guys. I’ll split a shadow to bait those in the left away, and once they split up, Zhao Manyan, you and I will eliminate the White Sand Giants in front of us,” ordered Mo Fan.

Compared to the White Sand Giants, whose figures were like walls, each holding a giant saber with menacing expressions, the three young men surrounded in the middle were rather tiny, like three lambs that had stumbled into a pack of wolves.

However, the three were counting on one another, with no signs of fear on their grim faces!
