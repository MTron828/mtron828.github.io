The snake-haired head slowly rose from the darkness. Its enormous dark-red scorpion body slowly filled up the group’s vision.

“Gods!” Meos was slowly backing away in fear.

The others were terrified, too. Even though they were mentally prepared to face a Ruler-level creature in the chamber, they did not expect it to be a Scorpion Lord Medusa!

A Scorpion Lord Medusa was a Great Ruler-level creature. A Scorpion Lord Medusa was equivalent to seven or eight Dark Swordmasters; the Advisor Mummy was only as strong as one Dark Swordmaster! The only reason the Advisor Mummy had lost was because it used the Lightning Element on Mo Fan. If it had used another Element, it could easily have wiped out the entire group!

There were huge differences between Ruler-level creatures, too. The Scorpion Lord Medusa was obviously above average among the Ruler-level creatures, one that could easily enter the limelight during a battle!

“What do we do now... what do we do now... should we just kill ourselves?” Zhao Manyan blurted out as his mind went blank.

“Shreev, are you trying to set us up? Why is there a Scorpion Lord Medusa in a mummy chamber? Are you trying to get us all killed?” Sayed yelled.

“How do I know? I’m in despair, too!” Shreev answered, his face twisted.

The group immediately retreated to the entrance. They did not want to fight this Ruler-level creature, nor did they want to end their lives. It seemed like going back to the previous chamber was the only choice they had!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa had climbed out from the hole. It was staring at the group.

“Look out for its...” Heidi quickly reminded the others when she sensed an energy sweeping at them. However, her body was painted gray in the middle of her words!

Heidi did not even have the chance to finish her sentence. Her attractive face turned into a statue, together with her slender body. It happened so quickly that Heidi did not even have time to think, let alone trying to defend herself.

Meos was just about to set up her defense after seeing what happened to Heidi. She had brought quite a lot of defensive equipment, as many as Zhao Manyan had, but she had just activated the seal in her soul to Summon her magic Equipment when her body swiftly turned into stone after the Scorpion Lord Medusa set its eyes on her.

Normally, it would take some time to cast Petrify on a target and for the spell to turn it into a statue. However, The Scorpion Lord Medusa had turned Meos into a statue in a second with just a quick glimpse!

Even Super Mages were unable to withstand a single blow from the Scorpion Lord Medusa, let alone a bunch of young Mages that had not reached the Super Level. She had an indifferent look. Her eyes were sharp and cold, as if a bunch of ants that did not know their place had intruded on her palace. She was a little annoyed, yet it was nowhere enough to make her angry!

“I don’t want to turn into a statue! Mo Fan, quick, think of a plan!” Zhao Manyan yelped.

The Scorpion Lord Medusa found Zhao Manyan’s voice too annoying. It quickly shifted its gaze onto him.

When the Petrifying energy swept at Zhao Manyan, the Seal of a tortoise shell suddenly burst out from him. The Seal formed a tiny shell to prevent the spell from sealing his soul.

The Scorpion Lord Medusa’s stony gaze had failed. Zhao Manyan was overjoyed when he realized he was not petrified.

That old tortoise kept saying how he did not care if Zhao Manyan was dead, since he could move on and look for a stronger and more talented successor. However, he still stepped forward and saved Zhao Manyan’s life when it mattered. Zhao Manyan was so touched that he was on the verge of bursting into tears!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa was even more annoyed. Its indifferent gaze turned into a glare. A stronger Petrifying energy swept at Zhao Manyan like an invisible tide.

Zhao Manyan did not realize the Scorpion Lord Medusa was not even using its true power. The Seal inside the Totem Container could only protect Zhao Manyan briefly when his life was in danger. It had managed to nullify a Ruler-level creature’s attack, but Baxia was not omnipotent. It was already quite impressive that he had protected Zhao Manyan once when he was miles away. It was impossible for him to keep protecting Zhao Manyan!

Zhao Manyan’s feet soon stiffened. The energy slowly reached his waist and his chest...

“Not... like... this!” Zhao Manyan uttered his last words.

The expression on Zhao Manyan’s face as he was turning into a statue was displaying his regret of not being able to fulfill his ambition of spreading his seed across the world. A certain level of force could easily smash him into dust!

“Please... spare my life, I didn’t mean to trespass into your palace! Let me go...” Sayed was utterly terrified. He started to beg for his life.

He was already suffocating under the overwhelming presence of the Scorpion Lord Medusa. He did not have the slightest intention to fight it. He was totally unaware of how idiotic his decision was; begging a demon creature for mercy?

The Scorpion Lord Medusa had no mercy for humans. It hated the voices of humans the most. Sayed turned into stone as he was kneeling on the ground. He looked so petty.

One by one, the group was Petrified. Mu Bai and Shreev could not escape the imperious eyes. The chamber fell silent. The only ones alive in it were Mo Fan and the Scorpion Lord Medusa.

“So? Aren’t you going to use the magic on me?” Mo Fan chuckled when he saw he was the last one standing.

The Scorpion Lord Medusa was the size of a hill. It was like a deity staring down at Mo Fan, who was as tiny as a toy, yet it did not use the Medusa’s Stare on Mo Fan!

The Medusa’s Stare had no effect on him.

Those that overcame the Medusa’s Stare were forever immune to it. Mo Fan was not afraid of the Petrify or its Psychic Magic. He had gotten rid of the Curse of the Snake Eyes with the Tear of Medusa too, thus its Curse was useless against him, too!

The Medusa’s Stare held the power of Petrify, the Psychic Element, and the Curse Element. Mo Fan had experienced them all, so he was going to be fine.

The Scorpion Lord Medusa moved closer to Mo Fan. Its scorpion body had a metallic gloss. Its limbs could easily puncture and impales its enemies during a battle!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa stopped moving when it was close enough to see Mo Fan’s face.

It was staring at Mo Fan. Its body tensed as it finally recognized him!

How could the Scorpion Lord Medusa not remember Mo Fan? It was the same Scorpion Lord Medusa that attempted to trample through China’s Beijiang under Khufu’s lead. It was leading the Red Scorpion Gorgons and an army of Gorgons as the main force during the invasion when it stumbled into a devil halfway...

The Scorpion Lord Medusa still had the burning scars left by Mo Fan’s demonic flames, especially on its neck and its chest. The burns had yet to recover after so long. It could still feel the burns whenever it was asleep!

The man that had inflicted so much pain and shame on it was standing right in front of it!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa was sensitive to presence. There was no way it was mistaken. The human’s presence might be a lot weaker now, but it was sure that this was the guy who had injured it!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa did not dare to harm Mo Fan. It proceeded to turn the rest of the humans into stone while observing Mo Fan’s reaction.

“Withdraw your magic and open up the door to the next chamber for us... you’ve witnessed my strength before. You don’t have your army of Gorgons with you now, nor are the Sphinx and the Dark Pharaoh of Serpents around to help you. No one is going to save you if I insist on killing you!” Mo Fan faced the strong Scorpion Lord Medusa fearlessly.

The Scorpion Lord Medusa was furious. To think that a human dared to provoke a Ruler-level creature. It let out a scream while the snakes on its head wriggled wildly!

Six statues were scattered around Mo Fan. They might have turned into stone, but they had retained their consciousness. They could still see, hear, and even smell. Petrify was normally used to torture its target. The enemy would eventually lose their minds after being conscious for a few dozen, or even a hundred years, without being able to move.

The others heard the conversation between Mo Fan and the Scorpion Lord Medusa. If their eyes could move, they would have widened multiple times!

Was Mo Fan out of his mind? Didn’t he see them being turned into statues? Shouldn’t he just keep quiet and turn into a statue too? Perhaps someone would come and save them in ten or twenty years. However, if he continued to provoke the Scorpion Lord Medusa, it might smash everyone to pieces in a rage!

The Scorpion Lord Medusa was trying to earn its dignity back. Its eyes were brimming with hostility. The snakes on its head were screeching to vent its anger!

“I didn’t want to use it here, but I have no choice but to since you’ve asked for it!” Mo Fan’s gaze sharpened. His eyes emitted a blood-red light!

A demonic aura burst out from the boiling blood in his veins. His presence shifted tremendously, as if a devil had descended upon the area and taken over Mo Fan’s flesh. He might still look human, but the demonic aura was clearly inhuman. It was sweeping wildly about the Scorpion Lord Medusa’s chamber!

The power of the Demon Element! Mo Fan knew he would eventually have to use it against these formidable creatures, but it had happened quicker than he had expected!
