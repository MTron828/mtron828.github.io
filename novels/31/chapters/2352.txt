Mo Fan was proud of himself. Who said he was the worst candidate to be a teacher?

He had deeply taken root inside of his student’s heart in just a few months!

“Sharjah, please step aside. I’m not after your brother, so it’s not like we have to fight one another here,” Mo Fan said.

Sharjah shook her head.

“Sir, you should leave. I can make sure they won’t hurt you.” Sharjah had no intention to step aside.

“I won’t leave until I have sent Wu Ku to Hell,” Mo Fan insisted.

“Then I should apologize to you,” Sharjah bowed politely.

“What are you trying to do?”

“I’ll knock you out and bring you away from here.”

“You are such an honest and good kid,” Mo Fan let out a wry smile.

Mo Fan was not going to apprehend Sharjah and ask her a naive question like why she was helping the bad guys.

Knowing Sharjah was not related to the Black Vatican was his greatest relief. He just had to defeat her instead of killing her.

Mo Fan understood why Sharjah did not want to back down.

If her brother was the leader of the coup, the Federation would go after him once the Brown Rebels lost the war. He would be in trouble, even if he escaped to another country.

There was no way out from a coup. Either they established their kingdom and forced the Federation to acknowledge them, or they died trying!

The most Sharjah could do was spare Mo Fan’s life as his student, and the most Mo Fan could do was beat her without taking her life!

“It’s my pleasure to be able to fight you,” Sharjah said sternly.

Sharjah always had a calm appearance. Her attractive eyes always treated everything indifferently.

But now, the glow in her eyes was full of passion and anticipation, like the day she first heard about the theory of merging different Elements. She seemed nervous and excited, like a little girl who had met a celebrity she admired!

The fact that she was behaving like this meant she had long looked forward to fighting Mo Fan!

Mo Fan had known her for a few months. He knew there were not many people or things that could intrigue her. He was surprised to see her behaving like a battle maniac.

“Didn’t you say you aren’t a fan of fighting and killing?” Mo Fan asked her. Her expression clearly showed how interested she was in fighting him!

“I just don’t like to bully noobs,” Sharjah answered.

The students in the Aorus Sacred Institute are just noobs in her eyes?

Mo Fan was utterly speechless!

No one dared to be more arrogant than him when he was still a student, but Sharjah’s words made him feel like he had finally encountered a female version of the demon king!

“Sharjah, we are in the middle of a war. We don’t have time for you to challenge him to a duel!” Whit Leopard said coldly.

For some reason, White Leopard was being a little impatient despite how calm he always was. It was obviously not because Mo Fan had stolen the three Fundamental Water Crystals!

Sharjah did not even bother to reply to White Leopard. Mo Fan was the only person left in her eyes.

To her, all of the officers of the Federation Army she had killed combined were less valuable than the guy before her.

She finally had a chance to witness Lecturer Mo Yifan’s true strength!

—

White Leopard’s face was twitching with rage when Sharjah ignored him.

Ice Tiger did not dare to even breathe heavily when he saw White Leopard’s reaction.

Ice Tiger knew his brother had held feelings for Sharjah for many years. He might not have made any progress so far, but it did not mean he did not have a chance to win her affection.

However, Ice Tiger thought otherwise today.

The respect Sharjah paid Mo Fan and the passionate look in her eyes clearly indicated White Leopard was no different than a piece of rock by the road!

“Do you really think you can do whatever you want here!?” White Leopard did not dare to vent his anger at Sharjah. He directed all his attention at Mo Fan instead. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He went closer as the icy Aura he was emitting swept at Mo Fan like a fierce hailstorm.

“You finally decided not to hide behind your cannon fodder, you son of a b**ch?” Mo Fan was amused.

“Die!”

White Leopard would not allow Mo Fan and Sharjah to have a duel with one another, as if they were displaying their affections in public!

It was time to end this farce!

He would kill the young man and take the Fundamental Water Crystals back. The young man would only be an unrecognizable corpse in the end, regardless of Sharjah’s interest in him.

White Leopard acted swiftly. He was a Super Mage whose Ice Element had reached the third tier of the Super Level. His speed at constructing a Star Constellation was the same as others Casting an Intermediate Spell.

Hail fell fiercely as soon as he spread his arms. It dove at Mo Fan like thousands of ice moths beating their wings rapidly.

The riverbed had been chewed up, revealing the jagged rocks underneath.

As a matter of fact, the bottom layer of rocks was fully revealed. If a regiment of soldiers was here, they would soon turn into sinister white skeletons after their flesh and blood were sliced off by the ice moths!

Mo Fan did not expect White Leopard to attack first. He glanced at Sharjah and noticed her waiting patiently.

Mo Fan turned into shadow sparrows, flying off in different directions.

White Leopard glared at the shadow sparrows. He could Summon a new flight of ice moths every time he spread his arms.

“The one on the left!” Damon shouted. He was able to see through Mo Fan’s diversion.

White Leopard immediately gathered the ice moths and sent them after Mo Fan’s true self.

The ice moths approached their target without leaving the slightest gap between them.

Mo Fan’s Shadow Sparrow was not overly fast. The army of ice moths soon caught up to him.

He left the shadow and faced them, the back of his hands turned outward. His eyes turned golden-brown!

“Circle of Crystal Teeth: Heavens Gate!”

A huge gate emerged from the ground to stop the army of ice moths.

The deadly ice moths rammed into the sturdy Heavens Gate and shattered into powder.

Even though Mo Fan only had a Heaven-inferior Earth Seed, his Earth Magic was strong enough to defend him when necessary. It allowed Mo Fan to defend himself to a certain degree, even though he was a pure destructive Mage. He no longer had to run for his life or fight back fiercely when he was attacked.

The powerful Heavens Gate consumed less than a quarter of the Shards. White Leopard kept attacking with the Ice Element, which was relatively effective against Mo Fan, but all Mo Fan had to do was activate the Shards nearby. He was using the energy left by the elite soldiers to fend off White Leopard’s fierce attacks.

He did not have to do anything to activate the Shards!

Mo Fan was not in a rush to attack White Leopard. He had to deal with many enemies at once, including Sharjah.

He had to remain calm and observe every enemy that might pose a threat to him, to learn what magic they were using!
