“Another theory for the Space Element is the so-called Spatial Relay Point. Think of the world as a sphere; we are living on its surface, which is the Earth’s surface. The sphere consists of countless axes through the center of the sphere. Using Blink as an example again, when a Mage casts the spell, it will rotate the angle of the axis that represents the Mage’s location by a certain angle. The angle might only be tiny, but a small change in the angle is equivalent to a few hundred kilometers on the surface,” Lingling went on.

“Why did I never hear anything like that, even though I’m a Space Mage?” Mo Fan grumbled.

Lingling rolled her eyes and ignored the uneducated Mo Fan. She added, “The center of the sphere is the intersection point of all the axes. It remains the same at all times. The point is referred to as the Spatial Relay Point, because regardless of where you are, if you can find a way to enter the sphere and reach the intersection point, you will find yourself at the Spatial Relay Point!”

“So this means that Sun Ridge and Peru Desert Valley are symmetrical?” Mui Qing asked after she realized something.

“No, the sphere of the Space Element and Earth are different. If the second theory is correct, it means this current spot in Kunlun Mountain’s Sun Ridge and the eye of the storm in Peru Desert Valley are spatially symmetrical. The storm barrier and the White Lava curtain are the gates leading to the Spatial Relay Point. Of course, you can think of it as us going into the ground, and appearing on the other side of the earth where the corresponding coordinates are. The Spatial Relay Point is like Earth’s core, where Arctic and Antarctica are in symmetry,” Lingling answered. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zhao Manyan turned to Mo Fan with a confused face. Mo Fan said awkwardly, “Don’t look at me, I don’t have the slightest clue what she is saying at all.”

“You’re very knowledgeable!” Mui Qing was quite impressed.

“May I ask, is there any way for us to travel to the other side of the axis, for example, to Peru? Doesn’t that mean we are safe!?” Zhao Manyan pressed.

“Theoretically, it’s possible, but we’ll have to find the other gate. Otherwise, we can only leave through the gate we entered,” Lingling said.

They walked into the ruins of the ancient city while they were talking. Mo Fan followed the street, which was just as clean as it was when he first visited the place. He was thinking of checking out the statue.

“This place is surprisingly well-preserved!” Mui Qing exclaimed.

The outer part of the ancient city was in ruins, but as they ventured deeper, it felt like the ancient city had frozen at some point in time, like an elegant teenage girl falling into a deep slumber in a different dimension. Her face remained the same despite the flow of time...

“It looks exactly the same as the last time we came. Nothing changed,” Zhao Manyan said.

“Rumors say that time in a Spatial Relay Point is static,” Lingling added.

“Time is static?”

The others’ eyes widened, but both Zhao Manyan and Mo Fan soon nodded in agreement. Zhao Manyan was the first to speak, “Now that you mention it, I also feel that way. The place is exactly the same as it was when we came two years ago.”

“This place is the intersection point of all time axes. The flow of time reflects the change in space, but this place won’t change at all,” Lingling said.

Mo Fan and Zhao Manyan were even more convinced after hearing Lingling’s explanation.

But the question was, was it really possible for time to be unmoving in this world?

Would time actually stop on a certain day, just like this ancient city that had fallen into an eternal slumber on a certain afternoon, and had not changed even by the slightest after a few hundred years?

As they went further ahead, Mo Fan started to feel a little more familiar with the surroundings. He remembered seeing the fountain and the beautiful sacred statue of an alluring figure at the end of the street.

However, Mo Fan felt as if he had just been electrocuted when he arrived at the fountain.

“The statue...” Mo Fan pointed at the statue. He was lost in thoughts for quite some time.

“What’s wrong with the statue? It’s pretty nice-looking,” Zhao Manyan squinted while admiring the statue. The statue was not wearing any clothes. The naked body was covered by a thin veil, but the sacred body of the young woman was still visible. He was having trouble shifting his gaze away from the statue.

“Are you sure that time is static in here?” Mo Fan asked.

“Why do you ask?” Lingling asked.

“This is where I found the Time Liquid, but the statue turned into sand and drifted away in the air. Why is it perfectly fine now!?” Mo Fan stared at the vivid and lifelike statue of a young woman. He was utterly confused, wondering exactly what was going on here!

The words that Zhao Manyan had carved on the wall were still there, so how did the statue restore on its own? Mo Fan clearly remembered the statue had already turned into dust that was blown away by the wind...

“Time was turned back?” Lingling murmured, after taking a closer look at the statue.

“No way, how is it possible to turn back time?” Mui Qing protested.

“Who knows? You all assume this place is secluded from the outside world, but maybe something has been here all along, something that restored the statue,” Mu Bai ventured.

He found it hard to believe time could be static, or the possibility of turning back time. Time was not something that could be manipulated by magic; many of their ancestors had proven that to be true!

Mo Fan went closer. He reached out his hand to touch the statue to see if it was rebuilt recently. However, he immediately felt scorching heat coming from his back. It was approaching them rapidly.

“Look out!” Mo Fan immediately turned around. The flames of Ardent Sunset erupted on his right fist as he threw it at the fireball that was coming at them!

The Fiery Fist collided with the fireball that was trying to ambush them on the street and exploded like fireworks. The flames were blown into the air before pouring down on the structures, setting the place ablaze.

The rest were shocked as they quickly turned around.

They were surprised to see a woman in silver heels standing on one of the wooden huts. She was engulfed in a blue flame, staring at them indifferently.

“Such impressive reflexes!” the woman sniffed disdainfully.

“Mu Xumian!” Mu Bai’s gaze sharpened.

Mo Fan was also shocked when he saw the woman.

How did the woman get in here? Was the White Lava only for decoration?

“You aren’t the only ones that came here prepared. I already mentioned before, I hate it when people waste my time. I was initially considering sparing your lives, but since you don’t appreciate my kindness, I will have no choice but to bury you all here!”
