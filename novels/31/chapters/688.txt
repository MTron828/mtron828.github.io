The Mountain Zombie was totally infuriated. It seemed to be treating its minions more kindly than any other undead. When it saw the minuscule figure killing its army of zombies, it immediately raised its arm and flung it down through the clouds with great power!

The inner city rocked. The Mountain Zombie’s arm came down like a godly hammer from Heaven. The whole area trembled from the impact, as the whole street was smashed into pieces, including the buildings and the road paved with cement...

The street was at least a kilometer long, yet the force exerted by the arm instantly razed everything along it to the ground. Its strength was simply too shocking!

In the middle of the street that had been crushed into dust, a small human-sized figure slowly rose to its feet, as if it was perfectly unharmed.

Purple-black lightning circled around Demon Mo Fan like he was mad.

Demon Mo Fan wiped the blood from his lips. Pupils that gradually turned purple exchanged glances with the Mountain Zombie.

The Mountain Zombie bent down and stared down at the sunken ground it had created. However, all it saw was a pair of cold eyes staring back at it.

He was not dead!

The minuscule human was not dead!

Not many creatures in the world could survive a swing of its arm!

Fierce lightning descended from the sky, tearing a gap between Heaven and Earth, connecting the sky and the ground!

The purple-black lightning landed right on Demon Mo Fan. Instead of a lightning strike, the force of the lightning poured over his demonic, majestic body!

Demon Mo Fan stood in the lightning with his arms spread wide, as if he was receiving a baptism. With a deafening roar, the lightning turned into dozens of purple-black dragons flying within a few hundred meters around Demon Mo Fan!

Half-bending his knees, Demon Mo Fan, circled by the lightning dragons turned himself into an evil bow on the verge of firing!

Demon Mo Fan launched himself into the sky again. The lightning dragons could not match his speed and were following behind him, leaving a long trail of lightning...

His fist flickered with lightning. The runes covering Demon Mo Fan’s body emitted a brilliant, blood-black glow, as the dangerous energy concealed inside his demonic body was fully unleashed!

The punch was thrown right at the Mountain Zombie’s collar bone, where an obvious wound was visible!

The strength of the demon punch was remarkable, and together with the lightning dragons following right behind it, the combination of attacks left a huge hole on the Mountain Zombie’s collar bone!

Initially, the wound was the size of a needle. However, when the lightning dragons struck the same spot, the wound suddenly became clear and deep. One could even see the bones inside!

The Mountain Zombie took a few steps backward. Each step alone covered a few hundred meters. It slowly lowered its head and discovered that the wound on its collar bone was festering from the lightning punch. Fresh blood poured down like a waterfall from it!

The Mountain Zombie was indeed injured when fighting the seven human experts. However, none of them had left a huge hole that had caused it to bleed so freely. It clearly remembered that it had smashed the human who had left the tiny wound on its collar bone dead against a mountain!

——

“Is...is that Mo Fan?” The authorities on the clock tower were dazzled.

The Wicked Eye Copper Mirror had disappeared together with the Space of Death. They initially thought Demon Mo Fan was crushed when the space collapsed. However, they did not expect Demon Mo Fan to return to the outer city through the turbulent flow of space. On top of that, he had started a fight with the Mountain Zombie!

The Mountain Zombie!

They had sent seven Super Magicians to fight the creature, but half of them were dead, while those who came back were too injured to continue fighting.

Now Demon Mo Fan was fighting the Mountain Zombie in the ocean of zombies. He even managed to leave a huge hole along the throat of the Mountain Zombie!

Before the astonished crowd, a human figure swept a long arc across the sky above the inner city and slammed hard onto the top of the golden barrier.

The crowd raised their head and saw Mo Fan, his body covered in runes, rising to his feet. As he was standing up, an enormous palm covering the sky came down, aiming right at Mo Fan, who had fallen onto the golden barrier!

The slap rocked the whole city. Even the barrier was on the verge of breaking. However, Demon Mo Fan had somehow made it to the other side, barely evading the Mountain Zombie’s attack.

The Mountain Zombie was completely infuriated. Its enormous body leapt into the air and landed on the golden barrier...

The Mountain Zombie was stepping on the golden barrier, right above the crowd underneath. Many people in the inner city lost consciousness upon seeing this. The people crowding the streets suddenly fell to the ground.

Only those with a stronger will raised their heads and stared at the intimidating sight with blank faces. It felt like their hearts would explode at any second!

“Holy crap! Isn’t that Mo Fan?!” Zhao Kunsan pointed up. He could clearly see Mo Fan’s rune-covered face at this angle.

“Are you out of your mind, how could he possibly be... holy shit, he does look exactly like Mo Fan!” Wang Sanpang was about to curse as he gathered his courage and glanced upward to take a closer look at the face!

Despite the ghastly expression and savage aura, the face belonged to none other than Mo Fan!

He had long silver hair and mysterious runes across his body. A Wolf Soul Shadow was attached to his back!

The truth was, apart from a face that those who were familiar with Mo Fan could recognize, the guy did not resemble Mo Fan at all. It was like a demon from the underworld that had taken control of Mo Fan’s body to stir up chaos in their world. The Mountain Zombie seemed to have trouble defeating him!

“Where did he go?” asked Zhou Ming panickingly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t know, he’s too fast. He just vanished within the blink of an eye!” said Zhao Kunsan.

Demon Mo Fan was extremely hot-tempered, yet it did not mean that he was not using his brain.

The Mountain Zombie greatly surpassed the power of his demon form in terms of strength. He would only get himself killed by trying to defeat the creature with brute force. The best way now was to locate the wounds that the seven Super Magicians had left on the creature’s body. He had to utilize them to inflict serious damage on the Mountain Zombie!
