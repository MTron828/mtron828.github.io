In a giant pit along the scorched ground...

Mo Fan was quite experienced when it came to avoiding unnecessary expenses. Just in case he had to compensate people for the loss, Mo Fan purposely knocked Philip into a fairly spacious area. Otherwise, half of the shops on the street would have instantly turned to ashes!

Inside the burning pit, Philip was covered in festering boils, with lots of blood pouring from his mouth.

He struggled to his feet. All that was left of his magic armor was broken pieces dangling from his body. It could no longer give him any protection. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Right before the attack struck him, he had gathered all his Ice Magic to form a thick ice armor to protect himself. Otherwise, he would have evaporated instantly before the overwhelming heat of the Thousand Feathers Fiery Phoenix!

Philip wiped the blood from his lips. He was trembling in anger.

He finally knew why Salan had specifically asked him to take out the kid. Not only was he the strongest young Mage he had ever seen, both his Natural Innate Talent of having extra Elements, and his unique Fire Elemental Spirit and its ability to possess him, were extremely impressive. If Philip was at the same age as Mo Fan, the young man could easily crush him to death!

“You should be proud that you’re able to leave me in this state. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to kill me yet!” Philip burst out laughing.

“Are you going to run away?” Mo Fan mocked.

“Next time, I’ll surely take your life!” Philip had no intention to fight Mo Fan further.

“You said the same thing last time,” Mo Fan replied indifferently.

Philip’s furious eyes flickered murderously. However, without his Domain, he had no chance of killing Mo Fan. These young Mages had set him up this time; he had only ended up like this because he had stepped into their trap. However, once his Domain recovered, he could easily kill these brats!

Philip turned around and fled for his life. He was not afraid of Mo Fan chasing after him, as his Domain would soon recover. Mo Fan would simply get himself killed if he actually decided to chase after him!

Philip quickly escaped to another street. He turned around and saw Mo Fan tailing him, yet he was not following too close behind.

“Luckily, the Sacred Hall Mages did not show up!” Philip let out a relieved sigh.

Mo Fan was not his greatest worry. Even without his Domain, Mo Fan would still have trouble killing him. As long as the Sacred Hall Mages were not here, no one could possibly stop him from escaping.

Just a little longer, he would soon reclaim his Domain. It was Philip’s greatest concern now!

He had started to regret underestimating Mo Fan. It was unwise to continue with the fight after he realized they had set up a trap for him!

An Executioner could kill their target at anytime, there was no reason for him to rush it! As long as he was still alive...

“So you’re an Executioner of the Black Vatican, Salan’s lackey?” an eerie voice suddenly appeared behind Philip.

Philip was stunned. He immediately turned around and saw a man with a cold, tanned face less than ten meters away.

When did this guy show up beside him? He was sure that there was nobody nearby when he checked the place just a moment ago!

Philip reacted quickly. He immediately activated his Magic Boots, and turned into a ray of light, heading for the alleyway.

The light sprinted quickly in the alleyway and turned the corner at lightning speed. Philip slowed down only after he sprinted through five alleyways...

However, the space ahead started to twist. With a mysterious, silver glow, the same man appeared right before him. His eyes were staring at Philip with fury and hatred!

Philip was stunned. The man felt somewhat familiar; he seemed to be one of the members of the Chinese national team. Philip did investigate the team prior to this, and the man seemed to be their captain.

The guy was not around when he had first ambushed Mo Fan. However, in Philip’s eyes, no one on the national team could possibly stop him from killing Mo Fan!

However, when Philip actually stumbled into the captain of the Chinese national team, he was surprised to sense a dangerous aura!

-This guy’s cultivation... how can a student of a national team be this strong!?-

“Demon Torture!” Ai Jiangtu clenched his hand into a claw and closed it.

The demon forming behind Philip emitted an eerie red glow as it grabbed onto Philip’s throat with both hands!

A shocking claw mark immediately appeared on Philip’s throat. Meanwhile, his soul was dragged out of his body by the demon!

“We don’t need the help of the Sacred Hall Mages to take you out!” Mo Fan finally arrived by jumping between the roofs of the buildings, and landed in front of Philip.

Ai Jiangtu had been waiting for the already-injured Philip for a long time. The man had no chance of escaping once he was struck by the Curse Spell.

Did he seriously think he could run away from a Space Mage who could Blink?

Go ahead and run as fast as you can, a Space Mage could smoke a cigarette right until its end and still have no trouble catching up to him!

“Should we deal with him on our own or hand him to the Sacred Hall Mages?” Mo Fan asked.

“Let’s hand him over to the Sacred Hall Mages, there’s something you have to know,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“AHHH!!! AH! Let me go! Let me go!”

Philip cried out in agony as the two were chatting. The Demon Torture kept tearing at him. Even though there were no visible wounds on him, his soul was already covered in bruises and scars.

As a matter of fact, when they learned the guy was once a Sacred Hall Mage, Lingling immediately proposed asking for someone’s help, someone who wasn’t a Sacred Hall Mage. If the guy dared to commit murder on the street, it was obvious that he was not afraid of the Sacred Hall Mages...

Therefore, Mo Fan decided to ask Ai Jiangtu for help.

Ai Jiangtu did not make his move at the start. The truth was, even if both Mo Fan and Ai Jiangtu teamed up, they could easily defeat Philip as long as he did not have his Domain. However, they were worried that Philip would flee immediately after realizing that he was at a disadvantage...

Since they were determined to take out the Executioner here in New York, they could not afford to let him run away. Ai Jiangtu had been watching in the dark, waiting to strike at the perfect time to take Philip down!

Philip was too focused on detecting the presence of the Sacred Hall Mages, assuming they were the only ones that could pose a threat to him. To his surprise, Ai Jiangtu’s strength was comparable to some of the Sacred Hall Mages, and Mo Fan had asked him to lend a hand, just in case!

Ai Jiangtu was from the Chinese army. The others, who were not close to Mo Fan, would hesitate to meddle in affairs related to the Black Vatican, but Ai Jiangtu would never forgive the Black Vatican. The Chinese army had sworn to uproot the Black Vatican ever since the Calamity of the Ancient Capital!

“Keep it going, don’t let him have a chance to summon his Domain. Otherwise, even with the whole team here, we won’t be able to stop him from running away,” Mo Fan reminded Ai Jiangtu.

“Mmm!” Ai Jiangtu nodded. He glanced at the street that was now full of debris and said, “I think you’ll need to pay a lot of money for that.”

“I’m guessing I’ve done the Sacred Hall Mages a huge favor. I assume they will be willing to pay for the damages!” Mo Fan shrugged indifferently.

Zhao Manyan and Jiang Yu had evacuated the streets before the fight took place. They were not in trouble as long as there were no casualties. They might not be forgiven if they failed to arrest the evil Mage that was attempting to murder someone on the street!

Ai Jiangtu glanced at Philip and saw the heavily damaged symbol on the back of his right hand. He said, “Even though we managed to arrest this Executioner, the Black Vatican still got away with it.”

“Got away? With what?” Mo Fan was confused.

“Philip was only bait.”

“Bait?” Mo Fan was even more confused.

If anyone was the bait, wouldn’t it be him? He had been strutting across the world, provoking the people of the Black Vatican to come trouble him. That being said, he had still managed to take out every member of the Black Vatican that he stumbled into.

“Do you really think the Black Vatican is stupid enough to commit murder on the street, considering how cunning they are?” Ai Jiangtu chided him.

“I was pretty confused by that too,” Mo Fan admitted.

With the Black Vatican’s style, Mo Fan thought they would only strike when he was alone at a remote place. Not only would it be easier to kill him, they could easily run away, even if they failed the attempt!

Meanwhile, Philip’s attempt was strangely arrogant. He had decided to attack Mo Fan less than five kilometers away from the Sacred Hall of Liberty. Wouldn’t that allow the Sacred Hall of Liberty to send reinforcements right away? It was too risky, even if Philip was well aware of their presence!

“Doesn’t that mean they weren’t actually trying to kill me?” Mo Fan asked when he realized something was fishy.

“They were serious about killing you, but it was only one of their goals, or I should say, it’s only something they wanted to do conveniently. On the same night Philip attempted to kill you on the street, someone stole a forbidden object from the Sacred Hall of Liberty,” Ai Jiangtu explained.

Mo Fan frowned. He glanced at Philip, who had fallen to the ground feebly after the extreme torture.

“This guy was only a diversion?” Mo Fan asked.

“Mmm, the real culprit has already left New York with the forbidden object. They purposely made a great fuss when attempting to kill you just so Philip could distract them, allowing his accomplice to steal the forbidden object from the Sacred Hall of Liberty. Killing you was one of their goals too; they were trying to kill two birds with one stone... the Sacred Hall of Liberty just realized it not long ago,” Ai Jiangtu informed him.

Mo Fan’s heart sank.

-That bitch Salan is indeed detestable, especially with how cunning she is...-

Mo Fan initially planned to send her the Executioner’s corpse as a huge gift, yet it turned out that Salan had played the Sacred Hall of Liberty like a fiddle. They pretended they were plotting to kill him to get revenge, yet their real goal was to steal the forbidden object from the Sacred Hall of Liberty!

“What was it that they stole? Is it important?” Mo Fan asked.

“I only know that much. The Sacred Hall of Liberty is reluctant to declare it to the public. Anyway, we still managed to arrest Philip, so it’s not a worst-case scenario. Let’s hand Philip over to the Sacred Hall of Liberty. Hopefully, they can retrieve the stolen object through him,” Ai Jiangtu said.

“Mmm!” Mo Fan agreed.

Ai Jiangtu smiled when he saw the grim look on Mo Fan’s face, “Speaking of which, you have grown a lot stronger. I bet the Black Vatican never thought your strength would improve so quickly. I’m pretty sure they are at a loss about what level of Executioner they should send after you.”

“I did hope they would be sending a Red Cardinal after me,” Mo Fan replied.

“If they really have to send a Red Cardinal after you, the Black Vatican won’t be far away from being uprooted,” Ai Jiangtu mused...

There was no way Salan would show herself, even though her strength greatly exceeded Mo Fan’s. She knew that if she actually showed up, Mo Fan would transform into a demon without hesitation, and kill her right away!
