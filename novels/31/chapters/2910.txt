Chapter 2911: Beast Blood

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hurry up! We have to leave this haunted place!”

The team abandoned the Ice Wheel Flying Boat and rushed out of the massive ice graves without caring much about others.

The graves expanded. The ice surrounded them like a mountain range. Even the sky above them was covered by ice.

The only way to escape was to keep running and breaking the newly condensed ice crystals. If they were any slower, they would be trapped inside the thick ice. The ice would freeze their blood and stiffen their bodies. They would end up becoming a living ice specimen, engraved on the ice rocks.

Even though Wang Shuo had been to the Extreme South Land, he had never encountered such a terrifying disaster. All they had in their minds was to rush out and break the ice!

They grew weary under the icy cold weather. It was hard to imagine how far the ice field thunderstorm would cover. They also wondered how far the extreme south graves could expand.

They felt the sunlight was getting further from them. The cold invaded their bodies. They felt exhausted. They began thinking whether it was such a bad idea to give up and let the ice engulf them. Perhaps it was not a bad idea to get trapped inside the ice crystals. At the very least, they did not have to suffer so much pain.

They felt tired. The light was far from them. They moved forward at full speed, only to come to a bottomless ice cave and fall deeper into it. They were further away from the exit!

“Are we going to die here?”

Some of them were so tired that they could not move any longer.

Swish!

A purple holy flame that resembled a flaming holy beast lit up. It spread toward the ice rock before them.

The thick ice melted, and they felt warm. Wei Guang stepped on a wave of flames and flew ahead of the group. He cast a long holy flame carpet and provided a glimmer of hope for those who were about to give up.

“We’re almost out there! Hurry up!” shouted Li Wenbin.

It was only then that they were filled with hope and rushed out of the terrifying massive graves along the flaming carpet.

Outside the ice field thunderstorm was a tranquil and picturesque scene. Snowflakes dropped on the ice mountain ranges. Small creatures that could withstand the cold roamed on the smooth land.

The sunlight was bright enough without burning their skins. It was as warm as the afternoon sun.

The experience of staying by the edge of the thunderstorm was completely different from when they were in the middle of the thunderstorm. They felt that what they had experienced a while ago was nothing more than a scary nightmare!

“Take a headcount!” Wang Shuo said to the crowd.

The team leaders quickly did a headcount. Yan Lan let out a scream. The Healing Mage from her team was gone!

Li Wenbin frowned. The two Royal Mages under his lead were missing too. The two Royal Mages had previously been struck by the rebelling wind.

They were five people short.

They had not recovered from the lingering fear of escaping the graves in the middle of the ice field thunderstorm. They were now enveloped in helplessness and fear.

It was unlikely that they could return to the ice field thunderstorm and rescue others.

After the thunderstorm was over, all they could see were mountain ranges behind their back. The mountains were entirely made up of ice and snow. Digging the five people out was no different from getting trapped in a quicksand. They would only get caught in it, too!

The Extreme South Land was filled with danger. Everyone was prepared to sacrifice their lives. But they did not expect the five people to die so soon.

“We’ve lost the Ice Wheel Flying Boat and Clear Fire Formation. We can at most survive for three days in the middle of the cold!” Li Wenbin panicked.

They only had three days!

They were in the middle of the Extreme South Land. It would take them about four days even if they were to return to the ocean. They did not have an escape.

Hardly any of them could keep their cool in the face of this situation where the road ahead was filled with danger without a way back.

“That’s why we can’t delay any longer. Follow me! We’ll go forward on foot!” said Wei Guang.

“I’m so tired that I barely have the energy to speak.”

“That’s right. The ice field thunderstorm drained too much of our energy. We need to take a rest.”

“Take a rest, huh?” Wei Guang glanced at the exhausted Mages and sneered. “If we can’t reach the South Pole Station in three days, all of you will sleep eternally in this place. Moreover, the cold will weaken our magic. We might still be able to fight the Ice Beast for a day or two. But on the third day, we will be so weak that we can’t even fight the weakest ice creatures in this place!”

“Wei Guang is right. We can’t take a rest yet. Let us gird up our loins and continue to march forward!” said Wang Shuo.

…

Everyone was exhausted. Even though they had successfully escaped the ice field thunderstorm filled with graves, it did not mean they were physically strong.

Furthermore, the cold continued to torture their bodies and drain their energy. Judging from their current states, Mu Ningxue believed they would not be able to make it to the destination alive.

Mu Ningxue had not expected the terrifying ice field thunderstorm to appear suddenly and block their way.

“Professor Wang, is there a way to alleviate, or even get rid of the cold poison? According to the special law of nature, the corresponding antidote is always somewhere around the poison. I suppose there must be something that can help to fight the cold in the Extreme South Land?” Mu Ningxue asked Wang Shuo.

If they continued in this state, Mu Ningxue believed that all would die of the cold except herself. Even Wei Guang was no exception.

Wang Shuo paused mid-stride. His gloomy eyes lit up. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

‘She’s right! There is indeed such a law of nature!’ There must be something they had overlooked!

“Blood Beast! The Giant Ice Beast’s boiling blood!” Wang Shuo cried out in excitement.

“Professor Wang, are you mad?” said Li Wenbin.

“Even though the Giant Ice Beasts are covered in strong cold-resistant fleece and skin, their blood plays the most crucial role in helping them to resist the cold. Some of their blood boils like hot lava and contains high levels of heat. If we consume the Giant Ice Beast’s boiling blood, we can resist the cold and eliminate the cold poison to a certain extent,” said Wang Shuo.

“Are you sure it works?” Wei Guang turned around and asked solemnly.

“We can give it a try. At least the heat from the blood can warm our body for a while, if nothing else,” said Wang Shuo.

“But the Giant Ice Beast is at least a ruler-level beast. We don’t have much energy left to kill it,” Li Wenbin said.

They were so tired that they could barely lift their legs. It was considered a blessing that they could even walk, let alone fight a ruler-level beast.

“I’ve exhausted too much mental energy. I need some time to recuperate.” said Wei Guang. His lips had turned pale.

If it had not been for Wei Guang’s purple holy flame, they would not have been able to escape from the ice field thunderstorm. Wei Guang had exhausted much of his energy.

“Set up a camp and take a rest first. I’ll go and get it,” said Mu Ningxue.
