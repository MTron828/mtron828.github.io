The party had only briefly proceeded on with their journey when they saw a group of people rushing toward them through a cloud of sand ahead.

As the group came closer, Mo Fan’s crew realized that they were also a party of Hunters, who seemed relatively young. They had to be quite talented among Magicians.

When they arrived and saw the Sand Howl Tiger’s corpse, their expressions immediately sank. A female Magician who was slightly tanned among them approached Mo Fan’s group furiously and snapped while pointing her finger at them, “How shameless are you guys! We’ve been hunting the Sand Howl Tiger for half a day and injured it, yet you guys have stolen our prey after we lost track of it for a while. Don’t you know that as Hunters, you’re not supposed to take other people’s prey!?”

The tanned female Magician spoke imposingly, her voice sharp and screeching, making everyone feel uncomfortable.

“Aunty, the Sand Howl Tiger was already charging at us when we saw it. Are you telling me that we’re supposed to let the beast eat us alive if we’re not allowed to kill it?” Zhao Manyan was the first to blurt out unpleasantly.

“Who are you calling an aunty? I’m not even thirty!” The tanned female Magician was infuriated.

“Oh, but your temperament is the same as those aunties dancing at the public squares when their spot has been taken.” Mo Fan was fond of making sarcastic remarks too. He immediately joined in and sang a duet with Zhao Manyan.

The tanned female Magician pulled a long face, and seemed to have an urge to teach the two disrespectful guys a lesson.

However, the rather manly leader with a black beard stepped forward and stopped her.

He preferred not to start a fight here, since they were currently in the demon beasts’ territory. It was better for the Hunters to help one another, even though they felt it unfair that their prey was stolen just like that. They had injured the Sand Howl Tiger in the first place, thus the creature’s strength was no longer at its peak... ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“No wonder the Sand Howl Tiger was so easy to deal with,” Zhang Xiaohou realized.

When fighting the Sand Howl Tiger, Zhang Xiaohou had already noticed that the beast was covered in wounds and bruises, so he thought the beast had fought against some other creature before. It turned out that it had fought a group of Hunters, and fled when it realized that it was no match for them. Somehow, it had stumbled into Mo Fan’s party, who ended up taking advantage of the situation.

“My brothers, we fought the Sand Howl Tiger for quite a while. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to kill it so easily. How about this, let us take a look if the Sand Howl Tiger’s corpse has any rare bones, rare blood, rare skin or something else, and we’ll split the loot in half,” said the leader with a black beard in a friendly manner.

However, Mo Fan was not happy.

These idiots had lost track of their prey, and demanded that the prey was theirs after such a long time, and even asked them to split the loot in half!

In their dreams!

The Sand Howl Tiger was quite infamous, and its corpse was quite valuable too. Even without the rare loot, a corpse in good condition would still worth around a hundred to two hundred thousand RMB!

Mo Fan would not mind discussing other things, but when it came to money, Mo Fan was not willing to give a single cent to others!

“How shameless, and you call yourself Hunters, humph!” Lingling was not fond of the demand either.

“Mm, little girl, who do you think you’re talking to, the prey was ours to begin with! Come down, come down here and I’ll teach how you should behave yourself!” the tanned female Magician was enraged, snapping while pointing at Lingling.

“We’re just following the rules set by Hunters, how is this being shameless?” The leader with a black beard pulled a long face.

“Hasn’t someone taught you to respect your seniors?!” retorted Lingling.

“Seniors? Hahahaha, you’re funny, look at how young you are, you must be a bunch of kids running away from your high school and fooling around. If we didn’t injure the Sand Howl Tiger beforehand, you all would be a pile of bones by now. You should be thanking us, the Sand Howl Tiger isn’t some creature that can be handled by someone with only talks like you...” the tanned female Magician mocked them.

She was extremely annoying, and mumbling non-stop. Meanwhile, Lingling took out her Hunter badge and showed it to her.

The tanned female Magician opened her eyes wide, her mouth could not put on the breaks in time.

She was staring at Lingling in disbelief, shifting her focus back and forth to the Hunter badge.

A Hunter badge was similar to magic equipment, and could only be bound to a Magician’s soul. It was impossible to fake it.

The group of Hunters was only a bunch of Advanced Hunters, who still had to gain a mountain of points to achieve the ranks of Hunter Master.

On top of that, the Hunter Union had requested that lower-ranked Hunters respect their seniors. They were not allowed to compete with the higher-ranked Hunters for their prey, nor were they allowed to disrespect their seniors...

The tanned female Magician was wearing a fascinating expression, and could not find words for a long time.

The unpleasant expression on their leader’s face stiffened too.

If the little girl was already a Hunter Master, how about the others in her party? They had underestimated these people!

No wonder the Sand Howl Tiger had already turned into a corpse after they had only lost track of it for a short period of time!

——

The leader with a black beard and the tanned female Magician quickly ran away with their crew after embarrassing themselves.

It was their fault for being greedy, demanding Mo Fan’s crew to split the loot when they had lost track of their prey in the first place. They were unlucky enough to stumble onto a freak like Lingling.

It was only an insignificant interlude. The party proceeded with their journey along the pulsating sandhill.

The desert was not as boundless as it seemed. After more than a day’s journey, the vast sands had turned into a barren, rocky land ahead.

The odds of stumbling into a Sand Howl Tiger increased on the rocky terrain. The group tried their best to avoid the beasts, yet they had no choice but to fight when the battle was inevitable.

With Zhang Xiaohou in the team, the stuff he had learned in the army proved to be extremely useful. He was able to nimbly lure the Sand Howl Tigers away when it was impossible to avoid contact with them.

It was tough for the team to face three Sand Howl Tigers simultaneously, thus most of the time, Zhang Xiaohou would be sprinting across the rocky terrain, luring the idiotic Sand Howl Tigers after him, so the team was able to move forward safely.

The journey was thus mostly free of danger, and they eventually arrived at the Drifting Sand River.

The Drifting Sand River was, in fact, a dry valley running down from the high grounds nearby, which had become incredibly wide under the erosion of the wind. Even on the map, the Drifting Sand River resembled a long soil-colored snake winding through the Drifting Sand River region. Its length extended through half of Gansu, and its narrowest part was still more than ten kilometers wide!
