“Lingling, how is it?” Mo Fan walked into Lingling’s room.

“It’s poisonous saliva. The soil is corroded, but I’m afraid it wasn’t a Dark Beast Monster, nor a Cursed Beast,” replied Lingling.

“It wasn’t?” Mo Fan was surprised. He assumed it to be solid proof, yet it turned out to not belong to either the Dark Beast Monsters or the Cursed Beasts.

“It’s even more corrosive. Not only did it stop any plant from growing in the soil for more than four years, it even made it poisonous, too. I remember that the City Hunters were here to investigate someone being poisoned. I can’t tell if these two are related. We need more clues, but the Black Vatican is hiding in the dark with a great disguise. There are around two thousand people in this manor. We’ll need more information to identify them among the others,” said Lingling sternly.

Mo Fan nodded. He immediately told Lingling the good news about how he and Mu Ningxue stumbled upon Carly and the captain of the City Hunters last night.

“That’s good to hear; at least it will distract the Black Vatican for now. We still can’t tell if that Carly is with the Black Vatican, but I think she’s very suspicious,” said Lingling. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“There’s something else...but I’m not sure if it has anything to do with the Black Vatican,” Mo Fan filtered out the insignificant details as he explained the strange incident.

Lingling fell into deep thoughts after hearing the affair between Rong Sheng, Wang Xuxu, Zhao Pinlin, and Guo Wenyi.

“Maybe it isn’t related to the Black Vatican.”

“I think so too, even if something is fishy about it, it’s most likely that Zhao Pinlin is using some dirty trick to force the girl to obey him. I think it’s something the police can help with...” said Mo Fan.

Two days later, a new batch of guests arrived at the manor. They were the entourage of a reputable academic. He was known for counseling people who were having trouble in the modern day with reasonings and Buddhism. In simpler words, he was a famous, influential speaker. The people called him Master Mintian.

Master Mintian had organized a talk at the manor. The day of the talk, there were around four thousand attendees. Luckily, the manor was relatively spacious. It did not feel crowded even when the place held so many people.

Master Mintian had a great reputation. Most of the attendees were rich people who firmly believed in the man’s teachings.

A speaker was a fairly rare occupation in the world of magic. It went without saying that Master Mintian was considered a highly suspicious target by Mo Fan and Lingling without hesitation. After all, the Black Vatican’s brainwashing was fairly scary!

The bar...

Zhao Pinlin was having a drink with an annoyed look.

A waitress with a red bowtie showed up from the corner. Her brown hair was hanging down loosely. Fang Shaoli sat in front of the man with a smile, “What is it? Aren’t you satisfied?”

“That woman, she doesn’t even know my name. She’s just a woman, she should be honored that she caught my attention!” Zhao Pinlin slammed the glass on the table.

“You’re talking about the silver-haired woman. She’s quite special indeed. I can tell she is from a reputable family, judging by her manners,” said Fang Shaoli.

“Humph!”

“How about the other woman?” asked Fang Shaoli.

“I sent her back to her room.”

“Already had enough after just a few days? Well, it’s reasonable. She wasn’t your first option. If I remembered correctly, you knocked on the silver-haired woman’s door first,” said Fang Shaoli.

“How did you know?” Zhao Pinlin was astounded.

“We observe our potential customers very closely. I’ve checked the woman’s identity for you. She’s a member of a little magic family in the capital. It seems that she’s only a Basic Magician, so you won’t be able to have your way with her with the same way you handled Wang Xuxu,” said Fang Shaoli smiled.

“What should I do then?” It was Zhao Pinlin’s first time enjoying the thrill. His whole mind was occupied with Mu Ningxue. Somehow, the harder it was to win her over, the more desirable she became!

“You have to become stronger,” said Fang Shaoli.

“How can I become stronger? I’m not a Magician...”

“You don’t have to be a Magician. Whoever joins us, we’ll let them control a creature that isn’t necessarily weaker than a Magician. I can give you one considering how strong your desire is to lay your hands on the silver-haired woman. In the future, the creature can even help you with thefts, assassinations, or any other needs you have,” said Fang Shaoli.

“Control a creature? Like a summoner?” asked Zhao Pinlin curiously.

“Mmm, something like that, but you’ll need to offer a sacrifice. To prove your sincerity, I suggest you t offer the woman whom you’re already tired of to us. It will turn her into your slave and place her under your control while she suffers from endless torture and pain!” said Fang Shaoli.

Zhao Pinlin was stunned.

He did admit that he was rather annoyed by Wang Xuxu. When he first laid his hands on her, he could feel the pleasure from getting his revenge. However, the woman was cowering and begging him all the time. She never stopped crying. Zhao Pinlin found it extremely annoying.

He had lost his interest in Wang Xuxu, but that did not mean he would offer her as a sacrifice!

Fang Shaoli took out some documents when she saw Zhao Pinlin hesitating. She placed them in front of him.

Zhao Pinlin took a glance at the documents and was shocked to discover that it was a death report. The deceased on it was none other than Wang Xuxu!

In other words, Fang Shaoli had already prepared everything beforehand!

“This death report says she has died of an accident, and it happens after your trip. If you agreed, no one will ever suspect you. From today onward, she will be your slave. You will see her trying to win your favor like a puppy, begging you... It’s the first trial to become one of us. You can’t be a disciple without a slave. That being said, we’ll only help you secure the silver-haired woman after you’ve become a disciple. She is a Magician. Even though she’s only a Basic Magician, our group has to pay a certain price, too. Before we keep our end of the bargain, we have to know how ambitious you are, and how ready you are to join us. It’s quite hilarious if you’re feeling sorry for a woman you have already lost interest in,” mused Fang Shaoli.

Zhao Pinlin hesitated. He knew he had done something inhumane, but it was still within his acceptable boundaries.

However, if Wang Xuxu ended up dead, or was turned into a slave like Fang Shaoli mentioned, it would be crossing the line...

“Can I choose someone else? Someone I don’t know?” asked Zhao Pinlin. He did not mind making someone disappear from the world. He just needed to pick a homeless wanderer. No one cared if they went missing.

“Can’t do, we have to know your determination!” Fang Shaoli’s voice changed. It sounded like an order, with strong pressure!

Zhao Pinlin looked at her. He finally sensed that the woman was not just a little waitress trying to seduce him. Her presence was as scary as an enormous beast, who could devour him with a single bite!

“Are you serious that not only can I get what I want now, I can get many more if I join you?” Zhao Pinlin asked in a deep voice.

“Of course! I know you kept thinking of replacing your cousin who humiliated you before, but unfortunately, you aren’t as business-minded as he is.”

“Fine...I’ll join you.”

“Very well, you’ll have to complete the ritual yourself.” Fang Shaoli nodded at Zhao Pinlin. She withdrew her aura and put on a gentle smile, “If you had shaken your head just then, I’d be turning you into my slave tonight. I enjoy turning men who encroached on me into slaves that I can whip at every day, hehe!”

The gentle smile turned into an evil grin. Zhao Pinlin subconsciously shivered. He asked in a soft voice, “Is your...your position higher?”

“I will tell you once you finish the ritual. I have high hopes for you, a man with wild ambitions and endless greed!”
