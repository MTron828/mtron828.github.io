Life on the peninsula was relaxing and simple, the biggest reason it attracted many tourists. The Mediterranean Sea was currently the safest sea, and the best option for people that wanted to enjoy their vacation by the seashore.

“There’s a place called the Blue Woods around here. Is anyone interested?” Kris asked.

“Blue trees? Are they worth taking a look at?” Zhao Manyan replied absently. His thoughts were filled with the slender waists of the women along the beach. He was not interested in trees at all.

“Is there anything special about them?” Mo Fan asked.

“You’ll know when we get there!” Kris led the way.

They went past some crowded areas before approaching a primitive forest that covered half the peninsula. There seemed to be some demon plants inside the forest, as the people of the village had forbidden the villagers and tourists from going inside.

Kris and the others were Mages, so they were not too worried about their safety. They went straight through the forest.

“Kris, you seem quite familiar with this place?” Heidi asked him.

“Of course, I grew up here,” Kris smiled. He seemed a little shy.

“I see, so the blue trees you mentioned... wow, those trees... how...how...how are they growing on the sea?” Mo Fan brushed away the shrubs blocking his path and saw a bunch of blue plants along the coast.

The blue plants were not growing on some sand or soil. They were growing out of the sea!

The water near the peninsula was calm. The bright moon really set off the elegant view of the coast at night. The trees growing on the surface of the sea were reflecting a mystical light under the dim dances of the fireflies. Most importantly, they could see the water flowing through the trunks and the branches...

“It’s so pretty!” Heidi was dazzled by the spectacular view. She did not expect to find such a unique plant on the peninsula.

“In the past, no one dared to come here. They kept saying the demon trees would drag us away and eat us, but I always came here alone secretly. For some reason, it’s easier for me to calm my thoughts when I cultivate here. I feel calm and peaceful. I bet everyone is in a bad mood after what happened today, so I decided to bring you all here to help forget the unpleasant experience,” Kris told them. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The place was like his secret little garden. The people on the peninsula never came here. The blue trees growing on the sea were as mystical as usual. He was filled with hope whenever he looked at them.

“Kris, what kind of trees are they? Is it only possible to grow them here?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“Oh, I call them the Blue Ocean Trees. I don’t really know how they are growing on the water. I found some fruits when I was just a kid. I threw the seeds into the sea after eating them. To my surprise, the seeds sprouted as soon as they touched the water, and they grew into these trees in just a few years. I was amazed by how good they looked, so I collected more seeds and threw them into the sea,” Kris said.

“Are there a lot of the fruits you mentioned?” Mu Ningxue asked.

“Quite a lot of them. They normally grow on land, but no one bothers eating their fruits since they aren’t very tasty. I think no one knows their seeds will grow into trees on the sea. Do you like them? I can help you collect them if you want. If you have a private beach, you can make it prettier by planting these trees!” Kris said.

“I’m not just treating them as decoration. Our Fanxue Mountain is facing the sea and close to a maritime battlefield. If these Blue Ocean Trees can grow on the water, it means we can make the battlefield into more favorable terrain. It will help a lot when we fend off the sea monsters. It might lower the casualties,” Mu Ningxue said.

“That’s right, these Blue Ocean Trees could be planted at the maritime battlefields! Why didn’t I think about that before!?” Kris smacked himself on the head.

He had only noticed how beautiful they were, yet Mu Ningxue immediately thought about how she could plant them along the Fanxue Mountain’s coast to give humans an advantage when fighting on the sea!

If it did not take much effort to plant these trees, they could plant a whole bunch of them to form a natural barrier along the coast at Donghai. It would protect the coast from huge tides and slow down the invasion of sea monsters!

“Let me handle it, these trees are very interesting indeed. If we can plant them at a large scale...” Mu Bai said.

Kris was glad to be of any help. He led Mu Bai deeper into the forest to show him the fruits.

“Xuexue, you are starting to look like a mayor,” Mo Fan complimented.

“I need you to stay at Fanxue Mountain for some time when we go back. There are a lot of things we need to do,” Mu Ningxue said.

“Sure, I promise to stay by your side at Fanxue Mountain. I’ll do everything you say!” Mo Fan agreed promptly.

Zhao Manyan immediately rolled his eyes. He should not have come in the first place. His eyes were hurting from the public display of affection between the two. It was just some trees floating on the water. How was it even impressive? He preferred to lie on the tender bellies of the ladies...

“The stars here are pretty too... huh, is that a meteor!?” Heidi was lying on the beach. She suddenly pointed at the sky.

“Heidi, why are you acting like a little girl? Why don’t you make a wish? It’s a meteor after all... holy crap, why is the meteor so huge?” Zhao Manyan lifted his gaze and was shocked to see a meteorite sweeping across the sky. It seemed to be heading toward them!

“That thing is flying so fast, it’s setting the sky on fire!”

The object falling from the sky left a burning trail behind. The thing was engulfed in flames too. It did not take long for it to fall from the sky. It did resemble a meteorite that had fallen into Earth from space!

“It looks like a person,” Mo Fan said with a frown when he saw the thing approaching.

“Wouldn’t a human burn to death traveling at such a crazy speed? Is his flesh indestructible or what!?”

“I think I’ve seen it before!” Kris’ voice came from the woods behind.
