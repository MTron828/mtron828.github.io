Chapter 2661: Not One will be Spared!

—

Snow was flying around like goose feathers on Fanxue Mountain. The whole mountain was white. The trees were covered in white, setting off the sacred feel of the Fanxue Villa.

Normally, Fanxue Mountain was extremely peaceful, unlike other renowned clans with tight security and clear classification of ranks and status. However, the whole mountain was full of guards today.

Over the years, Fanxue Mountain had established its own group of Mages to protect Fanxue New City. It was almost like an army, and so it had a certain level of influence in Feiniao Headquarters City.

Fanxue Mountain had helped Feiniao Headquarters City many times over the years, be it sending their Mages to defend the coastline, taking over resource-rich territories of the sea monsters, or sending out their people to help construct the maritime battlefields. To its surprise, the authorities of Feiniao Headquarters City had now sent out its army to confine them!

Not many people believed it when they first heard the news. Fanxue Mountain was the main reason why Feiniao Headquarters City was able to grow to its current size, yet its leaders were suddenly pointing their swords at Fanxue Mountain, instead of being grateful to them!

“Those shameless pricks!”

“In the end, they still want to claim our Fanxue Mountain. We have put so much effort into this place and developing the city. They are no different from bandits!” Mu Linsheng snarled in the meeting hall.

How unacceptable, they had helped build Feiniao Headquarters City. How could the authorities do this to them?

They had sent out an army to suppress them. They were also not allowed to fight back!

“Let’s calm down. We should find out who made the call,” Mu Ningxue said firmly.

“Is there any difference? It was the decision of Feiniao Headquarters City’s government. They clearly want us dead!” Mu Linsheng snarled.

“It was the mayor, Lin Kang,” Shao Yu informed them.

She had received the news from her men. They had learned about the situation in advance, but they did not have time to ask for backup. Mayor Lin Kang had already surrounded Fanxue City. They would soon reach Fanxue Mountain!

“What right does he have to pick a fight with us? We have already reached the level of a renowned clan. Let’s all calm down. I’ve already asked my clan for help. They will be here very soon,” Bai Hongfei said.

“They are clearly trying to take us out in a single blow, without giving us any chances!”

“It seems like the Mu Clan and Zhao Clan have sent some of their strong Mages too.”

“The Dali Clan, Southern Mercenary Alliance, and Nanrong Clan are here, too!”

“They are organizing a crusade against us!”

No one had expected this to happen so quickly. It was true that many smaller families and clans had been annexed by larger clans recently. The country and Magic Association had been turning a blind eye to it, but it was shocking how those clans were now blatantly teaming up against Fanxue Mountain.

“Someone must be pushing this.” Mu Linsheng started analyzing the facts after he calmed himself.

“There’s nothing to think about. They are obviously here for the Earth Flame Pistil. Someone leaked out the news that we have the Earth Flame Pistil, so everyone wants a share of it. They are also using it as an excuse to take us out, so all our enemies have gathered at the foot of the mountain,” Mo Fan said.

“We have caught ourselves a hot potato. I didn’t think the Earth Flame Pistil would lure so many wolves to us. We are in a terrible spot. They are clearly trying to end us before we can pass the Earth Flame Pistil to Chief Hua,” Jiang Shaoxu frowned.

“It’s not like we were planning to embezzle it. We were going to hand it to the country and the military. Won’t they be going against the country instead?”

“As long as it’s still on our hands, they can accuse us of trying to embezzle it, giving them a valid excuse to send out the army against us...”

“I didn’t think Zhao Jing would be able to convince Lin Kang!”

“Humph, Lin Kang is obviously not on the same side as us. He has been eying us covetously since he was appointed mayor. When they were building the new city hall, they told us to move to another mountain because they were planning to build the city hall in our territory. Was he out of his mind? We have been here since Feiniao City was just a small city. Not only did he come and reap everything, he’s trying to take away our territory, too!” Mu Linsheng had lost his temper at the mention of Lin Kang.

The whole world was struggling to survive the sea monsters’ invasion, but some officials were putting all their attention on their personal interests, instead of protecting the people and the cities. Feiniao Headquarters City had fought countless battles with the sea monsters, and Fanxue Mountain had helped in every one of them!

To their surprise, the authorities of Feiniao Headquarters City had agreed with Lin Kang’s plan, despite such a ridiculous excuse!

The current officials of Feiniao Headquarters City were truly disappointing!

“Boss, what do we do now? We will be breaking the law if we try to fight back!” Mu Linsheng, despite being Fanxue Mountain’s strategist, had no clue how to approach the situation.

“They are officers just because they claim they are? I’m the hero of the country. If they are coming after me, won’t they be going against the country?” Mo Fan scoffed angrily.

Mo Fan had never planned to embezzle the Earth Flame Pistil.

The five Headquarters Cities were troubled by harsh weather and the strange disease. The Earth Flame Pistil was their only hope. They had risked their lives when they went to Lanyang and found the Earth Flame Pistil, and had gone through all the troubles of taking it back from the Northern Sacred Bears.

In the end, a group of ambitious pricks had colluded with one another to accuse them of a serious crime before they could even hand the Earth Flame Pistil over to the country. They were coming after both the Earth Flame Pistil and Fanxue Mountain!

The question was, wouldn’t their stomachs burst for being too greedy?

Many people were jealous of Fanxue Mountain because of its rapid growth over the years. Fanxue Mountain had unintentionally made a lot of enemies as a result, and Lin Kang and Zhao Jing had gathered them all today.

They had formed an alliance of robbers to divide up the profits! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was a wonderful idea, but did they ever wonder if they could take out Fanxue Mountain so easily?

“If they dare to come, we won’t spare a single one of them!” Mo Fan declared with a vicious expression.

To think that someone was bold enough to pick on him. Perhaps he had been too kind to this world that was full of assh**** and scum!
