Frank extended his sapphire-blue wings once again and swiftly flew to the top of the highest Dragon Fang.

Mo Fan did not allow himself to be outdone, either. He leapt between the Dragon Fangs and gradually approached the tallest Dragon Fang, trying to go head to head with Frank.

“Didn’t Prince Beny specifically tell you to teach me a lesson, and humiliate me in front of the few hundred million people watching the match? Why are you cowering now?” Mo Fan taunted him.

Frank’s eyes flickered coldly. He pointed at Mo Fan and said, “Just wait and see, even if you have some strange ability, it’s nothing before my innate talent!”

“Oh, what kind of innate talent do you have? Feel free to use it! It’s been a while since I last fought a guy that could last more than ten rounds against me. I hope you won’t let me down, since you were specifically sent here to deal with me!” Mo Fan grinned.

“Don’t be too full of yourself!” Frank snapped furiously.

“So what? I’ll beat the crap out of you as my way of paying respect to your shitty prince!” The flames engulfing Mo Fan grew even stronger as his fist erupted in flames while he threw a punch!

The Fiery Fist flew right at the tallest Dragon Fang Frank was standing on!

Frank suddenly emitted a strange glow, and as a blue flame gathered on his fist, the strange glow surprisingly merged with his fist, too!

Even though the two of them were casting the same spell, the blue flame spreading in the shape of a fan seemed to be a lot stronger than Mo Fan’s fire. It immediately devoured Mo Fan’s flames.

As the blue burning fist came in, Mo Fan agilely leapt to another Dragon Fang. He turned around and looked at the Dragon Fang that was smashed into pieces behind him in astonishment.

“Weren’t you confident just then? I dare you to attack me head-on again!” The strange glow appeared once again as Frank was casting the Sky-Flame Funeral.

Frank did not shove the Sky-Flame Funeral into the sky, but gathered it on his right wrist instead.

Mo Fan did not try to run away even when he saw the man placing the Sky-Flame Funeral on his fist. He gathered all the flames around him into his wrist, too!

“Rain of Burning Fists!” Frank yelled as the strange glow merged with the blue flame.

A Fiery Fist sprang forward, yet it further split into countless fiery fists, like the raindrops of a great downpour, surging in Mo Fan’s direction!

The fists poured down like rain as the flames spread like a curtain. The combination of Sky-Flame Funeral and Fiery Fist that Frank had just cast immediately stunned the crowd. Everyone’s eyes widened as they watched the Fiery Fists pouring down in a spectacular, destructive display.

Mo Fan raised his head and realized that he was surrounded by the Fiery Fists. He could no longer dodge the approaching Fiery Fists.

“Is his innate talent the ability to merge different spells?” Mo Fan was astounded too.

It was unlikely that an ordinary Fire Mage could combine the Sky-Flame Funeral and the Fiery Fist into a single spell. After all, a Star Pattern was different than a Star Constellation. The levels between different spells were strictly defined, and even a Fire Mage with an outstanding level of control was unable to merge two spells into one!

Mo Fan had to admit that the Rain of Burning Fists was a lot more imperious than the Sky-Flame Funeral, since tiny raindrops could mostly patter on the ground, but a rain of fists would simply leave countless holes in the ground!

Each Fiery Fist contained some destructive force, and when Fiery Fists started pouring down like rain, the damage it would deal was absolutely insane!

The Fiery Fists descended rapidly. He was devoured by the flames of the Fiery Fists before he could make his move.

The water continued to evaporate under the scorching heat, while the Dragon Fangs were smashed into pieces. The flames spread wildly across the arena. Frank’s attack had totally shocked the crowd, leaving everyone with their eyes and mouths wide open!

“I bet it didn’t feel great,” Prince Beny chuckled in joy after getting his revenge.

Conti was lost in thought, too. She was still wondering how it was possible to combine different spells into one.

“Miss Conti, do you still think Frank is no match for that guy?” Prince Beny said proudly.

“The owner of a Fire Spirit usually has outstanding Fire Resistance, I don’t think he will be defeated so easily,” Conti said.

“What difference would that make? Even a few Water Curtains are nowhere enough to defend against an attack of this scale!” Beny declared indifferently.

Conti was about to speak when she caught a glimpse of a figure standing firmly on top of an undamaged Dragon Fang amid the Rain of Burning Fists.

Water vapor was rising continuously in his surroundings. He was still engulfed in the same combination of brown-red and blazing red flames. After taking a closer look, Conti discovered that the man was not as miserable as she thought, apart from a few burns.

The Rain of Burning Fists was strong enough to defeat a whole team, let alone defeat a single representative of a national team. However, the man simply stood there and took it, and it turned out that he had only suffered some minor injuries!

“His Fire Resistance...” Conti’s face was filled with astonishment.

He was barely injured even after receiving such a strong attack!

—

“Oh my!”

“He hasn’t even used his defensive equipment?”

“Was that guy’s body forged with fire? How did he even survive that?”

The proud smile on Prince Beny and Frank’s faces totally vanished, especially Frank, who was extremely familiar with how powerful his Rain of Burning Fists was. It was basically his strongest attack, and even those wearing expensive magic armor would be blasted beyond recognition, yet how was the guy totally fine after receiving it head-on!?

“Is that all you have?” Mo Fan’s gaze sharpened. The fiery aura that had been put out not long ago rose again, and it seemed to be slightly stronger than before!

Mo Fan’s body was sturdier than any ordinary person’s. After all, the Demon Element was one of the Elements that Mo Fan had Awakened, and it had granted Mo Fan the ability to endure many attacks without danger!

Leaving the Demon Element aside, being Possessed by Flame Belle did not just grant him a stunning appearance. Using the Fire Element in front of the creature who was blessed with the Calamity Fire was like displaying one’s insignificant skill before an expert. The Flame Belle’s Fire Resistance was absolutely ridiculous, and an Advanced Fire Spell was only going to scratch the outside of her boot!

Little Flame Belle had absorbed most of the damage, and Mo Fan was simply too lazy to dodge the rest of it, since it was easily within the limits that his Demon Flesh could endure!

“I’ve tasted your fire, it’s time for you to taste mine!” Mo Fan grunted.

The energy that Mo Fan had long accumulated in his right fist sprang forward like an army of galloping horses as soon as he threw a punch forward. The blazing flames immediately set half the stage on fire!

A stunning fiery dragon lunged forward with a blasting roar!

The fiery dragon sprang forward and knocked Frank into the air. Frank felt like he had been bitten by a red dragon, and if it was not for the expensive Armor protecting him, his flesh would have been burned into ashes in an instant!

The outer layer of his Armor was set aflame, and the heat was burning him despite the Armor in between. Frank did have a certain fire resistance, since he wielded the Fire Element, yet it was nothing compared to Mo Fan’s, since he was not Possessed by a Fire Spirit...

The fire dragon soared into the air and exploded at a height of a hundred meters. Flames sprouted and danced wildly. The explosion had blasted Frank’s Armor into pieces, falling to the ground!

“Save him, or he’s going to be knocked out!” the Water Mage hiding underwater immediately yelled.

Palice was aware of how grim the situation was. She started drawing the Star Constellation of the Healing Element...

Several faint glimmers appeared around Frank. The light was synchronized with the glow emitted by the Star Constellation taking shape close to Palice. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was the Advanced Healing Spell, the flickering motes forming an Aquarius sign that would encapsulate the target to protect them while healing the person’s injuries.

Normally, any serious injuries would take a longer time and more energy to heal, including damage dealt to a person’s bones, organs, and veins. A Healing Spirit would have a hard time mending them, but the Aquarius Star Sign could, and it could even heal damage dealt to organs within a short period!

—

“Don’t give her a chance to heal him!” Nanyu blurted out.

Mo Fan had finally secured an advantage for the team in the duel against Frank, yet they would soon lose the advantage if they allowed the opponent Healer to treat Frank with the Aquarius Star Sign!

“Leave it to me!” Jiang Shaoxu immediately focused and locked her gaze on the Spanish Healer, Palice. Her Spiritual Force sprang forward at the speed of lightning, targeting the mind of the Healer.

She had drawn two-thirds of the Star Constellation, so Jiang Shaoxu had struck at the perfect time. Not only would she disrupt the spell, the target would also waste the energy needed to cast an Advanced Spell!

“Spirit Wall!”

As Jiang Shaoxu was seconds away from disrupting the channeling, another man on the Spanish team reacted quickly and immediately set up a Spirit Wall right in front of Palice, preventing Jiang Shaoxu’s Spiritual Force from going any further.

“Crap, they also have a Psychic Mage!” Jiang Shaoxu was startled.

—

The Aquarius Star Sign was about to take shape. The blue glow formed its sacred protection, gradually encapsulating Frank within it...

Mo Fan harrumphed coldly when he saw the blue light. His eyes emitted a silver light!

“Still trying to heal him? Come over here!” Mo Fan grabbed out with his hand. His Illusionary Claw grabbed at Frank firmly from over a hundred meters away as he was about to land on the ground.

The moment the Aquarius Star Sign was completed, Mo Fan pulled his hand back fiercely, tossing Frank heavily onto a Dragon Fang further into the distance.

The Aquarius Star Sign had a limited range, and once its target was out of range, it could no longer protect them!

Mo Fan’s sister was an expert with the Healing Element, so he was utterly familiar with the limitations of the Advanced Healing Spell. The Aquarius Star Sign reached the maximum range from its caster, but it had no chance of reaching the injured Frank!
