“Just say it!” said Mo Fan in an unpleasant tone.

“Do you remember the cave we used to hide from the rain?” Shorty purposely glanced at the villagers and asked after knowing that they were all at the back.

“Yeah, the one that you found when you’re hunting a Blood Beast, what’s wrong?”

“After killing the Blood Beast, we decided to rest up at Sunny Goat Village. However, we stumbled into a scouting team on the way there who had just left Sunny Goat Village. They gave us some replenishment, so we returned to Ancient Capital straightaway using this path. Not long after we returned to the Ancient Capital, we heard that the scouting team went missing...” Shorty lowered his voice, as if he did not want anyone to hear him. He was at ease when he realized that only the guy who had lost his memory was close to Mo Fan.

“Mm, it’s most likely that they were killed by the undead in the wild. My brother’s squad was ambushed by the undead along their journey too,” Mo Fan glanced at Zhang Xiaohou beside him.

“Mm, I assumed so too, but do you know what the scouting team told us when they bumped into us?” Shorty wore an evil smile.

“What did they say?” asked Mo Fan.

“They told us Sunny Goat Village is completely empty. They told us there’s no point in going there,” said Shorty.

Mo Fan was utterly confused.

However, Zhang Xiaohou, who was also listening to the whispers between the two, shuddered violently as his blank eyes widened!

“Don’t you think it’s strange? The chief is also avoiding the path to Sunny Goat Village. It’s obvious that the chief doesn’t want us to go there,” added Shorty.

Mo Fan glanced at Xie Sang and fell into deep thoughts.

The group continued on with the journey. Everyone was still unharmed during the second night.

They were fairly close to Ancient Capital after the second night. They would arrive close to the Ancient Capital today.

“It’s daytime, we’ll move on once everyone is ready. We should arrive at the Ancient Capital before night time,” yelled Hong Jun, waking everyone up.

“Hong Jun, you spent a few years learning Magic outside of the village. Are you able to find places for us to live once we arrive in the Ancient Capital?” asked a woman.

“Don’t worry, don’t worry!” Hong Jun patted his chest, implying that he would handle everything.

“Sigh, feels like we’re safe now. I thought we were abandoned by the God of the Well.”

“Gouzi, look at how you’ve scared everyone, humph!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The villagers felt more at ease, each wearing a faint smile on their face.

The group had stayed safe for two nights straight, and their journey would come to an end after today. Their lives were no longer in danger.

Since it was daytime, everyone was more scattered across the place. Mo Fan remained at the front of the group...

Shorty never stopped talking. The guy came up to Mo Fan to boast about his achievements. Mo Fan snorted disdainfully at Shorty and simply boasted about his achievements in Bo City...

“So you’re from Bo City! I do know a few friends from there,” exclaimed Shorty, surprised.

“How do you know people from Bo City?” Mo Fan was confused.

“Oh, I talked to them a lot. They were brought here to stay in the Ancient Capital after the calamity. They were told to live in the outskirts in the past, but a rich young man called Mu Bai bought a street to sell Magic Ores, so the refugees from Bo City ended up working for him,” said Shorty.

Mo Fan was startled, but then recalled the arrangements made after the calamity.

The refugees of Bo City were arranged in batches. The first batch was allocated to the outskirts of Shanghai, while the second batch was sent to the Ancient Capital. Mo Fan chose Shanghai, and he was arranged to stay at the edge of the city as he hoped for. Now that Shorty had mentioned it, he immediately recalled that the other batch was sent here to the Ancient Capital!

It was rare to bump into people from his hometown. He would have to pay them a visit soon...

“I would also sell Magic Ores to their stores sometimes...” said Shorty.

“AHHHH~!” Suddenly, a cry of agony came from behind them!

The scream was distorted due to great pain. The sudden sound simply gave the entire group a great scare.

Shorty instantly stopped talking, while Mo Fan quickly turned around and saw blood mist spraying in the sky, followed by the villagers screaming and fleeing in a panic!

“Undead, it’s the undead!”

“My uncle is being dragged away, dead, he’s dead!”

“AH~!”

Another terrifying screech appeared. A woman who was running away in fear fell to the ground after tripping. A long claw burst out from the loose ground. Its incredible force instantly penetrated the woman’s body, leaving those who witnessed it with an uneasy feeling in their stomachs!

“There’s one here!”

“Help me! Help!”

“Don’t panic, everyone stay calm...”

The villagers who ran the furthest were the easiest prey for the undead. Mo Fan quickly scanned the place and saw the undead that were assumed to be nocturnal climbing out from the ground and attacking the fleeing villagers.

It had only been a few seconds, yet the whole place had blood splattering everywhere!

“Holy crap, these undead are insane, killing people in the day!” screamed Shorty.

“Head to the side; Liu Ru, protect the kids, don’t let them run away in panic,” yelled Mo Fan.

More undead were appearing from the ground. The protection the villagers were under was completely useless. As a matter of fact, the undead were only targeting the villagers.

Normally, the undead would feed on their targets after entrapping them. The zombies in the surroundings would simply stack on top of another following the scent of fresh blood. However, the undead that were attacking them were not feeding instead. They continued to hunt the next target down. It was a bloody massacre!

“Lightning Strike!”

“Swift Star Wolf!”

“Giant Shadow Spike!”

Mo Fan was furious when he saw the villagers being murdered. He was not in the mood to preserve his strength. He simply used every move he could.

However, the villagers had already lost their minds and were running in all directions.

Even Mo Fan was unable to save everyone under such circumstances. He could only watch them being torn into pieces by the zombies.

“Houzi, Rock...”

“Rock Barrier!”

Mo Fan was just about to tell Zhang Xiaohou to cast the Spell, but it seemed like the amnesia did not take away his rationality. He followed his instincts and cast the Intermediate Earth Spell.

Two consecutive Rock Barriers quickly formed walls around the group, stopping the villagers from running too far away while blocking the zombies from coming in.

Mo Fan jumped onto the barrier and screamed at Liu Ru who was still outside the walls, “Liu Ru, gather all the kids inside the barrier. Zhang Xiaohou has strengthened the ground in this area. There won’t be any undead coming out!”
