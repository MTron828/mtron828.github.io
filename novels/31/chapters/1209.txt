Mo Fan walked up to the entrance and saw more than forty Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards on the move and moving rapidly. Some were flanking Zheng Tong, and some were charging at the team behind.

“Zheng Tong is being overrun!” Lu Fang said.

“We have to back off now. We have to maintain our formation,” Li Sichong said.

“Don’t worry, just hold your ground and focus on setting up your defense. Leave the rest to Mo Fan,” Jiang Shaoxu said.

“Are you kidding me? There are at least fifty Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards coming at us! Even Zheng Tong and Tong Zhuang didn’t manage to stop them. How could he possibly hold the demon creatures off by himself?” Lu Fang half-screamed.

Just as Lu Fang finished his sentence, he saw a stormy cloud loom over the sand dune with a deep rumble. A shocking lightning claw swept down, disintegrating more than ten Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards in an instant. Their blood splattered in the air.

The eyes of Lu Fang, Li Sichong, Xu Pingdong, and the others widened, their faces filled with astonishment!

The dark lightning claw was made up of extremely powerful lightning bolts. It had killed the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards in an instant!

A burned smell lingered in the air. Zheng Tong subconsciously turned around and stared at Mo Fan in astonishment...

-Was he the one that summoned the lightning claw?

-Did he seriously kill so many Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards with just a single move?-

“Holy crap, is he even human!?” Li Sichong exclaimed.

It took Zheng Tong and Tong Zhuang significant effort just to kill a single Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopard, but Mo Fan had simply killed a bunch of them with a single spell. Those struck by his lightning stood no chance at all. Words were not needed to describe the difference in their strength.

“Lightning Tyrant Domain!”

Mo Fan did not waste any more time. He immediately established his Domain when he saw the rest of the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards surrounding him.

Lightning Magic was plentiful within his Domain, allowing Mo Fan to cast his Lightning Spells even faster. When the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards gathered around him boldly, Mo Fan raised his head and looked up at the sky. Countless lightning strikes came down and surged across the area!

The lightning danced wildly. Every time a lightning strike struck the ground, it would further split into different lightning arcs. The lightning chains stacked on top of one another, forming a powerful lightning web spreading rapidly across the sand and the dunes...

The fifth-tier Thunderbolt worked perfectly in a situation like this. Mo Fan forcibly impeded the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards with his Lightning. The lightning arcs surged back and forth between the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards like whips!

With a huge blast, hundreds of yellow lightning bolts descended rapidly from the sky above Mo Fan, landing on the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards that had been tagged with marks. The Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards were severely injured after the first wave of lightning strikes, and were turned into scattering ashes, not a single corpse being left behind!

The people of the Golden Battle Hunters opened their eyes and mouths wide. Their team was in danger of being surrounded by demon creatures just a moment ago, but not a single demon creature remained after the spectacular lightning display.

Zheng Tong, Tong Zhuang, and Yang Bao were struggling to handle thirty Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards on their own, yet this young man had killed more than fifty Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards with his lightning alone. Was he a monster!?

—

Zheng Tong, Tong Zhuang, and Yang Bao stood on the hills, preventing the demon creatures from slipping through their perimeter. Meanwhile, the others were trying their best to recover their energy. However, their eyes were still glued to Mo Fan.

Mo Fan stood at the entrance. He had yet to use his other Elements, and he rarely used the Advanced Lightning Spell, either. The lightning surging around wildly was just too much for the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards, even when they were fully covered in armor. They stood no chance against Mo Fan’s Lightning Tyrant, which was twelve times stronger than an ordinary Lightning Spell!

Soon, Mo Fan had basically wiped out an entire leap of Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards. Zheng Tong was still in the middle of a battle, yet the number of demon creatures he had killed was nothing compared to Mo Fan!

“Why do I feel like he can easily take on them all by himself? So this is how strong the champion of the World College Tournament is? He’s an alien!” Li Sichong was amazed.

This young man was around ten, twenty years younger than them! He was just too strong! He had butchered the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards like they were mere cattle.

The others finally realized why Zhang Xiaohou, Mu Nujiao, Jiang Shaoxu, and the others were sticking close to him. The man’s firepower was equivalent to an entire team!

“Come back here, I’ll treat your injuries,” Li Sichong said.

“I’m fine, check on the others. The venom on the stingers is quite deadly. It’s necessary to treat their wounds now,” Mo Fan said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The team had wiped out both dens of the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards. Mo Fan had killed most of them, since he was able to kill every demon creature caught by his Lightning. If the team had not seen how much Zheng Tong and the others were struggling, they would have assumed that the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards were just Servant-class creatures!

“How impressive, you don’t even have a single scratch on you... I saw that you used mostly Intermediate Spells too, so I bet you didn’t even expend much energy, right?” Lu Fang had a whole new level of respect for Mo Fan. He was utterly impressed.

The man was so strong at such a young age! It suddenly felt embarrassing how highly the older Hunters had thought of themselves.

Lu Fang was not feeling too bad, but Zheng Tong’s expression was as gloomy as could be. They might have resolved the danger, but somehow, he felt even worse than when he was surrounded by the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards!

He had been mocking Mo Fan for not contributing constantly along the journey.

It was obvious why Mo Fan had not contributed along the journey. He was a fighter. He had a poor sense of direction, so he could not really help with navigation. Ge Ming was commanding the team, Zhang Xiaohou was in charge of reconnaissance. There was basically nothing for him to do.

However, the aged Hunters were utterly dumbfounded as soon as he started contributing. Somehow, they felt like even their leader Ge Ming would not be able to kill the demon creatures so quickly!

“Brother Mo Fan, we actually didn’t agree with the leader taking you guys on the team, but it turns out that each one of you is an expert in your field. Please forgive our ignorance,” Lu Fang said with a smile.

“It’s true that most students from institutes didn’t have much practical experience. It’s reasonable for you to reject us in the first place,” Mo Fan smiled back. He was in a good mood after seeing how the attitude of the team had shifted all of a sudden.

Didn’t he keep quiet for so long just so he could give them such a huge surprise, after all?

As a matter of fact, Mo Fan was a Hunter Master himself. His rank was even higher than some of the Hunters on the team. Lingling, whom the Hunters thought was just a little girl, might even have the highest rank on the team!

—

Another group of demon creatures showed up after the team managed to get some rest. However, these demon creatures were weaker than the Aquamarine Armor Scorpion Leopards, and they were even fewer in number. Mo Fan gladly claimed their Soul Remnants.

This time, Yang Bao and Tong Zhuang did not bother helping considering how slow they were at killing the demon creatures. They simply stayed with the team to rest up, to preparing themselves for the Commander-level creatures they might stumble into.

Zheng Tong was unwilling to accept his defeat. He even used his Advanced Spells a few times, yet they were still less efficient than Mo Fan’s fifth-tier Thunderbolt: Lightning Chain, and the following-up Tyrant Call. It was a great blow to Zheng Tong’s dignity!

The spells of each level were around ten times stronger than the spells of the previous level, and might be bigger, depending on the Elements. However, Zheng Tong was devastated when he learned that the Intermediate Spells of the man he looked down on turned out to be equivalent to his Advanced Spell. He had the urge to forfeit his cultivation!

Zheng Tong was completely worn out from the fight, yet Mo Fan looked as if he had just taken a stroll in the park. He had resolved the danger with his destructive Lightning, and did not even need to use his other Elements.

“Is everyone alright?” The team heard Ge Ming’s voice behind them.

Ge Ming regrouped with the team. He was actually feeling uneasy when he saw the strange looks on his members’ faces. Could it be that they had lost someone again?

“Leader, where did you meet this young man? He single-handedly annihilated the demon creatures! We didn’t even need to do anything. We thought it was going to be a tough battle, but we ended up sitting here and enjoying a sunbath,” Tong Zhuang spoke up.

Ge Ming was utterly relieved when he realized that there were no casualties. He looked at Mo Fan, who was taking out the remaining demon creatures.

Ge Ming had never seen Mo Fan in action. He did not watch the World College Tournament either, but judging from the remains of the demon creatures destroyed by the young man’s Lightning, he could easily tell how outstanding his strength was!

“We almost fell into the Black Vatican’s trap last time. It was Brother Mo Fan that saved us,” Ge Ming said.

“I remember now! Didn’t the President of the Clock Tower Magic Association announce some news recently? Don’t tell me he was referring to this young man?” Lu Fang blurted out as he recalled something.

“Yeah, that’s him,” Ge Ming nodded.

“Heavens, why didn’t you tell us earlier?!”

“I thought you already knew...”

“Why would we? We never cared about those things. We were too occupied with killing demon creatures!”

“No wonder he’s so strong! With him on the team, our journey is going to be a lot safer... but I never thought he was this young, I’m starting to feel ashamed of myself!”

Most people were struggling against the demon creatures, as their energy had depleted, yet Mo Fan’s team-equivalent firepower was just too unbelievable. They had seen many Advanced Mages with Domains too, yet none of them were as strong as Mo Fan!

“Mu Nujiao, do you feel like Mo Fan is a lot stronger than he was during the tournament?” Jiang Shaoxu asked.

Mu Nujiao nodded back. They were both familiar with Mo Fan’s strength, yet the strength that he had displayed had exceeded their expectations once again...

“I bet the base damage of his Lightning has increased a lot after the Blessing of the God’s Seal... somehow, I feel like his Lightning is already beyond the potency of a Soul-grade Seed,” Jiang Shaoxu murmured.

“Indeed!”
