Mo Fan stood amid the pack of wolves on the central plaza, smiling at the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was enraged. It thought it was in a one-on-one duel, yet the man had Summoned more than ten trucks full of wolves out of nowhere! Shouldn’t he be more sincere as a human when challenging a demon creature to a duel?

“Apas, come out.”

Mo Fan used his Contract Summoning to summon Apas, who had been sleeping in her Contract Space for a long time.

Apas walked out of the lunar-white Summoning Gate. She subconsciously stretched to loosen herself after inhaling the fresh air filled with the smell of mud and rocks after waking up from her deep slumber.

Apas looked like a young teenager, yet her body was more alluring than most women. If it wasn’t for the circumstances they were in, Mo Fan would have seriously pounced on the little snake beauty who was purposely displaying her charm coquettishly in front of him and teach her a lesson!

“PA!” Mo Fan smacked the stretching little snake beauty on her butt. He was quite surprised by the bounce.

“You assh***, I’m going to skin you and use it to make me a pair of boots!” Apas blushed. She had never seen such a perverted master, and why the hell was he using such great force? The right half of her buttock must have reddened!

“Enough playing around, do you see that huge rock monster? I’ll leave it to you. I have something urgent to handle. If you do a nice job, I’ll buy you the goose-feathered down jacket you’ve always wanted!” Mo Fan promised.

“Are you serious?” Apas’ round eyes glittered immediately.

“Mm, if you let me smack you on the left side too...” Mo Fan went on.

“Why don’t you just die, you filth!”

“I’ll be going! Don’t let me down, or you aren’t getting anything,” Mo Fan replied, completely unmoved.

Mo Fan left after placing Apas in charge.

He now had eleven Moon-Devouring White Wolves, all at the Commander level. In addition to them, the number of the White-Marked Wolves and Enormous White Wolves had reached two hundred and seventy. If he let them fight on their own, over half of them would die before dawn arrived.

However, with Apas here, she would preserve the numbers of his Summoned Creatures with a master’s touch, allowing him to deal with the last Black-Silver Rock Demon with peace of mind.

Apas was quite bored after staying inside the Contract Space, but she was not allowed to come out while the Magic Sealing Order had been in place. The city was now in chaos after it was overrun by the Rock Monsters, and she had a bunch of wolves under her command now. She could easily slaughter the Rock Monsters to relieve her boredom!

Apas was a natural leader. Her eyes were already emitting the strong brilliance of one of Medusa’s descendants before she glanced at the Black-Silver Rock Demon looming like a mountain before her.

“A creature that absorbs humans to strengthen itself? That means it must have the Soul-Merging Pieces in its body,” Apas mumbled to herself. Two attractive dimples slowly surfaced on her face, “I can’t let that greedy Mo Fan know about them!”

The Black-Silver Rock Demon might be strong, but it could not handle eleven Commander-level Moon-Devouring White Wolves at once. Besides, these Moon-Devouring White Wolves also had an outstanding power from their lineage, the Moon-Gathering Power!

It was similar to the Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s lineage of the Flying Creek. The Flying Creek Snow Wolf’s strength would increase significantly when his surroundings were covered in ice. It would also grant the Flying Creek Snow Wolf access to more Ice Spells and abilities.

The Moon-Devouring White Wolves were the same. The cold moon hanging in the night sky was able to make them stronger.

The stars were dim, but moonlight was shining down upon the city coldly. It had granted the Moon-Devouring White Wolves great strength, especially their Moon-Devouring Claws. Once they accumulated enough moonlight energy, they could even tear through the thick armor of the Black-Silver Rock Demon with a swipe!

The battle was straightforward and simple once they were able to break through the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s defense. The simple-minded Black-Silver Rock Demon was like a juicy meat rock waiting to be slaughtered!

Wen Xia and her men were intercepted outside the residential area. They were struggling to get any closer to the Black-Silver Rock Demon.

“How’s the situation?” A dark figure suddenly showed up behind Wen Xia, giving the woman who was fully focused on the situation ahead a huge fright.

“Why...why did you come here?” Wen Xia asked.

“The creature at the central plaza is dead for sure. I’m here to deal with the fourth one. Didn’t I promise you that I’d eliminate them all?” Mo Fan smiled.

“Are those white wolves your Summoned Beasts?” Deputy Lieutenant Hou had to ask.

“Brother Mo Fan, did you move an entire wolf valley here? Why do I feel like your Summoning Tide is comparable to half an army?” Fang Di spoke up.

It was not exaggerating to describe the pack of wolves as being as strong as half an army, since an army did not fully consist of Intermediate Mages. The numbers of Advanced Mages were limited, too. The Commander-level Moon-Devouring White Wolves were already equivalent to a few dozen Advanced Mages, not to mention the White-Marked Wolves in the hundreds!... The Intermediate Mages and the Warrior-level creatures were not equally matched, and it was the same for the Advanced Mages and the Commander-level creatures. Comparing them to the quality of the city’s army, the ratio between them was around one to five!

Almost five Intermediate Mages were needed to fight a Rock Monster, but Mo Fan’s White-Marked Wolves were able to take on the Rock Monsters on their own. Therefore, Mo Fan’s Summoning Tide was indeed just as strong as half an army!

However, everyone knew the Summoning Tide would consume a Mage’s energy rapidly, thus its duration was not too long. The dawn would really arrive if these Summoned Creatures could keep fighting!

“I’m merely doing my best,” Mo Fan replied.

“Brother Mo Fan, I’m very impressed by you,” Deputy Lieutenant Hou admitted, feeling somewhat ashamed. He had even mocked Mo Fan to be just a young kid, yet it turned out that he himself was just an insignificant lackey compared to Mo Fan. He was weaker than the man’s Summoned Creature!

“We’ll talk later; how is everything going? I bet this thing is the trickiest among them, right?” Mo Fan stared at the Black-Silver Rock Demon in the residential area.

The Black-Silver Rock Demon was not particularly huge, but its lustrous black shell was truly indestructible. It was a pity that Mo Fan did not take the skill path of Corrupting Darkness, or his Shadow Magic might have been able to break down the Black-Silver Rock Demon’s defense.

“Can’t you use the same Shadow Magic to kill it?” Wen Xia asked.

Mo Fan shook his head and answered, “It’s going to be difficult. My Dark Material needs some time to penetrate its target, similar to Plant Magic, which requires the Mage to plant the seeds and let them take root before they can spread in an area. My Shadow Magic works the same way. Do you think those creatures will give me the chance to do so, under these circumstances?”
